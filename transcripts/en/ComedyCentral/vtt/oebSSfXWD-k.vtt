is Shyamalay, Chalamet,

00:00:02.201 --> 00:00:03.636
that's too much.

00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:05.338
I changed my last name,

00:00:05.371 --> 00:00:06.606
he should consider it.

00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:08.474
He'd have a much bigger,

00:00:39.705 --> 00:00:40.773
- [Sarah] That was it!

00:00:40.806 --> 00:00:41.741
- I have a school
dance next week.

00:00:41.774 --> 00:00:44.144
Maybe Chase could be my date?

00:00:46.178 --> 00:00:48.815
- I was doing musical.lys
on a broken iPod in my,

00:00:48.848 --> 00:00:51.184
lip sync videos on a
broken iPod in my room,

00:00:51.217 --> 00:00:53.820 align:start size:97% position:3%
and I just kind of started
going up, and my mom's like...

00:00:53.853 --> 00:00:55.488
We went to the mall one
day and someone was like,

00:00:55.521 --> 00:00:56.823 align:start size:88% position:13%
'Hey, can I get a
picture with your son?'

00:00:56.856 --> 00:00:58.858 align:start size:88% position:13%
and my mom's like,
'What's going on here?'

00:00:58.891 --> 00:01:00.293
'Cause she has no clue
what's going on either.

00:01:00.326 --> 00:01:02.695
So then she got into
it, and that's kind of,

00:01:02.728 --> 00:01:05.465
How it started, just in my
room, just doing what I like

00:01:05.498 --> 00:01:07.567
and having fun with it, yeah.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.235 align:start size:84% position:16%
- The gays are
turning on the vid.

00:01:09.268 --> 00:01:12.538 align:start size:94% position:6%
They're saying it's quote
'so five years ago'.

00:01:12.571 --> 00:01:13.840
(audience groans)

00:01:13.873 --> 00:01:15.875
- That's the worst
thing you can be.

00:01:15.908 --> 00:01:18.377 align:start size:94% position:6%
- There is an entire world
of people that you know

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:19.712
that I don't know are alive.

00:01:19.745 --> 00:01:20.680
- Yep, yep.

00:01:20.713 --> 00:01:22.315
- And people that we all know

00:01:22.348 --> 00:01:23.716
and think are incredibly famous

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:24.517 align:start size:97% position:3%
- That I'm just like,
- that you've never heard of.

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.185
- [Sarah] Yes.

00:01:26.218 --> 00:01:27.820
- So I was like, I want
to throw out some names

00:01:27.853 --> 00:01:29.722
and see if you know
if they're a person.

00:01:29.755 --> 00:01:31.691
Have you ever heard
of Helen Mirren?

00:01:31.724 --> 00:01:33.159
- No.

00:01:33.192 --> 00:01:34.360
- You've never heard
the name Helen Mirren?

00:01:34.393 --> 00:01:35.528 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I've never heard
the name Helen Mirren.

00:01:35.561 --> 00:01:37.230 align:start size:84% position:16%
It's like, usually,
I'll tell you

00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:42.201
- What do you think
Helen Mirren does?

00:01:42.234 --> 00:01:43.703
- She sounds like an actor.

00:01:43.736 --> 00:01:44.570 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Okay.
- Good, good, good, good.

00:01:44.603 --> 00:01:45.838
- Like sketch or comedy.

00:01:45.871 --> 00:01:46.739
- Why do you want to say that?

00:01:46.772 --> 00:01:47.573
- [Hélene] Skits or comedy.

00:01:47.606 --> 00:01:49.208
- Jennifer Lawrence.

00:01:49.241 --> 00:01:50.743
- Oh yes, of course.

00:01:50.776 --> 00:01:52.211
- Okay I was like, that
could maybe even... okay.

00:01:52.244 --> 00:01:53.212
- Wait, I have another one.

00:01:53.245 --> 00:01:54.881
Do you know who Steve Carell is?

00:01:54.914 --> 00:01:55.715
- Yes, I've heard his name.

00:01:55.748 --> 00:01:57.216
I don't know who he is.

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:58.417
I couldn't, If you
showed me his face,

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:59.352 align:start size:84% position:16%
I wouldn't know,
but I know his name.

00:01:59.385 --> 00:02:00.553 align:start size:72% position:28%
- Wow.
- That's cool.

00:02:00.586 --> 00:02:01.854 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Do you know who
Timothée Chamalet is?

00:02:01.887 --> 00:02:02.688
- No.

00:02:02.721 --> 00:02:04.290
- Chamalet?

00:02:04.323 --> 00:02:04.924
- [Hélene] Is that
not how you say it?

00:02:04.957 --> 00:02:05.658
- Take a lap, take a lap.

00:02:05.691 --> 00:02:07.260
- Do you know
- what is it?

00:02:07.293 --> 00:02:09.929 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Do you know who
Timothée Chalamet is?

- Yeah, I do.
(everyone everyone laughs)

00:02:10.596 --> 00:02:12.365

00:02:12.398 --> 00:02:13.733 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Now, give us people,
see if we know of anybody.

00:02:13.766 --> 00:02:15.268
- Oh, see, okay...

00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:15.902
KSI.

00:02:15.935 --> 00:02:17.470
(concise no)

00:02:17.503 --> 00:02:18.437
- What's that?

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:19.539
- A radio station.

00:02:19.572 --> 00:02:20.439
- David Dobrik.

00:02:20.472 --> 00:02:21.407
- No.
- No.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.542
- No?

00:02:22.575 --> 00:02:23.709
- It's not as fun this way.

00:02:23.742 --> 00:02:24.443 align:start size:84% position:16%
- (everyone laughs)
This is cute.

00:02:24.476 --> 00:02:25.945
- Okay, wait.

00:02:25.978 --> 00:02:27.046
One more time, one more time.
- It's more fun the other...

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:27.914
- Yeah, we see what we did
to you, and we're sorry.

00:02:27.947 --> 00:02:28.581
- Liza Koshy.

00:02:28.614 --> 00:02:29.949
(concise no)

00:02:29.982 --> 00:02:31.150 align:start size:84% position:16%
- You've never
heard of Liza Koshy?

00:02:31.183 --> 00:02:32.652 align:start size:97% position:3%
She's getting really into more
like mainstream right now.

00:02:32.685 --> 00:02:33.619 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Liza Koshy is
your Helen Mirren.

00:02:33.652 --> 00:02:34.854
- What does a YouTuber do?

00:02:34.887 --> 00:02:36.289
- Hélene, we can't...

00:02:36.322 --> 00:02:37.256
(everyone laughs)

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:38.658
- We're not, we're not...

00:02:38.691 --> 00:02:39.926 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Will they make scripted
stuff, or do they...

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.861 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Just for the record,
we're not that bad.

00:02:41.894 --> 00:02:46.265
♪ 'Cause I think it's cool. 

00:02:46.298 --> 00:02:49.435
♪ My brother's gay
and that's okay. ♪

00:02:49.468 --> 00:02:50.636
- So I remember like

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:52.371 align:start size:84% position:16%
right when we were
starting the shooting,

00:02:52.404 --> 00:02:53.773 align:start size:97% position:3%
they were like, 'Yeah, so
we just need like 200 photos

00:02:53.806 --> 00:02:55.641
of you in your childhood,'
and I was like, 'Oh God.'

00:02:55.674 --> 00:02:57.977
And like, videos too,
and I was like, 'Oh no,

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.745
'I'm gonna have to like
watch a bunch of videos

00:02:59.778 --> 00:03:01.347
'that make me sad.'

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:02.949 align:start size:94% position:6%
So I got a bunch of
them, and they were like,

00:03:02.982 --> 00:03:04.650
'Hey, do you mind
if we reach out

00:03:04.683 --> 00:03:06.552
'to some of your Facebook
friends from high school.'

00:03:06.585 --> 00:03:08.387
- Yeah, sorry.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:09.622
- I was just kind of like
'Oh yeah, those people

00:03:09.655 --> 00:03:11.791
'I haven't talked to
in like ten years.'

00:03:11.824 --> 00:03:12.992
- [Chris] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:03:13.025 --> 00:03:14.660 align:start size:84% position:16%
Let's reach out to
them, but it was like.

00:03:14.693 --> 00:03:16.362 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Yeah, we just
sort of need photos

00:03:16.395 --> 00:03:17.663
from anyone you've ever met
at any point in your life.

00:03:17.696 --> 00:03:19.532
Ever, that's all.

00:03:19.565 --> 00:03:20.633 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Yeah, I actually
reconnected with some people,

00:03:20.666 --> 00:03:23.302
and I was like, 'Hey, I'm
on a show now, and I'm,

00:03:23.335 --> 00:03:26.539
'Do you have any photos of
me being weird at parties?'

00:03:26.572 --> 00:03:28.874
- If this keeps happening,
why do you keep showing up?

00:03:28.907 --> 00:03:31.310
- Because one time out of ten
it really is a dying girl,

00:03:31.343 --> 00:03:32.878
and if you don't show
up, it's bad optics.

00:03:32.911 --> 00:03:34.847
And P!nk doesn't do bad optics.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.985 align:start size:84% position:16%
She does near constant
aerial gymnastics.

00:03:39.018 --> 00:03:40.119 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Okay, I don't want to insult
any of my fans here, but...

00:03:40.153 --> 00:03:43.990 align:start size:97% position:3%
So I had a fan, I don't
know, it was this one girl,

00:03:44.023 --> 00:03:45.458
and she was being
really extreme,

00:03:45.491 --> 00:03:47.827
and in the DMs, she was
like, 'Case, I'm dying,

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.495
'you need to...'

00:03:49.528 --> 00:03:51.330 align:start size:94% position:6%
And she was saying all
this really serious stuff,

00:03:51.363 --> 00:03:52.999
and so then we went into it.

00:03:53.032 --> 00:03:55.001 align:start size:84% position:16%
Because she was
doing it for months.

00:03:55.034 --> 00:03:56.535 align:start size:84% position:16%
She was like, saying
she's gonna die

00:03:56.568 --> 00:03:58.537
and that if I didn't do
anything, she would die.

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:59.805
- Jeez, yeah.

00:03:59.838 --> 00:04:01.507 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Case] It was very
serious and sad.

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.876
And so I was concerned,
so eventually I was like,

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:05.544
I'm not going to send
her flowers to, like,

00:04:05.577 --> 00:04:07.813
someone who I don't even know
is real or actually dying.

00:04:07.846 --> 00:04:09.682 align:start size:84% position:16%
So we ended up
calling the hospital

00:04:09.715 --> 00:04:12.518 align:start size:84% position:16%
and seeing if the girl
was actually dying.

00:04:12.551 --> 00:04:14.420
Then, a couple weeks later,
we found the photo online

00:04:14.453 --> 00:04:15.488
that she had posted.

00:04:15.521 --> 00:04:17.056
- Oh.

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:18.424 align:start size:81% position:19%
- She searched up,
like a disease,

00:04:18.457 --> 00:04:19.892 align:start size:84% position:16%
and then took a
photo of a young girl

00:04:19.925 --> 00:04:20.860
and put it on her page.

00:04:20.893 --> 00:04:22.061
- That is so disgusting.

00:04:22.094 --> 00:04:23.062
- It's bad, yeah.

00:04:23.095 --> 00:04:23.896 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Whoa.
- [Chris] That's crazy.

00:04:23.929 --> 00:04:25.665
- Yeah, it was pretty...

00:04:25.698 --> 00:04:26.899
- And that became Brooke's
storyline in this episode.

00:04:26.932 --> 00:04:28.968 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Thank you so much
for a great storyline.

00:04:29.001 --> 00:04:30.369
- Yeah!

00:04:30.402 --> 00:04:31.737 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Dear ChaseDreams, I've
been in the hospital

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.973 align:start size:84% position:16%
for seven weeks and
it's not looking good.

00:04:34.006 --> 00:04:35.408
Could you send me a t-shirt?

00:04:35.441 --> 00:04:36.976
You're my favorite singer ever.

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:39.045
Love, Rachel Klein.

00:04:39.078 --> 00:04:40.046
- Poor girl.

00:04:40.079 --> 00:04:42.682
Such terrible taste in music.

00:04:42.715 --> 00:04:44.083
- I wrote to Nutella.

00:04:44.116 --> 00:04:45.217 align:start size:81% position:19%
(everyone laughs)
- Oh boy.

00:04:45.251 --> 00:04:49.422 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I wrote them, I was like,
"Hello, I love Nutella,

00:04:49.455 --> 00:04:51.924 align:start size:84% position:16%
this is the greatest
product ever.

00:04:51.957 --> 00:04:55.394 align:start size:84% position:16%
Thank you so much
for all that you do."

00:04:55.427 --> 00:04:56.929 align:start size:88% position:13%
And they sent me coupons
for free Nutella.

00:04:56.962 --> 00:04:58.597
- Whoa.

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.599 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Then when they sent me free
coupons, I was like, Hmm.

00:05:00.632 --> 00:05:02.468
So I wrote, like,
Ben &amp; Jerry's...

00:05:02.501 --> 00:05:04.036
- [Sarah] Yeah, then you
were like, This works.

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:05.671
- [Chris] For sure, for sure.
- Like, where are my coupons?

00:05:05.704 --> 00:05:08.107
- I remember I waited in line
at the mall for four hours

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:09.608
to meet Candace Cameron.

00:05:09.641 --> 00:05:10.576
- To meet who?

00:05:10.609 --> 00:05:11.744
- Candace Cameron.

00:05:11.777 --> 00:05:12.945
- We have to go.

00:05:12.978 --> 00:05:13.879 align:start size:84% position:16%
- You don't know
who that is, do you?

00:05:13.912 --> 00:05:15.514
- I don't know who that is.

00:05:15.547 --> 00:05:16.081 align:start size:97% position:3%
I'm like trying to remember,
there's a lot of people.

00:05:16.114 --> 00:05:16.949
- She was on Full House.

00:05:16.982 --> 00:05:18.351
- She's on Fuller House.

00:05:18.384 --> 00:05:18.985
- (everyone laughs) Oh,
she's on Fuller House.

00:05:19.018 --> 00:05:20.052
- Is she on Fuller House?

00:05:20.085 --> 00:05:21.787
- She's the mom on Fuller House!

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:22.955
F*** it.

00:05:22.988 --> 00:05:23.923 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Hélene] Oh my God!
(everyone laughs)

00:05:23.956 --> 00:05:24.957
- Okay, that's all, that's all.

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.891
- That's all the time we have.

00:05:25.924 --> 00:05:27.026
This was a rough episode.

00:05:27.059 --> 00:05:29.095 line:0%
(upbeat music)
