00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:04.990
&gt;&gt;Ian: Hello, and welcome to the Friday review
of games.

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:06.620
As always I'm your host.

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:07.620
Ian Ni-Lewis.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.840
And with me today is our special guest Steven
Spielberg.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.990
&gt;&gt;Dan: [laughs] Thank you very much.

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:18.230
Dan Galpin here as always to help out with
playing the games that you see here online.

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.980
And giving you guys a lot of great feedback.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:27.340
Thanks a lot as always for nominating the
games to our Moderator.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.340
And today we are gonna be doing driving games.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.340
Which areó

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.769
&gt;&gt;Ian: Absolutely, driving games which are
actually some of my favorite games.

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:36.699
But I had never really played them on Android.

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:41.170
I played Fortza, the entire Fortza series
on my Xbox.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.000
Actually started out with Project Gotham racing.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000
&gt;&gt;Dan: Absolutely.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.469
&gt;&gt;Ian: Actually did some work on Project Gotham
Racing III.

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.390
Fixed their sound.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.890
Well fixed the Xbox so it could play their
sounds.

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:51.890
&gt;&gt;Dan: Exactly.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.629
&gt;&gt;Ian: So love these games.

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:54.629
Lots of great titles.

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.440
But before we get started, wanted to make
some special mentions today.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.540
In the studio with us we have our new engineer.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:01.540
Engineer Dan.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:02.540
&gt;&gt;Dan: Mm-hm.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:03.540
&gt;&gt;Ian: The other Dan.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:04.540
Dan Fam.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:05.540
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.130
&gt;&gt;Ian: and producer Reto Meier.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:08.880
So can you introduce yourselves guys.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.500
&gt;&gt;Dan F: Hey you guys.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.500
This is Daniel Fam.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.500
Just wanted to say hi.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.500
&gt;&gt;Reto: And this is Reto.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.500
And you may know me better from the Android
App clinic.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.500
Which is on immediately before.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:25.330
And I'll be keeping an eye on all of the live
streams and hopefully passing any questions

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.490
you have straight on to the guys behind the
desk.

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:28.490
&gt;&gt;Ian: Absolutely.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:29.610
Now let's see the producer cam.

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.880
&gt;&gt;Dan G: That was the idea.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.210
It's to show the producer cam.

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.210
Alright.

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:35.210
&gt;&gt;Ian: We got the producer cam guys?

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:36.210
&gt;&gt;Reto: hit Hangout.

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.310
On the loweró

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.860
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Ah, there we are.

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:40.860
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yep.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.329
&gt;&gt;Reto: Second from the top--

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.710
&gt;&gt;Ian: There you go.

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.479
&gt;&gt;Reto: No, not that one.

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.479
No

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.619
&gt;&gt;Dan G: No, we're getting good though.

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:51.619
Absolutely.

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:52.619
Awesome.

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:53.619
&gt;&gt;Reto: Try it again.

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:54.619
[laughter]

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:55.619
&gt;&gt;Ian: That's not it either.

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:56.619
But.

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:57.619
Oh, oh oh, now, yah, yah.

00:01:57.619 --> 00:01:58.619
One more step.

00:01:58.619 --> 00:01:59.619
There we go.

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:00.619
&gt;&gt;Reto: Hi!

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:01.619
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Alright.

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:02.619
&gt;&gt;Ian: Alright.

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:03.619
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Producer cam.

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:04.619
Excellent.

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:05.619
&gt;&gt;Ian: Whoo-hoo!

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:06.619
Everybody was complaining.

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:07.619
They said why don't you hire a professional.

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:08.850
And we did.

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.540
So you can just stop complaining now.

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.310
From now on the show's gonna be great.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.300
&gt;&gt;Dan G: That's right.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.319
It's gonna suck less.

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:18.849
I really like that like that.

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:19.849
&gt;&gt;Ian: Alright.

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:23.760
So as far as sucking less goes, why don't
we go ahead and open up some liquid humor.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.569
&gt;&gt;Dan G: [laughs] Oh wow, this is a big bottle.

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:27.930
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.629
Well, you know it is a double chocolate stout.

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:34.280
So today we're drinking Irondale Double Chocolate
Stout.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.040
From, uh, I have no idea actually.

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.040
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Yeah.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.040
&gt;&gt;Ian: Swanton Rea's.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.040
Apparently.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.099
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Yeah, brewed in bottle by Hermitage
Brewing Company in San Jose.

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:43.099
So there we are.

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:44.099
&gt;&gt;Ian: Beautiful.

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:45.099
So this is local.

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:46.099
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Yeah, that's fantastic.

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:47.890
&gt;&gt;Ian: Even though it's got a label, it's
all like, I don't know, English-y or something.

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.050
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Absolutely.

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.050
&gt;&gt;Ian: Whoa.

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.050
Well, well.

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:52.050
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Exactly.

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.050
There we are.

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:54.470
&gt;&gt;Ian: There you go.

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:55.640
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Excellent.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:56.799
Thank you sir.

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:57.959
[bottle cap clinks]

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.830
&gt;&gt;Ian: Alright, although apparently we are
limited in the amount of time we can show

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:02.830
what we're drinking.

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.049
Because after a few number of seconds.

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:08.440
The Man considers it a beer commercial.

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.440
[laughter]

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.460
&gt;&gt;Dan G: I'm still wondering who The Man is.

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.900
&gt;&gt;Ian: Well in this case the man is our boss
Billy.

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:14.900
Hi Billy!

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:15.900
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Hi Billy.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:16.900
&gt;&gt;Ian: So alright.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.750
Let's go ahead and talk about some games.

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.260
Who do you wanna look at first Dan?

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.019
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Alright well I've got two games cued
up here.

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:25.210
We're actually gonna try a little bit of a
different tack this time.

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.579
We have two Transformer Prime's rather than
one.

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:31.640
And the first game I wanted to look at was
Real Racing.

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:32.700
&gt;&gt;Ian: Absolutely.

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:33.700
Whoa.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:34.700
Whoa.

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.810
You're, I mean you're really, you're gonna
make it hard for anybody to follow this, OK?

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:38.810
&gt;&gt;Dan G: I know.

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:39.810
I know.

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:40.810
This game is awesome.

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:41.810
I mean.

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.490
&gt;&gt;Ian: OK, let's go ahead and take a look
at it.

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:44.629
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Let's do one.

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:45.629
Let's do Courier.

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:46.629
I'm gonna do easy.

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:47.629
&gt;&gt;Ian: Alright.

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:50.120
&gt;&gt;Dan G: "Are you sure you wanna do easy?"

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.120
Yes.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.120
&gt;&gt;Ian: Very easy.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.120
OK.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.700
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Let's bring up the camera on that.

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:00.079
So here we are with Real Racing and we'll
start off with our club division.

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:02.480
This is exactly how you begin the game.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:10.180
And Real Racing is from Firemint Studios down
in Australia.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:15.880
And they really have I think set the bar for
realistic graphics on a racing game.

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:16.880
&gt;&gt;Ian: Right.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.019
&gt;&gt;Dan F: Camera two.

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.060
&gt;&gt;Dan G: And alright, we hit the home key.

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.060
&gt;&gt;Ian: Nice.

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.060
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Yes.

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.060
&gt;&gt;Ian: Well let's see how they recover from
that.

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.060
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Exactly.

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.400
&gt;&gt;Ian: See, that was totally planned.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.400
&gt;&gt;Dan G: That was our first test.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.400
Right.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.400
Exactly.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.400
Or it's possible that it died.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.400
Hopefully.

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.400
Oh.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.400
Come on.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.400
Come on.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.650
Fingers crossed.

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.490
That's what's great about doing a live program.

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.640
[sucks in breath] Ooooohhh.

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:40.640
Man.

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:41.640
Alright, so first thing.

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:42.640
&gt;&gt;Ian: OK, So.

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.110
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Checking the license every single
time you run.

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.110
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:46.110
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Oh.

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:47.110
Sad.

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:48.110
&gt;&gt;Ian: You might also do that.

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.930
And the main reason is because you might be
somewhere where you can't get network connectivity.

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:57.590
So have a license policy that lets you check
the license intermittently.

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:02.090
And if you don't get it, if you don't get
a contact with the license server for a couple

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.200
times, it's not a big deal.

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.229
Most people aren't gonna be able to contact
the license server every single time they

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:09.229
play.

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:12.889
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Yeah, the server manager that we
have built into you know the license servers.

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:13.960
That's the way to go.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.830
It, you know we actually think that it makes
a lot of sense.

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:22.250
That people can still get their license and
yet play the game on a plane or something

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:23.250
like that.

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:24.250
&gt;&gt;Ian: Right.

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:25.250
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Let's try a quick race instead.

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:26.250
Let's see how we do.

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:27.250
&gt;&gt;Ian: Sure.

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:30.340
Go easy on the camera two there, hot shot.

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:34.110
&gt;&gt;Dan G: [laughs] Exactly.

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:36.270
So and now we're at the exciting loading screen
agaaaaaain.

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.150
&gt;&gt;Ian: I love this loading screen man.

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:39.990
But you know, but look at this.

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:41.070
It's cool.

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:45.440
I mean, obviously you know, you're always
gonna have constraints with a mobile device.

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:53.710
Mobile devices have power and heat and battery
and size constraints that a full console or

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.550
desktop computer don't have.

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:01.259
But with all that considered, its' a really
nice looking game, I mean they've done all

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:05.200
of the interstitials and the hide and everything.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:06.759
Just like I remember on my Xbox.

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:07.759
It's great stuff.

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:10.860
&gt;&gt;Dan G: And you can actually, one thing that's
not easy to figure out is you can actually

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.440
change the view here.

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:18.280
And you'll notice, you know you actually would
think that you would get a higher frame rate

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.009
when the full HUD was up.

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:21.009
But actually you don't.

00:06:21.009 --> 00:06:22.009
Andó

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:23.009
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah, show that again.

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:24.759
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Yeah, here's our different views.

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:26.099
Here's our full screen.

00:06:26.099 --> 00:06:27.099
There's our front.

00:06:27.099 --> 00:06:28.099
And there's with the.

00:06:28.099 --> 00:06:30.139
&gt;&gt;Ian: and what's the problem here, Dan?

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:31.139
Whyó

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:36.360
&gt;&gt;Dan G: And the theory that I have, and I
haven't thrown this one through all of my

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:37.360
tools.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:42.080
Is that in fact if you notice the out, the
border of the HUD actually has some translucency

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.080
on it.

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.630
You can see the outside of those windows.

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:49.169
And so my theory is that they're actually
drawing this HUD last in order to get that

00:06:49.169 --> 00:06:50.890
a little bit of transparency.

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:54.490
And what they probably should be doing is
drawing just the translucent parts of the

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:55.620
HUD last.

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:57.759
And actually drawing the rest of the HUD first.

00:06:57.759 --> 00:07:01.650
'cause you'll actually see the frame rate
is just killer when it's not there.

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:02.819
&gt;&gt;Ian: Right, they probably can't see it.

00:07:02.819 --> 00:07:05.020
Because I don't think we can capture video
for YouTube

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:06.020
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Yeah.

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:07.830
&gt;&gt;Ian: At the highest frame rate this device
can put out.

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:09.770
But take it, take Dan's word for it.

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:14.070
Because Dan has sort of a fifth sense when
it comes to frame rate.

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:16.490
&gt;&gt;Dan G: [laughs] No, it looks amazing.

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:19.720
And actually I've found that I really love
playing it this way.

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:23.639
I actually get a sense of speed playing at
full screen without the HUD.

00:07:23.639 --> 00:07:25.350
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah, that's some nice texture down
there.

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:26.350
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Yeah, it's beautiful.

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:32.289
You can even see on the road, what I love
is that they're using a beautiful job with

00:07:32.289 --> 00:07:33.289
filtering there.

00:07:33.289 --> 00:07:34.289
And you can see MIT mapping.

00:07:34.289 --> 00:07:38.830
That texture is just beautifully mit mapped
so that when it's close it does not look blurry

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:45.450
and when it's far away it is not clogging
down the GP with lots of extra drawing.

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:48.630
And so you know, I mean this really is just
kind of a boiler plate of how to put the game.

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:50.979
Even when you see these buildings that we
pass by.

00:07:50.979 --> 00:07:56.690
The textures might be a slightly bit blurrier
but we have such a great feeling of speed

00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:58.990
and the frame rate is high enough that we
donít' even notice it.

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:03.520
And even little things like the effects of
the sun flaring on the windshield.

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:06.400
I mean it's just beautifully, beautifully
done.

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:10.730
And the, the other optimizations or changes
you can make are pretty simple.

00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:14.160
You can turn on and off the HUD if you wanna
have just, be that much more immersive.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:17.720
Now it's interesting, this game actually does
not have a back button on the screen.

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:18.720
Which is awesome.

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.290
You actually have to hit the back key to get
here.

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:26.349
And you can actually go and change in the
settings to go and say that I don't want to

00:08:26.349 --> 00:08:29.759
have the heads up display.

00:08:29.759 --> 00:08:31.669
And now we can actually go back.

00:08:31.669 --> 00:08:37.900
And again it's all driven using the standard
Android navigation system which is cool.

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:42.080
And so now there we have, we're really just
full screen which is kind of awesome.

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:45.270
Like just being able to get to this view I
think is supper killer.

00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:46.650
The other thing is that they don't have an
accelerator.

00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:48.390
All we can do is brake.

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:50.890
We brake by tapping the screen.

00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:51.890
And it is actuallyó

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:55.360
&gt;&gt;Ian: You can actually put it into a mode
where you need to both accelerate and brake.

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:56.360
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Mm-hmm.

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:57.490
&gt;&gt;Ian: Which can be nice actually.

00:08:57.490 --> 00:09:01.630
I prefer it that way because I like to slide
around corners

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:02.630
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Yeah.

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:03.850
&gt;&gt;Ian: By just decelerating a bit.

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:09.420
But I think they made the right choice as
far as making it easy to jump in and play.

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:10.420
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Yes.

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:11.690
&gt;&gt;Ian: There's a lot of assists on.

00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:13.290
Which is why Dan is doing so well.

00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:14.290
&gt;&gt;Dan G: [chuckles] Yes.

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:15.290
I'm in easy mode.

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:17.110
&gt;&gt;Ian: Why don't you play this game with the
assists off?

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:18.520
Show 'em what it feels like.

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:19.520
&gt;&gt;Dan G: OK.

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:21.840
&gt;&gt;Ian: Uh, just go into your settings andó

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:25.890
&gt;&gt;Dan G: OK, let's get back into settings.

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:26.890
Dah.

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:27.890
Dah.

00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:28.890
And under, uhó

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:29.890
&gt;&gt;Ian: Settings.

00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:30.890
Yeah.

00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:32.410
&gt;&gt;Dan G: So I can't change to "difficult"
from here.

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:33.410
I'd have to restart.

00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:34.990
&gt;&gt;Ian: Oh, you'd have to restart the race.

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:35.990
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Yeah, exactly.

00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:38.570
So that was what I was afraid of.

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:41.460
But yeah, the game really just have a great
sliding scale.

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:43.880
But if you wanna just jump into it it's great
too.

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:44.880
There's nothing that prevents you.

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:49.140
And again as you're looking at this freeze
frame you can just see how high quality that

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:50.140
road texture is.

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:51.830
&gt;&gt;Ian: yeah, let me take a look at that actually.

00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:56.400
So this is, um, like you really see what'só

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:57.410
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Yeah, the MIT mapping right there
in the center of the screen.

00:09:57.410 --> 00:10:02.150
&gt;&gt;Ian: Well, what's really amazing is that
they've actually done a good job of simulating

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:03.150
an ISO.

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:04.150
&gt;&gt;Dan G: yes.

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:05.750
&gt;&gt;Ian: I don't think they're actually doing
an ISO 'cause I don't think this hardware

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:08.380
can do it at that level.

00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:10.090
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Yes.

00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:16.260
&gt;&gt;Ian: For a lot of MIT map stuff you'll actually
see sort of a line you know, about, let's

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.860
say an inch from the bottom of the screen
you'd actually see it turn really blurry.

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:24.490
Or get some you know, just visual artifacts
and general other [inaudible]

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:25.490
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Hm.

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:26.670
The attention to detail is awesome on this
game.

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:32.750
So yeah, so this game also was originally
released as essentially a free demo that was

00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:33.750
unlockable.

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:36.580
And this version is now the premium version.

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:38.170
And it's totally worth it.

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:41.250
For 99 cents it's an absolute steal.

00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:47.720
And if you like racing this game really does
have the best visceral feel I think of any

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:48.720
racing game.

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:52.350
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah, so really I think the only thing
we're saying about it is, if you're going

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:58.100
to paste a big ass HUD on your screen [Dan
chuckles] do it first so that these parts

00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:00.020
can z-reject pretty fast.

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:01.320
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Mm-hm.

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:07.640
&gt;&gt;Ian: And there are no mobile chips that
are really good at overdraw.

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:13.970
No Android GPU is going to be happy with tons
and tons of overdraw.

00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:15.060
So just don't do it.

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:19.570
The one thing that I'm missing in this game
and, it's actually in every game that we've

00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:20.570
looked at.

00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:21.570
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Mm-hmm.

00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:22.570
&gt;&gt;Ian: I'm really missing good damage.

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:23.570
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Yeah.

00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:24.570
&gt;&gt;Ian: And I don't see why not.

00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:28.950
I think the hardware is perfectly capable
of running a damage model.

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:30.240
A simple one.

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:35.460
I'm actually because nobody has it, especially
the two Gameloft games I'm looking at, I'm

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:36.960
actually wondering if they couldn't get the
license.

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:38.180
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Well that's what I was wondering
too.

00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:39.310
You have to get a specialó

00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:40.310
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah, damage license.

00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:41.310
So that is, yeah.

00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:43.550
&gt;&gt;Dan G: But real cars in this game are beautifully
rendered.

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:48.580
It's again, it is the real car game, the real
car racing game on Android.

00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:50.060
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah, and it is tough.

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:51.290
&gt;&gt;Dan G: It is tough.

00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:52.780
Especially if you're in easy mode.

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:54.660
But it is nice the easy mode for people who
just wanna drive.

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:55.660
So I'm going to switch over.

00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:57.190
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah, as a contrast.

00:11:57.190 --> 00:12:02.850
This one, I would call this next one, "Forza
III meets Mario Kart".

00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:06.570
&gt;&gt;Dan G: [laughs] So we're now looking at
Asphalt 7.

00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:10.120
Let's, and I switched the tablets so we can
make a very very very fast switch.

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:11.420
These are big big games.

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:12.420
&gt;&gt;Ian: Whoo!

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:14.990
&gt;&gt;Dan G: So I'm gonna let Ian play on this
one.

00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:16.650
&gt;&gt;Ian: Oh, ok you're gonna cue up the next
one?

00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:18.060
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Yeah, I'm gonna cue up the next one.

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:19.060
&gt;&gt;Ian: OK.

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:24.780
So for this one, the game mechanics are similar
in a lot of ways and since we're, it's another

00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:28.120
one of these games where you start with a
little bit of money.

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:30.400
And that's gonna let you buy a car.

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:35.560
And then you're gonna compete in races for
more cars and more upgrades and things like

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:36.560
that.

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:37.560
&gt;&gt;Dan G: There we are.

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:38.560
We've switched.

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:39.560
Now we're really on Asphalt 7: Heat. [laughs]

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:40.560
&gt;&gt;Ian: Nice.

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:41.560
Alright.

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:42.700
&gt;&gt;Dan G: So, yeah.

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:47.320
And so this is using, is what is not a free
title.

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:48.320
This is a paid title.

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:50.470
But it's a 99 cent title as well.

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:54.150
And it's, it is very playable without additional
purchases.

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:58.030
But it does strongly encourage you to spend
additional money on the game.

00:12:58.030 --> 00:12:59.030
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:00.410
Well, you're gonna grind a lot to get more
stars.

00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:01.410
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Mm-hmm.

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:04.020
&gt;&gt;Ian: And in fact you're gonna pay a lot
to get more stars too.

00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:05.020
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Yeah.

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:10.890
&gt;&gt;Ian: So I noticed, for instance, so the
first thing you get which is your little tiny

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:13.410
Fiat Abarth?

00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:14.410
I guess.

00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:15.760
I don't actually know how to say that.

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:19.580
But this is like the entry level car for every
racing game ever.

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:21.990
[Dan laughs] You wanna go up a level.

00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:23.140
To a range rover.

00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:24.140
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Mm-hmm.

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:29.050
&gt;&gt;Ian: Or even just a Mini Cooper S. That's
gonna cost you 30 stars.

00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:33.230
Now 30 stars is like ten or 15 bucks actually
in there.

00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:34.230
&gt;&gt;Dan G: is it really?

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:35.230
Wow.

00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:36.230
&gt;&gt;Ian: It's quite a lot.

00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:37.230
Let's see.

00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:38.230
Get more stars.

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:39.770
Um, yeah, yep, there you go, ten bucks.

00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:41.020
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Yeah.

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:44.530
&gt;&gt;Ian: Or you get one or two stars per race.

00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:45.530
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Mm.

00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:48.280
&gt;&gt;Ian: So you can see, you're gonna grind
a lot in this game.

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:51.120
I mean, these are not cheap.

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:55.930
So but you know, aside from that it's actually
really fun.

00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:58.490
The races themselves are a good time.

00:13:58.490 --> 00:13:59.500
I'm gonna go andó

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:04.160
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Mm. and you know to be honest, as
long as you can grind in the game, I think

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:06.600
it's actually kinda fun and does give it sort
of an RPG element.

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:10.990
And I think that's actually kind of a not
entirely a bad thing.

00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:11.990
In terms of this.

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:12.990
&gt;&gt;Ian: yeah.

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:15.520
And you've got this interesting thing where
you like pay 5,000 for a sponsor.

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:17.960
Which is a little weird 'cause I thought the
sponsor would pay you.

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:19.420
&gt;&gt;Dan G: I pay you, I know.

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:20.420
[laughs]

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:21.420
&gt;&gt;Ian: OK, fine.

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:22.420
They've got some goals here.

00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:26.770
They've got a little bit of a style system.

00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:27.790
Like Project Gotham used to have.

00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:28.790
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Mm-hmm.

00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:34.330
&gt;&gt;Ian: Where you get some extra points for
doing things like drifting and getting air.

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:35.330
[pause]

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:36.330
Mmm.

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:39.630
And they also have some really beautiful interstitials.

00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:42.990
&gt;&gt;Dan G: They absolutely do.

00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:46.550
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah, it's very professional.

00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:48.820
It's exactly the kinda thing you'd expect.

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:52.851
Now once again, this is a very simple game.

00:14:52.851 --> 00:14:55.080
I think it is an auto accelerator.

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:59.130
You have to, if you wanna brake you have to
hit the screen.

00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:01.100
But they have a nitro bonus system.

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:02.730
Because of course they do right?

00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:05.240
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Yeah, which is that's the Mario Kart
element.

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:09.880
And actually just to point out there are many
many control schemes for Asphalt 7.

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:10.880
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:12.490
&gt;&gt;Dan G: So you can use tap on the screen.

00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:13.550
You can use Virtual Wheel.

00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:16.210
There's just tons and tons of different ways
you can set youró

00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:17.210
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:18.210
You control.

00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:23.290
But I tell you, especially with the newer
Android tablets having a significant improvement

00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:24.290
in--Whoa!

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:25.500
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Nice.

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:26.500
Air.

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:34.670
&gt;&gt;Ian: Significantly improved their gyroscope
and accelerometers, so you can get the attitude

00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:37.360
sensor to work really really well.

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:39.690
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Now I'll tell you a couple things
about this games.

00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:42.260
One of them is, this game actually has shortcuts
in the races.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:45.000
Which are totally fun, there's a lot of stuff
to find.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.560
There's far more than just one route through
any of the individual races.

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:53.690
My only complaints about this game are really
that, you'll see that if you look at the quality

00:15:53.690 --> 00:15:55.770
of it, if you hit the pause key actually so
we can take a look at one of these frames.

00:15:55.770 --> 00:15:56.770
&gt;&gt;Ian: Oh.

00:15:56.770 --> 00:15:57.770
&gt;&gt;Dan G: you can't actually look at the frame
I guess.

00:15:57.770 --> 00:15:58.770
&gt;&gt;Ian: Can you pause?

00:15:58.770 --> 00:16:00.690
&gt;&gt;Dan G: I guess you can't.

00:16:00.690 --> 00:16:01.690
I thought you could.

00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:02.690
Anyways.

00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:04.020
&gt;&gt;Ian: Oh, here we go.

00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:05.230
&gt;&gt;Dan G: No.

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:06.230
No.

00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:07.360
&gt;&gt;Ian: No, you can't just pause.

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:08.740
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Yeah.

00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:14.910
Anyway, you can see if you look down, the
quality of the road just is not anywhere near

00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:16.860
what Real Racing is putting out.

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:19.130
And if you look at the vegetation going by.

00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:22.080
You can see that the stuff that's near the
camera is really really pixilated.

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:23.080
&gt;&gt;Ian: Right.

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:25.300
But you never notice that because you're going
too damn fast.

00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:26.300
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Right.

00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:27.300
Exactly.

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:28.300
Also from a frame rate perspective.

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:29.300
&gt;&gt;Ian: [shouting at game]

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:32.510
&gt;&gt;Dan G: it is not, we're not getting consistently
high frame rates.

00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:33.510
It's pretty good.

00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:36.680
I mean, this is definitely, but I think that
there's aó

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:38.110
&gt;&gt;Ian: It doesn't bother me.

00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:40.310
And actually if you play it on, like I played
it on the Nexus 7, I never noticed a frame

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:41.600
rate problem at all.

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:42.600
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Yeah.

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:47.420
&gt;&gt;Ian: Of course, I don't have your supernatural
skill in judging frame rates.

00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:48.540
&gt;&gt;Dan G: So it is interesting.

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:51.291
So this one I did actually throw into perf
HUD to take a look at it.

00:16:51.291 --> 00:16:55.860
And I was actually going to do sort of an
interactive perf HUD view on the show today

00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:56.860
but I think tható

00:16:56.860 --> 00:16:57.860
&gt;&gt;Ian: No, but Dan chickened out.

00:16:57.860 --> 00:16:58.860
Trying toó

00:16:58.860 --> 00:16:59.860
&gt;&gt;Dan G: I did.

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:00.860
I chickened out.

00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:04.980
But partially because it wasn't interesting
enough with this sort of game play.

00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:10.060
But I, one thing that is interesting is you'll,
on this game you'll notice the cars are drawn

00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:12.190
last.

00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:13.700
And so we areó

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:14.700
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:15.700
Um. [inaudible]

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:17.910
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Which is a little unfortunate cause
it is taking up a large chunk of the screen.

00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:19.360
&gt;&gt;Ian: Well, for the player's car.

00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:20.360
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Yes.

00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:23.830
&gt;&gt;Ian: You'd probably wanna draw the other
things last, well, of course.

00:17:23.830 --> 00:17:26.510
This is something that is, oh yeah, check
it out.

00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:27.580
I'm in adrenaline mode!

00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:28.580
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Aaaaaaa!

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:29.580
&gt;&gt;Ian: Who!

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:30.580
Knock down!

00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:31.580
&gt;&gt;Dan G: So.

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:33.430
&gt;&gt;Ian: So adrenaline mode is like you're in
Tron mode.

00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:34.650
You can do no wrong.

00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:35.650
It's awesome.

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:37.520
I have no idea how I even got there.

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:38.600
&gt;&gt;Dan G: [chuckles]

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:39.600
&gt;&gt;Ian: Ooooh.

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:40.600
Wrecked.

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:41.600
Now see that's my problem.

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:42.600
I just wrecked.

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:44.370
My car is completely smashed up.

00:17:44.370 --> 00:17:45.520
But it looks perfect.

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:46.520
Why?

00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:47.520
Why?

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:48.520
Did Fiat make you do that?

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:50.150
&gt;&gt;Dan G: [chuckles] It's very possible.

00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:51.150
Um.

00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:53.170
&gt;&gt;Ian: So, the yeah.

00:17:53.170 --> 00:17:58.920
In generally what you wanna do is draw your
foreground elements first.

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:03.670
So that you can take advantage of hierarchical
z.

00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:08.090
And in this case what you probably wanna do,
you know for a racing game, is you can assume

00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:11.550
that the players car is always gonna be in
the foreground.

00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:13.990
Anything else is probably not worth it.

00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:16.250
The other cars are almost never in the foreground.

00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:17.250
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Yeah.

00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:19.750
You really see when you see the vegetation
on the left hand side of the screen where

00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:20.750
we're going now.

00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:22.320
That's where you really see the quality.

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:24.310
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah, I think that's a textural density
issue.

00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:25.310
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Yeah.

00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:27.680
&gt;&gt;Ian: They just aren't loading up big enough
textures.

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:30.200
Um, although, you know, they have a lot of
varied textures.

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:31.200
&gt;&gt;Dan G: They do.

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:36.400
&gt;&gt;Ian: and for the areas of the track that
are father away it's actually very well done.

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:37.400
I think.

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:38.400
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Yes.

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:39.400
Absolutely.

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:41.380
I just think there's probably one level of
MIT mapping that's missing.

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:42.380
&gt;&gt;Ian: Right.

00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:43.380
&gt;&gt;Dan G: And tható

00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:48.260
&gt;&gt;Ian: Well and knowing the game development
process I wouldn't be surprised if that level

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:51.460
was created and then thrown away at the last
minute in order toó

00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:52.460
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Yeah.

00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:55.170
Very possible and you can also see there is
a bit of popup going on.

00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:56.170
If you look at that in the distance.

00:18:56.170 --> 00:18:57.170
And--

00:18:57.170 --> 00:18:58.170
&gt;&gt;Ian: yeah, I did notice some popup.

00:18:58.170 --> 00:18:59.170
And that's an issue.

00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:02.420
And it's actually a little bit surprising
considering for instance, this particular

00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:05.730
GPU is really excellent at geometry.

00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:06.730
&gt;&gt;Dan G: yes.

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:08.440
&gt;&gt;Ian: compared to its pixel performance.

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:14.550
You actually probably get more out of pushing
your far z plane out a little bit but you

00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:15.550
know.

00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:16.550
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Yeah.

00:19:16.550 --> 00:19:17.550
When youó

00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:18.550
&gt;&gt;Ian: That's not gonna be the right choice
for everyone.

00:19:18.550 --> 00:19:24.330
&gt;&gt;Dan G: And also that is only good if you're
drawing in the reverse draw.

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:27.490
If you're drawing in order you're going to,
by pushing your z plane out you're still gonna

00:19:27.490 --> 00:19:29.290
have some pretty big performance problems.

00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:31.260
&gt;&gt;Ian: Well, if you're going back to front.

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:32.260
Right.

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:33.260
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Yeah.

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:34.260
If you're going, if you're goingó

00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:35.260
&gt;&gt;Ian: Which you should never do.

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:36.260
Right?

00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:37.260
I mean.

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:38.260
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Exactly.

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:39.260
&gt;&gt;Ian: I mean drawing your stuff back to front
is always the wrong choice unless you have

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:40.260
to do Alpha.

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:44.830
What you should be doing is just like these
guys here is you should be drawing that alpha

00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:45.850
area last.

00:19:45.850 --> 00:19:47.220
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Mm-hmm.

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:48.220
Absolutely.

00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:51.200
So that's just basically something that everyone
needs to look at.

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:52.930
That being said, this game is totally fun.

00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:53.930
&gt;&gt;Ian: Absolutely.

00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:55.780
&gt;&gt;Dan G: And that's, and it is beautiful looking.

00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:56.780
&gt;&gt;Ian: It's a kick.

00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:57.780
Andó

00:19:57.780 --> 00:19:58.780
&gt;&gt;Dan G: I just wanna see it that much better.

00:19:58.780 --> 00:19:59.780
Like that's--

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:00.780
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:01.780
I really do too.

00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:04.110
And I would love to see more you know, some
more collisions.

00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:05.440
Some more particles.

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:12.180
My guess is that the very top end of Android
devices, especially tablets could handle more

00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:13.270
than what we're seeing here.

00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:14.270
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Mm-hmm.

00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:18.740
&gt;&gt;Ian: I would love, I would pay extra to
get let's say a Tegra optimized version or

00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:19.740
this.

00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:20.740
Or a tablet optimized version of this.

00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:21.740
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Mm-hmm.

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:22.740
Yeah.

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:24.200
&gt;&gt;Ian: To play around with 'cause I think
this game could be even cooler than it is.

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:25.200
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Totally.

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:26.200
Totally.

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:27.200
And you know.

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:32.100
Just interestingly enough, hitting the back
key multiple times just gets us out to the

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:33.100
menu.

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:34.100
Kind of the way we'd like.

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:35.100
They've done a good job of making the navigationó

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:36.100
&gt;&gt;Ian: Mm-hmm.

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:37.100
Yeah, the navigation is great.

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:39.930
&gt;&gt;Dan G: And boom, we're back out.

00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:40.930
&gt;&gt;Ian: Perfect.

00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:41.970
&gt;&gt;Dan G: So that's that.

00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:45.180
Let me see, I was gonna try to cue up the
next game on this tablet.

00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:47.430
And we'll see if I actually managed to do
that.

00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:48.430
&gt;&gt;Ian: OK.

00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:50.900
Before we start the next game I think Producer
Reto has something to say.

00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:51.900
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Oh, exactly.

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:52.900
He is on the screen.

00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:53.900
So.

00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:54.900
&gt;&gt;Reto: Exactly.

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:55.900
Thanks guys.

00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:57.280
So just a couple comments on YouTube and on
the G plus stream.

00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:02.710
So Leif points out that Asphalt 7 does notification
spam, and after not playing it for a few days.

00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:04.400
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Ooooh.

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:05.520
&gt;&gt;Ian: Oh.

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:07.850
How many people don't do notification spam?

00:21:07.850 --> 00:21:14.920
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Now the real question is actually
whether or not you can actually turn off notifications?

00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:15.920
&gt;&gt;Ian: Right.

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:18.540
&gt;&gt;Dan G: And right away Game Loft assures
me that it's actually, the game is intended

00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:19.770
to be playable offline.

00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:24.480
If for some reason, you saw that network errors
occur, we tried cancel.

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:25.480
They say that's a bug.

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:31.070
&gt;&gt;Ian: So what we're asking people to do now
is, OK, we understand that some people like

00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:32.070
notifications.

00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:38.240
We don't know who those people are, but apparently
some people do like notifications.

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:45.670
What we want to do is make sure that users
who don't want notifications or even users

00:21:45.670 --> 00:21:49.590
who do want notifications but they don't want
all of them, have the ability to control that.

00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:55.630
Now of course we added new features to Jellybean
to make it easier to control the kinds of

00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:58.310
notifications that you get from different
apps.

00:21:58.310 --> 00:21:59.780
But that's sort of an all or nothing thing.

00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:00.780
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Mm-hmm.

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:01.780
Yeah.

00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:02.850
&gt;&gt;Ian: You can say "This app is never allowed
to make, to send me notifications" or "This

00:22:02.850 --> 00:22:03.850
app is allowed."

00:22:03.850 --> 00:22:10.060
Now me personally, I don't mind being told
for instance that there is a massive sale

00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:13.360
on some in-app item of a game I like.

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:18.520
But I do hate personally, I do hate those
notifications that are like "You haven't played

00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:20.090
me in a while.

00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:21.090
Why don't you come back?"

00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:22.090
I mean.

00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:23.090
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Yeah.

00:22:23.090 --> 00:22:24.440
&gt;&gt;Ian: If I wanted somebody whining at me
about coming to play, I'd play GTA4.

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:25.440
[laughter]

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:27.250
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Yeah, no exactly.

00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:30.160
And actually one of the things I was looking
for, and I didn't actually check this game

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:31.160
before we started.

00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:34.150
And I was looking to see if there was a way
to disable that within the game.

00:22:34.150 --> 00:22:35.890
Doesn't look like there is.

00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:40.030
We strongly encourage developers to make that
something they can turn off.

00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:41.930
And 'cause a lot of users prefer it.

00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:45.910
Now it's interesting, on one of the other
Game Loft games if you turn off notifications,

00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:49.801
every single time you start up the game it
pops up a dialog and says "Hey, you realize

00:22:49.801 --> 00:22:51.130
you've turned off notifications?

00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:52.170
Would you like to turn them on?"

00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:53.170
&gt;&gt;Ian: Wow.

00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:54.170
That's like iTunes bad.

00:22:54.170 --> 00:22:56.950
"Hey I noticed I'm not your default game player
for this machine?

00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:58.350
Would you like to change that?"

00:22:58.350 --> 00:22:59.350
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Yeah.

00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:00.350
[chuckles]

00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:01.350
&gt;&gt;Ian: Come on.

00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:02.350
&gt;&gt;Dan G: So.

00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:05.400
&gt;&gt;Ian: There will come a day when a, those
people will be the first up against the wall.

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:09.850
But even before that there will come a day
when that is no longer considered feature-worthy.

00:23:09.850 --> 00:23:15.330
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Yeah, we really wanna make sure the
user experience is, and addressing the user

00:23:15.330 --> 00:23:19.860
concerns are the number one priority for developers.

00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:22.760
And you know, we understand that notifications
are useful.

00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:24.650
There's a lot of game players who actually
really like them.

00:23:24.650 --> 00:23:27.670
And certainly on a lot of the games or resource
management is an issue.

00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:29.540
Or their daily bonuses.

00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:30.540
That's really awesome.

00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:34.840
You know like, playing Dungeon Hunter and
going "Hey man, there's like if I play today

00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:37.191
I have an opportunity to get 5,000 gold for
doing this."

00:23:37.191 --> 00:23:39.970
That's kinda cool as long as I can turn it
off.

00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:40.970
&gt;&gt;Ian: Right.

00:23:40.970 --> 00:23:42.990
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Well we do have the other game, do
you wanna go on?

00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:43.990
Or are there other questions.

00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:44.990
&gt;&gt;Ian: Reto maybe had one more question.

00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:45.990
&gt;&gt;Reto: There is, there's one more.

00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:48.730
So this is an actual question, a programming
question from Alex.

00:23:48.730 --> 00:23:49.730
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Right.

00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:50.730
OK.

00:23:50.730 --> 00:23:51.730
&gt;&gt;Reto: On G plus stream.

00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:55.420
And he says "You guys always say to pay attention
to the resolution of the art aspects within

00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:57.390
games so that they don't look blurry or overstretched."

00:23:57.390 --> 00:23:58.390
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Mm-hmm

00:23:58.390 --> 00:24:02.220
&gt;&gt;Reto: "I'd like to know what you think of
pixel art style of graphics.

00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:08.860
Do you think it's ok to do all the art on
a canvas of say 400 by 240 height with pixel

00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:09.950
art style?"

00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:13.980
He's asking because pixel art looks nice when
stretched but it's all messed up when shrunken.

00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:18.280
And that goes against standard best practices
on game art where you obviously have higher

00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:20.880
res assets and then shrink them down.

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:24.470
Although making two separate groups of the
artwork both big and small seems to be a better

00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:27.990
option it's not practical 'cause it's going
to take too many resources.

00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:33.470
&gt;&gt;Ian: Well, remember that the reason it looks
bad when it' shrunk is because we're doing

00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:35.680
the scaling very quickly.

00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:41.520
And it's usually, for instance OpenGL just
implements a bi-linear filtering which isn't

00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:42.520
very good.

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:46.850
Now, if you run your art through something
like Photoshop and it does a Lanczos filter

00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:49.480
on it, you're gonna get art that looks pretty
much great.

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:50.840
&gt;&gt;Dan G: yeah, exactly.

00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:51.890
I wouldn't worry too much about that.

00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:56.600
You also actually can actually go into bitmap
factory you can set the options for higher

00:24:56.600 --> 00:25:00.700
quality scaling as well.

00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:03.510
Within the actually scaling of the bitmaps
and that.

00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:04.700
That may help you out as well.

00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:09.620
But the truth is, yeah, my feeling is high
resolution pixel art looks amazing.

00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:10.750
&gt;&gt;Ian: Mm-hmm.

00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:15.340
&gt;&gt;Dan G: And the games we saw, if you looked
at the last weeks show we were doing tower

00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:16.340
defense games.

00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:18.330
We saw some amazing high res pixel art.

00:25:18.330 --> 00:25:24.090
That just, that looked mind blowingly good
on these devices and actually scale down reasonably

00:25:24.090 --> 00:25:25.090
well.

00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:26.090
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:27.880
&gt;&gt;Dan G: So I think it comes down to art design
and style.

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:31.760
There definitely are outlying pixel art really
doesn't scale very well.

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:35.390
If you're trying to have lots and lots of
really delicate line details, those are gonna

00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:36.890
get lost alot of the time.

00:25:36.890 --> 00:25:37.890
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:25:37.890 --> 00:25:38.890
You need to do that.

00:25:38.890 --> 00:25:39.890
&gt;&gt;Dan G: But it reallyó

00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:42.450
&gt;&gt;Ian: Well, and you know who does actually
very careful line drawing?

00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:43.450
Is Rovio.

00:25:43.450 --> 00:25:44.450
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Mm-hmm.

00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:45.450
Absolutely.

00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:49.510
&gt;&gt;Ian: and they actually put a lot of effort
into making sure that at every single resolution

00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:52.530
the blackout line around the birds is exactly
one pixel wide.

00:25:52.530 --> 00:25:53.530
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Yeah.

00:25:53.530 --> 00:25:55.220
And they're very good about that.

00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:57.790
And so I think it's certainly possible.

00:25:57.790 --> 00:26:01.190
It's more of an art design question I think
than a technical question when it comes to

00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:02.190
that.

00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:06.380
&gt;&gt;Ian: I think a lot of people will do something
in pixel art thinking that's actually gonna

00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:07.380
be easier.

00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:08.380
And it's not.

00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:12.210
Doing pixel art well and making it look great
on a modern device and also appealing to modern

00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:14.200
users is actually really tough.

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:17.080
Because you want it to be old school but you
don't actually want it.

00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:18.080
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Actually want itó

00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:19.170
&gt;&gt;Ian: To be old school.

00:26:19.170 --> 00:26:25.960
You want it to be evocative rather than representative
of your limitations.

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:27.059
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Absolutely.

00:26:27.059 --> 00:26:29.670
But I mean we certainly love pixel art.

00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:35.300
We've given major thumbs up to a lot of pixel
art titles in terms of you know what we, the

00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:36.300
presentation.

00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:40.890
And I think the real key thing is just again,
like anything else, it all depends on the

00:26:40.890 --> 00:26:44.540
quality of your artist as much as anything
else.

00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:45.540
And your design.

00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:46.540
Andó

00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:47.540
&gt;&gt;Ian: Absolutely.

00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:48.540
So.

00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:52.920
Producer Reto, I have to ask, was, so is that
HPC2000 guy on the live chat?

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:55.770
&gt;&gt;Reto: I haven't seen any questions from
him yet.

00:26:55.770 --> 00:26:56.770
&gt;&gt;Ian: OK.

00:26:56.770 --> 00:26:58.900
Yeah, he was gonna ask you a question about
open gl.

00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:00.580
I told him I'd answer it.

00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:02.320
But I'm not gonna answer it if he's not watching.

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:03.320
'Cause come on.

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:04.320
&gt;&gt;Reto: Exactly.

00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:05.320
I will keep an eye out.

00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:06.700
I will let you know if he is actually here.

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:07.700
&gt;&gt;Ian: Sounds good.

00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:08.700
Let's go ahead and move to our next game.

00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:12.350
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Alright, so our next game isn't really
a driving game.

00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:13.460
It would be aó

00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:14.960
&gt;&gt;Ian: Is there driving in this game?

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:15.960
&gt;&gt;Dan G: There is driving.

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:16.960
&gt;&gt;Ian: There is a lot of driving in this game.

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:17.960
&gt;&gt;Dan G: It isn't really a racing game.

00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:18.960
I should say.

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:19.960
&gt;&gt;Ian: That's true.

00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:20.960
We didn't say racing.

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:21.960
&gt;&gt;Dan G: It is a driving game.

00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:22.960
&gt;&gt;Ian: we said "driving."

00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:23.960
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Did we?

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:24.960
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yes.

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:25.960
&gt;&gt;Dan G: OK.

00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:26.960
&gt;&gt;Ian: And the only thing that we put off
limits was golf, as I recall.

00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:27.960
&gt;&gt;Dan G: That's true.

00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:30.559
We said that it was not that kind of driving.

00:27:30.559 --> 00:27:32.260
[laughs] So here we are.

00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:33.820
It is GTA.

00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:36.570
They've done a great job of bringing it to
Android.

00:27:36.570 --> 00:27:38.630
It controls very very well.

00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:43.870
I actually really like the fact that the default
set of controls is actually tapping the screen.

00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:44.870
Rather than accelerometer.

00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:49.420
I think it works really well for the kind
of arcade-y style of driving that is in the

00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:50.460
game.

00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:53.450
And so you know, since it is a driving game
we're doing to hit the car.

00:27:53.450 --> 00:27:56.300
Now there are a lot of on screen buttons in
this game.

00:27:56.300 --> 00:28:01.540
And I would say a lot of that is because it
wasn't really designed for this kind of system.

00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:06.300
I think if you were designing it today, you
would not have nearly as many button actions

00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:07.310
as this game has.

00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:10.500
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah, this is definitely more of a
port than a remix.

00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:12.490
I think it's not reallyó

00:28:12.490 --> 00:28:15.820
&gt;&gt;Dan: Wow, am I driving badly.

00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:19.800
&gt;&gt;Ian: It's not really re-imagined for tablet,
it's just totally ported.

00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:24.760
So you know what this plays awesomely with
is like a Nyko controller or an Xbox 360 controller.

00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:26.510
Plug into the USB port.

00:28:26.510 --> 00:28:31.420
&gt;&gt;Dan: And it's great, this port that if you're
on an Android 3.x device or you're on something

00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:36.400
like the Xperia Play 3.x or higher device
they really do a great job of making sure

00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:37.910
those are there for you guys.

00:28:37.910 --> 00:28:41.740
But other than that they did a very good job
of porting the game and the graphics over.

00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:45.670
&gt;&gt;Ian: You know where I played this is, I
met with the Wikipad guys.

00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:46.670
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Oh yeah.

00:28:46.670 --> 00:28:48.850
&gt;&gt;Ian: You might have seen Wikipad online.

00:28:48.850 --> 00:28:51.480
They were at GDC.

00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:57.340
And they handed me a prototype and it was
playing GTA three and I'm like, wow.

00:28:57.340 --> 00:29:03.430
It's a completely new experience to be able
to play that on tablet with a controller that's

00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:04.430
built in.

00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:06.350
Do I'm hoping that we see more of those.

00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:10.290
And there's several that, Wikipad, Nyko's,
there's one other I can't remember.

00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:11.940
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Yeah, Moga is also doing it.

00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:12.940
&gt;&gt;Ian: Moga.

00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:14.131
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Yeah, it's got a pretty cool controller
andó

00:29:14.131 --> 00:29:17.670
&gt;&gt;Ian: And of course we support USB controllers.

00:29:17.670 --> 00:29:20.000
Basically any USB controller that Linux supports.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.490
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Yeah and Bluetooth as well.

00:29:21.490 --> 00:29:23.280
So USB and Bluetooth controllers.

00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:26.450
You know, there's really gonna be a lot of
choice out there.

00:29:26.450 --> 00:29:29.110
Let's run into a few more trees here in Grand
Theft Auto.

00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:32.380
So what we're gonna say about this other than
it's a port done well.

00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:37.150
I would love to see a more native version
designed for touch controls.

00:29:37.150 --> 00:29:40.160
I think that you could take it really really
far.

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:43.750
But they've done about as good a job as you'd
expect to do given where they started with

00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:46.170
a fairly complicated joystick interface.

00:29:46.170 --> 00:29:47.820
Nice, my car is on fire.

00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:50.140
And Iím in the first, I'm in training mission.

00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:51.140
Um.

00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:53.900
&gt;&gt;Ian: This is just, it's a fun game.

00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:54.900
What more to say?

00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:55.900
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Yeah, exactly.

00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:56.980
&gt;&gt;Ian: Let's not waste any more time.

00:29:56.980 --> 00:29:57.980
They did a good job.

00:29:57.980 --> 00:30:00.540
Oh, but there is actually one thing that's
unique about this game.

00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:01.540
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Um-hm.

00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:02.540
&gt;&gt;Ian: If they still have it.

00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:03.570
They still have the persistent notification?

00:30:03.570 --> 00:30:04.570
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Yes.

00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:07.010
They do, they just kind of whack you with
that.

00:30:07.010 --> 00:30:10.170
So if we go to the home screen you'll see
that it actually lets you know whether it's

00:30:10.170 --> 00:30:14.120
still running and allows you to get back to
the game right away.

00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:15.770
I don't know how exactly I feel about this.

00:30:15.770 --> 00:30:18.160
'Cause things do run in the background and
that's the expectation.

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:20.990
&gt;&gt;Ian: I know, I know, I am so torn about
this.

00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:27.180
Because on the one hand, it violates a lot
of the philosophy that we have around Android.

00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:31.660
On the other hand, it's done for such a good
reason.

00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:36.050
Because basically everything that we've done
around Android is for a completely different

00:30:36.050 --> 00:30:37.050
use case.

00:30:37.050 --> 00:30:38.050
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Yes.

00:30:38.050 --> 00:30:39.050
Andó

00:30:39.050 --> 00:30:43.809
&gt;&gt;Ian: and the use case of having something
that is really really big, and really really

00:30:43.809 --> 00:30:48.540
expensive to initialize, but also something
that you might wanna interrupt every now and

00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:51.370
then to let's say, get a phone call.

00:30:51.370 --> 00:30:52.370
It's tough.

00:30:52.370 --> 00:30:54.200
So they've done something interesting.

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:56.270
They basically say, OK we're gonna run all
the time.

00:30:56.270 --> 00:31:00.500
But instead of just doing that, which is horrible,

00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:01.500
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Yeah.

00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:04.420
&gt;&gt;Ian: They put up a persistent notification
that says essentiallyó

00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:06.630
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Our process is still in memory.

00:31:06.630 --> 00:31:07.630
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:31:07.630 --> 00:31:11.720
GTA III is sitting here taking up resources
and draining resources so you can go back

00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:12.720
to it fast.

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:13.880
Do you want it to stop that?

00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:14.880
&gt;&gt;Dan G: It is, yeah.

00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:16.030
It is actually not draining your battery.

00:31:16.030 --> 00:31:17.780
But it is still resident in memory.

00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:18.780
&gt;&gt;Ian: Mm.

00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:19.780
Well.

00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:20.780
&gt;&gt;Dan G: So it doesn't actually keep the game
running.

00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:21.780
The threads areó

00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:22.780
&gt;&gt;Ian: The threads are stopped.

00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:26.299
But it will end up making things harder for
you.

00:31:26.299 --> 00:31:28.160
You know, there will be more swapping out.

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:32.590
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Yeah, I mean ultimately Android will
kill the process if you try to run too much

00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:33.590
stuff.

00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:34.590
And we should actually just try that.

00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:38.510
Let's try to launch Real Racing and see what
happens.

00:31:38.510 --> 00:31:41.630
Now I'm, testing fade here.

00:31:41.630 --> 00:31:44.170
We're obviously running two enormous titles.

00:31:44.170 --> 00:31:48.950
What should happen is we should see GTA get
kicked out of memory.

00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:50.240
Always gonna do these things live.

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:51.240
[chuckles]

00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:52.240
&gt;&gt;Ian: Let's see what happens.

00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:53.240
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Exactly.

00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:58.660
&gt;&gt;Ian: Well my point is that it's not consuming
CPU, but it is gonna consume the battery because

00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:02.750
what's gonna happen is that small wraps are
gonna cycle in and out faster.

00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:03.799
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Yes.

00:32:03.799 --> 00:32:08.260
And the thing is, once it gets kicked out
it should just be kicked out.

00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:11.850
It doesn't get kicked back in unless they're
actually running a service.

00:32:11.850 --> 00:32:12.950
And hopefully they're not doing that.

00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:13.950
&gt;&gt;Ian: Well they are running a service.

00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:16.290
They've got a persistent notification, it's
really hard to tell.

00:32:16.290 --> 00:32:17.290
&gt;&gt;Dan g: yeah, I actuallyó

00:32:17.290 --> 00:32:20.700
&gt;&gt;Ian: You're gonna have to go out of here
and then go back into GTA and see what the

00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:21.700
[inaudible]

00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:22.760
&gt;&gt;Dan g: Yeah, well you see the notification
is still there.

00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:23.760
So it'só

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:26.160
&gt;&gt;Ian: well that's true but that doesn't really
mean anything 'cause all that means is their

00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:27.230
service is still alive.

00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:29.080
It doesn't necessarily mean their main processor
is.

00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:30.950
&gt;&gt;Dan g: Yeah, let's take a look at what happens.

00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:31.950
Boom.

00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:32.950
There we are.

00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:33.950
&gt;&gt;Ian: Wow.

00:32:33.950 --> 00:32:34.950
Well you know.

00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:36.970
&gt;&gt;Dan G: So we had, this takes a lot of ram.
[laughs] So.

00:32:36.970 --> 00:32:38.620
&gt;&gt;Ian: well that's true.

00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:44.120
&gt;&gt;Dan G: And anyways, again it is possible
to swap between two rather large games.

00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:47.570
I donít think I wanna push it and actually
swap between more than that.

00:32:47.570 --> 00:32:51.370
But there we are with Real Racing as well.

00:32:51.370 --> 00:32:52.370
So.

00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:53.370
Awesome.

00:32:53.370 --> 00:32:54.420
Nice multitasking going on there.

00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:57.590
&gt;&gt;Reto: Couple of quick points from YouTube.

00:32:57.590 --> 00:33:01.429
Crispy Core wants to know if you can try and
see if the tilt controls work while driving.

00:33:01.429 --> 00:33:04.000
He asked that just a couple of minutes ago
so I'm guessing that's for GTA.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.430
&gt;&gt;Dan g: The tilt controls for GTA?

00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:07.940
&gt;&gt;Reto: There seems to be a lot of problems
with that.

00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:14.270
&gt;&gt;Dan g: I think there may be an issue and
as I recall this is one of those games that

00:33:14.270 --> 00:33:19.690
actually has I think accelerometer issues.

00:33:19.690 --> 00:33:22.870
So let's turn accelerometer on.

00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:24.140
And let's use take analog.

00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:26.110
&gt;&gt;Ian: Use analog steering yeah.

00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:28.429
&gt;&gt;Dan g: Analog steering.

00:33:28.429 --> 00:33:30.310
&gt;&gt;Ian: And turn that on.

00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:31.310
OK.

00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:32.310
&gt;&gt;Dan g: OK.

00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:33.310
And lets' take a look.

00:33:33.310 --> 00:33:39.350
As I recall, this may have been one of those
games that actually does not correctly, we

00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:42.309
look at the default orientation when interpreting
the accelerometer.

00:33:42.309 --> 00:33:48.110
But I think as I recall, and it's been a while,
I think they do it correctly for tablets.

00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:49.860
And they may not do it correctly for--.

00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:53.830
&gt;&gt;Ian: so that may actually be something the
type of device instead ofóso what'll happen

00:33:53.830 --> 00:34:03.760
is the orientation is always done with respect
to a default orientation of the device.

00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:10.510
You know, in other words, which orientation
the home screen expects to display in. and

00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:14.080
that's not always what the game expects.

00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:17.169
Ironically, this isn't very difficult to deal
with.

00:34:17.169 --> 00:34:22.129
Where people get into trouble is when they
try to figure out what the default orientation

00:34:22.129 --> 00:34:23.830
is.

00:34:23.830 --> 00:34:28.500
And then figure out what the accelerometer
is telling them rather than just believing

00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:30.570
the quaternion they can get from the accelerometer.

00:34:30.570 --> 00:34:33.990
&gt;&gt;Dan g: Yeah, the quaternion is actually
always going to be correct.

00:34:33.990 --> 00:34:36.500
And that's really the key here.

00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:38.300
But anyway, the tilt is working fine here.

00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:41.810
We should try it on a phone device and see
whether it's also handling that correctly.

00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:43.109
I shouldn't say phone.

00:34:43.109 --> 00:34:45.960
What I should say is a portrait default device.

00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:50.190
The real question is what happens on Nexus
7 here.

00:34:50.190 --> 00:34:53.800
So we can, I think I have it on this guy.

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:57.190
&gt;&gt;Ian: We'll cue that up and see if there's
another question while we're doing that.

00:34:57.190 --> 00:35:01.980
&gt;&gt;Reto: Exactly, so while Dan's getting that
going, HPC2000 is in fact here, so we would

00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:03.530
love to hear the answer to his question.

00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:04.530
So if you could repeat the question.

00:35:04.530 --> 00:35:05.530
&gt;&gt;Ian: Right.

00:35:05.530 --> 00:35:08.530
I believe the question was about how, oh,
boo.

00:35:08.530 --> 00:35:10.830
&gt;&gt;Dan g: Whoa.

00:35:10.830 --> 00:35:12.160
&gt;&gt;Ian: Look at that.

00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:14.510
I downloaded all these files last night.

00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:16.850
At least I thought I did.

00:35:16.850 --> 00:35:18.359
Maybe I didn't.

00:35:18.359 --> 00:35:26.750
HPC2000 asked, how easy is it to take an open
GLES game that's made for some other system.

00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:29.310
He named a system, I hadn't heard of it.

00:35:29.310 --> 00:35:30.310
&gt;&gt;Dan g: yeah.

00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:32.520
&gt;&gt;Ian: But whatever, use what you want.

00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:35.360
If you wanna port from another system, that's
an interesting question.

00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:37.680
I'll tell the truth.

00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:41.430
It's something that I think we have mixed
feelings about.

00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:45.140
And when I say we, I mean the Android organization
in general.

00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:48.380
We want people to bring all of the best content
on Android.

00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:52.350
At the same time, we don't want to just see
random crummy ports.

00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:55.340
We wanna see things that are built for Android.

00:35:55.340 --> 00:35:58.369
And for its unique abilities.

00:35:58.369 --> 00:36:04.170
So that said, it's not very difficult to port
and open GLES game that's written in C to

00:36:04.170 --> 00:36:05.170
Android.

00:36:05.170 --> 00:36:07.420
There are some issues.

00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:11.820
A lot of people think that since Android is
Linux, it should be very easy to port any

00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:13.300
piece of Linux software.

00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:15.390
And that's not entirely true.

00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:21.340
Because Android like all other Linux systems
is build out of a lot of different components.

00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:24.640
And there are some things you can pick and
choose in terms of the libraries, internal

00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:25.640
chains.

00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:28.710
We have a specific C runtime that we use called
bionic.

00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:32.220
That a lot of other people don't use.

00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:35.000
And all of this adds up to more hassle.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:41.650
Now, normally for a Linux system this isn't
a hassle because you use something like apt

00:36:41.650 --> 00:36:46.660
or you know, macports or one of these things
that compiles everything and runs through

00:36:46.660 --> 00:36:47.770
a bunch of compatibility scripts.

00:36:47.770 --> 00:36:51.730
And if you've ever used a port system, you
know that there's like a million different

00:36:51.730 --> 00:36:54.790
tasks to figure out where your C runtime lives.

00:36:54.790 --> 00:36:57.060
And where your pilot lives and all these other
things.

00:36:57.060 --> 00:36:58.340
Android of course doesn't do that.

00:36:58.340 --> 00:37:00.640
We distribute binaries to the phone.

00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:02.359
Or to the device.

00:37:02.359 --> 00:37:10.780
So you are not able to count on all of the
things that your desktop Linux system has.

00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:15.820
Or even all of the things that are in the
Android open source project right now.

00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:18.310
What we do instead is we release something
called the NDK.

00:37:18.310 --> 00:37:21.380
The native development kit.

00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:22.840
There's a lot of things in the NDK.

00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:28.150
But the real core of it, the irreplaceable
piece of it is a set of headers that form

00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:31.940
a contract that Google has decided we will
always fulfill.

00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:36.010
&gt;&gt;Dan g: Yeah, it has an NADI, an application
binary interface.

00:37:36.010 --> 00:37:41.089
And the key thing about that is that for your
open GL calls, those open GL calls will be

00:37:41.089 --> 00:37:43.480
essentially identical because open GL is a
standard.

00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:46.550
It actually provides a contracted ABI itself.

00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:47.920
And we're adhering to that contract.

00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:53.720
So from an open GL perspective all the open
GL code should port over incredibly easily.

00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:58.110
Obviously, if you're taking advantage of any
architecture specific implementation details,

00:37:58.110 --> 00:37:59.130
especially extensions.

00:37:59.130 --> 00:38:02.200
Those'll have to be looked at.

00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:06.770
But the vast majority of the open GL code
will run absolutely identically on both platforms.

00:38:06.770 --> 00:38:08.740
&gt;&gt;Ian: You will need to be aware of one thing
though.

00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:09.740
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Yes.

00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:15.180
&gt;&gt;Ian: Which is because Android is an open
system, there's a huge number of OEMs.

00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:21.859
You can't make as many assumptions about the
GPU hardware as you can with some other systems.

00:38:21.859 --> 00:38:22.859
&gt;&gt;Dan g: Absolutely.

00:38:22.859 --> 00:38:27.500
&gt;&gt;Ian: So even though the open GLES ABI is
standard, some of the extensions that you

00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:33.040
may have come to rely on or possibly some
of the behaviors or even bugs that you may

00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:37.900
rely on one system are not necessarily going
to be the same on other systems.

00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:43.280
A good example of that is that PVR GPUs do
geometry sorting.

00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:49.500
So they're almost completely insensitive to
the way you submit geometry.

00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:52.320
But they are very sensitive to how many state
transitions you do.

00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:53.320
&gt;&gt;Dan G: yes.

00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:55.480
&gt;&gt;Ian: Where as Tegra GTUs are almost the
opposite.

00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:59.710
They change state very fast but you want to
always sort front to back.

00:38:59.710 --> 00:39:04.540
&gt;&gt;Dan G: exactly and so the real key, and
that's certainly, it's only one issue.

00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:07.910
There's also things like if you wanna use
texture compression.

00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:09.650
You know, there is not a standard.

00:39:09.650 --> 00:39:10.650
&gt;&gt;Ian: Everybody's got their own thing.

00:39:10.650 --> 00:39:17.070
&gt;&gt;Dan G: High performance ones used on Android,
there's also you know, there are also issues

00:39:17.070 --> 00:39:20.910
in terms of how you should write your shaders.

00:39:20.910 --> 00:39:24.750
And you know, making sure that you're really
querying very carefully.

00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:29.490
Also making sure that you do test those shaders
on a variety of GPUs. 'cause you will see

00:39:29.490 --> 00:39:32.160
different performance cliffs from device to
device.

00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:37.000
That being said, from a coding perspective,
your code is going to, what you really have

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:40.450
to look at is audio 'cause the audio standards
are very very different.

00:39:40.450 --> 00:39:44.390
You're gonna look at touch and events which
are very very different.

00:39:44.390 --> 00:39:47.900
Networking actually if you're not using SSL,
you can just use sockets.

00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:51.430
And so your socket code will come over pretty
much straight, to be honest.

00:39:51.430 --> 00:39:54.740
So there's a lot you do get a lot.

00:39:54.740 --> 00:39:58.080
You can actually use even threading you can.

00:39:58.080 --> 00:39:59.450
If you're using standard p-threads.

00:39:59.450 --> 00:40:04.520
If you, as long as you're not relying on making
calls back into the Dalvik virtual machine

00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:06.550
you can actually use those very easily.

00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:10.760
Or you can actually tie those back into Dalvik
threads.

00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:15.869
And there's actually a really nice library
that Invidia has provided for doing that.

00:40:15.869 --> 00:40:20.380
So there really are a lot of things you can
do and really one of the main reasons we do

00:40:20.380 --> 00:40:28.730
the NDK is to allow people to take advantage
of tested code sections that you, code libraries.

00:40:28.730 --> 00:40:31.370
That you have a written for another platform.

00:40:31.370 --> 00:40:35.270
So from that perspective, that plus the standard
APIs do provide a really nice basis.

00:40:35.270 --> 00:40:36.270
Especially for games.

00:40:36.270 --> 00:40:40.800
Where it gets more challenging is when you
want to take advantage of the Android standard

00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:42.560
UI patterns.

00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:44.430
And those are, there's a lot of useful stuff
in there.

00:40:44.430 --> 00:40:46.900
Even if it comes to things like font rendering.

00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:48.210
Database storage isn't there.

00:40:48.210 --> 00:40:51.760
So if you wanna use databases you're gonna
have to make a call through JNI to getó

00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:53.300
&gt;&gt;Ian: Oh, no, no.

00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:55.109
You're gonna get to make a call through JNI.

00:40:55.109 --> 00:40:56.109
&gt;&gt;Dan G: [chuckles] That's right.

00:40:56.109 --> 00:41:01.920
&gt;&gt;Ian: Because remember the java interfaces
in Android are very very easy to use compared

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:03.140
to C and C++.

00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:05.450
There's' a lot fewer ways to shoot yourself
in the foot.

00:41:05.450 --> 00:41:08.240
You'll end up writing a lot less code.

00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:13.970
A good example of this is when you're doing
your game play, you know, every large scale

00:41:13.970 --> 00:41:19.300
C++ project that I've worked on has its own
resource management and reflection system.

00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:23.580
Which of course is built into Dalvik and into
the java framework.

00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:27.000
So you can actually save yourself a lot of
time.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.630
Especially when you're dealing with platform
specific things.

00:41:29.630 --> 00:41:33.770
But even when you're not, by going into Dalvik
or another virtual machine.

00:41:33.770 --> 00:41:34.770
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Absolutely.

00:41:34.770 --> 00:41:37.650
And there's plenty of places even in a game
where it makes a lot of sense to take advantage

00:41:37.650 --> 00:41:40.160
of Android framework resources.

00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:42.020
Things like notifications for example.

00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:44.070
You know, networking.

00:41:44.070 --> 00:41:48.190
It's just nice to take advantage of the built
in HTP stack.

00:41:48.190 --> 00:41:50.120
Built in SSL implementation.

00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:51.120
All that kinda stuff.

00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:56.450
So there is a bunch of stuff that it does
make sense to actually move code over to the

00:41:56.450 --> 00:41:57.730
Dalvik virtual machine.

00:41:57.730 --> 00:42:03.000
But that being said, for your core code, if
there's things like physics engines that may

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:04.920
be written entirely in native code.

00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:06.470
Things like box td.

00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:09.310
There's really no reason not to just use that
code as it is.

00:42:09.310 --> 00:42:10.950
If it's a well-tested bit of code.

00:42:10.950 --> 00:42:11.950
&gt;&gt;Ian: Absolutely.

00:42:11.950 --> 00:42:12.950
OK.

00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:13.950
I think that's enough on that.

00:42:13.950 --> 00:42:16.609
Producer Reto, are there any more questions?

00:42:16.609 --> 00:42:17.609
&gt;&gt;Reto: No.

00:42:17.609 --> 00:42:18.609
&gt;&gt;Ian: OK.

00:42:18.609 --> 00:42:19.609
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Excellent.

00:42:19.609 --> 00:42:20.609
[laughs] [inaudible]

00:42:20.609 --> 00:42:22.190
&gt;&gt;Ian: Well done on the producer cam.

00:42:22.190 --> 00:42:23.190
That isó

00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:25.750
&gt;&gt;Dan G: We're getting the hang of that today.

00:42:25.750 --> 00:42:26.750
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yes.

00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:27.750
Good job.

00:42:27.750 --> 00:42:28.750
&gt;&gt;Dan G: That's awesome.

00:42:28.750 --> 00:42:30.109
&gt;&gt;Ian: Now, we're running a little low on
time but something occurs to me which is that

00:42:30.109 --> 00:42:35.660
we did not actually go in order of what people
voted one today.

00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:36.660
&gt;&gt;Dan G: That's true.

00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:40.120
&gt;&gt;Ian: We sort of went in order of what we
personally thought was cool.

00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:45.460
Especially in order of these big profitable
games.

00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:46.460
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Yes.

00:42:46.460 --> 00:42:50.560
&gt;&gt;Ian: Which I think makes us look a lot like
tools of the game oligopoly establishment.

00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:56.850
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Well, and I will say that all of
these games really are fun, like these are

00:42:56.850 --> 00:42:57.850
great games.

00:42:57.850 --> 00:42:58.850
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah, absolutely.

00:42:58.850 --> 00:42:59.850
There's no question about that.

00:42:59.850 --> 00:43:00.850
&gt;&gt;Dan G: And they're beautiful.

00:43:00.850 --> 00:43:01.850
They make, they makeó

00:43:01.850 --> 00:43:02.850
&gt;&gt;Ian: But again, we don't wanna be tools.

00:43:02.850 --> 00:43:03.850
&gt;&gt;Dan G: No that's true.

00:43:03.850 --> 00:43:06.050
And actually I didn't, I would have added
Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit by the way, to

00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:07.420
this list, had I been a tool.

00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:10.720
Because I actually love Need for Speed: Hot
Pursuit.

00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:11.790
I have ever since it came out.

00:43:11.790 --> 00:43:13.540
&gt;&gt;Ian: I don't think it's a tool thing to
beó

00:43:13.540 --> 00:43:17.760
&gt;&gt;Dan G: And but I didn't nominate it to the
list because there were so many other big

00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:18.990
games on the list already.

00:43:18.990 --> 00:43:19.990
So let's--

00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:21.910
&gt;&gt;Ian: Well, my main point is, we need to
look at Tractor Digger.

00:43:21.910 --> 00:43:25.060
&gt;&gt;Dan G: So Tractor Digger is not actually
a racing game.

00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:26.060
&gt;&gt;Ian: It's not.

00:43:26.060 --> 00:43:27.310
&gt;&gt;Dan G: So I'm just going to bring it up
very very quickly.

00:43:27.310 --> 00:43:29.090
&gt;&gt;Ian: But it was voted number one.

00:43:29.090 --> 00:43:30.090
[inaudible]

00:43:30.090 --> 00:43:31.090
&gt;&gt;Dan G: It was voted number one.

00:43:31.090 --> 00:43:32.090
And it is built using AndEngine.

00:43:32.090 --> 00:43:34.920
&gt;&gt;Ian: and by the way you know who else is
a tool?

00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:37.060
Anybody who watches this show and doesn't
vote.

00:43:37.060 --> 00:43:38.530
Vote for stuff.

00:43:38.530 --> 00:43:43.740
&gt;&gt;Dan G: So this is actually a puzzle game
and your goal is to move things into the tractor.

00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:45.870
You've got a dual joystick control.

00:43:45.870 --> 00:43:51.070
And then we can actually take this stuff and
move it into this dumpster here.

00:43:51.070 --> 00:43:53.210
And it's actually pretty cool.

00:43:53.210 --> 00:43:55.280
It is not [chuckles] a racing game.

00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:56.960
&gt;&gt;Ian: We didn't say racing game.

00:43:56.960 --> 00:43:57.960
We said driving game.

00:43:57.960 --> 00:43:58.960
Are you driving?

00:43:58.960 --> 00:43:59.960
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Sort of.

00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:00.960
&gt;&gt;Ian: Are you driving a tractor?

00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:01.960
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Yes.

00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:03.300
&gt;&gt;Ian: I think you're driving a tractor.

00:44:03.300 --> 00:44:07.180
Um, now for some reason Dan is snapping his
fingers at us and I don't know why.

00:44:07.180 --> 00:44:09.670
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Ah, the reason why is that I don't
have this tablet plugged in.

00:44:09.670 --> 00:44:13.040
so let's actually show you what I was doing
rather than have me just looking down.

00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:14.680
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah, see that's why we look at the
monitor.

00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:15.740
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Yeah, exactly.

00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:16.740
&gt;&gt;Ian: And not the, yeah.

00:44:16.740 --> 00:44:17.740
&gt;&gt;Dan G: That's why we have that.

00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:18.740
That's a good point.

00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:19.740
So anyways, oh it's backwards though.

00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:20.740
That's really hard.

00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:21.740
[laughs] Never mind.

00:44:21.740 --> 00:44:23.380
&gt;&gt;Ian: Maybe just glance at it.

00:44:23.380 --> 00:44:24.380
But--[inaudible]

00:44:24.380 --> 00:44:25.780
&gt;&gt;Dan g: Yeah, exactly.

00:44:25.780 --> 00:44:31.369
So, um, so we can actually take advantage
of physics here to scoop up the rock into

00:44:31.369 --> 00:44:35.500
our little tractor and then we can actually
flip it all the way round to the other side

00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:37.050
in order to dump it back into the dumpster.

00:44:37.050 --> 00:44:38.220
But it is a puzzler game.

00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:39.220
And it's cool.

00:44:39.220 --> 00:44:40.220
You're driving a tractor.

00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:41.550
And it's something I haven't seen before.

00:44:41.550 --> 00:44:42.900
It's an AndEngine game.

00:44:42.900 --> 00:44:44.530
Which is always nice to see.

00:44:44.530 --> 00:44:50.090
If you haven't actually used AndEngine before
it is a really nice 2D game development platform.

00:44:50.090 --> 00:44:51.570
Written for Android.

00:44:51.570 --> 00:44:56.300
We actually have them showing off the tools
chain at Google IO this year.

00:44:56.300 --> 00:45:00.750
And it really does look, it looks nice.

00:45:00.750 --> 00:45:03.240
And they're doing a lot of investment in it.

00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:04.240
Which is exciting.

00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:06.760
Oh by the way, you're not trying to get the
boulders into the truck.

00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:07.760
Just.

00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:08.760
Uh.

00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:10.190
&gt;&gt;Ian: I did a good job of it though.

00:45:10.190 --> 00:45:11.609
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Yes you did, you did.

00:45:11.609 --> 00:45:12.609
Now, at the controls.

00:45:12.609 --> 00:45:15.590
The controls work well, there's definitely
some parts of this game where I want to see

00:45:15.590 --> 00:45:19.490
higher resolution artwork.

00:45:19.490 --> 00:45:22.060
Some more work done on some of the textures.

00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:26.270
So that it looks less this sort of repeating
pattern that you're seeing at the bottom.

00:45:26.270 --> 00:45:28.670
It just screams "I'm tiling something!"

00:45:28.670 --> 00:45:29.670
&gt;&gt;Ian: Right.

00:45:29.670 --> 00:45:33.240
The right way to do that by the way is to
create three or four random textures and just

00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:34.240
randomize them.

00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:35.240
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Yes.

00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:38.440
&gt;&gt;Ian: For a texture like this, you can use,
there's actually some photoshop plugins that

00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:39.440
do this.

00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:40.440
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Yeah.

00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:45.730
&gt;&gt;Ian: You get something that has four or
five different textures but they all tile

00:45:45.730 --> 00:45:47.320
seamlessly along the edges.

00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:48.320
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Mm-hm.

00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:50.340
&gt;&gt;Ian: And then you just pick 'em at random
and it looks really good.

00:45:50.340 --> 00:45:51.359
&gt;&gt;Dan G: It really does.

00:45:51.359 --> 00:45:53.290
And that same thing I would say with the grass
texture.

00:45:53.290 --> 00:45:55.000
It's just like, tile, tile, tile, tile, tile.

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:56.000
&gt;&gt;Ian: Exactly.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.270
&gt;&gt;Dan G: And I would love to see a little
bit of work.

00:45:58.270 --> 00:46:01.110
'cause there's so much work that actually
went into the vehicles in this game.

00:46:01.110 --> 00:46:02.230
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah, they're cool.

00:46:02.230 --> 00:46:05.070
And you know what, I dig the background in
this game even though it's just a photo.

00:46:05.070 --> 00:46:06.540
Its' nice that it's out of focus.

00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:07.540
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Yes.

00:46:07.540 --> 00:46:08.550
&gt;&gt;Ian: It's got that depth of field effect
to it.

00:46:08.550 --> 00:46:09.550
Good job there.

00:46:09.550 --> 00:46:10.550
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Yeah, absolutely.

00:46:10.550 --> 00:46:11.550
&gt;&gt;Ian: OK.

00:46:11.550 --> 00:46:12.550
Let's move on.

00:46:12.550 --> 00:46:13.550
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Let's move on.

00:46:13.550 --> 00:46:14.550
Again, not a, not a racing game.

00:46:14.550 --> 00:46:16.600
Another one that's in the category of somewhat--

00:46:16.600 --> 00:46:17.970
&gt;&gt;Ian: [whispering off mic]

00:46:17.970 --> 00:46:21.230
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Somewhat smaller games is Drag Racing
from Nitro Nation.

00:46:21.230 --> 00:46:22.230
&gt;&gt;Ian: I really like this game.

00:46:22.230 --> 00:46:26.090
&gt;&gt;Dan G: And um, this game was, is kind of
fun.

00:46:26.090 --> 00:46:36.070
but it really just seemed to be an exercise
in trying to end up getting me to buy stuff.

00:46:36.070 --> 00:46:37.070
Which was a little unfortunate.

00:46:37.070 --> 00:46:42.880
You know, its' like, what I found was that
pretty much no matter how well I did in the

00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:48.369
game, if I did not have a car that was good
enough and this was not an example of that.

00:46:48.369 --> 00:46:49.530
I was just going to lose.

00:46:49.530 --> 00:46:53.560
Mostly because it's just kind of minimal controls
here.

00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:56.070
And I actually played this game not particularly
well.

00:46:56.070 --> 00:46:57.230
I should actually be shifting.

00:46:57.230 --> 00:46:58.660
&gt;&gt;Ian: I was gonna say, you know.

00:46:58.660 --> 00:47:00.080
&gt;&gt;Dan G: See, you get good shifts.

00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:03.810
&gt;&gt;Ian: If you shift like a moron you're not
gonna get anything out of the race.

00:47:03.810 --> 00:47:06.820
&gt;&gt;Dan g: Yeah, but even if you shift really
really well, you know, there's a point at

00:47:06.820 --> 00:47:08.990
which your car just isn't good enough.

00:47:08.990 --> 00:47:09.990
And you'll have to buy a new car.

00:47:09.990 --> 00:47:12.030
And the only way to buy a new car is to get
respect.

00:47:12.030 --> 00:47:18.990
And it's very challenging to get respect within
the game without actually paying money.

00:47:18.990 --> 00:47:22.390
And I kinda wish the game had sort of a deeper
grind factor.

00:47:22.390 --> 00:47:24.310
Maybe it's there and I just didn't see it.

00:47:24.310 --> 00:47:25.310
&gt;&gt;Ian: Mm-hm.

00:47:25.310 --> 00:47:26.840
&gt;&gt;Dan G: In my playing of the game.

00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:27.960
That being said, the game plays really well.

00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:29.060
It looks pretty good.

00:47:29.060 --> 00:47:34.050
A little tiny bit blurry here on the size
of a Transformer Prime.

00:47:34.050 --> 00:47:36.060
&gt;&gt;Ian: It's definitely a button masher.

00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:38.190
&gt;&gt;Dan G: It's, I wouldn't sayó

00:47:38.190 --> 00:47:39.200
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah, it'só

00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:41.369
&gt;&gt;Dan G: I wouldn't even call it a masher.

00:47:41.369 --> 00:47:42.369
&gt;&gt;Ian: It's Pavlovian.

00:47:42.369 --> 00:47:46.670
It shows you the little upshift thing and
then you press the button and it says "Good

00:47:46.670 --> 00:47:47.670
job!"

00:47:47.670 --> 00:47:48.670
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Exactly.

00:47:48.670 --> 00:47:49.670
&gt;&gt;Ian: Good Job!

00:47:49.670 --> 00:47:52.230
&gt;&gt;Dan G: So yeah, it's pretty limited.

00:47:52.230 --> 00:47:54.180
But I wanted to at least bring it up.

00:47:54.180 --> 00:47:59.600
You know, and again, if you like this kinda
game, it seems to be a pretty good version

00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:01.580
of that, of an entry into that genre.

00:48:01.580 --> 00:48:02.580
&gt;&gt;Ian: I mean, I've seen better.

00:48:02.580 --> 00:48:03.849
I really have.

00:48:03.849 --> 00:48:04.849
But not on tablet.

00:48:04.849 --> 00:48:06.040
&gt;&gt;Dan G: exactly.

00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:09.990
Now another completely different kind of racing
game is Reckless Get Away.

00:48:09.990 --> 00:48:10.990
&gt;&gt;Ian: Oh, this is a great game.

00:48:10.990 --> 00:48:11.990
I love this.

00:48:11.990 --> 00:48:16.830
&gt;&gt;Dan G: This is a super fun. it's, and it
actually has a cute little story behind it

00:48:16.830 --> 00:48:20.920
that you are trying to get away.

00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:21.920
Let's actually doó

00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:22.920
&gt;&gt;Ian: Recklessly?

00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:23.920
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Recklessly.

00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:24.920
Yeah.

00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:25.920
And even little details like.

00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:26.920
&gt;&gt;Ian: I love that.

00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:27.920
"Please wait, robbery in progress."

00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:28.920
That's a great one.

00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:29.920
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Robbery in progress.

00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:30.920
I love the money flying out of your car.

00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:32.280
There's all sorts of cool jumps you can take.

00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:35.660
There is just tons and tons and tons of stuff
to do in this game.

00:48:35.660 --> 00:48:39.150
&gt;&gt;Ian: Now I would have loved to have a little
bit more control over it.

00:48:39.150 --> 00:48:40.500
but maybe that's just me.

00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:44.470
Now I'm old and I don't have the greatest
reflexes, but I felt like this control scheme

00:48:44.470 --> 00:48:48.160
was actually really difficult to manage.

00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:52.900
I would have actually liked some really sensitive
tilt controls.

00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:54.920
Which is odd because as you know, I hate tilt
controls.

00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:55.920
But--

00:48:55.920 --> 00:48:57.170
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Yeah, driving games are one of the
few places

00:48:57.170 --> 00:48:58.170
&gt;&gt;Ian: Exactly.

00:48:58.170 --> 00:49:00.089
&gt;&gt;Dan G: In which I find that tilt controls
actually are not so bad.

00:49:00.089 --> 00:49:01.490
And I often prefer them.

00:49:01.490 --> 00:49:04.140
&gt;&gt;Ian: Well especially if they're reasonably
sensitive.

00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:06.710
&gt;&gt;Dan G: But this game is really well done.

00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:11.380
And it's, I love the perspective.

00:49:11.380 --> 00:49:12.750
You know, we took a jump there.

00:49:12.750 --> 00:49:14.970
&gt;&gt;Ian: and all the background work they've
done.

00:49:14.970 --> 00:49:18.020
I mean this is, it's a professional title.

00:49:18.020 --> 00:49:19.520
There's no question about that.

00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:20.770
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Yeah, absolutely.

00:49:20.770 --> 00:49:23.920
So I mean as I said, I was glad to see this
up there.

00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:28.270
This game hasn't gotten a lot of love recently
and I think it's just, I think it's a really

00:49:28.270 --> 00:49:32.440
well done title that does something substantially
different in this genre.

00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:33.440
You know.

00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:37.190
There's really what I, three different kinds
of games that we see really commonly in the

00:49:37.190 --> 00:49:38.190
genre.

00:49:38.190 --> 00:49:39.190
We see sort of slot racing games.

00:49:39.190 --> 00:49:42.780
Which are over the head where you see a large
percentage of the track.

00:49:42.780 --> 00:49:44.890
We see the more traditional driving games.

00:49:44.890 --> 00:49:47.780
And this is a perspective we don't see nearly
as much.

00:49:47.780 --> 00:49:50.960
Which is kind of reminiscent of the perspective
from like Spy Hunter.

00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:52.160
In the original overheadó

00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:54.230
&gt;&gt;Ian: that is what it reminds me of.

00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:55.230
Yeah.

00:49:55.230 --> 00:49:56.230
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Overhead racing game.

00:49:56.230 --> 00:49:57.230
And it's awesome.

00:49:57.230 --> 00:49:58.230
&gt;&gt;Ian: [inaudible]

00:49:58.230 --> 00:50:01.190
&gt;&gt;Dan G: So you know, I definitely, here's
by the way an example of the developer who

00:50:01.190 --> 00:50:03.230
just did not know what to do with the back
key.

00:50:03.230 --> 00:50:07.981
Here we are we've got a screen that says "Play
again" and "Continue" and there, so what do

00:50:07.981 --> 00:50:09.230
we do here with the back key.

00:50:09.230 --> 00:50:14.340
Well actually in this particular case, Play
again or Continue, there is actually a third

00:50:14.340 --> 00:50:18.130
option which would be Exit to the main menu.

00:50:18.130 --> 00:50:21.380
And hitting the back key actually should exit
you back here.

00:50:21.380 --> 00:50:23.690
There's no reason why it needs to be Play
and Continue.

00:50:23.690 --> 00:50:26.230
This is sort of a design, so they made the
back key do nothing.

00:50:26.230 --> 00:50:27.230
That's bad.

00:50:27.230 --> 00:50:28.230
It should always do something.

00:50:28.230 --> 00:50:30.320
Especially at the end of the game when you
might just wanna exit.

00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:31.320
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:35.320
&gt;&gt;Dan G: And switch game modes and instead
you have to target the continue button which

00:50:35.320 --> 00:50:36.320
is really unfortunate.

00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:39.690
&gt;&gt;Ian: Remember, the back button does two
things.

00:50:39.690 --> 00:50:43.700
It moves you back to the previous activity.

00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:45.630
Or it dismisses dialogs.

00:50:45.630 --> 00:50:51.890
So if you're saying to yourself, "Wow, what
I'm looking at here has no meaningful back

00:50:51.890 --> 00:50:52.890
thing."

00:50:52.890 --> 00:50:53.890
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Yeah.

00:50:53.890 --> 00:50:56.520
&gt;&gt;Ian: you know maybe it's because you need
to think of it as a dismissing rather than

00:50:56.520 --> 00:50:57.520
a moving on.

00:50:57.520 --> 00:50:58.520
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Yeah.

00:50:58.520 --> 00:50:59.520
Continue actually does not.

00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:01.320
When I saw "continue", I think what does continue
mean?

00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:02.700
I had no idea.

00:51:02.700 --> 00:51:06.349
And then I realized what they, what "continue"
actually does is take you back to the selection

00:51:06.349 --> 00:51:07.349
screen.

00:51:07.349 --> 00:51:10.619
So "continue" is really not, doesn't make
much sense there.

00:51:10.619 --> 00:51:11.619
&gt;&gt;Ian: It's tough.

00:51:11.619 --> 00:51:14.140
Certainly there are some places where we stretch
a little bit.

00:51:14.140 --> 00:51:16.000
But you know what?

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:17.000
Suck it up.

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:19.390
Android has a back button and people expect
to be able to use it.

00:51:19.390 --> 00:51:22.300
&gt;&gt;Dan G: So here's I wanted to bring up Tiny
Little Racing.

00:51:22.300 --> 00:51:26.890
&gt;&gt;Ian: Oh yeah, you know what, we were gonna
look at this a while ago.

00:51:26.890 --> 00:51:28.020
And then we didn't.

00:51:28.020 --> 00:51:29.200
&gt;&gt;Dan G: So first of alló

00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:31.410
&gt;&gt;Ian: And I even said "Wow, we really loved
this."

00:51:31.410 --> 00:51:32.410
And it turned out I was wrong.

00:51:32.410 --> 00:51:33.410
&gt;&gt;Dan G: [laughs]

00:51:33.410 --> 00:51:37.270
&gt;&gt;Ian: It turned out it was a different game
with a really really similar name that we

00:51:37.270 --> 00:51:38.270
really really loved.

00:51:38.270 --> 00:51:39.270
But this is still a good game.

00:51:39.270 --> 00:51:40.270
&gt;&gt;Dan G: So let's talk about it.

00:51:40.270 --> 00:51:41.420
First of all, we see this.

00:51:41.420 --> 00:51:42.420
&gt;&gt;Ian: Oooohh.

00:51:42.420 --> 00:51:43.420
Don't.

00:51:43.420 --> 00:51:44.420
&gt;&gt;Dan G: [shouting] Don't ever do this!

00:51:44.420 --> 00:51:45.420
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah, yeah.

00:51:45.420 --> 00:51:46.420
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Don't ever do this because weó

00:51:46.420 --> 00:51:47.420
&gt;&gt;Ian: At least autofill, come on.

00:51:47.420 --> 00:51:48.610
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Well it's not just that.

00:51:48.610 --> 00:51:50.760
One is that I'm not using the standard Android
keyboard.

00:51:50.760 --> 00:51:52.320
&gt;&gt;Ian: Oh yeah.

00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:56.180
&gt;&gt;Dan G: So the question is, I'm gonna stick
this in the dock.

00:51:56.180 --> 00:51:58.290
And the keyboard doesn't work.

00:51:58.290 --> 00:51:59.340
&gt;&gt;Ian: [shouting] Number two!

00:51:59.340 --> 00:52:00.340
Camera two!

00:52:00.340 --> 00:52:01.970
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Go to switch to camera two!

00:52:01.970 --> 00:52:02.970
&gt;&gt;Ian: Number two!

00:52:02.970 --> 00:52:03.970
Camera two?

00:52:03.970 --> 00:52:04.970
&gt;&gt;Dan: Wreee!

00:52:04.970 --> 00:52:05.970
Wreee!

00:52:05.970 --> 00:52:06.970
No, that's a no!

00:52:06.970 --> 00:52:07.970
&gt;&gt;Ian: [inaudible] Alright.

00:52:07.970 --> 00:52:08.970
OK.

00:52:08.970 --> 00:52:09.970
Now look at what poor Dan is trying to do
here.

00:52:09.970 --> 00:52:11.640
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Yeah, I'm, I just quit the game.

00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:14.460
But I was trying to type my name. and I can't
type on the keyboard.

00:52:14.460 --> 00:52:17.250
&gt;&gt;Ian: The point is, he's just amazingly frustrated
with this whole thing.

00:52:17.250 --> 00:52:18.250
[loud tapping sound]

00:52:18.250 --> 00:52:20.740
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Because we're not using one of the
default input methods of Android so I can't

00:52:20.740 --> 00:52:23.710
actually type my name using the keyboard that's
in front of me!

00:52:23.710 --> 00:52:28.660
So this is, so don't use your own input method
as a general rule, even though it looks really

00:52:28.660 --> 00:52:29.660
cool.

00:52:29.660 --> 00:52:31.190
And you can put Comic Sans on there.

00:52:31.190 --> 00:52:32.520
Which also I say never use Comic Sans.

00:52:32.520 --> 00:52:33.520
But that's a different question.

00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:35.750
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah, did you not get the meme?

00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:36.750
[laughter]

00:52:36.750 --> 00:52:38.339
&gt;&gt;Dan G: So.

00:52:38.339 --> 00:52:41.760
So that's one thing.

00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:42.760
This game is fun.

00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:45.570
I definitely wanna see some higher resolution
graphics.

00:52:45.570 --> 00:52:47.380
Everything here is really really blurry.

00:52:47.380 --> 00:52:49.510
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah, this game wasn't really built
for a tablet.

00:52:49.510 --> 00:52:50.510
&gt;&gt;Dan G: No.

00:52:50.510 --> 00:52:53.080
&gt;&gt;Ian: Also the models are really low res.

00:52:53.080 --> 00:52:58.260
So you get the feeling that maybe this was
tuned for a much less capable device.

00:52:58.260 --> 00:53:00.140
And that's fine.

00:53:00.140 --> 00:53:07.900
But what you might wanna do and this is just
a general game design idea, in general, it's

00:53:07.900 --> 00:53:12.630
not very difficult to make a model that's
very high polygon count.

00:53:12.630 --> 00:53:15.859
I mean, the hard part is reducing it to a
low polygon count.

00:53:15.859 --> 00:53:16.859
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Yeah.

00:53:16.859 --> 00:53:22.869
&gt;&gt;Ian: So if you keep your sources and just
every now and then when the state of technology

00:53:22.869 --> 00:53:27.170
gets there, put some better models in your
game.

00:53:27.170 --> 00:53:30.770
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Yeah, actually to be honest, the
models I think the car models are really good.

00:53:30.770 --> 00:53:33.849
It's the rest of everything else that I want
to see.

00:53:33.849 --> 00:53:36.030
&gt;&gt;Ian: Well, the car models are attractive.

00:53:36.030 --> 00:53:37.060
My point is that they're low poly.

00:53:37.060 --> 00:53:41.400
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Yeah, and then they don't really
look like anything else in the game.

00:53:41.400 --> 00:53:44.130
And I think it's cute some of the design elements.

00:53:44.130 --> 00:53:48.870
But I would love to see some, even if the
backgrounds are gonna look like that it'd

00:53:48.870 --> 00:53:52.500
be kind of cool if they were a little bit
soft focused that kind of thing.

00:53:52.500 --> 00:53:56.920
&gt;&gt;Ian: Now let's just move to camera two really
quick.

00:53:56.920 --> 00:54:04.200
You'll notice that my excessively large hands
still have to kind of reach to get theó

00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:05.200
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Yes.

00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:06.200
Sorry.

00:54:06.200 --> 00:54:07.200
We're losing HD Mic here.

00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:09.380
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah, left and right button there.

00:54:09.380 --> 00:54:11.950
I mean, there, it really is a stretch.

00:54:11.950 --> 00:54:12.950
Notó

00:54:12.950 --> 00:54:17.220
&gt;&gt;Dan G: This is an example of buttons that
are not scaled based upon the pixel density

00:54:17.220 --> 00:54:19.660
of the screen.

00:54:19.660 --> 00:54:22.730
They're stretched based upon the screen size.

00:54:22.730 --> 00:54:23.830
So we have two options here.

00:54:23.830 --> 00:54:25.410
One is that we can look at pixel density.

00:54:25.410 --> 00:54:27.280
That helps a little bit.

00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:30.839
The other thing is we actually can have a
separate tablet layout that would help even

00:54:30.839 --> 00:54:31.839
more.

00:54:31.839 --> 00:54:37.710
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah, remember that Android has some
really nice features for putting together

00:54:37.710 --> 00:54:39.470
layouts of different screens.

00:54:39.470 --> 00:54:42.800
And a lot of game developers say "Well that
doesn't affect me at all.

00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:45.410
Because I'm not making views and I'm not making
horizontal layout."

00:54:45.410 --> 00:54:46.410
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Yeah, exactly.

00:54:46.410 --> 00:54:47.410
&gt;&gt;Ian: But you know what?

00:54:47.410 --> 00:54:53.070
You don't have to use that for just views
or dialog designs or UI designs.

00:54:53.070 --> 00:54:57.740
What you can do is put constant values in
there.

00:54:57.740 --> 00:55:01.250
And then pull those out based on the resource
id.

00:55:01.250 --> 00:55:06.410
And you'll get the different values based
on which screen size you're on.

00:55:06.410 --> 00:55:07.980
Or you know, whatever you filter it on.

00:55:07.980 --> 00:55:08.980
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Absolutely.

00:55:08.980 --> 00:55:10.440
And again you could do a couple things.

00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:12.650
One is you could actually get the pixel density.

00:55:12.650 --> 00:55:16.020
And you can just apply that to what you're
doing in open GL.

00:55:16.020 --> 00:55:19.110
So you're getting some thing that's the correct
physical size.

00:55:19.110 --> 00:55:20.110
Which is really important.

00:55:20.110 --> 00:55:25.510
'Cause what you wanna make sure is also if
this screen were very very small you'd still

00:55:25.510 --> 00:55:27.640
want those things to be very very large.

00:55:27.640 --> 00:55:31.000
And this things looks like it's just stretching
based on the size of the screen.

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:33.160
So that's definitely one thing.

00:55:33.160 --> 00:55:35.369
Making it automatic is really important too.

00:55:35.369 --> 00:55:36.369
So--

00:55:36.369 --> 00:55:43.150
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah, one thing you can do actually
in open GL that's really super cool is define

00:55:43.150 --> 00:55:44.890
your UI in meters.

00:55:44.890 --> 00:55:46.910
Which sounds stupid.

00:55:46.910 --> 00:55:48.060
But trust me.

00:55:48.060 --> 00:55:53.580
Don't ever do-- Like I've been on projects
where people like, "Oh, maybe we want a little

00:55:53.580 --> 00:55:55.270
bit more precision or whatever.

00:55:55.270 --> 00:55:56.810
Let's use decimeters or something."

00:55:56.810 --> 00:55:57.810
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Exactly.

00:55:57.810 --> 00:55:58.810
&gt;&gt;Ian: And it just screws up your physics
system.

00:55:58.810 --> 00:55:59.810
Don't ever use that.

00:55:59.810 --> 00:56:08.650
But define your UI in meters and then just
have a matrix that scales from meters to screen

00:56:08.650 --> 00:56:09.650
units.

00:56:09.650 --> 00:56:12.450
&gt;&gt;Dan G: and you'll definitely have to test
this on a wide variety of physical screen

00:56:12.450 --> 00:56:13.450
sizes.

00:56:13.450 --> 00:56:18.780
But it's much much easier than actually trying
to come up with lots and lots of individual

00:56:18.780 --> 00:56:20.900
layouts to handle every single setup.

00:56:20.900 --> 00:56:22.290
Every single combination of pixel and density.

00:56:22.290 --> 00:56:23.470
&gt;&gt;Ian: and I'm not gonna lie to you.

00:56:23.470 --> 00:56:24.470
This isn't easy.

00:56:24.470 --> 00:56:26.690
There is no simple thing that you can to.

00:56:26.690 --> 00:56:27.690
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Yeah.

00:56:27.690 --> 00:56:30.780
&gt;&gt;Ian: Especially if you're dealing with different
aspect ratios.

00:56:30.780 --> 00:56:32.320
But it will be worth it.

00:56:32.320 --> 00:56:36.060
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Yeah, I mean, you know, the key thing
is, if you're trying to make the HUD look

00:56:36.060 --> 00:56:38.160
super attractive and perfect.

00:56:38.160 --> 00:56:39.450
It's definitely a bunch of work.

00:56:39.450 --> 00:56:40.450
&gt;&gt;Ian: Oh yeah.

00:56:40.450 --> 00:56:42.870
Your artists who, I'll tell you exactly what
they're gonna say.

00:56:42.870 --> 00:56:44.390
They're gonna be like "We have to be pixel
perfect."

00:56:44.390 --> 00:56:45.390
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Yeah.

00:56:45.390 --> 00:56:46.869
&gt;&gt;Ian: Otherwise it's no good.

00:56:46.869 --> 00:56:52.109
And that actually is, I said I would never
swear on this show.

00:56:52.109 --> 00:56:53.109
It is not true.

00:56:53.109 --> 00:56:54.310
&gt;&gt;Dan G: [laughs] Very good.

00:56:54.310 --> 00:56:57.180
That was well, I knew, I heard it coming.

00:56:57.180 --> 00:56:58.510
And I heard like, there's, the yeah, exactly.

00:56:58.510 --> 00:57:01.730
&gt;&gt;Ian: But lemme tell you why it's not true.

00:57:01.730 --> 00:57:10.270
So that was extremely true back when we were
working with NTSC TVs, or 480P. or even the,

00:57:10.270 --> 00:57:12.960
you know, a really high resolution on a big
screen.

00:57:12.960 --> 00:57:14.620
&gt;&gt;Dan g: but today everything is bi-linear
filtered.

00:57:14.620 --> 00:57:15.620
At least get tható

00:57:15.620 --> 00:57:16.760
&gt;&gt;Ian: Well not only that.

00:57:16.760 --> 00:57:21.070
But also we're talking about these really
really dense displays.

00:57:21.070 --> 00:57:22.070
OK, fine.

00:57:22.070 --> 00:57:27.590
If you're supporting some random old thing
that has a very low density display.

00:57:27.590 --> 00:57:29.560
You might want to think about this really
carefully.

00:57:29.560 --> 00:57:30.560
Butó

00:57:30.560 --> 00:57:31.560
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Here's an example.

00:57:31.560 --> 00:57:32.560
Let's take a look at Nexus 7.

00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:33.560
&gt;&gt;Ian: You just can't tell.

00:57:33.560 --> 00:57:34.700
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Nexus 7.

00:57:34.700 --> 00:57:38.839
All of the icons you see here for every single
app are actually being scaled down.

00:57:38.839 --> 00:57:39.839
&gt;&gt;Ian: Mm-hm.

00:57:39.839 --> 00:57:42.869
&gt;&gt;Dan G: We did not actually come up with
new icons for every single app at this pixel

00:57:42.869 --> 00:57:43.869
density.

00:57:43.869 --> 00:57:44.869
Because, you knowó

00:57:44.869 --> 00:57:45.869
&gt;&gt;Ian: Right, this is a 213 dpi.

00:57:45.869 --> 00:57:48.330
And we scaled from what, 250, or something?

00:57:48.330 --> 00:57:49.330
220?

00:57:49.330 --> 00:57:50.330
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Yeah.

00:57:50.330 --> 00:57:51.330
And, 240.

00:57:51.330 --> 00:57:52.330
&gt;&gt;Ian: 240, right.

00:57:52.330 --> 00:57:55.200
&gt;&gt;Dan G: and so we're scaling down a small
fraction.

00:57:55.200 --> 00:57:59.660
Honestly on this high of a pixel density display
you don't even notice it most of the time.

00:57:59.660 --> 00:58:04.050
You can actually go and create icons at 213
dpi if you want to.

00:58:04.050 --> 00:58:06.570
But we looked at it and we said, it's just
not worth it.

00:58:06.570 --> 00:58:09.760
And so it think that says a lot about scaling
down.

00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:14.609
If you're even, and again, icons are the worst
thing you can scale typically.

00:58:14.609 --> 00:58:16.880
Because they're really really information
dense.

00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:17.920
&gt;&gt;Ian: Except for text.

00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:19.230
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Except for text.

00:58:19.230 --> 00:58:21.140
But even icons, a lot of icons contain text.

00:58:21.140 --> 00:58:23.030
And a lot of icons contain line art.

00:58:23.030 --> 00:58:24.030
&gt;&gt;Ian: Right.

00:58:24.030 --> 00:58:25.710
&gt;&gt;Dan G: And details that you would normally
think, oh this shouldn't scale.

00:58:25.710 --> 00:58:26.710
And the realityó

00:58:26.710 --> 00:58:27.710
&gt;&gt;Ian: Don't put that in your iPods.

00:58:27.710 --> 00:58:28.710
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Yeah.

00:58:28.710 --> 00:58:31.300
The reality is, that, and actually let's take
one last look at the tablet.

00:58:31.300 --> 00:58:32.560
I wanted to look at the icons today.

00:58:32.560 --> 00:58:36.250
&gt;&gt;Ian: We are five minutes over time and Producer
Reto is like packing up his stuff.

00:58:36.250 --> 00:58:37.250
&gt;&gt;Dan G: [laughs]

00:58:37.250 --> 00:58:38.250
&gt;&gt;Ian: And ready to go.

00:58:38.250 --> 00:58:40.910
&gt;&gt;Dan G: So just one thing out of all these
icons.

00:58:40.910 --> 00:58:44.400
There are two icons that actually I think
are reasonable Android icons.

00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:46.490
That is the tractor digger icon believe it
or not.

00:58:46.490 --> 00:58:47.550
And the GTA icon.

00:58:47.550 --> 00:58:48.550
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:58:48.550 --> 00:58:49.550
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Every single one of those.

00:58:49.550 --> 00:58:51.130
&gt;&gt;Ian: Everyone looks like it's been maybe
lifted from somebody else's design.

00:58:51.130 --> 00:58:53.500
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Yeah, yeah, come on guys.

00:58:53.500 --> 00:58:55.430
Let's, let's try to make things.

00:58:55.430 --> 00:58:59.220
Every one of those looks the same, it's hard
to actually differentiate the content of all

00:58:59.220 --> 00:59:00.220
those other ones.

00:59:00.220 --> 00:59:02.060
But Tractor Digger and GTA are really easy
to differentiate.

00:59:02.060 --> 00:59:08.400
&gt;&gt;Ian: Also I'm just gonna say, Asphalt 7,
the game left icon looks like a six.

00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:10.210
It looks a lot like a six.

00:59:10.210 --> 00:59:11.410
It looks like Asphalt 7 6.

00:59:11.410 --> 00:59:12.410
I'm just saying.

00:59:12.410 --> 00:59:13.410
Alright, so let's go ahead andó

00:59:13.410 --> 00:59:14.410
Dan G: Next, so yeah.

00:59:14.410 --> 00:59:15.520
Everyone make sure to vote next week.

00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:16.520
That's what I wantedó

00:59:16.520 --> 00:59:18.030
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah, so next week's apps areó

00:59:18.030 --> 00:59:19.279
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Sports!

00:59:19.279 --> 00:59:20.560
Because it's the Olympics.

00:59:20.560 --> 00:59:21.560
Exactly.

00:59:21.560 --> 00:59:22.730
&gt;&gt;Ian: Will have been the Olympics.

00:59:22.730 --> 00:59:23.730
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Yes.

00:59:23.730 --> 00:59:25.760
&gt;&gt;Ian: So really it's sports games next week.

00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:33.010
Now if you don't know how this works, you
go to our page at Developers.Google.com slash

00:59:33.010 --> 00:59:34.010
live.

00:59:34.010 --> 00:59:39.920
Which is not down in the corner because this
is the wrong title.

00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:42.630
But it will be.

00:59:42.630 --> 00:59:49.119
Or you know, the link will always be in the
event that we put on our Google plus page.

00:59:49.119 --> 00:59:54.230
At that link, developer.Android.com slash
plus.

00:59:54.230 --> 00:59:58.110
Go there and there is at the very bottom,
scroll down to the bottom.

00:59:58.110 --> 01:00:02.770
Ignore the big black video thing that doesnít
have anything in it because there is no video

01:00:02.770 --> 01:00:03.770
yet.

01:00:03.770 --> 01:00:04.770
Ignore that.

01:00:04.770 --> 01:00:05.770
Scroll down.

01:00:05.770 --> 01:00:06.770
Scroll down further.

01:00:06.770 --> 01:00:07.770
[Dan laughing]

01:00:07.770 --> 01:00:10.260
Then at the bottom of the page there is a
Moderator link.

01:00:10.260 --> 01:00:11.260
It's actually not a link.

01:00:11.260 --> 01:00:15.609
It's actually embedded because the people
that did it are really cool web people.

01:00:15.609 --> 01:00:19.990
It's embedded in the page and you can suggest
new apps.

01:00:19.990 --> 01:00:20.990
Or new games.

01:00:20.990 --> 01:00:21.990
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Yes.

01:00:21.990 --> 01:00:24.109
You can flip to the tablet if you want to
see what this looks like.

01:00:24.109 --> 01:00:25.109
&gt;&gt;Ian: And you can also vote for the ones
that you really like it.

01:00:25.109 --> 01:00:26.109
Yeah yeah.

01:00:26.109 --> 01:00:27.109
Exactly.

01:00:27.109 --> 01:00:28.109
&gt;&gt;Dan G: So I put this up on our tablet.

01:00:28.109 --> 01:00:29.700
You can see everything we've looked at.

01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:34.000
You can see we now are looking at Sports games.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.170
For next time.

01:00:35.170 --> 01:00:39.250
And right now, we already have our first suggestions.

01:00:39.250 --> 01:00:41.040
Some of which don't look like sports games.

01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:42.570
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah, exactly.

01:00:42.570 --> 01:00:45.660
So "Hi, when do you plan to review puzzle
games."

01:00:45.660 --> 01:00:46.660
Not next week.

01:00:46.660 --> 01:00:47.660
So let's do that somewhere else.

01:00:47.660 --> 01:00:48.660
&gt;&gt;Dan G: [laughs] Yes.

01:00:48.660 --> 01:00:50.910
&gt;&gt;Ian: This will be marked as "Inappropriate."

01:00:50.910 --> 01:00:52.520
Let's flag that as "Inappropriate."

01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:53.520
But thanks.

01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:54.980
Because we do love puzzle games.

01:00:54.980 --> 01:00:56.599
At some point it'll happen.

01:00:56.599 --> 01:00:57.599
Just stay tuned.

01:00:57.599 --> 01:00:58.599
Just keep watching the show.

01:00:58.599 --> 01:00:59.599
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Exactly.

01:00:59.599 --> 01:01:00.599
So stay tuned.

01:01:00.599 --> 01:01:02.290
&gt;&gt;Ian: If you donít watch the show every
week, how are you gonna know?

01:01:02.290 --> 01:01:03.290
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Right.

01:01:03.290 --> 01:01:04.290
&gt;&gt;Ian: Exactly.

01:01:04.290 --> 01:01:08.400
&gt;&gt;Dan G: So definitely continue to nominate,
continue to vote.

01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:11.540
We're really excited about a lot of what we
saw this week.

01:01:11.540 --> 01:01:13.329
And I'm looking forward to seeing some great
sports games.

01:01:13.329 --> 01:01:14.329
&gt;&gt;Ian: Absolutely.

01:01:14.329 --> 01:01:15.790
&gt;&gt;Dan G: And golf is a sport.

01:01:15.790 --> 01:01:16.790
So if you want toó

01:01:16.790 --> 01:01:17.790
&gt;&gt;Ian: Mmmmm-kay.

01:01:17.790 --> 01:01:19.190
&gt;&gt;Dan G: As an example.

01:01:19.190 --> 01:01:23.740
So we're thinking about things, I want mostly
things that are a lot of Olympic sports too.

01:01:23.740 --> 01:01:26.900
If there is something good that we've missed
and it doesn't have to be summer Olympics.

01:01:26.900 --> 01:01:27.900
&gt;&gt;Ian: Oh yeah.

01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:30.280
If there's a great dressage app out there,
I wanna see it.

01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:31.280
[Dan laughs]

01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:38.000
But the other thing that I wanna remind you
is our goal here is to help developers make

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.260
better games.

01:01:39.260 --> 01:01:44.410
So we may not always review the most popular
games.

01:01:44.410 --> 01:01:46.710
We may not always be kind to some games.

01:01:46.710 --> 01:01:50.740
But our goal is to at least help you understand
how a game could be better.

01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:55.260
Now sometimes we don't accomplish that because
the game is so great to begin with Radiant

01:01:55.260 --> 01:01:56.260
Defense.

01:01:56.260 --> 01:01:57.260
But.

01:01:57.260 --> 01:01:58.260
[Dan laughs]

01:01:58.260 --> 01:02:03.470
IN general if we're critical of a game it's
'cause we think it's decent but could be better.

01:02:03.470 --> 01:02:09.060
And for that reason actually our colleague
Reto has renamed his show "The Friday App

01:02:09.060 --> 01:02:10.060
Clinic."

01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:11.060
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Mmm.

01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:12.470
&gt;&gt;Ian: We may do something similar.

01:02:12.470 --> 01:02:13.470
I don't know.

01:02:13.470 --> 01:02:15.090
Leave a comment on our G plus page.

01:02:15.090 --> 01:02:16.090
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Exactly.

01:02:16.090 --> 01:02:17.360
Let us know exactly.

01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:18.950
&gt;&gt;Ian: OK, we gotta get out of here.

01:02:18.950 --> 01:02:19.950
&gt;&gt;Dan G: We're way over time.

01:02:19.950 --> 01:02:20.950
&gt;&gt;Ian: We're way over time.

01:02:20.950 --> 01:02:21.950
&gt;&gt;Dan G: We started late though.

01:02:21.950 --> 01:02:23.630
So it's, we can be a little over.

01:02:23.630 --> 01:02:27.080
&gt;&gt;Ian: So thanks once again to our producer
Reto Meier.

01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:29.190
Our engineer Daniel Fam.

01:02:29.190 --> 01:02:30.380
And we will see you next week.

01:02:30.380 --> 01:02:31.380
&gt;&gt;Dan G: Cheers.

01:02:31.380 --> 01:02:31.382
