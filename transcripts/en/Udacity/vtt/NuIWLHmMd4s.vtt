00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:02.980
It's really interesting to see how my body might metabolize

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.800
drugs differently from someone else but what about all those

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.900
traits that aren't so simple, that don't just have one

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:12.380
way or another? The complex traits, like diabetes or heart disease?

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.540
&gt;&gt; Yeah, especially for many diseases, the genetics is complex so

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.700
we need to look at multiple SMBs to figure out what

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.560
your risk of disease is. So, well one example we can

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.030
go and take a look at your results for coronary heart disease.

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27.020
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.062
&gt;&gt; So Matt, let's go to your results, and then look under

00:00:31.062 --> 00:00:31.836
[CROSSTALK]

00:00:31.836 --> 00:00:35.250
health risks. That's where many of these

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.789
complex disease reports are, that involve multiple SNDs.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.870
&gt;&gt; Okay, look so this is my health risk page. I am sure a

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.560
lot of people are interested in this, and it seems to list them in

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:52.270
order of elevated risk here first, and we have a list of them from

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.840
my risk down to the, average risk here. So, it looks like I have elevated

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:02.760
risk for psoriasis, Alzheimer's, chronic kidney disease multiple Sclerosis?

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.190
&gt;&gt; In many case, it might be slightly

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.150
higher than average, but not much higher than average.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.595
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I see here that, for example, Multiple Sclerosis is 0.47%

00:01:10.595 --> 00:01:10.790
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.065
&gt;&gt; But the average is like 0.34%.

00:01:12.065 --> 00:01:15.030
&gt;&gt; Right, right. And especially when the average is low, you

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.950
can have a higher than average and it still can be low.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.399
&gt;&gt; So let's scroll down to coronary heart disease.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.980
&gt;&gt; Al right.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.080
&gt;&gt; So it actually

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.770
says this is under my decrease risk category.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.040
&gt;&gt; That means lower than average.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.200
&gt;&gt; So my risk is 32.9%.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.430
&gt;&gt; So let's click on the report to get the details

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:36.250
of where that estimate comes from. Okay, and let's scroll down and

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.980
it says, this is information for Matthew Cook, and it's under

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:45.130
the assumption that you have European ancestry, mostly, and, this if for

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.080
the rage, age range is between age 45 and 79. So basically what's getting

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:58.000
calculated here is your risk of coronary heart disease between the,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.810
your ages when, between your ages of 45 and 79, so before

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.540
age 79, what is your chance of, of having coronary heart disease, and.

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.230
&gt;&gt; And it looks like the averages is 46.8.

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:09.789
&gt;&gt; The average is actually not that far from 50%

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.280
so men, and this is for men of European ancestry.

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.750
it's actually quite high for the average

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.770
man, the risk of coronary heart disease.

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.390
&gt;&gt; And it says here that I'm actually lower and they have this nice

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.560
sort of visual to represent that out of a population of 100 or more.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.310
&gt;&gt; About a third.

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.103
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:02:27.103 --> 00:02:30.320
&gt;&gt; You're, you're of with people with your genetics

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.210
your risk seems to be about one in three.

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:35.004
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:02:35.004 --> 00:02:36.480
&gt;&gt; About 33%.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.080
&gt;&gt; Now how is this risk determined? I

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.940
mean, if I scroll down can I actually see?

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:40.090
&gt;&gt; Keep

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.260
scrolling and we'll see some details. And we'll see.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.940
&gt;&gt; Oh wow.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.130
&gt;&gt; All these little bars each bar refers to a different SNV.

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.980
&gt;&gt; Oh, so each one of these represents

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.930
a different possible change in my DNA sequence.

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.400
&gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. And some of them give you protection, and those

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.840
are the green bars, and some increased your risk on those are the red bars.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.880
&gt;&gt; Oh, wow. Oh, if I hover over it, it'll tell me.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:00.150
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.800
&gt;&gt; The gene and the, the SMD.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.440
&gt;&gt; SMD, that's right. And your genotype.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.580
&gt;&gt; So,

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.090
essentially, the number that you report for me is actually a combination of all.

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.440
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.130
&gt;&gt; Of these together?

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.740
&gt;&gt; That's right, you know, if you multiply across all the different SMBs to

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:18.712
get you an overall average risk for people who have similar genetics to you.

00:03:18.712 --> 00:03:22.100
&gt;&gt; We're going to focus a lot more on the idea of heritability.

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.280
&gt;&gt; Oh, yes.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.648
&gt;&gt; And, on population variation, and complex traits.

00:03:24.648 --> 00:03:25.648
&gt;&gt;

00:03:24.648 --> 00:03:24.820
[CROSSTALK]

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:25.040
Oh, okay.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.610
&gt;&gt; In lesson nine but, I'm just really curious if we

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.210
actually look at someone else who doesn't have a European background.

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.930
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.970
&gt;&gt; Let's look at Roy King, can we do him?

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:39.110
&gt;&gt; Yes we can, so Roy actually does have quite a bit of European ancestry.

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.675
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:03:39.675 --> 00:03:43.850
&gt;&gt; but this is still assuming, this is really focusing on

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:49.040
his European ancestry, and so his estimate, shows somewhat higher than average.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.320
&gt;&gt; A

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.940
little less.

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.810
&gt;&gt; A little less than average.

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.430
&gt;&gt; but notice he is low in risk.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.160
&gt;&gt; Right. And so, I'm actually curious to, let's, let's change

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.930
something else. We're going back to my coronary heart disease report.

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:05.410
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.840
&gt;&gt; If I change the age range to let's say 45 to 54.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.990
&gt;&gt; So that's basically saying in that

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.660
&gt;&gt; Age range.

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.350
&gt;&gt; Age range. What is your chance.

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:15.051
&gt;&gt; The average is 7.7.

00:04:15.051 --> 00:04:15.660
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:16.070
Right.

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.410
&gt;&gt; So that's what we expect, people who

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.348
are younger have less a risk of heart disease.

00:04:20.348 --> 00:04:23.590
&gt;&gt; Yes.Yes If you compare that to the top age range, which is...

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.850
&gt;&gt; 75 to 79...

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.350
&gt;&gt; 75 to 79. It's going to be quite a bit higher. because, a lot

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:32.310
of your, lot of your risk for heart disease is when you're older. So it's...

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.890
&gt;&gt; Oh wow, yeah.

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:36.180
&gt;&gt; It's quite a bit higher. So, yours is still lower than

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.990
average but it's, a lot of risk for any of these diseases

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.580
is weighted to late in life.

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.180
&gt;&gt; And just to be clear, this doesn't mean that I'm not going to have

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.240
coronary heart disease ever, this just means that

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.310
my risk for it is lower than average.

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:56.230
&gt;&gt; That's right. everyone has some risk but you can

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:59.440
see as you, when you compare the age range results that

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.660
it's still low now, especially in the next ten years, I

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.090
mean, you're still young, so your risk of having heart disease

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.290
in the next ten years is low. but by the time you

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:12.050
get into your late 70s it starts to go up a bit.

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.420
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:13.951
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.
