00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:10.830
This trailer is rated ‘R’ for Robocop.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.889
Cause that’s how you make a f*cking Robocop
movie!

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.500
It’s been more than 20 years since Robocop
appeared on the big screen, and now he’s

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.860
back, with a flip-up visor,

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.090
different origin,

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:24.340
a human hand,

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.190
and a PG-13 rating?

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:27.190
Screw that.

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:29.960
Instead, revisit the original masterpiece
that is...

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.000
Robocop.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.020
Journey to a futuristic Detroit that’s become
a bankrupt crimeridden hellhole.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.530
Basically present day Detroit.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:44.520
It’s a city crying out for a savior, and
they’ll get one in Robocop, a blatant Jesus

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.320
metaphor who’s killed,

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.580
gets resurrected,

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.230
and walks on water.

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:55.780
But instead of dying for our sins, this Jesus
shoots rapists in the d*ck.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:02.120
Meet his gum-chewing partner Lewis, a terrible
cop who never waits for backup,

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.620
runs like a girl,

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.640
and can’t resist male nudity.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.320
"Mind if I... zip this up?"

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.460
Baaaaaalls.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.469
Together, they’ll take down Old Detroit’s
biggest bad guys:

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:19.310
Clarence Boddicker, a drug lord who’s got
a real way with the ladies,

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.790
"Maybe you could, uh, fit me in."

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.619
Omni Consumer Products, an evil corporation
that does everything except make consumer

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:28.670
products,

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:37.259
ED-209, a heavily armed killing machine who
loses to a flight of stairs.

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:49.929
And glass.

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:54.380
Robo-suit up for the ultimate awesome 80’s
movie, full of...

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.840
big hair,

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:56.840
cocaine,

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:57.840
goons,

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.499
Cold War paranoia,

00:01:59.499 --> 00:02:01.491
and a no-nonsense black police captain.

00:02:01.491 --> 00:02:05.619
"Now get out of my police station and take
laughing boy with you!"

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:16.150
So return to a time when action movies were
made for adults but marketed to children.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.280
Featuring some of film’s best one liners...

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.710
“Dead or alive, you’re coming with me.”

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:22.750
“Your move, creep.”

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.550
“I’d buy that for a dollar!”

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.030
"B*tches leave."

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:33.310
And the Most.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:40.590
Blood squibs.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.240
Ever.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.920
Guarantee you won’t see THAT in the remake.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:47.920
Starring...

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:48.920
Daft Punk

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.130
Bruce Jenner

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.500
Tough Lady Cop

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.360
Old 80’s Businessman

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.630
Even Older 80’s Businessman

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.090
Jordan Belfort

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.870
That 70’s Drug Lord

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.100
Fox News

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:05.450
and Lindsay Lohan.

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.560
Robocop.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.590
Robocop is the last movie that needs a freakin
remake.

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.370
What are they gonna reboot next, Die Hard?

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.400
Oh no! I’ve said too much!

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:43.730
