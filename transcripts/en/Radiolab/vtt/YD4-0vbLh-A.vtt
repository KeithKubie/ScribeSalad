Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab, the podcast.

2
00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.310
And we're going to St Louis. Yeah. Nice, nice and direct.

3
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.340
He likes that because cause he lived, he's mom lives there. But,

4
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.420
but you'll like that because you're about to meet something. Somebody unusual.

5
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.860
Unrelated to my mother. Thankfully this comes from our producer pap alters.

6
00:00:19.861 --> 00:00:23.670
It's the story of a rescue. A double rescue. Really.

7
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.880
It's when we've been wanting to tell for a while. Pat Walters.

8
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:31.230
So a few months ago I went to St Louis because I'd heard this story about a guy

9
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.350
who had this pet that basically saved his life. Then the pet

10
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.100
is a bird. It's about this guy named Jim Eggers. Oh, you're recording.

11
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.300
And in 2005 Jim was living by himself in a little apartment in St Louis working

12
00:00:54.301 --> 00:00:56.370
in a Halloween industry. It was the winter.

13
00:00:56.371 --> 00:01:00.540
So Jim had just finished up his latest season at the local haunted house,

14
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.650
known the Halloween stuff for 19 years. What do you do?

15
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.780
Most of the time I've been in costumes and so forth, or wear masks, you know,

16
00:01:09.781 --> 00:01:12.450
like jumping out from behind dark corners and scaring people.

17
00:01:12.451 --> 00:01:15.570
I can scream and you know, go nuts.

18
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.250
Which is kind of a strange Gig for a guy like Jim because he has a really hot

19
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.100
temper. What's your, what's technically your diagnosis?

20
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.630
I have a bipolar disorder with psychotic tendencies and what that pretty much is

21
00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.210
when I'm having a mood swing or whatnot,

22
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.740
I can become extremely dangerous and violent. While I was there,

23
00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.410
he was totally calm, but Jim tells me that once he feels a mood swing,

24
00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:42.303
he start coming on.

25
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.470
It feels like real strange and Tinguely might just be a few seconds before all

26
00:01:48.751 --> 00:01:52.900
of a sudden, boom. Here you are. Like the incredible hulk. Yeah.

27
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.210
Have you ever, have you ever physically attacked?

28
00:01:57.211 --> 00:01:59.220
Similar to hurt them? Yeah.

29
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.960
Jim's known around his neighborhood for just losing it from time to time.

30
00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.100
He shouts at people in the street, punches, dents in people's cars.

31
00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.450
One time he even poured hot coffee from a second story window onto his

32
00:02:12.451 --> 00:02:16.500
neighbor's head. I go off on people and it's horrible.

33
00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.960
And if you ask Jim, he'll tell you, this all goes back to when he was seven,

34
00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.680
age of seven. I lost my kid brother in a Mississippi River.

35
00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.540
I just saw him drown. And um, you saw, you saw him driving?

36
00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.930
I witnessed him drowning. We wandered away from home.

37
00:02:33.931 --> 00:02:37.620
We were not properly supervised by my parents. And uh,

38
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.480
I told my brother not to go over into the river because it was d he didn't

39
00:02:42.481 --> 00:02:45.000
listen to me and then the current dragged him down.

40
00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.670
I saw him Bob up and down three times.

41
00:02:47.671 --> 00:02:52.671
And the third time he didn't come back up and I was pleading with God,

42
00:02:52.891 --> 00:02:56.490
you know, crying, please bring him back. I'm going to be in trouble.

43
00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.580
And when Jim's parents found out they blamed him, you know, it was my fault.

44
00:03:00.581 --> 00:03:03.950
My brother drown. I should've been. Yeah,

45
00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.890
I should've saved him. And in other times they told me that, you know,

46
00:03:08.891 --> 00:03:13.120
they wish it was me that died instead of my brother. And then when he was 16,

47
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.510
Tim's mom threw me out of the house. She just said one day, get out Jim.

48
00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.950
She said she didn't want me over there anymore. Get Out. After that,

49
00:03:20.951 --> 00:03:22.840
Jim's life kind of spiraled out of control.

50
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.070
He ended up living on the streets for years and just getting angrier and angrier

51
00:03:27.071 --> 00:03:28.150
at everyone around him.

52
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.080
And then in 2005 which you are part of the story begins.

53
00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.320
Jim Did something that got him in very serious trouble.

54
00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.550
Tell me about the archbishop situation. Okay.

55
00:03:39.551 --> 00:03:40.580
As far as the art,

56
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.570
he'd been reading news reports about sexual abuse in the Catholic Church.

57
00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.820
And for reasons that aren't entirely clear,

58
00:03:45.821 --> 00:03:50.230
Jim had become convinced that the local Archbishop, Archbishop Raymond Burke,

59
00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.060
was involved in covering the stuff up,

60
00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:56.920
bailing out priests that have sexually assaulted children and so forth.

61
00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.730
And one day he was watching the news and he saw Burke on there,

62
00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.210
like on the 12 o'clock news, talking about something. I can't remember what.

63
00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:10.420
And at that point I snapped and picked up a phone,

64
00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.910
dialed the archdiocese. I asked him to connect me to his office,

65
00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:21.430
which at like 80 hits they did. And when they did, I told them,

66
00:04:21.431 --> 00:04:24.940
you know, I ought to come down and kill you. I said,

67
00:04:24.941 --> 00:04:28.450
I may even do that Sunday, a couple of hours later,

68
00:04:28.451 --> 00:04:32.740
Jim went out to run some errands and when I head out the door here were the

69
00:04:32.741 --> 00:04:33.574
police

70
00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:37.580
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

71
00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.920
<v 0>Jim ended up getting sentenced to a year of probation,</v>

72
00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.170
just a few weeks into his probation.

73
00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.500
Something happened that would basically set the story that we're telling about

74
00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.580
Jim in motion like a year's probation does a typical Sunday morning and Jim's at

75
00:04:49.581 --> 00:04:53.390
church and he runs into this couple of these people that owned variety bird shop

76
00:04:53.391 --> 00:04:56.660
in valley park. The husband stopped me and said, well,

77
00:04:56.661 --> 00:04:59.240
we know where you can get an African gray pair.

78
00:04:59.241 --> 00:05:03.110
And they told me that she came with a cage. I say, why? Why,

79
00:05:03.111 --> 00:05:05.360
why would they approach you? Well,

80
00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:10.780
I was putting $100 aside every month to pay for a baby African gray parrot and

81
00:05:12.801 --> 00:05:16.430
you have to understand that Jim has kind of an animal in that he's had dogs and

82
00:05:16.431 --> 00:05:20.870
cats, Guinea pigs and stuff like that his whole life. Never a bird.

83
00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.500
But when Jim read about these African gray parrots and became kind of obsessed

84
00:05:24.501 --> 00:05:28.370
with getting one because I knew they were highly intelligent and they were a lot

85
00:05:28.371 --> 00:05:29.060
of fun.

86
00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.810
So when the birdshot people came up to Jim and said we can get you an African

87
00:05:32.811 --> 00:05:37.430
gray parrot and she comes with the cage for $550 Tim thinks to himself that's

88
00:05:37.431 --> 00:05:40.040
like half what I was going to pay. So he says, you know,

89
00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:43.580
I'll go ahead and take it cause I was too good of a deal to pass up.

90
00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:46.520
There was a catch though. The bird wasn't at the shop.

91
00:05:46.521 --> 00:05:50.480
It was being sold by this local kid who's just trying to get rid of her.

92
00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:55.130
I went over there and she looked absolutely horrible cause it does good.

93
00:05:55.131 --> 00:05:56.210
Didn't take care of her.

94
00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:02.340
<v 2>She's about a foot tall. You want some peanut butter? She had a black beak.</v>

95
00:06:02.341 --> 00:06:07.200
Pretty yellow eyes too. Piercing yellow eyes. Right. Red Tail feathers.

96
00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:09.180
But when Jim First Sar,

97
00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:14.270
oh she didn't have any flight feathers in her left wing cause she'd torn all of

98
00:06:14.641 --> 00:06:18.030
them out. Yeah. She was plucking her feathers,

99
00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:23.810
which is this awful thing birds do when they get really stressed. And Hey,

100
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.740
I mean, she looked horrible. I almost want to say no after I saw her.

101
00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:33.030
But he knew he couldn't just leave her there. So he paid the kid, took her home,

102
00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:37.440
give her lots of loving and care. And within like three days,

103
00:06:37.441 --> 00:06:40.610
she bowed her head. [inaudible]

104
00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.150
<v 0>that means she pretty much bonded with me.</v>

105
00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:50.530
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

106
00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:53.530
<v 0>I would like the third week I owned her, I was in a,</v>

107
00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:57.700
another room on the telephone and he said, hey, jam.

108
00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:02.510
Do you want a beer? And it's like, I don't drink beer.

109
00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:08.060
She would say that to you. She asked me if I wanted a beer and then she'd ask,

110
00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:11.420
uh, tell me, uh, uh, stuff like,

111
00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:16.820
will you get me a beer? You know, made me choke on my coffee.

112
00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:20.820
But a few weeks later, Sadie's started imitating gym. Yeah.

113
00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:26.490
She'll impersonate a little chuckle that I do. It's like,

114
00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:28.053
yeah,

115
00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:34.500
it's even better than Elmo could laugh. It has.

116
00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:38.100
Sadie spent more time with Jim. She learned to say words and phrases.

117
00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:43.500
And then one day, uh, several weeks after I had her,

118
00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:45.270
something kind of wonderful happened.

119
00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:49.020
I came home and I was like in a really bad mood and I knew I had to do

120
00:07:49.021 --> 00:07:49.854
something.

121
00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:54.030
One of those moments when Jim could just feel he was about to lose control.

122
00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:57.210
I was trying to talk myself into calming down. What would that,

123
00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:01.080
what would that sound like? I was talking to myself and tell myself, calm down,

124
00:08:01.081 --> 00:08:03.560
you'll be okay. Everything's fine, you know,

125
00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:08.700
and you know it's not so bad. And then she started repeating that

126
00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:14.520
same calm down, you'll be okay. Everything's fine. Exactly.

127
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.510
Just like Jim was saying, word for word. I was like, wow. And it's like,

128
00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.370
and it gives me an ideal,

129
00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:25.530
Jim started rewarding Sadie every time she said something that might help calm

130
00:08:25.531 --> 00:08:28.690
him down. Like, you know, Oh, you'll be okay. Treat,

131
00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:32.640
everything's fine is not as bad as you think. Treat shut up, treat.

132
00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:36.480
I don't want to hear a treat. I love you jam and you'll make a kissing sound,

133
00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.820
treat, treat. It just goes on and on and on.

134
00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:43.800
So Jim went online and actually found this special kind of cage that you can

135
00:08:43.801 --> 00:08:48.270
carry around on your back. Then I took her with me just everywhere.

136
00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:50.160
Even got her registered as a service animal.

137
00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.430
Kinda like a seeing eye dog mean everywhere. Where would you go with her?

138
00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.740
I've taken her into churches.

139
00:08:56.580 --> 00:09:01.080
I'm taking it or board the public buses. Take her to the gym.

140
00:09:01.081 --> 00:09:01.920
Yes.

141
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:06.980
I've even taken her into like a couple of casinos through here and demonstrate.

142
00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:10.830
He had a pretty good situation when Jim started feeling himself get mad,

143
00:09:10.831 --> 00:09:14.170
he'd tell himself calm down. Sadie would repeat him.

144
00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:19.740
But then one day a few years ago, he did something that went beyond mimicry.

145
00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:23.410
Tim says he doesn't exactly remember the first time it happened.

146
00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:27.310
I can't think of any thing right now cause I'm like blanking out.

147
00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:29.020
But it probably went something like this.

148
00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.240
Jim's just out in the neighborhood one day.

149
00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:36.280
It's got Stadi in her little backpack cage and something happens that sets Jim

150
00:09:36.281 --> 00:09:37.240
off. I don't know.

151
00:09:37.241 --> 00:09:41.530
A car cuts him off at the crosswalk and immediately Jim starts getting that

152
00:09:41.531 --> 00:09:45.130
tingly feeling. Yeah.

153
00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:50.170
And then in the split second fraction of a moment before Jim starts to talk

154
00:09:50.171 --> 00:09:54.760
himself down, like he does calm down. Jim Calm down. He hears calm down. Jim

155
00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:56.470
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

156
00:09:56.470 --> 00:10:00.880
<v 2>from Sadie. Exactly. She says at first. Yeah.</v>

157
00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:01.920
Wow. Like she,

158
00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:06.940
she like she knew what was in his mind or inside him like before he even did

159
00:10:07.421 --> 00:10:08.820
anything. Yeah. She know.

160
00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:12.960
<v 0>She, she can sense that. How do you suppose that was happening? I mean was she,</v>

161
00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:15.150
I don't know. I mean Jim thinks maybe she can like

162
00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:18.610
<v 2>feel a change in the way he's moving a, you know, my,</v>

163
00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:23.320
I have like body tremors when I'm starting to really get furious.

164
00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:28.470
Maybe Sadie can pick up on those trimmers and Jim says this just kept happening.

165
00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:31.900
She does it all the time and you know,

166
00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:36.930
makes you stop to think if I would go off on a person or something like that,

167
00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:42.420
you know, I wouldn't have any remorse or anything, but I mean,

168
00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:46.330
just a little innocent animal.

169
00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:50.230
It seemed to know him in this really intimate way.

170
00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:54.010
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

171
00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:56.830
<v 2>which kind of blew my mind. Yeah. But</v>

172
00:10:57.370 --> 00:10:58.560
<v 0>Cindy didn't do it while I was there,</v>

173
00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:03.660
so I left him this tape recorder and asked him to try to get something like this

174
00:11:03.661 --> 00:11:06.240
on tape just so I could prove it to people. Hello,

175
00:11:06.241 --> 00:11:09.880
my name is James Eggers and I'm standing here with my parents, Sadie.

176
00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:14.970
She's standing here right next to me on her little perch. See something.

177
00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:19.160
You can say something to the c something to the microphone. Oh,

178
00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:23.700
week or so later I got the tape back you have to say and said he was on there

179
00:11:23.701 --> 00:11:27.090
saying all kinds of things like, hello. Hello.

180
00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:31.900
She said her name. She said good girl.

181
00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:35.610
Things that I could imagine Jim saying to her,

182
00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:39.600
but did you ever get a sense from anything?

183
00:11:39.601 --> 00:11:43.920
She said that there was a kind of weird intuitive exchange happening or

184
00:11:43.921 --> 00:11:47.310
something? Not really, but I thought if it happens as often as Jim says,

185
00:11:47.311 --> 00:11:50.700
it happens that someone in his neighborhood must've seen it. Yeah,

186
00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:53.920
so I called this woman who runs a coffee shop around the from his house.

187
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:56.620
Ask her if she'd seen it. She hadn't. Oh.

188
00:11:57.060 --> 00:12:00.820
Then I figured I could call the company that runs the buses and the trains that

189
00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:03.760
Jim Rides every day thinking that maybe one of their drivers would have seen him

190
00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:06.040
get upset about something and nothing.

191
00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:09.880
And then I called Jim's best friend Larry and I figured if anyone has seen this,

192
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.390
it would be Larry because he's around them like all the time. He hadn't either.

193
00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:18.430
Huh. So I called Jim to ask if I was like missing anybody. He didn't answer.

194
00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:23.460
So I left a message, left another message. Then finally, hello.

195
00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:26.160
Hi Jim. I got him on the phone. It's pat again.

196
00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:28.580
<v 4>Yeah, go ahead.</v>

197
00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:30.663
<v 0>Um,</v>

198
00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:35.790
it seems like nobody else has ever seen her or heard her say those kinds of

199
00:12:37.841 --> 00:12:39.010
things to you.

200
00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:45.470
<v 4>Well, she's definitely has said those, but I mean,</v>

201
00:12:45.471 --> 00:12:47.010
she's not gonna say the same thing day,

202
00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:48.650
<v 0>but he talks to me. Right.</v>

203
00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:52.640
But has anyone ever seen her talk you down from being mad?

204
00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:57.850
<v 4>No, because most of the time people aren't around me.</v>

205
00:12:57.970 --> 00:12:59.470
When I'm having a mood swing,

206
00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:01.820
<v 0>they started to wonder like,</v>

207
00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:06.260
is this the kind of thing a parent is even capable of?

208
00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:12.470
So I decided to check. Hello. I call it the scientist. I'm Dr Irene Pepperberg,

209
00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:15.710
adjunct associate professor at Brandeis University.

210
00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:19.980
She's basically the world's expert on African gray parrots. So I asked her,

211
00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:25.020
have you, have you ever heard of anything like this before? Not exactly,

212
00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:28.900
but it doesn't surprise me. In fact,

213
00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:32.290
Irene told me that something kind of similar. It happened to her once.

214
00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:33.520
I mean there's this,

215
00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:36.460
with this parrot named Alex that she worked with for like decades.

216
00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:40.930
Irene told me that whenever Alex would get out of line preening and instead of

217
00:13:40.931 --> 00:13:43.550
working or budding in with the others,

218
00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:47.170
birds when he should be quiet so that we can train them. We'd say to him,

219
00:13:47.171 --> 00:13:49.030
calm down, just calm down.

220
00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:53.520
And one time I come storming into the laboratory cause I've just come from a

221
00:13:53.521 --> 00:13:55.680
horrible faculty meeting when I was in Tucson.

222
00:13:56.220 --> 00:14:00.450
And Alex takes one look at me and he says, calm down. Really?

223
00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:05.430
Yeah. And I actually stormed off and I said something to the effect of,

224
00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:07.080
don't you tell me to calm down?

225
00:14:07.081 --> 00:14:11.280
And I went into my office and slammed the door and Irene says that a parrot like

226
00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:15.390
Alex or Sadie probably doesn't know what calm down means or you'll be,

227
00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:19.530
you'll be okay. Jim. She may not know what each of those little phrases mean,

228
00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:22.930
but she knows that when she says calm down, Jim calms down.

229
00:14:22.931 --> 00:14:27.931
So she has learned from association that that will bring her flock mate back to

230
00:14:28.091 --> 00:14:29.740
normal, which is a big deal for parents.

231
00:14:29.741 --> 00:14:33.700
Irene says because they're priced so they're constantly looking out for each

232
00:14:33.701 --> 00:14:36.950
other, trying to keep from getting eaten. And it's eighties case,

233
00:14:36.951 --> 00:14:39.500
she's in a flock of two with this point.

234
00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:43.670
So if she wants to feel comfortable while preening or eating,

235
00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:48.760
she needs to know that he's going to be watching out for her. Remember,

236
00:14:48.761 --> 00:14:51.820
she doesn't have a big flock. She has him.

237
00:14:55.570 --> 00:14:59.140
<v 2>Wow. So in the end, what do you make of all this? Well,</v>

238
00:14:59.141 --> 00:15:03.640
I mean I can't prove that she does the things Jim says she does.

239
00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:05.260
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

240
00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.150
<v 2>but on the other hand, everyone I talked to you around,</v>

241
00:15:07.151 --> 00:15:12.151
Jim says that whatever is happening between them is keeping him from threatening

242
00:15:13.301 --> 00:15:16.240
people on the street from punching, dents in people's cars.

243
00:15:16.241 --> 00:15:19.300
It's just keeping him a better guy. Yeah.

244
00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:21.970
So maybe it doesn't matter.

245
00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:25.780
<v 4>I don't care if anybody believes me or not. You know, it's not,</v>

246
00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:30.040
I'm not here to prove anything to anybody. That's not the point.

247
00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:34.060
The point is, I know what she does and that is that.

248
00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:38.693
<v 5>No. Can you</v>

249
00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:46.020
see hello?

250
00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:52.450
<v 0>Number? [inaudible] no,</v>

251
00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:57.280
don't eat no eat. Gotcha, Gotcha, Gotcha,

252
00:15:57.310 --> 00:16:01.390
Gotcha, Gotcha, Gotcha, Gotcha. No links.

253
00:16:01.510 --> 00:16:02.380
Do Pat Walters

254
00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:03.830
<v 5>come on, fly home</v>

255
00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:10.900
<v 0>and to [inaudible] good girl into gym. Yep.</v>

256
00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:15.460
See, who do you looking at? Huh? And to you for listening? I'm Jad. I'm Robert.

257
00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:17.200
See you. He looks sleepy.

258
00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:21.550
She's got her eyes focused on me and trying to figure out what you,

259
00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:26.410
what you're doing with the my best. Yeah. And get you some coffee.
