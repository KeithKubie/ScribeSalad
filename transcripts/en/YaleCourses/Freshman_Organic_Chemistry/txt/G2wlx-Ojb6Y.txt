Speaker 1:          00:01          Okay. So last time we saw the jeopardy approach to solving the shredding or equation, which is to take the answer and find out what the problem was. And we saw that for a constant potential. You've got a sine wave, you could choose any length of sine wave you wanted, any wave period you wanted. It just turned out to be different energies and it had a relationship between the wavelength and the energy, the kinetic energy or the total energy. In that case, uh, and we saw an exponential is, um, uh, corresponds to negative kinetic energy, which not very many people in the class liked. And not very many people ever like it, but suck it up because that's the way kinetic energy is for small particles. If you don't like to call it kinetic energy because you're so wedded to the fact that that for big things, it's one half MV squared, then just consider it the difference between total energy and potential energy.

Speaker 1:          01:00          Okay. But anyhow, it's kinetic energy. Okay. So we've looked at the jeopardy approach to start with the answer and get the question, but we'd lot, we'd rather do it the other direction to start with the problem and find out what the answer is. And you can do that by guessing the energy. If you have a sufficiently simple system that is one particle in one dimension, and this is a great way to get the idea of what's special about quantum mechanics, make it as simple as possible. And then we'll go to realistic systems. Okay, so we can rearrange the Schrodinger equation. Remember this is the Schrodinger equation. Hci Equals East side divide through by Sy and split the HCI oversight part into the potential energy part V, which is a nothing, it's given to you and the and the kinetic energy part, which is a negative constant that involves the inverse mass times the curvature of Psi over Psi.

Speaker 1:          02:03          So it has to do with the shape of sy. And remember if you multiply side by a constant, you multiply the curvature by the same constant. So the kinetic energy stays the same. So it's only what we say the shape, not really the amplitude because that scales with the, with the curvature. Okay, but now we can rearrange this this way so we can, we have a formula here for the curvature of Psi right now, if you have a formula for the curvature, if you know how a curve is going to change how a line is going to change its curvature, then you have a recipe for drawing it. If you know how to start, if you start with a certain height and a certain slope, suppose you know that and you know the curvature at that point, then you know if you take a little step in that direction, what the next slope is going to be. Okay? Because that's how curved it is and if you recalculate and know the curvature at that point, then you know what the curvature at the next point is going to be in the next and the next and the next. Then you can use this to just draw a curve that's bound to, to satisfy the Schrodinger equation because you're using the Schrodinger equation to generate it.

Speaker 1:          03:29          Does everybody see this? This is really important. You want me to say it again? Or you've got it now, if you have a formula for the curvature, that's how fast the slope is changing. And if you know the initial height and the initial slope, right, then if you know the direction of the slope, you know where the next point's going to be. Okay? So you go to that just to make a tiny. Now this gets a problem in a computer. If the thing is really going like this and you take a finite step, the slope will have changed during your step and you won't get it just right. So you'll have to take smaller and smaller steps. So that doesn't change during the step. Genuine.

Speaker 1:          04:11          Can't hear it very well. Yeah. Curvatures, the second driven. Yeah. Uh, we'll get to that. But if you had the initial slope and the initial height, then you use the formula for the curvature to trace out the curve. Everybody got that now. Okay, so that's great. And, and it would be tedious to do this by hand, but that's what this little program, urban meets goldilocks does, is start the curve and draw it out according to what if you know everything else in the equation. Okay? So, and remember it curves away from zero when the potential energy is greater than the total energy and it curves towards zero when the potential energy is less than the total energy, right? So the potential energy being greater than the total energy is a bad situation intuitively. Right? It means the kinetic energy is negative and it curves away from the baseline.

Speaker 1:          05:14          And what's bad about that or dangerous about that? Yeah. Okay. Kevin? Pardon me? Yeah, it'll keep going until it gets to infinity if it's curving away. Okay. So that, and that's not allowed. It has to not go to infinity. Okay? So now do we know everything else? Well, we know am the mass. We know the constant c and the V is given to us. The potential energy is changes with position, right? But we know how it changes with position. It's cool ohms law typically, or we can do some other law if we want to. So this recipe, then you know everything, everything on the right except the total energy sigh you don't care about, because you can scale it, right? You can make it anything you want. Call it one. Okay, then we can double it. Or if we want to or whatever. So side, we know em, we know.

Speaker 1:          06:07          See We know v we know we're going to guess e. So that means if we know the initial slope and for the problems we work on, the initial slope will be zero. And you'll see why. Okay? Then we can use this formula to trace out the curve. And that's what the computer does for you. So people were worried last night about math. Don't worry about math, you don't let the computer calculate how these slopes change and so on. Right? All you have to do is think about the curvature. Okay? So you just have to think about the graph. Okay? So we're going to talk now about nodes and quantification in one dimension. Using this program, [inaudible] meets Goldie locks. And there's a problem set for Monday as you know that, where are you, uh, where you do this? And the answers are on the Wiki, but don't look at them before you've given it a good try.

Speaker 1:          07:04          Okay, so let's, let's, there, there are simpler things to start with like a constant potential energy or running into a wall or into a pillow, more like, but the, but the, uh, the harmonic oscillator or Hooke's law is a very popular one to do. So we're going to do that. Okay. So here we're looking at the potential energy as a function of distance and also on the side. So you'll see the distance goes from zero to two and a half fox drums and the potential energy and the potential energy goes from zero to a hundred kilocalories per mole. You can change that if you want to on the computer. Okay? And the horizontal black line is a completely different plot. It's a plot of PSI. That's what, that's the plot on top of this, when the, where we're going to trace out the wave function. Okay? And that's zero of the wave function.

Speaker 1:          07:55          Here's zero of energy, okay. And the reason we put them on top of one another is so that it's easy to see the influence of one on the other of the wave function on the, on the potential energy and vice versa. And because there are functions of the same thing, what cy? A function of, what's that? A function of its function of the position position of what the one particle we're talking about. Okay. And the potential energy is also a function of the position. Okay? So the way we're going to do this then is to guess an energy. Let the computer trace out this curve and see whether it's okay. What will tell us whether it's okay, how will we know if it's okay? It's got to be continuous, that we're not going to have a problem with that because the computer's tracing it out this way. It's not going to be just continuous w but the main thing is that it doesn't diverge and it doesn't go to infinity. Okay. So let's just guess 21 kilocalories per wall. Why not? Okay. Now you can already tell me something about what the curve is going to look like. Notice that at those two distances, between these two distances, the total energy is higher than the potential energy. What's the curve going to look like in that region?

Speaker 1:          09:29          If the kinetic kinetic energy is going to be positive, right? What will the curve look like? Pat? Can't hear very well. It's going to spike up in between those two lives. It made me go up. It may go down. Yeah. Pardon me. Uh, it's not, would it be a sign curve? Does anybody think that wouldn't be a curve by not Russell when the potential is, that's when the potential is constant. It's not constant through here. Right? So it won't be an exact sine curve if this isn't very high. It might be close to a sine curve cause it's sort of constant dish, right? If this is a very small distance, but what characteristic must have said Sydney, it'll curve towards zero. So it might, it'll, it'll look something like this. Always. It's curving and going up and down, maybe going high, but it's always curving.

Speaker 1:          10:34          To go back toward the baseline, it's never going to go to infinity. Okay. Now there is a problem because if you go the other way, the rest of the graph, the kinetic energy is negative because the potential is higher than the total. So in that region, there's great danger that the line is going to go to infinity because it's going to be curving away from the baseline. Okay. Now, how could you possibly avoid that? How could you have it such that the curvature divided by the value of the way you function gets very big and the curvature away from the baseline, but still it doesn't go to infinity. How can the kinetic energy be big and negative? The curvature divided by the value is enormous, but it doesn't go to infinity. How can that be? Pardon me? Bound. No, it's not a question about, I mean, this thing is that the particle, if it has this total energy is bounded, right? It can't go all the way to the left to the right. That's true enough. Okay. But that's not the, that's not the secret of how the wave function avoids going to infinity.

Speaker 2:          12:02          Yeah. Pardon me. Uh,

Speaker 1:          12:08          we can't make what a constant.

Speaker 2:          12:15          Okay, Russell,

Speaker 1:          12:20          but, but you say very little curvature, but, but the kinetic energy is enormous. The curvature divided by the value of the wave function has to be enormous,

Speaker 2:          12:35          Mike.

Speaker 1:          12:39          Ah, if the value of the wave function is almost zero, then you can have an enormous burden. Uh, yeah. Then you're going to have a tiny numerator, hardly any curvature at all. And still the quotient can be big, right? The kinetic energy can be enormous and negative, right? If the denominator is near zero. So that means that if you're in those red regions, you know what the wave function has to look like. What does it have to look like? It has to get down near zero and stay there so that it doesn't have the curvature that will enough curvature to pull it away. So it's got to look like that on the left. Right? Cause out here, you know that parabolas going way up. It's an enormous curvature divided by wave function. But if the wave function is essentially zero, still the curvature can be essentially zero.

Speaker 1:          13:36          Okay. And the same on the right. So we know that the curve is going to look like this, something like that. Okay. And all we have to do is connect the pieces. Okay? So let's try it. We guessed 21 kilocalories per mole. This we did in our head just by thinking about it. But let's let the program do it and start at the left. And now do you see why it has to start with with a zero slope why? It has to start with zero slope. Because if it's out in this region and does it has a finite slope or a, an appreciable slope and it's curving away, you're in trouble. Okay? Cause it's going to go to infinity. Okay, so here, here's, so we're going to use Arabic meets Goldilocks, this program, and we're going to start it here. It goes the curve and there there's the part where the kinetic energy is negative, right? It hasn't gone to infinity because it started low enough and with low enough slope out of the left. Okay? Now what's going to happen when it crosses that line?

Speaker 2:          14:42          Hi.

Speaker 1:          14:43          Now the curvature is going to be toward the baseline as we guessed it would be. So I like that.

Speaker 2:          14:51          And now what's

Speaker 1:          14:51          going to happen now it's going to start curving away from the base line again.

Speaker 2:          15:00          Aw,

Speaker 1:          15:02          you don't win them. All right. Okay. Now did we have too much energy or too little energy here? Notice that. What? What did we want it to do on the right? On the left is where we started. That looks great, but on the right we're having trouble. What do you need to do in the middle in order for it to behave? Okay? On the right, it has to not curve so much toward the baseline. Does everybody see what I'm saying? If it curved less than it could join that other line we had originally. Okay, so we'll give it a little less energy. Let's try 20 that's too hot. Okay. Too much energy. Okay, so well guess 20 kilocalories from all. Okay, here we go. Start out almost exactly the same. It's nearly the same energy, so it doesn't surprise you that it looks about the same and then it's going to curve in here. The way we expected, but a little bit less than it did before. All right, so now we're on the way to success.

Speaker 2:          16:10          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          16:11          So what was that one to coal and what do you need? Someplace in between these. There's going to be one. That's right. Okay, so it's between 20 and 21 now. Should we guess halfway between 20 and 21 is that the reasonable thing to do? Which original guests was better? Which guests was better originally and why? The red one or the blue one. Which guests was better? Why was the red one better close to baseline? It lasted longer before it went to infinity, so it's, it'll be closer to the red, the blue, and if you fiddle around, and that's what I want you to do because this is the way I think it gets into your head, is by guessing numbers and saying, where should I make the next guests? And so on. After you've done this a certain number of times, but enough times that it really gets into your bones and your brain right after you've done it enough times, then you can use the function that says solve and it will do that guessing game for you.

Speaker 1:          17:27          But do it yourself at the beginning. Okay. And it turns out that after you've done that, you get 20.74 Dadadadadada. Dot. I like a lot of decimal points, decimal positions, and you get that one just right. Okay. So that's the only math you need to do. Is it too hot or too or just right. Okay. And do you have to know why it has to be that way because of this curvature thing? Okay, so there we are. There we have it. 20.74 kilocalories per mole is a satisfactory energy and it comes with this wave function, whatever. That's good for. Okay. But the energy is what we were looking at. What energies are allowed for this system now, could there be a lower energy allowed for this system? Could you imagine a less curved wave function that would also have this property of not going to infinity? Can somebody guess what it would look like, nick? Ah, it could just go up and then come back to the baseline has to come back to the baseline but it could just go up rather than curbing so much in the middle. Okay, so we guess the lower one, could there be a lower energy sy? Yes, indeed. There could be one at 4.15 it's actually one four, nine something or other. Right. Do a lot of decimal points and there it is exactly what nick expected. Okay, so you got this. Could there be a still lower one

Speaker 2:          19:03          rolling?

Speaker 1:          19:05          Not In between. Could there we one lower than the blue. Can you imagine a way to get it even lower than the blue? Even lower curvature than the blue? Yeah. Angela [inaudible] like the one can't hear very well if the blue one is going up and we weren't going down. Oh, there could be an upside down blew one. Absolutely true. There could be an upside down blue one, but it's the same thing because it's the blue one multiplied by minus one. Remember you can multiply it by any number and it's still the same thing. Right, so that's exactly the same energy. It's not a different wave function. It's just multiplied by a constant, but you're right that that also does the trick, but it turns out to be the same thing. Can you imagine anything lower in energy than this? Impossible because of it. Have it had less curve curvature in the middle. It bound to go to infinity right when it got back in the other region. Okay, so that's the blue is the lowest one now could there be one in between these two?

Speaker 2:          20:14          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          20:15          How it looks like. How could you do it? Yeah, Kevin, one eight oh one peak above and one below. All right. You could, could there be an energy in between? Yes, indeed. There could be that one right now. Could there be others in between? What happens as you add curvature, you have these nodes. I is where the wave function is zero. It's not a node out here where it's almost zero. A node is when it's exactly zero and it has to be zero because it's going from being positive to be negative. Obviously it has to go through a zero out here and out there. It's very, very, very small, but it's not zero. That's not a node. A node is where it's zero because it's changing side. Okay. Now nodes are related to energy. Why notice that? The lowest energy when blue had no node, the next one, the purple had one node. The next one, the bio or whatever color it is, had had two nodes. Why is there that relationship?

Speaker 1:          21:33          They are inflection points, but why are, why do they get higher and energy when you have more nodes? Sam? Uh, say it in terms of energy. Some people would say frequency is energy. That's, that's true. But I want you to say it in terms of, we've been talking about how do you get more nodes? Yeah. Absolute value with curvature. Yeah. If the curvature gets bigger, you get more nodes and curvature is the energy, the kinetic energy, right? So more curvature, more nodes. More energy or more energy, more curvature, more nodes. So we have zero nodes, one node to those. Those are the lowest three you can get. And then there would be, uh, three nodes, four nodes, five node, six notes, had as many nodes as you want. Okay? Now this is great. You can do all sorts of neat tricks for Monday. And what I want you to do with this program is just the fiddle around with it and make discoveries for yourself.

Speaker 1:          22:40          And I'll show you some of the kinds of discoveries that, that you can do in the next slides here. Uh, but I warn you that if you have more dimensions or more particles, right, things quickly become impossible. The only thing you can do this particular approach with is one particle in one dimension. Because if you have more, if you have more, then you don't know which curvature to change. You know, the curvature Bimbo, or it's a sum of a bunch of curvatures. And knowing the kinetic energy, the difference between total and potential doesn't tell you which curvature to change. If there's only one, then you know that that's the one you have to do. So it's going to be a heck of a lot of work to do this for more complicated systems, right? And that's not our purpose. Now, our purpose is to understand how quantum mechanics works with this simple system.

Speaker 1:          23:35          But the question is, is it going to be worth our effort to learn out how, learn how it works if we're unable to do anything with it. What are our, another way of putting it is, what's the reward? What are we going to get out of this? Is it worth spending some time on? Well, here's the reward for science, finding Psi, the knowledge of everything, okay? For example, you know what? Energies are allowed to assist them. You know what the structures can be. You know how it behaves dynamically, how it moves. You know how bonds work. That's what we're really after. Remember? And you know what makes for reactivity? So there's a pretty good pot of gold at the end of this. So fasten your seat belts and, and put your nose to the grindstone and all sorts of metaphors. And we'll do this for the next couple of weeks.

Speaker 1:          24:32          Okay. First we'll look at allowed energies and structure. Okay? Now of course we already did this, right? No nodes, one node, two nodes, but what were the energies that were allowed? Okay, so here's a whole bunch of them, right? No nodes. One node to node, three nodes up to seven nodes, or is it seven? Yeah, seven nodes. Now here are the energies. 4.15 12.44 20.74 29.04 37.34 do you see any pattern to the energies you might read the title if you have trouble seeing right, they're evenly spaced right after the first one, right? They're evenly spaced. How about the first one compared with zero? How high is the first one? If you know this spacing, it's half the first one above zero is half as big as the spacing of the others, right? So the energy is some constant and that constant is what a 8.8 0.3 roughly times an integer minus a half.

Speaker 1:          25:44          Why do you have the integers cause nodes come in into jurors. You can't have half a node right at zero nodes, one, two, three, four and so on. Okay, so that's pretty great. We know for four springs or harmonic oscillators or uh, an Adam stuck on a bond as long as the potential, it doesn't vibrate so much that the potential deviates from looking like a parabola right at the bottom of the curve, it looks like a parabola. So this is the way Adam should behave when they're attached by bonds approximately. Okay? Now remember that Doggerel poem from 1926 we only wish that we could glean an inkling of what cy could mean. What have we used? Cy Four so far we used it. It's not going to infinity to find out when we guessed the energy, right? It was just a tool for telling us whether we had the right energy.

Speaker 1:          26:46          But does cy really mean something besides just being a handy tool for this purpose? And it was later, six months later in 1926 that it was suggested what the meaning of it was. And it was in this paper by Max born that this side doesn't mean anything but size squared is probability density or proportional to probability density if you scale it right. Remember, you can scale side by n multiplied by any number you want. If you scale it right, it is the probability density of the particle. Now, here's, here's what he wrote in German. And what it says is if one, when she wishes to translate this result into physical terms, only one interpretation as possible size signifies the probability of the structure.

Speaker 1:          27:41          But there's a footnote there cause he made a mistake and he corrected it after the thing was already set in type, right? So we've put a footnote here, which, which me, which says a correction added, improve more careful consideration shows that the probability is proportional to the square of sy. Why couldn't it be quite good in the probability be proportional to cy? Because cy can be negative. You can't have a negative. Well, that's one reason there, there were other reasons too. And, uh, he, I dunno how embarrassed he was by this, but anyhow, but since nobody else knew what side was at all, I think he could be proud nonetheless. Right? But anyhow, it's the square of side not site itself that gives probability density. Now, uh, late six months later, a Albert Einstein wrote a letter to mocks born where he said something you've probably heard, but an inner voice tells me that this is not the real thing.

Speaker 1:          28:47          Theory yields a great deal, but it brings us no nearer to the secret of the old one anyway, I'm convinced that he does not play dice, right? So it's not probabilities. There's this fundamental determinism, Einstein things, but it turned out that in this respect, Einstein was wrong, right? It is probability. Now it's not probability, it's probability density. And we have to think a little bit about this and we can think of it in by analogy with mass density. Suppose you had a flask and that had mercury in water and oil in it, right? And that you're going to ask the question if the total mass in the flask is one kilogram, what fraction of that or how much weight is exactly one centimeter from the bottom? How many are, what fraction of the total do you think would be exactly one centimeter from the bottom? Anybody got a guess? 5% 1% half a percent 10% 12% three there'll be this big auction, right? Do I hear higher than 12% do I hear lower than 12% who's bidding? Yup. What do you say? Zero.

Speaker 1:          30:13          Why zero? Well, obviously it has to do different. Different heights would have different densities, right? So there'd be a lot more in mercury than it would if I drew the line in oil or in or in water. Right? But you say zero y right? A plane or align or a dot doesn't have any volume, right? You need a volume. It's zero. You're right. You need a volume. You have to multiply density, grams per cubic centimeter by volume. How many cubic centimeters in order to get mass? And the same is true of some so that in this case the real question would be how much is between one centimeter and 1.01 centimeters or something like that. You could ask that question but you can't say how much is exactly one centimeter. So you have to multiply by volume multiplied density by volume to get the amount right and this that and so psi squared is probability density.

Speaker 1:          31:20          It's how it's how probable it is to be in a a small volume, a unit volume around the point in question. So you go to some point in question square, cy, find the density, multiply it by the volume over which sy is constant because it doesn't very real rapidly. So he choose a really small one multiply and that's the probability of being in that little block. Okay? Now remember we said you could multiply, you could scale side by any constant you wanted to even minus one or minus Pi or whatever. Okay? What is there a good value, a preferred value to scale it by? You could scale it by such a number than what it squared and you multiply by volume over every place, right? Sum up all these little boxes. You get one. Why do you want to get one?

Speaker 1:          32:19          Cause the total probability is one that it's someplace, right? So that's, that process is called normalization. We don't usually worry about that, right? We usually just take whatever numbers we want that's convenient to plot on the graph and know that we have to scale it such that if we want to calculate actual probability density, that's going to some the one. Okay, so here's an example where above we showed two of these curves and below we show squares of those not properly scaled together. Together. There's I think a little more area in the red than in the blue. Although maybe I'm bad. They should have the same area if the thing were normalized. Okay, so that shows what it is. Now there's an interesting thing about that. If you have a pendulum or a thing on a spring and it's going back and forth, where does it spend most of its time? At the extremes, right? Because it's going so slow there, right? In the blue one, where does it spend most of its time?

Speaker 1:          33:27          Where does it spend most of its time? Where is it most dense? If it's the blue wave function, the lowest wave function, the zero node wave function, obviously it spends its time in the middle, not at the extremes. But notice if you get to the seventh wave function, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, the seventh wave functions are going to have seven humps, okay? Then it's most profitable at the extremes, right? And as it gets, as it gets, as you get higher and higher, it gets more and more focused at the extremes. And that's why when you get to something that's really heavy, it behaves the way you expect the pendulum or a thing on a spring to behave. This is not normalized, but notice something else that's really valuable here are really crucial, which is that this line is where the potential and the total or the same for the red curve, right? So here is zero kinetic energy in here. The kinetic energy is positive. Out here it's negative. And the thing can be out here,

Speaker 2:          34:37          right?

Speaker 1:          34:37          So the thing exists in a region of negative kinetic energy. There's nothing special about that. Okay? It's just that that's the way things work. Kinetic energy can be negative. And in the case of the blue one, here was the point where the kinetic energy was zero. And all of this out here is probability in a region of negative kinetic energy. Now what did we do it with the Morse potential? Notice if we look at the first one with a morse potential, it looks the same as it would in a, in a Hooke's law harmonic oscillator. Does that surprise you? No, because the potential looks that way pretty much. Right? But as you go higher and higher and get here to whatever that is, the 12th or something like that, you can see that it's very different and it's spending a lot of time far out. It's shifting. It's average to the right. But that doesn't surprise because the well moves out to the, to the right, right? As you move up in the Morse potential as you move to higher energy, uh, because low kinetic energy, which is what you have as you move to the right means low curvature. Why does that make it high probability?

Speaker 1:          36:03          Because as long as you have high curvature over wave function, whenever the wave function peaks up, it gets pulled down again. Right? It can't stay up. But if you have very low curvature toward the baseline, very low kinetic energy, then it could go up and you don't mind.

Speaker 2:          36:21          Okay.

Speaker 1:          36:21          Cause the Connecticut, you don't need much curvature when the wave function is big. Okay. So it's like that. And then out in here it's pretty much like an exponential decay. Does that surprise you Kate? You look like it didn't surprise you. Why not? When do you, when do you expect the wave function to be an exponential decay

Speaker 2:          36:46          under what condition can't hear very well is constantly.

Speaker 1:          36:52          Oh, when the potential energy is constant and, and what else? To be exponential stop sign wave is also constantly,

Speaker 2:          37:02          right.

Speaker 1:          37:03          What makes an exponential rather than a sine wave? Yeah. Ah, the kinetic energy is negative. Potential is higher than total, but that's exactly the case on the right, right. Because there's the potential, there is the total and the kinetic energy is going down. It's negative. The difference between the two. Okay. Now here are a whole bunch of these for, for the, uh, harmonic costs for the Morse potential. How does it look different from the hook's law? Does the spacing of energies look the same as it did and Hooke's law? Again, it's zero nodes, one, two, three, four and so on. But how is it different?

Speaker 2:          37:51          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          37:53          Ah, the spacing gets closer as you go up. So real bonds, which have a potential that looks more like this than like a spring. We'll have their energy levels get closer as you get more and more vibrational energy. Okay. They're not evenly spaced as they are for Hooke's law, the energy increases along with a number of nodes. The well widens more than it would for Hooke's law parabola. So the wavelengths become longer. Those nodes are spaced over a bigger distance. Right. And the energies are lower than expected for Hooke's law because you don't have as much curvature. You have the same number of nodes. The like the 18th level has the same number of nodes that would in Hooke's law, but they're spaced over a wider distance. Right. So there's less curvature so the energy doesn't go up as much. Okay. Now this is interesting.

Speaker 1:          38:50          Look, if you have the blue energy right now, the wave function looks like this, it's no longer bounded. Does it surprise you that the wave function goes on out to infinity when the, uh, when the total energy is higher than the, than that potential energy if the right, no, it means you have enough energy to break the bond so the particle could just keep going. Okay. Now what does this look like in this region? It looks like it does in a Hooke's law or something like that, more or less. What does it look like out at the right?

Speaker 1:          39:27          It's a sine wave. Why Sam? Does that surprise you? That looks like a sine wave. The potential is constant, effectively constant out there and lower than the total. So it's a constant, it's about a sine wave because you have a constant positive kinetic energy when the total energy is above that dissociation limit. So there's the potential, there's the total, and now the kinetic energy is positive and about constant, so it's approximately a sine wave. Okay. Now, Coolum beach potential is a more complicated one. The reason it's complicated is the energy goes to infinity. When our becomes zero, when the positive and the negative are on top of one another, it becomes infinitely favorable. So it's hard to do this numerically and the program will screw up. Sometimes when you try to do cool omic potential, but here's a, and it's one dimensional and that it turns out curiously enough that this system is simpler in three dimensions than in one dimension for Coolum.

Speaker 1:          40:30          Big potential. Don't worry about the technical aspects of that. But at any rate, this is using the program for that. And you can see that that the lowest that you have very, very high curvature when you get near zero because you have such high kinetic energy when the particles get very close to one another and the, because the urban program is approximate taking finite steps, you get in trouble often. Okay. But anyhow, you get the idea that again, as you get a higher energy, you get, uh, you get waves that spread out and they spread out a lot for the same reason they did in Morse potential. Although here we're using a much lighter mass. We're using an electron, right? But it spreads out much more because the well spreads out so much. Okay. So higher levels spread way out. And now the sequence of energies, here's the lowest, the next and the next.

Speaker 1:          41:30          They have a big spacing first and it gets much, much smaller. It turns out that the energy is some constant divided by n squared. So the number one, uh, level has an energy of minus k. The next one is minus one fourth k. It's only the Blue Line is only uh, only a fourth as far down as the green from zero, which is up at the top. Is it? Well it's the zero is that gray line at the top right? Cause it keeps going out to zero, far out there. And the next one is one ninth of the way from, from the top to the lowest level.

Speaker 1:          42:12          So the reward for finding side was the knowledge of everything we've seen the allowed to energy and structure. Now we're going to see another case where we get structure and we also see something about dynamics that's interesting about the motion of the atoms. So here's suppose this is a high, a proton attached to a bar by a bond to something that's heavy. So the other, the heavy thing doesn't move. The hydrogen does the moving. Okay. And here's it's wave function. This is the re, this is the bond to distance. The minimum energy. If you stretch the bond, the energy goes up. If you compress the bond, the energy goes up. And that's the way you function for the position of the hydrogen atom

Speaker 3:          42:52          right

Speaker 1:          42:53          now. Suppose we increase the mass and instead of talking about a hydrogen atom, we talked about a carbon atom, which had a say 14. Okay. Depending on what isotope we're using, suppose we went to 14. How is that going to change things? If we have mass it can we use the same function? If we use mass of 14 notice that we're having, we're using the same potential. So the kinetic energy at any point is going to be the same for the two. How does mass enter into kinetic energy?

Speaker 3:          43:31          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          43:32          Yup. Okay. Here's, why do you say it would be more concentrated? What would make it more constantly? They're tired, so yeah, but you're not thinking about quantum mechanics. You're thinking that the higher, uh, well no, wait a second. We're not talking nuclear charge here. All we're talking to his mass. It's held by a spring. We're thinking, okay, so the electrostatics doesn't come into it. It's a spring. That's stretching Elizabeth, please. Yeah. The kinetic energy has won over mass in it. So if you increase the mass and keep the same wave, what are you going to do to the energy? You're going to decrease the energy, but it's the same energy as it was for hydrogen. You can't just decrease the energy right at a given position if you know the total. Okay. So you want it to be, uh, you want it to be, to get the same energy, it has to be more curved.

Speaker 1:          44:48          Okay. Everybody with me to be, to have the same energy. If you have a bigger mass in the denominator, you're going to have to have more curvature, 14 times as much curvature to compensate for the bigger mass. So it's going to curve more toward the baseline. Okay. So if we use that same energy and had the higher maths, so we got more curvature for the same energy, then it's going to curve a lot more. It's going to go through and go up to infinity and it, it's, it's even higher energy. Then the second wave would be it's curved way too much. So how would you find the lowest energy? What would you do in your guessing? If you wanted to find the lowest energy, what would you do? You'd lower your guests to make it less curved towards the baseline. Okay. Then if you do that, so lower the energy if your math and there, we've got the answer right. So hydrogen has a much higher vibrational energy than carbon does for the same bond to get the lowest energy.

Speaker 3:          45:54          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          45:56          I think this will be clear to you when you have time to think about it. If not, ask questions right now. What have you had you to 35 or a marble at the end of the same spring? What do you think gets wave function would look like?

Speaker 1:          46:17          The lowest energy wave function, it's just the spike. The heavier it is, the narrower it yet, right? So if you have something like the baseball held by a bond, right? It's going to sit right there. You're not going to be able to see that it's spread out. Electrons are so much lighter than the nuclei. Electrons really spread out. Okay? Now. So there are the probability distributions for hydrogen and for carbon held by a single bond. Why is their average not in the same position? See what I mean is acceleration. Acceleration has to do with me. Yes. No, it has to do. Yeah. You guys, the electrodes are not attracted. No, no. It's w remember electrons aren't entering into this. We're just supposing that we have a nucleus held by a spring and that spring is the strength of a single bond. Okay. What's the potential? What is the potential for a bond?

Speaker 1:          47:27          Is it Hooke's law? What's a better potential for a bond on Hooke's law? The Morris potential, which broadens out, remember as it goes up. So since hydrogen goes up more, it samples further out to the right. So what's the splice to the right from the, from the carbon. Okay. Now, so let's, here they are at their minimum energy position and they vibrate. The higher energy has shifted to the right and the unsymmetrical Morris potential and that here's the half maximum of the problem. So it spends, this is it's half as probable that the probability density here is half what it is there. So when you say how far does it spread out? This, this thing goes out to infinity, but we can talk about how wide it is by say how, why did, does it half height. So the hydrogen had half height is from, from here to here, uh, from, from, from here to here. But the carbon had half height is only from there to there. That is, if you think of these things vibrating, the hydrogen has a bigger amplitude than carbon because it's lighter. So the hydrogen vibrates by 0.1 on strum 9% of the distance, the carbon vibrates only half as much. 3% of the carbon x distance. Okay. Just because of the mass difference. And never, we said before last time that typically the atoms are vibrating by about 0.05, uh, Armstrong's in the crystal. That's where this came from is this quantum mechanical thing. That's the least that they can pop in when they're in their lowest possible energy state. They vibrate by that much.

Speaker 4:          49:25          Right.

Speaker 1:          49:25          And that's how much it is. That little yellow dot after it shrank. So we've seen allowed energies and structure. We've seen dynamics, the vibration. Now next time we're going to look at dynamics and also the payoff bonding, how we understand bonding, and one dimension.
