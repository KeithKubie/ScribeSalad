00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.630
The number one question on the
mind of every organism on earth,

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:05.589
if that organism
happens to have a mind,

00:00:05.589 --> 00:00:08.370
is: how do I make more of myself?

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.940
It's bigger than all
the other questions combined,

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:12.910
including how am I
going to feed myself?

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:14.349
And what's the meaning of life?

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:16.570
Because, from a
biological perspective,

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.269
we know what the meaning of life is.

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:21.590
Biology has answered that question.
It's reproduction.

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.410
Different organisms go about
reproducing in different ways:

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.109
You can make more of
yourself by yourself,

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:28.179
a strategy called
asexual reproduction,

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:30.720
OR you can team up with somebody
else and make a baby that's

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.510
genetically different than both
of you through sexual reproduction.

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.870
From liver flukes to pine trees,
99% of the eukaryotic organisms

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.280
on earth use sex to reproduce,
at least some of the time,

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.370
because by creating offspring
with a slightly different genome,

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.110
helps the new generation
stay one step ahead

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.360
of pathogens or competitors.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.539
Or if you're the pathogen,
it helps you stay ahead

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.050
of that pesky host that's
always trying to kick you out.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.359
But still, sex is inconvenient
and it's a lot of work:

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:56.410
First you have to find somebody
to mate with, which means

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.859
you have to get out of bed
and brush your teeth and stuff.

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.980
Then, if you're an animal, you have
to find somebody who's willing

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.320
to mate with you, and then
figure out whether he or she

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.660
is going to provide higher or
lower quality genes than yours.

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.610
Thankfully, and unsurprisingly,
animals' reproductive systems have

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.400
evolved to streamline all of
those inconveniences to address one,

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.230
and only one, aim: to get your
sex cells where they need to be.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:24.620
So, sex. How does it work?

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.950
I thought you'd never ask.

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.630
Reproductive systems, like all the
other systems we've discussed,

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.560
take on an incredible diversity
within the kingdom Animalia.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.040
For instance, some female spiders
mate with a bunch of different

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.750
males and stash their sperm
in different storage units.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.400
When she's ready to fertilize
her eggs, the female spider

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.250
will choose which male
spider she liked the best

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.610
and let his sperm out the
storage unit to fertilize her eggs!

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.780
Hyenas, meanwhile, have
female-dominated social system,

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.860
and it's the alpha female who
chooses who she mates with.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.170
And she has sex using an enlarged
sensitive sex organ, a clitoris,

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.890
that looks exactly like a
penis, called a pseudopenis.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.410
And a duck's penis can be a
quarter of the length of its body,

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:08.800
and shaped like a corkscrew.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.600
Want to know why? Look it up!
Actually don't!

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.500
Google that with care!
Just don't press play on the video.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.080
The point here is that while the
delivery systems may be somewhat

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.160
different from animal to animal,
the fundamentals are the same.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.810
In order to do the sex, an organism
needs to find another of its

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.310
species that has a
different type of gamete,

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:29.780
or sex cell, than their own.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.930
Gametes, you'll recall, are haploid
cells, meaning they have only one

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.370
set of chromosomes, and they're
formed by the process of meiosis.

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.280
And there are only two kinds of
gametes: One is the ovum, or egg.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.230
In plants it's called an ovule.

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.350
The egg is always a large cell that
takes a lot of time and energy

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.400
investment to make, and
it's usually not very mobile.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.150
The other type of gamete, sperm,
are smaller, a lot more plentiful,

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.540
easy to make, and always
more mobile than eggs.

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.290
Most animals have either one
or the other type of gamete,

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.670
though hermaphroditic species,
like garden snails

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.130
and some flowering plants,
can produce both.

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.380
In the magical moment that
one of these sperm finds

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.990
one of those eggs, the two
fuse together to create

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.090
a single diploid cell that
has all of the instructions

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.720
to make a new seahorse or
secretary bird or whatever it is.

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.600
But let me get your mind right
about what we really mean

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.260
when we talk about sex.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.450
Because we humans have external
sex organs, called genitals, we tend

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.130
to think of them as key indicators
of who's male and who's female.

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.340
But the fact is, genitals
are only one byproduct

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.880
of a much, much more important
and fundamental distinction:

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.459
From a biological perspective,
the only thing that makes sexes

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:38.569
different is that females produce
big, not very mobile gametes,

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:41.900
and the males make smaller,
much more mobile gametes.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.020
Across the spectrum of all things
that reproduce sexually, that's

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.600
pretty much the only consistent
difference between boys and girls.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.319
Therefore, all reproductive
systems and reproductive behavior

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:54.569
are designed entirely around
the production, storage,

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:56.450
and delivery of these gametes.

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.680
For instance, because sperm are
really mobile, males within a species

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.709
are generally the more mobile ones
who go out to find a mate.

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:05.910
This is even true for plants:
female gametes of a flowering plant

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.020
generally stay in one place while
the pollen, which ends up producing

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.840
the sperm, gets picked up by a
pollinator, or sometimes just sprays

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.000
out every which way in the wind,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.139
hoping to bump into the
right kind of ovule.

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:19.340
In animals, we see all
kinds of crazy behaviors

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:20.209
where mating is concerned.

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.750
And of course not every animal
goes about courtship in the same way,

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.040
but one thing is pretty consistent:
Females tend to be pickier

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.100
about the quality of their mates,
because while a male animal could

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.280
conceivably fertilize thousands
of eggs every year,

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.460
a female has only a
limited number of eggs,

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.660
and she's spent a lot
of energy developing them,

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.340
so she wants them to be fertilized
with high quality genes.

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.490
Plus, in cases where both parents
stay together after fertilization,

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.500
she also wants those genes to be
attached to a high-quality provider.

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.930
This often results in males
having to do a lot of showing off

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.190
in order to get a lady's attention.

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.910
Males of a species are generally
louder, larger, brighter,

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:55.889
more combative than the females.

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:56.780
Basically, they're
putting on a big show

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.280
so the females can size up how
awesome that guy's genes are.

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.930
But for all those differences,
during the development of the embryo,

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.030
there are actually very
few physical differences

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.560
between males and females,
at least at first.

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.240
You and I, we didn't start out
being a male or a female.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.550
While you were hanging
out in our mom's uteri,

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:15.639
you didn't have a sex at
all until about two months.

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:19.120
Before that, we had all the pieces
to become either male or female,

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.810
but our genes hadn't gotten together
to determine whether or not

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.090
our gonads, the glands
that make the gametes,

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.410
were going to become
ovaries or testes.

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:29.330
In mammals, that decision is made
by the sex-determining chromosome:

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.000
If an offspring has two of the
same kind of sex-determining

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.419
chromosome, called XX,
it will be female.

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:38.160
And if it has two different
chromosomes, XY, it will be male.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.610
The same is true for some other
animals like fruit flies,

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:42.750
and even some plants
like Gingko trees.

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:45.070
However, the opposite
is true for birds:

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.530
boy birds have XX and
girl birds have XY.

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:48.270
Go figure.

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.360
In mammals, the default setting
for sex is always female.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.790
Absent a signal from
the Y chromosome,

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:56.940
ovaries form and begin working
on developing female structures.

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.440
If there is a Y, the ovaries
instead form into testes,

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.210
and parts that would be female
turn into male structures,

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:05.810
for instance, the clitoris I
mentioned, which is sensitive

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:09.150
and has spongy tissue in it,
actually becomes part of a penis.

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:11.000
But it's worth pointing
out that by this time,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.169
some features are already in place
before the sex is determined.

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:16.889
Nipples, for instance,
form before this point,

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:20.260
so that's why men have them,
even though they don't do anything.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.830
Now, once the sex is determined,
the ovaries and testes

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:24.540
pump out estrogen and testosterone.

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:28.010
Meanwhile, the brain is
growing and creating receptors,

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:30.620
organized differently in males
and females, that will later

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.970
determine how both estrogen and
testosterone are used in the body.

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:37.120
Soon after a baby girl is born,
she'll have half-formed versions

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.770
of all the eggs she's ever
going to have for her whole life,

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:42.729
then at puberty, once a month,

00:06:42.729 --> 00:06:45.130
one of those eggs will finish
forming and be released.

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:47.590
But for baby boys, the
sperm-making does not begin

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:48.250
until around puberty.

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:50.270
Most of the time when a young
animal starts getting close

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:53.780
to sexual maturity, secondary
sex characteristics crop up:

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:56.220
In humans more body hair appears,
boys all of a sudden develop

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:59.169
facial hair, while both
sexes get more pubic hair.

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:02.180
Also muscle and fat get
redistributed around the body,

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:03.800
the most obvious
example being breasts.

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.410
In other animals, secondary sex
characteristics include things

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:09.900
like manes on male lions,
a big old funky rack of feathers

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:12.949
on male peacocks,
antlers on male deer.

00:07:12.949 --> 00:07:14.030
Males really have
the market cornered

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:16.380
on fancy, showy
secondary sex characteristics.

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:18.699
So, by the time an animal
has reached sexual maturity,

00:07:18.699 --> 00:07:21.830
the males and females of a species
often look pretty dissimilar.

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:24.440
Not just of each other,
but of their previous

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.330
non-sexually-developed forms.

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:28.759
Basically showing the world that
their different reproductive

00:07:28.759 --> 00:07:32.430
structures that they were born with
are now in full gear, and they've

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:35.630
got some really different jobs to
do, based on what sex they are.

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:38.690
So let's go over how this
all works with human people.

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:40.630
And of course, ladies first.

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:43.960
As you know, the gonads of a female
embryo turn into two ovaries,

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.650
one on either side of the
uterus, with its oviducts,

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:48.990
or fallopian tubes,
reaching out toward them.

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:51.759
The ovaries are where those
precious eggs are kept.

00:07:51.759 --> 00:07:54.400
Maybe the biggest difference
between women's and men's

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:57.150
reproductive set-up is that
women have a menstrual cycle,

00:07:57.150 --> 00:08:01.259
typically a four-week process in
which one egg matures in an ovary

00:08:01.259 --> 00:08:03.860
and is released to be
drawn into the fallopian tubes,

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:05.419
a process called ovulation.

00:08:05.419 --> 00:08:07.660
If, while the egg makes
its way down the fallopian tube

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:11.520
to the uterus, a sperm finds it and
fertilizes it, there's a chance

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:14.250
that the fertilized egg
will implant on the endometrium,

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:18.330
a tissue layer inside the wall
of the uterus and a baby will grow.

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:20.870
However, it's estimated that
up to 70% of fertilized eggs

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:22.520
don't take hold in the endometrium.

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:24.610
This could be because women's
bodies have sort of a built-in

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:26.960
genetic testing: If something's
suspected to be wrong with the

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:29.690
growing embryo, the lining of her
uterus that she's built up over

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:33.209
the past month will shed, and the
woman will menstruate as usual.

00:08:33.209 --> 00:08:35.599
This material leaves the female
reproductive system through the

00:08:35.599 --> 00:08:38.569
narrow lower end of the
uterus, the cervix,

00:08:38.569 --> 00:08:41.360
and then out into the muscle-lined
tract of the vagina,

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.610
and those are of course the same
structures through which

00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:46.350
a newborn baby passes and
through which the sperm enter.

00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:49.300
While a woman's body is busy all
month developing the next egg,

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:52.499
getting it ready for fertilization,
and shedding her uterine lining

00:08:52.499 --> 00:08:56.550
if it's not fertilized, males are
undergoing a completely different

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:58.300
process that calls on a lot of

00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:00.480
other highly specialized
reproductive structures.

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:03.220
We start of course, with the testes,
which are made up largely

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:06.920
of a bunch of coiled tubes
called seminiferous tubules,

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:08.619
which are where the sperm form.

00:09:08.619 --> 00:09:12.009
Unlike a woman's ovaries,
the testes are outside of the body,

00:09:12.009 --> 00:09:14.059
because in order to make sperm,
they have to be kept

00:09:14.059 --> 00:09:17.899
at a specific temperature,
usually about 2 degrees celsius

00:09:17.899 --> 00:09:19.449
cooler than inside
of the body cavity.

00:09:19.449 --> 00:09:22.439
For that reason, the testes are
kept in a pouch called a scrotum

00:09:22.439 --> 00:09:24.540
that's in charge of keeping
the testes at the perfect

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:25.790
sperm-making temperature.

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:28.389
After being produced in the testes,
human sperm spend about 3 weeks

00:09:28.389 --> 00:09:30.970
coiled in tubes in the
scrotum called the epididymis,

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:33.649
and that's where they
mature and grow flagella,

00:09:33.649 --> 00:09:35.990
the little whip-like tails
sperm are so famous for

00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:38.350
and which make them able
to move around and swim.

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:41.639
Now the sperm stay here until
they're ready to leave the body,

00:09:41.639 --> 00:09:43.980
so before we, or they,
can go any further,

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:46.319
we have to set
the stage for that.

00:09:46.319 --> 00:09:48.629
As you know, in humans
and some other animals,

00:09:48.629 --> 00:09:51.160
the penis usually sits around,
not doing much except

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:53.929
for letting urine out of
the bladder from time to time.

00:09:53.929 --> 00:09:56.790
But every so often a male
realizes that he's totally going

00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:58.379
to get the chance to mate!

00:09:58.379 --> 00:10:00.329
At this point,
spongy tissue in the penis

00:10:00.329 --> 00:10:02.540
fills with blood, and BAM, erection!

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:04.869
Some animals like raccoons,
whales and walruses actually

00:10:04.869 --> 00:10:07.739
have a literal bone in their
penis to help the erection along.

00:10:07.739 --> 00:10:10.879
But either way, the point is to
allow the penis to enter the vagina,

00:10:10.879 --> 00:10:12.249
which scientists call coitus,

00:10:12.249 --> 00:10:14.679
and deposit the sperm
he's put so much into making.

00:10:14.679 --> 00:10:17.449
These sperm travel in
a special fluid, semen,

00:10:17.449 --> 00:10:20.029
whose ingredients aren't combined
until they're ready to be released

00:10:20.029 --> 00:10:23.879
by a series of muscular
contractions that cause emission,

00:10:23.879 --> 00:10:26.069
more commonly known as ejaculation.

00:10:26.069 --> 00:10:28.459
At this point, the contractions
carry the mature sperm

00:10:28.459 --> 00:10:31.459
from the epididymis,
through two muscular ducts called

00:10:31.459 --> 00:10:34.509
the vas deferens,
which carry them up from the testes,

00:10:34.509 --> 00:10:38.149
up and over the bladder,
and down past the seminal vesicles.

00:10:38.149 --> 00:10:40.660
Here, with contributions from
the nearby prostate gland,

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:43.129
they pick up a bunch of
fluid that contains mucus,

00:10:43.129 --> 00:10:46.110
coagulating enzyme, ascorbic acid
and sugars that the sperm

00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:47.429
are going to need for their trip.

00:10:47.429 --> 00:10:50.309
Now the semen is complete,
and it travels down

00:10:50.309 --> 00:10:53.980
the short ejaculatory ducts to
the urethra to be released

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:57.129
at the end of the penis,
where if the timing is right,

00:10:57.129 --> 00:11:00.480
one among the hundreds of millions
of sperm in that emission

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:03.059
can find and fertilize an egg.

00:11:03.059 --> 00:11:07.040
That, my friends,
is how we all get our start.

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:10.550
To find out, or to remind yourself,
what happens after fertilization,

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:13.959
you can always check out this
video on embryonic development.

00:11:13.959 --> 00:11:17.949
But, fittingly enough, this
wonderful beginning marks the end

00:11:17.949 --> 00:11:20.249
of our treatment of
the Animal Kingdom.

00:11:20.249 --> 00:11:22.439
Please join us next
week when we go deeper

00:11:22.439 --> 00:11:26.040
into the other kingdoms
that we share this planet with

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:27.699
the bacteria, archaea and protists.

00:11:27.699 --> 00:11:30.649
Thank you as always for
watching Crash Course Biology.

00:11:30.649 --> 00:11:34.209
If there's any sex stuff
that you want to go over again,

00:11:34.209 --> 00:11:35.980
there's a table of contents.

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:38.699
Thanks to everyone who
helped make this video,

00:11:38.699 --> 00:11:41.730
especially to Amber for
illustrating all of those gonads.

00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:44.239
