JAZYMN BLACKBURN: I'm interested 
in sociology because I'm

00:00:04.057 --> 00:00:06.500
interested in animal behavior.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.470
I've always studied animal
behavior on my own growing up,

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:11.624
and then I became interested
in people behavior.

00:00:11.624 --> 00:00:13.290
So, I'm interested
in studying sociology

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.256
so I can understand society as
a working ecosystem of people.

00:00:18.256 --> 00:00:19.880
I'm Jazmyn Blackburn,

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.420
I'm in the Class of 2019,
I'm studying sociology.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.640
My academics do really do
supplement my service work

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:29.858
in really interesting ways.

00:00:29.858 --> 00:00:32.210
So, I do pursue classes
that I feel align

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.220
with my philosophy in education.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.090
I want to be able to educate
the next generation of youth

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:39.889
to help them find their place.

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:42.430
Princeton Nursery School is a
community partner with the Pace

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.000
Center through Community House.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.920
Since my freshman year, I've
been involved as a volunteer

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.440
and then I became
the project leader

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.993
for the Princeton Nursery School
Program and the connection

00:00:50.993 --> 00:00:52.220
with the University.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.480
So I bring volunteers,
I recruit volunteers,

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.500
get them engaged
in the community,

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.210
help support parents and
teachers in bringing up

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.567
these really amazing children
that go to the nursery school,

00:01:02.567 --> 00:01:04.400
and that's a project
that I hope to continue

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.941
for the rest of my
time at Princeton.

00:01:05.941 --> 00:01:09.090
See all-- so all the
black is the water, right?

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.259
That's a lot of water, and
then all the white is the land.

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:17.800
I think that early 
childhood is definitely

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.495
a very influential time
in a person's life.

00:01:21.495 --> 00:01:23.230
But, what I really
treasure about working

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.880
with young children is that
they have this capacity to them

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.469
to learn just about anything.

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:30.010
And they have their
whole life really

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.530
to fulfill who they're
going to become.

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.390
It's really an
incredible feeling

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.970
when you see a child
very early on who

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.630
has very primary
perceptions of the world

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.610
and just being able
to build on those

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.130
throughout their entire life.

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.358
Does it make a sound?

00:01:45.358 --> 00:01:47.470
CHILD: There's not enough land here.

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:48.771
JAZYMN BLACKBURN: 
Not enough land yet.

00:01:48.771 --> 00:01:50.270
My goal is really

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.040
to leave a legacy Princeton
for future project leaders

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.640
and the connection, the bond
between this community partner

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.774
and the Pace Center.

00:01:58.774 --> 00:02:00.190
I think that it's
really important

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.540
that encounters of service
don't just happen and disappear,

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.180
but that they're perpetuated,
and honestly I'd

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.970
love to see some of the
children I worked with in five

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.680
or 10 years and
hear their stories

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.740
and hear how they're doing.
