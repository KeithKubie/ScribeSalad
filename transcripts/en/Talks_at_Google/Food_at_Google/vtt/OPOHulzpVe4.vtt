[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:07.940
SPEAKER: Chef Hewitt,
executive chef

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:10.470
of Chartreuse Kitchen
and Cocktails in Midtown,

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:12.714
and Michelle, farm manager?

00:00:12.714 --> 00:00:13.380
Is that correct?

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.787
Cool-- at Recovery Park Farms.

00:00:14.787 --> 00:00:17.120
I think I told do this, but
I grew up on a farm in Ohio.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.570
Did I mention that?

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:18.870
MICHELLE LUTZ: No, you didn't.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:19.150
That's great.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:20.233
SPEAKER: Yeah, a farm boy.

00:00:20.233 --> 00:00:21.054
Yep.

00:00:21.054 --> 00:00:22.470
You guys were both
born in Detroit

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.260
and have spent most of your
lives working in southeastern

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.070
Michigan, which is fantastic.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:28.919
We'll hear a lot
more about that.

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:30.960
You guys both have incredibly
interesting stories

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.210
individually, which we'll
definitely hear today,

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.500
but I think what's
really interesting is

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.300
how you guys have kind
of brought your careers

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.330
and businesses together.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.720
So again, we'll talk about
each individually, and then

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.261
kind of bring things
together once we

00:00:41.261 --> 00:00:42.450
grab that snack in between.

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.730
So Google Detroit,
please welcome

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.280
Chef Doug Hewitt
and Michelle Lutz.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.140
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:50.650
Awesome.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.831
So Chef, let's start with you.

00:00:52.831 --> 00:00:54.330
We've had a lot of
interesting chefs

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.730
join us in this office
throughout the Talks at Google

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.200
program nationally.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.779
You saw a few that have been to
our office just a minute ago.

00:01:00.779 --> 00:01:01.320
I don't know.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.540
I feel like a big hit is
always just kind of hearing

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.120
a little bit about your
background and, I guess,

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.250
how you got into
this passion for food

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.410
and what really kind of
set you on your path,

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.532
and maybe we'll start there.

00:01:12.532 --> 00:01:14.490
DOUGLAS HEWITT: Yeah,
you want the long version

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.720
or the short version?

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.760
SPEAKER: Well, we've got
about 50 minutes now.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.610
You can run with it however you
like within that time frame.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.776
DOUGLAS HEWITT: Yeah, so
pretty much, like you said,

00:01:22.776 --> 00:01:24.540
I grew up in Detroit--

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.410
not my whole life, but
my dad was a city cop.

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.970
So when he retired, we
moved out to a little town

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.410
called Howell,
which, at the time,

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.360
was literally like moving--

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.486
like I felt like to Nebraska.

00:01:38.486 --> 00:01:39.360
You know what I mean?

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.760
There was like
one traffic light,

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.410
nothing but corn and stuff
like that, so it was crazy.

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.270
So that's kind of like
culture shock for me.

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.872
And the first part, first
time seeing a snake, frog,

00:01:49.872 --> 00:01:50.830
and that kind of stuff.

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.150
So just different
life than the city.

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.630
But I loved it, so I got kind
of involved in farms and and

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.300
playing golf, and
like most chefs,

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.850
I started washing
dishes at a golf course

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.530
to play for free
with all my buddies.

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.139
And then it was
kind of something

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:14.370
that I took interest in,
and I was big into sports,

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.470
but I just sucked at them all.

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.050
So there was no
career for me in any

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.360
of the sports I
really wanted to play,

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.670
so I, kind of being the
competitive guy that I am,

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.580
I kind of like found
sort of a niche

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.080
in this competitive
environment of food.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.560
And then I decided to
give school a shot.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.402
And then the passion started
to grow and grow and grow.

00:02:35.402 --> 00:02:39.210
And that's pretty much the
short side of things there.

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:43.200
SPEAKER: So what was your
first kind of soiree into--

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.330
you mentioned the country
club or the golf course,

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.700
working there, getting
the free access

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.784
to golf, which I think
some people in the audience

00:02:49.784 --> 00:02:50.908
actually do that right now.

00:02:50.908 --> 00:02:52.320
They wash dishes for free golf.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.780
We're a big golf office here.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.360
What was your first
kind of official move

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.480
into preparing food and
working within the kitchen?

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.590
How is that process
kind of from the back

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.410
of the kitchen into starting to
actually cook food and prepare

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:08.090
food?

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.180
DOUGLAS HEWITT: Yeah, so being--

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.930
the way it was set up,
the dishwasher line

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:13.980
was like sort of--

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.200
like behind me was
the hot line, so a lot

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.810
of swearing and flames and
communication and just a lot

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.020
of controlled chaos,
I think, is the term

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.240
that a lot of
industry people use.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.790
So it was just something I
thought I had to be a part of.

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.530
And luckily for me,
I got an opportunity.

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.510
The club we were at,
you went from dishwasher

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.218
to prep cook, which
means you just peeled

00:03:35.218 --> 00:03:37.710
carrots all day for weddings
and stuff like that.

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:39.120
I got to skip that
point to start

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.720
doing dinner service on the
grill with some guys that

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.080
brought me up and really showed
me what they knew at the time.

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.610
And at the time, I
thought I knew a lot.

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.330
But then sort of culinary school
sort of bored me in a way.

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.360
I think the first time,
I was like, oh, no.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.810
I took a job at the
casino in Mount Pleasant.

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.130
And that was my first
experience of just ass whooping

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:10.850
every night, four
cigarettes in the car

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:14.631
before I walked in,
just like freaking out.

00:04:14.631 --> 00:04:16.089
And that was the
first moment where

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:18.740
I had to decide whether if
I'm going to accept this pain,

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:21.850
If I'm going to do this, I'm
not going to be miserable

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:23.420
when a table walks
in at 10 o'clock,

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:24.670
and I want to get out of here.

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:25.610
So it's kind of my--

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.959
like my come to Jesus that
I had with myself was, look,

00:04:29.959 --> 00:04:31.375
if I'm going to
do this, I'm going

00:04:31.375 --> 00:04:32.680
to have a better outlook on it.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.740
I'm going to have a
better attitude about it.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.180
These things are
going to happen.

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.470
And from that point forward
is when I started to--

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.300
all the things that
were happening-- there

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.409
is information around
us all the time.

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:45.200
That was the first time
I was able to start

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.820
absorbing everything.

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:51.280
And from that point on, I
was on quite a fast pace

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.820
at being my own chef
from that point on.

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.240
First, I had my first
executive chef job

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.527
at 23 coming back
from that place,

00:04:59.527 --> 00:05:00.860
and I haven't looked back since.

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.235
I've had my own
restaurant since,

00:05:02.235 --> 00:05:05.110
and I've been pretty fortunate.

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:06.110
SPEAKER: That's awesome.

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:07.820
I think what-- and
you touched on it--

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.465
I'd like to go into your first
kind of restaurant experience.

00:05:10.465 --> 00:05:11.840
I know you were
working in Dexter

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.350
for several years with
your own kind of spot,

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.510
again, starting at age
23, which is incredible.

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:20.500
Before we skip over the
part that you teased a bit,

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.690
I think one thing we'd like to
hear here, and a lot of folks

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:25.940
do, is you go to a restaurant,
and it's always so calm

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.190
and collected in the front.

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.480
The dining area is
so quiet and chill,

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.577
and everyone's having
a nice kind of time.

00:05:31.577 --> 00:05:33.410
All of the chefs that
we have come in always

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:37.310
tell us these crazy stories
of knives being thrown

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:40.640
and people lighting things
on fire in the back.

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.120
What's that contrast like?

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.330
How do you kind of learn--

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.577
like you just mentioned
smoking four cigarettes

00:05:45.577 --> 00:05:47.660
before you go in just to
kind of calm your nerves.

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.640
Like it's crazy kind
of the ecosystem

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.087
that occurs behind the
doors of the kitchen.

00:05:52.087 --> 00:05:53.420
DOUGLAS HEWITT: Yeah, there is--

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:55.070
it's weird.

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:57.500
That was kind of my previous
life, but even at times now,

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.083
I mean if anyone's
been to Chartreuse,

00:05:59.083 --> 00:06:01.820
you know that we are very
much out in the open.

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.592
So we're basically--
people are sometimes

00:06:04.592 --> 00:06:06.050
dining right in
front of our paths,

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:07.091
where the food is coming.

00:06:07.091 --> 00:06:09.680
So the Yelpers are
controlled these days,

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:14.130
or I really hope
to control them.

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:16.190
But yeah, it's true.

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:20.790
In the back of the house,
we're a different bunch.

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:22.760
And there's-- in the
back of the house,

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:27.140
you see just all sorts
of different individuals,

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:32.619
whether it be background or how
they grew up or just flat out

00:06:32.619 --> 00:06:34.910
who they really are, probably
people you would never be

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:39.410
friends with if it were a social
setting or maybe a high school

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:43.430
setting or even just
neighbor setting.

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:45.020
Some of my closest
friends to this day

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:48.230
are people that we have
zero in common outside

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:51.660
of our passion for this and foul
language and stuff like that,

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:52.730
but you really start to--

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:56.810
you really start to see
who really people are.

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:59.330
And food is a way to
bring everybody together,

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:02.920
so outside of--

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:05.470
there have been some
outbursts, I'm sure.

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:09.480
But I've never dodged a knife or
almost been hit with a potato,

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:14.410
or I've got plenty of burns
from people burning me,

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:16.250
not intentionally, or
maybe intentionally.

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:18.130
I'm not really sure.

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:22.660
But yeah, it is a
rowdy environment,

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:26.920
but I think as long as
it's a positive rowdiness,

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.744
I think it almost has to happen.

00:07:28.744 --> 00:07:29.410
You know I mean?

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:32.530
Think about before a football
team takes the field,

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:35.830
or there's these pep
talks and stuff like that.

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:37.990
You have to really keep
your energy level high,

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:40.750
because throughout
the dinner service,

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:43.565
you never really know
what's going to happen.

00:07:43.565 --> 00:07:44.440
You need to be alert.

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:47.590
You need to be ready
for the unthinkable.

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:49.900
So I think there has to be
this level of energy that

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:57.350
is probably much different
than any other job setting.

00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:59.470
And A, part of it
is personality,

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:02.287
but the other half is because we
need to keep that energy going.

00:08:02.287 --> 00:08:03.370
SPEAKER: Yeah, absolutely.

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:04.900
And a lot of chefs
that come in--

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:07.210
and you mentioned it too-- talk
about the competitive nature,

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:07.710
too.

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:10.600
There's a challenge every
night to making sure

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:12.380
that things go as
flawlessly as possible,

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:14.260
or at least if they
don't go flawlessly,

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.780
that the people in the dining
room don't know about it.

00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:18.488
How did you handle
that type of pressure?

00:08:18.488 --> 00:08:22.849
So you mentioned your first
full ownership of a kitchen

00:08:22.849 --> 00:08:24.890
was at the age of 23, and
you spent a lot of time

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:26.267
in that particular kitchen.

00:08:26.267 --> 00:08:28.100
How did you handle that
at such a young age?

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:30.641
I mean at the time, you probably
felt like you had the world,

00:08:30.641 --> 00:08:32.650
but looking back,
that's a young age

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:34.299
to have all of that
pressure on you.

00:08:34.299 --> 00:08:35.650
DOUGLAS HEWITT: Yeah, it is.

00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:37.570
And that's really where a lot
of the outbursts and stuff come

00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:40.153
from is when the pressure starts
to build and build and build,

00:08:40.153 --> 00:08:44.059
and even now, 13 years later,
the pressure's still there.

00:08:44.059 --> 00:08:47.710
And I think that's really
when people start cracking is

00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:49.540
there's just so much pressure.

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:52.410
The people around you, they have
to sort of feel that pressure.

00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:56.290
But they're not in
that position to handle

00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:57.980
the pressure for a reason.

00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:03.070
You need them to all be like
tools to sort of relieve

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:04.867
the pressure.

00:09:04.867 --> 00:09:06.950
Perhaps they go on to be
executive chefs and that,

00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:07.890
but a lot of times--

00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:10.730
so at a young age,
first of all, I

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:14.430
was lucky to hire some pretty
awesome people, some who

00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:17.520
are with me still to this day.

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:19.350
And my sous chef's
like 31 years old,

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:21.840
and he's been with me
for I think 11 years.

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:23.400
So pretty awesome.

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:25.680
But I just try to do it--

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:28.497
at that age, there is some ego.

00:09:28.497 --> 00:09:30.080
You think you've got
to figure it out.

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:31.620
It's pretty fucking bad ass.

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:32.490
I am, you know.

00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:39.330
But at the same time,
you're doing it with them.

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:40.750
Being that age and
being the chef,

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:42.499
it's not like, all
right, guys, mop it up.

00:09:42.499 --> 00:09:44.010
I'm out of here.

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:47.220
I drive a POS car
just like they do.

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:49.350
We're all broke.

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:50.230
You know what I mean?

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:52.110
So there was none
of that ego, and I

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:54.377
think that's how we
kind of did it together.

00:09:54.377 --> 00:09:55.710
We all came in at the same time.

00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:57.970
We left at the same time.

00:09:57.970 --> 00:10:00.665
And that was an environment
that they really wanted.

00:10:00.665 --> 00:10:02.040
We'd all been to
culinary school.

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:03.664
We've all worked for
other guys, and it

00:10:03.664 --> 00:10:06.911
was sort of that-- there
was sort of that this

00:10:06.911 --> 00:10:08.160
is the way the industry works.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:11.070
As I come in, Chef
bounces or all this stuff,

00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:13.320
and then I'm sort of left
to pick up all the pieces.

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:16.030
And it wasn't like that for us.

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:21.240
So we sort of created
this restaurant nucleus,

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:24.270
and many of us are still at it
to this day, if not with me,

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:25.170
doing other kitchens.

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:27.090
So I think that
was how we did it.

00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:28.810
We burnt a lot of food.

00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:30.600
We broke a lot of sauces.

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:35.000
We burnt a lot of sausage.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.080
Our first time in charcuterie,
we failed miserably.

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:41.600
Our prosciutto was always
molded the first couple times.

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:44.366
It was like we figured
it out together.

00:10:44.366 --> 00:10:45.240
So that's how it was.

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:48.920
So we basically just
created a family,

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:51.170
and we stuck together for
10 years in Ann Arbor,

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:53.642
and then four of us are
still in Detroit now, so.

00:10:53.642 --> 00:10:55.600
SPEAKER: Can you talk
about that transition now

00:10:55.600 --> 00:11:01.940
from running a kitchen in
Dexter to moving things

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:05.396
into downtown Detroit, midtown
Detroit with Chartreuse?

00:11:05.396 --> 00:11:07.520
And I think-- and correct
me if I have this wrong--

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:09.290
but I think there's a connection
to one of the chefs we've

00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:10.770
already had in, James
Rigato, in terms

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:11.910
of making an introduction.

00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:13.077
I'd love to hear about that.

00:11:13.077 --> 00:11:14.951
DOUGLAS HEWITT: Yeah,
so it's no secret James

00:11:14.951 --> 00:11:16.460
and I are really good friends.

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:17.990
We have been for
a very long time.

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:19.160
We both went to the
same high school,

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:20.201
grew up in the same town.

00:11:20.201 --> 00:11:21.680
Brendon Edwards, too, actually.

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:22.887
He's a Howell guy, too.

00:11:22.887 --> 00:11:24.470
SPEAKER: All the
good chefs in Detroit

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:25.570
are coming from
Howell, in case you're

00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:26.850
looking for the next big thing.

00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:27.630
Let's go check out Howell.

00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:29.588
DOUGLAS HEWITT: It's
like, what's in the water?

00:11:29.588 --> 00:11:30.196
Like nothing.

00:11:30.196 --> 00:11:32.570
I don't know if it was a lack
of salt growing up or what,

00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:36.370
but we all had to get out of
here and do something else.

00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:38.120
SPEAKER: James didn't
have the best things

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:39.300
to say about Howell either.

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:40.670
He was not very
uncensored about it,

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:41.520
so good chefs that
get out of there.

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:42.790
DOUGLAS HEWITT: Well, unlike
James, I like Howell--

00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:44.030
SPEAKER: That's
good to know, good.

00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:45.750
DOUGLAS HEWITT: --because
I still live there.

00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:47.375
That's where my house
is, so for now, I

00:11:47.375 --> 00:11:49.790
have to say things like that.

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:56.170
But yeah, I think if any of
you sat in the room with James,

00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:59.380
you already know there's a huge
difference between James and I.

00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:03.160
But there is a common bond, and
that's our friendship and food.

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:10.960
So from Ann Arbor, or Dexter--
excuse me-- come to Detroit.

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:13.460
So James is one of my
best customers out there,

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:14.710
and he kind of knew Doug food.

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:16.450
Like James has
probably eaten my food

00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:19.515
more than he's eaten
any other food,

00:12:19.515 --> 00:12:21.640
and I'm thankful for that,
because because of that,

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:23.056
a lot of opportunity
has happened.

00:12:23.056 --> 00:12:26.200
So he's the one that kind
of put Sandy and I together.

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:28.600
If you don't know,
Sandy Levine and I

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:31.950
are partners at Chartreuse.

00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:33.990
He owns the Oakland
Ferndale, so sort

00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:37.800
of like a speakeasy
cocktail bar kind of thing.

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:40.210
And he put us in contact
in saying he really wanted

00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:41.460
to get back in the restaurant.

00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:48.090
I really wanted to get back to
Detroit, and within two weeks,

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:50.190
we signed a lease.

00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:52.910
And nine months from that point
on, we opened a restaurant.

00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:55.597
And it's been pretty awesome.

00:12:55.597 --> 00:12:57.930
SPEAKER: How did you guys go
about the conceptualization

00:12:57.930 --> 00:12:59.910
of what Chartreuse has become?

00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:02.940
Was there a clear vision right
up front when you sat down

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:05.970
to speak with Sandy, or did
it take some time to develop?

00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:06.420
DOUGLAS HEWITT: Yeah, I think--

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:07.980
SPEAKER: Was it going to be
like a chicken wing restaurant,

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:08.370
and then all of a sudden--

00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:10.130
DOUGLAS HEWITT: No, no, no, no.

00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:13.830
No, it was very important
to me that I was

00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:16.172
able to do what I'm good at.

00:13:16.172 --> 00:13:17.880
Obviously, we all want
to be comfortable,

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:20.592
and especially when we're doing
such pride in stepping out

00:13:20.592 --> 00:13:22.050
of our comfort
zone, you really got

00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:24.580
to bring something
you're familiar with.

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:28.050
So it was really important to
me that I kept that sort of--

00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:30.600
I don't want to beat farm
to table in the face.

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:34.056
It's becoming sort
of a cliche in a way.

00:13:34.056 --> 00:13:35.430
But it was really
important to me

00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:38.280
that I could have the
relationship with the food,

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:40.260
I could touch the food.

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:44.430
We wanted a smaller joint,
because I don't really

00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:46.020
want to be a clipboard guy.

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:49.280
So I really want to
touch food every day.

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:52.340
I want to be a part
of what we're doing.

00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:56.750
So because of that-- and
obviously, being in Dexter,

00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:58.760
really, I was really
starting to get

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:02.360
a pretty good base of Dexter
farmers that I was using.

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:05.300
And that was really
addicting to me.

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:07.640
And being in Detroit, there's--

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:12.380
I'm able to get to so many
more places than Dexter.

00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:14.330
So that was really cool for me.

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:19.360
And then obviously, Chartreuse
being Sandy's favorite liqueur,

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:21.500
but you'll hear kind of
the story about Chartreuse

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:22.375
here in a little bit.

00:14:22.375 --> 00:14:26.175
But we thought that it kind
of fit both of our angles.

00:14:26.175 --> 00:14:28.050
So really, that was the
most important thing.

00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:29.716
And that's really
what Sandy wanted too.

00:14:29.716 --> 00:14:33.440
We wanted a simple restaurant,
and that's really all it is.

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:34.880
I mean it's a very casual place.

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:38.870
If you've been there, you
know, there is no dress code.

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:41.370
I mean you could come in wearing
anything, doing anything.

00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:42.411
It really doesn't matter.

00:14:42.411 --> 00:14:46.380
We're happy to have people come
and enjoy what we're up to.

00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:47.810
And that was really it.

00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:50.672
We wanted to feel like we were
inviting people into our house,

00:14:50.672 --> 00:14:52.630
and I think you'll see
that with the build out.

00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:54.150
Kind of necessity, too.

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:55.260
Don't get me wrong.

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.764
But because of that build out,
before we signed the lease,

00:14:57.764 --> 00:14:59.930
we decided, all right, this
is how it's going to be.

00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:02.370
We want people coming
into our living rooms,

00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:06.650
our home, hide from
nothing, simplicity,

00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:09.650
let food be what it is,
and see what happens.

00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:13.580
And the first year
was pretty awesome.

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:17.450
We were able to win a
few awards and honeymoon

00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:20.292
the second time, which was
really good business-wise.

00:15:20.292 --> 00:15:22.250
And from that point on,
we haven't looked back.

00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:23.250
SPEAKER: That's awesome.

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:25.330
And kind of starting to
transition a little bit

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:28.430
into Michelle and her story,
as we kind of converge

00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:31.640
these things, so if you guys
haven't been to Chartreuse,

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:34.940
vegetables play a massive
role in what you guys produce

00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:38.480
and the plates that you guys
bring to the table every night.

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:40.910
I read a free press article,
"Detroit Free Press"

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:43.825
article, that described
you as a vegetable wizard.

00:15:43.825 --> 00:15:45.950
I don't know if you put
that on your business card,

00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:49.097
but if you don't, you
should, because it's awesome.

00:15:49.097 --> 00:15:51.430
One thing-- and again, correct
me if I'm wrong in this--

00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:55.470
that Chartreuse is
a quaint kitchen,

00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:58.460
and there was not enough room
for a big walk-in freezer

00:15:58.460 --> 00:15:59.450
or cooler.

00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:02.840
And as such-- and again, with
this background of vegetables,

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:05.300
you weren't able to freeze
vegetables or keep them cold.

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:07.430
So as they come in
fresh, you basically

00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:09.770
turn them around and put
them right back on the table.

00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:10.850
So there's no freezing.

00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:14.630
There's no preservation from
kind of that type of concept.

00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:16.442
So the vegetables in
the food that you get

00:16:16.442 --> 00:16:17.900
are incredibly
fresh, even compared

00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:20.210
to a lot of other restaurants
that say they do it fresh.

00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:21.790
A lot of times, they're
freezing the vegetables.

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:23.480
So I think that's a
really cool kind of aspect

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:24.770
of the way you guys do things.

00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:26.500
It's kind of a
necessity based on size,

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:29.990
but it's also a big plus as well
and what's got you guys a lot

00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:30.615
of recognition.

00:16:30.615 --> 00:16:32.489
DOUGLAS HEWITT: Yeah,
sometimes less is more.

00:16:32.489 --> 00:16:34.340
Sometimes your biggest
challenge ends up

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:38.680
being your biggest
asset or your ally.

00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:45.800
It was very terrifying at
Chartreuse, not, for one,

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:47.612
having just--

00:16:47.612 --> 00:16:49.070
you can't get three
guys in a line.

00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:49.940
That's unheard of.

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:51.500
When you're feeding
over 1,000 people

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:53.434
a week with two
guys on the line,

00:16:53.434 --> 00:16:55.850
and then, obviously, the garde
manger and stuff like that.

00:16:55.850 --> 00:16:56.808
It was very terrifying.

00:16:56.808 --> 00:16:57.770
I didn't really think--

00:16:57.770 --> 00:17:00.395
I didn't really know how we were
going to actually pull it off.

00:17:00.395 --> 00:17:02.810
We got kind of lucky, you know.

00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:06.349
So we found that, all
right, well, let's try

00:17:06.349 --> 00:17:11.119
to buy as much-- as fresh as
we can, as much as we can,

00:17:11.119 --> 00:17:16.109
meaning on days to days to days,
and it just kind of worked out.

00:17:16.109 --> 00:17:20.204
And we do a lot of
things raw, and maybe it

00:17:20.204 --> 00:17:21.079
was good timing, too.

00:17:21.079 --> 00:17:22.298
I don't know.

00:17:22.298 --> 00:17:24.589
It felt like we were kind of
composing vegetable plates

00:17:24.589 --> 00:17:26.505
that other people weren't
doing, which you see

00:17:26.505 --> 00:17:27.960
at a lot of restaurants now.

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:30.810
Not that we're cutting edge or
we started a trend or anything.

00:17:30.810 --> 00:17:34.250
I just think that we kind of
were the first ones there.

00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:37.070
So we got a lot of hype for
vegetables, and we should have.

00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:39.470
There's a lot of great
farmers like Michelle

00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:42.980
doing unbelievable work, and we
just wanted to showcase them.

00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:45.894
Add a little salt to a tomato
that was picked that morning.

00:17:45.894 --> 00:17:47.810
You don't need a chef
to tell you that's good.

00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:48.685
You know what I mean?

00:17:48.685 --> 00:17:53.960
So it's just really good
food that we try to not ruin.

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:57.890
And because of it, we
were really successful.

00:17:57.890 --> 00:17:59.360
But yeah, the size
of the kitchen

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:04.250
really ended up turning out to
be sort of our secret weapon.

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:07.350
It's really hard to overthink
things if you can't.

00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:08.930
So that's kind of how it was.

00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:10.850
SPEAKER: That's fantastic.

00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:12.320
Good segue over to Michelle now.

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:16.050
We'd love to hear a little
bit about your position.

00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:18.320
And Recovery Park now--

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:19.950
for those of you
that don't know--

00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:22.600
was founded in 2010, so
about seven years ago.

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:26.460
And the farm aspect was
brought in a few years later.

00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:28.290
This was-- timing, Chef.

00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:31.250
You mentioned timing is a
key concept around Detroit.

00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:32.660
Timing is everything.

00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:35.000
10 years ago, you didn't
want to be in Detroit.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.510
Now everyone wants
to be in Detroit,

00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:38.120
and timing is a big thing.

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:39.662
For Recovery Park,
I think the timing

00:18:39.662 --> 00:18:41.619
was excellent in terms
of when it was developed

00:18:41.619 --> 00:18:42.330
and what it does.

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:44.371
So Michelle, maybe you
can tell us a little bit--

00:18:44.371 --> 00:18:47.800
excuse me-- a little bit about
Recovery Park and Recovery Park

00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:50.350
Farms and what that
concept is and how

00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:53.909
it was established and built
within downtown Detroit.

00:18:53.909 --> 00:18:56.200
MICHELLE LUTZ: So believe it
or not, the idea goes back

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:59.950
to 2008, where our president
and CEO, a gentleman

00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:03.040
by the name of Gary
Wozniak, was helping

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:07.150
to right size an organization,
SHAR, Self Help Addiction

00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:08.710
Rehabilitation.

00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:12.070
And the idea was, how
do you help people

00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:14.200
that are trying to stay clean?

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:18.380
And finding employment,
but meaningful employment

00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:22.130
was one of the top conversations
that kept coming up.

00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:25.210
So I'll never forget the day
that I got a call from him,

00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:25.990
and I was--

00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:30.910
I had left Detroit in '94 and
bought an 80-acre farm in Yale.

00:19:30.910 --> 00:19:33.100
Kind of Doug's and I's
stories are so similar.

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:34.640
It's kind of crazy.

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:37.330
So I go up to this town in
Yale, and I buy an 80-acre farm.

00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:39.560
I have no idea what I'm doing.

00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:41.570
I'm not born in a
farming background,

00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:44.830
nor have any idea
what I'm about to do.

00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:49.390
But by 2008, I have
had a little success

00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:51.140
and started to
learn a few things.

00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:53.170
And he approached me
and said, what do you

00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:55.640
think about the idea
of farming in Detroit?

00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:56.890
I said, well, I love the idea.

00:19:56.890 --> 00:19:58.598
He said, what do you
think about the idea

00:19:58.598 --> 00:20:00.940
about employing
people who are trying

00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:02.560
to rehabilitate their lives?

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:04.570
And I said, well, it's
a phenomenal idea,

00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:08.322
because to me, agriculture
is very therapeutic.

00:20:08.322 --> 00:20:10.780
There's so much that you can
work out and leave in the soil

00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:12.940
if you're having a bad day.

00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:18.430
And it's something that you
can see the direct impact.

00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:20.570
You see the results
of what you work on.

00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:22.670
So I think for that, it
can be very challenging,

00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:25.030
but it can also be
extremely rewarding.

00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:27.530
And at that time,
it was just an idea.

00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:29.320
And he said, would you help?

00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:32.200
And I said, absolutely,
however I can help.

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:35.920
So my help along
the years was really

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:38.560
kind of like they would throw
out an idea, a business plan.

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:39.910
What do you think
if we just did that?

00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:41.130
And I'd say, oh,
that's a horrible idea.

00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:41.990
Don't do that.

00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:42.990
Well, what should we do?

00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:45.610
And I kind of just kept saying,
look at what the market needs.

00:20:45.610 --> 00:20:47.050
Try to address.

00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:50.660
And my heart was
still in the city.

00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:53.890
People would always say
to us, why can't you

00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:56.740
just do this down in Detroit?

00:20:56.740 --> 00:21:00.890
And I said, well, give us
80 acres, and we'll do it.

00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:03.550
But back then, that
wasn't happening.

00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:06.370
With the administration
that we had, it wasn't--

00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:09.940
no one was willing to do that.

00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:12.590
But our connection to the
city was still very clear.

00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:16.780
I mean we had CSA drop-offs,
like when Avalon first opened,

00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:19.830
that was our first CSA
drop-off way back then.

00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:22.570
We had CSA drop-offs
on Rosa Parks,

00:21:22.570 --> 00:21:26.680
and we fed shelters and
firehouses, and so very much

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:30.400
still, hitting the city
with our food twice a week.

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:33.460
And the funny thing
for me, though,

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:35.380
is I never thought
that it would lead

00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:37.270
to a career with Recovery Park.

00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:40.060
I never thought that I would
actually be farming for them.

00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:43.900
So life happens, and I
left my farm in 2011,

00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:47.590
and I did a project over for
Henry Ford Health Care Systems.

00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:52.700
I opened up a greenhouse behind
their West Bloomfield facility.

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:55.360
And I was having a lot of
fun over there doing that.

00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:58.990
And then Gary came to
me in 2013, and he said,

00:21:58.990 --> 00:22:01.090
we're at the point
now that we've

00:22:01.090 --> 00:22:05.680
got to start proving out the
whole ag part of the business.

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:07.490
And would you come
and farm for us?

00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:09.200
Will you do a pilot
project for us?

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:12.340
And I had 100%
confidence in the idea

00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:14.620
that we would grow specialty
produce and grow it

00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:18.400
locally and get it to
chefs as fresh as possible.

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:20.360
So I was like, sure.

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:22.420
So the very first thing
that we did in 2014

00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:24.572
is we built a high
tunnel, which is

00:22:24.572 --> 00:22:26.530
one of those structures
over there on the wall.

00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:29.500
We call them high tunnels.

00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:33.490
We built one in a parking lot
off of East Grand Boulevard

00:22:33.490 --> 00:22:36.080
and made brazed beds in it
and filled it with compost

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:37.330
that we brought in.

00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:40.480
And that was the very
first year that we grew.

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:44.620
And to no surprise,
it was working.

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:48.640
People want--
finally, it's the time

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:52.790
where chefs are so prone to
say, yes, this is what we want.

00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:53.980
We want to know the grower.

00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:56.410
We want to be able to
go and see the food

00:22:56.410 --> 00:22:58.780
and have a relationship
and talk about what

00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:00.970
I wanted to see on the menu.

00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:03.287
And we tried to do
this 10 years ago.

00:23:03.287 --> 00:23:04.870
I mean I remember
when I first started

00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:06.130
trying to sell to shops.

00:23:06.130 --> 00:23:08.750
It was like, what?

00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:09.880
What are you talking about?

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:11.338
No, it's got to
come through Cisco.

00:23:11.338 --> 00:23:13.030
It's got to come
through US Foods.

00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:14.440
We can't cut you a check.

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:15.100
It's got to go.

00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:17.980
I mean it was such a
complicated ordeal.

00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:20.590
So to start doing that was--

00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:23.320
by 2014, what I'm trying to
say, I had a lot of confidence,

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:24.550
that the time was--

00:23:24.550 --> 00:23:26.710
we had enough chefs
out there that

00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:28.630
were ready to do
this, ready to have

00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:33.139
you deliver a box of produce
and make something today.

00:23:33.139 --> 00:23:34.930
And then if you brought
them something else

00:23:34.930 --> 00:23:36.820
excellent two days
from then, they

00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:39.580
were willing to change that.

00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:42.190
A small grower
locally isn't going

00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:44.830
to be-- we're never
going to supply a Subway.

00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:48.680
We're never going to
have 500 cases of five

00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:54.220
by fives at some price that you
can't make up or pay a living

00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:55.270
wage off of.

00:23:55.270 --> 00:23:56.677
It's never going to happen.

00:23:56.677 --> 00:23:58.510
So you kind of got to
go in a direction that

00:23:58.510 --> 00:24:02.390
will take your business
to where it needs to go.

00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:05.020
So we've done a few
years of pilot projects,

00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:09.850
waiting for the city to give
us some land that we can really

00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:12.410
execute our idea.

00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:15.490
And in the fall
of 2015, the mayor

00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:17.500
announced that the
land bank would

00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:19.990
allow us to lease some property
over in the neighborhood

00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:21.240
that we're at right now.

00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:24.920
We're on the east side,
Chene and Ferry area,

00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:27.820
to give you some kind of--
we're a couple of miles away

00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:30.070
from Eastern Market to
give you some idea of where

00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:31.360
we're located.

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:34.660
So it's a very--

00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:37.640
it's a very vacant neighborhood.

00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:40.820
What I know about is
that in the 1950s,

00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:43.510
there was 100,000 jobs
within walking distance

00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:44.860
of that neighborhood.

00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:48.760
2,500 people lived
on a 22-block radius.

00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:52.940
There are now 17 residents
in that neighborhood.

00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:55.479
So Recovery Park
caretakes that 22 blocks.

00:24:55.479 --> 00:24:56.520
What does that look like?

00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:59.080
Any land that
belongs to the city--

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:00.430
we clean up blight.

00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:03.620
We make sure that any dumping
that goes on gets cleaned up.

00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:05.170
We mow those grasses.

00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:06.860
We keep it clean.

00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:09.550
And back in October,
we started building

00:25:09.550 --> 00:25:11.590
what we called Beta
Farm, because we still

00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:13.360
have a lot to learn.

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:15.880
I'm embarrassed to tell you
guys that after 23 years

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:18.400
of doing this, I still
have a lot to learn.

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:21.640
I've never done this in this
type of environment before.

00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:25.380
The Detroit soil has
so much to offer,

00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:27.190
and I mean that
very sarcastically.

00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:29.050
There's so much debris.

00:25:29.050 --> 00:25:32.590
You know, back then, where
there was houses right there,

00:25:32.590 --> 00:25:34.760
this is when they still
just collapsed the houses

00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:37.510
into the basements.

00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:40.720
So there's a lot of
fun stuff to find.

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:42.970
So we started building
those in October,

00:25:42.970 --> 00:25:45.250
and it took a little
longer than it should,

00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:47.200
like any construction project.

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:51.310
But we are now-- we have
eight out of seven structures

00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:53.050
completely operational.

00:25:53.050 --> 00:25:55.570
The only reason why the
last one isn't online

00:25:55.570 --> 00:25:57.530
is because Monday, we
plant that with tomatoes

00:25:57.530 --> 00:26:00.700
so that we have a
succession of crop.

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:05.770
And we have six farms
associates working with us.

00:26:05.770 --> 00:26:07.840
The reason why Recovery
Park Farms exists

00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:09.850
is because Recovery
Park, the nonprofit,

00:26:09.850 --> 00:26:13.492
wants to create jobs for people
with barriers to employment.

00:26:13.492 --> 00:26:14.950
But when you're a
nonprofit, you're

00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:16.840
always looking for
funding, right?

00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:19.165
So that can be very
unstable to people's lives

00:26:19.165 --> 00:26:20.890
if funding runs out.

00:26:20.890 --> 00:26:22.690
So we decided that
Recovery Park would

00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:26.260
launch for-profit businesses,
so that way, the business can

00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:28.570
stand on its own two
legs, and we can make sure

00:26:28.570 --> 00:26:33.960
that people's lives are not
destabilized at any point.

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:37.000
So we hire people with
barriers to employment.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.620
Our farm crew has--

00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:40.690
none of them have
had any experience

00:26:40.690 --> 00:26:44.650
with farming before
or growing anything.

00:26:44.650 --> 00:26:46.690
I was so confident
in our ability

00:26:46.690 --> 00:26:51.130
to train people that I hired
based on personality and work

00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:52.240
ethic.

00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:56.941
And so I'm proud to
say that it's working.

00:26:56.941 --> 00:26:57.940
SPEAKER: That's awesome.

00:26:57.940 --> 00:26:59.950
Thanks for the background.

00:26:59.950 --> 00:27:01.840
I think there's a lot
of questions still

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:03.715
on how you guys got this
up and running, even

00:27:03.715 --> 00:27:05.160
with that detailed description.

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:07.930
It's incredible what you
guys have been able to do.

00:27:07.930 --> 00:27:10.190
Detroit's a unique canvas
for something like this,

00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:13.000
because there's a lot
of underutilized assets.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:18.280
So you've got a massive city
with a million plus people,

00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:20.110
but a lot of empty
and vacant land.

00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:23.320
You've got access to fresh water
with the Detroit River and Lake

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:28.000
St. Clair so nearby, and
you've got a wanting workforce.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.760
You have folks that
want to work, but maybe

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:33.700
have had issues in the past
or have challenges with it.

00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:36.820
So it's kind of
this really unique

00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:38.320
coming together
of a lot of things

00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:41.080
that make this possible,
which I think is fantastic.

00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:43.810
Could you talk a little bit more
before we take a quick break,

00:27:43.810 --> 00:27:46.175
and then talk about how you
guys have come together?

00:27:46.175 --> 00:27:48.550
And you touched on it just a
minute ago about this hiring

00:27:48.550 --> 00:27:49.630
process.

00:27:49.630 --> 00:27:53.530
Where do you go to find
these type of employees?

00:27:53.530 --> 00:27:58.012
What's your process for bringing
talent in and training them

00:27:58.012 --> 00:28:00.220
and getting them ramped up
on this process of working

00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:01.482
within Recovery Park Farms.

00:28:01.482 --> 00:28:03.190
MICHELLE LUTZ: So I
always tell everybody

00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:06.010
we hire the best talent, but
we're completely prepared

00:28:06.010 --> 00:28:09.310
to work with people who have
some challenges in life.

00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:11.770
We look within
our own community.

00:28:11.770 --> 00:28:14.840
Hiring Detroit residents
is very important to us.

00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:18.190
It's one of our conditions
with the city of Detroit

00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:20.980
that such a percentage
of our workforce

00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:22.460
are Detroit residents.

00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:26.080
I think we have to have
61% of our workforce.

00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:27.640
We work within the prisons.

00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:30.610
We have a relationship with
the Michigan Department

00:28:30.610 --> 00:28:32.080
of Corrections.

00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:34.450
It's actually a pretty
solid relationship,

00:28:34.450 --> 00:28:40.120
where they are even interested
in adding hydroponic growing

00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:41.710
into some of their
training facilities

00:28:41.710 --> 00:28:44.876
so that we can have more
of a workforce ready.

00:28:44.876 --> 00:28:46.750
It's very important that
when people come out

00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:48.660
of incarceration that
they have employment

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:51.160
and housing immediately.

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:53.230
So they say that a
success is somebody

00:28:53.230 --> 00:28:56.609
who comes out of prison that
doesn't go back in two years.

00:28:56.609 --> 00:28:58.150
You could still be
addicted to drugs.

00:28:58.150 --> 00:28:59.733
You could be living
under an overpass.

00:28:59.733 --> 00:29:01.480
You could be eating
out of a garbage.

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:03.760
That doesn't look
like success to us.

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:07.210
So for us, we want to make sure
that our employees, after 90

00:29:07.210 --> 00:29:10.900
days of full time employment,
have a 100% company paid

00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:12.160
health care.

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:16.360
We have someone on staff that
works with all of their needs--

00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:21.940
transportation, housing,
reunification with family,

00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:23.829
religion, all of those areas.

00:29:23.829 --> 00:29:25.870
I can't even list them,
because that's really not

00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:29.600
what my job is on the farm.

00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:33.010
But we have somebody on
staff that does that.

00:29:33.010 --> 00:29:36.870
As far as finding people,
we work with Michigan

00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:38.440
Rehabilitative Services.

00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:41.620
So we have SHAR,
that organization.

00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:47.757
We found some of our farm
team from those organizations.

00:29:47.757 --> 00:29:50.090
SPEAKER: And last question
before we take a quick break.

00:29:50.090 --> 00:29:53.420
What does the future look like?

00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:55.900
It seems like you're
getting a lot of support

00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:56.980
from the city of Detroit.

00:29:56.980 --> 00:30:00.250
It seems like you're finding
some really good success, so

00:30:00.250 --> 00:30:01.630
a lot of positive momentum.

00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:05.210
Like what do you see as
the next steps-- expansion,

00:30:05.210 --> 00:30:08.170
just continuing to
perfect what you do?

00:30:08.170 --> 00:30:12.250
Where do you see the vision
of Recovery Parks Farm going?

00:30:12.250 --> 00:30:14.800
MICHELLE LUTZ: So the five-year
plan, when we get there,

00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:19.180
is for us to have 200
employees, that we would

00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:21.010
have 22 acres under glass.

00:30:21.010 --> 00:30:23.890
So if you take a look at that
photo there that I have up,

00:30:23.890 --> 00:30:26.980
that's one city block,
about three acres.

00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:29.080
So there are eight
of those structures

00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:31.540
up there, so we'll
have nine acres that

00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:33.230
look something like that.

00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:35.660
And we would have 22 acres
under glass production.

00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:37.420
So if you can imagine
a city block but be

00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:39.330
covered in a glass greenhouse.

00:30:39.330 --> 00:30:41.860
In that, we would do
hydroponic growing there.

00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:45.670
But what the coolest thing to me
about that five-year plan is it

00:30:45.670 --> 00:30:49.300
shows that Chene Street
comes back with businesses.

00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:51.850
It shows opportunities
for housing.

00:30:51.850 --> 00:30:55.730
It shows opportunity for
massive community space.

00:30:55.730 --> 00:30:58.940
It also makes sure that the
residents that live there,

00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:00.400
we're not doing
something obnoxious

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:02.800
like putting a greenhouse
right next to them.

00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:04.204
We have really
good relationships

00:31:04.204 --> 00:31:05.620
with the neighbors
that are there,

00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:08.350
and we've made sure that
everyone understands

00:31:08.350 --> 00:31:12.040
we're here to help, I
think, make the neighborhood

00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:13.540
more beautiful.

00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:15.610
And we want people to stay.

00:31:15.610 --> 00:31:17.730
We're not here to say,
oh, we're here now,

00:31:17.730 --> 00:31:19.240
and we're going to take over.

00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:23.230
Within that 22-block area,
we have ample opportunity

00:31:23.230 --> 00:31:27.250
and space to do those
things that we want to do.

00:31:27.250 --> 00:31:30.490
SPEAKER: I would love to hear
the story of the convergence

00:31:30.490 --> 00:31:33.851
between the both of you, and you
guys are obviously very close.

00:31:33.851 --> 00:31:35.350
I'm just watching
you guys interact,

00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:38.320
and I know you guys work
together on a daily basis.

00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:41.690
So can you talk a little
bit about the process?

00:31:41.690 --> 00:31:45.110
And maybe, Doug, we can
start from your perspective.

00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:46.570
You've got a
restaurant, or you're

00:31:46.570 --> 00:31:47.986
in the process of
putting together

00:31:47.986 --> 00:31:49.210
a restaurant in Detroit.

00:31:49.210 --> 00:31:51.590
You're looking for
local sourcing.

00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:53.590
How does that process
play into working

00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:55.370
with Michelle and her team?

00:31:55.370 --> 00:31:58.320
DOUGLAS HEWITT: Yeah, I think
we're still looking at a space,

00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:02.020
and the place is pretty
much just a shell.

00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:05.910
I think Michelle reached
out to me first on Facebook.

00:32:05.910 --> 00:32:07.390
And I was like, thank god.

00:32:07.390 --> 00:32:08.973
I've been meaning
to get a hold of you

00:32:08.973 --> 00:32:14.440
to see if maybe
we can partner up.

00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:16.090
I know a lot of my
friends that were

00:32:16.090 --> 00:32:20.000
chefs in this area before me.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.764
I would see nonstop
Michelle's this,

00:32:22.764 --> 00:32:25.180
Michelle's-- a lot of beets
and radishes, stuff like that.

00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:27.370
And I was like, man, that
food is just unbelievable.

00:32:27.370 --> 00:32:29.536
So it was definitely something
I wanted to reach out

00:32:29.536 --> 00:32:30.880
when I came down here.

00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:33.171
It was really important to
me that I brought some farms

00:32:33.171 --> 00:32:35.590
with me, and then I
could reach out and start

00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:38.980
getting some even more local or
some farms that my friends were

00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:40.720
using.

00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:43.660
So Michelle reached out to me.

00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:47.500
We met, I don't
know, pretty soon

00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:49.730
after the contact was made.

00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:55.070
And then I said, well,
like what kind of--

00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:56.120
what do you need from me?

00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:58.780
She wants to know what
we want to use and stuff.

00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:03.150
And we just basically
said, I don't really care.

00:33:03.150 --> 00:33:06.530
I just want you to
kind of bring me boxes.

00:33:06.530 --> 00:33:09.209
And then I could kind of just--
it's kind of a mystery basket

00:33:09.209 --> 00:33:09.750
twice a week.

00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:11.791
You just open it up, and
you see what's in there,

00:33:11.791 --> 00:33:16.160
and just kind of let your
imagination go a little bit.

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:22.019
And it made me a
better chef by far.

00:33:22.019 --> 00:33:23.810
But really, it was that
sort of excitement.

00:33:23.810 --> 00:33:26.460
And when we are talking
like, hey, how about we call

00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:29.710
the dish Recovery Park?

00:33:29.710 --> 00:33:31.517
And she was flattered
by that, too.

00:33:31.517 --> 00:33:33.350
And I was like, sweet,
because that's really

00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:34.308
what I want to call it.

00:33:34.308 --> 00:33:38.900
So our opening menu had a
Recovery Park dish on the menu.

00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:41.770
And outside of the small
transition between properties,

00:33:41.770 --> 00:33:47.150
we've had a Recovery Park item
on the menu since day one.

00:33:47.150 --> 00:33:48.380
And it's just been--

00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:49.550
it's really cool.

00:33:49.550 --> 00:33:53.630
It's farm-specific, and
not only farm-specific,

00:33:53.630 --> 00:33:57.440
but a lot of people know--

00:33:57.440 --> 00:33:59.330
Michelle is sort of like--

00:33:59.330 --> 00:34:00.290
I don't know.

00:34:00.290 --> 00:34:03.100
In our world, she's the
face of Recovery Park.

00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:04.400
You know what I mean?

00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:09.380
I know there's a lot of people
that really make it work, but I

00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:13.100
felt like it was great to
pay it forward to the farm,

00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:15.322
pay it forward to
Gary and the idea,

00:34:15.322 --> 00:34:18.429
pay it forward to
all the individuals

00:34:18.429 --> 00:34:20.429
that work on the farm,
but really pay it forward

00:34:20.429 --> 00:34:23.090
to Michelle, too, and sort of--

00:34:23.090 --> 00:34:25.784
there's a lot more than
just cooks out there, a lot

00:34:25.784 --> 00:34:26.659
more than just chefs.

00:34:26.659 --> 00:34:30.830
I mean it really is a
community of diners and farmers

00:34:30.830 --> 00:34:34.704
and brewers and distillers,
and what a powerful nucleus

00:34:34.704 --> 00:34:36.120
we have when we
all work together.

00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:37.850
And I think that
we're really starting

00:34:37.850 --> 00:34:45.864
to see that work start
to show its profits.

00:34:45.864 --> 00:34:48.239
SPEAKER: Michelle, talk about
this from your perspective.

00:34:48.239 --> 00:34:51.080
And so it sounds like you've got
a little bit of a-- or at least

00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:53.210
early on, you had a little
bit of a blank canvas

00:34:53.210 --> 00:34:57.890
in terms of what Chef was
looking for in his restaurant.

00:34:57.890 --> 00:35:00.920
And how does that play
kind of into what you

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:04.100
do on a daily basis in terms
of what you're deciding to grow

00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:07.284
and harvest and how you
get it to Chartreuse

00:35:07.284 --> 00:35:09.200
and other restaurants
that you guys work with?

00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:12.620
And also, kind of a second
question to that too--

00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:15.680
you guys were mentioning the
city block and the imagery

00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:17.630
that we're looking at now.

00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:21.360
Does all of that food go
into local restaurants,

00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:25.070
or do you guys work with
Eastern Market or anything

00:35:25.070 --> 00:35:27.290
like that for surplus foods
or anything like that?

00:35:27.290 --> 00:35:28.600
Or are you guys
completely tapped out?

00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:29.132
So sorry.

00:35:29.132 --> 00:35:30.590
Two distinct
questions there, but I

00:35:30.590 --> 00:35:33.440
would love to kind of get
your perspective on both.

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:37.250
MICHELLE LUTZ: So I've been very
fortunate to have people come

00:35:37.250 --> 00:35:39.410
and always want to
get produce from us.

00:35:39.410 --> 00:35:43.010
Doug was the first guy that
I went after, and I always--

00:35:43.010 --> 00:35:45.866
I felt like I straight
up stalked him.

00:35:45.866 --> 00:35:47.560
Not going to lie.

00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:49.620
So you see that
you tell the story,

00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:52.320
so it makes me not look
like a crazy person.

00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:56.450
But when we met, I
just knew instantly

00:35:56.450 --> 00:35:58.430
that here's a guy
that's just going

00:35:58.430 --> 00:36:03.140
to allow me to have free
reign, and that's so powerful.

00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:05.700
It's so reassuring.

00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:06.530
It's so calming.

00:36:06.530 --> 00:36:09.032
I can just do what
I love and not

00:36:09.032 --> 00:36:10.240
have to worry about the rest.

00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:12.440
So just to be able
to bring whatever

00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:16.790
is that you are motivated
to do or your feeling

00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:18.860
is at its prime,
and then deliver

00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:25.370
that, that's pretty confident,
solid thing for a grower

00:36:25.370 --> 00:36:28.400
not to have to worry about
hitting a certain amount

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:29.930
or having this week after week.

00:36:29.930 --> 00:36:33.650
You just keep that
creativity going.

00:36:33.650 --> 00:36:37.020
And so that was
really great for me.

00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:39.860
For Recovery Park, from
a business perspective,

00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:44.810
getting a branded dish on a
menu at such an important stage

00:36:44.810 --> 00:36:48.810
of our career, of our
life was imperative.

00:36:48.810 --> 00:36:51.650
I mean to be able to talk
to investors and funders

00:36:51.650 --> 00:36:55.610
and say that, that
was huge for us.

00:36:55.610 --> 00:36:59.090
And so I hope I've
thanked you for that.

00:36:59.090 --> 00:37:01.670
I'm going to try to say this
without getting emotional here,

00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:05.060
but when I sat down
for the soft opening,

00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:16.130
and I saw that on the menu,
the Recovery Park dish,

00:37:16.130 --> 00:37:19.120
I took a photo, and
I sent it to my kids.

00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:21.545
It meant that much.

00:37:21.545 --> 00:37:22.719
SPEAKER: That's awesome.

00:37:22.719 --> 00:37:23.760
MICHELLE LUTZ: So thanks.

00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:24.676
DOUGLAS HEWITT: Yeah.

00:37:24.676 --> 00:37:25.176
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:25.176 --> 00:37:28.010
MICHELLE LUTZ:
Sorry [INAUDIBLE]..

00:37:28.010 --> 00:37:29.347
OK, back to business.

00:37:29.347 --> 00:37:30.180
SPEAKER: Get it out.

00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:30.380
It's OK.

00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:31.713
MICHELLE LUTZ: Back to business.

00:37:31.713 --> 00:37:32.730
So all of the--

00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:36.220
so also from a
business perspective,

00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:39.120
we have a 100% exclusive
arrangement with [? Elbing ?]

00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:40.890
Produce out of Eastern Market.

00:37:40.890 --> 00:37:44.070
Once again, huge
for us, for funders,

00:37:44.070 --> 00:37:47.760
for people who are
looking at Recovery Park.

00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:50.730
They buy 100% of
everything we grow.

00:37:50.730 --> 00:37:53.940
Most of that produce is
all sold right in Detroit.

00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:57.600
It doesn't have to go far,
maybe within a 10-mile radius.

00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:59.220
So that's how fortunate we are.

00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:00.930
This whole thing is working.

00:38:00.930 --> 00:38:05.190
It's the fact that I've got a
really hardworking team, people

00:38:05.190 --> 00:38:07.920
not just on the farm, but
on the nonprofit side.

00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:12.300
We've got great people
like Doug and other people

00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:13.930
that want this to work.

00:38:13.930 --> 00:38:16.560
And then we have consumers like
you guys that go out there,

00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:17.700
so it's--

00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:20.190
the whole thing has to
work for this to work.

00:38:20.190 --> 00:38:24.630
So that's where all
the produce goes.

00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:29.256
It's really-- I'm so happy
that the marketing part is not

00:38:29.256 --> 00:38:30.630
something I have
to stress about.

00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:37.140
I can just grow and train people
and help people build careers.

00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:40.710
Seriously, after three years
of being with us on this farm,

00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:42.210
the guys that we're
working with can

00:38:42.210 --> 00:38:45.270
go anywhere and get really--

00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:47.280
I mean I'll have to
fight to keep them.

00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:51.220
They will be that suited to
work anywhere in the world.

00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:53.580
So that makes me very proud.

00:38:53.580 --> 00:38:55.097
But it's not all about business.

00:38:55.097 --> 00:38:56.430
We have a lot for the community.

00:38:56.430 --> 00:38:59.047
We have a decent-sized
community garden.

00:38:59.047 --> 00:39:00.630
We're still working
on adding to that,

00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:03.030
so we have a
giveback, so that way,

00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:05.700
I don't have to feel bad about
everything being sold off

00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:06.760
the farm.

00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:08.070
SPEAKER: That's awesome.

00:39:08.070 --> 00:39:09.660
I love this idea
of local sourcing.

00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:11.326
Obviously, very
important to both of you

00:39:11.326 --> 00:39:14.235
from distinct perspectives.

00:39:14.235 --> 00:39:16.860
My last question, as we kind of
bring everything back together,

00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:20.130
is do you think-- so
again, we talked about this

00:39:20.130 --> 00:39:22.060
being fairly unique to Detroit.

00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:26.280
Do you think
something like this is

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:29.280
able to be repeated in other
cities or other communities?

00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:34.490
We've got some unique physical
aspects in the city of Detroit

00:39:34.490 --> 00:39:36.240
that allow something
like this to happen--

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:40.930
proximity to a major
city, proximity to--

00:39:40.930 --> 00:39:45.120
specific timing and kind of
the renaissance of Detroit.

00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:47.924
Is this something that's just
localized to being something

00:39:47.924 --> 00:39:49.590
that can work in
Detroit, or do you guys

00:39:49.590 --> 00:39:54.219
see something like this being
replicable outside of the city?

00:39:54.219 --> 00:39:56.010
MICHELLE LUTZ: I might
take a stab at that,

00:39:56.010 --> 00:39:57.900
because I certainly hope so.

00:39:57.900 --> 00:40:00.810
I've dedicated the last
23 years of my life

00:40:00.810 --> 00:40:06.260
to helping to build and
strengthen local food systems.

00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:09.080
It is imperative
that you have that.

00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:12.320
So anywhere in the
world, having food

00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:14.600
right there in your
community is so important.

00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:17.390
I look at how we've
handled natural disasters.

00:40:17.390 --> 00:40:20.520
I look at how just when
we had the power outage,

00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:22.100
and there was no food coming in.

00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:25.100
We cannot be dependent on
other people feeding us.

00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:27.660
We have to have these
type of relationships.

00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:29.870
This is the only way it works.

00:40:29.870 --> 00:40:32.810
An operation like ours could
not pay people a living wage

00:40:32.810 --> 00:40:34.490
and have health care benefits.

00:40:34.490 --> 00:40:38.820
If I had to do straight
up market pricing,

00:40:38.820 --> 00:40:42.200
compete with large farms in
Mexico that pay people $2

00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:44.200
a week, that system is broken.

00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:45.150
It does not work.

00:40:45.150 --> 00:40:47.190
It's heavy on
chemicals, and I'm not

00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:48.440
going to get into all of that.

00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:54.860
But if you really want to have a
strong local food system, this,

00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:57.230
all of this-- consumers,
chefs, growers--

00:40:57.230 --> 00:40:58.700
it all has to work.

00:40:58.700 --> 00:41:00.380
And I'm damn proud
of what Detroit

00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:01.910
is doing in that
element, and I'm

00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:05.840
happy that we have as many
outstanding growers that we

00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:10.970
have, and once again, chefs that
are taking advantage of that.

00:41:10.970 --> 00:41:14.450
To me, I love when we have
visitors from out of town.

00:41:14.450 --> 00:41:17.690
We had a group in from
Paris about a month ago,

00:41:17.690 --> 00:41:20.392
and they were like, this
has to happen in Paris.

00:41:20.392 --> 00:41:21.100
You have to come.

00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:23.170
I was like, no, I still
got work over here to do.

00:41:23.170 --> 00:41:26.680
But it's great to see how people
visit something like that,

00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:30.640
and they feel instantly
that it can be duplicated.

00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:36.470
And to me, that's a great thing.

00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:38.080
Niagara's talked
to Recovery Park.

00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:41.350
I mean there's been other cities
that have come in and said,

00:41:41.350 --> 00:41:44.050
once you get this going,
but we've got a lot of it

00:41:44.050 --> 00:41:44.950
still to figure out.

00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:47.040
SPEAKER: Sure.

00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:48.970
That's a great
foundation, and it's nice

00:41:48.970 --> 00:41:51.370
when people are looking
to a city like Detroit

00:41:51.370 --> 00:41:54.140
for opportunity and
to replicate things.

00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:56.500
Any last thoughts,
Chef, on your side

00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:58.450
in terms of kind
of sustainability

00:41:58.450 --> 00:41:59.830
of this and kind
of what it looks

00:41:59.830 --> 00:42:01.082
like for you moving forward?

00:42:01.082 --> 00:42:03.040
DOUGLAS HEWITT: Yeah, I
mean when it comes down

00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:08.320
to other cities being able to
duplicate exactly what we're

00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:09.550
up to, I highly doubt it.

00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:17.720
Some of the unfortunate parts
are our fortune, really,

00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:19.220
being able to go
into neighborhoods,

00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:20.761
and some cities
don't have that much.

00:42:20.761 --> 00:42:22.490
But really what
we have, I think,

00:42:22.490 --> 00:42:29.390
is Detroit as a whole is sort
of a very proud community.

00:42:29.390 --> 00:42:31.010
And food is sort of--

00:42:31.010 --> 00:42:36.920
I think food is sort of at the
forefront of the new Detroit.

00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:39.285
I hate saying new Detroit,
but how do you avoid it?

00:42:39.285 --> 00:42:40.160
You know what I mean?

00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:41.680
Because there is
a lot happening.

00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:44.330
There's a lot of new stuff.

00:42:44.330 --> 00:42:50.030
But I think with as
many chefs and how

00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:54.995
we interact and the farming
system, and the farming

00:42:54.995 --> 00:42:56.870
doesn't work if the
consumer doesn't want it.

00:42:59.390 --> 00:43:02.530
Farming doesn't-- some of these
unique ingredients don't work

00:43:02.530 --> 00:43:06.100
if nobody knows how to use them
or if people are [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:06.100 --> 00:43:08.210
out or weird about it,
those kind of things.

00:43:08.210 --> 00:43:12.530
So and then all of a sudden,
the brewing and the distilling,

00:43:12.530 --> 00:43:15.680
and now all of a
sudden, we have people

00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:19.519
that are bringing Michigan
whole animals to Detroit, where

00:43:19.519 --> 00:43:20.810
we're starting to buy our meat.

00:43:20.810 --> 00:43:23.774
So really, this
was sort of like--

00:43:23.774 --> 00:43:26.190
I think Michelle's movement
was sort of the first movement

00:43:26.190 --> 00:43:29.120
to where everyone's
like, wait a minute.

00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:33.170
We can do a lot more
than just produce.

00:43:33.170 --> 00:43:34.760
And I think we're starting out--

00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:38.090
as people are starting
work together.

00:43:38.090 --> 00:43:39.140
Go eat anywhere in town.

00:43:39.140 --> 00:43:40.100
Go eat at Grey Ghost.

00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:40.670
Go eat at Selden.

00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:41.545
Go eat at Mabel Gray.

00:43:41.545 --> 00:43:43.504
Go eat at Chartreuse.

00:43:43.504 --> 00:43:45.170
The chances of you
eating an animal that

00:43:45.170 --> 00:43:48.110
wasn't raised in this state
are probably not great,

00:43:48.110 --> 00:43:52.850
outside of some fish and
maybe a couple of the more--

00:43:52.850 --> 00:43:55.190
ducks are more harder
things to come by.

00:43:58.370 --> 00:44:00.915
Either eat the corn bread, and
I guarantee that buttermilk

00:44:00.915 --> 00:44:01.790
was done in Michigan.

00:44:01.790 --> 00:44:02.665
You know what I mean?

00:44:02.665 --> 00:44:05.930
So go eat the egg
dish, and I guarantee

00:44:05.930 --> 00:44:08.920
there's two or three farms
that are doing the farms.

00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:11.960
We've taken just that
twice cooked egg alone,

00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:15.170
and then the other restaurants
are taking this small egg guy

00:44:15.170 --> 00:44:20.540
in Mason, Michigan to
like an actual business.

00:44:20.540 --> 00:44:22.310
It was a hobby,
him and his wife.

00:44:22.310 --> 00:44:25.460
And then they got sick
of washing 400,000 eggs

00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:26.240
a week by hand.

00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:28.665
And now they have
their son moved back

00:44:28.665 --> 00:44:29.540
to help the business.

00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:31.030
They bought this big washer.

00:44:31.030 --> 00:44:33.355
And we're talking about
five restaurants in Detroit,

00:44:33.355 --> 00:44:34.730
and all of a
sudden, this guy has

00:44:34.730 --> 00:44:38.780
a legit business moving eggs,
and we're proud to serve them.

00:44:38.780 --> 00:44:41.240
You know what I mean?

00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:45.740
So it really is this network
of, really, people just trying

00:44:45.740 --> 00:44:47.030
to do the right thing.

00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:50.932
But again, it doesn't work if
people don't buy into that.

00:44:50.932 --> 00:44:54.000
If people don't want to know
where their food is from,

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.790
and they don't care
about sustainability

00:44:55.790 --> 00:45:00.460
or organic practice or those
kind of things, we're screwed.

00:45:00.460 --> 00:45:00.960
[INAUDIBLE]

00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:01.835
You know what I mean?

00:45:01.835 --> 00:45:03.950
So [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:03.950 --> 00:45:06.044
By all means, [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:09.390 --> 00:45:12.960
Because until we [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:14.220
We got to get avocados.

00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:14.900
I want limes.

00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:16.225
SPEAKER: Lot of pressure.

00:45:16.225 --> 00:45:17.380
MICHELLE LUTZ: Yeah.

00:45:17.380 --> 00:45:19.255
DOUGLAS HEWITT: So it's
not like this mission

00:45:19.255 --> 00:45:20.600
to be 100% sustainable.

00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:22.500
Like I had a guy in
one time that was like,

00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:23.950
where'd you get the octopus?

00:45:23.950 --> 00:45:26.570
St. Clair?

00:45:26.570 --> 00:45:28.407
Dude.

00:45:28.407 --> 00:45:29.490
MICHELLE LUTZ: Don't hate.

00:45:29.490 --> 00:45:32.370
DOUGLAS HEWITT: I never said
we were 100% sustainable.

00:45:32.370 --> 00:45:34.950
We're just trying-- and
everybody's that way.

00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:38.190
We're just trying to
do our best to keep

00:45:38.190 --> 00:45:40.990
our money in the great
state of Michigan,

00:45:40.990 --> 00:45:43.620
especially in the
city, and start to--

00:45:43.620 --> 00:45:45.900
you can see the change.

00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:48.000
You can visibly
reach out and see

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:52.599
how your money that you spend
on tomatoes is making an impact.

00:45:52.599 --> 00:45:53.585
It's powerful stuff.

00:45:53.585 --> 00:45:55.960
Not a lot of people have that
opportunity [INAUDIBLE].a.a

00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:57.690
SPEAKER: Well, Doug,
Michelle, thank

00:45:57.690 --> 00:46:00.126
you so much for coming in
and sharing your story.

00:46:00.126 --> 00:46:01.500
It's very
inspirational, and it's

00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:04.760
great to see the collaboration
that you guys have performed

00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:06.510
and some of the
sustainability that you've

00:46:06.510 --> 00:46:07.860
created just within Detroit.

00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:09.310
And we wish you
the best of luck.

00:46:09.310 --> 00:46:10.830
Thank you so much, and
thank you for coming in.

00:46:10.830 --> 00:46:11.510
Appreciate it.

00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:15.460
[APPLAUSE]
