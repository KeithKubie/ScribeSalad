00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:15.059
When it comes to gender disparity, the world
of commercial airline piloting is one of the

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:21.210
most skewed with a whopping 97% of all commercial
pilots being male (4000 female commercial

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:28.540
pilots vs. 130,000 male worldwide according
to The International Society of Women Airline

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:29.540
Pilots).

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.250
Those numbers shift slightly when you factor
in women who are qualified to fly private

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.989
planes but not commercial.

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:39.210
But there is still a huge difference in the
number of males compared to females even in

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.360
this case.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:46.420
According to the US Civil Airmen Statistics,
in 2011 there were about 617,000 qualified

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:52.949
pilots in the United States, 41,000 of which
were women, which means just over 93% of all

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.139
pilots in 2011 were men.

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:57.170
So what gives here?

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:58.750
Do women just not like flying?

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.469
Are the airline industry and the training
schools just sexist?

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:05.680
On the latter issue, at one point like in
so many industries, yes.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.780
As discussed in this article on Helen Richey,
who became the world’s first female pilot

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:15.210
“to fly a commercial airliner on a regularly
scheduled mail route” on December 31, 1934,

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.950
she quit after only 10 months due to how poorly
she was treated by male staff.

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.920
Among other things, Richey was barred from
becoming a member of the Pilot’s Union and

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.600
was forbidden from flying in anything other
than fair weather.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.799
It should be noted here that these restrictions
were being placed on a woman who once crawled

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.350
onto the wing of a plane she was flying to
repair a tear.

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.960
She also spent years flying stunt planes.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.329
Another thing that historically was holding
early female pilots back was the fact that

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.520
to become a commercial pilot, one needed to
be subjected to various strength and height

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.520
requirements.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.710
Since women are generally shorter than men
and there is often a disparity in physical

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.170
strength, many women were barred from even
applying to become a pilot.

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.090
However, in recent years this has gotten much
better, to quote The International Society

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.380
of Women Airline Pilots: “These requirements
have mainly fallen by the wayside.

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.940
The only requirement is that a prospective
pilot can fly the simulator provided during

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.690
the interview process, without undue problems
due to height or strength.”

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.800
As for the issue of sexism in more modern
times, according to pilot and editor of Aviation

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.960
for Women magazine, Amy Laboda, “I can tell
you that [female airline pilots] have made

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:30.010
tremendous progress, and the reason … is
because most of the dinosaurs are gone…

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.640
The men who didn’t want women in the cockpit
have mostly retired.”

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.360
Today, it’s generally not so much that those
within the industry have any issues with female

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.470
pilots, but, interestingly enough, the people
who respond most poorly are the passengers.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.810
Within the industry, there’s actually been
a huge drive by some airlines in recent years,

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.920
for example by British Airways, to increase
the number of females applying for given positions,

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.040
and thus hopefully start to even out the numbers.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.890
So with some companies, while you’re still
going to need to bring the skills and the

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.150
experience to the table, you actually might
have a leg up on the competition at the moment

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.780
if you’re a woman trying to become a commercial
pilot.

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.470
If you’ve got the same skill and experience
as a male applying, one would think the companies

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.730
looking for more female pilots will pick you
over your equivalent XY competition.

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.320
So why haven’t the numbers evened out since
the sexist “dinosaurs” have all retired?

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.290
Well one theory is that the sheer amount of
time one needs to dedicate to being a pilot,

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.650
and brutal travel schedule, turns a lot of
women off because they’d rather focus on

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.360
their domestic life and stay closer to home.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.340
This is a nice theory and perhaps is a factor,
but there are only colloquial sources to back

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.340
it up.

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.650
Further, the same can be said about a lot
of industries that don’t see anywhere near

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:51.080
a 4,000 vs. 130,000 type split in number of
women vs. men working in the respective fields.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.330
Another theory is that, for whatever reason,
young girls never see being a pilot as a career

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:00.250
option whether because the field doesn’t
fit young girls’ interests or perhaps simply

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:06.050
because you rarely see female commercial pilots
in real life or on TV or movies; so there

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.150
is a lack of visible role models.

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.590
A study conducted by British Airways in their
efforts to learn why more women don’t become

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.530
commercial pilots discovered that among young
boys, “pilot” was the second most popular

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:18.870
career choice.

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.180
With girls, it wasn’t even mentioned.

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.740
So whatever the underlying reason, most young
girls just don’t find becoming a commercial

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.120
pilot appealing.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:32.460
This also, perhaps, explains why the numbers
are so skewed even in the private pilot license

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.940
arena, still with a 93%/7% male vs. female
split.

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.980
All that said, it’s generally thought that
the biggest factor stopping women from becoming

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:46.601
commercial pilots is the fact that a lot of
pilots come from a military background, an

00:04:46.601 --> 00:04:51.190
option that wasn’t even open to women in
many countries (and some still not) until

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:52.820
relatively recently.

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:58.380
In the U.S., for instance, until 1993 women
weren’t allowed to fly combat aircraft.

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:03.270
So if a woman wanted to become a commercial
pilot before such restrictions were lifted,

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:09.350
they’d have to foot the $100,000-ish bill
to acquire all the necessary training and

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:10.350
experience.

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.660
And keep in mind, commercial pilots just starting
out don’t get paid much.

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:19.490
According to FAPA (Future and Active Pilot
Advisers), first officers can start out as

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.970
low as $20,000 per year.

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:26.150
Needless to say, investing those same dollars
and hours into other careers can often be

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.710
much more lucrative, particularly up front.

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:33.570
As commercial pilot Jill Schilmoeller said,
“You have to love flying, because you start

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.220
off getting paid horribly and you are gone
a lot…”

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:41.680
To get around the training cost, one essentially
has to join the military, where once again

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:46.520
we find a huge disparity in the desire to
do so in men vs. women.

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.700
So not only do we have an issue of young girls
not dreaming of becoming pilots, but we also

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:56.900
have significantly less women joining the
military and becoming pilots there, and maybe

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.830
making “commercial pilot” a future option
for themselves, even if they didn’t think

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:02.840
of it as an option as a child.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:07.030
While most men also don’t see the military
as an option they want to pursue, the small

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:12.700
number that do and then become pilots there
still eclipse the number of women doing it.

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:16.380
Combined with the cost of getting the training
all yourself without the military footing

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:21.260
the bill, this results in a relatively huge
pool of men applying for commercial pilot

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:22.930
positions compared to women.

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:27.090
So when it all shakes out, even without any
sexism in the industry itself, the result

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:31.810
is that, at least for now, it will be a rare
flight you take where one of the people flying

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:42.699
the plane is a woman.
