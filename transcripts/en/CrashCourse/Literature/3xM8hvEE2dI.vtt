00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440
Hi, I’m John Green, this is Crash Course
Literature, and today we’re going to talk

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.580
about To Kill a Mockingbird.
So Mockingbird is the rare class of American

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:11.579
literature that is both one, relatively easy
to read and two, pretty fun to read.

00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:15.429
I mean, it’s got a cool and somewhat creepy
plot that draws you in. There is a young girl,

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:19.710
Scout; her brother, Jem; and their weird neighbor,
Dill, who become obsessed with their even

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.239
weirder neighbor, “Boo” Radley. The kids
spend a lot of time reenacting Boo’s backstory

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:28.880
— the highlight of which involves him allegedly
stabbing his father in the leg with scissors

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.660
— and the children become schooled in gender,
race, and class relations in Depression-Era Alabama.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.860
MFTP: Mr. Green, Mr. Green, I’m from Alabama!

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.420
I know, Me From the Past, because I am also
you. Anyway, the kids, and also, of course,

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.400
we as readers, are schooled in all things
ethical by the Gregory Peckian Atticus Finch:

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.880
public defender, sharpshooter, and one of the
most beloved father figures in American fiction

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:58.820
[Theme Music]

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.680
So, To Kill a Mockingbird was an absolute
literary sensation when it was published in 1960.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.240
The Chicago Sunday Tribune called it
“a novel of strong contemporary national

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.810
significance.” Time Magazine said that it
"teaches the reader an astonishing number

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.270
of useful truths about little girls and about
Southern life."

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.030
Now some disparaged Lee’s treatment of poor Southern
whites and African Americans as one-dimensional,

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.780
but Mockingbird so far, at least, has a kind
of timeless appeal to it.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.140
And to be fair to those critics, there is
something simple about Mockingbird and the

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.960
way that it imagines justice, but it’s also
very compelling.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.580
And there are times when it feels dated, but
again, it was written in 1960.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.980
Anyway, it won the 1961 Pulitzer Prize for
fiction, it’s been printed over 30 million

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.860
times, translated into over 40 languages.
That’s a lot of dead mockingbirds. So who

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.140
would write a story with such a depressing
title? Well, Harper Lee.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.090
So Harper Lee was born in 1926 in the bustling
metropolis of Monroeville, Alabama.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.460
MFTP: Alabama! Roll Tide!
Ooooh, yes, Me From the Past, we are aware.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.340
So critics often point out that there are
many parallels between Lee’s childhood and

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.180
that of her main character, Jean Louise “Scout”
Finch. Lee’s father was an attorney who

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.039
unsuccessfully defended two African American
men accused of murder. Lee’s brother, Edwin,

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.420
was four years her senior.
The family employed an African-American housekeeper

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.749
who was central in Lee’s upbringing. Lee’s
mother, was not dead, but she was quite distant.

00:02:18.749 --> 00:02:23.450
And Lee’s childhood playmate, Truman Persons,
was a weird kid who spent extended periods

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.879
visiting relatives next door. Now in literature,
this boy Truman provided the model for Dill

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:32.799
Harris. In real life, this Truman reinvented
himself as Truman Capote — icon of American

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:37.069
letters, author of Breakfast at Tiffany’s
and In Cold Blood. That’s right - he spent

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:39.409
his summers in Monroeville.
In fact, there’s a longstanding literary

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:43.900
conspiracy theory that since Harper Lee never
wrote another book, maybe Truman Capote is

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.950
the real author of To Kill a Mockingbird.
Which, if you read Mockingbird alongside anything

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.069
Truman Capote ever wrote, you will immediately
realize that it’s just ridiculous. Harper

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:55.409
Lee wrote To Kill a Mockingbird.
Harper Lee has not written another novel.

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:59.369
She didn’t enjoy the spotlight and has declined
most requests for interviews and speeches.

00:02:59.369 --> 00:03:03.879
But she did write a brief, and piercing foreword
to a later edition of Mockingbird:

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:08.180
“The only good thing about Introductions
is that in some cases they delay the dose

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.730
to come. Mockingbird still says what it has
to say; it has managed to survive the years

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.459
without preamble.”
Her publishers were like, “We need a new

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.879
foreword so we can sell more copies of the
book.” And she was like, “All right, but

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:23.180
my introduction is gonna be about how useless
introductions are.”

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.650
All right, before we discuss how Mockingbird
manages to “[say] what it has to say,”

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.219
let’s look at the plot in the Thought Bubble:
So, Scout, Jem, and Dill spend two summers

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:34.120
sipping lemonade and cultivating fantasies
about their mysterious homebound neighbor,

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.290
“Boo” Radley and daring one another to
touch his door. The children act out events

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.400
from Boo’s life. And although Boo remains
hidden, his chewing gum does not. This gum,

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.620
along with other gifts, appears in a tree
outside the Radley house.

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.760
Meanwhile, Scout learns that her father, Atticus,
has been appointed to defend Tom Robinson,

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.939
a black man with a deformed left arm, wrongly
accused of raping Mayella Ewell, a friendless

00:03:55.939 --> 00:04:00.230
white nineteen-year old who lives behind a
garbage dump. Mayella lives with a gaggle

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:05.629
of filthy and uneducated siblings and an often-drunk
father, who beats and possibly molests her.

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:09.409
Despite Tom’s obvious innocence, I mean,
Mayella was hit on the right side of her face

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:15.540
by a man without a left arm, the white population
of Maycomb resents Atticus for being his court

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.780
appointed public defender. With the help of
Jem and Scout, Atticus dissuades a mob from

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.620
lynching Tom. Atticus is less successful,
however, at swaying the jury. Tom is declared

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.039
guilty; He escapes from prison and then is
shot and killed.

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:32.430
Bob Ewell, the father of Mayella, is miffed
at being ridiculed by Atticus in court. After

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:37.530
spitting at Atticus, Ewell attacks his children.
Boo Radley comes to the rescues and makes

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.420
good on his history of stabbing people, and
the children are saved.

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.680
Thanks, Thought Bubble. So there we see, like,
two of the biggest problems with To Kill a

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.139
Mockingbird. First, that the Ewell family
is kind of like one-dimensionally villainous.

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:52.389
And secondly, that the great hero of the story
is this, like, rich white dude.

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:55.690
But having acknowledged that, I don’t wanna
miss all the stuff that’s still really resonant

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.139
and important to contemporary readers.
So throughout the book, Scout is encouraged

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:03.639
to look at things from other peoples’ perspectives.
Which of course was, like, the great fundamental

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:06.930
failure of the Jim Crow South.
Like at the end of the novel, Scout no longer

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.319
sees Boo as this, like, terrifying other,
she’s able to imagine how events appear

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:15.619
from his perspective. And in doing so,
she’s following Atticus’s famous advice:

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:20.500
“You never really understand a person until
you consider things from his point of view --

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.400
until you climb into his skin and walk
around in it.“

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:26.180
I just want to clarifying that we’re not
talking about, like, Silence of the Lambs-style

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.319
walking around in someone else’s skin, I’m
talking about empathy.

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:32.520
That said, it occurs to me that bringing up
Silence of the Lambs allows us to talk about

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.849
the macabre and Mockingbird as, like, a Southern
Gothic novel.

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:39.849
So you all remember the Gothic novel from
Frankenstein, with its blend of horror and

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:43.460
its interest in the sublime.
So Gothic literature relies on archetypes,

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:48.389
like grotesque monsters, innocent victims,
heroic knights, etc.—to create dramatic

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:54.420
tension and it uses dark settings, like medieval
castles, to heighten the emotional impact of a story.

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:59.120
Now in the Southern Gothic movement that emerged in the American South, “real,” although still fictional,

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:04.780
people replace those Gothic archetypes.  Like at the
start of Mockingbird, Boo is a reclusive monster;

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:09.440
Jem, Scout and Dill are his potential victims;
and Atticus is an heroic knight.

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.780
Now later, ignorance, racism, and violence
prove to be the novel’s real “monsters.”

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:17.809
And Tom and Mayella are their victims. Atticus,
of course, gets to remain the hero.

00:06:17.809 --> 00:06:22.740
And in Southern Gothic fiction, decaying buildings
or bodies replace the medieval castle as the

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.640
dark settings that heighten a story’s emotional
impact.

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.820
I mean, we’re told that Maycomb is a town
in which,

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:33.080
“In rainy weather the streets turned to
red slop; grass grew on the sidewalks, the

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:37.000
courthouse sagged in the square.”
And many of Maycomb’s inhabitants also have

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.639
bodies that are broken, infected, or off-balance,
right? Like Atticus is too old to play tackle

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:46.590
football and, to his daughter’s inexplicable
horror, he wears glasses.

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:51.210
He’s a monster! Now he’s a regular person.
Now I’m a monster again.

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:55.990
Mrs. Dubose, the cantankerous morphine addict,
has a particularly heinous mouth. Tom’s

00:06:55.990 --> 00:07:01.210
left arm has been torn apart in a cotton gin.
Jem’s left arm is eventually deformed by

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:04.490
Ewell.
And ultimately, these broken, off-balance,

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:10.349
horrifying attributes of Maycomb and its inhabitants
expose the corruption and decay of Southern

00:07:10.349 --> 00:07:13.099
culture itself.
So Mockingbird is one of the great Southern

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:16.999
Gothic novels, but it’s also one of the
great American bildungsromans.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.520
Like Jane Eyre, it’s a novel about a young
person’s education and coming of age. So

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:24.719
at the beginning, I’m like - Ooohhhh, it
must be time for the open letter.

00:07:24.719 --> 00:07:27.930
Oh hey there, Darth Vader. An open letter
to the German language:

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:33.270
Dear German, you’ve given us so much. “Vader”
for instance, the German word for “father.”

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:37.599
“Schadenfreude”, the pleasure we experience
when others suffer. “Kummerspeck”, which

00:07:37.599 --> 00:07:41.240
literally translates to “grief bacon,”
the way we eat when we’re sad.

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:45.200
And, of course, terms like “sitzpinkler,”
a man who sits to pee.

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:48.939
But perhaps your greatest gift is “bildungsroman,”
because not only did you give us the word,

00:07:48.939 --> 00:07:52.569
you also kind of gave us the idea.
So this sitzpinkler would like to thank you

00:07:52.569 --> 00:07:56.599
for that and all of your many linguistic gifts.
Best wishes, John Green.

00:07:56.599 --> 00:08:00.620
So at the beginning of Mockingbird, a six-year-old
Scout can already read the newspaper, in spite

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:04.749
of a lack of formal education, and when Scout
demonstrates that she can read at school,

00:08:04.749 --> 00:08:08.889
Miss Caroline — a teacher with a loose grasp
of John Dewey’s philosophy — commands:

00:08:08.889 --> 00:08:12.499
“Now tell your father not to teach you any
more. It’s best to begin reading with a

00:08:12.499 --> 00:08:16.969
fresh mind. You tell him I’ll take over
from here and try to undo the damage—“

00:08:16.969 --> 00:08:21.210
But of course both academically and morally,
Scout doesn’t get her education in school,

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:25.389
she gets it precisely from her father.
Scout’s also called a tomboy, and most women

00:08:25.389 --> 00:08:29.949
in her community critique how she speaks and
dresses and plays. Yet who can blame her for

00:08:29.949 --> 00:08:34.380
wanting to be a tomboy? Jem often tells her
that girls are hateful and embarrassing and

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:39.450
frivolous and worse, when Dill begins “following
Jem about,” he starts to treat Scout as

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:41.640
an object:
“He had asked me earlier in the summer to

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:46.620
marry him, then he promptly forgot about it.
He staked me out, marked as his property,

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:49.850
said I was the only girl he would ever love,
then he neglected me.”

00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:54.310
Scout consistently resists the notion that
women are a form of property. In fact, throughout

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:59.340
the novel, Lee uses Scout’s reflections
to expose the performative aspects of gender

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:04.220
— or the ways in which gender, like, results
from what feminist critic Judith Butler describes

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:09.780
as the “repeated stylization of the body,
a set of repeated acts within a highly rigid

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:15.100
regulatory frame that congeal over time to
produce the appearance of substance, of a

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:18.070
natural sort of being.”
That’s a bit complicated, but basically,

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:23.570
Scout stands in opposition to the idea that
you have to do or be a, b, or c in order to,

00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:26.330
like, be a real woman.
But of course, there are limits to how much

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:30.750
Scout can act like a boy. Like when Jem and
Dill spend afternoons “going in naked”

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:35.390
swimming in a creek, Scout is left to divide
the “lonely hours” between Calpurnia,

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:38.910
the housekeeper, and Miss Maudie.
And these two women prove to be Scout’s

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:43.440
strongest female allies. Calpurnia supports
Scout’s independence by teaching her to

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:47.250
write in the kitchen. And Miss Maudie bolsters
Scout’s confidence. Like when a neighbor

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:52.150
ridicules Scout for wearing pants, Scout recalls,
“Miss Maudie’s hand closed tightly on

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:57.260
mine, and I said nothing. Its warmth was enough.”
Vitally, neither of these women is able to

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:02.140
serve on a jury in the town of Maycomb — Maudie,
“because she’s a woman,” and Calpurnia,

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:06.520
because she is both a woman and black. This
not-so-subtle social commentary provides the

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:10.880
backbone for Harper Lee’s argument about
the dangers of limiting women’s political

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:16.730
rights, like had those women sat on that jury,
Lee implies, the trial might have gone very

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:18.710
differently.
But of course, the jury ends up taking the

00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:23.230
side of Mayella Ewell. And although it’s
difficult to forgive her for wrongly accusing

00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:28.620
Tom, it’s clear that she is also a victim
of this perverse form of patriarchy.

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:32.680
Rather than being permitted to, like, attend
school and have a normal life, Mayella has

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:38.000
been forced to care for seven siblings and
keep house for a violent, drunk father. She’s

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.260
isolated and friendless, and she tries to
kiss Tom and when her father catches her,

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:46.380
he beats her, and possibly rapes her. And
only then does she allow herself to try to

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:52.070
escape that violence by blaming someone else.
Mayella’s world is circumscribed and terrifying,

00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:56.470
which is strongly contrasted with Scout’s
pre-adolescent freedom and wonder.

00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:59.760
So in the end, I would argue that what some
critics read as a one-dimensional treatment

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:03.880
of the Ewell family, turns out to be a pretty
sophisticated commentary on gender relations

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:07.370
in the time and place of the novel.
This reminds us again that when we read, we

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:11.810
as readers are empowered to make choices.
A novel really is a collaboration between

00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:15.040
the author and the reader.
And Harper Lee’s great novel may be straightforward

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:18.680
in its prose and in its plot, but when it
comes to opportunities for that collaboration,

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:23.060
it is extremely rich. Thanks for watching.
I’ll see you next week.

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:27.260
Crash Course is made by all of these nice
people, and it exists because of your support

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:32.020

service that allows us to keep Crash Course

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:36.540

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:41.340
