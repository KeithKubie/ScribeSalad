00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.940
Hey it's me Destin.

00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:02.168
Welcome back to Smarter Every Day.

00:00:02.646 --> 00:00:05.339
Here's the deal. I've created a video in the northern hemisphere

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:07.671
and Derek from Veritasium has created one in the south.

00:00:07.671 --> 00:00:10.875
You have to synchronize these two videos in order for this to make any sense

00:00:10.875 --> 00:00:12.541
but it's totally worth it if you do.

00:00:12.541 --> 00:00:14.603
So click the first link in the video description,

00:00:14.603 --> 00:00:17.401
get the video ready, and then synchronize on my mark.

00:00:17.401 --> 00:00:18.417
You ready?

00:00:18.417 --> 00:00:23.895
5.. 4.. 3.. 2.. 1..

00:00:23.895 --> 00:00:25.253
Video.

00:00:25.586 --> 00:00:27.723
[toilet flush]

00:00:29.728 --> 00:00:31.467
[music]

00:00:40.074 --> 00:00:44.501
Here in Huntsville Alabama we're at 34 degrees north latitude.

00:00:44.501 --> 00:00:48.453
- And we're gonna find out if the water swirls the opposite way here to how it does in the southern hemisphere.

00:00:48.453 --> 00:00:52.107
- We're making the definitive video to settle this once and for all.

00:00:52.107 --> 00:00:55.773
[whispers] It's never been done on the internet. You're gonna learn something.

00:00:57.523 --> 00:00:59.824
[toilet flush]

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:10.836
So I have seen documentaries that seem to indicate that which hemisphere you're in determines which way the water is gonna swirl,

00:01:10.836 --> 00:01:17.804
but there's this other group of people and they seem really confident that it doesn't matter where you're at, the water's gonna swirl however it wants.

00:01:25.804 --> 00:01:29.644
But have you ever just looked for yourself and figured out which way your toilet swirls?

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.134
Here is Alabama I've noticed that some turn counter-clockwise, and some go clockwise.

00:01:43.297 --> 00:01:45.241
You see most toilets have little jets in it,

00:01:45.241 --> 00:01:49.896
so the swirl direction is determined by the design of the toilet and not which hemisphere you're in.

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:01.783
So it's a myth.

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.616
Crossing the equator does not mean the toilet's gonna change directions.

00:02:06.025 --> 00:02:09.181
But what if we come into the garage and do a more controlled experiment?

00:02:12.188 --> 00:02:14.568
This is a one and a half meter kiddy pool.

00:02:18.071 --> 00:02:23.046
Instead of filling the pool with no vorticity at all I'm going against the way it's supposed to drain.

00:02:23.046 --> 00:02:26.707
So I'm trying to fill it with the flow going clockwise.

00:02:34.622 --> 00:02:38.957
So let's let the water settle for a complete day so that we know that it's perfectly still.

00:02:46.126 --> 00:02:50.040
I'm not gonna reach in and pull the plug out because that would induce some vorticity.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.312
I'm gonna use this valve that I have connected to the bottom of the pool.

00:02:58.637 --> 00:02:59.920
Good luck Derek.

00:03:02.241 --> 00:03:06.805
OK opening the valve in 3.. 2.. 1..

00:03:07.818 --> 00:03:09.121
Water should be flowing.

00:03:14.507 --> 00:03:17.397
OK water's been flowing for a couple of minutes and I haven't seen anything yet

00:03:17.397 --> 00:03:19.056
so we're gonna put some dye in it.

00:03:30.101 --> 00:03:33.016
Check it out, it's like a tornado, like right off the bat.

00:03:33.373 --> 00:03:35.094
We've got a counter-clockwise rotation.

00:03:35.271 --> 00:03:38.141
We filled it up clockwise and now it's going counter-clockwise.

00:03:50.116 --> 00:03:55.491
We have a kiddy pool in my garage and the whole earth is rotating,

00:03:55.491 --> 00:03:57.652
and the water is going counter-clockwise,

00:03:57.652 --> 00:03:58.894
because I'm in the northern hemisphere.

00:03:58.894 --> 00:04:01.275
It's real! This is real.

00:04:15.686 --> 00:04:19.348
We just proved it because we just eliminated variables.

00:04:19.348 --> 00:04:21.459
The coriolis effect is real!

00:04:29.074 --> 00:04:31.818
Think about a pool near the north pole.

00:04:36.904 --> 00:04:41.583
The earth is spinning on its axis so the pool spins around the pole once a day.

00:04:47.682 --> 00:04:52.309
The whole pool is moving but the part that's closest to the equator has more momentum

00:04:52.309 --> 00:04:55.060
and the part that's closest to the pole has less.

00:05:02.832 --> 00:05:06.156
Think about these velocities relative to the drain in the middle.

00:05:08.934 --> 00:05:12.546
When we pull the plug, all the water starts moving towards the middle.

00:05:23.084 --> 00:05:27.956
The side nearest the equator is going faster, so that water outruns the drain,

00:05:27.956 --> 00:05:32.009
but the water nearest the pole is going slower so it falls behind.

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:36.351
So when the water approaches the drain, it swirls counter-clockwise.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.871
This is the reason hurricanes swirl counter-clockwise in the northern hemisphere.

00:05:45.682 --> 00:05:48.716
The center of the hurricane has lower pressure just like a drain,

00:05:48.716 --> 00:05:51.486
so the hurricane swirls just like our pool.

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:01.549
And that's the truth about toilet swirl.

00:06:02.059 --> 00:06:03.961
That was awesome. What'd you think?

00:06:08.065 --> 00:06:11.725
It's the first internet experiment from two different locations.

00:06:11.756 --> 00:06:12.775
Pretty cool stuff, but you..

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:13.104
- So..

00:06:15.776 --> 00:06:16.132
- Nope.

00:06:17.272 --> 00:06:18.615
Subscribe to Derek.

00:06:18.838 --> 00:06:21.301
I'm gonna actually go to his channel and make sure that you end up over there.

00:06:21.301 --> 00:06:24.442
Let's go to Veritasium, invade it and subscribe it. Let's go, here we go.

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:28.547
- Oh hey, these are some of my subscribers.

00:06:28.547 --> 00:06:29.830
I am so glad to see you here.

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:31.913
While you're here subscribe to Destin's channel.

00:06:35.726 --> 00:06:36.728
This is a good looking channel.

00:06:36.728 --> 00:06:37.434
I like your logo.

00:06:37.434 --> 00:06:39.421
That's.. I like what you've got going on over here.

00:06:42.862 --> 00:06:47.232
- OK I hope you enjoyed this really interesting collaborative episode of Smarter Every Day.

00:06:47.232 --> 00:06:52.697
I want to thank 100% Derek Muller, Dr Derek Muller of Veritasium.

00:06:52.697 --> 00:06:53.341
- Thank you Destin.

00:06:53.341 --> 00:06:54.897
- No, so here's the deal. Seriously.

00:06:54.897 --> 00:06:58.414
We came up with this three years ago.

00:06:58.414 --> 00:06:58.935
- No lie.

00:06:58.935 --> 00:07:02.519
- No lie, three years ago at YouTube headquarters we decided we were gonna collaborate.

00:07:02.519 --> 00:07:05.825
Derek did his version almost immediately.

00:07:05.825 --> 00:07:06.725
- Two years ago.

00:07:06.725 --> 00:07:08.594
- Two years ago, so it only took him a year.

00:07:08.594 --> 00:07:14.520
It took me.. Derek basically had to fly to Alabama to help me do it. [laughs]

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.719
- It's like if I don't come here, this is never gonna get done.

00:07:16.719 --> 00:07:21.868
- Alright so Derek flew to Alabama and we.. here we are, preparing this pool in the middle of the night.

00:07:21.868 --> 00:07:26.775
So, what I'm trying to tell you is, I want you to go to Derek's channel and subscribe.

00:07:26.775 --> 00:07:28.337
This is a very hard push.

00:07:28.337 --> 00:07:31.200
Go to Veritasium, subscribe to Veritasium.

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:32.692
He does all kinds of physics stuff.

00:07:32.692 --> 00:07:34.782
It's really cool, you will enjoy it.

00:07:34.782 --> 00:07:35.949
I'm telling you that right now.

00:07:35.949 --> 00:07:37.465
We've been friends for a really long time.

00:07:37.465 --> 00:07:39.322
Our channels are about the same size.

00:07:39.322 --> 00:07:42.495
Just.. You should be subscribed to Veritasium.

00:07:42.495 --> 00:07:44.752
So I will suggest that to you now. Just click on Derek.

00:07:44.752 --> 00:07:46.087
- Click on my face.

00:07:46.087 --> 00:07:47.522
- Click on his face, do that.

00:07:47.522 --> 00:07:49.323
And.. you ready to drain this pool?

00:07:49.323 --> 00:07:50.392
- Let's drain this pool.

00:07:50.392 --> 00:07:51.435
- I think it's been three years.

00:07:51.435 --> 00:07:53.194
- I've been waiting three years to drain this pool.

00:07:53.194 --> 00:07:57.600
- [laughs] Go subscribe to Veritasium. I'm Destin, you're getting Smarter Every Day.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.063
Have a good one.
