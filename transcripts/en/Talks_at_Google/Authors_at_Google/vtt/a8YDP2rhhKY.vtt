[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.215 --> 00:00:10.010
CECILIA: I'm super excited
to have Robin Lowey today

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.120
that has joined us to talk
about her "Game Changers" book.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.110
And both Google and Gagglers
are happy to welcome you,

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.180
and I know she's going
to give her life story.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.410
So without further ado, Robin.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:22.910
Thank you.

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:24.243
ROBIN LOWEY: Thank you, Cecilia.

00:00:24.243 --> 00:00:25.235
Gosh, what a pleasure.

00:00:25.235 --> 00:00:26.630
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.200
What a pleasure to be
here with you guys.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.600
Let's see, I wanted
to just start out

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.532
with a quick introduction.

00:00:34.532 --> 00:00:35.990
My name's Robin
Lowey, as she said.

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:40.340
And I started this blog called
"Epochalips: Smart Lesbian

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.770
Commentary" about
eight years ago,

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.730
just inviting lesbians to
like tell their stories,

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.990
and I publish events and just
interesting things, authors,

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:52.410
things like that.

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.050
So it kind of led
me to the book.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.820
But before we get
started, I wanted

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.931
to just ask your advice about--

00:00:58.931 --> 00:01:00.300
about my Halloween costume.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.040
I had two choices.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.440
One is the clowns.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.470
And these are clown candidates.

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.850
It says, you know, vote Flappy
and Crappy for Congress.

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.150
That was pretty funny.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.630
So we tried that one on, and
we tried on the cat costume

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.376
so which do you
think we should do?

00:01:17.376 --> 00:01:18.292
AUDIENCE: Cats.

00:01:18.292 --> 00:01:19.670
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] clowns.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:20.690
ROBIN LOWEY: Oh,
you like clowns.

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:21.315
That's so good.

00:01:21.315 --> 00:01:23.510
So they scare people.

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.260
Anyway, I'd like to be a
little scarier than-- you know,

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.920
I don't know.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.190
Anyway--

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:30.440
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] tonight.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.880
ROBIN LOWEY: OK.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:31.963
Yeah, maybe we'll do that.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.194
So this is the agenda today.

00:01:37.194 --> 00:01:39.110
We're just going to talk
a little bit about me

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.120
and a few other things.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.217
You can take a look at that.

00:01:44.217 --> 00:01:45.550
And we have some good giveaways.

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.930
OK, growing up, I didn't
have any role models really.

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.410
It was a pretty scary
time in the '60s and '70s.

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:56.740
And when I first moved here
to California from Chicago,

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.370
I was about seven.

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.630
And I rode my Stingray around.

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.660
It looked just like that,
actually, and without a shirt

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.600
on until that just
wasn't OK anymore.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.340
And what we did was--

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.360
what I did was like beat
up boys after school.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.790
We'd sneak out at night.

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.560
We were just trouble,
my friends and I.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.190
And, you know, it became
evident early on that--

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.410
that I really liked
girls, and I was just--

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.560
I would stand in front of the
mirror, and flex my muscles,

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.067
and I had two ideas in my head
that I was sure about, one

00:02:34.067 --> 00:02:35.650
that I was never
going to marry a man,

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.600
and, two, that I was never
going to have a baby.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.000
So those things ended up--
one of them ended up changing.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.840
But I was so--

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.110
I couldn't have been more
sure of anything in my life.

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.820
Now, I also was a
big sandlot softball

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:52.820
player, baseball player.

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.730
And I wanted to play
Little League so bad.

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.010
And I was really good.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.380
And at that time-- and
this was pre Title IX.

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.200
If you can imagine, they
didn't have to let girls play.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.420
So I wasn't allowed to play.

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.160
So I joined a bobby
socks softball

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.580
team, which was called
the Great American Girls.

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.960
And we had a coach who was
kind of a butchy mom type.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.470
And we all had big brothers,
and we played so hard.

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.140
We were sliding into home
and saying no batter.

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.500
And we handily won
the championship,

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.740
and then at the end when they
were passing out the trophies,

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:28.870
it ended up that
they said, I'm sorry,

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.360
but the great American
girls are disqualified.

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.810
We're going to give the
trophy to the Buttercups

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.060
because the Great
American Girls did not

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.110
play in a lady-like manner.

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.050
So if you can
imagine a time when

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:46.150
it was not OK to be
competitive or a tomboy--

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:51.410
so that was the message I was
getting pretty loud and clear.

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.480
OK, so then when I
became a teenager,

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:54.892
I applied to be a park ranger.

00:03:54.892 --> 00:03:56.350
And I became the
first park ranger.

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.014
This is a shot of me with
a current park ranger

00:03:59.014 --> 00:04:00.430
that I ran into,
and I didn't have

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.712
to wear the man pants
and the man boots.

00:04:02.712 --> 00:04:05.170
At the time, I could wear like
cute tennis shoes and really

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.003
tight pants, like the
kind that you lay down

00:04:07.003 --> 00:04:12.070
and zip up and a big old shirt
with badges and a big key ring.

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:13.790
And I just thought
that was so cool.

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.300
And I would stand around
daydreaming about the girl I

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:18.820
was crushed out on.

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.120
Then I got to high school.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.930
And I really tried
hard to be straight.

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.700
You know, I had a very
feminine look, and I just--

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.190
I got a lot of
attention from men,

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.690
and so I just didn't
know what to do.

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.880
So I tried really hard,
and it didn't work.

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.660
When I got to college,
I went to a summer

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:43.120
in Europe, where I met
another woman who was also

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.036
had never been with a girl, and
we both were stumbling around.

00:04:48.036 --> 00:04:49.160
It was a very awkward time.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.140
But we got through it.

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:54.430
And then after that, I finally
moved to San Francisco, where

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.700
I finally found my people.

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.940
And we lived on
Castro Street in 1982.

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.760
I met this woman, and
we started a family

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:03.930
after about seven years.

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:07.680
We each had a boy.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.520
My brother was the
donor for the older boy.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.590
And then she couldn't get
pregnant again the second time

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.510
we wanted to, and
so I had to step up,

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:23.100
and it was terribly difficult
as an athlete to be pregnant.

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.040
And that picture on the
bottom is my son and I.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.090
We look exactly the same.

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:30.330
I gotta say, it's one of
the most empowering things

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.380
that I've ever been
through, like an Amazon,

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:35.490
like to give birth, like, here
I was a little kid thinking

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:39.510
I can never do this, and it
ended up being really awesome

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:43.800
except for ruining my body,
and he cried for five-years

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:44.790
straight pretty much.

00:05:47.021 --> 00:05:49.020
But when he got a little
older-- and it was cool

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.360
because I couldn't have
really had a baby with a man.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.480
I wasn't really that
great with infants.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.600
And my ex partner loved
to just stay home.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:58.494
I worked really hard.

00:05:58.494 --> 00:05:59.910
I was so happy to
go back to work,

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:02.070
and she took care
of the infants.

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:05.190
And so they're really good kids.

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:07.850
So then at this
time, we head to--

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:09.570
OK, we were the first
wave of parents.

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:14.280
Other people were having
children that were older

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.320
than us, but there was
no real group of parents.

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.090
So we were in San
Francisco at this time

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:24.300
when we had like a gay PTA, and
we had a very inclusive campus,

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.220
and it was just-- it
was nice, you know?

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:28.140
But we still had
to do this thing

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:31.260
where we adopted each other's
kids because we couldn't

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.350
be legally the parent
of our own child-- or I

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:37.350
couldn't be the legal parent
of the child she gave birth to

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:38.190
and vice versa.

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:41.760
So we had to literally give
up our children to each other,

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.165
and the judge would just--

00:06:43.165 --> 00:06:44.790
I remember we had to
go to court twice,

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:47.020
and he would just like
point at us and say,

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:48.853
are you sure you want
to give up your child?

00:06:48.853 --> 00:06:51.870
And I'm like, oh my god,
it was really intense.

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:53.010
And then we got married.

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:55.320
We went down to City Hall.

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.240
Gavin Newsom made
it OK to go down.

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:01.500
And we ran down there,
and it was exciting.

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.570
And my youngest
was eight, and he

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:06.117
was like, oh, yay, this means
you'll be married forever.

00:07:06.117 --> 00:07:07.200
You'll always be together.

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.270
And, unfortunately,
that wasn't the case.

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:11.610
But what happened that
was cool about that

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:14.850
was that he-- you know,
he just felt so validated

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:16.440
by us being able to be married.

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:19.355
So I feel like that's
such an important--

00:07:19.355 --> 00:07:20.730
it's just an
important thing when

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:24.890
you think about the whole
right for same-sex marriage,

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:29.490
that the kids are the ones that
are being hurt by it so much.

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:36.090
So we got our marriage
certificate mailed back

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:37.650
to us after about--

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:40.320
I think it was less than a month
later, it arrived in the mail

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:44.460
as annulled, because
the law didn't stick.

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:47.940
So then at that point,
we moved to Marin County.

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:49.410
That's where I grew
up, as you saw.

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:52.950
And I wanted my kids to
have a more rural existence.

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:58.790
So I brought them to Marin,
and my oldest came home saying,

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:02.970
oh, god, mommy, why is everybody
saying you're so gay, you fag.

00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:04.440
And he just didn't understand.

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.109
It was shocking for him.

00:08:06.109 --> 00:08:08.400
And I was like, well, we're
not living in San Francisco

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:09.483
it's not a bubble anymore.

00:08:09.483 --> 00:08:13.872
So he became the kind of kid
who told his friends, look,

00:08:13.872 --> 00:08:16.330
I'm not going to be your friend
if you say stuff like that,

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:17.460
and you know, I don't know.

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:22.110
I got-- I got motivated
to go into the schools

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:26.220
and become a speaker for
the LGBT Speakers Bureau,

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:29.010
to be a coach for the
Little League team,

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:32.940
to coach for soccer, and just
be visible and like help them.

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:34.614
I mean, like,
things would happen,

00:08:34.614 --> 00:08:37.030
like, I'd have kids over for
the soccer party and I'd say,

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:38.900
Timmy, what are you
doing out there?

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:41.679
And he'd say, oh, we're playing
smear the queer, you know,

00:08:41.679 --> 00:08:42.720
in the backyard.

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.070
I'm like, what?

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:45.180
And, you know, so--

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:46.890
and it just went on and on.

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:49.560
Some of the dads would say, wow,
you really remind me of Ellen,

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:50.340
and I'm like, why?

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:51.256
I don't look like her.

00:08:51.256 --> 00:08:53.520
And we just had--

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:56.940
there was a lot of
homophobia in Marin,

00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:59.850
and I think about all the
people in the outlying areas

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:00.370
right now.

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:03.430
I mean, we live
in such a bubble.

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:08.640
So I got the idea to write this
book, which is about lesbian

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:11.570
heroes of my generation.

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:15.060
And the women that they
looked up to weren't--

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:16.470
it wasn't like they were bad.

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:20.400
It was just that the role
models weren't very positive.

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:24.150
So they passed a law called,
the Fair Education Act

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:27.000
kind of recently, and it
really got me excited,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.310
like, this was something
that I could contribute to.

00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:31.680
I could-- I'm a graphic
designer, and an editor,

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:32.430
and a curator.

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:35.450
And I have a huge circle
of people that I know.

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:38.310
And I just thought I can make a
really fun book that teenagers

00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:39.610
are going to love.

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:45.527
And so what this law does is it
requires LGBT education as far

00:09:45.527 --> 00:09:47.610
as history and social
studies in the public school

00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:49.290
curriculum in California.

00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:52.050
And right now, there
it's not really

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:53.770
like the curriculum exists.

00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:56.760
It's not like really
there's resources for them.

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:59.340
I attended a
symposium last week,

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:02.284
or two weeks ago,
where we got in a room

00:10:02.284 --> 00:10:04.200
and did a whole big think
tank about how we're

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:05.470
going to get this to happen.

00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:08.250
And it's clearly
a couple years out

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:10.050
before there'll really
be a lot of things

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:11.610
available to students.

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:16.320
And especially public schools
don't have a lot of resources

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.640
to spend on stuff like this.

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:20.040
So I got it in my head that
I wanted to make this book

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:23.010
and donate it to the
public high schools

00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:26.130
in Marin, San Francisco,
Oakland, and Berkeley.

00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:29.520
So what I did was I
decided to go crowdfunding.

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:31.710
And I got to say, if
you're a little insecure,

00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:35.940
and you have a full time job,
this is a brutal way to go.

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:39.150
I was-- it was so excruciating.

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:40.140
I went at it--

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:44.070
two different runs at it,
each for about $10,000.

00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:46.560
And, no, the money's
not all from my family.

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:49.840
It really did get spread
out amongst about 200 people

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:52.380
at an average of
about $100 each.

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:56.090
It required, you know, live
Facebook videos, you know, yay,

00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:57.860
you know, so scary.

00:10:57.860 --> 00:10:59.790
Anyway, so I got all
that money, and then

00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:01.920
I was able to print
the books, and I

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:04.620
was able to deliver them to
the 48 public high schools,

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:07.750
and it serves about
49,000 students now.

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:09.440
And these schools
have invited me in

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:11.370
to talk in their classroom.

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:14.670
I've been able to just
share with these kids

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:15.850
and hear their stories.

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:19.080
And I had one girl
come up to me just

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:20.760
in tears saying,
oh, my god, I can't

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:22.140
believe you're really here.

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:23.150
And she had--

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:24.780
I had these books
kind of sprinkled

00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:27.087
around some bookstores
too like in the Castro.

00:11:27.087 --> 00:11:28.920
And she said, I got
your book in the Castro.

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:30.360
And I'm-- I'm just--

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:31.770
I can't believe it, you know?

00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:33.040
She was hugging me and crying.

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:36.400
It was like so gratifying.

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:39.870
So I wanted to show you
my crowdfunding video.

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:42.788
See if I can get this to play.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:44.864 --> 00:11:46.280
- My name is Robin
Lowey, and I've

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:49.850
been curator and editor of
"Epochalips: Smart Lesbian

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:53.180
Commentary" for
the past six years.

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:56.210
As a pioneering lesbian
mom with two grown sons,

00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:58.700
I turned to my
youngest, Sam, age 20,

00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:01.520
to talk about what this book
means to him personally.

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:05.870
- I was raised in Marin
County by two lesbian moms.

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:08.810
As I grew up and went to
elementary and middle school,

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:11.210
I noticed that we were never
taught about gay people

00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:12.570
or their history.

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:14.540
So because of that
lack of education,

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:17.270
gay slurs were
rampant around campus,

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:19.329
and it was always kind
of a struggle for me.

00:12:19.329 --> 00:12:21.620
I think it can help not only
heterosexual students that

00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:24.770
are unclear about what
being gay really means,

00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:27.470
as well as kids that might
be coming out of the closet

00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:29.600
and just want to find their
own place in the world

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:31.070
and be accepted in life.

00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:33.080
- If you could spread
the word to your network,

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:34.490
it would be a great help.

00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:36.061
So thank you so
much for your time.

[END PLAYBACK]

00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:41.890
ROBIN LOWEY: Anyway, I asked him
to say that in his own words,

00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:43.348
and he kind of gave
me a hard time.

00:12:43.348 --> 00:12:44.954
He's, like, I'm not going to--

00:12:44.954 --> 00:12:46.870
I don't-- mommy, I don't
know what-- you know?

00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:50.172
And I was like, oh,
no, and then I just--

00:12:50.172 --> 00:12:51.880
and then one day, he
goes, OK, I'm ready.

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:55.990
And I just went outside and
filmed him with my iPhone.

00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:57.890
I got pretty lucky there.

00:12:57.890 --> 00:13:00.070
It's a good boy, and he's not--

00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:01.750
he's-- yeah.

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:05.410
Anyway, so then I
also got books ordered

00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:08.020
from schools and libraries
all over the United States.

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:10.750
People were hitting me up in
like North Carolina, and Texas,

00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:13.512
and it was just-- it's
been super exciting.

00:13:13.512 --> 00:13:15.970
I'm down to my last few books,
which I brought for you guys

00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:16.570
to raffle off.

00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:18.340
So you're pretty lucky.

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:22.330
Then I won an award
for the best LGBTQ book

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:26.290
by this Next Generation Indie
Book Awards, which was quite--

00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:27.730
it's quite an
honor, and I really

00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:29.622
didn't understand that
it was such an honor.

00:13:29.622 --> 00:13:31.330
I was kind of like,
oh, I got this award,

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:33.220
and then someone
told me, I've been

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:34.610
trying to win that for years.

00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:36.080
I can't believe you--

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:36.940
had anyway.

00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:40.120
So here's a brief
history of queer culture.

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:41.650
I just want to back
up a little bit

00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:44.950
and talk about that the
women in the book, this

00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:47.620
is the kind of world
that I was a little girl,

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:49.717
and they were little girls in.

00:13:49.717 --> 00:13:50.550
This is what we had.

00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:54.400
OK, so there's Sappho, who
obviously was the first written

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.710
word of a sonnet
to another woman

00:13:56.710 --> 00:14:00.760
that is arguably like the
beginning of lesbianism.

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:04.060
And then Radclyffe Hall
came along in like 1929,

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:08.680
and she wrote a book called
"The Well of Loneliness."

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:10.510
It was in the court
system in the UK

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:12.460
for a long time for obscenity.

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:14.770
And it finally
made it to the US.

00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:16.540
There was no explicit
sexual content

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:17.720
in this book whatsoever.

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:21.100
It was just that there was
a mannish heroine, who was--

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:23.050
I guess she liked girls.

00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:25.180
And then Gertrude Stein was--

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:28.510
in the 1930s, she was the
first visible lesbian here

00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:30.430
in America.

00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:33.040
She was from Oakland,
and she wrote

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:35.380
those famous quotes, a
rose is a rose is a rose,

00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:38.890
and there is no there there,
in regards to Oakland.

00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:43.930
And she ran a salon like in
Paris with people like F. Scott

00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:46.270
Fitzgerald, and
Ernest Hemingway,

00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:50.980
and Matisse, Picasso, all
these big thinkers at the time

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:52.252
would sit around and--

00:14:52.252 --> 00:14:53.710
and then she got
famous for writing

00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:56.800
the book about her
partner, Alice B. Toklas

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:58.840
called "The Autobiography
of Alice B. Toklas,"

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:00.010
which is kind of random.

00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:02.500
She did it in the
voice of her partner.

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:06.430
And just as an added
fun fact, my parents

00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:08.860
named our cat Alice
and then later came

00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:11.420
to light that his name was--
her name was Alice B. Toklas.

00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:13.360
This is when I
was a little girl.

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:15.650
So that happened.

00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:18.580
OK, so then this genre
called pulp fiction emerged,

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:21.216
and it had to do with
just cheap paper.

00:15:21.216 --> 00:15:22.840
That's why they called
it pulp fiction,

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:24.423
and it was the first
time that America

00:15:24.423 --> 00:15:28.600
could buy just paperbacks
cheaply at a newsstand,

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:30.430
and, you know, you
might finish reading it

00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:31.984
and leave it on
your seat on the bus

00:15:31.984 --> 00:15:33.400
and someone else
would pick it up.

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:36.730
And so it was just
a way to get masses

00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:38.530
to be reading literature.

00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:42.430
And then within that genre, it
became lesbian pulp fiction,

00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:44.590
and, oh, my notes.

00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:46.110
Could you grab
those for me, Jane?

00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:51.190
Anyway, so if you wrote
this book, a lot of times

00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:54.070
that women had pseudonyms
that were men's names.

00:15:54.070 --> 00:16:00.160
And you-- the publishers
required that you had to say--

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:03.730
you literally had to have
a heroine either die--

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:05.530
these are not them.

00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:07.210
It's in my bag.

00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:11.560
Anyway, back to-- back to
the lesbian pulp fiction.

00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:15.160
So you had to have the heroine
either die, go back to men,

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.860
or go crazy, just like
the films at the time.

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:19.720
It was-- this is what
we had to look up to.

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:20.590
This is what we saw.

00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:21.610
Yay!

00:16:21.610 --> 00:16:23.560
Thank you, Jane.

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:27.430
OK, so I want to
just read you a quote

00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:30.160
of a woman who is a kind
of an interesting writer.

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:31.630
She's probably 80 now.

00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:34.750
So she said, "A lesbian
pulp fiction paperback first

00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:36.550
appeared before my
disbelieving eyes

00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:39.130
in Detroit, Michigan in 1957.

00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:41.560
I didn't need to look
at the title for clues.

00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:44.050
The cover leapt out at me
from the drugstore rack.

00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:47.080
A young woman with sensuous--
sensuous intent on her face

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:49.810
seated on a bed, leaning
over a prone woman, her hands

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:51.370
on the other woman shoulders.

00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:54.100
Overwhelming need led me
to walk a gauntlet of fear

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:57.490
up to the cash register, fear so
intense that I remember nothing

00:16:57.490 --> 00:17:00.400
more, only that I stumbled
out of the store in possession

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:04.450
of what I knew I must have, a
book as necessary to me as air.

00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:06.819
The book was 'Odd Girl
Out' by Ann Bannon.

00:17:06.819 --> 00:17:08.829
I found it when I
was 18 years old.

00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:11.319
It opened the door to my
soul and told me who I was,

00:17:11.319 --> 00:17:13.660
and it led me to other
books that told some of us

00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:15.940
who we were and how
some of us lived."

00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:19.839
So just to imagine a time where
this-- something like this

00:17:19.839 --> 00:17:22.720
would be so forbidden
and so awesome

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:26.079
to like not have any vision
of yourself out in the world.

00:17:26.079 --> 00:17:28.510
And then you got
this kind of one

00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:32.710
that wasn't so great because he
didn't have to die or go crazy.

00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:36.760
So in this one, things started
to change a little in the '50s.

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:40.470
Women's barracks actually
was about a real couple

00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:42.510
with a real relationship
a little bit.

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:45.210
And so it came under the
scrutiny of the house

00:17:45.210 --> 00:17:47.180
un-American
Activities Committee,

00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:49.560
where they had it
up for obscenity,

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:53.100
and they said, "Lesbianism
was a sociological

00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:55.920
disease and a cause for
grave national concern.

00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:56.950
It could not be cured.

00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:59.650
But it must be
understood as a tragedy."

00:17:59.650 --> 00:18:01.885
So it was accused of
promoting moral degeneracy.

00:18:01.885 --> 00:18:04.260
This is because they crossed
that line where they weren't

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:06.270
having an unhappy ending.

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:09.352
And I mean, I'm actually
not sure about the ending,

00:18:09.352 --> 00:18:11.310
but the fact that there
was a real relationship

00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:14.970
was just too much, kind
of the McCarthy era

00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:16.900
too or a little
later, but anyway--

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:18.660
but it helped really
increase the sales,

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:22.740
and they sold like four
million copies of that.

00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:25.680
So this other book, "The
Price of Salt," this was--

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:27.209
did you see the
movie "Carol" that

00:18:27.209 --> 00:18:28.500
came out a couple of years ago.

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:32.100
This was the movie with
Cate Blanchett, I guess.

00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:35.340
And this was the movie
that they wrote it about.

00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:37.380
And that one sort of
had a happy ending where

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:39.300
the woman got to stay together.

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:44.130
She lost her child,
but it wasn't all rosy.

00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:46.920
Anyway, so during that same
time was an underground gay bar

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:48.090
culture.

00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:51.960
And I guess it's saying that gay
men and lesbians were now seen

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:54.900
as a group to cure,
convert, and suppress.

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:57.307
So the American public started
to get wind of this thing,

00:18:57.307 --> 00:18:59.140
and they got-- they
were getting really mad.

00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:01.090
You can't be out in public.

00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:03.210
And so they were
rounding up people.

00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:06.000
This is around the
time of Stonewall.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.380
So these women here--

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:11.520
there you know, it was a butch
and femme culture, and, like,

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:12.150
you--

00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:13.920
you could get caught
for not wearing

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:17.249
three things of the same--

00:19:17.249 --> 00:19:19.290
three articles of clothing
of the assigned gender

00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:20.831
that you were, you
be thrown in jail.

00:19:20.831 --> 00:19:25.200
So I'm not sure if I would be
thrown in jail, hopefully not.

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:28.860
But they had little signals,
like, they'd flash the lights.

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:31.547
And everyone would switch
to the opposite sex partners

00:19:31.547 --> 00:19:33.880
so that they wouldn't be like
thrown in the paddy wagon,

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:36.390
but they were risking
everything, their jobs,

00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:40.440
their lives, their families,
just to be able to congregate.

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:42.150
Now, at that same
time was this thing

00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:44.894
called a couple of
different secret societies

00:19:44.894 --> 00:19:45.810
daughters of elitists.

00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:47.964
This is Phyllis
Lyon and Del Martin.

00:19:47.964 --> 00:19:49.380
And their thing
was that they were

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:51.546
kind of the intellectual
set, and they didn't really

00:19:51.546 --> 00:19:54.660
want to be associated with
like the working class,

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:56.610
butch-femme scene.

00:19:56.610 --> 00:19:59.400
They wanted to be able to
have a literary magazine they

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:00.150
could send around.

00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:03.000
And so they sent it in
like a brown paper bag.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.100
And so people all
over the country

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:08.190
were getting some
culture now finally.

00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:10.650
So now I'm going to talk
a little bit about my game

00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:12.750
changers in the book.

00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:16.290
So the way I set
this up was I chose

00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:20.250
women who are not famous
in the world at large.

00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:23.650
They're famous amongst the
gay and lesbian community.

00:20:23.650 --> 00:20:25.980
So we have authors,
businesswomen, promoters,

00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:28.830
actors, publishers,
entertainers, lawyers,

00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:31.140
everybody that I
could gather together

00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:35.790
that was connected to me on
some first or second degree that

00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:37.860
was willing to give me
all these pieces I needed

00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:38.985
to pull this book together.

00:20:38.985 --> 00:20:42.120
So you don't see people like
Ellen and Rosie O'Donnell

00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:44.340
and stuff in here because
they're already famous,

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:47.100
but it's more like our
heroes that actually created

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:49.560
real changes to the culture
for the young people

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:51.780
today to know about.

00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:57.180
So this woman, Monica
Palacios, she was named--

00:20:57.180 --> 00:21:00.890
they had a Monaco Palacios
day for her 30-year career,

00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:04.770
as a kind of lesbian
performer and writer.

00:21:04.770 --> 00:21:07.920
This is Judy Dlugacz.

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:10.800
She is the Olivia person.

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:13.366
So they started Olivia in
'73 as a music company,

00:21:13.366 --> 00:21:15.240
and then now it's like
a multi-million dollar

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:16.470
corporation.

00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:19.240
And she's doing really well.

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:21.540
And, you know, I've been
on a lot of these trips,

00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:23.640
and I always find
it fascinating.

00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:27.120
Women from across the country
that don't live in our bubble

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:31.260
save up all year long to be
able to afford this one week

00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:33.210
to be able to hold
their partner's hand

00:21:33.210 --> 00:21:34.700
and be out for a week.

00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:36.170
It's incredible.

00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:40.080
It's-- I always forget
just how lucky we are here.

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:42.630
And this woman, Crystal
Jang, is really interesting.

00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:46.710
Each person had a page also
that had like a pull-out card,

00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:47.730
which I'll show you.

00:21:47.730 --> 00:21:50.700
But Crystal, she
was born and raised

00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:57.180
in Chinatown, and as a young
woman in the '70s, during that

00:21:57.180 --> 00:21:59.790
time, the Health Department
was sending people out

00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:02.411
to different communities
to talk about, wow,

00:22:02.411 --> 00:22:04.410
there's gay and lesbian
people in the community,

00:22:04.410 --> 00:22:06.220
and you need to address this.

00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:08.620
And so when they
got to Chinatown,

00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:10.810
I guess the mayor of
Chinatown guy says, look,

00:22:10.810 --> 00:22:13.060
we don't have any gay
people in Chinatown.

00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:15.634
And so Crystal
was just a young--

00:22:15.634 --> 00:22:16.800
I think she was an educator.

00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:18.190
She could lose her job.

00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:20.850
She stood up, and she said,
my name is Crystal Jang.

00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:24.210
My parents are Esther and
Homer Jang, and I'm a lesbian.

00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:25.950
And it just like
brought the house down,

00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:28.510
and people were crying
and coming up to her.

00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:30.450
And so she was the
first one to like

00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:32.070
take a stand in the
Chinese community,

00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:34.290
and it's just so important
she brought together

00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:38.100
the whole Asian
community in one,

00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:41.430
you know, as a force in the
gay and lesbian community

00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:42.280
within that.

00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:44.280
And Jewelle Gomez, this
is the fun fact cards

00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:45.155
that are in the book.

00:22:45.155 --> 00:22:46.870
They're like little
baseball cards.

00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:48.330
She's a playwright.

00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:53.400
She does lesbian vampire
novels, and she does, you know,

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:55.740
James Baldwin-inspired plays.

00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:57.900
She's fantastic.

00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:00.492
This is The Dinah.

00:23:00.492 --> 00:23:02.480
This is Mariah Hanson.

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:04.850
And what people don't
know so much about her--

00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:06.558
I don't know if you
know about The Dinah.

00:23:06.558 --> 00:23:09.830
It's the largest lesbian
event in the world, I guess.

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:13.700
And zillions of lesbians
descend on Las Vegas,

00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:16.080
I mean, Palm
Springs once a year.

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:19.550
And she has discovered acts
like Lady Gaga, Katy Perry.

00:23:19.550 --> 00:23:21.880
She's the first one
to have them out.

00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:26.810
And so that is really a
big hotspot for culture.

00:23:26.810 --> 00:23:32.120
Kate Kendell, who as
leader of NCLR, she--

00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:37.310
they are the ones that brought
gay marriage to be legal.

00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:40.190
They're the ones that
fought the fight.

00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:41.370
This is an interesting one.

00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:43.400
This Diane
Anderson-Minshall, she's

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:45.410
a woman I worked with years ago.

00:23:45.410 --> 00:23:47.460
And she had a partner that--

00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:50.450
Suzy, just kind of a
average kind of quiet gal.

00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:53.750
And then over the years,
Suzy transitioned to Jake.

00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:57.150
And Jake is this swaggering,
handsome dude now.

00:23:57.150 --> 00:23:59.000
And they are still
married all this time.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.780
And then, you know,
this interests me

00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:02.988
because it begs the question,
is she still a lesbian?

00:24:02.988 --> 00:24:04.130
Well, she think she is.

00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:05.000
I think she is.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.660
So she belongs in there.

00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:09.440
And this is Marga
Gomez, who I got to--

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:12.290
I heard that this
spit take thing became

00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:14.292
like the most famous
meme on the internet,

00:24:14.292 --> 00:24:16.250
and my son, the one in
the video, called me up.

00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:19.010
Mommy, I keep seeing
Marga on video--

00:24:19.010 --> 00:24:21.800
I mean, as a meme online.

00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:24.590
So she's managing
to stay relevant.

00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:28.010
She also has a show right
now in Berkeley called--

00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:29.510
I forget the name.

00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:30.714
But it's-- it's really--

00:24:30.714 --> 00:24:31.880
AUDIENCE: "Latin Standards."

00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:32.810
ROBIN LOWEY: "Latin
Standards," yeah, you

00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:34.270
should definitely go see
that if you get a chance.

00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:36.020
It's playing there
right now at The Marsh.

00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:37.100
It's fantastic.

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:40.130
She plays her dad,
and her mom, and--

00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:43.040
and this is Jenni Olson,
who is the person who

00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:44.331
started PlanetOut.

00:24:44.331 --> 00:24:45.830
I don't know if you
know about that.

00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:47.930
That was one of the
very first websites

00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:50.757
that meant so much to all of
us that our little older--

00:24:50.757 --> 00:24:52.340
it was the first
place where you could

00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:54.590
have a hub of all things gay.

00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:59.030
And my mom takes a look at
this and says, is that a man?

00:24:59.030 --> 00:25:02.460
And I say, no, that's
Jenni, and she's cute.

00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:05.480
OK, so what's next
for game changers?

00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:10.580
Well, I'm hoping to get it
into 267 more schools, which

00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:12.830
would serve an additional 20--

00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:14.010
over 200,000 students.

00:25:14.010 --> 00:25:15.710
And that means every
county in the Bay

00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:19.250
Area, every public high
school, would get a book,

00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:20.500
and we put it--

00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:22.250
you know, I put it in
the wellness centers

00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:23.580
and the libraries.

00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:27.317
I've heard from the wellness
center people in my hometown

00:25:27.317 --> 00:25:29.150
how much it means to
those kids to just walk

00:25:29.150 --> 00:25:30.320
in and like see
that on the table

00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:31.520
because that's who's
typically going

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:32.520
into the wellness
center, someone

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:34.550
who's being bullied or
feeling a little awkward.

00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:37.220
And if they can just pick
this up and have it not

00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:38.400
be a big deal, it's huge.

00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:42.700
And this is why
it's so important

00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:45.280
because it's not just the gay
kids that are going to benefit.

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:46.450
It's the straight kids.

00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:49.210
It's like, gosh, I don't
know, when I was little,

00:25:49.210 --> 00:25:53.182
we didn't have
like a poster of--

00:25:53.182 --> 00:25:54.640
we didn't have
Black History Month.

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:56.848
We didn't have Martin Luther
King in every classroom.

00:25:56.848 --> 00:25:58.030
But now they have that.

00:25:58.030 --> 00:26:00.434
So like I was picturing
soon, in a few years,

00:26:00.434 --> 00:26:02.350
they'll probably have a
picture of Harvey Milk

00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:04.150
in every classroom, a
poster, and that's all great.

00:26:04.150 --> 00:26:06.108
But, like, I want to make
sure the lesbians are

00:26:06.108 --> 00:26:08.830
included that did great things.

00:26:08.830 --> 00:26:11.920
Because women are always left
out of stuff, and the history--

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:16.570
history is always about the
context with which you tell it.

00:26:16.570 --> 00:26:19.060
So, now, oh, we lost it.

00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:19.900
Ta da!

00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:21.910
So the reasons
that it's so great,

00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:24.010
obviously, is it
reduces bullying,

00:26:24.010 --> 00:26:26.260
increases visibility, and
fosters pride and dignity,

00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:29.200
like that girl who just was so
touched that I brought it in.

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:32.380
It just-- it's so important
for people to see themselves.

00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:35.360
Otherwise, you just
feel invisible.

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:38.259
So I'm just asking you guys
to help spread the word today,

00:26:38.259 --> 00:26:39.800
and I have a sign-up
sheet over there

00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:42.430
if you want to keep in touch.

00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:43.700
No.

00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:44.440
Hello?

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:46.231
AUDIENCE: Did you
experience any challenges

00:26:46.231 --> 00:26:49.310
when you tried to
distribute the books?

00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:51.500
AUDIENCE: Sorry, can we
repeat that [INAUDIBLE]??

00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:53.200
ROBIN LOWEY: She asked if we--

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:55.700
OK, she asked if I faced
any challenges when

00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:57.650
trying to distribute the books.

00:26:57.650 --> 00:27:02.810
And, yes, I got a couple of
books mailed back, and then--

00:27:02.810 --> 00:27:03.550
but mostly no.

00:27:03.550 --> 00:27:05.660
Everyone was thrilled
to get it, and I either

00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:07.980
mailed it or personally sent--

00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:10.090
walked into these schools
and gave it to them,

00:27:10.090 --> 00:27:12.860
and I got all the right names
from some educator friends

00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:14.360
so it was going to
the right people.

00:27:18.135 --> 00:27:18.635
Hi.

00:27:18.635 --> 00:27:19.176
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:25.020
This isn't about your
book, but your experience

00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:28.770
of the challenge of parenting
in those situations.

00:27:28.770 --> 00:27:33.390
And do you have any advice on
handling those situations where

00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:37.880
you have other parents that
are not as open minded?

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:41.030
ROBIN LOWEY: Well, that's
a really good question.

00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:44.906
AUDIENCE: And how you've
navigated that over time.

00:27:44.906 --> 00:27:47.280
ROBIN LOWEY: Well, I can only
think of an anecdote that's

00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:47.821
pretty funny.

00:27:47.821 --> 00:27:51.480
When my partner and I
first moved to Marin,

00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:55.380
some parents said to me, oh, we
always wanted a lesbian couple

00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:58.050
in our circle of friends.

00:27:58.050 --> 00:28:00.390
We were like, wow, that's--

00:28:00.390 --> 00:28:01.140
that's exciting.

00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:02.104
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:03.550 --> 00:28:04.890
Yeah, I don't know.

00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:07.226
I mean, I guess I just--

00:28:07.226 --> 00:28:09.570
you know, my son is
actually-- my older son

00:28:09.570 --> 00:28:11.610
is a real big advocate for that.

00:28:11.610 --> 00:28:15.030
He'll just say, oh,
so you're against it?

00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:16.920
I mean, like, you
think if I got hurt,

00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:20.290
my mom shouldn't be able to
pick me up from the hospital?

00:28:20.290 --> 00:28:23.450
Like just point out real facts
about the discrimination,

00:28:23.450 --> 00:28:26.310
and I don't know.

00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:27.330
It's a hard one.

00:28:27.330 --> 00:28:29.200
It's very personal.

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:32.930
I guess I tried to steer
clear of it as much as I could

00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:35.460
and give my kid the tools
to just be proud of himself

00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:41.490
by surrounding him by a positive
environment and being proud.

00:28:41.490 --> 00:28:44.280
Like, I'm really proud that
both my kids are feminists,

00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:47.610
like they just really get
it about the discrimination,

00:28:47.610 --> 00:28:50.220
and they consider
themselves queer.

00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:52.124
They're both
straight, but they--

00:28:52.124 --> 00:28:53.790
they know they were
raised by two women,

00:28:53.790 --> 00:28:54.930
and that has changed them.

00:28:54.930 --> 00:28:56.096
It has made them better men.

00:28:56.096 --> 00:28:59.100
I was thinking, oh, god, you're
bringing two little white boys

00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:00.600
into the world.

00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:03.180
And, you know, at least
they've got this thing

00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:05.770
that makes them
understand that, you know,

00:29:05.770 --> 00:29:08.910
it's not the same level
playing field for all of us.

00:29:08.910 --> 00:29:11.910
It's really important
to know that.

00:29:11.910 --> 00:29:12.840
Anything else?

00:29:18.935 --> 00:29:20.560
AUDIENCE: Do you have
another question?

00:29:22.555 --> 00:29:23.680
ROBIN LOWEY: Keep it going.

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:24.950
AUDIENCE: I'm dominating this.

00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:29.260
OK, do you-- do you have
any recommendations for us

00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:32.620
if we want to approach schools
as well to help distribute

00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:34.006
your book?

00:29:34.006 --> 00:29:36.130
ROBIN LOWEY: Well, you
could contact me afterwards.

00:29:36.130 --> 00:29:37.671
I would love-- I
would love some help

00:29:37.671 --> 00:29:39.250
with that, especially
when it comes

00:29:39.250 --> 00:29:40.750
to delivering it down here.

00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:42.250
I've applied for a
couple of grants,

00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:46.570
and I'm also looking for
people to step up and help.

00:29:46.570 --> 00:29:49.870
So any way you can help,
if it could be distributing

00:29:49.870 --> 00:29:55.870
and something like that would
be fantastic, or giving me

00:29:55.870 --> 00:29:58.840
the right people, and yeah, so
you could sign up over here,

00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:00.719
and I'll be sure to be in touch.

00:30:00.719 --> 00:30:02.260
AUDIENCE: I did have
somebody ping me

00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:03.530
with a question which
is, first of all,

00:30:03.530 --> 00:30:04.700
thank you for being here.

00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:06.820
It's such an
important publication

00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:08.532
and for documenting our history.

00:30:08.532 --> 00:30:10.240
What are your thoughts
on how millennials

00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:13.780
tend to identify more as queer,
that the word lesbian could

00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:15.820
be fading from our lexicon?

00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:18.980
ROBIN LOWEY: Oh, that's
a great question.

00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:22.990
I will say that when I came out,
and the women around my age,

00:30:22.990 --> 00:30:24.200
we didn't have a choice.

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:27.670
It wasn't a choice of
some version of queer.

00:30:27.670 --> 00:30:30.020
It was-- it was you're
a lesbian or you're not.

00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:31.600
Do you like women or not?

00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:34.869
And if we were going to choose
that the harder way, you know,

00:30:34.869 --> 00:30:36.160
then we were going to claim it.

00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:41.050
And so now that it's become
kind of an un-PC word

00:30:41.050 --> 00:30:45.790
to use in general for the youth,
I just have to question it.

00:30:45.790 --> 00:30:48.310
I got a lot of actually flak.

00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:50.534
I got people
e-mailing me saying,

00:30:50.534 --> 00:30:51.950
do you have to use
that ugly word?

00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:53.944
Can't you just say queer?

00:30:53.944 --> 00:30:56.110
And I was like, no, because
it's about the lesbians.

00:30:56.110 --> 00:30:57.590
I mean, that's the whole point.

00:30:57.590 --> 00:30:59.750
But it's an interesting
part of history.

00:30:59.750 --> 00:31:02.540
And it will fade, and it
is fading, and that's OK.

00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:05.080
It's just it's important
to at least understand

00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:09.970
why it was there what happened,
and why we have the freedoms

00:31:09.970 --> 00:31:14.380
that we have today to choose
some version of gay, queer,

00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:15.740
whatever, fluid?

00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:16.750
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:17.458
ROBIN LOWEY: Yes?

00:31:17.458 --> 00:31:19.630
AUDIENCE: My experience
growing up in Toronto

00:31:19.630 --> 00:31:23.200
when I started to try
to tell people, I found

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:25.220
it hard to say I was a lesbian.

00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:31.900
And I would say, you know,
so I would say, I'm gay,

00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:35.770
like, there's something
about the stigma of saying

00:31:35.770 --> 00:31:36.580
you're a lesbian--

00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:37.000
ROBIN LOWEY: Well, you're right.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.260
AUDIENCE: And it started
from the beginning.

00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:39.260
ROBIN LOWEY: Good point.

00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:40.750
AUDIENCE: So almost
in a way, we're

00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:42.970
still not comfortable
saying we're lesbians.

00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:43.761
ROBIN LOWEY: Right.

00:31:43.761 --> 00:31:46.660
It's a misogynistic thought,
if you really think through.

00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:48.430
Why is it so
uncomfortable to talk

00:31:48.430 --> 00:31:51.010
about the woman part
of the gay thing

00:31:51.010 --> 00:31:52.930
and identify strictly as that?

00:31:52.930 --> 00:31:56.260
And when the word gay is such
a happy word, and lesbians,

00:31:56.260 --> 00:31:57.666
like, oh.

00:31:57.666 --> 00:31:58.614
Yes.

00:31:58.614 --> 00:31:59.780
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:03.430
I really resonate
with that, and, yeah,

00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:05.450
it's so interesting
how there's--

00:32:05.450 --> 00:32:08.290
there's that little
hurdle about lesbian.

00:32:08.290 --> 00:32:10.420
So you started
asking what we were

00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:12.620
going to come to Halloween as.

00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:13.870
And I figured it out.

00:32:13.870 --> 00:32:17.407
I'm going to come as a
lesbian, you should know.

00:32:17.407 --> 00:32:18.490
ROBIN LOWEY: That's great.

00:32:18.490 --> 00:32:20.948
AUDIENCE: And I wondered if
you had any thoughts about what

00:32:20.948 --> 00:32:22.360
my costume should look like?

00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:25.220
ROBIN LOWEY: Well, I dressed as
a lesbian once for Halloween.

00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:28.960
And I wore a very
misshapen pillow here,

00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:31.810
and then a big old fanny
pack, and a mullet.

00:32:31.810 --> 00:32:32.710
This was years ago.

00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:34.877
I can't believe I did that.

00:32:34.877 --> 00:32:37.460
AUDIENCE: But that's different
than a lesbian you should know.

00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:39.346
ROBIN LOWEY: Right, of course.

00:32:39.346 --> 00:32:40.840
Hmm.

00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:43.900
AUDIENCE: Maybe do
Gertrude Stein, where

00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:44.890
you could cut your--

00:32:44.890 --> 00:32:46.990
ROBIN LOWEY: Jane was in a play
where she played Gertrude--

00:32:46.990 --> 00:32:47.490
she--

00:32:47.490 --> 00:32:50.260
there was a play called, "All
These Different Gertrudes,"

00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:52.360
and Jane literally cut
her hair for the part

00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:54.724
that night, the worst
haircut I've ever seen.

00:32:54.724 --> 00:32:55.640
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:55.640 --> 00:33:00.260
ROBIN LOWEY: OK, that's
a deal breaker, sorry.

00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:02.590
AUDIENCE: I'm going
as Amelia Earhart.

00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:03.596
ROBIN LOWEY: Nice.

00:33:03.596 --> 00:33:04.263
AUDIENCE: Sweet.

00:33:04.263 --> 00:33:06.054
ROBIN LOWEY: Well, we
don't know about her.

00:33:06.054 --> 00:33:06.879
We have to wonder.

00:33:06.879 --> 00:33:08.670
AUDIENCE: There is--
there is some letters.

00:33:08.670 --> 00:33:09.610
ROBIN LOWEY: Is there?

00:33:09.610 --> 00:33:09.870
Nice.

00:33:09.870 --> 00:33:12.430
AUDIENCE: There was-- there
was a man that was asking her

00:33:12.430 --> 00:33:15.742
to marry him for a really
long time, and she, finally--

00:33:15.742 --> 00:33:17.200
she kept saying
no, no, no, no, no,

00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:19.120
and there's all these letters
back and forth about it,

00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:21.130
and she finally said, at
some point, she's like,

00:33:21.130 --> 00:33:25.100
listen, we all know that
I'm not interested in this.

00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:28.210
But I can't take the pressure
of expectation anymore.

00:33:28.210 --> 00:33:30.790
So if we are going
to do this, you

00:33:30.790 --> 00:33:32.230
have to understand
that I'm going

00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:34.870
to go do my own separate thing.

00:33:34.870 --> 00:33:37.110
And then she was in a
horrible plane accident

00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:38.860
and didn't have to
ever marry anybody.

00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:39.568
ROBIN LOWEY: Wow!

00:33:39.568 --> 00:33:41.822
I wonder if that was rigged.

00:33:41.822 --> 00:33:42.655
Any other questions?

00:33:42.655 --> 00:33:43.280
AUDIENCE: Whoa!

00:33:45.239 --> 00:33:46.030
CECILIA: All right,

00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:46.415
ROBIN LOWEY: Or thoughts?

00:33:46.415 --> 00:33:48.620
CECILIA: Let's think
Robin for coming today.

00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:49.220
Thanks.

00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:51.670
[APPLAUSE]
