00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:02.889
Cosmetic surgery is growing more popular,
worldwide.

00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:07.490
More than 87 percent of all plastic surgery
is performed on women, and the number one

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:08.970
is breast augmentation.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:19.369
Let's bust this wide open.

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:23.909
In the 1940s, Japanese prostitutes would inject
paraffin or sponge into their breasts to increase

00:00:23.909 --> 00:00:25.689
their bust line and attract American soldiers
during World War II.

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:30.220
Then, in 1962, the first silicone breast implantation
was performed in Houston, Texas.

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.070
Now, 50 years later,.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.260
In 2013, there were more than 23 million surgical
and nonsurgical cosmetic procedures performed

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.039
worldwide and the most common, at 1.77 million,
were breast implant surgeries!

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:47.829
Breasts are a collection of fat, milk-producing
lobules, lymph nodes, and connective tissues.

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:50.460
No two are alike, even on the same person!

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.820
They sit on top of pectoral muscles, over
the ribs and, as you likely know, exist for

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.559
breast feeding infants, but have other social
purposes as well.

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:03.350
They're continually developing until the age
of 22, and their size is both genetically

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.980
and environmentally determined; hormone or
chemical exposure, diet and genetics will

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:13.230
all affect their size, but in the end, some
augment their breast tissue with a prosthetic

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:14.230
implant.

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:20.640
In the US, most implants are made of a contoured
or round synthetic polymer called elastomer.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:28.350
The sizes are measured in cubic centimeters,
and each cup-size is 175 to 200 ccs of fluid.

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:35.060
In 2012, 72 percent contained silicone, and
28 percent a sterile saline solution -- a

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.280
basic medical grade salt water.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:43.560
Silicone was banned by the FDA from 1992 because
of concerns over the implant rupturing, but

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.060
in 2006 the ban was lifted after significant
testing.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.230
There are three types of breast implant surgeries.

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:54.750
Under the breast tissue alone, MOSTLY under
the pectoralis major muscle and ENTIRELY under

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.170
the pectoralis major.

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.490
The implant can be inserted through an incision
around the areola incision to limit scar tissue,

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.811
in the crease of the breast for when the crease
needs moving anyway, through the armpit, to

00:02:05.811 --> 00:02:12.540
avoid breast scarring or damage, or even through
the belly button!

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.330
Once inserted the implants are inflated with
fluid, positioned, and voila!

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.030
It's a surgery, so it takes time for body
has to heal, and patients must essentially

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.760
do physical therapy during that process.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.480
The human body doesn't enjoy having things
inserted into it, so as it heals the immune

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.960
system will begin creating scar tissue around
the implant.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.100
A new method for silicone implants from the
UK uses a textured surface on the exterior

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:43.530
of the implant which mimics other surfaces
in the body, but scar tissues are pretty much

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:44.620
inevitable.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:50.260
Overall, if both the surgeon and patient do
their jobs properly, the breasts will look

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.610
entirely natural.

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:59.440
If not, capsular contracture will occur, which
is when the scar tissue causes a stiff, unnatural

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.440
look.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.780
A good boob job is like a good wig -- you
don't notice the good ones...

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.850
Though 1-2 percent of implants fail each year,
breast implants shouldn't harm the body any

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.360
more than any other implanted medical prosthesis.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.970
If they DO rupture the scar tissue surrounding
the implant could keep it intact for a while;

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:20.101
saline can be absorbed by the body, and the
FDA says silicone won't harm the body, cause

00:03:20.101 --> 00:03:21.950
cancer or damage tissues in any way.

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:27.160
Either way surgery would be involved to remove
the implant or replace it.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:34.170
FYI: NO, they don't pop on airplanes, and
can even be run over by a car to test their

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:35.170
durability.

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.580
People undergo breast augmentation for MANY
reasons: postmastectomy reconstruction, congenital

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:46.490
deformations, uneven breast development, post-breastfeeding
collapse, or simply by choice for their own

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:51.500
positive body image, self-esteem or confidence
or gender reassignment surgeries!

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:57.190
In fact, the second most common plastic surgery
in the world for MEN is Breast Reduction for

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.190
Gynecomastia.

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.480
Some men get breast augmentation too.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.170
Surgeons are trained to screen for body dysmorphic
disorders in their patients, and they know

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.560
any procedure is part of a conversation.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.260
Studies have correlated breast augmentation
electees to increases in suicide over 10 years,

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:31.639
as well as self-esteem issues, but the bottom
line is: it's your body, your choice.
