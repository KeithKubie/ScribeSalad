evidence and this is where I'm going to
 

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:12.020

belabor a certain point in this lecture

belabor a certain point in this lecture
 

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:13.220

because I've written a book on

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:13.230
because I've written a book on
 

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:14.990

period entitled conversion to Islam in
the medieval period and and I'm going to

the medieval period and and I'm going to
 

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:23.660
the medieval period and and I'm going to
lay out for you the thinking that went

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:23.670
lay out for you the thinking that went
 

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:25.430
lay out for you the thinking that went
behind that book because the argument of

00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:25.440
behind that book because the argument of
 

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:29.530
behind that book because the argument of
the book is that the spread of Islam is

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:29.540
the book is that the spread of Islam is
 

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:34.219
the book is that the spread of Islam is
representative of the spread of all

00:08:34.219 --> 00:08:34.229
representative of the spread of all
 

00:08:34.229 --> 00:08:37.820
representative of the spread of all
sorts of things that it is not specific

religion it is not even specific to
intellectual or spiritual trend but it

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:47.930
intellectual or spiritual trend but it
 

00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:53.769
intellectual or spiritual trend but it
is rather a sort of a special category

00:08:53.769 --> 00:08:53.779
is rather a sort of a special category
 

00:08:53.779 --> 00:08:57.269
is rather a sort of a special category
of the spread of all sorts of new things

00:08:57.269 --> 00:08:57.279
of the spread of all sorts of new things
 

00:08:57.279 --> 00:09:01.870
of the spread of all sorts of new things
and it really gets into the question of

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:01.880
and it really gets into the question of
 

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:04.780
and it really gets into the question of
how do things come to be known and how

00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:04.790
how do things come to be known and how
 

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:12.130
how do things come to be known and how
do they spread the general topic us key

I've brought up in an earlier lecture

00:09:19.199 --> 00:09:19.209
I've brought up in an earlier lecture
 

00:09:19.209 --> 00:09:24.360
I've brought up in an earlier lecture
talking about the the problematic

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:24.370
talking about the the problematic
 

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:28.810
talking about the the problematic
aspects of diffusionless thinking and

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:28.820
aspects of diffusionless thinking and
 

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:31.600
aspects of diffusionless thinking and
how do you you know because something

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:31.610
how do you you know because something
 

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:33.670
how do you you know because something
appears here and it previously it

appeared over here is it plausible to

appeared over here is it plausible to

a long way so the idea that somebody

a long way so the idea that somebody

trotted them off to Romania is not very
 

00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:11.110

plausible and yet you have people who

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:11.120
plausible and yet you have people who
 

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.490
plausible and yet you have people who
will say well pigs were first

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:12.500
will say well pigs were first
 

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:14.560
will say well pigs were first
domesticated in a certain place and the

domesticated in a certain place and the
 

00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:18.460
domesticated in a certain place and the
practice spread from there and so we say

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:18.470
practice spread from there and so we say
 

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:21.280
practice spread from there and so we say
ok that sort of diffusion theory is

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:21.290
ok that sort of diffusion theory is
 

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:25.180
ok that sort of diffusion theory is
somewhat weak because we have equally

somewhat weak because we have equally

plausible scenarios by which you would
 

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:32.380
plausible scenarios by which you would
have independent genesis of some new

let's say if you have a date of the life
of this person then you count the number

of this person then you count the number
 

00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:14.350
of this person then you count the number
of generations going back and you

know the death date of a father and the
 

00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:38.200
know the death date of a father and the
death date of a son and you can subtract

is a curve like that and this is known
 

00:25:58.430 --> 00:26:01.680
is a curve like that and this is known
to statisticians as a logistic curve

00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:26.650
everything in t1 to everything in t2 to
everything in t3 you wouldn't get it

00:26:26.650 --> 00:26:26.660
everything in t3 you wouldn't get it
 

00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:27.580
everything in t3 you wouldn't get it
tapering off because you're adding

tapering off because you're adding
 

00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:31.960
tapering off because you're adding
everything and so it it adds up to an

fact that this is related to a standard

00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:39.800
fact that this is related to a standard
 

00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:44.290
fact that this is related to a standard
distribution curve is suggestive it

00:26:44.290 --> 00:26:44.300
distribution curve is suggestive it
 

00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:47.380
distribution curve is suggestive it
suggests that there is probability

00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:47.390
suggests that there is probability
 

00:26:47.390 --> 00:26:50.200
suggests that there is probability
involved in other words the whole point

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:50.210
involved in other words the whole point
 

00:26:50.210 --> 00:26:52.860
involved in other words the whole point
of a standard distribution curve is that

00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:52.870
of a standard distribution curve is that
 

00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:57.100
of a standard distribution curve is that
things are at their greatest level of

00:26:57.100 --> 00:26:57.110
things are at their greatest level of
 

00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:59.770
things are at their greatest level of
probability at the peak of the curve and

00:26:59.770 --> 00:26:59.780
probability at the peak of the curve and
 

00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:03.760
probability at the peak of the curve and
as you move down either arm it becomes

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:03.770
as you move down either arm it becomes
 

00:27:03.770 --> 00:27:06.580
as you move down either arm it becomes
less and less probable and you measure

00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:06.590
less and less probable and you measure
 

00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:09.670
less and less probable and you measure
this probability by standard deviation

00:27:09.670 --> 00:27:09.680
this probability by standard deviation
 

00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:12.670
this probability by standard deviation
so this would be one standard deviation

00:27:12.670 --> 00:27:12.680
so this would be one standard deviation
 

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:15.400
so this would be one standard deviation
from the mean on one side one standard

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:15.410
from the mean on one side one standard
 

00:27:15.410 --> 00:27:17.290
from the mean on one side one standard

said that's a very interesting use of
 

00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:56.260
said that's a very interesting use of
the logistic curve and I said let me

00:27:56.270 --> 00:27:57.910

write down this word logistic and where

00:27:57.910 --> 00:27:57.920
write down this word logistic and where
 

00:27:57.920 --> 00:27:59.320
write down this word logistic and where
can I find out something about it cuz I

out that the logistic curve was not only

four hundred years as it does with Islam

01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:34.850
four hundred years as it does with Islam
 

01:13:34.850 --> 01:13:36.460
four hundred years as it does with Islam
later on it takes about six hundred

01:13:36.460 --> 01:13:36.470
later on it takes about six hundred
 

01:13:36.470 --> 01:13:40.240
later on it takes about six hundred
years then you can start to correlate

01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:40.250
years then you can start to correlate
 

01:13:40.250 --> 01:13:43.240
years then you can start to correlate
that you could say well when did you

01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:43.250
that you could say well when did you
 

01:13:43.250 --> 01:13:45.970
that you could say well when did you
have the last emperor who wanted to

01:13:45.970 --> 01:13:45.980
have the last emperor who wanted to
 

01:13:45.980 --> 01:13:49.720
have the last emperor who wanted to
revive paganism and so you have Julian

01:13:49.720 --> 01:13:49.730
revive paganism and so you have Julian
 

01:13:49.730 --> 01:13:52.560
revive paganism and so you have Julian
the apostate will come down around here

01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:52.570
the apostate will come down around here
 

01:13:52.570 --> 01:13:57.010
the apostate will come down around here
because after that challenges are not

01:13:57.010 --> 01:13:57.020
because after that challenges are not
 

01:13:57.020 --> 01:13:58.930
because after that challenges are not
against Christianity but they're rather

01:13:58.930 --> 01:13:58.940
against Christianity but they're rather
 

01:13:58.940 --> 01:14:02.590
against Christianity but they're rather
within Christianity the development of

01:14:02.590 --> 01:14:02.600
within Christianity the development of
 

01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:07.960
within Christianity the development of
legal concerns is paralleled at similar

01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:07.970
legal concerns is paralleled at similar
 

01:14:07.970 --> 01:14:12.240
legal concerns is paralleled at similar
points on the curve between Islam and

01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:12.250
points on the curve between Islam and
 

01:14:12.250 --> 01:14:14.350
points on the curve between Islam and
Christianity and there there are

01:14:14.350 --> 01:14:14.360
Christianity and there there are
 

01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:15.850
Christianity and there there are
numerous other things that you could

01:14:15.850 --> 01:14:15.860
numerous other things that you could
 

01:14:15.860 --> 01:14:18.970
numerous other things that you could
look at for correlation so this is a

01:14:18.970 --> 01:14:18.980
look at for correlation so this is a
 

01:14:18.980 --> 01:14:23.560
look at for correlation so this is a
theory that would argue that the growth

01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:23.570
theory that would argue that the growth
 

01:14:23.570 --> 01:14:25.930
theory that would argue that the growth
of Christianity despite the fact that it

01:14:25.930 --> 01:14:25.940
of Christianity despite the fact that it
 

01:14:25.940 --> 01:14:28.600
of Christianity despite the fact that it
becomes official in 300 that the growth

01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:28.610
becomes official in 300 that the growth
 

01:14:28.610 --> 01:14:33.520
becomes official in 300 that the growth
of Christianity is greatest between four

01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:33.530
of Christianity is greatest between four
 

01:14:33.530 --> 01:14:36.850
of Christianity is greatest between four
and five hundred rather than between

01:14:36.850 --> 01:14:36.860
and five hundred rather than between
 

01:14:36.860 --> 01:14:38.180
and five hundred rather than between
zero and

zero and
 

01:14:38.190 --> 01:14:41.120
zero and
300 and that therefore Christianity is a

valid I'll talk about that in a later

01:14:59.540 --> 01:14:59.550

now my guess is that this kind of

01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:05.850
now my guess is that this kind of
 

01:15:05.850 --> 01:15:07.700
now my guess is that this kind of
logistic expansion would work for China

01:15:07.700 --> 01:15:07.710
logistic expansion would work for China
 

01:15:07.710 --> 01:15:12.140
logistic expansion would work for China
as well and that you my guess is that

01:15:12.140 --> 01:15:12.150
as well and that you my guess is that
 

01:15:12.150 --> 01:15:13.900
as well and that you my guess is that
even though I have no numbers for China

01:15:13.900 --> 01:15:13.910
even though I have no numbers for China
 

01:15:13.910 --> 01:15:18.050
even though I have no numbers for China
that it probably took let us say before

01:15:18.050 --> 01:15:18.060
that it probably took let us say before
 

01:15:18.060 --> 01:15:20.360
that it probably took let us say before
but between four and six hundred years

01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:20.370
but between four and six hundred years
 

01:15:20.370 --> 01:15:21.860
but between four and six hundred years
something parallel to put together

01:15:21.860 --> 01:15:21.870
something parallel to put together
 

01:15:21.870 --> 01:15:24.760
something parallel to put together
Islamic Christianity for China to become

Islamic Christianity for China to become
 

01:15:24.770 --> 01:15:28.459
Islamic Christianity for China to become
predominantly Buddhist and that the

period of the greatest growth of
 

01:15:30.540 --> 01:15:34.640
period of the greatest growth of
Buddhism was almost certainly after the

Buddhism was almost certainly after the

question of you know is there something

question of you know is there something
 

01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:54.520
question of you know is there something
about the the end of the empire that

about the the end of the empire that

about the the end of the empire that
