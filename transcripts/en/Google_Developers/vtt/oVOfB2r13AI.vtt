[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:01.402 --> 00:00:03.360
LAURENCE MORONEY: There's
this great technology

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.076
available in Android
called Google Now,

00:00:05.076 --> 00:00:06.950
and I'd love to tell a
little story about it.

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.255
Last night I went to a
restaurant in Japantown,

00:00:09.255 --> 00:00:11.190
and I just swiped
onto my phone, and I

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.830
saw all these great things that
were going on all around me.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.160
There was this
museum I could visit.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.701
There was the menu
for the restaurant

00:00:16.701 --> 00:00:17.750
that I was actually in.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.160
There were reviews
of that restaurant,

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.620
and thankfully they were good
reviews because I discovered it

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:22.460
after I was in there.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.460
And there's all this great
stuff that Google Now

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:25.660
will actually give you.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.076
But today I'm going
to be speaking

00:00:27.076 --> 00:00:29.368
with our partner who, this
morning had a great keynote.

00:00:29.368 --> 00:00:30.867
And one of the
things that stood out

00:00:30.867 --> 00:00:33.200
was that, while my
smartphone was already smart,

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.570
you're working on things
to make it even smarter.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.490
Can you tell us a
little bit about that?

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.040
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: I
mean, don't get me wrong,

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.952
I love my smartphone.

00:00:39.952 --> 00:00:41.910
I think they're getting
smarter over the years.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.040
But I think the motivation was
to say, look, we really want

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.840
the technology to work for you.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.050
Can we make the phone do
more of the work for you

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.620
so then you can get
on with your life.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.520
If you think about it, that
sounds crazy and ambitious,

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.280
but we feel like
we've kind of taken

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.630
a few early steps towards that.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.364
LAURENCE MORONEY: Take
moon shots, right?

00:00:59.364 --> 00:01:01.530
And some of the things
you've been doing about that,

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.640
the way I understand you've
been thinking about it

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.880
is that you think really
in terms of context,

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.860
and the things that are around
you, and answers to the things

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.670
that you might want to know, and
then actions that you can take.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:12.660
Can you talk us
through that process?

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:13.650
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA:
You've been paying attention

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:14.720
to the keynote.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:15.660
that's good.

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.868
LAURENCE MORONEY: It was
hard not to, it was awesome!

00:01:17.868 --> 00:01:20.380
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: Now
look, if you think about it,

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.680
it sounds super cliched, super
obvious, but mobile changes

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.160
everything in terms of
how you find information.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.270
How you act on it.

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.870
And then when you
think about it-- OK

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:31.710
that's the department
of obvious-- but then

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.960
if you unpack it, actually there
are three things going on here.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.220
One is, of course, the
fact that your phone

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.510
is with you all the time.

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.100
Take my Disneyland
example from the morning.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.960
The fact that you're
there is enough of a cue

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.454
that you need certain things.

00:01:47.454 --> 00:01:49.120
You don't have to
actually spell it out.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.130
You don't have to go
to a box and spell out,

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.170
oh I need X, Y and
Z. So the phone

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.640
has a lot of this
implicit context.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.430
Context is the new black.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.010
There's a whole
bunch of information

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:00.474
that you should
be able to tee up.

00:02:00.474 --> 00:02:02.140
Your smartphone should
be able to tee up

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.000
without you having to sweat.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.906
So that's one key insight, and
that's when we started saying,

00:02:06.906 --> 00:02:09.114
well what are the kinds of
context where we can help?

00:02:09.114 --> 00:02:10.610
A place is certainly
one of them,

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.480
like your in Japantown example.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.180
But then, sometimes, the
context is in your head.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.587
So in my case, for
example, I love cricket,

00:02:17.587 --> 00:02:18.670
and I watch the World Cup.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.820
I was maniacally
focused on that.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.150
And so any information
around that

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.430
I don't have to spell it out.

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:25.850
Give it to me.

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.820
So that's another
context we think about.

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.290
And then, I think,
the other kind

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.890
of context we start to
think about is time.

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.240
So the fact that
around Thanksgiving you

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.926
need certain things,
or Halloween you're

00:02:37.926 --> 00:02:39.050
looking up pumpkin patches.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.660
So how do you really bring a lot
more information, without you

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.790
having to spell it out, is
our key motivation for this.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.207
And then of course it gets
to answers, and actions.

00:02:48.207 --> 00:02:50.040
LAURENCE MORONEY: And
the context of places,

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.857
it's not just that this
place is in this location.

00:02:52.857 --> 00:02:54.940
If it's a restaurant you've
got the opening hours,

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.545
you've got the menus,
you've got all that kind

00:02:56.545 --> 00:02:57.560
of stuff, which is--

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.050
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: Exactly.

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.080
LAURENCE MORONEY: --very useful.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.496
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: I mean,
nobody thinks about, oh, I'm

00:03:00.496 --> 00:03:01.601
in this lat long.

00:03:01.601 --> 00:03:03.600
You're actually saying,
oh this is a restaurant,

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.580
or this is a mall.

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.545
At the mall you
want the directory,

00:03:06.545 --> 00:03:09.119
at the airport you
want the terminal map.

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:10.660
In some sense it's
like you're trying

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.230
to get stuff done in a place.

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.150
You're not just there
for the sake of it.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.530
So how are you going to get--
help you get stuff done?

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:17.860
LAURENCE MORONEY: And it's funny
you mentioned the cricket World

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.276
Cup, because it's
a great example.

00:03:19.276 --> 00:03:21.080
I was in Australia
back in January.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.510
And I didn't know about
the cricket World Cup.

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.610
And I'm from Ireland and I
heard that Ireland were going

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:25.860
to be in the cricket World Cup.

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.290
So I googled for, like, Ireland
and the cricket World Cup.

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:29.680
And then Google Now
started giving me

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.013
all this information, like
when they were going to play,

00:03:32.013 --> 00:03:35.600
and the games that they won,
and the games that they lost.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.350
It was really enriching,
and it was really

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.032
delightful to actually have it.

00:03:39.032 --> 00:03:41.240
So some of the other things
that you spoke about now.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.615
Some of the future
that you we're

00:03:42.615 --> 00:03:43.870
talking about with Google Now.

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.860
This Google Now on
Tap, what's that

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.080
going to be bringing to us?

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.930
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: Not beer.

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.950
But the idea was
simple, which is saying,

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.830
look, like I was saying,
How can we bring you

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:56.097
answers and actions in context.

00:03:56.097 --> 00:03:57.930
But then, if you think
about it, the context

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.220
is not just places,
time, and interest,

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.450
but very often,
the context is what

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.210
you're doing in that moment.

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:08.450
You are making dinner plans, or
you're talking about a movie.

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.620
In that context, in
that specific moment,

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:11.370
what do you need.

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.210
So we're kind of saying, OK, how
do we take this assistance that

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:16.430
were starting to build
with now, but then put it

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.399
to use in that precise moment?

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:21.234
And that's kind of
idea behind Now on Tap.

00:04:21.234 --> 00:04:23.150
LAURENCE MORONEY: I liked
your Disney example,

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.520
instead of just telling me
what I can do in Disney,

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.220
its also got information
like, how long

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.250
the line is for this ride.

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.070
That's really,
really handy stuff.

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:32.820
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA:
And with Now on Tap,

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.236
the other thing
that's interesting

00:04:34.236 --> 00:04:36.460
is, we started out thinking,
oh, we should get you

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.450
quick answers, like, you and
I are talking about a movie,

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.180
give you the movie information.

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.720
But with user
studies, we actually

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:43.750
found another use case.

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.250
So one of the things
people said is,

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:46.759
oh, I have another
thing that I'm

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:48.300
super annoyed with
smartphones, which

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.604
is, I'm reading
something-- actually

00:04:50.604 --> 00:04:52.270
this just happened
to me-- I was reading

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.380
some article about
free-range parenting,

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:56.930
and then I have to come do this.

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:58.480
And so I have two choices now.

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.030
Either I lose track
of it forever,

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:02.710
or I just fuss
with my phone right

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.665
before I come here,
and take 15 steps,

00:05:04.665 --> 00:05:07.085
and add this to my
calendar, or whatever else.

00:05:07.085 --> 00:05:08.460
So one of the
things we're saying

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.730
is, in that moment can you
just put a single button push

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:14.590
and just say, hey, Google
Now, get this back to me

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:15.470
when I can read it.

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:17.580
When I have the
context of reading it.

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.060
LAURENCE MORONEY: Yeah, like
with the Hugh Laurie example,

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:21.750
You were looking into him
and you held it down--

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:22.740
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: Its
just a quick question.

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.530
I don't want to have to
go through 15 steps just

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:27.037
to get a quick
question answered.

00:05:27.037 --> 00:05:28.870
LAURENCE MORONEY: --And
it was really funny,

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.244
because when I was watching
your keynote, and I was like,

00:05:31.244 --> 00:05:32.910
I know Hugh Laurie
from somewhere.

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:33.820
And when you push
that, and then there

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.960
was a little icon of
an old British TV show,

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.230
called "Blackadder"
and he was in that

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:38.090
and I was like, ding! that's
where I know him from.

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:39.180
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA:
Exactly, sometimes you just

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:40.680
have to see it for
a couple seconds.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.430
Actually this happened to me, so
I always get confused between--

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.480
I still am confused-- between
Helen Hunt and Holly Hunter,

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:48.700
that always trips up--

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:49.430
LAURENCE MORONEY: Helen
Hunt, Holly Hunter,

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.780
yeah I can see that.

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.050
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: They're
like two Hollywood actresses,

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.570
and I was like, which one
is it now, on an article.

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:55.960
And I was like, OK
let me tap on Holly.

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.039
And they said, oh yeah,
it's the other one.

00:05:58.039 --> 00:05:59.705
LAURENCE MORONEY: So
this is great stuff

00:05:59.705 --> 00:06:00.663
for like, the end user.

00:06:00.663 --> 00:06:01.870
How about for developers?

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:02.660
What kind of
goodness do we have?

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.160
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: That's
the pretty cool thing here.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.670
I think for developers,
there's a couple things.

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:09.460
One, your app, you don't
have to change anything.

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:11.210
That's why we're
using the platform

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:13.940
API to make this work, which is
the reason we have to roll it

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:17.374
out in M, Android M. But
the other thing is, like,

00:06:17.374 --> 00:06:19.540
for "Tomorrowland," or for
restaurants, or whatever,

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:21.970
if you have an app that
can get something useful

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:23.910
done for that kind
of a use case,

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:26.470
you can start surfacing
here, which is pretty cool.

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:28.800
It's a new way, of
course now, today, you

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.110
can surface on Google Play,
Google Search as well,

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:34.330
this is a third way that
you can kind of reach users.

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:35.950
LAURENCE MORONEY: So if your
a domain expert in something

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:38.030
like, coffee shops that
have great latte art,

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:39.490
you can build the
app around that,

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:41.800
and then get surface to use
this through Now on Tap,

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.259
if you excuse the pun.

00:06:43.259 --> 00:06:44.050
That's pretty good.

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:45.508
And when can we
expect to see this?

00:06:45.508 --> 00:06:46.470
This is an Android M?

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:48.261
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA:
Yes, It will roll out

00:06:48.261 --> 00:06:50.620
with Android M in
a couple months.

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:53.274
We should see some updates to
the developer preview as well.

00:06:53.274 --> 00:06:55.190
LAURENCE MORONEY: Nice,
so lots of great stuff

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:58.500
to look forward in Android
M. Google Now on Tap

00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:59.464
is one of them.

00:06:59.464 --> 00:07:01.380
I'm really excited for
that, thank you so much

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:02.820
for this Aparna.

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:06.991
Folks, download the developer
preview for M today.

00:07:06.991 --> 00:07:08.740
You won't have the
Google Now on that yet,

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:10.220
but it's coming very, very soon.

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:12.010
So thanks, Aparna.
