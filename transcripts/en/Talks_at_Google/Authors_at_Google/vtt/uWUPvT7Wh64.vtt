00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:03.819
&gt;&gt;Good afternoon, everyone.
I'd like to welcome you to another outstanding

00:00:03.819 --> 00:00:08.340
Authors@Google talk.
We're very pleased to host today Larry Downes,

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.099
who is an expert of the
intersection of technology and law.

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:16.859
You may know him from his previous book which
is "Unleashing the Killer

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:23.210
App," which was distributed in a sort of open
source web posting-type

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.460
distribution back in 1998, very revolutionary
for its day.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.390
He's a partner at the Bell Mason Group and
he -- as I said, he's

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.239
authored numerous books on the intersection
of technology and law.

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:39.039
Larry also makes his way across the grad school
teaching circuit.

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:43.820
So he has appointments at the Chicago GSV,
the Haas School, as well as

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.590
the Northwestern School of Law.
And currently, he's down the road at Stanford

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.760
working with the Center
for Internet and Society.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.899
Today, he'll be speaking to us on a very core
topic: The Laws of

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.629
Disruption, Harnessing the Forces that Govern
the Business and Life in

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.489
the Digital Age.
As the Internet continues to revamp the ways

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:07.580
we do business in an
organized society, Larry offers us some guideposts

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.741
from the past in
terms of how to deal with these changes and

00:01:11.741 --> 00:01:15.490
disruptions.
And he also will give us anecdotes who would

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.090
he don't react to them
properly.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.430
Now you may think for a person like Larry,
there's a lot of weighty

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.790
issues on his mind all the time, things that
may keep him up at night.

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:31.280
But when asked in an interview from the Haas
Center over at Berkley, he

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:38.350
wondered what keeps Larry up at night.
In this case, it's his dog who is kept up

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.190
night by the raccoons, which
in turn sort of spreads throughout the house.

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.390
So that's the primary concern.
Not net neutrality or another weighty issue.

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.150
So please use the Q&amp;A mic to ask any questions
that you may have

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.950
towards the end of our talk for the benefit
of our YouTube and virtual

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.050
audiences.
With further ado, please help in welcoming

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.520
Larry Downes.
Thank you very much.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.590
LARRY DOWNES: Thank you very much.
It's a pleasure to be back at Google talking

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.860
about the new book.
I want to sort of just suggest how I got involved

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.490
with this idea in the
first place.

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:17.861
One of the things that I like to do to try
and keep current with

00:02:17.861 --> 00:02:18.861
technology, which of course, is pretty much
impossible these days.

00:02:18.861 --> 00:02:19.861
But I like to look at as many different sources
as I can for

00:02:19.861 --> 00:02:21.720
information.
So I read both from sort of business press

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.670
and mainstream press, as
well as technology press.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.880
And when I find something I like, I print
it out and put it aside in a

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.630
pile.
One of the things that I noticed over the

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.460
last couple of years was that
more and more of the stories that I was clipping

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.280
out were in fact
stories about the relationship between technological

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.870
development
particularly, obviously, information technology

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.810
and the law or legal
system, regulators, courts, the lawmakers

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.371
administrative law, and so
on.

00:02:47.371 --> 00:02:53.640
And most of those stories were bad news.
They were mostly stories about how things

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.900
weren't working, and how
these conflicts were becoming bigger and more

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.000
expensive between the
legal system and the technological applications

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.410
that were being
developed in very rapid order.

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.400
And as I started collecting more and more
of these stories, I thought,

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.410
well, there's something going on.
I'm not quite sure what it is.

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:20.780
But clearly something interesting.
And the one that sort of got me to be -- kind

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:28.770
of, the "aha" moment was,
now talking about the earlier privacy flap

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.660
at Facebook. They're have
been now two since the one I'm going to talk

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:32.660
about. Including
yesterday when Mark Zuckerberg announced that

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.920
privacy, he didn't think
was all that important.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.280
So proving that -- if there is a company that
has worse public

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.050
relations and government relations than you,
it's Facebook.

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:45.850
But the first one, you may remember, this
was back in early 2009,

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:51.520
February, I think, of 2009, when a sort of
weird kind of rebellion

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.500
emerged.
What happened was that Facebook made, what

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.900
actually turns out from a
legal standpoint modest and very minor change

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.790
to the terms of service,
dealing with the information licenses that

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.849
the company expected of the
users, particularly after they left the site.

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:14.040
And you know, this is typically happens in
large technology companies.

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.209
What I presumed happened was the lawyers,
you know, wrote the change.

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:25.150
The change, you know, went through the regular
process.

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.610
It seems unlikely it's the kind of change
that would normally have even

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.360
gone through an executive team review.
As I say, pretty modest legal stuff.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.300
And they posted the -- they posted a notice
saying, we made a change to

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.960
our terms of service.
Well, you know, it's Facebook.

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.200
There's 800 zillion people.
And so, as it turns out, somebody actually

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.730
read it.
And it turns out, I think, that the person

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:45.030
who read it probably wasn't
a lawyer, didn't understand exactly what it

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.280
read but the language was
disturbing to them.

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.660
And, of course, this is one of the problems
with terms of service

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.720
agreements is they're intentionally written
to be unreadable even by

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.000
lawyers.
They're often -- they're cut and paste jobs.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.980
And one of the exercises I often do with my
law students and my non-law

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.510
students is just pick at random terms of service
agreement and print it

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:11.660
out and actually read it.
And, you know, how many times there are typographical

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:15.050
errors, terms
that are sort of, you know, capitalized but

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.560
never defined anywhere.
They're really quite bad documents.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.771
And frankly, it doesn't matter because 99.XXX
percent of the time, if

00:05:23.771 --> 00:05:27.680
something goes wrong in the relationship between
the user of a service

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.140
and the service, the reference back to that
document doesn't happen.

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:35.650
I mean it gets resolved other ways.
In the interest of good customer service,

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:39.190
we're going to do X or Y or Z
regardless of what the terms of service say

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:42.710
we can or will do.
Generally speaking, we don't go back to that

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:46.040
document unless things go
really, really wrong.

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:51.250
So that's probably, you know, why nobody really
paid much attention to

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:54.830
this.
But as I say, somebody read it.

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:59.770
Misread it, I think.
But thought that it suggested that Facebook

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:03.810
was taking additional
rights without compensation for those rights.

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:06.370
And, of course, this being Facebook, the way
they responded was by

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:12.210
creating a Facebook page called Facebook Users
Against the New Terms of

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:14.820
Service.
And within a couple hours, there were a hundred

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:15.930
thousand members of
that page.

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:19.860
Now for Facebook, a hundred thousand members
isn't really very much,

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.760
frankly.
But it was enough to scare the hell out of

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.330
Facebook.
And particularly because, of course, the mainstream

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:27.850
media picked up on
it.

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:30.800
All these really embarrassing headlines, you
know, Facebook Falls on

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.490
Its Face, you know, that sort of stuff happened
pretty quickly.

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:37.670
And a number of really interesting things
happened immediately after

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:41.660
that.
First of all, Mark Zuckerberg announced that

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:46.150
they were going to
withdraw the change -- the changes were being

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:48.740
withdrawn -- the terms of
service, those disappeared immediately.

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:53.220
And more importantly, he made this announcement.
He said, look, in the future, we're going

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:55.540
to treat the terms of
services in a very different way.

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:58.030
So, first of all, we're going to write it
in plain language.

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:03.010
Of course, whatever natural language the audience
prefers, but for now

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:05.760
let's call it English.
We are going to write it in English, and in

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:09.720
the future any time we want
to make a significant change to the document,

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:13.090
we're going to institute
a process that will kind of try to introduce

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:17.639
some form of democracy or
at least deliberation among the user community

00:07:17.639 --> 00:07:20.620
before we actually
implement the change.

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:24.449
And one the things that happened in the later
change to the privacy

00:07:24.449 --> 00:07:28.160
policy which, of course, blew up in their
face a couple of months ago,

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:32.840
was that they actually circulated the proposed
changes according to

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:37.990
this new process.
But I think because it wasn't really well-advertised,

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:39.759
they weren't --
there was a trigger point.

00:07:39.759 --> 00:07:43.960
To get a vote on a change to the terms of
service -- you have to have

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:47.280
many users respond that they want a vote,
and it didn't meet that

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:49.820
threshold.
So it never went for a vote.

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:53.330
And then, of course, following their procedure
in October or November

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:56.639
or whatever it was that they introduced the
new privacy policy.

00:07:56.639 --> 00:08:01.740
Lo and behold, of course, the world blows
up a second time for them.

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:04.520
So -- but I thought that this was really an
important moment.

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:08.130
And one of the things I thought in particular
that Facebook recognized

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:12.240
was that in an online community -- and particularly
one as large as

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:18.919
they are -- there is a sort of sense that
this is, not a country, but

00:08:18.919 --> 00:08:23.180
some kind of a social organization.
Obviously, it's a social network.

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:26.490
It's some kind of social organization that
has laws.

00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:29.960
That has rules.
That has in some sense a government around

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:32.969
it.
And one of the things I think that was interesting

00:08:32.969 --> 00:08:36.879
was that they
realized that when you have the terms of service,

00:08:36.879 --> 00:08:39.419
for better or for
worse, becomes effectively the constitution

00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:44.810
of that community.
So that's the main sort of governing document

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:48.259
that determines the
rights and obligations.

00:08:48.259 --> 00:08:51.379
The responsibilities between the sovereign
 -- in this case Facebook --

00:08:51.379 --> 00:08:56.339
and the citizens -- in this case the 300-
400- 500 million users -- and

00:08:56.339 --> 00:09:01.430
that obviously as you move the technology
from, you know, buying and

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:05.240
selling cars or, you know, trading on futures
and commodities to

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:08.100
someplace where people are actually coming
to interact with each other

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:12.850
and to form relationships and become, you
know, in some ways digital

00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:13.999
citizens.
The idea that, in this case, you would have

00:09:13.999 --> 00:09:18.389
a document that simply
enforced and forced upon the community without

00:09:18.389 --> 00:09:19.600
any deliberation,
without any representation.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:27.809
So it's a sense of -- it was a form of tyranny.
And this sort of rebellion, a hundred thousand

00:09:27.809 --> 00:09:31.829
people rebellion, was
kind of the beginnings of a recognition that

00:09:31.829 --> 00:09:37.709
the governance of digital
life was going to have to take on a much less

00:09:37.709 --> 00:09:41.560
tyrannical and a much
more democratic look.

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:46.070
Because otherwise what happens when you have
people who are governed by

00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:48.810
a government that they didn't elect, that
they don't feel represented

00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:52.160
by, and they don't like?
Well, you have revolution.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:56.720
And revolution, I think, was the thing in
the back of their minds at

00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:00.269
Facebook that got them to react as quickly
as they did.

00:10:00.269 --> 00:10:04.660
Not so effectively, but certainly quickly.
And that's because what is the value of Facebook?

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:10.079
I mean, we go to their offices, you look,
you know, there's no gold

00:10:10.079 --> 00:10:11.309
bullion.
There's no factories.

00:10:11.309 --> 00:10:14.860
There is no manufacturing.
The entire balance sheet, the entire asset

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:17.911
of the company is
information, much like it is for you.

00:10:17.911 --> 00:10:22.129
And in their case, all the information they
have, at least all the

00:10:22.129 --> 00:10:25.509
valuable information they have, is provided
by the users.

00:10:25.509 --> 00:10:29.739
So if the users are unhappy, this is not like
a regular country.

00:10:29.739 --> 00:10:32.980
If they say, well, we don't like the government.
They're really not going to pick up and move

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:37.959
 -- well, I might go to
Canada, but it's not -- it's two hundred million

00:10:37.959 --> 00:10:39.239
people just can't pick
up and move somewhere.

00:10:39.239 --> 00:10:42.970
Well, of course, online, they can.
It's not easy.

00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:45.629
But it's much easier than it would be in the
real world.

00:10:45.629 --> 00:10:49.830
And they could move to MySpace or LinkedIn
or somewhere else, if they

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:54.430
didn't like the government that they were
getting from Facebook.

00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:56.399
And, of course, the minute they leave, the
company doesn't exist

00:10:56.399 --> 00:10:59.459
anymore.
There is literally nothing there without the

00:10:59.459 --> 00:11:02.300
users and without the
information that those users provide.

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:07.279
So this was the moment when I said okay.
I think now I get what all those stories I

00:11:07.279 --> 00:11:10.430
was clipping out, what they
all add up to.

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:15.810
And what they add up to is to me a sense that
we've now kind of

00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:19.350
progressed far enough in Internet life, these
are ten years that we've

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:22.800
been developing applications and services
in the Internet, that we've

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:25.709
moved into this world where instead of talking
about, you know,

00:11:25.709 --> 00:11:28.670
business to business or business to consumer,
and even consumer to

00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:31.750
consumer.
It's now really moving into a much more interesting

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:36.519
and intimate set of
interactions, social relationships, economic

00:11:36.519 --> 00:11:41.000
relationships, and so on.
That we now have to start thinking about a

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.059
second life or a digital
life that we lead and what the government

00:11:44.059 --> 00:11:47.459
of that digital life or what
the -- not only the constitution, but then

00:11:47.459 --> 00:11:52.550
all the laws that go with
that to set, you know, the specific terms

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:55.389
of interactions, what that's
going to look like

00:11:55.389 --> 00:11:58.999
And one of the things that clearly not to
look like is the sort of law

00:11:58.999 --> 00:12:03.290
that we have in the physical world.
Many of the stories I clipped suggest that

00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:06.839
the way in which we interact
in our digital lives is so different than

00:12:06.839 --> 00:12:11.319
the way we do things in
physical life that trying to apply the metaphors,

00:12:11.319 --> 00:12:15.049
trying to apply the
legal assumptions and trying to use the legal

00:12:15.049 --> 00:12:19.579
institutions, you know,
courts and legislatures -- very slow, very

00:12:19.579 --> 00:12:24.379
deliberate, very expensive,
very methodical -- that just sort of set of

00:12:24.379 --> 00:12:28.429
institutions is an
extremely poor fit for the kinds of problems

00:12:28.429 --> 00:12:34.550
and the quantity of
problems that we experience now as we develop

00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:39.580
this digital life.
And I know a little bit about digital life,

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:44.100
as Cliff mentioned, I've
been writing in this space in particular for

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:48.079
many years.
My first book, the Killer App book, this was

00:12:48.079 --> 00:12:50.929
kind of looking at how the
Internet was going to effect businesses.

00:12:50.929 --> 00:12:55.839
It didn't say much about consumers.
I certainly didn't say much about social systems.

00:12:55.839 --> 00:13:00.829
But because it was very early on.
It was 1997, when I was writing, predicting

00:13:00.829 --> 00:13:05.569
that, you know, even then
it wasn't really too far out there.

00:13:05.569 --> 00:13:08.980
Predictions certainly now it seems completely
cliché, but my prediction

00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:10.480
in 1997 was the Internet was going to significantly
change the way

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:11.480
people do business.
Okay.

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:12.480
Well, great.
That's was -- maybe interesting in 1997.

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:15.939
It's obviously not so interesting to talk
about today.

00:13:15.939 --> 00:13:23.269
But I thought one of the models that I'd come
up with there was going

00:13:23.269 --> 00:13:26.480
to be, I thought, useful in talking about
now ten years later.

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:30.780
How is law going to evolve both in the physical
world, but more

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:34.199
importantly in this new world?
What is the legal system?

00:13:34.199 --> 00:13:38.489
And how's it going to develop and indeed how
 -- what should we be doing

00:13:38.489 --> 00:13:41.429
to make sure that it develops in the best,
more efficient, most

00:13:41.429 --> 00:13:44.279
democratic most whatever your set of values
is for that.

00:13:44.279 --> 00:13:48.389
How can remake sure that that happens as quickly
and as efficiently as

00:13:48.389 --> 00:13:53.989
possible?
One of the models that I liked from the original

00:13:53.989 --> 00:13:54.989
book was this sort of
recognition.

00:13:54.989 --> 00:13:58.299
Looks very scientific, isn't the least bit
scientific, but the fact is

00:13:58.299 --> 00:14:02.939
that when you have a disruptive technology,
it's one where the pace at

00:14:02.939 --> 00:14:07.540
which it changes things is faster than the
ability of the underlying

00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:10.189
people or businesses or social systems to
respond to.

00:14:10.189 --> 00:14:13.970
In fact, that's sort of my definition of a
disruptive technology.

00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:19.559
It's one where its ability to change outstrips
the capacity for change

00:14:19.559 --> 00:14:24.339
of the people who are effected by it.
So you've got on the one hand, you know, sort

00:14:24.339 --> 00:14:27.170
of got to stick with
digital technology, you've got it changing

00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:31.209
 -- and we'll talk about why
in a second -- at this essentially geometric

00:14:31.209 --> 00:14:35.149
or exponential pace.
Those of us in the real world, if you can

00:14:35.149 --> 00:14:38.410
think about how you adapt to
change, it's not exponential.

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:40.351
Right?
We're much slower at it.

00:14:40.351 --> 00:14:44.980
And our institutions are much slower at it.
And I thought that the problem or the opportunity

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:48.509
in Killer App was
that somewhere in that gap, kind of the preferred

00:14:48.509 --> 00:14:51.889
rate of change and
the potential rate of change, companies could

00:14:51.889 --> 00:14:56.259
come in, introduce new
products or services and upset old supply

00:14:56.259 --> 00:14:59.920
chains.
Upset old sets of very stable industries could

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:03.309
be destabilized.
All of these things were possible just by

00:15:03.309 --> 00:15:06.009
moving a little bit more
quickly than everybody else.

00:15:06.009 --> 00:15:12.350
Well, obviously, that's what happened.
Again not, not a, you know, brilliant prediction

00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:14.939
on my part.
But at least I tried to put it into some terminology.

00:15:14.939 --> 00:15:20.160
The terminology I used was the Law of Disruption.
Where I said that in this case, when you have

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:24.689
disruptive or digital
technologies changing exponentially but you

00:15:24.689 --> 00:15:28.579
have social, legal, and
economic systems changing incrementally, you're

00:15:28.579 --> 00:15:31.410
going to have a kind of
set of problems.

00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:34.620
You're going to have a set of interactions
that are going to prove to

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:35.620
be disruptive.
You're going to have these accidents somewhere

00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:37.939
in the intersection
between the two.

00:15:37.939 --> 00:15:43.679
And so I pulled the law of disruption from
the old book and I said all

00:15:43.679 --> 00:15:47.799
right now it's ten years later.
Certainly the business systems have changed,

00:15:47.799 --> 00:15:49.489
how about the legal
system?

00:15:49.489 --> 00:15:53.689
What -- what's happening now?
Law is sort of -- historically, when you look

00:15:53.689 --> 00:15:56.249
at disruptive technology,
law is always the last of these systems to

00:15:56.249 --> 00:15:59.499
change.
It's always the place where people retreat

00:15:59.499 --> 00:16:02.629
to try and hold back change
as much as they could.

00:16:02.629 --> 00:16:05.999
But eventually law goes through this sort
of same kind of significant

00:16:05.999 --> 00:16:08.749
transformation that we've now observed over
the last ten years, I'd

00:16:08.749 --> 00:16:11.949
say, in business.
And, in fact, I think you clearly see over

00:16:11.949 --> 00:16:16.399
the next ten years kind of a
revolution in how we even think about our

00:16:16.399 --> 00:16:20.759
legal institutions and our
legal systems, similar to the way we've had

00:16:20.759 --> 00:16:25.410
over the previous ten years
in business and industry and the economy,

00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:29.519
in particular, the
information economy that we've developed.

00:16:29.519 --> 00:16:34.709
All right.
So this is a part where in a regular audience,

00:16:34.709 --> 00:16:38.759
I would spend the next
ten minutes talking about why digital technology

00:16:38.759 --> 00:16:42.629
is disruptive.
I think I can probably skip that for you guys.

00:16:42.629 --> 00:16:43.629
Moore's law, Metcalfe's law.
So I'll do it very, very quickly.

00:16:43.629 --> 00:16:45.109
Moore's law, Metcalfe's law.
Put them together, you have a disruption to

00:16:45.109 --> 00:16:48.019
the pace of change.
Obviously, if you sort of think digital technology

00:16:48.019 --> 00:16:51.730
changes along the
same path as Moore's law, put that together

00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:55.949
with Metcalfe's law, put
that together with the weird information economics

00:16:55.949 --> 00:16:58.069
or information not
as scarce, good.

00:16:58.069 --> 00:17:01.949
The more it's used, the more valuable it is.
It doesn't get used up. It has it's own economic

00:17:01.949 --> 00:17:04.709
 --
Put that altogether and you get a recipe for,

00:17:04.709 --> 00:17:08.510
now ten years of
disruption, but certainly many more decades

00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:12.430
to come.
I have this wonderful story I tell to make

00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:16.010
this concrete.
Again, I don't need to go over this with you.

00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:21.640
If you take the commercial sold computer,
that's the UNIVAC I.

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:26.660
If you gave that a unit measurement of one,
you said, a UNIVAC is one

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:29.160
computing power -- and even though Moore's
law didn't exist in 1955,

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:34.610
let's just pretend it did -- and we apply
it and we start running

00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:40.450
Moore's law to the year 2000.
And you said Sony Playstation 2, which debuted

00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:43.680
in 2000, would be --
very rough measurements here -- but roughly

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:47.340
equivalent in computing
power to 22 million UNIVAC I's.

00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:52.450
If you wanted to buy 22 million UNIVAC I's
in 1955, you would need an

00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:57.090
amount of money that -- that exceeds the GDP
of the United States in

00:17:57.090 --> 00:18:02.370
the year 2000, not adjusted for inflation.
Obviously, the Playstation 2 is much smaller

00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:06.570
and cheaper and faster
than 22 million UNIVAC's, and also interestingly

00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:11.530
enough, was not made
for -- the UNIVAC I, high, big applications,

00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:15.380
lots of number crunching.
The first one was sold, in fact, to General

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:17.230
Electric for payroll
systems and other accounting system.

00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:22.050
Obviously, the PS2 is made for something a
little bit different.

00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:25.530
But when you start, you know, continue to
double a number and you start

00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:28.670
with a small number.
The initial doublings aren't very interesting.

00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:33.790
Keep doubling the big number now, and every
next generation of change

00:18:33.790 --> 00:18:36.670
gets that much more disruptive because you're
doubling a bigger number.

00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:41.030
And so if you run this forward to the present
take the Playstation 2,

00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:45.170
say that's 22 million UNIVAC's, to store them,
you would need a space

00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:50.890
about equal to the city of Seattle, Washington.
Not stacking them, just laying them end to

00:18:50.890 --> 00:18:54.300
end.
If you move forward to 2005, that's only five

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:59.810
years now, not 50 years.
2005, the Playstation3 -- again, rough measurements

00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:02.060
 -- 660 million
UNIVAC's.

00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:08.190
You've gone from 22 to 660 in five years.
Cost pretty much stays the same.

00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:13.080
Size, you know, the front chip and the size
gets smaller and smaller.

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:18.880
And if you wanted to store 660 million UNIVAC
I's, you would need about

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:22.280
the entire state of Washington just to put
them somewhere in the box

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:27.150
that the Playstation3 goes.
And the amount of money you would need to

00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:31.690
buy 660 million UNIVAC I's in
1955 would be more than the entire money supply

00:19:31.690 --> 00:19:34.480
of the world today.
So literally, it wouldn't have been possible

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:37.140
to do it.
So I just ran through that in.

00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:41.260
Usually I take about 15 minutes with that.
All right.

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:46.990
So we understand that it's disruptive.
And I think it's clear that the legal, the

00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:50.250
sort of legal institutions
and legal systems, are now feeling the pressure

00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:53.790
of change that
everything else, all our other systems have

00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:57.010
been feeling much more
directly in the sort of first ten years.

00:19:57.010 --> 00:20:00.681
And one of the questions that I was asked
when I started thinking about

00:20:00.681 --> 00:20:04.620
this book and started proposing it to the
publishers was, okay, great.

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:07.350
We love this.
Now your book is going to tell us, right,

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:08.410
what the new legal system is
going to look like?

00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:11.170
And who are going to be the winners and losers
five years from now?

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:14.770
You're going to be able to lay all that out
for us?

00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:17.000
And I said no.
I can't do that.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.730
That's sort of like asking me, you know, the
Wright Brothers just took

00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:23.360
off at Kitty Hawk and you want to know, you
know, will United or

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:27.830
Southwest get better gate placement at Oakland
terminal two in 2000 --

00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:35.170
I just -- you know, it's just not possible.
But I think it is important to try and find

00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:38.800
ways to predict.
And to me, the most valuable tool for trying

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:42.640
to see how something is
going to happen is to find historical analogies,

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:44.740
historical metaphors.
Obviously, they're not perfect by definition.

00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:50.210
But I think they could be very useful.
I like this quote very much from Fredric Jameson,

00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:51.730
who's a literary
critic.

00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:54.410
And he says, you know, really, if you think
about it, science fiction

00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:57.310
is a kind of nostalgia for the present.
That the way people generally write about

00:20:57.310 --> 00:21:02.770
the future really isn't about
the future, it's about the present, set in

00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:06.170
sort of some other place or
time in order to talk about things that you

00:21:06.170 --> 00:21:07.890
couldn't really talk about
directly.

00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:11.980
So thinking about the future is not very useful
in trying to predict

00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:16.640
the future.
The past, I think, is a much better guide.

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:18.530
And this quote I also love from -- from Ronald
Coase.

00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:23.400
Any of my students will know my affection
for Professor Coase Nobel

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:28.210
Prize winning economist, who said, if you
torture the data enough,

00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:31.370
nature will always confess.
And so again, trying to make predictions based

00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:34.610
on trends and future
trends --

00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:37.300
You can make the predictions.
But your tendency even unconsciously to skew

00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:41.240
the data or to interpret
the data in a way that gets you the results

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:47.160
you wanted to get is such
that it's not a very useful way of doing prediction.

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:51.110
All right.
So how better to do it?

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:57.160
I like to say look to historical examples.
And for me, the most useful way of predicting

00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:01.760
what's going to happen in
this age of disruption is look at the previous

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:03.190
large scale age of
disruption.

00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:08.010
And for me that would be the Industrial Revolution.
We have some very similar characteristics.

00:22:08.010 --> 00:22:11.150
I mean you think about the information revolution
being powered by

00:22:11.150 --> 00:22:14.350
semiconductor.
On their own computers, don't do anything.

00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:16.080
They're kind of a machine that makes other
machines.

00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:20.880
Very similarly, in the Industrial Revolution,
you had a key technology,

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:23.650
the steam engine, on its own it didn't do
anything.

00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:28.560
But it became the basis for manufacturing
technology, transportation

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:33.250
technology, communications technology.
It was sort of the -- the chip of its day.

00:22:33.250 --> 00:22:36.890
And in particular, I think it's useful to
look at the Industrial

00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:40.360
Revolution with the standpoint of how railroads
developed.

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:43.840
So that was one of the key technologies, or
key applications I should

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:48.581
say, of the steam engine.
What can we learn from how that affected legal

00:22:48.581 --> 00:22:52.620
systems in particular
that might suggest how the semiconductor is

00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:56.490
going to design a new legal
system for us in our digital lives.

00:22:56.490 --> 00:23:00.520
And I love this -- is the map of the U.S.
railroad system in the year

00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:05.590
1900.
You will observe something about it pretty

00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:09.350
obviously from the very
beginning, which is there's all kinds of congestion.

00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:12.380
And you can think of this as competition in
a business sense.

00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:15.111
There's all kinds of competition particularly
in the Northeast and the

00:23:15.111 --> 00:23:20.350
Midwest.
And all pretty much until you get to the Mississippi

00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:23.500
River, if you're
try to go shift from Point A to Point B you

00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:25.140
have many, many choices.
All right?

00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:29.620
You have lots and lots of competition.
But west of the Mississippi to the Pacific,

00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:31.520
you have many different
routes.

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:35.310
But each of those routes takes a slightly
different path through what's

00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:38.930
known as the Intermountain region, the region
between the Mississippi

00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:42.510
and the West Coast.
And this translated to a very, very significant

00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:45.420
social problem in the
year 1900.

00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:50.150
And that was that because the railroads in
the congested part had to

00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:53.820
compete so viciously with each other, essentially
there was more

00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:58.860
capacity than anybody could possibly use in
the dark part of this

00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:02.860
chart, that they were losing money.
They were losing huge amounts of money on

00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:05.040
the transport up to the
Mississippi.

00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:07.930
And the only way they could stay profitable
was to make it up in the

00:24:07.930 --> 00:24:11.730
Intermountain region.
And the way they did this was by charging,

00:24:11.730 --> 00:24:16.130
you know, excessive rates of
carriage to everybody that was stuck with

00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:19.250
only one line.
So if you're living in Spokane, Washington,

00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:23.640
you have exactly one way of
getting your timber to the Pacific or even

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:26.910
back to the Midwest.
And that's the Great Northern Railroad.

00:24:26.910 --> 00:24:30.680
So the Great Northern Railroad said, Spokane,
you're going to pay,

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:32.260
you're basically going to subsidize our loses
everywhere else.

00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:35.780
And this is what all the transcontinental
railroads did.

00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:41.010
And this in turn led to a tremendous amount
of social unrest. So the

00:24:41.010 --> 00:24:44.300
Progressive Movement, the Granger Movement,
the Socialist Movements --

00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:50.820
many of these Industrial Age, sort of, developments
in terms of calls

00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:56.370
for radical or some less radical changes to
the way law worked, and the

00:24:56.370 --> 00:25:00.960
way governments were run more or less came
out of this particular

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:05.990
feature of the railroad system.
You know, squeeze people long enough, they're

00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:08.970
going to revolt.
They revolted in a lot of different ways.

00:25:08.970 --> 00:25:13.560
Some of them civil, some of them not-so-civil.
Some of them nonviolent, some of them violent.

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:19.010
And the Granger Movement in particular was
trying to force Congress to

00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:23.410
pass laws that would make railroads behave
more like governments.

00:25:23.410 --> 00:25:27.590
They said, look, the railroad is effectively
a sovereign, we have no

00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:30.720
choice but you to deal with them.
They govern our behavior so significantly

00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:35.090
that they ought to be held to
the same kinds of standards as a democratic

00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:39.260
government.
You know, sounds like the Facebook story,

00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:42.000
right?
Exactly the same thing.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.930
They were successful in the United States.
Just as an aside, they weren't -- didn't work

00:25:45.930 --> 00:25:48.430
so well in other parts of
the world.

00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:52.040
Like the Russian Revolution, in some ways
as the violent equivalent of

00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:55.270
the Granger Movement or the Progressive Movement,
where the workers

00:25:55.270 --> 00:25:59.240
simply took over the means of production and
formed their own

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:01.530
government.
And by the way, the difference between how

00:26:01.530 --> 00:26:05.440
the West and how Russia
resolved this Industrial Age problem, in some

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:09.560
ways, that determined the
course of history for the next hundred years.

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:14.110
But why in the United States in particular
did it take a nonviolent

00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:17.800
form?
Well, the answer is largely Teddy Roosevelt.

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:21.070
And a group of his advisors -- they were,
essentially, they were

00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:25.160
conservative, if you wanted to put a political
label on them.

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:27.780
They were not radicals.
They were not militant.

00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:31.750
But they recognized that there was enough
pressure on the economic

00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:35.370
system because of the way the railroads were
behaving, that if there

00:26:35.370 --> 00:26:39.440
wasn't some valve to release that, there would
in fact be the kind of

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:42.370
violent revolution that ultimately took place
in other parts of the

00:26:42.370 --> 00:26:45.740
world and particularly in Russia.
So Roosevelt essentially became a progressive.

00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:52.370
We became the great trust buster.
Not because he was antibusiness, but because

00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:56.500
he was concerned that the
alternative would be the complete collapse

00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:58.691
of, sort of, the government
and the economic system of capitalism that

00:26:58.691 --> 00:27:05.250
was causing that this
stress.

00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:11.100
And in particular one of the -- the principle
advisors to Roosevelt on

00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:13.780
economic matters was a very strange man named
Brook Adams.

00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:17.390
Brooks Adams, the grandson of John Adams,
the great-grandson of --

00:27:17.390 --> 00:27:20.450
sorry.
The grandson of John Quincy Adams and great

00:27:20.450 --> 00:27:25.640
grandson John Adams.
So from this, you know, family of people who

00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:28.530
understood revolutions
against tyrants pretty well, by his generation,

00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:32.250
of course, the tyrant
here was now the railroads.

00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:37.990
And Adams developed a theory which he used
in fact as a lawyer.

00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:42.430
He argued on behalf of the City of Spokane
in the case that was

00:27:42.430 --> 00:27:45.400
eventually decided by the Supreme Court which
did determine that the

00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:50.330
railroads were unfairly discriminating economically
against the

00:27:50.330 --> 00:27:53.320
Intermountain region.
Of course, that was a new legal principle

00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:55.860
that there could be such a
thing as economic discrimination.

00:27:55.860 --> 00:28:02.170
And Adams was sort of one of the people who
spearheaded that theory.

00:28:02.170 --> 00:28:06.200
And his quote from his brief into the Interstate
Commerce Commission, I

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:11.980
thought, really summarized my sense of how
this relationship between

00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:15.750
disruptive technology and legal systems is
going to play out now, a

00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:18.820
hundred years later.
So he says, you can read it for yourself.

00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:21.070
He says, "No ancient abstract principle of
right and wrong which can be

00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:23.600
safely deduced as a guide to regulate the
relations of railways and

00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:27.410
monopolies among our people, because railways
and monopolies are

00:28:27.410 --> 00:28:30.890
products of forces unknown in former times.
The character of

00:28:30.890 --> 00:28:34.920
competition has changed and law must change
to meet it or collapse."

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:38.309
And that's essentially Roosevelt's view in
a nutshell.

00:28:38.309 --> 00:28:42.440
If the law doesn't change to meet these new
forces, these new

00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:44.940
disruptive technologies, the law will simply
fall apart.

00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:49.910
We will get a new legal system, but we won't
get it in a very nice way.

00:28:49.910 --> 00:28:53.559
And sure enough, I think that's, you know,
that's sort of forms the

00:28:53.559 --> 00:28:59.190
basis of the theoretical part of the book
is this recognition that we

00:28:59.190 --> 00:29:03.170
have these new forces.
The law is ill-equipped to deal with them.

00:29:03.170 --> 00:29:07.570
The law is either going to change or collapse.
And obviously the goal of the book is to try

00:29:07.570 --> 00:29:11.520
and suggest ways going
forward in some of the most contentious areas

00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:14.420
to today to make sure
that it does change and it doesn't collapse

00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:17.920
or at least that the
collapse is as orderly as possible going forward.

00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:22.360
So this is just a short list.
Some of the kinds of issues that I cover in

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:24.940
the book.
But obviously these are some of the things

00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:29.230
that are kind of at the
forefront of these conflicts now between the

00:29:29.230 --> 00:29:33.720
body of law that we live
under today, and the reality that technology

00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:36.080
has created in the last
ten years to which those simply don't fit.

00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:37.890
And I tried to sort of draw just to close
out the Industrial Age

00:29:37.890 --> 00:29:42.559
analogy, I said, look if we're really talking
about what happened in

00:29:42.559 --> 00:29:48.570
the Industrial Revolution driven by a steam
engine.

00:29:48.570 --> 00:29:54.550
Essentially, there was a new law created.
And I mean this case I mentioned is a big

00:29:54.550 --> 00:29:56.290
piece of it.
There was lots of other things but if you

00:29:56.290 --> 00:30:00.790
sort of took the whole
progressive era and what came out of it and

00:30:00.790 --> 00:30:04.850
put it altogether, what
you'd say is essentially the law changed dramatically

00:30:04.850 --> 00:30:07.200
over a 10,
20-year period.

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:11.900
And really we went from essentially what was
still kind of based in

00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:14.620
feudal society and feudal law.
Particularly in Europe and in some sense the

00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:18.270
United States, where law
was really organized around property ownership,

00:30:18.270 --> 00:30:21.980
real estate property
ownership, and the relationship between the

00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:24.220
owners of property and
people who lived on the property.

00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:29.480
So the tenants, the servants, the serfs, the
farm community and so on.

00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:32.431
Really what happened after the Industrial
Age was the legal system

00:30:32.431 --> 00:30:36.010
moved from kind of a feudal model based on
property, to a property

00:30:36.010 --> 00:30:41.520
model based on actual exchange of property.
So it became much more based on, you know,

00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:44.060
the market system and
capitalism and entrepreneurship.

00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:47.980
And the whole idea of manufactured goods and
so on.

00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:52.080
That created a new legal system.
The property system really replaced feudalism.

00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:56.290
And now in our current era, we're going to
do through a similar change

00:30:56.290 --> 00:30:59.290
property-based system, again, the idea that,
you know, exchange of

00:30:59.290 --> 00:31:03.350
goods and services in an open market and the
legal systems that support

00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:06.270
that, we're really moving much more toward
 -- I don't really have a

00:31:06.270 --> 00:31:09.360
good name for it yet.
I used to on this slide earlier, I called

00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:12.760
it a sort of the
collaboration model of law, but then people

00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:15.010
thought I was a socialist.
So I took that off.

00:31:15.010 --> 00:31:19.080
Now I call it the network version of law where
somehow, we need to

00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:23.150
observe new legal system that's founded in
the idea that information is

00:31:23.150 --> 00:31:28.250
a very different kind of commodity than oil
and steel and farm

00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:30.210
commodities.
Again, because, you know, I use that barrel

00:31:30.210 --> 00:31:32.220
of oil, that means you
don't use it.

00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:35.970
When I'm done with it, it's gone.
All those kinds of things really are at the

00:31:35.970 --> 00:31:39.220
heart of the sort of
property system of law.

00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:45.480
Information doesn't follow any of those rules.
And therefore, the kinds of legal system we

00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:48.940
need to support an
Information Economy is going to be very different.

00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:52.950
What's it's going to look like, well, I tried
to organize the book

00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:57.610
around what I thought of as the three biggest
areas of change.

00:31:57.610 --> 00:32:01.500
So obviously, private law has to do with our
interaction as consumers

00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:05.880
or citizens, certainly as individuals and
things like privacy.

00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:10.600
Things like civil rights, human rights, government
surveillance and so

00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:14.440
on.
Things that happen at the intersection between

00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:16.640
the physical world and
the digital world.

00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:20.450
That's sort of the first section of the book.
The middle section of the book, I talk more

00:32:20.450 --> 00:32:27.870
about, about a public life
in particular, the sort of regulation of business.

00:32:27.870 --> 00:32:29.020
The regulation of competition, antitrust is
one.

00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:32.460
The actual infrastructure itself.
So everything having to do with regulation

00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:37.350
of the Internet or all the
companies that provide access and infrastructure

00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:42.290
and the backbone.
And then, of course, crime -- both personal

00:32:42.290 --> 00:32:46.460
and business crime.
Identity theft and spam and things of that

00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:50.200
nature.
Again, what's a more appropriate kind of legal

00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:53.980
structure to respond to
that, than the one we have which obviously

00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:57.760
doesn't work.
Actually, I live in the very small -- brief

00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:00.429
aside.
I live in a very small piece of unincorporated

00:33:00.429 --> 00:33:03.429
Contra Costa county,
just north of Berkley.

00:33:03.429 --> 00:33:12.020
A little town called Kensington, 500 residents.
And you get the little monthly newspaper and

00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:14.220
it gives you sort of the
whole police blotter.

00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:18.420
We have a little police force.
A couple of part-time officers.

00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:21.280
And every -- you know, most of it is somebody
left their car unlocked

00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:24.740
and CDs were taken out or somebody left their
garage unlocked lost some

00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:26.430
tools.
Every now and then there's a reference in

00:33:26.430 --> 00:33:31.140
the blotter to police took a
call from resident of such and such street

00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:35.140
that they had been the
victim of identity theft.

00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:36.140
Now you actually have to do that because your
insurance company

00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:39.350
requires you to file a police report if you're
going to make a claim.

00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:43.510
But imagine again the 2 officers, part-time
officers, in Kensington,

00:33:43.510 --> 00:33:46.170
California, yes, I've been a victim of identity
theft.

00:33:46.170 --> 00:33:50.390
Yeah, we're going to get right on it.
What on earth could they possibly do?

00:33:50.390 --> 00:33:55.429
Just the mismatch between the skill sets,
the tools, the jurisdiction,

00:33:55.429 --> 00:34:00.559
everything about a local police force in a
town of 500, and sort of a

00:34:00.559 --> 00:34:05.160
global enterprise.
This just -- you know, great.

00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:06.280
Duly noted.
All right.

00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:11.029
So the third area, which obviously is amongst
the most contentious is

00:34:11.029 --> 00:34:14.739
what I call information life.
This is really at the heart of it.

00:34:14.739 --> 00:34:17.549
This is the court understands legal system
that's evolving to deal with

00:34:17.549 --> 00:34:21.069
this new economy which is based on information,
which, again, follows a

00:34:21.069 --> 00:34:25.220
lot of economic rules that are very different
than what we're used to

00:34:25.220 --> 00:34:29.089
from scarce goods like oil and corn and so
on.

00:34:29.089 --> 00:34:32.301
So obviously, everything having to do with
copyright, and patent, and

00:34:32.301 --> 00:34:35.690
particularly with the law of software or information
products

00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:39.119
themselves.
This is, you know, sort of central to the

00:34:39.119 --> 00:34:43.119
message of the book.
We know, I mean, you know this far better

00:34:43.119 --> 00:34:46.510
than I do that these are
areas of great contention.

00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:50.829
And of course the sort of escalation of problems
that happens kind of

00:34:50.829 --> 00:34:54.359
matches again the Moore's law curve, the faster
things change, the

00:34:54.359 --> 00:34:57.129
more -- you know, if you're thinking next
year it's going to quiet

00:34:57.129 --> 00:35:01.940
down, you are not looking at the chart correctly.
One thing you will know for certain is that

00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:04.079
there will be more
conflicts next year and there will be more

00:35:04.079 --> 00:35:05.910
conflicts the year after
that.

00:35:05.910 --> 00:35:09.789
Ultimately, you know, we will evolve some
new way of regulating

00:35:09.789 --> 00:35:14.480
information that will make better sense.
I'm not criticizing the copyright system.

00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:20.460
It was fine for what it was invented to do.
It just doesn't work in a digital, non-media

00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:22.619
based information exchange
market.

00:35:22.619 --> 00:35:27.130
It wasn't designed to do it so it's not like
anybody should be blamed

00:35:27.130 --> 00:35:29.349
or yelled at.
But it doesn't work.

00:35:29.349 --> 00:35:33.119
And we know it doesn't work.
And one thing everybody agrees on, you get

00:35:33.119 --> 00:35:35.690
a bunch of patent lawyers in
a room together and the one thing they'll

00:35:35.690 --> 00:35:39.509
all agree on is that patent
system is completely broken.

00:35:39.509 --> 00:35:42.510
And in fact, you pretty quickly get them to
agree, at least half of

00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:45.890
them to agree, on what the solution would
be that is the ones for

00:35:45.890 --> 00:35:49.200
information technology have a pretty good
idea of the fix and

00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:51.960
unfortunately, the ones from the pharmaceutical
companies have a

00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:53.789
completely different idea of what the fix
is.

00:35:53.789 --> 00:35:57.269
And frankly the reason that there has been
no significant patent reform

00:35:57.269 --> 00:36:00.210
in Europe or the United States over the last
ten years is because

00:36:00.210 --> 00:36:03.880
essentially you've two competing bills every
year that come up that say

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:07.520
no, we're going to do the pharmie fix -- we're
going to do the IT fix,

00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:11.200
and they wind up doing nothing.
So everybody knows it's broken.

00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:15.249
And it's not you know, not meeting any of
the goals or expectations

00:36:15.249 --> 00:36:19.670
that we have for it.
But the chances -- I just was at CES in Las

00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:22.980
Vegas last week at a policy
conference.

00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:28.890
And Congressman Issa from Southern California
said the chances for

00:36:28.890 --> 00:36:32.799
patent reform next year are not only zero,
but for the next three years

00:36:32.799 --> 00:36:36.980
are completely zero.
And by the way, the result of is that when

00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:40.200
things break, it's if the
law doesn't fix them, where do you go?

00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:42.630
Who fixes it if the legislature doesn't fix
it?

00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:46.059
What's the sort of the backstop?
Yeah, the courts.

00:36:46.059 --> 00:36:49.230
So if something goes wrong, and the law isn't
fixed, you sue.

00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:53.220
And you go to court and what we have in the
patent system as well as in

00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:57.109
a lot of these other systems is we have the
worst, institutionally, the

00:36:57.109 --> 00:37:01.880
worst group of all, you know, sort of judges
 -- not that they're bad

00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:05.680
people.
But they're the ones who are least able to

00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:09.609
as a fact finding.
When they have to make a decision, it's supposed

00:37:09.609 --> 00:37:13.859
to be based just on
that particular set of facts and circumstances.

00:37:13.859 --> 00:37:17.749
But of course, it winds up having broader
implications.

00:37:17.749 --> 00:37:20.710
And so by default, we get lawmaking by the
courts or by judicial

00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:23.030
decisions.
Nobody thinks that's a good idea.

00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:27.710
And we think about poor Judge Green, running
the communications network

00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:32.579
of the United States from his chambers after
the AT&amp;T divestiture case

00:37:32.579 --> 00:37:38.999
in the 70s, until Congress -- well, 80s, sorry.
Until Congress passed the 1996 communications

00:37:38.999 --> 00:37:43.349
act, poor Judge Green was
running the communications business of the

00:37:43.349 --> 00:37:46.369
entire United States out of
his judicial chambers.

00:37:46.369 --> 00:37:49.359
And it was just -- believe me, it was not
a job that he wanted or

00:37:49.359 --> 00:37:52.559
enjoyed.
But because he was responsible for enforcing

00:37:52.559 --> 00:37:56.480
the antitrust decree and
because Congress didn't pass any legislation

00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:59.309
until 1996, he ran it for
ten years.

00:37:59.309 --> 00:38:03.050
And we know that those were not good ten years
for communications.

00:38:03.050 --> 00:38:06.970
Where we had separate companies that were
only allowed to do data and

00:38:06.970 --> 00:38:09.079
other companies that were only allowed to
do voice.

00:38:09.079 --> 00:38:13.779
And all of that became so artificial, as the
Moore's law did its thing

00:38:13.779 --> 00:38:17.430
that, you know, the system just became unworkable.
Well finally anyway.

00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:19.579
There was some movement.
At least it's out of the courts.

00:38:19.579 --> 00:38:23.859
Now it's back in the Congress.
So I thought what I would do, I want to leave

00:38:23.859 --> 00:38:26.290
some time for questions
but I thought I would just say a little bit

00:38:26.290 --> 00:38:31.489
in particular, just to give
one example from the book of how I think this

00:38:31.489 --> 00:38:35.759
breakdown occurs, and
then a way going forward is to look at intellectual

00:38:35.759 --> 00:38:39.599
property broadly.
Obviously, that's probably the area here that's

00:38:39.599 --> 00:38:43.180
of most interest to
Google.

00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:47.430
And again, to look at historically how disruptive
technologies have

00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:51.880
created these kinds of legal crises.
And then sort of what eventually gets evolved,

00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:57.220
and what eventually is
created to try to come up with a legal system

00:38:57.220 --> 00:39:02.140
that much better fits the
physics of the -- what technology has created.

00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:06.480
What technology has wrought.
So you go back, obviously, to most the important

00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:10.829
technological
development in information, certainly before

00:39:10.829 --> 00:39:15.589
the computer was the
printing press, moveable type and so on.

00:39:15.589 --> 00:39:17.660
Guttenberg, 1450.
And one of the things that you realize right

00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:21.829
away was there's an agenda
here that's much more important than just

00:39:21.829 --> 00:39:25.890
the business agenda right?
So why did Guttenberg invent moveable type?

00:39:25.890 --> 00:39:28.150
What was his actual goal?
Was he selling books?

00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:31.549
He wanted to make money as a bookseller?
Well, in part.

00:39:31.549 --> 00:39:35.980
But here's a quote from Guttenberg about the
importance of the printing

00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:38.599
press.
And one of the things you realize is that

00:39:38.599 --> 00:39:42.710
he had a much broader social
goal, in this case, a religious goal.

00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:48.400
Guttenberg was a Lutheran.
And one of the tenets of Lutheranism, of the

00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:50.349
whole Protestant
Revolution was that the Church -- sort of,

00:39:50.349 --> 00:39:53.829
think about it, the Catholic
Church in the Middle Ages was kind of like

00:39:53.829 --> 00:39:57.590
Microsoft Windows.
It was in a closed environment.

00:39:57.590 --> 00:40:00.559
There were little bits of API, but that was
about it.

00:40:00.559 --> 00:40:03.979
You really couldn't, you know, it was in Latin,
you couldn't get

00:40:03.979 --> 00:40:07.640
educated in Latin.
The priests really controlled information

00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:10.859
and how it was used.
And essentially, their competitive strategy

00:40:10.859 --> 00:40:15.499
was to limit access to
information as a way of keeping their customers

00:40:15.499 --> 00:40:20.269
coming back for more.
Luther turned that upside down and said, no,

00:40:20.269 --> 00:40:21.510
you know, give the
information away.

00:40:21.510 --> 00:40:25.900
So he was the open source guy.
He said give the information away and find

00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:29.739
technologies that will do
that, and you will wind up with creating more

00:40:29.739 --> 00:40:32.390
value for yourself than
by keeping it closed.

00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:36.210
It really the kind of same fight that we have
today.

00:40:36.210 --> 00:40:39.570
In this case, and I frankly think historically
in all cases, the open

00:40:39.570 --> 00:40:43.290
model ultimately wins.
In this case, there were 300 years of war

00:40:43.290 --> 00:40:45.510
to sort of resolve the
problem.

00:40:45.510 --> 00:40:49.400
But ultimately the open model wins largely
because the technology makes

00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:53.060
that inevitable.
So there's Guttenberg in 1455.

00:40:53.060 --> 00:41:00.960
And as the sort of printing press -- as we
had this sort of revolution,

00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:02.099
one of the things we realized again, in a
closed society, we didn't

00:41:02.099 --> 00:41:06.519
have to have rules about copies manuscripts
because that copying was so

00:41:06.519 --> 00:41:10.130
closely controlled by the owner of the manuscript
it was just

00:41:10.130 --> 00:41:12.309
irrelevant.
But as the printing press evolved, and as

00:41:12.309 --> 00:41:17.049
we continued to get more from
liturgical books to secular books, it became

00:41:17.049 --> 00:41:20.930
clear that there needed to
be rules about who could do what and the sort

00:41:20.930 --> 00:41:23.099
of economics of this were
very important.

00:41:23.099 --> 00:41:26.529
So exactly 300 years -- this is the 300th
anniversary of the very first

00:41:26.529 --> 00:41:32.019
copyright statute.
The British statute of Anne.

00:41:32.019 --> 00:41:34.130
And a copyright said you know it's still really
the basis for copyright

00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:37.109
law today, this idea that we're going to encourage
authorship.

00:41:37.109 --> 00:41:41.239
We're going to encourage the creation of information
by using this very

00:41:41.239 --> 00:41:46.359
clever hack, which is to say, we're going
to temporarily give a

00:41:46.359 --> 00:41:50.309
monopoly power to the person who originates
new information.

00:41:50.309 --> 00:41:53.970
And there's lots of limits on what you can
 -- you know, not all

00:41:53.970 --> 00:41:58.990
information gets this monopoly power.
If I write down my directions to my house,

00:41:58.990 --> 00:42:01.049
that's -- that doesn't get
controlled by copyright.

00:42:01.049 --> 00:42:04.450
But if I create some interesting information,
some useful information

00:42:04.450 --> 00:42:08.509
with some sort of significant addition to
human life, I'll get a

00:42:08.509 --> 00:42:12.680
monopoly power to control its distribution,
the Catholic model, but

00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:16.210
only for a certainly period of time.
After which, the whole thing reverses, it

00:42:16.210 --> 00:42:19.089
goes into the public domain.
Anybody can do whatever they want with it,

00:42:19.089 --> 00:42:23.530
the Protestant model.
The idea here was that this would give incentives

00:42:23.530 --> 00:42:27.190
for more information
creation, and at the same time make sure that

00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:31.049
we were feeding the
ultimate goal of as much information flow

00:42:31.049 --> 00:42:34.509
as possible.
Statute of Anne set its own set of rules.

00:42:34.509 --> 00:42:39.119
Well obviously, what's happened over the years
is that the technology

00:42:39.119 --> 00:42:43.130
for both creating and distributing information
has changed.

00:42:43.130 --> 00:42:46.359
And in response, the laws had to change, you
know, to make sure to keep

00:42:46.359 --> 00:42:49.339
that balance or at least the goal is to keep
that balance.

00:42:49.339 --> 00:42:53.160
The law keeps changing in response.
The problem, of course, has been that over

00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:56.400
the last hundred years the
pace at which these new developments come

00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:59.181
in that upset the balance
just gets faster and faster.

00:42:59.181 --> 00:43:02.070
And the law still takes a long time, so it
falls further and further

00:43:02.070 --> 00:43:06.130
behind.
So you start to look at a number of major

00:43:06.130 --> 00:43:10.769
radical disruptive
technologies, each of which so upset the balance

00:43:10.769 --> 00:43:13.989
that a major reform
was ultimately needed.

00:43:13.989 --> 00:43:19.880
[INAUDIBLE]
Obviously, in terms of music and entertainment

00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:24.579
now in 2001, and what
you want to think of, you know, that's pretty

00:43:24.579 --> 00:43:26.279
clear -- oops.
I missed a chart.

00:43:26.279 --> 00:43:28.769
Oh, I see.
I must have left it off.

00:43:28.769 --> 00:43:33.799
So one of the things you find that's pretty
clear is that the system

00:43:33.799 --> 00:43:38.539
is -- the pace of change has outstripped the
pace of reform to the

00:43:38.539 --> 00:43:42.849
system and now it doesn't work at all.
What we've got, of course, now is a system

00:43:42.849 --> 00:43:47.119
where instead of recognizing
that information is cheaper to create and

00:43:47.119 --> 00:43:49.390
cheaper to distribute, we've
done the exact opposite.

00:43:49.390 --> 00:43:53.720
The length of copyright and the kinds of enforcement
in a civil and now

00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:57.751
criminal penalties for copyright infringement
have become more

00:43:57.751 --> 00:44:01.859
stringent, even as the cost of creation, distribution
has gone down.

00:44:01.859 --> 00:44:03.819
Of course, the cost of privacy has also gone
down.

00:44:03.819 --> 00:44:07.339
But that is the only thing so far that the
law responds to.

00:44:07.339 --> 00:44:12.979
It doesn't respond to these other features.
And the analogy I use to talk about copyrights

00:44:12.979 --> 00:44:17.079
is essentially, it's as
if every time cars got faster, we lowered

00:44:17.079 --> 00:44:19.670
the speed limit on the
freeway in response.

00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:22.359
You know, because we want to make sure there
are fewer accidents, so

00:44:22.359 --> 00:44:26.269
that's certainly one goal.
The problem is as we've done that, the cars

00:44:26.269 --> 00:44:28.960
get faster and the speed
limit goes down and basically we now have

00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:32.739
a freeway where the speed
limit is one mile an hour.

00:44:32.739 --> 00:44:36.520
What happens when you have a law that's completely
unrealistic to

00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:40.319
reality is nobody obeys it.
So effectively, we have a copyright system

00:44:40.319 --> 00:44:44.390
and, you know, for all
intents and purposes, it has no basis -- no

00:44:44.390 --> 00:44:46.359
value in terms of how
people behave.

00:44:46.359 --> 00:44:48.569
It doesn't effect their decision to do one
thing or another thing.

00:44:48.569 --> 00:44:53.329
You know, you can pick off individuals every
now and then through

00:44:53.329 --> 00:44:56.109
litigation.
The bottom line is that the system is now

00:44:56.109 --> 00:44:57.700
without a governing body of
law.

00:44:57.700 --> 00:45:01.460
It's kind of, you know, the market is setting
certain rules and certain

00:45:01.460 --> 00:45:06.569
terms.
And again, every now and then there's a piece

00:45:06.569 --> 00:45:08.249
of litigation for --
obviously, the Google/Viacom case still pending

00:45:08.249 --> 00:45:14.859
is an attempt to try
and enforce the one mile an hour speed limit

00:45:14.859 --> 00:45:15.859
on a 55-mile an hour
vehicle.

00:45:15.859 --> 00:45:20.150
Ultimately, those things may have some influence.
But really what's determining the law of copyright

00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:22.849
today -- or the use
of information has nothing to do with the

00:45:22.849 --> 00:45:28.239
copyright law it has
everything to do with the market forces.

00:45:28.239 --> 00:45:32.280
And just to, sort of, close it up, in, you
know, in my copyright

00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:36.849
chapter I sort of said, well, here's three
what I think of as modest

00:45:36.849 --> 00:45:39.380
reforms.
Again, kind of in the Brooks Adams model of

00:45:39.380 --> 00:45:42.579
things what we actually
do -- by the way, there's absolutely no chance

00:45:42.579 --> 00:45:47.450
any of these things
would happen in Congress today, anyway.

00:45:47.450 --> 00:45:50.420
But not because nobody thinks there're a good
idea just because the

00:45:50.420 --> 00:45:55.349
political will wouldn't be there.
But in fact, if we wanted to actually turn

00:45:55.349 --> 00:45:58.299
the copyright system into
something that worked in the digital economy,

00:45:58.299 --> 00:46:01.779
I think, you know, sort
of three things that would have a great deal

00:46:01.779 --> 00:46:05.979
of help.
There one would be dial back on the extension

00:46:05.979 --> 00:46:09.489
of copyright, to put it
back to a reasonable term, reasonable enforcement,

00:46:09.489 --> 00:46:10.800
reasonable
penalties.

00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:15.369
People will maybe obey a law that they think
makes a certain amount of

00:46:15.369 --> 00:46:18.839
sense.
Restoring the concept of fair use, of uses

00:46:18.839 --> 00:46:21.990
that don't have to be
licensed.

00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:25.180
Licensing can be very expensive and time-consuming
process or as

00:46:25.180 --> 00:46:26.309
economists say, they have lots of transaction
costs.

00:46:26.309 --> 00:46:30.421
And we've judiciously eliminated fair use
in a series of decisions in

00:46:30.421 --> 00:46:34.749
this country over the last ten years.
Many of the things that people sue about today,

00:46:34.749 --> 00:46:37.479
they wouldn't have to
sue about or they wouldn't sue about because

00:46:37.479 --> 00:46:42.130
effectively they should be
covered by this general free license of fair

00:46:42.130 --> 00:46:45.019
use.
If we put that back in the law, we would avoid

00:46:45.019 --> 00:46:46.809
a lot of the conflict
right away.

00:46:46.809 --> 00:46:50.380
And then thirdly, many of the features of
the DMCA, the Digital

00:46:50.380 --> 00:46:54.210
Millennium Copyright Act, passed in 2000,
particularly ones that make

00:46:54.210 --> 00:46:59.450
it, you know, illegal to reverse-engineer
DRM and some of the more

00:46:59.450 --> 00:47:03.130
draconian features of DMCA.
Take those out those.

00:47:03.130 --> 00:47:07.510
Three things I think would -- would kind of
be the Granger version of

00:47:07.510 --> 00:47:11.329
copy reform as opposed to what we've got now
which is the Russian

00:47:11.329 --> 00:47:16.470
Revolution of copyright reform.
And as I say, there's no -- there's no Theodore

00:47:16.470 --> 00:47:19.460
Roosevelt on the
horizon, that I know of, that's going to make

00:47:19.460 --> 00:47:22.960
that happen.
But, you know, if the conflict gets increasingly

00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:28.040
hostile, maybe
somebody will come up to do that.

00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:30.269
All right.
So I'm going to stop.

00:47:30.269 --> 00:47:31.619
Yeah, I'll leave it here.
This is just sort of the cheat sheet if you

00:47:31.619 --> 00:47:35.210
 -- for questions, this is
kind of a bunch of current issues.

00:47:35.210 --> 00:47:38.559
And the thumbs up is, you know, thumbs down
kind of my view -- my

00:47:38.559 --> 00:47:41.769
viewpoint on them.
My viewpoint in this case always coming from

00:47:41.769 --> 00:47:44.901
kind of the general theory
I just laid out for you.

00:47:44.901 --> 00:47:51.729
What makes sense and what doesn't make sense.
Kind of generates, I think, the thumbs up

00:47:51.729 --> 00:47:57.079
and the thumbs down.
But I'll stop there we can just sort of talk

00:47:57.079 --> 00:48:06.849
about whatever you want.
Take any questions on any subject this or

00:48:06.849 --> 00:48:08.049
otherwise that you'd like.
So I'm going to stop there and see if there's

00:48:08.049 --> 00:48:09.049
any questions.

00:48:09.049 --> 00:48:10.049
[PAUSE]
Okay, former students are required to ask

00:48:10.049 --> 00:48:11.049
a question.

00:48:11.049 --> 00:48:12.049
[PAUSE]

00:48:12.049 --> 00:48:17.630
&gt;&gt; I remember -- I remember when you came
out with your first book you

00:48:17.630 --> 00:48:28.349
put it all online.
A lot has happened between 1999, back then

00:48:28.349 --> 00:48:31.700
and now.
Are you doing that now with your new book?

00:48:31.700 --> 00:48:32.700
And what are you're thoughts on that?

00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:34.260
LARRY DOWNES: So the short answer is no.
I didn't put -- and one of the reasons I was

00:48:34.260 --> 00:48:36.869
able to put the Killer App
book -- this was 1998, actually, when it came

00:48:36.869 --> 00:48:40.320
out.
We had a website where we literally put the

00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:42.880
entire book online for
free.

00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:47.069
We used a tool that made it so you could only
read a section at a time

00:48:47.069 --> 00:48:49.640
or a chapter at a time.
So it wasn't really -- if you wanted to read

00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:52.809
the whole book online but
it wasn't really to print it out and make

00:48:52.809 --> 00:48:56.089
 -- and of course the only way
we were able to get away with that was that

00:48:56.089 --> 00:48:58.799
our publisher didn't
understand that that was possible.

00:48:58.799 --> 00:49:02.499
And frankly, didn't know that we had done
it until too late.

00:49:02.499 --> 00:49:06.180
The cat was out of the bag.
Well now publishers are much more sophisticated

00:49:06.180 --> 00:49:09.390
about that.
So I was not able to do that with this book.

00:49:09.390 --> 00:49:14.069
But what I have done, and actually I'm learning
a lot from the process

00:49:14.069 --> 00:49:17.309
is, that -- that since, you know, about a
month or two before the book

00:49:17.309 --> 00:49:20.829
came out, I've started blogging.
And I put myself on a pretty aggressive schedule

00:49:20.829 --> 00:49:24.299
of at least two
significant posts a week.

00:49:24.299 --> 00:49:26.839
And my posts -- they turned out -- they turn
out more to be like

00:49:26.839 --> 00:49:30.599
article s.
They're 1000, 1500 words each, which breaks

00:49:30.599 --> 00:49:33.979
all the rules of blogging.
They're very long posts.

00:49:33.979 --> 00:49:37.630
But I'm trying to sort of keep up with things
that have happened since

00:49:37.630 --> 00:49:41.219
I stopped writing the manuscript.
And effectively, if you read my blog, I've

00:49:41.219 --> 00:49:46.759
now written more words on
the blog than the manuscript, the text of

00:49:46.759 --> 00:49:50.009
the book.
So I've actually written the next book.

00:49:50.009 --> 00:49:51.329
It's not organized -- it's just sort of just
by topics.

00:49:51.329 --> 00:49:55.819
But in terms of word count, I've now put up
again online for free more

00:49:55.819 --> 00:49:58.469
content than is actually in the book itself.
That's the closest I could come.

00:49:58.469 --> 00:49:59.469
[PAUSE]

00:49:59.469 --> 00:50:04.190
&gt;&gt; All right.
I had a question as well.

00:50:04.190 --> 00:50:09.519
I really enjoyed the parallels you made with
the road railroad company

00:50:09.519 --> 00:50:12.150
and Theodore Roosevelt.
In today's society with all the collaboration

00:50:12.150 --> 00:50:15.809
that's going on the
Internet and how things are really crowd-sourced,

00:50:15.809 --> 00:50:18.729
do you think it is
going to take another Theodore Roosevelt or

00:50:18.729 --> 00:50:22.420
is it going to take a
Theodore Roosevelt network of like-minded

00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:23.900
believers to change things?

00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:27.380
LARRY DOWNES: Well, so, as I said, it depends
upon what route

00:50:27.380 --> 00:50:31.480
ultimately we go.
If we go the progressive route or we go the

00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:35.569
revolutionary route.
As I say, right now it's a revolution.

00:50:35.569 --> 00:50:39.900
So far, it's a nonviolent revolution.
But it's nonetheless, you know, you can sort

00:50:39.900 --> 00:50:45.190
of -- it's not too far to
think of people, you know, there are many

00:50:45.190 --> 00:50:48.609
public advocacy groups in
Washington.

00:50:48.609 --> 00:50:52.950
And sort of their -- you know, they use pretty
violent rhetoric at

00:50:52.950 --> 00:50:56.140
least when they start talking about some of
these issues.

00:50:56.140 --> 00:50:58.920
And it's not sort of far to think you know
people going to the

00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:04.619
barricades for copyright reform.
It seems kind of foolish to think of that

00:51:04.619 --> 00:51:07.969
now, but I suggest in five
years, if we haven't made any changes to the

00:51:07.969 --> 00:51:11.460
law that won't sound quite
so ridiculous.

00:51:11.460 --> 00:51:14.859
So if we are going to going the correct way,
the progressive way, yeah,

00:51:14.859 --> 00:51:18.049
of course, the, you know -- how do we develop
a new law?

00:51:18.049 --> 00:51:20.279
Well we obviously are going to use the tools
available.

00:51:20.279 --> 00:51:23.730
So we're going to develop it on Wikipedia
and Facebook and Google.

00:51:23.730 --> 00:51:28.280
We will use -- just as the Facebook little
rebellion used Facebook

00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:33.130
to -- we will use the exact same collaborative
model for developing

00:51:33.130 --> 00:51:36.469
what seemed like a better set of rules.
And therefore a better set of code, better

00:51:36.469 --> 00:51:40.779
set of principles for
governing our digital life that seems -- that

00:51:40.779 --> 00:51:41.779
seems quite
straightforward.

00:51:41.779 --> 00:51:46.049
The tools are there.
Now the question is, you know, are the ideas

00:51:46.049 --> 00:51:50.839
there and is the ability
to implement and enforce them and kind of

00:51:50.839 --> 00:51:54.670
keep traditional governments
out of the way in the process.

00:51:54.670 --> 00:51:56.660
Is that there?
That's the $64,000 questions.

00:51:56.660 --> 00:52:01.029
&gt;&gt; So the first thing I noticed on this chart
was the thumbs down for

00:52:01.029 --> 00:52:10.270
network neutrality.
And many others may have noticed that as well.

00:52:10.270 --> 00:52:11.940
But could you elaborate a bit on that?

00:52:11.940 --> 00:52:14.069
LARRY DOWNES: Sure.
So I have about a half a chapter in the book

00:52:14.069 --> 00:52:17.420
where I talk about
infrastructure in particular but net neutrality.

00:52:17.420 --> 00:52:21.099
I should say I'm not opposed to net neutrality,
at least the principles

00:52:21.099 --> 00:52:24.980
of net neutrality.
My concern and it should be fairly obvious

00:52:24.980 --> 00:52:28.880
now why that would be, is
particularly with the idea that it would be

00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:32.883
both implemented and
enforced by the Federal Communications Commission.

00:52:32.883 --> 00:52:37.030
The idea again here that a terrestrial sort
of earth-bound governing

00:52:37.030 --> 00:52:41.380
body, in this case one is an extremely poor
track record for dealing

00:52:41.380 --> 00:52:45.029
with information.
You think about, you know, this day or at

00:52:45.029 --> 00:52:49.390
the FCC, because their
jurisdiction allows them to deal with content

00:52:49.390 --> 00:52:51.460
on the broadcast network,
only.

00:52:51.460 --> 00:52:56.589
They can't really enforce their views on the
cable network and on

00:52:56.589 --> 00:52:57.960
satellite.
But on broadcast they can.

00:52:57.960 --> 00:53:02.160
So you have literally the FCC trolling around,
looking for errant

00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:07.599
nipples and swear words.
And it's kind of sort of really nanny behavior

00:53:07.599 --> 00:53:10.619
that not only hasn't
been toned down, it's actually, you know,

00:53:10.619 --> 00:53:15.239
the number of enforcements
and the number of the size of the penalties

00:53:15.239 --> 00:53:18.150
has actually gone up.
You know, this is an agency where it's wearing

00:53:18.150 --> 00:53:22.559
it's content manager hat
that has not given us reason to believe that

00:53:22.559 --> 00:53:26.619
they get what 21st century
life is really about.

00:53:26.619 --> 00:53:31.309
So my concern is about it as a principally,
the FCC, sort of any

00:53:31.309 --> 00:53:35.849
traditional physical government, but particularly
the FCC is an awful

00:53:35.849 --> 00:53:40.950
place not only to divine the rules but then
my concern is particularly

00:53:40.950 --> 00:53:43.960
around enforcement.
If somebody says, okay so let's say the rules

00:53:43.960 --> 00:53:48.910
get passed, and under one
version of them any person in the world, any

00:53:48.910 --> 00:53:52.589
citizen of the United
States can file a complaint with the FCC if

00:53:52.589 --> 00:53:54.779
they think the rules are
being violated.

00:53:54.779 --> 00:53:58.479
The FCC must investigate within 180 days.
And let's say that's what goes into effect,

00:53:58.479 --> 00:54:03.719
so you can sort of imagine
the situation is, I'm at home, my cable seems

00:54:03.719 --> 00:54:05.619
really slow.
The Internet's really slow today.

00:54:05.619 --> 00:54:10.369
I bet, you know, that Comcast is messing with
the traffic.

00:54:10.369 --> 00:54:12.190
And I'm going to file a complaint with the
FCC and they're required to

00:54:12.190 --> 00:54:16.720
investigate it.
You know, and how are they going to investigate

00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:19.920
it?
Well, there's very little -- so they've been

00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:24.720
 -- there's sort of a lot
written about it that's from the lawyers standpoint.

00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:25.720
Sorry.
There's very little that's been written about

00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:29.309
it from the engineering
standpoint.

00:54:29.309 --> 00:54:34.019
What's the engineering behind how the FCC
would investigate and enforce

00:54:34.019 --> 00:54:37.019
the rules assuming that they're the ones charged
with that authority?

00:54:37.019 --> 00:54:42.479
Well, they're going to have -- it seems to
me that at least one likely

00:54:42.479 --> 00:54:45.950
way, and therefore the way that the FCC would
most prefer is that

00:54:45.950 --> 00:54:48.950
they're going to have to have access to the
traffic.

00:54:48.950 --> 00:54:51.150
Not necessarily, you know, looking at all
the packets, but they're

00:54:51.150 --> 00:54:53.680
going to have to say all right we're going
to do a compliance check or

00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:57.049
we're going to do and audit.
And we're going to look at what packets were

00:54:57.049 --> 00:54:59.940
moving at the time this
complaint takes place.

00:54:59.940 --> 00:55:03.989
And we're going to look to see if we see any
indication of non-neutral

00:55:03.989 --> 00:55:06.940
behavior.
Was it just the traffic was slow because the

00:55:06.940 --> 00:55:10.070
traffic was slow or was
the traffic was slow because the application

00:55:10.070 --> 00:55:11.339
I was using was Bit
Torrent or some other, you know, depreferred

00:55:11.339 --> 00:55:14.369
application.
Well, the only way they're really going to

00:55:14.369 --> 00:55:18.739
be able to determine that is
to look at least some of the traffic, put

00:55:18.739 --> 00:55:23.019
it back together, and the
minute the FCC is doing deep packet inspection

00:55:23.019 --> 00:55:26.289
is the minute that I
would expect the Civil Libertarians to get

00:55:26.289 --> 00:55:29.900
the most upset.
Because of course, they're looking at it for

00:55:29.900 --> 00:55:33.809
one purpose which is to
see if the wrong kind of stuff is being favored

00:55:33.809 --> 00:55:36.250
or disfavored.
But you know, this is the Federal Government.

00:55:36.250 --> 00:55:39.319
Now I'm not as paranoid as many of these groups
are, but you'd think

00:55:39.319 --> 00:55:41.999
that the more paranoid ones would be saying
that the minute that the

00:55:41.999 --> 00:55:44.959
FCC starts doing deep packet inspection what
they're going look for

00:55:44.959 --> 00:55:47.490
other interesting things they find and of
course the War on Terror,

00:55:47.490 --> 00:55:51.410
most of it done secretly.
They will turn over lots and lots of what

00:55:51.410 --> 00:55:56.599
they find as they look
inside -- you know, this is a worst case scenario.

00:55:56.599 --> 00:56:01.039
I don't necessarily think that makes it an
unlikely scenario and I

00:56:01.039 --> 00:56:04.660
worry about that tremendously.
So those sort of law of intended consequences

00:56:04.660 --> 00:56:09.630
with the rules and the
problems of enforcement are why I'm strongly

00:56:09.630 --> 00:56:15.039
opposed to the FCC having
the authority to make sure net neutrality

00:56:15.039 --> 00:56:17.729
 --
Net neutrality is fine.

00:56:17.729 --> 00:56:22.450
The FCC in charge of not so fine.
Yeah?

00:56:22.450 --> 00:56:23.450
We're done right.
Time's up.

00:56:23.450 --> 00:56:24.450
&gt;&gt; Well, I think we're about all set but I
wanted to thank you again

00:56:24.450 --> 00:56:26.349
for coming to speak with us today.
Outstanding presentation.

00:56:26.349 --> 00:56:27.349
Thank you.

00:56:27.349 --> 00:56:28.059
LARRY DOWNES: Thank you.
My pleasure.
