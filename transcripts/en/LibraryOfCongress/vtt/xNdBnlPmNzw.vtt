00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.730
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
COngress in Washington, DC.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.700
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: Hello,
I'm Juan Felipe Herrera,

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.010
US Poet Laureate and I am here
at the Library of Congress

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.140
for Casa de Colores and
in the Hispanic Division

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.350
with curator Juan Manuel Perez.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:34.090
And he has brought out two famous
books, which are really one book.

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:35.390
&gt;&gt; Juan Manuel Perez:
One book exactly.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.930
I wanted to read you this to
sort of illustrate the richness

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.560
of the collections of
the Library of Congress.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.250
These are two different
editions of El Quixote.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.580
El Quixote was published in 1605
by Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.560
It is considered the
first modern novel.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.780
It has gone through
many, many editions.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.880
There are only, in reality, only
the Bible has had more editions

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.230
than El Quixote.

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:08.740
&gt;&gt; Herrera: That's
a lot of editions.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.650
&gt;&gt; Perez: Yes, it is the only one.

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.950
And we have editions
in Japanese, Chinese,

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.840
Russian, you name it, we have it.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:24.690 position:56%
So to illustrate this, I have two
different editions of the same book.

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.090
He came out with a book
in 1605, which we have.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.430
But then, someone in
Portugal pirated his work

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:38.430
and this is the pirated edition
of the same year, 1605 that came

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.690
out in Lisbon in Portugal.

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.580
And then, after he
knew what happened,

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.560
after Cervantes knew what happened,
he came out with another edition

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.250
in Madrid that same
year, which we also have.

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.310
But this time, also with privilege
with Portugal, for Portugal,

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.960
so that no one could
pirate his work again.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.850
So we have three 1605 editions.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.150
&gt;&gt; Herrera: That's great.

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:11.070
&gt;&gt; Perez: And as I said,
we have editions in many,

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:12.660
many different languages.

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.470
We will have, as I say,
Chinese, Japanese, Russian, etc.,

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.800
in Galician in my own
native language.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.970
That came out in the 1990s.

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.630
Only about 100 copies were made.

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:33.550
And the most recent edition of
Don Quixote, which is a treasure,

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.980
is this one from 2012 in Quechua
as it was published in Peru.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.280 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Herrera: This is the most recent?

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.240
&gt;&gt; Perez: This is the most
recent edition of Don Quixote.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.540
&gt;&gt; Herrera: I can't believe it.

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.750
&gt;&gt; Perez: And it happens
to be in Quechua.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.300
&gt;&gt; Herrera: That's a good thing.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.220
&gt;&gt; Perez: So we have very,
very unique editions.

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:58.370
For example, the Galatian edition
came in a reproduction trunk

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.150
from the 16th Century,
uh, from the 17th century.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.710
It is illustrated by the top
Galatian artists of the moment.

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.920
And also it has the peculiarity

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.940
that those same illustrations
come also life size.

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.250
The painters painted
them life size also...

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.550
&gt;&gt; Herrera: That's incredible.

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:22.920
&gt;&gt; Perez: ...which
accompany the book.

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.490
But, obviously we could not bring
everything here to show you,

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:36.480
but this is just an
example of what we have.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.020
This is all, this is all in...

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:40.320
&gt;&gt; Herrera: It's all in Quechua.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:45.170
&gt;&gt; Perez: This is all in Quechua
and it is beautifully, beautifully,

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:52.760
illustrated with Quechua paintings.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.560
&gt;&gt; Herrera: That's with
their interpretation of it.

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.910
&gt;&gt; Perez: Exactly...the
interpretation of the contents

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.460
of different chapters in the book.

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:02.760
It's just beautiful.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.060
&gt;&gt; Herrera: It is.

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.360
&gt;&gt; Perez: And it's one of
the most recent treasures

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.660
that we have of Don Quixote.

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:07.960
&gt;&gt; Herrera: I didn't know that.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.260
I thought this was
just another edition,

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.560
but it's the most recent edition.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.890
&gt;&gt; Perez: This is the most
recent edition we have.

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.520
&gt;&gt; Herrera: Oh this is amazing!

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.660
I love this and it gets out what
Central America, the Quechua...

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.300
&gt;&gt; Perez: Quechua, well
Quechua is in Peru.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.960
It was published in Peru.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.800
&gt;&gt; Herrera: That's right.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.100
&gt;&gt; Perez: But it's beautiful.

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.610 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Herrera: And this one is pirated.

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.900
&gt;&gt; Perez: This one, this
one, the Portuguese,

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.000
this one from 1605 is
pirated in Portugal.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.590
&gt;&gt; Herrera: So, then they just
got a copy of the original and...

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:40.950
&gt;&gt; Perez: We have, yeah.

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:42.250
&gt;&gt; Herrera: And they took it...

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.120
&gt;&gt; Perez: Someone, someone got
a copy of the original published

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.340
in Spain and made a
copy in Portugal.

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.150
But, there are differences.

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.930
So this has been a source
material for scholars.

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.400
There is a long debate
about the different,

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:02.730
the three different, editions.

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:04.610
&gt;&gt; Herrera: So which one
is the real original?

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.370
&gt;&gt; Perez: Which one has, yeah which
one is missing this, you know,

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:13.410
it's little nuiances that
provided material for,

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:15.580
that has provided material
for research

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:16.880
for many, many, many, years.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.210
&gt;&gt; Herrera: So they
reset, they reset the type.

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:21.610
They reset the type,
is that what they did?

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:22.910
They reset everything?

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:24.410
They redid every line?

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:25.710
&gt;&gt; Perez: Yeah, they, yeah.

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:27.620
&gt;&gt; Herrera: And that's
how they could miss words?

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.430
&gt;&gt; Perez: Yeah, they
they missed words

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:36.740
and sometimes there would
be more than a line or two.

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:40.600
Then the second Madrid
edition is different

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:44.370
than the first Madrid
edition so it's, you know.

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:45.970
&gt;&gt; Herrera: And this
one is in Portuguese?

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:47.740
&gt;&gt; Perez: No, no, this
is in Spanish.

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.040
&gt;&gt; Herrera: Oh, this is in Spanish?

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.510
&gt;&gt; Perez: This is in Spanish,

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:57.250
but pirated in Portugal
that same year, 1605.

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:01.150
And we have the three, the
first Madrid, the pirated,

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:02.960
and then the second Madrid.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.260
&gt;&gt; Herrera: That's amazing.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:05.560
That's beautiful.

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:06.860
And we have them here.

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:08.850
&gt;&gt; Perez: Yes, under
lock and key of course.

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:10.390
&gt;&gt; Herrera: Under lock and key.

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:14.680
&gt;&gt; Perez: But another unique item
that I could mention, for example,

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.810
just to show another example,
is something that I always

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:23.150
like to talk, to say,
when I am being asked

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:26.790
to illustrate the richness
of the collection

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:29.920
or the uniqueness of
these collections.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:35.270
We have a poem by Pablo Neruda,
which he wrote in dedication

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:38.460
to Spain during the
Spanish Civil War.

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:45.000
Again, very few copies were made
and only maybe three or four,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.710
three or four copies exist now.

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:51.340
And it's called Espana
en el CorazÃ³n.

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:54.010
And it's not a very long poem,

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:57.200
but it's just a beautiful,
beautiful poem.

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:02.690
But, the edition that
we have is very unique.

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:07.800
Is that a special edition
because the material that was used

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:12.730
to make the paper came from
the uniforms, from the shirts

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:19.230
of uniforms from Republican
soldiers that had died in a battle.

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:26.110
So, he wrote this poem and he used
the material to honor the dead.

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:30.460
And of course, we have
it under lock and key.

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:32.270
&gt;&gt; Herrera: We have
it under lock and key.

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:36.460 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Perez: Because only three or four
copies exist now, that I know of,

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:37.760
of that particular edition.

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.060
&gt;&gt; Herrera: Pablo Neruda.

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:40.360
&gt;&gt; Perez: Pablo Neruda.

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:41.760
It's called Espana en el CorazÃ³n.

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:48.490 position:56%
And you really have to read the poem
because it's a poem against war,

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:52.110
against the suffering of war...

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:55.050
&gt;&gt; Herrera: ...with the
clothes of the dead.

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:58.630
&gt;&gt; Perez: And then you
imagine the dead soldiers.

00:07:58.630 --> 00:07:59.930
&gt;&gt; Herrera: Yes.

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:03.910 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Perez: And then you imagine their
uniforms used to make the paper.

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:09.160
&gt;&gt; Herrera: And then the poem on
that paper which is the uniforms

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:14.650
and somehow the uniforms and the
body has come to life once again

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:16.990
with the words of Neruda.

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:18.990
&gt;&gt; Perez: We need poems.

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:24.000
&gt;&gt; Herrera: And we need poets.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.650
That's where we started.

00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:27.060
That's right.

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:29.210
We need poets.

00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:30.510
Thank you.

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:31.810
Thank you so much.

00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:33.110
&gt;&gt; Perez: My pleasure.

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:36.190
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
