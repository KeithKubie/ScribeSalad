00:00:00.316 --> 00:00:01.504
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:01.504 --> 00:00:04.980
is talk about a relatively
recent U.S. Supreme Court case,

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.634
and this is the United
States versus Lopez,

00:00:07.634 --> 00:00:10.467
and the decision was made in 1995.

00:00:11.517 --> 00:00:13.840
And this is significant
because many of the cases

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.305
we have talked about are things

00:00:15.305 --> 00:00:18.105
that broadened the power
of the federal government.

00:00:18.105 --> 00:00:20.915
While the decision in
United States versus Lopez,

00:00:20.915 --> 00:00:24.020
which was a split decision, it
was a five-to-four decision,

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.631
put some limits on federal power.

00:00:26.631 --> 00:00:29.964
And so just to understand what happened.

00:00:30.816 --> 00:00:33.465
In 1990, the U.S. Congress passes

00:00:33.465 --> 00:00:37.340
the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.979
And it says, "It shall be
unlawful for any individual

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:45.285
"knowingly to possess a firearm at a place

00:00:45.285 --> 00:00:47.894
"that the individual
knows, or has reasonable

00:00:47.894 --> 00:00:50.977
"cause to believe, is a school zone."

00:00:52.041 --> 00:00:55.025
And in 1992, a high school student in

00:00:55.025 --> 00:00:57.800
San Antonio, Texas, Alfonzo Lopez,

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.511
carries a concealed firearm
into his high school.

00:01:01.511 --> 00:01:04.288
He is arrested, and then
he is eventually prosecuted

00:01:04.288 --> 00:01:08.891
under the Gun-Free School Zones
Act of 1990, a federal law.

00:01:08.891 --> 00:01:10.695
And he is tried in a federal court.

00:01:10.695 --> 00:01:13.348
His lawyers say, "Hey,
this is unconstitutional.

00:01:13.348 --> 00:01:14.797
"The federal government does not have

00:01:14.797 --> 00:01:17.063
"the right to regulate whether someone

00:01:17.063 --> 00:01:19.801
"carries a gun into a school or not."

00:01:19.801 --> 00:01:21.926
While the federal government says,

00:01:21.926 --> 00:01:24.387
"Hey, yes we can do this because

00:01:24.387 --> 00:01:26.667
"look at the United States Constitution.

00:01:26.667 --> 00:01:29.014
"We, the federal government, have a right

00:01:29.014 --> 00:01:31.845
"to regulate interstate trade."

00:01:31.845 --> 00:01:34.380
And remember what McCullouch
versus Maryland told us.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.427
From the necessary and proper clause,

00:01:36.427 --> 00:01:39.091
anything that is a means to regulate,

00:01:39.091 --> 00:01:42.758
say, another enumerated
power, like the power

00:01:42.758 --> 00:01:45.147
to regulate interstate trade, that is

00:01:45.147 --> 00:01:48.239
also constitutional for
the federal government.

00:01:48.239 --> 00:01:50.396
But then, you could imagine,
Lopez's lawyers said,

00:01:50.396 --> 00:01:53.458
"Hold on a second, that is
a very tenuous connection.

00:01:53.458 --> 00:01:55.424
"If you're trying to connect the notion

00:01:55.424 --> 00:01:58.921
"of firearms in schools and school safety,

00:01:58.921 --> 00:02:01.171
"to interstate commerce,
well you could connect

00:02:01.171 --> 00:02:03.438
"almost anything to interstate commerce,

00:02:03.438 --> 00:02:05.309
"which would mean that
between the necessary

00:02:05.309 --> 00:02:07.289
"and proper clause, the implied powers

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:10.694
"and the enumerated powers of
regulated interstate commerce,

00:02:10.694 --> 00:02:11.573
"well then the federal government

00:02:11.573 --> 00:02:13.828
"could just regulate anything."

00:02:13.828 --> 00:02:15.136
And so it eventually gets appealed

00:02:15.136 --> 00:02:17.430
all the way to the United
States Supreme Court.

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.001
And in a split five-to-four decision,

00:02:20.001 --> 00:02:24.405
the United States Supreme Court
decides in favor of Lopez,

00:02:24.405 --> 00:02:27.489
that the Gun-Free School
Zones Act of 1990,

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:29.446
at least as it was originally written,

00:02:29.446 --> 00:02:32.233
was indeed unconstitutional, that it's

00:02:32.233 --> 00:02:34.668
an overreach of federal power.

00:02:34.668 --> 00:02:38.579
And to appreciate the majority's thinking,

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:41.791
here's an excerpt of the
decision by William Rehnquist

00:02:41.791 --> 00:02:44.251
who was the Chief Justice
and who was in the majority

00:02:44.251 --> 00:02:48.383
and he wrote, "To uphold the
government's contentions here,"

00:02:48.383 --> 00:02:50.053
the contention that the
government is making

00:02:50.053 --> 00:02:51.745
that it is constitutional to regulate

00:02:51.745 --> 00:02:54.270
the possession of firearms in a school,

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.743
"we have to pile inference upon inference

00:02:57.743 --> 00:03:00.084
"in a manner that would
bid fair to convert

00:03:00.084 --> 00:03:02.738
"congressional authority
under the Commerce Clause

00:03:02.738 --> 00:03:04.953
"to a general police power of the

00:03:04.953 --> 00:03:07.391
"sort retained by the states."

00:03:07.391 --> 00:03:09.221
So Rehnquist is saying,
"Hey look, if we say

00:03:09.221 --> 00:03:12.357
"that the regulation of
firearms is connected

00:03:12.357 --> 00:03:14.400
"to interstate commerce somehow,

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.242
"because it somehow affects
the economy between states.

00:03:17.242 --> 00:03:19.690
"Well then almost anything, if you layer

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.300
"pile inference upon
inference, then that would

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.623
"give the right to the federal government

00:03:23.623 --> 00:03:26.528
"to police almost anything,
a type of police power

00:03:26.528 --> 00:03:29.333
"that's generally retained by the states."

00:03:29.333 --> 00:03:32.083
"Admittedly, some of our prior cases have

00:03:32.083 --> 00:03:34.711
"taken long steps down that road,

00:03:34.711 --> 00:03:38.002
"giving great deference
to congressional action."

00:03:38.002 --> 00:03:38.885
And you could go all the way back

00:03:38.885 --> 00:03:39.982
to McCulloch versus Maryland.

00:03:39.982 --> 00:03:42.379
He's saying, "Yeah, the
Supreme Court has ruled

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:45.003
"many times in favor of
the federal government,

00:03:45.003 --> 00:03:48.174
"having a broad understanding
of implied powers."

00:03:48.174 --> 00:03:50.571
"The broad language in these opinions

00:03:50.571 --> 00:03:54.610
"has suggested the possibility
of additional expansion,

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.188
"but we decline here to
proceed any further."

00:03:58.188 --> 00:04:00.441
So they're drawing the
line in this decision

00:04:00.441 --> 00:04:03.385
on the expansion of congressional power.

00:04:03.385 --> 00:04:06.122
"To do so would require us to conclude

00:04:06.122 --> 00:04:09.387
"that the Constitution's
enumeration of powers

00:04:09.387 --> 00:04:13.265
"does not presuppose
something not enumerated,

00:04:13.265 --> 00:04:15.615
"and that there never
will be a distinction

00:04:15.615 --> 00:04:20.042
"between what is truly national
and what is truly local.

00:04:20.042 --> 00:04:22.652
"This we are unwilling to do."

00:04:22.652 --> 00:04:24.332
So he's saying, "Hey look, if we took

00:04:24.332 --> 00:04:27.465
"the government's side
on this, there's no end.

00:04:27.465 --> 00:04:30.050
"There really isn't anything
that the federal government

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.559
"can't do, and then there
won't be a distinction

00:04:32.559 --> 00:04:37.364
"between what is truly national
and what is truly local."

00:04:37.364 --> 00:04:39.965
I'll let you decide, but
it's a fascinating case,

00:04:39.965 --> 00:04:41.960
and it's really important
in this discussion

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.902
on power between states
and the federal government

00:04:44.902 --> 00:04:47.605
because this was a decision
that kind of drew a line

00:04:47.605 --> 00:04:50.843
and said, "Okay, we can't
let the federal government

00:04:50.843 --> 00:04:52.724
"have an unlimited number of powers

00:04:52.724 --> 00:04:55.833
"based on just being able to
tie inference upon inference

00:04:55.833 --> 00:04:58.465
"to something like the Commerce Clause."
