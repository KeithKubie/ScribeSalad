- Will you say that
again, so I can record it?

00:00:11.144 --> 00:00:12.078 align:start size:84% position:16%
Then I'll have
something to play back

00:00:12.078 --> 00:00:13.747
when I forget why I hate you.

00:00:13.747 --> 00:00:15.115
Oh, yeah yeah, no
I read about that

00:00:15.115 --> 00:00:17.283
in Highly Unlikely
Bullshit Magazine.

00:00:17.283 --> 00:00:20.220
- I'm bringing a friend to be
my date, so fingers crossed.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.654
- By friend he means hooker,

00:00:21.654 --> 00:00:24.024 align:start size:97% position:3%
and by date he means shallow
grave by the railroad.

00:00:24.024 --> 00:00:25.592 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Dude, a hairy little
woodland creature

00:00:25.592 --> 00:00:26.926
can't direct a movie.

00:00:26.926 --> 00:00:28.795
- Uh, what about Peter Jackson?

00:00:28.795 --> 00:00:30.196
- I hate animals.

00:00:30.196 --> 00:00:34.534 align:start size:94% position:6%
- To be fair, most
animals hate black people.

00:00:34.534 --> 00:00:35.969
And Mexicans.

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.104
I bet you'd like to see
my tight ass in that,

00:00:38.104 --> 00:00:39.472
you creepy pervert.

00:00:39.472 --> 00:00:41.374
What the (bleep) is that?

00:00:41.374 --> 00:00:43.043
I asked for a motorcycle.

00:00:43.043 --> 00:00:45.512
- Malloy, we both know
you're not big enough.

00:00:45.512 --> 00:00:47.680
Besides this is just as cool.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.483
- [Bike] I'm a big
boy, I'm a big boy.

00:00:50.483 --> 00:00:52.585 align:start size:81% position:19%
- I am not getting
on that thing.

00:00:52.585 --> 00:00:54.888
Winnie the Pooh never had
to deal with this bullshit.

00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:57.724 align:start size:81% position:19%
Luckily I found
this pontoon boat.

00:01:00.326 --> 00:01:01.561
Anybody hungry?

00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:03.430
I'm kidding, she
probably has AIDS.
