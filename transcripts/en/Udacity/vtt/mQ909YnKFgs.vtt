00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.831
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Now we can use those two numbers, 20 and 6, and insert them, as a sort of

00:00:03.831 --> 00:00:08.340
expansion, of this middle coefficient, for the x, for the first term. Now we're

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.391
getting much, much closer to being able to factor. I'm going to take one step

00:00:12.391 --> 00:00:16.653
further in simpifying this for you, and then we'll have a little quiz. We know

00:00:16.653 --> 00:00:20.804
that this expression is equal to 8x squared plus 20x plus 6x plus 15. And now

00:00:20.804 --> 00:00:24.774
I'd like you to begin the Factoring. To do that, I'd like you to start off by

00:00:24.774 --> 00:00:28.680
looking at the first two terms, pulling a common factor out of them, and then

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.856
doing the same thing for the second two terms, with their common factor. Write

00:00:32.856 --> 00:00:36.137
the new version of the expression in these two boxes right here.
