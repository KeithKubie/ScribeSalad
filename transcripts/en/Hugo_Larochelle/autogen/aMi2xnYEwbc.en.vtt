00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.899
in this video we'll quickly look at an

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909
in this video we'll quickly look at an
 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:04.940
in this video we'll quickly look at an
alternative to the conditional random

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950
alternative to the conditional random
 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.460
alternative to the conditional random
fields for sequence classification no.1

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470
fields for sequence classification no.1
 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.070
fields for sequence classification no.1
that's the maximum entropy Markov model

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:12.080
 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.810
so we've mainly discuss conditional

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820
so we've mainly discuss conditional
 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.820
so we've mainly discuss conditional
random fields they'll have one advantage

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830
random fields they'll have one advantage
 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.120
random fields they'll have one advantage
which is that they are discriminative Li

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130
which is that they are discriminative Li
 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.970
which is that they are discriminative Li
trained and as we've seen before we

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980
trained and as we've seen before we
 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.500
trained and as we've seen before we
should expect that for a problem where

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510
should expect that for a problem where
 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.810
should expect that for a problem where
we have a lot of data that this is a

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820
we have a lot of data that this is a
 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.670
we have a lot of data that this is a
better approach than training a model

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680
better approach than training a model
 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.089
better approach than training a model
generatively and but we haven't really

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099
generatively and but we haven't really
 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.760
generatively and but we haven't really
discussed whether there were other

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:33.770
discussed whether there were other
 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.200
discussed whether there were other
discriminative alternatives to the

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210
discriminative alternatives to the
 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.330
discriminative alternatives to the
conditional random field so let's look

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340
conditional random field so let's look
 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.790
conditional random field so let's look
at one in this video known at the as the

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800
at one in this video known at the as the
 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.220
at one in this video known at the as the
maximum entropy Markov model so the

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230
maximum entropy Markov model so the
 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.990
maximum entropy Markov model so the
maximum entropy Markov model or M EMM is

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000
maximum entropy Markov model or M EMM is
 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.979
maximum entropy Markov model or M EMM is
different from the conditional random

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989
different from the conditional random
 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.160
different from the conditional random
field for one main reason which is that

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170
field for one main reason which is that
 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.450
field for one main reason which is that
it is directed so we see here an

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460
it is directed so we see here an
 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.939
it is directed so we see here an
illustration of the Emmy mm as a

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949
illustration of the Emmy mm as a
 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.460
illustration of the Emmy mm as a
Bayesian network which means that now we

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470
Bayesian network which means that now we
 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.859
Bayesian network which means that now we
have random variables that are our nodes

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869
have random variables that are our nodes
 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.550
have random variables that are our nodes
in the network and the edges between the

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560
in the network and the edges between the
 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.800
in the network and the edges between the
nodes are actually directed and the

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810
nodes are actually directed and the
 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.109
nodes are actually directed and the
direction of the edges essentially

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119
direction of the edges essentially
 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.730
direction of the edges essentially
illustrate the generative story

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740
illustrate the generative story
 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.510
illustrate the generative story
associated behind the model so in an EM

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520
associated behind the model so in an EM
 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.740
associated behind the model so in an EM
emm the way we assume that the data has

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750
emm the way we assume that the data has
 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.890
emm the way we assume that the data has
been generated is that given the whole

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900
been generated is that given the whole
 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.399
been generated is that given the whole
sequence so an N emm does not define the

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409
sequence so an N emm does not define the
 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.740
sequence so an N emm does not define the
way that the input sequence was was was

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750
way that the input sequence was was was
 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.870
way that the input sequence was was was
generated so it's a conditional model

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880
generated so it's a conditional model
 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.859
generated so it's a conditional model
that does not define a P of X and so

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869
that does not define a P of X and so
 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.499
that does not define a P of X and so
given some input sequence it assumes

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509
given some input sequence it assumes
 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.030
given some input sequence it assumes
that the sequence of labels was

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040
that the sequence of labels was
 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.560
that the sequence of labels was
generated from left to right so the

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570
generated from left to right so the
 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.770
generated from left to right so the
first sequence sorry the first label y 1

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780
first sequence sorry the first label y 1
 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.020
first sequence sorry the first label y 1
was generated only from the information

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030
was generated only from the information
 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.230
was generated only from the information
in X 1 and X 2 so that's for a similar

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240
in X 1 and X 2 so that's for a similar
 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.020
in X 1 and X 2 so that's for a similar
model than the craf with the context

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030
model than the craf with the context
 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.749
model than the craf with the context
window of radius 1 so y 1 was generated

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759
window of radius 1 so y 1 was generated
 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.380
window of radius 1 so y 1 was generated
and then Y 2 was generated from X 1 X 2

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390
and then Y 2 was generated from X 1 X 2
 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.089
and then Y 2 was generated from X 1 X 2
and X 3 and y 1 so all of these guys

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099
and X 3 and y 1 so all of these guys
 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.910
and X 3 and y 1 so all of these guys
were able to influence what value

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920
were able to influence what value
 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.540
were able to influence what value
for the second label was generated and

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550
for the second label was generated and
 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.880
for the second label was generated and
then y3 was then generated and the value

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890
then y3 was then generated and the value
 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.990
then y3 was then generated and the value
of y3 was generated from again Y 2 X 2 X

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000
of y3 was generated from again Y 2 X 2 X
 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.080
of y3 was generated from again Y 2 X 2 X
3 and X 4 and so on until we reach the

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090
3 and X 4 and so on until we reach the
 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.300
3 and X 4 and so on until we reach the
end of the sequence so so it is a markup

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310
end of the sequence so so it is a markup
 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.750
end of the sequence so so it is a markup
in the sense that the distribution of

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760
in the sense that the distribution of
 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.840
in the sense that the distribution of
one label here is dependent also on the

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850
one label here is dependent also on the
 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.940
one label here is dependent also on the
label previously and the transition so

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950
label previously and the transition so
 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.400
label previously and the transition so
it's it's a Markov model similarly to a

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410
it's it's a Markov model similarly to a
 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.310
it's it's a Markov model similarly to a
hidden Markov model but the difference

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320
hidden Markov model but the difference
 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.199
hidden Markov model but the difference
is that in the hidden Markov model we

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209
is that in the hidden Markov model we
 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:55.940
is that in the hidden Markov model we
would have arrows going down like this

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950
would have arrows going down like this
 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.070
would have arrows going down like this
from the labels to the input whereas for

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080
from the labels to the input whereas for
 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.949
from the labels to the input whereas for
a maximum entropy Markov model the

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959
a maximum entropy Markov model the
 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.380
a maximum entropy Markov model the
arrows are this way instead so we don't

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390
arrows are this way instead so we don't
 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:07.820
arrows are this way instead so we don't
actually define the distribution over

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830
actually define the distribution over
 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.070
actually define the distribution over
the inputs and we just define a

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080
the inputs and we just define a
 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.640
the inputs and we just define a
conditional distribution over the labels

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650
conditional distribution over the labels
 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.729
conditional distribution over the labels
and the conditional story goes from you

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739
and the conditional story goes from you
 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:18.800
and the conditional story goes from you
know we assume that's there was some

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810
know we assume that's there was some
 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.120
know we assume that's there was some
generative process for the old inputs

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130
generative process for the old inputs
 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.100
generative process for the old inputs
and then the sequence which is generated

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110
and then the sequence which is generated
 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:23.449
and then the sequence which is generated
instead of the other way around

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459
instead of the other way around
 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.990
instead of the other way around
and so more specifically the probability

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000
and so more specifically the probability
 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.240
and so more specifically the probability
of a sequence of label Y given the

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250
of a sequence of label Y given the
 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.520
of a sequence of label Y given the
sequence of input X is going to be this

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530
sequence of input X is going to be this
 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.000
sequence of input X is going to be this
product of conditional probabilities

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010
product of conditional probabilities
 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.630
product of conditional probabilities
over Y K given the previous label Y K

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640
over Y K given the previous label Y K
 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.620
over Y K given the previous label Y K
minus 1 and some information in X so in

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630
minus 1 and some information in X so in
 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.710
minus 1 and some information in X so in
the case here sometimes you know for y1

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720
the case here sometimes you know for y1
 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.490
the case here sometimes you know for y1
it was only x1 and x2 that influenced

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500
it was only x1 and x2 that influenced
 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.069
it was only x1 and x2 that influenced
the probability of y1 but in general it

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079
the probability of y1 but in general it
 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:54.530
the probability of y1 but in general it
could depend on the whole sequence or so

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540
could depend on the whole sequence or so
 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.550
could depend on the whole sequence or so
I just use a general form here and what

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560
I just use a general form here and what
 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.140
I just use a general form here and what
would be used for the conditional

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150
would be used for the conditional
 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.340
would be used for the conditional
distribution the way they would be

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350
distribution the way they would be
 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.479
distribution the way they would be
factored would be through a something

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489
factored would be through a something
 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:07.370
factored would be through a something
very similar to either a logistic

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380
very similar to either a logistic
 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.560
very similar to either a logistic
regression or a neural network so you

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570
regression or a neural network so you
 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:12.140
regression or a neural network so you
would essentially have a term that would

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150
would essentially have a term that would
 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.620
would essentially have a term that would
depend similar to unary log factors that

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630
depend similar to unary log factors that
 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.479
depend similar to unary log factors that
would depend on some information in the

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489
would depend on some information in the
 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.630
would depend on some information in the
input and then plus something similar to

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:20.640
input and then plus something similar to
 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.140
input and then plus something similar to
a pairwise factor where given the value

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150
a pairwise factor where given the value
 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.129
a pairwise factor where given the value
at the previous step in

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:27.139
at the previous step in
 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:30.640
at the previous step in
the sequence K minus 1 this we could

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650
the sequence K minus 1 this we could
 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.140
the sequence K minus 1 this we could
express the preference for what the

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150
express the preference for what the
 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.450
express the preference for what the
value we think would be most likely at

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460
value we think would be most likely at
 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.939
value we think would be most likely at
white game and that we would normalize

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:36.949
white game and that we would normalize
 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:39.040
white game and that we would normalize
this and now the normalization constant

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050
this and now the normalization constant
 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:41.830
this and now the normalization constant
here would depend not just on X but also

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840
here would depend not just on X but also
 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.249
here would depend not just on X but also
on the value of y K minus 1 so the

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:45.259
on the value of y K minus 1 so the
 

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:47.140
on the value of y K minus 1 so the
normalization constant here Zed would be

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150
normalization constant here Zed would be
 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.610
normalization constant here Zed would be
the sum over the numerator over all the

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620
the sum over the numerator over all the
 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.550
the sum over the numerator over all the
potential values for just waiking so

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560
potential values for just waiking so
 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.080
potential values for just waiking so
here we don't have a partition function

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090
here we don't have a partition function
 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.330
here we don't have a partition function
over the where we have a summation over

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340
over the where we have a summation over
 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.089
over the where we have a summation over
all sequences we have only a sum over

00:05:01.089 --> 00:05:01.099
all sequences we have only a sum over
 

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:03.550
all sequences we have only a sum over
the value of the label for the current

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560
the value of the label for the current
 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:10.029
the value of the label for the current
position for a given conditional so this

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:10.039
position for a given conditional so this
 

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:11.320
position for a given conditional so this
is the model that's not too complicated

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330
is the model that's not too complicated
 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.800
is the model that's not too complicated
to train but has one problem which is

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810
to train but has one problem which is
 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:16.860
to train but has one problem which is
known as the label bias problem

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870
known as the label bias problem
 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:20.619
known as the label bias problem
so essentially intuitively what it means

00:05:20.619 --> 00:05:20.629
so essentially intuitively what it means
 

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:23.050
so essentially intuitively what it means
is that the observations that are far

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060
is that the observations that are far
 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.089
is that the observations that are far
away in the sequence will not impact

00:05:25.089 --> 00:05:25.099
away in the sequence will not impact
 

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:27.209
away in the sequence will not impact
predictions that we would be making

00:05:27.209 --> 00:05:27.219
predictions that we would be making
 

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:30.189
predictions that we would be making
early in the sequence and this could be

00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:30.199
early in the sequence and this could be
 

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:32.679
early in the sequence and this could be
this can be illustrated in this example

00:05:32.679 --> 00:05:32.689
this can be illustrated in this example
 

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:35.469
this can be illustrated in this example
here where we actually have and we can

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:35.479
here where we actually have and we can
 

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:37.929
here where we actually have and we can
show that the marginal probability of

00:05:37.929 --> 00:05:37.939
show that the marginal probability of
 

00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:40.140
show that the marginal probability of
the third label given the whole sequence

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:40.150
the third label given the whole sequence
 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:44.019
the third label given the whole sequence
actually only depends it can be reduced

00:05:44.019 --> 00:05:44.029
actually only depends it can be reduced
 

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:46.689
actually only depends it can be reduced
to the conditional probability of y3

00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:46.699
to the conditional probability of y3
 

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:50.439
to the conditional probability of y3
given only the first four elements in

00:05:50.439 --> 00:05:50.449
given only the first four elements in
 

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:53.050
given only the first four elements in
the sequence so in particular because I

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.060
the sequence so in particular because I
 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:54.999
the sequence so in particular because I
have a context window that goes only up

00:05:54.999 --> 00:05:55.009
have a context window that goes only up
 

00:05:55.009 --> 00:06:01.329
have a context window that goes only up
to here well then this this label here

00:06:01.329 --> 00:06:01.339
to here well then this this label here
 

00:06:01.339 --> 00:06:04.119
to here well then this this label here
and this label here can be marginalized

00:06:04.119 --> 00:06:04.129
and this label here can be marginalized
 

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:08.110
and this label here can be marginalized
out so if I wanted so I want to know

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:08.120
out so if I wanted so I want to know
 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.379
out so if I wanted so I want to know
what's the conditional probability of

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:10.389
what's the conditional probability of
 

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:16.689
what's the conditional probability of
summing of Y 3 given X 1 X 2 X 3 X 4 X 5

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:16.699
summing of Y 3 given X 1 X 2 X 3 X 4 X 5
 

00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:18.579
summing of Y 3 given X 1 X 2 X 3 X 4 X 5
now to do this I will need to

00:06:18.579 --> 00:06:18.589
now to do this I will need to
 

00:06:18.589 --> 00:06:21.399
now to do this I will need to
marginalize over these labels here and

00:06:21.399 --> 00:06:21.409
marginalize over these labels here and
 

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:26.499
marginalize over these labels here and
these labels here now if I can if I

00:06:26.499 --> 00:06:26.509
these labels here now if I can if I
 

00:06:26.509 --> 00:06:28.389
these labels here now if I can if I
marginalize those out that I can't

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:28.399
marginalize those out that I can't
 

00:06:28.399 --> 00:06:30.399
marginalize those out that I can't
really reduce anything because these

00:06:30.399 --> 00:06:30.409
really reduce anything because these
 

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:34.209
really reduce anything because these
depend on these then the will in they

00:06:34.209 --> 00:06:34.219
depend on these then the will in they
 

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:38.249
depend on these then the will in they
will have an impact on Y 3 through Y 1

00:06:38.249 --> 00:06:38.259
will have an impact on Y 3 through Y 1
 

00:06:38.259 --> 00:06:41.710
will have an impact on Y 3 through Y 1
however from this because

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:41.720
however from this because
 

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.900
however from this because
the arrows is directed like this and

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:43.910
the arrows is directed like this and
 

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:45.040
the arrows is directed like this and
like that

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:45.050
like that
 

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:49.750
like that
if I marginalize over Wi-Fi then it's

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:49.760
if I marginalize over Wi-Fi then it's
 

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.940
if I marginalize over Wi-Fi then it's
actually equivalent to just removing

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:51.950
actually equivalent to just removing
 

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:56.530
actually equivalent to just removing
that note and that's because if I write

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:56.540
that note and that's because if I write
 

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:58.510
that note and that's because if I write
out the full expression for the

00:06:58.510 --> 00:06:58.520
out the full expression for the
 

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.750
out the full expression for the
probability of everything including

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:01.760
probability of everything including
 

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:04.330
probability of everything including
Wi-Fi and then this marginalizes into a

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:04.340
Wi-Fi and then this marginalizes into a
 

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:06.960
Wi-Fi and then this marginalizes into a
conditional that only involves Wi-Fi and

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:06.970
conditional that only involves Wi-Fi and
 

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:09.940
conditional that only involves Wi-Fi and
this term actually needs to sum to one

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:09.950
this term actually needs to sum to one
 

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:14.410
this term actually needs to sum to one
so I can just sum sum it out some that

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:14.420
so I can just sum sum it out some that
 

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:17.470
so I can just sum sum it out some that
term out and then if I do the same thing

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:17.480
term out and then if I do the same thing
 

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:21.220
term out and then if I do the same thing
with y4 so now I have this essentially I

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:21.230
with y4 so now I have this essentially I
 

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:23.290
with y4 so now I have this essentially I
have a simpler graphical model that does

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:23.300
have a simpler graphical model that does
 

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:25.300
have a simpler graphical model that does
not include Wi-Fi and then I can also

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:25.310
not include Wi-Fi and then I can also
 

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:27.820
not include Wi-Fi and then I can also
integrate out y4 because now it's the

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:27.830
integrate out y4 because now it's the
 

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:31.120
integrate out y4 because now it's the
last in my sort of hierarchy or random

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:31.130
last in my sort of hierarchy or random
 

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:33.520
last in my sort of hierarchy or random
variable is the last one which doesn't

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:33.530
variable is the last one which doesn't
 

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:35.680
variable is the last one which doesn't
have any descendants now and so I can

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:35.690
have any descendants now and so I can
 

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:37.990
have any descendants now and so I can
also integrate it out which means that

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:38.000
also integrate it out which means that
 

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.640
also integrate it out which means that
this would yield a simpler graph like

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:42.650
this would yield a simpler graph like
 

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:46.600
this would yield a simpler graph like
that and so now we see that X 5 is not

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:46.610
that and so now we see that X 5 is not
 

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:51.040
that and so now we see that X 5 is not
connected anymore to y3 and so for that

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:51.050
connected anymore to y3 and so for that
 

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:53.650
connected anymore to y3 and so for that
reason we have that y3 given X is

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:53.660
reason we have that y3 given X is
 

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:57.490
reason we have that y3 given X is
actually just sorry P of y3 given X it's

00:07:57.490 --> 00:07:57.500
actually just sorry P of y3 given X it's
 

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:01.810
actually just sorry P of y3 given X it's
just P of Y 3 given X 1 up to X 4 so I'm

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:01.820
just P of Y 3 given X 1 up to X 4 so I'm
 

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:05.740
just P of Y 3 given X 1 up to X 4 so I'm
going fairly quickly over this those

going fairly quickly over this those
 

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:07.030
going fairly quickly over this those
that are familiar with directed

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:07.040
that are familiar with directed

that are familiar with directed
graphical model might see why why this

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:08.780
