[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:15.190
I definitely think the human
journey is characterized

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.530
by a desire to expand
what we can see.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:23.260
We've had this uncanny
ability to engineer solutions

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.590
for our perceptual limitations.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.370
So we couldn't see in
the microwave spectrum,

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:31.400
other modalities within the
electromagnetic spectrum.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.360
And we create these
tools-- radar and scanners

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.380
and so on and so forth.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.930
These instruments that
allow us to all of a sudden

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.642
perceive other dimensions beyond
what our senses can usually

00:00:42.642 --> 00:00:43.790
detect.

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.950
We've also could only
experience a moment

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.620
before it's gone, right?

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.770
And with tools like the camera,
the digital lens, the iris,

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.950
all of a sudden we are extending
the eye to freeze frame,

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.930
to hold in stasis the
passing moment, effectively

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.450
immortalizing the most
elusive thing we know,

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.870
which is the now.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.680
That's why I love
cameras like this one.
