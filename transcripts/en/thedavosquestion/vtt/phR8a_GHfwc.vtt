00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
&gt;&gt; Hi, I'm an old astronaut/Mir cosmonaut.
I spent about five months off the planet and

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.190
now I'm -- here in Davos
on the planet.

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:10.320
I've been over this place a couple thousand
times so it's nice to be

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.279
down on the earth now and actually putting
my footprint here.

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:19.070
You know, my big love and life now is the
world's water and fresh

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.220
resources.
I was out in space looking down on the planet

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.439
and you see the great
rivers of the world, you know, the Tigris,

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:32.439
Euphrates, the Nile, the
Ganges, the Yangtze, you know, defining civilizations.

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:35.270
Wanna go to Mars someday.
When we go to Mars what's the first thing

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.840
we're looking at?
Where are we gonna get the water if we wanna

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.850
survive on Mars?
Spent five months up, closed ecosystem, we

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.280
had to make our air; we
actually took our urine, converted it into

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.370
water and then we would use
that as drinking water; we also used the sweat,

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.859
we condensed it, we'd
use that water, put the hydrogen off and we'd

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:57.929
breathe the oxygen from
that H2O.

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:01.980
So in a closed ecosystem for five months,
failing life support systems

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.120
you figure out very quickly that, uh, water's
essential, uh, in that

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.370
closed ecosystem you mess up, you get the
result very quickly.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.990
Here on earth, you know, looking from space
at the earth, same thing.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.080
Closed ecosystem. We mess up our resources
down here, especially our

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.720
water -- fresh water supplies -- uh, you know,
we're gonna pay the

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.250
consequences.
Unfortunately on earth it kinda buffers things

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.970
out.
You got thousands of millions of people down

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.770
here so you don't get it.
Closed ecosystem, three people, you contaminate

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.280
the water source and
you find out the next day that you're in trouble.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.640
So I guess my plea from here in Davos World
Economic Forum that we

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.420
need to tap our fresh water resources around
the world and in the

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.570
developing world get some fresh drinking water
for all the children,

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.960
for the families that need it.
Uh, in the developed world, taking care of

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.100
the resources, the beauty
of our planet and, uh, keeping the circle

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.110
of blue as it looks like
from space clean, pure, and blue for future

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.480
generations.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.780
Thanks.
