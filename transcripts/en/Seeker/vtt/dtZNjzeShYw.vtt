00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.900
Death, large animals,
broken internet--

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.540
these are all very scary
to the average person.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.623
But could another one
of our fears be silence?

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:15.936
Hey everyone, Laci
Green here for DNews.

00:00:15.936 --> 00:00:18.185
Sometimes I'm sitting in my
apartment trying to write,

00:00:18.185 --> 00:00:19.700
and, before too long,
I'll find myself

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.965
putting on a YouTube video,
or the TV, in the background.

00:00:21.965 --> 00:00:24.170
And it's not as if I'm
actually listening to the TV.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:25.207
I'm just hearing it.

00:00:25.207 --> 00:00:25.930
It's not loud.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.626
It's just softly droning
on in the background.

00:00:28.626 --> 00:00:30.000
I guess, to me,
there's something

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.950
mildly uncomfortable
about sitting

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.580
too long in total quiet.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.360
A six-year study done
on 580 undergrads

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.410
found that, hey, I'm not crazy.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:39.810
This is a widespread phenomenon.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:41.601
And although they
haven't confirmed it yet,

00:00:41.601 --> 00:00:44.280
scientists suspect that
this discomfort in silence

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.780
might be something
that's learned.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.790
Perhaps it's a product
of the media bombardment

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.498
that we're faced with
in day-to-day life.

00:00:49.498 --> 00:00:51.360
Perhaps it's the
airplanes and helicopters,

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.320
and buses and cars,
air conditioners,

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.709
heating systems,
computers, refrigerators,

00:00:55.709 --> 00:00:56.625
distant conversations.

00:00:56.625 --> 00:00:59.590
At any given moment there
are 30 to 60 decibels

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.290
of sound humming away in
the background of life.

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:03.690
Just stop and listen.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.340
You'll hear it, even
if you didn't even

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:06.230
realize it was there.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.600
We're so used to
this unquiet, perhaps

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.360
we're even starting
to prefer it.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.940
But according to
science and things,

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.210
this preference
might not be so good.

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.460
The International Journal
of Hygiene and Environmental

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.250
Health reports that this
ongoing low level background

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.060
noise could have negative
effects on long term cognitive

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.150
learning and unconscious
physiological processes.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.380
The ability to memorize
and recall information

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:28.970
is disrupted by
background noise.

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.350
A study at the US Army
Engineer Research Center

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.850
found that the ideal sound
level for test taking

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.460
is 28 decibels, about
the same as a whisper.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.050
The theory goes background
noise, even when it's

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.780
low level, subconsciously
averts energy and brain

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.320
power to process all that junk.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.030
But total silence ain't
that great either.

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.200
In Minneapolis, you'll find
the world's quietest room,

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.860
an anechoic chamber
in which the noise

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.990
levels are negative 9 decimals.

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.400
I don't even know
how that's possible.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.710
But apparently it
is, and it drives

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.365
people insane, like,
literally crazy.

00:02:00.365 --> 00:02:03.330
They start hallucinating
and craving human flesh.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:04.910
OK, maybe not the
human flesh part.

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:06.161
But definitely hallucinations.

00:02:06.161 --> 00:02:08.243
You're sitting there alone
with just your thoughts

00:02:08.243 --> 00:02:09.850
and the sound of your heartbeat.

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:11.280
And your brain
just can't take it.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.620
So it starts making [BLEEP] up.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.470
The longest someone has lasted
in this profound silence

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.430
is 45 minutes.

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.140
The brain, man, it's
so hard to satisfy.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.250
Like, do you want noise or not?

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.920
Perhaps the solution
to our sound woes

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:24.920
is somewhere in between.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.504
In the comments
below, I want to know,

00:02:26.504 --> 00:02:29.003
do you guys put on background
noise when you're doing stuff?

00:02:29.003 --> 00:02:30.190
Or do you prefer the quiet?

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.070
Thanks for watching DNews.

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.570
guys.

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.510
We'll be back again tomorrow.
