00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:01.870
Hi, I'm Don Dini.

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:04.410
I'm a principle data scientist at AT&amp;T.

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.800
As a data scientist it is my job to build models.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.690
My background is in artificial intelligence and computer science.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.030
Now among other things today, I work on using simulation to

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.790
solve problems that are often too hard for traditional analytical approaches.

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:22.180
Such as understanding city populations, and

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.300
the design of communication networks.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.264
I will appear mostly in lesson One and

00:00:27.264 --> 00:00:30.820
lesson Two to guide you through the first half of the class.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.630
&gt;&gt; Hi, my name is Rishi Raj Prabahan,

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.110
I'm also a principle data scientist at AT&amp;T.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.050
My background is in experimental high energy physics.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.580
As part of the team that built the Atlas Detector that ended up discovering

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:50.520
the Higgs Particle, completing the standard model of particle physics.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.100
A model that in a single mathematical equation,

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.980
describes the behavior of all known matter and their interactions.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.150
I will follow up, after Don, and appear in the second half of the course.

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.840
We are both working on various problems effecting networks,

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.320
systems, data and customers of AT&amp;T.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.770
In this course, we will try to introduce you

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:20.350
to as much of the formal mathematics, statistics, machine learning and

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:26.170
programming as the everyday experience of data analysis and model building.
