been a very fruitful collaboration but
so we witness these developments and we

00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:32.830
so we witness these developments and we
 

00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:34.409
so we witness these developments and we
wondered whether we should go to cross

00:22:34.409 --> 00:22:34.419
wondered whether we should go to cross
 

00:22:34.419 --> 00:22:36.810
wondered whether we should go to cross
cavities but we still decided it was

00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:36.820
cavities but we still decided it was

better to stick to upward cavities

00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:38.440
better to stick to upward cavities
 

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:40.320

the photon lifetime is very long but you
see that the atoms have to get very

because they have
 

00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:51.450
because they have
to go through very small holes and the

close to the holes so in this experiment
 

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:01.470
close to the holes so in this experiment
it's very difficult to control the

00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:01.480
it's very difficult to control the
 

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:03.660
it's very difficult to control the
atomic state and hence the field inside

00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:03.670
atomic state and hence the field inside
 

00:23:03.670 --> 00:23:06.660
atomic state and hence the field inside
so we decided we really had to go on

00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:06.670
so we decided we really had to go on
 

00:23:06.670 --> 00:23:09.660
so we decided we really had to go on
with our open cavities and it took us

00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:09.670
with our open cavities and it took us
 

00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:11.630
with our open cavities and it took us
about 20 years to develop the technology

00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:11.640
about 20 years to develop the technology
 

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:14.880
about 20 years to develop the technology
which enabled us to get open cavity with

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:14.890
which enabled us to get open cavity with
 

00:23:14.890 --> 00:23:17.250
which enabled us to get open cavity with
the same kind of queue as these ones say

00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:17.260
the same kind of queue as these ones say
 

00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:18.750
the same kind of queue as these ones say
and this and this led us to the

00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:18.760
and this and this led us to the
 

00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:20.850
and this and this led us to the
experiments which bring me here today

00:23:20.850 --> 00:23:20.860
experiments which bring me here today
 

00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:22.740
experiments which bring me here today
but to describe these experiments I

00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:22.750
but to describe these experiments I
 

00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:25.230
but to describe these experiments I
think I will switch from the historical

00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:25.240
think I will switch from the historical
 

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:27.570
think I will switch from the historical
description to something which will be

00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:27.580
description to something which will be
 

00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:32.790
description to something which will be
more deductive and and phasing the

00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:32.800
more deductive and and phasing the
 

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:35.160
more deductive and and phasing the
physics rather than history but I have

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:35.170
physics rather than history but I have
 

00:23:35.170 --> 00:23:36.690

to start with the first point usually
when you talk about detecting light you

00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:39.700
when you talk about detecting light you
 

00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:41.940
when you talk about detecting light you
use the photoelectric effect and the

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:41.950
use the photoelectric effect and the
 

00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:45.390
use the photoelectric effect and the
photoelectric effect which was described

00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:45.400
photoelectric effect which was described
 

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:48.060
photoelectric effect which was described
first by Einstein 9:05 destroys the

impinge on a sensitive detector your
 

00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:57.930
impinge on a sensitive detector your
retina or a photosensitive cathode you

00:23:57.930 --> 00:23:57.940

00:23:57.940 --> 00:24:00.090
retina or a photosensitive cathode you
get clicks which shows that the photon

00:24:00.090 --> 00:24:00.100
get clicks which shows that the photon
 

00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:02.490
get clicks which shows that the photon
had been there but you click destroy the

00:24:02.490 --> 00:24:02.500
had been there but you click destroy the
 

00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:04.830
had been there but you click destroy the
photons so you had a photon and after

00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:04.840
photons so you had a photon and after
 

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:06.690
photons so you had a photon and after
the click you have zero photons button

00:24:06.690 --> 00:24:06.700
the click you have zero photons button
 

00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:09.120
the click you have zero photons button
is gone so this is not so much different

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:09.130

collisions of the photon with the
 

00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:21.600
collisions of the photon with the
photosensitive surface and this is not

00:24:21.610 --> 00:24:24.210

what you want if you want to detect

00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:24.220
what you want if you want to detect
 

00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:27.270
what you want if you want to detect
photons in vivo what you want instead is

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:35.610
the photon inside your system and so
that you would be able to repeat the

that you would be able to repeat the
 

00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:37.620
that you would be able to repeat the
experiments again and again and this is

00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:37.630
experiments again and again and this is
 

00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:39.570
experiments again and again and this is
called a quantum non demolition

00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:39.580
called a quantum non demolition
 

00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:41.850

and you also need a very good box to

and you also need a very good box to
 

00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:06.500
and you also need a very good box to
keep the photons long enough and so we

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:06.510
keep the photons long enough and so we
 

00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:08.660
keep the photons long enough and so we

improve the surface of our mirrors and
 

00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:24.880
improve the surface of our mirrors and

a dead cat you don't know which but
without this superposition this is a

00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:36.680
without this superposition this is a
 

00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:38.830
without this superposition this is a
classical state and this is a quantum

00:38:38.830 --> 00:38:38.840
classical state and this is a quantum
 

00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:41.650
classical state and this is a quantum
state so we described in this paper how

00:38:41.650 --> 00:38:41.660
state so we described in this paper how
 

00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:43.660

to build these quantum states and in

00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:43.670
to build these quantum states and in
 

00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:46.060
to build these quantum states and in
fact we are able to do it in a very

interferometer we start by preparing a

00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:51.370
interferometer we start by preparing a
 

00:38:51.370 --> 00:38:55.270
interferometer we start by preparing a
field in the cavity then we send the

00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:55.280
field in the cavity then we send the
 

00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:57.220
field in the cavity then we send the
single atom prepare it in a

00:38:57.220 --> 00:38:57.230
single atom prepare it in a
 

00:38:57.230 --> 00:38:59.770
single atom prepare it in a
superposition of state this atom crosses

00:38:59.770 --> 00:38:59.780
superposition of state this atom crosses
 

00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:03.340
superposition of state this atom crosses
the cavity and it imparts to the field a

00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:03.350
the cavity and it imparts to the field a
 

00:39:03.350 --> 00:39:06.360
the cavity and it imparts to the field a
phase shift which takes opposite signs

00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:06.370
phase shift which takes opposite signs
 

00:39:06.370 --> 00:39:08.650
phase shift which takes opposite signs
depending upon whether the atom is in

00:39:08.650 --> 00:39:08.660
depending upon whether the atom is in
 

00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:10.360
depending upon whether the atom is in
the upper and the lower state so you get

00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:10.370
the upper and the lower state so you get
 

00:39:10.370 --> 00:39:12.070
the upper and the lower state so you get
at this point an entangled State

00:39:12.070 --> 00:39:12.080
at this point an entangled State
 

00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:15.250
at this point an entangled State
this entangled state is a typical single

00:39:15.250 --> 00:39:15.260
this entangled state is a typical single
 

00:39:15.260 --> 00:39:17.890
this entangled state is a typical single
cut situation and you can also look at

00:39:17.890 --> 00:39:17.900
cut situation and you can also look at
 

00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:20.920
cut situation and you can also look at
it as a typical measurement situation

00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:20.930
it as a typical measurement situation
 

00:39:20.930 --> 00:39:24.460
it as a typical measurement situation
this state is a kind of meter which

00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:24.470
this state is a kind of meter which
 

00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:30.220
this state is a kind of meter which
points in different direction

00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:30.230
 
 

00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:31.640
 
you

00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:31.650
you
 

00:39:31.650 --> 00:39:34.130
you
happens in all measurements so you get

00:39:34.130 --> 00:39:34.140
happens in all measurements so you get
 

00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:35.780
happens in all measurements so you get
an entanglement in the measurement and

00:39:35.780 --> 00:39:35.790
an entanglement in the measurement and
 

00:39:35.790 --> 00:39:38.750
an entanglement in the measurement and
then the atom crosses the second zone

00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:38.760
then the atom crosses the second zone
 

00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:41.060
then the atom crosses the second zone
and the second zone makes the states

00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:41.070
and the second zone makes the states
 

00:39:41.070 --> 00:39:43.370
and the second zone makes the states
again which maintains the Katz ambiguity

00:39:43.370 --> 00:39:43.380
again which maintains the Katz ambiguity
 

00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:45.650
again which maintains the Katz ambiguity
and in the end when you detect the atom

00:39:45.650 --> 00:39:45.660
and in the end when you detect the atom
 

00:39:45.660 --> 00:39:47.390
and in the end when you detect the atom
in one state or the other you project

00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:47.400
in one state or the other you project
 

00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:50.420
in one state or the other you project
the field into a cat so I don't have

00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:50.430

personal remarks of course I have a
thought for my parents and for all the

00:46:52.250 --> 00:46:52.260
thought for my parents and for all the
 

00:46:52.260 --> 00:46:54.320
thought for my parents and for all the
people who are no longer here and

00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:54.330
people who are no longer here and
 

00:46:54.330 --> 00:46:59.000
people who are no longer here and
have really enjoyed this this time but I

00:46:59.000 --> 00:46:59.010
have really enjoyed this this time but I
 

00:46:59.010 --> 00:47:01.640
have really enjoyed this this time but I
want also to add that more than

00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:01.650
want also to add that more than
 

00:47:01.650 --> 00:47:03.200
want also to add that more than
everything else nothing would have been

00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:03.210
everything else nothing would have been
 

00:47:03.210 --> 00:47:06.710
everything else nothing would have been
possible without Claudine with whom I

00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:06.720
possible without Claudine with whom I
 

00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:17.090
possible without Claudine with whom I
have shared all these years

00:47:17.090 --> 00:47:17.100
 
 

00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:20.240
 
I must say that I don't see if I should

00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:20.250
I must say that I don't see if I should

been really fueling me during all these

been really fueling me during all these
 

00:47:28.530 --> 00:47:31.820
been really fueling me during all these
years and this goes much beyond science

00:47:31.820 --> 00:47:31.830
years and this goes much beyond science

00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:27.470
but the key thing is that all we can say
is that the cat is neither dead nor

00:52:27.470 --> 00:52:27.480
is that the cat is neither dead nor
 

00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:32.000
is that the cat is neither dead nor
alive it's both so that was of course

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:32.010
alive it's both so that was of course
 

00:52:32.010 --> 00:52:34.490
alive it's both so that was of course
what bothering Schrodinger now one thing

00:52:34.490 --> 00:52:34.500
what bothering Schrodinger now one thing
 

00:52:34.500 --> 00:52:38.540
what bothering Schrodinger now one thing
I this idea of superposition which the

00:52:38.540 --> 00:52:38.550
I this idea of superposition which the
 

00:52:38.550 --> 00:52:40.640
I this idea of superposition which the
Schrodinger can is a good example of I

00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:40.650
Schrodinger can is a good example of I
 

00:52:40.650 --> 00:52:44.300
Schrodinger can is a good example of I
think I like this example a Kris Munroe

00:52:44.300 --> 00:52:44.310
think I like this example a Kris Munroe
 

00:52:44.310 --> 00:52:48.380
think I like this example a Kris Munroe
found this book when he was in our group

00:52:48.380 --> 00:52:48.390
found this book when he was in our group
 

00:52:48.390 --> 00:52:52.010
found this book when he was in our group
and anyway I think it's a it's a really

00:52:52.010 --> 00:52:52.020
and anyway I think it's a it's a really
 

00:52:52.020 --> 00:52:53.870
and anyway I think it's a it's a really
nice example you can think of it if you

00:52:53.870 --> 00:52:53.880
nice example you can think of it if you
 

00:52:53.880 --> 00:52:57.440
nice example you can think of it if you
think about this box up here and if you

00:52:57.440 --> 00:52:57.450
think about this box up here and if you
 

00:52:57.450 --> 00:52:59.420
think about this box up here and if you
of course play with your eyes you can

00:52:59.420 --> 00:52:59.430
of course play with your eyes you can
 

00:52:59.430 --> 00:53:03.349
of course play with your eyes you can
either see this surface here being the

00:53:03.349 --> 00:53:03.359
either see this surface here being the
 

00:53:03.359 --> 00:53:07.130
either see this surface here being the
foreground or this or the the surface on

00:53:07.130 --> 00:53:07.140
foreground or this or the the surface on
 

00:53:07.140 --> 00:53:08.690
foreground or this or the the surface on
the upper right be in the foreground

00:53:08.690 --> 00:53:08.700
the upper right be in the foreground
 

00:53:08.700 --> 00:53:13.849
the upper right be in the foreground
then so you tend to see either this

00:53:13.849 --> 00:53:13.859
then so you tend to see either this
 

00:53:13.859 --> 00:53:15.109
then so you tend to see either this
surface and the foreground of that

00:53:15.109 --> 00:53:15.119
surface and the foreground of that
 

00:53:15.119 --> 00:53:17.510
surface and the foreground of that
surface in the foreground and and what's

00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:17.520
surface in the foreground and and what's
 

00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:20.060
surface in the foreground and and what's
I think it's a useful analogy because

00:53:20.060 --> 00:53:20.070
I think it's a useful analogy because
 

00:53:20.070 --> 00:53:22.849
I think it's a useful analogy because
this in this picture here it basically

00:53:22.849 --> 00:53:22.859
this in this picture here it basically
 

00:53:22.859 --> 00:53:27.290
this in this picture here it basically
has both properties so and and this is

00:53:27.290 --> 00:53:27.300
has both properties so and and this is
 

00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:29.450
has both properties so and and this is
what we call superposition in quantum

00:53:29.450 --> 00:53:29.460
what we call superposition in quantum
 

00:53:29.460 --> 00:53:31.400
what we call superposition in quantum
mechanics there's something ambiguity

00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:31.410
mechanics there's something ambiguity
 

00:53:31.410 --> 00:53:34.280
mechanics there's something ambiguity
about which state the boxes in and it

00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:34.290
about which state the boxes in and it
 

00:53:34.290 --> 00:53:36.550
about which state the boxes in and it
actually possesses both properties

00:53:36.550 --> 00:53:36.560
actually possesses both properties
 

00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:41.030
actually possesses both properties
simultaneously the the other thing is

00:53:41.030 --> 00:53:41.040
simultaneously the the other thing is
 

00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:43.670
simultaneously the the other thing is
that when we when we talk about doing

00:53:43.670 --> 00:53:43.680
that when we when we talk about doing
 

00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:45.950
that when we when we talk about doing
measurements on quantum systems we

00:53:45.950 --> 00:53:45.960
measurements on quantum systems we
 

00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:48.200
measurements on quantum systems we
talked it's called collapse or

00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:48.210
talked it's called collapse or
 

00:53:48.210 --> 00:53:50.870
talked it's called collapse or
measurement projection and this example

00:53:50.870 --> 00:53:50.880
measurement projection and this example
 

00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:53.870
measurement projection and this example
also shows that I think in a nice way

00:53:53.870 --> 00:53:53.880
also shows that I think in a nice way
 

00:53:53.880 --> 00:53:56.330
also shows that I think in a nice way
because when you look at this box here

00:53:56.330 --> 00:53:56.340
because when you look at this box here
 

00:53:56.340 --> 00:53:58.520
because when you look at this box here
and you know for example at an instant

00:53:58.520 --> 00:53:58.530
and you know for example at an instant
 

00:53:58.530 --> 00:54:00.500
and you know for example at an instant
you might see this surface being the in

00:54:00.500 --> 00:54:00.510
you might see this surface being the in
 

00:54:00.510 --> 00:54:02.780
you might see this surface being the in
the foreground like this picture here

00:54:02.780 --> 00:54:02.790
the foreground like this picture here
 

00:54:02.790 --> 00:54:05.090
the foreground like this picture here
that's very much like measurement in

00:54:05.090 --> 00:54:05.100
that's very much like measurement in
 

00:54:05.100 --> 00:54:08.300
that's very much like measurement in
quantum mechanics even though the in the

00:54:08.300 --> 00:54:08.310
quantum mechanics even though the in the
 

00:54:08.310 --> 00:54:11.150
quantum mechanics even though the in the
in the superposition state the Box has

00:54:11.150 --> 00:54:11.160
in the superposition state the Box has
 

00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:13.520
in the superposition state the Box has
both properties when we measure

00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:13.530
both properties when we measure
 

00:54:13.530 --> 00:54:16.340
both properties when we measure
one feature will will come out and

00:54:16.340 --> 00:54:16.350
one feature will will come out and
 

00:54:16.350 --> 00:54:18.650
one feature will will come out and
that's very much like measurements in

00:54:18.650 --> 00:54:18.660
that's very much like measurements in
 

00:54:18.660 --> 00:54:22.010
that's very much like measurements in
quantum mechanics and then we talk about

00:54:22.010 --> 00:54:22.020
quantum mechanics and then we talk about
 

00:54:22.020 --> 00:54:25.850
quantum mechanics and then we talk about
entanglement in our system then so if

00:54:25.850 --> 00:54:25.860
entanglement in our system then so if
 

00:54:25.860 --> 00:54:28.190
entanglement in our system then so if
you'll at least opened a suggestion here

00:54:28.190 --> 00:54:28.200
you'll at least opened a suggestion here
 

00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:31.160
you'll at least opened a suggestion here
the idea is if you have two boxes like

00:54:31.160 --> 00:54:31.170
the idea is if you have two boxes like
 

00:54:31.170 --> 00:54:34.130
the idea is if you have two boxes like
this at least for me I tend to see if I

00:54:34.130 --> 00:54:34.140
this at least for me I tend to see if I
 

00:54:34.140 --> 00:54:36.410
this at least for me I tend to see if I
see this this surface being the

00:54:36.410 --> 00:54:36.420
see this this surface being the
 

00:54:36.420 --> 00:54:38.450
see this this surface being the
foreground like down here I tend to see

00:54:38.450 --> 00:54:38.460
foreground like down here I tend to see
 

00:54:38.460 --> 00:54:40.580
foreground like down here I tend to see
the other surface also be in the

00:54:40.580 --> 00:54:40.590
the other surface also be in the
 

00:54:40.590 --> 00:54:43.490
the other surface also be in the
foreground and so when we measure these

00:54:43.490 --> 00:54:43.500
foreground and so when we measure these
 

00:54:43.500 --> 00:54:45.500
foreground and so when we measure these
entangled system there's a there's a

00:54:45.500 --> 00:54:45.510
entangled system there's a there's a
 

00:54:45.510 --> 00:54:47.780
entangled system there's a there's a
correlation so in this example here when

00:54:47.780 --> 00:54:47.790
correlation so in this example here when
 

00:54:47.790 --> 00:54:50.450
correlation so in this example here when
if we measure this surface to be in the

00:54:50.450 --> 00:54:50.460
if we measure this surface to be in the
 

00:54:50.460 --> 00:54:52.250
if we measure this surface to be in the
in the foreground then we tend to see

00:54:52.250 --> 00:54:52.260
in the foreground then we tend to see
 

00:54:52.260 --> 00:54:54.470
in the foreground then we tend to see
this surface also be in the in the

00:54:54.470 --> 00:54:54.480
this surface also be in the in the
 

00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:57.770
this surface also be in the in the
foreground and so this this analogy it

00:54:57.770 --> 00:54:57.780
foreground and so this this analogy it
 

00:54:57.780 --> 00:55:01.570
foreground and so this this analogy it
kind of explains this idea of this

00:55:01.570 --> 00:55:01.580
kind of explains this idea of this
 

00:55:01.580 --> 00:55:03.920
kind of explains this idea of this
entangled superposition and just coming

00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:03.930
entangled superposition and just coming
 

00:55:03.930 --> 00:55:07.760
entangled superposition and just coming
back briefly to two Schrodinger's cat if

00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:07.770
back briefly to two Schrodinger's cat if
 

00:55:07.770 --> 00:55:11.000
back briefly to two Schrodinger's cat if
we to show the entanglement we call this

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:11.010
we to show the entanglement we call this
 

00:55:11.010 --> 00:55:14.810
we to show the entanglement we call this
an entangled state where the the we have

00:55:14.810 --> 00:55:14.820
an entangled state where the the we have
 

00:55:14.820 --> 00:55:17.180
an entangled state where the the we have
this correlation of the particle not

00:55:17.180 --> 00:55:17.190
this correlation of the particle not
 

00:55:17.190 --> 00:55:19.460
this correlation of the particle not
decayed and the cat alive and the

00:55:19.460 --> 00:55:19.470
decayed and the cat alive and the
 

00:55:19.470 --> 00:55:22.130
decayed and the cat alive and the
particle decayed and they can't bed and

00:55:22.130 --> 00:55:22.140
particle decayed and they can't bed and
 

00:55:22.140 --> 00:55:25.010
particle decayed and they can't bed and
those so if we see the particle when we

00:55:25.010 --> 00:55:25.020
those so if we see the particle when we
 

00:55:25.020 --> 00:55:27.590
those so if we see the particle when we
do the measurement and undecayed then

00:55:27.590 --> 00:55:27.600
do the measurement and undecayed then
 

00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:31.340
do the measurement and undecayed then
the cat is alive and so on so well

00:55:31.340 --> 00:55:31.350
the cat is alive and so on so well
 

00:55:31.350 --> 00:55:34.040
the cat is alive and so on so well
anyways of course as I say shorting was

00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:34.050
anyways of course as I say shorting was
 

00:55:34.050 --> 00:55:36.950
anyways of course as I say shorting was
bothered by this and this consequence of

00:55:36.950 --> 00:55:36.960
bothered by this and this consequence of
 

00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:39.620
bothered by this and this consequence of
the theory and and he really struggled

00:55:39.620 --> 00:55:39.630
the theory and and he really struggled
 

00:55:39.630 --> 00:55:41.540
the theory and and he really struggled
it was this you know throughout his

00:55:41.540 --> 00:55:41.550
it was this you know throughout his
 

00:55:41.550 --> 00:55:44.930
it was this you know throughout his
career and so at one point he may be

00:55:44.930 --> 00:55:44.940
career and so at one point he may be
 

00:55:44.940 --> 00:55:48.140
career and so at one point he may be
maybe out of frustration he said well

00:55:48.140 --> 00:55:48.150
maybe out of frustration he said well
 

00:55:48.150 --> 00:55:50.630
maybe out of frustration he said well
look at we you know we tent we cook up

00:55:50.630 --> 00:55:50.640
look at we you know we tent we cook up
 

00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:53.240
look at we you know we tent we cook up
these situations with simple systems

00:55:53.240 --> 00:55:53.250
these situations with simple systems
 

00:55:53.250 --> 00:55:56.480
these situations with simple systems
like atoms and but maybe that's maybe

00:55:56.480 --> 00:55:56.490
like atoms and but maybe that's maybe
 

00:55:56.490 --> 00:55:58.520
like atoms and but maybe that's maybe
that leads us down the wrong path and

00:55:58.520 --> 00:55:58.530
that leads us down the wrong path and
 

00:55:58.530 --> 00:56:01.190
that leads us down the wrong path and
the way he said this is it so one way

00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:01.200
the way he said this is it so one way
 

00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:02.810
the way he said this is it so one way
out of that according to him was that

00:56:02.810 --> 00:56:02.820
out of that according to him was that
 

00:56:02.820 --> 00:56:05.060
out of that according to him was that
you know we we can cook up these

00:56:05.060 --> 00:56:05.070
you know we we can cook up these
 

00:56:05.070 --> 00:56:07.520
you know we we can cook up these
so-called thought experiments but that's

00:56:07.520 --> 00:56:07.530
so-called thought experiments but that's
 

00:56:07.530 --> 00:56:09.680
so-called thought experiments but that's
going to lead to trouble and a and and

00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:09.690
going to lead to trouble and a and and
 

00:56:09.690 --> 00:56:12.109
going to lead to trouble and a and and
and in fact we can never deal with

00:56:12.109 --> 00:56:12.119
and in fact we can never deal with
 

00:56:12.119 --> 00:56:16.250
and in fact we can never deal with
single atoms or molecules and so and at

00:56:16.250 --> 00:56:16.260
single atoms or molecules and so and at
 

00:56:16.260 --> 00:56:18.440
single atoms or molecules and so and at
least are these ridiculous consequences

00:56:18.440 --> 00:56:18.450
least are these ridiculous consequences
 

00:56:18.450 --> 00:56:20.990
least are these ridiculous consequences
like Schrodinger's cat well in fact we

00:56:20.990 --> 00:56:21.000
like Schrodinger's cat well in fact we
 

00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:22.440
like Schrodinger's cat well in fact we
now know that

00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:22.450
now know that
 

00:56:22.450 --> 00:56:27.089
now know that
that we can enter this world and but we

00:56:27.089 --> 00:56:27.099
that we can enter this world and but we
 

00:56:27.099 --> 00:56:29.460
that we can enter this world and but we
so far we can only do it on very small

00:56:29.460 --> 00:56:29.470
so far we can only do it on very small
 

00:56:29.470 --> 00:56:33.359
so far we can only do it on very small
systems but nevertheless I'll try to to

00:56:33.359 --> 00:56:33.369
systems but nevertheless I'll try to to
 

00:56:33.369 --> 00:56:35.790
systems but nevertheless I'll try to to
show you that they have all the features

00:56:35.790 --> 00:56:35.800
show you that they have all the features
 

00:56:35.800 --> 00:56:39.030
show you that they have all the features
of Schrodinger's cat and to get to this

00:56:39.030 --> 00:56:39.040
of Schrodinger's cat and to get to this
 

00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:42.540
of Schrodinger's cat and to get to this
point what we need is we first of all we

00:56:42.540 --> 00:56:42.550
point what we need is we first of all we
 

00:56:42.550 --> 00:56:44.760
point what we need is we first of all we
need precise control of these systems

00:56:44.760 --> 00:56:44.770
need precise control of these systems
 

00:56:44.770 --> 00:56:48.829
need precise control of these systems
and lasers and computers and so on that

00:56:48.829 --> 00:56:48.839
and lasers and computers and so on that
 

00:56:48.839 --> 00:56:51.599
and lasers and computers and so on that
helped us to do that we also need to

00:56:51.599 --> 00:56:51.609
helped us to do that we also need to
 

00:56:51.609 --> 00:56:55.440
helped us to do that we also need to
isolate our small simple systems from

00:56:55.440 --> 00:56:55.450
isolate our small simple systems from
 

00:56:55.450 --> 00:56:57.630
isolate our small simple systems from
the environment so that these

00:56:57.630 --> 00:56:57.640
the environment so that these
 

00:56:57.640 --> 00:56:59.970
the environment so that these
superpositions aren't aren't disturbed

00:56:59.970 --> 00:56:59.980
superpositions aren't aren't disturbed
 

00:56:59.980 --> 00:57:03.569
superpositions aren't aren't disturbed
and so the target is here - at least to

00:57:03.569 --> 00:57:03.579
and so the target is here - at least to
 

00:57:03.579 --> 00:57:05.370
and so the target is here - at least to
start to see some of these of X's that

00:57:05.370 --> 00:57:05.380
start to see some of these of X's that
 

00:57:05.380 --> 00:57:07.740
start to see some of these of X's that
precise control and being able to

00:57:07.740 --> 00:57:07.750
precise control and being able to
 

00:57:07.750 --> 00:57:11.040
precise control and being able to
control small numbers of particles so

00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:11.050
control small numbers of particles so
 

00:57:11.050 --> 00:57:15.300
control small numbers of particles so
I'm gonna I'm gonna take a sort of a

00:57:15.300 --> 00:57:15.310
I'm gonna I'm gonna take a sort of a
 

00:57:15.310 --> 00:57:17.940
I'm gonna I'm gonna take a sort of a
personal view through this I think

00:57:17.940 --> 00:57:17.950
personal view through this I think
 

00:57:17.950 --> 00:57:20.760
personal view through this I think
basically what's nice for me and the way

00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:20.770
basically what's nice for me and the way
 

00:57:20.770 --> 00:57:23.910
basically what's nice for me and the way
the citation read for the award is it

00:57:23.910 --> 00:57:23.920
the citation read for the award is it
 

00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:27.030
the citation read for the award is it
basically everything in my career led up

00:57:27.030 --> 00:57:27.040
basically everything in my career led up
 

00:57:27.040 --> 00:57:29.670
basically everything in my career led up
to the to the kind of things we're doing

00:57:29.670 --> 00:57:29.680
to the to the kind of things we're doing
 

00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:32.099
to the to the kind of things we're doing
now so it'll be a little bit of a

00:57:32.099 --> 00:57:32.109
now so it'll be a little bit of a
 

00:57:32.109 --> 00:57:33.990
now so it'll be a little bit of a
personal story but of course again

00:57:33.990 --> 00:57:34.000
personal story but of course again
 

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:36.990
personal story but of course again
that's many other people involve this in

00:57:36.990 --> 00:57:37.000
that's many other people involve this in
 

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:39.359
that's many other people involve this in
this kind of work over the years so this

00:57:39.359 --> 00:57:39.369
this kind of work over the years so this
 

00:57:39.369 --> 00:57:42.569
this kind of work over the years so this
is a picture of Norman Ramsey's group I

00:57:42.569 --> 00:57:42.579
is a picture of Norman Ramsey's group I
 

00:57:42.579 --> 00:57:44.790
is a picture of Norman Ramsey's group I
was a graduate student and Ramsey's

00:57:44.790 --> 00:57:44.800
was a graduate student and Ramsey's
 

00:57:44.800 --> 00:57:47.400
was a graduate student and Ramsey's
group at the time he and dan kleppner

00:57:47.400 --> 00:57:47.410
group at the time he and dan kleppner
 

00:57:47.410 --> 00:57:50.460
group at the time he and dan kleppner
developed the hydrogen maser and many of

00:57:50.460 --> 00:57:50.470
developed the hydrogen maser and many of
 

00:57:50.470 --> 00:57:54.480
developed the hydrogen maser and many of
you know that Norman here was later part

00:57:54.480 --> 00:57:54.490
you know that Norman here was later part
 

00:57:54.490 --> 00:57:56.550
you know that Norman here was later part
of the citation for his Nobel Prize was

00:57:56.550 --> 00:57:56.560
of the citation for his Nobel Prize was
 

00:57:56.560 --> 00:57:58.200
of the citation for his Nobel Prize was
this development of the hydrogen maser

00:57:58.200 --> 00:57:58.210
this development of the hydrogen maser
 

00:57:58.210 --> 00:58:00.569
this development of the hydrogen maser
so that's that's me they're trying to

00:58:00.569 --> 00:58:00.579
so that's that's me they're trying to
 

00:58:00.579 --> 00:58:05.790
so that's that's me they're trying to
get close to the boss and so so my

00:58:05.790 --> 00:58:05.800
get close to the boss and so so my
 

00:58:05.800 --> 00:58:08.700
get close to the boss and so so my
thesis was to to make a deuterium

00:58:08.700 --> 00:58:08.710
thesis was to to make a deuterium
 

00:58:08.710 --> 00:58:10.800
thesis was to to make a deuterium
measure to measure its hyperfine

00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:10.810
measure to measure its hyperfine
 

00:58:10.810 --> 00:58:13.260
measure to measure its hyperfine
frequency and and one thing I always

00:58:13.260 --> 00:58:13.270
frequency and and one thing I always
 

00:58:13.270 --> 00:58:15.300
frequency and and one thing I always
muse over is the fact that I'm probably

00:58:15.300 --> 00:58:15.310
muse over is the fact that I'm probably
 

00:58:15.310 --> 00:58:18.480
muse over is the fact that I'm probably
the only person in the universe that has

00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:18.490
the only person in the universe that has
 

00:58:18.490 --> 00:58:21.980
the only person in the universe that has
that number memorized

00:58:21.980 --> 00:58:21.990
that number memorized
 

00:58:21.990 --> 00:58:24.320
that number memorized
so anyway that was a result of my thesis

00:58:24.320 --> 00:58:24.330
so anyway that was a result of my thesis
 

00:58:24.330 --> 00:58:28.310
so anyway that was a result of my thesis
but anyway this was good training in the

00:58:28.310 --> 00:58:28.320
but anyway this was good training in the
 

00:58:28.320 --> 00:58:31.670
but anyway this was good training in the
sense that to get these high Precision's

00:58:31.670 --> 00:58:31.680
sense that to get these high Precision's
 

00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:33.380
sense that to get these high Precision's
in these frequency measurements we have

00:58:33.380 --> 00:58:33.390
in these frequency measurements we have
 

00:58:33.390 --> 00:58:36.349
in these frequency measurements we have
to have very good control over the the

00:58:36.349 --> 00:58:36.359
to have very good control over the the
 

00:58:36.359 --> 00:58:38.420
to have very good control over the the
systems environment in this case the

00:58:38.420 --> 00:58:38.430
systems environment in this case the
 

00:58:38.430 --> 00:58:41.030
systems environment in this case the
hydrogen maser also this they won't go

00:58:41.030 --> 00:58:41.040
hydrogen maser also this they won't go
 

00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:43.400
hydrogen maser also this they won't go
much into this but when that when the

00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:43.410
much into this but when that when the
 

00:58:43.410 --> 00:58:45.230
much into this but when that when the
atoms are radiating they're in a

00:58:45.230 --> 00:58:45.240
atoms are radiating they're in a
 

00:58:45.240 --> 00:58:47.510
atoms are radiating they're in a
superposition state between the ground

00:58:47.510 --> 00:58:47.520
superposition state between the ground
 

00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:50.630
superposition state between the ground
and excited state and these these these

00:58:50.630 --> 00:58:50.640
and excited state and these these these
 

00:58:50.640 --> 00:58:52.790
and excited state and these these these
atoms in the maser would live on the

00:58:52.790 --> 00:58:52.800
atoms in the maser would live on the
 

00:58:52.800 --> 00:58:54.680
atoms in the maser would live on the
order of these super positions of the

00:58:54.680 --> 00:58:54.690
order of these super positions of the
 

00:58:54.690 --> 00:58:57.710

atoms in the in this in this Hydra and
this deuterium maser would last about a

00:58:59.599 --> 00:58:59.609
this deuterium maser would last about a
 

00:58:59.609 --> 00:59:02.180
this deuterium maser would last about a
second this was not at the single

00:59:02.180 --> 00:59:02.190
second this was not at the single
 

00:59:02.190 --> 00:59:04.220

particle level this was on an ensemble

00:59:04.220 --> 00:59:04.230
particle level this was on an ensemble
 

00:59:04.230 --> 00:59:07.550

getting my degree I went on to work with

00:59:14.930 --> 00:59:14.940
getting my degree I went on to work with
 

00:59:14.940 --> 00:59:18.589
getting my degree I went on to work with
on stay melt and that although he was

00:59:18.589 --> 00:59:18.599
on stay melt and that although he was
 

00:59:18.599 --> 00:59:22.670
on stay melt and that although he was
interested also in in atoms and in this

00:59:22.670 --> 00:59:22.680
interested also in in atoms and in this
 

00:59:22.680 --> 00:59:25.250
interested also in in atoms and in this
case charged atoms the focus of his work

00:59:25.250 --> 00:59:25.260
case charged atoms the focus of his work
 

00:59:25.260 --> 00:59:29.270
case charged atoms the focus of his work
then was to to deal do his experiments

00:59:29.270 --> 00:59:29.280
then was to to deal do his experiments
 

00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:32.270
then was to to deal do his experiments
on on electrons and during the time I

00:59:32.270 --> 00:59:32.280
on on electrons and during the time I
 

00:59:32.280 --> 00:59:34.460
on on electrons and during the time I
was there we developed techniques to

00:59:34.460 --> 00:59:34.470
was there we developed techniques to
 

00:59:34.470 --> 00:59:37.700
was there we developed techniques to
look at single electrons so a good

00:59:37.700 --> 00:59:37.710
look at single electrons so a good
 

00:59:37.710 --> 00:59:40.970
look at single electrons so a good

00:59:45.920 --> 00:59:45.930
electrons and you can think about them
 

00:59:45.930 --> 00:59:48.320

electrons in our in our atomic bowl and
 

01:00:58.269 --> 01:01:00.720
electrons in our in our atomic bowl and
we we drove it just at an amplitude

01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:00.730
we we drove it just at an amplitude
 

01:01:00.730 --> 01:01:03.059
we we drove it just at an amplitude
where occasionally one of the electrons

01:01:03.059 --> 01:01:03.069
where occasionally one of the electrons
 

01:01:03.069 --> 01:01:06.210
where occasionally one of the electrons
would fly out of the bowl go over the

01:01:06.210 --> 01:01:06.220
would fly out of the bowl go over the
 

01:01:06.220 --> 01:01:09.450
would fly out of the bowl go over the
edge and we'd see this this step process

01:01:09.450 --> 01:01:09.460
edge and we'd see this this step process
 

01:01:09.460 --> 01:01:12.150
edge and we'd see this this step process
and time and and and so we'd see the

01:01:12.150 --> 01:01:12.160
and time and and and so we'd see the
 

01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:13.920
and time and and and so we'd see the
individual electrons leave and we got

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:13.930
individual electrons leave and we got
 

01:01:13.930 --> 01:01:16.880
individual electrons leave and we got
down to this last step here that was the

01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:16.890
down to this last step here that was the
 

01:01:16.890 --> 01:01:20.700
down to this last step here that was the
identified a a single electron and then

01:01:20.700 --> 01:01:20.710
identified a a single electron and then
 

01:01:20.710 --> 01:01:22.230
identified a a single electron and then
we could go on and do measurements on

01:01:22.230 --> 01:01:22.240
we could go on and do measurements on
 

01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:24.990
we could go on and do measurements on
this single electron in a very briefly

01:01:24.990 --> 01:01:25.000
this single electron in a very briefly
 

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:29.039

so at the same time we were we were also

01:01:49.170 --> 01:01:49.180
so at the same time we were we were also
 

01:01:49.180 --> 01:01:53.609
so at the same time we were we were also
thinking about ideas about how atomic

back to my graduate school work and and

01:01:59.400 --> 01:01:59.410
back to my graduate school work and and
 

01:01:59.410 --> 01:02:01.470
back to my graduate school work and and
there was one of the things we would

01:02:01.470 --> 01:02:01.480
there was one of the things we would
 

01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:04.259
there was one of the things we would
would like to do is to reduce the

01:02:04.259 --> 01:02:04.269
would like to do is to reduce the
 

01:02:04.269 --> 01:02:06.960
would like to do is to reduce the
temperature of the of the atoms in our

01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:06.970
temperature of the of the atoms in our
 

01:02:06.970 --> 01:02:09.150
temperature of the of the atoms in our
case the ions and so we had some ideas

01:02:09.150 --> 01:02:09.160
case the ions and so we had some ideas
 

01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:11.160
case the ions and so we had some ideas
about laser cooling and at the same time

01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:11.170
about laser cooling and at the same time
 

01:02:11.170 --> 01:02:12.269
about laser cooling and at the same time

start experiments that first to do the

01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:14.510
start experiments that first to do the
 

01:03:14.510 --> 01:03:18.100
start experiments that first to do the
laser cooling and then from then on

01:03:18.100 --> 01:03:18.110
laser cooling and then from then on
 

01:03:18.110 --> 01:03:22.090

apply that today to atomic clocks and so

01:03:22.090 --> 01:03:22.100
apply that today to atomic clocks and so
 

01:03:22.100 --> 01:03:23.440
apply that today to atomic clocks and so
that was really the start of this

01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:23.450
that was really the start of this
 

01:03:23.450 --> 01:03:28.510
that was really the start of this
business and in my career at NBS and

01:03:28.510 --> 01:03:28.520
business and in my career at NBS and
 

01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:33.220
business and in my career at NBS and
anyway so we did some experiments and at

01:03:33.220 --> 01:03:33.230
anyway so we did some experiments and at
 

01:03:33.230 --> 01:03:34.570
anyway so we did some experiments and at
the same time

01:03:34.570 --> 01:03:34.580
the same time
 

01:03:34.580 --> 01:03:37.930
the same time
Peter Toshack's groups was doing some

01:03:37.930 --> 01:03:37.940
Peter Toshack's groups was doing some
 

01:03:37.940 --> 01:03:40.060
Peter Toshack's groups was doing some
experiments and actually hunts demos and

01:03:40.060 --> 01:03:40.070
experiments and actually hunts demos and
 

01:03:40.070 --> 01:03:42.490
experiments and actually hunts demos and
joined them on this and what's kind of

01:03:42.490 --> 01:03:42.500
joined them on this and what's kind of
 

01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:44.470
joined them on this and what's kind of
interesting you notice of the dates of

01:03:44.470 --> 01:03:44.480
interesting you notice of the dates of
 

01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:46.780
interesting you notice of the dates of
publication are very close together we

01:03:46.780 --> 01:03:46.790
publication are very close together we
 

01:03:46.790 --> 01:03:50.200
publication are very close together we
were a little early earlier than the our

01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:50.210
were a little early earlier than the our
 

01:03:50.210 --> 01:03:51.880
were a little early earlier than the our
paper was published a little earlier

01:03:51.880 --> 01:03:51.890
paper was published a little earlier
 

01:03:51.890 --> 01:03:54.400
paper was published a little earlier
than that of Peter Toshack's group but

01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:54.410
than that of Peter Toshack's group but
 

01:03:54.410 --> 01:03:58.530
than that of Peter Toshack's group but
to be fair you see that they actually

01:03:58.530 --> 01:03:58.540
to be fair you see that they actually
 

01:03:58.540 --> 01:04:03.040
to be fair you see that they actually
submitted their paper a day a day early

01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:03.050
submitted their paper a day a day early
 

01:04:03.050 --> 01:04:05.770
submitted their paper a day a day early
so I guess you'd have to say there they

01:04:05.770 --> 01:04:05.780
so I guess you'd have to say there they
 

01:04:05.780 --> 01:04:10.810
so I guess you'd have to say there they
were the first and so one thing is

01:04:10.810 --> 01:04:10.820
were the first and so one thing is
 

01:04:10.820 --> 01:04:13.930
were the first and so one thing is
interesting about this is I think I knew

01:04:13.930 --> 01:04:13.940
interesting about this is I think I knew
 

01:04:13.940 --> 01:04:16.540
interesting about this is I think I knew
because that they were working on this

01:04:16.540 --> 01:04:16.550
because that they were working on this
 

01:04:16.550 --> 01:04:18.760
because that they were working on this
because I knew Hans DeMuth had gone to

01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:18.770
because I knew Hans DeMuth had gone to
 

01:04:18.770 --> 01:04:21.790
because I knew Hans DeMuth had gone to
spend a sabbatical and in that group I

01:04:21.790 --> 01:04:21.800
spend a sabbatical and in that group I
 

01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:23.890
spend a sabbatical and in that group I
don't think they knew we were working on

01:04:23.890 --> 01:04:23.900
don't think they knew we were working on
 

01:04:23.900 --> 01:04:25.690
don't think they knew we were working on
so it was really a kind of an amazing

01:04:25.690 --> 01:04:25.700
so it was really a kind of an amazing
 

01:04:25.700 --> 01:04:28.300
so it was really a kind of an amazing
coincidence that that this work was

01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:28.310
coincidence that that this work was
 

01:04:28.310 --> 01:04:30.430
coincidence that that this work was
submitted within a day

01:04:30.430 --> 01:04:30.440
submitted within a day
 

01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:33.549
submitted within a day
of each other anyway are in this in the

01:04:33.549 --> 01:04:33.559
of each other anyway are in this in the
 

01:04:33.559 --> 01:04:36.789
of each other anyway are in this in the
experiment that in Peter Tosh X group

01:04:36.789 --> 01:04:36.799
experiment that in Peter Tosh X group
 

01:04:36.799 --> 01:04:39.549
experiment that in Peter Tosh X group
the the evidence for for cooling was

01:04:39.549 --> 01:04:39.559
the the evidence for for cooling was
 

01:04:39.559 --> 01:04:42.490
the the evidence for for cooling was
that they were able to hold the ions

01:04:42.490 --> 01:04:42.500
that they were able to hold the ions
 

01:04:42.500 --> 01:04:45.370
that they were able to hold the ions
into the trap for much longer time based

01:04:45.370 --> 01:04:45.380
into the trap for much longer time based
 

01:04:45.380 --> 01:04:47.740
into the trap for much longer time based
on the techniques I had learned I told

01:04:47.740 --> 01:04:47.750
on the techniques I had learned I told
 

01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:50.049
on the techniques I had learned I told
you about the induced currents that we

01:04:50.049 --> 01:04:50.059
you about the induced currents that we
 

01:04:50.059 --> 01:04:52.029
you about the induced currents that we
could measure of electrons in this case

01:04:52.029 --> 01:04:52.039
could measure of electrons in this case
 

01:04:52.039 --> 01:04:54.490
could measure of electrons in this case
we just looked at the thermal currents

01:04:54.490 --> 01:04:54.500
we just looked at the thermal currents
 

01:04:54.500 --> 01:04:57.160
we just looked at the thermal currents
of the of the ions in the trap and we

01:04:57.160 --> 01:04:57.170
of the of the ions in the trap and we
 

01:04:57.170 --> 01:04:59.349
of the of the ions in the trap and we
could if we turn the laser on we could

01:04:59.349 --> 01:04:59.359
could if we turn the laser on we could
 

01:04:59.359 --> 01:05:01.750
could if we turn the laser on we could
see the temperature go go down which was

01:05:01.750 --> 01:05:01.760
see the temperature go go down which was
 

01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:04.000
see the temperature go go down which was
just a measure of these and measured by

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:04.010
just a measure of these and measured by
 

01:05:04.010 --> 01:05:06.670
just a measure of these and measured by
these induced currents and we could see

01:05:06.670 --> 01:05:06.680
these induced currents and we could see
 

01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:10.359
these induced currents and we could see
the cooling effect in that way so this

01:05:10.359 --> 01:05:10.369
the cooling effect in that way so this
 

01:05:10.369 --> 01:05:16.240
the cooling effect in that way so this
was this was the R group in 79 not not

01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:16.250
was this was the R group in 79 not not
 

01:05:16.250 --> 01:05:18.190
was this was the R group in 79 not not
very long after these first laser

01:05:18.190 --> 01:05:18.200
very long after these first laser
 

01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:22.240
very long after these first laser
cooling measurements and that the the

01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:22.250
cooling measurements and that the the
 

01:05:22.250 --> 01:05:23.980

embarrassing part I think at least for

01:05:23.980 --> 01:05:23.990
embarrassing part I think at least for
 

01:05:23.990 --> 01:05:29.500

also here we we suffered from the
 

01:05:44.990 --> 01:05:49.390
also here we we suffered from the
ravages of time I would say so anyway

01:05:49.390 --> 01:05:49.400
ravages of time I would say so anyway
 

01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:54.400

one of the goals was certainly at NBS
NIST was to try to apply these these

01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:04.670
NIST was to try to apply these these
 

01:06:04.670 --> 01:06:06.819
NIST was to try to apply these these
cooled ions for frequency standards the

01:06:06.819 --> 01:06:06.829
cooled ions for frequency standards the
 

01:06:06.829 --> 01:06:10.359
cooled ions for frequency standards the
reason that's important is that is that

01:06:10.359 --> 01:06:10.369
reason that's important is that is that
 

01:06:10.369 --> 01:06:12.099
reason that's important is that is that
we want to reduce what are called

01:06:12.099 --> 01:06:12.109
we want to reduce what are called
 

01:06:12.109 --> 01:06:14.440
we want to reduce what are called
Doppler shifts and what I'm one of the

01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:14.450
Doppler shifts and what I'm one of the
 

01:06:14.450 --> 01:06:16.720
Doppler shifts and what I'm one of the
more interesting Doppler shifts is the

01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:16.730
more interesting Doppler shifts is the
 

01:06:16.730 --> 01:06:19.660
more interesting Doppler shifts is the
so called time dilation shift this comes

01:06:19.660 --> 01:06:19.670
so called time dilation shift this comes
 

01:06:19.670 --> 01:06:22.269
so called time dilation shift this comes
from nine Stein's here relativity if the

trap we call it then the time runs

01:06:28.779 --> 01:06:28.789
trap we call it then the time runs
 

01:06:28.789 --> 01:06:30.970
trap we call it then the time runs
slower for them this is the basis of

01:06:30.970 --> 01:06:30.980
slower for them this is the basis of

slower for them this is the basis of
Einstein's twins paradox and so the the

01:06:34.210 --> 01:06:34.220
Einstein's twins paradox and so the the
 

01:06:34.220 --> 01:06:35.950
Einstein's twins paradox and so the the
laser cooling would be very important

01:06:35.950 --> 01:06:35.960
laser cooling would be very important
 

01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:39.190
laser cooling would be very important
for that to reduce this this this type

01:06:39.190 --> 01:06:39.200
for that to reduce this this this type
 

01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:41.609
for that to reduce this this this type
this rate of time

01:06:41.609 --> 01:06:41.619

this rate of time
shift and so that was the importance

01:06:43.319 --> 01:06:43.329
shift and so that was the importance
 

01:06:43.329 --> 01:06:45.569
shift and so that was the importance
there but nevertheless we also wanted to

01:06:45.569 --> 01:06:45.579
there but nevertheless we also wanted to
 

01:06:45.579 --> 01:06:47.670
there but nevertheless we also wanted to
think about getting the number of atoms

01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:47.680
think about getting the number of atoms
 

01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:49.200
think about getting the number of atoms
we're reusing the clock to very small

01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:49.210
we're reusing the clock to very small
 

01:06:49.210 --> 01:06:50.970
we're reusing the clock to very small
numbers and the reason for that is just

01:06:50.970 --> 01:06:50.980
numbers and the reason for that is just
 

01:06:50.980 --> 01:06:53.370
numbers and the reason for that is just
that we can control the environment a

01:06:53.370 --> 01:06:53.380
that we can control the environment a
 

01:06:53.380 --> 01:06:56.370
that we can control the environment a
much better first for single atoms or

01:06:56.370 --> 01:06:56.380
much better first for single atoms or
 

01:06:56.380 --> 01:06:59.579
much better first for single atoms or
ions than we can for a large ensemble so

01:06:59.579 --> 01:06:59.589
ions than we can for a large ensemble so
 

01:06:59.589 --> 01:07:03.150
ions than we can for a large ensemble so
in this in this with this that actually

01:07:03.150 --> 01:07:03.160
in this in this with this that actually

again in Peter Toshack's group and they
 

01:07:12.519 --> 01:07:14.870
again in Peter Toshack's group and they
actually miss made some pictures of

01:07:14.870 --> 01:07:14.880
actually miss made some pictures of

was a little bit later we also went back

01:07:20.549 --> 01:07:20.559
was a little bit later we also went back
 

01:07:20.559 --> 01:07:22.200
was a little bit later we also went back
to the same idea that I showed you with

01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:22.210
to the same idea that I showed you with
 

01:07:22.210 --> 01:07:24.410
to the same idea that I showed you with
electrons in this case we kicked

01:07:24.410 --> 01:07:24.420
electrons in this case we kicked
 

01:07:24.420 --> 01:07:28.019
electrons in this case we kicked
magnesium ions at one at a time by using

01:07:28.019 --> 01:07:28.029
magnesium ions at one at a time by using
 

01:07:28.029 --> 01:07:31.289
magnesium ions at one at a time by using
a chemical charge exchange process but

01:07:31.289 --> 01:07:31.299
a chemical charge exchange process but
 

01:07:31.299 --> 01:07:36.239
a chemical charge exchange process but
we can we could identify the the ions at

01:07:36.239 --> 01:07:36.249
we can we could identify the the ions at
 

01:07:36.249 --> 01:07:39.150
we can we could identify the the ions at
the at the single ion level you see here

01:07:39.150 --> 01:07:39.160
the at the single ion level you see here
 

01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:41.549
the at the single ion level you see here
the same the last step in this picture

01:07:41.549 --> 01:07:41.559
the same the last step in this picture
 

01:07:41.559 --> 01:07:44.059
the same the last step in this picture
indicated and when we had a single ion

01:07:44.059 --> 01:07:44.069
indicated and when we had a single ion
 

01:07:44.069 --> 01:07:48.630
indicated and when we had a single ion
so anyway we we carried on have carried

01:07:48.630 --> 01:07:48.640
so anyway we we carried on have carried
 

01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:51.559
so anyway we we carried on have carried
on with these experiments after that and

01:07:51.559 --> 01:07:51.569
on with these experiments after that and
 

01:07:51.569 --> 01:07:54.749
on with these experiments after that and
the idea again and this is in the

01:07:54.749 --> 01:07:54.759
the idea again and this is in the
 

01:07:54.759 --> 01:07:58.049
the idea again and this is in the
context of clocks one of our favorite

01:07:58.049 --> 01:07:58.059
context of clocks one of our favorite
 

01:07:58.059 --> 01:08:00.569

choices was mercury it had two
 

01:08:00.579 --> 01:08:03.239
choices was mercury it had two
transitions one in the microwave region

01:08:03.239 --> 01:08:03.249
transitions one in the microwave region
 

01:08:03.249 --> 01:08:05.430
transitions one in the microwave region
and also one in the optical region that

01:08:05.430 --> 01:08:05.440
and also one in the optical region that
 

01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:09.259
and also one in the optical region that
might potentially be used for clocks so

01:08:09.259 --> 01:08:09.269
might potentially be used for clocks so
 

01:08:09.269 --> 01:08:11.609
might potentially be used for clocks so
schematically what we had is a this

other things down here we call in caps
anyway that the the idea was that if

01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:23.290
anyway that the the idea was that if

anyway that the the idea was that if
what I show here is an energy diagram

what I show here is an energy diagram
 

01:08:25.569 --> 01:08:28.800
what I show here is an energy diagram
and we if we tune a laser beam such of

01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:28.810
and we if we tune a laser beam such of

this radiation connects this lower level
 

01:08:31.569 --> 01:08:34.559
this radiation connects this lower level
to this excited level then the atoms can

01:08:34.559 --> 01:08:34.569
to this excited level then the atoms can
 

01:08:34.569 --> 01:08:37.709
to this excited level then the atoms can
scatter photons and if we tuned the

01:08:37.709 --> 01:08:37.719

laser cooling process relies on tuning

01:08:40.229 --> 01:08:40.239
laser cooling process relies on tuning
 

01:08:40.239 --> 01:08:43.320
laser cooling process relies on tuning
this laser slightly below the resonance

01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:43.330
this laser slightly below the resonance
 

01:08:43.330 --> 01:08:46.530

frequency of this transition the thing

01:08:46.530 --> 01:08:46.540

that made this hard was that this this

this is where Jim burkas was key to it

01:08:58.720 --> 01:08:58.730
this is where Jim burkas was key to it

this is where Jim burkas was key to it
to these to this work because he was the

to these to this work because he was the
he's the laser expert and continues to

he's the laser expert and continues to
 

01:09:03.859 --> 01:09:07.390
he's the laser expert and continues to
be the laser expert in our group so the

01:09:07.390 --> 01:09:07.400
be the laser expert in our group so the
 

01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:09.309
be the laser expert in our group so the
idea of a clock the way we could make a

01:09:09.309 --> 01:09:09.319
idea of a clock the way we could make a
 

01:09:09.319 --> 01:09:11.880
idea of a clock the way we could make a
clock on this there's another transition

01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:11.890
clock on this there's another transition
 

01:09:11.890 --> 01:09:15.880
clock on this there's another transition
in mercury and this one is the feature

01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:15.890
in mercury and this one is the feature
 

01:09:15.890 --> 01:09:20.760
in mercury and this one is the feature
that it's it has a much much narrower

01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:20.770
that it's it has a much much narrower
 

01:09:20.770 --> 01:09:23.200
that it's it has a much much narrower
range of frequencies over which it

01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:23.210
range of frequencies over which it
 

01:09:23.210 --> 01:09:24.670
range of frequencies over which it
absorbs and so we can get higher

01:09:24.670 --> 01:09:24.680
absorbs and so we can get higher
 

01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:27.160
absorbs and so we can get higher
precision on the frequency of the laser

01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:27.170
precision on the frequency of the laser
 

01:09:27.170 --> 01:09:30.430
precision on the frequency of the laser
when we make this this transition one

01:09:30.430 --> 01:09:30.440
when we make this this transition one
 

01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:31.870
when we make this this transition one
interesting thing is that we can use

01:09:31.870 --> 01:09:31.880
interesting thing is that we can use
 

01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:34.510
interesting thing is that we can use
this this transition that we use for the

01:14:05.580 --> 01:14:08.420
we hit the transition then the scatter
the probability of the of seeing the

01:14:08.420 --> 01:14:08.430
the probability of the of seeing the
 

01:14:08.430 --> 01:14:10.130
the probability of the of seeing the
scattered light goes down and which is

01:14:10.130 --> 01:14:10.140
scattered light goes down and which is
 

01:14:10.140 --> 01:14:12.530
scattered light goes down and which is
why these you see these dips here we can

01:14:12.530 --> 01:14:12.540
why these you see these dips here we can
 

01:14:12.540 --> 01:14:17.600
why these you see these dips here we can
also tune the laser so that when we if

01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:17.610
also tune the laser so that when we if
 

01:14:17.610 --> 01:14:20.120
also tune the laser so that when we if
we start in this say this in equal to

01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:20.130
we start in this say this in equal to
 

01:14:20.130 --> 01:14:22.670
we start in this say this in equal to
level we can we can change the

01:14:22.670 --> 01:14:22.680
level we can we can change the
 

01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:24.740
level we can we can change the
electronic level and also increase the

01:14:24.740 --> 01:14:24.750
electronic level and also increase the
 

01:14:24.750 --> 01:14:27.770
electronic level and also increase the
motional quantum level by one which is

01:14:27.770 --> 01:14:27.780
motional quantum level by one which is
 

01:14:27.780 --> 01:14:30.980
motional quantum level by one which is
indicated by that feature there we can

01:14:30.980 --> 01:14:30.990
indicated by that feature there we can
 

01:14:30.990 --> 01:14:34.360
indicated by that feature there we can
also do the other side and and if we go

01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:34.370
also do the other side and and if we go
 

01:14:34.370 --> 01:14:37.790
also do the other side and and if we go
drive the electronic transition and also

01:14:37.790 --> 01:14:37.800
drive the electronic transition and also
 

01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:41.240
drive the electronic transition and also
decrease the emotional state by one way

01:14:41.240 --> 01:14:41.250
decrease the emotional state by one way
 

01:14:41.250 --> 01:14:43.610
decrease the emotional state by one way
that's indicated by that picture there

01:14:43.610 --> 01:14:43.620
that's indicated by that picture there
 

01:14:43.620 --> 01:14:46.430
that's indicated by that picture there
so anyway we could start to see these

01:14:46.430 --> 01:14:46.440
so anyway we could start to see these
 

01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:49.820
so anyway we could start to see these
kind of quantum features in the motion

01:14:49.820 --> 01:14:49.830
kind of quantum features in the motion
 

01:14:49.830 --> 01:14:52.400
kind of quantum features in the motion
and one interesting thing we could we

01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:52.410
and one interesting thing we could we
 

01:14:52.410 --> 01:14:54.830
and one interesting thing we could we
could use this this so-called these

01:14:54.830 --> 01:14:54.840
could use this this so-called these
 

01:14:54.840 --> 01:14:58.430
could use this this so-called these
sideband features the to do a further

01:14:58.430 --> 01:14:58.440
sideband features the to do a further
 

01:14:58.440 --> 01:15:01.280
sideband features the to do a further
kind of cooling in this case first of

01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:01.290
kind of cooling in this case first of
 

01:15:01.290 --> 01:15:04.570
kind of cooling in this case first of
all the conditions were such that if

01:15:04.570 --> 01:15:04.580
all the conditions were such that if
 

01:15:04.580 --> 01:15:08.090
all the conditions were such that if
after the atom was excited to this upper

01:15:08.090 --> 01:15:08.100
after the atom was excited to this upper
 

01:15:08.100 --> 01:15:11.330
after the atom was excited to this upper
a manifold of states when it decayed the

01:15:11.330 --> 01:15:11.340
a manifold of states when it decayed the
 

01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:13.640
a manifold of states when it decayed the
conditions were such that it would decay

01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:13.650
conditions were such that it would decay
 

01:15:13.650 --> 01:15:16.220
conditions were such that it would decay
back down without changing its quantum

01:15:16.220 --> 01:15:16.230
back down without changing its quantum
 

01:15:16.230 --> 01:15:18.290
back down without changing its quantum
number so the idea of this further

01:15:18.290 --> 01:15:18.300
number so the idea of this further
 

01:15:18.300 --> 01:15:21.860
number so the idea of this further
cooling was that we would we would we

01:15:21.860 --> 01:15:21.870
cooling was that we would we would we
 

01:15:21.870 --> 01:15:24.530
cooling was that we would we would we
would excite on this this so-called red

01:15:24.530 --> 01:15:24.540
would excite on this this so-called red
 

01:15:24.540 --> 01:15:27.140
would excite on this this so-called red
sideband the lower frequency transition

01:15:27.140 --> 01:15:27.150
sideband the lower frequency transition
 

01:15:27.150 --> 01:15:30.080
sideband the lower frequency transition
so if we if we started here we would

01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:30.090
so if we if we started here we would
 

01:15:30.090 --> 01:15:31.590
so if we if we started here we would
decrease the

01:15:31.590 --> 01:15:31.600
decrease the
 

01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:33.660
decrease the
the motional quantum number by one then

01:15:33.660 --> 01:15:33.670
the motional quantum number by one then
 

01:15:33.670 --> 01:15:37.770
the motional quantum number by one then
we would let the atom decay and we would

01:15:37.770 --> 01:15:37.780
we would let the atom decay and we would
 

01:15:37.780 --> 01:15:40.590
we would let the atom decay and we would
repeat this process so that if we if

01:15:40.590 --> 01:15:40.600
repeat this process so that if we if
 

01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:42.690
repeat this process so that if we if
excited them there it would eventually

01:15:42.690 --> 01:15:42.700
excited them there it would eventually
 

01:15:42.700 --> 01:15:44.850
excited them there it would eventually
come down to that level and the

01:15:44.850 --> 01:15:44.860
come down to that level and the
 

01:15:44.860 --> 01:15:47.220
come down to that level and the
interesting thing of course is that when

01:15:47.220 --> 01:15:47.230
interesting thing of course is that when
 

01:15:47.230 --> 01:15:49.170
interesting thing of course is that when
we get down to this lower level then

01:15:49.170 --> 01:15:49.180
we get down to this lower level then
 

01:15:49.180 --> 01:15:54.060
we get down to this lower level then
there's no excited energy level motional

01:15:54.060 --> 01:15:54.070
there's no excited energy level motional
 

01:15:54.070 --> 01:15:56.820
there's no excited energy level motional
energy level for this for the atom to go

01:15:56.820 --> 01:15:56.830
energy level for this for the atom to go
 

01:15:56.830 --> 01:15:59.280
energy level for this for the atom to go
to those so the scattering stops and the

01:15:59.280 --> 01:15:59.290
to those so the scattering stops and the
 

01:15:59.290 --> 01:16:01.950
to those so the scattering stops and the
way and that was then an indication what

01:16:01.950 --> 01:16:01.960
way and that was then an indication what
 

01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:04.340
way and that was then an indication what
you're seeing on this right-hand picture

01:16:04.340 --> 01:16:04.350
you're seeing on this right-hand picture
 

01:16:04.350 --> 01:16:08.070
you're seeing on this right-hand picture
that this feature here collapses down

01:16:08.070 --> 01:16:08.080
that this feature here collapses down
 

01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:09.930
that this feature here collapses down
into this this feature here and

01:16:09.930 --> 01:16:09.940
into this this feature here and
 

01:16:09.940 --> 01:16:12.060
into this this feature here and
similarly this one represents one here

01:16:12.060 --> 01:16:12.070
similarly this one represents one here
 

01:16:12.070 --> 01:16:14.190
similarly this one represents one here
and you can see a big asymmetry now in

01:16:14.190 --> 01:16:14.200
and you can see a big asymmetry now in
 

01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:16.470
and you can see a big asymmetry now in
the in these features and the fact that

01:16:16.470 --> 01:16:16.480
the in these features and the fact that
 

01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:19.050
the in these features and the fact that
this this will called the red sideband

01:16:19.050 --> 01:16:19.060
this this will called the red sideband
 

01:16:19.060 --> 01:16:21.240
this this will called the red sideband
is disappearing means we're

01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:21.250
is disappearing means we're
 

01:16:21.250 --> 01:16:23.550
is disappearing means we're
predominantly in this situation here

01:16:23.550 --> 01:16:23.560
predominantly in this situation here
 

01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:25.500
predominantly in this situation here
where we don't get any absorption and

01:16:25.500 --> 01:16:25.510
where we don't get any absorption and
 

01:16:25.510 --> 01:16:28.050
where we don't get any absorption and
the atom is then indicates the atoms in

01:16:28.050 --> 01:16:28.060
the atom is then indicates the atoms in
 

01:16:28.060 --> 01:16:32.250
the atom is then indicates the atoms in
its ground motional state as well well

01:16:32.250 --> 01:16:32.260
its ground motional state as well well
 

01:16:32.260 --> 01:16:34.140
its ground motional state as well well
anyways let me just come back a little

01:16:34.140 --> 01:16:34.150
anyways let me just come back a little
 

01:16:34.150 --> 01:16:37.680
anyways let me just come back a little
bit to the clocks that we got that with

01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:37.690
bit to the clocks that we got that with
 

01:16:37.690 --> 01:16:40.710
bit to the clocks that we got that with
the with the with the cooling and the

01:16:40.710 --> 01:16:40.720
the with the with the cooling and the
 

01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:43.620
the with the with the cooling and the
and trapping and laser cooling and

01:16:43.620 --> 01:16:43.630
and trapping and laser cooling and
 

01:16:43.630 --> 01:16:46.590
and trapping and laser cooling and
trapping we could we could reduce these

01:16:46.590 --> 01:16:46.600
trapping we could we could reduce these
 

01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:49.710
trapping we could we could reduce these
Doppler shifts and taking some other

of the cesium beam frequency standards
and nowadays we all think about optical

01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:18.250
and nowadays we all think about optical
 

01:17:18.250 --> 01:17:22.350

terms of high performance anyway so

01:17:24.650 --> 01:17:24.660
terms of high performance anyway so
 

01:17:24.660 --> 01:17:31.590

around 1995 these ideas of quantum
 

01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:34.370

then what we really set the field off

01:17:49.820 --> 01:17:49.830
then what we really set the field off
 

01:17:49.830 --> 01:17:53.180
then what we really set the field off
was that the Peter Shore computer

01:17:53.180 --> 01:17:53.190

serac they they they quickly jumped onto

01:18:54.230 --> 01:18:54.240
serac they they they quickly jumped onto
 

01:18:54.240 --> 01:18:58.100
serac they they they quickly jumped onto
this idea of quantum computing and they

01:18:58.100 --> 01:18:58.110
this idea of quantum computing and they
 

01:18:58.110 --> 01:19:01.040
this idea of quantum computing and they
came up with the first scheme for how

01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:01.050
came up with the first scheme for how
 

01:19:01.050 --> 01:19:03.410
came up with the first scheme for how
you might build a quantum computer and

01:19:03.410 --> 01:19:03.420
you might build a quantum computer and
 

01:19:03.420 --> 01:19:06.230
you might build a quantum computer and
it was based on ions so the idea is here

01:19:06.230 --> 01:19:06.240
it was based on ions so the idea is here
 

01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:08.150
it was based on ions so the idea is here
this is if this picture is distant

01:19:08.150 --> 01:19:08.160
this is if this picture is distant
 

01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:10.520
this is if this picture is distant
represent some sort of electrode

of like a pseudo molecule you can think

01:19:32.540 --> 01:19:32.550
of like a pseudo molecule you can think
 

01:19:32.550 --> 01:19:35.360
of like a pseudo molecule you can think
about the normal modes the vibrations of

01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:35.370
about the normal modes the vibrations of
 

01:19:35.370 --> 01:19:37.040
about the normal modes the vibrations of
the molecule and they all have different

01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:37.050
the molecule and they all have different
 

01:19:37.050 --> 01:19:38.690
the molecule and they all have different
frequencies in general so you can think

01:19:38.690 --> 01:19:38.700
frequencies in general so you can think
 

01:19:38.700 --> 01:19:41.240
frequencies in general so you can think
about the the ground and first excited

01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:41.250
about the the ground and first excited
 

01:19:41.250 --> 01:19:43.730
about the the ground and first excited

what we call a quantum bit in other

01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:49.530
what we call a quantum bit in other
 

01:19:49.530 --> 01:19:51.510
what we call a quantum bit in other
words a two-state system that were

01:19:51.510 --> 01:19:51.520
words a two-state system that were
 

01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:55.260

and that can represent information and

01:19:55.260 --> 01:19:55.270
and that can represent information and
 

01:19:55.270 --> 01:19:58.650
and that can represent information and
their idea was that they would use the

01:19:58.650 --> 01:19:58.660
their idea was that they would use the
 

01:19:58.660 --> 01:20:01.380
their idea was that they would use the
internal states of of ions that could be

01:20:01.380 --> 01:20:01.390
internal states of of ions that could be
 

01:20:01.390 --> 01:20:03.330
internal states of of ions that could be
their optical states like I showed with

01:20:03.330 --> 01:20:03.340
their optical states like I showed with
 

01:20:03.340 --> 01:20:05.640
their optical states like I showed with
the clocks or hyperfine States that in

01:20:05.640 --> 01:20:05.650
the clocks or hyperfine States that in
 

01:20:05.650 --> 01:20:08.520
the clocks or hyperfine States that in
principle doesn't matter anyway their

01:20:08.520 --> 01:20:08.530
principle doesn't matter anyway their
 

01:20:08.530 --> 01:20:10.770
principle doesn't matter anyway their
idea was to be able to make quantum

01:20:10.770 --> 01:20:10.780
idea was to be able to make quantum
 

01:20:10.780 --> 01:20:14.220
idea was to be able to make quantum
gates if they could if they could with a

01:20:14.220 --> 01:20:14.230
gates if they could if they could with a
 

01:20:14.230 --> 01:20:16.950
gates if they could if they could with a
laser beam if we could somehow map this

01:20:16.950 --> 01:20:16.960
laser beam if we could somehow map this
 

01:20:16.960 --> 01:20:20.220
laser beam if we could somehow map this
superposition state on to this emotional

01:20:20.220 --> 01:20:20.230
superposition state on to this emotional
 

01:20:20.230 --> 01:20:24.810
superposition state on to this emotional
state then we would then we would this

01:20:24.810 --> 01:20:24.820
state then we would then we would this
 

01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:26.400
state then we would then we would this
emotional state is interesting because

01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:26.410
emotional state is interesting because
 

01:20:26.410 --> 01:20:28.140
emotional state is interesting because
it's shared with all the eye and say

01:20:28.140 --> 01:20:28.150
it's shared with all the eye and say
 

01:20:28.150 --> 01:20:31.560
it's shared with all the eye and say
Allianz share one motional mode and then

01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:31.570
Allianz share one motional mode and then
 

01:20:31.570 --> 01:20:35.730
Allianz share one motional mode and then
that to make a gate in between the two

01:20:35.730 --> 01:20:35.740
that to make a gate in between the two
 

01:20:35.740 --> 01:20:37.500
that to make a gate in between the two
ions you'd first do this mapping step

01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:37.510
ions you'd first do this mapping step
 

01:20:37.510 --> 01:20:39.930
ions you'd first do this mapping step
and then from on a second selected ion

01:20:39.930 --> 01:20:39.940
and then from on a second selected ion
 

01:20:39.940 --> 01:20:42.330
and then from on a second selected ion
you'd do a quantum gate between the

01:20:42.330 --> 01:20:42.340
you'd do a quantum gate between the
 

01:20:42.340 --> 01:20:45.270
you'd do a quantum gate between the
motional mode and the internal state of

01:20:45.270 --> 01:20:45.280
motional mode and the internal state of
 

01:20:45.280 --> 01:20:48.120
motional mode and the internal state of
this ion which has then basically have

01:20:48.120 --> 01:20:48.130
this ion which has then basically have
 

01:20:48.130 --> 01:20:50.520
this ion which has then basically have
made a gate between the the first

01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:50.530
made a gate between the the first
 

01:20:50.530 --> 01:20:53.420
made a gate between the the first
selected ion and the second selected I'm

01:20:53.420 --> 01:20:53.430
selected ion and the second selected I'm
 

01:20:53.430 --> 01:20:57.450
selected ion and the second selected I'm
so I won't give you details of exactly

01:20:57.450 --> 01:20:57.460
so I won't give you details of exactly
 

01:20:57.460 --> 01:21:01.080
so I won't give you details of exactly
how this works but I give you a kind of

01:21:01.080 --> 01:21:01.090
how this works but I give you a kind of
 

01:21:01.090 --> 01:21:03.390
how this works but I give you a kind of
a sense of how logic gates work so if we

01:21:03.390 --> 01:21:03.400
a sense of how logic gates work so if we
 

01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:05.400
a sense of how logic gates work so if we
have this in this case it might be an

01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:05.410
have this in this case it might be an
 

01:21:05.410 --> 01:21:08.520
have this in this case it might be an
optical transition and and if we isolate

01:21:08.520 --> 01:21:08.530
optical transition and and if we isolate
 

01:21:08.530 --> 01:21:12.090
optical transition and and if we isolate
these two lower emotional quantum levels

01:21:12.090 --> 01:21:12.100
these two lower emotional quantum levels
 

01:21:12.100 --> 01:21:14.820
these two lower emotional quantum levels
which also represent a quantum bit then

01:21:14.820 --> 01:21:14.830
which also represent a quantum bit then
 

01:21:14.830 --> 01:21:16.920
which also represent a quantum bit then
one way you can kind of get the idea of

01:21:16.920 --> 01:21:16.930
one way you can kind of get the idea of
 

01:21:16.930 --> 01:21:20.460
one way you can kind of get the idea of
how logic gate works is if if we have a

01:21:20.460 --> 01:21:20.470
how logic gate works is if if we have a
 

01:21:20.470 --> 01:21:22.560
how logic gate works is if if we have a
truth table down here and the idea is

01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:22.570
truth table down here and the idea is
 

01:21:22.570 --> 01:21:27.530
truth table down here and the idea is
that if if this was this bit

01:21:27.530 --> 01:21:27.540
that if if this was this bit
 

01:21:27.540 --> 01:21:31.230
that if if this was this bit
representing the motion is is called the

01:21:31.230 --> 01:21:31.240
representing the motion is is called the
 

01:21:31.240 --> 01:21:33.630
representing the motion is is called the
if we refer to that as the control bit

01:21:33.630 --> 01:21:33.640
if we refer to that as the control bit
 

01:21:33.640 --> 01:21:36.630
if we refer to that as the control bit
and this is the this is the quanta

01:21:36.630 --> 01:21:36.640
and this is the this is the quanta
 

01:21:36.640 --> 01:21:40.260
and this is the this is the quanta
so-called target bit then the idea is if

01:21:40.260 --> 01:21:40.270
so-called target bit then the idea is if
 

01:21:40.270 --> 01:21:43.560
so-called target bit then the idea is if
we if we tuned to this transition where

01:21:43.560 --> 01:21:43.570
we if we tuned to this transition where
 

01:21:43.570 --> 01:21:46.260
we if we tuned to this transition where
the where we reduce the quantum number

01:21:46.260 --> 01:21:46.270
the where we reduce the quantum number
 

01:21:46.270 --> 01:21:49.260
the where we reduce the quantum number
by 1 then the idea is if the control bit

01:21:49.260 --> 01:21:49.270
by 1 then the idea is if the control bit
 

01:21:49.270 --> 01:21:51.090
by 1 then the idea is if the control bit
is in the N equal one level we can do

01:21:51.090 --> 01:21:51.100
is in the N equal one level we can do
 

01:21:51.100 --> 01:21:52.980
is in the N equal one level we can do
this transition in other words we flip

01:21:52.980 --> 01:21:52.990
this transition in other words we flip
 

01:21:52.990 --> 01:21:56.070
this transition in other words we flip
the the bit of the of the target the

01:21:56.070 --> 01:21:56.080
the the bit of the of the target the
 

01:21:56.080 --> 01:21:59.280
the the bit of the of the target the
target bit if it's if it's in the ground

01:21:59.280 --> 01:21:59.290
target bit if it's if it's in the ground
 

01:21:59.290 --> 01:21:59.610
target bit if it's if it's in the ground
state

01:21:59.610 --> 01:21:59.620
state
 

01:21:59.620 --> 01:22:01.410
state
again there's no place for this to go so

01:22:01.410 --> 01:22:01.420
again there's no place for this to go so
 

01:22:01.420 --> 01:22:02.150
again there's no place for this to go so
the

01:22:02.150 --> 01:22:02.160
the
 

01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:05.450
the
the the target bit doesn't flip so we

01:22:05.450 --> 01:22:05.460
the the target bit doesn't flip so we
 

01:22:05.460 --> 01:22:06.920
the the target bit doesn't flip so we
get this kind of logic table and this

01:22:06.920 --> 01:22:06.930
get this kind of logic table and this
 

01:22:06.930 --> 01:22:10.490
get this kind of logic table and this
was a little too simple but it gives the

01:22:10.490 --> 01:22:10.500
was a little too simple but it gives the
 

01:22:10.500 --> 01:22:12.260
was a little too simple but it gives the
essence of the idea this logic gate

01:22:12.260 --> 01:22:12.270
essence of the idea this logic gate
 

01:22:12.270 --> 01:22:14.780
essence of the idea this logic gate
anyway so Chris Monroe who was in the

01:22:14.780 --> 01:22:14.790
anyway so Chris Monroe who was in the
 

01:22:14.790 --> 01:22:18.350
anyway so Chris Monroe who was in the
group at that time we you know we could

01:22:18.350 --> 01:22:18.360
group at that time we you know we could
 

01:22:18.360 --> 01:22:20.720
group at that time we you know we could
we were kind of poised to do this so we

01:22:20.720 --> 01:22:20.730
we were kind of poised to do this so we
 

01:22:20.730 --> 01:22:22.430
we were kind of poised to do this so we
could jump on this idea right away and

01:22:22.430 --> 01:22:22.440
could jump on this idea right away and
 

01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:26.180
could jump on this idea right away and
we were able to demonstrate a more more

01:22:26.180 --> 01:22:26.190
we were able to demonstrate a more more
 

01:22:26.190 --> 01:22:28.850
we were able to demonstrate a more more
general logic gate that that both

01:22:28.850 --> 01:22:28.860
general logic gate that that both
 

01:22:28.860 --> 01:22:32.420
general logic gate that that both
Ignacio and Peter had described the one

01:22:32.420 --> 01:22:32.430
Ignacio and Peter had described the one
 

01:22:32.430 --> 01:22:36.250
Ignacio and Peter had described the one
thing I want to say is that for both

01:22:36.250 --> 01:22:36.260
thing I want to say is that for both
 

01:22:36.260 --> 01:22:39.680
thing I want to say is that for both
Peter and Ignacio is that this really

01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:39.690
Peter and Ignacio is that this really
 

01:22:39.690 --> 01:22:42.860
Peter and Ignacio is that this really
stimulated the the ion trap field and

01:22:42.860 --> 01:22:42.870
stimulated the the ion trap field and
 

01:22:42.870 --> 01:22:46.550
stimulated the the ion trap field and
this is the I buy less my last count the

01:22:46.550 --> 01:22:46.560
this is the I buy less my last count the
 

01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:48.620
this is the I buy less my last count the
number of the people working on just

01:22:48.620 --> 01:22:48.630
number of the people working on just
 

01:22:48.630 --> 01:22:51.350
number of the people working on just
quantum information related experiments

01:22:51.350 --> 01:22:51.360
quantum information related experiments
 

01:22:51.360 --> 01:22:53.540
quantum information related experiments
with just with ions and of course

01:22:53.540 --> 01:22:53.550
with just with ions and of course
 

01:22:53.550 --> 01:22:56.330
with just with ions and of course
there's many other implication possible

01:22:56.330 --> 01:22:56.340
there's many other implication possible
 

01:22:56.340 --> 01:23:01.040
there's many other implication possible
implementations of quantum information

01:23:01.040 --> 01:23:01.050

and and so this but anyway both Peter

01:23:04.700 --> 01:23:04.710
and and so this but anyway both Peter
 

01:23:04.710 --> 01:23:07.190
and and so this but anyway both Peter
and Ignacio have gone on to stimulate a

01:23:07.190 --> 01:23:07.200
and Ignacio have gone on to stimulate a
 

01:23:07.200 --> 01:23:10.840
and Ignacio have gone on to stimulate a
lot of work in other areas as well so

01:23:10.840 --> 01:23:10.850
lot of work in other areas as well so
 

01:23:10.850 --> 01:23:13.100
lot of work in other areas as well so
it's it it give myself in the time

01:23:13.100 --> 01:23:13.110
it's it it give myself in the time
 

01:23:13.110 --> 01:23:14.960
it's it it give myself in the time
everybody let me let me give the little

01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:14.970
everybody let me let me give the little
 

01:23:14.970 --> 01:23:17.000
everybody let me let me give the little
version of another version of

version of another version of
 

01:23:17.010 --> 01:23:18.800
version of another version of
Schrodinger's cat so you think about

01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:18.810
Schrodinger's cat so you think about
 

01:23:18.810 --> 01:23:21.680
Schrodinger's cat so you think about
this marble in the bowl what we can do

01:23:21.680 --> 01:23:21.690
this marble in the bowl what we can do
 

01:23:21.690 --> 01:23:26.630
this marble in the bowl what we can do
is that we can first start the the atom

01:23:26.630 --> 01:23:26.640
is that we can first start the the atom
 

01:23:26.640 --> 01:23:30.290
is that we can first start the the atom
in its grounds internal state we can

01:23:30.290 --> 01:23:30.300
in its grounds internal state we can
 

01:23:30.300 --> 01:23:32.750
in its grounds internal state we can
then apply radiation to make a so-called

01:23:32.750 --> 01:23:32.760
then apply radiation to make a so-called
 

01:23:32.760 --> 01:23:35.360
then apply radiation to make a so-called
superposition of the of the ground and

01:23:35.360 --> 01:23:35.370
superposition of the of the ground and
 

01:23:35.370 --> 01:23:37.970
superposition of the of the ground and
excited state then what we can do is

01:23:37.970 --> 01:23:37.980
excited state then what we can do is
 

01:23:37.980 --> 01:23:41.120
excited state then what we can do is
that we using so-called optical dipole

01:23:41.120 --> 01:23:41.130
that we using so-called optical dipole
 

01:23:41.130 --> 01:23:45.740
that we using so-called optical dipole
forces we can apply a force to the to

01:23:45.740 --> 01:23:45.750
forces we can apply a force to the to
 

01:23:45.750 --> 01:23:48.260
forces we can apply a force to the to
the to the atom but it's a force which

01:23:48.260 --> 01:23:48.270
the to the atom but it's a force which
 

01:23:48.270 --> 01:23:51.680
the to the atom but it's a force which
only acts on the on the upper state not

01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:51.690
only acts on the on the upper state not
 

01:23:51.690 --> 01:23:54.380
only acts on the on the upper state not
the lower state so we can we can start

01:23:54.380 --> 01:23:54.390
the lower state so we can we can start
 

01:23:54.390 --> 01:23:58.610
the lower state so we can we can start
to separate the this superposition both

01:23:58.610 --> 01:23:58.620
to separate the this superposition both
 

01:23:58.620 --> 01:24:01.640
to separate the this superposition both
as well as in terms of this what we call

01:24:01.640 --> 01:24:01.650
as well as in terms of this what we call
 

01:24:01.650 --> 01:24:03.500
as well as in terms of this what we call
the spin and represented by the arrows

01:24:03.500 --> 01:24:03.510
the spin and represented by the arrows
 

01:24:03.510 --> 01:24:06.620
the spin and represented by the arrows
but also the position so we can apply a

01:24:06.620 --> 01:24:06.630
but also the position so we can apply a
 

01:24:06.630 --> 01:24:10.040
but also the position so we can apply a
beam that that starts to push the up

01:24:10.040 --> 01:24:10.050
beam that that starts to push the up
 

01:24:10.050 --> 01:24:12.200
beam that that starts to push the up
component and it is oscillating back and

01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:12.210
component and it is oscillating back and
 

01:24:12.210 --> 01:24:15.290
component and it is oscillating back and
forth and then we can flip this spin

01:24:15.290 --> 01:24:15.300
forth and then we can flip this spin
 

01:24:15.300 --> 01:24:19.370
forth and then we can flip this spin
and then we apply the same force again

01:24:19.370 --> 01:24:19.380
and then we apply the same force again
 

01:24:19.380 --> 01:24:21.200
and then we apply the same force again
but we can apply it with a little bit

01:24:21.200 --> 01:24:21.210
but we can apply it with a little bit
 

01:24:21.210 --> 01:24:23.750
but we can apply it with a little bit
different phase and we can realise this

01:24:23.750 --> 01:24:23.760
different phase and we can realise this
 

01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:27.800
different phase and we can realise this

01:24:32.700 --> 01:24:35.000
on the left side of the bowl and right
side of the bowl correlated with the

side of the bowl correlated with the
 

01:24:35.010 --> 01:24:37.220
side of the bowl correlated with the
direction of the spin and there was the

direction of the spin and there was the
 

01:24:37.230 --> 01:24:39.860

internal energy say and and we would say

01:24:39.860 --> 01:24:39.870
internal energy say and and we would say
 

01:24:39.870 --> 01:24:42.470

this is like this is very much like

01:24:42.470 --> 01:24:42.480
this is like this is very much like
 

01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:45.320
this is like this is very much like
Schrodinger's cat and that we we have a

01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:45.330
Schrodinger's cat and that we we have a
 

01:24:45.330 --> 01:24:47.480

okay now we have heard the two beautiful
lectures about two laureates and now we

01:31:51.540 --> 01:31:51.550
lectures about two laureates and now we
 

01:31:51.550 --> 01:31:53.310
lectures about two laureates and now we
have the superposition of them here on

01:31:53.310 --> 01:31:53.320
have the superposition of them here on
 

01:31:53.320 --> 01:31:57.390
have the superposition of them here on
the stage so if the some urgent question

01:31:57.390 --> 01:31:57.400
the stage so if the some urgent question
 

01:31:57.400 --> 01:32:00.360
the stage so if the some urgent question
please ask if not you can meet them in

01:32:00.360 --> 01:32:00.370
please ask if not you can meet them in
 

01:32:00.370 --> 01:32:04.970
please ask if not you can meet them in
the intermission is it some question

01:32:04.970 --> 01:32:04.980
the intermission is it some question
 

01:32:04.980 --> 01:32:26.970
the intermission is it some question
over there yes this were like doing

01:32:26.970 --> 01:32:26.980
over there yes this were like doing
 

01:32:26.980 --> 01:32:30.330
over there yes this were like doing
experiments with with single particles

01:32:30.330 --> 01:32:30.340
experiments with with single particles
 

01:32:30.340 --> 01:32:32.820
experiments with with single particles
yet he of course was the the originator

01:32:32.820 --> 01:32:32.830
yet he of course was the the originator
 

01:32:32.830 --> 01:32:35.180
yet he of course was the the originator
of the idea of the throat of your cat

01:32:35.180 --> 01:32:35.190
of the idea of the throat of your cat
 

01:32:35.190 --> 01:32:41.040
of the idea of the throat of your cat
were others of the founders of quantum

01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:41.050
were others of the founders of quantum
 

01:32:41.050 --> 01:32:44.490
were others of the founders of quantum
mechanics equally suspicious of the idea

01:32:44.490 --> 01:32:44.500
mechanics equally suspicious of the idea
 

01:32:44.500 --> 01:32:48.930
mechanics equally suspicious of the idea
of a single particle experiments or was

01:32:48.930 --> 01:32:48.940
of a single particle experiments or was
 

01:32:48.940 --> 01:32:50.700
of a single particle experiments or was
it something unique to Schrodinger and

01:32:50.700 --> 01:32:50.710
it something unique to Schrodinger and
 

01:32:50.710 --> 01:32:54.790
it something unique to Schrodinger and
what was his problem

01:32:54.790 --> 01:32:54.800
 
 

01:32:54.800 --> 01:33:00.430
 
I don't know about all of them but I

01:33:00.430 --> 01:33:00.440
I don't know about all of them but I
 

01:33:00.440 --> 01:33:02.200
I don't know about all of them but I
think Einstein was dubious too

01:33:02.200 --> 01:33:02.210
think Einstein was dubious too
 

01:33:02.210 --> 01:33:04.210
think Einstein was dubious too
he had an awesome metaphor he used the

01:33:04.210 --> 01:33:04.220
he had an awesome metaphor he used the
 

01:33:04.220 --> 01:33:06.250
he had an awesome metaphor he used the
idea of a bomb which is half exploded

01:33:06.250 --> 01:33:06.260
idea of a bomb which is half exploded
 

01:33:06.260 --> 01:33:09.040
idea of a bomb which is half exploded
and half not exploded which is the

01:33:09.040 --> 01:33:09.050
and half not exploded which is the
 

01:33:09.050 --> 01:33:12.370
and half not exploded which is the
similar idea but maybe got less

01:33:12.370 --> 01:33:12.380
similar idea but maybe got less
 

01:33:12.380 --> 01:33:15.010
similar idea but maybe got less
publicity because then the cut is more

01:33:15.010 --> 01:33:15.020
publicity because then the cut is more
 

01:33:15.020 --> 01:33:18.310
publicity because then the cut is more
lava bombs and bomb but I think I just

01:33:18.310 --> 01:33:18.320
lava bombs and bomb but I think I just
 

01:33:18.320 --> 01:33:20.980
lava bombs and bomb but I think I just
and did not like this idea about boy

01:33:20.980 --> 01:33:20.990
and did not like this idea about boy
 

01:33:20.990 --> 01:33:23.080
and did not like this idea about boy
it's difficult to know because you know

01:33:23.080 --> 01:33:23.090
it's difficult to know because you know
 

01:33:23.090 --> 01:33:26.470
it's difficult to know because you know
that his statements were very cloudy and

01:33:26.470 --> 01:33:26.480
that his statements were very cloudy and
 

01:33:26.480 --> 01:33:28.750
that his statements were very cloudy and
I don't know what he would have said I

01:33:28.750 --> 01:33:28.760
I don't know what he would have said I
 

01:33:28.760 --> 01:33:30.610
I don't know what he would have said I
am sure he would not have been surprised

01:33:30.610 --> 01:33:30.620
am sure he would not have been surprised
 

01:33:30.620 --> 01:33:34.930
am sure he would not have been surprised
by the results of these experiments okay

01:33:34.930 --> 01:33:34.940
by the results of these experiments okay
 

01:33:34.940 --> 01:33:38.110
by the results of these experiments okay
I think with this we thank the speakers

01:33:38.110 --> 01:33:38.120
I think with this we thank the speakers
 

01:33:38.120 --> 01:33:40.210
I think with this we thank the speakers
again and in the intermission you can

01:33:40.210 --> 01:33:40.220
again and in the intermission you can
 

01:33:40.220 --> 01:33:42.820
again and in the intermission you can
discuss with them
