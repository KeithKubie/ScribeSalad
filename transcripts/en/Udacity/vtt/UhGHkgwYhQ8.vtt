00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.450
So, 12 eggs divided by 1 carton is 1.

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:05.163
Let's explore the consequence of this.

00:00:05.163 --> 00:00:08.358

00:00:08.358 --> 00:00:12.000
Can you tell me how many
eggs are in 3 cartons.

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.700
And there's a lot of ways to solve this,
and I bet you'll get the right answer.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.410
But what's interesting here
is how you get that answer.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.880
So, go ahead and put your answer here
