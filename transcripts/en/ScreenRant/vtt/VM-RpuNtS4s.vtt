00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.750
Franchises are the backbone of Hollywood these
days, with every studio looking for ways to

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.780
plan out a series of tentpoles years in advance.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.460
Often times, they’re working with a rich
mythology or decades of publication history

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.960
to draw from, so the stories write themselves.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.250
Then there are the self-contained films that
don’t really leave anything open at the

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.200
end, calling into question why a follow-up
was ever produced.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:33.510
Here are Screen Rant’s 10 great movies that
never needed a sequel.

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.510
Jaws

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.580
Steven Spielberg’s thriller is one of the
most influential works of all-time, since

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.140
it introduced the concept of the studio blockbuster.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:46.850
It became the first movie to gross $100 million
at the box office and set records, so the

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.320
studio wanted a sequel.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.090
However, it wasn’t warranted.

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.739
Jaws ends with Brody killing the shark and
there isn’t anywhere else to go with the

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:59.860
concept or the characters.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.739
Seeing that the sequels stretched the premise
to absurd lengths, the executives would be

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.580
been better suited following Spielberg’s
lead and leaving it after part one.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:13.350
There are only so many times a shark can terrorize
the same beach… or family.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.350
Rocky

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:15.350
We know what you’re thinking.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.350
Without Rocky sequels, Creed would never be
possible, but it took a while for the champ

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.799
to regain his former glory.

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:25.079
The original is a hard-hitting sports drama
that’s the ultimate underdog tale and concludes

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:27.689
with Rocky rediscovering his self-value.

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.060
Over time, the series morphed into 1980s camp
with over-the-top villains, and essentially

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.799
disregarded Rocky’s heartfelt message.

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:40.210
In the first one, Balboa knew he couldn’t
beat Creed, but that didn’t really matter

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:41.210
in the end.

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.390
But every other time out, winning the final
fight was the ultimate goal.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:51.889
And besides, Apollo said there wouldn’t
be a rematch and Rocky didn’t want one.

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:52.929
Jurassic Park

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:57.450
Imaginations were captured when dinosaurs
came back to life and moviegoers got to experience

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.060
the wonder of Jurassic Park.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.340
But the severe consequences of the amusement
park were also placed front and center, illustrating

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.780
the dangers of bringing the prehistoric creatures
into the modern age.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.119
After the experiment proved to be a disaster
the first time around, there’s really no

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:16.820
reason – other than box office dollars – to
keep going back to the well.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.410
It’s a cautionary tale that plays out pretty
much the same way each time.

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:31.720
No matter how advanced your security measures
are, the dinosaurs will always rule the world.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:32.720
The Hangover

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.300
Audiences were pleasantly surprised when the
first Hangover gave R-rated comedies a shot

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.940
in the arm and provided a zany collection
of laughs.

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.560
The cast was in top form, several of the jokes
landed, and a scary mystery fueled the plot

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.250
and gave it serious stakes.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.950
Once Doug was found and the gang saw pictures
from the bachelor party, we were ready to

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.090
move on – but the Wolfpack wasn’t.

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.630
They came back for two more misadventures
that couldn’t live up to the original, mainly

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:02.380
because there was nothing new to bring to
the table.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.940
Even Zach Galifianakis says the sequels were
disappointing, so let’s just consider the

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.000
first one canon.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Die Hard

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.200
Arguably the perfect action movie, Die Hard
is a tour de force with thrilling set pieces,

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:20.660
a great hero, and an even better villain.

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.700
It also tied everything up nicely at the end,
as John McClane reconnected with his wife

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.310
and rode off to celebrate the holidays with
his family.

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.700
There didn’t seem to be room for another
story, but sequels were made.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.950
Sure, the follow-ups have their moments of
fun and entertainment, but none of them can

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.710
hold a candle to what made the original so
special.

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:40.010
When moviegoers think of John McClane, they
think of the first film, and there’s a good

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:46.710
reason for that.

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:47.710
Speed

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:51.250
One of the best action films of the 1990s,
Speed was a white-knuckled ride from start

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.190
to finish, keeping viewers on the edge of
their seats with excitement and well-rendered

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:56.190
characters.

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.690
Like so many movies of its kind, Speed probably
would have been better served as a one-and-done

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:00.690
exercise.

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.850
One only has to look at Speed 2 for proof,
since it’s one of the more underwhelming

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.830
action flicks ever released.

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:09.710
Featuring thin characterization and set pieces
that bored rather than thrilled, it was clear

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:12.880
it didn’t have anything to add and almost
ruined what came before.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:18.000
If they couldn’t get Keanu Reeves back,
they probably should have left it alone.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.250
Monsters, Inc.

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:27.180
Pixar’s 2001 hit is one of their most inventive
and beloved, featuring creative world building

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.599
and wonderful characters that touched the
heart.

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:33.479
The story it told was so perfect, the studio
couldn’t move forward with a second installment

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:35.439
– they had to go back in time.

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:39.389
A prequel, Monsters University, showed how
Mike and Sully met in college and became the

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:41.539
lifelong friends we see in the original.

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:44.949
While it was fun to see the monsters back
in action and another side of the universe,

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:52.569
it’s seen as second-rate Pixar that isn’t
as effective as the first film.

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:56.060
Moviegoers would have preferred Pixar make
an original concept than go back to a well

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:00.819
they’ve hit before.

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:01.819
Men in Black

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:05.020
It’s a premise that’s seemingly set up
for sequels, but Men in Black should have

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.030
been left alone.

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:09.960
The filmmakers weren’t entirely sure how
to handle a follow-up, and brought back Tommy

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.060
Lee Jones to work with Will Smith.

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.810
Unfortunately, this undermines the emotional
conclusion of the first film, where Agent

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:19.569
Kay steps down to have his memory wiped so
he can reunite with his true love.

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:23.800
His story should have ended there, especially
since Men in Black II could only recycle elements

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.160
from the first movie and didn’t feel as
fresh.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:34.620
When there’s nowhere to go with the characters,
it’s best to leave it untouched.

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:35.620
Grease

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:40.310
One of the most memorable musicals ever, the
original Grease is full of catchy tunes, fun

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:43.030
characters, and an entertaining story about
young love.

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:46.620
Since it was so popular, the studio tried
to force a sequel, and the results were not

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:47.919
nearly as impressive.

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:51.760
While Grease 2 did have solid song and dance
numbers of its own, it was dismissed largely

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:55.460
as a retread of the first one – with a new
cast - that didn’t really bring anything

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:56.490
new to the table.

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:01.199
Fans could just watch the original and get
all the summer loving they needed.

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:02.219
Caddyshack

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:07.180
An endlessly quotable comedy with hilarious
characters and situations, 1980’s Caddyshack

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:11.300
is seen as one of the high points of the genre
and a favorite for moviegoers everywhere.

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:16.059
Released 8 years later, the sequel became
Exhibit A for why comedy follow-ups are a

00:06:16.059 --> 00:06:17.059
bad idea.

00:06:17.059 --> 00:06:21.509
It surprisingly went for a family-friendly
PG rating, and was handicapped by a lackluster

00:06:21.509 --> 00:06:23.699
script that didn’t provide many laughs.

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:27.879
It was probably a bad sign that Chevy Chase
was the only original cast member that signed

00:06:27.879 --> 00:06:31.479
on to return; the rest uninterested or concerned
it wouldn’t be good.

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:37.430
The filmmakers should have listened to Bill
Murray.

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:40.169
Those are our picks for great films that never
needed a sequel.

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:41.419
Are there any we missed?

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:43.380
