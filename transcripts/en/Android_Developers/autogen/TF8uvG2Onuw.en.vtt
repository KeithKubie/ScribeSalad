we're just going to get started today's

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059
we're just going to get started today's
 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.980

episode is on device automation apps the

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990
episode is on device automation apps the
 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.090
episode is on device automation apps the
app that will be looking at today is

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100
app that will be looking at today is
 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.200
app that will be looking at today is
called tasker and then we'll also go

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210
called tasker and then we'll also go
 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.269
called tasker and then we'll also go
into a deep dive on touch feedback and

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279
into a deep dive on touch feedback and
 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.250
into a deep dive on touch feedback and
then we have a good amount of design use

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260
then we have a good amount of design use
 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.450
then we have a good amount of design use
to cover as well so let's just get

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460
to cover as well so let's just get
 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.170
to cover as well so let's just get
started so if we can look at the slide

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180
started so if we can look at the slide
 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.850
started so if we can look at the slide
chef I can't really see if we're looking

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860
chef I can't really see if we're looking
 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.880
chef I can't really see if we're looking
there but I guess we are okay so this is

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890
there but I guess we are okay so this is
 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.290
there but I guess we are okay so this is
on the left side the tasker app now I'm

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300
on the left side the tasker app now I'm
 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.880
on the left side the tasker app now I'm
Tasker is basically a device automation

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890
Tasker is basically a device automation
 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.430
Tasker is basically a device automation
app in the App clinic they kind of use

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440
app in the App clinic they kind of use
 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.709
app in the App clinic they kind of use
the term profile device profile apps

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719
the term profile device profile apps
 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.610

this is kind of I guess a subset of that

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620
this is kind of I guess a subset of that
 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.290
this is kind of I guess a subset of that
basically it lets you create a system of

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300
basically it lets you create a system of
 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.319
basically it lets you create a system of
constraints or contexts and create a set

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329
constraints or contexts and create a set
 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.569
constraints or contexts and create a set
of actions or tasks I guess tasks are

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579
of actions or tasks I guess tasks are
 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.650
of actions or tasks I guess tasks are
collections of actions in this amp that

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660
collections of actions in this amp that
 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.609
collections of actions in this amp that
that get run when the device enters that

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619
that get run when the device enters that
 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:09.530
that get run when the device enters that
kind of profile that context so for

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540
kind of profile that context so for
 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.440
kind of profile that context so for
example if if the date or if the week

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450
example if if the date or if the week
 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.289
example if if the date or if the week
day is monday through friday and the

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299
day is monday through friday and the
 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.440
day is monday through friday and the
time of days between 9pm and 5 p.m. and

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450
time of days between 9pm and 5 p.m. and
 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.859
time of days between 9pm and 5 p.m. and
5pm you can be thought as like in the

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869
5pm you can be thought as like in the
 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.160
5pm you can be thought as like in the
work profile or in the work a set of

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170
work profile or in the work a set of
 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.350
work profile or in the work a set of
context and then so once you enter that

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360
context and then so once you enter that
 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.649
context and then so once you enter that
context rather enter that profile

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659
context rather enter that profile
 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:31.670
context rather enter that profile
there's a lot of terminology in the

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680
there's a lot of terminology in the
 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.260
there's a lot of terminology in the
Sabbats it's somewhat confusing but it's

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270
Sabbats it's somewhat confusing but it's
 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.450
Sabbats it's somewhat confusing but it's
you know it's very well thought out when

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460
you know it's very well thought out when
 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.980
you know it's very well thought out when
you enter the contact certain things can

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990
you enter the contact certain things can
 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.050
you enter the contact certain things can
happen when you leave that context of

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060
happen when you leave that context of
 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.940
happen when you leave that context of
profile other things can happen so

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950
profile other things can happen so
 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.490
profile other things can happen so
there's an enter and exit action so

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500
there's an enter and exit action so
 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.410
there's an enter and exit action so
that's a you know at a very high level

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420
that's a you know at a very high level
 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.330
that's a you know at a very high level
what the app does it lets you how to do

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340
what the app does it lets you how to do
 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.580
what the app does it lets you how to do
a number of different things from you

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590
a number of different things from you
 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.560
a number of different things from you
know from setting system settings

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570
know from setting system settings
 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.069
know from setting system settings
automatically to you know speaking out

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079
automatically to you know speaking out
 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.230

text to doing all sorts of interesting
 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.200
text to doing all sorts of interesting
things and of course the number of

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210
things and of course the number of
 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.420
things and of course the number of
different profiles or or different

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430
different profiles or or different
 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.280
different profiles or or different
constraints that they have is also very

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290
constraints that they have is also very
 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.350
constraints that they have is also very
large so you can really really customize

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360
large so you can really really customize
 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.419
large so you can really really customize
that the set of behaviors you want so

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429
that the set of behaviors you want so
 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.609
that the set of behaviors you want so
this is the app as you can see here

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619
this is the app as you can see here
 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:11.979
this is the app as you can see here
there's kind of these three tabs

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989
there's kind of these three tabs
 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:13.710
there's kind of these three tabs
profiles

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720
profiles
 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.370
profiles
and scenes we're not only going to talk

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380
and scenes we're not only going to talk
 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.620
and scenes we're not only going to talk
about scenes that much because I anisty

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630
about scenes that much because I anisty
 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.120
about scenes that much because I anisty
didn't really get a feel for what they

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130
didn't really get a feel for what they
 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.150
didn't really get a feel for what they
were the profiles and tasks are two of

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160
were the profiles and tasks are two of
 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.100
were the profiles and tasks are two of
the most important things here so here

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110
the most important things here so here
 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.160
the most important things here so here
we have a single profile which is my

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170
we have a single profile which is my
 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.990
we have a single profile which is my
work profile and on the left you see the

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000
work profile and on the left you see the
 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.480
work profile and on the left you see the
the different contexts that need to be

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490
the different contexts that need to be
 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.120
the different contexts that need to be
satisfied to be in this profile and then

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130
satisfied to be in this profile and then
 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.710
satisfied to be in this profile and then
in the right hand you the right hand

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720
in the right hand you the right hand
 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.310
in the right hand you the right hand
side you see the basically the actions

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320
side you see the basically the actions
 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.590
side you see the basically the actions
that occur when you enter or exit in

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600
that occur when you enter or exit in
 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.080
that occur when you enter or exit in
this case there's only an interaction so

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090
this case there's only an interaction so
 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.660
this case there's only an interaction so
when you exit this profile like you know

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670
when you exit this profile like you know
 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.120
when you exit this profile like you know
when you leave work basically nothing

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130
when you leave work basically nothing
 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.410
when you leave work basically nothing
will happen there won't be like an

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420
will happen there won't be like an
 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.720
will happen there won't be like an
unmetered anything and then set to

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730
unmetered anything and then set to
 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.880
unmetered anything and then set to
unleash upon dead as soon as you get to

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890
unleash upon dead as soon as you get to
 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.710
unleash upon dead as soon as you get to
work yeah I couldn't really find the

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720
work yeah I couldn't really find the
 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.440
work yeah I couldn't really find the
better icon for muting unfortunately the

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450
better icon for muting unfortunately the
 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.140
better icon for muting unfortunately the
the built-in icons didn't really have a

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150
the built-in icons didn't really have a
 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.940
the built-in icons didn't really have a
really obvious mute icon so I just shows

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950
really obvious mute icon so I just shows
 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.050
really obvious mute icon so I just shows
a panther because they're cute and

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060
a panther because they're cute and
 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.390
a panther because they're cute and
cuddly okay and basically here you know

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400
cuddly okay and basically here you know
 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.040
cuddly okay and basically here you know
there's some standard stuff there's

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050
there's some standard stuff there's
 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.350
there's some standard stuff there's
these actions in the bottom that let you

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360
these actions in the bottom that let you
 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.860
these actions in the bottom that let you
add things you know add a profile in

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870
add things you know add a profile in
 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.970
add things you know add a profile in
this case except and cancel changes turn

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980
this case except and cancel changes turn
 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.080
this case except and cancel changes turn
Tasker on and off as a whole and then to

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090
Tasker on and off as a whole and then to
 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.479
Tasker on and off as a whole and then to
edit things on the screen there's a lot

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489
edit things on the screen there's a lot
 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:32.699
edit things on the screen there's a lot
of long pressing going on which you know

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709
of long pressing going on which you know
 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:34.740
of long pressing going on which you know
as if you look through our guidelines on

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750
as if you look through our guidelines on
 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.600
as if you look through our guidelines on
gestures you should really reserved long

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610
gestures you should really reserved long
 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.340
gestures you should really reserved long
press for other things but there's a lot

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350
press for other things but there's a lot
 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:39.990
press for other things but there's a lot
of complex interactions and a lot of

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000
of complex interactions and a lot of
 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.940
of complex interactions and a lot of
stuff going on on the screen so that's

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950
stuff going on on the screen so that's
 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.280
stuff going on on the screen so that's
why we chose to think of a kind of a

the plethora of options it seems to
 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.430
the plethora of options it seems to
offer up so it's pretty excited it got

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440
offer up so it's pretty excited it got

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:58.760
okay we should really fly through this
 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.560
okay we should really fly through this
is way too much content so we have you

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:02.570
is way too much content so we have you
 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:03.970
is way too much content so we have you
know we fitted it with the standard

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:03.980
know we fitted it with the standard
 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.100
know we fitted it with the standard
action bar and tab bar we basically

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110
action bar and tab bar we basically
 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:07.810
action bar and tab bar we basically
taken their core tab bar that they've

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:07.820
taken their core tab bar that they've
 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.180
taken their core tab bar that they've
had in the previous screen here and

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:10.190
had in the previous screen here and
 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:12.750
had in the previous screen here and
we've made it look more Hollow obviously

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:12.760
we've made it look more Hollow obviously
 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.890
we've made it look more Hollow obviously
we feel that you know these tabs are

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:14.900
we feel that you know these tabs are
 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.960
we feel that you know these tabs are
probably fine you know separating it out

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:16.970
probably fine you know separating it out
 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:18.730
probably fine you know separating it out
to bringing out the app into these three

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740
to bringing out the app into these three
 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.590
to bringing out the app into these three
core sections is probably okay it's

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:20.600
core sections is probably okay it's
 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.180
core sections is probably okay it's
really up to the app to decide what

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:22.190
really up to the app to decide what
 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.700
really up to the app to decide what
their information architecture is but we

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710
their information architecture is but we
 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.670
their information architecture is but we
left it as is but and we've put the

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680
left it as is but and we've put the
 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.490
left it as is but and we've put the
we've moved the the on off switch for

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:30.500
we've moved the the on off switch for
 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.310
we've moved the the on off switch for
the entire app to the top right as a key

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:33.320
the entire app to the top right as a key
 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.040
the entire app to the top right as a key
action in this case you know some could

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050
action in this case you know some could
 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:37.270
action in this case you know some could
argue that you shouldn't have actions in

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.280
argue that you shouldn't have actions in
 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.250
argue that you shouldn't have actions in
both the top right and in the split

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:39.260
both the top right and in the split
 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.020
both the top right and in the split
action bar but in this case it's really

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:41.030
action bar but in this case it's really
 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:43.960
action bar but in this case it's really
kind of like a global it's not really an

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:43.970
kind of like a global it's not really an
 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:45.400
kind of like a global it's not really an
action it's really look at AAG look a

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:45.410
action it's really look at AAG look a
 

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:47.200
action it's really look at AAG look a
high level toggle for the entire app so

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:47.210
high level toggle for the entire app so
 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:49.050
high level toggle for the entire app so
we felt that it was appropriate there

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:49.060
we felt that it was appropriate there
 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.610
we felt that it was appropriate there
and then in the content of the screen

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:51.620
and then in the content of the screen
 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:54.400
and then in the content of the screen
you see your profiles but here you can't

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:54.410
you see your profiles but here you can't
 

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:56.770
you see your profiles but here you can't
really edit the profiles and this is one

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:56.780
really edit the profiles and this is one
 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:58.690
really edit the profiles and this is one
of the things that I found that was a

00:05:58.690 --> 00:05:58.700
of the things that I found that was a
 

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:00.220
of the things that I found that was a
little confusing with the preview or

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:00.230
little confusing with the preview or
 

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:03.070
little confusing with the preview or
with the current app is that viewing the

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:03.080
with the current app is that viewing the
 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.110
with the current app is that viewing the
list of profiles and editing in an

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120
list of profiles and editing in an
 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.930
list of profiles and editing in an
individual profile is all in one screen

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:07.940
individual profile is all in one screen
 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:10.690
individual profile is all in one screen
it almost being it almost be like you

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:10.700
it almost being it almost be like you
 

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.540
it almost being it almost be like you
know seeing a list of contacts and

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:12.550
know seeing a list of contacts and
 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:15.130
know seeing a list of contacts and
editing each contact all in once almost

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:15.140
editing each contact all in once almost
 

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:16.780
editing each contact all in once almost
like a spreadsheet and it just felt

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:16.790
like a spreadsheet and it just felt
 

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:19.390
like a spreadsheet and it just felt
overbearing so we decided to split this

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:19.400
overbearing so we decided to split this
 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.760
overbearing so we decided to split this
screen up into two screens we're on one

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:21.770
screen up into two screens we're on one
 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:23.650
screen up into two screens we're on one
screen you see the list of profiles and

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:23.660
screen you see the list of profiles and
 

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:25.090
screen you see the list of profiles and
you can obviously turn them on and off

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:25.100
you can obviously turn them on and off
 

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.100
you can obviously turn them on and off
which is a simple you know action that

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:27.110
which is a simple you know action that
 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:28.200
which is a simple you know action that
you can take

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:28.210
you can take
 

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:30.210
you can take
but then to to edit the profile you know

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:30.220
but then to to edit the profile you know
 

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:32.070
but then to to edit the profile you know
you touch once to get into the details

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:32.080
you touch once to get into the details
 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.620
you touch once to get into the details
and we'll show you then so here you see

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:34.630
and we'll show you then so here you see
 

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:37.379
and we'll show you then so here you see
the list of contexts you know this is

00:06:37.379 --> 00:06:37.389
the list of contexts you know this is
 

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:39.270
the list of contexts you know this is
called my mute at work profile and

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:39.280
called my mute at work profile and
 

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.279
called my mute at work profile and
there's the list of context or

00:06:41.279 --> 00:06:41.289
there's the list of context or
 

00:06:41.289 --> 00:06:42.390
there's the list of context or
constraints they need to be fulfilled

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:42.400
constraints they need to be fulfilled
 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.390
constraints they need to be fulfilled
and then when you enter it mutes and

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:45.400
and then when you enter it mutes and
 

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.420
and then when you enter it mutes and
when you leave it unmute and then here's

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:48.430
when you leave it unmute and then here's
 

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:50.430
when you leave it unmute and then here's
an example of a profile that's turned

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:50.440
an example of a profile that's turned
 

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.189
an example of a profile that's turned
off for example send I'm coming home as

00:06:53.189 --> 00:06:53.199
off for example send I'm coming home as
 

00:06:53.199 --> 00:06:54.900
off for example send I'm coming home as
a text message and we've decided to turn

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:54.910
a text message and we've decided to turn
 

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:57.240
a text message and we've decided to turn
that off and there's no exit action

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:57.250
that off and there's no exit action
 

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:59.659
that off and there's no exit action
there's only a single interaction there

00:06:59.659 --> 00:06:59.669
there's only a single interaction there
 

00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:03.210
there's only a single interaction there
and then you can add a profile using the

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:03.220

button and of course you could put this
in the action bar if you want but it is

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:07.210
in the action bar if you want but it is

just a sort minh of different types of
ways you can expose this and then to

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:10.840
ways you can expose this and then to
 

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:12.420
ways you can expose this and then to

remove something you just swipe to
 

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:14.490
remove something you just swipe to
dismiss it and then there are probably

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:14.500
dismiss it and then there are probably
 

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:17.189
dismiss it and then there are probably
other actions you can take on each

basically where you're editing a task
and you can see here this you know

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:07.590
and you can see here this you know
 

00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:10.070
and you can see here this you know
there's a lot of you know there are a

00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:10.080
there's a lot of you know there are a
 

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:12.230
there's a lot of you know there are a
lot of objects that you deal with in

this app and so one of the core points

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:15.270
this app and so one of the core points

this app and so one of the core points
overall with this redesign is to

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:16.980
overall with this redesign is to
 

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:18.920
overall with this redesign is to
simplify things to make it very obvious

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:18.930
simplify things to make it very obvious
 

00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:21.320
simplify things to make it very obvious
of what you're working with and so you

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:21.330
of what you're working with and so you
 

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:23.000
of what you're working with and so you
know here you're working with you know a

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:23.010
know here you're working with you know a
 

00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:24.980
know here you're working with you know a
list of actions for a task and

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:24.990
list of actions for a task and
 

00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:26.600
list of actions for a task and
previously you're working with a list of

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:26.610
previously you're working with a list of
 

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:29.960
previously you're working with a list of
you know contexts for a profile so you

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:29.970
you know contexts for a profile so you
 

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:31.340
you know contexts for a profile so you
want to make it very very clear

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:31.350
want to make it very very clear
 

00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:32.660
want to make it very very clear
throughout every step in the process

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:32.670
throughout every step in the process
 

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:34.910
throughout every step in the process
what the types of data you're working

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:34.920
what the types of data you're working
 

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:37.960
what the types of data you're working
with is and where in the structure it is

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:37.970
with is and where in the structure it is
 

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:41.000
with is and where in the structure it is
so here is another example of how you

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:41.010
so here is another example of how you
 

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:43.580
so here is another example of how you
can kind of use swipe to dismiss and a

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:43.590
can kind of use swipe to dismiss and a
 

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:47.150
can kind of use swipe to dismiss and a
simple add action here at the top to

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:47.160
simple add action here at the top to
 

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.370
simple add action here at the top to
replace a bunch of you know buttons that

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:49.380
replace a bunch of you know buttons that
 

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:52.280
replace a bunch of you know buttons that
are on screen for like deleting and and

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:52.290
are on screen for like deleting and and
 

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:54.710
are on screen for like deleting and and
adding and things like that and actually

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:54.720
adding and things like that and actually
 

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.720
adding and things like that and actually
here you'll notice that there's no real

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:56.730
here you'll notice that there's no real
 

00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:58.970
here you'll notice that there's no real
way to delete something you have to long

00:09:58.970 --> 00:09:58.980
way to delete something you have to long
 

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:02.030
way to delete something you have to long
press to delete which is it seems kind

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:02.040
press to delete which is it seems kind
 

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:06.100
press to delete which is it seems kind
of like extra work to have to do that I

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:06.110
of like extra work to have to do that I
 

00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:08.360
of like extra work to have to do that I
think there's there's probably one or

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:08.370
think there's there's probably one or
 

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:11.960
think there's there's probably one or
two more this is the the place where you

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:11.970
two more this is the the place where you
 

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:14.900
two more this is the the place where you
can kind of rename a task so if you jump

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:14.910
can kind of rename a task so if you jump
 

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:16.250
can kind of rename a task so if you jump
into the task details you should be able

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:16.260
into the task details you should be able
 

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:17.900
into the task details you should be able
to edit everything one of the ways you

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:17.910
to edit everything one of the ways you
 

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:19.100
to edit everything one of the ways you
could do that is to have like an inline

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:19.110
could do that is to have like an inline
 

00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:21.710
could do that is to have like an inline
text field with the name so you just

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:21.720
text field with the name so you just
 

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.360
text field with the name so you just
start you know changing the name right

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:23.370
start you know changing the name right
 

00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:25.730
start you know changing the name right
there and then or if if you don't think

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:25.740
there and then or if if you don't think
 

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:26.870
there and then or if if you don't think
that that's going to be a very common

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:26.880
that that's going to be a very common
 

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:28.550
that that's going to be a very common
thing you could move it into the action

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:28.560
thing you could move it into the action
 

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:29.930
thing you could move it into the action
overflow is kind of like a rename

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:29.940
overflow is kind of like a rename
 

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:33.230
overflow is kind of like a rename
additional actually and I think the last

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:33.240
additional actually and I think the last
 

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:35.260
additional actually and I think the last
screen should i want to show here is

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:35.270
screen should i want to show here is
 

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:37.490
screen should i want to show here is
adding an action this is one of the more

00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:37.500
adding an action this is one of the more
 

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:40.010
adding an action this is one of the more
important parts so actually this is

00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:40.020
important parts so actually this is
 

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:41.750
important parts so actually this is
adding yet this is adding an action not

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:41.760
adding yet this is adding an action not
 

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:44.930
adding yet this is adding an action not
a context so when you add an action like

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:44.940
a context so when you add an action like
 

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:47.910
a context so when you add an action like
you know when it is time to or when I

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:47.920
you know when it is time to or when I
 

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:51.180
you know when it is time to or when I
work for example mute the phone or you

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:51.190
work for example mute the phone or you
 

00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:53.430
work for example mute the phone or you
know speak some text or whatever you

00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:53.440
know speak some text or whatever you
 

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:56.670
know speak some text or whatever you
know airplane mode whatever to do that

00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:56.680
know airplane mode whatever to do that
 

00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:58.530
know airplane mode whatever to do that
in the current app you have to kind of

00:10:58.530 --> 00:10:58.540
in the current app you have to kind of
 

00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:00.680
in the current app you have to kind of
go into a browse mode where you see this

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:00.690
go into a browse mode where you see this
 

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:03.480
go into a browse mode where you see this
overwhelmingly large set of things you

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:03.490
overwhelmingly large set of things you
 

00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:06.629
overwhelmingly large set of things you
can do and it's kind of hard to really

00:11:06.629 --> 00:11:06.639
can do and it's kind of hard to really
 

00:11:06.639 --> 00:11:08.699
can do and it's kind of hard to really
find the finger looking for and I think

00:11:08.699 --> 00:11:08.709
find the finger looking for and I think
 

00:11:08.709 --> 00:11:10.680
find the finger looking for and I think
in this case you're generally more in

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:10.690
in this case you're generally more in
 

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:13.560
in this case you're generally more in
search mode rather than browse mode so i

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:13.570
search mode rather than browse mode so i
 

00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:15.689
search mode rather than browse mode so i
think that you know it'd be be a better

00:11:15.689 --> 00:11:15.699
think that you know it'd be be a better
 

00:11:15.699 --> 00:11:17.819
think that you know it'd be be a better
case here to basically have an

00:11:17.819 --> 00:11:17.829
case here to basically have an
 

00:11:17.829 --> 00:11:20.250
case here to basically have an
autocomplete so if i'm in the list of

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:20.260
autocomplete so if i'm in the list of
 

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:21.660
autocomplete so if i'm in the list of
actions to take i just start typing

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:21.670
actions to take i just start typing
 

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:24.509
actions to take i just start typing
volume or mute or something and it gives

00:11:24.509 --> 00:11:24.519
volume or mute or something and it gives
 

00:11:24.519 --> 00:11:27.060
volume or mute or something and it gives
me a pre-populated auto completed list

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:27.070
me a pre-populated auto completed list
 

00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:28.889
me a pre-populated auto completed list
of things that i can do and as soon as I

00:11:28.889 --> 00:11:28.899
of things that i can do and as soon as I
 

00:11:28.899 --> 00:11:30.449
of things that i can do and as soon as I
touch it just adds it and if there's

00:11:30.449 --> 00:11:30.459
touch it just adds it and if there's
 

00:11:30.459 --> 00:11:31.889
touch it just adds it and if there's
configuration steps and it just shows a

00:11:31.889 --> 00:11:31.899
configuration steps and it just shows a
 

00:11:31.899 --> 00:11:35.160
configuration steps and it just shows a
configuration set so I think that was it

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:35.170
configuration set so I think that was it
 

00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:37.139
configuration set so I think that was it
I know those super funds we will do that

00:11:37.139 --> 00:11:37.149
I know those super funds we will do that
 

00:11:37.149 --> 00:11:39.629

from the screen redesigns I really like

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:45.370
from the screen redesigns I really like
 

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:47.310
from the screen redesigns I really like
the way it feels a lot cleaner now I

00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:47.320
the way it feels a lot cleaner now I
 

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:50.100
the way it feels a lot cleaner now I
think generally dialogues just aren't

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:50.110
think generally dialogues just aren't
 

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:52.380
think generally dialogues just aren't
the answer the previous actually popped

00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:52.390
the answer the previous actually popped
 

00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:53.699
the answer the previous actually popped
up a lot of dialogues which kept a lot

00:11:53.699 --> 00:11:53.709
up a lot of dialogues which kept a lot
 

00:11:53.709 --> 00:11:55.290
up a lot of dialogues which kept a lot
of context and a lot of load on the

00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:55.300
of context and a lot of load on the
 

00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:56.819

easiest kind of remember where they are

00:11:56.819 --> 00:11:56.829
easiest kind of remember where they are
 

00:11:56.829 --> 00:11:58.740
easiest kind of remember where they are
I feel like the new setup with the

00:11:58.740 --> 00:11:58.750
I feel like the new setup with the
 

00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:00.000
I feel like the new setup with the
before and after it just feels a lot

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:00.010
before and after it just feels a lot
 

00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:03.750
before and after it just feels a lot
easier to use I mean yeah and this up in

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:03.760
easier to use I mean yeah and this up in
 

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:05.250
easier to use I mean yeah and this up in
general is just really complicated like

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:05.260
general is just really complicated like
 

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:06.870
general is just really complicated like
it does a lot of things and so I think

00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:06.880
it does a lot of things and so I think
 

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:08.880
it does a lot of things and so I think
breaking them into a back-breaking the

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:08.890
breaking them into a back-breaking the
 

00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:10.170
breaking them into a back-breaking the
different functions at different screens

00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:10.180
different functions at different screens
 

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:12.360
different functions at different screens
really really helps helps the user

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:12.370
really really helps helps the user
 

00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:13.439
really really helps helps the user
navigate through these different

00:12:13.439 --> 00:12:13.449
navigate through these different
 

00:12:13.449 --> 00:12:15.660
navigate through these different
sections yeah really in this case it's

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:15.670
sections yeah really in this case it's
 

00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:17.670
sections yeah really in this case it's
simplifying actually there's there's a

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:17.680
simplifying actually there's there's a
 

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:18.960
simplifying actually there's there's a
lot of cases in the past where we've

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:18.970
lot of cases in the past where we've
 

00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:21.269
lot of cases in the past where we've
combined multiple screens into one I

00:12:21.269 --> 00:12:21.279
combined multiple screens into one I
 

00:12:21.279 --> 00:12:23.250
combined multiple screens into one I
think that this app can can do well by

00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:23.260
think that this app can can do well by
 

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.199
think that this app can can do well by
splitting things up more since it's so

00:12:25.199 --> 00:12:25.209

feedback session I just want to briefly

00:12:29.939 --> 00:12:29.949
feedback session I just want to briefly
 

00:12:29.949 --> 00:12:32.790
feedback session I just want to briefly
talk about some iconography well

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:32.800
talk about some iconography well
 

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:34.800
talk about some iconography well
actually I guess branding and actually

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:34.810
actually I guess branding and actually
 

00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:36.329
actually I guess branding and actually
it's really just branding this umbrella

00:12:36.329 --> 00:12:36.339
it's really just branding this umbrella
 

00:12:36.339 --> 00:12:39.150
it's really just branding this umbrella
of branding this is the current icon on

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:39.160
of branding this is the current icon on
 

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:40.680
of branding this is the current icon on
the left and here's kind of what it

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:40.690
the left and here's kind of what it
 

00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:43.530
the left and here's kind of what it
could look like matching the redesign

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:43.540
could look like matching the redesign
 

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:45.150
could look like matching the redesign
theme so the redesign theme is kind of

00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:45.160
theme so the redesign theme is kind of
 

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:47.430
theme so the redesign theme is kind of
like a blue and orange color scheme and

00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:47.440
like a blue and orange color scheme and
 

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:49.050
like a blue and orange color scheme and
so here's what it could look like with

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:49.060
so here's what it could look like with
 

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:51.240
so here's what it could look like with
that color scheme and this better fits

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:51.250
that color scheme and this better fits
 

00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:53.220
that color scheme and this better fits
some of the other app icons that are out

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:53.230
some of the other app icons that are out
 

00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:55.829
some of the other app icons that are out
there just purely in terms of styling

00:12:55.829 --> 00:12:55.839
there just purely in terms of styling
 

00:12:55.839 --> 00:12:57.930
there just purely in terms of styling
not so much in iconography which is kind

00:12:57.930 --> 00:12:57.940
not so much in iconography which is kind
 

00:12:57.940 --> 00:12:59.550
not so much in iconography which is kind
of the most important thing to to be

00:12:59.550 --> 00:12:59.560
of the most important thing to to be
 

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:00.360
of the most important thing to to be
memorable

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:00.370

you're taking out what is in the icon

00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:01.720
you're taking out what is in the icon
 

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:03.420
you're taking out what is in the icon
but to make it feel a little more modern

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:03.430

Roman says this one same you know large

00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:53.350
Roman says this one same you know large
 

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:55.829

00:13:55.839 --> 00:13:57.600
asset it's like 1024 pixels of wide when
you supply it and so people get tempted

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:57.610
you supply it and so people get tempted
 

00:13:57.610 --> 00:13:59.340
you supply it and so people get tempted
to cram all kinds of information in

00:13:59.340 --> 00:13:59.350
to cram all kinds of information in
 

00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:01.950
to cram all kinds of information in
there but really really and resist that

00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:01.960
there but really really and resist that
 

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:03.810
there but really really and resist that
because it can be shown very very small

00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:03.820
because it can be shown very very small
 

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:05.820

if you think about a small handset kind

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:05.830
if you think about a small handset kind
 

00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:08.370
if you think about a small handset kind
of like three inches like diagonally

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:08.380
of like three inches like diagonally
 

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:09.810

handset it's going to be shrunken down

00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:09.820
handset it's going to be shrunken down
 

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:11.519
handset it's going to be shrunken down
greatly so my advice to people is always

00:14:11.519 --> 00:14:11.529
greatly so my advice to people is always

to get your future graphic and resize it

00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:14.380
to get your future graphic and resize it
 

00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:15.750
to get your future graphic and resize it
down to about a hundred pixels wide and

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:15.760
down to about a hundred pixels wide and
 

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:17.730
down to about a hundred pixels wide and
check that everything's kind of legible

00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:17.740
check that everything's kind of legible
 

00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:19.740
check that everything's kind of legible
and still looks good at that kind of

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:19.750
and still looks good at that kind of
 

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:21.780
and still looks good at that kind of
size and the other tip is that if you

00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:21.790

feedback yep alright Adam you wanna

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:05.890
feedback yep alright Adam you wanna
 

00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:09.300
feedback yep alright Adam you wanna
drive yeah sure so we wanted to discuss

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:09.310
drive yeah sure so we wanted to discuss
 

00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:11.520
drive yeah sure so we wanted to discuss
a little bit about touch feedback we

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:11.530
a little bit about touch feedback we
 

00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:12.870
a little bit about touch feedback we
actually look at a lot of different

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:12.880
actually look at a lot of different
 

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:15.320
actually look at a lot of different
applications in our role and

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:15.330
applications in our role and
 

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:17.360
applications in our role and
surprisingly one of the things we see

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:17.370
surprisingly one of the things we see
 

00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:19.290
surprisingly one of the things we see
broken and a lot of them is touch

00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:19.300
broken and a lot of them is touch
 

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:21.660
broken and a lot of them is touch
feedback which is strange because it

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:21.670
feedback which is strange because it
 

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:23.400
feedback which is strange because it
really does give the user a sense of

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:23.410
really does give the user a sense of
 

00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:26.040
really does give the user a sense of
responsiveness and indicate that

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:26.050
responsiveness and indicate that
 

00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:28.200
responsiveness and indicate that
something's happening within within the

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:28.210
something's happening within within the
 

00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:31.230
something's happening within within the
application and the amount of effort

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:31.240
application and the amount of effort
 

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:33.330
application and the amount of effort
required to actually add good touch

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:33.340
required to actually add good touch
 

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:34.770
required to actually add good touch
feedback in the application is actually

00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:34.780
feedback in the application is actually
 

00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:36.060
feedback in the application is actually
not that much so it's definitely

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:36.070
not that much so it's definitely
 

00:15:36.070 --> 00:15:38.490
not that much so it's definitely
something with sort of lower amounts of

00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:38.500
something with sort of lower amounts of
 

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:41.100
something with sort of lower amounts of
effort that has great payoff and of

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:41.110
effort that has great payoff and of
 

00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:42.420

course the canonical source for
information on touch feedback is the

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:43.990
information on touch feedback is the
 

00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:46.380
information on touch feedback is the
design side so if you just go on to

00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:46.390
design side so if you just go on to
 

00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:47.760
design side so if you just go on to
style there's a section called touch

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:47.770
style there's a section called touch
 

00:15:47.770 --> 00:15:53.790

of how you should actually style the

of how you should actually style the
 

00:15:57.970 --> 00:16:00.420
of how you should actually style the
different states for touch feedback but

00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:00.430
different states for touch feedback but
 

00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:02.070
different states for touch feedback but
we have some tips I think on the next

00:16:02.070 --> 00:16:02.080
we have some tips I think on the next
 

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:05.400
we have some tips I think on the next
screen yeah so you know the first thing

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:05.410
screen yeah so you know the first thing
 

00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:07.200

I remember is all interactive elements

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:07.210
I remember is all interactive elements
 

00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:09.690
I remember is all interactive elements
should provide feedback lot some of them

00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:09.700
should provide feedback lot some of them
 

00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:11.280
should provide feedback lot some of them
every single one should provide some

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:11.290
every single one should provide some
 

00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:14.040
every single one should provide some
sort of feedback if you like if it does

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:14.050
sort of feedback if you like if it does
 

00:16:14.050 --> 00:16:15.960
sort of feedback if you like if it does
something it should do some it should

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:15.970
something it should do some it should
 

00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:17.100
something it should do some it should
look like it does something when you

00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:17.110
look like it does something when you
 

00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:20.910
look like it does something when you
press it exactly at another point to

press it exactly at another point to
 

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:23.100
press it exactly at another point to
make is you should be consistent so we

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:23.110
make is you should be consistent so we
 

00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:24.690

touch on this again in a second but you
 

00:16:58.150 --> 00:16:59.490
touch on this again in a second but you
should really ensure that the full

on the show there's three different
 

00:20:51.530 --> 00:20:52.810
on the show there's three different
screens here now it's kind of hard to

00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:52.820
screens here now it's kind of hard to
 

00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:55.450
screens here now it's kind of hard to
see in the first screen but there's a

00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:55.460
see in the first screen but there's a
 

00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:58.090
see in the first screen but there's a
great highlight actually on the top left

00:20:58.090 --> 00:20:58.100
great highlight actually on the top left
 

00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:00.190

as all the times I kind of double tapped

00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:02.300
as all the times I kind of double tapped
 

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:03.910

yeah it's kind of hard to take a

00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:07.430
yeah it's kind of hard to take a
 

00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:10.090
yeah it's kind of hard to take a
screenshot at the same time but they've

00:21:10.090 --> 00:21:10.100
screenshot at the same time but they've
 

00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:12.280

got a arm sort of like gray highlight

00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:12.290
got a arm sort of like gray highlight
 

00:21:12.290 --> 00:21:14.110

down and then if you look at these other
 

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:19.480
down and then if you look at these other
screenshots next to it you'll see four

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:19.490
screenshots next to it you'll see four
 

00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:21.460

other items including the action items
 

00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:23.860
other items including the action items
in the action bar we should move an

00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:23.870
in the action bar we should move an
 

00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:25.970
in the action bar we should move an
interview yeah sure let's

00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:25.980
interview yeah sure let's
 

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:28.110

they've got a red highlight so they've

00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:28.120
they've got a red highlight so they've
 

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:29.610
they've got a red highlight so they've
got two different highlights and they

00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:29.620
got two different highlights and they
 

00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:32.010
got two different highlights and they
kind of use them in four different items

00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:32.020
kind of use them in four different items
 

00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:34.410
kind of use them in four different items
across the application so places I guess

00:21:34.410 --> 00:21:34.420
across the application so places I guess
 

00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:36.120
across the application so places I guess
where the early using the you know the

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:36.130
where the early using the you know the
 

00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:39.120

sub trademark Ted red color they'll use

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:39.130
sub trademark Ted red color they'll use
 

00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:40.800
sub trademark Ted red color they'll use
the gray highlight and other places

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:40.810
the gray highlight and other places
 

00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:43.800
the gray highlight and other places
they'll use the red highlight so for

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:43.810
they'll use the red highlight so for
 

00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:46.500
they'll use the red highlight so for
example in this button here which says

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:46.510
example in this button here which says
 

00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:48.060
example in this button here which says
listen to this talk they've got the red

00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:48.070
listen to this talk they've got the red
 

00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:50.940
listen to this talk they've got the red
highlight again and this comes back to

00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:50.950
highlight again and this comes back to
 

00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:52.110
highlight again and this comes back to
that point we're talking about where you

00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:52.120
that point we're talking about where you
 

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:53.190
that point we're talking about where you
should really highlight the entire

00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:53.200
should really highlight the entire
 

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:56.340
should really highlight the entire
touchable area so you'll see here that

00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:56.350
touchable area so you'll see here that
 

00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:57.900
touchable area so you'll see here that
the whole red highlight is covering the

00:21:57.900 --> 00:21:57.910
the whole red highlight is covering the
 

00:21:57.910 --> 00:21:58.980
the whole red highlight is covering the
entire line because you can touch

00:21:58.980 --> 00:21:58.990
entire line because you can touch
 

00:21:58.990 --> 00:22:01.560
entire line because you can touch
anywhere across that entire line yeah so

00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:01.570
anywhere across that entire line yeah so
 

00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:02.790
anywhere across that entire line yeah so
like the first time you touch it you'll

00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:02.800
like the first time you touch it you'll
 

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:04.500
like the first time you touch it you'll
probably touch around the icon or the

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:04.510
probably touch around the icon or the
 

00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:06.630
probably touch around the icon or the
text but then when you see that you know

00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:06.640
text but then when you see that you know
 

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:09.420
text but then when you see that you know
the rest of that row responds in red

00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:09.430
the rest of that row responds in red
 

00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:12.210
the rest of that row responds in red
you'll immediately your brain will will

00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:12.220
you'll immediately your brain will will
 

00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:14.640
you'll immediately your brain will will
internalize the fact that you know this

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:14.650
internalize the fact that you know this
 

00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:16.740
internalize the fact that you know this
whole thing is a single object that you

00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:16.750
whole thing is a single object that you
 

00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:18.120
whole thing is a single object that you
can interact with so it really helps

00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:18.130
can interact with so it really helps
 

00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:21.840
can interact with so it really helps
make that Association yep and I think we

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:21.850
make that Association yep and I think we
 

00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:26.730
make that Association yep and I think we
should move on yeah and then finally to

00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:26.740
should move on yeah and then finally to
 

00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:30.270
should move on yeah and then finally to
other two other types of touch feedback

00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:30.280
other two other types of touch feedback
 

00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:31.680
other two other types of touch feedback
worth mentioning there's boundaries and

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:31.690
worth mentioning there's boundaries and
 

00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:34.740
worth mentioning there's boundaries and
communication so if you look here at the

00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:34.750
communication so if you look here at the
 

00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:36.570
communication so if you look here at the
left screen shot it's kind of hard to

00:22:36.570 --> 00:22:36.580
left screen shot it's kind of hard to
 

00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:38.940
left screen shot it's kind of hard to
see if you get the slides after the show

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:38.950
see if you get the slides after the show
 

00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:40.890
see if you get the slides after the show
you about to see a bit easier but the

00:22:40.890 --> 00:22:40.900
you about to see a bit easier but the
 

00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:42.210
you about to see a bit easier but the
sort of this is showing the edge

00:22:42.210 --> 00:22:42.220
sort of this is showing the edge
 

00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:44.190
sort of this is showing the edge
resistance when you swipe down and

00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:44.200
resistance when you swipe down and
 

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:45.870
resistance when you swipe down and
there's nothing more above the current

00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:45.880
there's nothing more above the current
 

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:48.150
there's nothing more above the current
list so you've got the sort of blue glow

00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:48.160
list so you've got the sort of blue glow
 

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:50.220
list so you've got the sort of blue glow
showing here at the top left in Google

00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:50.230
showing here at the top left in Google
 

00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:52.650

00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:36.020
off right
yeah definitely for sure and then in the

00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:36.030
yeah definitely for sure and then in the
 

00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:38.299
yeah definitely for sure and then in the
second screen shot um it's the gallery

00:23:38.299 --> 00:23:38.309
second screen shot um it's the gallery
 

00:23:38.309 --> 00:23:39.830
second screen shot um it's the gallery
application and when you swipe to the

00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:39.840
application and when you swipe to the
 

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:41.270
application and when you swipe to the
edge here it kind of has a 3d effect

00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:41.280
edge here it kind of has a 3d effect
 

00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:43.160
edge here it kind of has a 3d effect
where all the different thumbnails kind

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:43.170
where all the different thumbnails kind
 

00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:45.140
where all the different thumbnails kind
of tilt to the side again showing

00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:45.150
of tilt to the side again showing
 

00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:48.080
of tilt to the side again showing
resistance so this is more more of a

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:48.090
resistance so this is more more of a
 

00:23:48.090 --> 00:23:50.450
resistance so this is more more of a
custom implementation I guess so you

00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:50.460
custom implementation I guess so you
 

00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:51.650
custom implementation I guess so you
know you can definitely influence

00:23:51.650 --> 00:23:51.660
know you can definitely influence
 

00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:53.890
know you can definitely influence
something custom it's really up to you

00:23:53.890 --> 00:23:53.900

been talking about but depending on the

00:23:57.799 --> 00:23:57.809
been talking about but depending on the
 

00:23:57.809 --> 00:23:59.150
been talking about but depending on the
feel of your application the gallery is

00:23:59.150 --> 00:23:59.160
feel of your application the gallery is
 

00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:01.520
feel of your application the gallery is
very very much of a 3d sort of feel of

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:01.530
very very much of a 3d sort of feel of
 

00:24:01.530 --> 00:24:02.900
very very much of a 3d sort of feel of
an application so that's why it's sort

00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:02.910
an application so that's why it's sort
 

00:24:02.910 --> 00:24:05.180

something kind of similar as well but

00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:06.960
something kind of similar as well but
 

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:11.150
something kind of similar as well but
the whole thing tilts and then finally I

00:24:11.150 --> 00:24:11.160
the whole thing tilts and then finally I
 

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:12.500
the whole thing tilts and then finally I
just wanted to quickly mention this and

00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:12.510
just wanted to quickly mention this and
 

00:24:12.510 --> 00:24:14.000
just wanted to quickly mention this and
this is fairly advanced I can't imagine

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:14.010
this is fairly advanced I can't imagine
 

00:24:14.010 --> 00:24:16.730

without actually completing the swipe it

00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:35.580
without actually completing the swipe it
 

00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:37.310
without actually completing the swipe it
will fade back in again so this is just

00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:37.320
will fade back in again so this is just
 

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:40.400
will fade back in again so this is just
sort of hinting to the user that this

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:40.410

00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:10.330
facades and all this cool new you know
3d maps stuff in your app you should

00:27:10.330 --> 00:27:10.340
3d maps stuff in your app you should
 

00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:12.490
3d maps stuff in your app you should
definitely switch over to this from the

00:27:12.490 --> 00:27:12.500
definitely switch over to this from the
 

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:14.710
definitely switch over to this from the
original map view and this also works

00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:14.720
original map view and this also works
 

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:17.740
original map view and this also works
for works with fragments and support

00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:17.750
for works with fragments and support
 

00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:18.909
for works with fragments and support
library fragments as well so you get a

00:27:18.909 --> 00:27:18.919
library fragments as well so you get a
 

00:27:18.919 --> 00:27:20.680
library fragments as well so you get a
lot of the benefits basically

00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:20.690
lot of the benefits basically
 

00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:22.029
lot of the benefits basically
everybody's been asking for this and

00:27:22.029 --> 00:27:22.039
everybody's been asking for this and
 

00:27:22.039 --> 00:27:24.460
everybody's been asking for this and
finally we're able to the big water yeah

00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:24.470
finally we're able to the big water yeah
 

00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:26.409
finally we're able to the big water yeah
I'm but if it for designers I guess the

00:27:26.409 --> 00:27:26.419
I'm but if it for designers I guess the
 

00:27:26.419 --> 00:27:28.269
I'm but if it for designers I guess the
key takeaways you now have maps kind of

00:27:28.269 --> 00:27:28.279
key takeaways you now have maps kind of
 

00:27:28.279 --> 00:27:29.440
key takeaways you now have maps kind of
threw out the application if you're a

00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:29.450
threw out the application if you're a
 

00:27:29.450 --> 00:27:31.119

developers have complained and set out

00:27:31.119 --> 00:27:31.129
developers have complained and set out
 

00:27:31.129 --> 00:27:32.350

that's really hard to do that's no

00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:32.360
that's really hard to do that's no
 

00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:34.060
that's really hard to do that's no
longer the case as well as having some

00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:34.070
longer the case as well as having some
 

00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:36.100
longer the case as well as having some
pretty advanced features as well right

00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:36.110
pretty advanced features as well right
 

00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:38.049
pretty advanced features as well right
like so having a custom overlays and

00:27:38.049 --> 00:27:38.059
like so having a custom overlays and
 

00:27:38.059 --> 00:27:40.509
like so having a custom overlays and
different shapes and boundary boxes or

00:27:40.509 --> 00:27:40.519
different shapes and boundary boxes or
 

00:27:40.519 --> 00:27:42.419
different shapes and boundary boxes or
and so forth its really really allows

00:27:42.419 --> 00:27:42.429
and so forth its really really allows
 

00:27:42.429 --> 00:27:43.710
and so forth its really really allows
for any really cool interactions with

00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:43.720
for any really cool interactions with
 

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:45.210
for any really cool interactions with
having maps yeah I'm really excited

00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:45.220
having maps yeah I'm really excited
 

00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:47.190
having maps yeah I'm really excited
about the different angles and panning

00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:47.200
about the different angles and panning
 

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:48.600
about the different angles and panning
and tilting that you can do I think

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:48.610
and tilting that you can do I think
 

00:27:48.610 --> 00:27:49.710
and tilting that you can do I think
that's going to work really nicely with

00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:49.720
that's going to work really nicely with
 

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:51.930
that's going to work really nicely with
some of the apps that are out there and

00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:51.940
some of the apps that are out there and
 

00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:53.519
some of the apps that are out there and
remember you can cost you can design

00:27:53.519 --> 00:27:53.529
remember you can cost you can design
 

00:27:53.529 --> 00:27:56.159
remember you can cost you can design
custom marker icon so you know the

00:27:56.159 --> 00:27:56.169
custom marker icon so you know the
 

00:27:56.169 --> 00:27:57.960
custom marker icon so you know the
marker icons don't have to look like the

00:27:57.960 --> 00:27:57.970
marker icons don't have to look like the
 

00:27:57.970 --> 00:28:00.210
marker icons don't have to look like the
teardrop shape or a little circle shape

00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:00.220
teardrop shape or a little circle shape
 

00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:02.279
teardrop shape or a little circle shape
it could really you know represent it

00:28:02.279 --> 00:28:02.289
it could really you know represent it
 

00:28:02.289 --> 00:28:04.440
it could really you know represent it
could be it could use your branding if

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:04.450
could be it could use your branding if
 

00:28:04.450 --> 00:28:06.210
could be it could use your branding if
you want you know it could be a custom

00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:06.220
you want you know it could be a custom
 

00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:08.509
you want you know it could be a custom
shape or whatnot so lots of options are

00:28:08.509 --> 00:28:08.519
shape or whatnot so lots of options are
 

00:28:08.519 --> 00:28:12.840
