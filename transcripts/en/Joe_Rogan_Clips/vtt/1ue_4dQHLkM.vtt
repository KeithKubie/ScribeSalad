00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.430
Hello Freak bitches.
Yeah.
Most people think Oj did.

2
00:00:05.431 --> 00:00:08.120
It does a few people that think like I heard the crazy ones like,
oh,

3
00:00:08.121 --> 00:00:09.930
j son did it or something like that.
I'm like,

4
00:00:09.931 --> 00:00:13.590
why I'm so balls deep in the Oj stuff.
Anything he does,
I watch it.

5
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.450
But like I said,
my brother went,
God,
I Went,
God,

6
00:00:18.451 --> 00:00:21.360
I wish I really knew the truth about o j and j my brother looks at me goes,

7
00:00:21.361 --> 00:00:24.330
are you shitting me?
Like,
we all know the truth,
man.

8
00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.930
But people put all these different stories out there where you're like,
God,

9
00:00:27.931 --> 00:00:31.440
maybe he didn't do it,
but I just want to know for a fact like that.
Like what?

10
00:00:31.441 --> 00:00:34.260
How did it really go down?
Do you think he's ever going to come out and be like,

11
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.420
listen,
no,
no,
I don't think he did.

12
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.580
I don't think he necessarily remembers anymore.

13
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.380
You think it was just in a frenzy?

14
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:45.560
I think it's entirely possible that he's a sociopath and a narcissist with brain

15
00:00:45.631 --> 00:00:47.220
trauma.
Yeah.
Trauma.

16
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.180
And I think that a lot of times narcissists and sociopaths like to that degree,

17
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.110
like he's just charming the world.
Hey,
I'm Oj Simpson.
I'm a good guy.

18
00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.460
I've always been a good guy.
I basically the conflict free life.
Yeah.

19
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.300
I just want to go be with my family.
Got sounds like a man.

20
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.160
He's got a weird thing going on man.

21
00:01:05.161 --> 00:01:08.430
Like he's trying to paint this image all day long of him being a good guy.

22
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.110
Meanwhile he's got these demons and knows dad was gay and I said that's why he

23
00:01:13.111 --> 00:01:16.570
would beat like a lot like you so upset about that.
See,
I don't trust that guy,

24
00:01:16.571 --> 00:01:21.090
but when he gave that,
uh,
yeah,
he's like snapped at the judge.

25
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.080
Yeah.

26
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.140
Like it was super weird and you definitely shouldn't do that when you're trying

27
00:01:25.141 --> 00:01:28.830
to get what he got upset about something that I'm on something.
He's like,

28
00:01:28.831 --> 00:01:32.310
I said I wasn't there or something like that.
Yeah,
yeah.
I forget what it was,

29
00:01:32.311 --> 00:01:35.460
but like that Las Vegas Room definitely didn't handle it well.
Who?
Look man,

30
00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.210
when you're a man and you're locked up with other men,
you know,

31
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.140
as prisoners all day long forever.
It's just,

32
00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:44.910
it's a horrific existence.

33
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.350
It's amazing that he was able to get through it at all and then still pull off

34
00:01:49.351 --> 00:01:52.140
that kind of charm and not can only do slide.
Yeah.

35
00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.160
They said he was killing it in the,
like he was the prime example of a,

36
00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.270
of a prisoner and it was like he started organizing church groups and like

37
00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.840
feeding everyone's lunches and like,
he was cool.
Wow.

38
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.840
Well find meaning in that shit.
I wonder if you'd like,

39
00:02:06.841 --> 00:02:10.680
has like a deep what's going on?
Chloe's dad.
Yeah.

40
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:14.110
A lot of people think he's closed.
That get the fuck Outta here.
What?

41
00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.750
Chloe's not half black.
Uh,
well they just don't love black guys.

42
00:02:18.751 --> 00:02:23.580
They is that what it is?
Hmm.
Some people do both.
And you know,

43
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.420
Oj was super close with strong rumour Claudette.
She had strong rumor.

44
00:02:27.421 --> 00:02:31.980
That strong rumor.
No one be surprised.
Uh,
I would,

45
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.090
well,
my point was like what kind of memory of the event?
Okay.

46
00:02:39.091 --> 00:02:42.540
We both agree he did it right.
So if he did it,
what kind of memory does he have?

47
00:02:42.541 --> 00:02:44.190
Do you,
do you remember sticking the knife in them?

48
00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.970
[inaudible] I remember that traumatic event or I wonder,
I wonder,

49
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.150
I wonder if you're a sociopath and I wonder if you've been telling people for

50
00:02:51.151 --> 00:02:55.530
all these years that you're innocent.
[inaudible] trying to find the real killer.

51
00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.650
I'm trying to get out and find the real killer.

52
00:02:58.651 --> 00:03:01.600
Everyone's all not once did he bring up the real killer.

53
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.810
I'm trying to find my wife's killer.
The reason why,
I mean,

54
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.430
he never said that during like any of the parole thing when he can't get out.

55
00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.340
Oh No,
not on my wife's killer.
Yeah.
Never on this.
Someone killed my wife.

56
00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:17.230
That ship's sailed was not me.
I'm being tried for it.
I'm being unjustly accused.

57
00:03:17.231 --> 00:03:21.910
He does say that the case that I lost,
he came out with a book.
If I did it.
Yeah,

58
00:03:21.911 --> 00:03:24.490
he was going to,
but he didn't release that book.

59
00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:29.080
I thought he did know all the proceeds went to the,
the goal.
No.
Um,

60
00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:30.220
I believe,

61
00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.270
I'm pretty sure that the publishing company backed out of that price.

62
00:03:34.271 --> 00:03:38.140
Smart on their part.
Yeah.
You can't do that,
dude.

63
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.910
Will you have him on the podcast?

64
00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:42.470
<v 1>Oh,</v>

65
00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.670
<v 0>I don't know if he would do it,
but if he did do it.
Yeah,
I have mine.</v>

66
00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.560
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah,
I'd have done mine.
I did it
straight up.

67
00:03:54.561 --> 00:03:57.560
IDF is right.
It's hidden right there.
Remember?
That's what they did.
Oh,

68
00:03:57.561 --> 00:03:58.394
that's right.

69
00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.440
If I did it in the eye now on Amazon by Oj Simpson.

70
00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.630
Jesus Christ.
That's,
that's still,

71
00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.980
I thought they pulled that confessions of the killer in all caps.

72
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.930
Oh,
that there Goldman and Kim Goldman.
Nick.
That's how it happened.
They had to,

73
00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.840
they're,
they're getting all the money,
all the money,
but in did he really?

74
00:04:20.841 --> 00:04:25.210
Right.
The full story and what are the rights to them?
Yeah,

75
00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:26.840
because double jeopardy,
right.

76
00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:31.760
Make money off the crime is sort of what it is.
How much money do,

77
00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:33.710
and also they have a civil case against him.

78
00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.000
How much money do you think he made off that book?
Got You.

79
00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.770
Don't make that much money off books unless you're just fucking,

80
00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.360
you do feel like Bill O'reilly,
j k Rawlins or some shit.
Yeah.

81
00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.940
If you're writing books like old people read by a lot of books.

82
00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.720
If I did it,
we kind of know how you do it.
If he did it,

83
00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.980
if I need to read the two knife,
both of them go to Chicago,

84
00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.310
called the lawyers come back,
come back,
act dumb.

85
00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:03.900
Rinse Kardashian helps me out.
Rinse,
repeat.
Does it say how many books,

86
00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:09.020
how many books they sold?
I got to think it was not much.

87
00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:11.570
I don't even know it was out and I'm all about this.

88
00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.870
He got some sort of crazy settlement.
Right?

89
00:05:14.871 --> 00:05:18.470
It was like a $35 million settlement or something.
33 million.

90
00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:20.930
But how much has he been paid?

91
00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:27.750
I used to know is um,
um,
Ron Goldman sister.
Really?

92
00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:31.140
Yeah.
How'd you know her?
She worked,
um,

93
00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:35.490
on something that I did for,
she was very nice.
Very cool check.

94
00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:40.520
Brian ran into the dad in Phoenix selling men's shirts.

95
00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:45.390
Flight.
What's the big paws nuns?
I was trying to think what his cell selling,

96
00:05:45.391 --> 00:05:47.820
but I remember selling like men's golf shirts or some shit.

97
00:05:47.821 --> 00:05:51.840
Like the struggle is real for Ron Goldman,
you know,
like game over,

98
00:05:51.841 --> 00:05:53.970
you lose a child and it goes down like that.

99
00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:58.610
Just to just hard believe that that guy is now going to get out.
What do you do?

100
00:05:58.611 --> 00:06:01.980
I mean you only got so certain amount of time left on this planet.
I,

101
00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.790
I'd probably get a hand.
I'd probably,
yeah,
Hammer,

102
00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:08.470
but it's gonna be tough to get Oj still pretty athletic and black.
So I would,

103
00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:11.810
I'd probably get a gun and when he gets out,

104
00:06:11.811 --> 00:06:14.750
drive down to Florida or if he comes back to Brentwood skin,

105
00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:17.450
make it super easy on you and probably shoot him.

106
00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:23.010
Could be headed to reality TV.
And when I called,
Oh my God,

107
00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.730
I've watched that documentary about them comply.

108
00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:30.110
I completely forgot about all the weird stuff he was doing before he did go to

109
00:06:30.111 --> 00:06:34.040
jail show in Vegas where you had,
I didn't even know about it.

110
00:06:34.041 --> 00:06:37.210
Seeing it on the documentary shows everything I did to wrap.
Yeah.

111
00:06:37.211 --> 00:06:40.450
You gotta rap still rap after he murdered his wife.
Oh yes.
Before,

112
00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:44.150
right before he went to jail and like 2005 or six innocent.

113
00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:46.750
I'm innocent.

114
00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:51.760
He was like the guys,
of course.

115
00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:55.390
Yeah.
I'm innocent.
[inaudible] good.

116
00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:59.450
We're going to get pulled off of youtube for the Oj Simpson.
No Way.
Look at this.

117
00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:04.190

119
00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:16.370

That'll get taken down problem.

127
00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:55.110
Now if few play just the audio.
No Way.

128
00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:59.820
Oj Simpson get juiced.
What year did this happen?

129
00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:03.150
Like 2004 2005

130
00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:04.403
<v 1>yeah.</v>

131
00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:07.010
<v 0>This is insane.</v>

132
00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:14.270
This is insane.
It's all these girls taking their pants off.

133
00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:16.790
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:21.260

Oh my God.</v>

135
00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:26.780
He did it.
He did a fucking prank show after he murdered two people.

136
00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:31.720
He's got a midget on his lap.
This is insane.
I can't believe it.

137
00:08:31.721 --> 00:08:34.790
I've seen this.
Oh my God.
All you player haters.

138
00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:41.240
Get on your knees and get some of these,
and then grabbed his crotch.
He said,

139
00:08:41.241 --> 00:08:43.550

140
00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:45.903
<v 1>And you,</v>

141
00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:49.640
<v 0>and you got to think,
is this 2005 is that what you said?</v>

142
00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:54.830
So he's gotta be like 60 years old when this is happening.
Damn.

143
00:08:54.831 --> 00:08:56.220
It only has 15,000

144
00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:59.700
<v 2>views on youtube.
Check in and in a couple of days</v>

145
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.510
we just helps the juice.
Don't think people knew about that.

146
00:09:04.511 --> 00:09:07.770
Another reason he needs to come on the Goddamn podcast.
Yeah.
Maybe to him.

147
00:09:07.771 --> 00:09:11.490
Come on dressed like Elvis again.
No,
no.
Maybe we'll come on just as white face.

148
00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:14.880
God Damn.
This is nuts.
He's a terrible person.
Yeah.

149
00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:17.720
I wonder if he was like,
look,
I really,

150
00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:21.420
I make money and so on through this idea at him.
Look at them with a do ragging.

151
00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:25.470
Yeah.
Don't piss them off though.
Very strange.

152
00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:30.600
So you did a Bingo at like a
old people home or something.

153
00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:32.890
<v 0>Oh my gosh.
Struggle is real.</v>

154
00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:40.070
This is so strange.
I can't believe this.

155
00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:47.790
It was rap song where it's like it's hard in the streets in La.
That is true.

156
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.790
Yeah.
He was like a legit wrap flung though.
This is the remix.
Jamie.

157
00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:53.250
He's got a good point.
Both of them are good.

158
00:09:55.650 --> 00:10:00.470
We don't need to watch anymore on a terrible person.
I wonder what he's,

159
00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:03.390
I mean,
I feel like a guy like that probably like would do anything.

160
00:10:03.391 --> 00:10:03.920
It's like these get,

161
00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:06.270
we've got to figure out some way to do and who's going to be working with them?

162
00:10:06.271 --> 00:10:09.390
You're not going to get like the top minds of Hollywood.
Fuck no,

163
00:10:09.391 --> 00:10:13.140
no one's still him.
I mean,
he might pop up on some reality show,
but dude,

164
00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:14.970
a matching those hoes,

165
00:10:14.971 --> 00:10:17.460
they were saying he was getting more women than ever when he got out,

166
00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:19.470
when he was out of trial,

167
00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:24.370
they still went to Florida and was just dicking girls down now,
like resell,

168
00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:25.443
<v 3>killing it.</v>

169
00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:28.380
<v 0>What ties got out?
What type of sites</v>

170
00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:28.930
<v 3>co</v>

171
00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:31.690
<v 0>chicks are hooking up with Oj right now?
Skanks</v>

172
00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:39.810
<v 3>okay.
[inaudible].</v>
