00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.340
MARK HOFNER: Thanks
everyone for coming today.

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.840
For those of you that don't
know me, my name is Mark Hofner.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:12.780
I work as--

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.230
AUDIENCE: Woohoo.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.540
MARK HOFNER: I got one
fan-- as a software engineer

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:21.710
over in the travel
space here in Cambridge.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.570
So I have the honor today
of introducing and hosting

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.440
John Werner, who's here
to talk to us today.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.670
John comes from the
Camera Culture group

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.900
over at the MIT Media Lab.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.890
And unlike a lot of
Googlers here in Cambridge,

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.120
I have only known John
since very recently.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.830
There are several other folks
that have known him for years.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.950
But I met John a month or two
ago at a Rotary Club meeting

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.770
where he presented some
similar content to today.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.580
And the one thing that I
was kind of impressed with

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.620
was-- ideas and
everything are great.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.704
We hear a lot of
ideas all the time.

00:00:59.704 --> 00:01:01.620
But one of the things
that you don't often see

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.300
is the energy behind it.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.610
And so I ask that you give
John your undivided attention.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.160
Because the one thing that I
came away from when he spoke

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.210
was how inspired I was again,
especially for those of us

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.070
who do a lot of volunteer
work or have a passion

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.350
for education-based learning.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.240
So without further ado, let
me introduce John Werner.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.626
Please come on up, John,
and welcome to Google.

00:01:29.626 --> 00:01:32.422
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:34.809 --> 00:01:36.184
JOHN WERNER: Great,
thanks, Mark.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:40.840
So I'm a dad.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.180
And this is my son Matteo.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.650
And Matteo is a curious soul.

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.790
And as parents, there are
these moments of crisis.

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.720
Am I doing a good job?

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.920
My wife and I, we wonder,
should we be doing more?

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.020
Are we screwing our kid up?

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.490
And when you're a
parent, you think about,

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.840
well, what are the things
that influenced you?

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.070
So if I want my
son to be curious,

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.880
what facilitated my curiosity?

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.150
And so I think back to my dad.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:13.580
He's wearing the
light blue polyester

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.100
shorts-- kind of embarrassing,
but not in the '70s.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.670
And so one thing that was
unique in my upbringing

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.660
was I would go to
friends' houses,

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.520
because both my parents worked.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.490
And my dad would pick me up
at the end of the evening.

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.660
And the way we got home
was we would run home.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.750
We didn't take a
bus, a cab, a subway.

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.050
We always would run home.

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.640
And sometimes we'd cut across
many different neighborhoods.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.610
And as this kid, it was
just fascinating to see

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.200
the transitions
in neighborhoods.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.670
This is pre-eBay.

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.240
And people would
throw things out.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.240
Like I remember
rolling-- literally

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.330
rolling-- a manhole cover home.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.480
Because I said, Dad, that
would be a great table.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.810
And it was.

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.360
And it is to this day.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.150
And so I think back
to what facilitated my

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.760
looking at the city and
saying, look at all this stuff.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.150
I think those runs-- a big part.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.270
The other thing I noticed
was that as I started

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:09.670
going to this one
friend's house,

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.510
Nicky Seaver-- he was
Tom Seaver's cousin--

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.590
we would run home a
different way each time.

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.870
And I realized that
there's an infinite number

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.120
of ways to do something.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.210
And as a six-year-old,
as an eight-year-old,

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:25.150
that was a big aha.

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.750
And that may not
always be efficient.

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.550
But I think that
kind of shaped me.

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.960
For people who know
me, you'll get that.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.450
So when I moved to Boston, kind
of like exploring the city,

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.120
I wanted to unleash
that interest,

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.356
that sense of that
experience, for young people.

00:03:43.356 --> 00:03:44.980
Inner city middle
schoolers we realized

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.270
were getting out
of school at 1:30

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:50.450
so the buses could rotate back
to get the elementary school

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:51.200
kids home.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.060
So these sixth, seventh,
and eighth graders

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.380
were out on the streets
getting into no good.

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.270
And we said, let's
get the best of Boston

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:01.960
to share their passion.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.620
And this is our logo.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.290
And I remember when we
created it, I was thinking,

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:07.740
it's like the streets.

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.410
And we're building a better
city by getting volunteers

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.162
to share either what they love
at work or share their passion,

00:04:14.162 --> 00:04:15.620
because they don't
love their work.

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.490
And they bring it to kids.

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:21.492
So we started this like
a week after Netscape.

00:04:21.492 --> 00:04:23.700
Some of you weren't even
born when Netscape came out.

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.590
But we were sort
of pre-internet.

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.090
I remember our first
offices, we were selling air,

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.854
and we ran out of
Kinko's for a long time.

00:04:29.854 --> 00:04:31.270
But when we got
our first offices,

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:32.550
we didn't even have email.

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.010
And then I think we had one
AOL account that a few of us

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.810
could use.

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.660
But we were pre-internet
when we did this.

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.080
And we scaled it.

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.260
And we became the Google
of the nonprofit space.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.620
And we'd use our
Rolodexes to find the best

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.790
and brightest to teach.

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:50.680
And so we'd have kids learn
physics by holding a mallet

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.420
and breaking it while a
guy was on a bed of nails.

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.550
I mean, what better
way to learn physics.

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:57.050
And we did this
collaborative stuff.

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:58.560
So you couldn't see
who was leading.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.550
It was like teamwork.

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:01.800
And here's a dad.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.250
This is Yves.

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.320
Two years in the
country from Nigeria.

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.840
And you may know Yves, because
if you fly through the Delta

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.160
terminal in New Jersey
in Newark, he's your guy.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.330
And Yves said to
me, John, thank you.

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.220
My twins each take four
of these apprenticeships

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.280
from amazing, talented people.

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.980
And they have such
interesting things

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:25.420
to talk about at home now.

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.950
It made coming to this
country worthwhile.

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:29.630
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.070
So I was like, oh wow,
we've got to do better.

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:36.740
We've got to keep delivering
for dads and moms and guardians

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:37.640
like Yves.

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.420
So I said, where are the
best and the brightest?

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:42.170
They're at Google.

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:44.130
So we got Alan to teach.

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:47.160
And he taught like six
semesters in a row.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.702
But then I was
getting suspicious.

00:05:48.702 --> 00:05:50.410
This engineer, I was
like, wait a second,

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:51.870
does he have any friends?

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.530
He's not able to get any
other Googlers to teach.

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:55.560
I'm like, I don't know.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.150
Is he ostracized or
something at work?

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:01.780
So I went to a guy named Steve
Vinter-- very powerful dude.

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:02.830
He's my guardian angel.

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:04.290
I love this guy.

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:06.080
And I said, let's do a meeting.

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.290
And Steve was very wise.

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:10.737
He said, do you know 99%
of the revenue at Google

00:06:10.737 --> 00:06:13.070
is not from the engineers,
but it's from the ads people?

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:15.150
I think it's now down to 98%.

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:18.487
That's because Steve's been even
more productive the last year.

00:06:18.487 --> 00:06:21.070
And he said, let's get the ads
people and the engineer people.

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:23.290
And it was on an anniversary
of around this week

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:24.280
a few years back.

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.300
We got 50 people in a room.

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.250
And I said to them,
take out your iPhones.

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:30.930
No one moved.

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:32.820
I said, take out your
Android smartphones,

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:34.390
and people pulled it out.

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:37.580
And I said, text your
interest, your passion.

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:40.410
And real time we threw
it up on the screen.

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:42.197
And so you see
there's lock picking.

00:06:42.197 --> 00:06:43.780
There's sailing, a
lot of good things.

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:46.020
One of them is volleyball.

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:48.870
And Bob Castle, who's touring
some muckety muck right now

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:51.729
around the Google campus,
he saw volleyball.

00:06:51.729 --> 00:06:54.270
And I think he was embarrassed
and didn't even text anything.

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:57.010
But he was like, I'm
passionate about volleyball.

00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:58.830
And then for a week
after that meeting,

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:00.930
he was searching for
that volleyball persons.

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:02.470
It's like Cinderella,
but different.

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:05.139
And he taught a bunch of
volleyball apprenticeships.

00:07:05.139 --> 00:07:06.680
So maybe that says
something about he

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:07.930
didn't want to bring
his work to the kids,

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:09.221
he wanted to bring his passion.

00:07:09.221 --> 00:07:11.280
I don't know, you can
ask him about that.

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:15.120
So here's some of the kids over
the years that built robots.

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:20.590
And Alan had kids save a
person from a burning building.

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:21.490
It's in LEGO.

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:23.899
It's not really
burning, but it was fun.

00:07:23.899 --> 00:07:25.940
Here's some of the ads
people teaching marketing,

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:28.360
how to market yourself.

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:29.700
Here's computer stuff.

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:31.270
And look at this picture.

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:34.122
Is the apprentice more
excited, or is the Googler

00:07:34.122 --> 00:07:35.580
more excited about
this Chromebook?

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.947
What do you think?

00:07:37.947 --> 00:07:39.780
That was an early version
of the Chromebook.

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:42.440
Here are the chefs
teaching cooking.

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:46.120
What better way to teach
cooking than have a Google chef

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:47.780
kind of share their passion?

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:49.210
And then there's
Bob and his team.

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:50.543
He finally got into some coding.

00:07:50.543 --> 00:07:52.880
He moved on from volleyball.

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:54.280
And we did all these big events.

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:56.400
But one of the best
things about working

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:59.480
at Citizen Schools
for 1,000 weeks

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:03.030
is that I was Steve Vinter's
personal photographer.

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:04.870
And I got to follow him around.

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:07.230
I feel like this
is like the Beatles

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:08.530
when they were just coming out.

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:12.280
I took pictures of him with
students and talking to people.

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:15.140
And I got pictures of his
wife and his daughter.

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:18.230
And he was just great.

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:21.020
And so I want to thank Steve
Vinter for this opportunity.

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:22.225
Steve, are you in the room?

00:08:22.225 --> 00:08:23.350
Steve, are you in the room?

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:24.282
STEVE VINTER: No, I'm not.

00:08:24.282 --> 00:08:26.448
JOHN WERNER: Yeah, OK, could
you just stand and bow?

00:08:26.448 --> 00:08:28.520
I just want to acknowledge you.

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:29.250
Can you stand?

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:31.350
Yeah, so this is a great leader.

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:32.380
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:36.299
Yeah, so a guy who took
this outpost, which

00:08:36.299 --> 00:08:39.350
was like half a person,
to now you're like 1,200

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:42.669
strong and have like the 70
plus offices around the world.

00:08:42.669 --> 00:08:44.774
My bed is your number three.

00:08:44.774 --> 00:08:46.190
And Mountain View
better watch out

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:47.939
because of the creativity
that comes here.

00:08:47.939 --> 00:08:49.930
And a lot of it has to
do with your leadership.

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:51.250
And congratulations.

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:54.970
And the world is a better
place because of that.

00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:57.720
So the other thing about
working at Citizen Schools

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.190
was I got to go to
this conference.

00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:01.557
It's called the FRED Conference.

00:09:01.557 --> 00:09:02.140
That's a joke.

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:04.430
If it was FRED--
no, it's called TED.

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:06.120
And TED is awesome.

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:08.720
And it's like 31
years old today.

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:11.520
Richard Saul Wurman
started it in '84.

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:14.110
And it's Technology
Entertainment Design.

00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:17.170
It was about doing a soiree
not that much bigger than this

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:20.710
in the early days where
interdisciplinary talks would

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:21.630
take place.

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:22.950
And you get creative people.

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:27.370
I see Mr. [? Wren ?] presented,
one of your Googlers,

00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:29.020
at our event.

00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:31.900
You get people like that
kind of sharing ideas.

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:35.920
And in the early days,
these were 18 minute talks.

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:38.770
And that was a short format.

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:41.060
And Chris Anderson
bought the event.

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:43.180
He had published "Business 2.0."

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:44.340
He sold it on paper.

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:45.030
He was rich.

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:47.040
It was before one
of those bubbles.

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:49.260
And he flipped TED
into a nonprofit.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.820
And he said, let's take these
short videos, these 18 minute

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:53.595
videos, and get them on TV.

00:09:53.595 --> 00:09:55.460
And I have this
image of him going

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:58.065
to like all the different
networks or whatever.

00:09:58.065 --> 00:09:59.164
And they all said, no.

00:09:59.164 --> 00:10:00.330
No one's going to want this.

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:01.454
This is like a bran muffin.

00:10:01.454 --> 00:10:03.100
Who wants this stuff?

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:06.010
And like in "Pretty
Woman," big mistake.

00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:08.560
Because what he did was he
went to this little-known thing

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:11.680
in 2006 called
YouTube, and he started

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:13.450
putting these things online.

00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:17.930
And today, three billion people
have watched just 2,000 talks.

00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:20.660
And it's the third most
respected media property

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:21.160
online.

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:22.701
I see the publisher,
former publisher

00:10:22.701 --> 00:10:25.910
for "The Globe," who did a
heck of a job leading that

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:28.240
at a time when the
industry was changing.

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:30.690
And boy, wouldn't you wish
you had those kind of numbers

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:32.570
back when you were doing that?

00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:34.070
So TED is just killing it.

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:38.580
And in 2006, Chris said,
I want to put the talks

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:39.300
online for free.

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:40.910
And everyone said,
no, don't do it.

00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:43.170
Everyone-- and I've talked
to him about this-- said,

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:43.890
that's stupid.

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:45.640
No one will come to
our conferences, which

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:47.010
are ridiculously expensive.

00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:49.300
You could put a down payment
on a house or two houses

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:51.550
for how much it costs to
go to these conferences.

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:54.680
So in 2009, Chris had another
idea that everyone on his team

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:56.140
said, no, this is crazy.

00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:57.870
He said, let's
give away licenses

00:10:57.870 --> 00:11:00.400
so people can self-organize
and show my video.

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:01.150
He was a marketer.

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:04.340
He thought this was a
way to move his product.

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:06.260
What he didn't
realize was people

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.010
were hungry to curate
interesting speakers

00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:11.340
like Barmak or
Rohan or Albert, who

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:17.160
are all speakers in the past,
and that there was a big desire

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:18.870
for this kind of content.

00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:21.490
So I've been to 10 of
these TED conferences.

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:24.380
They fill up in 15 minutes
a year ahead of time.

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:25.880
I remember the first
one I want to I

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:29.290
was in between a former governor
of Colorado, who you would

00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:31.600
recognize, and Jeff Bezos.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:34.910
And I got sent
something saying, you've

00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:36.550
been accepted for next year.

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:38.660
Are you ready to pay the $8,500?

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:41.110
And I'm like, I haven't
even experienced this year.

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:43.200
How do I know if I want
to pay for next year?

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:47.360
And yeah, so how many
places can kind of do that?

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:49.060
But TED's a pretty
special place.

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:50.893
And it's harder to get
into than the Oscars,

00:11:50.893 --> 00:11:53.019
and a lot of interesting
conversations happen here.

00:11:53.019 --> 00:11:55.143
And I would go here and
talk about Citizen Schools.

00:11:55.143 --> 00:11:56.800
I'd talk about
democratizing learning

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:59.960
and how this Citizen Schools
idea was one of the top 10

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:02.190
ideas 100 years from now
that'll kind of change

00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:03.120
the vector of society.

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:05.470
And I would talk to people who
invented the personal computer,

00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:06.360
or Sergey and Larry.

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:08.020
And you guys know
who those people are.

00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:09.760
And it was just awesome.

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:14.330
But one challenge-- I would
come home from this week away,

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:19.400
and I'd see my kids--
Javie, Lucia, Matteo.

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:20.920
And I synced this
picture from when

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:22.425
I came back from the first one.

00:12:22.425 --> 00:12:24.180
And I'd have all this
interesting stuff

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:25.950
I'd want to share with my kids.

00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:30.950
And my kids would say, Daddy,
are you part of a cult?

00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:32.580
Why do you leave us?

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:35.460
Do you love us?

00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:39.300
And it got me thinking, how
can we bring the best of TED

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:42.790
into our own zip codes, and how
can we make it family friendly?

00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:43.920
I care a lot about my kids.

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:47.820
A lot of you care about
the next generation.

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:49.820
So a few of us incorporated.

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:52.330
And I see Bruce, one of
our board members here.

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:55.150
And I don't know if
you know, but when

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:59.150
Chris Anderson, who grew up
the son of a missionary doctor,

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:01.735
when he bought TED,
he added a tagline--

00:13:01.735 --> 00:13:05.200
"Ideas worth spreading."

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:09.470
And I think that's a good line.

00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:11.610
But I said, let's go a power up.

00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:13.340
Let's do, "Ideas in action."

00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:17.180
And this logo is,
let's 10x those ideas.

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:18.570
Let's 10x the community.

00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:22.019
And let's not just sit
in auditoriums like this.

00:13:22.019 --> 00:13:23.310
Let's get out in the community.

00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:24.920
So I don't know if
you see that arrow.

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:25.929
But it's subtle.

00:13:25.929 --> 00:13:26.720
You may not see it.

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:28.344
You've got to stare,
and you'll see it.

00:13:28.344 --> 00:13:30.860
But say, let's get
in the community.

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:33.402
And so this is my kids' school.

00:13:33.402 --> 00:13:35.610
And a lot of these TEDxes--
I don't know if you know.

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:39.360
There are 13,000
TEDx licenses today.

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:43.870
Every day there are like 50
TEDxes around the planet.

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:48.490
Of the 13,000, a lot
of them are focused

00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:51.660
on getting the biggest
and fanciest venue.

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:54.370
The Sydney Opera House
is one, Carnegie Hall.

00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:57.910
And a big portion of the budgets
for these events goes for that.

00:13:57.910 --> 00:13:59.279
And I'm notoriously cheap.

00:13:59.279 --> 00:14:00.820
And I didn't want
to spend any money.

00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:02.230
I thought I could get
everything in kinded.

00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:03.604
So I went to the
school district.

00:14:03.604 --> 00:14:05.077
I said, hey, I've got this idea.

00:14:05.077 --> 00:14:07.160
Like Warren Buffett says,
invest in what you know.

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:09.020
And I live two blocks
from this building.

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:10.320
This is my kids' school.

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:12.160
Graham Gund designed
it, beautiful school.

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:14.800
It's right behind the Audi
dealership right off Route 9

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:17.650
near the reservoir,
27% low income kids,

00:14:17.650 --> 00:14:19.490
a lot of children
of power brokers

00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:21.210
also here from the Boston area.

00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:23.460
And I said to the school,
hey, can I get the building?

00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:24.840
And they said, sure.

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:26.840
And so that's when I
was off to the races.

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:30.110
And the auditorium
holds 290 people.

00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:31.630
So it's a little auditorium.

00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:33.290
And I made the event free.

00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:34.940
And tons of people signed up.

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:38.830
We had 2,700 people
at our last event.

00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:41.569
And I said to the people,
it's a free event.

00:14:41.569 --> 00:14:43.110
But if you come,
you've got to spread

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:44.710
the ideas that are on stage.

00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:49.680
So if our illustrious speakers
have something worth saying,

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:51.839
or if you combine some of
the ideas into something,

00:14:51.839 --> 00:14:53.130
you've got to get it out there.

00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:54.900
And I said, let's try
to hit 2 million views

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:55.649
in our first year.

00:14:55.649 --> 00:14:57.070
And everyone said,
can't be done.

00:14:57.070 --> 00:14:59.200
I said, let's hit 10 million
views in our second year.

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:00.325
People said, can't be done.

00:15:00.325 --> 00:15:03.000
We had 10,000 soda cans-- there
was a big debate whether they

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.116
should be in school-- as a
backdrop as a metaphor to say,

00:15:06.116 --> 00:15:07.240
we're trying to hit 10,000.

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:09.090
Last year, we said,
let's do 25 million.

00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:10.930
We hit all those marks.

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:12.870
We're, I would say,
a super majority.

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:15.871
99% of the other 13,000
TEDxes have no idea

00:15:15.871 --> 00:15:17.120
how many views they've gotten.

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:19.940
We gamified our event and
said, let's get these ideas

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:21.750
out there.

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:24.600
So that's the red dot
where our event happened.

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:28.010
And this was one
of our speakers.

00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:29.170
You may know Esther.

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:30.980
Google was founded
in her garage.

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:33.340
And her daughters all
watched the simulcast.

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:34.820
One of them runs
YouTube right now.

00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:37.350
I think she's doing
a pretty good job.

00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:39.861
And we went to town.

00:15:39.861 --> 00:15:42.235
But in addition to having the
one day-- and it's actually

00:15:42.235 --> 00:15:45.710
a two day-- event,
we said, let's have

00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:48.540
the speakers create field
trips throughout the year.

00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:52.550
So if someone in the audience
hears something that they like,

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:54.410
they can go on and
meet that person.

00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:55.910
And let's do it
throughout the year,

00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:57.880
maybe at lunchtime,
maybe on the weekends,

00:15:57.880 --> 00:15:59.880
maybe at midnight, maybe
at 2:00 in the morning.

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:02.171
And let's have these field
trips in interesting places.

00:16:02.171 --> 00:16:04.135
And let's combine a
bunch of our speakers,

00:16:04.135 --> 00:16:06.200
kind of like "Gilligan's
Island" but different,

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:08.880
without being lost
at sea or whatever.

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:11.630
And we said, let's call
these things Adventures.

00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:13.760
And we got people
to not just think,

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:16.690
who would be good at presenting
on stage-- Juan Enriquez.

00:16:16.690 --> 00:16:18.898
I was with him yesterday,
one of the best presenters.

00:16:18.898 --> 00:16:21.490
He's like Leonardo
da Vinci reincarnated

00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:23.795
and Indiana Jones
rolled into one.

00:16:23.795 --> 00:16:25.770
And I remember
hearing him speak.

00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:27.520
And he referenced a
guy named cliff Tabin.

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:28.250
And I know Cliff.

00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:29.160
He's a geneticist.

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:32.810
And I was with Cliff a few
weeks after Juan spoke.

00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:35.400
And Cliff had no idea
Juan even referenced him.

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:38.200
And I realized, does
even Juan know Cliff?

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:42.340
And I realized, what if Juan
did a field trip with Cliff

00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:45.272
in his lab with genetics?

00:16:45.272 --> 00:16:47.605
One of our speakers that's
coming here is George Church.

00:16:47.605 --> 00:16:49.410
He wants to bring back
the woolly mammoth.

00:16:49.410 --> 00:16:51.327
What if you go hang
out with the DNA that's

00:16:51.327 --> 00:16:52.910
going to help
facilitate bringing back

00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:53.760
the woolly mammoth?

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:54.940
You don't have to push
a button, because there

00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:56.080
are all sorts of
moral issues there,

00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:57.621
and maybe you don't
want to go there.

00:16:57.621 --> 00:16:59.917
But you at least want
to have a conversation.

00:16:59.917 --> 00:17:01.500
So now let me give
you a few examples.

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:04.190
We've done 300 of
these Adventures.

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:05.970
And we kind of did a land grab.

00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:07.300
We said, let's do nature.

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:08.259
Lets do social issues.

00:17:08.259 --> 00:17:09.550
Let's do competitive advantage.

00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:12.960
Let's do mythological events
in the history of the city.

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:14.604
So we could kind
of show the range.

00:17:14.604 --> 00:17:16.520
Because if we're going
to unleash this and say

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:18.329
to every city, let's
throw the gauntlet down,

00:17:18.329 --> 00:17:20.287
you try to do what we
just did-- because that's

00:17:20.287 --> 00:17:21.920
what happened with TED Talks.

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:23.700
Nicholas Negroponte
gave the first one.

00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:26.400
A few years later, Larry Lessig
gave one that was really good.

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:28.040
People were like,
I can outdo that

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:29.884
in terms of presentation style.

00:17:29.884 --> 00:17:31.550
So we said, let's do
a land grab and get

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:32.690
a range of these things.

00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:34.240
So here's one.

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:37.090
So '72, there was
a big fire, one

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:40.160
of the worst fires in the
history of the United States,

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:42.286
in Copley Square.

00:17:42.286 --> 00:17:43.785
Because there was
a horse flu-- this

00:17:43.785 --> 00:17:47.676
was 1872-- horses
couldn't get to the fire.

00:17:47.676 --> 00:17:49.300
Because they had to
pull the carriages.

00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:51.130
And it's a good thing
they didn't pull.

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:52.910
Because they would
have realized the hoses

00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:54.180
didn't fit into the hydrants.

00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:56.152
It was like an
Apollo 13 problem.

00:17:56.152 --> 00:17:57.610
So they couldn't
even get the water

00:17:57.610 --> 00:17:59.651
if they had been able to
get the carriages there.

00:17:59.651 --> 00:18:04.150
As a result, in 12 hour,
776 buildings burned down.

00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:07.010
And Copley was just decimated.

00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:09.670
And out of that, HH Richardson
built Trinity Church,

00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:12.010
which is considered one
of the top 10 buildings

00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:12.860
in North America.

00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:14.700
It was a beautiful building.

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:17.900
And because this is a mud flat,
they had to take 500 trees,

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:19.410
make them into like
telephone poles.

00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:22.540
And there are 500
trees under there

00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:24.160
to make sure it doesn't sink.

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:27.220
And so our Adventure
was understanding

00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:29.534
how that building got
built and its relationship

00:18:29.534 --> 00:18:30.700
to another amazing building.

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:32.280
And IM Pei built this building.

00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:35.012
He was supposed to build it--
Prudential had just been built,

00:18:35.012 --> 00:18:36.720
John Hancock, which
is local, Prudential,

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:38.490
which is from New
Jersey-- was kind of

00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:40.360
insulted that they
built a big building.

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:42.020
So they said, we've got to
have a really big building.

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:43.360
Harry Cobb ended up building it.

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:45.650
And they built this long
building, tall building,

00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:47.000
that reflects the area.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.690
And there are all these metal
pylons that stop microbes

00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:51.120
from swishing around.

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:53.606
And microbes started to
eat at the Trinity Church.

00:18:53.606 --> 00:18:55.230
So we did an Adventure
where we learned

00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:58.190
the relationship between
these two iconic buildings.

00:18:58.190 --> 00:19:00.360
And we did a dirty tour
under both of them.

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:02.860
And we went to the top floor,
and we met the engineers

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:04.105
that had to fix the problem.

00:19:04.105 --> 00:19:06.480
This is one of those kind of
epic events that, oh my god,

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:07.729
I can't believe that happened.

00:19:07.729 --> 00:19:11.341
In 1976, every window had to be
replaced in the John Hancock.

00:19:11.341 --> 00:19:12.840
I mean, is that an
insurance problem

00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:14.280
for an insurance company?

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:15.475
It was a math problem.

00:19:15.475 --> 00:19:17.350
It was kind of like the
Hubble Space Station.

00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:18.600
They screwed up on the mirror.

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:19.809
The windows were popping out.

00:19:19.809 --> 00:19:20.974
They were literally falling.

00:19:20.974 --> 00:19:23.420
And there was a moment in time
when this building was just

00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:24.620
covered with plywood.

00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:26.780
How many of you
did not know that?

00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:27.739
OK, so now you know it.

00:19:27.739 --> 00:19:29.238
Now you feel smart,
and you're going

00:19:29.238 --> 00:19:30.860
to tell your friends
at lunch today.

00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:33.810
And how many events are like
that in a city's history,

00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:36.130
that you could create a
spotlight that people are like,

00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:38.850
wow, this is interesting?

00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:41.000
This guy hates robots.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.980
But he built this spider.

00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:45.015
He thinks the way
to go is not robots

00:19:45.015 --> 00:19:46.640
that are going to
take over the world--

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:49.890
and Albert is going
to talk about reading

00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:51.340
a book without opening it.

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:54.140
And you can have a day
when robots go into space

00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:55.640
and read books
without opening them,

00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:56.510
and then become really smart.

00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:58.520
That could be scary,
or it could be good.

00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:01.730
But this guy believes
in ectoskeletons.

00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:03.740
And so we got to
hang out with him.

00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:07.360
He created an eight-legged
spider ectoskeleton that

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:09.330
goes like 4 feet per second.

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:11.210
And we also curated
interesting people.

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:14.020
One of the producers for
"60 Minutes" is in the room.

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:17.009
And if you want to
understand robots,

00:20:17.009 --> 00:20:18.550
you want to understand
ectoskeletons,

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:19.520
you want to understand
the difference,

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:21.810
you want to understand
where this could go,

00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:24.100
this was a good
Adventure for you.

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:27.450
So anyone heard of Project Loon?

00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:29.630
OK, it's one of those
big frickin' ideas.

00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:32.090
And it's an MIT Media Lab
guy who came up with it.

00:20:32.090 --> 00:20:34.090
And now he's like one
of the leaders at XPRIZE

00:20:34.090 --> 00:20:37.921
or at Google X. And I was
at Google X not so long

00:20:37.921 --> 00:20:39.420
ago talking to some
people about it.

00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:41.490
It's a fascinating
idea-- created a wing,

00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:43.980
perpetual, going
around the Earth,

00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:46.190
put solar panels on it,
bring internet to places

00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:47.270
that don't have internet.

00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:51.870
So we said, let's teach
kids about a wing that

00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:53.650
could be up perpetually.

00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:56.200
So we taught kids how to
fold a little piece of paper.

00:20:56.200 --> 00:21:00.160
And if you take a cardboard
and walk behind it,

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:01.770
you can keep it up perpetually.

00:21:01.770 --> 00:21:05.110
And we got 70 kids in
an elementary school

00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:07.610
to get those gliders up.

00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:11.360
And we had 70 of
these up for an hour.

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:12.550
And the kids felt so proud.

00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:16.100
And we talked about what
this could mean for Africa

00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:17.460
and getting internet there.

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:18.880
And we talked about
if any of them

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:20.338
would like to work
on this project.

00:21:20.338 --> 00:21:22.930
And we talked about how
this related to the math

00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:24.450
that they had no
idea what relevance

00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:25.290
it had to do with anything.

00:21:25.290 --> 00:21:27.320
These were little kids, and it
was sort of a loaded question.

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:29.350
But they admitted that
they didn't get it.

00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:30.690
Now, they were like, yes.

00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:32.312
And this is a few years later.

00:21:32.312 --> 00:21:33.270
I still see these kids.

00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:34.269
They give me high fives.

00:21:34.269 --> 00:21:35.940
I can't wait to work
on Project Loon.

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:38.120
I didn't tell them it's hard to
get into Google X and whatever.

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:39.720
But that's a whole
another thing.

00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:41.511
Oh, by the way, have
you heard an Adventure

00:21:41.511 --> 00:21:43.210
that you might want
to go on so far?

00:21:43.210 --> 00:21:44.710
Have you heard an
Adventure that you

00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:46.400
might want to invite people to?

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:49.960
Because part of the idea here
is that you can create these,

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:53.260
or you can invite people, or
you can help document them.

00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:55.720
So Carl is a rocket scientist.

00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:57.940
And he was obsessed
with rocketry.

00:21:57.940 --> 00:21:59.652
And one day he was
reading regulations.

00:21:59.652 --> 00:22:01.110
I don't know if
that's what you do.

00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:06.390
But he realized the regulations
for what defines a car changed.

00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:09.920
And he realized there was a
big opportunity, that if you

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:11.570
have a little plane,
and there's bad

00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:13.726
whether, it's a pain
in the butt to fly.

00:22:13.726 --> 00:22:14.850
Because you've got to wait.

00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:17.070
But he said, what if
that plane could fold up,

00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:19.810
and you could drive
it to another airport

00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:21.239
where there isn't bad weather?

00:22:21.239 --> 00:22:23.155
And the other thing about
having a small plane

00:22:23.155 --> 00:22:24.050
is it's expensive.

00:22:24.050 --> 00:22:25.299
You've got to rent the hangar.

00:22:25.299 --> 00:22:27.932
What if you could fold it up,
and it was the size of an SUV?

00:22:27.932 --> 00:22:29.640
And a lot of you
Googlers are like, yeah,

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:32.430
that's what I'm going
to do with my bonus.

00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:36.880
So this is Terrafugia,
the flying car at Woburn.

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:38.950
This is a local innovation.

00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:41.130
And so we signed NDAs.

00:22:41.130 --> 00:22:42.210
Little kids signed NDAs.

00:22:42.210 --> 00:22:44.280
They didn't even
know what an NDA was.

00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:46.990
And the day before
Oshkosh-- now,

00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:48.650
you may not know
what Oshkosh is.

00:22:48.650 --> 00:22:52.340
But Oshkosh is the biggest
air show in the world.

00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:56.130
The day before Oshkosh, we
went in to their factory.

00:22:56.130 --> 00:22:59.480
And we saw their
new prototype where

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:02.952
the propeller was moved from the
back to the front of the plane.

00:23:02.952 --> 00:23:03.910
We saw how they worked.

00:23:03.910 --> 00:23:05.970
It was like being
at Apple the day

00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:08.070
before the first
iPhone came out.

00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:12.180
So it's not only where you
go, but the timing of it.

00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:13.670
Here's another Adventure.

00:23:13.670 --> 00:23:15.460
I found a Black Hawk
helicopter pilot

00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:19.270
who was just being
chartered to fly

00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:24.480
CO types to get to the
airport so they felt like COs.

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:28.120
And I said to him, why don't
you take the helicopter apart

00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:29.540
and put it back together?

00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:32.090
And why don't you fly
over the watershed

00:23:32.090 --> 00:23:35.340
and get a few people to
think about how everything's

00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:35.840
connected?

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:37.820
There's a book,
"10x" or something,

00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:40.110
"10 Up," where you see, you
get further and further.

00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:42.200
But how many people
really get to go up?

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:45.050
So we had a kid
and a dad learning.

00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:47.610
And I remember that
flight went over--

00:23:47.610 --> 00:23:50.466
I said, go over that place
where they recycle cans.

00:23:50.466 --> 00:23:52.590
Because we know you've got
to put the recycle thing

00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:53.298
in the recycling.

00:23:53.298 --> 00:23:55.670
But how do you know that
really gets recycled?

00:23:55.670 --> 00:23:56.690
Maybe the joke's on us.

00:23:56.690 --> 00:23:59.620
Maybe it doesn't get recycled.

00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:01.431
But if you actually
see the place,

00:24:01.431 --> 00:24:03.430
maybe it'll make you think
differently about it.

00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:04.510
And if you see the
place, maybe you'll

00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:05.570
think of a way to
make it better.

00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:07.569
Maybe this is kind of
inefficient from up above.

00:24:07.569 --> 00:24:10.240
You say, hey, I've got an idea.

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:11.830
And we've done this a few times.

00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:14.374
And the reality is how
many people can you really

00:24:14.374 --> 00:24:15.290
get on the helicopter?

00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:16.149
Because it's finite.

00:24:16.149 --> 00:24:18.440
But if you create an interesting
video that goes viral,

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:20.690
suddenly people will
get this vicariously

00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:22.295
through other people
experiencing it.

00:24:22.295 --> 00:24:23.940
I'm going to come back to that.

00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:25.080
So we went to a jail.

00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:27.959
We had someone talking about
meditating with inmates.

00:24:27.959 --> 00:24:30.000
And you're like, I'm not
going to commit a crime.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.465
I'm not going to
be found in jail.

00:24:31.465 --> 00:24:32.840
You're not going
to tune that in.

00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:36.060
But if you go to a jail, and
you meditate with inmates,

00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:38.670
it suddenly becomes real.

00:24:38.670 --> 00:24:40.350
And I remember
this date vividly.

00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:42.386
I bet the people
we brought on this,

00:24:42.386 --> 00:24:44.510
this is going to be a life
changing event for them.

00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:47.980
We had Omar Wasow, who's Oprah
Winfrey's technology advisor,

00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:49.665
come, founded BlackPlanet.

00:24:49.665 --> 00:24:52.870
He was doing his PhD at the
time on incarceration rates

00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:55.550
for African Americans
in the '70s.

00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:58.680
And it changed his whole
orientation that day

00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:01.430
from what he was
doing his PhD on.

00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:04.480
We had someone come who had
not talk to their brother in 18

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:06.050
year since he had
been locked up,

00:25:06.050 --> 00:25:08.210
because they so resented him.

00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:10.480
And I think this was an
eye-opening experience.

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:13.330
And I've since learned she
reached out to her brother.

00:25:13.330 --> 00:25:15.592
We had someone who
secretly said to me, hey,

00:25:15.592 --> 00:25:17.050
I'm thinking of
committing a crime,

00:25:17.050 --> 00:25:21.710
and I want to know
what's at stake here.

00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:23.440
And I didn't advertise
that at the time.

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:26.235
But that's kind of interesting.

00:25:26.235 --> 00:25:29.790
Yeah, people are looking
like, oh, is it that person?

00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:33.437
We also heard from the inmates.

00:25:33.437 --> 00:25:35.270
And I think this was
an incredibly nurturing

00:25:35.270 --> 00:25:35.790
experience.

00:25:35.790 --> 00:25:37.120
Because they got to
tell their story.

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:39.160
And many of these guys were
in there multiple times.

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:40.555
And you're like, what the what?

00:25:40.555 --> 00:25:41.890
You come back?

00:25:41.890 --> 00:25:45.040
And we understood how
it led to coming back.

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:46.880
And if you look
at the statistics,

00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:49.220
twice the number of people
of color are coming back.

00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:50.030
And why is that?

00:25:50.030 --> 00:25:51.010
And that should make you angry.

00:25:51.010 --> 00:25:51.960
And you should be aware of that.

00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:54.590
And with all the stuff going
on with Ferguson and so on,

00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:57.320
this is a insight into
some of that stuff.

00:25:57.320 --> 00:25:59.420
The thing is what
goes on in jail,

00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:01.330
and understanding how
they use their time,

00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:03.750
can be very informative
in how to help these folks

00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:05.320
kind of transition
back into society.

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:06.939
Our society locks
up a lot of people.

00:26:06.939 --> 00:26:08.730
So this is worth thinking
about Adventures.

00:26:08.730 --> 00:26:11.180
And how we can put a
spotlight on social issues

00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:13.220
can be really interesting.

00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:16.590
Environment-- so we did
this one because lobsters

00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:17.640
are really cheap.

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:20.170
And people are like, yes,
I can get cheap lobsters.

00:26:20.170 --> 00:26:22.150
But there's an
unintended consequence.

00:26:22.150 --> 00:26:23.810
If lobsters are
cheap, why is that?

00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:24.470
It's because there are too many.

00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:25.050
Why is that?

00:26:25.050 --> 00:26:26.966
What does that have to
do with climate change?

00:26:26.966 --> 00:26:28.950
So we said, let's go
lobster boat fishing.

00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:30.430
That's a New England thing.

00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:33.690
Maybe in Wisconsin it's not
so much about the lobster.

00:26:33.690 --> 00:26:35.570
But they have other equivalents.

00:26:35.570 --> 00:26:37.149
And so this is an example.

00:26:37.149 --> 00:26:38.940
Highlight something
special in your region.

00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:41.064
And [? Asham ?], who's over
here, wrote about that.

00:26:41.064 --> 00:26:43.830
It went viral on
some blog in India.

00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:47.160
I think that was his first
time he was blogging in India.

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:49.530
Who's been to the
star, our star?

00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:50.080
Anyone?

00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:52.304
So we said, let's go to
a star on planet Earth.

00:26:52.304 --> 00:26:54.220
This is a plasma lab
that talked about energy.

00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:55.360
This was fascinating.

00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:57.762
And I had heard
about this lab at MIT

00:26:57.762 --> 00:26:59.220
where people said,
oh, it's boring.

00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:00.190
Don't go there.

00:27:00.190 --> 00:27:02.580
But when we brought-- I had
100 people sign up for this.

00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:05.230
And I said, I only want
40 to go in at a time.

00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:07.030
We did three tours.

00:27:07.030 --> 00:27:08.824
And the people said
it was just riveting.

00:27:08.824 --> 00:27:10.990
And I think when you bring
a diverse group of people

00:27:10.990 --> 00:27:14.040
who ask interesting questions,
it takes the folks leading

00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:16.470
the tours, leading the
experience, up a notch.

00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:18.570
So there's another
physics here that you

00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:22.110
can make things that are boring
interesting and important.

00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:23.691
This is going to
Dean Kamen's lab.

00:27:23.691 --> 00:27:25.690
This was on the Colbert
show a few days earlier.

00:27:25.690 --> 00:27:28.726
There's a Stirling engine
bicycle, motorcycle, which

00:27:28.726 --> 00:27:29.850
you're not supposed to see.

00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:31.308
That's why there's
only half of it.

00:27:31.308 --> 00:27:33.360
So don't tell anyone you
see it if you see it.

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:35.800
We went to Dean Kamen's
lab when he wasn't there.

00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:37.000
Dean Kamen's amazing.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.821
He's one of the
most inspiring guys.

00:27:38.821 --> 00:27:40.570
But if you want to
meet the machinist that

00:27:40.570 --> 00:27:42.870
built the Segway, you want to
meet the machinist that built

00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:44.560
Luke's arm-- we had
to sign another NDA,

00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:49.140
two NDAs in one week here-- you
want to go to the front line.

00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:54.730
And at a time when we outsource
China, Taiwan, to build stuff,

00:27:54.730 --> 00:27:58.160
we said, let's go to a glass
blowing factory in Roxbury.

00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:00.730
How many have been
to Roxbury this week?

00:28:00.730 --> 00:28:03.800
That's like a few blocks
from here, less than 2 miles.

00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:06.570
But how often are
you going in there?

00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:07.660
Here's another Adventure.

00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:11.530
So a bunch of
scientists discovered

00:28:11.530 --> 00:28:13.620
the planet was much
older than they thought

00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:16.010
it was on this plugged volcano.

00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:17.420
This is a very famous place.

00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:20.150
In the history of
scientific milestones,

00:28:20.150 --> 00:28:21.300
this is one of them.

00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:23.010
Because they looked
at the ground

00:28:23.010 --> 00:28:25.671
and looked at the rocks and the
tectonics and all this stuff

00:28:25.671 --> 00:28:26.670
and said, wait a second.

00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:29.360
We are so frickin' wrong.

00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:34.430
And we climbed this
mountain with Jodie Foster.

00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:38.460
And we talked to her about, what
was it like making "Contact"?

00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:42.320
And if you think the People's
Choice Awards was bizarre

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:45.447
when she got up and
spoke, this was amazing.

00:28:45.447 --> 00:28:46.780
I mean that in total respectful.

00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:47.613
I love Jodie Foster.

00:28:47.613 --> 00:28:49.560
She's awesome.

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:53.320
So this is a guy from
Sweden who led an Adventure.

00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:55.600
And he talked about this
little prize for 22 years

00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:59.500
he ran-- the Nobel Prize.

00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:01.846
For medicine, for chemistry--
he did three of them.

00:29:01.846 --> 00:29:03.720
I can't remember the
third one, not the peace

00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:04.469
and the economics.

00:29:04.469 --> 00:29:07.030
It turns out the economics
is really a pay-off.

00:29:07.030 --> 00:29:09.410
It's like he didn't even
consider it a Nobel Prize.

00:29:09.410 --> 00:29:11.200
But how many of you
would like to hear

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:15.080
from the guy that ran the
process of who shouldn't

00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:16.377
have gotten the prize?

00:29:16.377 --> 00:29:17.960
Or what happened to
the people who got

00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:19.847
the prize as a result of it?

00:29:19.847 --> 00:29:21.180
Because he's tracked that stuff.

00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:24.500
Or who should have gotten
it who didn't get it?

00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:28.835
And this guy has so
much knowledge on that.

00:29:28.835 --> 00:29:30.710
This is my last Adventure
I'm going to share.

00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:32.110
And then I want to
pose some ideas.

00:29:32.110 --> 00:29:33.090
And you guys are clever.

00:29:33.090 --> 00:29:35.381
I want to get you guys to
wrap your heads around-- this

00:29:35.381 --> 00:29:36.210
is Peter.

00:29:36.210 --> 00:29:39.400
His office is in James
Watson's old office.

00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:43.542
James Watson-- DNA,
articulated it.

00:29:43.542 --> 00:29:45.250
Didn't discover it--
it was there before.

00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:47.540
But he realized it was there.

00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:49.002
So Peter goes in Alvin.

00:29:49.002 --> 00:29:50.460
That's not Alvin
and the Chipmunks.

00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:53.480
He goes in that submarine that
scrubs the bottom of the ocean.

00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:57.200
And he's probably been in
it more times than most.

00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:58.550
And he's looking at microbes.

00:29:58.550 --> 00:30:00.230
And I would bet
if anyone's going

00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:03.070
to have a big impact on global
change of the people I've met,

00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:07.310
he's probably one of the most
important people, a biologist.

00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:09.680
And he brings back creatures
and puts them in jars.

00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:13.400
And we brought 50 people
to meet his creatures.

00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:15.760
And this creature-- I was
really struck by this one.

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:18.010
There's a movie
called "Finding Nemo."

00:30:18.010 --> 00:30:20.320
And there's a creature
depicted in that movie

00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:23.340
only because Peter found it
on the bottom of the ocean.

00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:25.590
If it wasn't for Peter finding
it, you would not know.

00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:27.420
I don't know if that's one
of the most important things

00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:27.920
in society.

00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:30.770
But in terms of commercial
celebrity stuff,

00:30:30.770 --> 00:30:32.870
I feel like that's up there.

00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:36.390
So there's this underground
lair, think bat cave,

00:30:36.390 --> 00:30:39.020
at Harvard, where the physics
department, think Cold War,

00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:39.932
used to do stuff.

00:30:39.932 --> 00:30:41.140
But they don't do it anymore.

00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:45.605
So Peter re-transformed that
into his biological laboratory.

00:30:45.605 --> 00:30:48.120
And we brought a bunch of
families, a bunch of kids,

00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:50.630
down there to see how it's done.

00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:54.426
And there's this one little girl
who felt and held this $45,000

00:30:54.426 --> 00:30:54.926
submarine.

00:30:54.926 --> 00:30:57.020
And I remember she
said to me, I think

00:30:57.020 --> 00:30:58.530
I want to be a marine biologist.

00:30:58.530 --> 00:30:59.430
Before that night,
she didn't even

00:30:59.430 --> 00:31:01.013
know what a marine
biologist was, even

00:31:01.013 --> 00:31:02.760
though she knew "Finding Nemo."

00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:04.855
And the way Tom Brady
is the one quarterback,

00:31:04.855 --> 00:31:06.480
and you don't have
other quarterbacks--

00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:09.180
there may be a situation where
Julian Edelman gets the ball

00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:09.680
or whatever.

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:12.410
But it's rare for other
players to be the quarterback.

00:31:12.410 --> 00:31:13.924
I coached lacrosse
for seven years.

00:31:13.924 --> 00:31:15.340
I've got a lot of
stories on that.

00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:17.160
But that's for another day.

00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:19.540
In lacrosse, whenever
someone gets the ball,

00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:20.380
they're directing.

00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:23.970
In American soccer, football,
American football-- same thing.

00:31:23.970 --> 00:31:26.900
So when you bring a diverse
group of people together,

00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:29.280
you can also have the
kid become the Tom Brady,

00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:33.335
become the leader in a
decentralized kind of setting.

00:31:33.335 --> 00:31:35.960
This isn't a ramen noodles thing
that we just started yesterday

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:37.126
because we got a hypotheses.

00:31:37.126 --> 00:31:38.980
We've been at this
for five years.

00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:44.479
And we've had 300 Adventures,
10,000 people go on them.

00:31:44.479 --> 00:31:46.020
And we've created
a bunch of content.

00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:49.770
And without even trying,
we've hit 25 million views.

00:31:49.770 --> 00:31:51.200
That's nothing to sneeze at.

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:52.710
Those are some real numbers.

00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:55.240
And I looked at our
Google Analytics.

00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:56.850
Thank you for
tracking this stuff.

00:31:56.850 --> 00:32:00.890
All but six countries
have visited our website.

00:32:00.890 --> 00:32:02.951
And is this is just
the last few months.

00:32:02.951 --> 00:32:04.700
And so people are
interested in what we're

00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:06.510
doing around these Adventures.

00:32:06.510 --> 00:32:08.180
So we created a toolkit.

00:32:08.180 --> 00:32:09.360
And I sent it out.

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:11.090
And I got back this version.

00:32:11.090 --> 00:32:13.852
And I don't think there was a
Translation Google button that

00:32:13.852 --> 00:32:14.810
turned it into Chinese.

00:32:14.810 --> 00:32:16.840
But someone laid
it out in Chinese.

00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:17.340
Thank you.

00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:18.710
I don't know who that was.

00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:22.210
So these Adventures,
there's some guidelines.

00:32:22.210 --> 00:32:24.200
And it's in the toolkit.

00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:26.690
You want someone
to invite people.

00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:29.350
Some people have friends.

00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:30.410
Bring them.

00:32:30.410 --> 00:32:33.636
You want someone to be the Ryan
Seacrest, the kind of host.

00:32:33.636 --> 00:32:35.260
In exchange for coming
to these events,

00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:36.430
we say, give a fun fact.

00:32:36.430 --> 00:32:39.420
And the Ryan Seacrest, instead
of reading a whole bio,

00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:43.050
kind of is the broker
between the people presenting

00:32:43.050 --> 00:32:44.320
and the audience.

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:47.600
We also want people to use their
digital devices to document it.

00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:49.005
And we want people to edit it.

00:32:49.005 --> 00:32:51.620
So instead of just putting
what you've documented online,

00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:53.480
like, hey, I just had
toast, have someone

00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:56.360
just really think about
how to tell that story.

00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:58.430
And this is some
of our examples.

00:32:58.430 --> 00:33:00.040
We had people create content.

00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:02.300
We had agency people
that feel like they're

00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:05.280
at the bottom of the food chain
trying to sell Huggies toilet

00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:08.900
paper kind of make these
documents for these big ideas.

00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:12.120
We've had a grandma
do watercolors.

00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:14.339
So this is the beginning
of empowering people.

00:33:14.339 --> 00:33:16.380
We had a comedian make
fun of what we were doing.

00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:18.709
He was really funny,
John Stewart era.

00:33:18.709 --> 00:33:21.250
We also said, if we're really
going to do this beyond our zip

00:33:21.250 --> 00:33:23.510
codes in Boston, and
we want to go global,

00:33:23.510 --> 00:33:24.730
let's invite 100 people.

00:33:24.730 --> 00:33:25.605
And again, I'm cheap.

00:33:25.605 --> 00:33:27.180
And I said, look,
you've got to fly here.

00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:27.888
We'll put you up.

00:33:27.888 --> 00:33:30.380
I didn't tell them it was
a hostel, a youth hostel.

00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:32.850
And last year, for that
particular weekend,

00:33:32.850 --> 00:33:33.950
we had these people fly.

00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:36.560
And these are some of the most
social savvy media people.

00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:38.640
These are people Google
you want to hire.

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:39.600
And they came.

00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:40.832
And they loved the training.

00:33:40.832 --> 00:33:42.790
A lot of different
countries represented here--

00:33:42.790 --> 00:33:44.623
on the bottom, you have
three from Trinidad,

00:33:44.623 --> 00:33:46.450
three from China,
three from Costa Rica.

00:33:46.450 --> 00:33:48.570
And the other picture,
that's six continents

00:33:48.570 --> 00:33:52.880
represented who came to learn
about how to do Adventures.

00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:54.656
So everyone recognizes this guy.

00:33:54.656 --> 00:33:57.030
This is a tour guide standing
in front of the bus saying,

00:33:57.030 --> 00:33:59.890
on your left is Martha Stewart,
or on your right, that's

00:33:59.890 --> 00:34:02.090
Martha Washington.

00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:05.390
In the hierarchy of jobs,
that's probably not very high.

00:34:05.390 --> 00:34:08.250
And tech support used
to be the same way.

00:34:08.250 --> 00:34:10.840
But Apple's changed that
with the Genius Bar.

00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:15.940
What if Adventures we created
a kind of whole new cool role

00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:17.060
in society?

00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:19.340
We've had a lot of third
party kind of validate

00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:21.230
what we're doing as interesting.

00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:23.954
Chris Anderson that runs
TED at the Aspen Institute

00:34:23.954 --> 00:34:24.870
said, this is awesome.

00:34:24.870 --> 00:34:26.880
Forbes kind of did
a whole article

00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:29.810
on us saying we're
the future of TED.

00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:32.610
So I was at Citizen Schools
for 19 years, loved it.

00:34:32.610 --> 00:34:34.580
We're the Google of
the nonprofit space.

00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:39.991
Larry Summers is our board
chair, former secretary

00:34:39.991 --> 00:34:41.699
of treasury and former
Harvard president,

00:34:41.699 --> 00:34:43.610
$42 million nonprofit.

00:34:43.610 --> 00:34:45.889
I helped hire 2,000 people.

00:34:45.889 --> 00:34:48.000
But we were
pre-internet, really.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:49.139
We weren't using video.

00:34:49.139 --> 00:34:51.210
We weren't using social
media to tell our story

00:34:51.210 --> 00:34:53.165
to perpetuate what
we were doing.

00:34:53.165 --> 00:34:54.790
And I feel like this
idea of Adventures

00:34:54.790 --> 00:34:55.914
is harnessing those things.

00:34:55.914 --> 00:34:56.905
So now I'm at MIT.

00:34:56.905 --> 00:34:58.280
Part of what I'm
doing is helping

00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:00.490
to create low cost
medical solutions

00:35:00.490 --> 00:35:04.380
and using innovative spaces
in Hyderabad and Mumbai

00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:06.900
to get the best talent
to kind of solve problems

00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:08.070
very similar to Adventures.

00:35:08.070 --> 00:35:09.840
We're also thinking about
tier two cities were

00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:11.131
more people on the planet live.

00:35:11.131 --> 00:35:13.800
How can you use data
to solve problems?

00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:16.509
We want to scale that.

00:35:16.509 --> 00:35:18.550
But the last few years,
I've been thinking about,

00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:19.070
where are we?

00:35:19.070 --> 00:35:20.986
And these are some slides
to really listen to.

00:35:20.986 --> 00:35:22.840
So kind of lean in here.

00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:26.390
So this is Poland.

00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:28.530
This is 1904.

00:35:28.530 --> 00:35:30.410
And this is a post card.

00:35:30.410 --> 00:35:33.680
And notice there's some
space on the bottom.

00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:35.860
And that's not a typo.

00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:37.450
In the early years
of post cards,

00:35:37.450 --> 00:35:40.030
they often left spaces on the
bottom so someone could say,

00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:41.370
I am here.

00:35:41.370 --> 00:35:45.160
This is a selfie before digital.

00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:46.674
So now people are
going like this.

00:35:46.674 --> 00:35:48.090
They're trying to
get more people.

00:35:48.090 --> 00:35:49.173
You even have these poles.

00:35:49.173 --> 00:35:53.020
You see the tourists in front
of the MIT Dome doing this.

00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:55.960
But that's still a
two dimensional thing.

00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:57.760
Where are selfies going to go?

00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:00.330
What if everyone uses a
smartphone and uses video,

00:36:00.330 --> 00:36:02.787
adds the z-axis, time?

00:36:02.787 --> 00:36:04.870
And instead of having all
these different selfies,

00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:07.110
that stuff gets aggregated.

00:36:07.110 --> 00:36:10.480
So let me introduce you to
a guy who learned online.

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:13.570
This is a guy who grew
up in rural Wisconsin.

00:36:13.570 --> 00:36:15.680
He had very few friends.

00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:19.580
And one day, he locked
himself in a closet and video

00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:21.640
taped himself dancing.

00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:22.890
He was pretty bad.

00:36:22.890 --> 00:36:24.770
And he looked on
YouTube at the comments.

00:36:24.770 --> 00:36:25.670
And he got better.

00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:27.490
And he looked at
other people dancing.

00:36:27.490 --> 00:36:29.569
And now he's considered
the top popper.

00:36:29.569 --> 00:36:30.860
I don't even know what that is.

00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:33.230
But he, through
self-directed learning,

00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:34.930
learned how to be
a great dancer.

00:36:34.930 --> 00:36:38.750
And I heard Eric Schmidt--
who's actually at MIT right now,

00:36:38.750 --> 00:36:39.590
today.

00:36:39.590 --> 00:36:42.700
Eric Schmidt, at the 25th
anniversary of the MIT Media

00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:47.920
Lab, said, hey, this equalizing
content for all to learn

00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:50.030
in rural places is awesome.

00:36:50.030 --> 00:36:52.720
So this guy ended up
paying for med school.

00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:55.080
And now he's at
UCLA because he used

00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:57.320
asynchronous learning,
self-directed interest,

00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:58.430
to learn.

00:36:58.430 --> 00:36:59.380
So this is an old guy.

00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:01.140
And a lot of people
saw him as a cripple.

00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:03.450
Because he had a stroke
and couldn't walk.

00:37:03.450 --> 00:37:07.100
But he got around the college
I went to in this tricycle.

00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:09.620
And most people didn't even
spend any time talking to him.

00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:10.555
But I talked to him.

00:37:10.555 --> 00:37:11.840
And this guy was fascinating.

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:15.660
This guy is that
guy Jeffrey but 93.

00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:20.081
And as people live longer,
encouraging lifelong learning,

00:37:20.081 --> 00:37:22.330
encouraging kind of bringing
intragenerations together

00:37:22.330 --> 00:37:25.150
is something we can facilitate
through these Adventures.

00:37:25.150 --> 00:37:28.490
So Google, you're responsible
for a lot of cat videos.

00:37:28.490 --> 00:37:31.460
And I don't know if you're proud
of that, if you laugh at that.

00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:35.330
But what if for every cat video
there were Adventure videos?

00:37:35.330 --> 00:37:39.140
And what if this Adventure
idea went fractal?

00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:41.360
So Wikipedia has a
lot of contributors.

00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:43.690
And I actually think
this chart is incorrect.

00:37:43.690 --> 00:37:45.990
Because with AI, there's
going to be a lot more content

00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:47.550
generated.

00:37:47.550 --> 00:37:55.329
And this is our first speaker
years ago, Sunita Williams.

00:37:55.329 --> 00:37:57.120
And there's an interesting
story about her.

00:37:57.120 --> 00:37:58.870
My son in first grade
came to me and said,

00:37:58.870 --> 00:38:01.380
Daddy, Daddy, Daddy,
we're learning about NASA.

00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:03.040
Don't you know three astronauts?

00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:05.880
Could we get one of them
to come and visit and talk?

00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:08.870
And I said, probably not.

00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:10.474
But I said I could
Skype or Google

00:38:10.474 --> 00:38:12.890
Hangout-- I don't know if you
know there's Google Hangout.

00:38:12.890 --> 00:38:15.122
I could Google Hangout
one of them into the room.

00:38:15.122 --> 00:38:16.330
And so I went to the teacher.

00:38:16.330 --> 00:38:17.871
This teacher did a
great job teaching

00:38:17.871 --> 00:38:21.040
reading and writing and
keeping my son's class safe.

00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:24.315
And the teacher said, no.

00:38:24.315 --> 00:38:26.080
And I'm like, what?

00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:29.015
You don't want an
astronaut to be in class?

00:38:29.015 --> 00:38:30.390
And I unpacked
that a little bit.

00:38:30.390 --> 00:38:34.536
And I realized she wasn't
being judged on that.

00:38:34.536 --> 00:38:36.410
She didn't know how the
kids evaluated on it.

00:38:36.410 --> 00:38:37.920
She didn't know how
the kids would act.

00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:39.000
SUNITA WILLIAMS:
I'm Suni Williams.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.250
And I'm currently on the
International Space Station.

00:38:41.250 --> 00:38:45.020
Me and my crew mates have been
here for the last four months

00:38:45.020 --> 00:38:49.450
truly living a dream,
putting ideas into action.

00:38:49.450 --> 00:38:52.760
JOHN WERNER: So that's
the talk that didn't

00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:54.844
happen at my kid's school.

00:38:54.844 --> 00:38:56.510
But what that made
me realize is there's

00:38:56.510 --> 00:38:57.890
people with social capital.

00:38:57.890 --> 00:39:00.210
Steve Vinter has
ridiculous social capital.

00:39:00.210 --> 00:39:03.350
People walk around
the Earth for him.

00:39:03.350 --> 00:39:05.600
You can't just plug that
social capital into schools

00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:08.130
as schools exist-- Columbine,
other safety issues.

00:39:08.130 --> 00:39:11.390
But if we created a mechanism
to kind of connect people.

00:39:11.390 --> 00:39:16.340
So the top 2% or 10%
of Wikipedia generators

00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:17.890
do most of the generation.

00:39:17.890 --> 00:39:21.990
What if we unleashed content
generation of these Adventures

00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:25.300
to the masses, and all
that content went out

00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:27.570
on different social avenues?

00:39:27.570 --> 00:39:29.695
Now right now, if you want
to go to the Super Bowl,

00:39:29.695 --> 00:39:31.870
it's pretty expensive.

00:39:31.870 --> 00:39:33.650
You have to pay a lot of money.

00:39:33.650 --> 00:39:36.530
But what if we
disrupted tickets,

00:39:36.530 --> 00:39:39.620
and suddenly every
institution-- art houses,

00:39:39.620 --> 00:39:42.920
historic places-- set aside a
certain percentage of tickets,

00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:45.470
because they wanted to curate
a more interesting audience

00:39:45.470 --> 00:39:47.969
through Adventures than they
thought they could get randomly

00:39:47.969 --> 00:39:49.140
by people buying tickets?

00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:52.700
And if they got a little bit
of access, some social media,

00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:55.640
some new selfies were
created that would

00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:57.390
be more valuable than
nickel and diming

00:39:57.390 --> 00:40:01.910
people for the $1,200 per
ticket, that's a big idea.

00:40:01.910 --> 00:40:04.360
The other thing is
I was at Google I/O.

00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:06.070
And I took five of these.

00:40:06.070 --> 00:40:08.600
I really like your Oculus Rift.

00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:12.006
There's a lot of content that
needs to be generated for VR.

00:40:12.006 --> 00:40:13.380
And there are
going to be drones.

00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:14.879
And Google Street
View, you're going

00:40:14.879 --> 00:40:16.460
to have cars driving around.

00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:18.910
But what if you created
a format, a standard,

00:40:18.910 --> 00:40:21.370
through these Adventures,
if you went fractal,

00:40:21.370 --> 00:40:22.930
and tens and
thousands and millions

00:40:22.930 --> 00:40:25.860
and kajillions and
kabillions of content

00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:27.240
was generated that
suddenly could

00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:31.110
become the future of
the VR experience?

00:40:31.110 --> 00:40:34.930
So I think we can flip some
traditional institutions--

00:40:34.930 --> 00:40:36.550
education, journalism.

00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:40.150
At a time when we need
journalism more than ever,

00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:45.310
editorializing how
complicated life is-- cloning,

00:40:45.310 --> 00:40:47.920
climate change, all these
things-- the business model

00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:49.190
dropped out.

00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:50.550
Talk to Chris.

00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:53.010
Every quarter, he had to
let go of half his staff.

00:40:53.010 --> 00:40:54.490
Because people
aren't buying ads.

00:40:54.490 --> 00:40:56.300
Because Google,
you're killing it.

00:40:56.300 --> 00:40:58.050
But what if we created
these Adventures

00:40:58.050 --> 00:41:02.380
as a new form of journalism
or education or conferences?

00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:04.630
So "Time" magazine
put this out there.

00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:05.470
This isn't a secret.

00:41:05.470 --> 00:41:07.955
If you map out the
shareable economy,

00:41:07.955 --> 00:41:09.330
there are a lot
of opportunities.

00:41:09.330 --> 00:41:12.147
And I don't think experiences
is on there in the way

00:41:12.147 --> 00:41:13.480
that we've conceived Adventures.

00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:16.250
There's an opportunity
here, blue sky.

00:41:16.250 --> 00:41:18.760
So this is my second
to last slide.

00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:22.230
So where to go from
here-- so ideas in action,

00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:25.900
we have a license
to do TEDx events.

00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:28.510
And November 3 is
a working date.

00:41:28.510 --> 00:41:30.200
But in this room,
ladies and gentlemen,

00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:31.700
we're going to do
TEDx Beacon Street

00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:33.850
Salon first week of November.

00:41:33.850 --> 00:41:36.210
And the reason I want to
do it is I'm betting you

00:41:36.210 --> 00:41:39.400
guys are not going to come
across the street to MIT.

00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:42.520
But if we bring interesting
speakers here and videotape

00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:45.570
them and say, we want to create
Adventures on all of them

00:41:45.570 --> 00:41:47.870
throughout the year, that
we can get a bunch of you

00:41:47.870 --> 00:41:48.830
to help with that.

00:41:48.830 --> 00:41:51.200
Who thinks that's kind
of an interesting idea?

00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:54.160
That doesn't mean you've signed
up, even though-- Sean, take

00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:54.910
a picture of that.

00:41:54.910 --> 00:41:56.830
Who thinks this is
an interesting idea?

00:41:56.830 --> 00:41:59.090
OK, that doesn't mean you've
signed in a court of law

00:41:59.090 --> 00:42:00.090
that you're involved.

00:42:00.090 --> 00:42:02.739
But if we do a few
Adventures here,

00:42:02.739 --> 00:42:05.030
kind of like how Facebook
went viral through Ivy League

00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:09.230
and Myspace didn't, we can bring
some legitimacy to this idea.

00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:12.270
We also have two weeks before
Thanksgiving our big event

00:42:12.270 --> 00:42:15.170
at the Lincoln School if you
want to be involved with that.

00:42:15.170 --> 00:42:16.529
We have 90 speakers.

00:42:16.529 --> 00:42:17.320
They're all online.

00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:19.080
Their bios are there.

00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:21.870
TED says they're as good
if not a little bit better

00:42:21.870 --> 00:42:22.485
than theirs.

00:42:22.485 --> 00:42:23.360
They didn't say that.

00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:25.870
But they said it's
as good, not better.

00:42:25.870 --> 00:42:30.210
In March, on St. Patrick's Day,
at the Heinz Convention Center

00:42:30.210 --> 00:42:32.820
in the Weston, we're teaming
up with some surgeons.

00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:35.520
We're going to do TEDx
Beacon Street Surgery.

00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:37.810
And we're excited about that.

00:42:37.810 --> 00:42:40.650
And in April, we're
partnering with Spartan Races.

00:42:40.650 --> 00:42:43.990
And on the 100th anniversary
of MIT, we have TEDx MIT.

00:42:43.990 --> 00:42:46.350
So I don't really care
about conferences.

00:42:46.350 --> 00:42:49.790
What I care about is setting
in motion Adventures.

00:42:49.790 --> 00:42:52.962
And if we can kill it in
Boston and kill it in New York,

00:42:52.962 --> 00:42:54.170
we're going to get attention.

00:42:54.170 --> 00:42:56.500
And I had a guy get on
a plane three weeks ago,

00:42:56.500 --> 00:42:58.434
the chief revenue
officer from Zillow.

00:42:58.434 --> 00:43:00.600
And he said, John, this is
one of the best platforms

00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:01.990
I've ever heard.

00:43:01.990 --> 00:43:04.000
You've gotta take
it to the next level

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.640
to get the Seattle mafia
involvement, and we're ready.

00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:08.790
I don't think it's a real
mafia, but I don't know.

00:43:08.790 --> 00:43:10.210
Whatever, that was a joke.

00:43:10.210 --> 00:43:11.170
So can you laugh?

00:43:11.170 --> 00:43:12.290
Because we're videotaping.

00:43:12.290 --> 00:43:15.630
All right, so that's my talk.

00:43:15.630 --> 00:43:17.840
And I haven't totally
figured this out.

00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:20.500
But there are a lot of people
who are awesome on this team.

00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:22.500
I took seven classes at
Harvard Business School

00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:23.820
trying to learn how to lead.

00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:25.350
And I'm not using
anything I learned

00:43:25.350 --> 00:43:26.350
in any of those classes.

00:43:26.350 --> 00:43:28.350
So I'd probably fail
if I was submitting

00:43:28.350 --> 00:43:29.290
how we're doing this.

00:43:29.290 --> 00:43:30.665
We've got a virtual
organization.

00:43:30.665 --> 00:43:31.820
No one is salaried.

00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:33.720
And we want to take
this to the next level.

00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:35.690
And because I love
Steve Vinter, and he's

00:43:35.690 --> 00:43:39.822
been like an inspiration
every day of my life,

00:43:39.822 --> 00:43:41.280
I said, Steve, let
me help you out.

00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:42.655
I want you to get
that promotion.

00:43:42.655 --> 00:43:44.692
So I said I'll bring
more of our stuff here.

00:43:44.692 --> 00:43:46.900
I know you're upset about
Google Health and whatever.

00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:48.990
So Steve, I'm there for you, OK?

00:43:48.990 --> 00:43:50.400
I'm here for you.

00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:53.080
All right, who found
this interesting?

00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:55.110
Who found this better
than they thought it was

00:43:55.110 --> 00:43:56.960
going to be when they came in?

00:43:56.960 --> 00:43:59.424
OK, I'm not going to ask if
it was worse or the same.

00:43:59.424 --> 00:44:01.340
All right, I want to
hear five things that you

00:44:01.340 --> 00:44:02.440
learned that you didn't know.

00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:03.550
Get to the mic and say it.

00:44:03.550 --> 00:44:04.730
This isn't question time.

00:44:04.730 --> 00:44:07.099
Just say something that's
an aha, an epiphany.

00:44:07.099 --> 00:44:08.390
It doesn't have to be profound.

00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:11.000
We'll cut it out in the post
video unless you're voyeuristic

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:11.970
and you want that
stuff out there.

00:44:11.970 --> 00:44:12.460
Go.

00:44:12.460 --> 00:44:13.668
It can be anyone in the room.

00:44:13.668 --> 00:44:14.336
Go-- mics.

00:44:14.336 --> 00:44:15.070
Hurry up.

00:44:15.070 --> 00:44:17.528
AUDIENCE: OK, I didn't know
about the Copley Square thingy.

00:44:17.528 --> 00:44:19.070
Because I'm not a Boston person.

00:44:19.070 --> 00:44:21.410
I didn't know that IM Pei
had built the other building

00:44:21.410 --> 00:44:21.930
next door.

00:44:21.930 --> 00:44:23.620
JOHN WERNER: Harry
Cobb did, actually.

00:44:23.620 --> 00:44:25.470
He was a protege for IM Pei.

00:44:25.470 --> 00:44:27.340
If you went on the
Adventure, you'd know.

00:44:27.340 --> 00:44:29.740
AUDIENCE: I didn't know you
had had 25 million hits.

00:44:29.740 --> 00:44:32.410
Because when I did it,
I think we were at 10.

00:44:32.410 --> 00:44:33.990
So that's three.

00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:35.990
I didn't know you had
done that many Adventures.

00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:39.422
Because I think I was
part of one, so only one

00:44:39.422 --> 00:44:40.380
out of the whole thing.

00:44:40.380 --> 00:44:44.700
And I didn't know about
all your different things.

00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:46.387
I knew about the
Lincoln School venue.

00:44:46.387 --> 00:44:47.970
But I didn't know
about the other one.

00:44:47.970 --> 00:44:48.550
So that's five.

00:44:48.550 --> 00:44:49.990
JOHN WERNER: Great,
so I was looking

00:44:49.990 --> 00:44:50.840
for five different ones.

00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:51.530
But that was fine.

00:44:51.530 --> 00:44:52.988
Let's give her a
round of applause.

00:44:52.988 --> 00:44:53.610
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:53.610 --> 00:44:55.680
So four other
people kind of just

00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:57.110
play back something interesting.

00:44:57.110 --> 00:44:58.680
Because just because
I said it, there

00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:01.263
may be something that stuck out
in your mind, and that'll help

00:45:01.263 --> 00:45:03.050
validate that this
was interesting.

00:45:03.050 --> 00:45:04.867
So someone else go.

00:45:04.867 --> 00:45:06.950
AUDIENCE: So I'd been
talking to John a little bit

00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:07.866
previously about this.

00:45:07.866 --> 00:45:11.500
But your talk today
reinvigorated this,

00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:13.990
that the experience
is one aspect of this.

00:45:13.990 --> 00:45:16.450
But what's amazing, especially
with the shareable economy,

00:45:16.450 --> 00:45:18.510
is that piece of content
that comes out of it

00:45:18.510 --> 00:45:20.860
and how valuable certain
people treat that.

00:45:20.860 --> 00:45:23.180
And so I think
what's particularly

00:45:23.180 --> 00:45:27.390
interesting about
the idea is that bit,

00:45:27.390 --> 00:45:29.470
whether it's something
that's not just a selfie.

00:45:29.470 --> 00:45:32.970
It's something more, kind of
a community selfie almost,

00:45:32.970 --> 00:45:35.219
one that would be
stitched together somehow.

00:45:35.219 --> 00:45:36.760
So I think that's
the bit of the idea

00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:39.219
that I'm particularly
intrigued by, especially

00:45:39.219 --> 00:45:41.760
from a platform perspective or
something, how that would work

00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:42.260
and stuff.

00:45:42.260 --> 00:45:43.968
JOHN WERNER: And with
exponential change,

00:45:43.968 --> 00:45:46.120
Moore's law, the
technology is going

00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:49.720
to be there to do amazing
things, AI creating content.

00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:52.740
And it's about us thinking
about how to use our time.

00:45:52.740 --> 00:45:54.800
And Google, you do 10% time.

00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:58.030
Or you do interesting
things with time.

00:45:58.030 --> 00:45:59.280
You have more employees.

00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:01.390
Like when I go to Pixar, I feel
like everyone has two jobs.

00:46:01.390 --> 00:46:03.470
You guys, I feel like you have
two people for every job here.

00:46:03.470 --> 00:46:04.761
I don't mean that in a bad way.

00:46:04.761 --> 00:46:06.620
But you value time.

00:46:06.620 --> 00:46:09.590
And I think we can change how
people see time in society

00:46:09.590 --> 00:46:10.527
by getting this right.

00:46:10.527 --> 00:46:12.360
AUDIENCE: Mine is less
about what I learned.

00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:13.680
It's actually a
question for you.

00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:14.180
JOHN WERNER: Bring it on.

00:46:14.180 --> 00:46:15.554
AUDIENCE: So you
went to I/O. Did

00:46:15.554 --> 00:46:17.224
you connect with
the Expeditions team

00:46:17.224 --> 00:46:18.390
that we have here at Google?

00:46:18.390 --> 00:46:20.973
Because a lot of what you talked
about reminded me of the work

00:46:20.973 --> 00:46:23.009
that they're doing
with Google Cardboard.

00:46:23.009 --> 00:46:24.800
For people who didn't
see the announcement,

00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:26.570
they're trying to bring
adventures to the classroom

00:46:26.570 --> 00:46:27.950
where a school bus can't go.

00:46:27.950 --> 00:46:29.510
So they're using
Google Cardboard

00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:33.070
to bring like videos
from Paris or China.

00:46:33.070 --> 00:46:35.455
And it allows kids
to investigate

00:46:35.455 --> 00:46:37.820
a project or an area
that they might otherwise

00:46:37.820 --> 00:46:38.970
never get to see.

00:46:38.970 --> 00:46:40.660
So I'm wondering how you might
be collaborating with them.

00:46:40.660 --> 00:46:42.300
Because I could
see that obviously

00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:45.364
leads really well into making a
platform into schools directly

00:46:45.364 --> 00:46:46.530
for what you guys are doing.

00:46:46.530 --> 00:46:49.034
JOHN WERNER: So Matteo, my
youngest, for some reason

00:46:49.034 --> 00:46:50.200
we're talking about England.

00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:51.700
I'm like, do you
know where that is?

00:46:51.700 --> 00:46:53.410
He's like, yeah, it's in Paris.

00:46:53.410 --> 00:46:56.050
And I think if you could
experience these things,

00:46:56.050 --> 00:46:58.174
you would know there's a
difference between England

00:46:58.174 --> 00:46:59.070
and Paris.

00:46:59.070 --> 00:47:01.070
And I've talked to
senior people at Google,

00:47:01.070 --> 00:47:03.760
like these very
senior people, who

00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:06.200
really want to help
someone in bed or someone

00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:08.430
who can't walk get
access to information.

00:47:08.430 --> 00:47:09.820
And schools is
one of the places.

00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:12.594
And you guys are great at
making information accessible.

00:47:12.594 --> 00:47:14.510
So at Google I/O, I
talked to a lot of people.

00:47:14.510 --> 00:47:16.551
I was with Megan Smith,
so I felt like a pinball.

00:47:16.551 --> 00:47:17.760
I was bouncing off walls.

00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:19.930
She's awesome.

00:47:19.930 --> 00:47:23.010
But I'm now ready to kind
of go to the next level

00:47:23.010 --> 00:47:24.904
to say, who should
we collaborate with?

00:47:24.904 --> 00:47:27.320
And I don't want this to become
a one percenter type thing

00:47:27.320 --> 00:47:28.820
that only the super rich do.

00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:32.141
I mean, you have a
Googler that got 30 people

00:47:32.141 --> 00:47:33.640
to spend two years
to figure out how

00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:36.550
to make a space suit that he
could drop from Earth, right?

00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:37.641
Not everyone can do that.

00:47:37.641 --> 00:47:40.140
And I want this to be something
that everyone can do and can

00:47:40.140 --> 00:47:41.574
bring diverse people together.

00:47:41.574 --> 00:47:42.990
And finding the
right partnerships

00:47:42.990 --> 00:47:45.680
like that one I think is
very strategic at this point.

00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:48.390
So I'd love your help on that
if you're part of that team.

00:47:48.390 --> 00:47:50.050
All right, let's get
three more things.

00:47:50.050 --> 00:47:52.532
And then you can do questions.

00:47:52.532 --> 00:47:54.240
AUDIENCE: Well, I
didn't realize that any

00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:57.200
of the ideas that you
hear about in TED or TEDx

00:47:57.200 --> 00:47:58.950
actually went on
further than that.

00:47:58.950 --> 00:48:00.530
I thought, like
you said earlier,

00:48:00.530 --> 00:48:02.160
the motto is, "Ideas
worth spreading."

00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:04.820
So I thought essentially
the ideas spread, and then

00:48:04.820 --> 00:48:06.840
the whole goal was
for other people

00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:09.197
to continue spreading them,
and hopefully at some point

00:48:09.197 --> 00:48:10.280
someone would take action.

00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:12.110
But I didn't realize there was
already something doing that.

00:48:12.110 --> 00:48:14.360
JOHN WERNER: So a few years
ago, I came back from TED.

00:48:14.360 --> 00:48:16.930
And when I met with Chris
Anderson, I sat in his office.

00:48:16.930 --> 00:48:19.590
I said, hey, I got this
idea of these field trips.

00:48:19.590 --> 00:48:21.800
I said, why don't
you create a budget.

00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:25.320
We'll make it another element of
your website, and I'll kill it.

00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:27.860
And he said, John, I'm
just juggling too much.

00:48:27.860 --> 00:48:29.360
You just have fun with it.

00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:30.720
So he said no.

00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:31.590
And I'm glad he did.

00:48:31.590 --> 00:48:33.590
Because I've been able
to kind of percolate it.

00:48:33.590 --> 00:48:39.110
And I think we can get-- of the
12,000 TEDxes, a third of them

00:48:39.110 --> 00:48:40.510
to be doing Adventures.

00:48:40.510 --> 00:48:42.780
But my goal is
not to stop there.

00:48:42.780 --> 00:48:48.930
What if all the Google
GDGers-- how many are there,

00:48:48.930 --> 00:48:52.470
Development Group Developers?

00:48:52.470 --> 00:48:55.062
I think there's
like-- at I/O, they

00:48:55.062 --> 00:48:56.770
were all at I/O. What
if they all did it?

00:48:56.770 --> 00:48:59.390
What if the 400,000
IEEErs start doing this?

00:48:59.390 --> 00:49:01.220
What if anyone who
is part of a group--

00:49:01.220 --> 00:49:03.200
so the TEDx is
just the beginning.

00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:04.910
But I want to make
this everything.

00:49:04.910 --> 00:49:05.740
All right, Steve.

00:49:05.740 --> 00:49:10.314
STEVE VINTER: So could
you be specific about what

00:49:10.314 --> 00:49:12.105
the thing is you want
to do at Google next?

00:49:15.389 --> 00:49:17.555
Let me just give you my
perspective on some of this.

00:49:17.555 --> 00:49:20.320
I think John's done one of
the more creative things that

00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:22.070
is going on with TEDx.

00:49:22.070 --> 00:49:24.425
And he's trying to take
it to the next level.

00:49:24.425 --> 00:49:26.300
And I think it's really
important to do that.

00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:28.340
Because it's about
the experience.

00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:29.780
And that's what's
really magical.

00:49:29.780 --> 00:49:33.010
And what I've been
trying to figure out

00:49:33.010 --> 00:49:35.470
is how Google engages with this.

00:49:35.470 --> 00:49:39.760
And not in the sense of, oh,
we can have an event here,

00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:41.970
but actually trying to do
something more than that.

00:49:41.970 --> 00:49:46.362
And the key is actually
first getting involved

00:49:46.362 --> 00:49:47.320
and starting somewhere.

00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:50.140
And we've already hosted TEDx
Beacon Street a couple times.

00:49:50.140 --> 00:49:52.891
But now you're talking about
actually having a bigger event

00:49:52.891 --> 00:49:53.390
here.

00:49:53.390 --> 00:49:54.890
And so I'd like
people to understand

00:49:54.890 --> 00:49:56.530
what that request is.

00:49:56.530 --> 00:50:00.510
Because to me, the key
to this whole thing

00:50:00.510 --> 00:50:03.880
is taking the next step from
where you currently are.

00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:06.680
And the next step requires
people to get involved.

00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:08.990
And so I just want to make
it really clear that's

00:50:08.990 --> 00:50:11.740
to me what I'm trying to figure
out how to make happen here

00:50:11.740 --> 00:50:13.880
at Google apart from
the discussions you

00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:15.720
I have all the time
about kind of where

00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:17.240
the whole overall
program is going.

00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:19.031
So could you be really
explicit about that?

00:50:19.031 --> 00:50:21.157
JOHN WERNER: Yeah,
so to be clear,

00:50:21.157 --> 00:50:22.740
the first week of
November we're going

00:50:22.740 --> 00:50:24.110
to have a few speakers here.

00:50:24.110 --> 00:50:26.780
And I want to reverse engineer
who would be great speakers

00:50:26.780 --> 00:50:28.760
to lend themselves to
do Adventures and maybe

00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:30.490
before the event,
maybe during the event,

00:50:30.490 --> 00:50:32.090
maybe in the next
two years after.

00:50:32.090 --> 00:50:33.780
And I want the Google
community to be

00:50:33.780 --> 00:50:36.590
able to invite people to go
on those-- friends, family,

00:50:36.590 --> 00:50:37.570
and a few others.

00:50:37.570 --> 00:50:39.680
And I want to create
a new unit of media

00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:43.590
from those Adventures that
are worthy of showcasing

00:50:43.590 --> 00:50:45.110
what's possible on Adventures.

00:50:45.110 --> 00:50:47.443
And when you say it's affiliated
with the Google office,

00:50:47.443 --> 00:50:49.800
I want to create a jealousy
in the other Google offices

00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:52.550
around the world to say, hey,
if Vinter's team can do it,

00:50:52.550 --> 00:50:53.720
we can do it, too.

00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:57.950
I also want to think about how
these experiences can scale.

00:50:57.950 --> 00:50:59.404
And you guys are about 10x.

00:50:59.404 --> 00:51:01.570
So I just put out there,
hey, let's disrupt tickets.

00:51:01.570 --> 00:51:04.200
Let's disrupt creating
content for VR.

00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:06.930
That's just me thinking the
last week as a force function.

00:51:06.930 --> 00:51:08.340
Because I knew I was getting
in front of you guys.

00:51:08.340 --> 00:51:09.389
But you guys are clever.

00:51:09.389 --> 00:51:11.680
I bet you guys can come up
with a bunch of other ideas.

00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:14.300
And as this bounces
around the Google network,

00:51:14.300 --> 00:51:17.530
if anyone sees to this
point in the video,

00:51:17.530 --> 00:51:20.220
come tell us what
we think we can do.

00:51:20.220 --> 00:51:22.694
I also think this runs
counter to the way things are,

00:51:22.694 --> 00:51:24.610
and that there are a lot
of interesting trends

00:51:24.610 --> 00:51:26.910
that we're harnessing that
we're ahead of the curve.

00:51:26.910 --> 00:51:28.326
And that's why the
guy from Zillow

00:51:28.326 --> 00:51:30.300
flew out to meet with us.

00:51:30.300 --> 00:51:32.820
And I need help complementing.

00:51:32.820 --> 00:51:33.840
We got the vision.

00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:35.116
We got the creativity.

00:51:35.116 --> 00:51:36.490
But we don't have
the operations.

00:51:36.490 --> 00:51:37.860
We don't have the platform yet.

00:51:37.860 --> 00:51:40.280
So maybe some of you don't
want to do a conference.

00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:41.680
But maybe you might want
to help think through,

00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:42.971
what does a platform look like?

00:51:42.971 --> 00:51:44.780
You guys are experts at that.

00:51:44.780 --> 00:51:50.050
The other thing is if you want
to kind of kick the tires, come

00:51:50.050 --> 00:51:52.760
to some of our events.

00:51:52.760 --> 00:51:54.240
And it's fun.

00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:55.990
And a lot of you
care about things.

00:51:55.990 --> 00:51:57.780
A lot of you help
support nonprofits.

00:51:57.780 --> 00:52:00.030
Maybe we create Adventures
around the things

00:52:00.030 --> 00:52:01.175
you care about.

00:52:01.175 --> 00:52:03.010
And so that's
something interesting.

00:52:03.010 --> 00:52:04.310
Steve, is that specific enough?

00:52:04.310 --> 00:52:05.434
STEVE VINTER: Very much so.

00:52:05.434 --> 00:52:07.761
JOHN WERNER: OK,
Martha, what do you got?

00:52:07.761 --> 00:52:10.510
MARTHA: I didn't know
that there was less

00:52:10.510 --> 00:52:14.469
than a handful of countries that
hadn't seen TEDx Beacon Street.

00:52:14.469 --> 00:52:15.760
JOHN WERNER: It's less than 10.

00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:16.551
I think it's seven.

00:52:16.551 --> 00:52:17.652
MARTHA: That's remarkable.

00:52:17.652 --> 00:52:19.110
JOHN WERNER: No
bull shit about it,

00:52:19.110 --> 00:52:20.740
I want to get those countries.

00:52:20.740 --> 00:52:21.840
MARTHA: Well, the
fact that there are--

00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:23.548
AUDIENCE: I sent an
email to one of them.

00:52:23.548 --> 00:52:24.990
JOHN WERNER: Thank
you, thank you.

00:52:24.990 --> 00:52:27.450
MARTHA: 25 million views--

00:52:27.450 --> 00:52:31.610
JOHN WERNER: We're actually at
26.2 to be accurate, but yeah.

00:52:31.610 --> 00:52:34.070
MARTHA: Well, I think
it's remarkable.

00:52:34.070 --> 00:52:38.260
I love that your son inspired
the TEDx Beacon Street

00:52:38.260 --> 00:52:42.590
concept of bringing it right
home right to your backyard.

00:52:42.590 --> 00:52:46.880
I didn't realize that there
were so many Adventures that

00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:50.430
were actually around the globe.

00:52:50.430 --> 00:52:51.760
That's very exciting.

00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:58.200
And I want to just stress that
now there are 13,000 TEDxes.

00:52:58.200 --> 00:53:04.360
But TEDx Beacon Street is really
at the top of its game, right?

00:53:04.360 --> 00:53:06.680
So I also just wanted
to share that I'm just

00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:10.205
absolutely drunk on the
information and gathering

00:53:10.205 --> 00:53:11.820
and the community building.

00:53:11.820 --> 00:53:14.572
And I love what you're
doing, so thank you.

00:53:14.572 --> 00:53:16.030
JOHN WERNER: So is
there anyone who

00:53:16.030 --> 00:53:18.180
wants to ask a question
or state something?

00:53:18.180 --> 00:53:19.050
I see Mark.

00:53:19.050 --> 00:53:20.700
My guess is he's
bringing us together.

00:53:20.700 --> 00:53:22.260
MARK HOFNER: I have two things.

00:53:22.260 --> 00:53:24.030
One is an idea.

00:53:24.030 --> 00:53:25.670
And the other was
to wrap things up.

00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:28.090
But I'm going to put
Charlie Sawyer, who's

00:53:28.090 --> 00:53:30.970
in the back of the room here,
on the spot a little bit

00:53:30.970 --> 00:53:33.070
as a potential idea for
one of these Adventures.

00:53:33.070 --> 00:53:37.452
So Charlie is an amazing figure
who lives and breathes blues.

00:53:37.452 --> 00:53:38.910
And if you look
right outside here,

00:53:38.910 --> 00:53:41.950
you'll see his phenomenal
photography from

00:53:41.950 --> 00:53:43.840
years'-- or decades',
I should probably say--

00:53:43.840 --> 00:53:45.800
worth of events
that he's gone to.

00:53:45.800 --> 00:53:49.240
And he's actually written
a biography on BB King,

00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:53.305
I believe it was, the biography
on BB King, who has just

00:53:53.305 --> 00:53:54.430
passed away, unfortunately.

00:53:54.430 --> 00:53:56.242
But I think he would
be somebody who

00:53:56.242 --> 00:53:58.200
would be one of those
amazing people to enlist.

00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:02.800
JOHN WERNER: So get a famous
recording studio, like at WGBH,

00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:05.280
and get some jazz
musicians in there.

00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:07.180
Then do a petting zoo
with the instruments,

00:54:07.180 --> 00:54:09.780
and then take pictures
of the people.

00:54:09.780 --> 00:54:11.820
And you share your passion.

00:54:11.820 --> 00:54:14.050
And that's the
kind of creativity.

00:54:14.050 --> 00:54:16.970
We need people to curate
what you do, where you do it,

00:54:16.970 --> 00:54:17.760
when you do it.

00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:18.840
Is it at midnight?

00:54:18.840 --> 00:54:22.220
Is it at Wally's in the South
End where a lot of good jazz

00:54:22.220 --> 00:54:22.720
is?

00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:25.242
So yeah, I want to
unlock people like that.

00:54:25.242 --> 00:54:26.700
So instead of a
kid saying, oh, I'm

00:54:26.700 --> 00:54:28.590
going to go serve food
at a soup kitchen,

00:54:28.590 --> 00:54:31.759
what if one day every
single high schooler instead

00:54:31.759 --> 00:54:33.300
of community service
said, am I going

00:54:33.300 --> 00:54:35.508
to come up with an Adventure,
am I going to lead one,

00:54:35.508 --> 00:54:38.160
am I going to document
it or edit it?

00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:40.805
And I want to unleash that.

00:54:40.805 --> 00:54:42.180
MARK HOFNER: I
want to wrap it up

00:54:42.180 --> 00:54:44.054
by saying thank you to
John for coming today.

00:54:44.054 --> 00:54:45.778
This was an absolutely
wonderful talk.

00:54:45.778 --> 00:54:49.610
[APPLAUSE]

00:54:49.610 --> 00:54:52.300
JOHN WERNER: And
Jacqueline Winter is here.

00:54:52.300 --> 00:54:55.570
If anyone wants to get
involved or has a question

00:54:55.570 --> 00:54:57.675
or think I was really
inaccurate on something

00:54:57.675 --> 00:55:00.300
and needs to be edited out,
please let Jacqueline know.

00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:01.332
She's awesome.

00:55:01.332 --> 00:55:02.540
You've been a great audience.

00:55:02.540 --> 00:55:03.440
Thank you.

00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:06.790
[APPLAUSE]
