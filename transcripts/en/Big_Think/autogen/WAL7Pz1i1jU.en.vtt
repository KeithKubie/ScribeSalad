00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.849
one to ten I'm a 1 ok that makes things
a little more complicated but it's

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:40.859
a little more complicated but it's
 

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:42.349
a little more complicated but it's
actually a really really important to

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:42.359
actually a really really important to
 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:44.869
actually a really really important to
understand this if you say to Maria if

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879
understand this if you say to Maria if
 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:47.300

are 1 find out what that obstacle is try

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079
are 1 find out what that obstacle is try
 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:20.749
are 1 find out what that obstacle is try
to make them a 2 and that might give you

00:03:20.749 --> 00:03:20.759
to make them a 2 and that might give you
 

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:22.580
to make them a 2 and that might give you
some more momentum the the example I

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590
some more momentum the the example I
 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.469
some more momentum the the example I
just gave had to do with with parenting
