Welcome to "Evaluate,"

00:00:16.682 --> 00:00:22.488
the show where I evaluate life
on a scale of six to six stars.

00:00:22.521 --> 00:00:26.092
Every evaluation on this show
gets six stars.

00:00:26.125 --> 00:00:28.161
On to our first evaluation, A.J.

00:00:28.194 --> 00:00:31.597 align:start position:0%
- Okay, it's from a viewer
named Haddie

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:32.365 size:81% position:41%
from Wilmington, Delaware.

00:00:32.398 --> 00:00:34.067
- All righty.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.570
- As a woman,
I've always been curious,

00:00:37.603 --> 00:00:40.740
what's it like to be kicked
in the balls?

00:00:40.773 --> 00:00:43.943
- [sighs]
You got to be kidding me.

00:00:43.976 --> 00:00:45.511
I guess I'm going to need
to find someone

00:00:45.544 --> 00:00:46.679
to kick me in the balls.

00:00:46.712 --> 00:00:47.380
I'll be perfectly honest
with you, A.J., this--

00:00:47.413 --> 00:00:49.348
Aaaah!

00:00:49.381 --> 00:00:51.150
Ohh! Oh, [bleep]!
- Oh, no, no, no.

00:00:51.183 --> 00:00:54.420
- Oh, God.
- Oh, my God, I'm--I'm so sorry.

00:00:54.453 --> 00:00:55.922 align:start position:0%
I thought you said for me
to do it.

00:00:55.955 --> 00:00:57.924
- No, I didn't say that.
Ah!

00:00:57.957 --> 00:00:59.125
But it's very helpful,
thank you.

00:00:59.158 --> 00:01:01.861
- I'm sorry!
- Oh, my God, wow!

00:01:01.894 --> 00:01:03.663
[groans]
[bleep].

00:01:03.696 --> 00:01:07.500
It's an agony that starts
in my left testicle and just

00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:09.569
ripples out to every corner
of my body.

00:01:09.602 --> 00:01:11.637 size:84% position:42%
- Oh, God, that's just--
that's weird that it starts

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.773 align:start position:0%
in your left testicle.

00:01:13.806 --> 00:01:15.408
- Oh, no.
Uh, that makes me realize,

00:01:15.441 --> 00:01:18.344
you only kicked me in the
left testicle and that [bleep]

00:01:18.377 --> 00:01:22.548
old lady wants to know what it's
like to be kicked in both balls!

00:01:22.581 --> 00:01:24.183
Plural!
She said, "Kicked in the balls."

00:01:24.216 --> 00:01:25.017 align:start position:0%
- No, please, don't make me
do this again, Forrest.

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.587
- A.J., A.J., A.J., please!

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.590
Kick me in the right ball!
- Oh, my--

00:01:30.623 --> 00:01:31.991
- Otherwise,
I cannot evaluate this.

00:01:32.024 --> 00:01:33.693
Let's go, just do it,
just do it!

00:01:33.726 --> 00:01:34.494
[both scream]

00:01:34.527 --> 00:01:36.496
[wheezing]

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:38.931
[whimpering]

00:01:38.964 --> 00:01:40.266 align:start position:0%
- Did I get it?

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:42.068
<i> - You got it!</i>
- Okay.

00:01:42.101 --> 00:01:45.838
- [groans]
[bleep]!

00:01:45.871 --> 00:01:48.007
Oh, [bleep]!
[groans]

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.044
I give being kicked
in the balls...

00:01:52.077 --> 00:01:54.680
six stars.

00:01:54.713 --> 00:01:56.015
Oh, [bleep].

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.090 align:start position:0%
Giving something six stars
could be a thrilling experience

00:02:04.123 --> 00:02:07.660 align:start position:0%
if done as an expression
of highest approval.

00:02:07.693 --> 00:02:11.330
But when done in a system in
which there is no other choice,

00:02:11.363 --> 00:02:14.901
it is remarkably
unremarkable.

00:02:14.934 --> 00:02:18.471
Giving something six stars:
one star.
