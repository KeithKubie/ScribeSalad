00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:01.760
Okay.

2
00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:04.940
<v 1>Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr and It's time for the Thursday afternoon.</v>

3
00:00:04.941 --> 00:00:08.250
Just before Friday, Monday morning podcast and

4
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.190
ahhh

5
00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:15.970
just checking in on you today.

6
00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.120
Hey, what's going on? How are you? It's a really Thursday afternoon. Um,

7
00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:22.780
I forgot it was Thursday.

8
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.110
I've been so fucking busy doing something that I'm not allowed to announce yet.

9
00:00:26.111 --> 00:00:29.670
And Wink, wink, wink, wink, wake, wake, wake, wink. Um,

10
00:00:29.671 --> 00:00:34.500
for whatever fucking reason. And uh, my phone, shit, the bed, my phone, shit,

11
00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:39.450
the bed, my fucking red, um, phone shit, the bed.

12
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.750
And uh, so I had to go over to Verizon

13
00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.270
and uh, see what the fuck was wrong with.

14
00:00:46.271 --> 00:00:49.150
It turns out when I went to all Canada,

15
00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.770
none of our teams are in the playoffs, but we still have so up,

16
00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:58.000
let's all start up fucking riot. When I went up there,

17
00:00:58.001 --> 00:00:59.470
I didn't have a cell phone plan,

18
00:00:59.471 --> 00:01:04.420
so Verizon just decided out of the fucking moo too.

19
00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.070
Um, I dunno,

20
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.100
just put some sort of block on the things so I wouldn't get some sort of extra

21
00:01:11.291 --> 00:01:15.040
charges, which I had already resigned myself to getting. I'm just like, fuck it.

22
00:01:15.041 --> 00:01:17.080
I'm not getting the plan. I'm up here for three, four days.

23
00:01:17.081 --> 00:01:21.160
I'll have a big cell phone bill. What do I give a fuck? I don't give a shit.

24
00:01:21.161 --> 00:01:24.370
You want me to write some numbers on a piece of paper and then you stick it in

25
00:01:24.371 --> 00:01:26.500
the thing and then the numbers show up on the screen. I mean,

26
00:01:26.501 --> 00:01:29.740
that's how much what money means to me. To me at this fucking point,

27
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.233
it's just like, well,

28
00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.490
well what do you want me to write on the little piece of paper?

29
00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.330
Who gives a fuck? We put a smiley face in the Zeros. That's all we're doing.

30
00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.370
None of us has anything of value.

31
00:01:43.371 --> 00:01:46.310
We just got a bunch of stuff in a fucking hell out. Jesus. Bill,

32
00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.040
you're going down this road. I am. I am going down this road.

33
00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.270
How many people do you know have any think a fucking piece of silver,

34
00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.190
some gold, whatever happened to us. We used to be gentlemen, right?

35
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.420
Our wenches stayed home.

36
00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.780
We rode around on a donkey with our curly cued mustaches.

37
00:02:04.781 --> 00:02:08.500
We had a little Satchel, a fucking gold or some shit, right?

38
00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.130
Then some bandits would come along and they'd take it from you, right?

39
00:02:12.131 --> 00:02:15.070
All dressed in green with the fucking, you know,

40
00:02:15.071 --> 00:02:19.270
leotards on all that Robin Hood Shit. Right.

41
00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.080
Then there was some brought up in the tower. All of that is gone. It's all gone.

42
00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.990
No. Now you work all week. They give you a little piece of paper.

43
00:02:25.991 --> 00:02:27.070
It's got some numbers on it.

44
00:02:27.071 --> 00:02:31.980
You stick it into the ATM and then the numbers show up, right? He goes, hey,

45
00:02:31.981 --> 00:02:35.870
you owe me some money. I'll write some numbers on fucking piece of paper.

46
00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.440
You Go, all right, thank you.

47
00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.930
You know it all works until it doesn't. And then what do you get here?

48
00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.640
It's going to happen. You're not going to have anything. So anyways. Yeah.

49
00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.360
So I don't give a fuck. And what, what do I give a big cell phone bill?

50
00:02:49.361 --> 00:02:52.450
What do I give a shit? If it's more numbers on a piece of paper, it's not

51
00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:55.120
<v 0>better.</v>

52
00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.750
<v 1>I guess at the end of the day it is where something, but I just, I don't give a</v>

53
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.200
about a high cell phone bill and I don't give a shit about sky miles.

54
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.230
I just don't give a fuck. You know what I mean?

55
00:03:08.231 --> 00:03:11.330
You don't like when you have some miles with somebody and they go, oh you,

56
00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.700
you better use these. You better use are they're gonna expire.

57
00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.350
I always call them up. You Ca. Yeah. Well you know you can keep them.

58
00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.130
I don't need you fucking miles or I take them now. I don't give a shit.

59
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.330
Stop threatening me with your stupid fucking miles by now.

60
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.000
If I need a plane ticket, I'll buy one.

61
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.650
Anything to not have to go into your fucking website and figure out where I can

62
00:03:35.651 --> 00:03:39.070
fly with my so called free miles already paid for it. They're not free.

63
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.710
You can't, Oh God, I'm in a mood. So anyways,

64
00:03:42.711 --> 00:03:45.940
so my phone didn't fucking work. So whenever,

65
00:03:45.941 --> 00:03:47.990
so I went up there and they put a block on it so I wouldn't,

66
00:03:47.991 --> 00:03:51.820
I have to write a bigger number on a piece of paper and send it to them so they

67
00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.740
can stick it in their ATM machine. And, uh,

68
00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.990
when I came back it was still blocked. So I went over to the Verizon place,

69
00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:04.420
turned out the person who helped me out was a fucking lesson. Right.

70
00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.510
And he's trying to help me fix the phone or what's killing me is his company did

71
00:04:11.171 --> 00:04:14.860
the thing to my phone that's now made my phone fucked up and they can't figure

72
00:04:14.861 --> 00:04:17.680
out how to undo it. And, uh, you know,

73
00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.210
I tried as long as I could to keep my cool. I didn't flip out that,

74
00:04:22.211 --> 00:04:26.590
but I dropped a couple of f bumps. I'm glad he told me that, you know,

75
00:04:26.591 --> 00:04:29.020
he was a listener of the podcast because, you know,

76
00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.110
if he didn't say that then I just would have been, you know,

77
00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:36.640
I wouldn't have been on my best behavior and I would have said fuck a lot more.

78
00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.450
Um, it took me two trips over there cause then they were like, all right,

79
00:04:40.451 --> 00:04:43.090
well I think we fixed it. This is like an hour later.

80
00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:47.560
I think we fixed it and uh, it should, you know,

81
00:04:47.561 --> 00:04:52.510
reboot by tomorrow morning. So I was like, alright, fine. You know,

82
00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.790
I get back to the office, I can't fucking, you know,

83
00:04:54.791 --> 00:04:58.180
I go to text my lovely wife, it's not going through. I'm like, what the fuck?

84
00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.660
So I saw Ellen, maybe I'll call her, cause I wanted him to take the, uh,

85
00:05:01.661 --> 00:05:04.030
the capital's against the fucking floor.

86
00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:10.600
I wanted to tape the game, you know, and uh,

87
00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.260
I went to call up and it just, I called her number and it just goes,

88
00:05:14.261 --> 00:05:15.580
welcome to Verizon.

89
00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.870
Please enter your last four digits of your social security number.

90
00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.780
Please enter this by pressing one.

91
00:05:22.781 --> 00:05:26.410
You agree to a two year contract with Verizon.

92
00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.830
If you come out early, you will yellow. It's upon. I'm like,

93
00:05:29.831 --> 00:05:33.690
what the fuck is this? So I uh,

94
00:05:33.691 --> 00:05:37.150
I had ended up having to go back to the fucking place and um,

95
00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:41.260
this other guy got on and he figured out what the fuck was wrong with this and

96
00:05:41.261 --> 00:05:43.880
now my phone is fine. So I've just, I've had one of those fucking day.

97
00:05:43.881 --> 00:05:46.300
So when I was in there I was just thinking, you know, and I was just like,

98
00:05:46.301 --> 00:05:49.390
you know, my can't listen to my music. And they were like,

99
00:05:49.391 --> 00:05:51.190
oh that's cause it's on the cloud. And I was like,

100
00:05:51.191 --> 00:05:54.700
I never wanted to be on the cloud. I don't want to be on that fucking thing.

101
00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:58.730
I don't want you guys seeing what the fuck I'm doing. Leave me alone.

102
00:05:58.731 --> 00:06:02.570
I keep opting out of that fucking thing. But every time I reboot my phone,

103
00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.600
it just fucking automatically starts back up or some shit.

104
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:09.030
You fucking nosy nerdy cunts.

105
00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:11.120
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

106
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.210
<v 1>They always sit like act on like to do when you will fucking favor. You know,</v>

107
00:06:14.211 --> 00:06:15.290
someone was telling me that,

108
00:06:15.291 --> 00:06:18.140
that that shit about them sharing your private information. I,

109
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:22.910
which I've said the entire fucking time that they should get your permission

110
00:06:22.911 --> 00:06:27.020
first. And certainly if they go and resell it, you ought to get a cut of it,

111
00:06:27.021 --> 00:06:29.270
right? I mean, it's your personal information too.

112
00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.270
They act as a broker of shouldn't you get a fee?

113
00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:37.070
I guess that's in the Supreme Court. That's what somebody told me.

114
00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:40.940
He wasn't a lawyer and I can even remember who it was. Um,

115
00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:46.280
so anyways, so as I'm sitting there is time is time's going by.

116
00:06:46.281 --> 00:06:48.500
I started looking at the flip phones and I was like, Oh man,

117
00:06:48.501 --> 00:06:51.440
I love these things. Flip loans, what great. You know,

118
00:06:51.441 --> 00:06:55.550
a little fucking size of a hockey but not even the size of a hockey puck right

119
00:06:55.551 --> 00:06:56.600
in your pocket. You know what I mean?

120
00:06:56.601 --> 00:06:58.430
But what killed me was they all had a camera on them,

121
00:06:58.431 --> 00:06:59.720
which I don't fucking like,

122
00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:02.180
and I didn't have time to ask the guy who's going to do,

123
00:07:02.181 --> 00:07:04.400
you just have a flip phone that has no fucking camera on it.

124
00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:07.910
And maybe I'll go back to this and I asked the other guy asked the other guy,

125
00:07:07.911 --> 00:07:10.880
these are all young guys, right? Born in the 90s, right? So I'm like,

126
00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:14.480
do they still sell, sell iPods? And he's like, yeah,

127
00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:17.060
apple store best buy or whatever. So I say, fuck it.

128
00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:22.090
I'll just put all my music on the fucking my iPod,

129
00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:25.700
right. And then I'll just get one of these flip phones.

130
00:07:25.701 --> 00:07:28.490
And I was really trying to think what the fuck I would be missing out on.

131
00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:32.030
It would take me longer to text my pictures wouldn't be as good.

132
00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:36.240
Who gives a fuck? My video would be as good. Who gives a fuck and a,

133
00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:39.020
you know what the deal breaker was? The GPS system.

134
00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:43.160
I don't want to go back to m and a Tom. I still have a Thomas Guide,

135
00:07:43.161 --> 00:07:47.030
my fucking Prius. I don't want to have to go back to looking up shit. I mean,

136
00:07:47.031 --> 00:07:49.610
as much as I would like to use my brain to do that again,

137
00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:55.070
out of all the things that they've made easier, um, I think, uh,

138
00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:59.150
you know, I got gotta give it up as much as, as epic as a curmudgeon,

139
00:07:59.151 --> 00:08:03.200
that I am the a, the fucking thing telling you where to go is great.

140
00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:04.310
You know,

141
00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:07.250
even though I've probably already pitched about it on the podcast and that was

142
00:08:07.251 --> 00:08:09.860
sort of the deal breaker, I was like, well I got, I got to have one of those.

143
00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:12.020
Right. I at least got to have that.

144
00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:16.700
I don't want to go back to looking at fucking maps and shit, you know,

145
00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:20.810
although I could figure it out, most of it, I dunno.

146
00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:25.460
I think what would end up happening is not the social aspect of it would be the

147
00:08:25.461 --> 00:08:28.190
business aspect. I don't do the Uber thing,

148
00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:31.160
so I wouldn't be missing out on that.

149
00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:34.730
And I don't fucking order food that way, do I?

150
00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:40.340
No, I don't, I don't even know what the fuck I have it flow.

151
00:08:40.341 --> 00:08:44.250
Is this still a podcast? Is it just me? Just fucking boy.

152
00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:48.650
I've always babble anyways. Um, yeah,

153
00:08:48.651 --> 00:08:51.350
I've had a fucking brutal week, man. I lost my fucking shit.

154
00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:56.230
Like my temper has never been worse. It's never been worse. I, I,

155
00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:59.310
I need to, uh, I need to fucking relax.

156
00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:04.360
Um, I was working all day and all I wanted was some spaghetti and meatballs.

157
00:09:04.361 --> 00:09:07.210
I got this fucking Italian joint. They make the homemade noodles,

158
00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:11.140
the meatballs are fucking damn good, you know? And I just went a craving for it.

159
00:09:11.141 --> 00:09:12.880
I'm like, I'm fucking getting that right.

160
00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:18.430
So I get home and I say to my lovely wife, I go, Hey, can you,

161
00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:22.030
can you fucking hit the app thing that gets the person to go pick up your food?

162
00:09:22.031 --> 00:09:24.300
And we'll once again, you know,

163
00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:29.460
once again have faith that this person outside of the food industry is not going

164
00:09:29.461 --> 00:09:32.740
to do anything to this food. You know? Have you seen that thing?

165
00:09:32.741 --> 00:09:35.860
The guy in the fucking elevator eating some shit off the top of the pizza.

166
00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:42.940
And of course we call the restaurant. They don't do it.

167
00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:45.790
Postmate it can you postmate the fucking thing and they're like, oh,

168
00:09:45.791 --> 00:09:48.460
we don't do that over here. We're a real restaurant. So I'm like, all right,

169
00:09:48.461 --> 00:09:51.070
well we put in the order and my wife wanted some white fish.

170
00:09:51.071 --> 00:09:52.090
I'm going to get to spaghetti.

171
00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:57.400
So I fucking drive over there and jam pack with people. I go, yeah,

172
00:09:57.401 --> 00:09:58.450
hey, a pickup order.

173
00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:02.280
<v 3>She goes, oh, is that for this spaghetti in a white fish? I was like, yeah,</v>

174
00:10:02.281 --> 00:10:05.190
it was. She's like, oh, we ran out of fish.

175
00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:09.970
So I didn't put it in. And did you still want the spaghetti?

176
00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:13.830
<v 1>Yeah, and I swear to God, man,</v>

177
00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:18.970
it's like we fucking call 10 minutes ago,

178
00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:23.470
it took you 10 minutes to figure out you were out of fish. I just said,

179
00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:24.880
you know what, hang on a second.

180
00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:29.590
Because I knew I was going to snap and I just walked out of the restaurant and

181
00:10:29.591 --> 00:10:33.040
the second I got outside I just started cock sucking motherfucker.

182
00:10:33.041 --> 00:10:36.490
The fuck does it take the fucking God damn fucking fuck is we get just flipping

183
00:10:36.491 --> 00:10:40.660
out. Right? Was it screaming? Just cook, suck that type of shit right. Far Away.

184
00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:41.830
You'd think I was speaking German,

185
00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:46.030
I should [inaudible] cock sucking motherfucker. Right.

186
00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:50.260
And I heard these two people, those people are eating outside.

187
00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:52.600
They started laughing at me, right?

188
00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:55.930
And I didn't give a shit and I just kept him on a fucking and then got my Prius

189
00:10:55.931 --> 00:10:57.960
and just glided away. Just whoosh.

190
00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:04.300
Made a complete and utter fucking full of myself.

191
00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:10.060
Complete and utter fucking fool of myself. And um, okay. You know,

192
00:11:10.061 --> 00:11:12.820
I go to these great periods. It's almost like my cigar smoking.

193
00:11:12.821 --> 00:11:16.390
I just go to this great periods where I'm just not, I got it under control,

194
00:11:16.391 --> 00:11:20.480
I got it under control and then it just slowly, you know,

195
00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:24.520
spins out of control. And right now, you know, I'm not smoking a lot.

196
00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:27.400
I'm drinking a little bit, but nothing crazy.

197
00:11:27.401 --> 00:11:30.250
I think I have everything under control and just something has to,

198
00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:33.220
something's got to give. You know what I mean? It's like you give up smoking,

199
00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:38.130
you eat like a fucking pig, you know? I don't know. You start working out.

200
00:11:38.131 --> 00:11:39.960
There's always something. Just got to balance it out.

201
00:11:39.961 --> 00:11:44.550
I these these fucking people that are nothing but do gooders. I mean,

202
00:11:44.551 --> 00:11:46.800
I don't know. Maybe they are robots. I don't know what the, what they are.

203
00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:49.350
Well maybe they just never exposed themselves to fun shit.

204
00:11:49.351 --> 00:11:51.210
But for the love of God, I can't do it.

205
00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:54.760
I cannot 100% just be a decent human being.

206
00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:59.980
I don't think it's a, I don't think it's possible. I have too much free time.

207
00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:02.560
Maybe that's what it is. I mean,

208
00:12:02.561 --> 00:12:07.000
I'm just a piece of shit and I'm looking for an excuse. I don't fucking know.

209
00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:09.670
But, um, anyways,

210
00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:12.580
I haven't been able to work out as much as I want to.

211
00:12:12.581 --> 00:12:15.400
I think that Burns off a lot of the bullshit. But, uh, anyway,

212
00:12:15.401 --> 00:12:19.830
speaking of which, the gym, the gym, the gym, the jumps getting a,

213
00:12:19.831 --> 00:12:23.610
I get the floor put in Friday, it's a three day process.

214
00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:28.410
This epoxy floor, it's sort of the A, they call it a lob, the lava flow.

215
00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:29.490
It's,

216
00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:33.180
it's really fucking cool looking or it's going to look out of style in fucking

217
00:12:33.181 --> 00:12:34.830
three days. I don't know what, but uh,

218
00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:38.700
I did go with the gray was sort of a black blackish tinge to it,

219
00:12:38.701 --> 00:12:42.620
so I Nice muted fucking color and uh,

220
00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:45.570
Nia told me to get a mirror in there, you know,

221
00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:49.170
cause she wants to look at her form when she's doing whatever the hell she's

222
00:12:49.171 --> 00:12:51.870
doing. I don't know what she's going to be doing. She wants to look at her form.

223
00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:55.950
I don't use gyms for my form. I just mirrors,

224
00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:58.200
I'm should say I never use those for my form.

225
00:12:58.201 --> 00:13:02.460
I wait until after I'm done lifting. And then I used a mirror to flexing.

226
00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:05.970
I just walk off and go, yeah, right. That's all I use it for.

227
00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:12.330
That's why there's always debt's going to be a lot of breadth marks on my, uh,

228
00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:16.760
my fucking mirror. Um, I can't fucking wait.

229
00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:21.290
And, um, so my goal is every day before work,

230
00:13:21.291 --> 00:13:24.740
this thing I'm working on that I'm not allowed to talk about, um,

231
00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:28.100
is I'm going to work out in the morning, take my dog for a hike,

232
00:13:28.101 --> 00:13:29.240
I'm going to work out in the morning,

233
00:13:29.241 --> 00:13:32.210
and then I'm going to put it in a solid fucking day. And at the end of the day,

234
00:13:32.211 --> 00:13:33.080
I'm going to come home.

235
00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:36.800
Daddy's going to have a little bingo bangle and I'm going to talk to my lovely

236
00:13:36.801 --> 00:13:41.000
wife and I'm going to go to bed. That's what my life's going to be like. Um,

237
00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:43.730
that is the goal. Anyways, you know.

238
00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:48.090
So this contractor that I have working on this thing, yeah.

239
00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:52.520
Unlike my last one is a fucking guys writer's rank.

240
00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:55.820
So, uh, it's been, it's been a fucking wonderful thing. However,

241
00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:58.190
let's stop talking about this bullshit. All right.

242
00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:05.210
Um, how about the fucking NHL playoffs? Playoffs. Oh, first of all,

243
00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:08.900
congratulations to the Golden State Warriors.

244
00:14:08.901 --> 00:14:13.700
73 fucking wins. 73 and nine.

245
00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:19.970
I gotta tell you, I don't know. That took 20 years for someone to beat 72.

246
00:14:19.971 --> 00:14:22.580
Do you think somebody ever beats? I mean,

247
00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:25.430
think it's a single digit loss for the season.

248
00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:30.590
That's fucking unbelievable. That's, that's about as borderline on, bro.

249
00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:35.570
I think that that really, um, well, you know,

250
00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:38.900
I don't know enough about who po, who had, who had the record before the bulls.

251
00:14:38.901 --> 00:14:43.850
Like how long those records last? I'm 73 and nine.

252
00:14:43.851 --> 00:14:47.570
That's, that's going to be a tough one. It's basically the,

253
00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:52.550
not even the 96 bulls won that many fucking games. Um,

254
00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:55.430
but I, you know, those guys, if you had that carrot dangling in front of them,

255
00:14:55.431 --> 00:14:57.350
they'd somehow fucking figure out how to win 70.

256
00:14:57.550 --> 00:15:02.210
Somebody's got to go 74 and eight. I don't know that you can do that. Um,

257
00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:04.730
and I don't know that I know all the rules of basketball either.

258
00:15:04.731 --> 00:15:07.130
So take that with a giant grain of salt.

259
00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:09.573
<v 0>Um,</v>

260
00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:14.690
<v 1>congratulations to them and congratulations to Koby Bryant Hall of fame career</v>

261
00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:18.990
going out with 60 points on 50 shots, which I thought was perfect.

262
00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:22.860
You never considered your teammates your entire career.

263
00:15:22.861 --> 00:15:24.510
Why would you do it on your last night?

264
00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:26.350
<v 0>Okay.</v>

265
00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:30.610
<v 1>I thought it was the perfect way. Went out and I love that Nike Commercial,</v>

266
00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:35.290
the Nike commercial where he stands in the middle of the court and the Celtic

267
00:15:35.291 --> 00:15:39.820
fans, really an actor in Celtic gear gets up and starts singing to him.

268
00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:44.710
I just add all the fans around the league are singing how they hate them,

269
00:15:44.711 --> 00:15:48.980
but they really love him and respect him. And there's no other teammates. No.

270
00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:50.080
Are the Lakers?

271
00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:54.370
No fucking nod to the past of fucking magic and Kareem,

272
00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:57.610
no thanks Phil Jackson. No nothing.

273
00:15:57.730 --> 00:16:02.080
Just Coby standing in the middle of the court in the fucking Christ pose with

274
00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:07.120
his fucking arms out and it was absolutely fucking perfect. Great job.

275
00:16:07.121 --> 00:16:08.800
Nike. Great fucking job.

276
00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:11.183
<v 0>Um,</v>

277
00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:14.270
<v 1>one of the greatest one-on-one fucking players you're ever gonna see,</v>

278
00:16:14.271 --> 00:16:17.450
one of the greatest outside shooters you're ever going to see. And uh,

279
00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:21.800
one of the biggest cancer's in a locker room that ever fucking existed more.

280
00:16:21.801 --> 00:16:25.180
He was sort of the second coming of will Chamberland as far as the,

281
00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:30.020
the points that he scored versus what the fuck he did in the locker room. And

282
00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:31.840
<v 0>um,</v>

283
00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:35.290
<v 1>I just thought it was fucking pervy took 50 fucking shots.</v>

284
00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:40.890
<v 0>Ah,</v>

285
00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:43.330
<v 1>I don't, I don't think it could have been any more perfect. That was just,</v>

286
00:16:43.331 --> 00:16:47.500
it was phenomenal. And it was, that is Coby. He takes 50 shots. He annoys you,

287
00:16:47.501 --> 00:16:50.140
but he scored 60 points. You know what I mean?

288
00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:54.490
I honestly think that I could have played on a lot of those Laker tease because

289
00:16:54.491 --> 00:16:56.560
he, you know, he's not going to throw it to you anyways.

290

357
00:21:11.051 --> 00:21:13.750
violated? Is it the pushy salespeople?

358
00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:17.380
Is it the homeless guy who just walked in off the street and rolled his head

359
00:21:17.381 --> 00:21:22.180
around the pillows, the fake President Day sale or the fact that you know,

360
00:21:22.181 --> 00:21:27.181
you'll regret what you bought as you do the walk of shame out of the mattress

Good Lord. What the fuck did they do with that mattress? No questions asked.

376
00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:31.780
It's like it never happened. Oh my God. And it goes, where does it go?

377
00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:36.580
Go somewhere to the South Pacific. If you do love your new helix smack mattress,

keep it in and your dignity. That's why everyone in GQ magazine,

379
00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:42.010
what they do with the mattress,

380
00:22:42.011 --> 00:22:46.570
they ship it back and whoever made the thing in the sweatshop gets executed and

381
00:22:46.571 --> 00:22:49.600
then they fall out of the mattress and they fold them up and throw them in the

382
00:22:49.601 --> 00:22:52.600
ocean. That's what's really going on behind the scenes.

383
00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:57.130
If you do love your new helix mattress, keep it and your you and your dignity.

384
00:22:57.220 --> 00:23:01.570
That's why everyone from GQ magazines to Forbes are all talking about helicopter

helix, sleep. Oh, it's not because you're paying them to,

389
00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:24.490
what am I going to left here? 23 more fucking minutes. Oh,

390
00:23:24.491 --> 00:23:26.860
I was driving home today. Bududa aloo dude.

391
00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:31.600
And somebody in front of me was smoking a cigar and I had my phone, my Ed,

392
00:23:31.601 --> 00:23:34.870
my window down just a little bit. This is how much this habit has me.

393
00:23:34.871 --> 00:23:38.560
I was like, oh my God. And I rolled it all the way down and was like, yeah,

394
00:23:38.561 --> 00:23:41.830
go ahead, dog sticks a 10 out the window or ace Ventura.

395
00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:42.663
That's what I was doing,

396
00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:45.490
driving behind the guy and I was trying to figure it and I drove up next to him

397
00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:48.470
going like, wow, the fucking guy's smoking his cigar in that nice car.

398
00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:53.510
That's some old school shit. And they pulled up and it wasn't him and um,

399
00:23:53.511 --> 00:23:54.344
I couldn't, you know,

400
00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:58.100
I couldn't figure out who was smoking the cigar and I realized that cigar smoke

401
00:23:58.101 --> 00:23:59.570
is so fucking stinky.

402
00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:03.380
It could've literally just been like three people smoking on a porch and I drove

403
00:24:03.381 --> 00:24:07.510
by and God damn and I'm missing. Okay.

404
00:24:07.770 --> 00:24:09.420
I Dunno if this is a good idea, you guys,

405
00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:12.990
this whole fucking two cigars a month because this is like when I try to go easy

406
00:24:12.991 --> 00:24:15.270
with the booze and you know, when I go,

407
00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:19.560
when I try to take long periods of time off from boozing, it doesn't make me go,

408
00:24:19.561 --> 00:24:21.720
you know what? I don't think, I don't think I miss drinking.

409
00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:25.080
I don't ever need to drink again. What it makes me feel like is, you know,

410
00:24:25.710 --> 00:24:29.490
I would like to drink a case of beer by myself and see if I can finish a fifth

411
00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:31.200
object annually. That's what it makes me feel like.

412
00:24:31.201 --> 00:24:35.280
So I think I need to feed the beast a little bit. Um,

413
00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:41.110
having said that til I drove her home behind the person smoking that

414
00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:45.810
unbelievably wonderful smelling cigar, I um,

415
00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:49.570
I was actually going like, you know what? I think I can make it to my birthday,

416
00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:53.440
which is in June. And if I didn't do that, then I would be,

417
00:24:53.441 --> 00:24:58.020
how many did I smoke this year to? Four, six and a half.

418
00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:01.810
Six and a half. Because one when I smoked half and it wasn't smoking. Well,

419
00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:04.080
sweet. I still count that one. So six and a half.

420
00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:07.740
That would be June and I would be looking at like, I'd smoked about one a month.

421
00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:12.950
Right. I think that'd be all right. I think that would be okay.

422
00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:16.430
You know, actually, in reality, could she just do heroin once a month?

423
00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:19.760
If you just did heroin once a month, 12 times a fucking year,

424
00:25:19.761 --> 00:25:22.820
if you didn't do it 12 days in a row, six days in a row. So it didn't get you,

425
00:25:22.821 --> 00:25:25.670
you just did it. That's what they ought to have.

426
00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:29.330
They ought to just have like the heroin spot,

427
00:25:30.410 --> 00:25:34.400
right? And you got a fucking punch card. There's no way to falsify it.

428
00:25:34.401 --> 00:25:36.590
No way to sell somebody else's or whatever.

429
00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:41.920
And just once a month like would you try it just to see what it was like if

430
00:25:42.561 --> 00:25:45.680
there was just fucking heroin, you could go,

431
00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:49.640
you could fucking try it and no matter how bad and if you just like,

432
00:25:49.641 --> 00:25:52.640
I just wanted to do it once just to see what it felt like.

433
00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:55.220
And then you just walk away and you never do it again.

434
00:25:56.180 --> 00:26:00.620
Or if like you kind of, you liked it, right?

435
00:26:00.650 --> 00:26:03.470
Which why wouldn't you? I heard it's like the greatest feeling ever. Right?

436
00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:06.980
Why if they, if they fucking managed it for you

437
00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:10.880
and you just had that fucking bitch and there was just nothing you could do

438
00:26:10.881 --> 00:26:12.920
about it. And then once a month you go in, you shoot up,

439
00:26:14.570 --> 00:26:16.880
it's fucking awesome and everybody can be excited

440
00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:21.150
like coming up, you know? And they have like a, like a,

441
00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:25.580
every the beginning of every month they'd have like a Raffle, right? Like,

442
00:26:25.581 --> 00:26:28.670
like um, what do you call it?

443
00:26:28.671 --> 00:26:32.810
The lottery and instead of like nine balls coming out, it's just one ball,

444
00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:37.100
right? It just comes out right? It comes out all right.

445
00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:38.990
Month. April,

446
00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:44.500
heroine day is the 17th seventh Emmy's a god fuck 17 [inaudible] the everybody

447
00:26:46.741 --> 00:26:50.550
does smack on the 17th except for people that you know,

448
00:26:50.670 --> 00:26:52.770
got to keep like reactors going and shit like that.

449
00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:57.720
They get to do it on like the 18th provided this someone then someone to be hung

450
00:26:57.721 --> 00:27:01.440
over from heroin or whatever the, fuck you kidding. I don't know.

451
00:27:01.441 --> 00:27:04.800
We'd have to work that out. Catch just have heroin day,

452
00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:07.950
you know,

453
00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:12.240
once a week everybody just gets fucked up and you can opt out right once a month

454
00:27:12.241 --> 00:27:15.720
to do heroin and then you have like, you know,

455
00:27:17.030 --> 00:27:19.920
Bose and days, there's gotta be a way to do it

456
00:27:21.450 --> 00:27:26.450
where the government just becomes a big fucking drug dealer and babysitter now.

457
00:27:26.701 --> 00:27:29.280
But the, he imagine the fucking lines in. If everybody's got to get ahead,

458
00:27:29.281 --> 00:27:32.250
that doesn't work. I guess you got to manage it yourself.

459
00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:36.960
I guess that is the problem. You know the government won't step in then.

460
00:27:37.050 --> 00:27:37.231
You know what?

461
00:27:37.231 --> 00:27:39.840
They can't collect enough money off of these super rich fucking people.

462
00:27:39.841 --> 00:27:40.440
That's what it is.

463
00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:43.200
They get the money outside the country and then you got too many other people

464
00:27:43.201 --> 00:27:45.750
sitting around their sweatpants and they don't want to fucking work, you know,

465
00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:48.000
and then fucking, you know, regular people,

466
00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:50.310
regular people like us right down the fucking metal.

467
00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:52.650
I'm going to say everybody listen to this podcast is regular.

468
00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:56.100
He's somewhere somewhere right in the middle. Huh?

469
00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:59.940
Pay In taxes out the fucking ass, aren't ya? Ah.

470
00:28:00.330 --> 00:28:03.960
Shouldn't you get heroin once a month, once a month.

471
00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:08.340
The heroin store. That's where they should do for the middle class.

472
00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:10.980
That's getting squeezed out. You just once a month,

473
00:28:11.250 --> 00:28:14.640
they shoot you up once every couple of months you get to this side,

474
00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:16.230
but no more than once a month.

475
00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:22.230
You know you do it on a Saturday, right? You're just fucking not enough.

476
00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:26.370
And that's it. One Nice fucking dose and then,

477
00:28:26.371 --> 00:28:29.820
I dunno what you shiver and shake a little bit. Eat some fucking Jett, one dose.

478
00:28:29.910 --> 00:28:33.330
You're not going to get hooked at you. You know, and I gotta look this up.

479
00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:38.310
Heroin once a month. Hey,

480
00:28:38.311 --> 00:28:41.610
little girl, do some heroin once a fucking month.

481
00:28:42.090 --> 00:28:44.970
I don't think you'll get addicted.

482
00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:50.490
I always spelled this wrong, by the way. No Ian, it no heroes here.

483
00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:54.420
Heroin once a month.

484
00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:55.773
<v 2>All right.</v>

485
00:28:56.790 --> 00:29:01.740
<v 1>Heroin Rehab, treatment opinions. Can the use of heroin be casual?</v>

486
00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:08.280
This is the beginning of a life changing decision right here.

487
00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:12.090
Can you use heroin? Okay. Know, and all of us too. It's a chat room.

488
00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:17.860
Okay. It seems from all government propaganda, don't we love it?

489
00:29:17.861 --> 00:29:20.860
And most threads in discussions here on whatever this is,

490
00:29:20.861 --> 00:29:23.380
that heroin is for addicts and junkies.

491
00:29:23.650 --> 00:29:28.650
Is it the case that one can take heroin for a onetime experiment slash

492
00:29:29.051 --> 00:29:33.850
experience in order to witness the effects? Uh, please share.

493
00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:38.110
Um, that's not a good word to use in a heroin chat. Roma, uh,

494
00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:43.540
please share experiences with each, with one time users versus long time.

495
00:29:43.541 --> 00:29:44.171
All right. Yes.

496
00:29:44.171 --> 00:29:49.060
There are people who will use heroin once or a few times and will not return to

497
00:29:49.061 --> 00:29:52.780
it. Usually it takes two or more tries to really enjoy it.

498
00:29:53.050 --> 00:29:58.050
First time users usually feel a bit nauseous or used to back in the day this was

499
00:29:58.151 --> 00:30:01.330
smoking. This means you will not be a fuck you. Fuck you.

500
00:30:01.331 --> 00:30:05.740
You're just some regular person. I want a doctor, uh,

501
00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:10.540
answers. Let's go to answers.yahoo.com.

502
00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:13.393
<v 0>Come on.</v>

503
00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:18.240
<v 1>Come on. Low. Debbie, go. Is it, can you use heroin one time? Ah,</v>

504
00:30:18.330 --> 00:30:22.020
best answer. Capital. No, not at all.

505
00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:24.750
I'm a retired heroin dealer.

506
00:30:25.170 --> 00:30:29.010
I know what happened to my customers when they tried to only use it casually

507
00:30:29.011 --> 00:30:32.880
when they were partying. They became addicted. Their lives became miserable.

508
00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:36.600
A lot of them ended up homeless in jail, losing jobs,

509
00:30:36.601 --> 00:30:39.600
flunking out of college while I profited off them.

510
00:30:39.601 --> 00:30:42.540
Let's see if that comes in here and any other bad luck you can think of.

511
00:30:42.541 --> 00:30:44.790
Their families ended up being prostitutes.

512
00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:48.690
Heroin use is completely miserable life and there's no way to use it

513
00:30:48.691 --> 00:30:49.501
responsibly.

514
00:30:49.501 --> 00:30:53.820
People can become addicted to heroin the first time they use it and try it,

515
00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:58.200
Yada, Yada, Yada. This other person said, it's very, very unlikely.

516
00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:03.120
I'm a foreign heroin addict who's in a Methadone program right now and you're in

517
00:31:03.121 --> 00:31:04.920
a chat room. Fucking multitasking.

518
00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:08.400
Another person that may be possible for some personalities.

519
00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:13.530
Is it worth the risk? What is the benefit to gain? Somebody says,

520
00:31:13.531 --> 00:31:16.500
don't know. Go roll up a fatty.

521
00:31:17.970 --> 00:31:21.210
What was that movie where Alan Arkin just started using heroin when he was like

522
00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:25.350
80 if I were to shoot heroin once a week for the rest of my life.

523
00:31:27.910 --> 00:31:32.500
Let's see here. This is on reddit. This is the last one.

524
00:31:33.250 --> 00:31:36.370
Hypothetical, of course, never done it. A Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

525
00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:37.990
I'm interested in the effects.

526
00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:42.820
Suppose I shut up a purely and safe safely measured dose every Friday.

527
00:31:42.821 --> 00:31:47.440
Where would you get that from a drug dealer. I mean it's not regulated.

528
00:31:47.530 --> 00:31:48.100
All right. You know what,

529
00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:52.780
this is probably one of the dumbest questions I've ever asked in mercifully the

530
00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:55.030
half hour is over. Um, so don't do it people.

531
00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:56.693
<v 0>Okay.</v>

532
00:31:58.330 --> 00:32:01.510
<v 1>I, you know, it's something I've never heard the expression recreational heroin,</v>

533
00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:02.440
heroin user,

534
00:32:02.770 --> 00:32:05.470
although God knows somebody is going to write in and claim that they could do

535
00:32:05.471 --> 00:32:08.190
it. So you know what more power to you, but I would never fuck with that. Um,

536
00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:11.410
anyways, this has been the Thursday afternoon, just before Friday,

537
00:32:11.411 --> 00:32:14.380
Monday morning podcast. Just checking in idea. Um,

538
00:32:14.410 --> 00:32:17.770

539
00:32:18.190 --> 00:32:21.670
we got some classic kits from Monday morning podcast gone by.

540
00:32:22.450 --> 00:32:24.550

550
00:32:57.480 --> 00:32:58.710
You met some woman saying, Hey,

551
00:32:58.711 --> 00:33:01.530
you know I love your dress down to your ankles and your giant hat.

552

00:34:16.810 --> 00:34:17.643

the show phony. Whose been

559
00:34:25.570 --> 00:34:28.030
[inaudible] that's before I left,

560
00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:33.560
before I go to the, into the trees. I hit my hay.

561
00:34:34.270 --> 00:34:36.980
<v 4>Hey, what's going on? It's bill bar.</v>

562
00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:42.530
It's the Monday morning morning podcast and I'm doing it on Tuesday because,

563
00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:44.840
uh, cause you know what,

564
00:34:44.841 --> 00:34:48.800
I did one yesterday and I was in the,

565
00:34:48.801 --> 00:34:53.720
I was in an airport again and uh, it just suck. That's what happened.

566
00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:55.670
It started off good. You know what I mean?

567
00:34:56.510 --> 00:35:00.410
And then it was like evil Knievel when he was jumping the snake river, you know,

568
00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:04.760
and they fucking, uh, they let them off. You know, when he went across,

569
00:35:04.761 --> 00:35:07.100
you're like, Holy Shit, he's going to make, he's go to pass.

570
00:35:07.101 --> 00:35:09.770
You came out and he just fucking went straight down. So that's what happened.

571
00:35:10.730 --> 00:35:13.640
He went right into the fucking river and somehow all they got was a bloody nose.

572
00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:19.670
Um, that's what happened to me yesterday. I went to do the podcast, um,

573
00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:25.130
as I was waiting to get on my jet blue flight, exit row was all set,

574
00:35:25.131 --> 00:35:29.240
everything was great. And uh, you know,

575
00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:31.220
all of a sudden they said that we were switching planes.

576
00:35:31.221 --> 00:35:33.740
We had to get off the fucking plane. That's what happened.

577
00:35:33.830 --> 00:35:36.320
Then I was in the terminal and then I was pissing in the airport again.

578
00:35:36.321 --> 00:35:40.040
And how many have I done that on my podcast? Oh, I'm bill burrow.

579
00:35:40.050 --> 00:35:42.990
I'm in an airport. I'm not happy. You know what I mean?

580
00:35:43.110 --> 00:35:47.580
Did he really want to fucking hear that story again? And uh,

581
00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:51.300
so I was getting self conscious about that. That's what happened.

582
00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:53.430
Now that that's the real thing. That's what happened.

583
00:35:53.530 --> 00:35:55.320
Then I got self conscious about it,

584
00:35:55.620 --> 00:36:00.030
which made me lose my train of thought and the whole thing lost its fucking

585
00:36:00.031 --> 00:36:00.661
momentum.

586
00:36:00.661 --> 00:36:04.260
And the whole podcast went right down to the snake river and that's what

587
00:36:04.261 --> 00:36:05.190
happened. Okay.

588
00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:09.840
And my nose is bleeding on the plane and everybody thought I was doing coke and

589
00:36:09.841 --> 00:36:13.050
I was trying to say that I wasn't. And then the stewardess was just like,

590
00:36:13.051 --> 00:36:15.420
is there a problem sir? Is there a problem? You know,

591
00:36:15.450 --> 00:36:19.410
she waved the Patriot Act to my face. Um, all right.

592
00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:24.120
So anyways, uh, this spill burrows, I mentioned at the top of the poor coast,

593
00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:28.440
um, if you're new to my page, I do one of these every single Monday. All right.

594
00:36:28.441 --> 00:36:31.530
And I have to think that somebody new to my page because a,

595
00:36:31.531 --> 00:36:35.040
I had my big fancy special, uh, Sunday night.

596
00:36:35.070 --> 00:36:38.520
Why do I do this on comedy central? And if I had half a brain,

597
00:36:38.521 --> 00:36:43.521
I could give you some times as to when it's going to be replaying again,

598
00:36:43.891 --> 00:36:45.930
which of course I don't know. But, um,

599
00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:50.500
I watched three seconds of it cause I can't stand looking at myself and I

600
00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:54.770
thought it looked fucking awesome and, uh, I was happy with it and I want to,

601
00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:57.420
before I get into my bitch and for the week and all that shit,

602
00:36:57.421 --> 00:37:00.390
which I really can't because I'm a really happy about my special,

603
00:37:00.750 --> 00:37:04.170
so there won't be a lot of bitching. I shouldn't have said that. Cause I,

604
00:37:04.171 --> 00:37:06.570
you know, by the end of this thing, we'll be fucking bitching about something.

605
00:37:06.571 --> 00:37:09.810
But, um, I just want to thank everybody who, uh,

606
00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:13.780
sent me emails telling me how much they liked it. Um, uh,

607
00:37:13.890 --> 00:37:16.250
that really means a lot to me. And I gotta tell you something, man. Yeah.

608
00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:19.590
I don't know about other comics, but I freak right before those things come out.

609
00:37:20.190 --> 00:37:23.220
You know what I mean? I sit there thinking like, oh my God,

610
00:37:23.221 --> 00:37:25.770
what if everybody thinks it sucks? And I'm like, no, don't do it. It's good.

611
00:37:25.771 --> 00:37:28.480
It's good. Right. You liked it, you saw it. And I know, but what are,

612
00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:30.870
what if for the people who fucking, I stopped playing that mental tennis,

613
00:37:30.871 --> 00:37:33.540
you know, I'm standing in a Blimpie or a subway,

614
00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:37.260
trying to think what kind of bread I want to get when it's really all the same

615
00:37:37.261 --> 00:37:41.070
kind of fucking bread. Like how they got that little fucking little oven.

616
00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:45.660
They're like, they're like, it's the old country, like you're in Europe. Oh Wow.

617
00:37:45.661 --> 00:37:50.040
And they're baking bread there. I say, ah, it's just such a fucking scam.

618
00:37:50.070 --> 00:37:53.400
Look at me. I'm already pitching now. Let's keep it happy. Keep it happy.

619
00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:57.090
So yeah, so basically, yeah, it was kind of freaking, you know,

620
00:37:57.810 --> 00:38:02.010
you want people to like what you do. And uh,

621
00:38:02.011 --> 00:38:05.550
if I liked who I was as a person and I was comfortable with myself,

622
00:38:05.551 --> 00:38:09.630
I would have no need to get on a stage and act like a jackass for fucking hour

623
00:38:09.631 --> 00:38:14.220
for other people's approval that I've never even met. Okay. So they go, so this,

624
00:38:14.250 --> 00:38:17.580
so anybody who was going to ask me that question like, dude,

625
00:38:17.581 --> 00:38:21.840
you'd love sweet guy right before you had like a special coming out, like,

626
00:38:21.841 --> 00:38:26.040
you know what I mean? Like totally rolling on the floor, laughing my ass off.

627
00:38:26.910 --> 00:38:31.800
Ah, yes. Yes I do. I do like totally fucking freak out.

628
00:38:33.330 --> 00:38:37.510
Um, all right. Okay. So before I get going here with the podcast,

629
00:38:37.511 --> 00:38:40.600
which is a day late and hopefully not a dollar short,

630
00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:44.650
I apologize to all my regular listeners, all 14 of you.

631
00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:46.391
Um, you know what sucks.

632
00:38:46.391 --> 00:38:48.910
I got a bunch of friend requests and I thought I was finally going to be able to

633
00:38:48.911 --> 00:38:53.500
get up past fucking 28,000 and I added everybody.

634
00:38:53.501 --> 00:38:58.150
I was 28,992 I wanted to get to 29,000.

635
00:38:59.170 --> 00:38:59.860
God dammit.

636
00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:03.760
I swear to God there's a fucking conspiracy here and you know what it is?

637
00:39:03.890 --> 00:39:06.790
It's the fucking Rothschild family and they're all over Facebook.

638
00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:10.420
And I'm telling you that's the scam. That's the new scam.

639
00:39:10.421 --> 00:39:14.980
And it's time few people to fucking wake up and realize that your social

640
00:39:14.981 --> 00:39:19.360
networking, Internet rights and freedoms are being taken away from you.

641
00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:23.830
I'm Joe Biden. You know, I don't even know who Joe Biden is.

642
00:39:23.831 --> 00:39:27.070
I've just been hearing his name in the background, kind of like,

643
00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:30.250
he's like the Jonas brothers in my cultural worlds.

644
00:39:30.310 --> 00:39:31.960
Like every time I walk by a magazine,

645
00:39:31.961 --> 00:39:36.820
it's either his face or the Jonas brothers and I don't know either one of their

646
00:39:36.821 --> 00:39:41.821
material that the Jonas brothers started started singing a speech of Joe Biden

647
00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:46.120
and you told me that that was a number one hit and teenage girls loved it.

648
00:39:46.121 --> 00:39:47.050
I'd have to agree with you.

649
00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:51.730
Those Jonas brothers really wear tight clothes, don't they?

650
00:39:52.510 --> 00:39:55.760
Is that where the hair is? So curly? Thank you. Right?

651
00:39:55.990 --> 00:40:00.220
There's one full year as little monologue joke for you. They really do.

652
00:40:00.221 --> 00:40:01.480
They just look really chunky.

653
00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:03.970
Like they're going to be fat fucks when they get older. You know what I mean?

654
00:40:03.971 --> 00:40:06.880
Which would be hilarious. Not like they're going to be obese,

655
00:40:06.881 --> 00:40:09.130
but they're going to have that fat middle aged face.

656
00:40:09.580 --> 00:40:12.550
And that's the big thing that nobody talks about when you get middle aged like

657
00:40:12.551 --> 00:40:17.020
me, is trying not to have a fat porky fig pig face.

658
00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:20.200
It's the weirdest thing. Even if you're in shape,

659
00:40:20.201 --> 00:40:24.460
you still get that fucking swollen Ed. The cheeks,

660
00:40:24.461 --> 00:40:27.790
you get the Winston Churchill face, you know

661
00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:34.510
jolly, you get the jelly rosy cheeks. You know what it is? It's the booze man.

662
00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:39.570
It's the fucking booze, which I have laid off for uh,

663
00:40:39.650 --> 00:40:40.690
about two and a half weeks,

664
00:40:40.691 --> 00:40:45.490
I've had a beer and a half at a half a beer at a,

665
00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:50.230
uh, the uninformed taping that I did with Joe de Rosa, my XM radio show.

666
00:40:50.770 --> 00:40:53.560
I had half a beer at that. And let me tell you something.

667
00:40:53.561 --> 00:40:56.800
You stopped drinking beer for two weeks and you drink, you take a sip of a beer.

668
00:40:57.040 --> 00:41:00.700
It's one of the greatest things you've ever tasted in your life. It's delicious.

669
00:41:00.701 --> 00:41:05.080
Like you ever once Shashank redemption and a Tim Robbins when he sitting on the

670
00:41:05.081 --> 00:41:07.310
roof and he gives that,

671
00:41:07.311 --> 00:41:12.311
that Conti fucking gorilla maniac guard tax advice.

672
00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:15.720
And all he wants is some suds as he talks about.

673
00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:18.580
He talks about just the way he described sitting on that roof.

674
00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:22.300
I guess it's Morgan Freeman's character describes drinking that beer that always

675
00:41:22.301 --> 00:41:24.280
makes me want to drink a fucking beer. You know,

676
00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:28.630
just drink at 12 like there was a fucking flight in my apartment that he doesn't

677
00:41:28.631 --> 00:41:32.590
realize it, but his life is ending today. You know what I mean?

678
00:41:32.890 --> 00:41:34.370
I being like that, you know,

679
00:41:34.371 --> 00:41:37.520
I know it's just a fucking insect and shit and you know,

680
00:41:37.521 --> 00:41:41.560
you kill this and then all of a sudden the bees start dropping off. But he's,

681
00:41:41.570 --> 00:41:43.250
he's fucking obnoxious.

682
00:41:44.250 --> 00:41:47.150
You don't even have a house fly in and spending your house for a couple of days.

683
00:41:47.151 --> 00:41:49.520
You know, he started, you know, it's,

684
00:41:49.521 --> 00:41:52.130
he's kind of like an athlete and the toilet twilight of his career.

685
00:41:52.131 --> 00:41:54.650
It's like Brett Farve and the jets, you know,

686
00:41:55.630 --> 00:41:58.130
it's exactly that mother fucker sitting right there. Let's try to kill,

687
00:41:58.131 --> 00:42:02.210
this is the first time I've tried to kill sly Brent on my podcast and see on the

688
00:42:02.211 --> 00:42:05.180
inside, this is the big thing in the middle. Is it on the inside or the outside?

689
00:42:05.710 --> 00:42:07.060
All right. One, two, three

690
00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:18.550
mother fucker. I got you. Bam. Right between the blinds. There you go.

691
00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:22.810
So someday when the insects take over this podcast,

692
00:42:24.010 --> 00:42:27.910
this podcast, this is what's going to take me down. Then I'll try to be like,

693
00:42:27.911 --> 00:42:32.410
no, that wasn't me. That was somebody else. I sold my act to my brother,

694
00:42:32.411 --> 00:42:36.470
just like that Guy Gallagher. I sold the podcast to him. Bill Burr,

695
00:42:36.471 --> 00:42:41.450
part two when he was doing it all. That was fucking satisfying. Alright,

696
00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:45.130
you, it'd be hilarious if somebody actually sent me a complaint.

697
00:42:45.670 --> 00:42:48.820
Could somebody send me an email complaining about the fact that I just murdered

698
00:42:48.821 --> 00:42:52.960
an insect mocking those fucking Peta maniacs.

699
00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:56.410
You know what I'm saying? And I love animals too, but I just hate groups.

700
00:42:56.770 --> 00:42:59.920
I hate groups of people because in order to get noticed,

701
00:42:59.950 --> 00:43:03.700
they just make a lot of noise and they never come up with a good chance.

702
00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:08.020
And it's just, I don't know, it's just fucking annoying to knowing.

703
00:43:08.021 --> 00:43:11.740
And they gotta do they gotta try to be shocking, you know, like, you know,

704
00:43:11.741 --> 00:43:15.520
it really sucks. And there's those commercials that they make about cigarettes.

705
00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:19.420
Have you seen that? They always do some public demonstration.

706
00:43:19.421 --> 00:43:21.490
I didn't know what the fuck the name of those commercials are,

707
00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:25.690
but this so fucking annoying that he, they just uh,

708
00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:27.730
they make me want to smoke.

709
00:43:29.020 --> 00:43:33.200
Just I wouldn't smoke, but you know what I mean, like I can't even explain it.

710
00:43:33.270 --> 00:43:34.103
And so it's like, you know,

711
00:43:35.050 --> 00:43:37.780
they make me want to do something that I don't even want to fucking do.

712
00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:42.190
All right. Whatever. You guys get the point. All right. Whatever.

713
00:43:42.191 --> 00:43:44.260
It's really just me. Just send me a text message.

714
00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:48.310
Joe Brought Nick comedian out of, uh, San Francisco via fucking, uh,

715
00:43:48.430 --> 00:43:51.910
Pittsburgh said, uh,

716
00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:54.880
we went to the UCLA Bruin game last night.

717
00:43:54.910 --> 00:43:58.060
That's another reason why I didn't do the podcast cause I got off the plane,

718
00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:02.350
I got off the plane over there man and a cheat.

719
00:44:02.351 --> 00:44:04.540
You get the Yale and I uh,

720
00:44:04.570 --> 00:44:07.480
went right over to the rose bowl and I went to the UCLA, Tennessee,

721
00:44:07.540 --> 00:44:10.360
Tennessee game. Fucking unbelievable game.

722
00:44:10.361 --> 00:44:13.780
Went into overtime and a UCLA won it.

723
00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:16.900
And I think I have a team out here. I was,

724
00:44:16.901 --> 00:44:19.930
I got so fucking into that cam tie something. If you guys,

725
00:44:19.931 --> 00:44:24.100
if you're into pro sports, take a second. Look at college football.

726
00:44:24.101 --> 00:44:27.670
I know everybody's psyched about the NFL dude. It's fucking bananas.

727
00:44:28.690 --> 00:44:29.740
It's unbelievable.

728
00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:33.150
And I just think bananas want to [inaudible] I just really hate myself sometimes

729
00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:35.590
it's spoken bananas. It's wacky.

730
00:44:38.590 --> 00:44:39.600
Said Bananas. You know,

731
00:44:39.940 --> 00:44:44.160
I just made myself sound like I go to games with one of those raccoon coats from

732
00:44:44.161 --> 00:44:49.110
the 1920s Rob Rah. Just boom by. Um, but no, it's insane. You know,

733
00:44:49.140 --> 00:44:52.740
you got like the bands going crazy. The students are going crazy.

734
00:44:53.130 --> 00:44:57.690
They got all those chants and stuff. It's the closest thing America has to like,

735
00:44:57.860 --> 00:44:59.370
you have a like watch those, those,

736
00:45:00.210 --> 00:45:04.620
some of the soccer or football as they call it over in England where people are

737
00:45:04.621 --> 00:45:08.310
just going bananas. Uh, I said bananas again. Jay's is quite,

738
00:45:08.311 --> 00:45:10.680
if I say it one more time, I'm going to have to hang up on myself.

739
00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:13.320
When the fuck did I start saying bananas?

740
00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:18.180
You know what that's on my friends and everyone around me in my life,

741
00:45:18.181 --> 00:45:20.190
but not say it. Dude, why the fuck do you say that?

742
00:45:20.191 --> 00:45:21.540
You really need to stop saying that.

743
00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:27.690
It's like some of my relatives in Boston who say, Pissa you see that game dude?

744
00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:32.460
Yeah, dude, it was Pissa you're like fucking in there. 40 still saying that.

745
00:45:32.461 --> 00:45:35.790
It's just, it makes my fucking skin crawl, but then I'm saying bananas.

746
00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:38.970
All right. But anyways, I'm in college football. I'm actually,

747
00:45:38.971 --> 00:45:40.470
I'm doing a gig coming up in Austin,

748
00:45:40.471 --> 00:45:44.760
Texas and I'm going to a Texas longhorn Missouri game. I'm going to be there.

749
00:45:44.850 --> 00:45:47.580
So if you're one of the hundred thousand fucking maniacs,

750
00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:52.020
who was there going nuts rather than bananas?

751
00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:56.520
What's a good way to say bananas is my podcast question for you.

752
00:45:56.840 --> 00:46:00.110
All right. And speaking of podcast questions, there's a segue for you.

753
00:46:02.190 --> 00:46:04.650
Um, we're going to get into the podcast questions, but first,

754
00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:09.660
a moment from our sponsor. Last week I talked about, uh, state capitals.

755
00:46:11.070 --> 00:46:12.270
Um, did you miss that episode? Well,

756
00:46:12.271 --> 00:46:15.210
maybe she listened to that half hour of babbling and, uh,

757
00:46:15.211 --> 00:46:18.410
I was Kinda asking the question is why the fuck is it always the,

758
00:46:18.411 --> 00:46:23.040
the second rate city always seems to be the capital, you know what I mean?

759
00:46:23.250 --> 00:46:27.810
Like it's never a, you know, New York, it's not in New York City.

760
00:46:27.811 --> 00:46:31.410
That's what you'd think it would be. But it's Albany. Okay. It's,

761
00:46:31.411 --> 00:46:35.310
you go to Illinois, it's not Chicago with Springfield. You go to Pennsylvania,

762
00:46:35.311 --> 00:46:38.070
it's not Philly, Pittsburgh, it's Harrisburg. It's always something like,

763
00:46:38.130 --> 00:46:40.350
what the fuck? You know? And I thought it was,

764
00:46:40.530 --> 00:46:43.020
cause people initially thought that that was the town that was going to be the

765
00:46:43.021 --> 00:46:45.170
shit. And uh,

766
00:46:45.210 --> 00:46:48.090
then it stopped being the shit and another time became the shit that they

767
00:46:48.091 --> 00:46:50.970
already made it be the capital and they were too embarrassed to say that they

768
00:46:50.971 --> 00:46:53.100
made a mistake. You know what I mean?

769
00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:56.670
It's kind of like the people like the Jonas brothers right now, you know,

770
00:46:56.880 --> 00:47:01.860
the Jonas brothers are the, uh, musical equivalent to the city of Albany.

771
00:47:02.670 --> 00:47:07.380
That's what I'm trying, that's what I'm trying to say there. Um,

772
00:47:07.381 --> 00:47:09.060
so anyways, this guy tries to claim,

773
00:47:09.061 --> 00:47:13.050
he says on the topic of why cities like Harrisburg and almond is Albany,

774
00:47:13.470 --> 00:47:16.350
are state capitols over Philly or New York City.

775
00:47:16.650 --> 00:47:20.220
The reason is because most state capitols are located geographically in the

776
00:47:20.221 --> 00:47:21.240
center of the state.

777
00:47:21.780 --> 00:47:25.860
That way local government government officials wouldn't have to travel across

778
00:47:25.861 --> 00:47:28.200
the whole state to get to the capitol.

779
00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:32.710
There are a few exceptions like Carson city and Tallahassee,

780
00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:37.740
but overall that's the general reason why shit cities are capitals.

781
00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:42.370
Is that true? Wait a minute. Boston that's not in the middle of the state

782
00:47:43.870 --> 00:47:47.950
is providence. Providence kind of is. I Dunno. Is that true?

783
00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:52.570
I actually got in an argument the guy the other day, Pete Dominick comedian,

784
00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:55.840
and he goes, cite your sources. You need three sources, just like journalism.

785
00:47:56.080 --> 00:47:59.050
And I realized that not only do I not have three sources,

786
00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:00.670
I usually don't even have one.

787
00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:04.090
I just have my gut going and it sounds like fucking bullshit.

788
00:48:04.091 --> 00:48:07.420
And then I just spin it. So I sound like I know what I'm talking about.

789
00:48:07.421 --> 00:48:10.630
So can anybody back up with that guy saying, is that the real reason for that?

790
00:48:11.950 --> 00:48:15.070
Huh? Anybody? Um, all right. That's it.

791
00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:18.040
Let's get into the questions for this week. The podcast questions.

792
00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:22.960
Question number one. Hey Bill, I have a question for your podcast. Um,

793
00:48:22.990 --> 00:48:25.480
if you are locked in, this is a great question. By the way.

794
00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:28.660
This is one of the greatest questions I've, I've ever gotten. Okay.

795
00:48:28.780 --> 00:48:33.310
This guy is setting the fucking bar for podcast questions.

796
00:48:33.730 --> 00:48:36.670
All right, here's the questions. Here's the question. Sorry.

797
00:48:37.450 --> 00:48:42.450
If you were locked in a gymnasium full of hundreds of unarmed six-year-olds of

798
00:48:44.201 --> 00:48:48.700
various weights, heights, races, and temperaments,

799
00:48:49.330 --> 00:48:51.970
and all you had were the clothes on your back,

800
00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:56.920
how many of them do you think you could kill before they overpowered you?

801
00:48:58.060 --> 00:49:00.640
What a fucking great question. All right,

802
00:49:00.641 --> 00:49:04.570
so obviously I'm setting all morals aside here.

803
00:49:05.830 --> 00:49:10.830
If you set aside all morals and all feelings of guilt and,

804
00:49:11.370 --> 00:49:15.370
uh, well, maybe I just felt like I was right, like these were evil kids.

805
00:49:16.180 --> 00:49:19.780
I'm trying to think of a reason why a gymnasium full of six-year-olds of various

806
00:49:19.781 --> 00:49:21.880
weights, Tyson races and temperaments,

807
00:49:23.140 --> 00:49:28.090
how many do I think I could fucking kill before they overpowered me? Uh,

808
00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:31.540
let's see here. The average a six year old has gotta be about,

809
00:49:31.690 --> 00:49:33.430
are they four feet men at four feet tall?

810
00:49:35.020 --> 00:49:38.340
Like fucking Tim Duncan was probably four feet tall when he was six there.

811
00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:40.690
Any future NBA players in this? If they're not,

812
00:49:40.740 --> 00:49:43.480
if it just going to be like accountants and fucking, you know,

813
00:49:43.481 --> 00:49:45.460
occasional wifebeater, that'd be the tough one.

814
00:49:45.850 --> 00:49:49.360
I think you know what I'd have to do, do they know I'm going to overpower me?

815
00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:53.830
I'm just going to have to assume like if they know that I'm coming in there as

816
00:49:53.831 --> 00:49:58.720
the killer of six year olds, so they all banded together to try to slay me.

817
00:49:59.650 --> 00:50:01.600
I mean I think the first thing I'd have to do,

818
00:50:02.380 --> 00:50:07.380
not just not to hack off of ESPN analysts here and use one of their expressions,

819
00:50:07.631 --> 00:50:08.650
but I'm going to have to here.

820
00:50:08.860 --> 00:50:13.040
I think the first thing I'd have to do is I'd have to set the tone and a,

821
00:50:13.060 --> 00:50:14.080
by setting the tone,

822
00:50:14.081 --> 00:50:19.081
I mean I just have to do something so fucked up to the first wave of Braveheart,

823
00:50:20.110 --> 00:50:24.210
six-year-olds coming at me that I would have that gift, those steps. Second way,

824
00:50:24.211 --> 00:50:28.280
that split second of thinking about what the fuck they were doing. Right.

825
00:50:28.970 --> 00:50:32.600
And, uh, I'm talking about leg sweeps,

826
00:50:33.170 --> 00:50:38.160
the kind that would, that would blow out in adult ACL. Okay. Which I'm talking,

827
00:50:38.210 --> 00:50:42.410
yeah, I'm wearing timberlands and uh, I'm gonna fucking,

828
00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:45.880
I get one of them with one of those, you know, you remember that move.

829
00:50:45.890 --> 00:50:46.850
What's his face used to do?

830
00:50:46.851 --> 00:50:50.120
Andre the giant when they throw a dude off the ropes and he just stick his foot

831
00:50:50.121 --> 00:50:50.954
up.

832
00:50:54.890 --> 00:50:57.800
I don't know, man. I don't know how, fuck, I don't know how many I could get,

833
00:50:57.890 --> 00:50:58.970
how many I could kill.

834
00:50:59.030 --> 00:51:03.710
I'd have to fuck him up first and leave 'em dazed and then I'd have to go back

835
00:51:03.711 --> 00:51:07.820
to finishing them off. But, uh, if I just had to use my fist man, you know,

836
00:51:08.030 --> 00:51:11.960
even though there's six year old that's still a skull, it's going to hurt. Wow.

837
00:51:11.990 --> 00:51:13.730
I'm getting really creepy with this. Aren't okay.

838
00:51:13.731 --> 00:51:16.130
I would say I could probably fuck up.

839
00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:22.580
I could kill about 11 I could kill 11. But you know, I, you know what,

840
00:51:22.581 --> 00:51:26.450
you know, I think that I could kill the number that low is because Emma,

841
00:51:26.451 --> 00:51:30.050
one time on the discovery channel, I saw this wasp entered this,

842
00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:32.090
this beehive of these honeybees,

843
00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:37.220
and like the wasps or whatever the fuck it was can destroy the honeybees.

844
00:51:37.220 --> 00:51:40.190
They can kill like a hundred to one. They can destroy these fuckers.

845
00:51:40.490 --> 00:51:44.870
So what happened was he went in there, he was doing surveillance for his,

846
00:51:44.871 --> 00:51:46.490
his wasp or his horn and nest.

847
00:51:46.491 --> 00:51:49.430
And then now he's going to go back and get his boys and they were all gonna come

848
00:51:49.431 --> 00:51:51.920
back or he's sending on a signal for them to come.

849
00:51:52.430 --> 00:51:55.940
So what he didn't realize was the honeybees som and they started like whittling

850
00:51:55.941 --> 00:51:58.100
their asses as a signal. And what happened was,

851
00:51:58.101 --> 00:52:00.830
is that the exact fucking moment,

852
00:52:01.340 --> 00:52:05.390
all the honeybees jumped on the fucking wasp or the horn at the same time.

853
00:52:05.391 --> 00:52:08.570
And they want tops of them and they started like basically dry humping them.

854
00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:11.150
But what they really would do when they will vibrating,

855
00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:17.080
and I guess a Hornet can only survive in temperatures up to 116 degrees,

856
00:52:18.950 --> 00:52:23.750
where a honeybee can go up to 118 degrees. So these mother fuckers,

857
00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:29.060
they vibrated to the point where the temperature was 118 degrees,

858
00:52:29.061 --> 00:52:33.380
one degree fucking more away, 117 degrees,

859
00:52:33.590 --> 00:52:37.040
one degree more than the Horner could, could fucking survive.

860
00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:40.780
And one degree less than what would fucking kill them. It was,

861
00:52:40.790 --> 00:52:42.580
it was one of the greatest attacks. MERCI. Emulate.

862
00:52:42.620 --> 00:52:45.160
And they basically cook the fucker. And that was the end of him.

863
00:52:45.690 --> 00:52:50.660
So get those six year olds knew I was coming and they all jumped on me and

864
00:52:50.661 --> 00:52:54.920
started fucking vibrating being a redhead. I mean once they got over 80 degrees,

865
00:52:54.921 --> 00:52:58.670
I would be fucked. I'd be passed out. And that would be the end of it all.

866
00:52:58.671 --> 00:53:02.930
They'd have to do is drag my unconscious carcass out into the sun and then that

867
00:53:02.931 --> 00:53:07.130
would be it. That would be at deaths by third degree. Sunburns.

868
00:53:08.380 --> 00:53:11.050
All right, Jesus. I'm like got a Brett from answering that one. Okay.

869
00:53:11.390 --> 00:53:14.390
When am I getting onto overrated? Underrated. Then I've got to get on with my,

870
00:53:14.810 --> 00:53:17.420
uh, with my day here as to you. Who's kidding? Who,

871
00:53:17.450 --> 00:53:20.360
why am I acting like I'm the only busy one? All right.

872
00:53:20.390 --> 00:53:22.700
For those of you new to my podcast, last couple of weeks,

873
00:53:22.701 --> 00:53:27.660
people have been sending me in a their list of stuff that they think is

874
00:53:27.661 --> 00:53:32.610
overrated and underrated. I'll say as a new UCLA Bruin Fan,

875
00:53:32.611 --> 00:53:36.510
you know what I find fucking overrated. The fucking Tennessee volunteers.

876
00:53:36.570 --> 00:53:41.520
What do you think about that? Ranked 18th against UCLA where they ranked 44th,

877
00:53:42.430 --> 00:53:45.180
the third string quarterback. What a checklist. Height game.

878
00:53:45.181 --> 00:53:47.880
The guy two for pickups, one for a touchdown the first half,

879
00:53:48.450 --> 00:53:53.070
and then he came out in the second half. Like fucking Joe Montana, Kurt Warner,

880
00:53:53.730 --> 00:53:56.970
and maybe even Fran Tarkington. Um, all right.

881
00:53:57.600 --> 00:54:02.100
You know what actually is overrated is underrated, is a man's ability to shower,

882
00:54:02.101 --> 00:54:05.550
shave, and be ready and in the fucking car within 15 minutes.

883
00:54:06.740 --> 00:54:09.060
I experienced that this weekend when Finney brand,

884
00:54:09.061 --> 00:54:12.480
the beloved owner of the Stress Factory in New Jersey took me out on his boat.

885
00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:15.000
Okay. And we came back,

886
00:54:15.001 --> 00:54:17.820
the show was in an hour and there was some sort of boat house and he's like,

887
00:54:17.821 --> 00:54:21.650
he talks like fucking, you know, a muppet. He's like, oh, I gotta go on there.

888
00:54:21.660 --> 00:54:24.900
I go, no, I got to take a shower. Just sign on a second.

889
00:54:25.030 --> 00:54:28.770
He leaves me in the car with his awful fucking Bruce Springsteen CD cause

890
00:54:28.771 --> 00:54:33.450
everybody in New Jersey loves Bruce Springsteen. So, uh,

891
00:54:33.451 --> 00:54:35.340
he goes in and I'm thinking it's going to be, fuck,

892
00:54:35.341 --> 00:54:39.030
he's going to be in it for 25 fucking minutes. This dude in and out came out,

893
00:54:39.180 --> 00:54:43.410
you know, he looked great, smelled of man soap and he was fucking ready to go.

894
00:54:43.411 --> 00:54:46.380
He actually make, made me feel unclean within 10 minutes.

895
00:54:46.950 --> 00:54:51.510
It's an incredible thing. So that's my overrated, underrated for the week. Okay,

896
00:54:51.511 --> 00:54:55.290
here's everybody else's. Alright. Overrated. Stella Beer.

897
00:54:55.680 --> 00:55:00.270
It tastes just like Budweiser and every non tasting having schlepped insists

898
00:55:00.271 --> 00:55:03.750
it's a quality beer. I guess nobody's heard of Lam.

899
00:55:04.090 --> 00:55:08.550
Lango needas or Doug fish head. You know what?

900
00:55:08.551 --> 00:55:13.110
I've never heard of those either and I can't pass judgment on those,

901
00:55:13.111 --> 00:55:17.100
but those sounds like those kinds of beers that I see when I go to Colorado and

902
00:55:17.101 --> 00:55:21.660
there's those, those rafting, hippy, I'm into Dave Matthews,

903
00:55:21.661 --> 00:55:24.750
Bergen stock, hacky sack fuckers drinking, that kind of shit.

904
00:55:25.620 --> 00:55:27.030
You know when you go down there and they have those,

905
00:55:27.031 --> 00:55:30.480
those fucking microbrews I think microbrews overrated,

906
00:55:31.410 --> 00:55:34.470
but the best one I did, I went to, it was the one I told you down on Nantucket.

907
00:55:35.340 --> 00:55:38.280
Cisco Breweries, man, God damn. And I'm still waiting for my vodka by the way.

908
00:55:38.700 --> 00:55:42.360
You sons of bitches. I understand your mom and pop, but what the fuck?

909
00:55:43.050 --> 00:55:46.560
I got three bottles of AAA coming my way and I've since quit drinking.

910
00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:48.840
Maybe they listened to the podcast. All right,

911
00:55:48.870 --> 00:55:53.640
overrated hyped up bachelor parties. Oh, isn't that the truth?

912
00:55:53.670 --> 00:55:56.130
You always think it's going to be like a fucking movie. This guy says,

913
00:55:56.370 --> 00:55:59.970
if you have to wear a tee shirt that says something like stick a fork in them,

914
00:56:00.420 --> 00:56:03.420
it's almost guaranteed that it's going to be a queer fest.

915
00:56:05.970 --> 00:56:09.270
Especially. There's definitely going to be at least one dip. Shit.

916
00:56:09.540 --> 00:56:11.760
That is way too into taking pictures.

917
00:56:12.390 --> 00:56:15.380
I know how gay is that guys can't take pictures. That's fucking gay.

918
00:56:15.550 --> 00:56:20.550
One day some gay about me, I'm actually in the flowers to a like, it's so gay.

919
00:56:20.730 --> 00:56:25.150
It goes beyond gay and comes back into a heterosexual,

920
00:56:26.230 --> 00:56:30.880
I think. No it doesn't. Maybe it comes to a sort of gay,

921
00:56:30.881 --> 00:56:34.120
heterosexual, I dunno. I like flowers. I realized that about myself.

922
00:56:34.150 --> 00:56:37.210
I bought a couple of basses and every week I'd come off the road.

923
00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:39.370
I was actually arranging them today,

924
00:56:39.580 --> 00:56:43.360
like measuring the stems and looking at the colors to try set them up.

925
00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:46.480
I've got like these days, right? I got one.

926
00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:48.760
His yellow ones like this sort of like a,

927
00:56:48.761 --> 00:56:51.850
you ever see a fender strat when they got that sunburst finish?

928
00:56:51.851 --> 00:56:54.550
That's what it looks like. Then I got like these three lavender.

929
00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:57.550
Once I put the lavender ones in the back, they'd like the backup singers.

930
00:56:57.760 --> 00:56:58.720
You know what I mean? You know like those,

931
00:56:58.721 --> 00:57:01.960
those big black chicks they always have behind the skinny white girl who can't

932
00:57:01.961 --> 00:57:06.490
fucking sing. You know? That's how I arrange them.

933
00:57:06.670 --> 00:57:09.940
I put the pair ones up front. That's like Paul Simon. That's what it is.

934
00:57:09.941 --> 00:57:12.130
It's like Paul Simon on the rhythm of the saints tour.

935
00:57:12.460 --> 00:57:15.160
That's how I arrange them. And A, I don't know. I look at them,

936
00:57:15.260 --> 00:57:18.250
they make me feel good and you know,

937
00:57:18.270 --> 00:57:22.690
I'm comfortable enough with myself to be able to admit that. All right.

938
00:57:23.050 --> 00:57:26.920
Another overrated thing. Somebody said Notre Dame and he said,

939
00:57:26.921 --> 00:57:29.260
I can go on forever forever about this one,

940
00:57:29.530 --> 00:57:34.530
but the amount of ass that a blue chip or gives up not playing in places like

941
00:57:34.961 --> 00:57:39.090
South Beach, Miami or southern California because he just had to wear,

942
00:57:39.320 --> 00:57:44.200
because he just had to wear the gold helmet sickens me. Oh, isn't that true?

943
00:57:44.740 --> 00:57:47.240
That's the true, yeah, but if you play for the University of Miami, man,

944
00:57:47.380 --> 00:57:50.770
that's a fucking dangerous place. That's a God damn dangerous place, man.

945
00:57:50.771 --> 00:57:53.800
You guys have fatalities on the regular, on your team?

946
00:57:53.910 --> 00:57:56.920
And I just say on the regular, what did I rent fucking Friday last night?

947
00:57:57.490 --> 00:58:02.350
How do I start off saying bananas and then I go with on the, on the regular, um,

948
00:58:02.830 --> 00:58:05.050
you know, stuff that I always wanted to go to university of Miami game,

949
00:58:05.051 --> 00:58:07.000
but I wanted to go when they played in the orange bowl.

950
00:58:07.030 --> 00:58:10.780
Now they playing the Joe Robbie, it just doesn't seem right.

951
00:58:10.810 --> 00:58:15.130
You know what I mean? Um, okay. Another thing,

952
00:58:15.131 --> 00:58:19.660
overrated Asian Pussy. I'm not sure what I was expecting,

953
00:58:19.661 --> 00:58:23.110
but I'll be honest. I was expecting more. Uh,

954
00:58:23.140 --> 00:58:26.620
well did you ever think that maybe the Asian you hooked up with wasn't good in

955
00:58:26.621 --> 00:58:30.990
bed? I mean, you're going to judge an entire continent. You know,

956
00:58:31.020 --> 00:58:35.590
it's funny is when people say Asian immediately, myself included,

957
00:58:35.680 --> 00:58:39.760
it doesn't everybody think, you know, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese,

958
00:58:39.790 --> 00:58:43.480
anybody, you know, with the, uh, quote unquote, uh, Asian eyes,

959
00:58:44.030 --> 00:58:48.550
whatever the politically correct way of saying what the fucking Spanish

960
00:58:48.551 --> 00:58:52.210
basketball team was trying to do. But that also could be mean.

961
00:58:52.211 --> 00:58:56.380
You looked up from somebody from India and they, they stunk in bed.

962
00:58:56.410 --> 00:59:00.370
You know what I mean? I think you should, uh, listen, there's fucking hotties

963
00:59:02.240 --> 00:59:04.630
let you know what this, this deserves a follow up question.

964
00:59:04.631 --> 00:59:09.040
How many Asians did you hook up with before you decided to do an entire

965
00:59:09.041 --> 00:59:12.460
continent of pussy? I mean, that, that's pretty amazing.

966
00:59:12.670 --> 00:59:15.640
That's one of the biggest continents out there. If not the biggest is it?

967
00:59:16.280 --> 00:59:18.490
I had no fucking, it was Africa. Bigger Africa is bigger,

968
00:59:18.550 --> 00:59:22.160
but I gotta tell you something. Asia's on the rise too. So, you know,

969
00:59:23.050 --> 00:59:25.970
be watch what you say. Okay. You saw what China did in the Olympics.

970
00:59:26.680 --> 00:59:30.200
They can do that on the rings. Just think what they can do in the a fucking,

971
00:59:30.201 --> 00:59:33.260
I dunno. Computer industry. All right, let's get to, uh,

972
00:59:34.010 --> 00:59:35.690
let's get the underrated, underrated.

973
00:59:35.750 --> 00:59:39.410
This guy says that early nineties gangster rap videos,

974
00:59:39.740 --> 00:59:42.290
hands down the greatest videos ever made.

975
00:59:42.530 --> 00:59:46.430
Just a bunch of black dudes hanging out in Compton with their baseball caps.

976
00:59:46.431 --> 00:59:50.120
Blurt out. I miss those days. Uh, I gotta agree with you, man.

977
00:59:50.121 --> 00:59:51.210
Those were fucking great days.

978
00:59:51.400 --> 00:59:53.720
Remember that time they was at really pretty girl at the party and they all

979
00:59:54.080 --> 00:59:57.980
shake up their forties and they'd dump it on her head because she, you know,

980
00:59:58.730 --> 01:00:01.520
she thought she was the shit. You know what the reality is,

981
01:00:01.790 --> 01:00:06.790
is they were looking at her thinking that she thought that she was the shit for

982
01:00:07.221 --> 01:00:10.220
all, you know, she was fucking, she was probably insecure.

983
01:00:10.460 --> 01:00:13.040
Like a lot of beautiful women are, you know, he's got some sorta hang up.

984
01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:15.370
Oh my God, I hate my ankles. You know some,

985
01:00:15.371 --> 01:00:17.960
she was probably thinking that cause she wasn't wearing jeans.

986
01:00:18.130 --> 01:00:20.960
She's wearing that little Horry outfit. So she's actually getting her head,

987
01:00:21.260 --> 01:00:23.390
which caused her to have a shutdown look on her face.

988
01:00:23.391 --> 01:00:24.770
So then snoop it or whoever,

989
01:00:24.830 --> 01:00:29.640
Dre or Warren g or whoever the fuck it was out there and Kelly, they all,

990
01:00:29.850 --> 01:00:32.060
oh look at this bitch sheet. She's all fucking stuck up.

991
01:00:32.900 --> 01:00:35.720
And then they shook up their forties and they dumped it over fucking head.

992
01:00:35.870 --> 01:00:40.280
And she probably ran home crying thinking that they did it because they didn't

993
01:00:40.281 --> 01:00:44.000
like our ankles. And you know what, that probably led to her being a stripper.

994
01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:48.350
That's how it happens. All right. Uh, underrated. Ricky Gervais'.

995
01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:53.390
Sky's made two great TV shows in less than five years,

996
01:00:54.170 --> 01:00:55.670
less than five years of each other.

997
01:00:55.671 --> 01:00:57.830
And he still doesn't get the Kudos he deserves.

998
01:00:57.860 --> 01:01:01.100
Maybe it's because there's no laugh track. Who knows? I gotta say something.

999
01:01:01.101 --> 01:01:02.690
Ricky Gervais' is a fucking genius.

1000
01:01:02.690 --> 01:01:05.870
And if you never saw the original version of the office,

1001
01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:10.220
no offense to the American version, it's unbelievable. He, that guy,

1002
01:01:10.970 --> 01:01:14.120
that guy is a genius. That one, I can't remember what the episode was about,

1003
01:01:14.121 --> 01:01:19.121
but that one where he plays the guitar in the middle of the meeting is the most

1004
01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:23.660
uncomfortable, hilarious fucking thing I've ever seen. And that guy,

1005
01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:28.900
I like how he has a drinking problem and how being an alcoholic is still funny

1006
01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:33.170
in England. You can make fun of people having drinking problems over here.

1007
01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:38.060
It's other, we got to have an intervention. Well, you doing this to yourself.

1008
01:01:39.650 --> 01:01:43.350
I'm all right. We're winding down here. Ah, the movie base, Get Ball,

1009
01:01:44.390 --> 01:01:48.950
David Zucker and the South Park guys together. A very underappreciated movie.

1010
01:01:48.951 --> 01:01:51.770
You know what, I gotta rent that because when I looked at the trailer, I'm like,

1011
01:01:51.771 --> 01:01:53.000
that looks fucking stupid.

1012
01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:57.350
And then a comedian that I respected sought and told me it was hilarious and it

1013
01:01:57.351 --> 01:02:01.580
was a good movie. And uh, I'm going to rent that. I'm gonna rent that fucker.

1014
01:02:02.210 --> 01:02:03.620
Uh, speaking of which,

1015
01:02:03.621 --> 01:02:08.420
I finally saw Miller's crossing and the end and I got to admit, uh,

1016
01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:12.830
John Turturro is fucking unreal and that movie, God damn it.

1017
01:02:12.831 --> 01:02:15.950
That was a good fucking movie. Um, all right, last thing.

1018
01:02:15.951 --> 01:02:20.130
Last thing for this week's underrated list is rage against the machine.

1019
01:02:21.090 --> 01:02:25.320
This guy says, in my opinion, the best band in the past 20 years. Wow.

1020
01:02:25.470 --> 01:02:28.140
And for all the shit that's going on in the world now,

1021
01:02:28.470 --> 01:02:30.210
their music was way before its time.

1022
01:02:30.570 --> 01:02:32.910
That original album is genius from start to finish.

1023
01:02:32.911 --> 01:02:36.960
My only complaint was when I saw them at Randall's island last year.

1024
01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:42.500
It was rage against the machine brought to you by rockstar energy drink.

1025
01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:47.040
That upset me as well. It should as well it should, but you know something.

1026
01:02:47.041 --> 01:02:49.710
That's what happens after a while. After a while,

1027
01:02:49.711 --> 01:02:51.810
you get into middle age and you're like, you know what?

1028
01:02:51.811 --> 01:02:55.920
At some point I'd like to sleep on a bed. I'd like to have a fucking couch.

1029
01:02:56.220 --> 01:02:59.520
And you know what, I drink rockstar energy drink. It tastes good to me.

1030
01:02:59.700 --> 01:03:03.900
So if they want to fucking finance the Goddamn for what do I care?

1031
01:03:04.350 --> 01:03:09.000
I mean do they have eight year olds putting rock star drink into fucking coke

1032
01:03:09.001 --> 01:03:13.470
cans over in Thailand? Cause if that's the case, I want support it. Okay.

1033
01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:15.540
But if it's somebody used to build fucking,

1034
01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:18.330
I don't know where the fuck I'm going with this. Anyways,

1035
01:03:18.331 --> 01:03:22.230
I want to thank everybody for listening to my podcast and like I said,

1036
01:03:22.231 --> 01:03:23.041
if you're new to my page,

1037
01:03:23.041 --> 01:03:26.730
which I keep saying because I w I'm hoping I have some new people with the new

1038
01:03:26.731 --> 01:03:29.850
special out. Um, I do one of these every week to give you a laugh.

1039
01:03:29.851 --> 01:03:33.390
At the beginning of the week I answer questions people send in their underrated

1040
01:03:33.391 --> 01:03:35.730
overrated lists.

1041
01:03:35.820 --> 01:03:39.720
I'm trying to get an a new list going because I'm starting to think that that

1042
01:03:39.721 --> 01:03:44.100
one is a and it'd be got, I think we've pretty much handled it at this point.

1043
01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:47.790
Um, keep sending those in. But if anybody wants to start a new list,

1044
01:03:48.210 --> 01:03:50.100
please by all means, because, uh,

1045
01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:53.160
I do not have creative control over the podcast.

1046
01:03:53.161 --> 01:03:54.720
If you want to switch the direction of it,

1047
01:03:54.721 --> 01:03:57.210
just send me a funny fucking email that spins me off.

1048
01:03:57.750 --> 01:03:59.130
I'll babble about something else.

1049
01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:02.430
Maybe somebody else will add to it and that's how it happens. Huh?

1050
01:04:02.670 --> 01:04:07.350
Isn't that interesting? All right, so this week coming up, I'm going to be a,

1051
01:04:07.351 --> 01:04:12.351
I'm actually doing a college gig at a with Charlie Murphy and a Umass Amherst in

1052
01:04:13.201 --> 01:04:14.790
Boston. Now it's a private show.

1053
01:04:14.791 --> 01:04:19.260
So that's only for students unless you somehow wink, wink,

1054
01:04:19.261 --> 01:04:21.960
figure out a way to sneak in, which you didn't hear here,

1055
01:04:21.990 --> 01:04:23.940
which of course you did because now it's the podcast.

1056
01:04:23.941 --> 01:04:25.320
I don't advocate doing that.

1057
01:04:25.590 --> 01:04:29.430
I don't advocate putting on a baseball hat and looking like you're of college

1058
01:04:29.431 --> 01:04:33.180
age and trying to just sort of walk a walk in with the rest of the students.

1059
01:04:33.181 --> 01:04:37.980
I do not advocate doing that. Okay. Don't do that.

1060
01:04:38.790 --> 01:04:42.780
That would really make me upset. All right there. I'm in the clear now. Um,

1061
01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:48.480
and the following week, September 11th through the 11, 12, I think the 13th,

1062
01:04:48.481 --> 01:04:52.590
I'm going to be at the punchline in San Francisco and the weekend after that,

1063
01:04:53.460 --> 01:04:55.230
uh, what's 11 and seven 11 and 17,

1064
01:04:55.260 --> 01:05:00.260
18 1920 and 21 I will be at the funny bone in,

1065
01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:02.910
uh, Richmond, Virginia.

1066
01:05:03.630 --> 01:05:08.630
I'll be vigil visiting my buddy sludge out there on the radio and uh,

1067
01:05:08.671 --> 01:05:10.440
I'll be performing right down there at the mall,

1068
01:05:10.441 --> 01:05:13.690
right across some Dick Sporting goods. Hi. You like that,

1069
01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:18.340
right back down to earth. One hour special. I'm on top of the world.

1070
01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:22.900
Two weeks later I'm performing across some addicts in Richmond,

1071
01:05:22.901 --> 01:05:27.550
Virginia as a fucking reality slap for you. Um, and that is it.

1072
01:05:27.551 --> 01:05:31.000
And the new DVD. We'll be out of this special on September 16th.

1073
01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:35.110
And I will be selling that fucker at all my shows and all the autographing

1074
01:05:35.380 --> 01:05:36.250
autographing it.

1075
01:05:36.251 --> 01:05:39.850
And if you buy it and he just want to come to one of my shows and bring it up to

1076
01:05:39.851 --> 01:05:41.800
me and you want me to sign it, I'll sign the fucker.

1077
01:05:42.190 --> 01:05:44.890
Cause I appreciate you buying him. And that is it.

1078
01:05:44.891 --> 01:05:48.610
And for those of you who want to know what the extras are on it really quick,

1079
01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:51.790
uh, I have the Philadelphia rant is one of the extras,

1080
01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:56.380
the classic cell phone footage from the show in Camden,

1081
01:05:57.730 --> 01:06:00.750
New Jersey where I got booed in front of all those people.

1082
01:06:00.780 --> 01:06:03.040
Everybody knows what it is. So that I've got that on there.

1083
01:06:03.340 --> 01:06:05.200
I got the uninformed one where I had the,

1084
01:06:05.510 --> 01:06:09.340
on my radio show where me and Joe got in a huge argument and then we ended up,

1085
01:06:09.341 --> 01:06:12.730
we tried to settle it with a drum battle. And, uh,

1086
01:06:12.731 --> 01:06:15.670
then I got some other footage of me just going around to the New York clubs,

1087
01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.940
talking about different horrific sets that I've had over the years,

1088
01:06:18.941 --> 01:06:22.630
just telling the stories. So ton of extras and all that bullshit.

1089
01:06:22.660 --> 01:06:25.150
And now I'm done babbling. Thank you so much for listening.

1090
01:06:26.010 --> 01:06:27.730
You guys all have a good weekend next week.
