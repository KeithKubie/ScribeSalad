00:00:00.584 --> 00:00:01.751
- [Voiceover] Hello
Grammarians, hello David.

00:00:01.751 --> 00:00:02.826
- [David] Hello Paige!

00:00:02.826 --> 00:00:05.212
- [Paige] So today we're
gonna talk about contractions

00:00:05.212 --> 00:00:09.379
which are another use for
our friend, the apostrophe.

00:00:10.865 --> 00:00:13.757
So David, what is a contraction?

00:00:13.757 --> 00:00:15.324
- [David] So something that apostrophes

00:00:15.324 --> 00:00:16.961
are really good at doing is showing when

00:00:16.961 --> 00:00:19.276
letters are missing from a word.

00:00:19.276 --> 00:00:21.824
Right, so let's say we have something

00:00:21.824 --> 00:00:24.657
like the two word phrase "I will".

00:00:27.088 --> 00:00:30.042
So in linguistics, I'm
told there's this idea

00:00:30.042 --> 00:00:30.875
called the principle of least effort,

00:00:30.875 --> 00:00:33.980
but I'm not a linguist, Paige, you are.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.590
What is the principle of least effort?

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.904
- [Paige] So that's kind
of a fancy way of saying

00:00:38.904 --> 00:00:41.340
people like to be lazy.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.173
- [David] Sure.

00:00:42.173 --> 00:00:44.785
- [Paige] Which is, you
know, tends to be accurate

00:00:44.785 --> 00:00:48.458
across language, so you know,
we can say something like

00:00:48.458 --> 00:00:51.820
"I will", but honestly that kind of takes

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.218
a lot of effort to say, right?

00:00:54.218 --> 00:00:55.205
- [David] I have to articulate the mouth

00:00:55.205 --> 00:00:57.030
in this particular way.

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.939
It's just easier to just
collapse all of that

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:05.139
into one, you know,
one syllable, one sound

00:01:05.139 --> 00:01:06.306
to say "I'll".

00:01:07.344 --> 00:01:10.086
And when we do that, we use an apostrophe

00:01:10.086 --> 00:01:12.751
to indicate the missing letters.

00:01:12.751 --> 00:01:15.257
That missing "w" sound.

00:01:15.257 --> 00:01:16.778
That's a contraction.

00:01:16.778 --> 00:01:19.440
So most model verbs,
right, if you remember

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.552
model auxiliaries from the verb section.

00:01:22.552 --> 00:01:25.052
We use those a lot in English.

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:28.915
And so it's really easy to combine those

00:01:28.915 --> 00:01:32.832
with most words or pronouns
into a contraction.

00:01:33.748 --> 00:01:37.695
So you could take the phrase "she would",

00:01:37.695 --> 00:01:40.791
which is a lot of letters to say.

00:01:40.791 --> 00:01:42.622
Takes a lot of letters to write.

00:01:42.622 --> 00:01:44.004
And we can turn that into, with the help

00:01:44.004 --> 00:01:45.497
of our friend the apostrophe,

00:01:45.497 --> 00:01:48.542
the word "she'd" means the same thing.

00:01:48.542 --> 00:01:49.425
- [Paige] Yeah, that's pretty amazing.

00:01:49.425 --> 00:01:54.043
I mean this tiny apostrophe
stands in the place

00:01:54.043 --> 00:01:56.458
of all of these letters.

00:01:56.458 --> 00:01:57.736
- [David] Yeah it's doing a lot of work.

00:01:57.736 --> 00:02:00.048
Have I got a deal for your, Paige.

00:02:00.048 --> 00:02:02.780
How would you like three
letters for the price of four?

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.444
'Cause you can shorten, you know,

00:02:05.444 --> 00:02:08.330
something like "he is" to "he's".

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:09.624
- [Paige] Right.

00:02:09.624 --> 00:02:11.372
Yeah, I mean, that's what the principle

00:02:11.372 --> 00:02:13.503
we were talking about is all about.

00:02:13.503 --> 00:02:16.022
Like "he is" isn't that hard to say,

00:02:16.022 --> 00:02:17.663
but "he's" is a lot easier.

00:02:17.663 --> 00:02:20.558
- [David] So this is
pretty straightforward,

00:02:20.558 --> 00:02:23.992
but there are some kind of
strange uses of contractions.

00:02:23.992 --> 00:02:26.252
Some strange uses of the apostrophe

00:02:26.252 --> 00:02:30.178
that don't seem as immediately
evident on their face.

00:02:30.178 --> 00:02:33.758
So for example if you
contract the phrase "will not"

00:02:33.758 --> 00:02:38.734
into a single contraction, it
doesn't turn into "willn't",

00:02:38.734 --> 00:02:40.567
it turns into "won't".

00:02:42.413 --> 00:02:44.685
- [Paige] So in this case the
apostrophe stands in the place

00:02:44.685 --> 00:02:48.435
of this "o", but all
these letters disappear,

00:02:49.541 --> 00:02:53.225
and they're kind of unaccounted for.

00:02:53.225 --> 00:02:54.906
- [David] It's weird, it's
like the Bermuda Triangle

00:02:54.906 --> 00:02:56.318
of punctuation marks.

00:02:56.318 --> 00:02:59.176
They all just kind of got
sucked up into that apostrophe.

00:02:59.176 --> 00:03:00.231
- [Paige] Yeah.

00:03:00.231 --> 00:03:01.180
- [David] Never to be seen again.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.013
- [Paige] Who knows where they went.

00:03:02.013 --> 00:03:03.507
- [David] But there aren't a ton of those.

00:03:03.507 --> 00:03:06.065
There's "won't", there's "don't",

00:03:06.065 --> 00:03:08.479
but not to take away
from our original point.

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:10.620
This is what the apostrophe does

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.482
when it's working to contract.

00:03:12.482 --> 00:03:15.232
Right, it just takes letters
from the middle of the word,

00:03:15.232 --> 00:03:17.754
and it takes them away, it stands in

00:03:17.754 --> 00:03:20.188
for the fact that there
are letters missing.

00:03:20.188 --> 00:03:21.938
- [Paige] You got it.

00:03:22.836 --> 00:03:24.061
- [David] Cool.

00:03:24.061 --> 00:03:25.542
- [Paige] So "I will" goes to "I'll",

00:03:25.542 --> 00:03:27.549
"She would" becomes "she'd",

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:29.224
"He is" becomes "he's",

00:03:29.224 --> 00:03:30.203
and "will not" becomes "won't".

00:03:30.203 --> 00:03:32.496
So that's contractions.

00:03:32.496 --> 00:03:33.402
You can learn anything.

00:03:33.402 --> 00:03:34.399
- [David] David out.

00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:35.709
- [Paige] Paige out.
