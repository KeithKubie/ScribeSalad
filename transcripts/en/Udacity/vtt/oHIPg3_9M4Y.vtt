00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.800
Try rationalizing the second problem. You want to multiply by the conjugate

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.284
divided by the conjugate first and then simplify your answer. Be careful when

00:00:08.284 --> 00:00:11.822
you simplify your answer, and when you think you've got it write the final

00:00:11.822 --> 00:00:13.553
result here.
