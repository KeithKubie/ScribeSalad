What the question of role models important

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.930
in the Middle East? Absolutely. I'm particularly
concerned about the role models for women

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:18.011
and girls in the Middle East. Because it's
really important to have what I call the power

00:00:18.011 --> 00:00:24.370
of the mirror, knowing what it is you can
be by who it is you see. I'll tell you a little

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:27.640
story. When I met the president of Iceland.
She had been the president of Iceland for

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.770
16 years. But she said to me that after she
was president for about eight years, she was

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.180
going around Iceland, she was talking to the
children. One of the things she discovered

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:39.710
was the children under eight, they all thought
only a woman could be president of Iceland.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:47.710
That the boys had to ask if they could be
president of Iceland, because they had never

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.290
seen it. That's what I call the power in the
mirror. And I think particularly for the development

00:00:51.290 --> 00:01:01.250
of the economy within the Middle East or the
development of political process, the advancement

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:12.540
of the girls and women in the Middle East,
I think is essential. And progress is being

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.930
made, but we need to figure out how to hurry
history. And one of the ways I think we can

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:22.700
do that is by having more and more women as
role models. Young girls can see that they

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:23.390
can be many things when they grow up.
