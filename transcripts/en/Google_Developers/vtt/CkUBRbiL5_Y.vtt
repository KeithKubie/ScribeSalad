Bailey: Okay, our next speaker

00:00:02.033 --> 00:00:03.801
is Phil Dickerson who works

00:00:03.801 --> 00:00:07.300
for The U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency,

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.367
and he's gonna
be talking about

00:00:09.367 --> 00:00:11.300
how they have been
using Google Earth

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:17.901
to visualize real-time
air quality data.

00:00:17.901 --> 00:00:19.367
Dickerson: Thanks, John.

00:00:19.367 --> 00:00:20.868
As John said,
I'm Phil Dickerson

00:00:20.868 --> 00:00:22.434
with The Environmental
Protection Agency,

00:00:22.434 --> 00:00:24.667
office of Air Quality,
Planning, and Standards,

00:00:24.667 --> 00:00:26.300
located
in Research Triangle Park, 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.634
North Carolina.

00:00:27.634 --> 00:00:29.067
And I'm gonna be telling you
a little bit about

00:00:29.067 --> 00:00:30.901
what we're doing
with virtual globes

00:00:30.901 --> 00:00:33.767
and real-time
air quality data.

00:00:33.767 --> 00:00:35.667
So first of all,
a little bit of background

00:00:35.667 --> 00:00:37.434
about air quality.

00:00:37.434 --> 00:00:39.601
Obviously air pollution
affects everyone.

00:00:39.601 --> 00:00:41.701
Unlike some
of the other environments

00:00:41.701 --> 00:00:43.501
that EPA is concerned with,

00:00:43.501 --> 00:00:46.100
everybody has
to breathe the air.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.200
Poor air quality
can aggravate lung disease--

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.467
including asthma--

00:00:49.467 --> 00:00:51.934
heart disease--including
congestive heart failure.

00:00:51.934 --> 00:00:53.334
And those kind of effects

00:00:53.334 --> 00:00:55.701
result in
more premature deaths,

00:00:55.701 --> 00:00:57.701
more admissions
to hospitals,

00:00:57.701 --> 00:00:59.734
more trips
to the emergency room,

00:00:59.734 --> 00:01:01.901
more visits
to doctors' offices,

00:01:01.901 --> 00:01:04.067
more school and work absences

00:01:04.067 --> 00:01:06.000
for folks that are affected
by those symptoms,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.300
and more days with symptoms.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.934
So basically,
very quickly what EPA does

00:01:12.934 --> 00:01:14.934
in the realm
of air quality data.

00:01:14.934 --> 00:01:16.868
The Clean Air Act
actually requires

00:01:16.868 --> 00:01:19.767
monitoring and reporting
of air quality data.

00:01:19.767 --> 00:01:21.667
A bevy of state
and local agencies

00:01:21.667 --> 00:01:23.667
collect that data
and report it to EPA.

00:01:23.667 --> 00:01:26.200
There's not an actual
regulatory requirement

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.834
for real-time reporting,

00:01:27.834 --> 00:01:29.400
which will come into play
when I talk

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.300
about the AIRNow program.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.300
EPA manages
the Air Quality System, AQS,

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.334
which is actually
the largest database

00:01:36.334 --> 00:01:38.267
of air quality measurements
in the world.

00:01:38.267 --> 00:01:41.234
It goes back to as early
as the 1950s.

00:01:41.234 --> 00:01:43.634
That AQS data,
as I mentioned, is supplied

00:01:43.634 --> 00:01:46.267
by the state, local, tribal,
and federal agencies.

00:01:46.267 --> 00:01:48.400
And it's used
to determine compliance

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.667
with the National
Ambient Air Quality Standards.

00:01:50.667 --> 00:01:52.267
So if you've ever
heard the phrase is,

00:01:52.267 --> 00:01:53.834
"non-attainment area,"

00:01:53.834 --> 00:01:57.033
that's what we're judging
based on this AQS data.

00:01:57.033 --> 00:01:59.234
The reason I point that out

00:01:59.234 --> 00:02:01.033
is because
the AIRNow program

00:02:01.033 --> 00:02:04.267
actually provides real-time
air quality data

00:02:04.267 --> 00:02:06.067
and forecasts
for the public.

00:02:06.067 --> 00:02:08.033
So about ten years ago,

00:02:08.033 --> 00:02:10.334
EPA found that
our region one office

00:02:10.334 --> 00:02:11.767
in the northeast

00:02:11.767 --> 00:02:14.033
was gathering up
real-time air quality data

00:02:14.033 --> 00:02:15.634
three times each day

00:02:15.634 --> 00:02:17.467
and creating maps
for the public.

00:02:17.467 --> 00:02:19.634
So in 1997
we got some funding

00:02:19.634 --> 00:02:22.067
to try to expand
that effort nationwide.

00:02:22.067 --> 00:02:24.934
I bring this up in contrast
to the Air Quality System,

00:02:24.934 --> 00:02:27.534
which we use for our
regulatory purposes.

00:02:27.534 --> 00:02:30.033
This is actually reported
in real time,

00:02:30.033 --> 00:02:33.200
which again is not required
by regulation.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.033
And we have mostly a focus
upon the public.

00:02:37.033 --> 00:02:40.033
This also leverages
existing monitoring activates.

00:02:40.033 --> 00:02:42.367
The state and locals
are getting EPA grants

00:02:42.367 --> 00:02:43.901
to do this monitoring.

00:02:43.901 --> 00:02:46.000
And we're just building
upon that monitoring network

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.467
that already exists.

00:02:47.467 --> 00:02:49.968
We have a very diverse
stakeholder community.

00:02:49.968 --> 00:02:52.501
We have federal, state,
provincial, tribal,

00:02:52.501 --> 00:02:53.968
and local air agencies.

00:02:53.968 --> 00:02:56.167
And there are over
120 of those agencies

00:02:56.167 --> 00:02:58.200
that are submitting
their data voluntarily

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.701
to the AIRNow program.

00:02:59.701 --> 00:03:02.734
We also have scientific and
health research organizations

00:03:02.734 --> 00:03:04.834
that are actually using
that real-time data

00:03:04.834 --> 00:03:07.801
to study health effects
on humans.

00:03:07.801 --> 00:03:10.634
We also have a lot of media
and public outreach groups.

00:03:10.634 --> 00:03:13.033
Our data actually goes
to CNN, "USA Today,"

00:03:13.033 --> 00:03:14.234
The Weather Channel,

00:03:14.234 --> 00:03:16.234
media outlets like that.

00:03:16.234 --> 00:03:18.167
We do a lot of education
and outreach

00:03:18.167 --> 00:03:20.067
through the AIRNow program.

00:03:20.067 --> 00:03:22.634
Ozone in particular
was difficult to visualize

00:03:22.634 --> 00:03:24.667
since it's an odorless,
colorless gas,

00:03:24.667 --> 00:03:26.400
and we actually
gave the public a tool

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.801
that they could kind of see

00:03:27.801 --> 00:03:29.701
how ozone formed
in the atmosphere

00:03:29.701 --> 00:03:31.734
and watch it move about.

00:03:31.734 --> 00:03:34.334
We also have international
interests and activities.

00:03:34.334 --> 00:03:37.734
We're actually piloting
a version of the AIRNow system

00:03:37.734 --> 00:03:39.434
in Shanghai, China
right now.

00:03:39.434 --> 00:03:41.968
The Chinese saw the success
the U.S. had with AIRNow,

00:03:41.968 --> 00:03:43.901
and they wanted
to duplicate the system.

00:03:43.901 --> 00:03:46.534
So we're actually designing
an entirely new system

00:03:46.534 --> 00:03:50.133
that we'll use in Shanghai
and in the U.S. next year.

00:03:50.133 --> 00:03:52.133
This bottom flow diagram

00:03:52.133 --> 00:03:55.300
is a very brief description

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.367
of how the AIRNow system
actually works.

00:03:57.367 --> 00:04:00.467
We have those 120 plus
state and local air agencies.

00:04:00.467 --> 00:04:02.033
They submit their data

00:04:02.033 --> 00:04:03.767
to the AIRNow
data management center,

00:04:03.767 --> 00:04:05.467
which is actually
not far from here,

00:04:05.467 --> 00:04:07.100
up in Petaluma, California.

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:11.501
They submit observations
every hour 24 by 7.

00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:13.934
And they also
submit forecasts

00:04:13.934 --> 00:04:15.601
to this
data management center.

00:04:15.601 --> 00:04:17.200
We take that
and then turn around

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.701
and create
a national data set

00:04:18.701 --> 00:04:21.234
and a national set
of maps and forecasts.

00:04:21.234 --> 00:04:23.234
We then perform the function

00:04:23.234 --> 00:04:26.133
of distributing that data
and forecast to the media

00:04:26.133 --> 00:04:30.567
and also to the public
via our airnow.gov website.

00:04:30.567 --> 00:04:32.200
And we hope
that that information

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.133
gets into the hands
of decision makers in the public

00:04:34.133 --> 00:04:35.801
so that they can
avoid exposure

00:04:35.801 --> 00:04:38.167
to unhealthy levels
of air quality.

00:04:38.167 --> 00:04:40.267
On the right-hand side,
you'll see in 1997

00:04:40.267 --> 00:04:43.200
this represents
that first regional effort.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.534
EPA took that over
and the 2007 view shows

00:04:46.534 --> 00:04:48.767
that we've expanded it
to all 50 states

00:04:48.767 --> 00:04:51.167
and even the provinces
of Canada.

00:04:51.167 --> 00:04:52.834
The bottom graphic shows

00:04:52.834 --> 00:04:55.400
a special purpose map
that we drew

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.234
for the Alaska fires
a couple years ago.

00:04:57.234 --> 00:05:00.067
Anytime there's
an emergency or a special event,

00:05:00.067 --> 00:05:03.167
we'll contribute by creating
real-time data products

00:05:03.167 --> 00:05:06.367
for that particular event.

00:05:06.367 --> 00:05:08.434
Just a little bit more
about AIRNow.

00:05:08.434 --> 00:05:09.934
As you've probably
figured out by now,

00:05:09.934 --> 00:05:11.267
we do a lot of coordination

00:05:11.267 --> 00:05:13.334
between the state and local
agencies and the media.

00:05:13.334 --> 00:05:16.000
We provide centralization
for all this air quality data

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.701
that's collected at various
levels across the country.

00:05:18.701 --> 00:05:20.434
We convert
all the raw data

00:05:20.434 --> 00:05:21.934
to the Air Quality Index,

00:05:21.934 --> 00:05:24.501
which is our public tool
for recording air quality.

00:05:24.501 --> 00:05:26.601
It's a five-color system

00:05:26.601 --> 00:05:29.200
that also contains
health effects information

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.734
so that the public
can actually figure out

00:05:31.734 --> 00:05:34.100
what the air quality is
and what they can do about it.

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.033
And we do a lot of education

00:05:36.033 --> 00:05:37.801
and lots of distribution.

00:05:37.801 --> 00:05:40.367
Over on the right-hand side
you see some of the many ways

00:05:40.367 --> 00:05:42.701
we distribute
this air quality data.

00:05:42.701 --> 00:05:44.000
That first one there

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.501
is actually what I'm gonna
show in a minute,

00:05:45.501 --> 00:05:47.267
which is one of our
KML products.

00:05:47.267 --> 00:05:49.567
And then we have
contour maps of ozone,

00:05:49.567 --> 00:05:51.067
which you see right beside

00:05:51.067 --> 00:05:52.968
the Google Earth window there.

00:05:52.968 --> 00:05:55.067
We also get our data
onto CNN.

00:05:55.067 --> 00:05:57.200
We have a system
that allows you to subscribe

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.968
to get real-time
air quality alerts

00:05:58.968 --> 00:06:01.167
on your cell phone
or pager.

00:06:01.167 --> 00:06:03.801
And we also get coverage
on The Weather Channel,

00:06:03.801 --> 00:06:08.367
"USA Today" and various other
media outlets.

00:06:08.367 --> 00:06:10.367
A little bit more
about some of the products

00:06:10.367 --> 00:06:11.834
we do in the AIRNow system.

00:06:11.834 --> 00:06:14.167
As I mentioned,
we have real-time hourly data.

00:06:14.167 --> 00:06:17.267
We have forecasts coming in
for over 300 cities.

00:06:17.267 --> 00:06:20.300
We produce a national outlook,
which is kind of like

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:21.934
the weather map you
see on TV at night

00:06:21.934 --> 00:06:24.334
that predicts
where air quality problems

00:06:24.334 --> 00:06:26.434
will occur
in the next day or two.

00:06:26.434 --> 00:06:27.934
We do news stories

00:06:27.934 --> 00:06:31.367
for, um, particular
wide regional events

00:06:31.367 --> 00:06:34.000
or in special cases
like wildfires.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.167
We have webcams
so that people can visually

00:06:36.167 --> 00:06:38.667
get an idea of what
the air quality looks like.

00:06:38.667 --> 00:06:40.601
And we do yearly
air comparisons

00:06:40.601 --> 00:06:43.033
to show how this year
compares to last year

00:06:43.033 --> 00:06:46.701
or the last five years.

00:06:46.701 --> 00:06:49.067
So what we're doing
with KML--

00:06:49.067 --> 00:06:52.300
We actually have
a dynamically-created KML file

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.267
or several files
that we create.

00:06:54.267 --> 00:06:56.467
We've got the most current
Air Quality Index,

00:06:56.467 --> 00:06:59.300
and we update that every hour
as the new data comes in.

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:02.601
We have today's and tomorrow's
forecast Air Quality Index.

00:07:02.601 --> 00:07:05.067
And those are all updated
on an hourly basis

00:07:05.067 --> 00:07:07.501
based on the latest data
that comes in.

00:07:07.501 --> 00:07:09.200
The KMLs also
give more information

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:10.634
via pop-up boxes.

00:07:10.634 --> 00:07:13.100
They give you the ozone
and particulate matter

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.534
AQI concentrations
for a location

00:07:15.534 --> 00:07:17.100
and give you links
to more information

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:20.534
in case you have
other questions.

00:07:20.534 --> 00:07:22.667
Outside of my program,

00:07:22.667 --> 00:07:25.033
EPA is also doing some other
air quality applications.

00:07:25.033 --> 00:07:28.434
We have a KML file
for emissions data.

00:07:28.434 --> 00:07:30.000
It has a really neat feature

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.968
where basically
the height of the balloon

00:07:31.968 --> 00:07:33.901
shows the total emissions
for a facility,

00:07:33.901 --> 00:07:35.968
and I'll show that
in just a moment.

00:07:35.968 --> 00:07:37.501
We also allow people to see

00:07:37.501 --> 00:07:39.701
where the actual air quality
monitors are located

00:07:39.701 --> 00:07:41.133
via a KML.

00:07:41.133 --> 00:07:42.667
And that's
a very neat function

00:07:42.667 --> 00:07:45.033
because in the past
people might find

00:07:45.033 --> 00:07:46.234
the address of a monitor,

00:07:46.234 --> 00:07:47.901
they might be able
to plot it on a map,

00:07:47.901 --> 00:07:50.133
but with Google Earth
you can now actually see

00:07:50.133 --> 00:07:51.701
what's around that monitor
and detect

00:07:51.701 --> 00:07:53.534
if there are schools
or parking lots

00:07:53.534 --> 00:07:55.267
or if its near
a busy intersection,

00:07:55.267 --> 00:07:57.734
things like that.

00:07:57.734 --> 00:07:59.968
So we've come to the part
where I'm gonna try

00:07:59.968 --> 00:08:01.367
to do some
live demonstrations,

00:08:01.367 --> 00:08:04.601
which is kind of
the technology equivalent

00:08:04.601 --> 00:08:07.434
of a bungee jump,
but we'll hope it works.

00:08:07.434 --> 00:08:10.367
First the location
of air quality monitors.

00:08:10.367 --> 00:08:12.200
This takes you to
an EPA web page.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.400
And we monitor for a variety
of different pollutants,

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.434
so you can pull up
these different layers

00:08:17.434 --> 00:08:19.133
depending on the pollutant
you're interested in.

00:08:19.133 --> 00:08:21.834
I'm gonna click
on the ozone layer.

00:08:21.834 --> 00:08:23.734
Oh, that was
an interesting choice,

00:08:23.734 --> 00:08:24.968
the ozone layer.

00:08:24.968 --> 00:08:26.567
This is actually
ground-based ozone,

00:08:26.567 --> 00:08:28.167
so don't get that confused.

00:08:28.167 --> 00:08:29.767
So what we're doing here
is we're pulling up

00:08:29.767 --> 00:08:31.501
a live KML file

00:08:31.501 --> 00:08:36.167
of the actual
ozone monitoring locations.

00:08:36.167 --> 00:08:40.000
And you can zoom in on this.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.968
Having a little trouble
with my mouse.

00:08:41.968 --> 00:08:43.467
Here we go.

00:08:43.467 --> 00:08:47.767
You zoom in here.

00:08:47.767 --> 00:08:50.067
Whoops.
Okay.

00:08:50.067 --> 00:08:52.234
You can actually see
the monitoring locations.

00:08:52.234 --> 00:08:54.734
And if you click on one,

00:08:54.734 --> 00:09:00.167
you can get more information
about that particular monitor.

00:09:00.167 --> 00:09:02.801
So you'll see here this
particular monitor I chose

00:09:02.801 --> 00:09:05.968
is in Salt Lake--
near Salt Lake City in Utah.

00:09:05.968 --> 00:09:07.901
You can get a lot
of different information

00:09:07.901 --> 00:09:09.801
about the monitor itself

00:09:09.801 --> 00:09:11.801
that comes out
of our air quality system.

00:09:11.801 --> 00:09:13.467
And you can even download
some of the historical data

00:09:13.467 --> 00:09:15.834
for that particular site.

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:22.434
Um, obviously,
you can zoom in closer

00:09:22.434 --> 00:09:24.501
and see what kind of terrain
the monitor has around it

00:09:24.501 --> 00:09:29.601
and get a lot of different
visual information.

00:09:29.601 --> 00:09:34.033
So I'm gonna jump back out.

00:09:34.033 --> 00:09:37.000
Whoops.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.234
Didn't mean to do that.

00:09:38.234 --> 00:09:40.934
Okay.

00:09:40.934 --> 00:09:43.868
This next one is actually
a KML file

00:09:43.868 --> 00:09:46.467
that references
three other KML files

00:09:46.467 --> 00:09:49.834
which give you information
on current air quality

00:09:49.834 --> 00:09:52.100
and forecast.

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:04.067
So again we're loading
Google Earth here.

00:10:04.067 --> 00:10:07.000
We're grabbing three files
that are generated every hour

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.801
by the AIRNow system.

00:10:08.801 --> 00:10:10.801
One has the latest conditions

00:10:10.801 --> 00:10:13.100
at every major
metropolitan area.

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:15.701
The other has
a forecast for today

00:10:15.701 --> 00:10:17.968
and a forecast
for tomorrow.

00:10:23.067 --> 00:10:25.667
And I'm just gonna
zoom in on one here.

00:10:29.334 --> 00:10:32.834
You'll see there's one
in the Denver area.

00:10:32.834 --> 00:10:34.067
When you mouse over it,

00:10:34.067 --> 00:10:35.701
you see
the current AQI is 94,

00:10:35.701 --> 00:10:38.200
which is a yellow AQI.

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:40.868
If you click on it,
you get a pop-up box.

00:10:40.868 --> 00:10:44.100
And you'll see here
immediately the PM, 2.5,

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:45.501
AQI is 94,

00:10:45.501 --> 00:10:47.501
the ozone AQI is 32.

00:10:47.501 --> 00:10:49.300
EPA regulations require

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:51.400
that the cities report
whichever is highest.

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:54.901
So that's where
the 94 is coming from.

00:10:54.901 --> 00:10:56.400
Okay, and then over
on the side

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:57.934
you'll see
the radio buttons.

00:10:57.934 --> 00:10:59.834
You can switch
to today's forecast.

00:10:59.834 --> 00:11:02.300
There's another view,

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:05.501
and it will take it
a minute to load.

00:11:05.501 --> 00:11:08.367
You can see the forecast
for Denver for today

00:11:08.367 --> 00:11:10.434
is that it will reach a 50.

00:11:10.434 --> 00:11:12.067
And if you click
on that again,

00:11:12.067 --> 00:11:15.200
you'll see that
the, um, 50--

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:17.634
It looks like ozone and PM
are gonna be 50.

00:11:17.634 --> 00:11:19.133
Interesting.

00:11:19.133 --> 00:11:21.200
So that's
the forecast for today.

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:23.100
Similarly, if you click
on the next radio button,

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:25.400
you can get
tomorrow's forecast.

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:34.767
And you'll see it's 50
for tomorrow as well.

00:11:34.767 --> 00:11:37.300
One thing
I forgot to point out.

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:40.067
Just so you know
there's no tricks up my sleeve.

00:11:40.067 --> 00:11:41.701
If you'll notice here,

00:11:41.701 --> 00:11:47.167
this data was at
3:00 Mountain Standard Time.

00:11:47.167 --> 00:11:53.133
So it is almost
real time there.

00:11:53.133 --> 00:11:56.968
And lastly,
another group in my office

00:11:56.968 --> 00:11:59.367
does national emissions
inventory,

00:11:59.367 --> 00:12:01.834
which is a collection of all
the facility emissions data.

00:12:01.834 --> 00:12:07.734
They've also done a KML file
with that data.

00:12:07.734 --> 00:12:12.801
And on this one,

00:12:12.801 --> 00:12:14.868
when you bring this up
it'll show you the locations

00:12:14.868 --> 00:12:17.200
of actual plants
across the country.

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:21.234
That's why there's so many
of those little balloons.

00:12:21.234 --> 00:12:24.133
And if you zoom into one...

00:12:28.601 --> 00:12:31.968
you'll see the balloon
gives you more information

00:12:31.968 --> 00:12:33.601
on that facility.

00:12:33.601 --> 00:12:35.667
It also gives you a graph
of the different emissions

00:12:35.667 --> 00:12:37.400
coming out
of that facility

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:41.067
and their relative
contribution to the total.

00:12:41.067 --> 00:12:45.667
And my favorite feature
of this particular map

00:12:45.667 --> 00:12:50.467
is if you rotate
the map like so

00:12:50.467 --> 00:12:53.267
the height of the balloon
actually is the total emissions

00:12:53.267 --> 00:12:55.267
of those sources.

00:12:55.267 --> 00:12:57.234
So when you look
across the landscape,

00:12:57.234 --> 00:12:59.334
you can see the highest balloons
are the facilities

00:12:59.334 --> 00:13:01.767
that are emitting
the highest amount

00:13:01.767 --> 00:13:03.200
for that particular area.

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:06.534
So if you click
on one of those,

00:13:06.534 --> 00:13:08.634
you'll see its emissions
are fairly high

00:13:08.634 --> 00:13:14.167
compared to some
of its neighbors.

00:13:14.167 --> 00:13:18.601
Okay.

00:13:18.601 --> 00:13:20.667
And that is about all I have.

00:13:20.667 --> 00:13:22.534
I'll encourage you
to "invisit" our--

00:13:22.534 --> 00:13:24.934
to visit our website,
airnow.gov,

00:13:24.934 --> 00:13:26.801
where you can find
a lot more information

00:13:26.801 --> 00:13:28.133
on air quality,

00:13:28.133 --> 00:13:30.067
including information
about the Air Quality Index.

00:13:30.067 --> 00:13:33.667
You can get data, forecasts,
news items, publications,

00:13:33.667 --> 00:13:35.334
and a lot more.

00:13:35.334 --> 00:13:39.667
And at this point
I'll take questions.

00:13:39.667 --> 00:13:43.634
Yes?

00:13:43.634 --> 00:13:46.367
Ah.

00:13:46.367 --> 00:13:48.000
Yes, the question was,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.601
"How do we do forecasts
and how good are they?"

00:13:50.601 --> 00:13:52.267
The forecasts
are actually done, again,

00:13:52.267 --> 00:13:53.901
by the state
and local agencies.

00:13:53.901 --> 00:13:55.601
And they use a variety
of different methods.

00:13:55.601 --> 00:13:57.334
Some of them are statistical.

00:13:57.334 --> 00:13:59.200
Some of them
are numeric models.

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:00.767
And every now and then,

00:14:00.767 --> 00:14:02.634
they actually use
some human intuition,

00:14:02.634 --> 00:14:04.767
which you could also
call a guess.

00:14:04.767 --> 00:14:06.901
And, um,
so the different methods

00:14:06.901 --> 00:14:09.934
have different degrees
of accuracy.

00:14:09.934 --> 00:14:12.033
And it also depends a lot
on the weather.

00:14:12.033 --> 00:14:14.100
'Cause air quality
is very much affected

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:15.501
by the meteorology.

00:14:15.501 --> 00:14:18.267
So as far as accuracy,
kind of a rule of thumb

00:14:18.267 --> 00:14:22.133
is it's somewhere in the range
of 70% to 75% on average.

00:14:22.133 --> 00:14:24.300
But it varies a lot
depending on the area

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:25.968
and the technique.

00:14:25.968 --> 00:14:27.434
Another thing I should add

00:14:27.434 --> 00:14:29.067
is our friends at NOAH

00:14:29.067 --> 00:14:30.934
have a national
air quality forecast model

00:14:30.934 --> 00:14:32.334
for ozone right now.

00:14:32.334 --> 00:14:33.968
So if you go
to NOAH's website,

00:14:33.968 --> 00:14:35.901
you can actually see
their numerical model

00:14:35.901 --> 00:14:38.067
of the entire country
for ozone.

00:14:38.067 --> 00:14:40.367
And they're doing
an experimental domain

00:14:40.367 --> 00:14:42.067
for particulate matter.

00:14:42.067 --> 00:14:43.901
There's a lot of different
products out there

00:14:43.901 --> 00:14:48.133
that figure into
the forecast.

00:14:48.133 --> 00:14:51.767
Okay, any other questions?

00:14:51.767 --> 00:14:53.033
Thank you.

00:14:53.033 --> 00:14:54.968
[applause]
