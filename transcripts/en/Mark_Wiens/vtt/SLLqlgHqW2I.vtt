Steps are a little narrow
so be careful of your step.

00:01:25.711 --> 00:01:26.739
Smells incredible up here.

00:01:26.739 --> 00:01:29.122

is people don't have a easy life.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.340
Only point of comfort in their

lives is when they sit down to eat.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.146
So they make the most out of it.

00:03:48.146 --> 00:03:49.495
- Yeah, yeah.

00:03:49.495 --> 00:03:51.205
- Even with no money
and no nothing they put,

00:03:51.205 --> 00:03:54.170
they create genius, genius food.

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.860
Just to create this magical moments

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.920

For the crab, I'm gonna

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.052
Oh, it's so juicy and

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.810

This is one of those meals
that you wanna throw down.

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.570
You would just like
focus on the food and you

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:26.270

00:05:32.859 --> 00:05:33.692

oh ho it's kinda like mustardy.

00:05:41.082 --> 00:05:43.030
Almost mustardy but
sour, like a sour drink.

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:43.880
It's really good.

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:47.720

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:07.980
Okay, but yeah, we are moving on now.

00:06:24.616 --> 00:06:25.449

(upbeat acoustic guitar music)

00:06:46.432 --> 00:06:47.265

- [Mark] Oh yes!

00:07:00.756 --> 00:07:02.817
- They're not selling it, but
like, we'll get it from them.

00:07:02.817 --> 00:07:03.783
- [Mark] Oh yes!

00:07:03.783 --> 00:07:04.616
- Like durian?

00:07:04.616 --> 00:07:05.510

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:06.343
- Really?

00:07:06.343 --> 00:07:07.176

00:07:09.581 --> 00:07:10.540
- [Mark] So we were driving tasked to,

we're almost to Weligama actually,

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:13.300
or maybe we are in Weligama but

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:15.740
we saw a truck selling local durian.

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:18.760
And the truck was actually,
like, they were stuck.

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:21.858
I think the truck was broken down but they

00:07:21.858 --> 00:07:23.800
they waited for us, we pulled them over.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:26.380
They waited for us, they're
about to get some durian.

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:28.620
They're about to,
they're not selling them,

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:31.290
but for us they decided
to make an exception.

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:32.740
And you can smell'em.

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:36.118
I'm in the right van with the Malaysians.

00:07:36.118 --> 00:07:37.349
- Nammit.

00:07:37.349 --> 00:07:38.689

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:51.890
(vehicles honking)

00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:52.723
- [Ben] Oh.

00:07:52.723 --> 00:07:54.830
Can we just get him to follow
us back to the hotel then?

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:55.856
- [Mark] Yes!

00:07:55.856 --> 00:07:56.909
(laughs)

00:07:56.909 --> 00:07:59.149
- [Ruzaina] You can buy then!

00:07:59.149 --> 00:08:01.549
- [Ying] (speaking Thai)

00:08:01.549 --> 00:08:02.382
Micah

00:08:03.758 --> 00:08:04.591
how's that?

00:08:04.591 --> 00:08:05.424
- Mm!

00:08:05.424 --> 00:08:06.257
(laughs)

00:08:06.257 --> 00:08:07.090
- [Mark] Yes!

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:09.213
Our first bite of Sri Lankan durian.

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:13.870
Ho ho ho ho ho.

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:17.020
- [Mark] It's so creamy, so buttery,

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:18.320
just a hint of bitterness.

00:08:22.801 --> 00:08:24.847
- Ruzaina, it's amazing, yeah?

00:08:24.847 --> 00:08:25.780
- It's so good, right?

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:27.737
I don't know how people
don't like to eat this

00:08:27.737 --> 00:08:30.398
because it's so good.
- [Mark] Unbelievable.

00:08:30.398 --> 00:08:32.113
It's so creamy, mm.

00:08:32.113 --> 00:08:34.000
- [Mark] I think they're
negotiating to buy an

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.770
entire basket of durian to
bring back to the hotel.

00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:38.800
Or to bring outside of the hotel.

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:41.053
But, it's good, it's really, really good.

00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:44.804
And we're having one
more as we stand here.

00:08:44.804 --> 00:08:47.360
(upbeat acoustic guitar music)

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.610
- [Ben] Take video, yeah.

00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:54.080
- [Mark] It's always good
to have impromptu durian.

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:58.960
Mm, and every one we've tried,

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:01.270
I think we've had about
four standing here.

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:02.810
They all taste different.

00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:03.830
They're all different sweetnesses,

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:06.100
all different, like, complexities.

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:07.370
This one is less sweet

00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:10.410
and not quite like as flavorful actually.

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:11.310
Still good though.

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:15.370
I think we're finished
here, we got some durians

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:17.220
to bring back for the others as well.

00:09:19.615 --> 00:09:20.782
- [Ying] Okay!

00:09:21.913 --> 00:09:24.824
(Micah speaking Thai with Ying)

00:09:24.824 --> 00:09:28.810
- [Mark] Oh, oh yeah, we
want soursop so bad too.

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:31.103
More durian. (laughs)

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:34.590
We just made it down
the road like 100 meters

00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:36.810
and there's another fruit stall.

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:38.860
Oh man, that's a beautiful fruit.

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:41.238
There's bananas, there's more durian.

00:09:41.238 --> 00:09:42.450
There's rambutan, there's star fruit.

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:44.039
There's tomotoes, there's pineapples.

00:09:44.039 --> 00:09:45.481
There's, aw, soursop!

00:09:45.481 --> 00:09:46.700
We need to get some soursop!

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:47.980
- My name Michael.

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:49.070
- [Mark] Wow, cool!

00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:51.360
- Micah, very cool.
- [Mark] Cool, cool!

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:52.460
- [Michael] Nice name!
- [Mark] Thank you very much.

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:53.550
- [Mark] You have wood apple today?

00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:55.600
Wood apple.
- Yes, yes, everything.

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.260
I have everything for.
- [Mark] Oh there's wood apple

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:58.093
over there, okay.

00:09:58.093 --> 00:10:00.260
- [Mark] Thank you, mango.

00:10:03.777 --> 00:10:04.770
No, is that mango?

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:06.330
Yeah.

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:07.580
Wow it tastes like honey.

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:12.100
- [Mark] It's like the
sweetest mango you'll ever have

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:13.535
Wow
- It's so delicious

00:10:13.535 --> 00:10:15.300
- [Mark] It's so sweet!

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:16.343
Like, unbelievable.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.435
It's almost like sweet and starchy.

00:10:19.435 --> 00:10:20.536
- [Ben] Jack fruit.

00:10:20.536 --> 00:10:21.476
- The right one

00:10:21.476 --> 00:10:22.309
- [Ben] Yep!

00:10:22.309 --> 00:10:23.397
- [Ruzaina] May one to me.

00:10:23.397 --> 00:10:24.485
(speaking Sri Lankan)

00:10:24.485 --> 00:10:26.467
- [Mark] I try this one?

00:10:26.467 --> 00:10:28.550
Okay this is the soursop.

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:32.313
Mm, oh soursop is awesome.

00:10:33.317 --> 00:10:37.253
Beautifully sour but like,
creamy like, milky sourness.

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:39.578
Round two, durian?

00:10:39.578 --> 00:10:42.578
(motorbike passing)

00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:50.493
- [Michael] Nice one.

00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:54.470
- [Mark] Okay, thank you very much.

00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:57.272
Well we had to try another
durian, this is a smaller one.

00:10:57.272 --> 00:10:58.105
- Mm

00:10:58.105 --> 00:10:58.938
- Mm!

00:10:58.938 --> 00:10:59.771
- Mm.
- Yes (laughs)

00:10:59.771 --> 00:11:00.604
- This is way better.

00:11:00.604 --> 00:11:01.437
- I'm eating so (laughs)
- They're getting better.

00:11:01.437 --> 00:11:02.453
Upgrading every round with stuff.

00:11:02.453 --> 00:11:04.133
They're getting better.
- Just getting some grunts.

00:11:04.133 --> 00:11:05.532
- Mm.
- There's no seeds!

00:11:05.532 --> 00:11:07.663
- Mm.
- Oh yeah, oh ho ho ho wow.

00:11:07.663 --> 00:11:10.610
- Mm.
- Oh this one is amazing.

00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:11.690
Oh that's the taste right there.

00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:13.320
The bitterness,
- [Ben] Yeah.

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:16.320
- slightly fermented, and nutty.

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:18.283
Oh man, yeah that one, okay.

00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:20.970
- [Mark] That's the taste right there.

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:21.820
This one is even better.

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:23.142
- [Ben] I think we need another, one more.

00:11:23.142 --> 00:11:23.975
- Yeah.

00:11:23.975 --> 00:11:25.200
- [Mark] I think we need
- Can we get one more?

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:27.159
- [Mark] Another one of these.
- Oh my God!

00:11:27.159 --> 00:11:27.992
- This is why I'm hanging out with

00:11:27.992 --> 00:11:29.643
the Malaysians, Ben and Bobby.

00:11:29.643 --> 00:11:32.662
(laughs together)

00:11:32.662 --> 00:11:33.538
- One Sri Lankan, Malaysian

00:11:33.538 --> 00:11:34.620
- Whenever you're eating durian you'll

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:36.300
always hear, "I need another one."

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:37.240
- [Ben] Yeah.

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:39.040
(upbeat acoustic guitar music)

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:42.340
- [Ben] Right after we
all washed our hands like.

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:43.173
- [Mark] The sacrifice

00:11:43.173 --> 00:11:44.640
- [Bobby] No, no, no, I'll just have half.

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:45.553
- Next durian.

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:52.181
These little guys, these little
guys have impressive flavor.

00:11:52.181 --> 00:11:57.181
(upbeat acoustic guitar
with keyboard music)

00:12:03.753 --> 00:12:06.410
Mm, oh ho ho ho, wow.

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:08.050
I'm just gonna go ahead
and take a seat here.

00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:10.090
I think I'm just gonna
move into this fruit stall.

00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:14.007
(upbeat acoustic guitar music)

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.230
- [Mark] Smells like cheese, yeah.

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:18.180
- [Michael] Wood apple!

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:21.347
(bangs on wood apple)

00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:25.280
- [Michael] It's good.

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:27.780
- [Mark] Oh yeah, there it is.

00:12:29.559 --> 00:12:30.523
What is that one?

00:12:30.523 --> 00:12:31.600
- This is honey

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:33.130
- [Mark] Oh, honey!

00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:33.963
Wow.

00:12:33.963 --> 00:12:34.796
- Palm honey

00:12:34.796 --> 00:12:35.697
- [Mark] Palm honey.

00:12:35.697 --> 00:12:39.614
(upbeat acoustic guitar music)

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:43.763
- [Michael] Honey bunny.

00:12:48.237 --> 00:12:49.070
(Mark laughs)

00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:50.280
- [Ben] Alright, you go first

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:51.928
- [Mark] (laughs) Yes!

00:12:51.928 --> 00:12:52.761
- Mm, mm!

00:12:52.761 --> 00:12:53.620
- [Mark] But the taste is awesome.

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:55.070
- [Michael] Good, good, good!

00:12:56.730 --> 00:12:57.563
- [Mark] Yeah.

00:12:57.563 --> 00:12:59.060
So another fruit that you have to eat when

00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:01.080
you're in Sri Lanka is the wood apple.

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:02.930
And when I was in Sri
Lanka on my last trip

00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:07.820
which was in like 2012 I believe.

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:09.818
No, it was like 2010!

00:13:09.818 --> 00:13:11.870
But I remember eating wood apple on every

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:13.740
single day, every single occasion.

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:15.540
Just kinda scoops it into your hand.

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:20.543
Oh yes, that is the taste I remember.

00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:26.620
It's pudding, it's like, it's
kinda like tamarinds to me.

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:31.140
Very sour, like mushy
because it's extra ripe.

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:32.630
And

00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:36.250
It's just unique, it's a fruit
you gotta try, it's amazing.

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:38.790
And with that palm honey, pretty good.

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:40.060
- Cleaning the blood, yes.

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:41.630
cleaning the blood.
- [Mark] That's very good.

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:42.677
Thank you.

00:13:42.677 --> 00:13:44.780
- [Michael] You make this the juice.

00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:45.730
Very, very good.

00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:47.167
- [Mark] Very nice.

00:13:47.167 --> 00:13:48.343
- [Michael] You make the juice.

00:13:49.407 --> 00:13:51.547
- You see last one, last one there.

00:13:51.547 --> 00:13:52.569
- [Bobby] No, no, no.
- [Ben] No more, no more.

00:13:52.569 --> 00:13:54.866
- Last one, last one, last
one, last one, last one.

00:13:54.866 --> 00:13:55.699
- Oh, lamut!

00:13:55.699 --> 00:13:56.936
- Sweet potato.

00:13:56.936 --> 00:13:57.769
- [Ruzaina] Sweet potato?

00:13:57.769 --> 00:13:58.602
- Yes.

00:13:58.602 --> 00:14:00.060
- [Michael] That side.

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:01.147
- [Mark] Oh yeah, this one.

00:14:01.147 --> 00:14:01.980
I forget the english name though.

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:03.797
- [Ben] It's like chiku, chiku.

00:14:03.797 --> 00:14:05.146
- [Mark] Ying.

00:14:05.146 --> 00:14:05.979
- Mm.

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:12.273
It's very very fruit, very,
very fruit, very, very sweet.

00:14:12.273 --> 00:14:13.106
- Thank you very much.

00:14:13.106 --> 00:14:15.113
- Have a good day.
- Okay, have a good day.

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:20.570
Okay, that was a completely impromptu

00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:24.003
massive fruit buffet stop.

00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:26.863
And we are back in the van.

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:29.163
Micah did you?

00:14:30.236 --> 00:14:31.980
- Him, him, it measure up.
- [Ben] No, it's not him.

00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:33.127
- Is it the
- [Ben] It's durian.

00:14:33.127 --> 00:14:35.306
(laughs)

00:14:35.306 --> 00:14:37.076
- I love it, poor Micah's
gonna get blamed for it.

00:14:37.076 --> 00:14:38.046
(laughs)

00:14:38.046 --> 00:14:39.250
- He said "Ya", I said " Did you?"

00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:41.180
Then you're like nope, it's durian.

00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:44.980
- Micah I'm very sorry for,
for blaming that on you.

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:49.507
I had forgotten already that
we had six durians in the back.

00:14:49.507 --> 00:14:50.666
(laughs)

00:14:50.666 --> 00:14:53.916
(Mridangam drum music)

00:15:02.554 --> 00:15:05.126
(door opening)

00:15:05.126 --> 00:15:05.959
Oh

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:11.997
Wow, ho ho ho.

00:15:13.497 --> 00:15:14.610
(child talking)

00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:16.640
We made it to Weligama after that

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:20.120
durian craziness and fruit buffet.

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:21.140
Checked into the hotel.

00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:23.970
The view from the room is incredible!

00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:26.180
We're gonna be staying here
for a couple of nights.

00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:28.930
Have a little bit of time to relax.

00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:30.540
And then we're gonna be going to dinner.

00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:33.000
But, just, come check out this view.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.176
Oh man, I didn't even know this was such a

00:15:35.176 --> 00:15:37.263
surfing beach either.

00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:40.030
How do you open it?

00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:40.863
Open is up?

00:15:40.863 --> 00:15:41.696
Oh, there we go.

00:15:42.955 --> 00:15:46.710
Aw, oh the sound of the ocean, the waves.

00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:49.274
Aw, tons of surfers out there.

00:15:49.274 --> 00:15:53.191
(upbeat acoustic guitar music)

00:15:59.966 --> 00:16:02.470
(waves rushing in)

00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:04.020
For dinner tonight we're actually gonna be

00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:07.110
eating on the beach, on
the sand at a restaurant.

00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:11.680
Which was just 50 minute
drive down from the hotel.

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:13.677
The water is beautiful.

00:16:13.677 --> 00:16:15.600
Sri Lanka is beautiful.

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:18.368
The coconut trees, the lapping waves.

00:16:18.368 --> 00:16:22.060
It really is a beautiful, stunning island.

00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:23.230
And we're getting ready to sit down

00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:24.680
for seafood tonight for dinner.

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:25.837
- [Man] Food? I like that.

00:16:25.837 --> 00:16:27.348
- [Sinan] Yeah. (laughs)

00:16:27.348 --> 00:16:28.970
- [Mark] Here we go, don't hold back.

00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:30.920
- [Abram] Oh yeah, yes!

00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:33.883
- [Mark] Oh ho ho, nice.

00:16:35.322 --> 00:16:37.503
Fried butter shrimp I believe.

00:16:41.079 --> 00:16:41.912
Oh wow.

00:16:43.809 --> 00:16:45.130
Aw, it's awesome.

00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:46.723
Crispy.

00:16:46.723 --> 00:16:47.556
Shrimpy.

00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:49.823
Wonderful.

00:16:49.823 --> 00:16:50.656
(clang of cutlery)

00:16:50.656 --> 00:16:51.873
- [Mark] Yeah, yep, go for it.

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:53.800
- [Abram] Alright!

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:54.690
- [Mark] Delicious.

00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:56.873
Fresh local tuna from Sri Lanka.

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:00.163
Oh wow.

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:05.150
Oh that's stunning, melt in your mouth.

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:09.168
Sesame seeds I think crusted
around it, really good.

00:17:09.168 --> 00:17:12.501
(upbeat keyboard music)

00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:15.346
- Delicious.

00:17:15.346 --> 00:17:17.390
- How's your aunt?

00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:18.789
- I'm loving life right now.

00:17:18.789 --> 00:17:19.771
Put it right in front of me.

00:17:19.771 --> 00:17:20.821
- [David] What is, what is?

00:17:20.821 --> 00:17:21.940
- [Ruzaina] This is sluff potatoes

00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:23.132
with stuffed with potatoe.

00:17:23.132 --> 00:17:24.325
This is squid, this is a very local dish.

00:17:24.325 --> 00:17:25.408
- [David] Ooh!

00:17:25.408 --> 00:17:26.615
- [Ruzaina] You will
only get it from here.

00:17:26.615 --> 00:17:28.160
- [David] Ooh!

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:30.120
- [Ruzaina] And he bought it
from a special place (mumbles)

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:32.194
Yeah he's from the southern side.

00:17:32.194 --> 00:17:35.250
- (mumbles) it's like a mustard
and like vinegar mix, yeah.

00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:37.920
So it's like a lot of onions and stuff.

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:39.500
- [Mark] Thank you, sir.

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:40.970
What's awesome about this place is that

00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:43.730
he's serving us all
Southern Sri Lankan food.

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:47.540
So it's all from this region,
regional Sri Lankan food.

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:49.980
One of the dishes that
you'll only find in the south

00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:52.080
is these stuffed squid which is from here.

00:17:54.579 --> 00:17:55.412
Oh, wow.

00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:57.712
Oh, that's amazing.

00:17:57.712 --> 00:17:58.545
- Want fry bread?

00:17:58.545 --> 00:17:59.810
- Oh, thank you!

00:17:59.810 --> 00:18:01.197
- [Abram] What a beast.

00:18:01.197 --> 00:18:03.480
- Tomatoey, mustardy
taste to it, really good.

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:04.490
And then the squid is so soft.

00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:07.410
See some of that fish,
it's topped with onions.

00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:08.940
You can see the turmeric on it.

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:12.073
It smells incredible and he
brought it over on a platter.

00:18:14.636 --> 00:18:15.469
Oh, wow.

00:18:16.784 --> 00:18:17.617
Oh.

00:18:18.566 --> 00:18:19.810
Oh, what is that?

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:23.723
Oh yeah.
- [Ruzaina] Hadiya.

00:18:23.723 --> 00:18:24.966
- [Mark] Now that looks good.

00:18:24.966 --> 00:18:26.070
That looks awesome.
- [Ruzaina] Okay, so this is

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:27.640
This is a southern cutta sambal.

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:31.253
It's filled with mohda fish,
like it's a southern style.

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:34.423
This is the karawila.

00:18:34.423 --> 00:18:37.870
This is very, very famous in Ceylon.

00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:40.610
You know like we do whole
array of dry salted fish

00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:43.371
with chilies and onions, look at that.

00:18:43.371 --> 00:18:44.240
- [Mark] So it's kind of like a condiment

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:45.754
or it's a main dish?
- It's a condiment.

00:18:45.754 --> 00:18:46.892
(laughs)

00:18:46.892 --> 00:18:49.550
- Yes, look at this, yes!
- [Mark] It just never ends.

00:18:49.550 --> 00:18:50.383
- Yes! Woo!

00:18:51.495 --> 00:18:52.328
- What is it?

00:18:52.328 --> 00:18:53.161
- I don't know but

00:18:53.161 --> 00:18:53.994
- [Mark] But it looks incredible.

00:18:53.994 --> 00:18:55.320
- [Abram] It looks tantalizing.

00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:58.800
- Onions on that fish
they're just blooming.

00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:00.680
Okay, just brought out a few more dishes

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:02.890
that we need to have immediately.

00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:03.740
- [Abram] Oh man.

00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:07.213
- [Mark] Oh, thank you.

00:19:07.213 --> 00:19:08.390
I think it's almost like a relish,

00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:09.420
you can see them onions in there,

00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:11.070
you can see there's meat as well.

00:19:13.394 --> 00:19:14.227
Oh.

00:19:15.707 --> 00:19:20.707
It's like caramelized, oniony,
saltiness, chili, stunning.

00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:24.023
- [Abram] Wow.

00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:29.743
Oh, yep.
- [Mark] Thank you.

00:19:29.743 --> 00:19:31.573
- [Abram] There we go.
- [Mark] Thank you guys.

00:19:32.871 --> 00:19:33.704
- [Abram] Mm, yep!

00:19:33.704 --> 00:19:35.740
- [Mark] Look at this prawn,
look at that curry sauce.

00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:38.593
The curry sauce is just
juicing into the prawn.

00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:41.088
I'll come back for the head later.

00:19:41.088 --> 00:19:42.699
Ho ho ho, look at that!

00:19:42.699 --> 00:19:43.999
Oh, the thickness of that!

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:46.646
- [Sinan] I think that's the first time

00:19:46.646 --> 00:19:48.304
that David's eaten something spicy.

00:19:48.304 --> 00:19:49.264
- Oh wow.

00:19:49.264 --> 00:19:50.150
- [Ruzaina] Thank you.

00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:52.310
- Oh that prawn, it's incredible.

00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:53.490
- [Abram] Food is amazing.

00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:56.323
- It's so meaty, it's so muscular.

00:19:57.388 --> 00:19:58.221
Mm, mm!

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:02.760
Dude, are you re-saucing me?

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:03.593
- [Abram] Yeah.

00:20:03.593 --> 00:20:04.489
- [Mark] Thank you, okay.

00:20:04.489 --> 00:20:05.891
- [Abram] Look at that.

00:20:05.891 --> 00:20:07.270
- [Mark] Oh ho ho ho ho ho ho.

00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:09.110
- [Sinan] I've never heard
"Are you re-saucing me?"

00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:10.093
(Mark laughs)

00:20:10.093 --> 00:20:11.040
- That's a true friend.

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:11.878
- [Sinan] Dunkage please?

00:20:11.878 --> 00:20:13.008
Dunkage?
- That's a

00:20:13.008 --> 00:20:14.103
- [David] Just dunk here.

00:20:14.103 --> 00:20:16.270
- That is a true friend, a true friend.

00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:17.683
- [Abram] Just getting better here.

00:20:17.683 --> 00:20:18.516
(laughs)

00:20:18.516 --> 00:20:19.349
- Thank you.

00:20:19.349 --> 00:20:20.182
- [Abram] Oh yeah.

00:20:20.182 --> 00:20:21.015
- Mm.

00:20:21.912 --> 00:20:22.745
Oh.

00:20:23.763 --> 00:20:25.230
Dude.

00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:27.281
I wanna shower in that sauce.

00:20:27.281 --> 00:20:29.531
(laughter)

00:20:32.170 --> 00:20:33.910
Part of the reason this meal is so

00:20:33.910 --> 00:20:36.800
much fun is because of
everybody that's here.

00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:37.757
- Yeah!

00:20:37.757 --> 00:20:40.150
- [Mark] (mumbles) The
Bedouin Foodie, Sinan, David

00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:42.283
- [David] Look at my hands.
- [Mark] Abram, Ruzaina.

00:20:43.298 --> 00:20:44.810
- Yeah, yeah.

00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:47.890
- Eating with good people
makes the food even better.

00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:50.821
But the food is, yeah, the
food is unbelievably good.

00:20:50.821 --> 00:20:52.211
(laughter)
- [David] No, hey, wait, wait

00:20:52.211 --> 00:20:53.840
- Wait, wait, wait.

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:55.540
Put these guys there.

00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:57.920
- [Mark] These guys are going
delirious from the food.

00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:00.300
- [David] This is gonna
be the best, okay guys!

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:02.030
- [Abram] I'm taking
some of that right here.

00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:03.580
- [David] Guys, guys, go ahead.

00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:05.653
- [Ruzaina] Oh wow.

00:21:05.653 --> 00:21:07.523
- Cheers. (laughs)

00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:12.413
- Yeah.

00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:14.473
It's just stunning.

00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:17.479
Mm.

00:21:17.479 --> 00:21:18.860
Mm.

00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:20.700
I'm covered in spice.

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:23.596
Oh, that is ridiculously good.

00:21:23.596 --> 00:21:27.090
Oh ho ho ho ho ho.
- [Ruzaina] Oh wow.

00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:29.078
- [Mark] Out of control.

00:21:29.078 --> 00:21:31.595
(Hoots)

00:21:31.595 --> 00:21:33.409
- [Mark] Oh, that, wow.

00:21:33.409 --> 00:21:34.320
- [Abram] Yes!

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:35.481
That looks deep!

00:21:35.481 --> 00:21:36.990
(laughs)

00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:37.823
Yeah!

00:21:37.823 --> 00:21:38.865
- [Mark] Should we check the depth?

00:21:38.865 --> 00:21:40.260
(laughs)

00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:42.992
- [Abram] It's about two
centimeters, it's deep.

00:21:42.992 --> 00:21:45.720
- [Sinan] Oh!

00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:48.013
- Oh shi- (laughs)

00:21:50.474 --> 00:21:51.995
I'm goin right for the money.

00:21:51.995 --> 00:21:54.173
- I'm going for this, look at this.

00:21:54.173 --> 00:21:55.660
This looks like friendly.

00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:56.800
- [Mark] How is it, Sinan?

00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:58.373
- It's unbelievably good.

00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:01.285
It's delicious.

00:22:01.285 --> 00:22:04.057
(laughs)

00:22:04.057 --> 00:22:05.290
- Ready?

00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:06.690
- [Mark] A boneless drumstick.
- [Ruzaina] Wow!

00:22:06.690 --> 00:22:09.480
- [David] Mark, I want
to dedicate this for you.

00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:10.793
- [Mark] Boneless drumstick.

00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:12.960
- Dedication for Mark.

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:14.893
- [Mark] Oh, thank you.

00:22:14.893 --> 00:22:16.953
- It looks appropriate, look at this.

00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:20.140
And then you could take
more of the juice here.

00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:22.217
Look at it, mm, mm, mm, mm.

00:22:23.405 --> 00:22:26.738
(upbeat keyboard music)

00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:29.160
- [Mark] Thank you, David.

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:31.799
- [Abram] Wow, people around
us must think we're animals.

00:22:31.799 --> 00:22:34.340
(laughs)

00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:36.310
- [Mark] This is after we've eaten like

00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:38.536
20 plates of other food already.

00:22:38.536 --> 00:22:41.740
We're just all like in a
different state of mind.

00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:45.240
We're seeing things, we're
not thinking straight.

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:49.460
And it is ama-, the food
is unbelievably good.

00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:51.338
The crab, oh wow.

00:22:51.338 --> 00:22:52.189
- 'Cause I love you.

00:22:52.189 --> 00:22:53.022
- [Mark] The spoon.

00:22:54.029 --> 00:22:56.112
(laughs)

00:22:57.198 --> 00:22:58.534
Oh wow.

00:22:58.534 --> 00:23:00.188
Oh ho ho ho ho, wow.

00:23:00.188 --> 00:23:03.868
Oh that sauce, oh the curry leaves.

00:23:03.868 --> 00:23:07.839
Oh, oh, I'm just gonna leave
that on my chin for later.

00:23:07.839 --> 00:23:08.759
Oh!

00:23:08.759 --> 00:23:09.770
(laughs)

00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:11.770
- [Mark] It's almost
too much, look at this.

00:23:11.770 --> 00:23:12.848
Oh nice to meet you!

00:23:12.848 --> 00:23:14.931
(laughs)

00:23:17.891 --> 00:23:18.724
- [David] 'Kay it's nothing, it's nothing.

00:23:18.724 --> 00:23:21.676
It's just pure crab meat there.

00:23:21.676 --> 00:23:23.676
- [Mark] Oh, that sauce!

00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:28.320
Got the claw fully sauced,
dripping in juices.

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:29.820
- [Abram] We do the straggler.

00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:33.373
- Oh wow.

00:23:34.210 --> 00:23:37.010
That is, it's actually stunning.

00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:37.843
Mind-blowing.

00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:41.540
- [Mark] We just finished with that meal.

00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:43.690
That was at Zephyr restaurant.

00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:47.260
A little bit south, I
believe, of Weligama.

00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:48.390
And we went into that meal,

00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:51.690
I honestly had no idea what to expect.

00:23:51.690 --> 00:23:54.350
It's on the beach, it's
a beautiful location.

00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:57.340
And all the dishes that we've
had were actually off-menu.

00:23:57.340 --> 00:24:00.330
That's special order, locally prepared.

00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:01.970
Those are all Southern Sri Lankan,

00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:03.790
specifically Southern
Sri Lankan dishes and

00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:06.260
that was an unbelievable meal.

00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:08.150
I still can't hardly even comprehend

00:24:08.150 --> 00:24:09.270
how delicious that food was.

00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:10.440
I want to say a massive thank you

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:13.257
to David, The Hungry Tourist,
on the Best of Sri Lanka tour.

00:24:13.257 --> 00:24:15.610
And Ruzaina and Uchith and Nick

00:24:15.610 --> 00:24:17.630
and Laki for arranging everything.

00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:20.010
This has been a spectacular day.

00:24:20.010 --> 00:24:23.550
And again, I had no idea what
to expect, but what a day.

00:24:23.550 --> 00:24:25.570
I'm actually kinda sore in my shoulder

00:24:25.570 --> 00:24:27.680
from all of that crab eating.

00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:30.620
It was just, things got
a little out of control.

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:32.060
