00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.395
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.360
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.390
I really live to teach.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.110
It is my greatest joy,
and meeting those students

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.840
and working with
those students is

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.450
what is most meaningful to me.

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.390
University of Arizona
distinguished professor

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.570
Melissa Fitch brings
an infectious level

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.660
of energy and creativity
to her classroom

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.790
in the College of Humanities.

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.860
I want them to feel really
excited about this-- oh wow,

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.420
OK, we're learning this.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.410
An author and recipient
of three Fulbright Awards,

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.930
in 2008, she received
the University

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.620
of Arizona's Five Star Teaching
Award, the institution's

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.480
highest teaching honor.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.500
In 2013, she received the
Creative Teaching Award.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:12.530
And in 2015, she was named one
of three university-wide 1885

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.680
Society Distinguished
Fellows based

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.680
on her research,
teaching, and service.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.020
She's probably one of our
best recruiters with students.

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.230
Students are really in
love with her classes,

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.960
with the topics that she offers.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.240
A lot of students who
take Dr. Fitch's class

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.530
want to take more classes
from Dr. Fitch afterwards.

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.025
We've seen a lot in terms of
the flipped classrooms, how

00:01:40.025 --> 00:01:44.230
we're going to engage students
in a more creative manner.

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:47.070
It kind of feels like she's
been doing that from the get-go,

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.240
just because she wants to
engage with the person--

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.900
When I am doing a
lecture-focused session,

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.965
I intentionally am stopping
every 10 or 15 minutes,

00:01:56.965 --> 00:01:58.340
and I'm saying,
now, you're going

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.830
to have to talk to
this person about what

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:01.850
we're looking at here.

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.860
Now I want you to analyze
this, and I want you to do--

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.020
so they have to get
out of that little daze

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.200
that they tend to be in.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.300
It was never part of my
plan to be in academia,

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.010
by any stretch of
the imagination.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.100
I had studied in Mexico, and
then I had studied in Spain,

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.980
and got my undergraduate degree.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.100
And honestly, I didn't know
what I was going to do,

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.830
and I wanted, desperately,
to get back to the border.

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.230
As someone who's
bicultural, bilingual,

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.560
half Mexican, half
Anglo, I really

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.510
am only comfortable,
to be honest

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.820
with you, in the border region.

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.480
She signed on as a founding
faculty member of the Arizona

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.410
International campus at
the University of Arizona

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.570
and then a faculty member in
the College of Humanities,

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:57.120
where she's a specialist in
Latin American popular culture.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.540
And one of the things
I try to teach students

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.160
is that the way that we learn
about people of other cultures

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.260
or countries is not particularly
innocent-- that, in fact,

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.840
there are some ideological
assumptions that we can tease

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.140
out, and that we
can see, and it's

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.930
important to be able to
question a lot of the ideas

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:24.800
that we assume are natural,
or normal, or whatnot.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.280
Her love of the tango
began in Argentina,

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.280
where she enrolled
in a class on a whim

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.640
and was inspired by
her first instructor.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.300
I had never taken a dance class
of any kind in my entire life,

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.540
and at the end of the hour,
I asked her what she thought,

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.680
and she said that
there was no hope.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.480
You know, frankly, she
was absolutely right.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.920
And so when she
got to the end, I

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.330
said, well, so I guess
I'll see you tomorrow.

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.380
[APPLAUSE]
