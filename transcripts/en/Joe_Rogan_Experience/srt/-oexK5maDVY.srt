1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:04,130
And that's probably the way to do
it with cotton. And right now, POW.

2
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:09,420
Pow. So what did it have? Tell
me about the tour bus. This tour.

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,540
The tour bus champ. No, no,
no, no. He's not. Let's,

4
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:14,860
let's hold up on labels
till we hear the story.

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,630
I've only one one victory
in this whole thing.

6
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:21,110
Tour buses. He came so close to the
weight loss. Do they come close?

7
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:23,880
And then I'm really only have one
year where it was like socialist.

8
00:00:23,881 --> 00:00:28,860
It was like a Marxist. No one could lose.
Yeah. Even if you lost it didn't matter.

9
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:33,010
I like that. That was coming. Yeah.
There was a good this year. This year.

10
00:00:33,011 --> 00:00:36,180
It's gotta be a good way. Listen,
last year almost killed myself. Yeah,

11
00:00:36,181 --> 00:00:40,470
we've got to do it differently than that.
Your Ping fucking purple wasn't purple,

12
00:00:40,471 --> 00:00:43,910
but it wasn't the right color. What
color was this word? I had brown though.

13
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,540
I was worried, but it wasn't, it was
just dehydration. Severe Dehydration.

14
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:53,220
There was days where I would drink
literally fucking gallons of water.

15
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:58,530
Yeah. You don't want ice. I try it
without personally. You're crazy. Um,

16
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:01,660
I was drinking so much, I was drinking
water and I was adding salt to it.

17
00:01:01,661 --> 00:01:05,130
I was that in Himalayan salt to the
water was cause I know I was dehydrated

18
00:01:05,131 --> 00:01:07,650
myself so much. I would have
puddles on the ground. You still,

19
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:11,400
that still wasn't sufficient?
Like did I set up a set off an alarm?

20
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,970
I remember that set off a fire
alarm in the gym from my sweat.

21
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:20,580
Uh Huh. Yeah. I even never heard of that.

22
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:24,480
Of course I still have PTSD from
last year. So Brock Tobar Dude,

23
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:27,450
like I get texts from you guys and
panic sits in my heart and I go, wait,

24
00:01:27,451 --> 00:01:30,720
what does he like gets it?
She thinks I'm crazy for sure.

25
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:33,950
I moved and it just sets wives.
You're the only one who that dad.

26
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:38,040
You got Lou in the home life? Yeah. If
I come to New York or would have been,

27
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,440
I mean la would have been terrible to
be for an extra month, but like, uh,

28
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:43,800
I saw that fucking stupid
device when I was moving.

29
00:01:43,801 --> 00:01:46,130
I opened up the drawer and I was like,
I didn't want, I was like, get it out.

30
00:01:46,131 --> 00:01:50,310
Get out here. I want to Chucky.
Chucky the little dog. Yeah.

31
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,270
Yeah, man. I think Leanne and push,

32
00:01:54,271 --> 00:01:56,460
you're going to podcast
this entire sober October.

33
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:00,960
She threw you under the bus
in the fucking radio station.

34
00:02:00,961 --> 00:02:05,340
Tell us you guys didn't hear that story.
You guys should have white swaps.

35
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,353
Tell that story.

36
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:10,680
They were asking about drugs and how
hard I party and I was just talking shit.

37
00:02:10,681 --> 00:02:14,240
And I was like, you know, I go, uh,
I go, I spoke a little bit of weed.

38
00:02:14,241 --> 00:02:16,620
I'll every now and then if cocaine's
on a switch blade, I'll hit it.

39
00:02:16,621 --> 00:02:19,740
But for most part, I only, I only,

40
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:21,690
I only do mushrooms once a year.

41
00:02:21,691 --> 00:02:24,510
And Leanne just heard me and she was
making breakfast for the girls. She goes,

42
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:27,900
he doesn't do mushrooms and he doesn't
do cocaine. He's got high blood pressure.

43
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,920
I'm like, bitch, I'm trying
to move tickets and Dayton,

44
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:36,490
you under the bus tour. Fall dates
available now, but right now, dude. Yeah,

45
00:02:36,491 --> 00:02:40,450
we do right now. Right now. Right now.
Right now. [inaudible] dot com is weird.

46
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,230
You sound like you're
coming off a coke bender,

47
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,620
Torin, hard food. But
saying, think about Tom,

48
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,890
like when you first started
going on the road with me,

49
00:02:48,891 --> 00:02:52,740
you're way far further ahead
now than it was as a future.

50
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:57,860
Oh, right when he was opening for me, we
were doing, yeah, we were doing clubs.

51
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,830
We're doing all clubs.
Did you make,

52
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:04,240
we started do theaters when you started
to headline your own places. That's true.

53
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:07,210
Yeah. That was pretty crazy. Tid
was quick. I was thinking about it,

54
00:03:07,211 --> 00:03:10,870
about that level you were at that we
all thought was like damn. Well, yeah,

55
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:15,100
I mean it's like you, you know someone
you're like, it's accessible. Yeah. Right.

56
00:03:15,101 --> 00:03:18,250
So you're right. It seems
normal. You make sense. Like, Oh,

57
00:03:18,251 --> 00:03:21,430
I could sell out this whole weekend too.
Yeah. And then when you do, you're like,

58
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:24,910
oh shit. Like what a fucking
comedian. I'm a real comedian.

59
00:03:24,911 --> 00:03:27,430
I sell that a club and just,
just because we've got in shape,

60
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,720
I didn't even think about just because
it's so rocky. That's just because

61
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:36,400
I didn't think about theaters back then.
Like when we were all in the club.

62
00:03:36,401 --> 00:03:38,140
I never thought we were just doing clubs.

63
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:41,020
Like I had done a couple
of theaters here and there,

64
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:45,880
but for the most part it was just about
just working. Yeah, that's what I said.

65
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:48,380
We was like, what do you want to do with
the curves? I can, I'd like to have clubs.

66
00:03:48,381 --> 00:03:50,830
He was of the theater. I was like,
I couldn't do theater cause why?

67
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:55,030
Cause you said you could do whatever
you want. And I was like, all right,

68
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,500
dice caught me to go on the road.

69
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:59,590
He really planted a fucking seat in my
head one day in the back parking lot at

70
00:03:59,591 --> 00:04:03,260
the comedy store. So why don't you do
the road? I said, I dunno. He goes, hey,

71
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,820
don't fucking just hang around here. And
he's like, you can make a good living.

72
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,080
He goes, you don't need these fucking TV
guys. And I was like, wow, he's right.

73
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:14,200
Oh I was thinking about it and I was
like, he's right. Does change my life.

74
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:15,700
I've said this a million times,

75
00:04:15,701 --> 00:04:20,230
but you and bill burr in the back of the
store telling me it shows not that good.

76
00:04:20,231 --> 00:04:21,041
You should just stick with,

77
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:25,180
stand up to Congress and knew that you
are way better than that. I'm like,

78
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:29,090
you're not even doing your standup
justice. Like I'd see you do stand up,

79
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,850
but it's like he hadn't
done it in five months.

80
00:04:30,851 --> 00:04:35,320
He'd been fucking Thailand or some
shit swinging off of a tree by a roller

81
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,280
coaster with special people. I was
worried you were going to get killed.

82
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,520
Like you were doing so many different
things. There's so many different places.

83
00:04:42,521 --> 00:04:45,220
I called him up once.
He was drunk on a motorcycle in Vietnam.

84
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,170
It's like what he did,

85
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:56,880
he learned these uncomplete
Lee unnecessary life skills
can apply to any man.

86
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,640
You remember everybody a unicycle and
be like, what is like I learned in Rome,

87
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,830
I could do whatever I want to know.
Okay.

88
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,680
He's a harder than when them
hoverboards what's harder? Oh, the dude,

89
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:12,370
those hover for in the, in the, uh, in
the ocean. Oh No, I don't mean that.

90
00:05:12,371 --> 00:05:15,300
I mean the things that the kids wrote
were out on just the wheel in the middle.

91
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:20,020
And those are, we all in the middle. Rich
rebuilds, you know that youtube channel.

92
00:05:20,021 --> 00:05:25,000
Do you know which putting why he's a,
he's a youtube host and he also,

93
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:28,930
he fixed his, he's like the
first guy to ever build a Tesla.

94
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:33,850
He bought a junk Tesla that somebody
had let get flooded with water and he's

95
00:05:33,851 --> 00:05:36,160
just a really smart guy and he's
a tech guy. So he's like, okay,

96
00:05:36,161 --> 00:05:39,550
what the fuck is in that thing?
Like how do I fix this? Like,

97
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:42,040
so all the wires were fucked up.
The battery was toast.

98
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:47,170
So the bought it crashed one and he took
the battery in the engine out of the

99
00:05:47,171 --> 00:05:51,670
crashed one and put it in the one that
he owned and then rewind and went through

100
00:05:51,671 --> 00:05:55,810
this crazy process to get a Tesla
to work that he eventually did.

101
00:05:55,811 --> 00:05:58,160
And now he has his own,
it's what's

102
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,390
called the electric garage
in Massachusetts where
he rebuilds these Teslas.

103
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:07,550
But uh, what was my point? Oh, he had
one of those with a big ass fat tire.

104
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:11,090
When you ride on it like a skateboard.
That's hard. That looks hard.

105
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,240
That's hard to do. [inaudible] was
killed someone on a, on a segway.

106
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:19,241
One time I was in Rome and we were on
segways and I was just screwing around and

107
00:06:19,701 --> 00:06:22,520
then I just hopped off and then
realized that when you hop off,

108
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:23,383
if you're lean afford,

109
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:27,980
it's the heaps going and this thing
started whipping around me just

110
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:33,890
and we're in like a big Piatsa and I let
just let go of, it didn't hit anyone,

111
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:37,320
but everyone around us was standing
dead still. Like oh my God,

112
00:06:37,321 --> 00:06:40,220
I would have been bodied right there.
You're supposed to dive on it like a,

113
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:43,190
like a good hero. Yeah. Do you
know what our funding the made?

114
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:47,730
There's no way you're doing that. I'm
on it. No Way. You'd have to take it.

115
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:52,670
1315 people die.
Just walk out casually.

116
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,100
So I don't know what happened.
I don't know those Hubbard,

117
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:57,200
those hover boards that are,

118
00:06:57,201 --> 00:06:59,690
cause I should jet skis where you
go like 40 feet up in the air.

119
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:03,320
Oh those are crazy. Those are
fun as fat. Cool. Look cool.

120
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:05,270
I like the guys who'd
like cut it turned over.

121
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,720
I'd like to know present and then it
starts to go down and they just start with

122
00:07:08,721 --> 00:07:13,680
extra speed. Just shooting where
the Macola, what are they doing?

123
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:18,410
Those things are fun as fuck. Legit. Yeah.

124
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,180
I could do a back flip on one.

125
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:23,510
All you gotta do is like fall backwards
and then kick your feet around.

126
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:26,050
I picked up on that one quick. Hmm. Yeah.

127
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:28,190
There's a lot of useless skills
I have from travel channel.

128
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:32,390
Did you traveled so much?
Oh my God always bothered me.

129
00:07:32,391 --> 00:07:35,390
You know why I bothered me?
Because I would've probably
done it too if I was you.

130
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:37,670
And I was like, God damn it.
How do you get out of that?

131
00:07:37,671 --> 00:07:40,740
Cause I know that feeling like it's,
you have the best job ever.

132
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,920
You were on a TV show. You're like,
oh my God, I have the best job ever.

133
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:46,310
I'm gonna fuck I'm on a fucking TV
show. But yet you're still like, fuck,

134
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,890
I've got to get out of this.
Yeah.

135
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,410
It's weird cause you do get to go to
really cool places and get paid for it.

136
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,371
Yeah,
that was cool.

137
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:55,760
But you also mean you weren't thrilled
or can you miss stand up more?

138
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:57,040
I missed it.
I missed Hannah.

139
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:01,650
What was happening is Tom's
career was exploding at the time.

140
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,860
The day I fell off a waterfall.

141
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:07,400
Do you remember that was in aspen
and push called me. She's like,

142
00:08:07,401 --> 00:08:09,410
I'm talking to Tom and he's
talking about these one nighters,

143
00:08:09,411 --> 00:08:12,410
but I want to do the funny bones.
I was so far removed from stand up.

144
00:08:12,411 --> 00:08:14,240
I didn't even, I didn't even
know you could do one nighters.

145
00:08:14,241 --> 00:08:18,020
I didn't know that theaters were an
option and I think I was at a store a week

146
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:20,840
later and you were like,
you know Tom's doing like legit theaters.

147
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:24,830
And I remember just going, I missed,
what if I just missed it entirely?

148
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:26,600
He could have in some people do.

149
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:30,560
We all know guys that were really funny
back in the day and then they somehow or

150
00:08:30,561 --> 00:08:34,310
another quit. It fell apart.
Dude. What if you had been like,

151
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:37,750
I'm going to lean into travel
channel? Dude it was, I was like,

152
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:39,830
you became a Christian,
like Super Christian.

153
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:44,240
Got a cross tattoo on your arm just to
let them know I'm really down with them.

154
00:08:44,241 --> 00:08:46,600
I'm sure your reps told
you all those third church.

155
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,740
Go to church with a fucking golf shirt on.
When I got fired from travel channel,

156
00:08:51,741 --> 00:08:55,040
I, my world melted down. That was
right when we were getting fat shamed.

157
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:57,990
I was fed getting fashion
named Leanne scheduled. Uh, uh

158
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:02,750
hello. Can you say we were getting
cut [inaudible] on a second.

159
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:05,540
You're saying you saying
you were getting fat shamed,

160
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:09,560
but you got to let people know like you
don't really believe in fat shaming.

161
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:13,220
You weren't really getting
fat [inaudible] at the time.

162
00:09:13,221 --> 00:09:16,730
It was very one sided deal at the time.
I got fired from travel channel.

163
00:09:16,731 --> 00:09:20,200
I was die definitely. It was one
sided and I felt it hard as fuck.

164
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:24,040
Your friend was fucking with you because
he was worried you were going to die to

165
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:28,820
do it though. You did on a major platform.
There wasn't like a morning radio.

166
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:34,530
He was on another level, put it on
his fucking special on Netflix. Dude,

167
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:38,510
imagine taking a coated appearance which
was massive at the time and you go up

168
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:41,570
now I'm going to use this for fun.
I'm not going to try to promote myself.

169
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,660
Dj Dad mouth is my favorite character
that anybody's ever to more than maybe

170
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,670
show.
When do you do that?

171
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:51,110
I love that you were doing that because
I hated those shows. I was like,

172
00:09:51,111 --> 00:09:53,060
why would he do those shows?
TV is terrible.

173
00:09:53,061 --> 00:09:55,830
You do morning TV dressed
up like a fake wrapper.

174
00:09:55,970 --> 00:10:00,970
She's no cigarette created a character
called Dj dad mouth and he would just

175
00:10:01,941 --> 00:10:05,540
show up places and the people did not
know what the fuck to do with them because

176
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:10,780
the lowest rung in all of show
business is morning television.

177
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:14,990
I'm so sorry if you listen to this
and you're a local morning television,

178
00:10:14,991 --> 00:10:19,150
no slick ice delivered newspapers. Okay.
We all way better than morning host.

179
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:23,030
It's, it's one of the lowest rungs
in all of Showbiz. It's so weird.

180
00:10:23,031 --> 00:10:24,480
Wrong where you're trapped.

181
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:29,060
It's like you're broadcasting out of
like a Christian convenience store or

182
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:29,451
something.

183
00:10:29,451 --> 00:10:33,350
It's very strange because the worst part
two is that the four of us plus like

184
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:38,530
90% of the ax working those clubs do
not have a fan base watching that show.

185
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:42,020
What? I mean you, you put
it together, you're like,

186
00:10:42,021 --> 00:10:46,310
this is definitely a waste of time. Like
we're wasting our time. Right? Yeah.

187
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,200
That's the only one that morning. I'll
be up at fucking six to do this. To do.

188
00:10:51,201 --> 00:10:53,090
Good morning.
Hartford ain't good.

189
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:57,990
Only works when you, when you
get in trouble. Yeah. Like I,

190
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:01,460
I remember one time I got shirtless
and went up and the in the weather and

191
00:11:01,461 --> 00:11:04,130
started saying, there's
thunderstorms. Tom Did DJ.

192
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:05,510
Have you ever seen Mark Norman's?

193
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:08,360
Mark Norman's is great when he just
goes up and she goes, how are you doing?

194
00:11:08,361 --> 00:11:12,260
He goes, kind of gay. Let's get this
started. Hung over horny. Look at you

195
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:16,950
don't, but totally ruined it.
The relationship for the club.

196
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:21,060
Oh, 100% now I went in
there, Tracy Morgan,

197
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,880
Tracy Morgan's was my first
one was fucking legend.

198
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:28,830
That's the one where he talks
to some go get pregnant, pause.

199
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:34,450
That's my mating call.
Dying.

200
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,010
They are dying when he does
that big one in Chicago.

201
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,300
He was in Chicago for sure cause I know
you kept hollering at bulls to have to

202
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:46,060
get him in the middle of it and
squirt it. Come up. Just trashed him.

203
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:50,190
He just crashes. $2 million
Bugatti today. Today. Yup.

204
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:54,220
A Honda sideswiped him.
Whoa. Hell's kitchen.

205
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:55,531
I get here,

206
00:11:55,531 --> 00:12:00,531
I already got hit by mortar truck driving
savage ran into a $2 million Italian

207
00:12:01,391 --> 00:12:02,224
sports car.

208
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:05,710
I saw, I did a show with him
like a year and a half ago.

209
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:10,830
One of the odd ball shows and he came
in a all white Rolls Royce with a

210
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,510
professional like with a driver,

211
00:12:13,511 --> 00:12:18,511
you know like a chauffeur and he came
in all white and had like a fucking

212
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:23,260
enormous gold chain with a medallion TM.
And I was like,

213
00:12:23,261 --> 00:12:26,850
I chant looks crazy. He's like like
600,000 something. Some crazy shit.

214
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:32,680
Look at this. Look at this guy
sideswiped Tracy Morgan's convertible.

215
00:12:32,681 --> 00:12:37,030
$2 million Bugatti. What he's
letting people know. Well

216
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:41,240
what's he the highest?
The Gut in the Honda's defense.

217
00:12:41,241 --> 00:12:45,290
It's a very low car. He has a high car.
He probably looked over, saw nothing.

218
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,710
Fuck no, it was the car that was
like two feet off the ground.

219
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:52,340
It's such a small car. These cars are so
hard to see if you're right next to him.

220
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:54,740
What does that do is
insurance say when he calls,

221
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:59,570
I don't know if we can cover
this like fuck they probably,

222
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:01,730
that'll probably be like the final Straw.

223
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,130
Probably kick them off
the contract for sure.

224
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:06,520
What's that Tracy Morgan
interview that was kind of uh,

225
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:08,990
had to be an inspiration and
doing the Dj dad mouth right.

226
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:11,180
To me that was the first one I
remember like, whoa. I guess.

227
00:13:11,181 --> 00:13:12,210
I mean someone could fuck

228
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:14,530
you can fuck with them in
that way. Yeah. I mean, yeah.

229
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:19,240
I mean it was funny because some people
would be really into having fun with you.

230
00:13:19,241 --> 00:13:20,770
Like the Tracy Morgan people.

231
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:25,150
They laugh and they have a good time and
then some people the neat like I could

232
00:13:25,151 --> 00:13:26,610
see how the club relationship could be,

233
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:31,620
cause we left one of the clubs when I
told him I was coming out as nonbinary and

234
00:13:31,691 --> 00:13:36,160
the lady was like, what? This is like on
the air and I was like different genders.

235
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:40,330
And she was like, all right and she's
turning the TV and she was like, Ugh,

236
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:41,080
she's was,

237
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:46,080
and then she called in like we called the
PR person that drove us to the club or

238
00:13:46,211 --> 00:13:49,420
to the vents and realize
she's in the congress. She
goes, what the fuck was that?

239
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:53,350
She was like, that was, that
guy is so weird. Don't bring
stuff like that in here.

240
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,740
I like, that's the whole point. We
don't want to come in here. They,

241
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:58,820
they think that what
they're doing is serious.

242
00:13:58,821 --> 00:14:03,290
We're providing a wonderful morning
show for downtown Pittsburgh.

243
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,940
You're showing them how to make fucking,

244
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:08,440
I tried to try me
sandwiches so it's so dumb.

245
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,330
What a great sandwich. Hey, thanks a lot.

246
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:14,180
We've got [inaudible]
going to sing for us next.

247
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,400
I tried shitting on the last time I
went to Cleveland. It was the normal,

248
00:14:16,401 --> 00:14:18,890
that's why another relationships
still fine. Um, but I was like,

249
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:20,180
there was a doctor,
but for me, I was like,

250
00:14:20,181 --> 00:14:24,190
why does he wear his fucking doctor
outfit and do this on the way out?

251
00:14:24,191 --> 00:14:27,650
He put a sweater on and left. Why
can't that be him? And it goes like,

252
00:14:27,651 --> 00:14:30,920
I don't know. It's feels like you're
stepping into like Truman show stuff.

253
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:33,360
So contrived. There's nothing
real about, she went there,

254
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:37,400
there's like a 22 year old
PA or associate producer.

255
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:40,460
One time I went in and I said, yeah,
I'm already drunk from doing radio.

256
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:43,040
I can just put the mic on my
necklace. And she goes, why? I go,

257
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:45,800
I'm going to take my shirt off. She goes,
you will not be doing that. And I said,

258
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:49,280
no, you don't tell me what to do. She
was like, excuse me, I'll be right back.

259
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:52,040
And it came back and she goes,
what does in your

260
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:56,030
cup? And I said, whiskey. And
she was like, oh, he's drinking,

261
00:14:56,031 --> 00:14:59,450
he's drinking ace and told on you, oh
my God. And I was just like, I was like,

262
00:14:59,451 --> 00:15:02,390
we should probably leave. So he
just left his left. I was like,

263
00:15:02,391 --> 00:15:03,650
I don't want to get anyone fired.

264
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:07,510
She's telling you you can't take
your shirt off. So their drink. Yeah.

265
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:08,390
Or have a drink.

266
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:10,670
I love how it's like she's telling me
like she found something out. You're like,

267
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:12,350
all right,
I was poor you in front of everybody.

268
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:16,460
I don't want to drag out of the bottle.
She'll, she's at an insurance company.

269
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:19,060
Yeah. It's hilarious. And people
don't know what job they're in.

270
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,280
Tried to take it more seriously.

271
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,950
One of those morning shows fucked
off like the way we're talking about.

272
00:15:22,951 --> 00:15:26,720
It'd be like the best morning show.
So much green had a great, great,

273
00:15:26,721 --> 00:15:29,480
what I remembering now,
back when he was like public access,

274
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:33,080
I was trying to promote the public
access to Tom Green show and he just took

275
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:37,490
over. He did some crazy highs in the face.
Yeah, exactly. Amazing. He's like him.

276
00:15:37,491 --> 00:15:39,200
And then that other dude,
Jamie Kennedy,

277
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:44,120
they did their best shit where they were
like pranking people jackass and then

278
00:15:44,121 --> 00:15:48,770
they just stopped. Yeah, man.
But Tom's blew up so crazy.

279
00:15:48,771 --> 00:15:51,230
So crazy. Tom Green was on. I couldn't,

280
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:56,300
it was stuff I couldn't even
believe green did. Oprah. Wow.

281
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,990
Yes. Oprah was like, we're going
like this. It was such a phenomenal,

282
00:15:59,991 --> 00:16:04,620
what was going on. Show was so big. He
milked that tight with his mouth. Yeah.

283
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:10,150
He puts slept mobile on his dad's calling
parents and then hitting the bushes.

284
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:13,830
He didn't just like, let me fuck this
man of people like my mommy and Daddy.

285
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:17,930
He put forget did people forget Tom
Greene? What happened too, but for now he,

286
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,670
he's fall cancer.
Had to take a break,

287
00:16:19,671 --> 00:16:23,210
came back and tried to do like a
more serious show with a Humperdink.

288
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:26,860
What's this guy's name? But people
forgot how big it used to be. Oh,

289
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:30,560
they may have forgotten how big it was.
What he ended up writing one of the man,

290
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:34,400
what he did was he did what we're
all doing way before any of us,

291
00:16:34,401 --> 00:16:38,140
but it was when bandwidth was too
expensive. He did. He had his own podcast.

292
00:16:38,141 --> 00:16:39,830
Did it? You did. I did it at his house.

293
00:16:39,831 --> 00:16:43,550
It was part of the inspiration for me
doing one. Yeah, and I even talked to his,

294
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:46,700
yes, I even talked to his company.
They were based in Denver.

295
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,530
I was in Denver doing the comedy works.

296
00:16:48,531 --> 00:16:51,560
I talked to the company that was
doing it for him and I was seriously

297
00:16:51,561 --> 00:16:52,940
considering doing something like that,

298
00:16:52,941 --> 00:16:56,750
but the problem was that it like
the bandwidth is crazy expensive.

299
00:16:56,751 --> 00:17:00,680
He had cables running from the desk all
the way through his living room into a

300
00:17:00,681 --> 00:17:04,100
server room. He had a server room
in his house and it was crazy.

301
00:17:04,101 --> 00:17:05,660
I don't know how much
money is involved in this.

302
00:17:05,661 --> 00:17:07,570
He's like a fuck load of
money and he goes like,

303
00:17:07,571 --> 00:17:10,220
I have to have all these people
running it too. That was Tom Greens.

304
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,450
That's me and Tom Green and he so he,

305
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:17,120
what essentially was was he decided
to try to do a talk show host.

306
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:20,120
I remember that Joe Rogan, the fucking
logs sleep under the short sleeve.

307
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:25,520
I left Joe Rogan and am I look for
awhile with the torn jeans you like,

308
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:28,040
I'm not coming here to
Hollywood and given up.

309
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:32,990
That was all based on one
switch he had in his house.

310
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:36,380
I know he just go on and flip a switch
and the show went on and one life.

311
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:40,340
So me and red band looked at it and we're
like well how much is involved in this?

312
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:44,060
Like what would we have to do to do
something like this? And then you know,

313
00:17:44,061 --> 00:17:48,600
eventually it just led to that
and Kumiai Anthony Kumina was,

314
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:52,260
and that was big thing. Yeah. He had that
live from the compound in his basement.

315
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:56,610
And then the way that opie and Anthony
ran their show was an inspiration too

316
00:17:56,611 --> 00:17:59,780
because it was just a hangout and it
was my favorite show to listen to. Yeah.

317
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,370
Cause it's just a bunch of guys
hanging out talking. I was like,

318
00:18:02,371 --> 00:18:05,880
that's like that's what I want to do.
Four hours of them eating oatmeal.

319
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:08,700
I remember they just eat oatmeal
and you'd be like, Oh yeah,

320
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:11,610
I was a big fan back then on
the show that would eat oatmeal.

321
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:16,730
Oh you tune in early on an already there
and they'd just be eating breakfast and

322
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:17,381
just go on.

323
00:18:17,381 --> 00:18:20,520
Jim would take a shit and be gone for
30 minutes because they didn't have any,

324
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:24,510
when they first talked to him,
fat chat nor day back in the day,

325
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:28,080
they didn't have any advertisers,
so they had to fill four hours of content.

326
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,100
So they literally, I mean
everything went. Yeah.

327
00:18:32,101 --> 00:18:35,770
When they first started on Sirius Xm,
they had to fill four hours of content.

328
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:39,380
We had no commercials, no commercials.
That was the pitch crazy. That's serious.

329
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:42,090
Said, hey, we don't have
commercials. You're paid for.

330
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:45,510
He paid for it and then they just started
solid commercials. Like, wait a minute,

331
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:50,510
I fucking paying for this.
And you've got commercials to ask,

332
00:18:50,511 --> 00:18:52,520
is Howard got to get to that paper kid?

333
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:55,590
It's where people are at the helm
of no fucker. Integrity goes down.

334
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:59,250
He gets kicked up sell no matter how.
I mean he's,

335
00:18:59,251 --> 00:19:03,400
he's locked up in a contract for, for
Liz. I've son thought he was done.

336
00:19:03,401 --> 00:19:07,470
So I got to come up. He wants more money
on shore. That's what Howard would do,

337
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:12,300
you know. But he makes up
ass load of money. You know,

338
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:17,460
there's no one even close second
second places. He's just huge.

339
00:19:17,461 --> 00:19:21,450
Like he's a huge shareholder during
that lawsuit too. If we can get over,

340
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,520
let's say the number was
100 million subscribers,

341
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:27,390
I get this gigantic bonus
whether they bought serious,

342
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:31,920
serious and like that took us from 60
plus another 40 is a hundred so I get it

343
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:35,720
[inaudible] we acquired
that pay me mother fuckers.

344
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,060
I don't know what happened with it
but well [inaudible] right there.

345
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:44,310
He's respect you guys are done
with the beef and be with them.

346
00:19:44,311 --> 00:19:47,600
I just think it's should retire.
But the point, the point is what is,

347
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:50,790
he did a good thing for this,
but he basically,

348
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:55,791
what he was saying was that the only
reason that deal took place at all was

349
00:19:55,891 --> 00:20:00,680
because he was a, was it Sirius or
Xm? He was serious. Serious. Right,

350
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:01,770
right,
right.

351
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:05,760
So the only reason why serious was
kicking ass at all was because of Howard

352
00:20:05,761 --> 00:20:08,530
fucking stern period and there was
nothing on Sirius [inaudible] him.

353
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:13,290
He started wired, it wouldn't have
acquired x. Also the model was like,

354
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:16,260
so you know,
suspect at the time you're there,

355
00:20:16,261 --> 00:20:20,130
you're gonna get a terrestrial radio and
go to a place where people have to pay

356
00:20:20,131 --> 00:20:21,750
for what they just turn on deserves it.

357
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,060
Here's why no one else
could have carried that.

358
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:29,100
No one else he was radio
and especially at that time,

359
00:20:29,101 --> 00:20:30,480
during that transition to satellite,

360
00:20:30,481 --> 00:20:34,770
no one else would have got people to
commit to having a fucking satellite dish

361
00:20:34,771 --> 00:20:35,580
in your car.

362
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:38,910
Maybe you had those stupid
fucking antennas that you
said to put on your car to

363
00:20:38,911 --> 00:20:41,430
get to get serious.
The wire went all the way through.

364
00:20:41,431 --> 00:20:46,170
Your car is gross to sue and they would
stick up like a pig tail out of the roof

365
00:20:46,171 --> 00:20:50,800
of your car that she goes. Yeah. Yeah. And
how I would cut out for like every turn,

366
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:53,860
any corner, anytime there was
a building in New York City,

367
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:59,020
any fucking tunnel tunnels dead.
The city that existed it. Yeah,

368
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:02,020
whatever money that country,
that company makes.

369
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:06,850
The only reason it's still or Howard stern
for sure. Only reason. Yeah, for sure.

370
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:08,000
This say no,

371
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:13,420
I had XM and it was until Bennington
and opie and Anthony showed up.

372
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:17,020
It was painful or listen to yacht rock.
Yeah. Oh yeah. It was cool though.

373
00:21:17,021 --> 00:21:19,990
You like nineties rock, three different
channels of a hundred different channels.

374
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:24,070
It was, yeah. It was worth
a dollar a year. Great.

375
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:28,490
Best through. He's been doing on stage
lately. I hated my storytelling show too.

376
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,060
Recently. Did the same thing, just
talking about the good old days,

377
00:21:31,061 --> 00:21:33,610
a fucking drug addiction
of yours to get down.

378
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,760
He describes this city that you're
like, oh my God, I want to be there.

379
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:42,820
Go what year? What first time
in the city? I went, I left.

380
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:45,730
I went there six years. Oh, first time
I've ever been in there. Yeah. Oh,

381
00:21:45,731 --> 00:21:48,910
like do you see times square when
it was time square? But I was like,

382
00:21:48,911 --> 00:21:53,110
what's up when we're wearing
a bra? Just a Bra. My mom,

383
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,560
what they did at Times Square, they turn
times square into like Disney mall is,

384
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:02,080
it's New York's version of
like 12 like Disneyland.

385
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:06,070
It's disgusting and it's a
nightmare whenever you're visiting.

386
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,710
And also like when you're visiting,
you're in a car,

387
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:12,010
you don't need to go to this and all of
a sudden you look up and you're like, oh,

388
00:22:12,011 --> 00:22:14,440
we can fucking time. Like you're
just driving through it. I'm like,

389
00:22:14,441 --> 00:22:17,950
we gotta get Outta here man. Like
the chaos, the, and it's just like,

390
00:22:17,951 --> 00:22:22,300
it's too commercialized. No commercial,
no reason. It feels like you're, yeah,

391
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:25,230
everything that makes New York
amazing is like gone. God,

392
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,760
you're gonna just do a funny joke about
it with your coat for a meeting and then

393
00:22:27,761 --> 00:22:30,250
like you're walking in and people just
looking up and he's like, why is that?

394
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:35,030
What gonna fuck yeah. Who says that? Jim
Gaffigan. Oh, that's funny. That's funny.

395
00:22:35,031 --> 00:22:38,980
Yeah. Well it's like
a, it's very Vegas ask.

396
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,320
It's like walking down the strip.
Yes it is.

397
00:22:41,321 --> 00:22:45,610
It's like are the lights and the total
control? It's fake. There's no M and. M's.

398
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,660
That's not where it was invented.

399
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:50,110
So why is a giant m and m store and when
you knew used to know what it was like

400
00:22:50,111 --> 00:22:54,700
with like peep shows and xxx everywhere.
And it was, it was seedy and weird,

401
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:58,540
but every dangerous, it was dangerous,
like legitimately dangerous.

402
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:01,150
[inaudible] I mean the worst time what?
Seventies eighties right.

403
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:04,360
That was like the worst crime time,
late seventies into the,

404
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:09,160
to the mid to late eighties I was hanging
out in New York in the 80s when I was,

405
00:23:09,161 --> 00:23:13,720
that was my pool hustling days and uh,
I was doing a lot of gigs.

406
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:19,240
I guess it wasn't the 80s it
was the nineties the early
nineties cause by 91 was

407
00:23:19,241 --> 00:23:20,890
I think the first time I
ever performed in New York.

408
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,760
91 or maybe 90 of them really? Well, this
is like, you're just starting out though,

409
00:23:24,761 --> 00:23:26,980
kind of. You are going to
Amsterdam barriers then. Yes.

410
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,930
What was this Chelsea Chelsea billiards.
Chelsea handler's.

411
00:23:29,931 --> 00:23:33,160
There was where we would go to Amsterdam,
but Amsterdam is on the west side.

412
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:35,170
Back then it was on ams moved.

413
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:38,260
That's why it was called Amsterdam
Pemex since it was on the west side.

414
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:40,840
It was an awesome place, I call it.
That's why I became friends with Don.

415
00:23:40,841 --> 00:23:44,350
My rera played pool with him in
[inaudible] 94 at Amsterdam billiards.

416
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,940
I didn't know he like when I,
when meet a pool player,

417
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:50,390
like a comical actually plays like
dom could play. He called me today.

418
00:23:50,391 --> 00:23:54,580
I can't wait. I'm going to back off
that guy. I love him so much. But uh,

419
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:56,210
New York was a different place,
man.

420
00:23:56,211 --> 00:24:00,350
I was around a lot of these like Weirdo
homeless, grifter type characters.

421
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:03,650
A lot of due to get arrested
for doing three card Monte.

422
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:08,570
Like the pool hall was the best
education of like street culture.

423
00:24:08,571 --> 00:24:11,090
Like people who live on the street,
I mean home people,

424
00:24:11,091 --> 00:24:13,550
people were basically homeless.
Like sometimes it's still here.

425
00:24:13,551 --> 00:24:16,610
They're like my friend Johnny was
always like staying in people's,

426
00:24:16,611 --> 00:24:17,660
hey stayed at my house for,

427
00:24:17,661 --> 00:24:22,250
sometimes he would stay in these weird
little hostels and flop houses in New

428
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:24,710
York and places that didn't have a roof.
Like you have walls,

429
00:24:24,711 --> 00:24:27,090
but there would be like no rules.
So like everybody can hear everybody.

430
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:29,540
Remember as a kid in that era,

431
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:34,120
the perception that you had of New York
is like, this is nothing but crime. Right?

432
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:37,600
Like they say, it's dangerous. You're
not allowed. Giuliani, you know,

433
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,270
clamped down on all that shit.
Yeah.

434
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:42,240
I remember when I moved and I,
I found a place,

435
00:24:42,241 --> 00:24:44,610
I came back to get my stuff and
I told Neil Brennan, I was like,

436
00:24:44,611 --> 00:24:46,770
I don't think they have bars in my back
window door and need that. It goes,

437
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:49,320
I'll do read the crime stats.
It's a different city though.

438
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:54,330
It's just not that city anymore. Yeah, it
was sitting in the war was already safe.

439
00:24:54,331 --> 00:24:57,420
That was, I mean, I
don't remember any crime,

440
00:24:57,421 --> 00:25:00,390
which although I did get taken and
three card Monte a number of times,

441
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:04,950
but they didn't force you use all three
card money. You know my brain, I'm like,

442
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:09,570
I fucking got this fucking put money
down. Larry is too high. So that,

443
00:25:09,571 --> 00:25:12,810
and they used to have this game where
they had a a nail in a piece of board and

444
00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:16,200
yet a hammer and you had three shots to
get the nail in that they had that in

445
00:25:16,201 --> 00:25:19,080
Thailand. Dude, I do that
over every fucking time.

446
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:21,250
There was so much so hard.

447
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:25,050
There's so many hustlers right
back in those days in New York.

448
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:28,750
So many people trying to get
off some kind of scam. Yeah,

449
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:32,820
I guess I've been scammed by a driver
in New York. How, what? It's like,

450
00:25:32,821 --> 00:25:35,730
this was not even that long ago.
I mean it was probably like seven,

451
00:25:35,731 --> 00:25:38,820
eight years where no, like you get
in the cab and you're like, you know,

452
00:25:38,821 --> 00:25:41,490
if you don't live there but you kind of
know like the layout, you're just like,

453
00:25:41,491 --> 00:25:46,080
basically I want to go up, uh, you
know, 20 blocks this way. Right.

454
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:51,350
And the guy just goes across town and
starts going up like the opposite highway,

455
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:55,770
like one where we were, I'm like,
which, what are we doing exactly?

456
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,990
There's already that you can
track yourself on your phone.

457
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:01,350
Just looking at it like what are we doing?
And he's like going up to the, I go,

458
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:04,530
couldn't you have just gone up that
avenue that we were on? And he was like,

459
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:08,010
I don't know what's going
on man. I'm like, I go, well
this is fucking outrageous.

460
00:26:08,011 --> 00:26:11,760
And then we pull up, I see like the meter
go and go and I'm like, this is crazy.

461
00:26:11,761 --> 00:26:15,780
That was supposed to be a a 10 minute
drive and it's taken 40 minutes. He goes,

462
00:26:15,781 --> 00:26:19,510
just pay me what you ever, you want
to pay me what? Yeah. And I go, okay.

463
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,950
Because he didn't want to get
caught. Yeah. And I go, okay, that,

464
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:26,610
so I go like the things had like $68 and
I was like, here's 20 bucks. He's like,

465
00:26:26,611 --> 00:26:31,350
that's it. I gotta use my pace, but
I want to pay so I'll see you man.

466
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:36,490
Yeah, I bet it was. He was totally cool
with it. Yeah, because he scared me. Yeah,

467
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:40,890
yeah, yeah. I did that Israel wants in
Jerusalem. When I got there, I took a,

468
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:44,100
I was like, take me to belay
Brock. And it was, I didn't

469
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:47,770
realize I was three blocks over.
He could, he just told me like, oh,

470
00:26:47,771 --> 00:26:50,920
that's right there dude. But it took
me around the city and then let me off.

471
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:55,180
And then when I wanted to
go home afterwards, I was
like, what? You right here?

472
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:59,640
Find out. Yeah. That's how you find out
that out on my way on that cab ride,

473
00:26:59,641 --> 00:27:02,400
because I started texting people
at the next place. I was like,

474
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:04,890
I was just leaving here
and I'm going to see you.

475
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:09,870
Should I be on the fucking
passport? And they were like, no.

476
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:14,200
So you didn't speak Spanish in that
moment. He was a rush from that.

477
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:16,680
I would've taken, I would've taken,
I would've gone right to Spanish,

478
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:21,830
got into a language that makes me feel
powerful. Nigerian pocketed it and uh,

479
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:25,430
in Florence and I went into Russian,
everything, every word I knew in Russia,

480
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,870
my yelled at the guy and he ran because
he was like, I don't know what I'm doing.

481
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:31,350
Like Russians are fucking
animals. She yelled out, America,

482
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:33,410
you fucking trader Shitty,

483
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:37,320
yelled out America and take your fucking
shirt off and said, I'm the machine.

484
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:41,180
And started running after her mother
fucker one my wife yells up by me,

485
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:41,761
he's scared.

486
00:27:41,761 --> 00:27:46,761
More scared of you than [inaudible].

487
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:52,080
Ah, I should write that
down. Write that down.

488
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:55,110
You should write that whole thing down
about you talking about on the radio.

489
00:27:55,111 --> 00:27:56,070
That is hilarious.

490
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:59,610
And then went downstairs then because the
audience is going to be like, so wait,

491
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:00,390
what do you do?

492
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:04,290
Then you pull out coke and you do a
bunk [inaudible] everybody and then you

493
00:28:04,291 --> 00:28:07,020
start making no sense and then
the blood comes out of your nose.

494
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:09,060
It's an awesome show. Yeah.
You could do math if you want.

495
00:28:09,061 --> 00:28:10,290
If you don't want to
do the coke that night,

496
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:14,880
you take your high blood pressure
medication on stage. That crowd. Yeah,

497
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,030
I would.
I would love to know what I'd love to met.

498
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:20,130
Start growing this cocoa plants.
The kind where you just chew the leaves.

499
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:24,930
You can grow them here. Climate
suitable. You can get there. Yeah,

500
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:30,780
you could. You could organize a
closet with some heat lamps and shit.

501
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:34,800
Do you think so? Yeah, for sure. And I
just have just to like chew a little bit.

502
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:35,943
Well,

503
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:40,380
let's find out how many people are growing
their own cocoa leaves in the United

504
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:43,100
States. I don't think I ever want to
walk you hot. Why wouldn't you have?

505
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:47,260
I would love to so much of it.
That's why those female cocaine,

506
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:50,750
Peruvian leaves, those just want
to be like one of those bears.

507
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,990
I would love to talk to Aubrey Marcus.
It's the crazy happened.

508
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:58,470
You chew those leaves.
It's actually not bad for you at all.

509
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:02,910
And the team coca tea is great. I've had
that. Yeah, that'll Seattle. Your nausea.

510
00:29:02,911 --> 00:29:04,980
You know what can we especially
you get to like, I'm serious.

511
00:29:04,981 --> 00:29:08,610
Like everyone starts drinking it. You
still have to sign me up. It's great.

512
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:12,870
Isn't it crazy that everybody just thinks
that this one thing as the processed

513
00:29:12,871 --> 00:29:17,871
chemicalized fucking version
that Scarface and clocked me.

514
00:29:18,811 --> 00:29:23,340
How many people have died
because of cocaine? Oh my God.
Oh Lord. How many murders?

515
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:28,080
Is there another drug on the planet that
is inspired more murders than cocaine?

516
00:29:28,081 --> 00:29:29,330
Yeah, right. I would,

517
00:29:29,331 --> 00:29:32,940
I would love to know murderers versus
number of Dick sucked for it. Oh,

518
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:35,500
that'd be so funny
man.

519
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:38,670
If everybody got murdered every
time they did coke, they don't.

520
00:29:38,671 --> 00:29:42,040
But a lot of people get
their dicks poke like

521
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:45,220
[inaudible] might not be everybody,
but it's like 30% so the name,

522
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,860
cause girls can't afford coke too.

523
00:29:47,861 --> 00:29:51,370
If they're young and they're partying
and they're out and in some fucking guy

524
00:29:51,371 --> 00:29:54,040
comes along with a fat Tracy
Morgan like gold chain.

525
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,900
That's how good coke is though.
Yeah. That's how good it is. Right?

526
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:01,480
That that people are like for
sure I'll just blow this stranger.

527
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:06,010
Oh yeah I have that. I knew a guy. So
who would get coke that didn't do coke?

528
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:08,080
They would get coke
just so they have coke.

529
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:11,770
So how it around for those whore women
if girls want to co cause some girls when

530
00:30:11,771 --> 00:30:14,830
they want coke [inaudible] I am calling
somebody and I'm going to get some

531
00:30:14,831 --> 00:30:18,280
fucking coke and I'm gonna leave here.
Hold on, hold on. We got some coke.

532
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:20,660
So though she knows a guy
damn orgy going on. Why?

533
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:24,730
Some of it's just girls are like,
oh I know my blow job is worth stuff,

534
00:30:24,731 --> 00:30:26,650
so what can I get out of it?
What am I looking for?

535
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:30,530
My brother in law told me that he went
to Woodstock too, you know, like what,

536
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:31,890
20 years ago, whatever it was. Yeah.

537
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,930
Had he said this guy got one of
his friends got of a long line,

538
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,450
this is an orthodox Jew,
kind of a long line with a bunch of food.

539
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:39,970
Like it took forever to get
through concessions and she goes,

540
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:42,420
look at my waiting in a line. I'll blow
you for that food. And you go, yeah, sure,

541
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:46,750
let's do it. Wow. Absolutely
sucked his dick for food. Food.

542
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:51,830
That's like your chips. She got
a little extra protein. Wow. Wow.

543
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:53,200
We had a,
uh,

544
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:58,450
be real from Cypress Hill and he was
showing us the footage of him on stage

545
00:30:58,451 --> 00:31:02,380
crowd surfing. He was onstage
in front of, in Woodstock,

546
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:04,870
half a million people in
the fucking crowd and then,

547
00:31:04,871 --> 00:31:07,930
and then goes out into the crowd,
crowd surf and they stole a sneakers.

548
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:12,580
They took his sneakers and uh, both
people both left and the right sneaker.

549
00:31:12,581 --> 00:31:15,700
They came to the, one of his shows
and he signed it in the future.

550
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:19,660
Your shoe from Woodstock, we sign it.
It's like, fuck. Yeah. And he signed.

551
00:31:19,661 --> 00:31:20,790
That's crazy.
That's wow.

552
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:25,360
It's the video of him on stage in front
of half a million people. It is insane.

553
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:26,410
I love how they,

554
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:30,700
the Sandra's house have not
wavered at all from their day one.

555
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:33,380
Not like we smoke this shit all day too.

556
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:37,540
Like if you open their Instagram right
now it's just like check it out. Yeah.

557
00:31:37,541 --> 00:31:40,770
Fucking 30 years deep into this shit.
Like they don't fuck around at all.

558
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:42,670
Cypress hills,
Instagram,

559
00:31:42,671 --> 00:31:46,270
like half of it is we'd videos with like
Cypress Hill music in the background.

560
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:52,150
It's just videos of people doing wax and
Dabs and bong hits with Cypress Hill in

561
00:31:52,151 --> 00:31:54,370
the back of the first album is so good.
So good.

562
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:58,120
They get high the way we get high. But
you and I know they do. I went with them.

563
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:01,900
They get way higher than that but I'm
saying do they like, are they out of it?

564
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,700
No Man, look, he's fine.

565
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,450
He's got that show called the smoke box.

566
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:10,900
You can see the car get a car by the way.
Can I just say,

567
00:32:10,901 --> 00:32:13,990
I thought you would all Chinese Guy
Barbecue. That wasn't even there.

568
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:17,550
Are you serious? In another
dimension? Yeah. To be,

569
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:20,620
to just have a pass us a picture of you
and it looked like you were, I was like,

570
00:32:20,621 --> 00:32:25,060
oh, he smoked so much before we
ever got in the car. I was like,

571
00:32:25,061 --> 00:32:27,820
I can't believe we're going to keep
going. And he's like totally normal. Oh,

572
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:32,030
it's normal as could be. That's
guys, professional stoner sen dog.

573
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:37,330
They're just fine. Yup. That's not
me. That's me with booze though. Yeah,

574
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,070
I could definitely, I could definitely
probably like I was, I was trying

575
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:44,030
to think of like the celebrity I could
go beard a beer for and then really hurt

576
00:32:44,031 --> 00:32:48,530
them. Most of them. Most Post Malone Post
Malone and then you can take them down.

577
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:49,483
Dude,

578
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:55,430
who do you think he's a young guy with
scribbles on his face. He's an awesome,

579
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:59,570
he's a great fucking
musician. Musicians. Awesome.

580
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:02,120
His tattoos requesting a,
they're odd.

581
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:06,650
What is a who taught choices
really fucking take it down. Yeah.

582
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:10,330
You know what I mean? Like drink heavily.
And I think if you, and now this is,

583
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:11,210
I've thought about this a lot,

584
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:15,530
if I go for their cocktail and I got to
match them cocktail the cocktail, um,

585
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:20,560
I can keep pace with Stan hope. Uh,
that's a big one. Key of stand up. Jesus.

586
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:25,070
Stand up. Doesn't drink as
much as everyone thinks he
just drinks every day. Yeah.

587
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:29,830
Like, like, yeah. Like he's not like
a lot of it's left to right. Yeah.

588
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:32,360
Thanks a lot of light beer.
Oddly enough.

589
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:36,380
A lot healthier than I think people
assume Ron white would be a tough one.

590
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:40,880
Oh yeah. Wrong white, white goes. He
gets fucked up every night of the week.

591
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:44,890
That's possible. Like every night
of the week. Every, not every,

592
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:49,330
not every night. It's all know
how to do. Damn. But he's,

593
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:53,720
it looks like $1 million and
he did 10 years ago. Happy man.

594
00:33:53,721 --> 00:33:57,560
I'll tell you that. That's a happy dude.
He looks great. Yeah. He's 38 years old.

595
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:07,520
So boys were brought here for a reason,
not just to talk shit.

596
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:12,830
Jesus. We're trying to figure out,
um, how to do sober October this year.

597
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:14,990
What are we going to do of October?

598
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:19,220
I will already have the answer and I
think it's early for me to say it now,

599
00:34:19,221 --> 00:34:22,760
so I'll wait until the end. Oh, you sound
sounded. You have your, your thought.

600
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,130
I know exactly what we're
doing. Okay, so this,

601
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:28,760
just tell her this happening though.
Gloats over.

602
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:32,160
Tom's got an aggressive schedule. I
think we should go. No coffee. Okay.

603
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:35,990
Really stepping up.
Stop Sobriety.

604
00:34:35,991 --> 00:34:40,970
But if I were with us on a coffee because
I think we should make it harder. Like,

605
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,680
no, no booze, no alcohol season.
No coffee is on thick. Ooh,

606
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:49,940
no water. It's Tom Sober sober. You're on
a mild stimulant. I think it's cheating.

607
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,600
I think we should go. No coffee. I
like no coffee. I like no coughing,

608
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,300
no coffee on wait, wait, wait.

609
00:34:54,301 --> 00:34:57,740
Should we realize you can only drink water
the whole month? She no other drinks.

610
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:00,890
I'm fucking in no other drink.
Sparkling water.

611
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:06,890
Bob Brown. Come on. Carbonated
water. It's just water.

612
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:12,320
No, that works. I like where you, Oh,
I'm ramping up. I'm ready to go to war.

613
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:16,910
Wait only water and carbonated water.
Yep. I'll do that. I'll do that.

614
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:21,140
I'll do that. Oh, so no coffee. So what
do you wouldn't have milk in their coffee.

615
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:25,880
Wow. Yeah. We should go
carnivore diet all month.

616
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:29,810
Nothing but Ribeye steaks.
All right. Relax. Why not?

617
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:32,070
Because you're going to get
that fucking [inaudible].

618
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:35,120
I'm willing to negotiate and I'm willing
to negotiate with what I think our

619
00:35:35,121 --> 00:35:38,500
challenge should be for what
you think our should be. Well,

620
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:39,720
what do you think the challenge would be?

621
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:44,810
I know I have an idea of a challenge
to be [inaudible] is about health,

622
00:35:44,971 --> 00:35:48,780
right? Yes. Yeah. Health. It's
not, what do you want it to be?

623
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:52,890
I think it should be, if mental health
is a, is a legit part of health,

624
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:58,230
you should give up your fucking dopamine
fucking addictions and get rid of cell

625
00:35:58,231 --> 00:36:00,750
phones. Yeah. Get rid of your cell
phones in your social media for a month.

626
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:04,350
I get your, uh, I get why you
wouldn't do it. Cause your career.

627
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:08,070
You can email your fucking ladies
to fucking post shit for you ladies.

628
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:11,700
Enjoy social media. Yeah,
I know. Oh, it's boots

629
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:18,510
enjoying it. I think you have a good
point with this. I do. I really do.

630
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,200
I think about you sometimes when I,

631
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:24,210
when I feel like I've been on like a
flight or in a hotel room and I'm like,

632
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,300
I think I've been looking at my phone for
like three hours thinking about having

633
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:30,650
gone out. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just being
like, just think it takes the, the um,

634
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:32,340
the connective tissue away from this,

635
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,610
this challenge to the people that
enjoy watching this challenge.

636
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:39,240
I think a lot of people enjoy that will
be, that will be a problem. I mean,

637
00:36:39,241 --> 00:36:41,820
I'm going to be able to join in
with those. The Rock. Let's do it.

638
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:45,330
And then November 1st everyone's like,
oh yeah, you guys did sober October.

639
00:36:45,331 --> 00:36:48,770
I forgot about that. I could get
each of you and I'll could tell. No,

640
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,371
I understand.

641
00:36:50,371 --> 00:36:53,520
I'm not like Joe who says do what I do
and then I'll just fucking have an easy

642
00:36:53,521 --> 00:36:57,560
time of it. I will go with no cell phones.
I will do beyond what I already do.

643
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:01,550
Let's, let's, let's, you didn't do
what you guys did though, eating,

644
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:05,840
doing yoga down to join us.

645
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:11,410
That was [inaudible] I'm saying it wasn't
a challenge in that like there was no

646
00:37:14,101 --> 00:37:19,020
contest. If it was, I had to do
a yoga the most like I do it.

647
00:37:19,021 --> 00:37:22,020
Right, right, right, right,
right. That's it. That's it.

648
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:24,440
Maybe it's the most 90 minute yoga class

649
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:28,500
showing that

650
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:35,570
most elks tend to go to war or kills
the most Alex and can reverse to Garcia

651
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:38,920
here. His mental health.
It's a good point. We, uh,

652
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:41,870
we definitely look at these
fucking things. You can also get a,

653
00:37:41,871 --> 00:37:45,210
like a legit real camera
if you wanted film stuff,

654
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:49,350
give it to your fucking assistance that
you could have the post to figure this

655
00:37:49,351 --> 00:37:52,530
out and post whatever you need to
be. How about this? How about this?

656
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:57,480
We run the most miles in a month.

657
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:03,480
Track it track.
Let me just go for my baseline right now.

658
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:07,380
How many miles a month to run right now?
It's up there, man. Okay. What about you?

659
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:11,370
Bart
has to be real running.

660
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:15,240
I wanted it on the glass. I don't want
that bullshit on a fucking treadmill.

661
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:20,800
Running shoes with a Bluetooth capability
in them will wear the wrong shoes.

662
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:25,200
So we're going to listen.
We're gonna run from miles,

663
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:29,850
but it's not fair because already
doing, I'm only running hills, man. Oh,

664
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:34,020
how many of them when you go for a
run now, it's no more than an hour,

665
00:38:34,021 --> 00:38:36,050
hour and 15 minutes. Same. Same

666
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:40,540
number. That same marathon right
there? No, no. Up Hills. Up Hills.

667
00:38:40,541 --> 00:38:44,740
He's probably running six miles.
I'm running some steep shit.

668
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:48,640
It's more like, it's,
it's more a sprinting.

669
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
It's like there's a lot of plyometrics.
It's more like that. Like you're, you're,

670
00:38:52,001 --> 00:38:55,690
you're not just flat running at
a steady pace. So do you sprint,

671
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:59,310
run out chasing my dog too. We're having,
I'm trying to make it hard. I mean,

672
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:02,290
I pretend things to chase in me. I played
a little bit and games in my head. Yeah,

673
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:05,540
that's nice. That pretend to have to get
to the top where everyone and no dyes.

674
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:07,330
Yeah,
you're good at this shit.

675
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:11,150
Give me a hint. Whatever you got in
your brain, give it to me a little bit.

676
00:39:11,151 --> 00:39:11,750
When I work

677
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:14,360
you don't want it. Um, cause it ramps up,

678
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:19,250
ramps up that's ready to go and
listen. Crazy. We were going guys,

679
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,310
we were working at like six, seven
hours a day. It was terrible man.

680
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:25,580
But the whole time I was like,
man, I do zero working out.

681
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:30,560
So this is called [inaudible].
Great. All right. When you were here,

682
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,690
when we were like three weeks
into the month and you were here,

683
00:39:32,691 --> 00:39:35,090
we did a podcast together
and use my fucking rower.

684
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:39,080
You did an hour on the rower and you
were ripped. Do you have a six pack?

685
00:39:39,081 --> 00:39:41,450
I was like, look at this mother fucker.
I know. It was pretty impressive.

686
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:45,290
An hour on the rower is real work.
That's real work.

687
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:49,350
You are not going to not get second
or was not gonna not go last.

688
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,233
That's why would you not want it?

689
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,670
Here's what I, here's what I,
here's what I'm hearing already.

690
00:39:52,671 --> 00:39:56,120
Wants to do a challenge that he already
excels at. I get it. No, no, no.

691
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:00,220
But you're already off and you're
complaining about Joe. Is that he is,

692
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:04,930
is that he keeps logging in things
that he is good at. So yeah,

693
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:10,070
I will take care of this
since you gentlemen, are you
ready? Oh Sir. This year,

694
00:40:10,071 --> 00:40:11,090
sober October.

695
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:14,480
Physical challenge like you're presenting
it like presidential candidate.

696
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:19,840
It's like an apple when it's going
to be good hip hop dance hip hop in.

697
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:25,070
Joe, hear me out. Just hear me out. Hear
me out and spin. Let me soft sell you.

698
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:26,180
Let me stop.
[inaudible] okay.

699
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:30,830
We each get a choreographer and we
work dance classes as much as we can.

700
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:33,890
Dance classes are pretty aggressive.
We leave it to the audience to vote here.

701
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:37,160
Listen, hear me out when I'm sorry. When
I liked that idea Joe. We can do that now.

702
00:40:37,161 --> 00:40:40,880
Hear me out. Starting with each my 1st of
October. That's what you do on a pitch.

703
00:40:40,881 --> 00:40:42,880
You make them think it was their
idea. Yeah, we got this right.

704
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:47,120
I want you to look over at that belt.
You'd never getting that but hold on.

705
00:40:47,121 --> 00:40:50,060
Hold on one second. Hear me guys. Hear
me out. Everyone listen to me. Yeah,

706
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:51,140
you should watch out for this

707
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,240
shit.
Is putting the fuck his belt on.

708
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:04,310
Oh, okay. All right. I haven't even
touched this thing since October.

709
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,330
Same as me with any
sort of rough belt man.

710
00:41:08,331 --> 00:41:10,850
We each got to go to dance
classes to get our skill set up.

711
00:41:10,851 --> 00:41:14,720
We each worked with a choreographer to
create our own dance to the exact same

712
00:41:14,721 --> 00:41:19,040
song. Let me know when you're done at the
end. At the end, at the end. By the way,

713
00:41:19,041 --> 00:41:23,560
I'm selling this to the
room, like threading that
through your genes get popped,

714
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:29,010
like snaps in the bag at
the snaps at the end of the,

715
00:41:29,211 --> 00:41:33,620
I have a hard time putting belts on too.
If at the of the month

716
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:38,300
come November 1st, we each submit our
one minute hip hop dance choreography,

717
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:42,770
choreography video and the fans vote
on who the winner of sober October is.

718
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:46,400
Gentlemen, I would like to hear your
bottles starting with Thomson [inaudible].

719
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:51,320
I gotta tell you are watching this,
the rebuttals punc holes in it.

720
00:41:51,321 --> 00:41:53,420
You put, you put, you sort of mentioned
that. Here's what I'll tell you.

721
00:41:53,421 --> 00:41:57,680
What I like about it is easy to say what
I don't like about anything that comes

722
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:58,490
out of your mouth.

723
00:41:58,490 --> 00:42:03,490
So what I don't like about it or what I
do like about it is that no one's great

724
00:42:03,891 --> 00:42:07,910
at it. I do like that it
is a workout because those,

725
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:11,840
those dancers are unbelievable.
I'm one dancer right now.

726
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:16,030
Me obviously first Joe seconds,
not even close.

727
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:18,820
What are you talking about?
It's definitely me. What?

728
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:21,680
I'm way better dancer than you
guys out of your fucking mind.

729
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:26,290
Just cause you see Spanish doesn't mean
you're a better. Do you like to dance? No,

730
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,560
but I know I'm better dancer
than you guys. First of all,

731
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:34,560
I want to fucking
listen.

732
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:38,420
I could do a lot of crazy shit with my
body. You guys can't do and that's true,

733
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:42,980
but I'm saying rhythm to them.
You have rhythm.

734
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:47,330
Yes. All right. Wait, hold on.
You have rhythm. I know I do.

735
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:50,360
I'm fucking phenomenal at dancing.

736
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:53,720
Well here's okay,

737
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:58,520
but know what I'm saying is that nobody
Xcels I mean obviously I'm better than

738
00:42:58,521 --> 00:43:03,260
you, but nobody excels. So I like the idea
of working at something that, you know,

739
00:43:03,261 --> 00:43:07,400
no one's great at and all this meat
dancing. Oh, that's right. Yeah. So movie.

740
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:11,990
I was in the movie zoo keeper. Yeah. I, I,
I took dance classes. Oh, all right. Uh,

741
00:43:11,991 --> 00:43:14,080
dance my ass off bitch.
I love problem movies.

742
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:17,540
Make it seem normal that that
guy could get back. Girl. I know.

743
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:22,150
Ever so often. You, oh wait, hold
on, hold on. Let's see Joe. Okay.

744
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:25,640
Like legitimately,
I mean I'm not good anything.

745
00:43:25,641 --> 00:43:28,450
So this is hip hop dance we're
talking about. Look at his face. Yeah,

746
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:31,430
it's intense dance.
Come on son

747
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:36,770
S. Oh yeah, you did pretty
good there. Actually.

748
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:40,040
I took fucking dance lessons.
I didn't do it for weeks.

749
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:44,650
So you're dancing with Nikki Glaser?
Leslie Bibb. Oh, she's from uh,

750
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:48,500
Talladega nights. Yeah, she's great.
She's great. Very, very funny person too.

751
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:53,120
I think that sounds like a done deal.
And else have any, here's the last thing,

752
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:56,540
the last thing. That is great. Okay.
So everybody gets to work at it.

753
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,280
Nobody excels too much at it.

754
00:43:58,790 --> 00:44:03,710
I think it's funny that we're comics and
we get to look silly doing something.

755
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:07,430
Yeah, I could not look great
at it and I'm on board with,

756
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:11,420
I think it's fun that people that watch
that or get really into it would have a

757
00:44:11,421 --> 00:44:15,140
say in it. I'm the only one of the
three of us. There's not obese,

758
00:44:15,141 --> 00:44:18,030
so it would look the least
silly for me to doing it.

759
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:22,710
You're calling Joe fat medically
obese, so I think that's, sorry,

760
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:26,380
I'm about to be on my son.
Yeah, it's all about the BMI.

761
00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:29,210
BMI is off the chart as you're
saying that you are into it or not.

762
00:44:29,870 --> 00:44:31,710
I would look at least silly
just in terms of that,

763
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:34,830
but you guys, I get why you look
silly. Just moving at all. Mm,

764
00:44:34,910 --> 00:44:38,050
well you also need these silly,
yeah, I'm not a fucking fat,

765
00:44:38,051 --> 00:44:40,770
but you don't make yourself always,
you're always breaking.

766
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:45,210
Break yourself before you break ankles
and elbows and shit owns breaking through

767
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:49,650
and breaking stuff. That's super fucking
vulnerable. I am. It's a good point.

768
00:44:49,651 --> 00:44:52,260
What about injury? What's intriguing
not do at this point? No, no, no.

769
00:44:52,350 --> 00:44:54,510
Dance classes are intense.

770
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:56,610
Do you really think you the
current best answer easily.

771
00:44:56,750 --> 00:45:01,320
I think bars most I the most
out of all of us. I agree.

772
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:03,600
And so the dance classes are taught,

773
00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:07,110
we get each get ourselves choreographers
and we create our own dance to the

774
00:45:07,111 --> 00:45:10,410
exact song hypes up. Wait for
me to talk about this. Okay,

775
00:45:10,411 --> 00:45:13,650
but the amount of Molly I would have
to do to, to enjoy that dancing,

776
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,480
but you can't be sober.
Can't be solid,

777
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:17,710
but you can't November 1st
is that when we posted it,

778
00:45:17,711 --> 00:45:20,710
you can be ideas that dance
partner dancing, sober,

779
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:25,830
sober fencing. Strober here's, here's
problems with it. I'll never want,

780
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:28,750
it's subjective. You can't have
something subjective you can't have.

781
00:45:28,751 --> 00:45:31,560
So the other thing to him dance better.
We to think over dance better.

782
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:35,250
You can't have a bunch of morons vote for
it. Okay, let me, let me break this down.

783
00:45:36,090 --> 00:45:38,430
Finish up. I'm going to
write to what if, what if?

784
00:45:39,450 --> 00:45:42,590
What if the dance pros got together?
That's what I was sec.

785
00:45:42,870 --> 00:45:45,550
Perfect professionals
judge. Well yeah, they're,

786
00:45:45,551 --> 00:45:49,500
they're out there and they like
Burt better. They like me better.

787
00:45:49,501 --> 00:45:54,080
You don't want that. No. Judges choose it.

788
00:45:54,230 --> 00:45:59,230
The most corrupt people that all sports
[inaudible] they literally go to jail,

789
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:04,680
but so we have to upgrade O'Brian
and Olympic judges. No, no.

790
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:09,130
Nothing subjective.
We gotta grind dances.

791
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:13,800
We got up. We got to make it uncomfortable
there. Make it super uncomfortable.

792
00:46:13,830 --> 00:46:16,770
Do you want to make her comfortable,
comfortable hands classes? It's all right.

793
00:46:17,830 --> 00:46:20,840
Teen dance, dance classes.
Hip Hop does something.

794
00:46:20,841 --> 00:46:24,390
It's something about the fitness
challenges that are more exciting to me.

795
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:28,260
Cause this daily fitness all the
time and wonder what that is.

796
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:32,700
I'll do something that you guys don't do
a fitness challenge you guys don't do.

797
00:46:33,050 --> 00:46:35,250
Yup or that I don't do.
Rather than write that. Okay,

798
00:46:35,251 --> 00:46:38,820
that's you're trying to say that
I don't ever do, I'll ride bikes.

799
00:46:38,821 --> 00:46:43,020
I'm gonna give a fuck.
Bikes,

800
00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:46,740
bikes everywhere, right by
store. Accessible ride bikes.

801
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:51,490
But Tom's in Europe ride a bike pitch as
you go to your ride bikes over there in

802
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,040
Europe in October for a
lot of those countries.

803
00:46:53,041 --> 00:46:57,990
Are the scheduled in Australia sort
of cancel yet. It's coming up. Oh,

804
00:46:57,991 --> 00:47:01,800
come on. I'll take a sip. When do
you cancel it? I can't sell clothes.

805
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:06,870
Why are you gonna cancel it?
I've canceled before. Just once.

806
00:47:06,871 --> 00:47:11,830
I think it was Dwight. Couple of
times you get sick. Australia.

807
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:14,790
The only time he's been to Australia
was opening for you with UFC ticket.

808
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:19,020
When also at another time I went, I did
the Melbourne festival. Yeah. Yeah. Hey,

809
00:47:19,021 --> 00:47:23,730
I'm in Oakland. June 5th takes this
Sydney June 20th give out dates.

810
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:26,340
Oh, that's all right. I'll be in Columbus.

811
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:32,110
I know there's a bunch people that
are doing, we will [inaudible].

812
00:47:32,190 --> 00:47:35,980
We want to be able to vote well then
not gonna water. No one's stealing this.

813
00:47:36,130 --> 00:47:38,830
You're going to have to earn this
motherfucker. So you're saying this,

814
00:47:38,831 --> 00:47:43,420
you're thinking this hip hop has,
this is mine. This is mine. I like it.

815
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:47,050
I like it. I'm going to keep it. I'm
going to keep this. This is mine.

816
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:52,300
The flaw he saying is that there's not
like a clear right that it's, yeah,

817
00:47:52,301 --> 00:47:55,180
you can't leave it in the hands of
the judges. Get the fuck Outta here.

818
00:47:55,181 --> 00:47:58,420
That's rule number one for fighting.
Never leave it in the hands of the judges.

819
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:01,780
Rule number one. It's probably like
rule number of guys down there first.

820
00:48:01,781 --> 00:48:06,260
It's like watch out further like or
sometimes perhaps up to number one,

821
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:10,280
smile as celebrities in the audience.
Do your cardio.

822
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:13,900
Donate like shit. I would
love to see those guys they
wanted to do too. It's like,

823
00:48:13,901 --> 00:48:15,490
can we leave this to the judge was like,
dude,

824
00:48:15,491 --> 00:48:20,491
just fucking worry about
[inaudible] to the judges.

825
00:48:20,621 --> 00:48:25,450
I need to know.
Oh my God.

826
00:48:25,451 --> 00:48:28,900
That's funny.
That was really behind your dance idea.

827
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:32,050
Dancing would be tough.
I do have a gym for you.

828
00:48:32,051 --> 00:48:34,720
Home was a place right
near by me. Joe. Joe,

829
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:38,770
I think you're overestimating your dance
skills. Hip Hop, dance, not dance skills.

830
00:48:38,771 --> 00:48:42,940
I'll learn them. Would it be an
amount of time in my body better?

831
00:48:43,330 --> 00:48:46,270
I learned them. You know how to
move your body. You better for sure.

832
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:49,810
You don't lose moved. Moved my body
better than you can move yours.

833
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:53,000
Do you think we get Shakira
to just even say that?

834
00:48:54,270 --> 00:48:55,210
Do you know crazy?

835
00:48:55,211 --> 00:49:00,211
It is for you to say that my physical
dexterity in your physical death.

836
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:05,230
[inaudible]
talking about Joe,

837
00:49:08,210 --> 00:49:12,520
Joe Kelly Ripa wobble. If I got through
that challenge and you didn't prepare,

838
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:14,890
you came in last like you
did with this last one.

839
00:49:15,290 --> 00:49:20,290
We read [inaudible] put a sock in a
fucking with a lock in it like a bike lock

840
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:24,520
and beat your ass punishment for this.
I'm cool with punishment.

841
00:49:24,521 --> 00:49:28,120
That's a good idea. Barrio punished,
right? Like, like full metal jacket.

842
00:49:28,890 --> 00:49:33,340
Borrow Code Right. You out with
a bar. Soap in a sock dance.

843
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:37,400
I think that even Matthew Modine got in on
this number. Yeah, he did. That's right.

844
00:49:37,410 --> 00:49:39,970
Yeah. Until he felt bad about being, I
don't know if this is the real thing.

845
00:49:42,550 --> 00:49:44,110
So you don't know if,
what's the real thing?

846
00:49:44,111 --> 00:49:47,180
I think you need to keep
pushing her hip hop dance works.

847
00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:49,990
Stick with your challenge.
If you like.

848
00:49:50,610 --> 00:49:54,340
I could see us going through all these
fucking things and bird the as like, Whoa,

849
00:49:54,350 --> 00:49:56,910
you guys beat me. I can't believe
it. Like you motherfucker.

850
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:58,940
You're talking shit the whole month.
Yeah.

851
00:49:59,030 --> 00:50:03,340
Talking Shit the whole month and you
came in last. That's my game plan.

852
00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:07,480
That's a good point of sandbags.
Next challenge. No sandbags.

853
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:11,670
Fucking October. You be fell
apart. Dude, I fell apart. Okay.

854
00:50:11,790 --> 00:50:16,600
When are you started posting these giant?
He, he was on the bike for four hours.

855
00:50:16,610 --> 00:50:21,180
Like what? Oh Fuck my
head up. Todd got bad.

856
00:50:21,450 --> 00:50:25,450
Jeff fucking, we started, we started
off with like 200 points was a good day.

857
00:50:25,630 --> 00:50:29,360
It was like, it was like that scene
in big when, uh, when I'm uh, love it.

858
00:50:29,361 --> 00:50:31,630
So tell us, uh, what's his name? Like,
Hey, slow down. Slow down somewhere.

859
00:50:31,650 --> 00:50:36,420
You can make us all look bad. You
know, we're all doing as an easy, easy,

860
00:50:36,430 --> 00:50:39,080
easy, easy, crazy. Anybody
was going to take it.

861
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:43,220
We don't know how much or how much we
hated each other to the really drive us to

862
00:50:43,221 --> 00:50:46,940
not be, well, I don't know how you
looked at it, but I love you guys.

863
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:49,580
I just thought it was a fun competition.

864
00:50:49,581 --> 00:50:52,870
She's flipped the fuck aring stand by it.

865
00:50:55,330 --> 00:50:58,250
I was the most amount of
points you ever put in a day.

866
00:50:58,490 --> 00:51:03,370
My biggest point day was you
ran 13 miles one day. Yeah. Oh,

867
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:06,990
broken up. No, no, just, I
mean like just going and going.

868
00:51:07,050 --> 00:51:10,610
I did it in the hills and you know,
just kept up, ran like to another city,

869
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:14,690
came back since he ran 13 fucking miles.
That was after he was sick for a week.

870
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:17,820
That's what I almost dropped
out. I was like, oh he's
done. Cool. Yeah, we got home,

871
00:51:17,821 --> 00:51:21,680
we took the photo thing,
Gash, sandbag dust.

872
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:23,480
Why did you take the
foot off the gas pedal?

873
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:27,630
We should've waited till he was for
sure. Tom was like, I'm sick. I'm out.

874
00:51:28,010 --> 00:51:29,420
I was like Thompson last.
I don't have to worry.

875
00:51:29,690 --> 00:51:32,360
I'm not in the last oh is that what you
were worried about? Cause I was like,

876
00:51:32,650 --> 00:51:35,780
I was competing with Tom. Tom and I were
neck in neck. Ari was a fucking cunt.

877
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:37,850
And we just post the numbers
in the middle of the night.

878
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:41,510
You'd go to sleep like two thirds in.
Oh he didn't start like that.

879
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:43,490
I posted the Middle Lane Cause I,
my gym,

880
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:47,840
blink fitness would allow me
to work out 24 hours a day.

881
00:51:47,841 --> 00:51:49,910
So I'd cut off for,
it was fucking ridiculous.

882
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:54,560
Fucking go work out three items that
was fucked my head up, man. I'd wake up,

883
00:51:54,590 --> 00:51:58,250
you wake up and you're like, you play
Masti play nasty. Forgive me late spots.

884
00:51:59,150 --> 00:52:03,530
It's not my fault. It's
all St. It's tricky, right?

885
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:07,990
[inaudible] gameplay.
But here's what I realized.

886
00:52:08,190 --> 00:52:12,980
You guys woke up like, Oh, what? Yeah,
I'm not in first. We'll give this.

887
00:52:12,981 --> 00:52:16,550
I like this. Here's what
I've, okay, keep this.

888
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:20,030
I think you guys should do
a dance off anyway. Well,

889
00:52:20,031 --> 00:52:22,190
he does have that incredible
physical dexterity.

890
00:52:22,970 --> 00:52:24,800
They would need a way
for judges to decide,

891
00:52:24,890 --> 00:52:29,090
but that's not about working out
though, right? Hip Hop dancing,

892
00:52:29,230 --> 00:52:31,370
no hip hop dancing.
If you're going to get good,

893
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:35,480
you're going to be dancing
every single day. Dot.

894
00:52:36,630 --> 00:52:40,930
That's how you, I don't like doing it,
but that was a good restaurant. Why is,

895
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:48,530
somebody showed me a tweet I made
recently a year ago. I'm like,

896
00:52:48,531 --> 00:52:53,180
how did we get from Burt
can run a marathon to all
gonna go straight edge for a

897
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:55,900
month.
What the fuck happens.

898
00:52:55,910 --> 00:52:58,640
Exactly what we got from
[inaudible] couldn't run a marathon.

899
00:52:58,641 --> 00:53:00,710
He couldn't do it faster
than your dad did.

900
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:05,180
Suddenly we're all straight US
holocaust survivor and then he was,

901
00:53:05,181 --> 00:53:06,890
but he was also like,
I can run a marathon tomorrow

902
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:14,140
easily. Technically kind of did.
Yeah, you did. I tactically dead.

903
00:53:14,141 --> 00:53:16,310
I did blow the doors off. You guys.
You were really, really amazed.

904
00:53:16,490 --> 00:53:19,750
But I think the real test was that Tom
was going to try to rollerskate and

905
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:21,040
marathon fashion,

906
00:53:21,870 --> 00:53:25,920
but he didn't take into account going
uphill or the fact that he has never

907
00:53:25,930 --> 00:53:29,540
rollerskated. Yeah, but that's easy to
learn. Kids are flat four wheel like.

908
00:53:29,541 --> 00:53:30,900
It's like fuck,
look out for us.

909
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,380
What do you think would have happened
on the roller skating part of it after

910
00:53:34,381 --> 00:53:37,410
running that marathon? Yeah.
Uh, you are crushed. You,

911
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:39,480
you probably would have beat
me. Yeah, it was a flat.

912
00:53:39,870 --> 00:53:43,980
You don't have la [inaudible]. No, hold
on. La Marathon was uphill downtown,

913
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:45,570
but once you got past the store,

914
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:49,080
you would have been hauling
fucking ass down Luciana guy.

915
00:53:49,270 --> 00:53:51,380
I would never call him
from seller to them.

916
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:54,730
Nobody is checking them off and he got
hurt a couple of rollers getting people

917
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:58,790
and they like, no. They said
like, your feet are going to,

918
00:53:59,010 --> 00:54:03,270
you're going to be in rough
fucking blow out as cash.

919
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:08,720
[inaudible]
lightly.

920
00:54:08,790 --> 00:54:09,990
We're,
we're warriors.

921
00:54:10,230 --> 00:54:12,900
I get it from people that have been
doing it for years and also like,

922
00:54:12,901 --> 00:54:15,360
what does that, the Roller Derby
people, they were like, yeah,

923
00:54:15,361 --> 00:54:18,540
you gotta be careful with it.
Just think about skiing for five hours.

924
00:54:18,570 --> 00:54:21,000
If you had a school of greatness,

925
00:54:21,001 --> 00:54:25,080
that would be [inaudible] ski for five
hours straight without going up lift

926
00:54:25,081 --> 00:54:28,170
hills, going into the lifts, up the hills.

927
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:31,680
If you just skied all we only
on your feet for five hours,

928
00:54:31,681 --> 00:54:35,550
I bet you it'd be hurting. Oh yeah.
Bird. Anyway, it's, muscles are all sore.

929
00:54:36,330 --> 00:54:38,880
My feet are always hurting after
a day of skiing like Jesus.

930
00:54:38,881 --> 00:54:43,800
Cause you're always like, yeah,
yeah, no. It would've been,

931
00:54:43,830 --> 00:54:46,900
I would've been fucked up for sure. You
got fucked up. Did you see me crash Bert?

932
00:54:47,790 --> 00:54:50,910
Yeah. Yeah, I did. I did. And then I
pulled up and you were like, oh, it was,

933
00:54:50,911 --> 00:54:54,500
I don't think it's broken
shark rocket is it? Put It,

934
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:56,670
put a pin in it for Comcast.

935
00:54:56,690 --> 00:55:01,690
I saw you with the big dam down to this
now so up you got pen in there like a

936
00:55:02,131 --> 00:55:05,580
metal piece broke off. Got some sort of
pen. You know what's good about that?

937
00:55:05,630 --> 00:55:08,490
It give one more reason to
fuck with the people at Tsa.

938
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:11,490
You're going to go fucking might have
a sacrament there that they're like,

939
00:55:11,491 --> 00:55:12,630
how come something's
going off to everything?

940
00:55:12,650 --> 00:55:14,380
You're talking like the sector meetings,
like anything in your pocket.

941
00:55:14,381 --> 00:55:18,150
I'm like the sec to me they're like,
what about belts? Vasectomy and the like,

942
00:55:18,151 --> 00:55:19,770
what? What? What do you
think it's, I'm like,

943
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:23,940
I had my dick cut and you're fucking
stupid thing that you're the head of this

944
00:55:23,941 --> 00:55:28,830
company decided we need to buy. It points
out that I got up a sec to me. Really.

945
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:31,680
How does it know you out of a sector?
Because it's a little inconsistent.

946
00:55:31,681 --> 00:55:36,060
It's like a hard thing in there. Peanut
you want to feel it? No, it's your choice.

947
00:55:36,150 --> 00:55:37,950
Interesting.
So it's calcified.

948
00:55:37,951 --> 00:55:40,970
You've got like a little
rock that rock new Dick Hole,

949
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:43,670
fucking terrorist threat dance.

950
00:55:43,750 --> 00:55:47,130
So I want to ask you one thing
about your challenge. You say, no,

951
00:55:47,131 --> 00:55:49,290
we're not doing already. No, no, no.
I just wanted to ask her something,

952
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:55,950
but like there's not enough of, it has
to be a second part to that, right.

953
00:55:55,951 --> 00:55:59,580
For the month. What do you mean?
Like, yes, there's nothing physical.

954
00:55:59,581 --> 00:56:01,770
Really a good point. You know
what I mean? Like is there,

955
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:04,730
it would just be that would,
we would need a second part because right.

956
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:08,940
That is just a mental problem. Yeah.
Well, would the guys, I'm telling you,

957
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,740
you're not going to do it. I
know how addicted you are. Ours,

958
00:56:10,741 --> 00:56:15,000
you're never going to agree to this
dancing videos. It would make your lives.

959
00:56:15,001 --> 00:56:17,670
You'd be happier and you
wouldn't know why. Hm. No,

960
00:56:17,671 --> 00:56:21,700
I've been off Twitter pretty much and
it's, I'm an exponentially hopper.

961
00:56:21,930 --> 00:56:23,860
Twitter just makes me sad and angry.

962
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:28,450
Reading people fighting is not fun. Can I,
uh, can I show you something? Sure. Yeah.

963
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:30,400
I'm lucky for one for me.
I won't do anything,

964
00:56:30,790 --> 00:56:33,670
but just unlock it and hand it to me.
I swear I won't do anything bad to you.

965
00:56:33,790 --> 00:56:37,290
I have a quote about her. Okay. Ryan,

966
00:56:37,291 --> 00:56:42,230
who's on the storm didn't fucking
terrified with what I just gave you.

967
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:45,610
You know what I'm going to do? No, I was
gonna look up the time of usage. Yeah.

968
00:56:45,730 --> 00:56:50,650
Screenshot. Oh, it's gotta
be up there. Okay, so just to
tour dates, bro. Yeah. Okay.

969
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:53,440
So today of your life, you have
a family. You have two kids.

970
00:56:53,470 --> 00:56:56,860
I started morning radio at five in the
morning until 11 hold that thought.

971
00:56:56,861 --> 00:56:59,110
So while you're on morning
radio, you're not using it? No.

972
00:56:59,111 --> 00:57:02,240
I was using an entirely to look up
who I was talking to, where I was at.

973
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:05,020
And while you're on there,
you're not doing it. Yeah. Okay.

974
00:57:05,050 --> 00:57:09,930
What time is it right now? It's four 26
yeah, three hours and nine minutes. Oh,

975
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:12,940
I'm sorry. 300 minutes
above average today. Yeah.

976
00:57:13,150 --> 00:57:16,000
Today was press doing
press for the body shots.

977
00:57:16,001 --> 00:57:18,840
World Tours last seven days
starts in September, ends June,

978
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:22,060
November 23rd I'll be in Oakland.

979
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:25,730
They actually surprised me 30
minutes a day. Yeah, I don't, dude.

980
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:28,840
I fuck with Instagram a lot.
Is that on here? Yeah, it's,

981
00:57:28,841 --> 00:57:33,040
we have an hour and 18 minutes. Yeah. I
fuck with Instagram a lot and that's it.

982
00:57:33,430 --> 00:57:37,210
What do you do? I did I, that's
it. I don't, don't touch Twitter.

983
00:57:37,211 --> 00:57:41,740
I kind of stay away from everything
I see yours? No. How bad is it?

984
00:57:42,190 --> 00:57:45,210
It's a, today's not that bad. Look up
screen time for the week. All right.

985
00:57:46,690 --> 00:57:48,490
Are there totally Da's?
I'm totally off my phone.

986
00:57:49,170 --> 00:57:51,640
You don't touch you at all
the court stuff and post it,

987
00:57:51,641 --> 00:57:53,890
but I don't read comments and
stuff that can fuck your head up.

988
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:58,870
Twitter can be aggressive sometimes.
Find out great. Used to be, oh dude,

989
00:57:59,010 --> 00:58:03,020
remember that? Fun Jokes.
Yeah, I can't. I can do.

990
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:06,550
My whole thing's about, I only use stuff
to promote toward. That's it really.

991
00:58:06,610 --> 00:58:07,443
SORTA.
It's like,

992
00:58:07,810 --> 00:58:12,790
like October 15th hour of social
networking. It's his. Yeah,

993
00:58:12,870 --> 00:58:17,680
but in seven days. Seven days.
Seven Day. Okay. Hold on. Hey,

994
00:58:17,681 --> 00:58:21,840
let's get more cocktails. I'm down.
I'm pretty fun. Where's your kid? Hey,

995
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:25,150
how are we going to fucking switch him
over to fucking hip hop dance slowly.

996
00:58:25,510 --> 00:58:30,120
Slowly. It starts with me. I have
a better dexterity. Lots. A lot.

997
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:34,520
How much are you at right now?
[inaudible] wait, wait, wait.

998
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:40,210
Let me preemptively say, oh sure. I was
on a bus for the last seven days. Sure.

999
00:58:40,211 --> 00:58:43,300
So just a good, definitely
I'm saying at home, not home.

1000
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:46,750
We're checking them or amount of
usage on the online, on our phones,

1001
00:58:48,950 --> 00:58:50,620
down a bus. This is, by the way,

1002
00:58:50,621 --> 00:58:54,250
this time could be spent reading
a book or doing something,

1003
00:58:54,251 --> 00:58:57,370
but go ahead and even today,
30 minutes I think is pretty low.

1004
00:59:01,090 --> 00:59:05,050
Six hours and 34 minutes
a day. Lastly, on a bus.

1005
00:59:05,430 --> 00:59:09,220
On a bus. But now, but that is
on, but no, I get your board,

1006
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:11,950
but there's a far better
way to spend your time.

1007
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:16,480
Here's the, but you have to bit to
kind of look at it like this too.

1008
00:59:17,050 --> 00:59:21,470
I'm sitting on this bus with a fucking
thousand movies you can choose from and I

1009
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:22,010
do this all the

1010
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:25,640
time where I roll through like I'm going
to watch a movie which is like a normal

1011
00:59:25,641 --> 00:59:28,670
thing to kill an hour and a half,
two hours and I'm like,

1012
00:59:28,970 --> 00:59:31,910
none of these interests me. I'm going
to spend that time doing this. Right.

1013
00:59:31,911 --> 00:59:34,820
Looking at emails, looking at social
media, looking at youtube videos.

1014
00:59:35,230 --> 00:59:38,870
It's if I'm saying that you can
knock off easily two hours. Yeah,

1015
00:59:39,650 --> 00:59:43,790
and there'd be two hours
spent just mindlessly staring
at something else or that

1016
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:44,590
you wouldn't be

1017
00:59:44,590 --> 00:59:47,910
have a record of free
writing or that's true.

1018
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,660
Or like you're saying that none of that
occurred or learning hip hop dance. No,

1019
00:59:51,661 --> 00:59:53,040
I'm saying that I will say this,

1020
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:56,940
when you're bored and you're looking
out a window on a tour bus eventually,

1021
00:59:56,970 --> 01:00:00,630
not the first time minutes button that
maybe puts in 10 minute, 30 minute,

1022
01:00:00,631 --> 01:00:04,710
40 your mind's like, fuck, we're so bored.
And then you start writing big ideas.

1023
01:00:05,630 --> 01:00:06,420
That's true.
True.

1024
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:09,720
And you're just not even thinking about
those times because you're on there.

1025
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:11,280
That's true.
It's 100% true.

1026
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:16,150
Wait,
so what's yours like eight minutes?

1027
01:00:16,570 --> 01:00:20,950
Uh, I would have to get my iPad out.
No, yours is. Yeah, take it out and see.

1028
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:23,850
Ariz is surprisingly high because he uses,

1029
01:00:23,851 --> 01:00:26,860
is that when he's not at lights your
seven day though? I have no idea.

1030
01:00:26,861 --> 01:00:28,510
Seven Day was 30 minutes.
Yeah,

1031
01:00:28,660 --> 01:00:32,020
today was three hours and a half
to seven day was 30 minutes a day.

1032
01:00:32,021 --> 01:00:36,400
Average 30 minutes a day. Wait, how's
that possible second founder. Yes.

1033
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:39,600
Hold a second. Phone. Use the
search part. Split screen test.

1034
01:00:39,650 --> 01:00:43,360
They're going to make sense
mathematically. Good. John and Tommy,

1035
01:00:43,361 --> 01:00:46,970
you're absolutely right. That three
hours, 35 minutes today would be,

1036
01:00:47,490 --> 01:00:51,660
you would have to only abuse that
out there. It's a brand new box.

1037
01:00:52,810 --> 01:00:57,230
Would use that 30 minutes. I was like, I'm
a fuck. Is that possible? I'll show you.

1038
01:00:57,231 --> 01:01:01,630
Where is it? Oh yeah. Oh, two
hours and six minutes. That's,

1039
01:01:01,780 --> 01:01:06,660
that's too much. What's too much advisor's
office today? I want to find it. This,

1040
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:07,533
what is it?

1041
01:01:08,290 --> 01:01:12,560
Uh,
fuck no man.

1042
01:01:14,490 --> 01:01:16,490
What'd you do?
What'd you get the fucking here.

1043
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:20,280
I love the one guy that
doesn't have behind high
phones walking you through your

1044
01:01:20,281 --> 01:01:23,730
iPhone. That's true. Oh,

1045
01:01:23,790 --> 01:01:27,720
five hours and 30 minutes
for 51 minutes a day. Wow.

1046
01:01:27,870 --> 01:01:30,840
That's a lot for hours and
51 minutes of your day.

1047
01:01:31,430 --> 01:01:35,370
Five of your 16 hour waking day.
And Joe's defense not to, but like,

1048
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:38,280
he's got a new people all the time
and I'm sure there's times he's like,

1049
01:01:38,490 --> 01:01:41,430
tell me about that guy. Dot Dot,
dot. Okay. Definitely a lot of that.

1050
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:44,790
I keep hearing that in my defense, my
defense, but I'm never in an authentic,

1051
01:01:44,791 --> 01:01:47,910
where am I? That's too much.
It's too much. It is too much.

1052
01:01:47,940 --> 01:01:52,320
You do do some work on your phone,
but more than that, you fuck off.

1053
01:01:52,530 --> 01:01:57,210
I have every nope transcribed in my phone.
All my notes from my writing,

1054
01:01:57,240 --> 01:02:00,940
my laptop, it's all on my phone.
Um, all my sets are on my show.

1055
01:02:00,941 --> 01:02:03,800
It shows your productivity on their
decision. What you using a timeline. Yeah.

1056
01:02:03,801 --> 01:02:04,634
It won't be,

1057
01:02:04,650 --> 01:02:07,020
you want it to sound like it's going
to be four hours in 35 minutes of

1058
01:02:07,021 --> 01:02:09,270
productivity at 20 minutes
of fucking off. No, no.

1059
01:02:09,271 --> 01:02:13,850
A lot of it is also watching stuff.
[inaudible] [inaudible]

1060
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:18,060
safari and let's take it. Let's play a
game. Or I can go, hey, tell me about.dot,

1061
01:02:18,061 --> 01:02:22,950
dot. What you'd googled? Fun fucking
game. I am. I got my computer here.

1062
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:26,170
Give me your phone. I got my computer.
Give me your phones. Give me your phone.

1063
01:02:26,230 --> 01:02:29,550
No one can go back while,

1064
01:02:31,140 --> 01:02:35,220
um, I have my computer here. It's
a lot of time when you look at it,

1065
01:02:35,221 --> 01:02:36,570
when you see a lot of hours,

1066
01:02:36,580 --> 01:02:41,190
a lot of waking time spent looking at a
screen instead of your surroundings. Wow.

1067
01:02:41,490 --> 01:02:44,220
What is the last things I googled
the driving part of that. You can't,

1068
01:02:44,221 --> 01:02:48,150
you're not using it. You're
fucking me and it's you.

1069
01:02:48,151 --> 01:02:52,150
And then it's just some porn.
How much does that go?

1070
01:02:52,170 --> 01:02:55,680
I only like anal scenes. You beating
off every day? No, I just started again.

1071
01:02:55,950 --> 01:02:58,620
Interesting. Take some time
off. Yeah, I took some time off.

1072
01:02:58,621 --> 01:03:02,340
I was having a hard time with it. And now
I'm now his phone. This is always fun.

1073
01:03:04,470 --> 01:03:08,910
I gotta call you back if he's
got a laptop that has a CD drive.

1074
01:03:09,830 --> 01:03:14,130
Oh it does it.
That's the right year to buy honestly.

1075
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:16,560
Cause a good keyboard. Yeah. All the ones,

1076
01:03:16,561 --> 01:03:19,200
the ones that got an hour fucking
horrible. The problem is with that,

1077
01:03:19,201 --> 01:03:21,390
you can't do the same things on Instagram.

1078
01:03:21,391 --> 01:03:25,290
We can't post stuff from
your fucking computer. No, I
have to send it to my lady.

1079
01:03:26,070 --> 01:03:29,640
You can't post it for a mom. An iPad. Yes.

1080
01:03:29,641 --> 01:03:32,600
You probably could lock myself out
of my out of my account and I'm like,

1081
01:03:32,670 --> 01:03:36,950
I don't know the password.
Hilarious. SMART, smart.

1082
01:03:37,210 --> 01:03:40,950
It's a monopoly. Does not make for a great
sober October challenge in my opinion.

1083
01:03:40,951 --> 01:03:44,940
Just to watch people do nothing is not
because he's saying that it would still

1084
01:03:44,941 --> 01:03:47,220
get posted. Everything will
still get posted. No, no body

1085
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:53,010
camera lady legit like digital
camera of this challenge.

1086
01:03:53,070 --> 01:03:57,030
Is that some you enjoy like following
along with it terms of what we're doing.

1087
01:03:57,260 --> 01:04:00,050
It's not our normal thing.
Rogan clearly is the,

1088
01:04:00,130 --> 01:04:02,640
it's the working out so he doesn't
have to change his life that much.

1089
01:04:02,820 --> 01:04:06,570
All you do is promote the
worst for you to not have.

1090
01:04:06,660 --> 01:04:10,760
Where you're already doing
is promoting nonstop. Oh,

1091
01:04:10,770 --> 01:04:13,870
he has his hip hop dancing.
Did you knock something over again?

1092
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:18,030
So then what's Tom Bad
at? What pig? A father.

1093
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:24,540
So we've got the,
what if we switched kids?

1094
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:30,810
How do you handle this? What? What
do you do? How do you handle this?

1095
01:04:31,350 --> 01:04:33,480
How do we do this?
I didn't say what I hear you,

1096
01:04:33,481 --> 01:04:35,820
but what are those pronouns you mean?

1097
01:04:36,060 --> 01:04:40,260
I mean I'm saying like
I like the idea of a,

1098
01:04:40,290 --> 01:04:42,870
some sort of social media challenge,
like staying off social media.

1099
01:04:42,871 --> 01:04:46,470
It's kind of stuff that I did something.
That's the thing we were missing.

1100
01:04:46,471 --> 01:04:49,890
The second poll. 100% you're,
you're dead on dead on with that.

1101
01:04:50,070 --> 01:04:53,850
The Birkin go fuck himself with
this hip hop dance and shit. So Joe,

1102
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:58,560
I do have a hip hop dance place right
near my apartment that I could go to all

1103
01:04:58,561 --> 01:05:00,010
the time.
I told you I'm in mandate.

1104
01:05:00,060 --> 01:05:03,300
You're in a Maori or do you think social
hip hop dance would be a good one?

1105
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:07,470
I think it, I think, let's put a pin in
that. I think for Real, put a pin in it.

1106
01:05:08,150 --> 01:05:10,080
That would be at some level of acceptable.

1107
01:05:10,081 --> 01:05:14,280
We'd have to get judges who
dove is active. No judges.

1108
01:05:14,550 --> 01:05:18,040
Judges can go fuck themselves.
We want real hard numbers.

1109
01:05:19,410 --> 01:05:20,710
Let's put in parameters.

1110
01:05:23,110 --> 01:05:27,740
You can't have a bad decision that causes
a ride amongst our fans to feel like

1111
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:31,240
someone unfairly got the belt.
Even if we don't do this.

1112
01:05:31,540 --> 01:05:36,540
There was something so real
about how good you are.

1113
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:41,470
You said you're a better mover than him.
That I would love to see.

1114
01:05:41,770 --> 01:05:44,110
I feel like part of the month you
have to do something with that.

1115
01:05:44,620 --> 01:05:49,390
You know what I mean? I think the, the
audience would love it. It makes sense.

1116
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:52,360
Oh, it's gotta be, here's the deal.

1117
01:05:52,710 --> 01:05:55,480
Let's just put parameters on worst rubber
tube or it's going to be taking place.

1118
01:05:55,600 --> 01:06:00,030
Thomas touring through Europe in
our hall for part of it yet. Yeah.

1119
01:06:00,130 --> 01:06:03,190
How many days? 10 days. That will
cripple you. You're going to get sick.

1120
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:08,140
[inaudible] fitness. I'm Cardi landed
down. Forget about any fitness challenge,

1121
01:06:08,141 --> 01:06:10,210
son.
10 days in Europe,

1122
01:06:10,570 --> 01:06:13,270
all that traveling or with
those weird European diseases,

1123
01:06:14,020 --> 01:06:18,660
that's how they wiped out most of the
American people. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

1124
01:06:18,730 --> 01:06:21,410
Easy to find there. His foot's
gonna have wiped out Europe. People.

1125
01:06:21,430 --> 01:06:23,740
Graham Hancock says that
at one point in time,

1126
01:06:23,741 --> 01:06:28,030
the Amazon jungle had 20 million
people and thriving civilizations,

1127
01:06:28,031 --> 01:06:31,910
beautiful cities, and that the
Europeans, they're dirty diseases. Yeah.

1128
01:06:31,970 --> 01:06:34,600
Came over and wiped everybody out.
Let's heal the thousands.

1129
01:06:34,660 --> 01:06:36,710
That's actually your parents.
Yeah.

1130
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:41,340
Your Dad was one of those in
run away from a virus. True.

1131
01:06:41,410 --> 01:06:42,730
Getting rid of his dirty bugs.

1132
01:06:42,731 --> 01:06:45,220
Your mom was down washing or
laundry next to a caiman alligator.

1133
01:06:45,750 --> 01:06:50,620
He came up his sleeves that are pussy.
Hey,

1134
01:06:50,621 --> 01:06:52,720
tell me this. Uh, the creek and the cave,

1135
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:56,080
the Legion of skanks are not
doing what the fuck they're doing.

1136
01:06:56,081 --> 01:06:58,180
Not doing their show at the creek
and the cave anymore. First of all,

1137
01:06:58,210 --> 01:07:01,750
you guys coming to me on this is worse
than Ainslie being coming to you about

1138
01:07:01,751 --> 01:07:06,530
the comedy store. Milo, I think
it's directly related. Yeah. Yeah.

1139
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:10,720
Right. But that's why
that's what happened. No,

1140
01:07:10,721 --> 01:07:13,210
they were trying to do it at the creek
and the cave and the lady freaked out.

1141
01:07:13,211 --> 01:07:16,090
Right. She buckled under pressure.
That's not why they're moving.

1142
01:07:16,091 --> 01:07:17,710
They're already going to move it.
They're already gonna move it.

1143
01:07:18,070 --> 01:07:21,040
There's new standards opening up though.
I'll use this as an excuse maybe,

1144
01:07:21,041 --> 01:07:24,730
or people will say that's the reason they
were already going to move it from the

1145
01:07:24,731 --> 01:07:26,230
beginning. For somebody who doesn't
know what you're talking about.

1146
01:07:26,270 --> 01:07:28,600
[inaudible] booked legion of skanks.

1147
01:07:28,601 --> 01:07:33,160
You know who they are legit people
who hold the rose and Luis, right?

1148
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:37,820
Luis, Luis Gomez and Gomez
and uh, Dave Smith and they,

1149
01:07:37,910 --> 01:07:40,810
they're hardcore guys except when they
come on this podcast plus out. But like,

1150
01:07:40,811 --> 01:07:44,620
um, the hardcore guys for the
most part, so they booked,

1151
01:07:45,140 --> 01:07:48,010
they bitched out on the day.
I don't understand that.

1152
01:07:48,011 --> 01:07:52,480
I thought we just had a conversation.
[inaudible] that's fucking,

1153
01:07:52,481 --> 01:07:55,240
I'm actually jackass in that heyday
of jackass and them all sitting here

1154
01:07:55,241 --> 01:07:58,060
politely and not trying to fucking shave
their heads in front of, it's like,

1155
01:07:58,061 --> 01:08:02,710
come on dude. Obviously they need a second
chance on this podcast. Thanks. Not now.

1156
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:07,450
Not on you. I wouldn't get
one. These expectations come
up and do something crazy.

1157
01:08:07,460 --> 01:08:11,320
I'm like, come here. Had a
good time with you. Yeah. Fun.
Nice car. Nice conversation.

1158
01:08:11,321 --> 01:08:15,280
But it's funny. [inaudible] I know it's
traceable to drink some tea. They said,

1159
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:18,930
let's talk a Milo Yiannopoulos
and Milo said they cooked down.

1160
01:08:18,931 --> 01:08:22,880
So now ours running with the narrative.
Listen,

1161
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,830
so they booked Milo. They're like, oh,

1162
01:08:24,831 --> 01:08:28,400
we have this guy who's been
fucking whatever. And then uh,

1163
01:08:28,490 --> 01:08:31,310
and then everyone started going doing
the thing with the attack, the venue,

1164
01:08:31,460 --> 01:08:35,810
if you have that are ready, the problem
is not enough that they can miss,

1165
01:08:35,811 --> 01:08:39,920
analyze the person or say,
I want nothing to do with that guy.

1166
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:43,550
Then if you put him up,
then you're the issue.

1167
01:08:43,551 --> 01:08:48,551
Or a woman who gave birth to tons of
fucking great LGBA and fucking black

1168
01:08:49,221 --> 01:08:50,054
performers.

1169
01:08:50,090 --> 01:08:53,840
She's an issue because she's not
stopping or a performance from happening.

1170
01:08:54,170 --> 01:08:56,780
And then soon it will be like if
you're performing at that venue,

1171
01:08:56,781 --> 01:09:00,710
then you're an asshole. Right, right.
You know, it's nonsense happening.

1172
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:05,180
What's the ACF for lesbian,
gay, bisexual alliance. Oh,

1173
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:09,440
they have a lot more since I left
college, but that's what I was told. Yeah,

1174
01:09:09,550 --> 01:09:12,110
that's a problem is when you look at LGBT,

1175
01:09:12,111 --> 01:09:15,050
which is like the accepted
use of those letters.

1176
01:09:15,051 --> 01:09:18,260
We didn't have to add college to
a, in the end we were like, oh,

1177
01:09:18,261 --> 01:09:21,830
a is now asexual and fin Taylor does
a great joke where it's like they're

1178
01:09:21,831 --> 01:09:24,760
included, but it goes, the reality
is the asexuals hate the other ones.

1179
01:09:25,050 --> 01:09:26,030
But like you're disgusting.

1180
01:09:26,030 --> 01:09:29,420
I don't care what kind of sex or having
lesbians are not really excited about

1181
01:09:29,421 --> 01:09:33,800
transgender men or transgender
women rather true. There's that.

1182
01:09:33,801 --> 01:09:37,700
There's turfs you know trans exclusionary
radical feminist. No, I don't know.

1183
01:09:38,180 --> 01:09:40,900
Busy fucking live in my life
and trying to fucking dominate.

1184
01:09:41,780 --> 01:09:43,870
You're trying to dominate.
Try to dominate. Damn.

1185
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:46,630
I didn't know you were trying to dam.
Can you fill me and more on this though?

1186
01:09:46,650 --> 01:09:50,720
So tell me about Dominic
not leave dominating.

1187
01:09:50,750 --> 01:09:53,030
I want to write that down,
but there was a big uproar.

1188
01:09:53,031 --> 01:09:56,840
A lot of comedians started trying to
like show how they were woken up and

1189
01:09:56,841 --> 01:09:58,370
they're like,
I don't think you should do it.

1190
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:01,670
Who have penguin very publicly quit
putting her, Becca in this position

1191
01:10:03,230 --> 01:10:04,390
was going to be in.

1192
01:10:04,410 --> 01:10:07,070
Here's how you can tell someone
who's a fucking white knight virtue.

1193
01:10:07,071 --> 01:10:11,570
Signaler when they don't go to you saying,
Hey, Tom, I'm calling you on the phone.

1194
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:13,580
Don't do this, but I get it.
I might not have your number,

1195
01:10:13,730 --> 01:10:17,960
so if I'm tweeting at you,
I'll just write at Thompson Guerra.

1196
01:10:18,290 --> 01:10:21,590
Don't do this. If I really want
to virtue signal, I'll go dot.

1197
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:25,340
At Thompson Goro Hey, at Thomson Reuters.
So it's not just me and your followers.

1198
01:10:25,380 --> 01:10:28,070
Everybody, anytime anybody
sees, if you're listening,

1199
01:10:28,190 --> 01:10:30,440
you see somebody not start with the APP.

1200
01:10:30,470 --> 01:10:34,280
That is them virtue signaling
on purpose and all these comics,

1201
01:10:34,340 --> 01:10:37,950
unless they're saying something positive,
they just wanted it. Oh yeah, yeah,

1202
01:10:37,970 --> 01:10:41,020
absolutely. That's you're right. Good
point. Like, hey everybody, come see Tom.

1203
01:10:41,090 --> 01:10:44,030
You know? Yeah. You don't want
to say Steve. Suppose fear.

1204
01:10:44,031 --> 01:10:47,310
I loved you knew Netflix specials.
Yeah, I'll let her the Jew hour. Yeah,

1205
01:10:47,540 --> 01:10:51,550
it's coming. Um, it's great. It's
great hour everyone. I saw it.

1206
01:10:51,551 --> 01:10:56,210
I saw some of like tower. He's
been working hard. You Buddy Milo,

1207
01:10:56,240 --> 01:11:00,200
he's going to appear on the show.
All these comics,

1208
01:11:00,201 --> 01:11:02,420
all these people started saying,
I will never go to the creek again.

1209
01:11:02,421 --> 01:11:06,710
She put unbelievable pressure on her.
They call him a Nazi club owner, Jewish.

1210
01:11:06,740 --> 01:11:11,740
And he's also married to a gay man who's
black Mack who was black [inaudible]

1211
01:11:12,021 --> 01:11:14,370
his ass opens it up gently.

1212
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:17,660
So wait a minute, what ends up happening?
So they go, we're not going to happen.

1213
01:11:17,860 --> 01:11:20,160
Okay. So they said, we're doing
this, we're not talking about,

1214
01:11:20,250 --> 01:11:24,140
they started going to war with these
fucking virtue signaler comics. Okay. Um,

1215
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:27,280
and then at some point, Rebecca, I
talked to her a bunch because I don't,

1216
01:11:27,390 --> 01:11:29,760
this is not my thing. I don't even
want to do it. And I'm like, Becca,

1217
01:11:30,030 --> 01:11:33,360
what you do is you stand by your comics
and so you let them do whatever they

1218
01:11:33,361 --> 01:11:36,450
want. Obviously I've been on the road,
I mean I've been on the wrong side.

1219
01:11:36,451 --> 01:11:39,510
I've had venues cancel me. Yeah.
Cause of Shit like this. So I'm like,

1220
01:11:39,540 --> 01:11:44,340
you don't want to be involved.
Then Milo's people said, oh guys,

1221
01:11:44,341 --> 01:11:48,570
you put out the, the time and date of
where I'm going to be, I can't go anymore.

1222
01:11:48,571 --> 01:11:50,240
So they moved it.
So they moved to instill,

1223
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:53,310
did it and still did it somewhere
else. Yeah, we did it. And then, okay,

1224
01:11:53,450 --> 01:11:56,040
it's a shout out to her
for not caving then. Yeah.

1225
01:11:56,740 --> 01:11:58,290
Consider names a creek in the cave.

1226
01:11:59,140 --> 01:12:01,260
[inaudible]

1227
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:06,640
yeah. So that, did it go out? Oh yeah,
10 no, no. Okay. Yeah. And it's, it's,

1228
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:08,380
it's all,
I didn't watch the whole thing,

1229
01:12:08,381 --> 01:12:11,110
but the part with you and Milo pouring
booze, it was, it was pretty funny.

1230
01:12:11,111 --> 01:12:14,530
The next time somebody calls Milo
a Nazi and me and Nazi sympathizer,

1231
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:16,730
they said to my face,
oh maybe I'm just weird,

1232
01:12:16,870 --> 01:12:19,930
weird cause I just saw my dad
speak at the memorial. But Mike,

1233
01:12:20,210 --> 01:12:23,860
if you're going to tell me the
people who took his father,

1234
01:12:23,861 --> 01:12:26,860
and so you need to say
goodbye to your son and son,

1235
01:12:26,861 --> 01:12:29,110
you've got to take care of the family
down and watch the rest of your family

1236
01:12:29,111 --> 01:12:32,860
fucking disappear in death is the
same as that political analyst.

1237
01:12:33,670 --> 01:12:37,960
I'm going to slap you. You
should slap. I should. It's so,

1238
01:12:37,961 --> 01:12:41,980
it's so derogatory and offensive
in a way that I'm not okay with it.

1239
01:12:41,980 --> 01:12:44,770
So you can say that away from me, but
if you say it to me, I'm going to,

1240
01:12:44,890 --> 01:12:48,100
there's a lot of Shit [inaudible] that
we're saying that there's not enough of

1241
01:12:48,101 --> 01:12:48,481
those guys.

1242
01:12:48,481 --> 01:12:51,930
You're getting smacked smack and that's
what he has always said things we good

1243
01:12:51,940 --> 01:12:55,570
snap, delirious, delirious.

1244
01:12:56,020 --> 01:12:58,720
Completely ridiculous.
It's insane. It was crazy.

1245
01:12:59,420 --> 01:13:02,950
Is a provoca tour.
He fucks with people.

1246
01:13:03,190 --> 01:13:07,120
He pushes buttons and he does. So
in the age of the Internet. Yeah,

1247
01:13:07,130 --> 01:13:10,810
he's great troll.
The thing that they got him on,

1248
01:13:10,870 --> 01:13:13,000
which is where it all got really weird,

1249
01:13:13,001 --> 01:13:16,690
was essentially him saying
that it should be okay.

1250
01:13:16,691 --> 01:13:19,870
What happened to him when he was molested?

1251
01:13:20,490 --> 01:13:21,940
That he was abused,

1252
01:13:21,941 --> 01:13:26,200
sexually molested by priest
and this priest, he, you know,

1253
01:13:26,201 --> 01:13:30,430
he would joke around and say that he was
the one that pursued the priest and he

1254
01:13:30,431 --> 01:13:33,670
was, trust me, I was the Predator
like that. That's how he said it is.

1255
01:13:33,671 --> 01:13:37,690
He's hilarious.
And that's what got him.

1256
01:13:37,870 --> 01:13:42,070
It was talking about that on my show
and then talking about it on this other

1257
01:13:42,071 --> 01:13:45,760
show, wasn't it? The amazing
atheist show was right.

1258
01:13:46,210 --> 01:13:48,820
The point is that anybody who says like
you shouldn't be allowed to put that

1259
01:13:48,821 --> 01:13:51,550
person, she can't be heard
anymore. That's what you're saying.

1260
01:13:51,580 --> 01:13:52,570
But that's what it was.

1261
01:13:52,750 --> 01:13:56,470
But it was really just his harsh critiques
of Liberals and feminists that were

1262
01:13:56,471 --> 01:13:59,290
so biting.
And then you know,

1263
01:13:59,350 --> 01:14:04,180
he actually did a podcast with Jordan
Peterson recently. We talked about the,

1264
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:05,290
the,
the molestation.

1265
01:14:05,291 --> 01:14:10,291
I didn't see it but from
Jordan's explanation it's
like he's understanding now

1266
01:14:10,541 --> 01:14:12,100
as he's older that yeah,
he was

1267
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:17,100
a victim of this thing and he was
making it less and less full. Yeah.

1268
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:21,100
Yeah.
That he was giving this guy like,

1269
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:25,880
like a pass that he did it to him
almost. Yeah, I agree. The cricket,

1270
01:14:25,881 --> 01:14:28,690
the cave was a great place for your
comics in New York because there's always

1271
01:14:28,691 --> 01:14:32,940
like, I hear nothing but great
fun. Plus it's like they, they,

1272
01:14:33,100 --> 01:14:36,250
they bring together young comics and like
give a place to perform with no one's,

1273
01:14:36,280 --> 01:14:38,710
it's, it's, it's, it is
what the comedy store was.

1274
01:14:38,770 --> 01:14:43,290
If you take away the side
effects of the 12 plus your cost,

1275
01:14:43,420 --> 01:14:48,420
how many seats is it? 80 on top
and 1520 on the bottom. Jesus.

1276
01:14:48,670 --> 01:14:50,790
Oh, do I walked in, I walked him.

1277
01:14:50,850 --> 01:14:54,830
This is my impression of this place in
one time I walked in with Shane's only

1278
01:14:54,850 --> 01:14:59,410
skank fest. Yeah. And I walked past
already throwing piss on somebody's.

1279
01:14:59,530 --> 01:15:00,340
Oh Nice.
Yeah.

1280
01:15:00,340 --> 01:15:05,340
And I walked downstairs to a room full
of people with their shirts off chanting.

1281
01:15:05,830 --> 01:15:08,860
Uh,
do you remember that Orry teaching?

1282
01:15:09,490 --> 01:15:11,090
Did you chit in a Tupperware there?

1283
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:17,110
That's where you opened it
in the Tupperware dictate
sound shit in a Tupperware

1284
01:15:17,111 --> 01:15:19,030
and then opened it up in the room.

1285
01:15:19,220 --> 01:15:24,220
It was a tackle boxes that fishing things
person like little was outside and he

1286
01:15:25,091 --> 01:15:28,930
was like, I ran it, smelled it
from fucking down the street.

1287
01:15:29,710 --> 01:15:31,020
I'm starting to gag just,

1288
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:36,900
and these guys were offended
by [inaudible] just shit
into it and see whatever

1289
01:15:38,441 --> 01:15:41,620
happened happened. It was a pile
a bit. Oh my God. The question,

1290
01:15:41,621 --> 01:15:43,720
I'm not sure exactly.
Sometimes when you shit,

1291
01:15:43,721 --> 01:15:46,900
it smells awful and you realize you've
shit so much. It's broken water.

1292
01:15:46,901 --> 01:15:47,900
It's rising.
Like

1293
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:53,860
why out of the fucking toilet bowl?
You know,

1294
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:58,350
it's like the Kona coast mount. Like,

1295
01:15:58,360 --> 01:16:02,710
why does it smell so bad? Human Liddy
realize human shit so bad, Mike.

1296
01:16:02,711 --> 01:16:05,380
Dog Shit doesn't smell nearly as bad.
Fuck.

1297
01:16:05,470 --> 01:16:08,830
Not even nearly as bad as people
should that people should discuss.

1298
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:12,790
It smells like hate crimes, dog
shit. Once it gets in between,

1299
01:16:12,791 --> 01:16:16,750
your toes smells worse.
Don't believe that dogs aren't drinking.

1300
01:16:16,990 --> 01:16:20,890
That's what it is. I'm not
drinking whiskey. Eating subway,

1301
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:27,460
dog hydration.
Water mixed her shit.

1302
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:31,870
Good guys on a dog has a new product.
We have a problem with dogs.

1303
01:16:31,970 --> 01:16:33,330
[inaudible] Shit.

1304
01:16:34,430 --> 01:16:37,930
Dehydrate your dog nearly as bad.

1305
01:16:39,470 --> 01:16:43,850
Not Nothing's as bad as humans. Shit
so nasty man. You know you what?

1306
01:16:43,870 --> 01:16:47,930
You're walking like in a city,
you still see shit and then say it.

1307
01:16:47,931 --> 01:16:50,710
Say if you just smell it,
you smell it.

1308
01:16:51,190 --> 01:16:55,090
It's like a fucking 90% chance.
Oh, how much? Shit. You know, dude,

1309
01:16:55,420 --> 01:16:58,480
that's what he told me in Hong Kong.
They're like, listen, if you see, hold on.

1310
01:16:58,720 --> 01:17:02,200
Not every man lander from
mainland China shits in malls,

1311
01:17:02,350 --> 01:17:05,200
but if you see shit in the
mall, that's a mainlander. Yeah,

1312
01:17:05,510 --> 01:17:09,860
like they're disgusting. They just
shit in the mall. They just shit.

1313
01:17:10,340 --> 01:17:12,670
Mainland Chinese people
just shit in the mall,

1314
01:17:12,671 --> 01:17:16,250
like told him I like him in the bathroom.
So the ground, the ground's whole case.

1315
01:17:16,251 --> 01:17:18,810
You're walking through the mall and
you see human shit on the ground.

1316
01:17:19,870 --> 01:17:22,160
They don't know how to be
Chinese doors are underrated.

1317
01:17:22,310 --> 01:17:26,810
There's tourists in the world. Chinese
stores, the worst tourists when they're,

1318
01:17:26,850 --> 01:17:29,120
when they're saying the Trump,
we're going to hold up tours and back.

1319
01:17:29,180 --> 01:17:32,390
All the fucking travelers
like please keep.

1320
01:17:32,930 --> 01:17:36,920
They are so they just,
some folks who live in rural,

1321
01:17:36,921 --> 01:17:40,200
China's aligned to the children.

1322
01:17:40,310 --> 01:17:42,320
You've been there but it hot these shorts.

1323
01:17:42,321 --> 01:17:45,580
He's wide shorts with a cut down the
middle. So when you're open, stand up,

1324
01:17:45,610 --> 01:17:48,140
the cut comes together when you squat,

1325
01:17:48,620 --> 01:17:51,380
so you don't have to fucking
lift your shorts out.

1326
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:55,220
It comes out and then just shit
away. Shit. Where they're walking.

1327
01:17:55,250 --> 01:17:59,810
10 year olds wearing his shorts.
How do I get those pants for Sundays?

1328
01:18:01,750 --> 01:18:05,330
What is this? Why kids keep crapping in
public in China is part of their culture.

1329
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:10,390
Dude. [inaudible] Shit. And you can
find anything online. These shits.

1330
01:18:10,410 --> 01:18:14,480
That's true. Let's look at Burt
with the fucking common sense, dude.

1331
01:18:14,481 --> 01:18:16,580
I'm getting treated and

1332
01:18:18,710 --> 01:18:23,360
worse doors, flip sides, acid, Chinese,
tourists and not poop on the ground.

1333
01:18:23,420 --> 01:18:26,510
Oh my God. Rolled down that for
a second. Five words. Tourists.

1334
01:18:26,511 --> 01:18:29,300
Chinese far and away number one like,
like fucking Richard Pryor.

1335
01:18:29,340 --> 01:18:33,660
Chinese replaced Americans as the worst
tourists in the world. We never work.

1336
01:18:34,070 --> 01:18:38,200
They're obnoxious. Oh my God. This is
a terrible article. Although, although,

1337
01:18:38,210 --> 01:18:42,500
have you ever been a shit in public?
Apparently. Oh my God. This is on Vice Uk,

1338
01:18:42,501 --> 01:18:47,420
vice UK vice. How care but that
we're so we're reading this folks,

1339
01:18:47,421 --> 01:18:50,270
if you hear those words, I
have not said that. Yeah.

1340
01:18:50,390 --> 01:18:54,230
I'm reading something off of a UN.
The title,

1341
01:18:54,460 --> 01:18:58,380
I'm not saying technically are,

1342
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:01,940
he did say everything
by Chinese towards it.

1343
01:19:01,941 --> 01:19:04,400
By far the worst tourist next day is,

1344
01:19:04,401 --> 01:19:09,270
I don't want to say this is real and
Russians tide. Why Israelis? [inaudible]

1345
01:19:10,110 --> 01:19:12,710
I'm bad. I'm bad. I'm missing
Australians. The bogans,

1346
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:16,910
ours garbage people serious. I have
fucking inflicted him into the world.

1347
01:19:16,911 --> 01:19:21,420
Like go learn on their turf. Wow.
Bogans row off. Why is just get drunk?

1348
01:19:22,250 --> 01:19:22,621
I don't know.

1349
01:19:22,621 --> 01:19:25,620
How can I get out of the army and they
think they can fucking go nuts. Yeah.

1350
01:19:25,670 --> 01:19:29,120
I don't know. But people don't like
Israeli tourists. Really? Yeah.

1351
01:19:29,121 --> 01:19:30,380
They got a reputation about him.

1352
01:19:30,650 --> 01:19:33,860
Didn't know that Americans
are way down the line. No.

1353
01:19:33,861 --> 01:19:38,140
Americans are not celebrated in a lot
of parts where you traveled to man.

1354
01:19:38,730 --> 01:19:41,810
Very celebrated a lot of who were
the only ones who tip consistently.

1355
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:46,040
Hardcore people like our money and the
ones who travel or not the fucking fat

1356
01:19:46,050 --> 01:19:50,900
rednecks gone and gone to the
world, but sometimes they are.

1357
01:19:51,390 --> 01:19:54,270
That's the church sometimes. So
there's a lot of merit. Saves.

1358
01:19:54,350 --> 01:19:59,030
Plenty of obnoxious Americans traveling.
Yeah, but we're not in this top five.

1359
01:19:59,090 --> 01:20:00,740
Really interesting.
I would have felt,

1360
01:20:00,741 --> 01:20:05,250
I would have assumed we'd
normally shitting at the
mall. I that's around town.

1361
01:20:05,320 --> 01:20:07,980
It's a big doors.
Is Insanity Dude,

1362
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:12,150
like for you to think that other
people are going to be like, oh yeah,

1363
01:20:12,160 --> 01:20:16,030
just got to take your shit too still
right here where it's like I gotta Piss it

1364
01:20:16,031 --> 01:20:17,400
public.
Things like block me,

1365
01:20:17,401 --> 01:20:21,090
make block me around the time
so you don't have to block me.

1366
01:20:21,091 --> 01:20:21,930
I'm just gonna shit real quick.

1367
01:20:22,710 --> 01:20:24,550
It's like we're in the
woods that I got to Piss I,

1368
01:20:24,580 --> 01:20:27,870
there's no like embarrassed I level.
That's how they feel. I didn't feel, dude,

1369
01:20:27,900 --> 01:20:32,730
they don't even worry about who cleans
it up. Let it stay there. Do they lie?

1370
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:37,570
There's no wiping. Everybody knew that.
If ever way you look to buy shit, ah,

1371
01:20:37,660 --> 01:20:42,540
Jesus. Oh wait, you're walking.
If you were to confront somebody,

1372
01:20:42,541 --> 01:20:44,460
like right after you look the fuck
did you just do, they'd be like,

1373
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:48,810
do you think that they would confront
you with like what you just got in your

1374
01:20:48,811 --> 01:20:50,130
car?
Like what

1375
01:20:51,990 --> 01:20:56,990
do you think that it's where they're
living is so overrun with people that they

1376
01:20:57,241 --> 01:21:00,060
just shit anywhere and they don't
think that anybody has an [inaudible]

1377
01:21:00,090 --> 01:21:00,601
environment.

1378
01:21:00,601 --> 01:21:04,780
Well now you're asking me to speak
with an expert and I will not lie,

1379
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:07,020
but this is all night
interpretation and yeah,

1380
01:21:07,021 --> 01:21:09,930
I think they have no
expectation of privacy because
they're so fucking on top of

1381
01:21:09,931 --> 01:21:12,510
each other.
Their homes extremely clean.

1382
01:21:12,511 --> 01:21:13,830
Take off your shoes
before you come inside.

1383
01:21:14,550 --> 01:21:18,670
The homes are fucking touching about
is this thing like mark? I'm not,

1384
01:21:18,680 --> 01:21:20,850
I'm saying main but
there's an on the mainland,

1385
01:21:20,851 --> 01:21:22,530
you know China is over a billion people.

1386
01:21:22,890 --> 01:21:27,890
So you have a lot of like really poor
Sean educated rural parts and like saying

1387
01:21:28,321 --> 01:21:30,570
that somebody in that area
does this. I'd be like, yeah.

1388
01:21:30,810 --> 01:21:35,460
Are you saying that like even somebody
that lives in Beijing or Shanghai who has

1389
01:21:35,461 --> 01:21:38,870
a job or Wall Street? No they don't.
No they don't. So that's why the tech,

1390
01:21:38,871 --> 01:21:42,540
not all mainlanders were shitting malls.
But if you see shit in the mall,

1391
01:21:42,570 --> 01:21:47,160
it's amazing man. Very clear. When
they say kids, what age group is it?

1392
01:21:47,161 --> 01:21:50,520
High school kids who were trying to
fuck or is it like just shit talk,

1393
01:21:51,980 --> 01:21:56,210
I'm trying to shut,
I wasn't in shock.

1394
01:21:56,220 --> 01:21:59,860
I was in Hong Kong, Singapore,
in Macau. So now the mechanical,

1395
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:01,140
what's funny is when you were in Macau,

1396
01:22:01,141 --> 01:22:05,700
which is obviously big casino kind of
tourist destination, all the people there,

1397
01:22:06,030 --> 01:22:09,440
they eyeball immediately who
they'll tell you who's like a,

1398
01:22:09,630 --> 01:22:12,660
a mainland Chinese person, you know,
cause they can tell by the, well,

1399
01:22:12,860 --> 01:22:15,930
that's a different type of thing
where if there's, if somebody is like,

1400
01:22:15,970 --> 01:22:20,970
do you see dudes in Macau in like Versace
shades and like a Fendi and Gucci and

1401
01:22:23,401 --> 01:22:28,380
like, I mean outfits, crazy
outfits and you're like, God,
what's up with that dude?

1402
01:22:28,381 --> 01:22:31,410
And they'll be like, that's just
a mainland dude who a new money.

1403
01:22:31,411 --> 01:22:35,340
He just got rich. Wow. It's all
over Macau. And we just know.

1404
01:22:35,550 --> 01:22:38,550
And then you see that the uh, the
understated person, they're like,

1405
01:22:38,551 --> 01:22:42,840
that's a Hong Kong guy. That's old money.
Yeah. Right. Oh it's like England almost.

1406
01:22:42,950 --> 01:22:46,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah. But you don't
like, you not like England.

1407
01:22:46,261 --> 01:22:48,230
They got guys that are like

1408
01:22:49,900 --> 01:22:54,270
this or like tracksuits and water.
And then you got the old posh money.

1409
01:22:54,660 --> 01:22:58,800
All right. All we can do
accents, accent, challenge.

1410
01:22:58,920 --> 01:23:02,750
[inaudible]

1411
01:23:02,940 --> 01:23:06,250
don't fucking side Florida.
What's up guys? And fertilizer.

1412
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:07,353
I got tornadoes.

1413
01:23:12,020 --> 01:23:16,940
Laurie. I'll say a country.
You do the accent without
saying the words. Okay. Okay.

1414
01:23:17,170 --> 01:23:20,080
Here we go. Russia don't say the
words. Just make the noises they make.

1415
01:23:24,990 --> 01:23:26,580
I'm not great at accents holes.

1416
01:23:28,770 --> 01:23:31,500
Oh, don't wish. Don't do
anywhere else. Any words?

1417
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:39,360
You just
heard it.

1418
01:23:40,180 --> 01:23:44,960
The Samurai speaking,
Sasquatch footage. No. No.

1419
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:48,740
One of the dumbest things that Duncan and
I did when we were doing that shot. No,

1420
01:23:48,760 --> 01:23:50,890
no, no. We went and studied bigfoot.

1421
01:23:51,100 --> 01:23:55,270
One of the dumbest things like Ari did
the show with me and one of the things

1422
01:23:55,271 --> 01:23:57,610
that we did when we studied bigfoot
was talked to a bigfoot expert.

1423
01:23:57,611 --> 01:24:01,690
Those plaintiffs, some audio and some
of the audio. It sounds like a Samurai.

1424
01:24:02,050 --> 01:24:06,130
It sounds like what the what and the
guy was claiming that this was like a

1425
01:24:06,131 --> 01:24:09,430
secret recording of big
foot. I'm like, you can ride.

1426
01:24:09,460 --> 01:24:12,580
It was the dumbest fucking thing I've ever
heard in my life. Anything. By the way,

1427
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:17,020
in your conspiracy theories
and like what you challenge,

1428
01:24:17,380 --> 01:24:21,910
was there anything that you ended up
going, oh, like, oh, good question.

1429
01:24:21,911 --> 01:24:24,880
Not Dumb. Yes, really more challenge.

1430
01:24:24,881 --> 01:24:28,660
Disease or shower Gel Jaylin's diseases.
A disease where people,

1431
01:24:28,690 --> 01:24:31,980
is it more challenges? I was called
[inaudible] thank you both for it. Yeah.

1432
01:24:32,020 --> 01:24:35,350
I thought it was bullshit before cause
I had read that it was bullshit and what

1433
01:24:35,351 --> 01:24:39,010
I read was that the people would think
that they had things grown out of their

1434
01:24:39,011 --> 01:24:42,940
skin so they'd be scratching themselves
and they would add fibers to their skin

1435
01:24:42,941 --> 01:24:44,860
and take pictures of it and say,
look,

1436
01:24:44,861 --> 01:24:49,800
I've got things growing out of my skin
and that, that it was a hoax. But um,

1437
01:24:49,900 --> 01:24:54,780
then talking to a doctor who had more
Jerilyn's who explained to me that there's

1438
01:24:54,790 --> 01:24:59,710
some sort of neurotoxic effect of Lyme
disease and that everyone who has more

1439
01:24:59,711 --> 01:25:04,110
challenge also has Lyme disease.
And he was a legitimate doctor in a,

1440
01:25:04,111 --> 01:25:08,470
in a very smart guy. And
he was essentially saying
that mainstream science,

1441
01:25:08,510 --> 01:25:12,340
it's rushed to prove he's going to Piss

1442
01:25:12,670 --> 01:25:17,670
[inaudible] he's already starting to be,

1443
01:25:19,680 --> 01:25:20,990
come on man.

1444
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:25,500
Yeah, but you're going to get us kicked
off of Youtube with your dick out balls.

1445
01:25:26,030 --> 01:25:28,820
Just cut straight to his day.
Anyway, what was I saying?

1446
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:34,130
That that is a real disease, that this
more jealous disease is what it is, is,

1447
01:25:34,131 --> 01:25:38,840
is Lyme disease, the, there's a bunch of
pathogens that come with Lyme disease.

1448
01:25:39,290 --> 01:25:42,830
You know, it's not just the Lyme disease,
it's not like a pure one, you know,

1449
01:25:42,831 --> 01:25:45,140
like one or a zero.
You have or you don't,

1450
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:50,320
it's a dirty tick as a bunch of fucking
horrible diseases inside of its nasty

1451
01:25:51,171 --> 01:25:53,480
little body. Would you know
if you had Lyme disease? Yes.

1452
01:25:53,570 --> 01:25:58,070
You get a bullseye like
well, like looking um, uh,

1453
01:25:58,190 --> 01:26:03,190
red mark around the area and the area
hurts and then you start experiencing

1454
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:03,980
terrible

1455
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:06,120
symptoms like flu,
like symptoms and okay.

1456
01:26:06,410 --> 01:26:09,810
You got to kind of bring up the re
supposed to catch it quick. Oh yeah.

1457
01:26:10,150 --> 01:26:12,530
On your show you want to brush his teeth.
And he's like,

1458
01:26:12,531 --> 01:26:14,960
he couldn't like go back and
forth. It was like, what the fuck?

1459
01:26:14,990 --> 01:26:19,010
My friend's kid got bell's palsy where
his face went and don't get me started on

1460
01:26:19,020 --> 01:26:20,760
my teacher that,

1461
01:26:20,860 --> 01:26:25,010
that had bell's palsy in high school and
they kept him out and then he came back

1462
01:26:25,430 --> 01:26:27,050
and he was okay bro. No. But he,

1463
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:30,410
he came back while he still
had the face paralysis.

1464
01:26:30,890 --> 01:26:32,660
We're all like looking at this dude.

1465
01:26:32,690 --> 01:26:35,780
We had a student a year older than
me or bell's Palsy and we mocked them

1466
01:26:35,990 --> 01:26:36,561
relentlessly.

1467
01:26:36,561 --> 01:26:41,561
Look very [inaudible],

1468
01:26:42,240 --> 01:26:45,740
haven't got it on stage,
on stage.

1469
01:26:45,770 --> 01:26:49,100
And his face started going on him and
he had to hold his cheek over to finish

1470
01:26:49,101 --> 01:26:52,460
his jokes that he called his brother in
law. He was, I think I'm having a stroke.

1471
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:54,470
I'm about to get on a plane and
I think I'm having a stroke.

1472
01:26:54,471 --> 01:26:57,260
The next morning his face was numb and
drooped in his brother in law goes,

1473
01:26:57,290 --> 01:26:58,520
go to the fucking doctor.

1474
01:26:58,521 --> 01:27:01,610
Right now you're having a 20 hour
stroke and it was bell's Palsy.

1475
01:27:01,910 --> 01:27:05,960
And so what did they do about
that? Nothing. Fucking nothing.

1476
01:27:06,380 --> 01:27:10,490
Just she just wait. Just wait. If
Tad it, dude, I get, I wake up.

1477
01:27:11,140 --> 01:27:14,810
Eddie if had it too. I think
it's a virus. You'd be good at it

1478
01:27:16,620 --> 01:27:20,860
because policy palsy every
fucking morning. Why? I

1479
01:27:23,700 --> 01:27:28,230
came home later that morning. Every
more ritual. Why you think of that?

1480
01:27:28,270 --> 01:27:30,890
It's my ritual. Every morning.
I got up early, I left,

1481
01:27:30,980 --> 01:27:34,880
I thought he was doing Stallone
impression. He said Bell's Palsy too.

1482
01:27:35,550 --> 01:27:38,390
He's got it when he was young and it
sometimes it doesn't go away. Whoa.

1483
01:27:38,780 --> 01:27:42,470
And so he wrote, so we're at about 40
moths. So is it affects the spelling or,

1484
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:48,620
yeah, I don't know if he knew
how to spell it doesn't help.

1485
01:27:48,740 --> 01:27:52,620
So basically I,
she looks better now,

1486
01:27:52,650 --> 01:27:54,980
so I hung out with him this weekend,
but uh,

1487
01:27:55,190 --> 01:27:59,720
so easy back on stage and he's back on
stage and he spent like three weeks in

1488
01:27:59,721 --> 01:28:03,380
his sister's basement just being like,
it's never going to come back.

1489
01:28:03,381 --> 01:28:04,910
My career's over.
I can't go on stage.

1490
01:28:04,911 --> 01:28:08,120
Like he tried to do a show and he said
everyone was just staring at it like this.

1491
01:28:08,121 --> 01:28:13,040
Like, oh, oh mom. So what
do they do to fix it?

1492
01:28:13,220 --> 01:28:16,250
Nothing. You just wait. You just
wait until it starts coming back.

1493
01:28:16,520 --> 01:28:20,950
He said reboot was like right your
your face. So you got to get code. Um,

1494
01:28:21,160 --> 01:28:23,850
so why do you think about this
every morning, dude? Yeah.

1495
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:25,910
Especially when I'm getting
ready for a special.

1496
01:28:25,940 --> 01:28:30,120
I think like what if I got bell's?
What if? What if I get jokes to tell?

1497
01:28:30,130 --> 01:28:33,110
The morning,
the morning of my special secret time,

1498
01:28:33,111 --> 01:28:37,700
I woke up and I smiled and I went, I
beat bell's Palsy. So first thought I had

1499
01:28:41,180 --> 01:28:44,510
Jesus Christ.
How am I involved in this conversation?

1500
01:28:45,230 --> 01:28:47,810
I can't believe I'm involved in
this conversation for bell's Palsy.

1501
01:28:47,811 --> 01:28:52,340
You know what else I forget? I think
of Alopecia, this hair falling answer,

1502
01:28:52,390 --> 01:28:54,970
everyone gets out every, there
was a hanging out. I was little.

1503
01:28:55,160 --> 01:28:58,790
Every comic at the store had it
burn, had it. I met, I met at it.

1504
01:28:58,820 --> 01:29:00,890
Everyone got it at one point
and I was just was like,

1505
01:29:01,050 --> 01:29:02,100
don't give all the hair fell

1506
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:06,690
out just in in a circle. Norman it
comics, get it. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

1507
01:29:07,020 --> 01:29:10,930
I'm had it and just trying to scratch
my head when I was a kid. Yeah.

1508
01:29:10,931 --> 01:29:13,660
I think about alopecia to Tyson had it.

1509
01:29:13,860 --> 01:29:17,970
Remember that's why he fought over and
Mike Tyson out of like a weird circle and

1510
01:29:18,350 --> 01:29:23,220
in his head for awhile. Yeah. Wait, you
said you were going to dominate earlier.

1511
01:29:23,490 --> 01:29:23,850
What do you do?

1512
01:29:23,850 --> 01:29:26,370
What you're saying through
like to dominate you gotta
give me the context again.

1513
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:30,180
I know when I get up.
You like dominating,

1514
01:29:31,410 --> 01:29:35,910
dominating life. Yeah. Crushed. You
have time to dominate because you don't,

1515
01:29:35,911 --> 01:29:37,700
you know on your phone.
That's what it was. Yeah.

1516
01:29:39,830 --> 01:29:42,160
I can masturbate multiple times
a day instead of just once.

1517
01:29:42,161 --> 01:29:45,840
Like you guys like the
lady though, right? Yeah,

1518
01:29:47,080 --> 01:29:51,320
Dude. Honestly guys, it might
not be this year. You're married,

1519
01:29:51,370 --> 01:29:54,000
social media stuff.
Your wedding is next.

1520
01:29:54,860 --> 01:29:59,760
You're going to take that out of your
deck deck. Gay Shit taped back up.

1521
01:30:00,280 --> 01:30:03,570
I'm going to be like,
I made it gets you out of rock.

1522
01:30:03,920 --> 01:30:07,650
I can't to shoot some hot ones into you.
I love you so much.

1523
01:30:07,890 --> 01:30:11,970
I got my Dick Fixed, got
on my pipes, reconnected.

1524
01:30:12,330 --> 01:30:14,130
They pulled a straw out of one of those.

1525
01:30:14,190 --> 01:30:18,330
We'll see turtle's noses and
they use it to fix my dick.

1526
01:30:18,331 --> 01:30:21,900
You know this drive video with the sea
turtles knows it's the most horrific

1527
01:30:21,901 --> 01:30:26,800
video. It's the reason why they
don't have plastics brought up.

1528
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:30,790
If you're like, why the fuck
do we have plastic cups? Lids,

1529
01:30:30,990 --> 01:30:33,560
why do we have plastic? You're going
to show water bottle. No, don't look,

1530
01:30:33,660 --> 01:30:35,160
why don't we have plastic straws?

1531
01:30:35,310 --> 01:30:39,450
The reason why is because there's a
fucking video of a turtle and they have a

1532
01:30:39,451 --> 01:30:41,010
clamp.
I don't know if this is the main reason,

1533
01:30:41,011 --> 01:30:45,450
but it is for a lot of people clamped
this straw in this turtle's mouth and they

1534
01:30:45,451 --> 01:30:49,160
eventually pulled it, pulled the turtle's
nose, rather it was deep in his nose.

1535
01:30:49,161 --> 01:30:53,010
So this, watch this. Yes, she can.
One of those. So see that's a,

1536
01:30:53,011 --> 01:30:56,970
that's a strong to tell you. They got
stuck in his seat. Turtle is harder.

1537
01:30:57,270 --> 01:31:01,380
It is so much harder to watch.
Things happen to animals into people.

1538
01:31:01,890 --> 01:31:05,730
How do we not know this wasn't a night
of cocaine gotten wrong? Look at that.

1539
01:31:05,731 --> 01:31:10,590
Poor Turtle. So he inhaled, oh
he's fucking good one. Oh fuck.

1540
01:31:10,591 --> 01:31:15,180
So they realized that the straw was stuck
and apparently this is not bleeding.

1541
01:31:15,440 --> 01:31:19,340
It's, this is not an unusual thing.
So they have to put up a wait,

1542
01:31:19,350 --> 01:31:22,530
what do they pull it out and tweets
or guy get a real tweezer guys scared.

1543
01:31:22,531 --> 01:31:24,810
He's scared and he's got,
he's got little hands too.

1544
01:31:24,930 --> 01:31:26,310
He's got little fucking tie hands.

1545
01:31:26,730 --> 01:31:29,310
Little bit shouts hands
grab it and pull them out.

1546
01:31:29,311 --> 01:31:32,730
This saving turtles assholes
about this person's hands.

1547
01:31:33,170 --> 01:31:37,320
Pour turtles going,
Jim Norton.

1548
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:42,300
Jim Norton's going, no, don't do it in
a pocket knife. Well that's all he's got

1549
01:31:44,760 --> 01:31:48,860
to get it out. I would bite it with my
face and I would pull it out with my neck.

1550
01:31:48,870 --> 01:31:51,720
Cause you're a warrior. If someone
holds fucking care about the animals,

1551
01:31:51,721 --> 01:31:55,050
I care about the animals. I'm a warrior
for sea creatures. Oh, there we go.

1552
01:31:55,080 --> 01:31:57,880
This has got to get it. This got
to right the fuck now he's got it.

1553
01:31:57,881 --> 01:32:01,050
He's got a leather man. Oh, that
is like, no, this guy is horrible.

1554
01:32:01,220 --> 01:32:04,840
It takes horrible. Never wanna play
operation was his guy. It takes time,

1555
01:32:04,841 --> 01:32:07,780
but it's worth it at the end. Oh, he's
trying to bite the shit. He's like,

1556
01:32:07,781 --> 01:32:10,780
what are you guys doing? To
me it was fine. It's better
before. Leave me alone. Oh,

1557
01:32:10,781 --> 01:32:12,460
he's bleeding out of his fucking nose.

1558
01:32:13,150 --> 01:32:15,910
How did they get the sea turtle in the
boats and notice in the first place,

1559
01:32:16,060 --> 01:32:19,930
guys stop being a bitch. Grabbed her to
stop. She stopped biting at goes here.

1560
01:32:19,931 --> 01:32:24,090
He goes, nope. Nope.
Lost it. Fucking pull it.

1561
01:32:24,091 --> 01:32:27,400
You just got to jet eventually gets
it. Eventually gets it. I swear to God.

1562
01:32:27,640 --> 01:32:31,360
Show me. Show him getting it.
There's still much more hard. Okay.

1563
01:32:31,361 --> 01:32:35,470
The video is almost done, so
this is what hard. Oh my God.

1564
01:32:35,471 --> 01:32:38,050
They're going to take that out and
they get a stick it in Ari's Dick.

1565
01:32:38,051 --> 01:32:39,860
Hold the fixes.
Broken pipe.

1566
01:32:41,590 --> 01:32:43,180
That turtle they should do.

1567
01:32:43,181 --> 01:32:47,280
They should recycle it and use that to
open up your Dick Pipe. The flu shots.

1568
01:32:47,910 --> 01:32:52,000
They take that rock out. That
calcified Dick Rock. Yeah.

1569
01:32:52,180 --> 01:32:53,550
Make it a nice ring.
Oh,

1570
01:32:53,630 --> 01:32:57,430
for the little lady that is really
with the romantic damn pipe.

1571
01:32:57,431 --> 01:33:00,730
With the actual tube that they
pulled out of that turtle's nose,

1572
01:33:00,810 --> 01:33:03,050
that there was a diamonds
in there to fix your dead.

1573
01:33:03,440 --> 01:33:06,010
Go ahead and get rolling
it out. Yeah, why not?

1574
01:33:06,160 --> 01:33:08,850
What if we each raise at
dire wolf like something like

1575
01:33:10,420 --> 01:33:11,270
someone's drunk.

1576
01:33:15,610 --> 01:33:18,820
Oh my God. It's funny guy to
leave my car here. Yeah, for sure.

1577
01:33:19,190 --> 01:33:20,320
Call your side if you want.

1578
01:33:20,440 --> 01:33:24,480
If a car here do we gotta we gotta fucking
get your car straight what we were,

1579
01:33:24,500 --> 01:33:26,740
but we're going to put like all
those jokes on the side of your car.

1580
01:33:27,030 --> 01:33:30,250

to laugh? Oh, that's right.
Yeah, we can do that. Yeah,

1581
01:33:30,260 --> 01:33:33,580
we're going to, you don't have a
car, so it's tough, but a rental car.

1582
01:33:34,330 --> 01:33:38,790
Brand new car sale. That number.
Yeah, of course. My little rap.

1583
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:40,690
Whatever happens through
what happens to it. Yeah.

1584
01:33:40,691 --> 01:33:42,820
We'll put a sober October
wrap on that bitch.

1585
01:33:43,720 --> 01:33:46,700
I said we all wrap our cars and
cars and sober October. Dude,

1586
01:33:46,710 --> 01:33:50,690

1587
01:33:51,030 --> 01:33:55,360
I wrapped his bus,
wraps up my face.

1588
01:33:55,390 --> 01:33:58,630
It's so much fun. I put my face
on everything. The bus champ.

1589
01:33:58,690 --> 01:34:02,380
I didn't even tell you. Are you the bus
champer as are the tour bus chip? No,

1590
01:34:02,381 --> 01:34:05,540
you're not. What are you doing?
Art lymes disease. What is that?

1591
01:34:05,550 --> 01:34:08,290
That's close to what's
happening is wrong with you.

1592
01:34:09,410 --> 01:34:14,380
Is that poison ivy? You got poisoned. Hey.
Oh, you know what I bet would help you.

1593
01:34:14,381 --> 01:34:18,100
I bet some CBD oil rubbed some CBD
oil on that. What am I a doctor?

1594
01:34:18,250 --> 01:34:22,750
How'd you get poison ivy on your
camping trip with Bobby? Yeah. Oh Dude.

1595
01:34:22,751 --> 01:34:26,440
Fuck down. Catch us. Fuck Kashi. Shut up.

1596
01:34:26,470 --> 01:34:30,040
That's what everybody was [inaudible]
kicked catch. You can't catch him.

1597
01:34:30,041 --> 01:34:33,730
I can't use that stuff. I was like,
no, catchy. I'm like, you sure?

1598
01:34:33,731 --> 01:34:38,590
Why are you coughing man? Yeah. Why
did the guy next to you start coughing?

1599
01:34:38,591 --> 01:34:40,720
So was way fucked up.
Thing about diseases too.

1600
01:34:40,721 --> 01:34:44,800
Like they try to spread themselves
like they tried to, yeah, like alien.

1601
01:34:45,850 --> 01:34:49,390
I did a meet and greet in Spokane and
I'm doing it and the guy next to me,

1602
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:53,130
the guy next guy rips his shirt off, puts
his arm around me and he was coughing,

1603
01:34:53,170 --> 01:34:56,470
burning on fire and I go, Whoa Bro,
you are hot. And he was like, yeah,

1604
01:34:56,471 --> 01:34:59,170
I've got a pretty bad fever.
[inaudible].

1605
01:34:59,940 --> 01:35:00,860
He's like,
yeah man,

1606
01:35:01,060 --> 01:35:04,570
me to think you're going to get it
to that is the perfect Burt fan.

1607
01:35:06,550 --> 01:35:11,210
Pretty bad fever and sick.
I wasn't going to get this giant fan,

1608
01:35:11,211 --> 01:35:13,580
but I'm taking my shirt off.
You're taking years off too,

1609
01:35:13,700 --> 01:35:16,430
and then he'd probably be
like, Hey, do you mind if we
kissed and bird be like, oh,

1610
01:35:17,250 --> 01:35:20,180
it's one of the things you'd remember
the other night we were talking,

1611
01:35:20,181 --> 01:35:23,360
I was drunk. I was talking about how my,
my inner dialogue is, you think I'm weak?

1612
01:35:23,660 --> 01:35:27,380
I would say, yeah, so one of the
ones is when guys go, hey man,

1613
01:35:27,410 --> 01:35:30,590
like it's always like a big Italian guys
picture you kissing me on the cheek,

1614
01:35:30,620 --> 01:35:34,220
kiss me on the fucking cheap. And I
always go, Nah man. Because in my head,

1615
01:35:34,280 --> 01:35:38,230
am I here? My brain does he think I'm
fucking week. I got to kiss me, kiss me.

1616
01:35:38,230 --> 01:35:41,750
The little teams, so buck
their coach, hey, I'm going
to look you fucking nipples.

1617
01:35:43,130 --> 01:35:44,180
I left them in their 20 [inaudible].

1618
01:35:45,070 --> 01:35:48,920
You run into a lot of weird people out
there with bells palsy for an hour.

1619
01:35:49,210 --> 01:35:51,260
Oh my God.
It'd be great.

1620
01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:55,190
You should get a shot botox in your
face for a month because that does work.

1621
01:35:55,220 --> 01:35:56,880
It's a good challenge.
I'm up for that challenge.

1622
01:35:57,020 --> 01:36:00,770
[inaudible] palsy challenge and raise a
where's awareness for both lady who shot

1623
01:36:00,771 --> 01:36:05,240
too much and it was like affected
her eyelid. Wow. Yeah. Be careful.

1624
01:36:05,241 --> 01:36:08,560
You get to the wrong doctor and they're
like, yeah, one more shot a little more.

1625
01:36:08,561 --> 01:36:12,380
And you're like, eh. During the
Mitsui [inaudible] smile at women,

1626
01:36:12,381 --> 01:36:13,880
just to make sure I'm
not having bell's palsy.

1627
01:36:14,300 --> 01:36:18,860
Imagine if your nose is running and you
even know to call them dumb. Oh my God,

1628
01:36:18,890 --> 01:36:22,010
Dude.
No,

1629
01:36:23,180 --> 01:36:26,470
I wouldn't mind a tiny face
tattoo. Yeah. This is what we do.

1630
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:28,910
We're gonna all get botox
so we can't move our face.

1631
01:36:29,120 --> 01:36:33,140
You don't have to do your act. Do you
have to do your act like Joan Rivers?

1632
01:36:33,390 --> 01:36:36,520
I like with a, with a frozen
expression through this a show.

1633
01:36:36,521 --> 01:36:39,990
I really start doing shit with our
voices and that's the only in you'll have

1634
01:36:40,030 --> 01:36:44,240
your house at all. He can't raise
your eyebrows at all. There's a show.

1635
01:36:44,241 --> 01:36:46,380
Rivers had bits about it. Really? Yeah.

1636
01:36:46,440 --> 01:36:49,100
She has so much plastic surgery
for new about our plastic surgery.

1637
01:36:49,120 --> 01:36:53,220
She can't hide it. It was like
she was, it was like a mask.

1638
01:36:53,221 --> 01:36:56,420
She looked like a surprise catfish.
That's what's his name's Joe said that,

1639
01:36:56,700 --> 01:36:59,330
who's the lawyer?
The lawyer drawled up

1640
01:37:01,340 --> 01:37:03,680
the best is when he told us he told uh,

1641
01:37:03,860 --> 01:37:07,470
flavor flave you look like a skeleton
with duct tape wrapped around him.

1642
01:37:10,300 --> 01:37:11,133
Um,

1643
01:37:12,290 --> 01:37:17,000
I forgot everybody challenging Bob's
or challenge. It should be hip hop.

1644
01:37:18,120 --> 01:37:18,891
We have another hour.

1645
01:37:18,891 --> 01:37:23,300
We have another I thought of when you
start getting a move down you're like, oh,

1646
01:37:23,330 --> 01:37:26,060
why? But so wait, what do you like?

1647
01:37:26,210 --> 01:37:29,900
It should be something that we can do on
the road because we're all gonna be on

1648
01:37:29,901 --> 01:37:33,220
the road barefoot running.
I'm telling you this,

1649
01:37:33,260 --> 01:37:35,330
it might not be this year and
it might not be next year,

1650
01:37:35,420 --> 01:37:38,610
but eventually you guys will
come into my idea of metal.

1651
01:37:38,760 --> 01:37:42,080
I have mental health
check with Joe was saying,

1652
01:37:42,081 --> 01:37:45,080
and I don't think this is a bad idea.
I'm saying Joe saying this,

1653
01:37:45,081 --> 01:37:47,030
obviously it is a conversation we had,
I don't know if you want to show this,

1654
01:37:47,031 --> 01:37:48,950
but he was saying we were
backstage and he was like,

1655
01:37:49,490 --> 01:37:52,370
it's not bad to do another
one of these halfway in.

1656
01:37:52,610 --> 01:37:56,170
So if you want to do
another like do like a May

1657
01:37:56,410 --> 01:37:59,640
Sobrato something with May and do for
you at home listening. Absolutely.

1658
01:37:59,641 --> 01:38:01,020
You should do that if on your own terms.

1659
01:38:03,420 --> 01:38:05,640
I'm cool with anything we decide.

1660
01:38:05,641 --> 01:38:09,270
I just think it should be hip hop
dancing and we should do it twice a year.

1661
01:38:11,550 --> 01:38:14,240
Okay. Just wait, wait, wait,
wait. One other thing. Shoot.

1662
01:38:14,550 --> 01:38:16,770
You were saying earlier
how your body moves,

1663
01:38:19,310 --> 01:38:23,760
so I want to know like are you flexible?

1664
01:38:23,761 --> 01:38:27,750
Are you super flexible? Very,
yeah. Showing how flexible
are you? Please do this.

1665
01:38:27,751 --> 01:38:30,130
We touched your hands behind your back.
Of course.

1666
01:38:33,720 --> 01:38:38,540
This way. Stupid behind Joe.
Can you, let's see it. Can
you, can you do the splits?

1667
01:38:38,850 --> 01:38:41,740
I can just split. Show us at the
table right now. Can you do a split?

1668
01:38:42,440 --> 01:38:45,620
He can do a split. He only buys jeans
that have like written. All right,

1669
01:38:45,621 --> 01:38:49,530
so let me show me how to do a split first
and then I'll show you if I can do a

1670
01:38:49,531 --> 01:38:52,470
split. Listen, I don't want
to get it a muscle pull,

1671
01:38:52,471 --> 01:38:55,910
so I'll go down as far as I can go
with same hours. Same here. Yeah,

1672
01:38:55,920 --> 01:39:00,150
you do the same. Why don't you guys
just save time and touched dicks now.

1673
01:39:02,080 --> 01:39:02,913
All right.

1674
01:39:04,790 --> 01:39:07,370
Okay. There we go. Nope. Nope. Oh fuck.

1675
01:39:08,740 --> 01:39:13,570
Oh my dick is about that far off the
ground and I think if he didn't have the,

1676
01:39:13,730 --> 01:39:15,440
I think if he didn't have jeans on the,
okay.

1677
01:39:15,500 --> 01:39:17,800
The gravity would take as thick all the
way to that. Okay. All right. All right.

1678
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:21,770
That's legit. Yeah, Bert. Yeah.
And you want me to go that far?

1679
01:39:22,010 --> 01:39:25,910
I want you to go farther if you can. So
now wait a minute. Pocket. Yeah, yeah,

1680
01:39:25,911 --> 01:39:28,400
for sure. Now, if I was
at the end of Yoga class,

1681
01:39:28,640 --> 01:39:31,230
I can definitely split.

1682
01:39:32,360 --> 01:39:35,550
You want me to go all the way down like
you did? Yes. Yeah. Okay. Ready, Bert?

1683
01:39:36,170 --> 01:39:38,230
Those pants are not even
designed for that. Guys.

1684
01:39:38,560 --> 01:39:40,330
Let's keep rolling.
Keep Rolling.

1685
01:39:41,420 --> 01:39:46,110
Took your shoes. That hurt. I'm
hurting myself. I got to tell you,

1686
01:39:46,410 --> 01:39:48,390
that was really close a lot for this.

1687
01:39:50,090 --> 01:39:54,600
This is the exact conversation we had all
month last October. We got a knee down.

1688
01:39:54,601 --> 01:39:58,260
That's pretty good. Fuck. Are you
saying man to look, here's the deal.

1689
01:39:58,320 --> 01:40:01,080
What's the deal?
I'm not going into sober October half ass.

1690
01:40:01,081 --> 01:40:03,150
I'm definitely charging every
one of you motherfuckers.

1691
01:40:03,300 --> 01:40:04,380
Just like I did last year.

1692
01:40:04,820 --> 01:40:08,490
You can't show up one of the shittiest
all time specials of all time with even

1693
01:40:08,491 --> 01:40:13,000
shittier. Yeah. You gotta like what
do you say something better saying no.

1694
01:40:13,240 --> 01:40:16,950
Whenever we decided to do, I'm still going
full tilt said you did that last year.

1695
01:40:17,070 --> 01:40:18,600
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1696
01:40:18,601 --> 01:40:22,800
Last year he was awful and
he's going to come back strong,

1697
01:40:22,890 --> 01:40:26,160
but he was saying he's going to come
after us like he did last year. I think

1698
01:40:29,510 --> 01:40:32,640
I'm drunk. Listen, hear me.
Okay. I'm going to talk shit.

1699
01:40:32,641 --> 01:40:37,620
I'm not gonna not talk shit
this year. Interesting. Okay.
No, it can't work anymore.

1700
01:40:37,621 --> 01:40:41,390
Right. But that's why when I do it
and they show affective Mickey Mantle,

1701
01:40:41,420 --> 01:40:45,680
not dead making is about it.
I ran it literally,

1702
01:40:45,710 --> 01:40:49,560
literally Mickey Mantle is acknowledge
that I have the Mickey Mantle Jean.

1703
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:53,550
She acknowledged it
makes time say like shit,

1704
01:40:53,600 --> 01:40:56,380
like managing what does that mean?

1705
01:40:57,380 --> 01:41:02,380
And my dad spoke at the memorial and
the Holocaust memorial and I so badly

1706
01:41:03,410 --> 01:41:07,720
wanted to talk about people who died of
disease and stuff like that that has a

1707
01:41:07,721 --> 01:41:09,670
lot of people and I wanted to yell out,

1708
01:41:09,730 --> 01:41:14,590
they didn't have the Mickey Mantle
[inaudible] my God, I did a,

1709
01:41:14,591 --> 01:41:15,401
I did a date,

1710
01:41:15,401 --> 01:41:20,140
I dunno recently and there was with the
promoters that you work with now and so

1711
01:41:20,141 --> 01:41:23,950
you work with like one promoter.
He's Bro. You've worked with,

1712
01:41:24,070 --> 01:41:27,550
you've worked with the
promoter. Yeah. Yeah. We all
do. Okay, keep going. So I was

1713
01:41:29,600 --> 01:41:32,770
not going to buy the one for motors.
What he's trying to say. Yeah.

1714
01:41:32,830 --> 01:41:35,560
The Mickey Mantle told Mickey went up.
It's like a single guy we got. Yeah,

1715
01:41:35,561 --> 01:41:39,800
we were hanging out with your girlfriends
like fucking, anyway, she's got one.

1716
01:41:41,710 --> 01:41:42,910
He's got this one guy,

1717
01:41:47,560 --> 01:41:51,370
he's got this one guy.
He can't get a call.

1718
01:41:51,371 --> 01:41:54,550
I guess I'm your promoter Bert.
Oh yeah.

1719
01:41:59,670 --> 01:42:00,880
I just want to tell Ya.

1720
01:42:01,120 --> 01:42:04,090
I heard Tom talking about the promoters
and it may be proud that I'm get

1721
01:42:04,091 --> 01:42:07,740
promoted. They fucking, I know
that there's someone else.

1722
01:42:08,870 --> 01:42:10,960
There was someone else you would,

1723
01:42:11,500 --> 01:42:14,500
I mean you wouldn't be that hurtful
that you would be referring to someone

1724
01:42:14,501 --> 01:42:19,410
else's. Your promoter. I start sweating.

1725
01:42:20,410 --> 01:42:25,220
I don't want to be, they brought up the
gene and they were like, I've done it.

1726
01:42:25,620 --> 01:42:28,900
I've done a bunch of dates with
him and I tried to hang out.

1727
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:33,760
No one can keep up. They're like, I
can't do it, man. Booze. Yeah. They like,

1728
01:42:33,761 --> 01:42:37,150
I can't answer that with very few people
can keep up with my pace on the road.

1729
01:42:37,151 --> 01:42:39,820
Mark Marin or Mark Mark Norman audits.
I was worried about,

1730
01:42:40,210 --> 01:42:42,620
I don't know if I can come up
and don't try to be normal.

1731
01:42:43,270 --> 01:42:47,440
He broke them fucking 40 days at nightly
try. I don't know. It's just, it's just,

1732
01:42:47,570 --> 01:42:50,980
I don't even notice already 12 no,
no, no, no. I'll say, why did he try,

1733
01:42:51,520 --> 01:42:55,420
why would he try to get you
both said you go on your pace,

1734
01:42:55,421 --> 01:42:58,030
just be with 100% it was that guy's name,
the promoter.

1735
01:42:59,250 --> 01:43:01,980
You're all one guy.

1736
01:43:06,110 --> 01:43:08,410
All right,
so

1737
01:43:10,150 --> 01:43:13,510
I think we all agreed that the surfing
challenge was too crazy, right?

1738
01:43:13,530 --> 01:43:18,330
I was dom [inaudible] idea.

1739
01:43:20,200 --> 01:43:25,200
I was thinking it might be a fun
idea that like the board no out.

1740
01:43:26,550 --> 01:43:29,220
But here's the thing, it's like I
don't live anywhere in New York.

1741
01:43:29,240 --> 01:43:31,540
Fucking you're going to be
in the and got your own shoe.

1742
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,780
You live near New York and
you live near La Long Beach,

1743
01:43:34,781 --> 01:43:38,170
but like you're going to be on the road.
Oh fucking whatever. Where do people,

1744
01:43:38,180 --> 01:43:42,290
we were dancing, art, dancing, dance.

1745
01:43:42,460 --> 01:43:45,570
I don't know why,
but a little bit fucking somewhere there.

1746
01:43:46,060 --> 01:43:48,850
Think about you walk on stage,
boom.

1747
01:43:48,880 --> 01:43:52,790
The lights come by you right?
Another way it comes down, right?

1748
01:43:52,880 --> 01:43:56,660
The music starts and you start boom,
boom, boom, and then be like, oh shit.

1749
01:43:56,960 --> 01:44:00,160
And then the, the beat breaks. And
you go into something else and you do,

1750
01:44:00,230 --> 01:44:04,880
you learn how to flip in this month.
No. You've already bought 45 minutes.

1751
01:44:04,881 --> 01:44:08,780
Lots of gift. Interesting. 25 terra Joe.

1752
01:44:09,570 --> 01:44:12,680
Interesting. You're in,
you bang out a split.

1753
01:44:14,590 --> 01:44:19,490
You guys are high. There's no way that get
us to be able to do splits in. Dude. I,

1754
01:44:19,491 --> 01:44:20,324
I gotta be dead honest.

1755
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:24,280
I really didn't think you could do a
split that's walking. I no, I didn't.

1756
01:44:24,281 --> 01:44:28,390
I well cause that's what I do. So yeah.

1757
01:44:29,020 --> 01:44:31,210
You really didn't think you could
do a split though. I didn't know.

1758
01:44:31,240 --> 01:44:34,270
I mean had to split a grown up
doing it splits tough. Yeah.

1759
01:44:34,510 --> 01:44:38,060
You got pretty not that close to you.
It was good. Do you think you'd be,

1760
01:44:38,061 --> 01:44:41,670
let's get some pictures of me doing the
split. Yeah. Multiple ones. Who's posting?

1761
01:44:41,850 --> 01:44:44,570
Can you sit criss cross apple
sauce and your legs. Art? Yes.

1762
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:47,920
Oh look at his toes.
Striding there. By the way.

1763
01:44:48,080 --> 01:44:52,950
Look spasming till the one picto
is way, way all ears. Yeah.

1764
01:44:53,080 --> 01:44:54,190
That's not what I'm doing.

1765
01:44:54,210 --> 01:44:59,100
I'm pulling my feet up so that I
can push down with my hips. Like,

1766
01:44:59,101 --> 01:45:03,430
I'm the Washington Post and the
other toes assume in a quadrant form.

1767
01:45:05,940 --> 01:45:10,300
Like I'm foreign language on this,
I'm doing this, I'm spreading.

1768
01:45:10,301 --> 01:45:13,420
If I spread my feet out like
more played out in quadrant,

1769
01:45:13,540 --> 01:45:16,570
lifting my toes up instead
of pointing them down.

1770
01:45:16,630 --> 01:45:19,930
That could be you at doing that
so I can lean in with my crotch.

1771
01:45:19,931 --> 01:45:24,670
So you stretch the abductor adductor
muscle guys, guys gymnastics.

1772
01:45:25,050 --> 01:45:25,883
Hmm.

1773
01:45:27,730 --> 01:45:30,670
Good luck. This guy breaks his hip every
time he fucking gets out of the shower.

1774
01:45:31,120 --> 01:45:35,650
Yeah, I would delay to try.
How's the Israeli gymnastics?
He can't do gymnastics.

1775
01:45:35,980 --> 01:45:38,590
He won't be able to do anything
with that hand for like a year.

1776
01:45:38,650 --> 01:45:42,880
They second squeeze a ball at about 19
months. Yeah. Are you serious? Wait,

1777
01:45:42,881 --> 01:45:44,860
where's your break? Where's
the break? It's okay.

1778
01:45:44,861 --> 01:45:48,810
So on this side it's the bone here.
Chipped off and just free falling.

1779
01:45:48,910 --> 01:45:52,450
[inaudible] it's Tom Petty there and the
other one on here that they have a up

1780
01:45:52,451 --> 01:45:56,650
con I can push in break that they're
normally only see in like young children.

1781
01:45:57,170 --> 01:46:00,430
Uh, I told him I a lot of gummy related
products and he goes, that might be,

1782
01:46:00,790 --> 01:46:03,700
that could be for sure. That could be
part of it. So two different breaks.

1783
01:46:04,060 --> 01:46:05,800
And this is from a fall or was it pretty?

1784
01:46:05,940 --> 01:46:09,070
It was pretty useful in one
children and young children.

1785
01:46:09,070 --> 01:46:12,650
They've unformed the bone. Dark,
dark, developing. It's like a,

1786
01:46:12,760 --> 01:46:15,490
it's like a compression pounds don't form,
right?

1787
01:46:15,700 --> 01:46:19,960
Possible break at 13
months. Yes. Our fold. Yeah.

1788
01:46:21,380 --> 01:46:25,020
Sorry, what already was hauling ass?
Okay. Gymnastics is out. Literally.

1789
01:46:25,140 --> 01:46:28,020
This is good challenge. Let's look
at this. And he broke his arm. Yeah.

1790
01:46:28,180 --> 01:46:30,970
Ski Challenge.
Fucking shredding shit in front of him.

1791
01:46:30,971 --> 01:46:33,310
Shutting the normal would be the
challenge if we had a ski challenge.

1792
01:46:33,311 --> 01:46:34,390
We couldn't do it in October.

1793
01:46:34,420 --> 01:46:37,510
I guess it was how much you
guys could eat my dust and a

1794
01:46:39,050 --> 01:46:41,680
black diamonds. Do you go down both
times? Yes. Yeah, sometimes. Yeah.

1795
01:46:41,681 --> 01:46:45,340
You like a legit skier? No,
I'll skip this for you. Ari.

1796
01:46:46,300 --> 01:46:47,710
Ari is already in the woods,

1797
01:46:47,740 --> 01:46:52,740
is fearless and he can go down
anything but it looks disgusting.

1798
01:46:53,790 --> 01:46:56,010
It's like,
it's like watching your parents fought.

1799
01:46:56,100 --> 01:47:00,990
It is like he snow plows the entire
time just like pizza pie like this,

1800
01:47:01,350 --> 01:47:06,190
but he hauls fucking ass. You
haul, ask no plan. Six hours.

1801
01:47:06,460 --> 01:47:08,910
The miles and hour Joe.
I see a bubble. I'm like,

1802
01:47:08,911 --> 01:47:10,950
I'm hitting there and I fucking jump.
Get Air.

1803
01:47:11,010 --> 01:47:13,170
That's why you're always
breaking things. Yeah. Yeah.

1804
01:47:13,530 --> 01:47:16,230
Couple of things you call a
call up your notes again. Yeah.

1805
01:47:16,231 --> 01:47:19,500
What do you need this to the
last note? I said dominate. Yeah.

1806
01:47:19,530 --> 01:47:22,560
Banks see broken.
What have you broken?

1807
01:47:22,561 --> 01:47:26,610
An ankle and a broke two years.
Tow chasing a dog.

1808
01:47:27,060 --> 01:47:29,520
That doesn't count.
That's something I poison ivy.

1809
01:47:30,260 --> 01:47:35,250
This as who's a sixth year?
Like a Badass gear Costa.

1810
01:47:35,460 --> 01:47:40,290
No, that promoted the Burt
word with [inaudible].

1811
01:47:46,810 --> 01:47:51,590
Ah. Oh my God. I'm gonna Pass.
Ah. Oh my God. We have to,

1812
01:47:51,610 --> 01:47:52,930
we have to figure what out,
man.

1813
01:47:53,180 --> 01:47:56,770
I really think that that direction I'm
going in with hip hop dancers the right

1814
01:47:56,771 --> 01:48:00,820
direction because it Joe, it puts you
on our plane field. What is your planes?

1815
01:48:00,970 --> 01:48:05,010
Hit play, dance explained to me this. No
one's playing field. They don't like it.

1816
01:48:05,011 --> 01:48:07,420
It's something someone's already done.
That's why even if I did this,

1817
01:48:07,421 --> 01:48:11,620
I would have to go further. I don't like
about the uh, hip hop dance challenge. No,

1818
01:48:11,680 --> 01:48:16,360
I liked that one. We play
that again. The running one.

1819
01:48:16,480 --> 01:48:18,790
Yeah. I feel like we already, we
already know how it's going to go.

1820
01:48:18,850 --> 01:48:20,250
We know how it's going to go dominate

1821
01:48:23,530 --> 01:48:27,270
true track miles. Is that
what we would do, right? Yes.

1822
01:48:27,300 --> 01:48:31,640
We get the rocks or no, it's going to go.
Yeah. So that's, that's the way, way down.

1823
01:48:31,710 --> 01:48:33,780
How do you guys think it's going to
go? No, there's just no thinking.

1824
01:48:34,870 --> 01:48:37,770
We already know how it's
going to go. Thank you. Nope.

1825
01:48:40,230 --> 01:48:44,430
Cycle over here would fucking do.
He'd logged. I'd be, which one?

1826
01:48:44,431 --> 01:48:45,470
2100 miles.

1827
01:48:46,650 --> 01:48:51,650
Everyone's going to die and then he weighs
a fucking buck 35 so halfway through

1828
01:48:53,220 --> 01:48:56,400
the month he'd be like, you know, I can
actually do 10 out of fucking chop now.

1829
01:48:58,950 --> 01:49:02,580
And then you'd break down and they
get mad at me for doing steroids.

1830
01:49:06,490 --> 01:49:10,500
He brought me up at the comedy store.
So that was the Lance Armstrong comedy.

1831
01:49:13,990 --> 01:49:16,810
There was so wrecked over
contest cause he was on steroids.

1832
01:49:16,940 --> 01:49:21,830
That was your introduction. Is that
what you said? The room just this comic.

1833
01:49:21,831 --> 01:49:22,460
So funny.

1834
01:49:22,460 --> 01:49:26,650
He wanna he want to fit fitness challenge
by on steroids with his friends.

1835
01:49:29,390 --> 01:49:33,280
I remember being with already when he
realized you were using steroids in the

1836
01:49:33,281 --> 01:49:37,000
car and he goes, not steroids,
testosterone replacement therapy

1837
01:49:40,030 --> 01:49:43,000
on top of that,
if I actually use steroids,

1838
01:49:43,030 --> 01:49:44,560
it would be even more ridiculous the way.

1839
01:49:44,561 --> 01:49:48,130
What do you fucking chick drinking
over here that will take it? Let's do

1840
01:49:48,130 --> 01:49:52,270
this.
I said we do an archery chairman now.

1841
01:49:52,990 --> 01:49:55,420
Hear me out.
Oh my God,

1842
01:49:57,250 --> 01:50:01,890
we could have the least amount of time
spent with your kids aren't wins. Uh,

1843
01:50:01,920 --> 01:50:06,310
I'd probably beat him.
Hang out with your kids.

1844
01:50:08,530 --> 01:50:12,850
Okay. I honestly, I'll, for
real, for real. No joke. I
don't mind the phone thing.

1845
01:50:12,851 --> 01:50:16,670
I'm stepping out catching on. I don't
mind the fitness hip hop challenge. Oh,

1846
01:50:16,750 --> 01:50:18,280
it would be a good weight loss thing.

1847
01:50:18,281 --> 01:50:23,281
Just the same as yogurt was like a
ridiculous thing about doing it to get you

1848
01:50:23,411 --> 01:50:27,840
actually want to lose weight. Huh? Lose
[inaudible] just tell you what you you,

1849
01:50:28,580 --> 01:50:29,413
yeah,

1850
01:50:29,440 --> 01:50:33,340
my skin and it's probably a lot of cause
the booze too and whatever else I do,

1851
01:50:33,370 --> 01:50:37,390
but like my skin looked good, I looked
good, I look good. I didn't hate the yoga.

1852
01:50:37,520 --> 01:50:38,680
Yeah. To be honest with you. For you.

1853
01:50:38,920 --> 01:50:41,470
I'll tell you that. Another component
you mentioned earlier that was,

1854
01:50:41,530 --> 01:50:46,530
I did this for like maybe 12 day stretch
at the end of the weight loss challenge

1855
01:50:46,600 --> 01:50:50,560
was nothing but water and that makes
you feel fucking amazing after it.

1856
01:50:50,570 --> 01:50:52,500
What do you mean?
Because I just wasn't,

1857
01:50:52,570 --> 01:50:56,530
we were doing the weight
loss battle battle and I just
didn't drink anything but

1858
01:50:56,531 --> 01:51:00,850
water for like almost two weeks and like
everything changes the way you look,

1859
01:51:00,851 --> 01:51:02,830
the way you feel.
Only drank water.

1860
01:51:03,130 --> 01:51:06,010
Terrible things dragging him right now.

1861
01:51:06,950 --> 01:51:10,900
Should see. I want to, I was making
a joke about my, my right arm,

1862
01:51:10,901 --> 01:51:14,230
just put shit in my body that I don't
want it to do is got a mind of his own.

1863
01:51:14,231 --> 01:51:16,900
He's just like, Yo, what the
fuck you doing? Asshole drinking.

1864
01:51:17,530 --> 01:51:22,120
Yeah. Diet coke, coke, orange
juice, anything but water. Right.

1865
01:51:22,150 --> 01:51:25,840
Most people. Yeah. I mean you're,
you're, you're usually for me,

1866
01:51:25,870 --> 01:51:30,190
I mean I can get by on a lot of
combination of coffee and water,

1867
01:51:31,700 --> 01:51:32,950
color,
water be fine.

1868
01:51:33,400 --> 01:51:36,400
I mean I still will have some other
things but I don't do it a lot. Jessica,

1869
01:51:36,480 --> 01:51:40,030
when you just do water though, we
you just drink water. You definitely,

1870
01:51:40,031 --> 01:51:43,000
after you get over the, what's
it called, like the, you know,

1871
01:51:43,090 --> 01:51:46,300
withdrawal or whatever. The other
thing is, you definitely feel good man.

1872
01:51:46,330 --> 01:51:49,860
I went a day without caffeine by the end
of the dad headache. I'll get, I get,

1873
01:51:49,880 --> 01:51:53,860
I remember that. I have a headache.
Yeah, me think I got a real headache,

1874
01:51:53,880 --> 01:51:56,560
which are all symptoms. Yeah,
that's exactly what it is.

1875
01:51:56,650 --> 01:51:58,750
I'm telling you not this
year, next year, whatever.

1876
01:51:58,780 --> 01:52:00,550
When when you do get off your phones,

1877
01:52:00,630 --> 01:52:03,730
you're going to have those same
withdrawal symptoms. No, you're right.

1878
01:52:03,790 --> 01:52:07,390
You're right. For sure. I got back on my
phone. I was on the tour bus off my phone.

1879
01:52:07,391 --> 01:52:09,280
We were texting about some
bullshit and then I was like,

1880
01:52:09,320 --> 01:52:14,140
I'm hopping on Twitter and I
got on Twitter and it just,
it became my life. Right.

1881
01:52:14,141 --> 01:52:19,090
Again, like it just, I like dipping. I
cannot dip tobacco. Why? Because if I do,

1882
01:52:19,120 --> 01:52:20,350
you're right back,
right back in.

1883
01:52:20,370 --> 01:52:24,070
Yeah. For a long time. Oh yeah.
Oh yeah. I miss it so much.

1884
01:52:25,410 --> 01:52:30,040
Florida. We'll do it to you. That's
why I started to it. But you drink.

1885
01:52:30,420 --> 01:52:33,590
But people who are dealing with after
you dipping's worse for you then,

1886
01:52:33,640 --> 01:52:36,690
then definitely not good for you.
Good for you.

1887
01:52:37,500 --> 01:52:40,590
I love that fucking burn right here.
Oh,

1888
01:52:40,770 --> 01:52:44,690
you slap people know you ain't thinking
that good. It's a nice little signal.

1889
01:52:44,720 --> 01:52:48,890
It's a, you got a big fat and
fat lip, a dip. You let them.

1890
01:52:48,891 --> 01:52:51,740
People know you're making a rash
and people know you're strong.

1891
01:52:51,770 --> 01:52:52,820
You're ready for anything.

1892
01:52:52,850 --> 01:52:56,840
Zach Galifianakis used to go on stage at
the Improv of the dip in his mouth did.

1893
01:52:56,870 --> 01:53:00,440
Anyways, Carolina got a
fucking, I swear to God,

1894
01:53:00,441 --> 01:53:03,680
he'd go on with a big dip and it's not
just spit and he tells the people that he

1895
01:53:03,681 --> 01:53:08,080
had didn't get [inaudible]
was so much fucking fun. Yeah,

1896
01:53:08,120 --> 01:53:11,590
he was a great though.
Miss him as a conduit is hilarious.

1897
01:53:11,740 --> 01:53:16,220
Did you see him at Brody's? Oh my God.
And Oh, he brought Brody at a party.

1898
01:53:17,750 --> 01:53:21,920
Nobody's calling. Jeez.
Probably past, yeah. I got

1899
01:53:23,440 --> 01:53:27,020
Zach to tack was amazing. And he
was, how exactly how king, yes,

1900
01:53:28,140 --> 01:53:31,640
but go ahead. No, his, I
mean, his stand up was,

1901
01:53:32,390 --> 01:53:36,490
it was all amazing. I used to love
watching him super tight with Brody,

1902
01:53:37,490 --> 01:53:40,520
Miss Air Jack, my wife. My wife
doesn't think anything's funny.

1903
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:44,540
Zach Alpha next had a joke that I, to
this day, I think is just a great joke.

1904
01:53:44,810 --> 01:53:45,860
You know,
it's time to get lunch.

1905
01:53:45,920 --> 01:53:48,290
You know it's time to do laundry when you
get out of the shower and dry off with

1906
01:53:48,291 --> 01:53:52,820
the shoe to fucking just great.

1907
01:53:53,480 --> 01:53:55,970
Then I'll never forget where he was. Like
dork fabrics, like, what's your name?

1908
01:53:55,971 --> 01:53:59,870
Joe called and it's like, uh, what,
what's your name, Bert? Fuck you.

1909
01:54:02,720 --> 01:54:07,380
I don't know where at the Improv
go. Paul Shat. He was funny.

1910
01:54:07,381 --> 01:54:10,400
It was at Brody's ceremony. Not as funny.
He's Jeff Roberts, Jeff Ross, Jeff Ross,

1911
01:54:10,920 --> 01:54:13,400
Mike God. Jeff. Well Jeff, but,

1912
01:54:13,430 --> 01:54:18,290
but well Zach's was like touching and
sweet and funny and it was like everything

1913
01:54:18,291 --> 01:54:23,291
you'd want at Ross just came up there
and just see everybody was so kind of,

1914
01:54:23,360 --> 01:54:26,150
you know, sad, intense
and emotional opened.

1915
01:54:26,480 --> 01:54:29,600
His opening joke was so
savage and hilarious.

1916
01:54:29,630 --> 01:54:34,010
Brody's Brody's Brody's high school
friends had gone up like seven of them and

1917
01:54:34,011 --> 01:54:37,500
their school and then friends from
baseball, like telling all these like,

1918
01:54:37,520 --> 01:54:38,410
so there was,
you know,

1919
01:54:38,450 --> 01:54:42,230
you see Zach and then like three of
these friends and then another comic and

1920
01:54:42,231 --> 01:54:45,560
then like three of these friends. And
then Jeff just went up and he goes, uh,

1921
01:54:46,130 --> 01:54:46,341
you know,

1922
01:54:46,341 --> 01:54:50,390
after hearing so many of Brody's high
school friends come up and speak about

1923
01:54:50,391 --> 01:54:51,890
them,
I know why he killed himself,

1924
01:54:54,960 --> 01:54:57,630
the place of just his body.

1925
01:54:58,860 --> 01:55:03,560
He had to wait like 30 seconds to talk
cause everybody just fucking, it was easy.

1926
01:55:03,610 --> 01:55:06,880
It was much.
That's the,

1927
01:55:07,460 --> 01:55:09,590
that's what really comedy is best at.

1928
01:55:09,680 --> 01:55:12,590
Definitely Jeff is,

1929
01:55:12,800 --> 01:55:17,700
he's so good at so yeah,
that's his world.

1930
01:55:18,980 --> 01:55:22,430
Boston the best. He's
the best at it. Yeah.

1931
01:55:22,820 --> 01:55:27,530
Fuck so no hip hop dancing boys.
But I don't know dude. I honestly,

1932
01:55:28,050 --> 01:55:29,300
what you're going to see Joe,

1933
01:55:29,301 --> 01:55:32,510
is you're going to see an onslaught
of people online going to Joe hip hop

1934
01:55:32,511 --> 01:55:34,580
dancing, thought about I, this
is where you and I differ.

1935
01:55:34,581 --> 01:55:38,480
I'm not going to see shit.
That's why I'm so happy.

1936
01:55:38,481 --> 01:55:42,170
Go ahead and give him positive
and locking. Let me see.

1937
01:55:42,171 --> 01:55:44,040
Pop and lock to pay its way out the door.

1938
01:55:44,270 --> 01:55:48,010
You ain't got to like vanilla ice.
Hey,

1939
01:55:48,200 --> 01:55:52,920
take my care much about that with you.
Ah,

1940
01:55:53,640 --> 01:55:57,830
so it should be something that none
of us are happy with. Not at all.

1941
01:55:57,840 --> 01:56:00,840
I'm not happy with this show.
I think,

1942
01:56:01,520 --> 01:56:06,300
I think the fun thing about Chubb
Rocktober when we first did it was that we

1943
01:56:06,301 --> 01:56:09,610
were all miserable together. Joe
Wasn't so miserable, but like me,

1944
01:56:09,630 --> 01:56:12,200
you and Tom would all just
commiserate. That was fun. Well,

1945
01:56:12,270 --> 01:56:16,710
I didn't like being sober. It was weird
and uh, I didn't like, um, the, uh,

1946
01:56:16,711 --> 01:56:18,820
the weird dreams and I was having,
when I was going through Tfa,

1947
01:56:18,880 --> 01:56:23,220
THC withdrawals when my rem sleep was
kicking in, that's what I've realized.

1948
01:56:23,221 --> 01:56:26,970
That t that TAC definitely
suppresses rem sleep. Definitely.

1949
01:56:26,980 --> 01:56:31,200
You think it does 100%. It's proven. It's
proven. It does. It does something weird.

1950
01:56:31,201 --> 01:56:34,720
Your sleep and a math doctor,
Matthew walkers,

1951
01:56:34,750 --> 01:56:38,390
a sleep doctor. It's best
way to describe it. Right?

1952
01:56:39,030 --> 01:56:43,390
So I listen to that podcast, crazy
podcast, but you know, he did,

1953
01:56:43,470 --> 01:56:46,230
you talked about it. The mechanism,
like what, what THC does,

1954
01:56:46,410 --> 01:56:47,320
it helps people go to sleep,

1955
01:56:47,321 --> 01:56:50,670
but there's certain parts of the
sleep that you're not getting booed.

1956
01:56:50,671 --> 01:56:55,320
I'd love to. There's an officer, there's
an argument that, that not getting it,

1957
01:56:55,630 --> 01:56:57,880
that not getting that sleep is okay.
That you're,

1958
01:56:57,881 --> 01:56:59,730
you're getting plenty
of sleep because you're,

1959
01:56:59,731 --> 01:57:03,720
you're the reason why THC puts you in
that dream. You recovering and you get,

1960
01:57:04,140 --> 01:57:07,110
there's an argument that somebody made
online that, I don't know if it's correct.

1961
01:57:07,111 --> 01:57:11,670
Some someone wrote an article about it
that, that that is okay to not get that.

1962
01:57:11,830 --> 01:57:12,301
That's a good point.

1963
01:57:12,301 --> 01:57:15,420
Whatever kind of sleep that came from
the THC or let's see who can sleep the

1964
01:57:15,421 --> 01:57:18,360
most in October. I think leave
that idea. Love that idea.

1965
01:57:19,010 --> 01:57:22,470
Most of the hours sleep and
you take ambien. No, no, no.

1966
01:57:23,130 --> 01:57:27,330
Do you take anything to go to sleep? No.
I'll take a Xanax every now and then. My,

1967
01:57:27,350 --> 01:57:29,250
my cardiologist told
me never to take them.

1968
01:57:29,670 --> 01:57:32,400
So I'll get a prescription for 30
for a year and I won't use them.

1969
01:57:32,490 --> 01:57:36,570
He tells you never take them
cause I take 30 no, no, no.

1970
01:57:36,571 --> 01:57:39,900
He gave me a prescription. But you
didn't use it. He goes, I'll take them.

1971
01:57:39,901 --> 01:57:41,880
They melt your brain. Oh my God. Yeah.

1972
01:57:42,390 --> 01:57:44,740
You know what's so funny is they
do melt your brain. You can tell.

1973
01:57:44,780 --> 01:57:48,650
So if you take one the next two days,
you know when you're young,

1974
01:57:48,720 --> 01:57:51,400
I remember morning radio, like old
school morning radio. When you go in,

1975
01:57:51,430 --> 01:57:52,200
you have to be on,

1976
01:57:52,200 --> 01:57:56,270
on to go to the next subject and slide
your joke in and you're like leaving and

1977
01:57:56,271 --> 01:57:59,760
going, God damn and I'm
sharp. Take a Xanax and that
doesn't happen for two days.

1978
01:57:59,880 --> 01:58:03,160
You can't jump in and conversation
like that. Oh Wow. So I won't fuck.

1979
01:58:03,210 --> 01:58:05,880
I noticed it because I was taking them
and I just stopped and I was like, Oh,

1980
01:58:05,881 --> 01:58:09,030
I'm a lot sharper.
Just fucking nothing.

1981
01:58:09,090 --> 01:58:11,970
So like if you would go on stage
and have to ad Lib something,

1982
01:58:12,150 --> 01:58:14,770
you just wouldn't have it in. Yeah. First
time I ever took one I got on a plane.

1983
01:58:14,771 --> 01:58:17,790
I'm thinking, cause I used to have a drink
on the plane and start writing jokes.

1984
01:58:18,150 --> 01:58:21,300
I took a Xanax and all these are going
to flow out of me and I just sat there

1985
01:58:21,301 --> 01:58:24,690
staring at the paper going
like my brain's turned off.

1986
01:58:25,110 --> 01:58:29,370
All the fucking scary thoughts are
gone. Fuck taken. What? Xanax? Yeah,

1987
01:58:29,850 --> 01:58:32,790
that's a great one. I believe I
have to pee again for real. Yeah.

1988
01:58:32,791 --> 01:58:35,160
I do too many podcasts in a row.
We'll I do two in a row.

1989
01:58:35,190 --> 01:58:38,070
I drank like 18 bottles of water.
I'm in love with lamps,

1990
01:58:38,071 --> 01:58:39,390
Armstrong's fucking coffee.

1991
01:58:40,010 --> 01:58:43,340
It's Laird Hamilton's quality coffee.

1992
01:58:43,500 --> 01:58:48,340
[inaudible]
coffee I've ever had.

1993
01:58:48,400 --> 01:58:53,110
How's he? So it's, it's
actually as an r in there.

1994
01:58:53,140 --> 01:58:55,210
Turmeric, turmeric, turmeric
and what else is it?

1995
01:58:55,240 --> 01:58:57,060
I didn't know it at an r in
there until like a week tomorrow.

1996
01:58:57,240 --> 01:59:00,090
It's always sounds like tumeric.
That's, I thought it was termed rubric.

1997
01:59:00,160 --> 01:59:03,640
I thought it was too Marette. Yeah, come
by in the morning. Coffee and take off.

1998
01:59:03,641 --> 01:59:07,180
Is that cool? Yeah. Yeah. Anytime. So
good luck. Yeah. Cool. Yeah, let's,

1999
01:59:07,190 --> 01:59:09,610
let's put parameters around them because
there's so many times I want to come

2000
01:59:09,611 --> 01:59:13,060
over here and just do bench press for
anytime you want. Where Road here? Yes.

2001
01:59:13,240 --> 01:59:17,320
Joe says every once in awhile, several
take advent. He'll be like, whatever,

2002
01:59:17,350 --> 01:59:19,240
come to UFC or whatever you
want that someone would be like,

2003
01:59:19,300 --> 01:59:21,420
can I get every single one this year?
Like fog.

2004
01:59:22,440 --> 01:59:25,840
But that's a [inaudible] have
been people who do abuse things.

2005
01:59:26,110 --> 01:59:29,260
Like I've had people to say, hey man, I
want to come to the UFC. Oh yeah, sure.

2006
01:59:29,470 --> 01:59:30,990
Can I get eight tickets?
Like,

2007
01:59:32,060 --> 01:59:35,550
hey for eight fucking tickets now.
Fine.

2008
01:59:35,860 --> 01:59:37,330
I wish there was a gym membership here.

2009
01:59:38,040 --> 01:59:41,570
What to Rug in enterprise and let
me know. Let me know and I know, but

2010
01:59:44,050 --> 01:59:47,710
you can do it at what? Journal? Podcasts.
Like the guys, the security guys,

2011
01:59:47,711 --> 01:59:51,110
they work out. Just go work out and
see them on there. It's like fuck it.

2012
01:59:51,120 --> 01:59:53,530
It's like watching alien here. What do
you like? Where are they in the ship?

2013
01:59:53,600 --> 01:59:58,170
You can like see them everywhere.
It's so cool here, man. Rad. Dude,

2014
01:59:58,300 --> 02:00:01,660
I want to create this for
myself. You can. I'll help you.

2015
02:00:02,260 --> 02:00:06,780
I'm talking to my promoter about
it. That guy, what's his name again?

2016
02:00:06,880 --> 02:00:10,540
Roger. Gotcha. He's a great guy. His name.

2017
02:00:17,590 --> 02:00:21,670
Oh, you know what? This place
was missing a gun range.

2018
02:00:21,790 --> 02:00:23,470
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

2019
02:00:23,471 --> 02:00:27,000
I'm going to go to one like one of them
gun ranges where the fucking paper comes

2020
02:00:27,001 --> 02:00:28,870
out. Yeah, we do. There's a,

2021
02:00:29,950 --> 02:00:34,450
there's a place here that does a,
what's it called? Laser tag? No, no, no.

2022
02:00:34,570 --> 02:00:39,220
I placed it does, what's it called that
does a training. Tactical training.

2023
02:00:39,221 --> 02:00:43,720
Yeah. Watts. You're going
[inaudible] going. Yeah,

2024
02:00:43,721 --> 02:00:47,170
and Simi Valley. You guys want to come?
Yeah, I think that might be the place

2025
02:00:48,730 --> 02:00:51,820
to go training. That might be
any of that. But that's it. Yeah.

2026
02:00:51,821 --> 02:00:55,120
Reggie and I are going to do it and then
we're going to do a podcast afterwards.

2027
02:00:55,210 --> 02:00:58,530
So did he invite you to do it at Reggie's
from Montana? You know, he's like,

2028
02:00:58,660 --> 02:01:01,120
he knows God. Can I tell you something?
Have you ever seen him perform live?

2029
02:01:01,240 --> 02:01:05,480
It's crazy. His music just perform.
Yeah. Just like on a 13 him,

2030
02:01:05,640 --> 02:01:06,970
you ever see him do a show?
Crazy.

2031
02:01:07,240 --> 02:01:12,100
You will feel like what you
do is nothing is not a talent.

2032
02:01:12,310 --> 02:01:17,290
Like is not as skilled. I'm not kidding.
Yeah, I've seen, I saw this dude do a,

2033
02:01:17,650 --> 02:01:21,410
this is years ago. This is like
at least seven years ago. Yeah.

2034
02:01:22,180 --> 02:01:27,180
Maybe eight years ago he did that 10
at most 15 minutes set and it was so

2035
02:01:31,061 --> 02:01:35,470
unbelievable that he got a,
like a prolonged standing ovation.

2036
02:01:35,580 --> 02:01:40,040
I fucking 10 minutes set
like, you know crazy. Your 10

2037
02:01:40,040 --> 02:01:42,530
minutes set has to be,
what was he doing dude?

2038
02:01:42,531 --> 02:01:47,120
He was like just improvising songs
on the spot and then you know, he,

2039
02:01:47,190 --> 02:01:50,960
he would do that thing where he would
make a certain sound and then with the

2040
02:01:50,961 --> 02:01:54,080
machine you tap it and then
loops and then start building it.

2041
02:01:54,110 --> 02:01:57,530
And he would do that and then he would
just have like a funny aside about

2042
02:01:57,531 --> 02:02:01,460
something then take it back. But the,
the songs he was building in the moment,

2043
02:02:01,461 --> 02:02:06,140
we're so like, it wasn't like he
was going like, you like that.

2044
02:02:06,141 --> 02:02:10,550
I mean it was like a full orchestra. Yes.
And it was like you see it and you go,

2045
02:02:10,551 --> 02:02:14,450
there's something about musicians that
when you can see a certain musician where

2046
02:02:14,451 --> 02:02:17,690
you like, you don't view a
comedian where you go like,

2047
02:02:17,780 --> 02:02:22,520
oh my fucking God, I cannot believe
the level of talent to that person.

2048
02:02:22,790 --> 02:02:24,950
You might think they're
really funny or laugh a lot,

2049
02:02:25,190 --> 02:02:28,170
but you're not going to be
like, I've never seen something
like that. Right, right,

2050
02:02:28,171 --> 02:02:28,881
right.
With music,

2051
02:02:28,881 --> 02:02:32,690
I think that that can happen and
he's that everybody up at Bonnaroo,

2052
02:02:32,691 --> 02:02:37,050
a place where everybody was bombing,
just attend. It's not for comedy anyway.

2053
02:02:37,250 --> 02:02:40,860
Got Everybody on their feet. Like he
just has a power. Yeah. He's like,

2054
02:02:40,880 --> 02:02:43,180
he's like that. Yeah. Super Nice guy too.

2055
02:02:44,020 --> 02:02:47,090
But you're super [inaudible]
puts you in the crowd.

2056
02:02:47,091 --> 02:02:48,740
Like it was not talking to you.
You're just,

2057
02:02:49,040 --> 02:02:52,730
you're also like now you're standing up
and doing whatever. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2058
02:02:53,080 --> 02:02:56,580
I talked to somebody that went on a tour
with him like around that time and it

2059
02:02:56,581 --> 02:03:00,680
was like four, four of them a night, you
know, like doing like 10 cities together.

2060
02:03:00,681 --> 02:03:02,990
And I was like, what order did
you guys pick? He was like,

2061
02:03:02,991 --> 02:03:03,830
what do you fucking think

2062
02:03:05,360 --> 02:03:08,290
last fall?

2063
02:03:08,750 --> 02:03:13,210
Someone who's like really good at
music. Cause if I go just talk. Yeah.

2064
02:03:15,160 --> 02:03:18,380
They used to have a problem with that,
with middle acts like that.

2065
02:03:18,470 --> 02:03:22,490
That was one of the things
that happened with um, with uh,

2066
02:03:22,850 --> 02:03:27,500
Mitch Hedberg said Mitch Hedberg was on
the road and he had the Middle Act was a

2067
02:03:27,501 --> 02:03:31,540
guy was doing like wraps. He had
like wraps and songs and sync things.

2068
02:03:31,541 --> 02:03:33,140
He would sing and he was crushing.

2069
02:03:33,470 --> 02:03:38,240
And then Hedberg we're going afterwards
and Edward's like super deadpan and that

2070
02:03:38,241 --> 02:03:42,860
is the worst scheduling ever.
Like who fucking book?

2071
02:03:42,990 --> 02:03:47,990
Do you ever have a Middle Act who in a
club who just stayed in middle act but

2072
02:03:48,231 --> 02:03:53,231
for like 15 years but became super
proficient at doing 20 minutes and you're

2073
02:03:54,081 --> 02:03:57,410
like all that stress I can do.
Oh yeah,

2074
02:03:57,630 --> 02:04:00,770
it'd be like a guy who was like,
you know, he became an older guy.

2075
02:04:00,771 --> 02:04:03,670
You know what I'm talking about?
Oh Man. But it's like two days.

2076
02:04:04,180 --> 02:04:08,060
Johnson, Roy Johnson, Roy [inaudible].

2077
02:04:08,570 --> 02:04:11,820
I don't think he's not standing anymore.
What's your promoters?

2078
02:04:12,930 --> 02:04:17,930
[inaudible] was a Munster all stage in
Tampa and you could no fucking follow

2079
02:04:18,991 --> 02:04:21,930
that guy.
He was a monster.

2080
02:04:21,931 --> 02:04:25,410
He quit doing comedy celled
cars and Tulsa now. Yeah,

2081
02:04:26,460 --> 02:04:30,480
he was. You could not the bottles
that mother fucker saved Tripoli,

2082
02:04:30,960 --> 02:04:35,960
Tripoli and him had beef because they did
a show together and there was a secret

2083
02:04:36,181 --> 02:04:38,130
shopper in, in the audience. He's hired

2084
02:04:38,130 --> 02:04:39,960
secret shoppers to rate the community.

2085
02:04:39,990 --> 02:04:44,990
Tampa and then Roy Roy aid,

2086
02:04:45,300 --> 02:04:48,930
I mean, yeah, no, he does. I remember
I had him, he was a hard guy to Paul.

2087
02:04:48,931 --> 02:04:51,750
You've worked with them and to those guys
like I'm better than the headliner and

2088
02:04:51,751 --> 02:04:54,280
you're like, dude, I can't
disagree with you 100% right. Yeah.

2089
02:04:54,630 --> 02:04:57,030
Well that's usually the things don't
go right when you're keyed into that,

2090
02:04:57,031 --> 02:05:00,150
like why don't you get in and on Thursday
you see that it definitely raises your

2091
02:05:00,151 --> 02:05:02,760
game for the whole weekend.
Yeah, for sure. Oh for sure.

2092
02:05:02,960 --> 02:05:04,710
Because you'll see it and
that guy will have that.

2093
02:05:04,711 --> 02:05:06,900
He'll be the guy that stayed in that city.
Fuck.

2094
02:05:06,901 --> 02:05:10,020
Did he quit and start selling cars?
If he's that funny,

2095
02:05:10,050 --> 02:05:14,490
cause it was a feature [inaudible]
on the head. He probably,

2096
02:05:14,520 --> 02:05:16,100
he probably,
if I remember,

2097
02:05:16,101 --> 02:05:19,470
I probably didn't start at like 20
or 22 and he was a little older.

2098
02:05:20,350 --> 02:05:24,900
What kind of also it's like wanting to
stay in town. Well I think, I think,

2099
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:28,920
I don't know, relationship always make
it happen, Tom Friends with Roy. But no,

2100
02:05:28,921 --> 02:05:32,760
I think that it was the thing that
you get addicted to murdering. Mm.

2101
02:05:32,790 --> 02:05:36,360
And you don't grow past
murdering and you don't go like,

2102
02:05:36,361 --> 02:05:39,630
I'm going to go up and take
chances. Someone above the
headline or off stage. No,

2103
02:05:39,631 --> 02:05:42,060
I'm not shitting on Roy,
but he just destroyed.

2104
02:05:42,390 --> 02:05:44,500
But I don't think he ever
took the chance was like,

2105
02:05:44,501 --> 02:05:46,590
I'm going to go out and bomb tonight
and see if I can figure something out.

2106
02:05:46,650 --> 02:05:49,110
You know? I think that's ultimately
what happens with the features.

2107
02:05:49,170 --> 02:05:52,000
There's a lot of the men I
worked with all of them. Yes.

2108
02:05:52,050 --> 02:05:56,560
Some pro features for sure. And prophy.
I had one, I remember who he was. Uh,

2109
02:05:56,790 --> 02:05:57,150
he,

2110
02:05:57,150 --> 02:06:02,150
he's the story of the guy
who was headlining in those
clubs for like a decade or

2111
02:06:02,611 --> 02:06:06,080
more. Didn't like break out,
break out, but obviously it was,

2112
02:06:06,110 --> 02:06:08,940
he was like a proficient
comedian then like you know,

2113
02:06:08,941 --> 02:06:12,120
has like always has like somebody has
like personal stuff happen and then it's

2114
02:06:12,121 --> 02:06:13,920
like family stuff and you know,

2115
02:06:13,921 --> 02:06:16,200
for whatever reason then
they're like still in it.

2116
02:06:16,230 --> 02:06:20,460
But now they've been doing it like 25
years and then just needed to work.

2117
02:06:20,461 --> 02:06:22,830
So it would take middle weeks.
I mean,

2118
02:06:22,831 --> 02:06:26,520
you know those dudes would
fucking hurt you. Oh yeah. Dude,

2119
02:06:26,700 --> 02:06:30,030
for sure guys who really knew how to
crush knows basically they knew local

2120
02:06:30,031 --> 02:06:31,710
references and then they're just like,

2121
02:06:31,711 --> 02:06:33,630
and they've been doing it for
imagine 25 years and they're like,

2122
02:06:33,631 --> 02:06:37,860
just do 20 and and do it for like 10
weeks in a row of those things are

2123
02:06:37,910 --> 02:06:41,370
assassins foster care. If you're
tired of the material that I was like,

2124
02:06:41,371 --> 02:06:45,990
I'm sure kill, kill, kill your cocktails.
Yeah. The Boston guys for sure,

2125
02:06:45,991 --> 02:06:47,730
because those guys do 15 to 20 a night.

2126
02:06:47,820 --> 02:06:50,460
They do 1529 and then they
would do it like three times.

2127
02:06:50,770 --> 02:06:55,480
I'm in a row and then bring up
Billy crystal flip. I'm not joking.

2128
02:06:55,481 --> 02:06:59,770
Like Billy crystal ain't shit. Next calm.
He stopped that way. A lot of guys did.

2129
02:06:59,950 --> 02:07:02,020
They set them up.
It's rude.

2130
02:07:02,410 --> 02:07:06,280
They set up these like big name headlines
because Dale in a lot of it was like

2131
02:07:06,281 --> 02:07:09,970
jealousy. This fucking guy thinks she can
come here. Yeah. Yeah. And they would,

2132
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:13,120
they would set them up, Bang, Bang, Bang.
They would put their biggest hitters,

2133
02:07:13,450 --> 02:07:18,430
Steve Sweeney, Kevin Knox,
Don Gavin, Bang, Bang, Lenny
Clarke, boom, boom, boom.

2134
02:07:18,760 --> 02:07:22,240
And then these poor bastards would come
in from out of town and these guys will

2135
02:07:22,241 --> 02:07:26,650
talking all this Boston talk and then
you've got a bullshit ass act anyway.

2136
02:07:26,651 --> 02:07:30,020
You know you're just kind of drifting
on you just in between movies.

2137
02:07:30,021 --> 02:07:33,730
So you do a little comedy. God,
make yourself feel good. Go Up,

2138
02:07:33,740 --> 02:07:36,160
see your adoring fans.
Hey yeah,

2139
02:07:36,160 --> 02:07:38,140
I'm just going to fuck around in Boston.

2140
02:07:38,380 --> 02:07:41,200
I'll just go down there and I
don't really have an act right now.

2141
02:07:41,980 --> 02:07:46,980
Piecing it together and then he
watch Gavin slash Sweeney smashing.

2142
02:07:47,590 --> 02:07:51,940
The fucking room is falling apart and
you see these poor guys like the look in

2143
02:07:51,941 --> 02:07:53,980
their eye knowing they were
going to certain death.

2144
02:07:56,170 --> 02:08:00,470
Nothing worse than following a crossover
black act crossover like crossover

2145
02:08:00,580 --> 02:08:05,120
black guy criss crossed up played a white
audiences. Oh were you just go up and,

2146
02:08:05,200 --> 02:08:07,590
and you're young and you're
like 32 for the race.

2147
02:08:07,650 --> 02:08:11,200
Taking the marketing fields where it
feels right. I don't know if it is,

2148
02:08:11,201 --> 02:08:12,520
but I'm still listening.

2149
02:08:12,700 --> 02:08:16,600
I'll just say his name
across bt would fucking,

2150
02:08:17,410 --> 02:08:21,130
I can't hold my piss anymore. Sorry.
Can't push a bottle right there.

2151
02:08:22,360 --> 02:08:26,150
Do you think, do you think the hardest
that you like the hardest active fault,

2152
02:08:26,160 --> 02:08:29,090
would it be like bt, bt
guys? Hardest hos. Okay.

2153
02:08:29,170 --> 02:08:32,620
Hardest Act to follow this [inaudible]
always do this but also the place,

2154
02:08:32,650 --> 02:08:35,560
so just to give you an example,
when I'm talking about falling,

2155
02:08:35,561 --> 02:08:40,510
Mike Marino got a fucking
fucking cop convention, you
know what I mean? I got it.

2156
02:08:40,511 --> 02:08:41,080
Okay,
go ahead.

2157
02:08:41,080 --> 02:08:43,690
I'm going to tell you the hardest weekend
I ever had in my entire fucking life.

2158
02:08:43,750 --> 02:08:48,130
Yes. I go to, I go to Miami and
still believe you. Nope. Already.

2159
02:08:48,190 --> 02:08:51,010
No I don't because like I
always saw him fucking like,

2160
02:08:51,011 --> 02:08:51,910
he's one of those guys that could

2161
02:08:51,930 --> 02:08:55,370
just at least kill.
Let's do well afterwards.

2162
02:08:56,070 --> 02:08:57,120
I get booked in Miami,

2163
02:08:57,121 --> 02:09:00,840
it's my first headlining week for the
Improv's and I don't sell any tickets and

2164
02:09:00,841 --> 02:09:03,690
they give me a call and they said we
need to bring in another comic who is

2165
02:09:03,691 --> 02:09:07,620
already in town to help you sell tickets
you doing right now. What are you doing?

2166
02:09:07,750 --> 02:09:10,260
I'm just taking my shoes off. And
your socks off. I don't know dude.

2167
02:09:10,261 --> 02:09:11,094
These fucking mushrooms.

2168
02:09:11,220 --> 02:09:16,090
She started, I thought they were
[inaudible]. Okay. I was like,

2169
02:09:16,940 --> 02:09:21,640
I'm sorry, I forgot that. I was like,
this is insane. And they're like, oh yeah,

2170
02:09:21,680 --> 02:09:26,240
the shoes and socks off
you pissing at the table.

2171
02:09:26,241 --> 02:09:28,700
You're taking the fucking socks
off. Oh, all right. Sorry.

2172
02:09:28,910 --> 02:09:31,460
So you're in Miami please.
I do want to hear this.

2173
02:09:31,461 --> 02:09:35,510
I just was super strapped
again. Keep going. So you're
in Miami. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

2174
02:09:35,520 --> 02:09:36,353
What happened?

2175
02:09:36,650 --> 02:09:38,930
They got another,
here's another comic in town and you got,

2176
02:09:38,931 --> 02:09:40,400
and he's going to co head line with you.

2177
02:09:40,430 --> 02:09:44,010
But the problem is he's already brought
his own feature cause he was, had,

2178
02:09:44,090 --> 02:09:47,490
he thought he was going to headline. So
who was it? I'll tell, I'll just tell.

2179
02:09:47,500 --> 02:09:51,440
I'll give you the line. I, okay,
so they go. So we've cut the host.

2180
02:09:51,740 --> 02:09:52,760
So we got your feature,

2181
02:09:52,761 --> 02:09:57,730
his feature him than you in Miami
in the heyday of Miami. Yeah.

2182
02:09:57,980 --> 02:10:01,870
The first day, I don't know
him, I've never met this.
This is like 85 yep. They go,

2183
02:10:01,890 --> 02:10:02,600
the breakdown,

2184
02:10:02,600 --> 02:10:07,600
the host is going to do a 15 the feature's
going to do 15 he's going to do 40

2185
02:10:08,781 --> 02:10:11,560
you're going to do 40 okay. Right.
That's a long show your life.

2186
02:10:12,020 --> 02:10:13,160
This was the intern announcements.

2187
02:10:13,190 --> 02:10:14,900
And imagine that the
hardest guy was to follow,

2188
02:10:14,901 --> 02:10:18,320
especially in Miami where everyone's
Spanish speaking. Ladies and gentlemen,

2189
02:10:18,321 --> 02:10:22,330
put your hands together for [inaudible].
Steve,

2190
02:10:22,440 --> 02:10:26,930
could I be in y'all,
Bert Kreischer dude,

2191
02:10:26,960 --> 02:10:29,570
I bombed harder than I've
ever bombed in my life.

2192
02:10:29,630 --> 02:10:32,820
I mean Miami sweat dripping
off my chin onto my shirt.

2193
02:10:33,700 --> 02:10:35,620
I don't say that to enable to bring,

2194
02:10:37,620 --> 02:10:42,620
I failed on that whole set and I brought
a black guy on stage and I brought a,

2195
02:10:42,841 --> 02:10:46,970
a Cuban guy on stage and I fuck, I go,
this is where the guy pulled his dick out.

2196
02:10:47,090 --> 02:10:51,540
No, that's the different night. But I
said to him, I go, Ugh, I'm going to just,

2197
02:10:51,850 --> 02:10:52,970
I go,
your people don't understand me.

2198
02:10:52,971 --> 02:10:55,250
So I'll say the joke and you
translate it to your people.

2199
02:10:55,550 --> 02:10:57,770
And so then she was sitting
on stage with me. So I go,

2200
02:10:57,800 --> 02:11:00,560
I was talking to this girl
and the black guy goes, man,

2201
02:11:00,561 --> 02:11:02,000
I'll spin game at this bitch.

2202
02:11:02,001 --> 02:11:04,700
And the place went nuts and
I sent it to the Spanish guy.

2203
02:11:04,701 --> 02:11:07,230
He just said it in Spanish.
I mean I put up, I put blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

2204
02:11:07,240 --> 02:11:10,550
blah, whatever, and it's fucking
destroyed my whole act that way.

2205
02:11:10,551 --> 02:11:13,820
Whenever I had a joke I'd have them
translate it. They said and stay with you.

2206
02:11:13,821 --> 02:11:17,300
The whole sat on my stage for 35 minutes
and drank Tequila with me. That's good.

2207
02:11:17,710 --> 02:11:22,460
[inaudible] you're not
going to figure it out, man.

2208
02:11:22,550 --> 02:11:25,760
I've seen for being you to
straight course. He did.

2209
02:11:26,360 --> 02:11:29,930
Of course Freud number that you have
with your palms and you played it for

2210
02:11:29,940 --> 02:11:33,130
everybody. Tom's kind of have a
half memory of that and you know me,

2211
02:11:33,190 --> 02:11:35,770
I'm selling hot.
Yeah,

2212
02:11:35,780 --> 02:11:40,780
but I mean I played like clips
or like I'm better than anybody.

2213
02:11:41,610 --> 02:11:43,980
I wouldn't think it was good. Tom. Tom,

2214
02:11:44,150 --> 02:11:46,910
you've ever sat in the back of
a room with that was not good.

2215
02:11:47,120 --> 02:11:49,340
How about Sacramento?
That's the fucking worst though,

2216
02:11:49,610 --> 02:11:53,330
was the fun punchline
with it. What does it, no,

2217
02:11:53,331 --> 02:11:58,300
it was called the laugh laugh
unlimited last five minute ones. Yeah,

2218
02:11:58,370 --> 02:12:01,020
I like that place. Good spot.
When I was there I was like,

2219
02:12:01,130 --> 02:12:06,130
like you know what the worst thing about
I got bomb a bomb on a Friday night is

2220
02:12:07,881 --> 02:12:11,420
and that you bomb on the early show
and you can't believe how hard you just

2221
02:12:11,421 --> 02:12:15,390
bought. Like it's life altering. He
bomb hotter on the late show. Oh my.

2222
02:12:15,391 --> 02:12:18,770
They're both sold out.
So it's not like eight people.

2223
02:12:18,800 --> 02:12:22,730
It's like Oh my dad to the gills man.
What was the catalyst? The catalyst.

2224
02:12:22,760 --> 02:12:24,620
I mean he got me out cause
I remember that. I was like,

2225
02:12:24,770 --> 02:12:29,150
I remember everything my
life tonight. Like after you
know Jesus, it was that bad.

2226
02:12:29,151 --> 02:12:32,150
But then what was, what started
it? What started the bus started?

2227
02:12:32,151 --> 02:12:36,650
The bomb was the opening joke cause I
was just like, by the way, by the way,

2228
02:12:36,651 --> 02:12:37,910
before you tell your opening joke,

2229
02:12:38,210 --> 02:12:42,620
Tom is great with feeling uncomfortable
in the moment and taking it to the next

2230
02:12:42,621 --> 02:12:45,320
level. We're in Hawaii with Russell
Peters. The one thing they say is,

2231
02:12:45,321 --> 02:12:49,100
do not mention negative shit about
the Hawaiians. Tom's opening joke.

2232
02:12:49,101 --> 02:12:52,940
Do you remember it? And
they said, island life slow.

2233
02:12:52,941 --> 02:12:56,150
I didn't know they were talking
about your metabolism's. Holy Shit.

2234
02:12:56,151 --> 02:13:00,420
You guys are fat. You do the
same shit in Australia. Richard.

2235
02:13:00,430 --> 02:13:03,830
He's like that first word. Don't
mention Japanese people, man.

2236
02:13:03,831 --> 02:13:07,340
I got lost on base today. Luckily I ran
into a Japanese guy. He pointed me out.

2237
02:13:07,430 --> 02:13:10,460
They know everything about this base
is over there drinking his own pissed.

2238
02:13:10,730 --> 02:13:15,170
Oh my God, you got me for fucking fraction
of a second. I was like, no, he didn't

2239
02:13:16,840 --> 02:13:21,070
at it. I was like, he's
really locked, is fine.

2240
02:13:21,540 --> 02:13:24,010
He's drink his own piss.
So wait,

2241
02:13:24,020 --> 02:13:27,820
how did your mom go in Sacramento
to the Sacramento bomb was dirt.

2242
02:13:27,821 --> 02:13:30,890
It was the month after
the month after hurricane.

2243
02:13:31,980 --> 02:13:35,640
So I opened with a joke.
I don't remember the wording of it,

2244
02:13:35,820 --> 02:13:37,440
but it was like how there were,
um,

2245
02:13:37,740 --> 02:13:42,740
there's reports of people
raping people in the aftermath.

2246
02:13:43,290 --> 02:13:47,610
And I was like, yeah. I was
like, I opened, I was just
like, you know, nothing like,

2247
02:13:47,611 --> 02:13:50,940
uh, seen dead bodies float by that makes
me want to fuck somebody, you know.

2248
02:13:51,060 --> 02:13:54,840
And then I just kind of like
riff about like, you know,

2249
02:13:54,841 --> 02:13:56,960
dead people and then being like fuck.

2250
02:13:57,300 --> 02:14:00,960
And it would eat so much shit and then I
would go, you know, you have the thing,

2251
02:14:00,961 --> 02:14:03,080
you're like, well I just go to my
act now. Like I'll just go to like,

2252
02:14:03,320 --> 02:14:07,350
cause it was like, it was already too
late and I would bomb for the full,

2253
02:14:07,650 --> 02:14:10,620
the patching. And the funny thing
is they made the bowl shows. Yes.

2254
02:14:11,310 --> 02:14:13,710
Tell you what are you going to go?
There's something to this. This is funny.

2255
02:14:14,400 --> 02:14:15,031
I was like,
turn,

2256
02:14:15,031 --> 02:14:20,031
this is the why and nothing like seeing
a dead person on a TV floating by them.

2257
02:14:21,110 --> 02:14:25,200
It's just the timing,
the timing is off that fucking,

2258
02:14:25,290 --> 02:14:29,610
the club lady came, Leslie, you don't
like your new feature at a Clem.

2259
02:14:29,710 --> 02:14:33,750
I remember she came up, she goes,
they man, the bomb feels so bad.

2260
02:14:33,900 --> 02:14:37,920
Then you're sweating so hard and you're
like, man, this emotionally just taxing.

2261
02:14:37,921 --> 02:14:39,640
Right. You're just like, God damn right.

2262
02:14:39,730 --> 02:14:42,180
And I walk off stage and I
run like indoor. She goes,

2263
02:14:42,181 --> 02:14:45,630
I thought you were supposed to be funny.
Oh fuck she,

2264
02:14:45,640 --> 02:14:49,440
she goes to music read and I
go, what? And she was like,

2265
02:14:49,441 --> 02:14:53,940
you're supposed to do 25 you did 23
and I was like, I fucking all right.

2266
02:14:54,330 --> 02:14:55,950
And then like that's the first show.

2267
02:14:56,340 --> 02:15:01,340
Then the second show literally is worse
and an inconceivable way is worse.

2268
02:15:01,440 --> 02:15:04,170
Did you try to save that joke
again or try to open with it again?

2269
02:15:05,950 --> 02:15:10,680
This work and then I ate so hard.

2270
02:15:10,770 --> 02:15:12,630
Then I, here's Iheart, I eat it.

2271
02:15:12,880 --> 02:15:17,880
I eat it so hard that I'm middling and
the MCS like, damn dude, you fucking suck.

2272
02:15:18,010 --> 02:15:22,290
Like he's like, he's like, he's
like, you're like, he was just like,

2273
02:15:22,350 --> 02:15:25,590
it was that big dude. Yeah. He was
like, he was just like, God damn,

2274
02:15:25,591 --> 02:15:29,710
I've never seen anything like this. Fuck.
I was like, yeah, he was jovial. You're,

2275
02:15:30,330 --> 02:15:34,350
you feel like big lots. Yeah. It wasn't
my God. And then the next day I was like,

2276
02:15:34,351 --> 02:15:35,670
I don't know how I'm going to do this,
man.

2277
02:15:35,790 --> 02:15:39,610
And Burt coast couldn't give you one
piece of advice and I go, yeah, he goes,

2278
02:15:40,470 --> 02:15:43,770
open different, just do whatever you
want, but just opened on a different joke.

2279
02:15:44,290 --> 02:15:47,070
I was like, all right man. And
at the time I swear to you,

2280
02:15:47,071 --> 02:15:52,071
that fucking first show Saturday
by the best set that I've ever had,

2281
02:15:52,710 --> 02:15:57,330
like unbelievable set did. The lady
goes, oh, okay, no, no, no. She goes, uh,

2282
02:15:57,420 --> 02:16:00,050
I, I was, I felt redeemed, right?

2283
02:16:00,110 --> 02:16:04,630
Like I fucking destroyed and I will,
I mean like the MCS,

2284
02:16:04,650 --> 02:16:06,990
like Jesus. He said, I've never seen
a turnaround like that. You know?

2285
02:16:06,991 --> 02:16:07,630
It's like when I'm like,

2286
02:16:07,630 --> 02:16:12,600
this feels like I walk around and I see
her and I go like, then she goes, what?

2287
02:16:12,630 --> 02:16:13,650
I didn't hear anything.
I go,

2288
02:16:15,260 --> 02:16:19,500
she pretended like she didn't know shit
if she watched, I remember I grabbed her.

2289
02:16:19,980 --> 02:16:22,560
She kept coming up to me going, you said
he was funny. You brought them with you.

2290
02:16:22,561 --> 02:16:26,580
And I was like, trust me. The best part
about his bomb was Tom used to have about,

2291
02:16:26,581 --> 02:16:30,190
I lost amount of weight. I lost during
the sweating, all show you some longer

2292
02:16:30,190 --> 02:16:34,150
hair. And comb it back so it would
be up right. And as he bombed,

2293
02:16:34,151 --> 02:16:38,690
it starts to fall and then it starts
to get wet and then to run down,

2294
02:16:39,640 --> 02:16:43,090
I'm soaking wet. He's great. He
was like, I jumped in a pool,

2295
02:16:43,240 --> 02:16:47,020
like I was fucking soaking wet
that feel when you're eating shit,

2296
02:16:47,021 --> 02:16:49,920
it's not like anything else on earth.
I remember that. I remember that.

2297
02:16:49,921 --> 02:16:54,160
Like he was up on stage and
somebody yelled at him like
some late and he's like,

2298
02:16:54,161 --> 02:16:57,130
well you're a fucking dumb cut.
You said that. Yeah. And the,

2299
02:16:57,190 --> 02:17:01,030
and the room was like cut room turned out.
Yeah,

2300
02:17:01,031 --> 02:17:02,860
they'll turn on your car
then you want come back.

2301
02:17:02,861 --> 02:17:05,820
I remember him winning the back. I was
like, God damn. I used to have some uh,

2302
02:17:05,821 --> 02:17:10,360
some uh, quick go tos on
that. Yeah. Favors. Hey honey,

2303
02:17:10,361 --> 02:17:13,300
your mouth, uh, God made your mouth
for one thing and it's not talking.

2304
02:17:13,750 --> 02:17:17,230
That's good. God. What does that
mean? Math, I suck. So we say

2305
02:17:19,120 --> 02:17:22,450
that's a joke.
It's a irreproachable.

2306
02:17:23,140 --> 02:17:25,310
I would love to hear like a feminine.
This you say,

2307
02:17:25,370 --> 02:17:29,970
I should know this thing's flashing.
Flashing red. This one is too. Oh,

2308
02:17:30,090 --> 02:17:34,210
the recording is on.
You guys both had mushrooms said no,

2309
02:17:34,211 --> 02:17:38,680
they don't usually flash. Yeah,
I'm really do much. Oh Ass.

2310
02:17:38,720 --> 02:17:40,930
Are you the shoes off his shoes off?

2311
02:17:40,960 --> 02:17:43,310
I said the mushrooms are
to be shoes or something.

2312
02:17:43,440 --> 02:17:46,660
Then they got me a little bit for eat
them during the show ended right before

2313
02:17:46,661 --> 02:17:49,120
the show. Right before you start.
Right. I wasn't enough though.

2314
02:17:49,130 --> 02:17:51,190
What it likes essentially the Mo.
It's nice.

2315
02:17:51,220 --> 02:17:54,460
It gives you like a little nice thing
but like my palms are sweaty and I'm

2316
02:17:54,461 --> 02:17:57,520
fucking out of it. Yeah, definitely
sweating. Huh? Is that what it is?

2317
02:17:57,521 --> 02:18:00,280
You get your palms get sweaty guys.
Arm Spaghetti,

2318
02:18:01,820 --> 02:18:06,820
Spaghetti rap battle rap battle
rap battle rap daddy for help.

2319
02:18:06,830 --> 02:18:11,460
No, listen guys, I'm serious. It's either,
it's either type, no hip hop challenge.

2320
02:18:14,700 --> 02:18:19,360
Physically difficult though. It's not
totally different, but nobody do nothing.

2321
02:18:19,780 --> 02:18:22,540
That's the point already.
You want to watch people do stuff.

2322
02:18:22,580 --> 02:18:27,070
Have your play the hurt since when is
it about anybody else other than us? No,

2323
02:18:27,071 --> 02:18:30,970
but people did tune in. If
they like it, they like it,

2324
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:35,630
but you don't do it for other
people like, yeah, hold on, joke.

2325
02:18:35,660 --> 02:18:38,300
Don't send to an artist
talk and shot at first

2326
02:18:40,490 --> 02:18:42,600
watching, watching, doing yoga.

2327
02:18:42,601 --> 02:18:46,730
I use Instagram challenges is you're
holding your breath challenge like goes,

2328
02:18:46,750 --> 02:18:49,910
he really holding his breath. I
don't fucking know. Well Burt,

2329
02:18:50,110 --> 02:18:53,030
everyone doesn't have to be in on every
goddamn thing you do everyday until you

2330
02:18:53,040 --> 02:18:56,350
get a shirt. Hey guys, going to bring
you in here. Ooh, Shit. Champion. This

2331
02:18:57,270 --> 02:18:58,980
the,
she

2332
02:19:00,740 --> 02:19:02,940
used be shit on Instagram first ever.
Probably.

2333
02:19:05,830 --> 02:19:07,010
What did the girl say when you're,

2334
02:19:07,260 --> 02:19:12,260
you're boasting when I pose it like dad's
mom [inaudible] funny that you don't

2335
02:19:16,600 --> 02:19:20,670
use the n word.
Oh my God.

2336
02:19:20,690 --> 02:19:25,150
He's got a girlfriend and just trying to
stream and provide for the family. Yeah.

2337
02:19:25,180 --> 02:19:25,810
Fuck them.

2338
02:19:25,810 --> 02:19:29,360
They don't realize I've leveraged their
futures for our income right now. Yes,

2339
02:19:29,420 --> 02:19:34,070
that's what it is. Yeah. You
paid a hefty price. Oh Dude.

2340
02:19:34,730 --> 02:19:37,850
Yeah. My kids do not like that. I've
talked that much about them. Well,

2341
02:19:37,851 --> 02:19:40,110
you should probably not have done that.
I'm trying to,

2342
02:19:40,190 --> 02:19:44,690
he's like 20 fucking 20 Joe early on. He
was like, really? You mentioned your kids.

2343
02:19:44,691 --> 02:19:49,430
You're like, yeah, what's
the, what's whatnot? I was
told to wait a long time ago.

2344
02:19:49,630 --> 02:19:53,600
My kids are fucking stupid.
He said, that's what he said.

2345
02:19:55,220 --> 02:19:57,110
He said, they're not
even gonna know. I go,

2346
02:19:57,111 --> 02:19:58,940
what if people come out to in
the mall and they said, Hey,

2347
02:19:58,941 --> 02:20:03,130
your dad was talking
about them like idiots.

2348
02:20:03,440 --> 02:20:07,430
Oh my God. I called George on
the phone on stage the other day.

2349
02:20:08,040 --> 02:20:12,970
Everyone was yelling island.
They're like, no, I'm Georgia.
The smart ones. Oh, don't,

2350
02:20:12,980 --> 02:20:16,220
don't look.
Hey [inaudible] 20 I was being honest.

2351
02:20:16,221 --> 02:20:20,150
I didn't know another way to do
stand up. I get it. I get it. Yeah,

2352
02:20:20,151 --> 02:20:24,050
you do it one way is just fine for
most of the world. That's the thing.

2353
02:20:24,110 --> 02:20:26,300
Like most things are fine
for most of the world.

2354
02:20:26,500 --> 02:20:29,690
It's just a small percentage of people
that are just wired all fucked up.

2355
02:20:30,230 --> 02:20:34,910
I guess we gotta. We gotta go. I gotta
go soon. It's up to 10 to six. Yeah.

2356
02:20:34,911 --> 02:20:38,480
We gotta go. No, I think you're going to
see the law online. Can we see anything?

2357
02:20:39,060 --> 02:20:42,860
Well, I'll stand to you and I'm not
going to look. They walk your number.

2358
02:20:42,900 --> 02:20:47,870
I'm telling you. [inaudible] look at it.

2359
02:20:47,871 --> 02:20:52,130
No music. Just show her videos. If we're
going to do it, we should break dance.

2360
02:20:52,320 --> 02:20:54,730
Go to stance elements. Stan.
Tell events and what's,

2361
02:20:54,790 --> 02:20:59,450
watch some of these guys do it. Here's
a video shot. Faker. Chet faker.

2362
02:20:59,570 --> 02:21:03,880
Oh fuck. This is great. Yeah. Some dance.
Look, I'm a real dance glazer. It's,

2363
02:21:03,980 --> 02:21:06,590
I'm telling you this. How will
shoot it. I'm a fan of this girl.

2364
02:21:06,591 --> 02:21:10,420
Dee Glazer's her name. She's
a choreographer. She got
blonde hair. Give her Nelly,

2365
02:21:10,450 --> 02:21:13,670
Nelly, uh, uh, from the loop and I'm
proud of you can't, we can't play it.

2366
02:21:13,930 --> 02:21:16,910
Play the music. Just watch her
dance. Okay, let's watch it.

2367
02:21:17,110 --> 02:21:20,510
[inaudible] we'll be doing Joe.
And I really think you're gonna like,

2368
02:21:21,020 --> 02:21:24,240
what are you selling this? I'll get this.
I'll get this job. I'm already out. No,

2369
02:21:24,241 --> 02:21:28,750
Joe. Yeah, right here. Fuck the
glazer. She's like cardinals fan.

2370
02:21:29,330 --> 02:21:31,400
Yeah. Country Grammar
first. This is us. Joe,

2371
02:21:31,430 --> 02:21:33,470
anything that doesn't
require you to lose weight.

2372
02:21:33,910 --> 02:21:37,550
I'm not looking for bodies in fucking
great show. This is us doing these.

2373
02:21:37,551 --> 02:21:42,080
Her name? Her name's Dee Glaser. Okay.
She's great. She's great. She's great.

2374
02:21:42,110 --> 02:21:44,900
And this will be us. Imagine how much
fun it would be when you do it though.

2375
02:21:44,901 --> 02:21:46,580
Cause you're fat. Yeah, I'll be,

2376
02:21:49,700 --> 02:21:53,090
do you think you could learn to do this?
100% you do things.

2377
02:21:53,160 --> 02:21:55,610
You can do a fucking split.
You remember that thing?

2378
02:21:57,940 --> 02:22:00,290
You could try it. You get a hold
on. You think you could do this.

2379
02:22:00,320 --> 02:22:01,730
I could get my body to move that way.

2380
02:22:01,731 --> 02:22:06,731
If someone taught me and I spent the
amount of time on a month to month one

2381
02:22:06,861 --> 02:22:08,330
month, no, not as good as her.

2382
02:22:08,360 --> 02:22:10,940
I think in one month you could
be better than all of us. Oh,

2383
02:22:10,941 --> 02:22:13,400
I would definitely be better than you.
And that's all that counts, right?

2384
02:22:13,920 --> 02:22:18,170
Oh Jo Jo Jo. Come on. This is
me and Tom and you and Ari.

2385
02:22:18,230 --> 02:22:20,610
We do a s one altogether.
I'm like,

2386
02:22:20,930 --> 02:22:24,670
he likes the belt brow exit from a,
what's it called? In the back. All right.

2387
02:22:24,740 --> 02:22:29,490
Do you think you could learn to do
lists? Look over here, Bert. No. Huh?

2388
02:22:29,610 --> 02:22:30,930
No,
not getting rid of this.

2389
02:22:31,470 --> 02:22:35,120
So tell me a challenge that you think
is fair for that fits everybody.

2390
02:22:35,200 --> 02:22:37,750
Everybody should weigh in right now.
What do you think it should?

2391
02:22:37,790 --> 02:22:40,470
You don't have the parents in this
cause that place, that place like that.

2392
02:22:40,471 --> 02:22:41,670
It's right near my apartment.

2393
02:22:41,671 --> 02:22:44,910
I walk by on the way home from not working
out and I looked through the window

2394
02:22:44,911 --> 02:22:48,320
at them doing crazy dances like that.
I understand the

2395
02:22:50,580 --> 02:22:55,200
challenge would be I'm crazy and I'm
going to keep the grandma mobile moment.

2396
02:22:55,201 --> 02:22:59,280
I'm going to keep this. This is mine.
I liked this. I liked having it.

2397
02:23:00,230 --> 02:23:04,140
Look at that. Let's go for it at that. You
never can get this bird. I'm getting it.

2398
02:23:04,141 --> 02:23:06,910
If we do hip hop, you think so? You're not

2399
02:23:08,500 --> 02:23:11,200
with the weight loss challenge
you by man. By the way, if I may,

2400
02:23:11,210 --> 02:23:13,830
you should get a weight loss challenge
belt and I think we should probably make

2401
02:23:13,831 --> 02:23:18,780
one. That'd be a great idea.
Horrible fucking idea. It's
a great idea. Um, get on it,

2402
02:23:18,960 --> 02:23:21,420
Jamie. Order it up. We need
a weight loss challenge

2403
02:23:24,110 --> 02:23:28,320
with branded tour bus champ too.
I want a marathon bell. Okay.

2404
02:23:28,640 --> 02:23:30,040
He's the only one I've tried that

2405
02:23:32,490 --> 02:23:35,540
they give you like a button or something
when you, when a man or you run it.

2406
02:23:36,470 --> 02:23:40,220
They do you know why? Cause your
promoter had one. I saw him when I was

2407
02:23:42,500 --> 02:23:46,650
one of them erasers that go on top
of a pencil that nobody ever uses.

2408
02:23:46,651 --> 02:23:48,850
Triangles through writing.

2409
02:23:50,790 --> 02:23:55,790
Pens are so crazy and you use up that
erase or boy you need an external check

2410
02:23:56,140 --> 02:23:58,530
cam hands on the phone call
campaigns right now. He'll be,

2411
02:23:58,531 --> 02:24:01,490
he'll tell you how it's spirit now
listen, what about, what about, uh,

2412
02:24:01,630 --> 02:24:05,370
if we let this hold on and I had the
fucking greatest idea, the greatest idea,

2413
02:24:05,371 --> 02:24:09,240
whole bracket. When you remember if, if
we do with the hip hop challenge we need,

2414
02:24:09,450 --> 02:24:13,350
no one's going to be there to cheer
anybody in Queer that the judges,

2415
02:24:13,500 --> 02:24:17,110
it has to be just us if
you want. Yeah, you care.

2416
02:24:18,030 --> 02:24:20,150
Can't quit the judges. Are you
allowed to say that anymore? Yeah,

2417
02:24:20,190 --> 02:24:23,000
I think that's probably language.
I don't know. It's in the,

2418
02:24:24,060 --> 02:24:28,050
my friend Miriam Nakamoto snacks snack,
a Modo snacks.

2419
02:24:28,590 --> 02:24:32,610
So just us and then you get actual
judges don't know us to decide. Yeah,

2420
02:24:33,300 --> 02:24:36,720
you have to really make a place.
Three people learned it with Joe.

2421
02:24:36,721 --> 02:24:40,110
I think you just gotta say
alternative alternative.

2422
02:24:40,111 --> 02:24:42,480
Let's come up with something
where we don't need judges.

2423
02:24:42,810 --> 02:24:46,830
I don't want to bring judges in cause
then we have other people like then it's

2424
02:24:46,831 --> 02:24:51,470
going to get gross weight. Maybe it's a
bad idea to bring in judges one judge,

2425
02:24:51,530 --> 02:24:55,980
because it just happens the power over
to other people in our organization too.

2426
02:24:55,981 --> 02:24:58,720
I don't want to even talk to other people.
That makes sense.

2427
02:24:59,180 --> 02:25:00,870
I'm trying to cut people out of my life.

2428
02:25:00,871 --> 02:25:03,270
I'm not trying to add
to hip hop dance judges.

2429
02:25:04,410 --> 02:25:09,210
I don't have the time. The only
debt, the idea. I like Ari's idea.

2430
02:25:09,211 --> 02:25:13,830
No social media for a year. Except I
have an ambulator run. You could run it.

2431
02:25:13,831 --> 02:25:17,520
Just go Jamie, post it. We have no
video post it. I don't trust him. No,

2432
02:25:17,521 --> 02:25:19,210
you'd have to. You'd have to give
it up. I'm going to be in charge.

2433
02:25:19,900 --> 02:25:24,370
I got him over there. He's sneaky.
He's sneaky. He checked my dms.

2434
02:25:24,520 --> 02:25:28,520
Why don't we eat it for Tony [inaudible].
Who's the best? I'll see you at the STL.

2435
02:25:28,530 --> 02:25:32,710
Them Dick Pics. Common my way. Yeah, the
judges is a real thing. You're right.

2436
02:25:32,740 --> 02:25:33,700
Judges is a real thing,

2437
02:25:33,701 --> 02:25:37,300
but I think we're in the right
direction with hip hop dance. Why?

2438
02:25:37,301 --> 02:25:40,680
Cause it's your invention. No, no,
no. I just think it's something silly.

2439
02:25:40,950 --> 02:25:45,060
[inaudible] you lose again.
There should be a real penalty for how

2440
02:25:46,600 --> 02:25:50,650
it be a real repercussion
for you in the first place.

2441
02:25:50,651 --> 02:25:54,310
I don't like Jolan top dance and we'll
put in the word. This is a good one.

2442
02:25:54,550 --> 02:25:58,900
If you come in last, you give
us, spread it out collectively.

2443
02:25:59,020 --> 02:25:59,890
$1 million.

2444
02:26:03,500 --> 02:26:08,110
Well,
you're doing better now.

2445
02:26:08,170 --> 02:26:10,990
It's 12 bucks, champ. You've
got that blog tour, bus champ.

2446
02:26:11,020 --> 02:26:12,750
You have to think about that.
Just sign up for,

2447
02:26:12,770 --> 02:26:16,110
you're not going to lose if those are
the stakes. What is the common division?

2448
02:26:16,150 --> 02:26:20,050
Wait, hold on. Hold on one second.
Let's let aside, let's talk tour.

2449
02:26:20,080 --> 02:26:24,520
Bus Champ comes at a price.
Dude, my bus was so fucking sick.

2450
02:26:24,550 --> 02:26:29,050
You can't just be tour bus champ. His
or his fight. I was taught about chip.

2451
02:26:29,170 --> 02:26:32,800
Listen, listen, but Bert, do you
understand that this is strange,

2452
02:26:33,100 --> 02:26:37,180
that you keep failing at these things
and yet you keep bragging every time we

2453
02:26:37,181 --> 02:26:38,470
get together,
contemplate,

2454
02:26:38,480 --> 02:26:41,560
have so much success when it comes to
you guys that I think sometimes you guys

2455
02:26:41,561 --> 02:26:45,620
forget about it. I was trying
to share, hold on a minute.

2456
02:26:45,720 --> 02:26:48,730
I was talking about sham admitted.
Admitted me.

2457
02:26:48,860 --> 02:26:52,300
[inaudible] Nelson Alive, don't
you? What do you don't talk to?

2458
02:26:52,300 --> 02:26:53,650
You're not the tour bus champ.

2459
02:26:53,740 --> 02:26:56,700
The bus that I was on this week is
better than anybody else on the tour bus

2460
02:26:56,710 --> 02:27:01,300
championship was going on already
asking me who's tour bus trip.

2461
02:27:01,920 --> 02:27:05,110
Let's say why it's me. Of course I'll
come cause I have the better bus.

2462
02:27:05,140 --> 02:27:08,860
Did you ever take a picture of your bus
and put it online? Yeah. Oh really? Yeah.

2463
02:27:08,870 --> 02:27:11,950
You and you had fucking
Photoshop to a hundred times. No.

2464
02:27:13,060 --> 02:27:15,250
The outside of your bus doesn't count.
Tom,

2465
02:27:15,280 --> 02:27:17,620
the inside of your bus that
looked like a prison yard.

2466
02:27:17,690 --> 02:27:19,810
It just looked like a prison yard too.
Did Not,

2467
02:27:19,811 --> 02:27:23,230
did it not have a broken transmission?
No Internet TV's that didn't work.

2468
02:27:23,440 --> 02:27:25,010
You had no internet on your toy box,

2469
02:27:26,740 --> 02:27:31,260
and I want you to pause for a second
and imagine a world where the thing that

2470
02:27:31,261 --> 02:27:35,950
you're bragging about when you have been
called out for failing to challenges in

2471
02:27:35,951 --> 02:27:40,860
a row heart,
first thing you talking about is this.

2472
02:27:40,860 --> 02:27:44,140
We're not even in the shape of the
bus that you drive around debt.

2473
02:27:44,170 --> 02:27:47,950
I didn't start talking about champ.
He started tour bus. Much is prepared.

2474
02:27:47,951 --> 02:27:51,050
What's was the transmission bad?
We'll then I win

2475
02:27:53,950 --> 02:27:58,540
a flat tire.
Well then I had a jazz show.

2476
02:27:58,660 --> 02:28:01,980
I'm Leonardo Dicaprio at the
front of and titanic. We,

2477
02:28:03,850 --> 02:28:07,900
we had a challenge who came at
last told me somebody who was like,

2478
02:28:08,020 --> 02:28:10,270
what are the repercussions for
you fucking pussing out. Well,

2479
02:28:10,271 --> 02:28:12,800
I'm not putting out fucking founded.

2480
02:28:13,010 --> 02:28:17,680
The reasons why I have this right here
is because I read about you saying that

2481
02:28:17,681 --> 02:28:20,680
you're going to put it on your mantle
piece and I'm like, that's never done.

2482
02:28:20,990 --> 02:28:25,280
You're Mickey mantle piece. That's
[inaudible]. Joe, can you entertain?

2483
02:28:25,920 --> 02:28:29,220
Can you entertain a circumstance in
which you think Burt could beat you?

2484
02:28:29,970 --> 02:28:33,540
Hip Hop may make again like the
old hustler make an even game.

2485
02:28:33,740 --> 02:28:35,190
It could be anybody's at this point

2486
02:28:35,250 --> 02:28:38,190
look a pool games or no,
no, no. When I play pool,

2487
02:28:38,250 --> 02:28:40,590
but like I'm not going to finish up on
the challenge that where it's like you've

2488
02:28:40,591 --> 02:28:44,190
got to make it the way back to be.
I'd have to have some form of lymphoma

2489
02:28:46,230 --> 02:28:50,580
really wrong with me, a physical
thing, but he'd moved so well.

2490
02:28:50,700 --> 02:28:54,990
Maybe you move like the
wind is something I've seen.

2491
02:28:54,991 --> 02:28:58,560
You move that Christopher Cross on Terry.

2492
02:28:58,561 --> 02:29:03,561
Shiloh couldn't move better than you and
you really can meet with Matt de Berg.

2493
02:29:04,140 --> 02:29:07,950
There was days where I was,
I was like, man, I'm tired.
And then I thought about you

2494
02:29:10,130 --> 02:29:14,340
already standing there. You took your
socks off, you fucking mushrooms.

2495
02:29:14,370 --> 02:29:16,380
We took some mushrooms and you forget.

2496
02:29:18,050 --> 02:29:21,620
Or both. I gotta go, man, it feels
good. That's what are we doing?

2497
02:29:21,850 --> 02:29:23,940
What are we going to have? We don't
have a agreement. Yeah we should.

2498
02:29:23,940 --> 02:29:26,840
And also you do need some repercussions
for fucking blowing it back.

2499
02:29:27,380 --> 02:29:32,330
[inaudible] I forget. I'm the
only one that ran a marathon too,

2500
02:29:33,090 --> 02:29:36,510
but it doesn't seem like you
are willing to face reality.

2501
02:29:36,780 --> 02:29:38,250
Tell me what reality
is. I'll fix it. Well,

2502
02:29:38,251 --> 02:29:41,490
of reality is Ari Shaffir didn't
work out at all the other ways.

2503
02:29:42,550 --> 02:29:47,550
Did Marathon Ari Shaffir I
didn't work out at decade.

2504
02:29:49,560 --> 02:29:53,490
I agree with you.
He's smoked you like,

2505
02:29:55,560 --> 02:29:58,260
why are you stressing anything
in life? And not just like, okay,

2506
02:29:58,261 --> 02:30:03,000
I'm probably you talking shit to
Ari didn't work out for 10 years.

2507
02:30:03,001 --> 02:30:06,540
I'm the only one that came in
with this checkpoint point.

2508
02:30:08,500 --> 02:30:13,490
What did you sit down? Do you ever see
the video of him on my fucking Rowan,

2509
02:30:13,491 --> 02:30:17,460
Michelle, I saw, here's the
deal. We teamed up against you.

2510
02:30:17,461 --> 02:30:21,980
Listen to my second place guy.
Let him use my teamed to go.

2511
02:30:22,940 --> 02:30:25,560
Can we team up?
I literally,

2512
02:30:25,830 --> 02:30:28,480
he's convinced that he was gone.
Give me this.

2513
02:30:28,490 --> 02:30:33,310
My closest competitor I told you day
off. That's true. I did. I just don't,

2514
02:30:34,570 --> 02:30:34,840
I've

2515
02:30:34,840 --> 02:30:37,870
said, I've said Ad Nauseum. We're not,
I can't believe we're covering this.

2516
02:30:37,900 --> 02:30:42,190
I've just had it at nauseum. Uh, Culligan
on Joe's Tiger's tail is a big mistake.

2517
02:30:42,400 --> 02:30:45,460
Ari was a massively surprising and
Tom was a fair, fair competitor.

2518
02:30:45,550 --> 02:30:50,530
Now I will say I am just giving up ideas
of what to do next October and I need

2519
02:30:50,560 --> 02:30:53,740
ideas and I believe that Ariz idea was,

2520
02:30:53,980 --> 02:30:58,900
I think us not doing something
is not fun to follow.

2521
02:30:58,901 --> 02:31:03,040
If you are a fan of the podcast, us not
doing it like, hey guys, let's sleep.

2522
02:31:03,220 --> 02:31:05,200
Wouldn't be really fun.
It would be,

2523
02:31:05,201 --> 02:31:08,320
it would be how many hours of hip hop
dancing and we put in, there we go.

2524
02:31:08,321 --> 02:31:12,190
Now we're talking about something.
Why hip hop dancing? Not Klezmer.

2525
02:31:12,840 --> 02:31:16,780
Let name it.
You guys want to do river dance river dam.

2526
02:31:16,840 --> 02:31:20,000
Fuck no dance.
It sucked when it was invented

2527
02:31:20,240 --> 02:31:21,540
dancing.
It's just hitting me right now.

2528
02:31:22,290 --> 02:31:27,290
Fast forwarding to [inaudible]
say another idea I'm in.

2529
02:31:29,821 --> 02:31:33,200
I'm in, but like I liked what
we did was with the hot yoga,

2530
02:31:33,260 --> 02:31:38,250
the easiest thing to do is something that
you don't need a lot to like take with

2531
02:31:38,251 --> 02:31:42,420
you or do you know what I mean? Like
it's not bad. I like running a lot.

2532
02:31:42,450 --> 02:31:43,410
I do raclette I'm running,

2533
02:31:43,411 --> 02:31:45,210
but I don't want to be the one
sitting here promoting running.

2534
02:31:45,330 --> 02:31:47,290
I'm trying to think out of the box.
Running is a great idea.

2535
02:31:48,230 --> 02:31:53,230
Great about running is that if we did
do it for the whole total miles of the

2536
02:31:54,300 --> 02:31:58,170
month, it would get savage
problematic. Would you?

2537
02:31:58,171 --> 02:32:01,530
Do you work? Uh, what burden?

2538
02:32:01,531 --> 02:32:03,210
I will seriously lose like 40 pounds.

2539
02:32:03,320 --> 02:32:07,920
[inaudible] name. What's the guys?

2540
02:32:07,980 --> 02:32:11,940
You just had an insert and he has
you do a marathon a day, Joe. Well,

2541
02:32:11,970 --> 02:32:14,490
I think it's physically
possible to do a marathon a day.

2542
02:32:14,700 --> 02:32:18,510
I know you could well be way
easier for me than for you.

2543
02:32:18,850 --> 02:32:23,460
They're much easier. Once again, I'm too
drunk to even talk to them. By the way.

2544
02:32:23,850 --> 02:32:27,740
I bet you looked at me like you're
like, I'm going to do that. Listen,

2545
02:32:28,260 --> 02:32:30,240
are you going to do a marathon a day?
It's not.

2546
02:32:33,530 --> 02:32:36,930
It's not healthy for you to keep living
in this world that you've created,

2547
02:32:36,960 --> 02:32:39,840
which doesn't even make sense, but are you
talking about my drinking or my no, no,

2548
02:32:39,841 --> 02:32:40,674
no.
That's normal.

2549
02:32:42,210 --> 02:32:45,750
The drinking along with this
proclamation of awesomeness.

2550
02:32:48,540 --> 02:32:52,410
You know what? I'm saying it's like just,
it's not the drink. The drinking is fun.

2551
02:32:52,950 --> 02:32:57,330
It's fun. You're fun running.
[inaudible] on rolling. Michelle,

2552
02:32:57,870 --> 02:33:02,870
you need to be punished if you lose
[inaudible] you want some make sense?

2553
02:33:04,440 --> 02:33:05,251
We got way more.

2554
02:33:05,251 --> 02:33:09,600
There's a whole table full of whiskey
over there and then we got cast monkeys.

2555
02:33:09,601 --> 02:33:12,510
Tequila here too. Let's do
running then. If everyone,

2556
02:33:12,511 --> 02:33:14,640
if everyone agrees on Monday I'm
in, I'm running. Can I ask you that?

2557
02:33:14,650 --> 02:33:17,010
Someone's going to get ugly guys.
I'm just going to get ugly.

2558
02:33:17,100 --> 02:33:20,070
I'm going to do a marathon and where are
we going to wear to track are so that

2559
02:33:20,071 --> 02:33:22,620
everybody has the same
thing to track the shoe.

2560
02:33:22,830 --> 02:33:26,040
Well you could wear the rock shoe or you
can just get an apple watch. No, no, no.

2561
02:33:26,041 --> 02:33:31,041
But that way we could do or watch only
for phone calls and then talking to it if

2562
02:33:31,981 --> 02:33:35,160
you have a of text messages and then
I'll do Ari's challenge at the same time.

2563
02:33:35,490 --> 02:33:40,440
So it will be doing our need for
social media for the month. So wait,

2564
02:33:40,441 --> 02:33:45,240
hold on. Running on an iPhone. We'll do
as many miles as we can for the month.

2565
02:33:45,420 --> 02:33:48,960
And the whole thing would be how
many miles can you run in a month?

2566
02:33:49,320 --> 02:33:53,380
Am I tell you I'm going to open up
the first day with 30 30 30 miles.

2567
02:33:53,990 --> 02:33:58,590
I'm going to open that up. Yeah, hold
on. No. Are we talking 30 miles in a day?

2568
02:33:59,120 --> 02:34:01,950
That day I need to do 30 miles.
Can you, here's the thing,

2569
02:34:01,990 --> 02:34:06,330
cause it earlier today that that
part I believe, I do believe that.

2570
02:34:06,331 --> 02:34:10,740
I believe that. Here's what
I want to know. This makes
a huge difference. Can you,

2571
02:34:10,950 --> 02:34:14,070
cause if we're tracking those miles,
we all have to track the miles.

2572
02:34:14,100 --> 02:34:17,800
We have to track them out
with the same APP, 30 miles,

2573
02:34:18,310 --> 02:34:21,350
which we're off to track the mileage.
The with the same APP. No, again, don't,

2574
02:34:21,351 --> 02:34:23,790
we're in front of us but not so that
you have to agree. No growth hormone,

2575
02:34:23,800 --> 02:34:25,730
no test or on. So it's a great, great,

2576
02:34:25,750 --> 02:34:30,750
great [inaudible] but you should get off
high blood pressure medication before

2577
02:34:34,781 --> 02:34:35,620
you get on anything.

2578
02:34:35,830 --> 02:34:39,920
What you should kill yourself first
and then figure out the rest. Yeah.

2579
02:34:40,010 --> 02:34:44,080
Her shit she should see as large as you.
Hold on.

2580
02:34:44,140 --> 02:34:46,630
You got all the way down to like
two 12 or something like that.

2581
02:34:46,631 --> 02:34:50,010
What did you weigh?
The impulse problems first search.

2582
02:34:50,130 --> 02:34:53,340
What did you get up to on this tour?
Tell them 500 euro

2583
02:34:55,330 --> 02:34:59,810
tell you a secret.
[inaudible]

2584
02:35:00,830 --> 02:35:03,910
picture showed it and it was such a
fucking disgusting picture of Burt and

2585
02:35:03,911 --> 02:35:08,800
Burgos was a shellfish reaction.
Denmark. Shellfish reaction in Denmark.

2586
02:35:08,801 --> 02:35:11,810
That's hilarious. Okay,
wait, wait. Here's the way.

2587
02:35:11,811 --> 02:35:13,450
Now this is important for the challenge.
So we all,

2588
02:35:13,510 --> 02:35:16,980
I think we all have to track the
miles the same way. Right? Is,

2589
02:35:17,050 --> 02:35:22,050
is there going to be a stipulation that
these miles can only be tracked outdoors

2590
02:35:23,230 --> 02:35:25,930
on pavement? Yes, because
it's, you're on a treadmill.

2591
02:35:25,931 --> 02:35:30,670
If it's GPS treadmill's not gonna show
anything on GPS. It has to be movement.

2592
02:35:30,710 --> 02:35:33,960
Okay. Actually a surgical move.
Mead we're talking about, no,

2593
02:35:34,220 --> 02:35:36,880
it just distance run verse walk this.

2594
02:35:36,881 --> 02:35:41,080
There's an app I saw recently that tracks
walking and it takes a lot longer to

2595
02:35:41,081 --> 02:35:42,610
walk.
A mile done to run a mile.

2596
02:35:42,611 --> 02:35:46,630
But you walk all day because
you know you should be,

2597
02:35:46,631 --> 02:35:49,260
if you're tired and you're running and
you want to walk for a mile, that's fine.

2598
02:35:50,110 --> 02:35:53,440
You remember this little lady all
distance walking around silver lake.

2599
02:35:53,441 --> 02:35:55,330
Do you ever that guy?
No. Silver Lake Walker.

2600
02:35:55,331 --> 02:35:58,480
This dude looked like a fucking lizard.
He just walk around Silver Lake Dude.

2601
02:35:58,540 --> 02:36:01,870
He would walk. I'm not
kidding. He was all from, yeah,

2602
02:36:01,990 --> 02:36:06,550
from like 6:00 AM. And you would
see him at 8:00 PM schizophrenia.

2603
02:36:06,850 --> 02:36:10,360
He was a doctor? Yes. He, there
was like a little scandal there.

2604
02:36:10,361 --> 02:36:15,160
He died in this hot tub. So you would
see this guy in a hot tub somewhere.

2605
02:36:15,220 --> 02:36:16,810
There he is the guy that's him.

2606
02:36:17,230 --> 02:36:19,000
So he would just walk around
and trying to slink Dick.

2607
02:36:19,030 --> 02:36:21,550
I don't know what guys slings, debt.
And he would hold the newspaper.

2608
02:36:21,551 --> 02:36:24,850
I used to see this dude [inaudible]
around like that. Yes. All Day.

2609
02:36:25,370 --> 02:36:28,830
So he would read
it,

2610
02:36:28,840 --> 02:36:32,470
said click on that lower picture again.
It said he killed himself. Look at that.

2611
02:36:32,500 --> 02:36:36,730
Killed himself. Yeah.
Oh my God. That's wow.

2612
02:36:36,731 --> 02:36:40,610
This has conclude hailed
himself. La Corner concludes.
Yeah. Well see had there,

2613
02:36:40,640 --> 02:36:45,360
but that wasn't initially the,
the report about story, story,

2614
02:36:45,490 --> 02:36:46,323
story,

2615
02:36:46,630 --> 02:36:50,790
that it was a mystery how this guy had
died while there was a history song. Yeah,

2616
02:36:51,080 --> 02:36:55,620
I guess of about Rutgers.
Yeah.

2617
02:36:55,900 --> 02:36:59,890
Can I tell especially where like, well
who says, oh, the corner. Okay. Toenails,

2618
02:37:00,120 --> 02:37:03,620
driveway. What you did there? Can
I tell you to tone? It was late.

2619
02:37:03,700 --> 02:37:07,480
I was late to his stuff. Yeah, they're
pretty, he has his toenails painted.

2620
02:37:07,570 --> 02:37:09,910
They're all pretty,
he's got like really beautiful.

2621
02:37:10,030 --> 02:37:13,480
I'll take a picture with
Kathleen and Kathleen Madigan.

2622
02:37:13,600 --> 02:37:18,470
No Mcgee. Yeah, in Calgary.
Uh, can I just tell you this?

2623
02:37:18,471 --> 02:37:19,380
I was late for the stand.

2624
02:37:19,381 --> 02:37:21,940
This is like about a year ago when the
Stan was still open and I was like fuck.

2625
02:37:21,941 --> 02:37:24,080
And I started running,
how was it second?

2626
02:37:24,830 --> 02:37:27,680
I was at 16th Street and second avenue.

2627
02:37:27,681 --> 02:37:29,560
I started running and eventually
I was like, I was out of steam.

2628
02:37:29,580 --> 02:37:34,460
I had to like stop and I stopped. I was
at 16th Street, not yet to third avenue.

2629
02:37:35,780 --> 02:37:39,890
So I,
I tire out under a block show.

2630
02:37:40,970 --> 02:37:44,350
Really enjoying the idea of going into
this and just totally to run a position

2631
02:37:44,900 --> 02:37:48,680
last year. I don't know why you
got into like a fucking zone.

2632
02:37:48,710 --> 02:37:52,310
You got to know zone you. He thought
he was going to wait at one point.

2633
02:37:52,311 --> 02:37:53,720
The other runners body, he, there was a,

2634
02:37:53,721 --> 02:37:57,230
there was a moment somewhere around
week when you said, I got to go. No,

2635
02:37:57,231 --> 02:37:59,570
when you said I got to go hunting them
offline for a second. I was like, oh,

2636
02:37:59,571 --> 02:38:04,550
I'm close. Yeah. I had to go hunting
for but I shot an elk on the second day.

2637
02:38:05,820 --> 02:38:09,170
We have been a little more like you think
it would have been a little easier on

2638
02:38:09,200 --> 02:38:13,850
us if you had hiked hunted for five days.
Yeah, but that was wearing my thing,

2639
02:38:14,090 --> 02:38:18,290
so I was hiking. I was, I got
600 points one day hiking,

2640
02:38:20,090 --> 02:38:22,730
hiking, man, your heart
rate didn't use you fuck up.

2641
02:38:22,731 --> 02:38:24,980
You're going to came back from hunting.
You did more than that.

2642
02:38:26,300 --> 02:38:30,890
Can you just put yourself as a thousand
in a day on one day it's going to happen

2643
02:38:30,891 --> 02:38:31,490
yet.
One day,

2644
02:38:31,490 --> 02:38:35,630
100 I did 900 and then I came in here
and worked out for another hour after I

2645
02:38:35,631 --> 02:38:39,560
was done. So I did. That was hurting.
I was hurting that last day, man.

2646
02:38:39,561 --> 02:38:43,070
You guys shot. Remember?
Okay, October 18th you wait,

2647
02:38:43,071 --> 02:38:46,760
you're going to wake up and you go,
fuck. I have to just run a bunch now.

2648
02:38:47,810 --> 02:38:52,040
Christina's like, let's hang out.
[inaudible] I know, I know, I know. Yeah,

2649
02:38:52,041 --> 02:38:55,700
it's not going to be a mom puts a bad
month and you're all going to die.

2650
02:38:56,150 --> 02:39:01,110
I'm cool with it. There's that too.
You'll come in for a second for a second.

2651
02:39:01,410 --> 02:39:06,020
First of Cyrus probably first, but um,
maybe second something spectacular.

2652
02:39:06,021 --> 02:39:08,350
It seems outrageous that I'm
going to be getting on growth.

2653
02:39:08,640 --> 02:39:12,620
[inaudible]
we'd love to do growth.

2654
02:39:12,650 --> 02:39:14,740
I should go do that,
but let's sign off on this.

2655
02:39:14,750 --> 02:39:18,170
That you should definitely lose some
weight. Shouldn't just get on stuff.

2656
02:39:18,200 --> 02:39:20,390
You should stop drinking so much speaking.

2657
02:39:21,490 --> 02:39:25,280
It's going to be easy to
dude what Australia, you're
not going to drink at all

2658
02:39:28,610 --> 02:39:30,380
when you're over there.
You definitely won't drink.

2659
02:39:30,381 --> 02:39:32,660
I mean they don't even like drinking
and Australia and they'll set a good

2660
02:39:32,661 --> 02:39:36,560
example. Dog kind. They don't accept,

2661
02:39:36,561 --> 02:39:39,910
you're not tricking people go hard over.
Yeah.

2662
02:39:39,950 --> 02:39:42,720
Maybe you're not doing this fucking cut
up coke we're doing tonight for your or

2663
02:39:42,721 --> 02:39:45,360
for shirts right there.
You can have to do shoeys over there.

2664
02:39:45,361 --> 02:39:48,110
You're going to have to drink beer.
She would see me do the show either on TV.

2665
02:39:48,350 --> 02:39:51,970
I don't even want to know. Pull up
chewy. It's still good friend picture.

2666
02:39:53,580 --> 02:39:57,800
Yeah. Um, I like running. I
just, uh, I'm cool with it.

2667
02:39:59,120 --> 02:40:03,230
I'm cool with those social media. Your
ledgers walked into his own thing. Again.

2668
02:40:04,350 --> 02:40:06,530
I'm the only one that came
up with an idea that was fun.

2669
02:40:06,531 --> 02:40:08,990
It was like jumped on board with
it, man. I think it's a good idea.

2670
02:40:09,530 --> 02:40:11,540
I told you I like
durable. I do. I like it.

2671
02:40:11,630 --> 02:40:16,180
I like the hip hop it in terms of none
of us have any experience that's on par

2672
02:40:16,240 --> 02:40:17,700
with the Cam. Brent. You, that's great.

2673
02:40:17,701 --> 02:40:21,290
That's judging part is a true problem
in parts of real problem. It's,

2674
02:40:21,320 --> 02:40:22,890
it's an untenable issue.

2675
02:40:23,080 --> 02:40:25,890
You're going to bring in these people
and they're going to go the reason why I

2676
02:40:25,891 --> 02:40:29,610
thought Burt one the fuck outta here.
Yeah,

2677
02:40:29,790 --> 02:40:34,140
get the fuck Outta here. I see
from different story points, work,

2678
02:40:34,141 --> 02:40:37,920
even mixture points for that.
Fuck you Bert.

2679
02:40:38,580 --> 02:40:41,640
Fuck you. You can't win like
that. If you're going to win,

2680
02:40:41,670 --> 02:40:44,880
it's going to be you have to win
and that's what you're scared of.

2681
02:40:45,150 --> 02:40:49,800
You're scared of. We usually straight
up when something or wins for sure.

2682
02:40:49,830 --> 02:40:50,663
Sure.

2683
02:40:50,730 --> 02:40:55,730
Definitely 100% I love that you had or
to redline into my brain where you hit.

2684
02:40:56,460 --> 02:41:00,000
You can tell. You can see what gets
my heart rate. See anxiety forming.

2685
02:41:00,810 --> 02:41:03,120
I could see a forming in the
air above you is the order.

2686
02:41:03,121 --> 02:41:06,150
If we do the running thing, go
ahead and you get first. Okay,

2687
02:41:06,270 --> 02:41:09,210
you're promoter gets a second.
Let's just get third.

2688
02:41:09,900 --> 02:41:13,410
What's the promoter's name again?
Fuck. What's his name? The one guy.

2689
02:41:13,411 --> 02:41:14,560
The only use only.

2690
02:41:16,100 --> 02:41:19,380
I came in here today thinking I was going
to tell you guys like I'm out. Really?

2691
02:41:20,700 --> 02:41:25,290
You're doing it. You're doing all
right. We did mushrooms. You can't go.

2692
02:41:25,350 --> 02:41:28,560
You are doing this to doing
mushrooms for the show.

2693
02:41:28,600 --> 02:41:31,620
Might have been the fucking best
way to start this show. Feels good.

2694
02:41:32,640 --> 02:41:35,940
I'm gonna have to do that in November
I bought, my whole body is tingling.

2695
02:41:35,970 --> 02:41:38,340
It's like a nice match from high.
It's like it's,

2696
02:41:38,370 --> 02:41:40,520
it makes you realize what you
really like about mushrooms.

2697
02:41:40,521 --> 02:41:44,040
I've got November 3rd off. Are we, are we
gonna do a Gig together? The four of us?

2698
02:41:44,120 --> 02:41:47,790
Yes. I, Shit, I won't be here.
Where are you going to be? What?

2699
02:41:47,791 --> 02:41:52,030
The five flied back in November,
November 4th in New York all week.

2700
02:41:52,060 --> 02:41:54,610
You know what we should do in your work?
Let's go to New York all week.

2701
02:41:54,960 --> 02:41:57,720
We could two people down.
Okay.

2702
02:41:58,530 --> 02:42:01,200
Are you still doing winters out here?
Are you still doing the window?

2703
02:42:01,201 --> 02:42:04,750
I could do it in New York jobs. I
could do it in your show. Your show.

2704
02:42:06,150 --> 02:42:11,150
I know a venue or should know about
[inaudible] suggest that Jesus Christ.

2705
02:42:15,360 --> 02:42:20,320
So are you not coming out this way
at all? Uh, no. I, I, I come at it,

2706
02:42:20,330 --> 02:42:20,611
you know,

2707
02:42:20,611 --> 02:42:24,750
it'd be fun if we decide like the four
of just decided to do a destination.

2708
02:42:25,260 --> 02:42:29,460
Like I'm drunk some crazy thing in Vegas,

2709
02:42:29,461 --> 02:42:33,420
but that's not like really a destination
like Saskatoon, you know, we should do,

2710
02:42:33,810 --> 02:42:35,100
we should do some shit that's like,

2711
02:42:35,130 --> 02:42:38,040
that you don't normally get on a
tour like somewhere in Wyoming,

2712
02:42:38,400 --> 02:42:42,980
you know what I mean? Or Ida. Yeah, yeah,
yeah. I do Boise, Boise. I love boys.

2713
02:42:44,730 --> 02:42:48,630
Um, maybe we could do something
in like, um, slick guy,

2714
02:42:48,680 --> 02:42:53,640
Boise break his Ankle Co. Yeah, Mexico
or New Mexico, Not Mexico. Mexico, Bro.

2715
02:42:53,910 --> 02:42:57,000
New Mexico. I had ed called
her on the podcast of the day.

2716
02:42:57,001 --> 02:43:01,740
That's where I got this. Oh yeah, he's
Super Mexican. He's a border patrol guys.

2717
02:43:02,090 --> 02:43:07,090
He was describing the whole cartel wars
and how it all went down while it all

2718
02:43:07,471 --> 02:43:08,130
was happening.

2719
02:43:08,130 --> 02:43:12,160
Right when he signed up to be a cop and
he basically became a para operator,

2720
02:43:12,670 --> 02:43:16,630
like Jesus just trying to fucking deal
with shit that was going down the border

2721
02:43:16,631 --> 02:43:18,490
to try to take that and
then how to space it out.

2722
02:43:18,491 --> 02:43:22,030
So it's crumpled up trying
to get greedy hands, Montana.

2723
02:43:22,130 --> 02:43:26,890
What it is my [inaudible] Montana just
for us to hang out for the weekend show

2724
02:43:26,950 --> 02:43:27,221
to do it.

2725
02:43:27,221 --> 02:43:32,221
We'll do show and hang out or we
say November or November of Montana.

2726
02:43:32,530 --> 02:43:36,250
No. Yeah, as far as I go there
in November. Whew. All right.

2727
02:43:36,790 --> 02:43:39,640
Unless you like skiing. Well that's
when people go there for, yeah,

2728
02:43:39,710 --> 02:43:43,210
November's a season ready. She'll,
yeah, for sure. My Tommy in New York,

2729
02:43:43,550 --> 02:43:46,870
two days in big sky.

2730
02:43:46,900 --> 02:43:50,200
Saturday you're going to be there anyway.
Saturday. It's snowing in big sky.

2731
02:43:50,500 --> 02:43:53,110
He's going to be there that weekend
anyway, in November, New York. Yeah.

2732
02:43:53,260 --> 02:43:54,580
I'm going to be New
York and I got November.

2733
02:43:54,580 --> 02:43:58,090
Third off is my only weekend off
from standup all fall. Great.

2734
02:43:58,091 --> 02:44:01,090
Right after that weekend you come back
while hanging out Nila we and by the way,

2735
02:44:01,091 --> 02:44:04,810
we could just do a comedy
club to who gives a fuck?
Yes. That might be really fun,

2736
02:44:04,811 --> 02:44:08,420
man. Just book get charged so much. We can
charge their normal amount. The Bertram,

2737
02:44:08,480 --> 02:44:13,480
it's usually [inaudible] shake your hand.

2738
02:44:17,780 --> 02:44:20,860
Yeah. Have your promoter. I've never
charged. He didn't shake my hand.

2739
02:44:20,890 --> 02:44:21,723
You don't do that anymore.

2740
02:44:21,940 --> 02:44:24,190
I've never charged for meet and
greet in my entire life. That's fair.

2741
02:44:24,191 --> 02:44:26,830
Who says I'll never once I do.
I do a raffle.

2742
02:44:27,950 --> 02:44:31,000
People that do to take goes.
I think it's gross too,

2743
02:44:31,001 --> 02:44:34,450
but I bet you know what teaches
own friends to do it. I get it.

2744
02:44:35,350 --> 02:44:38,010
I told everyone agreeing on running.

2745
02:44:38,170 --> 02:44:40,840
Is that really going to be as easy
as crass what we did last time.

2746
02:44:41,020 --> 02:44:45,070
We've got plenty of time.
You have to agree to something Doug,

2747
02:44:45,071 --> 02:44:48,020
just because it was like, oh, fucking
time is running out of the podcast. Okay.

2748
02:44:49,240 --> 02:44:53,190
Hip Hop dancing and obviously
my first shirt fighting.

2749
02:44:53,260 --> 02:44:54,250
It's weird like that.

2750
02:44:54,850 --> 02:44:57,870
Let's split this roommate believe this
right in here for every show I do from

2751
02:44:57,871 --> 02:45:01,930
though like it look so pretty
bird. Huh? What'd you do?

2752
02:45:01,931 --> 02:45:04,490
Running the bed.

2753
02:45:04,690 --> 02:45:07,910
He wants it back and bad.

2754
02:45:09,460 --> 02:45:13,670
Who made that? Joe? What is the company
that made it pro and belts pro. Amp Bell.

2755
02:45:14,620 --> 02:45:19,510
Can you add an add on that shows a bunch
of pills on the side? Yeah, no weed,

2756
02:45:19,511 --> 02:45:23,500
no booze. It's like that's all there is
to try to keep it clean. It looks nice.

2757
02:45:23,501 --> 02:45:25,550
I can't wait for him. The belt.
You're going to have it, bro.

2758
02:45:25,551 --> 02:45:28,720
You have November 1st for
sure. Listen, I'm, I'm,

2759
02:45:28,721 --> 02:45:31,870
I'm well aware of what the training that
needs to go into this if we do running.

2760
02:45:32,030 --> 02:45:35,530
No, I personally think something
silly or would be benefited us,

2761
02:45:35,531 --> 02:45:39,640
but I'm cool with whatever you guys
pick because you're happy coming in last

2762
02:45:39,641 --> 02:45:44,020
with no consequences. Are you? Are
you saying you'll win either way?

2763
02:45:44,021 --> 02:45:47,480
No matter what it is. He just comes in
last. It doesn't matter. That's the thing.

2764
02:45:47,490 --> 02:45:51,370
Collapse all this shit. He riles you up
and I'm saying this is a guy who won.

2765
02:45:51,940 --> 02:45:55,750
It's not, it's not. It's not
right. Is it? W wait, do, wait.

2766
02:45:55,751 --> 02:45:57,040
How about the million dollar pair?

2767
02:45:58,210 --> 02:46:02,320
Are you going to do the million dollar
[inaudible] promote? It's not right.

2768
02:46:03,120 --> 02:46:07,300
Not Right. You fake
bragging's no shit. Bullshit.

2769
02:46:07,301 --> 02:46:10,100
I believe in my own fucking abilities.
That's the, that's horrific.

2770
02:46:10,101 --> 02:46:12,140
I believe a moment of those
horrific thing you said,

2771
02:46:12,150 --> 02:46:17,060
I believe in my own abilities. I
believe in myself. Yes. Las Vegas.

2772
02:46:17,061 --> 02:46:19,640
We'll open the action on this this year,

2773
02:46:19,880 --> 02:46:23,330
which we might be able to get them to do.
I'll say I know,

2774
02:46:23,331 --> 02:46:26,560
I'm betting I how many
things be honest challenge.

2775
02:46:26,890 --> 02:46:30,850
Just one every day he's got
to dre and today three weeks.

2776
02:46:31,140 --> 02:46:33,190
Seven mile. Four, three, seven

2777
02:46:36,360 --> 02:46:41,110
on that fucking bullshit.
That fucking awesome, right?

2778
02:46:41,220 --> 02:46:45,070
God, it's so hard at the air runners,
assault runner. I used to hate it.

2779
02:46:45,080 --> 02:46:47,690
Now I'm like that's going to get you in
shape for the real running that you have

2780
02:46:47,691 --> 02:46:51,980
to do when you come in last. Oh Man. Cause
that is harder than actually wait, wait,

2781
02:46:51,981 --> 02:46:53,360
wait.
Those things are harder than running.

2782
02:46:53,361 --> 02:46:57,410
It's like 15% or 13% I think he'll
do come in second again. I think so.

2783
02:46:58,700 --> 02:47:00,200
Yeah. I'll come and
second. He'll get crazy.

2784
02:47:00,260 --> 02:47:02,270
You're doing the thing that
you're kind of doing the opposite.

2785
02:47:02,271 --> 02:47:04,790
You guys are already better
than you guys know. All right.

2786
02:47:05,000 --> 02:47:08,750
Cause Ari and I have done Jujitsu together
so I know how competitive he gets.

2787
02:47:08,780 --> 02:47:10,820
Like when you're,
when you fight and for your life,

2788
02:47:11,120 --> 02:47:12,600
which is what you're doing
when you do what you did.

2789
02:47:12,601 --> 02:47:15,050
So you know what a guy's got
inside of them are extreme fears.

2790
02:47:15,050 --> 02:47:19,180
A little savage [inaudible]
life and running is a little
different. No, no, no, no,

2791
02:47:19,190 --> 02:47:22,730
no, no. It's his mind. That's why I knew
why I knew was going to come second.

2792
02:47:22,790 --> 02:47:25,910
I knew he was going to come in second
when we did this sober October thing.

2793
02:47:25,911 --> 02:47:30,710
I was just, yeah, it's two
fold. I'm running. I'm cool.
He gets crazy with stuff.

2794
02:47:31,250 --> 02:47:33,710
Let's go. I'm gonna Change my brain. I'll
switch it over. Let's go. Thank you Bert.

2795
02:47:33,800 --> 02:47:38,030
He doesn't, yeah, he doesn't
give up. Oh, oh, oh yes.

2796
02:47:38,031 --> 02:47:41,720
Now you to feel it. God doesn't
fold. This is already set up. What?

2797
02:47:41,750 --> 02:47:44,660
I feel like the only thing that's
not settled is led to, right.

2798
02:47:44,661 --> 02:47:48,040
That's not good for you. What's a good,
it's not good to talk shit and then talk,

2799
02:47:49,210 --> 02:47:52,340
listen, Talk Shit. And
then just to say, wait,

2800
02:47:52,341 --> 02:47:56,350
what is the big numbers comment?

2801
02:47:58,370 --> 02:47:59,780
I am Conor Mcgregor.
Nope.

2802
02:48:01,220 --> 02:48:05,440
Sometimes you talk shit and
you lose three years by Connor.

2803
02:48:05,710 --> 02:48:09,380
Sometimes you talk shit and you
lose. Okay. What's the punishment?

2804
02:48:09,430 --> 02:48:12,710
You just said I'm Conor Mcgregor.
Like kind of guy get knocked out.

2805
02:48:12,711 --> 02:48:13,790
Josie Aldo with one.

2806
02:48:13,791 --> 02:48:17,150
Conor McGregor was going to pick one
person on this podcast to get behind.

2807
02:48:17,151 --> 02:48:21,890
Who Do you think it would
be be? Breo it seems weird.

2808
02:48:22,100 --> 02:48:23,750
He compensated and be like my guy.

2809
02:48:23,751 --> 02:48:26,320
I'll bet [inaudible] he
would do one on the window.

2810
02:48:26,330 --> 02:48:30,100
Can I tell me what he would
do? Let's team up. Let's help.

2811
02:48:30,150 --> 02:48:32,900
This is what Connor would, they got them
on mushrooms. If there was a fucking,

2812
02:48:33,200 --> 02:48:34,280
if there was an audience,

2813
02:48:34,670 --> 02:48:39,020
he would get them all going about how
it's you and then when it's like press the

2814
02:48:39,021 --> 02:48:41,350
button to vote. Right.
Then he would go, Ciao.

2815
02:48:42,400 --> 02:48:46,410
[inaudible] Rogan.

2816
02:48:46,850 --> 02:48:51,170
Talk about your showmanship and you'd like
to, do you think you would lose money?

2817
02:48:51,171 --> 02:48:54,590
Just cause he likes that you get drunk?
That's a good point. It's a good question.

2818
02:48:54,800 --> 02:48:59,320
He loses money cause he loves that you
brag and then fall down and then get back,

2819
02:48:59,570 --> 02:49:04,300
get back, get back, get back out of a man
who doesn't think with his liver. Yeah.

2820
02:49:04,370 --> 02:49:05,800
I think with my heart hurt.

2821
02:49:05,810 --> 02:49:10,790
What is the punishment [inaudible]

2822
02:49:10,900 --> 02:49:14,580
group on it. But I'm saying, let's say
let's start with you. You come in last.

2823
02:49:14,910 --> 02:49:19,680
What is the punishment for coming in?
Last name it $1 million.

2824
02:49:20,350 --> 02:49:21,630
So happy right now.

2825
02:49:25,140 --> 02:49:29,430
I can't even wrap my head
around the last. No, he's happy.

2826
02:49:29,431 --> 02:49:32,000
He's looking forward to it.
Comfortable.

2827
02:49:32,130 --> 02:49:35,490
He's looking forward to coming and lasted
in front of a fireplace, curled up.

2828
02:49:35,550 --> 02:49:37,590
Ah, no, no names.

2829
02:49:40,170 --> 02:49:44,940
Look at him, dude. This whatever's wrong
with me, but if it got me into comedy,

2830
02:49:44,941 --> 02:49:48,600
all the things that are wrong with me,
this is the base of it right here.

2831
02:49:48,601 --> 02:49:51,720
I set up my therapist on there. What
does that mean? Because content,

2832
02:49:51,721 --> 02:49:54,810
I believe I genuinely,

2833
02:49:56,390 --> 02:50:00,230
oh, are you believe in me. Believe in
myself in this moment. That's great.

2834
02:50:00,530 --> 02:50:03,170
I genuinely believe in myself. I
believe that you do that. I do.

2835
02:50:03,200 --> 02:50:06,790
I believe that you believe in yourself
a hundred percent to a hundred percent

2836
02:50:06,800 --> 02:50:07,490
thank you.
Also,

2837
02:50:07,490 --> 02:50:10,510
I know on some level you'll come in
fourth in anything we don't know about him

2838
02:50:10,511 --> 02:50:13,980
or set forth, but I'll tell you, I'll
be, I'll be very honest. Yeah, please.

2839
02:50:13,981 --> 02:50:16,640
As much as I believe in myself.
I know there's something wrong with Joe.

2840
02:50:17,450 --> 02:50:22,450
I know that Ari has this fucking have
no interest in you Gehrig's disease.

2841
02:50:24,350 --> 02:50:26,060
That's already this year.
Whatever it is,

2842
02:50:26,061 --> 02:50:29,820
Mickey Mantle and I know that Tom is
going to call me on the last day and go,

2843
02:50:29,821 --> 02:50:30,890
who you're done running,
right?

2844
02:50:31,670 --> 02:50:33,170
You're not going to throw me
under the bus on this one.

2845
02:50:33,910 --> 02:50:34,743
[inaudible]

2846
02:50:35,000 --> 02:50:36,810
how did you do that on
the last day I called him

2847
02:50:36,890 --> 02:50:40,790
but I fought him on track.
Now I'll try calling them on a treadmill,

2848
02:50:41,370 --> 02:50:45,210
Jim and I was like, I was moving. I was
like, are you doing? He was like, man,

2849
02:50:45,211 --> 02:50:48,870
I swear to you, and then I,
he's like doing, he goes,

2850
02:50:49,320 --> 02:50:50,700
I'm with my family right now.

2851
02:50:50,760 --> 02:50:55,170
I'm with my kids and I heard like kids
laughing and pds like roasting a thing.

2852
02:50:55,230 --> 02:50:56,610
I stayed on that trip.
I was like,

2853
02:50:56,611 --> 02:50:59,820
I still on some part of my
mind doesn't believe you.

2854
02:50:59,850 --> 02:51:03,810
I didn't believe I stayed on. I stayed
on and he goes, I swear to you, I'm done.

2855
02:51:03,811 --> 02:51:06,690
And I stayed in that
gym probably 40 minutes.

2856
02:51:06,691 --> 02:51:10,080
He's still put up good numbers that day,
but I did go like I couldn't do it.

2857
02:51:10,100 --> 02:51:13,180
It was a weird thing. I didn't
tell you guys. I got up.

2858
02:51:13,260 --> 02:51:16,200
I flew across the country then. Yeah, no,
you did tell me. Did I tell you that? Yes.

2859
02:51:16,470 --> 02:51:17,880
So I was like,
Oh shit about it.

2860
02:51:18,060 --> 02:51:21,180
What I loved about it is that we were
seeing everybody's numbers and he's high

2861
02:51:21,181 --> 02:51:24,060
on mushrooms, but I'm just
thinking about this. It's like,

2862
02:51:24,120 --> 02:51:27,660
can't we start slow and have like a art?
You did five miles call for the day.

2863
02:51:27,760 --> 02:51:30,960
It's me out. No, that's not it.
That's not how it's going to work.

2864
02:51:30,980 --> 02:51:35,920
Going to the dark place. Here's
what I'm well aware of. Oh,

2865
02:51:35,921 --> 02:51:37,670
I'm going to give you the
cards in my hand right now.

2866
02:51:38,870 --> 02:51:42,050
I've run a 26 miles in a day.
Yeah,

2867
02:51:42,380 --> 02:51:47,380
and I know that Joe's first day of running
26 miles is going to put him back for

2868
02:51:47,601 --> 02:51:49,790
a couple of you said really
hard to go right into that.

2869
02:51:50,080 --> 02:51:54,940
So now he's going to train ahead
of time in October 1st you moron.

2870
02:51:54,980 --> 02:51:57,950
No, I know. I know. I know. I know.
I know when I know for a fact,

2871
02:51:58,830 --> 02:52:02,180
I know for me to leave this
place, its start. If we make,

2872
02:52:03,230 --> 02:52:06,370
if that's the agreement
I'm to get down to a 180

2873
02:52:06,370 --> 02:52:11,130
pounds. I'm going to lose
2100 I can do that. Nobody.

2874
02:52:11,170 --> 02:52:15,850
I mean like like in your head. Oh I'm
sorry. 20 pounds. It's already done.

2875
02:52:16,180 --> 02:52:19,060
Yeah. I'm going to lose 20
pounds and I'm going to run.

2876
02:52:19,090 --> 02:52:24,090
I will start off like with 10 I'll do
like 10 every other day and then by the

2877
02:52:24,281 --> 02:52:29,070
time October ramps around, I'll be doing
a marathon a day. It's kind of suck.

2878
02:52:29,320 --> 02:52:33,790
It's going to suck. You'll do that
every day. Yeah. I'm going to have to,

2879
02:52:34,150 --> 02:52:35,890
I'm going to have to show
her what the fuck is up then.

2880
02:52:35,891 --> 02:52:38,650
I'm not gonna talk to him anymore.
I don't like how the end of the

2881
02:52:40,400 --> 02:52:44,470
it lasts. I'm going to block his number.
I'm just like, I can't do this anymore.

2882
02:52:44,780 --> 02:52:49,780
Fuck hip hop dance is so much more fun.

2883
02:52:50,330 --> 02:52:54,220
All right. This shouldn't be fun. I got
to pee can be fun. It shouldn't be fun.

2884
02:52:54,221 --> 02:52:56,470
She'd be terrifying.
Last year was terrified.

2885
02:52:57,040 --> 02:52:59,980
If I come in last this year and there's
all these fucking repercussions,

2886
02:52:59,981 --> 02:53:02,250
and then he came in last and had
nothing wrong with that. Right.

2887
02:53:02,260 --> 02:53:06,220
It's super unfair. It's unfair.
Right? Someone should punish you.

2888
02:53:07,000 --> 02:53:09,590
You should be punished. Birth.
Wait, why do I get punished?

2889
02:53:11,100 --> 02:53:15,160
So give me a punishment.
Punishment APP.

2890
02:53:15,340 --> 02:53:19,360
Eat your own shit. How much I spoonful
Jesus Christ. Oh Shit. What happens?

2891
02:53:19,390 --> 02:53:22,930
I don't know. Why don't you just give
us each 300 grand and it's settled?

2892
02:53:26,330 --> 02:53:29,680
Ah, fuck. Ugh. Can I just say that?

2893
02:53:29,681 --> 02:53:32,620
I'm going to be Columbus next weekend
so you guys will come out and see where

2894
02:53:32,621 --> 02:53:36,130
the fuck I love that place.
Even bigger, right? Yeah,

2895
02:53:36,131 --> 02:53:39,100
but don't do strokes when you come to
see my show. Just don't do it. Great.

2896
02:53:39,101 --> 02:53:42,940
Club Columbus. Yeah, that's great club.
It's a great town for stand up to.

2897
02:53:43,600 --> 02:53:47,080
It's not as good as the met. July
27th in Philly. Oh my God. Oh,

2898
02:53:47,090 --> 02:53:50,560
I'm announcing a shitload
of dates tomorrow. Are you
ready? Yeah, I know some. No,

2899
02:53:50,710 --> 02:53:54,010
I can't. I don't know where I'm going.
In Cardiff, Wales, June 25th for Ari.

2900
02:53:54,011 --> 02:53:55,110
Shapiro [inaudible],

2901
02:53:55,140 --> 02:54:00,100
shapiro.com all of them will be
announced tomorrow. I'll put it,

2902
02:54:00,101 --> 02:54:03,840
but um, I got some dates coming. Let's
do your presale. So there's some,

2903
02:54:03,930 --> 02:54:06,370
there's still a hundred tickets
left for Chicago this weekend too.

2904
02:54:06,780 --> 02:54:08,330
Where are you at in Chicago?
Some arena.

2905
02:54:08,700 --> 02:54:11,890
Jesus to Rogan eyewear at Chicago
in Salads. And they were like,

2906
02:54:11,891 --> 02:54:16,240
this is fucking super sweet.
The Salad. And then we asked,

2907
02:54:16,241 --> 02:54:18,910
some lady were like, couldn't
believe it. And we're like,

2908
02:54:19,060 --> 02:54:22,210
did you put sugar on the salad? And
she was like, is it too sweet for you?

2909
02:54:23,260 --> 02:54:25,750
Why would you put down your chicken
and salad? And we looked around,

2910
02:54:25,751 --> 02:54:29,260
the fittest person looked like Burt. It
was like everybody there was massive day.

2911
02:54:29,261 --> 02:54:34,150
Love that fat deep dish pizza.
Those are hardy. Midwest folk. Yeah.

2912
02:54:34,360 --> 02:54:38,440
I love San Diego. Yeah, I love Chicago.
Yeah, but they put sugar on their salad.

2913
02:54:39,470 --> 02:54:44,170
One moment. Take a break. Nope. Get into
it for just one extra pop with your pop.

2914
02:54:44,500 --> 02:54:49,450
Yeah. Want more sugar on your shout
sugar? Where are you playing there?

2915
02:54:49,451 --> 02:54:54,450
A massive place, Huh? Yeah. Some big ass
place. Damn. Is it different than this?

2916
02:54:54,620 --> 02:54:57,030
Like, how different is it than the
store? This is different. Yeah.

2917
02:54:57,040 --> 02:55:01,300
Explain to people the difference between
a small hundred seat room to it's five,

2918
02:55:01,301 --> 02:55:05,510
six. But here's the problem is the same
material you're gonna put on a special

2919
02:55:05,650 --> 02:55:06,120
deliver.

2920
02:55:06,120 --> 02:55:09,770
When you deliberate a 6,000 people
realize you're delivering to one person on

2921
02:55:09,771 --> 02:55:13,010
the couch. Is it like, do you,
it's different kind of show.

2922
02:55:13,030 --> 02:55:16,130
Do you find yourself talking louder or
like stuff like that? It's different.

2923
02:55:16,131 --> 02:55:18,440
I mean if you're there,
it's fun,

2924
02:55:18,620 --> 02:55:22,250
but I don't think it would translate
correctly if you're at home.

2925
02:55:22,400 --> 02:55:26,540
And that's one of the reasons why I think
like I did my last one at the Wilbur,

2926
02:55:26,541 --> 02:55:29,960
which is pretty tight. He's like three
comedy clubs stacked on top of each other.

2927
02:55:29,960 --> 02:55:34,010
It's 1100 seats, but it's pretty intimate.
Like the people are on top of you.

2928
02:55:34,310 --> 02:55:38,150
I think that's how you're supposed to
do comedy at a special because specials,

2929
02:55:38,780 --> 02:55:42,050
it's hard to be in that room.
And I, I've been saying this,

2930
02:55:42,140 --> 02:55:47,060
I don't see if you agree with me. Um, I
think that a special is only at its best,

2931
02:55:47,390 --> 02:55:52,390
like maybe 80% of what it's
like to actually be in the
room because you miss the

2932
02:55:52,461 --> 02:55:57,320
feeling of being in the crowd and I
tried to get my shirts and I haven't ever

2933
02:55:57,321 --> 02:55:59,390
gotten as close as possible
to love experience,

2934
02:55:59,391 --> 02:56:04,010
but you can see a show at a Mexican
restaurant on a Tuesday with a bunch of

2935
02:56:04,011 --> 02:56:05,240
amateurs and you'll laugh.

2936
02:56:05,300 --> 02:56:08,450
You'll laugh harder than watching any of
our specials on loan in your apartment.

2937
02:56:08,510 --> 02:56:13,430
Yeah. Comedy has you really being there
live, it's amazing. What makes it,

2938
02:56:13,520 --> 02:56:13,980
that's what makes,

2939
02:56:13,980 --> 02:56:18,180
I think a lot of comics mess up and they
do their special for the room and they

2940
02:56:18,181 --> 02:56:21,930
go like, oh, what's up? What's up
here? The place I'm at, I'm at Dell,

2941
02:56:21,940 --> 02:56:22,701
but Kat Williams,

2942
02:56:22,701 --> 02:56:26,480
the best part of his special was the 10
minutes he did on Tallahassee or checks

2943
02:56:26,481 --> 02:56:30,430
and jack die hard disagree
by the way,

2944
02:56:30,450 --> 02:56:35,000
shout big fucking Katt Williams fam that
I loved that he was John Williams stuff,

2945
02:56:35,240 --> 02:56:37,850
but we talked about that, about
doing it, not for the rooms.

2946
02:56:38,230 --> 02:56:42,350
You've got to do it for the people.
You shoot a special for fucking Jackson,

2947
02:56:42,351 --> 02:56:46,880
but his window, you guys especially
are doing these massive, massive,

2948
02:56:46,881 --> 02:56:47,714
massive rooms.

2949
02:56:48,080 --> 02:56:52,460
But then when people are going to see
your special almost hold them are watching

2950
02:56:52,490 --> 02:56:53,060
like,
you know,

2951
02:56:53,060 --> 02:56:56,630
really tough doing my special in a big
room up to it's like less than a thousand.

2952
02:56:57,020 --> 02:56:59,480
I'm thinking of doing a, at the icehouse
I've been thinking about doing that,

2953
02:56:59,820 --> 02:57:03,040
talking about for a while. I'm pretty
far out and doing special. I'm,

2954
02:57:03,041 --> 02:57:05,240
I'm at least a year away
from even thinking about it.

2955
02:57:05,630 --> 02:57:08,510
I think the most important thing about
other special is doing in a place that

2956
02:57:08,511 --> 02:57:11,870
has not seen you do stand up. That's
the number one most important thing.

2957
02:57:11,900 --> 02:57:14,270
I would do a special at the store.
Uh,

2958
02:57:14,300 --> 02:57:16,390
I would find that to be a mistake
because you're there all the time.

2959
02:57:16,420 --> 02:57:18,050
You've been working on this
material in front of those people.

2960
02:57:18,051 --> 02:57:20,750
If it fucks your head up. What
about the people who, well,

2961
02:57:20,751 --> 02:57:24,140
I got it on the level of like some of
the jokes are surprise ending and they

2962
02:57:24,141 --> 02:57:26,710
kind of like know what's going there and
they're like, right, right. That's true.

2963
02:57:26,711 --> 02:57:29,510
You don't want to do a special for
people that have seen this material ever.

2964
02:57:29,600 --> 02:57:32,090
You want those people to never have
seen this material the same way.

2965
02:57:32,091 --> 02:57:35,870
The people that are home never seen
that 1 million people in their labor.

2966
02:57:36,550 --> 02:57:38,330
You have a job.
A lot of them will show up.

2967
02:57:38,730 --> 02:57:41,380
A lot of your two mega fans are
going to show up and go, dude,

2968
02:57:41,390 --> 02:57:43,850
I just saw them like six months ago.
I want to come and see it. Well,

2969
02:57:43,851 --> 02:57:46,850
what's interesting about the store
right now and say you get comedy tourism

2970
02:57:46,851 --> 02:57:47,220
there,

2971
02:57:47,220 --> 02:57:50,210
where are you getting a lot of people
that come to visit the store from all over

2972
02:57:50,211 --> 02:57:53,120
the world? Yeah, true.
Let's see. I met some dudes,

2973
02:57:53,121 --> 02:57:54,830
they're just the other day
from England and Ireland.

2974
02:57:54,860 --> 02:57:58,460
They flew in for the weeks while
stand up stories in massive right now,

2975
02:57:58,590 --> 02:58:02,090
great stores everywhere, man.
Really is. But I, but I, I'm the,

2976
02:58:02,180 --> 02:58:03,840
the two things I have in my head is,
Oh,

2977
02:58:03,841 --> 02:58:06,180
like a rock venue and I'd
like a place I haven't done,

2978
02:58:06,300 --> 02:58:08,970
I haven't done this material in
front of you announced it yet.

2979
02:58:08,971 --> 02:58:13,110
Where are you doing or no? Yeah.
Cleveland 23rd of November.
