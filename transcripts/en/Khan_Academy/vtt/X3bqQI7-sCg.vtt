00:00:00.607 --> 00:00:02.604
- [Voiceover] As we've already
seen in the last few videos,

00:00:02.604 --> 00:00:07.039
with the war officially
starting in September of 1939,

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:10.545
the Axis powers get momentum
through the end of 1939,

00:00:10.545 --> 00:00:12.217
all the way into 1940.

00:00:12.217 --> 00:00:14.585
That was the last video that
we covered and that takes us

00:00:14.585 --> 00:00:18.672
to 1941 and what we're
gonna see in 1941 which is

00:00:18.672 --> 00:00:21.900
the focus of this video is
that the Axis powers only seem

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.851
to gain more momentum.

00:00:23.851 --> 00:00:25.458
Because of all of that momentum they

00:00:25.458 --> 00:00:27.626
perhaps gets a little bit
overconfident and stretch

00:00:27.626 --> 00:00:31.109
themselves or begin to
stretch themselves too thin.

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.128
So let's think about what happens in 1941.

00:00:34.128 --> 00:00:37.262
So, if we talk about early
1941 or the Spring of 1941,

00:00:37.262 --> 00:00:41.429
in March, Bulgaria decides
to join the Axis powers.

00:00:43.811 --> 00:00:45.993
You can imagine there's a lot
of pressuring applied to them

00:00:45.993 --> 00:00:48.315
and they kind of see
where the momentum is.

00:00:48.315 --> 00:00:50.893
Let's be on that side.

00:00:50.893 --> 00:00:53.810
Bulgaria joins the Axis and then in

00:00:56.442 --> 00:01:00.111
North Africa you might remember
that in 1940, the Allies,

00:01:00.111 --> 00:01:03.292
in particular, the British,
were able to defeat the Italians

00:01:03.292 --> 00:01:07.459
and push them back into Libya
but now in March of 1941, the

00:01:09.306 --> 00:01:12.626
Italians get reinforcements,
Italian reinforcements and also

00:01:12.626 --> 00:01:15.343
German reinforcements
under the command of Rommel

00:01:15.343 --> 00:01:19.510
the Desert Fox, famous desert
commander and they are able to

00:01:22.063 --> 00:01:26.230
push the British back to the
Egyptian border and they also

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.606
take siege of the town of Tobruk.

00:01:31.606 --> 00:01:32.439
Now, you might have

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:33.789
noticed something that I just drew.

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:35.706
The supply lines in the

00:01:36.668 --> 00:01:40.406
North Africa campaign are very,
very, very long and that's

00:01:40.406 --> 00:01:42.914
part of the reason why there's one side.

00:01:42.914 --> 00:01:45.997
One side has supply lines and as they

00:01:47.233 --> 00:01:50.437
start to make progress and as the Allies

00:01:50.437 --> 00:01:53.433
make progress and push into
Libya, their supply lines got

00:01:53.433 --> 00:01:55.476
really long and so the other

00:01:55.476 --> 00:01:56.683
side has an easier timely supply.

00:01:56.683 --> 00:02:00.283
Then as the Axis pushes
the Allies back into Egypt,

00:02:00.283 --> 00:02:02.930
then their supply lines get
really long and the other

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.831
side...it makes it easier for
them to resupply and so North

00:02:06.831 --> 00:02:10.360
Africa is kind of defined by
this constant back and forth.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.527
But, by early 1941, it looks
like the Axis is on the

00:02:15.399 --> 00:02:18.255
offensive, able to push the
British back into Egypt lay

00:02:18.255 --> 00:02:21.413
siege to the town of Tobruk.

00:02:21.413 --> 00:02:24.803
So, let me write this
down as North Africa.

00:02:24.803 --> 00:02:26.800
So, I'll just say North
Africa over here or

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.610
I'll could say Rommel in North Africa

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.693
pushing the British back.

00:02:35.484 --> 00:02:39.362
And then we can start
talking about what happens in

00:02:39.362 --> 00:02:42.914
the Balkans and this is still
in Spring as we go into April

00:02:42.914 --> 00:02:46.560
of 1941 and just as a little
bit of background here, and

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.952
frankly I should have covered
it a couple of videos ago.

00:02:48.952 --> 00:02:53.526
As far back as 1939, actually
before World War II officially

00:02:53.526 --> 00:02:57.693
started, in Spring of 1939,
Italy actually occupies Albania

00:02:59.029 --> 00:03:02.860
so this actually should
have already been red.

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.943
This is in 1939 that this happens and

00:03:07.481 --> 00:03:09.896
then at the end of 1940, Italy

00:03:09.896 --> 00:03:14.063
uses Albania as a base of
operation to try to invade Greece

00:03:16.797 --> 00:03:19.486
but they are pushed back.

00:03:19.486 --> 00:03:21.692
Actually one of the reasons why

00:03:21.692 --> 00:03:24.827
the British we able to be
pushed back in North Africa is

00:03:24.827 --> 00:03:27.758
after they were successful
against the Italians, most of the

00:03:27.758 --> 00:03:32.512
bulk of the British forces we
sent to Greece to help defend

00:03:32.512 --> 00:03:34.679
Greece at the end of 1940.

00:03:36.065 --> 00:03:39.316
So, in 1939, Albania gets taken

00:03:39.316 --> 00:03:43.635
over by Italy and at the end
of 1940...October 1940, Greece

00:03:43.635 --> 00:03:47.802
is invaded by Italy but they
are then pushed back but to

00:03:57.892 --> 00:04:01.212
help the Greeks, the Allies
send many of the forces that

00:04:01.212 --> 00:04:03.790
were in North Africa after they
were successful against the

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.290
Italians in Libya.

00:04:06.135 --> 00:04:09.641
Now, as we go into April of 1941... that

00:04:09.641 --> 00:04:12.451
was all background, remember
Albania before the war started

00:04:12.451 --> 00:04:17.211
in April 1939, October 1940
was Italy's kind of first push

00:04:17.211 --> 00:04:19.835
into Greece and it was unsuccessful.

00:04:19.835 --> 00:04:23.573
Then the Greeks get
support from the Allies

00:04:23.573 --> 00:04:25.454
in North Africa and now as we go

00:04:25.454 --> 00:04:27.660
into 1941, the Germans start
supporting and really take

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.827
charge in Balkans and in Greece
and so with the help of the

00:04:33.883 --> 00:04:38.050
Germans the Axis is able to
take over Yugoslavia and Greece

00:04:41.267 --> 00:04:44.750
and start aerial bombardment of Crete.

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.722
So, once again, we're not
even halfway through the year

00:04:47.722 --> 00:04:49.805
in 1941 and we see a huge

00:04:51.251 --> 00:04:55.418
swath of Europe is under the
control of the Axis powers.

00:05:12.515 --> 00:05:15.682
And now we go into the summer of 1941.

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.180
This is actually a pivotal
move, what's about to happen.

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.852
Now you can imagine that the Axis powers,

00:05:23.852 --> 00:05:25.617
in particular, Hitler, are feeling

00:05:25.617 --> 00:05:26.638
pretty confident.

00:05:26.638 --> 00:05:30.354
We are only about that far into the war.

00:05:30.354 --> 00:05:33.024
So we're not even two years
into the war yet and it looks

00:05:33.024 --> 00:05:34.533
like the Axis is going to win.

00:05:34.533 --> 00:05:37.412
Now you might remember that

00:05:37.412 --> 00:05:38.245
they have a pact with the Soviet Union.

00:05:38.245 --> 00:05:40.060
Hey, we're gonna split
a lot of Eastern Europe

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.335
into our spheres of influence

00:05:42.335 --> 00:05:45.400
so to speak, but now Hitler's
like, well, I think I'm ready

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.118
to attack and when you attack

00:05:47.118 --> 00:05:48.860
the Soviet Union really matters.

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.553
You do not want to attack
the Soviet Union in the

00:05:51.553 --> 00:05:54.038
winter...or Russia in the winter.

00:05:54.038 --> 00:05:55.152
Russia's obviously at the

00:05:55.152 --> 00:05:56.778
heart of the Soviet Union.

00:05:56.778 --> 00:05:57.962
That something that Napoleon learned.

00:05:57.962 --> 00:05:59.332
Many military commanders have learnt.

00:05:59.332 --> 00:06:02.188
You do not want to be fighting in Russia

00:06:02.188 --> 00:06:04.673
over the winter, so summer of

00:06:04.673 --> 00:06:08.840
1941, Hitler figures, hey,
this is the Axis chance.

00:06:09.688 --> 00:06:13.855
And so, in June, he decides
to attack the Soviet Union.

00:06:22.964 --> 00:06:26.314
So, this is a very, very, very
bold move because now they're

00:06:26.314 --> 00:06:28.473
fighting the British.

00:06:28.473 --> 00:06:30.424
Remember, the British are kind of not

00:06:30.424 --> 00:06:33.907
a joke to be battling out
here in Western Europe and now

00:06:33.907 --> 00:06:37.854
they're going to be taking on
the Soviet Union in the east,

00:06:37.854 --> 00:06:40.873
a major, major world power.

00:06:40.873 --> 00:06:42.382
But at first, like always, it

00:06:42.382 --> 00:06:44.913
seems like it's going
well for the Germans.

00:06:44.913 --> 00:06:46.747
By September, they're able to

00:06:46.747 --> 00:06:49.497
push up all the way to Leningrad.

00:06:51.507 --> 00:06:55.674
So, this is September of 1941
and lay lay siege and begin

00:06:56.523 --> 00:06:57.498
laying siege to that town.

00:06:57.498 --> 00:07:00.215
This is kind of a long bloody
siege that happens there.

00:07:00.215 --> 00:07:03.465
So, we're right now, right about there.

00:07:04.464 --> 00:07:06.879
And most historians would tell
you that this was one of the

00:07:06.879 --> 00:07:10.292
mistakes of Adolph Hitler
because now he is stretched very,

00:07:10.292 --> 00:07:11.871
very, very thin.

00:07:11.871 --> 00:07:14.170
He has to fight two world powers, Soviet

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:17.537
Union and Great Britain and the
United States hasn't entered

00:07:17.537 --> 00:07:21.693
into the war yet and that's
what we're about to get into

00:07:21.693 --> 00:07:24.110
because if we go into Asia it

00:07:25.406 --> 00:07:28.656
was still in 1941 what happens in July.

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:35.801
So, little bit after
Hitler decides to start

00:07:35.801 --> 00:07:39.600
invading the Soviet Union going
back on the pact, the non-

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:40.631
aggression pact.

00:07:40.631 --> 00:07:42.929
In July, you could imagine the US, they

00:07:42.929 --> 00:07:45.205
were never pleased with what's
been happening, what the

00:07:45.205 --> 00:07:48.711
Empire of Japan has been doing
in the Pacific, what they've

00:07:48.711 --> 00:07:52.612
been doing in China, in
Manchuria or even in terms of the

00:07:52.612 --> 00:07:55.747
war in China, the second
Sino Japanese War.

00:07:55.747 --> 00:07:58.417
They weren't happy of the Japanese

00:07:58.417 --> 00:08:00.843
taking over French Indochina.

00:08:00.843 --> 00:08:03.499
There's a big world power
here, the Empire of Japan.

00:08:03.499 --> 00:08:05.566
There's a big world power here,
the United States, that has

00:08:05.566 --> 00:08:08.700
a lot of possessions in the
Pacific and so, the United

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:12.867
States in July of 1941...So
remember, this is still all

00:08:15.156 --> 00:08:19.289
1941, this is the same
year...decides to freeze the assets

00:08:19.289 --> 00:08:23.468
of Japan and probably the most
important part of that was an

00:08:23.468 --> 00:08:25.218
oil embargo of Japan.

00:08:29.134 --> 00:08:31.134
This is a big, big deal.

00:08:32.501 --> 00:08:33.917
Japan is fighting a major

00:08:33.917 --> 00:08:36.007
conflict with the Chinese.

00:08:36.007 --> 00:08:38.886
It's kind of flexing it's imperial muscles

00:08:38.886 --> 00:08:40.419
but it does not have many

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:42.903
natural resources in and of
itself and in fact, that's one

00:08:42.903 --> 00:08:46.108
of the reasons why it's trying
to colonize other places to

00:08:46.108 --> 00:08:48.360
get more control of natural resources.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:50.009
And now if it's fighting a war it doesn't

00:08:50.009 --> 00:08:51.797
have it's own oil resources and

00:08:51.797 --> 00:08:55.164
now there's an oil embargo of
Japan and the United States at

00:08:55.164 --> 00:08:57.811
the time was major oil producer
and even today, it's major

00:08:57.811 --> 00:08:59.413
oil producer.

00:08:59.413 --> 00:09:03.174
This was a big deal to
the Japanese because

00:09:03.174 --> 00:09:06.286
some estimates say they only
had about two years of reserves

00:09:06.286 --> 00:09:07.447
and they were fighting a war
where they might have to touch

00:09:07.447 --> 00:09:10.233
their reserves even more.

00:09:10.233 --> 00:09:11.232
So, you could imagine the

00:09:11.232 --> 00:09:14.273
Japanese, they want to have
their imperial ambitions.

00:09:14.273 --> 00:09:16.363
They probably want, especially now

00:09:16.363 --> 00:09:18.244
with this oil embargo, they

00:09:18.244 --> 00:09:20.798
probably want to take over
more natural resources and they

00:09:20.798 --> 00:09:25.210
probably want to knock out the
US or at least keep the US on

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:28.902
its heels so the US can't
stop Japan from doing what it

00:09:28.902 --> 00:09:29.902
wants to do.

00:09:31.549 --> 00:09:34.498
So, all it wants in
December 1941, that's over

00:09:34.498 --> 00:09:37.540
the course of December 7th
and 8th, and it gets a little

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:39.188
confusing because a lot
of this happens across the

00:09:39.188 --> 00:09:41.046
International Date Line.

00:09:41.046 --> 00:09:43.624
But over the course of December 7th

00:09:43.624 --> 00:09:46.619
and 8th, Japan goes on the
offensive in a major way in the

00:09:46.619 --> 00:09:47.452
Pacific.

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:52.517
Over the course of several
hours, at most, a day,

00:09:52.517 --> 00:09:56.684
Japan is able to attack
Malaya, which is a British

00:09:58.345 --> 00:09:59.762
possession.

00:09:59.762 --> 00:10:02.826
It's able to attack Pearl
Harbor, where the US

00:10:02.826 --> 00:10:06.170
Pacific fleet is in hope to
knock out the US Pacific fleet

00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:10.651
so the US will have trouble
stopping Japan from doing

00:10:10.651 --> 00:10:11.534
whatever Japan wants to do.

00:10:11.534 --> 00:10:12.764
In the US, we focus a lot on

00:10:12.764 --> 00:10:16.340
Pearl Harbor but this was just
one of the attacks in this

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:19.498
whole kind of several hours
of attacks where Japan went on

00:10:19.498 --> 00:10:20.665
the offensive.

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:26.093
So, we have Malaya, we
have Pearl Harbor, we

00:10:26.093 --> 00:10:30.260
have Singapore, we have Guam,
we have (which was the US

00:10:38.321 --> 00:10:39.154
military base), Wake Island.

00:10:39.154 --> 00:10:39.987
You have the Philippines, which

00:10:39.987 --> 00:10:43.902
was a US possession ever since
the Spanish American war.

00:10:43.902 --> 00:10:48.069
You have Hong Kong, which is
a British possession and then

00:10:49.104 --> 00:10:52.076
shortly after that as you get
further into December, so this

00:10:52.076 --> 00:10:55.493
is kind of when you have Japan offensive.

00:10:59.677 --> 00:11:01.898
Then as you go on into later Decemeber,

00:11:01.898 --> 00:11:05.218
the kind of real prize for Japan was

00:11:05.218 --> 00:11:08.934
what we would now call Indonesia
but the Dutch East Indies.

00:11:08.934 --> 00:11:11.116
On this map it says
Netherlands East Indies.

00:11:11.116 --> 00:11:13.763
You have to remember the
Netherlands had been overrun.

00:11:13.763 --> 00:11:14.715
They're the low countries they were

00:11:14.715 --> 00:11:17.757
already overrun by German forces so the

00:11:17.757 --> 00:11:21.658
Japanese say hey, look there
are a lot of resources here,

00:11:21.658 --> 00:11:23.446
natural resources, especially oil.

00:11:23.446 --> 00:11:25.443
Let's go for this and so

00:11:25.443 --> 00:11:30.017
by the end of 1941, they're
also going for the Dutch East

00:11:30.017 --> 00:11:33.733
Indies and for Burma so you
could imagine it's a very

00:11:33.733 --> 00:11:37.900
aggressive, very, very bold
move on Japan but they kind of

00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:41.836
had imperial ambitions.

00:11:41.836 --> 00:11:44.669
They were afraid of they access to

00:11:45.668 --> 00:11:47.664
natural resources so they went
for it but obviously one of

00:11:47.664 --> 00:11:50.126
the major consequence of this
is the United States was not

00:11:50.126 --> 00:11:52.262
happy about this and they

00:11:52.262 --> 00:11:54.538
were already sympathetic to the Allies.

00:11:54.538 --> 00:11:57.069
They didn't like what was
going on in Europe either.

00:11:57.069 --> 00:11:59.716
They didn't like what was
going on in China and so that

00:11:59.716 --> 00:12:04.151
causes the United States to
enter into World War II on the

00:12:04.151 --> 00:12:06.844
side of the Allies and then
the Axis powers to declare war

00:12:06.844 --> 00:12:10.427
on the United States,
which was a big deal.
