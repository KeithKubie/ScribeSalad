00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.940
We're asked to graph the
inequality y is less

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.920
than 3x plus 5.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.920
So if you give us any x-- and
let me label the axes here.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.170
So this is the x-axis.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.250
This is the y-axis.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.040
So this is saying you
give me an x.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.590
So let's say we take x is
equal to 1 right there.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.840
3 times 1 plus 5.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.510
So 3 times x plus 5.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.010
So 3 times 1 is 3 plus 5 is 8.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.730
So one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.970
This is saying that y
will be less than 8.

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.810
y will be less than
3 times 1 plus 5.

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:41.890
So the y-values that satisfy
this constraint for that x are

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.850
going to be all of these
values down here.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.500
Let me do it in a
lighter color.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.820
It'll be all of these values.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.430
For x is equal to 1, it'll be
all the values down here, and

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.180
it would not include
y is equal to 8.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.240
Y has to be less than 8.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.030
Now, if we kept doing that, we
would essentially just to

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.530
graph the line of y is equal to
3x plus 5, but we wouldn't

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.110
include it.

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.520
We would just include everything
below it, just like

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:08.700
we did right here.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.280
So we know how to graph just
y is equal to 3x plus 5.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.570
Let me write it over here.

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.820
So if I were to write y is equal
to 3x plus 5, we would

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.030
say, OK, 3 is the slope.

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.450
Slope is equal to 3, and then
5 is the y-intercept.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.700
Now, I could just graph the
line, but because that won't

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.070
be included in the y's that
satisfy this constraint, I'm

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.090
going to graph it as
a dotted line.

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.240
So we'll start with the
y-intercept of 5.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.540
So one, two, three,
four, five.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.900
That's the y-intercept.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.470
And the slope is 3.

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.990
So if you go over to
the 1, you go up 3.

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.240
So let me do that in that
darker purple color.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.750
So it'll look like this.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.660
It will look like that.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:54.740
That point would be on it.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:55.970
That point would be on it.

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.880
If you go back, you're going
to go down by 3.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.190
So that point will be on it,
that point, and that point,

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.530
and I'll just connect the
dots with a dotted line.

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.680
That dotted line is the graph
of y is equal to 3x plus 5,

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.040
but we're not going
to include it.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.480
So that's why I made it a dotted
line because we want

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.060
all of the y's that are
less than that.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.930
So for any x-- so
you pick an x.

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.700
Let's say x is equal
to negative 1.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.840
If you evaluate 3x plus 5 for
that x, you'd get here.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.220
But we only care about
the y's that are

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.660
strictly less than that.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.220
So you don't include the line.

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.110
It's everything below it.

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.680
So for any x you pick, it's
going to be below that line.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.500
You take the x, go up to that
line and everything below it.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.125
So for all of the x's, it's
going to be this entire area.

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.630
Let me draw it a little
bit neater than that.

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.120
It's going to be this entire
area that's under the line.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.010
I'll do it in this orange.

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.000
It's a little bit
easier to see.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:00.270
So this entire area under the
line is y is less than 3x.
