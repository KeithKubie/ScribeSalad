00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:11.280
For those of us raised in the digital age,
it’s not everyday we get to look at images

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.730
this way.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.980
Each of these tiny translucent photos hold
a moment in history... and in this room…

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.539
there are thousands of them.

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.890
This is environmental photographer Arthur
Tress.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.269
And if Instagram was around in the 60s, Arthur
would be its king.

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:37.190
I like showing people in relationship to the
world around them even if I’m doing a portrait

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:45.540
or city scape or the effect of man’s relationship
to nature, how he modifies it and changes

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:46.540
it.

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:53.511
Arthur grew up in Brooklyn and he used his
camera to show the changing landscape of New

00:00:53.511 --> 00:00:54.760
York.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.890
And during his twenties, the city was pretty
much unrecognizable from what it is today.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.330
The entire waterfront was just piled with
junk.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:09.060
There were huge garbage landfills that were
spilling all these toxic water into the areas,

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.060
neighborhoods.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:18.969
These great chimneys belching out black smoke,
it gives you an image of hell or the apocalypse.

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:21.360
New York City wasn’t always so ominous.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.640
In the 1940s, New York City saw a great deal
of post-WWII prosperity.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.359
Buildings rose from concrete to clouds as
the skyline took shape, and industry was thriving.

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:37.840
But in the decades to follow, the city began
showing the negative effects of its industrial

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.090
boom.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.539
When you’d go to your window sill, it’d
be covered with dust and dirt.

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:48.569
People would have a lot of cases of asthma
and coughing and your eyes would burn.

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:50.544
It was like what they have now in China, that
big smog.

00:01:50.544 --> 00:01:53.329
And that comparison probably isn’t that
far off.

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:59.590
During the 50 and 60s, New York City looked
a lot like Beijing does today.

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.619
Toxic smog has besieged this city for decades.

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:07.329
On some days, residents can’t even leave
their homes and there are documented widespread

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:12.190
health problems among its population, akin
to the problems felt in 1960s New York.

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.500
Now, the ill effects of toxic smog come down
to these little guys...

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:24.050
Particulates, tiny microscopic solid particles
or liquid droplets, suspended in the air commonly

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:30.810
created by burning fossil fuels or wood, as
well as power plants and industrial facilities.

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.250
Particulates suspended in the air vary in
size but essentially, the smaller they are,

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.819
the deeper they can penetrate your respiratory
system or even your bloodstream.

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:46.740
The EPA considers any particles smaller than
2.5 micrometers in diameter extremely hazardous

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:47.740
to breathe.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.530
And if you can’t wrap your head around how
small that is, then think about a human hair

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:59.580
which is around 70 micrometers in diameter
- that’s 30 times larger than fine particulates.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.510
Today these fine particulates are monitored
and measured by an air quality index or AQI

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:05.510
for short.

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.409
Where a range of 0-50 is considered safe.

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:15.590
To put Beijing’s pollution crisis into perspective,
over the past five years, the city saw readings

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:22.980
as high as 755... that’s so bad there isn’t
even a AQI category for it.

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.310
However, in the 1960s air pollution wasn’t
really measured in this way… which does

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.269
make it difficult to draw a quantifiable comparison.

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:37.819
What we do know is that scientists in the
1960s did report extremely elevated levels

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:43.349
of damaging air pollutants such as Carbon
Monoxide and Sulphur Dioxide in New York City.

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:49.799
In 1966, during a period of elevated air pollution,
known as the “killer smog”, researchers

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:54.689
found an increase in death rate of 24 deaths
per day.

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:59.280
The medical community acknowledged the toll
air pollution was taking on people's health

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.459
with one city medical examiner remarking “On
the autopsy table it’s unmistakable...The

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:09.620
person who spent his life in the Adirondacks
[Mountains] has nice pink lungs.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.040
The city dweller’s are black as coal.”

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:17.340
But for those who lived outside of the city,
some of the most impactful evidence of the

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.160
hazardous pollution that plagued New York,
were photos... like Arthur’s.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.690
in these areas, you’d find old dolls and
the carcasses of dead animals and birds.

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:22.810
… It was almost like a warzone.

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.390
And these photos became an important catalyst
in the fight to clean up the city.

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:32.860
the movement for doing that began with…
me actually in the 1960s.

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:40.030
The images I created like a thunderstorm over
New York Cemetery or the man coming through

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:46.669
the smoke became very well-known as kind of
environmental imagery.

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:51.430
Arthur’s photos were published in magazines
and put on posters in hopes that they would

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.080
be seen by people who had the power to enforce
change.

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:00.900
“We must act and act decisively, it is literally
now or never.”

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.949
In the 1970s, President Richard Nixon introduced
a slew of environmental policies and programs

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:08.460
intended to clean up America.

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.800
The Environmental Protection Agency was launched
and the companies dumping toxic waste into

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.910
waterways and releasing pollutants into the
air were held accountable.

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:21.540
When the EPA came along and said, “No, you
can’t keep doing that.

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:25.949
We have Clean Water and Clean Air Standards,”
it wasn’t easy.

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:32.759
It took time because these corporations fight
back as much as they can but eventually, it

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:34.850
did turn the tide.

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:39.940
Over time, New York City transformed into
the metropolis we know today.

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:45.000
And throughout the past six decades we’ve
learned just how fragile the environment really

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.030
is.

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:52.470
The photographs were not only important for
themselves at the time but became a reference

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:54.580
for the future in a way

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.440
As we face an uncertain future…

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:01.820
Arthur’s images will continue to help remind
us how easily we could revert back to a toxic

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.330
world.

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:08.830
It may come as a surprise that President Richard
Nixon… a Republican… helped created the

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:10.259
Environmental Protection Agency.

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:12.240
But environmentalism wasn’t always a source
of GOP contention.
