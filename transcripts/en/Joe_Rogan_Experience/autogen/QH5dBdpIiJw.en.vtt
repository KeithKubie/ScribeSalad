and then we spent maybe 20 trainings or
 

00:38:09.569 --> 00:38:12.319
and then we spent maybe 20 trainings or
maybe twenty five trainings step even up

00:38:12.319 --> 00:38:12.329
maybe twenty five trainings step even up
 

00:38:12.329 --> 00:38:14.779
maybe twenty five trainings step even up
like back and forth I start to get more

00:38:14.779 --> 00:38:14.789
like back and forth I start to get more
 

00:38:14.789 --> 00:38:17.089

strategy to to catch me and I start to

00:38:19.970 --> 00:38:19.980
strategy to to catch me and I start to
 

00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:21.890
strategy to to catch me and I start to
become a more comfortable in the

00:38:21.890 --> 00:38:21.900
become a more comfortable in the
 

00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:24.650
become a more comfortable in the
surviving and then in one point I start

00:38:24.650 --> 00:38:24.660
surviving and then in one point I start
