00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Welcome to office hours for week 4.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I'm here with Andy. &gt;&gt;Hi.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
He's the assistant instructor for Sebastian's class, CS 373.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Today I'm going to take the role that Peter usually takes.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Dave is out of town.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Peter will be Dave, and I'm going to ask some questions. So let's get started.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I'll try to do my best Dave impression. &gt;&gt;I'm sure you can manage.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Before we get into content, let's talk a little bit about grading. &gt;&gt;Yes.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Over the last couple days we noticed some bugs 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
in actually the version of Python that we're using that would misgrade assignments

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
that ended in a comment, which is very unfortunate

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
because comments shouldn't affect how a program runs.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
So we fixed that,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and, going forward, your assignments you submit won't be affected by that bug.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And we've also been working to address submitted code 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
that was copied from an external editor into our IDE

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
that had syntax errors going into it.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
And we're going to regrade everything once we get the infrastructure to do so.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So we're going to go back, all of the faulty programming assignments will be regraded,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and your grade will be changed accordingly.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Just one point, though.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Make sure that when the assignment calls for, let's say, a function titled Search

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
that you title your function Search.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Otherwise when we try to call that function there's going to be an error. 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Okay? &gt;&gt;Yeah.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
All right. Let's move on to content.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
The first question is one that I had, actually. &gt;&gt;Really? &gt;&gt;Yes.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I was going through 101, and I was curious about latency, networks,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
bandwidth, and especially this thing called a packet. &gt;&gt;Hmm.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
So what is a packet?

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Okay, a packet.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
A packet is kind of how we transmit data on the Internet,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
and this was a design decision to address a pretty basic problem.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
So let's imagine we're sitting in the Udacity office

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000
and Andy is sitting across from me and he's streaming his music through his headphones

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
and I'm trying to download a file.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Over the air you can only send 1 thing at a time.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
And so if you're streaming music constantly and I just want to download a file,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
I can't do that at the same time.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
So the solution is to not download your file all at once in 1 single stream

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
but to break it up in chunks.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
And those chunks are called packets. &gt;&gt;Yes. &gt;&gt;Okay.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
And so you download a chunk and then in between those chunks

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
I can still download my file, make requests, goof off on the Internet and whatnot

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
and occasionally answer questions on the forum. &gt;&gt;Get some work done, maybe?

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Sometimes. &gt;&gt;Okay, thank you.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And on the head of each of those packets is a header, I think you were telling me.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Yeah. That's how the packets know where to go.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
They have an address and it's an IP address--you've probably heard that before.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
All that stands for is Internet Protocol address. It's just an address.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
It's like an address when you mail a letter.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
It says where it's going and if something goes wrong who to send it back to.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
And the routers know what to do with those addresses to get it.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
They know where. It's the same way that a mailman knows where they go, the address.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
They just know where things are. &gt;&gt;Routers are little mailmen.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Little mailmen. &gt;&gt;Okay, great.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
First content question from a user is from Splashes,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
and he wants to know how important as a computer scientist

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
is it to learn multiple languages.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
It's not as important as introductory students may think.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
It becomes pretty--

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
You really should just choose the right language for whatever you're trying to do.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Different languages have advantages and disadvantages.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
If you want your code to run everywhere, Python runs pretty much everywhere.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
If you only are developing for an iPhone,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
then you're probably just going to need to use the language the iPhone uses,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Objective-C or some derivation of that.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
But yeah, it's a tool. &gt;&gt;Okay.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
And so I guess one of the fears is that will we through learning Python

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
have the tools to learn about these new tools?

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Will we be able to learn new programming languages? &gt;&gt;Yeah.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
A lot of it transfers, because programmers need to learn new languages,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
so a lot of the stuff between the languages is very similar.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
And that's by design.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
And pretty much all the skills you learn in this class

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
will apply to almost any programming language. &gt;&gt;Okay.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Malquan had a question about using Python code outside of the interpreter.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
All of our programs have been run by clicking a Run button,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
but normally when I run a program that's not how I do it. What can you say?

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Yeah. You go down to the task bar and you click the little picture. &gt;&gt;Exactly.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000
All you do is to get that picture you run it through another program

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
that kind of packages it together and you give it the picture

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
and then it'll create an installer which you can then distribute to your users

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
that will install it on their machines.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
But once you click that button, it's just going to your program.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Okay. So clicking the button is like calling a function that runs my program? &gt;&gt;Mm-hmm.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Okay, great. Thank you.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Last question for the day, and this is probably a challenging one for you,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
but I think you're up to the task.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.000
I want to know, and I think some of our students want to know, what is a database?

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
We've been talking a lot about data structures.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
So 2 minutes or less. What's a database? &gt;&gt;2 minutes or less.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
That's your target. &gt;&gt;Okay.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
This is a challenge.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
The way we've been storing our index is kind of just a big Python list,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
but that can get unwieldy after a while.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Every time we want to update the way we're storing the list

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
we've got to kind of go through and write a program that changes the structure of our list

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000
and then change all our functions to address this new list format.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
And eventually, people got sick of doing that,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000
so you have dedicated programs that are built for storing and querying data,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
and that's called a database. &gt;&gt;Okay, thank you.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
All right. Well, that's all the questions for this time.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
And we--well, I suppose Peter and Dave--will see you next week. &gt;&gt;Bye. &gt;&gt;Bye.
