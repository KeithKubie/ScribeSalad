00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:04.880
Warmest year ever, most snow ever, and a megadrought
for the United States...

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.920
But you know what guys?

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.360
Global warming isn't real.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.950
HAHAHAHHAHAHA

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.439
people who are ready to listen and also climate
trolls

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.380
Let me tell you a story about how global warming,
or climate change, if you prefer, is happening.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:25.380
It's science.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.380
It's proven.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:27.380
Deal with it.

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.999
But, just because we know it's happening doesn't
mean we know the long term effects.

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:35.020
In light of conservative officials from the
Great State of Florida unofficially discouraging

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.730
government and educational institutions from
using the words "climate change", "global

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.820
warming" or "sea-level rise," we thought we'd
see how that was working out for everyone.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.940
Luckily for us, and Florida, the Pacific Northwest
National Laboratory analyzed data running

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.570
back 2000 years using ice core information,
and weather data from the 19th and 20th centuries.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.380
They projected temperature changes in 40 year
chunks.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.790
As there was relatively little greenhouse
gas release for most of our history, the temperature

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.650
fluctuated, but essentially remained the same.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:12.400
But looking from 1971 to 2020, their model
shows warming an increasing speed.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.610
It's gonna get warmer, faster; changing the
Earth in unpredictable ways we've never seen

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.610
before.

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.780
2014 was the hottest year on record, beating
2010, which trounced 2005 which had previously

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.720
won over 1998… then 2013, 2003, 2002, 2006,
2009, 2007 and 2004…

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:34.790
And that's the top ten hottest years since
we started checking in 1880.

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:42.630
In fact, 2014 was the 38th year in a row with
"anomalously high" global temperatures.

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.500
According to the U.S. National Climatic Data
Center, part of NOAA, if you're under 30,

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:53.940
you've NEVER LIVED through a year where the
average surface temperature was below average.

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.720
People who are 60 have had a completely different
EARTH than we have, in terms of the climate.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.490
The oceans were at different temperature,
the weather was less severe and the extremes

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.700
were more tempered by those changes.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.200
Not to be outdone, 2015 has already been a
big year for climate change.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.739
A study in Science Advances from NASA and
Cornell outlined a timeline for the coming,

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:15.739
"megadrought."

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:19.849
Using models built from observing climate
trends, their study says we have an 80 percent

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:24.220
chance of experiencing a drought worse than
anything we've seen in North America since

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.409
the 12th and 13th centuries.

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:31.159
Humans can act to decrease the CHANCES of
the megadrought, but man-made global effects

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:34.370
are exacerbating the drought already gripping
the American West.

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.540
Not to mention the CRAZY snows.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.859
The Northeast has had record snowfalls this
year, and as the globe warms, snowfall increases.

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:46.840
We can all remember a bad storm, or a hotter
summer, but luckily, data doesn't rely on

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.249
the terrible human memory.

00:02:48.249 --> 00:02:53.249
The U.S. Global Change Research Program does
a National Climate Assessment every year,

00:02:53.249 --> 00:02:59.750
and they found a 71 percent increase in "very
heavy" Northeastern Storms from 1958 to 2012.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.109
It's not just storms though, a study in Geophysical
Research Letters, found volcanos will increase

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:10.019
as Icelandic ice melts, increasing surface
heat, and further spewing greenhouse gases

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:11.519
into the atmosphere.

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:12.590
CLIMATE CHANGE, YA’LL!

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:18.549
From November 2012 to December 2013, over
9000 authors published over 2200 papers and

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:22.829
only one of them disputed man-made global
warming.

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:23.829
One.

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:26.499
And that author blamed the sun, which is hot,
that’s true.

00:03:26.499 --> 00:03:31.400
But while the sun's been constantly tossing
energy at us, the levels of CO2 in the atmosphere

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.260
in 2013 were 142 percent higher than a hundred
years before.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.949
So we need to face it; the climate HAS changed!

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:43.279
Scientists believe it's possible to curtail
the effects of man-made global warming, but

00:03:43.279 --> 00:03:44.279
you already knew that.

00:03:44.279 --> 00:03:52.269
Now we have to decide what do about it.

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:56.231
Pollution and climate changes were something
ancient people never had to deal with, but

00:03:56.231 --> 00:03:57.969
DRUGS -- that's a different story.

00:03:57.969 --> 00:04:02.590
Our new sister show Seeker looks into the
hallucinogenic habits of ancient humans, and

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:22.650
those of tribes that survive to tell us about
those habit still today.
