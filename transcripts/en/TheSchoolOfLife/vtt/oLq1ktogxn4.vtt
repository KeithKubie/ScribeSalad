00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:05.870
Infidelity is commonly interpreted as close
to the greatest tragedy that could befall

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:12.159
any relationship – and as the natural, inevitable
prelude to the break-up of a union. It is

00:00:12.159 --> 00:00:17.170
viewed in such dark terms because, under the
philosophy of Romanticism which has dominated

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:22.170
our understanding of love since the middle
of the eighteenth century, sex is understood

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.820
to be, not principally a physical act, but
the summation and central symbol of love.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.920
Before Romanticism, people had sex and fell
in love but they did not always see these

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:40.079
two acts as inextricably linked: one might
love someone and not sleep with them. Or sleep

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:46.739
with them and not love them. It was this dislocation
that Romanticism refused to countenance. Sex

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.719
was simply the crowning moment of love, the
superlative way of expressing one’s devotion

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.179
to someone, the ultimate proof of one’s
sincerity. What this philosophy unwittingly

00:00:57.179 --> 00:01:03.820
accomplished was to turn infidelity from a
problem into a catastrophe. Never again could

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:09.290
sex be viewed as in any way divorced from
intense emotion and a profound desire for

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.120
commitment. It was no longer possible to say
that sex meant ‘nothing’, in the sense

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:20.870
of being a joyful, kind but emotionally-empty
act devoid of any desire to care for or live

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:25.880
with a new person in the long-term and in
no way indicative of any drop in affection

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.000
for the established partner. There are, of
course, many cases where infidelity means

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.280
exactly what Romanticism takes it to mean:
contempt for one’s relationship. But in

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.650
a great many other cases, it may mean something
really rather different: a passing, surface

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:49.280
desire for erotic excitement that coexists
with an ongoing, sincere commitment to one’s

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:56.070
life-partner. Our culture makes this thought
close to impossible, and so getting ‘over’

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.090
an infidelity – by which is meant, learning
to see that the unfaithful act might not mean

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.990
what Romanticism tells us it means – has
become a challenge of heroic proportions and

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:13.600
most of the time, a brute impossibility. However
much an unfaithful partner may patiently explain

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:20.340
that it meant nothing, the idea seems entirely
implausible. How could sex, the summation

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:26.450
of love, ever mean anything less than pretty
much everything? There may be one potential

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:34.480
way out of the impasse: a frank examination
of the recesses of one’s own mind and perhaps,

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:41.780
an honest recall of certain moments of past
personal experience. What this brave investigation

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.520
is likely to throw up is evidence that one
is strangely capable of something – in the

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:53.360
circumstances – really rather surprising:
caring deeply for someone and yet entertaining,

00:02:53.360 --> 00:03:00.390
or masterminding, a sexual scenario involving
somebody else. However much the thought seems

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.590
unbelievable when we hear it from the mouth
of a straying partner, it does appear that

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:11.310
it is, in some ways, really rather possible
to think of screwing one person and loving

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:17.260
another. The best way to recover after an
infidelity may therefore be to ignore what

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.870
Romanticism tells us that infidelity has to
mean, and to consult instead a more reliable

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:29.069
source of information: what we ourselves took
infidelity to mean the last time the idea

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:35.020
crossed through our minds or our lives. It
is on this basis that we may – with considerable

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:40.270
pain of course – come one day to be able
to forgive and even in a way understand and

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:46.420
accept the apologies of a repentant partner.
It is on the basis of subjective experience

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:53.590
of unfaithful thoughts that we may redemptively
enrich, complicate and soften what happens

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.160
when we end up as their victims.

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.680
At The School Of Life we believe in developing emotional intelligence.

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:07.120
To that end we have also created a whole range of products to support that growth.
