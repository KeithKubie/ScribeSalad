00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.339
Rober De Niro and Rober De Faro and shoelace
love.

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:12.190
It's episode 46 of IMG!
Here's a great infographic about New Year's

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.910
resolutions.
For instance, 88% of them fail.

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:22.099
But you see these images of cats?
They are cat scans.

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:26.539
For something sweet, check out SCANDYBARS,
a Tumblr with high-resolution cross sectional

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:31.659
scans of candy.
Less appetising is this rare and very real

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:37.649
albino shark cyclops.
Kyle Bean took these soft gorilla photographs.

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:45.109
A jello hand grenade, a feather knife, brass
knuckles toast and a delicious melting time

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:48.059
bomb.
Almost as delicious as dressing your baby

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.079
as a Thanksgiving turkey, a homeless person
or a creeper.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:57.720
The splash of water caused by a droplet impacting
a pool is called a Worthington jet.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.800
Now the jet can break into droplets, and this
droplet refracting a world map behind it creates

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.890
a globe that blows my mind.
Imgur released the 11 most loaded images on

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.470
their site in 2011.
The most viewed GIF, of course, was the cafeteria ninja.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.280
Behance counted down their site's top 10 most

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:24.520
appreciated projects.
For instance, honest logos for YouTube, Facebook

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.200
and more.
I also love these brand-versations.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:33.640
Logos made out of logos from competing products.
Okay, now these works use negative space to

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:38.280
make two pictures simultaneously.
This one reminds me of a psychology study

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.020
from the late 1800s, showing how culture influences
perception.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.880
Western viewers are familiar with box-like
architecture and corners, and so they report

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.159
that this image is a family sitting indoors
with a window looking outside.

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:57.530
But participants from East Africa interpreted
the family to be sitting outside under a tree,

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.729
while this woman balances a box on her head.
Okay, here's a field of squares.

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:08.509
Now, follow the moving dot and the middle
squares will appear to rise and fall.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.060
And you know what?
How about some finger drawings?

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.500
Here's a human Santapede and here's something
neat.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.960
Jodi Benson.
She did the voice for Ariel in The Little

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.840
Mermaid and she's the same person who does
the voice for Barbie in Toy Story.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.820
Now this image of the world shows global cloud
cover averaged over the month of October 2009.

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.640
But clouds are more fun when they're in weird
shapes or positions.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.920
Speaking of clouds, let's talk about William
Rankin, a marine corp pilot who ejected from

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.060
his failing aircraft and sky dove right through
the middle of a thunderstorm.

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:04.989
Fluctuating pressure in the storm set off
his automatic parachute early and he was tossed

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:10.260
around inside the thunderclouds, more than
10,000 feet above the ground, for more than

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:17.840
40 minutes before finally landing in a tree.
But Reddit alerted me to scarier weather.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:24.320
The weather over the USA on December 27, a
T-Rex about to eat Iowa.

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:30.420
Now finally, these books have been carved
into landscapes by Guy Laramee.

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:35.680
On Facebook.com/VsauceGaming you can submit
your own images, DONGs, questions and generally

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.220
Vsauce at all together.
For instance, Jonathan submitted these carved

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:44.220
books that together make a tree, which is
what they started out as anyways.

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.140
And as always,

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.660
thanks for watching.
