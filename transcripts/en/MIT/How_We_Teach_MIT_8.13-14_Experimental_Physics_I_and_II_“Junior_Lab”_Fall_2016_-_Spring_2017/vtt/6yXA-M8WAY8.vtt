JANET CONRAD: So I really
love teaching Junior Lab.

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:11.080
And I really like it
the way that it is.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.930
I like its structure
and so forth.

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.920
But you cannot sit in that lab
and not come up with new ideas

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.240
for experiments.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.670
And I have one that I
would really love to do.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:23.550
I am on a neutrino experiment.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.050
I was the head of the neutrino
experiment for a while, which

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:27.480
was called MiniBooNE.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.755
MiniBooNE stands for
Booster Neutrino Experiment.

00:00:30.755 --> 00:00:33.280
So MiniBooNE was a small
Booster Neutrino Experiment.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.500
And in neutrino physics,
small is 800 tons.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.400
It's [CHUCKLES] 40 feet high.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.040
It's a big detector.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.740
And inside of it, it had all
of these photo detectors that

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.760
lined the inside and when a
neutrino interaction occurred,

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.380
you got a little
bit of light that

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.210
came out from the
charged particle

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:53.849
that the neutrino produced.

00:00:53.849 --> 00:00:56.140
It turns out that charged
particle was traveling faster

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.180
than the speed of
light in a medium,

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:59.980
in the oil that was
in the detector.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.380
Nothing goes faster than the
speed of light in a vacuum,

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.950
but things can go faster than
the speed of light in material.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.310
When that happens,
you get the equivalent

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.440
of a sonic boom, a
kind of photonic boom.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.020
Bam, out come a whole
bunch of photons.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.970
And people love this idea
that things can go faster

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.120
than the speed of light.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.700
And it's really so
neat to see that light.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.520
It's called shrink of light.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.390
And so, what I
would like to do, is

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.600
I would like to build a small
version of my experiment

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.700
MiniBooNE, which we
would call TinyBooNE.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.360
[CHUCKLES] And TinyBooNE would
be about one meter across.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.670
And it would have photo
detectors, tiny little photo

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:40.210
detectors.

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.160
They're called silicon
photo-multipliers.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.930
All along one side.

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.570
And we would put a beta
source in the middle of it.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.130
And out would come in electron.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.220
That electron, if you choose
the right beta source,

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.684
is actually high enough
energy that it will actually

00:01:54.684 --> 00:01:56.350
produce a little bit
of Cherenkov light.

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.730
And you can actually
see the Cherenkov light.

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.810
And so as with any of the
Junior Lab experiments,

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.874
we have to have two
things you can measure.

00:02:03.874 --> 00:02:05.290
All the Junior Lab
experiments are

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.420
designed so there's two
things you can measure.

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.699
One which one partner
focuses on and one which

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:11.350
the other partner focuses on.

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.380
And so the things that you
would measure in TinyBooNE,

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.890
one of them would be how
the Cherenkov light turns on

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.525
with energy, given the source,
which would be a strontium

00:02:22.525 --> 00:02:24.370
to yttrium source.

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.000
And then the other would
be to use that beta decay

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.587
spectrum to set a mass limit.

00:02:30.587 --> 00:02:32.170
Not a very good mass
limit, but a mass

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.882
limit on the mass
of the neutrino.

00:02:34.882 --> 00:02:36.340
And I think it
would be really fun.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.120
I would just love to build this.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.730
It's just not possible
to sit in there

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.831
and not dream up what
experiment you would like to do.
