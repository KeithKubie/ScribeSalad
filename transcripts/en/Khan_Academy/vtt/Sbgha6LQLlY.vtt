00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.130
"Most major air pollutants cannot be seen,

00:00:03.131 --> 00:00:05.736
although large amounts of them concentrated

00:00:05.736 --> 00:00:10.685
in cities are visible as smog". So this

00:00:10.685 --> 00:00:13.428
actually feels decent. It's not as cleanly

00:00:13.428 --> 00:00:16.486
written as I might like, but it doesn't

00:00:16.486 --> 00:00:18.246
seem like there's any outright errors,

00:00:18.246 --> 00:00:20.415
especially where they're underlined. So "of

00:00:20.415 --> 00:00:25.205
them", well the "them" is referring to the

00:00:25.205 --> 00:00:27.606
"major air pollutants". So this completely

00:00:27.606 --> 00:00:29.797
cool. "Large amounts of them concentrated

00:00:29.797 --> 00:00:32.986
in cities", well that's just saying that

00:00:32.986 --> 00:00:35.511
these are the "large amounts" amounts of

00:00:35.511 --> 00:00:36.440
the air pollutants "concentrated in

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.967
cities". This is making grammatical sense,

00:00:38.967 --> 00:00:41.563
"are visible", so we're talking about

00:00:41.563 --> 00:00:44.530
something that's plural so it completely

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.597
makes sense to use the plural form of the

00:00:46.597 --> 00:00:50.342
verb, so "are visible as smog". So this

00:00:50.342 --> 00:00:52.734
makes complete grammatical sense. So I

00:00:52.734 --> 00:00:56.734
would say that this has no error.
