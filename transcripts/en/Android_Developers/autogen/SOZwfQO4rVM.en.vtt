design is all around how your
 

00:26:34.989 --> 00:26:37.139
design is all around how your
application represents its views within

Android's accessibility services will

00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:41.590
Android's accessibility services will
 

00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:44.340
Android's accessibility services will
use view attributes to determine how to

00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:44.350
use view attributes to determine how to
 

00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:46.529
use view attributes to determine how to
represent and navigate content within

your app here we have an example of a

00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:49.720
your app here we have an example of a
 

00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:52.349
your app here we have an example of a
very simple demo application with two

00:26:52.349 --> 00:26:52.359
very simple demo application with two
 

00:26:52.359 --> 00:26:54.749
very simple demo application with two
buttons we're going to use switch access

00:26:54.749 --> 00:26:54.759
buttons we're going to use switch access
 

00:26:54.759 --> 00:26:57.930
buttons we're going to use switch access
as an example to see how the application

00:26:57.930 --> 00:26:57.940
as an example to see how the application
 

00:26:57.940 --> 00:26:59.249
as an example to see how the application
is interacted with with the

00:26:59.249 --> 00:26:59.259
is interacted with with the
 

00:26:59.259 --> 00:27:02.220
is interacted with with the
accessibility service so in this case

00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:02.230
accessibility service so in this case
 

00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:04.200
accessibility service so in this case
the layout is very simple for button 1

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:04.210
the layout is very simple for button 1
 

00:27:04.210 --> 00:27:06.690
the layout is very simple for button 1
it's simply a standard Android button

00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:06.700
it's simply a standard Android button
 

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:09.029
it's simply a standard Android button
within a linear layout it is clickable

00:27:09.029 --> 00:27:09.039
within a linear layout it is clickable
 

00:27:09.039 --> 00:27:12.029
within a linear layout it is clickable
by default so let's see how switch

00:27:12.029 --> 00:27:12.039
by default so let's see how switch
 

00:27:12.039 --> 00:27:13.979
by default so let's see how switch
access interacts with this widget when

00:27:13.979 --> 00:27:13.989
access interacts with this widget when
 

00:27:13.989 --> 00:27:18.259
access interacts with this widget when
we try to click it let's roll the clip

00:27:18.259 --> 00:27:18.269
 
 

00:27:18.269 --> 00:27:21.210
 
so switch access focus is going to move

00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:21.220
so switch access focus is going to move
 

00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:23.430
so switch access focus is going to move
to the first button we'll hit select and

00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:23.440
to the first button we'll hit select and
 

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:25.229
to the first button we'll hit select and
we see a little snack bar at the bottom

00:27:25.229 --> 00:27:25.239
we see a little snack bar at the bottom
 

00:27:25.239 --> 00:27:26.489
we see a little snack bar at the bottom
indicating that the button has been

00:27:26.489 --> 00:27:26.499
indicating that the button has been
 

00:27:26.499 --> 00:27:28.799
indicating that the button has been
clicked this is the exact behavior we're

00:27:28.799 --> 00:27:28.809
clicked this is the exact behavior we're
 

00:27:28.809 --> 00:27:30.779
clicked this is the exact behavior we're
looking for it's simple and works as

00:27:30.779 --> 00:27:30.789
looking for it's simple and works as
 

00:27:30.789 --> 00:27:32.509
looking for it's simple and works as
expected

00:27:32.509 --> 00:27:32.519
expected
 

00:27:32.519 --> 00:27:34.919
expected
now we'll complicate the example a

00:27:34.919 --> 00:27:34.929
now we'll complicate the example a
 

00:27:34.929 --> 00:27:37.200
now we'll complicate the example a
little bit for button 2 in this case

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:37.210
little bit for button 2 in this case
 

00:27:37.210 --> 00:27:39.090
little bit for button 2 in this case
we'll add an additional linear layout

00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:39.100
we'll add an additional linear layout
 

00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:41.190
we'll add an additional linear layout
and we'll mark it as Android clickable

00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:41.200
and we'll mark it as Android clickable
 

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:44.070
and we'll mark it as Android clickable
equals true now this represents that we

00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:44.080
equals true now this represents that we
 

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:46.349
equals true now this represents that we
have 2 clickable things in our hierarchy

00:27:46.349 --> 00:27:46.359
have 2 clickable things in our hierarchy
 

00:27:46.359 --> 00:27:48.720
have 2 clickable things in our hierarchy
the button and its parent linear layout

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:48.730
the button and its parent linear layout
 

00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:50.970
the button and its parent linear layout
this can actually create some confusion

00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:50.980
this can actually create some confusion
 

00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:53.340
this can actually create some confusion
and difficulty when using this

00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:53.350
and difficulty when using this
 

00:27:53.350 --> 00:27:55.889
and difficulty when using this
application with switch access let's try

00:27:55.889 --> 00:27:55.899
application with switch access let's try
 

00:27:55.899 --> 00:28:00.210
application with switch access let's try
it out in all the clip so we're going to

00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:00.220
it out in all the clip so we're going to
 

00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:02.759
it out in all the clip so we're going to
move focus to button 2 we're going to

00:28:02.759 --> 00:28:02.769
move focus to button 2 we're going to
 

00:28:02.769 --> 00:28:03.419
move focus to button 2 we're going to
hit select

00:28:03.419 --> 00:28:03.429
hit select
 

00:28:03.429 --> 00:28:05.159
hit select
we're actually presented with a menu

00:28:05.159 --> 00:28:05.169
we're actually presented with a menu
 

00:28:05.169 --> 00:28:07.379
we're actually presented with a menu
where the user has to choose do they

00:28:07.379 --> 00:28:07.389
where the user has to choose do they
 

00:28:07.389 --> 00:28:08.759
where the user has to choose do they
want to select the higher level

00:28:08.759 --> 00:28:08.769
want to select the higher level
 

00:28:08.769 --> 00:28:10.289
want to select the higher level
clickable item or the lower level

00:28:10.289 --> 00:28:10.299
clickable item or the lower level
 

00:28:10.299 --> 00:28:12.090
clickable item or the lower level
clickable item and this is confusing

00:28:12.090 --> 00:28:12.100
clickable item and this is confusing
 

00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:13.950
clickable item and this is confusing
because the user doesn't need to know

00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:13.960
because the user doesn't need to know
 

00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:15.690
because the user doesn't need to know
the details about our applications view

00:28:15.690 --> 00:28:15.700
the details about our applications view
 

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:17.879
the details about our applications view
hierarchy so we forced the user to

00:28:17.879 --> 00:28:17.889
hierarchy so we forced the user to
 

00:28:17.889 --> 00:28:20.190
hierarchy so we forced the user to
memorize that they need to click 1 or 2

00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:20.200
memorize that they need to click 1 or 2
 

00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:20.860
memorize that they need to click 1 or 2

to kill our application this is rather

00:28:22.690 --> 00:28:22.700
to kill our application this is rather
 

00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:24.970
to kill our application this is rather
confusing but we can luckily fix this

00:28:24.970 --> 00:28:24.980
confusing but we can luckily fix this
 

00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:28.600
confusing but we can luckily fix this
pretty easily so the right fix here is

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:28.610
pretty easily so the right fix here is
 

00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:30.460
pretty easily so the right fix here is
since this linear layout is not actually

since this linear layout is not actually
 

00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:32.170
since this linear layout is not actually
clickable will remove the clickable

00:28:32.170 --> 00:28:32.180
clickable will remove the clickable
 

00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:35.230
clickable will remove the clickable
attribute alternatively since this

to make things a little more accessible
 

00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:23.240
to make things a little more accessible
to people who need it so this framework

00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:23.250
to people who need it so this framework
 

00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:25.340
