00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
For this quiz, the goal is to see that you understand lists

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
and can define a procedure that uses them.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
You'll be given a variable, days<u>in</u>month,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
which is initialized to a list containing 12 entries

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
where each entry is the number of days in the corresponding month,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
so January has 31 days, so that's why we have 31 here.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
February--at least in a non-leap year--has 28 days.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
March has 31, and so on up to December that has 31 days.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Your goal is to define a procedure called how<u>many</u>days--

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
with underscores between the words--

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
that takes as input a number representing a month

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and outputs the number of days in that month,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and we should use the conventional way of numbering the months,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
so here's a few examples.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
If we call how<u>many</u>days, passing in 1,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
meaning the month January, the output should be 31

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
since there are 31 days in January,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and that corresponds to the entry in the zeroth position of days<u>in</u>month.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
If we call how<u>many</u>days, passing in 9, that's September.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
We should get 30.
