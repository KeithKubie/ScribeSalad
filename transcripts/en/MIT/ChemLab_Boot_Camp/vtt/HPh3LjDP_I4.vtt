[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.970
ANNOUNCER: It's day
two of 5.301.

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.340
The students are given a tenth
of a gram of Ethyl

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.980
3-hydroxybenzoate contaminated
with a small amount of

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.440
triethylamine.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.000
The goal is to separate the
contaminant from the target

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.370
chemical using a technique
called extraction.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.500
The students first dissolve
the mixture in ether, then

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.190
they add an acid solution.

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.700
Acid and ether don't mix,
so two layers form.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.870
As the students shake the
mixture, the acid reacts with

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.330
the contaminant to
form a salt.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.800
This salt is much less soluble
in ether than it is an acid,

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.430
so it moves from the
ether to the acid.

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.930
The two liquids separate
back into two layers.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.980
Overall, the target molecule
stays in the ether and the

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.400
contaminant moves to
the acid layer.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.290
ANTHONY: This has my product.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.040
This has my impurity.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.300
ANNOUNCER: Now it's time to head
over to the rotovap to

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.550
evaporate the ether.

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.180
Anthony starts rotovapping,
and it's all

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.940
going well, for now.

00:01:53.332 --> 00:01:54.800
But after a while--

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.500
ANTHONY: I'm not getting
any of my dried

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.750
sample on the edges.

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.790
I think as long as there is
still ether in there, then I

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.510
won't get anything to show
up, is what I'm hoping.

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.669
IKE: His was a lot and
it's not succeeding.

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:13.412
Mine is little, so what
chance do I have?

00:02:13.412 --> 00:02:15.595
ANTHONY: I thought I did
something wrong and, of

00:02:15.595 --> 00:02:17.580
course, no one wants to do
anything wrong, especially on

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.802
the second day.

00:02:18.802 --> 00:02:20.910
I should have gotten
some product.

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.040
I went to Tengfei, and I was
like, look lady, I don't know

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.945
you very well but this doesn't
seem like it's working.

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.150
She drained the solvent
and then turned

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.650
on the vacuum again.

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:36.900
I still don't see anything.

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.270
Everyone else was getting their
samples and they were

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.510
going to dry and then mass.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.170
And I was like, I don't
have anything.

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.550
ANNOUNCER: Anthony's troubles
finally get Phil's attention.

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.120
PHIL: Try putting it on one
of the other rotovaps.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.990
ANNOUNCER: Phil thinks the
rotovap Anthony is

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.460
using must be broken.

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.360
ANTHONY: And I start getting
crystals, I guess, on the side

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.780
of my round bottom.

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:10.220
I clutched my heart.

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.420
And I was like, finally.

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.380
ANNOUNCER: But the sample
doesn't quite look right, and

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.517
Tengfei has something
to say about that.

00:03:17.517 --> 00:03:20.930
TENGFEI: Who's to know what
you are supposed to get?

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.080
ANTHONY: So she's
like, calm down.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.260
Like, just hold on.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.590
You don't even know what
you're supposed to get

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.600
yet, so hold on.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.660
ANNOUNCER: Anthony runs
an NMR to figure out

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.680
exactly what he has.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.620
ANTHONY: Check this out.

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.000
This doesn't look like
it's horribly wrong.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.210
So, hopefully this will be it.

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:42.310
I think this is a pretty
good NMR scan.

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.610
ANNOUNCER: Even though his
sample looks different, the

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.280
NMR spectrum matches that
of the pure compound.

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.210
ANTHONY: 70% yield.

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:55.880
So not wonderful,
but not too bad.

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.440
When I got a sample and I got a
pretty big yield and it was

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.680
pretty pure, I was happy.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.760
ANNOUNCER: And that's it.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.255
The first day is done.

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:09.900
EMILY: Overall, I think
the lab was OK.

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.940
It was a little stressful at
times, but we all made it

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.410
though it alive and I think it
will just get easier with each

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:20.815
day as we become more
comfortable

00:04:20.815 --> 00:04:22.350
with what we're doing.

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:23.710
ETHAN: I'm definitely not
as nervous anymore

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:24.990
to go to the lab.

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.380
I'm actually more excited
for it, I guess.

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:28.730
ANTHONY: I'm looking forward
to tomorrow.

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:30.485
It's going to be a lot harder,
but I think it's going to be a

00:04:30.485 --> 00:04:31.735
lot of fun.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.410
PHIL: I'm not a gambling man.

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.890
I do slot machines.

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:58.859
