In the responsive world, choosing
images to suit the viewing context,

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:09.340
art direction can be accomplished
pretty easily with the picture element

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.770
to enable display of
a crop of an image or

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:15.690
even a different image depending
on image display size.

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.870
Now in this example, we're using
media queries to specify the source.

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:23.240
Full sized kitten for a large view port,
and medium kitten for

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.780
a medium view port, and
a small kitten for a small view port.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:28.820
Cute.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.240
This is doing art direction.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.710
Choosing a different image
with just a few lines of HTML.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.050
Okay, hold onto your hat,
here's the full monty.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.920
We've combined media queries and source
set to specify images for smaller and

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.370
larger view ports with different
images for different pixel densities.

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.450
Here we get the same effect in Safari,
which doesn't yet

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:51.840
support the picture element.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.070
Well how did we do that?

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.510
Well, it's the same markup but

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.690
this time we've made use of
the picture fill polyfill.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.870
That's a small JavaScript file that
enables you to use source set and

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.019
the other new responsive
image elements and

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.370
attributes on browsers that don't yet
support them.

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.150

fill from the link below the video.
