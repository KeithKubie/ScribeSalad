ALEX ANTHONY: I don't think
ever felt like a girl.

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:05.550
I grew up with
two older sisters,

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.080
and I kind of watched the
things that they like.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.586
I was just never
into those things.

00:00:09.586 --> 00:00:11.460
It was always like I
wanted to play football,

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.187
and I wanted to wear blue
and just wear boy clothes,

00:00:15.187 --> 00:00:17.270
and that's always what I
felt more comfortable in.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.940
JULIE: Alex has struggled
with his identity

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.780
definitely through
middle school.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.870
That's when it became
pretty noticable-- just

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:31.730
trying to fit in.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.730
ALEX ANTHONY: This is
when I moved to San Diego.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.313
A boy asked me to
go to prom, and so I

00:00:35.313 --> 00:00:39.540
had to wear a dress, which
I was not comfortable in,

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.740
and you can kind of see it.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.070
I think this time in
my life was probably

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.940
like one of the darker times.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.140
JULIE: He would wear a lot
of dark colored clothes.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.200
He was definitely made
to feel that it wasn't

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.460
OK to express
himself, and I think

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.210
that brought on a lot
of sadness with him.

00:01:03.448 --> 00:01:05.239
ALEX ANTHONY: Growing
up, my dad would say,

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.010
I know that you
want to be a boy,

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:08.990
but you're never
going to be a boy.

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.325
You were put on this earth to
conceive and be with a man.

00:01:14.325 --> 00:01:16.003
-Your coffee, sir.

00:01:16.003 --> 00:01:17.000
-Thanks, beautiful.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:17.691
-You're welcome.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.670
ALEX ANTHONY: I think
I was about 16 or 17

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.200
when I kind of figured out
what the trans community was,

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.340
and so then I YouTubed it.

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.920
Boom, all these videos pop
up, and I'm watching them,

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:30.800
and I'm like, whoa.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.250
Like, I'm so excited inside
because I'm like, wow,

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.750
there's answers.

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:35.980
Other people feel like me.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:37.175
I'm not as alone as I feel.

00:01:37.175 --> 00:01:38.100
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.150
-So this is my fresh
idea for YouTube.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:47.930
My name's Alexis, and I have
been somewhat struggling

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.140
with my gender identity,
I guess you could say.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.475
[END PLAYBACK]

00:01:52.475 --> 00:01:56.570
ALEX ANTHONY: It was relief
followed by that feeling

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.100
of just like depression.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.070
It just crashed
down on my world.

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.350
How am I ever going to
evolve into this person who

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.950
I know belongs in the mirror
when I look into it, you know?

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.250
And it just kind of-- that was
when it came to like depression

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.266
and just wanting to die.

00:02:14.266 --> 00:02:15.570
That was the worst.

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.090
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.970
-I've been watching
a of YouTube videos,

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.260
and every time I watch them I
get-- I can relate in some way

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.720
that I guess like I wish
that you could be me.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:27.420
[END PLAYBACK]

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.169
ALEX ANTHONY: At the
time I had long hair,

00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:31.760
so I'd pull it back behind my
hat and wear like two sports

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.730
bra instead of one, so
my chest would kind of

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.920
go lower and just
do things that made

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.550
me feel a little bit better.

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.230
The solutions would
all just wear off.

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.480
Every time it would
just get worse.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:48.150
So then I got faced with
what are you going to do?

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.820
Cutting that first braid off,
and it felt so liberating.

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.570
I felt like so in
control of my life,

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:53.986
and I literally
felt like somebody

00:02:53.986 --> 00:02:55.125
just cut the chains off me.

00:02:55.125 --> 00:02:58.270
Like I just felt free.

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.650
JULIE: That was
like a huge deal.

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.087
Once he chopped it all off,
it was just like a new person.

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.210
ALEX ANTHONY: This
is when I really felt

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:11.920
like Alex was becoming real.

00:03:17.054 --> 00:03:18.030
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.120
-Some of my biggest changes
I've noticed are my hunger.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.230
I crave like really weird
things, like steaks and burgers

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.030
all the time.

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.680
Hair on my stomach
is getting darker.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.927
My voice is changing
a little bit.

00:03:32.927 --> 00:03:34.010
We're just pretty excited.

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:36.310
How do you feel about it?

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.460
-It is different.

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:40.100
It's hard for me,
obviously, because I

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.210
identify as a lesbian.

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:44.820
I like girls, but
it just so happens

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.550
that the girl I fall in
love and that I still love

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:49.980
is actually a boy.

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.758
That doesn't mean that
I don't still love him.

00:03:52.758 --> 00:03:55.251
-I have some, let's
say, 10 o'clock shadow.

00:03:55.251 --> 00:03:57.500
I would consider it like two
o'clock shadow, actually.

00:04:03.622 --> 00:04:05.340
[END PLAYBACK]

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.340
ALEX ANTHONY: Now we are
flying out of San Diego

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.135
to San Francisco
for my top surgery.

00:04:10.135 --> 00:04:13.275
This is the first surgery
I've ever had in my life.

00:04:13.275 --> 00:04:15.150
DR. THOMAS SATTERWHITE:
The type of operation

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.829
that Alex will be getting is
referred to as "top" surgery,

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:21.269
removing breast tissue
from both sides,

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.900
and we're taking off the nipple
and the areola as one unit,

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.270
and then resizing it and
then repositioning it.

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.960
JULIE: I feel like
after the surgery,

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.920
I'm hoping that he'll just
felt comfortable in his body

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.426
for like who he
is on the inside.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.180
ALEX ANTHONY: I feel excited.

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.120
I feel like, I don't
know, I can't explain it.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.080
I feel like it's real.

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.094
It's all becoming really
real and emotional.

00:04:50.094 --> 00:04:51.510
Because this is
forever, you know?

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.010
I've been waiting a
long time for this.

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.470
I'm going to see the person
that I've been waiting

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.180
to see for my whole life.

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.260
I've imagined it
forever, and it's

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.350
going to happen in five minutes.

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:12.835
Hello.

00:05:12.835 --> 00:05:13.695
NURSE: Hi.

00:05:13.695 --> 00:05:14.320
How's it going?

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.815
ALEX ANTHONY: Good.

00:05:14.815 --> 00:05:15.310
How are you?

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:16.101
NURSE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:19.310
Freedom!

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.230
ALEX ANTHONY: Hey,
this is crazy.

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:28.129
NURSE: A weight off your chest?

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:28.920
ALEX ANTHONY: Yeah.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.110
NURSE: --literally.

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:31.110
ALEX ANTHONY: Literally.

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.990
Looks really nice.

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.490
I'm happy.

00:05:36.499 --> 00:05:38.665
ALEX'S MOM: Wow, do you
feel like freedom right now,

00:05:38.665 --> 00:05:39.682
or what?

00:05:39.682 --> 00:05:41.651
ALEX ANTHONY: Yeah.

00:05:41.651 --> 00:05:42.526
It feels really cool.

00:05:42.526 --> 00:05:44.734
I feel like I'm in a dream,
and I'm going to wake up.

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:50.435
Before I had the surgery
I was still a man.

00:05:50.435 --> 00:05:53.300
And now that I've had it,
I'm still the same person.

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.595
It's just I feel
more comfortable,

00:05:55.595 --> 00:05:56.970
and I think that
that's something

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:00.150
I really want to stress because
not everybody knows that.

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.400
There's a lot of things in
my life that I'm like, wow,

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.066
I wish I would've
done that differently.

00:06:04.066 --> 00:06:07.240
But I think this is probably
the first time in my life

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.070
that I've totally
done everything

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:10.630
just the way that I needed to.

00:06:14.006 --> 00:06:16.295
INTERVIEWER: Be sure to
watch this next episode.

00:06:16.295 --> 00:06:19.520
When you look in the mirror now,
who's the person that you see?

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.855
SUBJECT: So I see a lot
more confident person.

00:06:21.855 --> 00:06:24.290
I see someone who'd
made a lot of progress.

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:27.186
And most of all, I see
someone who's on a journey.

00:06:27.186 --> 00:06:28.560
