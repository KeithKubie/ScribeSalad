00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.730
&gt;&gt; For those who don't know me, I'm Mark.
I'm part of the @Google team.

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:10.250
I have to admit, I was a little bit hesitant
about today's talk.

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.570
I'm one of these people who thinks of computer
gamers as these sort of

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.560
teenaged troglodytes who heroically contribute
to the obesity crisis

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:18.700
rather than sort of as deeply social people
but I'm here to be proved

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.440
wrong, which is great.
So welcome, of course, Tom Chatfield who is

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:30.860
here to prove me wrong.
Tom has written this book Fun, Inc., and is

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:36.940
going to tell us all about
the social and business side of gaming, so

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.810
please welcome him.
Thanks.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:40.810
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:46.500
TOM CHATFIELD: Thank you for having me.
I've been to -- I've written a book that covers

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.720
all sorts of different
aspects of gaming, that talks about the social

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.235
aspects of gaming, that
talks about the business aspects of gaming,

00:00:51.235 --> 00:00:53.510
that talks about even games
in artistic terms.

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.110
But I wanted to talk with something specific.
One of the things that I think is one of the

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.610
most interesting key
points and key ways of thinking about games

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.840
in general -- video games
in particular -- which is, games as learning

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.579
engines, games as learning
experiences.

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:13.500
I've called it the fail epic.
Partly because I think one of the key aspects

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.590
of games is the way that
they transform our attitude towards failure,

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.409
the idea of failure, with
that, the idea of success.

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:27.130
I think there are really two key points about
all games which underpin

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.069
the fact that games have a history as old
as civilization.

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:33.340
In the first place, games in many ways, precede
civilization.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.759
And this is the fact that games touch something
very fundamental in us

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:41.729
by being both concentrated kinds of experience
and safe kinds of

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.369
experience.
So quintessential games, historically, were

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.829
to do with warfare and to
do with social hierarchy.

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:52.179
That these were safe, concentrated, repetitive
ways of honing absolutely

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:56.299
vital skills, but skills that would get you
killed if you tried to

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:00.041
practice them by just going out and doing
them.

00:02:00.041 --> 00:02:03.619
So games offer a safe, concentrated environment
and the structure of

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:07.520
incentives and rewards to keep people doing
these things and

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.989
practicing, getting better at these absolutely
vital skills.

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:15.540
And in many ways, computer games are intensification
of this, of the

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.720
key things they offer to games in general
is the kind of feedback you

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.579
get is far, far more rapid and the kind of
control that you have over

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:31.209
the experience that you get from it is far,
far more precise than

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.494
anything we've seen before.
Start off with a cheerful quote from Samuel

00:02:35.494 --> 00:02:37.530
Beckett.
This really is about the idea of recasting

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.540
failure, not as an absolute
-- you failed, therefore it's all over.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:46.010
It's about recasting failure as something
that you do better.

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:52.610
It's a step on the way to success.
And this, I think, gets at one of the key

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.830
points about all games which
is transforming failure, I think video games

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.740
are doing this in sort of
a particularly intense and remarkable way.

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.500
A slightly different quote.
I'm not quite sure what metric Woody Allen

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.810
was using to arrive at his
statistic.

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.280
But I think he's hit on something there, by
far the most common form of

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.019
failure is not trying.
By far the most common form of failure is

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:20.390
not being prepared to engage
in a task in the first place, because it's

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.359
intimidating, because of the
risk of censure.

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:27.049
Because it's -- if you're worried about how
something will go, if the

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:30.930
result is something that scares you, you're
unlikely to brave it or

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.650
take it on.
Now, we're talking about video games as learning

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.079
engines.
I'm not talking about taking video games and

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:40.239
putting them into
classrooms.

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:45.700
It's not about using Pac-Man to teach Spanish.
It's not about saying that everyone in a history

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.719
class ought to be
playing Age of Empires in order to learn about

00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:52.129
history.
I think that kind of argument misses the point

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:57.650
because what games are
doing is showing us some very powerful, underlying

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.010
human principles
about learning and about structures of learning.

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.719
And what's been remarkable over the 50-odd
years that computer games

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:09.489
have existed is that they haven't stood still,
they didn't just arrive

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:14.709
in the world as addictive, compelling, fully-formed
activities.

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:19.810
They began as one thing, and then because
of commercial and social

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.630
pressures, they have followed an incredibly
rapid evolutionary curve,

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.810
next to their authors, in terms of engaging
people, in terms of

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.120
incrementally improving the kind of engagement
they offer.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.740
And I want to look at the underlying lessons
that come from it.

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:40.350
First of all, talk a little bit about traditional
learning and

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:44.390
training.
Now, this is a bit of a cliche to say that

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:50.520
traditional learning and
training has stood still for sort of hundreds

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.910
of years.
It's certainly true that we have a very schizophrenic

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:58.480
attitude towards
play and towards play-like activities.

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:03.670
And we absolutely accept that up to the ages
of 5 or 6 the bulk of the

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:07.510
way that people learn about the world around
them is by sort of

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:11.760
playful, unstructured or game-like activities
and then suddenly we do a

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.660
switch.
We insist that the hard work begins.

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:18.960
And we begin what you could sum up as a rather
linear, straight-forward

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.570
process of learning.
And there have been plenty of efforts to change

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:25.740
this to a form to
introduce group work, a lot of these have

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.810
been very effective.
But they haven't really, I think, had underlying

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:33.040
principles rooted in
empirical study, what people are actually

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:37.340
like.
So I want to talk about a few of the sort

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:41.770
of cliche limitations of
traditional attitudes towards learning approach.

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:52.140
There we have a traditional learning scene.
So first thing is few failures; they're not

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:54.520
experimental.
Now I don't mean that people aren't failing.

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.350
In fact, if you think of learning as being
something that's truly

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:01.740
tested by what it does for the weakest members
of the group, and if you

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:06.620
imagine a weak 6- or 7-year old struggling
to learn to read a passage

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:10.600
in fact, their experience in traditional lesson
is likely to be almost

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:15.400
entirely composed of failure.
There will probably be three or four decisive

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:19.460
failures, at which point
someone is very likely to give up.

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:23.910
What it isn't is experimental, and what they're
not being given is

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:28.920
opportunities to fail in a positive way.
They will simply try to stumble through a

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:33.040
few sentences, stop, and
really be able to go no further.

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:39.240
There's no control they have over it.
And it makes the second point, that there's

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.580
a lot of censure associated
with this kind of failure.

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:46.530
It's pain not gain from these sorts of things.
When confronted the sheet they're supposed

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:49.670
to be reading, and words
don't make sense to them in the classroom,

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:53.010
there is humiliation.
There is frustration.

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:55.840
There's a big turn off.
There's not really that much else.

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:00.060
And the feedback is very slow.
I think it's still true especially for weaker

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:03.900
people that often when
some people sit down to their duty the first

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:10.260
or second time they
actually sat for an exam, the feedback they

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.440
get takes a long time to
come.

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:16.280
It can seem very distant from what they're
doing and seem very

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:20.090
incomprehensible and threatening.
And I think this applies just as much to a

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:22.970
lot of training
environments, implicitly or explicitly, that

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:25.290
feedback is delivered in
big, ugly, rather unpleasant lumps.

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:29.130
And there's little personal investment.
By that I mean that someone doesn't have much

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:31.040
control over the process
they're going through.

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:37.280
If you imagine a person reading the textbook,
it's like the books

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:42.140
dumped on your desk -- work through it.
You don't really have much of an option to

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:43.940
choose anything to this
process.

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:45.560
You will submit to it.
You may succeed.

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:51.610
You may master it; you may not.
But really, it puts an enormous onus on teaching

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:54.240
you and on your
support structures, and an enormous onus on

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:59.760
your resourcefulness, but
it's not something you feel you can own in

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:05.870
any sort of a crucial way.
Part and central to this is, I think largely

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:10.100
true of most conventional training and teaching
that there is one thing that you're doing

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:13.780
at a time in front of you on the desk, and
task at the moment.

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:17.420
You may switch to another, but there's a single
path through it, and you

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:19.590
know with lots of people with a whole spectrum
of abilities, it's

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:26.510
almost a given that a lot of people will let
down by one way or nothing.

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:31.890
And re-connected to that history and progress,
so we've got our

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:35.380
person sitting down in a classroom studying
a piece of reading.

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:39.450
Now that teacher knows very well what the
syllabus is and probably has

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:44.130
a very good idea of where all their peoples
sit on the spectrum of are

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:47.460
they going to pass this exam at the end the
term.

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:49.330
But they don't really know much about this
at all.

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:52.400
They have very, very little grasp, even the
good ones, of where they

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:56.070
need to be eventually, of how long along that
path they are, and of

00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:59.580
where they've come from.
They might have a few scattered results and

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:02.690
grades, but really -- and
again, I'd say you get this in training environments

00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:07.180
as well, people
don't often have a precise grip on where they

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:11.040
need to be in the future
-- in a month, in two months, in three months'

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:16.460
time or any sense of
exactly how far in the year I've done this

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:20.880
or I've done that.
And this leads to limited peer relationships.

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:25.610
By which I mean, people tend to be very aware
of where they are on a

00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:28.180
hierarchy, compared to people around them
in the classroom.

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:32.380
The absolutely sure that you know by the age
of 6 or 7, someone's quite

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:37.100
aware of where they sit in the pecking order
of who is the top and who

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:41.210
the middle and who is the bottom.
But you don't have much insight into the process

00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:42.800
that's going on with
your colleagues, particularly in the classroom,

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:45.240
sitting around you
writing away.

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:48.420
You have no sense of their method till it
pops out at the end.

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:51.955
Your interactions with the relationship, tends
to be limited to, if you

00:09:51.955 --> 00:09:59.320
like, competition and worry.
Now video games -- and this is what I thought

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:01.150
about the trajectory
of games.

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:03.950
Cause in the beginning games were a bit like
that.

00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:07.430
Yes, when computer games arrived -- I suppose
Space War is the first

00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:11.140
true video game.
They were instantly much more exciting and

00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:12.240
accessible than pretty much
anything that had ever happened on a computer

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:15.870
before in terms of
sitting down and using them.

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:19.950
At the same time, they were designed by experts
for experts.

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:22.980
They were designed largely by male geeks for
other male geeks.

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:27.260
Even Space Invaders, a very simple game in
some ways, is very, very

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.300
harsh.
It's very, very unforgiving.

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:33.350
It's frankly very, very difficult.
You have to invest quite a lot in it to get

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:36.750
anywhere.
You die and you lose your lives.

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:38.060
That's it.
It's all over.

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:42.040
You got to start again.
I mean, Asteroids is an absolute nightmare

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:43.150
trying to get anywhere on
that.

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:46.240
These early games, they deserve their reputation
as a niche activity

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:52.830
for teenaged boys who didn't much like the
light because they were so

00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:55.520
difficult in so many ways.
In many ways, learning to master one of these

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:58.100
games was a traditional
learning experience.

00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:03.700
You had to work at it and some people did.
Some people invested hugely in it.

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:08.280
But that's where they began.
And if they just stayed there, [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:15.610
people said things teenaged
boys, get into them it is a bit of a geek

00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:16.840
and then you grow out of
them, you hope.

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:17.840
In fact,

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:20.279
[PAUSE]

00:11:20.279 --> 00:11:24.840
what happened is that games completely transformed
themselves over 30,

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:26.270
40, 50 years, and staggeringly transformed
themselves.

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:32.900
I think it's safe to say that electronic games
are now the world's

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:38.320
largest and fastest growing form of mass participation.
And I believe the largest mass participation

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:41.270
we've ever known in
history, the word "games" expanded hugely

00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:43.760
to cover a vast spectrum of
activities.

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:49.600
But I think that there's something to do with
learning that underlies

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:53.200
almost all the games in the world at the moment,
and that is something

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.720
that is evolved through basically the work
of trying to make more

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:57.290
money, if you like.
Trying to get more people interested in them.

00:11:57.290 --> 00:12:00.760
You got the Space Invaders and a certain kind
of person with a certain

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:05.550
slightly fanatical bent would enjoy playing
it and will try to get high

00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:09.160
scores, but you're missing out on a huge section
of the market.

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:13.220
And over time, people have tried to bring
in more and more different

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:17.450
kinds of player.
This obviously is a very nice Flying Mount,

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:20.080
from I think it's a
forthcoming Flying Mount.

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:24.560
I think that's going to be in Cataclysms.
I don't think you can get those yet.

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:28.589
But that's a very nice reward at the end game
of World of Warcraft.

00:12:28.589 --> 00:12:33.750
And you probably know to get to the end game
of Warcraft, not many

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:35.930
players achieve that, but it's about 12 million
people playing the game

00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:40.710
worldwide, very few of them will make it through
to any really

00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:43.360
high-level ranges.
And yet people keep playing, there are 12

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:46.550
million people playing this.
And that's because, in many ways, the game

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:51.730
has replaced the word fail
with a rather different idea.

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:58.341
And that is not yet succeeded.
By which I mean that the idea of fail at something

00:12:58.341 --> 00:13:02.100
 -- something
censorious, something dreadful, something

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:05.910
that puts you off so that
80 percent of you don't turn up, as it were.

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:08.380
80 percent of the world wouldn't bother turning
up to play video games

00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:12.430
in the first place, it's so alienating.
That's been replaced with the recognition

00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:15.540
that you can come up with
things that different players will do.

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:18.960
Richard Bath, among others, have talked about
four different player

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:22.440
types which covers pretty much the whole spectrum
of human tendencies:

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:26.890
People who want to explore, people who want
to achieve, people who want

00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:34.380
to communicate, that sort of thing.
But what we see -- I think Warcraft is a good

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:39.090
example because it's so
good at combining all the lessons of games

00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:42.530
from the last 40 or
50 years.

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:45.180
So I want to talk through a little bit about
what it does that is

00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:49.730
drawing and holding in so many different kinds
of people and giving

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:51.470
them the sense when they're playing that even
though most of them are

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:53.950
never going to make it into a raid, they're
never going to get Twin

00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:54.950
Blades, they're never going to, you know,
get to the real high-end

00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:55.950
content.
It doesn't feel like failure.

00:13:55.950 --> 00:14:01.339
In many ways it's exciting for them that there
are people who are doing

00:14:01.339 --> 00:14:05.320
that because they've got other stuff to do
which they find rewarding.

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:11.630
And the interesting thing is, the underpinning
of this, and there we have one of the latest

00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:15.520
versions of this, the idea of achievements,
which

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:18.890
self-evidently suck in thousands and thousands
of human hours around

00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:23.071
the world.
But what we got is the fact everyone who is

00:14:23.071 --> 00:14:26.250
playing Warcraft is really training for one
thing.

00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:30.810
They're training to control a character, and
click on a whole spectrum

00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:34.950
of different abilities and equip different
items in order to make their

00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:38.650
little character kill stuff.
That's all they're training to do.

00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:42.070
We lose sight of that because there's such
an incredibly elaborate

00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:45.510
network that is going on.
When in fact, we've been trained to do this

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:49.380
one thing and they've been
trained to do it incredibly well.

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:54.060
In terms of -- imagine a driving test.
Now the kind of training you get from Warcraft

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:56.690
is not like learning to
drive a car.

00:14:56.690 --> 00:15:02.910
It's like learning to race an F-1 race.
The level of skill that people are attaining

00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:06.529
from what the game puts
them through, the kind of training they voluntarily

00:15:06.529 --> 00:15:09.560
submit to, indeed
that they pay for, gets people to an incredible

00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:12.720
level of sophistication
and expertise.

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:16.580
People are very, very, very good at this game.
Lots of them, even somewhat bad at this game,

00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:17.580
is very good at this
game.

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:20.630
It's incredibly good at getting people to
put in hours of doing

00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:25.960
basically, which is hitting a ball with the
sword.

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:29.510
And -- it does this because it offers so many
different ways to people

00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:33.170
of making their activity feel like an incremental
success, a

00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:36.960
incremental progress.
First of all, we've got characters at level

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:38.200
70 characters, at the top
there.

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:42.930
And a little number that you make go up with
an experience bar.

00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:45.610
Everything you do is contributing towards
this number going up.

00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:50.000
It's a lovely sense of purpose.
At the same time, there's your reputation.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.060
You do stuff in different factions in the
games, you get a little

00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:55.390
reputation here.
You gain a bit of reputation there.

00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:58.360
You're more welcome in the city.
You get better prices in that city.

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:01.490
At the same time, there's player versus player,
if you want to PvP

00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:05.870
serve, beat other people up and get different
items.

00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:09.230
At the same time, there's gear.
There's this tantalizing random element, every

00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:12.600
time you attack a morph,
it's going to drop something with a chance

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:18.990
of it being really, really, really awesome.
And this is an amazing book, it was perfected

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:21.610
[INAUDIBLE] this in the
Diablo series of games.

00:16:21.610 --> 00:16:24.770
And whole Warcraft.
This is the very, very powerful incentive

00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:30.180
to people to just kill that
next bore and see if it happens to drop a

00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:31.700
blue item.
Achievements -- as I said this is possibly

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:36.600
the pièce de la résistance
of the Warcraft world.

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:40.770
By giving people an arbitrary task to do and
then allowing them to wear a title that says

00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:43.640
I've done that, I'm an explorer.
I've been everywhere.

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:47.980
You allow them to just do random stuff that
wasn't anywhere else and

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:52.160
wear it like a badge of pride in the community.
And that of course is about social studies.

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:57.481
It's absolutely crucial at that everybody's
in this world together, you

00:16:57.481 --> 00:16:59.930
can look at each other.
You are looking at each other all the time.

00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:05.270
And it's this that validates these achievements.
It's this context that really gives them meaning,

00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:08.279
and quite astonishing
value to people because your peers see everything

00:17:08.279 --> 00:17:11.829
you do.
And you in turn are excited by seeing people

00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:15.350
at the top level by seeing
what could happen.

00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:18.379
There's customizations, you have an enormous
and increasing amount of

00:17:18.379 --> 00:17:20.510
control over your avatar.
And that means you really come to own it.

00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:27.389
If you're bored, you can just go and get a
haircut.

00:17:27.389 --> 00:17:31.980
My wife is a doctor, and she spends quite
an amount of time in the game

00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:35.610
collecting an entire set of items with the
moniker of a physician.

00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:46.171
So she can go around wearing a complete of
a physician set, and she's a

00:17:46.171 --> 00:17:49.220
healer, in the game and in life.
And there's many paths.

00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:52.011
You're thrown into this game, and it's the
one game world, but it's a

00:17:52.011 --> 00:17:55.739
very big and flexible world.
You can choose many different classes.

00:17:55.739 --> 00:18:01.250
You can have many different Orcs.
You can explore and you're rewarded for doing

00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:02.450
each of these things.
Everything is validated.

00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:06.830
Everything is a form of progress.
You want to chat to people, you want to form

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:13.179
a guild, you want to tag
along with raids, fine.

00:18:13.179 --> 00:18:14.179
You want to go around causing grief, fine.
If you want to go around ganking people, that's

00:18:14.179 --> 00:18:15.179
okay.
Possibly.

00:18:15.179 --> 00:18:16.399
You -- it adapts to people.
And it never stands still whilst it gathers

00:18:16.399 --> 00:18:19.470
a tremendous amount of
data, something which I don't need to tell

00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:20.730
people here about.
And this data is establishing a path because

00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:26.029
 -- and this data, this
information that's really been driving the

00:18:26.029 --> 00:18:30.789
industry forward, at what I
would say is the pretty [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:30.789 --> 00:18:34.900
To come from Space Invaders -- bip, bip, bip
 -- 20 nerdy men interested

00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:38.450
in getting five points, to something which
can hold the attention for

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:43.989
thousands of hours of 12 million people around
the world, or [inaudible], 100 billion users

00:18:43.989 --> 00:18:48.909
or something like Zynga's casual games
with close to 200 million users.

00:18:48.909 --> 00:18:53.239
This is absolutely staggering, staggering
achievement in finding out

00:18:53.239 --> 00:18:56.989
what it is that gets people doing something,
and keep them doing it,

00:18:56.989 --> 00:19:03.519
and wanting to improve.
And it's I think what underlies it, is taking

00:19:03.519 --> 00:19:12.389
all the things that
would put them off and just loosely boosting

00:19:12.389 --> 00:19:19.210
instead their investment
in making all sorts of different kinds of

00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:20.210
progress, making energy.
What does all this mean, then?

00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:21.710
I could talk in generalities about what -- as
I said at the start, it's

00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:25.250
not about putting Pac-Man into the classrooms.
It's not about saying, therefore, everyone

00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:27.269
in a Spanish class ought to
play Warcraft.

00:19:27.269 --> 00:19:30.580
This is absolute rubbish.
It's about recognizing what the underlying

00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:34.669
principles are.
First of all, this is where I think games

00:19:34.669 --> 00:19:38.340
show us a different way of
thinking about people, due to traditional

00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:40.500
learning and training
structure.

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:45.890
Failures should be frequent, recurrent, recognized,
and free of stigma.

00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:49.190
You should not be failing three or four times
in an hour a test and giving up.

00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:54.659
You should be not succeeding 20 times in the
space of a minute, and

00:19:54.659 --> 00:20:00.639
still having a bit of recognition for that,
getting something for that.

00:20:00.639 --> 00:20:05.009
And just doing it again.
Take a wonderful game on the Playstation 3

00:20:05.009 --> 00:20:06.009
called Flower, by
Jenova Chen and thatgamecompany.

00:20:06.009 --> 00:20:11.249
And this is -- it's not a perfect game but
what it is I think is a

00:20:11.249 --> 00:20:14.780
wonderful way of recasting failure as something
triumphant and

00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:18.489
personal, because you control it by moving,
the weed and moving the

00:20:18.489 --> 00:20:24.359
control around [INAUDIBLE] around, and you
have to pick up other flower

00:20:24.359 --> 00:20:27.389
petals.
And when you start playing this game, as some

00:20:27.389 --> 00:20:31.080
of you may know, it's
almost impossible to control the thing.

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:34.669
You're -- wind is blowing and the flower petal,
you can spend about 50

00:20:34.669 --> 00:20:37.799
times trying to pick up other petals on the
ground, swooping around

00:20:37.799 --> 00:20:40.450
with the control pad, and it's really very,
very difficult.

00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:44.429
But you don't throw the control across the
room.

00:20:44.429 --> 00:20:48.619
You fail 50 times within about the space of
about two minutes.

00:20:48.619 --> 00:20:50.419
And you pick up your first petal, and then
you start to move, and then

00:20:50.419 --> 00:20:54.130
you start to do other stuff.
And as a bit of spatial training, training

00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:57.020
someone who's never
interacted with a computer before, there are

00:20:57.020 --> 00:21:00.179
plenty of people like this
in the world, just moving something around

00:21:00.179 --> 00:21:04.070
to control something
beautiful on a screen is a very, very good

00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:08.039
way of lowering the bearings
of entry, of teaching people how to access

00:21:08.039 --> 00:21:12.070
this electronic world and
the reason I think that people are unafraid

00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:17.519
to fail 50 times in two
minutes in this game is that there is no stigma

00:21:17.519 --> 00:21:19.299
attached.
That the experience is not punishing you for

00:21:19.299 --> 00:21:24.029
not yet succeeding.
It's merely enticing you with graphics, with

00:21:24.029 --> 00:21:27.009
sounds.
It uses principles of flow as well, so it

00:21:27.009 --> 00:21:30.950
adapts to your own way
of doing things.

00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:37.730
And really, it's a completely different way
of thinking about a problem

00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:39.470
and a skill set.
It draws you on.

00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:41.529
Second, progress should be clear and cumulative,
with multiple paths

00:21:41.529 --> 00:21:44.220
and show increments.
What I'm talking about here is what I was

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:46.830
saying about a person sitting
in a classroom, desperately trying to read

00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:50.080
through a passage with
absolutely no idea what this means in the

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:54.029
context of a GCSE or a term
or even a letter.

00:21:54.029 --> 00:21:56.399
Now what you can do in games, for instance,
to take World of Warcraft

00:21:56.399 --> 00:21:57.639
again, first time you play the game, you've
got all the numbers, I was

00:21:57.639 --> 00:22:04.369
talking about all your level and everything
like that, and you are

00:22:04.369 --> 00:22:10.129
plunked in the middle of cities.
Cities like [INAUDIBLE], when you're surrounded

00:22:10.129 --> 00:22:14.159
by people who have been
playing the game for thousands of hours surrounded

00:22:14.159 --> 00:22:19.470
by amazing items.
You can wander as a level five character into

00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:23.869
a level 55 area, and look
at the absolute terrifying monsters in there.

00:22:23.869 --> 00:22:28.090
And people do do this, and this is about knowing
where you're going.

00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:32.529
The entire thing is laid out for you in tiny
increments.

00:22:32.529 --> 00:22:36.220
You can see exactly where you'll be at level
55 or level 60 or level

00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:39.539
65, you can see and start to appreciate what
the end game loot will

00:22:39.539 --> 00:22:43.649
look like, what it might look like.
And this is tremendously incentivizing.

00:22:43.649 --> 00:22:45.570
You can see exactly where you've come from
and measure your progress

00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:50.859
but all of the criteria is listed, everything
from level reputation, you

00:22:50.859 --> 00:22:54.440
take ownership of all of it, you see precisely
where you are on the

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:56.570
scale.
And this really gives people a tremendous

00:22:56.570 --> 00:23:01.559
sense of choosing where they
want to be, and of choosing to invest the

00:23:01.559 --> 00:23:03.999
activities.
It's like going back to the analogy of the

00:23:03.999 --> 00:23:08.419
school.
Someone in a math class struggling to learn

00:23:08.419 --> 00:23:13.429
about differential
equations, having free to access at any moment

00:23:13.429 --> 00:23:16.739
post-graduate level
mathematics, imagining numbers, all sorts

00:23:16.739 --> 00:23:20.450
of other highly advanced
theories and realizing in the very structure

00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:23.461
of the set-up that what
they're doing now in their very basic way

00:23:23.461 --> 00:23:27.039
is on a spectrum with these
other amazing things.

00:23:27.039 --> 00:23:30.690
You see yourself in context and that is enormously
empowering for

00:23:30.690 --> 00:23:34.259
people to understand exactly how far they've
progressed on the same

00:23:34.259 --> 00:23:38.200
virtual scale towards where they want to be
and towards where they

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:40.100
might be.
Not everybody gets to the end game of Warcraft,

00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:47.889
but it's a great part
of the game to be able to see where that end

00:23:47.889 --> 00:23:48.889
game is.
Not everybody does a post-graduate degree

00:23:48.889 --> 00:23:51.299
in math, but it's
tremendously inspiring for someone struggling

00:23:51.299 --> 00:23:55.080
with differential
equations to understand on a measure as to

00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:59.019
where this fits in with the
far larger world beyond that, to understand

00:23:59.019 --> 00:24:02.769
the whole spectrum of
things and wholly contextualize their own

00:24:02.769 --> 00:24:07.369
activities and see their
progress bit by bit.

00:24:07.369 --> 00:24:12.740
Finally, fairness and transparency.
You know what everybody else is doing.

00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:17.320
And this is really about the fact of turning
the social dynamic into

00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:20.049
something positive.
So you have your classroom situation when

00:24:20.049 --> 00:24:21.049
nobody knows what happens
until the results of the tests come out and

00:24:21.049 --> 00:24:25.080
then it's all back-biting
and back-stabbing but if you can see in real

00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:30.109
time what everybody else
is doing around you, if you can compare yourself

00:24:30.109 --> 00:24:34.679
to them, then you have
options to collaborate.

00:24:34.679 --> 00:24:39.059
You have options to cooperate.
You have options to learn from other people.

00:24:39.059 --> 00:24:43.119
And one of the interesting things about games
is that people, people

00:24:43.119 --> 00:24:48.210
really don't mind things being hard in the
long term.

00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:52.039
They don't mind the lofty, distant pinnacles
being a long way away.

00:24:52.039 --> 00:24:54.679
If it's completely clear how they and everybody
else are getting there,

00:24:54.679 --> 00:24:57.859
if it's completely clear that the playing
field is level, and it's

00:24:57.859 --> 00:25:01.149
completely clear what they need to do to get
there.

00:25:01.149 --> 00:25:03.799
There's one very interesting innovation in
the new Super Mario Brothers

00:25:03.799 --> 00:25:05.480
Wii -- I don't know if anybody has played
that.

00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:11.700
But it has a very nice feature called the
Super Gauntlet -- and this

00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:18.470
is, if you fail a level eight times in a row
or to fail it, a little

00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:20.869
window pops up at the start and says, "Hi,
you're having difficulty

00:25:20.869 --> 00:25:25.970
with this level.
Would you like us to take you through it?"

00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:34.490
And if you say yes -- you have the option
 -- then the computer takes

00:25:34.490 --> 00:25:38.429
over and controls your character, takes you
through the level.

00:25:38.429 --> 00:25:45.690
And at any moment you can interrupt that and
take over again.

00:25:45.690 --> 00:26:01.480
But what this does -- now you might think
putting this kind of thing,

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:07.700
it breaks a game, it's brings [INAUDIBLE]
in fact, sort of tremendously

00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:14.019
positive response, it's very, very well done.
Because what it does is, it recognizes the

00:26:14.019 --> 00:26:23.519
point at which someone is
about to give up and intervenes and offers

00:26:23.519 --> 00:26:28.320
them a route to take part in
it.

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:40.919
Just knowing it's there, is extraordinarily
helpful and having the option to take it out

00:26:40.919 --> 00:26:49.700
it keeps people playing.
It stops you from losing.

00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:59.989
And this is the thing I think that as long
as there isn't a silver

00:26:59.989 --> 00:27:06.870
bullet or a shortcut, as long as there's not
something which negates

00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:12.960
effort, then really the more mechanisms like
this, the better.

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:20.450
If it's fair for everybody and everybody is
aware what everybody else

00:27:20.450 --> 00:27:33.090
is doing, then supporting people to keep on
the path, to keep engaged

00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:40.519
is a sort of good for the learning environments.
You don't want to lose people.

00:27:40.519 --> 00:27:44.830
And there are some very sophisticated ways
about keeping people engaged

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:51.039
and aware that the operation is fair.
Really, why is all this --

00:27:51.039 --> 00:27:54.549
Why is all this exciting?
And I think it's exciting because we are at

00:27:54.549 --> 00:28:03.200
the beginning of something.
We look at how far, how fast games have come

00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:09.200
in 40 or 50 years.
And not only games.

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:14.580
Of course, these are lessons which are being
learned in terms of

00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:50.580
usability and access across all sorts of vehicles.
But I think it is happened more intensely

00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:52.369
and with more incredible
focus in the world of games than anywhere

00:28:52.369 --> 00:28:55.669
else because of the unique
way that games tap into us as learning creatures,

00:28:55.669 --> 00:29:07.590
and because of the
way that they allow us to rephrase failure

00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:16.540
as success.
And I think if you look at what someone is

00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:21.610
doing when they sit down to
use anything from a new piece of software

00:29:21.610 --> 00:29:26.259
to using, to taking, to
learning a new job or trying to learn a new

00:29:26.259 --> 00:29:30.509
skill or trying to get on
something, you can really start to explode

00:29:30.509 --> 00:29:33.600
the concept of learning into
something far more just imbibing data.

00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:37.830
You can take ownership of it.
And these kind of techniques that I think

00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:39.549
underpin games, allow people
to be themselves differently.

00:29:39.549 --> 00:29:44.389
They allow people to be braver.
They allow people to replace the fear and

00:29:44.389 --> 00:29:46.869
uncertainty and lack of
engagement with the ability to make really

00:29:46.869 --> 00:29:53.049
bold moves, to learn from
each other and the ability to take ownership

00:29:53.049 --> 00:29:58.289
of their progress.
And I think as I said, we are at the start

00:29:58.289 --> 00:30:03.370
of something now.
And I will be very excited indeed to see where

00:30:03.370 --> 00:30:06.669
it goes and where it
ends.

00:30:06.669 --> 00:30:15.629
I'm going to throw it open to questions at
this point.

00:30:15.629 --> 00:30:18.239
I think it's probably more interesting to
start talking earlier rather

00:30:18.239 --> 00:30:19.239
than later.
Yes?

00:30:19.239 --> 00:30:27.190
&gt;&gt; I was going to say I definitely agree it
seems to be natural that

00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:37.559
games are going to move away from a position
of not being able to fail,

00:30:37.559 --> 00:30:41.940
because [INAUDIBLE] examples of times when
you just completely fail

00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:46.509
like [INAUDIBLE] that but I think there's
another thing as well as not

00:30:46.509 --> 00:30:48.500
yet succeeding, which is also like a human
desire to beat other people.

00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:50.029
And if you're playing on say like Halo or
something like that, you play

00:30:50.029 --> 00:30:54.710
that because like you want to defeat other
people and show superiority

00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:58.549
over them.
I think that's another like equally important

00:30:58.549 --> 00:31:00.679
thought as not yet
succeeding.

00:31:00.679 --> 00:31:04.529
TOM CHATFIELD: Yeah, in terms of not -- in
addition to not yet

00:31:04.529 --> 00:31:07.580
succeeding, there's also, you mean, this drive
to meet and compare

00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:10.900
yourself to other people.
That's a key factor is that what you're --

00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:16.039
&gt;&gt; I just mean that it's not as simple as
going from not failing to

00:31:16.039 --> 00:31:19.090
not yet succeeding.
That's there kind of a human instinct to succeed

00:31:19.090 --> 00:31:21.639
through defeating
other people which may be missed and there

00:31:21.639 --> 00:31:47.659
is an aside to this.

00:31:47.659 --> 00:32:27.659
TOM CHATFIELD: Yes, I think

00:32:27.659 --> 00:32:29.980
so.
I think absolutely that the social context

00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:31.840
is, is really what drives
it.

00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:35.889
What gives it a point in one sense, there's
little point in sort of --

00:32:35.889 --> 00:32:42.570
and I think defeating other people is a very
strong way of putting it

00:32:42.570 --> 00:32:47.999
-- because I think that games are very good
at rephrasing that as

00:32:47.999 --> 00:32:51.899
another one of these ongoing tasks.
So, yes, you build up your, you know, your

00:32:51.899 --> 00:32:54.649
 -- your kills in Halo, but
you never decisively beat people.

00:32:54.649 --> 00:32:58.659
It never ends.
You're engaged in a sort of constant incremental

00:32:58.659 --> 00:33:03.239
process of comparison.
And this, I mean, you're absolutely right.

00:33:03.239 --> 00:33:07.619
This constant social development is what really
driving the fastest

00:33:07.619 --> 00:33:12.779
growing games industry forward.
I think it always -- I think with most games,

00:33:12.779 --> 00:33:17.139
comparing yourself to
other people underpins it, but I think -- I

00:33:17.139 --> 00:33:21.409
think it's actually wrong
to think about the most powerful thing as

00:33:21.409 --> 00:33:24.019
I beat you and I'm better
than you.

00:33:24.019 --> 00:33:27.289
In all games, we never want the competition
to end.

00:33:27.289 --> 00:33:31.039
In a football league, you don't say, right,
well we found out who's the

00:33:31.039 --> 00:33:36.190
best at football.
We don't need to play football anymore.

00:33:36.190 --> 00:33:38.200
Let's do cricket.
And we've done cricket and then we can do

00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:41.499
golf.
And then have a play these games anymore,

00:33:41.499 --> 00:33:44.340
we found out who's the best
at golf.

00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:47.519
We like keeping track of these things over
time.

00:33:47.519 --> 00:33:51.779
And interesting, there are games, the games
in which there are no

00:33:51.779 --> 00:33:56.279
winners are ultra, ultra competitive, I think.
And you're in part competing with yourself,

00:33:56.279 --> 00:33:57.570
partly competing with other
people.

00:33:57.570 --> 00:34:02.389
Take Farmville, the Facebook game.
You're not killing anyone; you're not beating

00:34:02.389 --> 00:34:07.220
anything, but you are
almost sort of fanatically trying to have

00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:12.500
a better and better and
better list of virtual pet as it were, and

00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:20.280
the only criteria for better
is first of all, a better than yourself, a

00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:25.730
bit better than you were
yesterday but yet better than your friends

00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:29.549
around you, better than your
peers on Facebook.

00:34:29.549 --> 00:34:35.450
And so although in Halo, it happens that what
you're doing in the game

00:34:35.450 --> 00:34:41.000
is shooting other people rather than watering
crops, you're not trying

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:46.559
to vanquish them as an enemy.
You're not trying to end the game, you're

00:34:46.559 --> 00:34:49.129
not trying to end the
competition.

00:34:49.129 --> 00:34:56.089
It would be very boring if any one of you
is overpowered could just win by breaking

00:34:56.089 --> 00:35:01.529
the rules.
What you're trying to do is have this sort

00:35:01.529 --> 00:35:05.369
of rolling improvement and
assessment, validated by your relations with

00:35:05.369 --> 00:35:07.079
other people.
Does that --

00:35:07.079 --> 00:35:08.359
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I guess.

00:35:08.359 --> 00:35:09.640
TOM CHATFIELD: Yes?

00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:10.640
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE SPEAKER]

00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:22.099
TOM CHATFIELD: Well, I think one of the simplest
examples -- I mean,

00:35:22.099 --> 00:35:38.500
across the world of training, it's not that
you take a company and run

00:35:38.500 --> 00:36:10.480
the entire company along these lines.
You can take training and run it along these

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:17.690
lines.
For instance the military, if you look at

00:36:17.690 --> 00:36:24.940
the U.S. military alone is
now spending $6 billion a year on games and

00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:29.560
game-like activities.
And they set these things up.

00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:35.020
For instance, when you are using, you know,
the first person

00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:38.799
environment, America's Army, or when you're
using various simulations

00:36:38.799 --> 00:36:44.020
to try and test anti-terrorism and population
location tactics, they use

00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:53.390
precisely this kind of set up, to give people
the chance not just to do

00:36:53.390 --> 00:36:59.910
a war game which ends in disaster, but to
revisit their mistakes and

00:36:59.910 --> 00:37:05.950
their common errors again and again and again
and again, and try and

00:37:05.950 --> 00:37:10.140
integrate.
In fact, they've just been coming up with

00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:18.520
a version of SimCity Baghdad,
I think, where people who hang out there are

00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:26.960
to be given this virtual
toy to play with, to make lots of mistakes

00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:42.339
with, but in the context
that allows them to try stuff, because that

00:37:42.339 --> 00:37:49.250
is the way that they learn.
So you, you can -- and you can, as it were,

00:37:49.250 --> 00:37:54.960
get people to admit to
errors that they might otherwise conceal.

00:37:54.960 --> 00:38:03.200
You can have someone say, well, what happens
when if I just send out

00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:07.990
20,000 troops into the street to shoot on
sight?

00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:10.119
You know, why not?
Let's see if that works.

00:38:10.119 --> 00:38:19.090
And you get the people to try and do that.
And because A.) The exercise is not incredibly

00:38:19.090 --> 00:38:23.920
expensive -- because war
games traditionally have been prohibitively,

00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:25.730
massively, hugely
expensive.

00:38:25.730 --> 00:38:32.730
You want to drive a tank around, you want
to fly a jet, it's going to

00:38:32.730 --> 00:38:38.839
cost you millions of dollars an hour.
Whereas in this, you have safe repeatable

00:38:38.839 --> 00:38:44.720
environment, you can do that again and again
and again and again.

00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:51.859
And you can say, well, actually troops on
the streets, nobody likes me.

00:38:51.859 --> 00:38:56.750
And I get assassinated.
Medicine is another great area, example of

00:38:56.750 --> 00:38:59.609
this.
People looking into virtual triage tools,

00:38:59.609 --> 00:39:02.490
for instance.
Where you can play out scenarios again and

00:39:02.490 --> 00:39:06.049
again, and you can -- for
instance, triage is about prioritizing casualties

00:39:06.049 --> 00:39:17.910
in order of treatment
in a disaster setting.

00:39:17.910 --> 00:39:28.830
You can very accurately model the, the vital
signs that you would get

00:39:28.830 --> 00:39:43.940
from people in a disaster area.
You can try out all sorts of different sequences

00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:52.789
of treatment and
allocation of resources, see which one works.

00:39:52.789 --> 00:39:55.530
Again, without the censure of mistakes, without
the vast expense, that

00:39:55.530 --> 00:39:58.440
even doing active medical training with real
doctors involves.

00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:03.549
And I think, as I say, we're only just really
beginning to see this .

00:40:03.549 --> 00:40:08.800
But I'm talking about training and education.
And there's also I suppose the simple principle

00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:12.520
of usability testing.
A lot of software, a lot of people are finally

00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:16.200
starting to get their
heads around the fact, I think, in -- it's

00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:23.230
not even vast enough,
like Microsoft is finally starting to pay

00:40:23.230 --> 00:40:30.480
attention to the fact that
certain versions of products may be getting

00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:36.510
less and less usable and
they needed to pare them down and have fewer

00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:39.170
clicks.
And I think what you might call form of play

00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:42.519
testing is actually
incremental but instrumental in arriving at

00:40:42.519 --> 00:40:46.680
these insights and
therefore best practices.

00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:51.080
Is that useful, yeah?

00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:56.460
&gt;&gt; So as you know in World of Warcraft and
many other games are there

00:40:56.460 --> 00:40:57.460
[INAUDIBLE]

00:40:57.460 --> 00:41:01.789
TOM CHATFIELD: So you asked me about the,
sort of, the idea of

00:41:01.789 --> 00:41:07.970
automation of bots to play games, and where
AI comes into all this.

00:41:07.970 --> 00:41:13.869
And I suppose it's certainly true that one
way of rephrasing that

00:41:13.869 --> 00:41:20.210
question would be, if you're able to take
a situation, and express that

00:41:20.210 --> 00:41:25.990
situation as a game situation with particular
aims and rewards, that

00:41:25.990 --> 00:41:34.910
goes a long way towards telling you how to
come up with an AI tool or

00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:43.010
an automated tool to try and solve this situation.
And so I think there's a lot of two-way traffic

00:41:43.010 --> 00:41:48.190
that can go on between
the idea of taking a complicated game environment

00:41:48.190 --> 00:41:54.119
and coming up with
routines which are able to exploit that to

00:41:54.119 --> 00:41:58.730
 -- with maximum efficiency.
And the idea of rephrasing, if you like, problems,

00:41:58.730 --> 00:42:07.470
digital problems or
computational problems or real world problems

00:42:07.470 --> 00:42:20.089
as game set ups.
I suppose I feel that we're very, very much

00:42:20.089 --> 00:42:26.890
at the really early days
with AI.

00:42:26.890 --> 00:42:42.750
One of the interesting points, a lot of games
over time have had

00:42:42.750 --> 00:42:47.490
artificial intelligence, some of which have
been thought by players to

00:42:47.490 --> 00:42:53.440
be particularly fiendish you know, command
conquered-centered, World of

00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:58.080
Warcraft 3, sort of people.
I mean, those are not particularly fiendish

00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:02.950
but the lessons have always
been with those thus far I think that fully

00:43:02.950 --> 00:43:09.680
functioning AI's haven't been terribly effective
in games, but what was been effective is looking

00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:14.730
at play-tested, is looking at what lots of
people do, is just crunching

00:43:14.730 --> 00:43:20.030
very large amounts of data about what people
are likely to do and

00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:25.500
putting in sort of preprogrammed behaviors
that respond to known human

00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:31.540
aptitudes.
So I suppose there's a bit of a -- bit of

00:43:31.540 --> 00:43:36.900
a conflict in game science,
if you like, between the idea of trying to

00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:40.410
come up with first
principles and artificial intelligences, which

00:43:40.410 --> 00:43:45.650
can respond to the game
in a really effective manner, and the idea

00:43:45.650 --> 00:43:48.190
of measuring how lots of
people play game.

00:43:48.190 --> 00:43:53.029
And come up with ways responding to the way
that people use this game.

00:43:53.029 --> 00:43:59.320
And so far responding to people has proved
to be a much more fertile

00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:06.520
avenue, and using games to study human behavior
and then respond to

00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:15.430
that has been much more fertile than if you
like using games to study

00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:19.550
AI behavior - and then I don't -- most bots
aren't very impressive.

00:44:19.550 --> 00:44:23.630
I can't really think of any -- any game-based
AI that really deserves

00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:30.480
the name of AI.
And I don't think we'll be seeing that for

00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:36.910
quite a while, actually.
Because I think that the observation of what

00:44:36.910 --> 00:44:42.940
people do, if you like,
the use of cleverer, cleverer, cleverer observational

00:44:42.940 --> 00:44:49.990
crowd source
tricks is really what the sort of the driving

00:44:49.990 --> 00:44:52.540
functional force.

00:44:52.540 --> 00:45:04.680
&gt;&gt; You kind of touched on it a bit talking
about AI.

00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:08.520
For example, Halo is generally regarded as
one of the best AI computer games because

00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:10.400
they seem to be getting smarter but their
activities are very much constrained.

00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:11.560
And this ties into what you talking about
with simulate a [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:14.150
TOM CHATFIELD: I mean, a game would be no
good if it wasn't

00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:16.200
constrained.
The game is about simplification.

00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:17.300
So yes, it's absolutely about the quality
of your models.

00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:20.099
And there are, I guess, two things really,
I think -- it's about the

00:45:20.099 --> 00:45:23.779
quality of observation you can bring to bear.
So the people playing a game agree, and they

00:45:23.779 --> 00:45:28.490
behave in very sort of
real ways in a game setting.

00:45:28.490 --> 00:45:31.730
So on the one hand, you have the opportunity
to observe how real people

00:45:31.730 --> 00:45:35.250
behave in far more complicated settings than
almost any other kind of

00:45:35.250 --> 00:45:39.869
experiment I could think of.
And on the other hand, you have the opportunity

00:45:39.869 --> 00:45:43.840
to measure the real
world as accurately as you possibly can, and

00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:47.220
then try and put that data
into what -- into a model.

00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:52.690
So for instance, I suppose with something
like you know sort of SimCity

00:45:52.690 --> 00:45:57.421
Baghdad, you have to throw out the window
all sorts of things that you

00:45:57.421 --> 00:46:00.450
could -- that you might want to do because
they're completely

00:46:00.450 --> 00:46:02.630
unfeasible.
You have to try and get down to what the game

00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:05.190
can actually do.
And I guess what it can do is not tell people

00:46:05.190 --> 00:46:07.900
what it's going to be
like in Baghdad, but it can teach them the

00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:16.000
kind of thinking that will
be useful to them in a city in that situation.

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:19.100
It can teach them what you might call system
thinking, about the way

00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:22.049
that different variables in a system will
interact in emergent or

00:46:22.049 --> 00:46:25.900
complex ways with each other.
And this is a very, very important way of

00:46:25.900 --> 00:46:26.900
thinking for the 21st
century.

00:46:26.900 --> 00:46:30.349
And it's a way that I think that has to be
learned.

00:46:30.349 --> 00:46:34.570
So in one sense, if they're trained to adjust
variables minutely, if

00:46:34.570 --> 00:46:38.010
they're trained not to commit the fallacies
of thinking that one

00:46:38.010 --> 00:46:42.090
sudden, dramatic move can solve a problem,
they're trained to look to

00:46:42.090 --> 00:46:45.170
multiple variables, and to try and just think
of the problem in front

00:46:45.170 --> 00:46:52.720
of them as a system.
Almost to try to come up with their own mental

00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:57.580
models of it, and that's
where the real power lies.

00:46:57.580 --> 00:47:01.520
So games are -- games are absolutely about
modelling, but done right.

00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:04.470
By putting a really good model in front of
a real person, you teach

00:47:04.470 --> 00:47:06.220
them to model the world experimentally to
themselves better, and you

00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:09.790
also teach them, I think, to try and see the
people around you.

00:47:09.790 --> 00:47:14.950
It allows you to model the behaviors of the
people around you know to

00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:19.350
find out things about people that you don't
necessarily -- you don't

00:47:19.350 --> 00:47:24.160
necessarily see in day-to-day life.
You don't have the opportunity to observe

00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:25.309
people in these kind of,
almost experimental conditions.

00:47:25.309 --> 00:47:26.309
Yes?

00:47:26.309 --> 00:47:27.309
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE SPEAKER]

00:47:27.309 --> 00:47:32.140
TOM CHATFIELD: I think there's a lot of -- yeah.
I think there's potential conflicts of interest

00:47:32.140 --> 00:47:35.440
there.
But I think really we're going to see some

00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:38.130
big eruptions in the coming
century between people, sort of, investment

00:47:38.130 --> 00:47:39.130
in virtual property, which
they actually have no ownership rights over,

00:47:39.130 --> 00:47:41.180
and the companies who
claim total ownership over that kind of property.

00:47:41.180 --> 00:47:42.710
And I think you do -- you're getting to the
stage already in some games I guess Eve Online

00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:43.710
is the most complicated example of this, where
there is-- it's reached a stage where there's

00:47:43.710 --> 00:47:44.710
a ongoing negotiation between the players
and the people setting the rules.

00:47:44.710 --> 00:47:46.039
Because -- I mean, it is rather a sort of
paradoxical situation that

00:47:46.039 --> 00:47:47.039
people invest an awful lot of themselves to
into this and wish to exert

00:47:47.039 --> 00:47:48.039
some customizable control.
But at the same time, the totality of this

00:47:48.039 --> 00:47:49.039
whole world is owned by a
single corporate entity which at any moment

00:47:49.039 --> 00:47:50.039
holds the keys has the right to switch you
off.

00:47:50.039 --> 00:47:51.039
Again, this is an issue that people here will
be very familiar with in

00:47:51.039 --> 00:47:52.039
different terms, but I think the legal structures
needed to deal with

00:47:52.039 --> 00:47:53.039
this are nascent as well, and I think the
philosophical structures are

00:47:53.039 --> 00:47:54.039
interestingly, I think it's by looking to
negotiations like those that

00:47:54.039 --> 00:47:55.039
have happened in games like E, that we find
some of the most

00:47:55.039 --> 00:47:56.039
interesting models for how this could take
place because, for a start

00:47:56.039 --> 00:47:57.039
these communities, are totally transnational.
The goods in them are virtual goods.

00:47:57.039 --> 00:47:58.039
But the people are real.
It's a very interesting philosophical set

00:47:58.039 --> 00:47:59.039
of conundrums.
And I'm not sure where it's all going to end,

00:47:59.039 --> 00:48:00.039
but I think it's going to
blow up.

00:48:00.039 --> 00:48:12.510
You know there are going to be -- I think
there's already a couple of

00:48:12.510 --> 00:48:13.510
test cases going on in Asia about who has
the right, rights of sort of

00:48:13.510 --> 00:48:14.510
ownership of virtual goods, virtual characters,
virtual money.

00:48:14.510 --> 00:48:17.811
And people, players, are beginning to assert
that they have some rights

00:48:17.811 --> 00:48:18.811
rather than just saying well, actually, when
push comes to shove, the company owns everything

00:48:18.811 --> 00:48:19.811
and I have no ownership in the nascence at
all.

00:48:19.811 --> 00:48:20.811
&gt;&gt; I'd like to hear some practical examples
of how we would apply the

00:48:20.811 --> 00:48:21.811
learnings that you presented to us to let's
say the UK school system in

00:48:21.811 --> 00:48:22.811
terms of achievements -- [INAUDIBLE] based
on credits.

00:48:22.811 --> 00:48:23.811
TOM CHATFIELD: Nice and easy question to answer.
Let's just pick one example.

00:48:23.811 --> 00:48:24.811
Progress bars.
For instance, I see absolutely no reason why

00:48:24.811 --> 00:48:25.811
 -- why are achievements
great?

00:48:25.811 --> 00:48:26.811
If achievements are being set by the company,
you can do two things

00:48:26.811 --> 00:48:27.811
with achievements, you push people out of
their comfort zones and these

00:48:27.811 --> 00:48:28.811
are sort of a positive way of trying to reach
a certain target, you're

00:48:28.811 --> 00:48:29.811
not being penalized.
You push people out of their comfort zones,

00:48:29.811 --> 00:48:30.811
by saying, you know there's
50 different achievements you can get in your

00:48:30.811 --> 00:48:31.811
math's lesson.
And you know, one of these achievements is

00:48:31.811 --> 00:48:32.811
doing ten different
equations showing you're working, one of these

00:48:32.811 --> 00:48:34.420
achievements, is doing
sort of 25 definite integrations, and you

00:48:34.420 --> 00:48:37.289
can think beyond the comfort zone, and also
you can get people actually to do things,

00:48:37.289 --> 00:48:39.430
and work out that, why what they're doing
is worthwhile rather than just saying this

00:48:39.430 --> 00:48:40.920
is good thing to do.
So you say to them for instance, well, I want

00:48:40.920 --> 00:48:41.920
you to, you know show
your work, show your work while doing this

00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:42.920
or do this in a particular
way.

00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:43.920
And they will do that because they want to
take that particular box and

00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:44.920
then in the process of doing that, they will
 -- as come to a

00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:45.920
realization through doing rather than just
being told why this is a

00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:46.980
worthwhile thing to do.
So what I might say if is at the moment if

00:48:46.980 --> 00:48:49.380
you are looking at marking
people, if you have very little ownership

00:48:49.380 --> 00:48:53.579
or sense of progress, so what
about a system of each person having if you

00:48:53.579 --> 00:48:55.610
like a sort of avatar or
electronic account where they have progress

00:48:55.610 --> 00:48:56.610
bars on a whole selection
of different options for that class.

00:48:56.610 --> 00:48:58.400
They can see where they are, they can see
where they want to be at the

00:48:58.400 --> 00:48:59.550
end, they can see what it would constitute
to tick all the boxes to be

00:48:59.550 --> 00:49:01.049
someone who achieved a GSCE.
They can have all sorts of achievements along

00:49:01.049 --> 00:49:02.049
the way to see their
history.

00:49:02.049 --> 00:49:05.710
It's all on the same scale.
They can see all of their colleagues and friends

00:49:05.710 --> 00:49:06.710
on separate scales.
They can measure where they are.

00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:07.710
They can get side achievements for doing incidental
things.

00:49:07.710 --> 00:49:08.710
You can get bonus achievements.
You can go ahead and do more advanced work.

00:49:08.710 --> 00:49:10.299
You get credit for trying, you get credit
for turning up, you get

00:49:10.299 --> 00:49:12.882
rewarded constantly for doing things.
You can customize it a bit because you've

00:49:12.882 --> 00:49:13.882
got 5 or 6 different things
you do.

00:49:13.882 --> 00:49:14.882
So you might be the kind of person who says,
right, I want to go

00:49:14.882 --> 00:49:15.882
straight for, you know, cubic equations. Straight
there.

00:49:15.882 --> 00:49:16.882
I'm not going to bother with logarithms
I'm going to go and do that.

00:49:16.882 --> 00:49:17.882
Somebody else might say, well, I want to do
some linear equations.

00:49:17.882 --> 00:49:18.882
I just want to do 5O linear equations, and
they get rewarded for doing

00:49:18.882 --> 00:49:19.882
that, too.
Everyone, you know, you can adapt it to be

00:49:19.882 --> 00:49:20.882
a little, to participate in
it.

00:49:20.882 --> 00:49:21.882
So just that use for instance for a more sophisticated,
you know, work

00:49:21.882 --> 00:49:22.882
out the details about progress bars on the
same scales, multiple

00:49:22.882 --> 00:49:23.882
achievements.
I think this sort of thing would be very empowering

00:49:23.882 --> 00:49:24.882
for people and also
it would bring digital media into the classroom

00:49:24.882 --> 00:49:25.882
is another good
way of giving people ownership of the -- of

00:49:25.882 --> 00:49:26.882
the progress they're
making.

00:49:26.882 --> 00:49:27.882
It has very positive connotations for people.
It can be very well marked it can say well

00:49:27.882 --> 00:49:28.882
 -- it can really be
personalized.

00:49:28.882 --> 00:49:29.882
That would be one example.

00:49:29.882 --> 00:49:30.882
&gt;&gt; Just as an immediate reaction to that I
think it's very, very

00:49:30.882 --> 00:49:31.882
interesting but to come back to the earlier
question about World of

00:49:31.882 --> 00:49:32.882
Warcraft [INAUDIBLE], generation of children
to sort of education

00:49:32.882 --> 00:49:33.882
[INAUDIBLE]

00:49:33.882 --> 00:49:34.882
TOM CHATFIELD: But the thing is, aren't people
 -- I'm not -- you would

00:49:34.882 --> 00:49:35.882
have to have a security system on this.
You would have to try to make it immune to

00:49:35.882 --> 00:49:36.882
hacking, but for goodness
sake, look how easy it is to cheat in the

00:49:36.882 --> 00:49:37.882
current educational set up.
I mean, the current examination set up is

00:49:37.882 --> 00:49:38.882
almost in some, practically
defunct, in the case of the advanced math

00:49:38.882 --> 00:49:39.882
technology.
I mean what I'm not -- I'm not saying I have

00:49:39.882 --> 00:49:40.882
a perfect solution, but I
am saying it's, in many ways, it's an awful

00:49:40.882 --> 00:49:41.882
lot better than what we
have now.

00:49:41.882 --> 00:49:42.882
There were headlines recently about the, you
know, some high percentage

00:49:42.882 --> 00:49:43.882
of people cheating on mobile phones that we
know about and accept.

00:49:43.882 --> 00:49:44.882
People -- you could say now better, you know.
It would be a good thing to someone, not into

00:49:44.882 --> 00:49:45.882
a bot driven to go far,
but if someone really wanted to sit there

00:49:45.882 --> 00:49:46.882
and do lots and lots of
linear equations in order to push up their

00:49:46.882 --> 00:49:47.882
achievement score, that's
kind of what you want out of a school.

00:49:47.882 --> 00:49:48.882
And you know, the Nintendo brain training
is not a perfect game, but

00:49:48.882 --> 00:49:49.882
it's a very good example of how some good
design principles can really

00:49:49.882 --> 00:49:50.882
incentivize people, can make them want to
do it more and that's --

00:49:50.882 --> 00:49:51.882
that's very much just a start, I think.
Because I think you need to step away from

00:49:51.882 --> 00:49:52.882
games.
I don't want to create a brain training game

00:49:52.882 --> 00:49:53.882
for history.
I think the principles on the line, which

00:49:53.882 --> 00:49:54.882
are the ones I was trying to
set out, some of those.

00:49:54.882 --> 00:49:55.882
&gt;&gt; Okay we'll have to leave it there.
Thank you very much.

00:49:55.882 --> 00:49:56.882
TOM CHATFIELD: Thank you.

00:49:56.882 --> 00:49:56.883
[APPLAUSE]
