00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.170
Serious injuries and deaths from
accidents in cars have

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:17.440
more than halved over
the last 20 years.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.070
It's not because we've got any
better at driving, it's

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.530
because we've got better
at safety engineering.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.100
Things like seat belts
and air bags.

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.930
Whilst we've got really quite
good at protecting heads in

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.610
accidents, we're getting to a
stage where protection for

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.050
other parts of the body are
starting to lag behind.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.000
In fact, the second most likely
cause of sudden death

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.593
in a car accident is something
called an aortic rupture.

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.710
The aorta is the largest blood
vessel in your body.

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.740
It comes straight out of your
heart and carries oxygenated

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.110
blood up to your brain
and around to the

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.770
rest of your body.

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.270
It sits inside the chest cavity,
in the middle there,

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.380
with the aorta arching out of
the heart and back and down,

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.820
right in front of the
spinal column.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.800
If you're driving along a road
like this, at 60 miles an hour

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.450
like I am, and the car crashes,
it comes to a very

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.440
sudden stop.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.520
And everything in the car has
to come to very sudden stop.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.010
So if you're wearing a seat
belt, that has to put a very

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.670
large force on your chest to
stop your chest moving.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.750
Now, the internal organs, your
heart, your lungs, are still

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:54.970
moving forward.

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.730
And they've got to be stopped.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.100
My heart sitting in my chest,
weighing about 300 grams.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.170
When you have a crash, the
accelerations are enormous,

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.270
probably of the order
of about 70G.

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.919
What that means is the forces
your heart experiences are 70

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:12.400
times normal.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:21.062
So something more like the
weight of 21 kilograms.

00:02:21.062 --> 00:02:22.740
That can do some damage.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.610
But there's something really odd
about aortic ruptures that

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.030
might give us a clue as
to why they happen

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.280
in the first place.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.520
Whether you're in a car
accident, on a motorcycle, or

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.620
even falling out of a high
building, the aorta ruptures

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:47.990
in the same place.

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.900
If you do have an aortic
rupture, with the heart

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.030
beating and pumping blood out
at that sort of rate, it's

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.830
enough to empty your
entire blood volume

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.120
out in about a minute.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.630
And that's the reason why most
aortic ruptures are fatal.

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.970
The place it ruptures is just a
bit where the arch turns the

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.900
corner to a place called
the isthmus, there.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.140
And this is really a
very interesting

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.720
place for that to happen.

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.600
It suggests a hypothesis that
the reason it bursts there is

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.680
because there's a weak
point there.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.280
That corresponds to a feature
of the circulatory system in

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.320
foetuses, where there are a
couple of short circuits

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.810
between the circulation
to the lungs and the

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:29.890
circulation to the body.

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.470
Foetuses don't need to use their
lungs, because they get

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:33.710
the oxygen from the placenta.

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:36.720
So these short circuits divert
the blood back to the body.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.870
One of them is a short tube that
joins the aorta on to the

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.260
artery that comes out of the
heart to the lungs, closes up

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.370
at the moment of birth, but
leaves a small scar, just at

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.870
the point where we find
aortic ruptures occur.

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.783
That's why we have the
hypothesis that the weak point

00:03:53.783 --> 00:03:56.102
in the aorta is located there.

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:04.250
Because the people who die from
aortic ruptures tend to

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.390
be young and healthy, we usually
use young and healthy

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.190
aortas from the butcher.

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.800
But that's a bit messy
for today.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.910
We'll just use a balloon.

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:19.029
To test whether the aorta
ruptures at a weak point, we

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:21.730
took samples of aorta from that
place, and from other

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.810
places, to see if it
really was weaker.

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.025
Now to simulate accident
conditions, we have to do that

00:04:28.025 --> 00:04:30.220
at high strain rates.

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.780
And that's where the experiment
starts to get fun.

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.410
This is how we test a section of
aorta that's clamped across

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:38.910
a hole there.

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:43.330
We can pop it like a bubble with
compressed air that we

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:44.770
let in with this valve.

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.300
And we can measure the pressure
and watch how it

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.790
deforms, so we can quantify
its mechanical properties.

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:01.790
So that's all that's left
of my bit of balloon.

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:05.670
When we did the experiment with
the aortas, we found that

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:08.920
the rupture pressure at the
point where we thought the

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.150
weak point was was just the same
as the rupture pressure

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.970
higher or lower down
the aorta.

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:17.410
So we can't confirm
that hypothesis.

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:18.920
Back to the drawing board.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:23.742
Best you can do at the moment
is just to wear a seat belt.
