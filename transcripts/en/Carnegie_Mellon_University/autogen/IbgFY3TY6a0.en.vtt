my name is Alison Barth I'm a professor
in the Department of Biological Sciences

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720
in the Department of Biological Sciences
 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.260
in the Department of Biological Sciences
there Carnegie Mellon there are millions

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270
there Carnegie Mellon there are millions
 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:07.730
there Carnegie Mellon there are millions
and millions of neurons in the cerebral

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740
and millions of neurons in the cerebral
 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.799
and millions of neurons in the cerebral
cortex that all have specialized

functions and I've become really

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580
functions and I've become really
 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.079
functions and I've become really
interested in how we can take this pool

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089
interested in how we can take this pool
 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.090
interested in how we can take this pool
this enormous pool of neurons and

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100
this enormous pool of neurons and
 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.279
this enormous pool of neurons and
identify what each one of them is doing

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289
identify what each one of them is doing
 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.220
identify what each one of them is doing
and how their activity then enables

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230
and how their activity then enables
 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.679
and how their activity then enables
change between the connections between

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689
change between the connections between
 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.990
change between the connections between
these cells to encode our experience and

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000
these cells to encode our experience and
 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.770
these cells to encode our experience and
to underline learning and memory

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:29.780
to underline learning and memory
 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.360
to underline learning and memory
we've been able to identify different

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:31.370
we've been able to identify different
 

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.670
we've been able to identify different
phases of learning and we've been able

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:33.680
phases of learning and we've been able
 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.560
phases of learning and we've been able
to identify the biochemical and

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570
to identify the biochemical and
 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.150
to identify the biochemical and
molecular correlates of these different

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160
molecular correlates of these different
 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.630
molecular correlates of these different
phases so that we can see right after

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640
phases so that we can see right after
 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.479
phases so that we can see right after
some experience synapses are

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:42.489
some experience synapses are
 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:44.770
some experience synapses are
strengthened but then they enter into

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780
strengthened but then they enter into
 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.540
strengthened but then they enter into
sort of a labile state I think

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550
sort of a labile state I think
 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.189
sort of a labile state I think
understanding these different phases

00:00:48.189 --> 00:00:48.199
understanding these different phases
 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:50.350
understanding these different phases
gives us the opportunity to potentially

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360
gives us the opportunity to potentially
 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.990
gives us the opportunity to potentially
manipulate the conditions of these

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000
manipulate the conditions of these
 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.810
manipulate the conditions of these
different phases to prolong to erase

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820
different phases to prolong to erase
 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.320
different phases to prolong to erase
memory for example or to extend the

00:00:59.320 --> 00:00:59.330
memory for example or to extend the
 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.200
memory for example or to extend the
duration or strengthen memories it's not

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210
duration or strengthen memories it's not
 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:03.910
duration or strengthen memories it's not
just learning and memory there are

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920
just learning and memory there are
 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.960
just learning and memory there are
diseases for example like epilepsy where

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970
diseases for example like epilepsy where
 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.859
diseases for example like epilepsy where
abnormal circuit function becomes

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:10.869
abnormal circuit function becomes
 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:14.260
abnormal circuit function becomes
reinforced through a recurrent abnormal

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270
reinforced through a recurrent abnormal
 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.320
reinforced through a recurrent abnormal
activity and it's very likely that the

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330
activity and it's very likely that the
 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.270
activity and it's very likely that the
work that we're doing will inform some

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280
work that we're doing will inform some
 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.190
work that we're doing will inform some
of those pathological changes that can

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200
of those pathological changes that can
 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.779
of those pathological changes that can
occur in brain function and I think by

00:01:22.779 --> 00:01:22.789
occur in brain function and I think by
 

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:24.070
occur in brain function and I think by
understanding the principles by which

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080
understanding the principles by which
 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.710
understanding the principles by which
circuits are organized we'll actually be

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720
circuits are organized we'll actually be
 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.680
circuits are organized we'll actually be
able to develop and design engineered

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:29.690
able to develop and design engineered
 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.719
able to develop and design engineered
circuits that can carry out some of

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729
circuits that can carry out some of
 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:33.130
circuits that can carry out some of
these functions there's a lot of

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140
these functions there's a lot of
 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.230
these functions there's a lot of
biological insight that I think can help

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240
biological insight that I think can help
 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.230
biological insight that I think can help
computer science and engineering in

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240
computer science and engineering in
 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.330
computer science and engineering in
developing better tools that will

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340
developing better tools that will
 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.170
developing better tools that will
improve our existence as humans we use

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180
improve our existence as humans we use
 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.240
improve our existence as humans we use
the somatosensory cortex of rodents as

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250
the somatosensory cortex of rodents as
 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.340
the somatosensory cortex of rodents as
sort of a platform for understanding how

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350
sort of a platform for understanding how
 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.289

experience can transform neural circuits

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299
experience can transform neural circuits
 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:52.300
experience can transform neural circuits
and so we can use it to ask really

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310
and so we can use it to ask really
 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.789
and so we can use it to ask really
fundamental questions about how memories

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799
fundamental questions about how memories
 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:57.640
fundamental questions about how memories
are encoded in the brain we're using

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:57.650
are encoded in the brain we're using
 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.950
are encoded in the brain we're using
features of our experience of our life

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960
features of our experience of our life
 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.990
features of our experience of our life
experience and they're somehow changing

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000
experience and they're somehow changing
 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.999
experience and they're somehow changing
in some permanent way or very

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009
in some permanent way or very
 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:05.770

brain recently we've become really
 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.509
brain recently we've become really
interested in developing anatomical

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:10.519
interested in developing anatomical
 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:13.140

techniques where which we can classify

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150
techniques where which we can classify
 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.490

types of neurons that occur in the
 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.740
types of neurons that occur in the
cerebral cortex and so we'd like to

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750
cerebral cortex and so we'd like to
 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.050
cerebral cortex and so we'd like to
develop a directory by which we know

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060
develop a directory by which we know
 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.390
develop a directory by which we know
exactly how many contacts there are

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400
exactly how many contacts there are
 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.430
exactly how many contacts there are
between this type of genetically

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440

labeling techniques where pre and
 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.440
labeling techniques where pre and
postsynaptic cells are labeled and then

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450
postsynaptic cells are labeled and then
 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.330
postsynaptic cells are labeled and then
we can count actually in real

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340
we can count actually in real
 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.610
we can count actually in real
the number of contacts between each type

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620
the number of contacts between each type
 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.880
the number of contacts between each type
of cell and then monitor those contacts

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890
of cell and then monitor those contacts
 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.130
of cell and then monitor those contacts
as the animal learns some sort of task

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140
as the animal learns some sort of task
 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.070
as the animal learns some sort of task
so we'd like to be able to dig into the

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080
so we'd like to be able to dig into the
 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.229
so we'd like to be able to dig into the
anatomy instead of looking in general at

anatomy instead of looking in general at
 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.120
anatomy instead of looking in general at
it ask very specific questions about

it ask very specific questions about
 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.430
it ask very specific questions about
who's talking to whom I believe that the
