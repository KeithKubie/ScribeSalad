&gt;&gt; Announcer: From the Library
of Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:24.450
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: So, good afternoon.

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.550
Thank you for joining us here
at our Books and Beyond talk.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.110
I'm Pam Jackson, I'm director for
the Center for the Book and I'd

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:32.840
like to welcome you this
afternoon for a great conversation

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.140
that we're going to have.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.370
Here at the Center for the
Book we care about and intend

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.180
on making a lasting, productive and
phenomenal difference in the world

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.370
of reading, promotion and literacy.

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.900
It's like what we care about,

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.800
what we're focused on,
what matters most to us.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.650
So, we're glad that you're here
to join us in the conversations

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.960
that are ongoing about that.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.500
We are part of the new National,
International Outreach unit

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.640
at the Library of Congress,
whose mission is

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.330
to share the diverse
vast rich collections

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.130
of the library outward and onward.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.960
And as a Center for the Book we
have a number of partnerships

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.820
around the country with reading
promotion partners and a network

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.670
of state centers for the book.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.520
Am I not -- yeah.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.940
Well, I see a green light.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.240
Can you hear me?

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.430
Volume. Let's see.

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.810
I'm surprised I'm not loud enough.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.640
Yep. No, no volume control.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.110 position:56%
So, let me try this, is this better?

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:34.490
Little bit better.

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:35.830
All right, great.

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:41.110 position:56%
So, let me just pick up where I left
off which was, oh, so part of NNIO,

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.100
so, National, International
Outreach at the Library.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.550
We do -- I was starting to say
this, we have a national network

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.760
of state Centers for the Book,
that also include the District

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.740
of Columbia and the University
-- and the US Virgin Islands.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.950
And the Center for the Book
administers the Library Congress

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.200
Literacy Awards Program, which
also has a network of organizations

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.320
that are award winning
for their best practices

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.920
in promoting literacy
around the world.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.390
And we are honored and celebrated
a conference just this last week

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.640
with partners and friends from as
far away as Afghanistan and Brazil

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.810
and New Zealand and
Cambodia, were here to join us

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.220
in a conversation promoting
reading and literacy.

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.640
So, your presence here today
and your viewership online

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.770
of our webcast is an
exciting part and an extension

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.280
of the promotion partners
that we care about,

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.560
that we consider part
of our family in.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.890
So, let me just mention a little
bit about what we're here to talk

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.730
about today, which
is an amazing author,

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.050
who's written about
an amazing woman.

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.530
And before I say a little bit
about more and introduce her I want

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.590
to mention for housekeeping --
a couple housekeeping purposes

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.370 position:56%
and then I'll introduce our speaker,
I mentioned this is a webcast,

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.740
so we're filming for the website.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.880
If you do participate in the
question and answer portion

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.290
of our program you will
be recorded and on tape,

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.110
so we're just giving you
the awareness of that.

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.810
We ask you to take a moment
and just check your devices,

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.940
your mobile devices that
the ringers are off,

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.650
so that we won't have disruption.

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.610
And another piece -- and
disrupt the webcasting.

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:33.760
Our taping of this author talk
is one of more than 250 we have

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.090
that are online and
available at read.gov.

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.790
We invite you to visit
that site as well.

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.020
With that being said,
let me actually talk

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.170
about our author and
our topic today.

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.550
So, the criteria for our
Books and Beyond talks is

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.540
that we are celebrating books
and authors who've done research

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.180
in the Library of Congress
collections or they're writing

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.500
about the Library of Congress.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.350
And today's author
has done just that.

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.290
Louisa Thomas is here to
discuss her book, the --

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.430
Louisa, The Extraordinary
Life of Mrs. Adams.

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.270 position:56%
And it's an interesting piece that's
a very comprehensive biography

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:13.020 position:56%
of our own -- only, as I understand,
first born foreign born first lady.

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:17.590
Louisa Thomas is the author
has done a number of projects.

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.320
She's a journalist and an editor
and the author of "Conscience,

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.050
Two Soldiers, Two Pacifists,
One Family.

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.410
A test of will and
faith in World War I."

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.880
She is had her writings appear
in the New York Times, Vogue,

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.380
The Paris Review and elsewhere.

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.700
She's a contributor
to the New Yorker.

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.400
And what she's written
about is an interesting

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:45.010
and dynamic woman who's made a real
mark in the fabric of our nation.

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.810
And I consider our
author, herself, the same.

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:49.610
So, let's welcome Louisa Thomas.

00:04:49.610 --> 00:05:00.370
[ Applause ]

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:01.670
&gt;&gt; Louisa Thomas: Thank you so much

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:04.410
for that introduction
and for having me here.

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:09.600 position:56%
It's an honor to be here, especially
considering Louisa Katherine Adams

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:14.440
connection to this city and
to this spot in particular.

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.990 position:56%
As I drove here I thought of what
Louisa must have seen when she drove

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:24.250
to Washington for the first
time, shortly after landing

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:29.430
in the United States in
1801 at the age of 26.

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.240
Her stage drove down
dusty turnpikes,

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:37.600
past a few scattered clusters of
dwellings, amid broken plaster.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.900
The kilns from the construction
yet to be disassembled.

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:45.510
When she past the capital
it was very an idea.

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:47.850
Still headless without its dome.

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:50.470
There were cows and birds,

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:55.020
half built sandstone buildings
already beginning to crumble.

00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:01.630
Tree stumps threaded the way, which
caused danger to her carriage.

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:07.870
"The area," she later wrote, "was
a scene of utter desolation."

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:11.190
It would become the place where
she found her greatest successes

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:14.000
and her most painful setbacks.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.590 position:56%
It would be the city where she
chose to live out her days and died,

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:20.350
home, such as she had one.

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:23.760
But it would take her a long
time to get to that place.

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.600
Her relationship to the
United States was as fraught

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:30.070
as the new nation's
relationship to itself.

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:34.420
She was born in London to a British
mother and an American father

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:39.280
and at the age of 9 in 1784,
just months after the revolution,

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.850
she was made a citizen of Maryland,

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:45.030
but that didn't mean
much to her then.

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:48.510
By the time she reached the
United States she'd already lived

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:50.490
in France and Prussia.

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:53.350
She crossed an ocean and mountains.

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:58.380 position:56%
She'd already seen many things few
people over time could even imagine.

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:04.550
But her new home was to her the
strangest place she'd ever been.

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:08.940
"Quincy, what should I say
of my impressions of Quincy?"

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:11.480
she later wrote of her arrival.

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:15.370
"Had I stepped onto Noah's
Ark I could not have been more

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:18.170
utterly astonished."

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:21.590
Her introduction was
not exactly auspicious.

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:25.860
Abigail Adams, who once called
her a siren, found her frail

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:28.850
and vaguely foreign, a fine lady,

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:31.990
which was not something a good
New England housewife was supposed

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:33.290
to be.

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:36.520
For her part Louisa was
at first intimidated

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:40.600
by her resolutely cheerful
and industrious mother-in-law.

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:45.220
Bewildered by the local customs
and overwhelmed by her new duties,

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:47.450
she'd later say, "Where
was I supposed

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:49.800
to have learned to milk a cow?

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:52.270
At the card table in
the Prussian Court?"

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:56.860
As it happened, being a fine
lady with a canny political

00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:00.380
and intelligence would help
her immensely in Washington

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:02.340
and the diplomatic world.

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:04.110
If not in the barnyard.

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:09.470 position:56%
But the truth was, and I really want
to emphasize this, she was frail

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:14.100
and she was insecure and
she was far stronger though

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:17.710
and more resourceful
than she first appeared.

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:19.800
Let me tell you another
story about her.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:26.110
In 1814 at a small post station 12
miles outside of St. Petersburg,

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:28.530
Louisa said goodbye to
her husband, John Quincy,

00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:31.470
not knowing when she
would see him again.

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:32.870
There were tears on her cheek,

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:35.610
cheers of distress,
as well as grief.

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:38.510
John Quinsy was living Russia
to negotiate the treaty

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:40.790
that would end the war of 1812.

00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:44.860
And leaving Louisa alone with
her 7 year old son Charles,

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:46.950
in a ruinously expensive city

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:50.900
where she did not speak the
language and had few friends.

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:53.270
She'd just lost a much
loved daughter

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:57.430
and she'd not seen her other
two young sons for 5 years.

00:08:57.430 --> 00:08:58.930
Now, she was on her own.

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:00.380
It would have been hard for anyone,

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:02.910
but for Louisa the prospect
was really daunting.

00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:06.890
Even in the best of times
Louisa often doubted herself.

00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:08.680
She described herself as timid.

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:10.990
She called one of her
unpublished memoirs

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:13.120
"The Adventures of a Nobody."

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:15.780
Another was just, "The
Record of a Life."

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:19.770
At the end of the year John Quincy
wrote to Louisa and told her

00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:23.630
to pack their things or sell
them and meet him in Paris.

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:24.930
No problem.

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:28.680
The trip was nearly 2000 miles
over the half thawed land,

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:31.860
devastated by the Napoleonic wars.

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:35.320
She and her tiny son,
armed with his toy sword,

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:37.890
were on the road for 40 days.

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:41.950
And in that time she was
robbed, warned not to continue,

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:44.620
told that one of her two
male servants, whom she hired

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:47.130
to protect her, had
a local reputation

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:50.210
as a quote, desperate villain."

00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:54.140
She traveled over half
burnt, half empty villages,

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:56.810
over battlefields still
strewn with wreckage.

00:09:56.810 --> 00:10:01.190
She listened to women tell her
stories of rampage and rape.

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:05.550
Halfway through she learned that
the man behind all this, Napoleon,

00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:10.840
had escaped Alba and was
heading, as she was, toward Paris.

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:13.370
Men were mustering,
readying for war.

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:15.750
Her male servants fled in fear.

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:19.590
She, on the other hand,
pretended to be Napoleon's sister.

00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:23.010
At one point her carriage
was surrounded by soldiers.

00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:24.770
"Tear them out of the
carriage," they cried.

00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:26.310
"Kill them."

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:29.260
It was in French, a language
she could understand.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:30.940
"Long live Napoleon," she yelled,

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:33.670
and waved her handkerchief,
"Long live."

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:37.340
That was all in French,
but I'm not going to try.

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:38.880
She went on.

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:40.980
What was so remarkable to me

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:44.970
about that journey is not
only how daring it was.

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:48.170
It's also what she made
of it later in her life.

00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:51.440
20 years later she wrote
and account of that trip.

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:54.690
She understood that it
was not only a good story,

00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:59.190
but something that she could use
to illustrate something of herself.

00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:04.850
Something of her fortitude,
her curiosity, her resiliency,

00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:08.740
something of herself and
it was something she wrote

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:12.810
that she could use to
show what women could do.

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:19.540
She wanted to show there were not
-- I think her phrase was, "The --

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:21.870
struck by the imbecility that" --

00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:25.430
something about the public was
always fancying women to have.

00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:29.350
But she also wanted to show
that she was one who was.

00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:33.230
Those were her words
and she underlined them.

00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:36.930
That suggests that in her darker
moments she thought she would

00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:38.710
be forgotten.

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:40.910
And for a long time she was.

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:42.390
When she was mentioned in accounts

00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:45.360
of her more famous
relatives she was a footnote,

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:48.550
half dismissed as sickly and sad.

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:49.940
Some knew better.

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:53.000
John Adams called her
journals, which she sent to him,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.550
unnecessary of life to me.

00:11:55.550 --> 00:12:00.020
Her grandson, the great historian,
Henry Adams, was fascinated by her

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:02.570
and thought he might
publish some of her papers.

00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:05.510
He copied hundreds of
pages and is possible

00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:07.680
to see their influence
in his own work.

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:12.320
The first editor of the Adam's
papers, Lyman C. Butterfield,

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:15.000
once wrote, "In the entire span

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.940
of the Adam's dynasty no figure
is more central than the wife

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:22.220
of the second Adam's statesman,

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:26.650
and yet none is less
known or more elusive."

00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:30.920
She was unknown because for
two centuries she was thought

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:33.750
to exist outside the
bounds of history.

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:36.430
Those chronicles of deeds and men.

00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:41.400 position:56%
She was elusive too, because she was
contradictory about her importance,

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:45.470
and her family's background,
denied her worth

00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:49.010
and was quick to describe
her doubts.

00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:53.040
Her character was quicksilver and
the roles she held were unofficial.

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:57.230
She was an American who was foreign
born, a first lady in a country

00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:59.730
that was not quite
her own and a mother

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:02.730
who out lived all but
one of her children.

00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:05.930
She was torn between cultural
ideals and strong instincts

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:08.080
that she could not ignore.

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:11.480 position:56%
The idea that a woman should wonder
about her independent identity apart

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:13.610
from her husbands,
apart from her sons,

00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:17.760
apart from her family was
hardly prevalent or desirable

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:19.810
in the tine in which she lived.

00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:21.110
It could be painful.

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:24.000
But there was also a
kind of freedom in it.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.970
The other members of the Adam's
family took their identity

00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:29.300
and their duty for granted.

00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:31.750
Facebook for the ages.

00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:34.130
She could speak for herself.

00:13:34.130 --> 00:13:36.950
It became her habit,
even her strategy

00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:40.040
to define herself as
not like the Adams's.

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:43.910
And, yet, in some larger sense,
the Adams family helped instill

00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:47.450
in Louisa what it helped
instill in the young Republic.

00:13:47.450 --> 00:13:50.020
A concern for the value
of the individual,

00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:54.420
a fascination with human nature
in its various forms and awareness

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:59.360
of selfish instincts, a suspicion
of power, a respect for traditions

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:03.550
and a willingness to scrutinize
people, especially ones self.

00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:07.010
And it was in the letters she
exchanged with the Adams family

00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:09.220
where she found her voice.

00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:11.660
It was her voice that
first struck me.

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:17.340 position:56%
As I read her letters I thought to
myself, "Who was this other Louisa?"

00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:21.000
They were vivid, propulsive,
urgent, often hilarious.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.470 position:56%
She had an eye for the pompous
general, the charismatic politician,

00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:29.430
the dynamics of Washington life,
of the battles in the capital

00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:31.860
and in the parlor where
she once wrote,

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:35.390
"Ladies wars are always
fierce and hot."

00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:39.290
There was nothing settled, nothing
cast in marbled or enshrined

00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:44.670
in posterity about the people she
met and the events she witnessed.

00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:46.770
She witnessed so much.

00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:51.020
When John Quincy died some said in
his life once could find history

00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:53.590 position:56%
of the country's first half century.

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:55.770
Something like that
could be said of her.

00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:58.840
She was born only months before
the start of the revolution.

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:00.410
The year she first arrived

00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:03.310
in the United States federal
power passed peacefully

00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:09.020
from the opposition, her
father-in-law, for the first time.

00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:10.500
On the day that her daughter died

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:14.090
in St. Petersburg,
Moscow was set on fire.

00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:17.590
When she died the United States
were only a few years away

00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:19.130
from Civil War.

00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:23.230
Part of the pleasure of writing
the book was seeing these events

00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:26.500
through her amazing gimlet eyes.

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:30.250
She was born in 1775 in London.

00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:35.130
Her father was a classic
crafty merchant

00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:40.060
and her mother was vivacious,
charming, socially ambitious.

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:41.880
Her parents had secrets.

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:44.620
Some of which Louisa
may have sensed.

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:47.260
She spent the American
Revolution as a young child living

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:51.990 position:56%
in a luxurious mansion in France and
when the war was over she returned

00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:55.180
to London where she was
taught to be a lovely ornament

00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:57.710
in the language of the day.

00:15:57.710 --> 00:16:00.400
For the most part Louisa
was raised as young, pretty,

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:03.200
wealthy English girls were
raised, only she was told

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:08.340 position:56%
to consider herself an American and
much more importantly, to marry one.

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:11.290
Her relationship with John
Quincy is central to this book.

00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:15.440 position:56%
It was sometimes passionate,
sometimes tender, sometimes fraught,

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:16.740
beginning with their courtship.

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:21.540
In 1798, when they wed, he made
it clear that he was committed

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:25.890
to his country and in marrying
her he was committing her too.

00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:29.360
She tried it once to
reform and resisted.

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:31.930
After their wedding she and
John Quincy went to Berlin

00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:34.710
where he was tasked with
negotiating a treaty

00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:38.350
and she was negotiating a royal
court, representing a republic

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:40.640
who had never been in a republic.

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:45.680
When she reached the United States,
with its democratic pretentions,

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:48.900
she would find that navigating this
country was much more difficult

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:51.410
than learning how to
dance with the king.

00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:54.050
It was harder because there
was no room to settle.

00:16:54.050 --> 00:16:58.990 position:56%
She lived in London, France, Berlin,
Russia, Washington, Boston, Quincy,

00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:00.890
and travelled extensively.

00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:05.930
She spent time in apartments,
hotels, houses, docas, cottages,

00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:10.810
the White House, there were ships,
carriages, sleds, coaches, trains,

00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:13.890
steamboats, it might
not be too much to say

00:17:13.890 --> 00:17:18.340
that for long stretches she
lived in traveling cases.

00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:21.200
She often felt that
she didn't belong.

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:23.760
This makes it easy and a
little tempting to dwell

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:26.130
on what makes her elusive.

00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:29.680
But Mr. Butterfield was right
also to call her central.

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:31.230
She was a force.

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:32.980
Witty and charming and critical

00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:36.060
to her husband's diplomatic
and political efforts.

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:39.090
Abroad she won favor
with kings and queens.

00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:42.630
At home she sparred and bantered
with leading politicians.

00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:45.790
She presided over weekly dinners
for senators and cabinet members

00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:50.050
and dignitaries, giving them
the cover to talk politics

00:17:50.050 --> 00:17:52.970
when politics were a dirty word.

00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:55.430
She set up a kind of
campaign headquarters

00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:57.950
in her parlor one summer
in Philadelphia.

00:17:57.950 --> 00:18:01.260
And she had a series of
weekly parties called,

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:05.300
Tuesdays at Mrs. Adams, that made
her the dominate social figure

00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:07.520
in Washington.

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:11.210 position:56%
On the morning before one of these
parties, one of the biggest parties,

00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:15.200
the newspapers all ran a
poem, every stanza ended ,

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:17.380
"All are gone to Mrs. Adams."

00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:20.460
Her party was actually a pretty
brilliant political maneuver

00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:23.620
in siphoning some of the
tension away from Andrew Jackson,

00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:27.250 position:56%
who had become the leading candidate
while her husband's fortunes

00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:28.550
were lagging.

00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:31.270
And it was actually
delightful downstairs

00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:36.090
in the manuscript room there are
in several collections from people

00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:39.610
of that time, there are copies
of the original invitation

00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:42.080
for that event, which
was fun to find.

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:45.970
That was in 1824.

00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:52.910
It was -- and it's also striking
that so many people saved it.

00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:58.760
It was her campaign in
some ways more than his.

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:03.880
At a time of rising popular
sentiment and turmoil

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:07.010
within the political
establishment she understood

00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:10.920
that people are governed by
emotions, as much as laws

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:13.600
and that politics are about people.

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:15.830
Their little passions
and prejudices,

00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:18.280
their feelings of want and hope.

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:22.590
John Quincy did everything he
could to hide his feelings.

00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:26.220
He even refused to campaign for the
presidency, because he did not want

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:28.210
to appear to beg for votes.

00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:32.180
He lashed himself in his diary
for his failings, but outwardly,

00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:36.200
as a son, Charles wrote,
"He wore an iron mask."

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:40.320
She understood something else,
a lesson painfully learned,

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:43.040
ambition could have terrible costs.

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:45.300
At just the moment John
Quincy came into the power

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:48.300
of the presidency she
felt most powerless.

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:51.790
She was isolated, felt
alone, they fought.

00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:55.590
The children struggled, their
family began to fall apart.

00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:58.780 position:56%
When she and her husband returned
to Quincy she believed that had come

00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:01.850
to live out their days
exhausted and grieving,

00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:03.920 position:56%
self-questioning, self-flagellating.

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:07.560
She thought she sacrificed
much too much.

00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:10.600
But she was resilient and,
in fact, the Adams last

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:12.990
and greatest act had just begun.

00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:15.960
When her husband became one of the
first great anti-slavery leaders

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:18.700
in Congress she wrestled
with what it meant

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:21.650
to be a woman, a wife, a self.

00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:25.060
She thought about how to
have faith, what's so fine,

00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:27.100
what to live for and why?

00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:32.900 position:56%
As fantastic as her adventures were,
the real story is of her inner life.

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:35.750
Her biography cannot be
told like her husbands.

00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:38.960
It is a history of
feelings, as well as facts.

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:41.390
Of questions, as well as answers.

00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:43.830
Of doubt, as well as certainty.

00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:45.840
It is a record of a life.

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:49.110
It is a narrative of a journey
and it is the adventures,

00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:52.450
not of a nobody, but of
an extraordinary woman.

00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:55.510
And I would be happy to answer
any questions you all might have.

00:20:55.510 --> 00:21:04.240
[ Applause ]

&gt;&gt; Audience Member: I wondered, what
kind of education did she receive

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:15.890
over in -- [inaudible] tutors
or something like that.

00:21:15.890 --> 00:21:19.420
But, [inaudible] to hold
her own against the Adams.

00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:21.950
She must have received
deplorable education.

00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:23.250
&gt;&gt; Louisa Thomas: Well,
it's interesting,

00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:24.550
this is actually something --

00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:26.420
the questions about what kind
of education she received.

00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:28.420
And this is something
that preoccupied her,

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:30.190
because she felt the
gulf in learning

00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:32.850
between her and her husband.

00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:38.210
She went to a boarding school
outside of London until she was 14.

00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:42.030 position:56%
Which was lead by a woman,
Elizabeth Carter, was very well read

00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:45.860
and she had a very -- a couple
of very unusual teachers.

00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:51.030
One of them was a woman who
she later described in one

00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:53.980
of her memoirs as dressing
like a man, actually,

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:57.860
and who had received a
formal, classical education

00:21:57.860 --> 00:21:59.630
as if she had been a boy.

00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:02.820
She knew Greek and Latin
and introduced her to Milton

00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:09.860
and Shakespeare and she, you know,
she was, Louisa was very proud

00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:11.730
of the fact that when her
father gave her a shilling

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:17.370
when she was 11 she used it to
buy a Paradise Lost and a treaties

00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:22.070
for self-knowledge, which was
a popular book at the time.

00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:26.830
And, you know, and her letters
are just sprinkled with references

00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:31.310
to Alexander Pope and, you
know, she was a great reader.

00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:35.990
She also had another teacher
who was not her formal teacher,

00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:41.780
but a reverend named John Hewitt,
who was actually a leading figure

00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:46.350
in some of the countercultural
circles in London interestingly.

00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:51.540
He was a very good friend
of people like John Keats,

00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:58.360
he was actually the one that
mentored Mary Wollstonecraft,

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:02.520
and actually took Mary
Wollstonecraft's first book,

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:08.430
which was about the education of
young women, to his own publisher,

00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:10.740
also by the name of
Johnson actually.

00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:13.980
And got that published.

00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:17.350
And he would later become
actually the Minister to the --

00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:19.880
to some -- one of the royal family.

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:25.630
But and Louisa spent a lot of
time with him as a young girl

00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:28.310
and she later wrote that he --

00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:30.940
her quote was, "He
taught me early to think."

00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:36.540
And that was actually pretty
unusual for a woman in that time.

00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:39.240
In fact, Mary Wollstonecraft's
whole revolutionary idea was

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:40.940
that girls should be
taught to think.

00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:42.770
This is like really
considered radicalism.

00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:45.660
Feminist radicalism at the time.

00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:47.420
Not obviously those
words were not used.

00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:54.800 position:56%
But that actually went into
abeyance once she got out of school,

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:57.040
mostly for financial reasons.

00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:01.350
You know, she had a pretty
sad education, you know,

00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:05.790
being taught to dance and
embroider and get married,

00:24:05.790 --> 00:24:07.930
essentially and run a house.

00:24:07.930 --> 00:24:10.610
And when she met John Quincy
she actually asked him

00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:12.250
for a reading list.

00:24:12.250 --> 00:24:15.860
She said, "I want to
close the gap between us."

00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:20.650
And he laughed at her and that
was actually painful for her.

00:24:20.650 --> 00:24:22.740
And he kind of criticized
her reading and that was --

00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:25.900
I mean, that was one of
the issues between them.

00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:29.490
Later on she would
just devour books.

00:24:29.490 --> 00:24:32.460
And she wrote about them
sometimes, you know, Maria --

00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:34.360
some of them are people we
don't know anymore, like,

00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:36.420
Maria Edgeworth was very popular.

00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:39.720
Some of them we do,
like Sir Walter Scott.

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:43.090
But, you know, she wrote
about, on several occasions,

00:24:43.090 --> 00:24:48.480
she wrote about Lady Macbeth, you
know, sort of interesting people.

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:54.580
Hamlet, she wrote about her reading
and she tried to teach herself,

00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:57.330
especially when her -- this
is much too long an answer,

00:24:57.330 --> 00:25:00.370
but when her kids went to
college, went to Harvard,

00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:03.880
she decided to sort of
study alongside them.

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:07.680
She tried to learn Latin,
she translated Plato --

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:10.650
Socrates, "Apology," from
the French, not the Greek.

00:25:10.650 --> 00:25:13.180
But she was sending these
things to John Adams

00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:14.820
and he was sort of,
"What are you doing?"

00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:19.470
But it shows, it reflects
her real desire to learn.

00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:22.230
Something that was apparent,
I think, as a young child

00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:26.220
and then kind of re-flowered
in middle age.

00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:27.520
Yeah.

00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:28.820
&gt;&gt; Audience Member: I was curious.

00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:34.860
What prompted your interest
to write about Louisa Adams?

00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:38.410
&gt;&gt; Louisa Thomas: Well, I read some
of her letters while doing research

00:25:38.410 --> 00:25:44.580 position:56%
for someone else on a book and that,
you know, as I mentioned in my talk,

00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:47.400
her voice was just totally unusual.

00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:51.660
It was unlike any of the
other people I had read.

00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:55.510
Especially a lot of the men, you
know, these kind of historical,

00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:57.000
you know, Madison and Jeffersons.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.190 position:56%
They knew that they were writing for
their future biographers, you know,

00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:02.790
they carefully copied their
letters, they, you know,

00:26:02.790 --> 00:26:05.450
kind of left us well organized.

00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:11.090
Archives are, messy archives, but
they left us things for posterity.

00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:13.030
And her husband did the same.

00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:14.700
She did not do that, you know.

00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:18.140
Half her letters said, "Burn
this," at the bottom, you know.

00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:23.150
But she was really kind of writing
for herself and for the people

00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:25.960
that she was communicating with.

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:29.200
And there was a kind of
freedom to, not only her voice,

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:33.330 position:56%
but also her observations, which was
absent in a lot of the things I saw.

00:26:33.330 --> 00:26:36.090
And, so, it was so
exciting, actually,

00:26:36.090 --> 00:26:39.750
to kind of encounter this
incredible human, you know,

00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:46.820 position:56%
and it's what can sometimes be sort
of, you know, calcified by myth and,

00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:51.150
you know, even by the best
kind of research, you know,

00:26:51.150 --> 00:26:53.950
somewhat distant, you know.

00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:57.980
Her voice was like in her ear and
I couldn't really get rid of it.

00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:02.340
And it actually I read
those letters in 2008.

00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:06.590
So, that gives you some sense of
how I just couldn't shake them.

00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:07.890
Yep.

00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:09.240
&gt;&gt; Audience Member: Could
you talk a little bit

00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:12.510
about her relationship
about John Adams?

00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:15.100
[ Inaudible question ]

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:16.400
&gt;&gt; Louisa Thomas: Sure.

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:18.800
That was -- her -- the
question's about her relationship

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:21.400
with John Adams, her father-in-law.

00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:23.090
And that was extremely close.

00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:27.410 position:56%
She had a much more complicated and
difficult relationship with Abigail,

00:27:27.410 --> 00:27:30.690
but John was, as she wrote,

00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:36.250
"A friend from the first
time, instant they met."

00:27:36.250 --> 00:27:37.550
And he loved her.

00:27:37.550 --> 00:27:40.520
He once said that marrying
Louisa was the best thing.

00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:43.280
He told someone else that marrying
Louisa was the best thing John

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:44.580
Quincy had ever done.

00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:48.870
This was actually when
he was president, so.

00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:54.300
Yeah, I mean, they -- Louisa
had been sending Abigail kind

00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:57.440
of diary letters, which was
pretty common at the time

00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:00.050
and when Abigail died
she stopped writing

00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:02.090
and like three weeks
later a letter arrives

00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:04.310
from John Adams saying,
"Where are my letters?"

00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:09.110
So, she picked it up and they had
a really wonderful correspondence

00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:12.190
and she sort of stepped into
the role that John Adams seemed

00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:14.620
to have wanted of the, you know,

00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:18.810
strong intelligent woman whom
he could talk about everything

00:28:18.810 --> 00:28:22.120
from politics to, you know,

00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:25.090
what birds were chirping
outside his window.

00:28:25.090 --> 00:28:28.320
Yeah, I know they had a wonderful

00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:31.440
and warm relationship
through until he died.

00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:32.740
Yep.

00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:36.760
&gt;&gt; Audience Member: When Dolly
Madison died there was a great

00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:38.060
[inaudible] outpouring of grief.

00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:43.540
What kind of reaction in
the nation when Louisa died?

00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:44.840 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Louisa Thomas: It was actually --

00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:46.480
the question is about what
happened when Louisa died.

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:53.460
And it was actually the first time
that both the House and Senate shut

00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:58.140
down for her as a mark of
respect and to attend her funeral.

00:28:58.140 --> 00:29:01.220
That was the first time that
had been done for a woman.

00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:07.480
Her pallbearers were all the kind
of leading figures of the day.

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:13.090
And there was a great, you know,
the whole thing, parade, you know,

00:29:13.090 --> 00:29:16.240
thunder, you know, cannons.

00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:21.800
It's actually really interesting,
Charles Adams writes in his diary

00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:24.620
about that day, about the funeral.

00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:29.700 position:56%
I don't know if there was the same
kind of public outpouring, you know,

00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:33.010
outside of Washington for Louisa.

00:29:33.010 --> 00:29:35.510 position:56%
I think in some ways Louisa was more

00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:37.680
of a controversial
figure than Dolly Madison.

00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:39.370
I know that is true.

00:29:39.370 --> 00:29:41.490
"Everybody loved Dolly",
as Louisa like to say,

00:29:41.490 --> 00:29:44.580
with a somewhat fake
smile on her face.

00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:46.650
Just as Dolly once wrote of her,

00:29:46.650 --> 00:29:49.910
"I hear Mrs. Adams is
keeping up the dissipations."

00:29:49.910 --> 00:29:53.730
As if Dolly hadn't been
quite the hostess herself.

00:29:53.730 --> 00:30:04.090
So, the -- but, yeah, she was
loved by those who knew her,

00:30:04.090 --> 00:30:07.690
but she had not been quite
as formidable a first lady.

00:30:07.690 --> 00:30:13.430 position:56%
She was more a social force before
and after John Quincy was president,

00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:17.380
but not during the presidency.

00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:21.280
But Charles wrote about
that day and, you know,

00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:24.680
how overwhelming it had
been and how he was --

00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:26.190
he had wanted something
actually private.

00:30:26.190 --> 00:30:29.820
He'd originally thought maybe her
pallbearers should just be members

00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:32.670
of the family and things like
that, and then he realized he had

00:30:32.670 --> 00:30:35.710
to include all these people.

00:30:35.710 --> 00:30:39.110
But the most striking
thing is that he wrote

00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:43.760
about being amidst this
incredible public, you know,

00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:45.730
big celebration of
his mother's life.

00:30:45.730 --> 00:30:48.110
He said, you know, "I've
never felt more alone."

00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:51.200
You know, just, it
was incredibly moving.

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:53.510
Yes.

00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:56.160
&gt;&gt; Audience Member: I've forgotten
my history, was John Adams --

00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:59.890
or John Quincy Adams,
was he a [inaudible]?

00:30:59.890 --> 00:31:02.790
&gt;&gt; Louisa Thomas: Well, it's not
-- yeah, I'm going to say yes.

00:31:02.790 --> 00:31:05.460
He was technically not the
rank of the ambassador,

00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:07.130
we didn't have an ambassador
in those days.

00:31:07.130 --> 00:31:09.690
He was Minister of
Planet Potentiary.

00:31:09.690 --> 00:31:12.390
But we can call it ambassador.

00:31:12.390 --> 00:31:14.080
Yes.

00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:16.300
&gt;&gt; Audience Member:
Her religious life?

00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:18.570
&gt;&gt; Louisa Thomas: Very
incredibly important to her

00:31:18.570 --> 00:31:23.060
and increasingly so
as she grew older.

00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:25.830
She was -- the question is
about her religious life.

00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:28.050
And she was, I would say,

00:31:28.050 --> 00:31:31.050
idiosyncratic in her
religious beliefs.

00:31:31.050 --> 00:31:32.920
As she put it late in her life,

00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:36.820
"I'm not so sure some people
don't think I'm heretic."

00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:42.600
You know, she had gone to a convent
school when she was in France

00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:45.330
and really was always
drawn to the --

00:31:45.330 --> 00:31:50.190
and then had been an
Anglican growing up in London

00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:52.990
and was always drawn
to the kind of ceremony

00:31:52.990 --> 00:31:55.350
of the Roman Catholic Church.

00:31:55.350 --> 00:32:00.300
She was never a Catholic, but she
was definitely more Episcopalian

00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:03.340
than the Adams family was.

00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:06.170
She did not like the snuffling

00:32:06.170 --> 00:32:09.510
and note singing and,
you know, meetings.

00:32:09.510 --> 00:32:12.030
She thought the fact that they
called the church service meetings

00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:13.470
was terrible.

00:32:13.470 --> 00:32:18.640
So, but she was sort of also
attended any service, you know.

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:24.630 position:56%
When she was in Russia she was
going to Te Deum, you know, she was,

00:32:24.630 --> 00:32:27.060
you know, she sort of saw it all.

00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:34.500
And she became very very religious,
especially she had a lot of tragedy

00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:40.140
in her life and when she was
older she wrote a lot about god.

00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:44.690
I mean, she really almost, like,
would flip a switch, you know,

00:32:44.690 --> 00:32:47.780
and start talking about
God and suffering

00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:49.490
in kind of religious terms.

00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:52.640
And I actually didn't really
understand some of her letters

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:57.820
until I was reading the psalms and
I realized that she was really kind

00:32:57.820 --> 00:33:04.180
of borrowing a lot from some of
that metaphors and the language.

00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:06.480
Yeah.

00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:09.610
&gt;&gt; Louisa Thomas: Yeah?

00:33:09.610 --> 00:33:11.380
&gt;&gt; Audience Member: Can you say
something more about the sources.

00:33:11.380 --> 00:33:14.680
Are the letters here
or the Adams papers.

00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:15.980
&gt;&gt; Louisa Thomas: Both.

00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:20.320
I mean, the Adams papers in the
Mass Historical Society are --

00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:22.590
would be this immense collection.

00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:25.380
It's like 608 -- that might
not be the exact number,

00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:29.500
but something like that -- reels
of microfilm, but there is a set

00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:31.190
of that microfilm downstairs.

00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:38.750
There's I think like 50 or
so of them around the world.

00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:43.060
And they've also done a really
wonderful job of digitizing,

00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:44.450
you know, most of their collection,

00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:48.110
so all of John Quincy's diary
is not searchable online,

00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:49.880
but searchable by date.

00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:51.990
Which is amazing.

00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:57.050
And then downstairs there's a
smaller Adams collection of papers.

00:33:57.050 --> 00:34:00.200
And then there are also, you
know, she's friends with people

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:04.610
like the Thorntons, who was a
great architect at the time,

00:34:04.610 --> 00:34:05.910
so they have collections.

00:34:05.910 --> 00:34:10.950
Or Margaret Bayard Smith, I
think her papers are here.

00:34:10.950 --> 00:34:15.780
Yeah. And, so, there's a lot of
like ancillary material here,

00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:20.460
as well as some original
stuff downstairs.

00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:23.340
Then, you know, you come across
things -- I mean, I was --

00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:26.830
I had such a kind of
an amazing experience

00:34:26.830 --> 00:34:30.640
at the Mass Historical Society
keeps a basically a database

00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:33.570
of every Adams letter ever written

00:34:33.570 --> 00:34:36.310
and it's coded by place
and everything.

00:34:36.310 --> 00:34:39.930
And I came across a huge trove
that were not in that database

00:34:39.930 --> 00:34:43.670
at the Historical Society in
Pennsylvania, because it was in --

00:34:43.670 --> 00:34:46.010
she was very good friends
with someone

00:34:46.010 --> 00:34:49.650
who later became a
Supreme Court Justice

00:34:49.650 --> 00:34:52.660
and so it was a man
of some important.

00:34:52.660 --> 00:34:57.760
And his papers were there
and there was a box marked --

00:34:57.760 --> 00:34:59.970
that was called, "Letters
from Ladies."

00:34:59.970 --> 00:35:02.160
And it had obviously not been
open since they were put in.

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:05.000
and there was just
this pile of letters

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:09.220
from Louisa Katherine
Adams right in there, so.

00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:10.680
Yeah. Yep.

00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:14.050
&gt;&gt; Audience Member: If you
were ever in a position

00:35:14.050 --> 00:35:17.460
to actually interview her
personally, what would be a couple

00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:19.350
of the questions you would ask her?

00:35:19.350 --> 00:35:21.000
&gt;&gt; Louisa Thomas: That's not a
question I've ever gotten before,

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:24.580
so I'm not prepared
for this question.

00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:26.970
But, I guess I would --

00:35:30.250 --> 00:35:32.230
I'm not so sure, you
know, I'm not always --

00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:36.380
I'm convinced that she's the most
reliable narrator of her own life,

00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:39.480
so it would be interesting
to hear what she would say

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:41.470
on any number of subjects.

00:35:41.470 --> 00:35:48.110
But, I think I would as her --
there were certain things I wanted

00:35:48.110 --> 00:35:49.580
to know if she knew, you know?

00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:54.040
I wanted to know if she
knew more about her mother

00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:57.380
than she let on or her parents.

00:35:57.380 --> 00:36:03.520
Because I think that does actually
change the story a little bit,

00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:04.820
you know?

00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:06.120
&gt;&gt; Audience Member: Why?

00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:10.180
&gt;&gt; Louisa Thomas: Well, her parents
weren't married when she was born

00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:13.940
and it's unclear whether
or not she knew that.

00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:18.610 position:56%
That actually became -- that was
actually brought up in the campaign,

00:36:18.610 --> 00:36:21.930
in the reelection campaign.

00:36:21.930 --> 00:36:24.130
Among -- there was a mudslinging.

00:36:24.130 --> 00:36:27.110
You think elections today is bad.

00:36:27.110 --> 00:36:30.060
And it was incredibly
painful to her and I wonder

00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:32.140
if she knew whether
or not it was true.

00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:38.650
You know, I want to -- she once
wrote that her mother was --

00:36:38.650 --> 00:36:43.320
there was this misconception
that her mother was very --

00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:49.310
was 15 when she first had her first
child with Louisa's sister, Nancy.

00:36:49.310 --> 00:36:53.570
And this is basically under
girded a lot of the scholarship

00:36:53.570 --> 00:36:54.900
that had been done about Louisa.

00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:58.870
That Louisa must have known
that her mother was kind of --

00:36:58.870 --> 00:37:01.330
and if she was 15 she was
probably poorly educated

00:37:01.330 --> 00:37:05.090
or probably lower class and nothing
was known about her mother really.

00:37:05.090 --> 00:37:09.570 position:56%
And there was some sense that Louisa
was very insecure about her mother.

00:37:09.570 --> 00:37:11.530
That's actually not true.

00:37:11.530 --> 00:37:17.760
It turns out, you know, one of
the nice discoveries was be able

00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:21.140
to actually find her mother's
birth records and things

00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:24.250
like that in parish registers.

00:37:24.250 --> 00:37:26.200
And since her mother was much --

00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:27.780
and then reconstruct the map

00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:29.540
of who her family was
and who her father was.

00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:32.020
And her, you know, her mother
was pretty middle class.

00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:35.440
Was 23, not 15.

00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:37.040
You know, all these things.

00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:43.790
I kind of want to know why she said
her mother was 21 when they went

00:37:43.790 --> 00:37:47.020 position:56%
to France, which would have made her
15 when they had their first child.

00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:51.190
I have an actual theory which is
that Louisa was 21 when she went

00:37:51.190 --> 00:37:54.070
to Prussia and I think
she was just --

00:37:54.070 --> 00:37:57.470 position:56%
when she was writing her own account
she was sort of putting herself

00:37:57.470 --> 00:38:00.170
in her mother's place, or
putting her mother in her place.

00:38:00.170 --> 00:38:01.690
That's -- No, no, no.

00:38:01.690 --> 00:38:03.470
That's complete speculation
on my part.

00:38:03.470 --> 00:38:04.770
That's what I'm saying.

00:38:04.770 --> 00:38:06.710
That's not in the book, you
know, that's me standing up here

00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:12.010
and coming up with a theory
that I can't ever confirm or --

00:38:12.010 --> 00:38:14.670
but that's why I would
have to ask her, you know.

00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:16.050
And I'm not sure she'd
tell me the truth.

00:38:16.050 --> 00:38:18.970
So, but, yeah.

00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:26.600
&gt;&gt; Audience Member: What was
her relationship to her family?

00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:30.920
Did they support her and did
she communicate with the family?

00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:33.600
&gt;&gt; Louisa Thomas: She was very
very close to her sisters,

00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:37.000
they were her best -- and had the
typical siblings relationships,

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.770 position:56%
fraught relationships with them too.

00:38:40.770 --> 00:38:45.320
She was -- idolized her father.

00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:50.920
And that's partly because,
I think, he had some trouble

00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:53.380
that affected her and
she kind of built him

00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:57.710
up in her mind in a
very defensive way.

00:38:57.710 --> 00:39:01.990
But, yeah, I mean, she had a --

00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:07.670
one of the ways in which she
kept her sense of herself intact,

00:39:07.670 --> 00:39:11.770
you know, by being a not Adams,
was that she was Johnson, you know,

00:39:11.770 --> 00:39:16.390
and she sort of held onto that
part of her a little bit tighter

00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:17.960
than was common at the time.

00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:20.790
And it's common for -- when you
marry into the Adams family it was

00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:24.600
like a, pfft, you know,
it was all consuming.

00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:30.580
And she kind of kept some distance
and partly that was by, you know,

00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:33.890
she would sort of write things
like, "Well they, you know,

00:39:33.890 --> 00:39:36.560
my father was a revolutionary
hero too."

00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:43.220 position:56%
You know, she sort of made a kind of
bigger deal out of her bona fides,

00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:46.630
you know, than she
might have otherwise.

00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:48.710
&gt;&gt; Audience Member: How
did she meet Quincy?

00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:51.540
&gt;&gt; Louisa Thomas: Her father was
the American Counsel in London

00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:54.150
and John Quincy -- and his
house was known to be a place,

00:39:54.150 --> 00:39:57.560
it was very welcoming to Americans
who were visiting London, you know,

00:39:57.560 --> 00:39:59.630
you come get your mail,
you talk business.

00:39:59.630 --> 00:40:02.740
It was especially known
to be welcoming

00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:05.070
to young American bachelors
because he had

00:40:05.070 --> 00:40:07.290
so many pretty young daughters.

00:40:07.290 --> 00:40:11.150
They would come to pick up their
mail and then stay for dinner

00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:14.350
and then after dinner there
would be singing in the parlor

00:40:14.350 --> 00:40:19.170
by the young soprano Louisa,
and the piano player Nancy

00:40:19.170 --> 00:40:21.190
and Caroline played the harp.

00:40:21.190 --> 00:40:26.930
And, so, it -- you know, there
house was very very social spot.

00:40:26.930 --> 00:40:32.070
So, John Quincy came one day,
brought by John Trumbull,

00:40:32.070 --> 00:40:37.770
Colonial Trumbull who painted
all those amazing scenes.

00:40:37.770 --> 00:40:41.860
Who once had a thing
for Louisa himself.

00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:46.040
And he kind of went away for
a month and then came back

00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:48.740
and then came back night
after night after night.

00:40:48.740 --> 00:40:53.430
And it's actually very
funny, he couldn't stay away

00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:57.380
and he was suspicious of
pleasure, he was so, in some ways,

00:40:57.380 --> 00:41:01.510
more puritan than, you know,
puritan and he would write

00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:04.390
in his diary like, "This is
terrible, I have to get away,

00:41:04.390 --> 00:41:07.730
this is so pleasurable,
what's going on?

00:41:07.730 --> 00:41:11.970
I got to go."

00:41:11.970 --> 00:41:13.270
Yep.

00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:20.430
&gt;&gt; Audience Member: That
reminds me of John Wesley

00:41:20.430 --> 00:41:26.470
when John Quincy was president
he embraced the philosophy

00:41:26.470 --> 00:41:31.380
of John Wesley was, which
was to get up in the morning

00:41:31.380 --> 00:41:33.680
and pour over your bible.

00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:38.000
And in her journal she wrote that
the fact that their relationship,

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:39.680 position:56%
because that was when they had their
most pleasant, amorous moments.

00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:40.980
She was bitter towards John Wesley.

00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:42.280
&gt;&gt; Louisa Thomas: Yes.

00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:44.580
Absolutely.

00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:48.460
&gt;&gt; Audience Member: Any questions?

00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:50.760
Okay.

00:41:52.050 --> 00:41:54.510
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: So let's
acknowledge Louisa Thomas.

00:41:54.510 --> 00:42:04.040
[ Applause ]

00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:06.700
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: Thank you so much
for being with us this afternoon.

00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:09.970
We promote books and reading
at the Center for the Book,

00:42:09.970 --> 00:42:13.840
because we believe they're the
best tools for joy and love

00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:16.190
and laughter and for time travel.

00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:18.010
Somebody, an author,
was here talking

00:42:18.010 --> 00:42:22.490 position:56%
about that a couple weeks back, that
we get to travel time and geography

00:42:22.490 --> 00:42:24.410
and never leave our chair.

00:42:24.410 --> 00:42:28.460 position:56%
And you take us to exciting places
in your talk and in your book today,

00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:29.760
so thank you for doing that.

00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:34.110
We get a chance to be exposed

designing of DC, the building of DC,

00:43:27.390 --> 00:43:30.530
shame on me for not
having it, right?

00:43:30.530 --> 00:43:33.210

Spain and France

00:43:33.210 --> 00:43:36.060
