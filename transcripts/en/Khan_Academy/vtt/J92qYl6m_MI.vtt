00:00:00.504 --> 00:00:02.220
- [Kim] Hey, this is
Kim from Khan Academy,

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.763
and today I'm talking with some experts

00:00:05.763 --> 00:00:08.013
about The Fourth Amendment.

00:00:09.061 --> 00:00:11.549
This is the Fourth Amendment
of the Bill of Rights,

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:15.209
and the Fourth Amendment
deals with unreasonable search

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:16.964
and seizure.

00:00:16.964 --> 00:00:19.440
So here's the official
text of the amendment.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.100
It says, "This right of
the people to be secure

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.829
"in their persons, houses,
papers, and effects,

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:28.878
"against unreasonable
searches and seizures,

00:00:28.878 --> 00:00:32.354
"shall not be violated, and
no Warrants shall issue,

00:00:32.354 --> 00:00:36.859
"but upon probable cause,
supported by Oath or affirmation,

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:39.831
"and particularly describing
the place to be searched,

00:00:39.831 --> 00:00:42.775
"and the persons or things to be seized."

00:00:42.775 --> 00:00:44.530
To learn more about the
the Fourth Amendment,

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.825
I talked to two law professors

00:00:46.825 --> 00:00:50.011
who specialize in criminal law,

00:00:50.011 --> 00:00:53.178
Professor Tracey Meares of Yale University

00:00:53.178 --> 00:00:57.038
and Professor Orin Kerr of
George Washington University,

00:00:57.038 --> 00:00:59.516
and he's a particular
expert in criminal procedure

00:00:59.516 --> 00:01:01.500
and computer crime.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.548
Professor Kerr, can you
tell us a little bit about

00:01:03.548 --> 00:01:06.297
what the Fourth Amendment
is and why the Framers

00:01:06.297 --> 00:01:10.041
were interested in protecting
these rights in particular?

00:01:10.041 --> 00:01:11.536
- [Orin] The Fourth Amendment is a ban

00:01:11.536 --> 00:01:14.652
on unreasonable searches and
seizures by the government.

00:01:14.652 --> 00:01:17.118
It's something the
Framers were interested in

00:01:17.118 --> 00:01:20.499
because they wanted to limit
the government's power.

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:21.785
At the time of the framing,

00:01:21.785 --> 00:01:25.440
the English King had engaged
in some pretty bad things

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.237
that the Framers wanted to stop,

00:01:27.237 --> 00:01:29.931
and one of those was
raiding people's homes

00:01:29.931 --> 00:01:31.958
with what was called a general warrant.

00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:33.633
A general warrant was
basically a warrant that said

00:01:33.633 --> 00:01:35.937
the police could go anywhere
and look for anything

00:01:35.937 --> 00:01:37.261
without any limit.

00:01:37.261 --> 00:01:38.752
- [Kim] I asked Professor
Meares to explain

00:01:38.752 --> 00:01:41.105
a little bit more about general warrants.

00:01:41.105 --> 00:01:43.400
She's a professor at Yale Law School

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.611
who specializes in criminal procedure

00:01:45.611 --> 00:01:47.529
and criminal law policy.

00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:49.360
- [Tracey] They were a general warrant

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.527
allowing these officials
to search people's homes,

00:01:55.897 --> 00:01:58.517
places, papers, the kinds of things

00:01:58.517 --> 00:02:02.684
that the Fourth Amendment lists
in ways that people thought

00:02:03.972 --> 00:02:05.055
was not okay.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.258
The Fourth Amendment
was primarily concerned

00:02:09.258 --> 00:02:11.427
with a couple of things.

00:02:11.427 --> 00:02:15.594
One: a case involving a
seditious libel investigation.

00:02:18.494 --> 00:02:21.073
It's a case called Entick.

00:02:21.073 --> 00:02:25.142
And a warrant was issued
authorizing Entick,

00:02:25.142 --> 00:02:27.380
that's the subject of
the warrant, his arrest,

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.646
and the seizure of all
of his books and papers

00:02:31.646 --> 00:02:35.813
so that he could be prosecuted
for seditious libel.

00:02:37.277 --> 00:02:39.643
That case isn't as well-known
as the second case,

00:02:39.643 --> 00:02:42.552
which is called the
Writs of Assistance case,

00:02:42.552 --> 00:02:46.469
and basically, the Writs
of Assistance involved

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:52.602
customs inspectors who
were trying to crack down

00:02:52.602 --> 00:02:56.685
on smuggling that was
affecting Boston's economy,

00:02:59.851 --> 00:03:04.018
so to add in that task, inspectors
used writs of assistance

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:10.175
that were issued by the king
and authorized the inspectors

00:03:10.175 --> 00:03:12.258
both to draft assistance,

00:03:13.927 --> 00:03:15.878
hence the name "writs of assistance,"

00:03:15.878 --> 00:03:19.128
and to search any place
where smuggled goods

00:03:19.128 --> 00:03:21.000
might be concealed.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.635
- [Orin] The Framers wanted
to put an end to that

00:03:22.635 --> 00:03:24.771
and so they said, "No general
warrants are allowed,"

00:03:24.771 --> 00:03:26.787
and searches and seizures
have to be reasonable.

00:03:26.787 --> 00:03:29.592
That really means is the
government can't just stop anyone,

00:03:29.592 --> 00:03:31.474
arrest anyone, break into someone's house.

00:03:31.474 --> 00:03:34.666
There are limits as to
what the government can do.

00:03:34.666 --> 00:03:36.618
- [Kim] But what are those limits?

00:03:36.618 --> 00:03:39.278
What determines probable
cause for a search

00:03:39.278 --> 00:03:43.229
and what renders a search
and seizure unreasonable?

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:44.861
- [Orin] Yeah, what counts as unreasonable

00:03:44.861 --> 00:03:46.726
is a really big question.

00:03:46.726 --> 00:03:49.785
There are different answers
different courts have suggested,

00:03:49.785 --> 00:03:53.085
but the basic idea is that
first if the government

00:03:53.085 --> 00:03:56.044
has a valid warrant, a search
or a seizure is reasonable.

00:03:56.044 --> 00:03:58.285
If the warrant, if a judge
has signed off and said,

00:03:58.285 --> 00:04:00.251
"Yeah, the government has probable cause

00:04:00.251 --> 00:04:02.429
"to search this place
for particular evidence,"

00:04:02.429 --> 00:04:04.073
then the government can do that.

00:04:04.073 --> 00:04:05.382
And then the Supreme Court has laid out

00:04:05.382 --> 00:04:07.226
a bunch of what they call exceptions

00:04:07.226 --> 00:04:08.460
to the warrant requirement,

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.088
which are also reasonable searches.

00:04:10.088 --> 00:04:12.924
So for example, if a person
consents to a search,

00:04:12.924 --> 00:04:14.522
that's reasonable.

00:04:14.522 --> 00:04:16.148
Or in the case of a car,

00:04:16.148 --> 00:04:18.019
a car can be searched without a warrant

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:19.752
based on probable cause.

00:04:19.752 --> 00:04:21.924
That's called the automobile exception.

00:04:21.924 --> 00:04:23.271
There are rules that govern

00:04:23.271 --> 00:04:25.468
when the police can stop
somebody temporarily.

00:04:25.468 --> 00:04:27.414
When the government needs an arrest,

00:04:27.414 --> 00:04:28.733
they need probable cause.

00:04:28.733 --> 00:04:30.474
There are basically all sorts of rules

00:04:30.474 --> 00:04:31.641
that the Supreme Court has laid out

00:04:31.641 --> 00:04:33.335
on a bunch of different cases

00:04:33.335 --> 00:04:36.196
that say what counts as an
unreasonable search or seizure.

00:04:36.196 --> 00:04:37.756
The Supreme Court has
said that probable cause

00:04:37.756 --> 00:04:40.923
means a fair probability
that evidence will be found

00:04:40.923 --> 00:04:43.556
in a particular place or
that a particular person

00:04:43.556 --> 00:04:47.313
committed a crime, and "fair
probability" is the language,

00:04:47.313 --> 00:04:49.464
but that's not something
the Supreme Court has said.

00:04:49.464 --> 00:04:51.062
You know, that's not 50%.

00:04:51.062 --> 00:04:52.775
That doesn't mean it's
more probable than not.

00:04:52.775 --> 00:04:55.718
It just means that there's
pretty good reason to think

00:04:55.718 --> 00:04:57.976
that there's evidence to
be in a particular place

00:04:57.976 --> 00:05:00.154
or that a particular
person committed a crime.

00:05:00.154 --> 00:05:02.570
So it doesn't mean a hunch,
it doesn't mean the officer

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:05.105
just had the idea pop into his head,

00:05:05.105 --> 00:05:08.123
but it also doesn't mean
that the officer's certain.

00:05:08.123 --> 00:05:10.141
There's just got to be
a pretty good reason,

00:05:10.141 --> 00:05:11.422
but not certainty,

00:05:11.422 --> 00:05:13.033
to think that that
person committed a crime

00:05:13.033 --> 00:05:14.705
or there's evidence there.

00:05:14.705 --> 00:05:16.642
- [Kim] But when I asked Professor
Meares the same question,

00:05:16.642 --> 00:05:19.566
she wasn't convinced
it was so easy to tell

00:05:19.566 --> 00:05:22.168
what counts as probable cause.

00:05:22.168 --> 00:05:25.418
So what counts as a true probable cause

00:05:27.422 --> 00:05:30.035
to issue a warrant upon?

00:05:30.035 --> 00:05:31.450
(Tracey sighs)

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:32.403
(Kim laughs) Sorry.

00:05:32.403 --> 00:05:34.723
We can just skip this instead.

00:05:34.723 --> 00:05:36.141
- [Tracey] Let's take a second.

00:05:36.141 --> 00:05:37.614
I mean, I taught this today.

00:05:37.614 --> 00:05:39.927
You can't, these aren't questions

00:05:39.927 --> 00:05:41.520
that you can just simply answer.

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.977
No one can actually.

00:05:43.977 --> 00:05:48.109
I mean, there is, I mean
literally, I taught today

00:05:48.109 --> 00:05:50.942
the fact that there is no real law

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.370
on what probable cause is.

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:57.774
It's inherently a factual determination.

00:05:57.774 --> 00:05:59.627
- [Kim] So how does this work in practice?

00:05:59.627 --> 00:06:01.697
I asked Professor Kerr
if it's the case that

00:06:01.697 --> 00:06:04.195
a police officer has to convince a judge

00:06:04.195 --> 00:06:07.145
that there's probable
cause to issue a warrant.

00:06:07.145 --> 00:06:08.603
- [Orin] Yes, that can
come up in two ways.

00:06:08.603 --> 00:06:10.721
In some cases, the Supreme Court says

00:06:10.721 --> 00:06:14.269
the police have to go to a
judge first and get a warrant

00:06:14.269 --> 00:06:16.357
and then they have to convince the judge

00:06:16.357 --> 00:06:19.642
that what they're about to do
is based on probable cause.

00:06:19.642 --> 00:06:20.859
And other cases come up

00:06:20.859 --> 00:06:23.994
when the government has
searched first or arrested first

00:06:23.994 --> 00:06:26.047
and then they come back with the evidence

00:06:26.047 --> 00:06:27.770
or come back with the
person who was arrested

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:29.474
and then there's a hearing as to whether

00:06:29.474 --> 00:06:31.151
there was probable cause for the arrest

00:06:31.151 --> 00:06:32.254
that already occurred,

00:06:32.254 --> 00:06:33.719
so either way the standards are the same.

00:06:33.719 --> 00:06:35.326
It's that fair probability idea,

00:06:35.326 --> 00:06:37.982
ultimately up to a judge
whether the police were right

00:06:37.982 --> 00:06:40.025
or wrong in doing what they did.

00:06:40.025 --> 00:06:42.194
- [Kim] Interesting, so
there is a little bit of

00:06:42.194 --> 00:06:46.002
prior legwork involved in some cases.

00:06:46.002 --> 00:06:50.750
What happens in cases when
it might be really important

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:54.583
to get evidence, say if
there's a bomb threat?

00:06:56.292 --> 00:06:58.939
- [Orin] So there are some
rules that allow searches

00:06:58.939 --> 00:07:00.402
or seizures without a warrant

00:07:00.402 --> 00:07:03.156
under what they call
exigent circumstances.

00:07:03.156 --> 00:07:05.143
That basically means
there is an emergency,

00:07:05.143 --> 00:07:08.334
so the government had to act
without a search warrant.

00:07:08.334 --> 00:07:10.084
And so if there is a ticking time bomb

00:07:10.084 --> 00:07:12.856
that they think is gonna
go off in a package

00:07:12.856 --> 00:07:14.241
and they've got good reason to think

00:07:14.241 --> 00:07:16.154
there is this ticking
time bomb in the package,

00:07:16.154 --> 00:07:18.611
they don't have to say, "Hey,
we're gonna go find a judge,"

00:07:18.611 --> 00:07:20.036
because by the time they do that,

00:07:20.036 --> 00:07:21.374
the bomb might have gone off.

00:07:21.374 --> 00:07:23.056
They can search that package

00:07:23.056 --> 00:07:26.253
under this exigent circumstances idea.

00:07:26.253 --> 00:07:30.047
So that's an exception to the
rules, although beyond that,

00:07:30.047 --> 00:07:32.259
there is no difference
between a serious case

00:07:32.259 --> 00:07:34.681
and a less serious case
under the Fourth Amendment.

00:07:34.681 --> 00:07:36.152
They're kind of all serious cases,

00:07:36.152 --> 00:07:39.220
so the courts have to follow
and the police have to follow

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:42.451
the same rules in less serious
and more serious cases.

00:07:42.451 --> 00:07:44.065
- [Kim] Professor Meares
gave me an example

00:07:44.065 --> 00:07:46.159
of what seemed like a less serious case,

00:07:46.159 --> 00:07:48.601
but it's still a really
interesting example

00:07:48.601 --> 00:07:52.683
of what counts as an
unreasonable search and seizure.

00:07:52.683 --> 00:07:54.059
- [Tracey] I'll give you one more case

00:07:54.059 --> 00:07:55.898
that I'm sure the high
school students will love,

00:07:55.898 --> 00:07:58.135
and my students love it.

00:07:58.135 --> 00:08:02.302
It's a case where a person
was sitting in a noddle shop

00:08:03.532 --> 00:08:07.986
in front of a window eating
a big bowl of noodles,

00:08:07.986 --> 00:08:12.496
clear soup with noodles, and
a police officer walks by

00:08:12.496 --> 00:08:16.261
the person eating the noddles
and notices something floating

00:08:16.261 --> 00:08:17.789
in the bowl of noodles.

00:08:17.789 --> 00:08:20.445
So he enters into the store

00:08:20.445 --> 00:08:22.243
where the person is eating the noodles

00:08:22.243 --> 00:08:25.624
and the person has left
temporarily the bowl of noodles

00:08:25.624 --> 00:08:28.857
to get a napkin or go to
the bathroom or something.

00:08:28.857 --> 00:08:31.841
And then the police officer
approaches the bowl,

00:08:31.841 --> 00:08:35.635
picks up the person's
spoon and stirs the noodles

00:08:35.635 --> 00:08:37.960
to see if he can find anything

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:41.330
and some baggies of
crack float to the top.

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:44.304
Did the person have a reasonable
expectation of privacy

00:08:44.304 --> 00:08:45.156
in their food?

00:08:45.156 --> 00:08:46.642
- [Kim] In their soup?

00:08:46.642 --> 00:08:47.902
- [Tracey] In their soup.

00:08:47.902 --> 00:08:49.661
(Kim laughs)

00:08:49.661 --> 00:08:51.425
- [Kim] How did they rule?

00:08:51.425 --> 00:08:55.520
- [Tracey] They ruled that
the stirring was a search.

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:58.306
So if it is a search, and i.e.,

00:08:58.306 --> 00:09:01.723
that you have a subjective
interest of privacy

00:09:01.723 --> 00:09:04.702
in your soup that society is prepared to

00:09:04.702 --> 00:09:08.721
recognize as reasonable,
then the police officer would

00:09:08.721 --> 00:09:13.291
have to get a warrant
before stirring the soup.

00:09:13.291 --> 00:09:15.014
- [Kim] This raises the question.

00:09:15.014 --> 00:09:18.362
Where I have Fourth Amendment rights?

00:09:18.362 --> 00:09:21.005
Are some locations
protected and not others?

00:09:21.005 --> 00:09:23.083
- [Orin] The building block
of the Fourth Amendment

00:09:23.083 --> 00:09:24.969
is really that you have
Fourth Amendment rights

00:09:24.969 --> 00:09:29.645
in your home, in your
pockets, in your packages,

00:09:29.645 --> 00:09:32.724
but you don't have Fourth
Amendment rights outside.

00:09:32.724 --> 00:09:33.974
You don't have Fourth Amendment rights

00:09:33.974 --> 00:09:37.081
in what you're doing outside
or if the police want to walk

00:09:37.081 --> 00:09:40.198
on what they call open
fields, public streets,

00:09:40.198 --> 00:09:43.244
that, you don't have Fourth
Amendment rights in that.

00:09:43.244 --> 00:09:45.100
So thinking about how the
Fourth Amendment applies

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:46.477
just in the physical world,

00:09:46.477 --> 00:09:47.745
if the police want to
break into your home,

00:09:47.745 --> 00:09:49.141
they need a search warrant.

00:09:49.141 --> 00:09:51.684
If the police want to watch
you walk down the street,

00:09:51.684 --> 00:09:53.506
they don't need anything.

00:09:53.506 --> 00:09:55.080
It's not a search or a seizure,

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:57.988
so they can do anything they
want, just watching you.

00:09:57.988 --> 00:10:01.066
If they want to arrest you,
they need probable cause

00:10:01.066 --> 00:10:03.165
to believe you've committed a crime.

00:10:03.165 --> 00:10:05.101
So those are really the building blocks

00:10:05.101 --> 00:10:06.336
of the Fourth Amendment

00:10:06.336 --> 00:10:08.969
going back to 18th-century technology.

00:10:08.969 --> 00:10:10.215
And then the big question becomes,

00:10:10.215 --> 00:10:13.590
"All right. Well, how do you
update that to a modern world?"

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:15.995
- [Tracey] It's also the case
that the Fourth Amendment

00:10:15.995 --> 00:10:18.390
applies to seizures,

00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:23.143
so what police have to show
before they arrest a person

00:10:23.143 --> 00:10:27.310
or temporarily stop them,
or briefly pat their body

00:10:30.644 --> 00:10:33.049
on the outside of their body for weapons.

00:10:33.049 --> 00:10:36.398
All of those questions are
Fourth Amendment questions,

00:10:36.398 --> 00:10:40.419
as are questions involving how much force

00:10:40.419 --> 00:10:44.571
police actually use to effect the arrest

00:10:44.571 --> 00:10:48.898
once we've decided that
an arrest is legitimate.

00:10:48.898 --> 00:10:51.106
So we haven't talked about
any of those questions

00:10:51.106 --> 00:10:54.815
but the Fourth Amendment
governs all of that

00:10:54.815 --> 00:10:55.898
and remember,

00:10:57.034 --> 00:10:59.925
the Fourth Amendment
governs all of those topics

00:10:59.925 --> 00:11:04.289
in a context in which
the Framers' motivations

00:11:04.289 --> 00:11:06.321
for enacting the Fourth Amendment

00:11:06.321 --> 00:11:08.091
have absolutely nothing to do

00:11:08.091 --> 00:11:11.093
with most of those
things I just mentioned.

00:11:11.093 --> 00:11:13.045
- [Kim] But the Fourth
Amendment also has implications

00:11:13.045 --> 00:11:15.855
that go beyond warrants and seizures.

00:11:15.855 --> 00:11:17.544
Professor Meares thinks that one of the

00:11:17.544 --> 00:11:21.512
biggest Fourth Amendment
issues today is discretion.

00:11:21.512 --> 00:11:25.282
- [Tracey] Many people have
thought much more about

00:11:25.282 --> 00:11:28.876
how the Fourth Amendment protects privacy

00:11:28.876 --> 00:11:33.275
than how the Fourth Amendment
addresses discretion.

00:11:33.275 --> 00:11:34.956
- [Kim] And by discretion
in this case, you mean

00:11:34.956 --> 00:11:37.816
what they get to decide
to do on their own, right?

00:11:37.816 --> 00:11:39.312
- [Tracey] Exactly so.

00:11:39.312 --> 00:11:42.203
And one way to see the difference
between those two things

00:11:42.203 --> 00:11:46.286
is to think about a metal
detector in an airport.

00:11:48.121 --> 00:11:52.152
So long as everyone is
required to go through

00:11:52.152 --> 00:11:53.992
the metal detector,

00:11:53.992 --> 00:11:57.992
there is no law enforcement
discretion involved.

00:11:58.882 --> 00:12:02.114
- [Kim] So this is kind of
where the public safety aspect

00:12:02.114 --> 00:12:05.281
comes in, that if we're all subject to

00:12:09.057 --> 00:12:12.890
non-invasive procedures
at the whim of police,

00:12:14.393 --> 00:12:16.742
it's a little different
than if individuals

00:12:16.742 --> 00:12:19.863
are kind of plucked for that reason?

00:12:19.863 --> 00:12:21.997
- [Tracey] Right, that
it's just pointing out

00:12:21.997 --> 00:12:22.905
that targeting,

00:12:22.905 --> 00:12:27.697
the targeting of people for
invasions is a different problem

00:12:27.697 --> 00:12:31.030
than the invasion problem itself, right?

00:12:32.394 --> 00:12:36.561
And so if all we ever do is
think about privacy invasion

00:12:38.291 --> 00:12:41.473
without thinking about
the discretion problem,

00:12:41.473 --> 00:12:43.660
then we're missing something important.

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:45.286
- [Kim] For Professor Kerr however,

00:12:45.286 --> 00:12:48.054
the most important issue at stake today

00:12:48.054 --> 00:12:50.571
regarding the Fourth
Amendment is how it will apply

00:12:50.571 --> 00:12:52.470
to electronic media.

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:53.688
- [Orin] Well, the big question I think

00:12:53.688 --> 00:12:55.111
is how the Fourth Amendment is gonna apply

00:12:55.111 --> 00:12:58.002
to searches and seizures
of computers, of emails,

00:12:58.002 --> 00:13:02.980
to the internet, new technologies
that we all use every day.

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:04.833
We wake up in the morning and hop online

00:13:04.833 --> 00:13:09.208
or go on Twitter or
whatever you use online,

00:13:09.208 --> 00:13:12.666
lots and lots of communications
online all around the world,

00:13:12.666 --> 00:13:14.990
and how does the Fourth
Amendment apply to that

00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:17.771
is something that the courts
are beginning to answer

00:13:17.771 --> 00:13:19.610
but they've only started to answer.

00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:21.788
Some really, really hard
questions of kind of translating

00:13:21.788 --> 00:13:25.062
that physical world concept
of the Fourth Amendment

00:13:25.062 --> 00:13:27.997
to the world of computers
that we live today.

00:13:27.997 --> 00:13:30.645
- [Kim] So, as we've learned,
the Fourth Amendment ensures

00:13:30.645 --> 00:13:33.478
that government authorities
can't raid homes, pockets,

00:13:33.478 --> 00:13:36.426
or papers without a
warrant issued by a judge,

00:13:36.426 --> 00:13:38.725
and then only if there is a probable cause

00:13:38.725 --> 00:13:41.163
to believe there is a reason for a search.

00:13:41.163 --> 00:13:44.735
What's tricky is deciding
what counts as probable cause

00:13:44.735 --> 00:13:47.345
and whether it's discriminatory to select

00:13:47.345 --> 00:13:50.155
some people to search, but not others.

00:13:50.155 --> 00:13:52.186
And how do we translate
the Fourth Amendment

00:13:52.186 --> 00:13:54.920
to a world where our
papers are all digital?

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:57.433
Should the police be permitted
to search our cell phones,

00:13:57.433 --> 00:14:01.760
our browsing histories, our
private social media profiles?

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:03.776
