00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.192
- [Instructor] A set of laptop prices

00:00:02.192 --> 00:00:05.977
are normally distributed
with a mean of $750

00:00:05.977 --> 00:00:09.019
and a standard deviation of $60.

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:11.736
What proportion of laptop prices

00:00:11.736 --> 00:00:13.069
are between $624

00:00:14.406 --> 00:00:15.239
and $768?

00:00:18.098 --> 00:00:20.350
So let's think about what they are asking.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.274
So we have a normal
distribution for the prices.

00:00:24.274 --> 00:00:26.852
So it would look something like this.

00:00:26.852 --> 00:00:29.035
This is just my hand-drawn sketch

00:00:29.035 --> 00:00:30.939
of a normal distribution.

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:32.285
So it would look something like this.

00:00:32.285 --> 00:00:33.748
It should be symmetric,

00:00:33.748 --> 00:00:36.767
so I'm making it as symmetric
as I can hand draw it.

00:00:36.767 --> 00:00:38.740
And we have the mean

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.134
right in the center.

00:00:40.134 --> 00:00:41.829
So the mean

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:43.152
would be right there.

00:00:43.152 --> 00:00:44.569
And that is $750.

00:00:46.008 --> 00:00:49.793
They also tell us that we have
a standard deviation of $60.

00:00:49.793 --> 00:00:52.649
So that means one standard
deviation above the mean

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.459
would be roughly right over here,

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:58.176
and that would be 750 plus 60.

00:00:58.176 --> 00:01:00.428
So that would be $810.

00:01:00.428 --> 00:01:02.030
One standard deviation below the mean

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.375
would put us right about there,

00:01:04.375 --> 00:01:07.510
and that would be 750 minus $60,

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.177
which would be $690.

00:01:11.295 --> 00:01:13.501
And then they tell us,

00:01:13.501 --> 00:01:15.242
what proportion of laptop prices

00:01:15.242 --> 00:01:16.575
are between $624

00:01:18.493 --> 00:01:19.326
and $768.

00:01:22.115 --> 00:01:23.698
So the lower bound,

00:01:24.971 --> 00:01:25.804
$624,

00:01:27.618 --> 00:01:29.848
that's going to actually be more than

00:01:29.848 --> 00:01:31.310
another standard deviation less,

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.143
so that's going to be right around here.

00:01:34.143 --> 00:01:34.976
So that is

00:01:36.117 --> 00:01:36.950
$624.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.477
And 768 would put us

00:01:41.783 --> 00:01:42.950
right at about

00:01:44.244 --> 00:01:45.591
right at about there,

00:01:45.591 --> 00:01:47.982
and once again this is
just a hand-drawn sketch.

00:01:47.982 --> 00:01:49.315
But that is 768.

00:01:50.281 --> 00:01:53.323
And so what proportion are
between those two values?

00:01:53.323 --> 00:01:55.459
So we wanna find essentially the area

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:59.708
under this distribution
between these two values.

00:01:59.708 --> 00:02:01.682
The way we are going to approach it,

00:02:01.682 --> 00:02:04.770
we're going to figure out the z-score

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.301
for 768, it's going to be positive

00:02:07.301 --> 00:02:09.043
because it's above the mean,

00:02:09.043 --> 00:02:11.481
and then we're going to use
a z-table to figure out,

00:02:11.481 --> 00:02:13.898
what proportion is below 768.

00:02:14.732 --> 00:02:16.752
So essentially we're going to figure out

00:02:16.752 --> 00:02:17.750
this entire area.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.492
We're even going to figure out the stuff

00:02:19.492 --> 00:02:20.699
that's below 624.

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:22.441
That's what that z-table will give us.

00:02:22.441 --> 00:02:25.645
Then we'll figure out the z-score for 624.

00:02:25.645 --> 00:02:29.476
That will be negative 2 point something,

00:02:29.476 --> 00:02:31.079
and we will use the z-table again

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:35.328
to figure out the proportion
that is less than that.

00:02:35.328 --> 00:02:38.045
And so then we can subtract this red area

00:02:38.045 --> 00:02:40.506
from the proportion that is less than 768

00:02:40.506 --> 00:02:43.617
to get this area in between.

00:02:43.617 --> 00:02:45.637
So let's do that.

00:02:45.637 --> 00:02:49.747
Let's figure out first
the z-score for 768.

00:02:49.747 --> 00:02:52.511
And then we'll do it for 624.

00:02:52.511 --> 00:02:56.261
The z-score for 768,
I'll write it like that,

00:02:57.805 --> 00:02:59.523
is going to be

00:02:59.523 --> 00:03:00.606
768 minus 750

00:03:03.842 --> 00:03:07.255
over the standard deviation, over 60.

00:03:07.255 --> 00:03:10.460
So this is going to be equal to 18

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:11.293
over 60,

00:03:13.107 --> 00:03:16.107
which is the same thing as six over,

00:03:17.193 --> 00:03:18.517
let's see if we divide the numerator

00:03:18.517 --> 00:03:20.305
and the denominator by three,

00:03:20.305 --> 00:03:24.299
6/20, and this is the same thing

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:25.132
as 0.30.

00:03:28.641 --> 00:03:32.286
So that is the z-score
for this upper bound.

00:03:32.286 --> 00:03:35.537
Let's figure out what
proportion is less than that.

00:03:35.537 --> 00:03:37.650
For that, we take out a z-table,

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.577
get our z-table.

00:03:39.577 --> 00:03:42.244
And let's see we wanna get 0.30.

00:03:43.548 --> 00:03:46.404
And so this is 0.3, this first column,

00:03:46.404 --> 00:03:47.704
and we've done this in other videos,

00:03:47.704 --> 00:03:50.769
this goes up until the tenths place

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:52.348
for our z-score,

00:03:52.348 --> 00:03:54.299
and then if we wanna go
to our hundredths place,

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:57.039
that's what these other columns give us.

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:58.456
But we're at 0.3,

00:03:59.547 --> 00:04:01.892
so we're going to be in

00:04:01.892 --> 00:04:02.725
this row,

00:04:05.027 --> 00:04:07.743
and our hundredths place
is right over here,

00:04:07.743 --> 00:04:10.321
it's a zero, so this is the proportion

00:04:10.321 --> 00:04:12.238
that is less than $768.

00:04:15.545 --> 00:04:16.378
So .6179.

00:04:18.494 --> 00:04:19.827
So 0.61, 0.6179.

00:04:26.203 --> 00:04:28.293
So now let's do the same exercise

00:04:28.293 --> 00:04:32.210
but do it for the proportion
that's below $624.

00:04:34.957 --> 00:04:35.874
The z-score

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:39.932
for 624 is going to be equal to

00:04:41.087 --> 00:04:43.254
624 minus the mean of 750,

00:04:45.685 --> 00:04:47.352
all of that over 60.

00:04:48.657 --> 00:04:50.422
And so what is that going to be?

00:04:50.422 --> 00:04:52.209
I'll get my calculator out for this one,

00:04:52.209 --> 00:04:54.322
don't wanna make a careless error.

00:04:54.322 --> 00:04:55.405
624 minus 750

00:05:00.174 --> 00:05:01.962
is equal to,

00:05:01.962 --> 00:05:03.795
and then divide by 60,

00:05:05.793 --> 00:05:08.115
is equal to negative 2.1.

00:05:08.115 --> 00:05:11.343
So that lower bound is
2.1 standard deviations

00:05:11.343 --> 00:05:12.852
below the mean,

00:05:12.852 --> 00:05:17.310
or you could say it has a
z-score of negative 2.1.

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.888
Is equal to negative 2.1.

00:05:19.888 --> 00:05:22.744
And so to figure out the
proportion that is less than that,

00:05:22.744 --> 00:05:24.950
this red area right over here,

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:26.552
we go back to our z-table.

00:05:26.552 --> 00:05:29.361
And we actually go to the
first part of the z-table.

00:05:29.361 --> 00:05:32.032
So same idea but this starts at negative,

00:05:32.032 --> 00:05:34.307
a z-score of negative 3.4,

00:05:34.307 --> 00:05:37.187
3.4 standard deviations below the mean.

00:05:37.187 --> 00:05:38.556
And just like we saw before,

00:05:38.556 --> 00:05:41.622
this is our zero
hundredths, one hundredth,

00:05:41.622 --> 00:05:43.897
two hundredths, so on and so forth.

00:05:43.897 --> 00:05:47.334
And we wanna go to negative 2.1.

00:05:47.334 --> 00:05:51.235
We could say negative
2.10 just to be precise.

00:05:51.235 --> 00:05:52.721
So this is going to get us,

00:05:52.721 --> 00:05:54.927
let's see negative 2.1,

00:05:54.927 --> 00:05:55.925
there we go.

00:05:55.925 --> 00:05:57.008
And so we are

00:05:58.317 --> 00:06:01.400
negative 2.1, and it's negative 2.10,

00:06:02.403 --> 00:06:04.098
so we have zero hundredths,

00:06:04.098 --> 00:06:06.838
so we're gonna be right here on our table.

00:06:06.838 --> 00:06:10.693
So we see the proportion
that is less than 624

00:06:10.693 --> 00:06:12.276
is .0179 or 0.0179.

00:06:15.825 --> 00:06:16.658
So 0.0179.

00:06:20.677 --> 00:06:22.117
And so if we wanna
figure out the proportion

00:06:22.117 --> 00:06:23.743
that's in between the two,

00:06:23.743 --> 00:06:25.763
we just subtract this red area

00:06:25.763 --> 00:06:28.340
from this entire area,

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:30.871
the entire proportion that's less than 768

00:06:30.871 --> 00:06:33.193
to get what's in between.

00:06:33.193 --> 00:06:34.026
0.6179,

00:06:36.235 --> 00:06:37.628
once again I know I keep repeating it,

00:06:37.628 --> 00:06:40.647
that's this entire area right over here,

00:06:40.647 --> 00:06:42.667
and we're gonna subtract
out what we have in red,

00:06:42.667 --> 00:06:43.750
minus 0.0179,

00:06:46.545 --> 00:06:48.472
so we're gonna subtract this out,

00:06:48.472 --> 00:06:49.389
to get 0.6.

00:06:52.001 --> 00:06:55.275
So if we wanna give our
answer to four decimal places,

00:06:55.275 --> 00:06:56.858
it would be 0.6000,

00:06:58.410 --> 00:06:59.664
or another way to think about it is

00:06:59.664 --> 00:07:01.247
exactly 60% is

00:07:02.543 --> 00:07:04.210
between 624 and 768.
