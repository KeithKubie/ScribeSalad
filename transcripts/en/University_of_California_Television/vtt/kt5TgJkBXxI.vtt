00:00:05.322 --> 00:00:07.905
(upbeat music)

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.070
- Good afternoon, I'm Vince Resh

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.675
and I'm chair of the
Hitchcock Lecture Series

00:00:35.675 --> 00:00:39.610
and I want to welcome you to
the second of two lectures

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.880
that are going to be presented
by our guest this year

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.153
and we're very delighted to have her here.

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.870
Dr. Eugenie Scott is a
renowned anthropologist

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:51.760
and science educator.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.370
She was the executive director

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.640
for the National Center for
Science Education since 1986

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.460
and until her retirement in
2014 and as many of you know,

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.930
the center is a nonprofit
organization based in Oakland

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.720
whose stated mission is to defend

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.680
the integrity of science education

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.850
against ideological interference.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.440
And for those you that were lucky enough

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.630
to hear the lecture yesterday,

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.340
she talked very, very
brilliantly about two topics

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.880
which are always supposed to
keep out of our conversations,

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.064
how science and religion,

00:01:22.064 --> 00:01:25.297
sorry, politics and religion
can influence science.

00:01:25.297 --> 00:01:27.313
And just a brilliant lecture.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.050
She received her BS and MS degrees

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.250
from the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.610
at a pHD in biological anthropology

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.183
from the University of Missouri.

00:01:36.183 --> 00:01:38.470
She's taught at the
University of Kentucky,

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.360
University of Colorado, San Jose State

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.100
and California State East Bay.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.030
Now, the National Center
for Science Education,

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.090
Dr. Scott's work centered on
attempts to teach evolution

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.050
as simply one of a series of
hypotheses about human origins.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.310
Such as efforts to teach creation science,

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.470
and intelligent design in
American public schools.

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.690
In 2005, Dr. Scott and her staff worked

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.320
on the side of the
plaintiffs in the well known

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.653
Kitzmiller versus Dover
Area School District case.

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.940
And the court famously ruled
that intelligent design

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.080
was indeed a form of creationism

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.260
and therefore it's teaching,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.470
violated the establishment clause

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.620
of the first amendment
of the US Constitution.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.120
Now, the Hitchcock Lecture Series

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.860
is quite a well known series has gone on

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.970
and there's a detailed history of it

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.680
that I'd recommend that you look at.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.520
Likewise, there's a more
detailed biography of Dr. Scott

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.140
that you may want to read
after the lecture is over.

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.920
So I want to conclude with 2010,

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.270
the National Academy of
Science awarded Dr. Scott,

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.820
the public welfare medal for
extraordinary use of science

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.590
for the public good.

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.390
Her second lecture which will be given now

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.480
is entitled Evolution and
Creationism as Science and Myth.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.930
I also to thank Dr Bill Lineker

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.190
who as he's done many times,

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.900
explained the meaning of
that second graph up there,

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.152
which is one of Darwin's first attempts

00:03:08.152 --> 00:03:11.090
at drawing an evolutionary tree

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.490
or what we now call today a phylogeny.

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:17.560
So I wish you'd all join me
in welcoming Dr. Eugenie Scott

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.270
for her second lecture and certainly,

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.259
we're very lucky to have her here.

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:23.509
(applause)

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:25.952
- Thank you.

00:03:25.952 --> 00:03:27.133
Thank you Vincent.

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.860
It really is such a
high honor to be invited

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.203
to be a Hitchcock Lecture.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.027
When I got the letter,
I was just blown away.

00:03:38.027 --> 00:03:40.770
My predecessors in this position

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.480
have been such extraordinary scholars

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.357
and internationally known brilliant minds.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.780
So because this is such a very high honor

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.420
and because it's four
o'clock in the afternoon,

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.363
I'm going to read you a bedtime story.

00:03:59.343 --> 00:04:00.500
(laughs)

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:01.990
Please do not fall asleep

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:06.550
because I have a purpose in mind for this.

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.040
Once upon a time, there
was a steam engine.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.140
It was pulling a train full of toys

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.200
and food for the good
little girls and boys

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.300
on the other side of the mountain.

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.960
Then suddenly, the train stopped.

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:21.150
Her wheels just wouldn't turn anymore.

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.160
So the clown and the toys started
looking for another engine

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.300
to take them over the mountain.

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.557
They asked a big passenger train,

00:04:28.557 --> 00:04:30.387
"Please, would you take
us over the mountain

00:04:30.387 --> 00:04:32.029
"for the good little girls and boys?"

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:34.217
"No," said the passenger train.

00:04:34.217 --> 00:04:37.437
"I am much too grand
for the likes of you."

00:04:37.437 --> 00:04:39.917
Then they saw a powerful freight train.

00:04:39.917 --> 00:04:41.787
"Would you please pull
us over the mountain

00:04:41.787 --> 00:04:43.797
"for the good little boys and girls?"

00:04:43.797 --> 00:04:45.237
"No," said the freight train.

00:04:45.237 --> 00:04:46.997
"I am much too powerful and important

00:04:46.997 --> 00:04:49.090
"to pull the likes of you."

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.180
Then they saw a little old train

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.907
and asked if it would pull
them over the mountains.

00:04:53.907 --> 00:04:55.667
"No," said the little little train.

00:04:55.667 --> 00:04:58.577
"I am too old and tired
to go over the mountain.

00:04:58.577 --> 00:05:00.460
"I cannot help you."

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.603
The toys didn't know what to do.

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.917
Then the little blue engine
came up to them and asked,

00:05:05.917 --> 00:05:07.857
"What is the matter my friends?"

00:05:07.857 --> 00:05:09.127
"Oh, little blue engine,

00:05:09.127 --> 00:05:11.157
"would you please pull
us over the mountain?

00:05:11.157 --> 00:05:12.567
"The good little girls and boys

00:05:12.567 --> 00:05:14.097
"won't have any toys to play with

00:05:14.097 --> 00:05:15.627
"or good food to eat if you don't.

00:05:15.627 --> 00:05:17.270
"Please help us."

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:18.670
The little blue engine explained

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:20.390
that she had never been over the mountain

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:22.330
and usually, she was just asked

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.477
to switch trains in the yard.

00:05:24.477 --> 00:05:26.317
"I'm not very big, but I will try

00:05:26.317 --> 00:05:28.180
"to take you over the mountain."

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.790
So she hitched herself to the train.

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:32.880
It was a very steep mountain

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.823
but the little blue engine
kept saying to herself,

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:40.470
I think I can, I think
I can, I think I can.

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:42.750
And slowly and with great effort,

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:45.690
they started up the track and at last,

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:47.200
they reached the top of the mountain.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.090
The little train did it.

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:51.240
Down to the children in
the valley, they went.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.950
Now the good little girls
and boys would have toys

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:55.570
and good food to eat.

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:57.420
The little blue train saying to herself,

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:00.133
I thought I could, I thought
I could, I thought I could.

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.750
And if you think the
little engine that could

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:07.983
is about talking steam engines,
you're missing the point.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.170
The little engine that could

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:13.331
is about the importance of perseverance,

00:06:13.331 --> 00:06:17.730
having confidence, being
willing to give it your all.

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:20.550
It's an American inculturation myth.

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:23.096
It's a classic American myth.

00:06:23.096 --> 00:06:25.650
If the Hopis or the Iropish

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:27.210
were writing a story for children

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:30.200
about getting a train over a mountain,

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.720
all the toys would get out of the train

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.320
and collectively and cooperatively

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:36.610
push the train over the mountains.

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:39.253
This is an American enculturation myth.

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:44.440
In the beginning, God
created heaven and earth

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:46.080
and the earth was without form

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.930
and void and darkness was
upon the face of the deep.

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:52.030
And the spirit of God moved
upon the face of the waters.

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:55.520
And God said, "Let there be
light," and there was light.

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.870
And God saw the light that it was good.

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:00.290
And God divided the
light from the darkness,

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:03.370
called the light day and
the darkness he called night

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:06.780
and the evening and the
morning were the first day.

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:08.727
And God said, "Let there be a firmament

00:07:08.727 --> 00:07:09.827
"in the midst of the waters

00:07:09.827 --> 00:07:12.310
"and let it divide the
waters from the waters,"

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:14.790
And God made the firmament
and divided the waters

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:17.080
which were under the
firmament from the waters

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:19.520
which were above the
firmament and it was so.

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:21.680
And God called the firmament heaven

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.670
and the evening and the
morning where the second day.

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:26.907
And God said, "Let the
waters under the heaven

00:07:26.907 --> 00:07:28.767
"be gathered together into one place

00:07:28.767 --> 00:07:31.800
"and let the dry land
appear," and it was so.

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:33.870
And God called the dry land earth

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:36.910
and the gathering together
of the waters, he called seas

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:39.287
and God saw that it was good and God said,

00:07:39.287 --> 00:07:41.217
"Let the earth bring forth grass,

00:07:41.217 --> 00:07:43.347
"the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree

00:07:43.347 --> 00:07:46.830
"yielding fruit after
its kind," and it was so.

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:50.349
And the evening and the
morning were the third day.

00:07:50.349 --> 00:07:52.890
Well, I suspect you have a
pretty good idea how this ends.

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:54.750
Most Americans are quite familiar

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:56.480
with the Genesis creation story.

00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:00.500
Day four, God creates the
sun, the moon and the stars.

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:03.428
Day five He creates sea
creatures and birds.

00:08:03.428 --> 00:08:06.320
Day six he creates people and mammals.

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.940
And all of creation is good.

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:10.490
Things go okay for a while,

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:12.970
but then Adam and Eve are
tempted by the serpent

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:14.200
and disobey God

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.473
and they are driven
from the garden of Eden.

00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:22.640
Now the Genesis story is no
more about talking snakes

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:23.990
than the Little Engine that could

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:26.300
is about talking steam engines.

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:29.580
Both are examples of what
folklorists called myth

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:32.853
and myths are really important.

00:08:33.729 --> 00:08:37.100
One dictionary definition
of myth is falsehood,

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:39.973
but it's not important
whether myths are factual.

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:43.090
In fact, most of the time they aren't

00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:45.840
which doesn't lessen their importance.

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:48.760
Let me surprise you, as a
scientist and a humanist,

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:50.670
I will say that to a people,

00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:53.013
myths are more important than facts.

00:08:54.023 --> 00:08:57.200
And now I better explain
what it mean by myth.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:00.160
The study of mythology
crosses many borders.

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.806
Folklore and literature certainly,

00:09:01.806 --> 00:09:04.850
but also sociology and anthropology.

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:09.030
And popular speech again, the
synonym of myth is falsehood.

00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:10.420
To a folklorist though,

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:12.750
myths are the symbolic representation

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:15.760
of important cultural values to a people.

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:18.480
They are especially important
in non literate cultures

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:21.890
where cultural values have
to be transmitted orally,

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:25.083
but they also occur in
modern industrial countries.

00:09:26.717 --> 00:09:27.820
They have many purposes.

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:30.230
They might explain the
origin of the people

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:33.820
or establish rights to land
or to objects or rituals

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:35.550
for tribe or kin groups.

00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:37.840
Myths may be incorporated into rituals

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:39.980
that remind people of the relationships

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:41.470
of their group to other groups

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:43.704
or relationships within the society.

00:09:43.704 --> 00:09:46.550
They may also be art forms.

00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:48.920
Beowulf, the Odyssey, the Norse editors.

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:52.410
These are all art forms,
but highly mythic.

00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:56.060
They represent values which are important

00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:58.360
to the people who have developed them.

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:01.480
And they are a way of promoting
the continuity of a culture.

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:04.660
And of course, myths
diffuse from group to group.

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:06.570
They're taken apart, they're rearranged,

00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:09.480
they're synchrotized
with a cultural elements

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:12.070
just like every other aspect of culture.

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:15.558
But the big takeaway here
is that myths are not false.

00:10:15.558 --> 00:10:19.180
They are representative and
they tell important truths

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:20.710
about a people.

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:23.930
Myths are not supposed
to be taken literally.

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:26.650
You're not supposed to
believe that Ragged Dick

00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:28.430
was a real person.

00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:31.340
Ragged Dick is a character
in a popular series of books

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:35.450
written by the late 19th
century author Horatio Alger.

00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:38.380
Who's heard of Horatio Alger stories?

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:39.930
Practically every hand went up.

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:44.600
Well, Ragged Dick and his fellow heroes

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:49.220
were plucky poor boys who
through their strong character

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:52.630
and basic decency, managed
to pull themselves up

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:56.900
from poor levels of society
to the middle class.

00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:59.000
The Horatio Alger myth symbolizes

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.830
a very classic American secular myth,

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:03.340
Rags to Riches.

00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:06.520
Anybody can succeed, anybody
can pull themselves up

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:07.750
by their bootstraps

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:11.590
and this is a very, very
powerful American myth.

00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:14.500
And there are individuals who succeed

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:18.820
against very remarkably difficult odds.

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:22.213
People like Ben Carson or
people like George Soros.

00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:28.950
Actually the statistics will show

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:32.780
that a movement in the United
States from class to class,

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:35.540
social mobility is
actually less than it is

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:37.740
in much of Europe, but it is nonetheless,

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:39.640
an American myth that we can do that.

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:42.530
Periodically over the years,
the Horatio Alger myth

00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:45.100
influences American social welfare policy

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:47.480
where poor and working class individuals

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:50.320
are expected to bootstrap themselves up

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:52.860
with minimal help from
society and government.

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:56.430
But no one thinks that
Ragged Dick is a real person.

00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:58.210
Ragged Dick is symbolic.

00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:00.700
The power of myth is its symbolism.

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:02.770
It's not true in the literal sense

00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:05.933
but it's true in the
meaning that it conveys.

00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:10.120
The little engine that could
and Horatio Alger stories

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:11.960
are mythic narratives that illustrate

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:15.350
American secular values,
the value of individuality,

00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:18.220
hard work, perseverance and
confidence on the one hand

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:21.550
and the importance of
individual character for success

00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:22.530
on the other.

00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:24.524
They're not factual, but they are true

00:12:24.524 --> 00:12:27.980
in that they reflect American values.

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:30.620
Now, myths are not ordinary narratives.

00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:32.410
They themselves are ritualized.

00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:34.040
There's a number of language conventions

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:35.990
associated with myths.

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:38.157
There's often an
introduction that tells you,

00:12:38.157 --> 00:12:40.150
oh, I'm in the land of myth now.

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:41.160
I'm not supposed to believe

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:44.014
that there's actually fairy godmothers.

00:12:44.014 --> 00:12:45.841
Once upon a time,

00:12:45.841 --> 00:12:50.841
in the beginning, long, long
ago in a galaxy far away.

00:12:51.229 --> 00:12:53.150
(laughs)

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:56.110
Myths usually have repetitive elements.

00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:57.950
The toys asked three engines

00:12:57.950 --> 00:12:59.160
and it's the fourth engine

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:02.233
that manages to solve the problem.

00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:05.990
In the other children's
book, The Little Red Hen,

00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:07.580
the hen asks the other animals,

00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:09.790
who will help me plant the wheat?

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:10.850
Not I, said the pig,

00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:11.880
not I, said the cow,

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:12.950
not I, said the dog.

00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:15.633
This repetition is something
that's very common.

00:13:16.478 --> 00:13:19.170
And the morning and the
evening were the first day

00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:22.490
and the morning and the
evening were the second day.

00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:24.220
So there are linguistic conventions

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:27.030
that signal that you are
in the world of myth.

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:29.330
Another characteristic of
myth that sets it apart

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:30.660
from other narrative is that

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:34.670
it often deals with supernatural elements.

00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:37.550
Characters or circumstances

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:40.860
that would not be typically encountered.

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:44.570
Gods or demons or talking steam engines.

00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:47.130
Or as with the Horatio Alger myth,

00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:49.583
rich beneficiaries who appear

00:13:49.583 --> 00:13:50.970
(mumbles)

00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:52.743
To solve the problems for you.

00:13:55.143 --> 00:13:56.130
Until I was preparing this talk,

00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:58.720
I never actually looked at
the Horatio Alger books.

00:13:58.720 --> 00:13:59.767
They're awful.

00:13:59.767 --> 00:14:00.780
(laughs)

00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:03.360
I can kind of see why nobody
really reads them anymore

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:06.030
but everybody knows the Horatio Alger myth

00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:07.843
because the mythical continues

00:14:07.843 --> 00:14:12.623
even without the representation
in this series of books.

00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:17.230
But what usually happens
in the Horatio Alger books

00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:19.090
is you have this plucky poor boy

00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:20.500
who's working very, very hard,

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:23.500
but he's just a decent,
honest, wonderful person

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:25.567
and this rich man comes along

00:14:25.567 --> 00:14:28.450
and gives him a job and then he succeeds.

00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:32.680
Or the rich man comes along
and marries Ragged Dick

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:33.860
to his daughter or something.

00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:35.700
Yeah, like that's gonna happen real often,

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:39.783
but so there are supernatural
things that happen in myths.

00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:43.230
So since the topic of tonight is actually

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:45.263
the Creationism and Evolution Issue,

00:14:45.263 --> 00:14:49.313
how does myth relate to
creation and evolution?

00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:53.730
Well, Bible scholars have
ascertained that the old testament

00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:58.000
was written over a period of
centuries by many individuals

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.670
and was influenced by many factors.

00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:02.100
The two major religions.

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:05.040
There are two major religions
that consider it sacred.

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:07.570
Jews look at Genesis as establishing

00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:10.150
the descendants of Abraham
as the chosen people

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:13.240
and focus on the promise of
restoration of the Jewish people

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:14.790
to the promised land.

00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:16.330
Christians have a different focus,

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:19.960
which I'll discuss in more
detail later on in the talk.

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:23.220
But what did Genesis signify
to the ancient Hebrews

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:25.930
rather than to modern Christians and Jews?

00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:28.140
Several Christian and Jewish theologians

00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:30.650
have considered what the
Genesis creation story

00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:34.080
would have meant to the
people who set it down

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:38.360
2,500 to 3000 years ago.

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:39.533
Now, think about this.

00:15:39.533 --> 00:15:42.260
Who were the ancient Hebrews?

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.960
They were a pretty small tribe

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:47.730
in the middle of a very
busy part of the world.

00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:50.210
After all, the geographically
the Middle East

00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:52.310
is this crossroads of three continents.

00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:55.150
So there are a lot of
other tribal groups around

00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:59.760
and the Hebrews were this
little monotheistic dot

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:03.340
in the middle of all these
polytheistic religions.

00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:08.340
The Syrians, the
Babylonians, the Persians,

00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:11.530
the Egyptians, and worst of all,

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:15.420
all of these other, larger,
more powerful entities

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:18.834
periodically conquered the poor Hebrews.

00:16:18.834 --> 00:16:22.630
So you can imagine the
pressure on the Hebrews

00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:24.400
to maintain their monotheism

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:26.770
in the middle of all of this pressure

00:16:26.770 --> 00:16:30.760
from especially conquering
nations to adopt their religion,

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:33.400
to adopt their habits and so forth.

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:36.960
Maintaining monotheism
and avoiding syncretism

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:39.190
was the issue for the Hebrews.

00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:42.010
And it's all over the Old Testaments.

00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:44.000
Moses's commandments begin,

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.783
thou shalt have no other gods before thee.

00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:51.710
Well, this isn't a big issue
in the 20th and 21st century.

00:16:53.082 --> 00:16:56.100
It wasn't even a big issue
in the eighth century,

00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:59.410
but it was a real big issue
for the ancient Hebrews.

00:16:59.410 --> 00:17:01.300
In the King James
version, it's followed by,

00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:05.210
thou shalt not make unto
thee any graven image.

00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:06.220
Although we're not really big

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:08.470
into graven images these days either,

00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:12.730
but historically from the
standpoint of the ancient Hebrews,

00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:15.410
these were things that the
neighbors of the Hebrews

00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:19.500
were doing, the whole
business about the golden calf

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:22.453
when the tablets were being
brought down and so forth.

00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:27.330
Keeping their identity
as the chosen people,

00:17:27.330 --> 00:17:29.940
as the Hebrews as opposed to adopting

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:33.990
all of these cultural
practices of their neighbors.

00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:36.100
This was the big issue for the Hebrews.

00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:37.360
Now, how do people do this?

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:39.620
How do you keep your identity?

00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:42.060
Well, one way is through myth.

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:46.870
One way is through having
stories, having rituals,

00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:48.770
stories that are embedded into rituals

00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:50.860
that you can pass on to next generations

00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:54.460
that you can use to remind
the people in your group,

00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:57.010
in your tribe that this is who we are

00:17:57.010 --> 00:17:58.913
and this is why we are important.

00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:03.250
How does the creation story in Genesis

00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:06.253
tell us what was important
to the ancient Hebrews?

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:09.730
The late Presbyterian
theologian Conrad Hyres

00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:12.050
has I think, a very
interesting perspective

00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:15.300
on what Genesis might have
meant to the ancient Hebrews

00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:18.010
and he views it as a powerful myth

00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:21.000
in this symbolic sense that
I've been talking about myth.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.970
To remind the Jews that they were people

00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:24.860
who were indeed different
from their neighbors

00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:26.980
and better than their neighbors

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:30.930
because their God was the superior God

00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:34.430
and they were this powerful
God's chosen people.

00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:36.500
The ancient Hebrews distinguish themselves

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:39.150
from the neighbors and kept their identity

00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:41.830
by stressing in Genesis
the power of their God

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:43.450
over other gods.

00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:46.210
So on day one, God creates light

00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:47.930
and separates light from darkness.

00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:51.853
Thus are the gods of light
and darkness vanquished.

00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:56.460
On day two, God creates
the heavens and the earth.

00:18:56.460 --> 00:19:00.160
Thus vanquishing sky gods and earth gods.

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:04.410
On day three, God creates the
oceans, lands and vegetation,

00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:07.823
thus making sea and vegetation
divinities redundant.

00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:12.230
Day four, God creates
the sun, moons and stars,

00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:14.610
therefore establishing his superiority

00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:17.680
over the deities associated
with those heavenly bodies,

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:19.780
which were of course widely worshiped

00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:22.630
by the people surrounding the Hebrews.

00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:24.970
Days five and six, he
takes away the divinity

00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:28.370
of the animal kingdom, and
by creating people specialty,

00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:32.610
he takes away the divine
origin of kings and Pharaohs.

00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:37.350
Ramesses, you're not the
son of Rah, God created you.

00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:39.330
So our God can whoop your God

00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:41.320
is kind of what this is all about.

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:44.680
The sixth day creation
story establishes Yahweh

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:49.250
as the one true divinity,
superior to all of the other gods.

00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:52.441
The rest of Genesis, which
is largely the Abraham story,

00:19:52.441 --> 00:19:54.740
establishes the special relationship

00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:57.650
between the descendants
of Abraham, the Jews

00:19:57.650 --> 00:20:00.603
and this very powerful omnipotent God.

00:20:01.490 --> 00:20:03.750
So the six-day Hebrew creation story

00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:06.363
also symbolizes the nature of God.

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:09.060
The Hebrew God was ever present,

00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:11.630
unlike the Sumerians or Mesopotamian gods,

00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:14.020
Yahweh didn't originate from the actions

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:17.010
of some other god or preexisting force.

00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:20.610
We're familiar with the Greeks whose gods

00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:21.443
had a lineage.

00:20:21.443 --> 00:20:25.080
Aronows begot Cronos, Cronos begot Zeus,

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:27.427
Zeus begot Athena and
all the rest of them.

00:20:27.427 --> 00:20:30.830
But the Hebrew God just is.

00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:33.310
He's been there since eternity.

00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:35.040
He doesn't have a genealogy.

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:37.270
He doesn't even have a biography.

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:38.370
He just is.

00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:41.680
He's this very powerful,
omnipotent individual.

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:44.480
He wills the universe into being

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:47.070
unlike the Mesopotamian or Sumerian gods

00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:49.480
that require preexisting materials

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:51.730
to be formed into the universe,

00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:54.470
God can just say poof, do it.

00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:56.270
God is moral.

00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:58.410
God knows good and evil.

00:20:58.410 --> 00:20:59.670
The neighboring gods,

00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:01.700
if you really take a
look at the Greek gods,

00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:03.530
which is what we're most familiar with

00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:05.400
probably in our culture,

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:06.710
we don't pay a whole lot of attention

00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:08.000
to Sumerian gods anymore,

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.150
but we just study Greek mythology.

00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:12.740
The Greek gods really seemed to govern

00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:15.750
in a universe without purpose or meaning.

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:19.891
But God is moral, he knows good and evil.

00:21:19.891 --> 00:21:24.300
The universe does have purpose
and meaning to the Hebrews.

00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:26.950
God is not part of nature,
but stands outside of it

00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:30.260
as its creator which again
contest very strongly

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:33.490
with the more animistic aspects

00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:35.040
of the neighboring polytheists.

00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:38.830
Genesis thus best reflects
the Hebrew view of nature

00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:41.030
and of God, but it also represents

00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:42.580
a different view of humankind

00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:44.700
and that held by their neighbors.

00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:48.100
God specially creates Adam
and Eve, male and female.

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:50.555
He created them in his image.

00:21:50.555 --> 00:21:51.950
(mumbles)

00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:53.270
So people are special.

00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:55.490
They are moral beings like their creator.

00:21:55.490 --> 00:21:57.550
They have a purpose like their creator.

00:21:57.550 --> 00:21:59.400
They're not just random things

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:01.780
at the whim of idiosyncratic gods

00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:03.810
and of course this is all tied in

00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:06.363
with the idea of the Jews
being the chosen people.

00:22:07.463 --> 00:22:10.870
To the ancient Hebrews, then
Genesis is about polytheism

00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:13.370
versus monotheism and religious syncretism

00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:15.310
versus cultural independence.

00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:16.960
Genesis is a powerful myth

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:18.900
symbolizing issues of life and death,

00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:21.070
importance to the ancient Hebrews.

00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:25.700
It is this mythic symbolism
for modern Christians and Jews.

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:26.750
I'm sorry.

00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:30.150
Genesis has mythic symbolism
for modern Christians and Jews

00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:32.150
for different reasons,
which I will talk about

00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:33.340
a little bit later.

00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:36.084
It's not about talking snakes.

00:22:36.084 --> 00:22:37.750
It's not about...

00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:40.080
It's not meant to be taken literally.

00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:43.520
It's myth with all the power and truth

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:46.783
to a people's culture
that myth represents.

00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:50.290
Genesis certainly isn't about science

00:22:50.290 --> 00:22:52.620
and whether humans shared common ancestry

00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:54.192
with other organisms.

00:22:54.192 --> 00:22:57.410
But what about myth and
science or myth and evolution?

00:22:57.410 --> 00:23:00.260
You often hear Phillip
Johnson from Boalt Hall

00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:04.560
once said that evolution
is the new myth of America.

00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:06.590
The new mythology or the myth of evolution

00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:08.300
has replaced the myth of Genesis

00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:11.020
or sciences is the modern mythology, etc.

00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:14.610
Well, what about sciences
myth or evolution as myth.

00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:16.710
In the sense that I've
been using myth obviously

00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:20.823
as a symbolic representation
of the values of a people.

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:24.780
Now, as I did with myth,
I need to define science.

00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:26.350
So you at least know what I mean

00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:28.200
when I'm talking about science today.

00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:31.190
You may be surprised
to hear a scientist say

00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:33.173
that science is limited way of knowing.

00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:37.010
It is limited in that we're
only trying to explain

00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:38.810
the natural world.

00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:41.030
We're not trying to explain everything

00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:43.550
that human beings are interested in.

00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:47.540
I cannot prove to you
scientifically that Mozart

00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:50.190
is better than Madonna or that the Beatles

00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:52.130
are better than Bieber.

00:23:52.130 --> 00:23:53.370
Those are not scientists...

00:23:53.370 --> 00:23:57.000
Questions of aesthetics are
certainly not scientific issues

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.130
and there are many other issues

00:23:59.130 --> 00:24:03.010
that need to be resolved,
matters of opinion,

00:24:03.010 --> 00:24:04.990
dealing with values and ideologies.

00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:07.700
They're not going to be
resolved by science either.

00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:10.310
Whether Mr. Kavanaugh should be confirmed

00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:13.560
as a supreme court justice
isn't a matter of science.

00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:16.000
We could use logical arguments,

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.200
we could talk about musical complexity

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:21.200
when talking about the Beatles
or talking about Bieber

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:24.553
but that's not the same thing as science.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.980
We could look at Mr.
Kavanauh's judicial record

00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:30.928
on some issue or another but that's not...

00:24:30.928 --> 00:24:33.780
The fact that you are using
empirical evidence and logic

00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:35.170
doesn't mean you're using science

00:24:35.170 --> 00:24:36.970
because empirical evidence and logic

00:24:36.970 --> 00:24:38.973
is part of critical thinking in general.

00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:43.410
I like to think of
science as the application

00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:45.790
of critical thinking, if you will,

00:24:45.790 --> 00:24:47.763
to explaining the natural world.

00:24:49.090 --> 00:24:54.090
So science is limited to
explaining the natural world

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:55.860
and there's a second limitation

00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:58.230
and that is that we're restricted

00:24:58.230 --> 00:25:02.090
to explaining the natural
world through natural processes

00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:05.800
and unlike what many people think,

00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:10.800
this limitation of science to
only using natural processes

00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:13.710
isn't because all scientists are atheists

00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:14.876
because they aren't.

00:25:14.876 --> 00:25:19.080
It's because the essence of science

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:22.370
is testing our explanations
against the natural worlds.

00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:23.816
And when you think about it,

00:25:23.816 --> 00:25:26.950
how do you test an explanation?

00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:29.570
Notice science communication fans.

00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:31.240
I don't use the word experiment

00:25:32.090 --> 00:25:34.030
because when people hear
the word experiment,

00:25:34.030 --> 00:25:36.250
they think of somebody in
a laboratory doing this

00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:38.520
and they don't think of
these graduate students

00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:43.210
in IB out in the field who
may also be doing experiments.

00:25:43.210 --> 00:25:44.980
So I talk about tests

00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:46.560
because there are a lot of different ways

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:48.030
we can test our explanations.

00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:51.420
So the essence of testing an explanation

00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:55.040
has to do with holding
constant some variables

00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:57.440
and then letting other variables go

00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:59.963
so you can see whether
your explanation holds.

00:26:01.090 --> 00:26:03.620
Because science is about testing

00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:06.370
because testing is about
holding constant variables,

00:26:06.370 --> 00:26:08.290
we're stuck with natural causes

00:26:08.290 --> 00:26:11.423
because those are the only
kinds we can hold constant.

00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:14.730
My good friend Bill Thwait once suggested

00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:16.620
if we can only invent a theometer,

00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:20.390
then we can perhaps test
supernatural explanations

00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:21.930
but we don't have a theometer

00:26:21.930 --> 00:26:24.600
so we're stuck with natural causes

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:27.543
because those are the kinds
that we can hold constant.

00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:32.360
So science turns out to be a method

00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:34.110
or procedure that one follows

00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:37.010
to find out how the natural world works.

00:26:37.010 --> 00:26:41.160
To operate as myth, science
has to reflect important values

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:42.770
or ideologies of a people.

00:26:42.770 --> 00:26:44.370
So does it?

00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:46.050
Well if you're a scientist,

00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:48.820
and there are some of us in the audience,

00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:51.723
you know that there are
values within science.

00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:55.500
There are values you're
supposed to reflect

00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:56.650
if you do science.

00:26:56.650 --> 00:26:57.890
You don't ignore the data

00:26:57.890 --> 00:27:01.064
that disagrees with your explanation.

00:27:01.064 --> 00:27:05.730
You have to be truthful in
reporting your procedures

00:27:05.730 --> 00:27:08.510
and results so you have to be
willing to change your mind

00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:11.060
with new data or theory and so on.

00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:14.050
But that isn't especially
specific to science.

00:27:14.050 --> 00:27:15.896
I would expect the same kinds of values

00:27:15.896 --> 00:27:19.356
from an accountant, frankly.

00:27:19.356 --> 00:27:22.290
Those are values within science.

00:27:22.290 --> 00:27:25.760
They're not values that
science can symbolize.

00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:27.460
There is another reason why I don't think

00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:31.090
science makes good myth
and that is that science

00:27:31.090 --> 00:27:33.960
doesn't reflect any particular culture.

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:36.810
When you think about it,
science, this methodology,

00:27:36.810 --> 00:27:38.860
this practice of explaining
the natural world

00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:41.690
through testing occurs in cultures

00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:44.090
and people all over the planet

00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:47.130
from individualistic cultures
like the United States

00:27:47.130 --> 00:27:51.350
to more communitarian
cultures like China or India,

00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:54.083
but they all do science the same way.

00:27:54.970 --> 00:27:57.305
Science doesn't reflect the culture.

00:27:57.305 --> 00:27:59.060
Well, okay.

00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:01.030
The science studies people
will say, yes it does

00:28:01.030 --> 00:28:04.840
but remember, I'm speaking
at a very general level here.

00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:08.350
In general, there are certain
rules you have to follow.

00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:11.320
If you don't test your explanation,

00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:13.600
you're not going to get it
published in Science Magazine

00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:16.750
and PNS and the other outlets.

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:20.900
Your colleagues in science

00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:22.680
aren't going to trust your results

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:26.110
if you don't follow the
rules of collecting data,

00:28:26.110 --> 00:28:29.123
being honest about it, being
open about it, etc, etc.

00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:33.930
Science has values itself

00:28:33.930 --> 00:28:38.930
but science is a very
international kind of behavior,

00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:40.913
if you will.

00:28:40.913 --> 00:28:45.020
So it really doesn't reflect
the values of a culture

00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:47.923
or there's no such thing as
the values of all culture.

00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:50.490
So because science is a method,

00:28:50.490 --> 00:28:54.160
I don't think it makes very good myth.

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:57.230
There is another reason why
science doesn't make good myth

00:28:57.230 --> 00:28:59.663
and that is because science is,

00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:03.115
it's an open ended kind of explanation.

00:29:03.115 --> 00:29:07.220
There's a core group
of scientific concepts

00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:09.870
that we've tested and
tested and tested and tested

00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:11.820
and they're really not going to change.

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:16.710
That the earth goes around the sun.

00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:19.680
Heliocentrism is here to stay.

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:21.910
We're not really going
to test that anymore.

00:29:21.910 --> 00:29:23.130
The earth is spherical

00:29:23.130 --> 00:29:26.460
regardless of what the flat
earthers are saying these days.

00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:28.170
Living things have common ancestors,

00:29:28.170 --> 00:29:29.280
laws of thermodynamics.

00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:31.540
There are things that we
don't change our minds about

00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:32.700
but there's a lot of things

00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:34.710
that we're still trying to figure out

00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:37.710
and it's perfectly
acceptable within science

00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:40.300
to change our minds
about our explanations.

00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:43.413
That's a feature, not a bug.

00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:47.815
A good friend of mine Met
Kurtmel was once asked,

00:29:47.815 --> 00:29:51.020
why did you become a scientist?

00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:55.647
And he wrote, "As an adolescent,
I aspired to lasting fame.

00:29:55.647 --> 00:29:57.267
"I craved factual certainty

00:29:57.267 --> 00:29:59.697
"and I thirsted for a
meaningful vision of human life,

00:29:59.697 --> 00:30:02.227
"so I became a scientist."

00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:06.733
This is like becoming an
archbishop so you can meet girls.

00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:15.100
So science is continually changing

00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:17.700
though again, that doesn't
mean that it's unreliable

00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:21.280
because there are these
core concepts of science

00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:22.740
that really don't change,

00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:25.770
but the open-endedness, the
changeability of science,

00:30:25.770 --> 00:30:27.970
although it is very valuable

00:30:27.970 --> 00:30:29.727
for understanding the natural world,

00:30:29.727 --> 00:30:32.833
makes science very poor myth.

00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:37.100
Ashley Montagu once described science

00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:41.523
as truth without certainty,
which I like that phrase a lot.

00:30:42.770 --> 00:30:45.520
The values and truths of a culture's myth,

00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:48.110
needs stability and continuity.

00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:49.520
Science doesn't give you that.

00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:51.570
So science really doesn't make good myth.

00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:55.730
So I would conclude that
science is very good

00:30:55.730 --> 00:30:58.720
for explaining the natural
world, but it's lousy myth.

00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:01.510
However powerful and
inspiring science can be,

00:31:01.510 --> 00:31:05.810
it can't in itself produced
culturally sustaining myths.

00:31:05.810 --> 00:31:06.980
Well, what about evolution?

00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:08.340
Is it mythical?

00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:10.710
Can evolution symbolize a worldview

00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:12.480
or values important to us?

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:14.570
Let's take a look at evolution.

00:31:14.570 --> 00:31:17.020
Evolution is a three part idea.

00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:18.810
There's the big idea of evolution,

00:31:18.810 --> 00:31:21.430
which is that living things
have common ancestors.

00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:23.810
We and all other living
things on the planet

00:31:23.810 --> 00:31:27.080
have descended with modification
from common ancestors.

00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:29.130
There's also the patterns of evolution.

00:31:29.130 --> 00:31:32.659
How did the tree of life split and branch

00:31:32.659 --> 00:31:35.900
and die through time?

00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:39.340
There's also the mechanisms
or processes of evolution.

00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:41.310
The factors that bring about evolution

00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:44.060
and of course these are
things like natural selection,

00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:48.440
nonselective methods, development
and so forth and so on,

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:50.230
speciation and the like.

00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:53.080
Now, evolution consists of the big idea,

00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:54.690
the pattern and the process.

00:31:54.690 --> 00:31:57.610
Let's take a look at each
of these components in turn

00:31:57.610 --> 00:32:00.880
and consider how they work as myth

00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:02.830
or whether they could function as myth.

00:32:03.762 --> 00:32:06.146
Well, when we look at
patterns of evolution,

00:32:06.146 --> 00:32:10.080
I think we see very
little mythic inspiration.

00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:12.680
Whether pandas are bears or raccoons

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:14.950
or whether the thanksgiving Turkey

00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:18.140
is descended from a dinosaur
isn't going to be much use

00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:20.422
in symbolizing cultural values.

00:32:20.422 --> 00:32:24.310
So certainly the patterns of
evolution isn't going to work.

00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:26.640
The mechanisms or processes of evolution,

00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:29.860
I think we have a little more
possibility for myth here

00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:32.363
especially the concept
of natural selection.

00:32:33.310 --> 00:32:36.460
There's a rather long history of ideology

00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:40.000
seizing on natural selection
to support their views.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.810
Capitalists like Andrew Carnegie

00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:43.810
promoted evolution by natural selection

00:32:43.810 --> 00:32:45.480
to promote capitalism.

00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:48.010
Henry Russell Wallace was a socialist.

00:32:48.010 --> 00:32:52.160
He supported his views
with natural selection.

00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:54.410
Peter Kropotkin argued for anarchy

00:32:54.410 --> 00:32:56.690
using evolution and natural selection

00:32:56.690 --> 00:32:59.283
and Vernon Kellogg argued for pacifism.

00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:02.700
Now think about that.

00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:04.913
Capitalism, socialism,
anarchy and pacifism.

00:33:06.690 --> 00:33:09.800
These all are inspired
by natural selection.

00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:12.330
It's kind of like the
blind man and the elephant.

00:33:12.330 --> 00:33:14.090
They're sort of taking what they want

00:33:14.090 --> 00:33:15.660
to support their particular point of view.

00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:17.788
I think the ideology comes first

00:33:17.788 --> 00:33:21.890
and these men and others following them,

00:33:21.890 --> 00:33:24.600
are taking a powerful scientific idea

00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:28.120
and using it to support their
particular ideological views.

00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:30.010
But I don't think
there's anything inherent

00:33:30.010 --> 00:33:32.140
in natural selection that would lead you

00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:35.963
to either capitalism,
socialism, pacifism or anarchy.

00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:39.052
So I would argue that despite efforts,

00:33:39.052 --> 00:33:42.490
natural selection, other
mechanisms of evolution

00:33:42.490 --> 00:33:44.860
don't really work as myth either.

00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:48.070
Well, what about the big
idea of common ancestry?

00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:51.370
Okay, here's where we
get some mythic purchase.

00:33:51.370 --> 00:33:55.030
The idea that we and all living
things have common ancestors

00:33:55.030 --> 00:33:58.500
is a very powerful scientific idea

00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:01.850
and it's also a very
powerful philosophical idea.

00:34:01.850 --> 00:34:04.700
It also happens to be
scientifically correct

00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:07.830
because given all the
evidence that we have,

00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:11.040
I'd contend that the most
powerful element in evolution

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:14.110
as mythic is its ability to provide us

00:34:14.110 --> 00:34:15.900
a sense of place in the universe,

00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:18.870
a view of where we as human
beings and individuals

00:34:18.870 --> 00:34:21.173
stand relative to everything else.

00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:26.520
On the other hand, myths
are often reflective

00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:30.960
of moral values and ethical
values in the society

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:35.100
and common ancestry just
like all the rest of science

00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:38.393
isn't very good as a moral guide.

00:34:40.170 --> 00:34:44.823
Science tells you that coyotes
kill rats and house cats.

00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:48.890
It doesn't tell you whether
that is good or bad.

00:34:48.890 --> 00:34:50.740
As Thomas Henry Huxley said,

00:34:50.740 --> 00:34:53.960
science tells you what
is not what should be.

00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:56.190
If you believe that because
something is natural,

00:34:56.190 --> 00:34:57.480
it is therefore good,

00:34:57.480 --> 00:35:00.150
you need to think that
through a little further.

00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:02.228
Hueman said it even before Huxley.

00:35:02.228 --> 00:35:05.670
Ought does not follow from is.

00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:08.490
There are both theistic
as well as nontheistic

00:35:08.490 --> 00:35:10.490
uses of evolution as myth.

00:35:10.490 --> 00:35:12.440
Let's look at some of
the theistic versions.

00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:14.813
First beginning with the creationists.

00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:18.900
Now creationists follow
a more conservative form

00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:22.660
of Christianity than do Catholics
or mainstream protestants.

00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:24.280
Modern conservative Christians,

00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:26.910
don't look at Genesis like
the ancient Hebrews did.

00:35:26.910 --> 00:35:30.070
To them, Genesis isn't
about maintaining monotheism

00:35:30.070 --> 00:35:32.790
and identifying the Jews
as the chosen people.

00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:35.000
Christianity in general is more concerned

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.850
with the new testament and creationists

00:35:37.850 --> 00:35:39.170
look at the old testament

00:35:39.170 --> 00:35:42.040
as foreshadowing the appearance of Christ.

00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:45.030
To conservative Christians,
God creates a perfect world

00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:47.800
and perfect humans in the garden of Eden.

00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:49.190
People are special to God

00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:51.840
and are required to worship and obey him.

00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:53.720
The disobedience of Adam and Eve

00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:57.250
for eating from the tree of
the knowledge of good and evil

00:35:57.250 --> 00:35:59.192
causes them to be sent out from the garden

00:35:59.192 --> 00:36:03.520
to make their own way, and
that brings pain and suffering

00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:05.040
and death into the world, which of course

00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:07.840
were not present in the garden of Eden.

00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:09.810
The separation from God is felt to be

00:36:09.810 --> 00:36:14.230
the greatest punishment
and it is only reversed

00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:16.330
according to conservative Christians,

00:36:16.330 --> 00:36:18.800
by the sacrifice of Jesus who dies

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:20.890
to atone for the sin of Adam.

00:36:20.890 --> 00:36:24.480
In fact, Paul in the new
testament refers to Jesus

00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:27.890
as the new Adam and the second Adam.

00:36:27.890 --> 00:36:29.220
To conservative Christians,

00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:32.120
the old testament is
firmly connected to the new

00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:33.670
and events of the old testament

00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:35.730
are necessary for the coming of Jesus

00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:38.780
and of course with the
sacrifice of Jesus on the cross,

00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:40.720
salvation is restored.

00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:43.530
So to Christians, Genesis
is really important

00:36:43.530 --> 00:36:45.650
and it is mythic in a very different way

00:36:45.650 --> 00:36:48.270
than it was to the ancient Hebrews.

00:36:48.270 --> 00:36:50.110
As religiously conservative Christians

00:36:50.110 --> 00:36:52.710
creationists believed that
the bible is not only true,

00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:54.910
but it is a unified whole.

00:36:54.910 --> 00:36:56.970
In this cartoon from answers in Genesis,

00:36:56.970 --> 00:36:59.777
the reader says, "The six
day creation issue in Genesis

00:36:59.777 --> 00:37:01.047
"isn't important to scripture.

00:37:01.047 --> 00:37:02.970
"I'll just take the six days out."

00:37:02.970 --> 00:37:07.630
And finds that the whole
bible unravels as a result.

00:37:07.630 --> 00:37:09.760
So anything that challenges Genesis,

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:11.671
challenges the entire bible.

00:37:11.671 --> 00:37:15.090
Genesis to revelations is all one piece

00:37:15.090 --> 00:37:16.780
and evolution is incompatible

00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:18.560
with the literal reading of Genesis.

00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:20.350
That's just full stop.

00:37:20.350 --> 00:37:22.870
If an individual
interprets the bible as six

00:37:22.870 --> 00:37:26.650
24 hour days of creation,
a short period of time ago,

00:37:26.650 --> 00:37:31.650
that cannot be accommodated
with any science really,

00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:33.600
but certainly not with evolution,

00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:36.453
but that is not the
mainstream Christian theology.

00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:41.100
So if evolution is true,
believe conservative Christians,

00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:44.580
then Genesis and the entire
bible have to be false.

00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:46.690
That means there's no God,
and if there's no God,

00:37:46.690 --> 00:37:49.010
there is no salvation.

00:37:49.010 --> 00:37:52.380
There's a direct line from the
creation to the sin of Adam

00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:54.140
to the death of Jesus on the cross,

00:37:54.140 --> 00:37:55.790
to the possibility of redemption

00:37:55.790 --> 00:37:58.420
and salvation and revelations.

00:37:58.420 --> 00:38:02.030
A child who accepts evolution
is endangering his very soul.

00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:03.850
They will not be saved.

00:38:03.850 --> 00:38:07.410
So it's not difficult to see
why parents object so strongly

00:38:07.410 --> 00:38:10.070
to evolution being taught in schools.

00:38:10.070 --> 00:38:12.360
In addition to the loss
of salvation though,

00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:15.040
they believe that without
religion to guide us,

00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:16.800
we will not behave morally

00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:19.453
with terrible consequences for society.

00:38:21.070 --> 00:38:23.180
Without God, there's no
morality, they believe

00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:25.010
so people will not know how to act.

00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:28.640
The caption says, if this is
what Johnny can read and write,

00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:29.840
then this news shows

00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:32.313
that Johnny really
understands his lessons.

00:38:33.810 --> 00:38:36.350
Without the bible and God as moral rudder,

00:38:36.350 --> 00:38:38.843
they believe we will have no guidance.

00:38:42.130 --> 00:38:44.690
This is one of my favorite graphics

00:38:44.690 --> 00:38:46.403
from the creationist literature.

00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:51.810
It is from an old conference
of younger creationists

00:38:51.810 --> 00:38:55.050
held in the 1990s and you can see here

00:38:55.050 --> 00:39:00.050
very dreadful things on the
branches of this tree of evil.

00:39:00.398 --> 00:39:04.950
Racism, humanism, paganism,
nazi-ism, abortion,

00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:09.880
euthanasia, drug culture,
radical feminist movement.

00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:11.173
Terrible things.

00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:14.540
And evolution is the foundation

00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:17.930
for all of these terrible societal ills.

00:39:17.930 --> 00:39:20.270
And here's the creation science message

00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:22.920
that's going to get rid of evolution

00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:25.180
and therefore society will be restored

00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:28.093
to a more edenic, a more proper form.

00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:33.410
Henry Morris is the most
important creationist

00:39:33.410 --> 00:39:35.520
of the 20th century, more so

00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:38.090
than William Jennings Bryan
ever dreamed of becoming.

00:39:38.090 --> 00:39:39.401
And he has written,

00:39:39.401 --> 00:39:42.757
"Evolution is at the
foundation of communism,

00:39:42.757 --> 00:39:45.667
"fascism, freudianism, social darwinism,

00:39:45.667 --> 00:39:49.860
"behaviorism, kinsism,
materialism, atheism

00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:54.133
and in the religious word,
modernism and neo orthodoxy.

00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:57.700
Now, nobody laughed.

00:39:57.700 --> 00:40:00.180
I once many years ago gave a talk

00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:02.522
at Lexington Theological Institute.

00:40:02.522 --> 00:40:04.653
Lexington Theological Seminary,

00:40:04.653 --> 00:40:08.013
which is a protestant seminary
in Lexington, Kentucky

00:40:09.381 --> 00:40:12.740
and I showed this over the top graphic

00:40:12.740 --> 00:40:15.410
and I read that quote by Henry Morris

00:40:15.410 --> 00:40:18.900
and I got to the part about
modernism and neo orthodoxy

00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:20.280
and they were on the floor.

00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:22.790
They thought that was the
funniest thing they'd ever heard.

00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:27.240
I mean that has never been
before or since a laugh line,

00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:29.820
but it was to these seminarians.

00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:31.390
They thought that that
was the funniest thing

00:40:31.390 --> 00:40:33.030
that they heard in a long time.

00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:36.230
Now, modernism and neo orthodoxy

00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:38.990
refers to two schools
of Christian theology,

00:40:38.990 --> 00:40:42.830
which religiously conservative
Christians reject.

00:40:42.830 --> 00:40:45.360
Modernism arose out of 19th century

00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:47.890
biblical criticism where
the bible was viewed

00:40:47.890 --> 00:40:49.210
as a text like any other.

00:40:49.210 --> 00:40:50.630
The bible had a history,

00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:52.920
it consisted of a series of manuscripts

00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:55.420
which were written by different
people at different time.

00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:57.610
It was cobbled together,
there were contradictions.

00:40:57.610 --> 00:40:59.540
There were conferences where they decided

00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:02.250
which books to leave in,
which ones to leave out

00:41:02.250 --> 00:41:05.760
and once you understand that
the bible has a history,

00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:09.690
it wasn't just dictated by
the Almighty to ascribe,

00:41:09.690 --> 00:41:13.390
that makes you look at at your
holy text quite differently.

00:41:13.390 --> 00:41:15.520
And of course this is true

00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:20.030
of seminary trained religious
professionals in Christianity.

00:41:20.030 --> 00:41:23.585
The bible is a human document
with a history and errors.

00:41:23.585 --> 00:41:25.960
You treat it differently
than if you believe

00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:29.000
that every word was dictated by God.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.440
Now, like all academic disciplines,

00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:33.620
Christian theology has a very large number

00:41:33.620 --> 00:41:34.940
of intellectual movements

00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:37.973
of which modernism in the
orthodoxy are only two.

00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:41.820
Very many postmodernists
theological movements

00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:44.060
incorporate evolution and other sciences

00:41:44.060 --> 00:41:45.500
into their theology.

00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:47.590
Process theology is a view held

00:41:47.590 --> 00:41:49.883
by the catholic theologian, John Haught.

00:41:50.730 --> 00:41:53.640
Those of you who are
Kitzmiller versus Dover fans

00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:56.870
might recognize a Jack Haught

00:41:56.870 --> 00:42:00.600
as the theologian that we brought in

00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:05.010
as a witness for the good
guy side, if I may say so.

00:42:05.010 --> 00:42:06.660
He was incredibly articulate.

00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:08.832
He was very impressive
and the judge mentioned,

00:42:08.832 --> 00:42:13.220
how enlightening he felt that

00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:15.483
John Haught's testimony was.

00:42:16.810 --> 00:42:19.583
A very famous geneticist
named Theodocius Dbjohnski,

00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:23.320
a Russian man who came
to the United States

00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:26.140
many, many years ago a wrote an article,

00:42:26.140 --> 00:42:28.890
the title of which has become
an aphorism in biology.

00:42:28.890 --> 00:42:31.510
He said, nothing in biology makes sense

00:42:31.510 --> 00:42:33.160
except in the light of evolution.

00:42:34.020 --> 00:42:36.470
Well, Jack Haught has written
that nothing in theology

00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:39.363
makes sense except in
the light of evolution.

00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:43.416
Regarding creation and process theology,

00:42:43.416 --> 00:42:47.270
God did not create in six
days and rest on the seventh

00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:50.370
rather than creatio ex nihalo

00:42:50.370 --> 00:42:52.270
rather than creation from nothing,

00:42:52.270 --> 00:42:56.600
they believe in creatio
continuo, continuous creation.

00:42:56.600 --> 00:43:00.330
God continues to create through
the process of evolution.

00:43:00.330 --> 00:43:03.050
So the world and the universe
is expected to change

00:43:03.050 --> 00:43:06.250
rather than to remain
static after six days.

00:43:06.250 --> 00:43:09.020
Process theology is quite
accepting of evolution

00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:11.089
and here is where the mythic potential

00:43:11.089 --> 00:43:14.320
is well expressed among theorists.

00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:16.501
Lutheran, theologian, Philip Hefner,

00:43:16.501 --> 00:43:19.360
who is just as jolly as
he looks in that picture.

00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:23.430
He's a delightful man
also looks at human beings

00:43:23.430 --> 00:43:26.890
as having been created by God
in the sense of having emerged

00:43:26.890 --> 00:43:29.160
through the process of evolution

00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:31.176
but that creation continues

00:43:31.176 --> 00:43:33.200
through the process of evolution.

00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:36.640
When Phillip talks about Imago Dei

00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:39.270
the image of God, he's expressing the idea

00:43:39.270 --> 00:43:43.160
that as God is creative,
so are human beings.

00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:45.130
We creative creatures are made

00:43:45.130 --> 00:43:47.070
in the image of a creative God.

00:43:47.070 --> 00:43:50.353
So humans, thus are co-creators with God,

00:43:50.353 --> 00:43:53.150
which gives us considerable opportunity

00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:57.060
and consequent responsibility
to affect both ourselves

00:43:57.060 --> 00:43:58.787
as well as the other organisms

00:43:58.787 --> 00:44:01.233
with which we share this planet.

00:44:02.130 --> 00:44:04.440
Ted Peters, who is a Lutheran theologian

00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:08.010
at the Lutheran School of
Religion here in Berkeley

00:44:08.010 --> 00:44:10.850
and Martinez Hewlett
share some of these views,

00:44:10.850 --> 00:44:13.680
especially that creation continues.

00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:15.883
It didn't stop after six days.

00:44:15.883 --> 00:44:19.550
They also contend that much
as evolutionary biology

00:44:19.550 --> 00:44:22.360
has both adaptive evolution
through natural selection

00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:26.830
as well as neutral evolution
through genetic drift

00:44:26.830 --> 00:44:29.760
that God can create both through design

00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:31.180
as well as through chance,

00:44:31.180 --> 00:44:33.670
and they don't believe
that God is controlling

00:44:33.670 --> 00:44:37.310
every single little random
element in the universe.

00:44:37.310 --> 00:44:41.742
That God allows the universe
to evolve along a path.

00:44:41.742 --> 00:44:44.840
At the Center for Theology
and the Natural Sciences

00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:45.980
around the corner from here,

00:44:45.980 --> 00:44:48.860
Robert John Russell also
has written extensively

00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:50.430
of the role of chance in evolution

00:44:50.430 --> 00:44:53.090
and how it's compatible
with this view of God.

00:44:53.090 --> 00:44:55.785
Now, these theologians
take a very different view

00:44:55.785 --> 00:44:59.670
on subjects like sociobiology or stem cell

00:44:59.670 --> 00:45:01.746
or genetic modification research

00:45:01.746 --> 00:45:05.460
as God's created co-creators.

00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:07.770
We have the ability to affect evolution,

00:45:07.770 --> 00:45:10.210
hence, these theologians
spend a lot of time

00:45:10.210 --> 00:45:12.690
talking about the moral and ethical issues

00:45:12.690 --> 00:45:15.120
regarding science and
human responsibility.

00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:17.013
But they totally accept the science.

00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:21.133
There is no rejection of
evolution of the science.

00:45:21.967 --> 00:45:23.640
A couple of interesting
people are Michael Dowd

00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:26.800
and Connie Barlow who are
the evangelists for evolution

00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:29.400
and that they are ministers.

00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:32.520
They deliberately take the
sweep of the epic of evolution

00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:35.640
and turn it to theological purposes.

00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:38.030
Their position is that our common ancestry

00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:41.020
with all other human
beings makes us indeed

00:45:41.020 --> 00:45:43.600
our brother's keepers and
that we should be doing

00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:46.560
our utmost to make the lives
of our fellow human beings

00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:50.340
healthier, more educated
and more comfortable.

00:45:50.340 --> 00:45:52.560
Social justice issues also come into play.

00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:55.690
We need to live in a more
just and peaceful world.

00:45:55.690 --> 00:45:58.380
The common ancestry of humans
with all other creatures

00:45:58.380 --> 00:46:01.040
makes us kin to our
fellow living organisms

00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:03.370
and gives us a responsibility to them

00:46:03.370 --> 00:46:05.950
and the planet on which we all depend.

00:46:05.950 --> 00:46:08.240
Evolution places humans in nature

00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:09.940
in a very different way than does

00:46:09.940 --> 00:46:13.340
the interpretation of Genesis
called dominion theology.

00:46:13.340 --> 00:46:18.340
If you remember in genesis,
God gives Adam and Eve,

00:46:19.370 --> 00:46:23.270
mostly Adam dominion over the animals

00:46:23.270 --> 00:46:26.560
but he also tells them
to steward the garden

00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:29.415
and some Christians emphasize
the stewardship theology,

00:46:29.415 --> 00:46:32.683
some emphasize the dominion theology.

00:46:34.050 --> 00:46:37.450
And theists are not alone
in finding that evolution

00:46:37.450 --> 00:46:40.520
has a great deal to say
about their faith tradition.

00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:43.420
There is a huge amount
of Christian theology

00:46:43.420 --> 00:46:46.930
around evolution, compatible
with their view of God

00:46:46.930 --> 00:46:48.573
and God's action in the world.

00:46:49.604 --> 00:46:53.740
Now, non theists, people
who do not believe in God,

00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:55.420
materialists of various kinds

00:46:55.420 --> 00:46:58.810
have also used evolution
from mythic representation

00:46:58.810 --> 00:47:00.870
at least as much if not more

00:47:00.870 --> 00:47:03.250
than have Christian theologians.

00:47:03.250 --> 00:47:05.970
Religious naturalism is one manifestation

00:47:05.970 --> 00:47:08.800
of how evolution is used to
provide a sense of purpose

00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:10.160
and meaning and place in nature,

00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:13.960
but within a scientific rather
than a theistic context.

00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:16.670
Religious naturalists often will embrace

00:47:16.670 --> 00:47:19.500
other human enterprises
in addition to science

00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:21.750
such as literature, art or music

00:47:21.750 --> 00:47:24.940
in a quest for meaning and worldview.

00:47:24.940 --> 00:47:28.360
Biologists Ursula Goodenough's,
Sacred Depths of Nature

00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:29.440
is an example of this

00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:33.070
and looks at the history of the
universe chapter by chapter.

00:47:33.070 --> 00:47:35.140
She starts with the big
bang and works all the way

00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:37.310
through formation of the planet,

00:47:37.310 --> 00:47:39.870
evolution of living things
on earth and human evolution.

00:47:39.870 --> 00:47:42.160
And then in a separate
section of the book,

00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:46.810
she talks about her
personal interpretations

00:47:46.810 --> 00:47:49.570
in a spiritual sense of what this sweep

00:47:49.570 --> 00:47:51.770
of the epic of evolution means to her

00:47:51.770 --> 00:47:54.730
in terms of her view
of her place in nature.

00:47:54.730 --> 00:47:57.190
As Darwin himself said,
there is grand jury

00:47:57.190 --> 00:47:59.000
in this view of life

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:02.010
which the religious naturalists embrace.

00:48:02.010 --> 00:48:05.280
Now, most religious
naturalists are naturalists

00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:07.380
in the sense that they are not theists.

00:48:07.380 --> 00:48:11.250
They don't include the
concept of the supernatural,

00:48:11.250 --> 00:48:14.150
although there are some
theists within the movement.

00:48:14.150 --> 00:48:18.060
But the theists who are
embracing religious naturalism

00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:20.494
tend to be from the deistic
end of the spectrum.

00:48:20.494 --> 00:48:23.688
Their god is not god that interacts

00:48:23.688 --> 00:48:27.420
and intervenes very much in the world.

00:48:27.420 --> 00:48:30.270
Religious naturalists seemed
to share certain values

00:48:30.270 --> 00:48:32.273
inspired by the epic of evolution.

00:48:33.167 --> 00:48:35.860
The common origins of all living things

00:48:35.860 --> 00:48:38.373
suggest that there is
a unity to all of life.

00:48:39.310 --> 00:48:43.520
Religious naturalists
rarely, I haven't seen one,

00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:45.750
embrace the idea of human exceptionalism.

00:48:45.750 --> 00:48:50.200
Humans are rather embedded
within this matrix

00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:51.690
of other living creatures

00:48:51.690 --> 00:48:55.063
that are this product of
evolution just as are we.

00:48:55.930 --> 00:48:58.683
Obviously there is a
strong ecological component

00:48:58.683 --> 00:49:01.960
to most religious
naturalism and of course,

00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:05.330
it grows out of this
idea of common ancestry

00:49:05.330 --> 00:49:06.870
with all other things.

00:49:06.870 --> 00:49:09.310
Similarly, since all humans

00:49:09.310 --> 00:49:12.200
are closely related to one another

00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:14.280
and descended from common ancestors,

00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:17.010
relatively recently, we
have a responsibility

00:49:17.010 --> 00:49:19.930
to our fellow human beings to indeed

00:49:19.930 --> 00:49:21.580
be our brother's keeper.

00:49:21.580 --> 00:49:23.540
For religious naturalists,

00:49:23.540 --> 00:49:25.700
I think the strongest expression of myth

00:49:25.700 --> 00:49:30.020
is to be provided again,
providing a sense of place

00:49:30.020 --> 00:49:31.680
in the universe.

00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:33.670
Because of the epic of evolution,

00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:35.680
they believe you are a human being

00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:37.890
who is part of a web of connectedness

00:49:37.890 --> 00:49:39.490
with every other living thing

00:49:39.490 --> 00:49:41.550
and are composed of the same stardust

00:49:41.550 --> 00:49:43.740
that makes up the cosmos.

00:49:43.740 --> 00:49:45.750
Evolution does this for nonbelievers

00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:49.230
substituting for religiously based myths.

00:49:49.230 --> 00:49:51.100
The biologist E.O. Wilson has said

00:49:51.100 --> 00:49:53.660
the evolutionary epic is
probably the best myth

00:49:53.660 --> 00:49:56.660
we will ever have and he's not using myth

00:49:56.660 --> 00:49:58.183
as a synonym for falsehood.

00:49:59.275 --> 00:50:00.890
So what does this have to do

00:50:00.890 --> 00:50:03.340
with the creation and evolution conflicts?

00:50:03.340 --> 00:50:06.840
That was a lot of stuff about
myths, science and religion.

00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:09.050
So let's get back to what I promised you

00:50:09.050 --> 00:50:10.633
I would talk about eventually.

00:50:11.580 --> 00:50:14.690
First of all, there
remains a lot of opposition

00:50:14.690 --> 00:50:17.062
to evolution by our fellow citizens.

00:50:17.062 --> 00:50:19.850
The science and engineering indicators

00:50:19.850 --> 00:50:22.680
is a national research council document

00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:25.500
that's put out every two
years and they survey

00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:27.890
adult Americans and their
views of a number of things

00:50:27.890 --> 00:50:31.500
including questions about evolution.

00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:33.640
They tested a revised version

00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:36.690
of the evolution question in 2012.

00:50:36.690 --> 00:50:38.615
First asking the traditional question,

00:50:38.615 --> 00:50:40.960
human beings as we know them today,

00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:43.110
developed from earlier species of animals

00:50:43.110 --> 00:50:47.060
and they got the traditional
response about 48%.

00:50:47.060 --> 00:50:51.030
Then in the same with
another part of the sample,

00:50:51.030 --> 00:50:54.010
they inserted according to evolution

00:50:54.010 --> 00:50:55.450
human beings as we know them today,

00:50:55.450 --> 00:50:58.153
developed from earlier
species of animals, 72%.

00:51:01.430 --> 00:51:05.620
So this suggests that people
know what evolution is

00:51:05.620 --> 00:51:07.093
but they're not buying it.

00:51:09.670 --> 00:51:11.640
The National Center for Science Education

00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:13.810
tracks anti-science legislation,

00:51:13.810 --> 00:51:15.882
anti evolution, anti climate change,

00:51:15.882 --> 00:51:19.490
legislation, science standard
controversies every year.

00:51:19.490 --> 00:51:21.640
2018 wasn't a real banner year.

00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:24.070
It's only a handful of
bills and controversies.

00:51:24.070 --> 00:51:27.710
2017 was a banner year,
a whole lot longer list.

00:51:27.710 --> 00:51:29.530
Fortunately, only two of these past,

00:51:29.530 --> 00:51:31.291
although that's two, too many.

00:51:31.291 --> 00:51:33.630
Problems surrounding the
teaching of evolution

00:51:33.630 --> 00:51:35.690
is a separate topic that I don't have time

00:51:35.690 --> 00:51:38.220
to go into it today, but suffice to say

00:51:38.220 --> 00:51:41.000
that NCSE continues to have its hands full

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:43.190
coping with these challenges.

00:51:43.190 --> 00:51:45.750
If you ask creationists
why they reject evolution,

00:51:45.750 --> 00:51:48.210
they'll give you one or
more of three reasons.

00:51:48.210 --> 00:51:50.070
We call them the pillars of creationism.

00:51:50.070 --> 00:51:52.158
They don't believe it's
supported by science,

00:51:52.158 --> 00:51:54.180
they don't believe that evolution

00:51:54.180 --> 00:51:56.600
is compatible with their religious views

00:51:56.600 --> 00:51:59.832
and it's only fair to teach
evolution and creationism

00:51:59.832 --> 00:52:03.510
because so many people
don't want evolution taught.

00:52:03.510 --> 00:52:05.240
A variant of the fairness argument

00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:07.360
is that it's good pedagogy.

00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:09.160
Give the students creation and evolution

00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:10.140
and let them decide.

00:52:10.140 --> 00:52:12.190
And this is a critical thinking argument.

00:52:13.510 --> 00:52:14.860
That's not a good argument.

00:52:16.380 --> 00:52:19.620
If we were going to try to
persuade the creationists

00:52:19.620 --> 00:52:22.550
that their children should
learn evolution in school,

00:52:22.550 --> 00:52:23.850
how would you go about it?

00:52:25.220 --> 00:52:28.250
Well, it's true that the
science of creation science

00:52:28.250 --> 00:52:30.259
is really wrong.

00:52:30.259 --> 00:52:32.910
I mean I love talking
about creation science

00:52:32.910 --> 00:52:36.203
because it is so broke and
the science is just so zany.

00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:38.970
They believe that Grand Canyon,

00:52:38.970 --> 00:52:43.970
all 4,000 layers of
sediment in Grand Canyon,

00:52:44.230 --> 00:52:48.100
sandstones, siltstone,
limestone, mudstone,

00:52:48.100 --> 00:52:49.863
all kinds of different layers,

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:55.250
4,000 feet of layers,
thousands of different beds

00:52:55.250 --> 00:52:56.740
that all of that was laid down

00:52:56.740 --> 00:52:59.370
by the receding waters of Noah's flood.

00:52:59.370 --> 00:53:04.370
And then this huge ditch
of what, about 200 miles

00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:07.360
was cut catastrophically
by a huge body of water

00:53:07.360 --> 00:53:09.730
that rushed through and miraculously

00:53:09.730 --> 00:53:12.690
cut all this wet sediment
and left it standing

00:53:12.690 --> 00:53:14.300
as opposed to just sort of slumping over,

00:53:14.300 --> 00:53:16.500
which is what you'd expect
wet stuff to do anyway.

00:53:16.500 --> 00:53:18.470
Anyway, the science is nuts.

00:53:18.470 --> 00:53:21.160
I mean there is no known geology

00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:23.440
that would fit this model of Grand Canyon

00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:26.650
and that would be true of their astronomy

00:53:26.650 --> 00:53:27.626
and everything else.

00:53:27.626 --> 00:53:31.080
NCSE has got lots of resources

00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:33.313
as to why creation science is bad.

00:53:35.265 --> 00:53:39.270
But you know, arguing factual information

00:53:39.270 --> 00:53:43.600
is not actually going to
persuade a creationist

00:53:43.600 --> 00:53:46.110
that their science is bad

00:53:47.050 --> 00:53:49.523
because that's not the
most important issue.

00:53:50.540 --> 00:53:53.550
There is considerable literature
studying decision making

00:53:53.550 --> 00:53:56.040
that contends that factual information,

00:53:56.040 --> 00:53:58.270
while not irrelevant, is not primary

00:53:58.270 --> 00:54:00.220
and persuading people
to change their minds.

00:54:00.220 --> 00:54:02.530
And I talked about this
in more detail yesterday.

00:54:02.530 --> 00:54:04.630
If you were here yesterday, thank you.

00:54:04.630 --> 00:54:06.870
I'm not going to repeat
it, but in general,

00:54:06.870 --> 00:54:10.950
for our purposes, lots of these concepts

00:54:12.180 --> 00:54:14.740
from the psychology of belief literature

00:54:14.740 --> 00:54:18.080
explaining why factual
knowledge is rejected,

00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:22.030
they all deal with looking
at factual knowledge

00:54:22.030 --> 00:54:24.210
through an ideological values

00:54:24.210 --> 00:54:26.230
or a group identification filter.

00:54:26.230 --> 00:54:29.040
And the filter comes first and usually,

00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:32.730
that keeps the correct
information, shall we say,

00:54:32.730 --> 00:54:34.113
from being accepted.

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:37.710
Values, ideology and identification

00:54:37.710 --> 00:54:41.720
are precisely the elements of myth.

00:54:41.720 --> 00:54:44.820
Myth is powerful and creationism is mythic

00:54:44.820 --> 00:54:46.900
in exactly this fashion.

00:54:46.900 --> 00:54:49.530
It reinforces the values, ideology

00:54:49.530 --> 00:54:52.460
and identification of
conservative Christians.

00:54:52.460 --> 00:54:54.780
It's not a surprise then that creationists

00:54:54.780 --> 00:54:56.990
are resistant to accepting evolution.

00:54:56.990 --> 00:55:00.130
If evolution is true, they lose big.

00:55:00.130 --> 00:55:04.003
Obviously they're not going
to just suddenly decide.

00:55:07.870 --> 00:55:10.036
Still, evolution needs to be taught

00:55:10.036 --> 00:55:13.920
so that students are
scientifically literate.

00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:15.820
How can we make this happen?

00:55:15.820 --> 00:55:19.560
I see a short term solution
and a longterm solution.

00:55:19.560 --> 00:55:22.930
The longterm solution relies
on evolution, if you will,

00:55:22.930 --> 00:55:25.460
that like the rest of Christianity,

00:55:25.460 --> 00:55:27.980
conservative Christians
will gradually moderate

00:55:27.980 --> 00:55:30.360
their views regarding evolution.

00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:32.300
The National Center for Science Education

00:55:32.300 --> 00:55:33.920
Voices for Evolution book

00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:36.410
lists statements from
religious organizations

00:55:36.410 --> 00:55:38.890
and other institutions that encourage

00:55:38.890 --> 00:55:40.990
the teaching of evolution in schools.

00:55:40.990 --> 00:55:43.100
These are catholic and
mainstream protestants

00:55:43.100 --> 00:55:44.792
and Jewish groups.

00:55:44.792 --> 00:55:47.870
Theistic evolution, the
theological position

00:55:47.870 --> 00:55:51.130
that evolution occurred, it
was part of God's plan, etc

00:55:51.130 --> 00:55:53.910
is the majority view
in Christianity today.

00:55:53.910 --> 00:55:57.020
It's the theologically
conservative denominations

00:55:57.020 --> 00:55:59.000
that have problems with evolution.

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:01.540
Most Baptists, Pentecostalists,

00:56:01.540 --> 00:56:05.330
Holiness groups, Charismatics,
Seventh Day Adventists,

00:56:05.330 --> 00:56:07.990
Jehovah's witnesses, and the like.

00:56:07.990 --> 00:56:10.110
But this is not a solid block.

00:56:10.110 --> 00:56:13.270
There are evangelical Christians
who have worked diligently

00:56:13.270 --> 00:56:16.000
to see that evolution gets
taught in their local communities

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:18.870
and some national
evangelical organizations

00:56:18.870 --> 00:56:21.390
that are very friendly to evolution.

00:56:21.390 --> 00:56:24.800
Biologos is an online evangelical
Christian organization

00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:27.880
and they discuss a variety
of views of evolution,

00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:29.740
believing that it can be harmonized

00:56:29.740 --> 00:56:31.920
with their version of Christianity.

00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:34.230
They talk about the
harmony between science

00:56:34.230 --> 00:56:37.380
and biblical faith as we present

00:56:37.380 --> 00:56:40.290
an evolutionary understanding
of God's creation.

00:56:40.290 --> 00:56:42.407
Another evangelical Christian organization

00:56:42.407 --> 00:56:44.750
is the American Scientific Affiliation

00:56:44.750 --> 00:56:46.090
which similarly supports

00:56:46.090 --> 00:56:48.053
the teaching of evolution in schools.

00:56:49.010 --> 00:56:52.630
The longterm solution to
the anti evolution problem

00:56:52.630 --> 00:56:54.633
in the United States is
for these organizations

00:56:54.633 --> 00:56:57.900
and others and individually
evangelical Christians

00:56:57.900 --> 00:57:00.370
to influence their fellow
conservative Christians

00:57:00.370 --> 00:57:04.200
and persuade them that one
can be a faithful evangelical

00:57:04.200 --> 00:57:06.200
and still accept evolution.

00:57:06.200 --> 00:57:09.120
The way that Biologos or
the ASA would phrase it,

00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:13.283
is that they take the bible
seriously, but not literally.

00:57:15.110 --> 00:57:16.950
The short term situation.

00:57:16.950 --> 00:57:19.923
The short term solution
is to call a truce.

00:57:20.790 --> 00:57:23.020
The big fear of conservative Christians

00:57:23.020 --> 00:57:24.850
is that when their children
are taught evolution,

00:57:24.850 --> 00:57:27.233
they're taught therefore there is no God.

00:57:28.595 --> 00:57:30.960
A number of years ago, a friend of mine

00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:33.720
who was teaching biological anthropology

00:57:33.720 --> 00:57:37.340
at a community college in the southeast,

00:57:37.340 --> 00:57:38.673
we were talking on the phone

00:57:38.673 --> 00:57:41.623
and she said that she had
these kids in her class.

00:57:43.030 --> 00:57:45.510
Young adults, these students
that are undergraduates

00:57:45.510 --> 00:57:49.700
in her class had never
learned evolution at all.

00:57:49.700 --> 00:57:50.533
Full stop.

00:57:50.533 --> 00:57:52.240
Their are teachers they'd
just skip those chapters.

00:57:52.240 --> 00:57:54.040
These kids were tabula rasa.

00:57:54.040 --> 00:57:55.630
The only thing they knew about evolution

00:57:55.630 --> 00:57:58.210
was what they learned on
the street, so to speak.

00:57:58.210 --> 00:58:01.560
This is college, this is
physical anthropology, right?

00:58:01.560 --> 00:58:03.600
So day one you get evolution

00:58:03.600 --> 00:58:06.520
and so she just taught her
class matter of factly,

00:58:06.520 --> 00:58:09.720
like she taught anyplace else

00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:11.790
and after a couple of weeks,

00:58:11.790 --> 00:58:14.240
a couple of these kids came
to talk to her after class

00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:19.010
and they said, well, of course
species change through time.

00:58:19.010 --> 00:58:20.483
You mean that's evolution?

00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:25.400
We thought evolution meant
you can't believe in God.

00:58:28.110 --> 00:58:32.970
I have lots and lots of stories
like that from high school

00:58:32.970 --> 00:58:34.833
as well as university teachers.

00:58:36.370 --> 00:58:40.370
So I would like to assuage
the concerns of parents

00:58:40.370 --> 00:58:42.320
that when their kid walks into,

00:58:42.320 --> 00:58:44.710
especially a high school classroom,

00:58:44.710 --> 00:58:46.430
there is not a teacher there saying,

00:58:46.430 --> 00:58:48.290
okay, take your religion and shove it.

00:58:48.290 --> 00:58:49.540
This just doesn't happen.

00:58:50.710 --> 00:58:53.910
Survey research has
shown that K-12 teachers

00:58:53.910 --> 00:58:57.790
show the same range of religious adherence

00:58:57.790 --> 00:58:58.760
as other Americans.

00:58:58.760 --> 00:59:00.600
In other words, they're highly religious

00:59:00.600 --> 00:59:03.820
about 80 plus percent
of them believe in God,

00:59:03.820 --> 00:59:05.160
most of them are Christian.

00:59:05.160 --> 00:59:08.310
It's highly unlikely
that high school teachers

00:59:08.310 --> 00:59:11.510
are telling kids that they have to choose

00:59:11.510 --> 00:59:13.600
between their faith and science.

00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:16.463
That just is something that
they shouldn't worry about.

00:59:19.290 --> 00:59:21.290
The truce is that students,

00:59:21.290 --> 00:59:24.510
even those whose parents
don't accept evolution,

00:59:24.510 --> 00:59:26.413
need to understand evolution

00:59:26.413 --> 00:59:28.880
in order to be scientifically literate

00:59:29.790 --> 00:59:32.180
and if we can assuage the concerns

00:59:32.180 --> 00:59:34.280
of conservative Christian
parents that indeed,

00:59:34.280 --> 00:59:35.790
no one is telling their children

00:59:35.790 --> 00:59:38.500
that they have to give up
their faith to study science,

00:59:38.500 --> 00:59:42.480
we may be able to teach evolution
with reduced opposition.

00:59:42.480 --> 00:59:46.630
We teach good science at the
college and high school level

00:59:46.630 --> 00:59:50.080
and we leave the door open
to a believing student

00:59:50.080 --> 00:59:52.840
for that student to
engage with that science

00:59:52.840 --> 00:59:54.663
however that student wishes.

00:59:56.040 --> 00:59:59.670
I was talking with a
high school teacher today

00:59:59.670 --> 01:00:01.207
who was a graduate student here

01:00:01.207 --> 01:00:03.969
and he was mentioning,
we were talking about

01:00:03.969 --> 01:00:06.560
how do you deal with the students

01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:07.530
who come into your class

01:00:07.530 --> 01:00:09.640
and the fingers are
wedged tightly in the ear

01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:10.582
because they're afraid

01:00:10.582 --> 01:00:12.988
that they're going to have
to believe in evolution

01:00:12.988 --> 01:00:15.210
when they hear you talk.

01:00:15.210 --> 01:00:17.540
And his solution was one that I've heard

01:00:17.540 --> 01:00:20.340
from many, many teachers and
I think it's very effective.

01:00:20.340 --> 01:00:24.940
His solution was to say, okay,
I just want you to learn it.

01:00:24.940 --> 01:00:26.980
You can accept it or
reject it, that's your call

01:00:26.980 --> 01:00:29.730
but you need to learn it and
you need to pass the test.

01:00:30.770 --> 01:00:32.900
And those weren't his words,

01:00:32.900 --> 01:00:36.140
but you basically can hear the
fingers fly out of the ears

01:00:36.140 --> 01:00:38.150
with a loud popping noise

01:00:38.150 --> 01:00:40.150
because the students all of a sudden go,

01:00:40.150 --> 01:00:41.350
I don't have to believe.

01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:44.780
An interesting thing happens.

01:00:44.780 --> 01:00:45.983
The students find out that evolution

01:00:45.983 --> 01:00:48.140
doesn't actually hurt them.

01:00:48.140 --> 01:00:50.090
Of course, species change through time.

01:00:51.060 --> 01:00:53.950
They find that evolution doesn't mean

01:00:53.950 --> 01:00:54.990
you can't believe in God.

01:00:54.990 --> 01:00:57.750
Evolution means that living
things have common ancestors.

01:00:57.750 --> 01:00:59.612
And look, we can show you the genetic

01:00:59.612 --> 01:01:01.725
and other evolutionary processes

01:01:01.725 --> 01:01:04.750
which bring this change about

01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:07.960
which is a very different
view than they came in.

01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:09.830
But they can't listen to the science

01:01:09.830 --> 01:01:13.350
as long as they've got the
fingers stuck firmly in the ears.

01:01:13.350 --> 01:01:18.350
Getting the fingers out of
the ears is a major need.

01:01:18.610 --> 01:01:21.070
So we on the teaching side of things,

01:01:21.070 --> 01:01:23.835
whether college or K-12,
teach good science,

01:01:23.835 --> 01:01:26.130
leave the door open to students of faith

01:01:26.130 --> 01:01:27.950
to continue believing if they choose.

01:01:27.950 --> 01:01:31.770
It's not the job of the K-12
or the college professor

01:01:31.770 --> 01:01:35.088
to change the religious views of students.

01:01:35.088 --> 01:01:38.950
That said, I've been in the
creation and evolution business

01:01:38.950 --> 01:01:43.560
for long enough to know that
there are no quick fixes.

01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:46.720
We are in this for the long haul.

01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:48.757
The longterm change is
going to take a while

01:01:48.757 --> 01:01:51.890
and so will the short term change.

01:01:51.890 --> 01:01:54.010
And because there aren't any quick fixes,

01:01:54.010 --> 01:01:56.040
the National Center for Science Education

01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:58.090
is in it for the long haul too.

01:01:58.090 --> 01:02:00.910
Please do go to the website ncse.com.

01:02:00.910 --> 01:02:02.690
You're going to find
a lot more information

01:02:02.690 --> 01:02:05.910
on the creation and evolution controversy

01:02:05.910 --> 01:02:08.730
as well as the parallel one
over teaching climate change

01:02:08.730 --> 01:02:11.420
and you'll find some very good suggestions

01:02:11.420 --> 01:02:13.220
for what you can do about it,

01:02:13.220 --> 01:02:16.050
including joining the National
Center for Science Education,

01:02:16.050 --> 01:02:17.930
which I hope you will do.

01:02:17.930 --> 01:02:20.730
Again, children's
stories not withstanding,

01:02:20.730 --> 01:02:22.780
I was very highly honored this year

01:02:22.780 --> 01:02:24.450
to be a Hitchcock lecturer

01:02:24.450 --> 01:02:26.650
and I thank you very much
for coming to hear me

01:02:26.650 --> 01:02:28.340
on this really quite lovely day.

01:02:28.340 --> 01:02:29.338
Thank you.

01:02:29.338 --> 01:02:31.588
(applause)

01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:38.330
- Unless you've been a biology teacher,

01:02:38.330 --> 01:02:42.663
subject to the pressures of
parents and administrators,

01:02:43.630 --> 01:02:46.530
you could not truly appreciate

01:02:46.530 --> 01:02:50.720
what Eugenie Scott's NCSE has done

01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:55.460
for high school, public
school science education.

01:02:55.460 --> 01:02:59.392
She deserves every accolade
that she's received.

01:02:59.392 --> 01:03:01.642
(applause)

01:03:06.930 --> 01:03:11.860
- If I may, there is no way
that I as one individual

01:03:11.860 --> 01:03:14.830
have been able to accomplish
all the wonderful things

01:03:14.830 --> 01:03:18.990
NCSE has and there actually
are some NCSE staff

01:03:18.990 --> 01:03:21.610
and former staff in this room as we speak

01:03:21.610 --> 01:03:23.500
and if you wouldn't mind raising your hand

01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:24.550
to identify yourself.

01:03:24.550 --> 01:03:26.570
And that means you Eric.

01:03:26.570 --> 01:03:28.570
Thank you NCSE staff.

01:03:28.570 --> 01:03:29.705
(applause)

01:03:29.705 --> 01:03:31.583
Garrett David, Susan Glen.

01:03:33.100 --> 01:03:37.510
- My special concern are the creationists

01:03:37.510 --> 01:03:39.170
who are professionals,

01:03:39.170 --> 01:03:41.960
particularly those in engineering

01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:43.703
and the medical professions.

01:03:44.690 --> 01:03:48.000
When they put forth in their communities

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.320
against the teaching of evolution,

01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:52.150
they are respected simply because

01:03:52.150 --> 01:03:54.783
they're members of a respected profession.

01:03:55.970 --> 01:03:59.430
Unfortunately, those I have
talked to and listened to,

01:03:59.430 --> 01:04:01.940
do not understand science.

01:04:01.940 --> 01:04:05.070
Many people think that engineering schools

01:04:05.070 --> 01:04:08.293
and medical schools teach science.

01:04:09.790 --> 01:04:14.050
That's becoming true, but traditionally

01:04:14.050 --> 01:04:18.810
that has not been true and
they don't understand science

01:04:18.810 --> 01:04:22.420
and when you try to talk to
them, even your approach,

01:04:22.420 --> 01:04:26.690
they don't give you enough
respect to listen to you.

01:04:26.690 --> 01:04:28.160
So they become an impediment.

01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:31.230
A major impediment to
the kind of reasoning

01:04:31.230 --> 01:04:33.653
that has worked on most lay people.

01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:38.330
What can we do about this impediment?

01:04:38.330 --> 01:04:40.500
- I always think of American Society

01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:43.490
as basically being
divided into three parts,

01:04:43.490 --> 01:04:45.620
like goal I guess.

01:04:45.620 --> 01:04:50.530
There are people like me
who are very convinced

01:04:50.530 --> 01:04:53.370
by the science of evolution
and it takes a whole lot

01:04:53.370 --> 01:04:54.203
to shake that.

01:04:54.203 --> 01:04:56.210
I mean, we're pretty convinced.

01:04:56.210 --> 01:04:57.840
Probably most of the people in this room

01:04:57.840 --> 01:04:59.240
are in that category.

01:04:59.240 --> 01:05:01.180
There are those, like you were describing

01:05:01.180 --> 01:05:04.040
who are very committed anti-evolutionists

01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:08.480
for mostly well religious
reasons of various kinds,

01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:11.040
but most Americans are in the middle.

01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:13.930
They don't think about
science or religion very much

01:05:13.930 --> 01:05:16.010
but they don't belong to denominations

01:05:16.010 --> 01:05:18.980
that require them interpret
the bible literally.

01:05:18.980 --> 01:05:21.330
That is really the target population.

01:05:21.330 --> 01:05:23.278
That is really the group I think

01:05:23.278 --> 01:05:27.070
that it is most useful to
spend your time talking to

01:05:27.070 --> 01:05:30.900
because they are more
open to understanding

01:05:30.900 --> 01:05:33.960
the science and understanding
how science works

01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:36.280
and by the way, I agree with you.

01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:37.680
I concur with you completely

01:05:39.110 --> 01:05:42.210
on the difference between
applied scientists

01:05:42.210 --> 01:05:45.290
like engineers and physicians
versus research scientists.

01:05:45.290 --> 01:05:48.430
The concept of how science
works is really quite different

01:05:48.430 --> 01:05:50.080
in both of those groups

01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:56.480
but let's keep that
group from sliding down

01:05:57.490 --> 01:05:59.100
into the anti evolution side

01:05:59.100 --> 01:06:03.244
and help them understand
what a really wonderful,

01:06:03.244 --> 01:06:07.330
life enriching phenomenon science is

01:06:07.330 --> 01:06:11.350
and evolution within sciences
is a really fascinating field

01:06:11.350 --> 01:06:14.080
and communicating some of that excitement

01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:16.580
I think can help keep that middle group

01:06:16.580 --> 01:06:20.790
from absorbing some of
the erroneous information

01:06:20.790 --> 01:06:25.410
that is being produced
by this group down here.

01:06:25.410 --> 01:06:26.510
Yes sir.

01:06:26.510 --> 01:06:28.140
- I want to thank you,
thank you, thank you

01:06:28.140 --> 01:06:32.423
for this very important presentation.

01:06:33.370 --> 01:06:35.870
One of the things that I'm
not sure people are aware of

01:06:35.870 --> 01:06:37.710
is that right here in Berkeley

01:06:37.710 --> 01:06:41.200
and you mentioned the
Ted Peters and others

01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:43.090
that we have in Berkeley,

01:06:43.090 --> 01:06:46.990
probably the largest
group of theology schools

01:06:46.990 --> 01:06:50.651
in the country and we need
to make these connections

01:06:50.651 --> 01:06:54.970
between the schools of
theology and the universities.

01:06:54.970 --> 01:06:58.690
And so people who might be interested...

01:06:58.690 --> 01:07:00.400
So Ted Peters who you mentioned

01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:02.490
is going to be the main organizer

01:07:02.490 --> 01:07:06.360
of this coming summer's
institute on religion

01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:08.200
in the nature of science meeting.

01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:11.480
It's gonna be him with some
of the new genetics things

01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:12.690
that Ted Peters is gonna do.

01:07:12.690 --> 01:07:14.490
So that's IRIS, the Institute on Religion.

01:07:14.490 --> 01:07:17.560
Anybody who's interested
in that can talk to me

01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:19.460
and the other one you mentioned

01:07:19.460 --> 01:07:23.290
Ursula Goodenough, is the main creator

01:07:23.290 --> 01:07:24.840
of a new organization.

01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:28.850
This is an online organization
with lots of talk.

01:07:28.850 --> 01:07:33.120
Ursula's the creator of
Religious Naturalism Association.

01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:36.490
So if anybody wants to
join that email group,

01:07:36.490 --> 01:07:39.940
you can see me afterwards and
I can add you to the list.

01:07:39.940 --> 01:07:41.080
So thank you, thank you.

01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:42.770
- Thank you for that information.

01:07:42.770 --> 01:07:43.603
Yes sir.

01:07:46.290 --> 01:07:47.123
- I'm Lawrence.

01:07:47.123 --> 01:07:48.810
I was expecting to speak a little more

01:07:48.810 --> 01:07:50.560
about the climate change issue

01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:53.520
and not totally about
evolution, but that's fine.

01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:55.000
- I did more of that yesterday.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:55.833
- Yes.

01:07:57.010 --> 01:08:00.930
Well I'm thinking that there's a group

01:08:00.930 --> 01:08:04.410
for disrupting the whole concept of time

01:08:04.410 --> 01:08:08.440
which is shared by both the religionists

01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:11.790
and the scientists here, which is that

01:08:11.790 --> 01:08:14.190
causalities moves forward,
things in the past

01:08:14.190 --> 01:08:16.910
cause things in the future.

01:08:16.910 --> 01:08:20.500
Once you get down into deep science,

01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:23.410
you can see that causality
could go both ways

01:08:23.410 --> 01:08:25.960
and there's the deep
question of consciousness

01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:28.820
and that once one gets into these deep

01:08:28.820 --> 01:08:31.400
philosophical scientific issues,

01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:33.630
it's going to provide a disruption

01:08:34.690 --> 01:08:38.360
completely to the common
concept of time here.

01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:40.830
See some major changes in all this thing,

01:08:40.830 --> 01:08:43.903
but I really enjoy your covering it

01:08:43.903 --> 01:08:47.800
at this level of shared concept of time.

01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:48.960
- Thank you.

01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:50.600
Yes ma'am.

01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:51.460
- Thank you so much.

01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:53.053
It was really inspiring.

01:08:54.190 --> 01:08:59.190
My question is more how can
we get scientists to do more

01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:04.520
to engage this middle group
that you were talking about?

01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:09.380
I was on Sunday at an open house

01:09:09.380 --> 01:09:12.390
or whatever you want to
call it, off the IGI,

01:09:12.390 --> 01:09:15.630
the Innovative Genomics
Institute here in Berkeley

01:09:15.630 --> 01:09:19.010
and it was fascinating,
absolutely fascinating

01:09:19.010 --> 01:09:24.010
how they did this in a
way that engaged families

01:09:24.350 --> 01:09:26.140
even with small children,

01:09:26.140 --> 01:09:28.970
to show them how they could extract DNA

01:09:28.970 --> 01:09:30.770
from strawberries, for example,

01:09:30.770 --> 01:09:35.770
how they could build DNA with
using little marshmallows

01:09:36.130 --> 01:09:39.530
and licorice strings and
so on and toothpicks.

01:09:39.530 --> 01:09:43.030
And I thought, what a great approach.

01:09:43.030 --> 01:09:45.630
You know, they had
planned for two lab tours.

01:09:45.630 --> 01:09:49.190
They had to organize nine within
those two and a half hours

01:09:49.190 --> 01:09:50.950
or three hours that they were open.

01:09:50.950 --> 01:09:54.680
So what could the NCSE do

01:09:57.460 --> 01:10:00.680
to get more direct connection

01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:03.120
between these outstanding scientists

01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:08.120
and the public so that there
isn't this barrier, this fear?

01:10:10.780 --> 01:10:11.613
Thank you.

01:10:11.613 --> 01:10:12.840
- Thank you.

01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:17.320
Yes I love the idea of scientists
reaching out to the public

01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:19.520
and I think it's something
that's increased.

01:10:20.420 --> 01:10:23.840
In the last 10 years
has seen a huge change

01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:27.070
in precisely that

01:10:27.070 --> 01:10:30.180
The AAAS, the American Association

01:10:30.180 --> 01:10:31.370
for the Advancement of Science.

01:10:31.370 --> 01:10:32.780
They publish Science Magazine.

01:10:32.780 --> 01:10:36.300
The largest professional
scientist organization

01:10:36.300 --> 01:10:41.300
in the world, probably
20,000 plus members.

01:10:41.850 --> 01:10:45.300
AAAS every year at its annual meeting

01:10:45.300 --> 01:10:50.300
has workshops and sessions
for helping scientists

01:10:51.580 --> 01:10:54.170
communicate their ideas
better with the public.

01:10:54.170 --> 01:10:56.670
They're really encouraging
this kind of outreach

01:10:56.670 --> 01:10:58.350
and I'd love to see it expand.

01:10:58.350 --> 01:11:01.193
I will remind everybody that I'm retired.

01:11:02.430 --> 01:11:03.600
I no longer...

01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:06.600
I can promote NCSE certainly,

01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:08.890
but I am not a decision maker there.

01:11:08.890 --> 01:11:13.520
So I can't speak for what they might do

01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:16.060
to encourage scientists to do more.

01:11:16.060 --> 01:11:20.960
My feeling is that NCSE has always been

01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:21.800
the mouse that roared.

01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:23.320
It's a very tiny organization

01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:25.870
that has a hugely disproportionate effect,

01:11:25.870 --> 01:11:28.650
mostly because we work with lots of allies

01:11:28.650 --> 01:11:30.100
and get them to do all the work

01:11:30.100 --> 01:11:32.380
but we're very important.

01:11:32.380 --> 01:11:35.370
But it's also a pretty tiny organization

01:11:35.370 --> 01:11:38.040
with a pretty tiny budget and it's limited

01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:39.413
with how much it can do.

01:11:40.620 --> 01:11:43.300
For them to try to develop
a scientist network

01:11:43.300 --> 01:11:47.320
to do the kind of very worthwhile
thing you're suggesting

01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:50.610
would I think require new staff,

01:11:50.610 --> 01:11:52.490
new budgeting and something that probably

01:11:52.490 --> 01:11:54.840
is not actually on their to do list.

01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:56.293
But I can't speak for them.

01:11:57.350 --> 01:11:59.203
Retired but not expired, right?

01:12:00.190 --> 01:12:01.970
Thank you so much for coming to hear me.

01:12:01.970 --> 01:12:03.111
I appreciate it.

01:12:03.111 --> 01:12:05.361
(applause)

01:12:08.196 --> 01:12:10.779
(upbeat music)
