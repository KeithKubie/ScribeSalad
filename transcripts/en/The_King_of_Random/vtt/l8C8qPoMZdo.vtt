00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.400
This might be a situation you never thought
could happen, but here you are cast away on

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.699
a deserted island with nothing but the clothes
on your back. In this project we'll be making

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:20.539
a survival fire by rubbing sticks together,
because if you can do that, you'll have a

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:23.199
much better chance of being found alive.

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.370
Looking around the island, the first thing
you notice are plenty of coconut trees and

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.960
at the base are some old coconut husks. Those
might come in handy. There's also plenty of

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.070
wood lying around, so you just need to find
a dry piece of a soft wood, like this branch

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.790
from a hibiscus tree. Hibiscus is a very lightweight
wood and when it's this dry, it's a great

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.770
choice. Your old coconut husk will make a
great tinder bundle because it's packed with

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.129
very fine fibers that should burn easily.
Ok, to prepare these sticks for a friction

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.200
fire, it's important that both sticks come
from the same branch. A sharp rock can be

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.140
used to fashion some of the wood into a long
narrow stick, cutting the tip of the stick

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.420
so that it's slanted at a 45ยบ angle on both
sides. When it's ready, it should look like

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.460
something like this. Now use your sharp rock
to carve a flat spot into the other piece

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.600
of wood, knocking it down until you've got
a surface at least 8 inches long, then make

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.850
a groove down the center to act as a track
for guiding the other stick. Ok, the last

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.909
step is to wedge anything you can find under
the base to help stabilize it, then go sit

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.659
down on the back. It's time for the action.
Taking the shorter stick in your one hand

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.389
like this, place your other hand overtop so
that the stick nestles in securely at the

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:44.920
base of your thumbs. Ok, when you've got the
tip set firmly in the grooved track, try pushing

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.139
it back and forth, keeping it at a 45ยบ angle
to the base. Not much pressure is needed yet,

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:53.929
so don't worry about putting too much effort
into it. When the heat of the friction builds

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:57.310
to where the wood is ready, you'll notice
a change in how it feels and might even see

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.389
a little smoke. At this point, push a little
faster, and use your strong hand to pull down,

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:06.130
adding pressure to the tip. You should see
a lot more smoke now, and bits of charred

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.500
wood dust starting to pile up at the top.
Put your back into it and increase the pressure,

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.110
making sure the tip is stopping just short
of the pile. It looks like you've got a little

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.420
ember burning now, but let's continue just
a little longer to be sure. Hopefully when

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.560
you stop it will keep smoking. Ok perfect,
you've got a nice little coal. Now, go turn

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.380
it into a flame. This is a good time to get
your coconut husk ready by pulling apart the

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.070
fibers. The fluffier they are, the better.
Transferring the coal is a delicate process,

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.840
so try pressing the husk right up to the coal,
then turn the ember base over and tap the

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.980
bottom with a stick to make sure all the embers
transfer out. Nice, your coal has been captured,

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.710
so loosely cover it over with more fibers
so that it's protected from the wind, and

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:50.260
continues to smolder. Patience is a virtue
here. You don't want to pinch it too tight

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.900
or you'll smother it out. Too loosely and
the fibers won't burn. The heat needs to build

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.350
slowly, so try to balance the amount of air
the coal is getting, with the quantity of

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.590
tinder it's exposed to. The amount of smoke
being generated is a good indication of how

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.000
well you're doing, and sometimes blowing gently
can help speed the process. When the smoke

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.280
is thick and you can start to feel the heat
radiating, it's time to get a little more

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.010
aggressive. Waive the bundle around to get
some more airflow, and blow right into the

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:20.450
center of the coals. Just a little more air
now, and success! There's your flame! The

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.560
hardest part is over, but don't pat yourself
on the back just yet because by the time you

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.420
add some wood shavings, your flame may be
going out. Not to worry though, because as

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.240
long as the smoke is thick, there's still
a good amount of heat, and the same techniques

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:36.590
can be used for blowing the coals back into
a flame. Well there you have it. Now you can

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.260
start a fire by rubbing sticks together, now
best of luck getting rescued. If you liked

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.340
