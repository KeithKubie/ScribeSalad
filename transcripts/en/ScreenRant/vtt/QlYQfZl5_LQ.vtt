00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.790
There's no denying that Marvel Comics have
made their superheroes just as famous on the

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.250
big screen as the comic book page - but it
didn't come without some problems.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.390
While the Avengers may be dominating the box
office, the X-Men churning out sequels and

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.520
spinoffs by the year, and even Deadpool becoming
a blockbuster hit, the road here isn't all

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:23.690
smooth sailing.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.410
And the worst moments can be hard to forget.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.470
Here are 10 Marvel Movie Moments That Outraged
Fans.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.880
Emo Spider-Man
The moment Tobey Maguire was cast as Peter

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.480
Parker was enough of a shock.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.640
But the actor pulled off the challenge in
two Spider-Man films, getting better from

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:37.640
one to the next.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.079
Then Spider-Man 3 happened, and Peter had
a bit of a personality crisis.

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:45.980
Director Sam Raimi was probably going for
some offbeat laughs, but the insane antics

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.760
of "emo Spider-Man" turned of most fans, and
helped kill the franchise fast.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.600
Jean Grey Kills Cyclops
Fans may have forgotten about Jean Grey going

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.710
crazy and murdering Professor X in X-Men 3,
since Bryan Singer apparently did, too, returning

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.600
him to life in Days of Future Past.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.590
But as bad as it was to see him killed, Cyclops
faced and even worse fate.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.780
The first two movies had failed to deliver
the eye-blasting leader fans knew and loved,

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.170
but why director Brett Ratner thought it was
smart to have Jean kill him off, in the first

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.780
minutes of the movie - OFF SCREEN - is a question
that can never be answered.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.410
Fantastic Four's Galactus
The first Fantastic Four may not have been

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.630
perfect, but it stopped short of making unforgivable
mistakes - something that can't be said for

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:27.630
the sequel.

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.080
We'll never know why anyone thought it wise
to put Jessica Alba in the worst blue contacts

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.869
and bleach-blonde wig we've ever seen, but
when the fan-favorite Marvel villain Galactus

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:39.479
became a cloud in space, the fans turned their
backs completely.

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.200
Fantastic Four's Final Fight
Why kill a movie franchise just once, when

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.490
you can pull it off twice?

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.619
Fans had nothing but hope for Josh Trank to
reinvent Marvel's Fantastic Family, but by

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:53.090
the time it released, reports of studio interference
and massive reshoots made it clear nobody

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.000
was happy with the movie going to theaters.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.939
There was plenty wrong with the reboot, but
the soulless, boring, and downright awful

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:03.960
final battle put the previous version of the
team to shame.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.899
Daredevil's Seesaw Battle
Star Ben Affleck may not have been the reason

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.810
that the Daredevil movie fell flat, but it's
hard to get fans to agree on what WAS... until

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.500
you mention the playground fight scene with
Elektra.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.190
In hindsight, a movie in which a woman fighting
a blind man on a see-saw seemed totally plausible

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.190
probably isn't going to be a hit with everyone.

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.760
The movie may have dumber moments, but it
was this scene that started the eyes rolling

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.500
until the final credits.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.170
The Mandarin
When it was announced that Tony Stark would

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.750
finally battle the evil Mandarin in Iron Man
3, Marvel fans were thrilled - or at least

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.540
curious to see how the studio would handle
the villain, originally a pretty obvious racial

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:38.540
stereotype.

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.510
The outrage started when Sir Ben Kingsley
was cast in the role, but the other shoe fell

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.120
when even his version was revealed to be the
performance of a bumbling actor - one massive

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.349
joke from director Shane Black that tons of
Marvel fans found anything but funny.

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:54.921
Storm vs. Toad
Look on any list of the worst comic book movie

00:02:54.921 --> 00:02:59.400
moments, or dumbest lines of dialogue, and
you're guaranteed to find Storm's lame zinger

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.520
("what happens to a toad when it's struck
by lightning).

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.670
Avengers director Joss Whedon has since claimed
credit for the line, meant as an actual joke,

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.290
and never intended to be read as a tough-talking
one-liner.

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.209
It might be the worst moment in Bryan Singer's
run on the mutant team, and it's one that

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.959
fans or critics will never forget.

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:21.430
Wolverine's Magic Bullet
What's the one thing that could make a clunky,

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.470
confused, cheesy Wolverine movie worse than
an absolute butchering of Deadpool?

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.400
How about delivering an Adamantium bullet
to the hero's brain, making sure he'd never

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.569
remember his own origin story.

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:35.319
Since it made the previous two hours completely
meaningless to the larger series, and actually

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:39.319
caused even MORE continuity problems, fans
were justified in hating what the studio had

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:42.239
done to one of its most beloved stars and
characters.

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:45.571
The Death of Coulson
After shining in a small Iron Man role, Agent

00:03:45.571 --> 00:03:49.540
Phil Coulson started moving up in the MCU,
becoming a full blown main cast member in

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.540
Iron Man 3 and The Avengers.

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.549
And just when fans couldn't love Coulson or
actor Clark Gregg any more, he got his most

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:59.840
badass moment standing up to Loki himself...
before getting a spear through his chest,

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:00.840
and dying minutes later.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.640
It made the Avengers a team, but outraged
and crushed fans everywhere... almost as much

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.620
as when Marvel returned Coulson from the dead
for Agents of SHIELD.

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.920
So... take your pick.

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.870
Deadpool's Debut
For years, Ryan Reynolds had fans convinced

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.820
that he would make the perfect Deadpool, and
he finally got his chance... as a back-up

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.440
character and villain in X-Men Origins: Wolverine.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.720
His debut as the un-powered Wade Wilson proved
the studio had gotten the casting right, but

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:30.420
by the time he was revealed, mutated, scarred,
and inexplicably silenced, it was as disappointing

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:31.570
as the rest of the movie.

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.560
Thankfully, it earned him a second shot.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.440
Those are just some of the Marvel Movie Moments
that had fans furious, turned off, or fed

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:38.440
up.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.440
But which ones have we missed?
