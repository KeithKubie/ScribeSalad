00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:12.660
I hear you all, yes, we read your comments.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.000
Yes, we know mice are not humans.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.100
Look, I'm not the one doing the studies!

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.810
Ask the scientists!

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.490
OKAY I'll look!

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.619
Why DO we use mice?!

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:34.520
A lot of the time, when we're reporting on
science here at DNews, the studies we're reading

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.460
are done with mice.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.410
Mice have been used for more than 100 years
in tons of scientific research.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.290
Today, the laboratory mouse or Mus Musculus
is used as a human analog in everything from

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:50.580
brain disease studies to social interaction
studies, cancer, smoking, obesity, genetics

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.550
… so many things.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.250
Scientists use mice because they are small,
easy to care for, have a high reproduction

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.070
rate, and their genome has been sequenced.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:06.110
According to the National Center for Biotechnology
Information, there are over 450 inbred strains

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.720
of white lab mice which can be selected and
customized for specific studies.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:16.329
Mice have similar immune systems and metabolisms,
have been inbred to minimize genetic differences

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:22.990
for different mice, and can be (or have been)
genetically mutated so their DNA more closely

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.409
mimics humans.

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:29.140
Overall, researchers generally accept mice
as good stand-ins for us.

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:34.509
But, as medicine drills deeper into the genetic
code, they've discovered even though we look

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:37.579
the same on the surface, mice are still very
different.

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:41.430
It’s already known that humans and mice
share 70 percent of the same protein-coding

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.619
gene sequences, and about HALF of their DNA
overall.

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:51.789
But new study in a series of papers in Nature,
Science, and Genome Research found some key

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:56.920
variances in the way mouse and human genes
are regulated.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.749
More specifically, they found that a mouse’s
immune, metabolic and stress response systems

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:05.899
behaved differently than a human’s at the
genetic level.

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:10.020
Scientists had been operating under the assumption
that mouse genes and human genes would express

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.069
the same way, but even though the genes appear
to accomplish the same tasks, they did those

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.940
tasks in a slightly different way.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:24.350
Like taking a different road to the same destination…
and in science, that little detail matters…

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:25.350
a lot.

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.000
Now, let's not all start laughing at science,
or assume that all the studies ever done are

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.990
now invalid lies.

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.490
That's simply not the case.

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.790
Mice and humans are still similar enough to
go along with, but as medicine probes deeper

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.970
and gets more person-to-person specific, the
gene expression of each person is going to

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.130
affect how they're treated.

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.241
And knowing the key differences in how mice
and human genes work is going to affect HOW

00:02:50.241 --> 00:02:52.670
they'll create that treatment.

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.870
As the researchers say, "the mouse continues
to be a very good model [for humans]."

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.830
Now they just need to fine tune their experimentation.

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:05.641
Because 95 percent of ALL medical experiments
use these genetically modified lab mice, more

00:03:05.641 --> 00:03:10.460
research is needed to see which studies will
have to be re-done (if any) using this new

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:11.460
information.

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:16.100
And, luckily for us, the researchers promise
there will be more than a dozen studies on

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.310
the mus musculus in the coming years.

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.840
This is going to be super interesting.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:43.650
How do you feel about science using mice?
