00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:04.300
We've dealt with the weak acid,
so let's try an example

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:05.340
with the weak base.

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:06.590
Let's say we had ammonia.

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.350
That's nitrogen with
three hydrogens.

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.370
And it's a weak base because
it likes to accept hydrogen

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:18.750
from water, leaving the water
with just a hydroxide.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.190
So it increases the hydroxide
concentration.

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:23.940
So if you have some ammonia
in an aqueous

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.150
solution, plus water.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:29.430
I'll throw the water in there.

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:35.470
Plus water in an aqueous
solution.

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:36.940
It's a weak base.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.530
So this reaction doesn't go
in just one direction.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:41.890
It's an equilibrium reaction.

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.980
And since this is a weak base,
it-- and this is where the

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.140
Bronsted-Lowry definition
really kind of pops out.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.040
Is that it's a proton acceptor
instead of a donor.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:03.960
So it turns into ammonium,
or an ammonia cation.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.970
Ammonium has another hydrogen
on it, so now

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:08.915
it has another proton.

00:01:08.915 --> 00:01:11.195
So it's the plus charge.

00:01:11.195 --> 00:01:12.450
An it's an aqueous.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.250
And it took that hydrogen
from the water.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.050
So plus OH minus aqueous.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.430
And remember, if you look at
it from the Bronsted-Lowry

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.110
definition , it was
a proton acceptor.

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.600
So that made it a base.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.210
Or if you look at the Arrhenius
definition, it

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.010
increased the concentration of
OH in the solution, so that

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.860
makes it an Arrhenius base.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.060
But anyway, given that
we have-- let me

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.970
pick a random number.

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:48.890
Let's say we have 0.2
molar of NH3.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.950
What is going to be the pH?

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.710
So what's going to be our pH of
the solution, considering

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.260
that it's 0.2 molar of NH3.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.350
So the first thing
we need to do.

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.930
We need to figure out the
equilibrium constant for this

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.220
base reaction.

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:10.820
And I just went to Wikipedia--
I wanted to say liquidpedia,

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.370
I'm talking about
liquids so much.

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:14.130
And equilibrium.

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.170
Equipedia.

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.070
But I went to Wikipedia, and
they have a little chart for

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:20.630
almost any compound
you look for.

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:21.880
And they give you pKb.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.760
Which is, you see
that p there.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.090
That just means it's the
minus log base 10 of

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.565
the equilibrium constant.

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.700
And they give that
as being 4.75.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.330
So we can just do a little bit
of math here to solve for the

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.000
equilibrium constant.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.620
So let's see.

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:53.220
If we multiply both sides by
negative, you get log base 10

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.460
of our equilibrium constant
for this base reaction.

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:58.570
That's why the b is there.

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:03.030
Is equal to minus 4.75,
or 10 to the minus

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.400
4.75 should be Kb.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:11.540
So Kb is equal to 10
to the minus 4.75.

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.040
That's not an easy exponent to
figure out in your head, so

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.530
I'll bring out the calculator
for that.

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:27.850
So if we take 10 to the 4.75
minus, it equals, let's just

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.460
say 1.8 times 10 to
the negative 5.

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:37.320
This is equal to 1.8 times
10 to the minus 5.

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.090
So now we can use this
information and we can do a

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.260
mathematical thing very
similar to we

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.010
did in the last video.

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:46.480
It's going to be hard to
figure out the hydrogen

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.760
concentration directly, right?

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.520
Because our equilibrium reaction
only has hydroxide.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.500
But if we know the hydroxide
concentration, then we can

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.770
back into the hydrogen
concentration, knowing that

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:01.510
this plus the hydrogen
concentration has to equal 10

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:02.440
to the minus 14.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.620
Or if you figure out the pOH,
that plus the pH has to be 14.

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.000
And we did that a couple
of videos ago.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.060
So this equilibrium constant
or this formula

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.880
would look like this.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:24.940
1.8 times 10 to the minus 5
will be equal to-- in the

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.880
denominator, we have our
concentration of reactants.

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.060
And remember, you don't
include the solvent.

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.980
So you only include the NH3.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.480
We have 0.2 molars is what we
put in, but some of it, let's

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.980
say X of it, is going to be
converted into this stuff on

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:39.670
the right-hand side.

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:43.380
So in the denominator, we're
going to have 0.2 minus

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.870
whatever gets converted into
the right-hand side.

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.510
And so then in the right-hand
side, we're going to have x of

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.470
NH4 and x of OH.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.140
This is the concentration
of ammonia.

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.300
And then we have x times x.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:07.830
This is the concentration of
NH4 plus-- that's a 4.

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.320
And then this is the
concentration,

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:15.330
right here, of OH minus.

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.870
Right?

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.860
And we just solve for x.

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.850
Let's do that.

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:21.080
Solve for x.

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.390
And once we have x, we know
the concentration of OH.

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:25.310
We'll be able to figure out
the pOH, and then we'll be

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:27.900
able to figure out the pH.

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:28.750
OK.

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:32.300
Multiply this times both
sides of this equation.

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.060
And just so you know, that same
simplification step that

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:36.380
we did in the previous thing.

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:44.260
When this is several orders of
magnitude smaller than this

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:49.830
number right here-- I want to
give you-- heuristics are just

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:51.290
kind of rules of thumb
that sometimes work.

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:53.170
Let's just do the quadratic
equation.

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:56.150
But you can kind of think about
sometimes when you can

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:57.000
get rid of that middle term.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:57.760
But let's just multiply it.

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:03.450
0.2 two times 1.8 is 0.36.

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:07.980
0.36 times 10 to the
minus 5, right?

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:11.650
2 times 1.8 would be
3.6, this is 0.36.

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:20.660
Minus 1.8 times 10 to the
minus 5 x, right?

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:22.942
Is equal to that.

00:06:22.942 --> 00:06:24.900
x squared.

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:29.260
Let's put everything on the
same side of the equation.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.220
I'm going to move all of these
the right-hand side, so you

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:35.090
get 0 is equal to x squared.

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:37.990
Add this to both sides
of the equation.

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:44.520
Plus 1.8 times 10 to
the minus 5 x.

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.870
1.8 times 10 to the minus 5.

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:50.940
Just so you can see the
coefficients separate from the

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:53.010
x terms.

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:59.860
Minus 0.36 times 10
to the minus 5.

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:00.990
So let's solve this.

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:04.610
And once again, if you wanted
to kind of do it, you could

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:06.720
eliminate this term and then
just figure out the straight

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:07.540
up square root.

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:08.360
But we won't do that.

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:09.890
We'll actually use a
quadratic equation.

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:12.610
So a is 1.

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:13.950
b is this.

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:14.530
That's b.

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:15.200
And this is c.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.340
And you just supply than in
the quadratic equation.

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:20.500
So you get minus b.

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:26.230
So you minus 1.8 times 10
to the minus 5 power.

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:27.060
Plus or minus.

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:28.790
We'll only have to do the plus
because if we do the minus,

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:30.250
we'll end up with a negative
concentration.

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:34.440
So plus, the square root-- we
have to do a lot of math

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:36.970
here-- b squared.

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:39.220
So it's 1.8 times 10
to the negative 5.

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:41.550
So it's 1.8.

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:45.210
If you square it, it's 3.24.

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:51.150
So it's 3.24 times-- if you
square 10 to the minus 5-- 10

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:57.630
to the minus 10 minus 4
times a, which is 1,

00:07:57.630 --> 00:07:59.380
times c, which is minus.

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:04.860
So it's 4 times-- the minuses
cancel out-- times 0.36 times

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:08.220
10 to the minus 5.

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:20.140
Which is 4 times 0.36
is equal to 1.44.

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:21.435
I should have been able
to do that in my head.

00:08:21.435 --> 00:08:25.440
Now you have 1.44 e minus 5.

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:30.120
Times 10 to-- let
me write that.

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:32.549
So this is 1.44.

00:08:32.549 --> 00:08:36.260
And of course all of
this is over 2a.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:37.390
So let's see.

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:38.789
This is my x value.

00:08:38.789 --> 00:08:41.860
My concentration of OH.

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:42.350
So let's see.

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:51.380
I have 3.24 times 10
to the minus 10.

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:53.020
That's that.

00:08:53.020 --> 00:09:03.870
Plus 1.44 times 10 to the minus
5 is equal to that.

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:05.530
So that's this whole thing
under the radical.

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:08.180
And I want to take the
square root of that.

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:12.520
And so that is to
the 0.5 power.

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:16.680
So I get 0.00379.

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:19.590
So I'll switch colors.

00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:25.820
So I get x is equal to a minus
1.8 times 10 to the minus 5

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:33.320
plus 0.003794.

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.660
All of that over 2.

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:36.330
Do the math.

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:42.660
So to that I'm going to subtract
minus this point

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:43.060
right here.

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:43.750
I have this value.

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:44.990
I'm just subtracting this.

00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:53.770
Minus 1.8 e 5 negative
is equal to that.

00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:54.750
This is the whole numerator.

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:57.470
And now I need to just
divide it by 2.

00:09:57.470 --> 00:10:03.680
Divided by 2 is equal
to 0.001.

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:04.430
Let me write that.

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:05.910
So x.

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:08.140
So I'll switch colors
arbitrarily again.

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:18.480
x is equal to 0.001888-- I mean,
then there's a 3 and so

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:19.690
forth and so on.

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:21.740
But if you remember from
our original equation.

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:22.490
What was x?

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:26.760
It was what's both the ammonium
concentration and the

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:27.855
hydroxide concentration.

00:10:27.855 --> 00:10:30.530
We care about the hydroxide
concentration.

00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:36.060
So this is equal to my
concentration of hydroxide.

00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:40.580
Now if I want to figure out my
pOH, I just take the minus log

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:44.610
of this number, which
is equal to--

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:46.830
So let's just take
the log of it.

00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:49.180
The log is that, and then I
take the minus of that.

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:55.180
So it's 2.72.

00:10:55.180 --> 00:11:00.420
And now if we want to figure out
the pH, my concentration

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:03.370
of hydrogen ions-- just
remember, when you're in an

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:10.740
aqueous solution at 25 degrees
Celsius, your pK of water is

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:15.870
equal to your pOH
plus your pH.

00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:19.730
This at 25 degrees is 14.

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:22.815
Because you have 10 to the minus
14 molar concentration--

00:11:22.815 --> 00:11:24.580
well no, actually, I don't
want to go into that.

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:26.720
You have 10 to the minus
7 of each of these.

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:28.510
But anyway, this is equilibrium
constant for the

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:30.310
disassociation of water.

00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:37.170
This, when water's neutral is 7
or a concentration of OH of

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:38.280
10 to the minus 7.

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:39.760
We can take the minus
log, this becomes 7.

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:44.070
But now we know we have a much
higher concentration of OH.

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:45.080
2.72.

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:47.550
Remember, that minus log
kind of flips it.

00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:52.670
So a lower pOH means a higher
concentration of pOH.

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:53.230
Right?

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:57.200
And a lower pOH, if this
is lower, right?

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:58.480
This is a lower pOH.

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.290
That means your pH is higher.

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:04.870
So what is your pH
going to be?

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:15.024
So your pH is going to be
equal to 14 minus 2.72.

00:12:15.024 --> 00:12:21.710
So let me do the minus
plus 14 is equal to--

00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:23.570
let's just say 11.3.

00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:26.650
So your pH is equal to 11.3.

00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:30.850
Which makes sense, because we
said this was a weak base.

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:33.680
Ammonia is a weak base.

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:35.070
So it's basic.

00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:39.120
So it should increase your
pH above the neutral 7.

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:42.805
So the pH should be greater than
7, but as you compare it

00:12:42.805 --> 00:12:45.280
to some of the strong bases
before that took our pH when

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:49.410
you added a molar to 14, this
took our pH-- although we only

00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:54.010
did add 0.2 molar
of it to 11.3.

00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:56.970
Anyway, this is more of a math
problem than chemistry, but

00:12:56.970 --> 00:12:59.800
hopefully it clarified
a few things as well.
