00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Hi. Welcome back.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
As you can see from this spread, this lesson is going to be about tools.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Now, we homo sapiens fancy ourselves as tool makers.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
We think that's what distinguishes us from the other animals.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
In the physical world, we've invented lots of tools.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
These general ones like screw drivers and plyers, you're probably very familiar with,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and some very specific tools--look at this one.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
You may not know what this does, but look how nicely it fits into my hand.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Or look at this one. What do you think this one does?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
If somebody can tell me on the forum what this one does, I'll send them a swell prize.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
or look at this one--surgeons forceps.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Now, these have been refined over the years and now we can refine them

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
where they serve as a third hand.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
It's got this trick where I can attach it on, and now I don't have to put my hand on it anymore,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
because it's got a little locking mechanism.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Our tools get better and better over time.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Now, there's a saying that a poor craftsman blames his tools.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I always thought that all that meant was you shouldn't complain, you shouldn't whine,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
but I realized it means more than that.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
It means that the tools become a part of you,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and if you're a good craftsman then the tools are a part of you.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
You know what to do with them, and so you're not going to end up blaming your tools.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
That's what we're going to learn in this lesson about software tools.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
We're going to learn about some general software tools,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
about some very specific software tools,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and specifically, we're going to talk about two.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
We're going to talk about, first, language.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Now, language is perhaps homo sapien's greatest invention--our greatest tool.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
In computer programming, well, a computer program is written in a language,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
but a computer program can also employ language as a tool to do its job.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
The other tool we're going to talk about is functions.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Of course, you've been using functions all along,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
but we're going to talk about new techniques for using functions

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and learn why they're more general and malleable than other tools.

00:01:58.000 --> 09:59:59.000
So see you in the lesson.
