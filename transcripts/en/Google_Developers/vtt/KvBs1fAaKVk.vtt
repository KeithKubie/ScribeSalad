[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:10.510
WAYNE SUTTON: I'm Wayne Sutton.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:11.885
MELINDA EPLER:
I'm Melinda Epler.

00:00:11.885 --> 00:00:13.480
We're the founders
of Change Catalyst.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.930
We empower inclusive and
sustainable innovation

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:16.430
globally.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.346
WAYNE SUTTON: Welcome
to this series sponsored

00:00:18.346 --> 00:00:20.460
by Women Techmakers,
Google's program that

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.250
provides visibility,
community, and resources

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.870
for women in technology.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.000
Together, we're
helping tech hubs

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.056
to develop more inclusive
cultural programs in spaces.

00:00:30.056 --> 00:00:32.430
MELINDA EPLER: This video
focuses on the internal company

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.380
culture of a tech hub.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.140
Like a co-working space,
learning community,

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.840
accelerator, or corporate
innovation center,

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.300
in order to develop an inclusive
culture for your external

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.037
community of students
and startups,

00:00:44.037 --> 00:00:45.870
you need to make sure
your staff and teams--

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.840
who create that space-- feel
included, have the skills,

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.269
and feel empowered to create
an inclusive environment.

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:53.060
WAYNE SUTTON: Creating
an inclusive culture

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.830
is the key to long
term innovation.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.170
Inclusion should start
from within the core values

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.070
of your company, and permeate
throughout everything you do,

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.700
and every decision you make.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.241
MELINDA EPLER: This
may mean you need

00:01:04.241 --> 00:01:06.895
to revisit your team or
organizational values.

00:01:06.895 --> 00:01:08.520
Put together a working
committee formed

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.616
by leadership, your people
team, and diversity advocates.

00:01:11.616 --> 00:01:13.740
If you don't know who your
diversity advocates are,

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.900
put a call out to everyone
in the organization, and let

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.400
them know what you're
doing, and you'll probably

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.381
find some volunteers.

00:01:18.381 --> 00:01:20.130
WAYNE SUTTON: Then
find a good facilitator

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.710
who can take you through
a design thinking process

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.980
to adapt your current values
so that you can include safety,

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.390
inclusion, and belonging.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.590
MELINDA EPLER: Since
you're a tech hub,

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.839
you may have a member that
can facilitate this or know

00:01:30.839 --> 00:01:31.950
someone who can.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.510
Once you have your
new values, make

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.250
sure everyone knows
what they are.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.050
Put them on your
website, incorporate them

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.810
into the decor of your
workplace or classrooms,

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.190
and make it a part
of your brand.

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:42.120
WAYNE SUTTON: As
you begin working

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.710
to create an inclusive
culture at your organization,

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.300
it's important to have a
dialogue with current staff

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.750
to understand how they feel
about the organization.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.930
You can do this through a
survey, one-to-one interviews,

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:55.920
or round table.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:56.760
MELINDA EPLER: Make
sure you develop

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.340
a safe, confidential, and
transparent environment where

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.010
people understand why you are
asking for their feedback,

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.830
where their ideas will go, and
who they'll be shared with.

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.330
WAYNE SUTTON: In
these discussions,

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.169
let them know you are there
to listen to what is working,

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:11.790
or what is not
working so that you

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.030
can improve the organization,
culture together.

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.510
This inclusion survey should
ask questions like, why did you

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:19.970
choose to work here?

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:20.970
MELINDA EPLER: Will you
recommend your friends

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:21.480
to this hub?

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.819
And, if not, why not?

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:24.360
WAYNE SUTTON: Do
you have suggestions

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.667
for developing a safer,
more inclusive environment?

00:02:27.667 --> 00:02:29.750
MELINDA EPLER: Do you feel
there are opportunities

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.100
for you to learn and grow here?

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.600
WAYNE SUTTON:
Additionally, you want

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.150
to ask your current
diverse community how

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.250
they would like to
be involved in making

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.020
it a more inclusive hub.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.150
The key is not to make
under-represented people

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.660
responsible for diversity
programs, because we all

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.970
have a role in play
in solving this,

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.559
but to invite them to be a part
of the change, if they like to.

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:52.850
MELINDA EPLER: Once you have
some core recommendations,

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.650
develop an action plan
to begin addressing

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.360
the needs you've heard.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.040
And, at the same time,
your organization

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.100
has an opportunity to correct
the effect of any past biases

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.200
in titles and promotions.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.500
Plus, equal pay and benefits
for hubs that have paid roles.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.709
So conduct an audit of
these across all jobs,

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:10.250
and correct them as
soon as possible.

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.666
WAYNE SUTTON: We have included
some resources in the links

00:03:12.666 --> 00:03:13.790
below to learn more.

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.480
It is important for tech hubs
to map out recruiting process,

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.120
to identify potential
barriers for under-represented

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.660
candidates, whether they be
recruitment staff, membership,

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:24.410
or leadership.

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.076
MELINDA EPLER: Depending on your
hiring and recruitment process,

00:03:27.076 --> 00:03:29.510
there may be areas that
prohibit qualified candidates

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.360
from accepting a hiring offer
or even considering to apply.

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.222
Things to think
about here include,

00:03:34.222 --> 00:03:35.930
is the recruiting
portion of your website

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.596
and other marketing
materials presenting

00:03:37.596 --> 00:03:40.730
an inclusive environment, from
the photos to the language,

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.590
and the value stated
for your company?

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.210
And is your website accessible?

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:46.793
WAYNE SUTTON: Are you sourcing
candidates from diverse schools

00:03:46.793 --> 00:03:47.810
and backgrounds?

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.560
MELINDA EPLER: Does
your interview process

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.120
help candidates
from all backgrounds

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.100
feel like they belong
at your company?

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.500
WAYNE SUTTON: Does your
hiring process show candidates

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.030
that their needs are valued?

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.330
For instance, are you allowing
them to schedule interviews

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.490
at the beginning or the
end of the work day?

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:06.330
Is your hiring process lengthy,
or drawn out, or efficient?

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.580
MELINDA EPLER: Do you offer
benefits at your tech hub?

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.560
And, if so, are they
supportive of all people?

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.190
Of every gender, race,
ethnicity, sexual orientation,

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.134
ability, veteran
status, et cetera?

00:04:16.134 --> 00:04:18.300
WAYNE SUTTON: Once you
establish these opportunities

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.690
for improvement, work
together with your hiring

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:22.390
team to co-create solutions.

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.330
Invest in your
people and develop

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.800
the pathways to
leadership for everyone,

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.520
but especially
under-represented staff.

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.560
The best way to hire
leaders is to hire

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.910
from within the company.

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.035
MELINDA EPLER: In order to
make this a possibility,

00:04:35.035 --> 00:04:37.860
consider certification programs,
executive coaching, invitations

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.800
to executive and board meetings,
establishing mentorship

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.510
programs, and bringing
in role models

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.780
to speak and host Q&amp;A. A big
key to inclusive innovation

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.889
is having diverse teams working
together to solve problems.

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:51.180
WAYNE SUTTON: Diverse teams
lead to greater innovation,

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.580
outperform non-diverse
teams, and provide

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:54.790
greater financial returns.

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:57.290
MELINDA EPLER: Reinforce your
inclusive values across teams,

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:00.444
ensuring each team values
all voices and perspectives.

00:05:00.444 --> 00:05:01.860
WAYNE SUTTON:
Diversify each team,

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.210
and hold team leaders
accountable to hiring

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:05.370
diverse candidates.

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:06.660
MELINDA EPLER: Provide
professional development

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.790
training that includes
compassion and empathy,

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:12.060
understanding, and filtering
personal biases and conflict

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.261
resolution skills.

00:05:13.261 --> 00:05:15.510
WAYNE SUTTON: We've covered
a lot in this short video.

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.280
You can't do everything at once.

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.500
Now that you have an
overview, take time

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.405
to prioritize based
on what you're hearing

00:05:21.405 --> 00:05:23.280
and your inclusion survey.

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.170
And just like any tech project,
use agile design thinking

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:28.110
methods, and try new ideas--

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:29.940
learn from them and iterate.

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:30.660
MELINDA EPLER: Now
that we've walked

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.160
through the internal
culture, we'll

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.800
take a look at external
programs and physical spaces

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.597
in the next videos.

00:05:36.597 --> 00:05:38.430

WAYNE SUTTON: Share this
series with your community,

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:46.560
and let's work together
to create inclusive tech

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.160
hubs around the world.
