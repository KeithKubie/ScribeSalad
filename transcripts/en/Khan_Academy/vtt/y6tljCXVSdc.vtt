00:00:00.296 --> 00:00:01.741
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:01.741 --> 00:00:04.297
is talk about the idea of federalism,

00:00:04.297 --> 00:00:06.926
which is core to the
United States government.

00:00:06.926 --> 00:00:09.675
Now federalism, the word originates,

00:00:09.675 --> 00:00:13.068
its root comes from the Latin word foedus,

00:00:13.068 --> 00:00:15.336
which I'm probably not
pronouncing perfectly,

00:00:15.336 --> 00:00:17.600
but it's in reference
to things like a treaty,

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.280
an agreement, a contract,
a league, or a pact.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.787
And federalism you can view as a pact

00:00:23.787 --> 00:00:26.952
between a national
government and its states.

00:00:26.952 --> 00:00:30.563
It's referring to a government
that has various layers

00:00:30.563 --> 00:00:34.019
where you could have
the national government,

00:00:34.019 --> 00:00:36.201
often known as the federal government,

00:00:36.201 --> 00:00:39.251
and then you have the
states, and you're gonna have

00:00:39.251 --> 00:00:43.221
multiple states over here,
and then you could have

00:00:43.221 --> 00:00:45.594
even further layers, and in the
United States you indeed do.

00:00:45.594 --> 00:00:48.221
You have the local governments,

00:00:48.221 --> 00:00:50.868
and even within the local
you have city governments,

00:00:50.868 --> 00:00:52.464
you have county governments.

00:00:52.464 --> 00:00:56.695
The analogy that's often made
is originally the federal idea

00:00:56.695 --> 00:00:59.178
was kind of like a layered cake,

00:00:59.178 --> 00:01:03.527
so this is my best attempt at
drawing a quick layered cake,

00:01:03.527 --> 00:01:06.525
where you could view each layer

00:01:06.525 --> 00:01:08.881
as one of the layers of government.

00:01:08.881 --> 00:01:11.929
So when I cut open that
cake, maybe right over here

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:13.341
this blue layer right over here,

00:01:13.341 --> 00:01:15.260
it's blue flavored cake,
maybe it's an ice cream cake

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.058
of some kind, that might
be the federal government.

00:01:18.058 --> 00:01:20.754
Then this yellow, maybe
it's mango-flavored,

00:01:20.754 --> 00:01:23.088
that would be the state government.

00:01:23.088 --> 00:01:27.255
And then you have your
strawberry-flavored local government.

00:01:28.688 --> 00:01:32.465
That is one view of
federalism, but it turns out

00:01:32.465 --> 00:01:36.264
in the United States, especially
over the passage of time

00:01:36.264 --> 00:01:38.040
this has gotten mixed up a little bit.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.920
So even though the United
States might have started

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.055
a little bit closer to something
like this layered cake,

00:01:43.055 --> 00:01:45.529
today it is more of a marble cake

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:47.832
where the different
layers and their powers

00:01:47.832 --> 00:01:50.842
are more mixed together,
and so this is my attempt

00:01:50.842 --> 00:01:55.008
to drawing the mixing
of these various powers.

00:01:55.008 --> 00:01:57.483
And not only do they mix, they overlap.

00:01:57.483 --> 00:02:00.507
That different layers of
our federal government,

00:02:00.507 --> 00:02:02.567
some have exclusive powers,

00:02:02.567 --> 00:02:04.937
which means that's the
only layer that has them,

00:02:04.937 --> 00:02:06.061
while some of them,

00:02:06.061 --> 00:02:08.421
while sometimes there
are concurrent powers,

00:02:08.421 --> 00:02:10.742
which means these are
powers that multiple layers

00:02:10.742 --> 00:02:12.587
might actually have.

00:02:12.587 --> 00:02:15.064
Now to appreciate what these exclusive

00:02:15.064 --> 00:02:17.231
and concurrent powers are,

00:02:18.275 --> 00:02:22.204
here's a Venn diagram
that shows some of them.

00:02:22.204 --> 00:02:24.685
So on the left-hand side
right over here you have

00:02:24.685 --> 00:02:26.958
your exclusive federal powers.

00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:29.389
So in the United States,
only the federal government

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:31.403
can coin money.

00:02:31.403 --> 00:02:35.141
You can't have money
from Texas or California.

00:02:35.141 --> 00:02:37.793
Only the federal
government can declare war,

00:02:37.793 --> 00:02:40.606
which is related to the idea
of conducting foreign affairs,

00:02:40.606 --> 00:02:44.537
which once again, only the
federal government can do.

00:02:44.537 --> 00:02:46.863
That's also related to
raising armies, once again,

00:02:46.863 --> 00:02:48.478
only the federal government.

00:02:48.478 --> 00:02:51.449
Rules of naturalization,
who becomes an immigrant,

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:54.469
who gets a green card,
who becomes a citizen,

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:56.345
all determined by the federal government

00:02:56.345 --> 00:02:57.657
not by the states.

00:02:57.657 --> 00:02:59.610
And the federal government regulates

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.977
not just foreign affairs,
but foreign commerce,

00:03:01.977 --> 00:03:04.796
trade agreements, and how is trade done.

00:03:04.796 --> 00:03:07.095
They're regulating between the states.

00:03:07.095 --> 00:03:11.095
Now exclusive powers to the
states, they conduct elections.

00:03:11.095 --> 00:03:11.928
You might say, "Wait, wait, wait.

00:03:11.928 --> 00:03:12.761
"Hold on a second.

00:03:12.761 --> 00:03:14.249
"Aren't there federal elections?"

00:03:14.249 --> 00:03:18.104
Well it turns out, even for
election for a president,

00:03:18.104 --> 00:03:20.677
the elections are conducted
by the state government.

00:03:20.677 --> 00:03:22.437
Remember, we have the electoral college.

00:03:22.437 --> 00:03:25.404
They want to figure out who should

00:03:25.404 --> 00:03:27.766
that state's electors vote for.

00:03:27.766 --> 00:03:30.467
Establishing local governments;
what are the counties,

00:03:30.467 --> 00:03:34.532
what are the various
jurisdiction within a state?

00:03:34.532 --> 00:03:37.612
Similarly, intrastate
commerce, that's regulated

00:03:37.612 --> 00:03:39.933
by the state, about the
commerce that happens

00:03:39.933 --> 00:03:41.467
within the state.

00:03:41.467 --> 00:03:44.387
And then the Constitution
allows the states

00:03:44.387 --> 00:03:48.859
to be the main power in ratifying
constitutional amendments.

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:51.390
The Senate and House
can propose amendments,

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.363
but 3/4 of the states
have to vote to ratify

00:03:55.363 --> 00:03:57.419
constitutional amendments.

00:03:57.419 --> 00:04:00.093
Now what we see in the
middle of this Venn diagram,

00:04:00.093 --> 00:04:01.618
these are concurrent powers,

00:04:01.618 --> 00:04:03.524
which means that they are common

00:04:03.524 --> 00:04:06.087
to both federal and the state governments.

00:04:06.087 --> 00:04:09.729
You can have federal taxes
and you can have state taxes.

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:11.010
In fact, most of us have both.

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.504
There are federal laws
and there are state laws.

00:04:14.504 --> 00:04:16.605
Similarly, there's
federal law enforcement,

00:04:16.605 --> 00:04:20.895
you can think of the FBI,
Federal Bureau of Investigation,

00:04:20.895 --> 00:04:24.341
and of course you have state
police and local police.

00:04:24.341 --> 00:04:27.761
The chartering of banks, eminent domain,

00:04:27.761 --> 00:04:29.767
which we might do another
video on in the future,

00:04:29.767 --> 00:04:33.144
but this is the idea that
a government can view

00:04:33.144 --> 00:04:36.930
taking land as the interest
of the broader good

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.487
in order to put down
power lines or a highway

00:04:39.487 --> 00:04:42.269
and ideally compensate the
people that it takes from

00:04:42.269 --> 00:04:44.238
if it's for the greater good.

00:04:44.238 --> 00:04:46.778
Establishing courts, you
have a federal court system

00:04:46.778 --> 00:04:49.445
and a state court system,
which we'll talk more about

00:04:49.445 --> 00:04:50.966
in future videos.

00:04:50.966 --> 00:04:53.836
And borrowing money,
they both can issue bonds

00:04:53.836 --> 00:04:55.677
if they want to have a large project

00:04:55.677 --> 00:04:58.165
or to finance their deficit.

00:04:58.165 --> 00:05:01.058
All of these things are concurrent powers.

00:05:01.058 --> 00:05:04.584
Now this list is not exhaustive
for any one of the three,

00:05:04.584 --> 00:05:07.045
for the exclusive federal
powers, the concurrent powers,

00:05:07.045 --> 00:05:08.787
I'll do this dot, dot, dot here,

00:05:08.787 --> 00:05:11.426
and the exclusive state powers.

00:05:11.426 --> 00:05:12.865
And one thing that you will see,

00:05:12.865 --> 00:05:15.214
even certain exclusive state powers,

00:05:15.214 --> 00:05:18.868
so for example, education
is for the most part

00:05:18.868 --> 00:05:21.577
considered an exclusive state
power, but then you might say,

00:05:21.577 --> 00:05:22.410
"Hold on a second.

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:24.912
"Isn't there a federal
department of education?"

00:05:24.912 --> 00:05:27.076
I'll do that over here.

00:05:27.076 --> 00:05:29.171
And the way this is a good example

00:05:29.171 --> 00:05:30.784
of how the federal government,

00:05:30.784 --> 00:05:33.156
even when something might be more

00:05:33.156 --> 00:05:35.581
of an exclusive state power
where the federal government

00:05:35.581 --> 00:05:37.164
can still influence it.

00:05:37.164 --> 00:05:39.186
And they do that through grants.

00:05:39.186 --> 00:05:40.911
So even though the states
and local governments

00:05:40.911 --> 00:05:43.869
might run the schools, the
federal government might say,

00:05:43.869 --> 00:05:46.708
"Hey, if you do X, Y, and
Z, which we want you to do,

00:05:46.708 --> 00:05:49.431
"then we will give you more
funding for your schools,"

00:05:49.431 --> 00:05:51.789
and so that might be
motivation for the states

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:53.794
to listen to the federal government.

00:05:53.794 --> 00:05:55.384
So I will leave you there.

00:05:55.384 --> 00:05:57.299
This is super important to understand

00:05:57.299 --> 00:05:59.854
if you want to understand
how the United States works,

00:05:59.854 --> 00:06:03.690
and frankly, most governments
in the world today.
