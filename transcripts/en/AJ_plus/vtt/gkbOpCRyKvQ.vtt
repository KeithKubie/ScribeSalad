00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200
This is me dumpster diving to find food
for tomorrow's dinner.

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.740
Look what I found!

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:05.400
This is a beautiful strawberry.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.920
Why would someone throw this away?

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.840
And this is my face after finding some
unexpired steak in the trash.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.260
Why am I doing this?

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.300
Because we in America have a crisis:

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.680
We throw out way too much perfectly good food.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.940
This is like a pristine cookie.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:27.460
Forty percent of all food in the U.S. goes to waste. That's 400 pounds of wasted food per American per year.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.720
And this is fully edible food
we're talking about.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:30.880
Wowww.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.480
In developing countries, most food waste
happens either on the farm or before the

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.280
food even makes it to the supermarket. In
the U.S., it's a different story.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.980
Not only do supermarkets and
restaurants waste a ton of food,

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.460
but consumers like you and me waste a lot more.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.940
We're actually the single biggest source of that waste.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.180
Hi, my name's Yara.
And I'm also part of the problem.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.340
I buy a lot of groceries and sometimes
I just don't eat them all in time.

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.140
You know, life just kinda gets in the way.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.340
But here's what's really messed up.

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.920
While we waste all of this food,

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.740
one in eight Americans is going hungry.
That's over 41 million people.

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:08.580
So all this got me thinking: why do we waste
so much perfectly good food?

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.220
How can we rescue it for those of us
who don't have much to eat?

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.080
And what can you and I do to cut back
on waste in our own homes?

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.640
To fully grasp just how much food we
actually waste ...

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.960
Hi Janet! This is Yara.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.960
I tracked down a group
of expert dumpster divers ...

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:24.860
I see them. They're right there.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.480
... who live off what they find in the garbage

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.020
Wait, oh my God, I think we found them.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.620
So I joined them to go rummaging
through New York City's trash.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.260
They call themselves "freegans,"

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.820
And their lifestyle philosophy of "freegan-ism" is completely opposed to what they call ...

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.160
This wasteful, destructive, violent, unsustainable ...

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.380
That supposes that we have infinite resources
when the opposite is clearly true.

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.020
That's Janet.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.600
She's one of their organizers.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.080
The main feature of "freeganism" is to encourage
people to buy as little as possible ...

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.140
and instead rely on salvaging, scavenging
and foraging through the trash

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.120
to find what you need while cutting down on waste

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.100
– which is what we did.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.060
We've found a pile of trash.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.200
The amount of perfectly edible food we found was
unbelievable, especially baked goods.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.000
This is my favorite health loaf.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.140
From bagel shops ...

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.120
It's not a goldmine, it's a typical night.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.980
cafes ...

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.220
Whoa, this is a scone.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.720
And purveyors of expensive cookies.

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.720
It tastes really good.

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:26.680
Yeah!

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.500
Bread doesn't go bad on the same day that it's baked,
but places that bake goods throw them all out

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.960
because people don't want yesterday's bread.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:35.920
Everywhere we looked.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.320
Oh my God it's kale!

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.480
This was a fruit salad.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.800
There were mountains of food ...

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.100
Remember, they were in the store just an hour ago.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.460
... upon mountains of food.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.560
And they're best before November 2020.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:49.660
And even unopened toiletries.

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.140
Toilet paper never expires!

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.020
I am blown away by how much food we just recovered.

00:02:54.020 --> 00:03:00.100
Before I was actually working, I survived off of it
quite easily – that and food stamps.

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.120
But nothing prepared me for what I'd find
right outside a local grocery store.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.700
Across the street is our supermarket.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:05.700
There was cheese,

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:06.440
onions,

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.020
kale,

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:08.120
lettuce,

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.740
watermelon

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.140
and the steak and strawberries you saw earlier.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.200
But was it all safe to eat?

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.660
I mean, most of it was, but that's not to say
dumpster diving doesn't carry any risks.

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.980
You can get sick from bad food
or hurt yourself if you're not careful.

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.440
Last week I did something and I cut myself.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.460
Certain foods like eggs, dairy, and meat are riskier to eat, especially if they haven't been refrigerated.

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.520
I'm thinking of actually maybe eating this sushi.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.100
I'm having doubts about eating this sushi.

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.120
But a lot of what we did was pretty controlled.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.760
We dropped by businesses that
freegans had scouted out before,

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.120
shortly after fresh food was thrown out in batches.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.120
We made sure things weren't
contaminated, rotten, or a half-eaten.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.700
We wore gloves if we had to,

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.280
and took care of the food we recovered.

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.640
And, we just used common sense.

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.420
I've been diving [for] food for five years, and I've never gotten sick.

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.060
You just have to be very practical. Take the food home, look at it under good light,

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.880
smell it, taste a little bit, feel it, wash it, cook it if you have any doubts. You can't go wrong.

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.520
But what shocked me the most about our supermarket
discoveries was the amount of

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.200
completely unexpired packaged food we found.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.360
That's not even expired.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.320
It's not expired.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.540
Wait, it's not even expired.

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.500
So things don't only get thrown out
because they're expired.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.710
They get thrown out because of
the ridiculous rate at which

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:21.960
we have to keep stocking our shelves.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.520
Altogether, supermarkets are responsible for over 10 percent of all food that goes to waste in the U.S.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.900
And Janet's right. Overstocking store shelves
has a lot to do with it

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.360
supermarkets think projecting an image
of abundance helps increase sales.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.460
And large case sizes for produce means some stores are forced to order more than they can actually sell.

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.700
Stores also pull products off the shelves
earlier than their sell-by dates,

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.300
worried that customers won't buy them.

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.300
And sometimes, they just dump produce
that isn't pretty enough.

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:51.240
Compare this to France, which in 2016 made it illegal for supermarkets to throw away food they haven't sold,

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.060
meaning they have to donate it to charities.

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.440
They couldn't give this to
someone who doesn't have something to eat?

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:02.840
Well, they could if they lived in a system where compassion was the feature of our economy.

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:11.300
There are people who are malnourished
and there is perfectly good kale right on the curb.

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.700
It doesn't make sense to say that we are a
caring society and we're doing that.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.600
Dumpster diving was more shocking than I thought it would be. It wasn't that I was finding rotten meat

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.380
and moldy vegetables. I was finding
perfectly good unexpired food that

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:27.290
supermarkets, bakeries, cafes and
restaurants were throwing away in

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:31.300
massive quantities at a time when many
can't afford to feed themselves.

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.960
Janet had invited us over to cook a meal with
all the food we recovered.

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.800
I'm excited for you to visit.

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.560
But before we did that, there was
something else I wanted to know:

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.540
is there a way to save this food
from making it to the trash in the first place

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.740
and instead feed it to those who
don't have enough to eat?

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:46.360
We're heading over to a place called

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.960
These folks pick up food from a bunch of different places around the city ...

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.700
Food that isn't eaten, that's gonna be thrown out.

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.320
They reclaim it and then

00:05:59.140 --> 00:05:59.980
And Robert Lee

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:02.280
runs the whole operation ...

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:03.160
Wanna wave and smile?

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.460
... which is also known as RLC

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.180
So we grabbed one of their signature carts ...

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.600
... joined forces with another RLC staffer ...

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.980
And set out to stop food from getting anywhere near a dumpster.

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:19.180
Ok, so first we went to a start-up.

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:20.160
Can we see what's in it?

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:27.720
And then we went to a school.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.140
We're picking up food that was
packed by first graders.

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:35.020
Let's make sure they're all closed properly.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.240
Look at all this food we have.

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.640
And then ... we dropped
everything off at a homeless shelter.

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:40.560
It's empty.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.640
What's cool about RLC is that anyone can sign up online to rescue food whenever they have free time.

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:48.480
Can you guys say hi for the camera?

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:49.160
Hello!

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.720
Robert, you've created change!

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:52.800
Yeah!

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:56.360
Here's the thing with rescuing food:
pickups and drop-offs have to be really fast.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.180
because bacteria multiplies
rapidly at certain temperatures.

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:02.540
Any potentially hazardous food
can't be left out in a temperature danger zone,

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:05.200
which is 40 degrees to 140 degrees,
for more than two hours.

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:09.840
Every food business, every cafeteria like we were just in, can be donating their excess food

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:10.820
instead of throwing it away.

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:13.560
Now, it's true. A lot of businesses
won't donate food because they're afraid

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:17.600
of getting sued if someone gets sick. But
that fear is sort of misplaced.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:21.420
There are actually laws in the U.S. that fully
protect businesses that donate food to

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:24.200
the needy, so long as the food is donated "in good faith."

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:28.720
And, there's no public record of anyone
ever being sued for donating food.

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:33.120
And there's a personal story here?

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.700
Yeah, definitely. My parents were immigrants here

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:38.620
and they struggled. My brother and I
remember times when ...

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.900
... we would not know where our
next meal was coming from.

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:45.640
It's heartbreaking to see your parents just skip meals ...

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:46.780
They would skip meals?

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:48.200
Just watch us eat, basically.

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:49.320
Wow.

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:54.680
But we weren't done rescuing food yet.
There was one final pickup spot we had to check off.

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:55.740
Where are we going now?

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:59.320
We are going to the Stephen Colbert
studio to pick up their excess food.

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:00.680
Have you met Stephen Colbert before?

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:01.680
I have not.

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:02.400
You have not.

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:03.200
But hopefully one day.

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:05.440
We're actually gonna go in
through an entrance on the side.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:07.780
That's Margarita!

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Can I ask you –&nbsp;where's the food from?

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
We get catering for the staff every Thursday.

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:13.900
So this is what we got left!

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.080
Thank you!

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.960
Alright, yeah – no, thank you guys for taking it all.

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:20.080
That's Stephen Colbert ...

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:24.760
... on a screen, of course, much
like he would be at your home.

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:28.200
From there, we set out to take it all
to one final drop-off location.

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:31.280
If you take just one third of the food
that's being wasted right now

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:33.580
and brought it to the people who
are food insecure

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:37.880
we could eliminate hunger. We literally produce
enough food in this country to feed everyone.

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:39.600
We just need to get it to the
right people.

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:45.060
So far, RLC has rescued over two million pounds
of food, enough for 1.7 million meals.

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:49.220
But who are the actual recipients
of this food? I wanted to meet them.

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:53.880
Margarita guided us to a shelter for men run by the Community Church of New York.

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:56.420
Yes. Yes.

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:59.100
All this time I've been holding the camera it strengthened my arms.

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:01.880
That's where we met Bruce.

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:03.460
I'm Yara. 
Hi, I'm Bruce.

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:04.640
He's a volunteer with the shelter.

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:06.980
So we unloaded the food we brought for them.

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:10.520
This is from Stephen Colbert's studio.

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:11.140
Oh, ok.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.800
Spinach is our friend.

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:18.120
Stack bread in a refrigerator. I know that will be breathlessly entertaining for your viewers.

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:22.780
You come here, we give you food, we give you
an opportunity to clean yourself up literally.

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:25.520
You can watch some TV, you can get some sleep.

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:27.160
People eventually started to trickle in,

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:30.340
but no one was willing to talk to us unless 
we agreed to blur their faces.

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:36.020
I've seen cases of people who ask for
a plate of food or something to eat

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:38.100
when a store – when a restaurant – was closing

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:39.840
and the manager will tell them to go

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.200
to get out of here, we don't have anything for you.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:46.200
and then you'll watch them
come out through the back door

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:49.860
throwing, just, garbage, throwing bags
and bags of food away.

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:53.980
This is what businesses are doing in New York City.
They are wasting tons and tons of food.

00:09:53.980 --> 00:10:00.060
I have two jobs, and working two jobs still
doesn't add up to the amount to survive in here.

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.880
How would I be able to get groceries,
how would I be able to feed myself?

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:09.980
I can't understand how the richest country in the world, would have people starving and living on the street.

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:14.300
When we see food thrown out by supermarkets
or when we throw it away ourselves

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:18.020
so thoughtlessly, we forget that it can
actually change someone's life.

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:22.560
People who don't have anything to eat,
much less a place to sleep.

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:26.560
According to the EPA, donating extra food to feed
hungry people is the second most

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:28.720
effective way of reducing food waste.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:30.720
But what's even more effective?

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:33.860
Preventing the food from becoming waste ourselves.

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:36.080
So what can you and I do to cut down on waste?

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:38.580
The amount of food that we waste
in our homes is

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:40.100
That's Margaret Brown.

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:43.500
A family of four throws out about $1500
a year worth of food.

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:48.820
She works for the National Resources Defense Council, which is basically one of the biggest

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:50.520
environmental advocacy groups out there.

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.400
So we are the single largest contributor

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:57.120
to food waste here in the U.S., more than
restaurants and grocery stores combined

00:10:57.140 --> 00:11:01.860
And why is that? Well, one major reason is
we just don't seem to know when our food goes bad.

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:05.360
As many as 90% of Americans
have thrown away perfectly good food

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:07.600
because we misinterpret the
date labels on that food.

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:11.020
A lot of times, we find something with an expired
date, and then we just throw it out.

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:14.800
Those dates are not regulated on almost any product except a baby formula.

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:19.420
Just to reiterate, there are basically no federal standards on food expiration dates in the U.S.

00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:23.300
meaning, for the most part, companies decide
when food is best on their own.

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:27.960
So we recommend that you just use
your nose and your eyes ...

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:31.940
... to see how it looks and that's usually your best bet.

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:35.300
Can we do that, I guess, in your kitchen? Let's go through and see some of these dates ...

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:41.380
I've never seen honey go bad.

00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:44.140
– Honey never goes bad, ever. Like, thousands of years.

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:54.500
One that I think is really misunderstood is yogurt.
If yogurt is kept in your refrigerator,

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:57.180
you could be well past your
expiration date and still be fine.

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:05.440
With milk, I just smell it. If it smells a
little off, you can use it to make pancakes.

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:11.140
Eggs will stay good much longer than
your expiration date

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:13.200
and there's a very easy way to test it.
– Can we do that?

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:13.700
Yeah.

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:18.440
If it's at the bottom, that means it's perfectly safe?
–Yeah, absolutely.

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:22.900
My freezer is my biggest food waste avoidance tool.

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:25.660
So we actually keep almost all of
our bread in the freezer.

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:27.500
Yeah, my grandma also puts bread in the freezer.

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:31.200
If you're okay with toast,
then you're all set.

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:36.280
If I couldn't eat that right away, I
would wash them, I'd probably take the tops off

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:37.140
and I'd just freeze them.

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:40.000
Keep a couple things that you can make with

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.980
whatever leftovers you have. So these I
use to make quiches with like older eggs,

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:45.880
whatever vegetables I have.

00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:50.320
This cream cheese is gonna look pretty bad.

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:51.640
You know who does not care about that?

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:53.160
Sit, bud.

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:56.160
I guess dogs aren't lactose intolerant –&nbsp;that's good.

00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:59.140
And the most important tip of all?

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:03.820
I would smell it, and I would look at it and see
if there's anything growing on it,

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:08.380
And then I would probably taste one bean. 
And then I'd say it's pretty good.

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:10.800
Alright, back to the freegans.

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:11.780
Hey!

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:15.160
We all got together at Janet's house to cook up all the food we recovered the night before.

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:16.520
Good to see you again.

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:17.540
Good to see you.

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:23.600
May I put my shoes over here?

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:25.720
Everything we're cooking with tonight, right, is ...

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:27.720
Yeah, everything is salvaged.

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:29.920
Cool, I'm ready to help you in any way I can.

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:31.920
That doesn't look so good.

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:34.640
So what is in this again?

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:36.340
Papaya, kale ...

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:39.680
As we drank smoothies made with the fruit
we found and froze the night before

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:43.220
and ate a fully vegan meal made
with ingredients straight from the trash,

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:46.380
it was hard not to think about how this
perfectly good, perfectly edible food

00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:49.820
almost ended up in a landfill. Now, I'm
not trying to say everybody should just

00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:53.280
go and live off what they find in the
garbage. But I do think we can all be a

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:56.140
little more mindful about what we buy
and what we throw away.

00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:58.460
These potatoes are old, but they're still good.

00:13:58.460 --> 00:13:59.800
I am freezing this bread.

00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:04.180
Not just in our homes, but in our restaurants, 
businesses and supermarkets.

00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:09.060
Because rescuing perfectly good food from ever making it to the trash won't just reduce waste,

00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:11.400
it could also help feed our fellow humans.

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:14.540
Hey guys, thanks for watching!

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:17.880
Ok, two quick notes: if you ever hear about anyone
who's afraid to donate food in the US,

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:20.640
make sure to tell them about the Good
Samaritan Food Donation Act,

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:23.760
which protects food donations to those in need.
Also, we never got to discussing the

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:26.760
environmental impact of food waste in
this piece or generally food waste

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:29.380
around the world. Let us know if you'd
like us to cover those topics in another video.

subscribe – all the things –
