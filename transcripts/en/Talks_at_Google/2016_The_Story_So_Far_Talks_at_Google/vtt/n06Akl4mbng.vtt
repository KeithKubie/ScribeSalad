SPEAKER 1: Please welcome to
Talks at Google, Joe and Joyce

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:03.860
Ellwanger.

00:00:07.835 --> 00:00:08.710
SPEAKER 2: All right.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:09.793
Well, thank you, everyone.

00:00:09.793 --> 00:00:13.520
And thank you Joe and Joyce
for joining us here today.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:14.920
It's truly an honor.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.890
And we'll go ahead and
get started with the years

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.530
prior to 1965.

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:25.654
What brought you to
Birmingham, Alabama in 1958?

00:00:25.654 --> 00:00:27.570
REV. JOSEPH ELLWANGER:
Well, the short version

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:35.310
is that my father was in Selma
as a pastor and president

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.290
of Alabama Lutheran
Academy and College, which

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.980
was a black high school
and junior college

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.360
serving the black Lutheran
Churches in Alabama.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.970
I graduated from Concordia
Seminary in Saint Louis.

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:57.930
And my first call-- partly
because of my father's presence

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.070
in Selma, where I did
some of my growing

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:06.660
up, and because of my internship
in the black congregation

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:11.930
in Kansas City, I wound
up getting the call

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.870
to the black congregation
in Birmingham, Alabama.

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.820
And I've often said that I'm
grateful that my first call

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:25.670
to a parish was not to
Bismarck, North Dakota in 1958,

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.200
but to Birmingham, Alabama.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.580
Because it certainly changed
my understanding of myself,

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.610
my theology, what pastoral
ministry is about,

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.800
and my understanding
of US history.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.840
I am the recipient of
a lot of good things

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.600
that happened because of that.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.570
SPEAKER 2: Absolutely.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.650
Turning to the social
and political landscape

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:56.060
in Birmingham as it
shifted from 1958 to 1965,

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.570
what did that look like?

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.630
And also, if you could talk
about some of your work

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.350
with Dr. Martin Luther
King, Jr. during that time.

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.010
REV. JOSEPH
ELLWANGER: Well, 1958

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:12.520
was three years-- two years
after the Montgomery bus

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:18.140
boycotts, which was
really the spark that

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:24.380
started the civil rights
movement, 1955 to 1956.

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.270
So here's 1958.

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.740
The civil rights movement
is-- we won't say sputtering,

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.610
but it hasn't taken
off after Montgomery.

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:40.680
Montgomery was an amazing,
amazing indication

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.970
that not only is there a lot of
unrest in the black community,

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.690
especially as soldiers
came back from World War

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.330
II and the Korean War,
and then came back

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.480
to segregation and to
the kind of oppression

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.210
that they experienced
in the south.

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.650
There was a lot of
unrest-- a deep unrest

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.410
in the black
community-- demonstrated

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:15.400
by the bus boycott which was 95%
successful for an entire year.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.000
This blew the minds of
white folks in the south

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.790
and of the media.

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.830
Nobody expected them to do that.

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:29.640
But then from 1956 on-- as the
Southern Christian Leadership

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.450
Conference was formed
by Dr. King and some

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.910
of the other civil
rights fighters--

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.460
there was a little
bit of a lull.

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:43.910
But there was that feeling
that something's happening,

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.120
something's going to take place.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:52.430
And it really did
blow off in 1960

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:58.130
when we experienced the sit-ins.

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.250
And nobody orchestrated that.

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.250
It was just
spontaneous combustion

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.520
from the black campuses
all through the south,

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.080
and then it spread to the north.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:24.900
And then, 1961 and 1962 were
such things as the attempted

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.540
entrance of blacks to
universities and colleges

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:35.890
in the south and things were,
obviously, breaking loose.

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:39.120
Dr. King and the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.000
had their first major
demonstrations in the South

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.700
after Montgomery in
Albany, Georgia in 1962.

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.070
But that didn't go very far.

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.650
And so it looked as
though things were really

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.100
beginning to diminish
in the south,

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.980
in terms of this
movement for change,

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:04.740
until 1963 in Birmingham.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.500
And for me to be there
in the middle of that

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.130
was quite a gift.

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:11.180
SPEAKER 2: Absolutely.

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:17.400
And so Joe and Joyce,
we'll turn to 1965.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.650
If you could just
talk a bit about what

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.394
happened on March 6, and then
your involvement in the Selma

00:05:23.394 --> 00:05:24.310
to Montgomery marches.

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.940
REV. JOSEPH ELLWANGER:
Well, to start with,

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:36.680
the evening of March 5--
the night before-- Joyce

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.780
and I didn't get a
whole lot of sleep.

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.250
JOYCE ELLWANGER: None.

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.000
REV. JOSEPH ELLWANGER:
It was-- because we

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.330
knew that leading
a march-- this was

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:55.040
the first-- to be the first
march of white southerners

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.370
in support of the
civil rights movement.

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:00.440
It had never happened.

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:05.830
And folks, black and white,
didn't think this would happen.

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:09.970
And we didn't know
what kind of response

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:14.450
we were going to get
in Selma the next day.

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:17.770
It could be anything
from some kind

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:20.450
of a vicious attack
from the Ku Klux Klan

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:22.830
to arrests to who knew?

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:25.910
It was very, very uncertain.

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:29.560
So we didn't sleep too
well that night before.

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:33.080
But then the day
of, we had no idea

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.740
how many white folks from
the whole state of Alabama

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:40.680
would show up for
this demonstration.

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:47.700
We had put out an invitation
and from the understanding

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:50.165
of how many white
moderates there were,

00:06:50.165 --> 00:06:53.180
there could have been 500.

00:06:53.180 --> 00:07:00.010
But given the threats and
the uncertainty of it all,

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:02.422
it could be Joyce and me.

00:07:02.422 --> 00:07:03.130
SPEAKER 2: Right.

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:05.005
REV. JOSEPH ELLWANGER:
We really didn't know.

00:07:05.005 --> 00:07:06.590
So we were very
grateful that there

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:12.150
were 72 who showed up,
counting Joyce and me.

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:18.690
And we had a preparation
for this event.

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:25.080
We walked down the main street
of Selma-- Broad Street.

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:28.370
It was a Saturday
right around noon.

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:35.610
And it was like a
Saturday in Selma.

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:39.040
Folks were going to the
stores-- the drugstore--

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:44.440
and we were walking down
a Broad Street sidewalk.

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:46.440
No big deal, it seemed.

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:47.430
Nothing was happening.

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:49.670
They looked at us and
wondered who we were

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:55.880
and why we were there until
we got to the corner of Broad

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:58.910
Street and Alabama,
where we had to turn

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:00.870
to go one block to
the courthouse, which

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:02.670
was our destination.

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:05.300
And when we turned
the corner, we

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:08.640
could see in the
street-- Lauderdale,

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:13.770
there-- in front of the
courthouse about 300,

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:22.880
400 white men with pipes
and clubs and bats.

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:27.630
And we knew that they were
not there for a party,

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:31.310
unless you want to talk
about a negative party.

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:38.950
And as we came up to the corner
then, they were to our right.

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:45.480
And right in front of us, was a
phalanx of about seven or eight

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:47.050
sheriff's deputies.

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:54.540
And to our left, which we
really didn't notice immediately

00:08:54.540 --> 00:09:01.090
because we were transfixed
on this group to the right--

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:05.240
but to the left were
about 400 or 500 blacks

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:09.470
on the lawn of the
federal building, which

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:10.810
was opposite the courthouse.

00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:12.670
So here we were in
the middle of it

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:16.170
all, stopped by the
sheriff's deputies.

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:24.770
And the Sheriff deputy in
charge looked down at his hand

00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:27.860
and stopped us and said,
I have a telegram here

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:29.420
from Dr. Homrighausen.

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:31.120
Do you know him?

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:35.060
By the way, that's the picture
on the front of my book.

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:39.100
But as the Sheriff's deputy
looked down at his hand,

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:40.360
he said, I have a telegram.

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:41.460
Do you know him?

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:43.420
Well, he happens
to be the president

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:47.810
of the district of our
Lutheran Church Missouri Synod.

00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:49.630
He's like my bishop.

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:51.920
Well, he said, I have
a message from him.

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:54.060
And the first sentence,
as he read it,

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:59.100
was the Reverend
Joseph Ellwanger

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:02.770
does not represent the
Lutheran Church Missouri

00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:07.600
Synod in any way in his
actions in Selma today.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:10.220
Well, what do you say to that?

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:13.660
And if he expected me to
turn around to go home,

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:16.520
he was sadly mistaken.

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:21.430
I said well, Dr.
Homrighausen has his right

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:23.220
to his own opinions,
but we're here

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:26.200
today to stand in solidarity
with our black brothers

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:29.420
and sisters who have been
struggling here for two months

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:32.290
to simply be able to vote.

00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:35.040
And we came to
support them and we'd

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:39.380
like to move forward to the
steps of the courthouse.

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:44.640
And at that point, we had no
idea what was going to happen.

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:49.920
That's where the uncertainty was
going to become very certain.

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:53.010
Either we were
going to be arrested

00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:56.680
or they were going
to give the signal

00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:59.009
to the yocals in the street.

00:10:59.009 --> 00:11:00.800
And when you think
about that for a moment,

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:04.440
here are seven Sheriff's
deputies permitting

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:09.670
500 white men with bats
and clubs and pipes,

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:14.750
standing in the street,
you know which side

00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:16.940
the Sheriff's deputies are on.

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:20.450
And so they could easily have
just given the signal and said,

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:21.550
go ahead for it.

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:25.060
We'll turn around for
about five minutes

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:27.910
and we'll see what happens.

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:33.350
But strangely enough, the
Sheriff's deputies moved apart

00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:38.060
and we moved forward,
had our demonstration,

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:43.270
and managed to make it back to
our place where we came from.

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:46.279
But I think, maybe, Joyce
needs to tell her perspective.

00:11:46.279 --> 00:11:48.820
JOYCE ELLWANGER: Well, I just
wanted to say a little bit more

00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:52.360
about who these 72 people
were at that walk together.

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:54.860
We'd had nonviolence
training, so we

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:57.310
knew how to protect
ourselves, our own bodies,

00:11:57.310 --> 00:12:00.560
and how to react to the kinds
of hate speech and things

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:01.934
that we might encounter.

00:12:01.934 --> 00:12:03.350
They said there
would be no police

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:06.550
protection at all for us.

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:07.740
It was an interfaith group.

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:10.220
There were Jews and
Unitarians and people

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:13.590
who were mainline Baptists
and Christian groups.

00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:18.930
And a few that weren't
affiliated, but supported us

00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:21.030
in what we were trying to do.

00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:22.400
We lined up two by two.

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:27.520
And in those days, people
wore their Sunday clothes.

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:28.900
They dressed up.

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:30.370
Women were in heels.

00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:33.167
It's hard to picture a
demonstration these days

00:12:33.167 --> 00:12:34.250
that would look like that.

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:41.400
But we were dressed
to be out and about.

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:42.530
So we lined of two by two.

00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:44.710
I was near the end of the line.

00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:48.200
I was pregnant at the time
and Joe didn't want me really

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:49.100
up front.

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:50.810
We had talked about that.

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:55.370
But I lined up with a pastor
who came from Clanton, Alabama,

00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:58.280
where there was a hotbed
of the Ku Klux Klan.

00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:01.780
He had had a cross
burned on his churchyard

00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:04.570
because he had spoken
up for voting rights

00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:07.190
and how this was really a
moral issue that people needed

00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:11.160
to be concerned about, and how
it was very fundamental to what

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:14.620
it meant to be a
democracy and to support

00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:17.490
the values of our
country, as well.

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:21.620
So he had experienced
some real hateful things

00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:24.410
that had happened and
threats to his congregation

00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:26.430
and to himself.

00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:29.700
And that man was really scared.

00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:30.930
Talk about knees knocking.

00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:33.410
He was literally-- his
knees were knocking.

00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:36.170
He was shaking.

00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:39.526
But he found the courage
to overcome that fear.

00:13:39.526 --> 00:13:42.640
Fearful as he was, he
came and he got in line

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:43.840
and he walked with us.

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:49.330
And it was such a lesson about
being able to overcome fear.

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:52.130
I think we're going to talk
in a little bit about today

00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:54.020
and the kinds of fears
and the kinds of hate

00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:55.830
that we have to overcome.

00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:57.620
And it's not easy.

00:13:57.620 --> 00:13:59.340
And it can be scary.

00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:01.450
But here was an
example of someone

00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:04.650
who was able to do that,
and to come and walk.

00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:08.840
And risk-- and
risk a great deal.

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:13.970
And so I was so grateful
and learned a lot from him.

00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:16.220
Joe told the story of what
happened at the courthouse,

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:20.360
but as we got ready to leave,
one of the deputies came over

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:22.696
and he said, Joe.

00:14:22.696 --> 00:14:24.070
He said, I don't
think you better

00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:25.320
go back the way you came.

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:28.490
Because the white
men with their clubs

00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:31.000
were blocking the
way in-- closing in.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.830
He said, why don't you
just go the other way?

00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:37.460
When we did, three
songs were being sung.

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:40.400
We had sung "America
the Beautiful"

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:43.580
as part of our witness
at the courthouse steps.

00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:48.260
Can you guess what
the guys were singing?

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.070
"Dixie."

00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:53.350
And then, we looked over to
our African-American friends

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:56.450
and we were walking
right through the middle

00:14:56.450 --> 00:14:59.920
of their group, or
right past them,

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:03.440
and they were singing
"We Shall Overcome."

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:05.060
And I can't tell
you what a feeling

00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:08.090
it was to have done
our little witness

00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:11.800
and known that these people
had come out risking maybe

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:14.650
being identified, maybe
risking losing their job,

00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:18.300
even, if you can imagine just to
have come as a show of support

00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:19.140
for us.

00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:22.260
To help protect us,
to stand with us.

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:25.920
Maybe just to see if we'd
even show up, some of them.

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:26.880
But there we were.

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:29.520
And as we walked
through, they were

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:32.680
singing "We Shall Overcome."

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:35.540
That's a song some of us still
sing today, once in a while.

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:37.760
And for the first few
years when I sang it,

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:40.720
I was in tears, remembering
what that was like.

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:43.400
I can't tell you what
a feeling of solidarity

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:46.070
and of support and
of coming together

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:51.590
as people who really understood
what the issues were.

00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:55.860
And were ready to work together
to see that change would come.

00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:58.340
SPEAKER 3: What an
inspirational story.

00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:02.040
There were some pivotal times
throughout your journey.

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:04.990
I think one of them
might have been one

00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:07.290
that you might call premier.

00:16:07.290 --> 00:16:10.020
That might be the time when
you had the opportunity

00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:13.226
to meet with President
Lyndon Johnson.

00:16:13.226 --> 00:16:15.300
Can you just tell
us a little bit

00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:19.120
about why that meeting happened,
and possibly a little bit

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:24.417
about the aftermath, or outcome,
of that very pivotal meeting?

00:16:24.417 --> 00:16:26.750
REV. JOSEPH ELLWANGER: The
meeting with President Lyndon

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:33.485
Johnson actually took place
the Friday after our march.

00:16:33.485 --> 00:16:38.400
We were there Saturday,
the 6th of April.

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:43.920
And we need to remind ourselves
that the next day, April--

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:47.410
March 7, was Bloody Sunday.

00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:52.270
And that really-- our
little demonstration,

00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:57.100
in the big scheme of
things, was very minor.

00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:59.300
The only real
significance was that it

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:04.190
was southern whites standing up
for the first time, publicly.

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:09.000
But the next day, 500 blacks
walking over the Edmund Pettus

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.310
bridge were just clobbered.

00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:15.550
And it went over
national television.

00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:23.500
And the whole nation began
to feel this call for change

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:25.470
that was coming from
blacks in the South

00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:28.089
that was no small deal.

00:17:28.089 --> 00:17:33.480
And so the meeting with
President Lyndon Johnson

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:38.020
was really orchestrated by the
National Council of Churches,

00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:39.070
nationally.

00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:43.210
And it was their attempt
to show that this is not

00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:47.000
just a few people in Selma
that are asking for voting

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.940
rights for everybody.

00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:52.750
But it's our-- there's national
support all over the country.

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:55.570
So the people who went--
there were about 15,

00:17:55.570 --> 00:18:02.230
16 of us-- two or three
black ministers and the rest

00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:07.290
were white ministers, one or two
from each major denomination.

00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:12.250
So I was the token Lutheran, and
the only white southern pastor

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:13.280
that was in the group.

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:16.560
The rest were from
all over the country.

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:20.180
And we had our meeting
with President Johnson, who

00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:26.380
had said that he wanted to stand
up for voting rights for people

00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:30.890
in the south, particularly,
who had been disenfranchised.

00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:33.610
But he didn't want
to do it right then.

00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:35.450
He said, there's a time table.

00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:37.170
I've got it all in mind.

00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:39.800
But with all the things that
were happening, and especially

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:43.980
Bloody Sunday, it really began
to put the pressure on him.

00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:47.720
And to meet with him
in the Oval Office

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:50.730
and around that--
it is an oval table.

00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:53.750
And each of us had an
opportunity to say something.

00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:58.190
I remember that, basically,
what I told him was,

00:18:58.190 --> 00:19:01.005
I grew up in Selma, Alabama.

00:19:01.005 --> 00:19:04.930
And I think that startled him
a little bit because he didn't

00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:10.010
expect any white person in Selma
to be supporting the Voting

00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:12.110
Rights Act.

00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:17.400
But I said, I grew-- most of
my growing up was in Selma.

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:25.030
And I am a pastor in Alabama
and it really disturbs me deeply

00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:30.210
that I have black colleagues
in Wilcox County and Dallas

00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:35.610
County-- Dallas was the county
that Selma was county seat,

00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:39.700
Wilcox right next to
it-- who cannot vote.

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:44.770
Pastors who have graduated from
college and seminary and they

00:19:44.770 --> 00:19:45.530
cannot vote.

00:19:45.530 --> 00:19:49.420
This is intolerable,
unacceptable,

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:53.320
and this has got
to change quickly.

00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:56.570
Soon, not in the
next year or two.

00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:59.650
I remember I really
stressed the urgency of it

00:19:59.650 --> 00:20:06.890
and that I came from
Selma, for whatever impact

00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:10.380
this had on President Johnson.

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:15.220
It was really a
cumulative effect

00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:21.010
that happened as
Bloody Sunday, Friday

00:20:21.010 --> 00:20:25.390
was the meeting of
the pastors and clergy

00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:31.280
from around the country
with President Johnson.

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:37.780
And then, a week
later-- March 21--

00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:41.300
finally, the Selma to
Montgomery march began.

00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:45.180
So all of that was very
close together and all of it

00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:53.080
was mounting push in
Washington-- in Congress

00:20:53.080 --> 00:21:00.680
and in the White House-- for
a strong Voting Rights Act,

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:01.600
and soon.

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:03.610
And the amazing
thing is-- we look

00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:08.616
at how long it takes to get
any bill through Congress,

00:21:08.616 --> 00:21:19.040
for the Voting Rights Act to
actually pass from March of '65

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:22.550
to the end of
July-- what is that?

00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:24.610
About three or four months.

00:21:24.610 --> 00:21:29.140
And for it to be as strong
and as solid as it was-- it

00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:35.780
was really something that,
within a year or two,

00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:41.020
dismantled Jim Crow-- the
segregated way of life

00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:45.540
in the south that whites
said would never happen.

00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:48.930
And blacks, who
lived in hope that it

00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:52.670
would be dismantled
some day, figured, maybe

00:21:52.670 --> 00:21:54.770
by the end of the century.

00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:59.950
So how important that
Voting Rights Act was

00:21:59.950 --> 00:22:02.350
can never be underestimated.

00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:07.070
It was but one of the most
important historical moments

00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:08.940
in our nation's history.

00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:13.420
And it happened because there
were people who stood up

00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:18.190
and risked their lives and
their jobs to let the nation

00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:21.900
and the president and the
Congress know that this cannot

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:23.719
go on as it is.

00:22:23.719 --> 00:22:25.260
JOYCE ELLWANGER:
And we saw that when

00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:27.980
we returned to Birmingham
some years later.

00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:31.170
About every five years, we
would come back to visit.

00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:35.150
And we were in the church
that Joe had served.

00:22:35.150 --> 00:22:39.870
And sitting in the front row
was the mayor of Birmingham,

00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:41.650
who was a black man.

00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:43.730
Never before--
everybody-- the police,

00:22:43.730 --> 00:22:46.310
the fire department-- anybody
in a position of power

00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:48.100
in Birmingham had been white.

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:51.710
So here was the
mayor of the city

00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:54.910
there to welcome us and
give Joe a key to the city--

00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:57.140
the black mayor.

00:22:57.140 --> 00:22:59.750
We met a woman who was
the chief of police

00:22:59.750 --> 00:23:05.280
after the terrible Bull Connor
era, and others had been there.

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:08.250
And she was an
African-American woman.

00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:10.210
And the council was integrated.

00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:14.640
And in these counties, where
people-- a handful-- in some

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:19.810
places, not one person
had been a voter.

00:23:19.810 --> 00:23:23.450
As they registered
and voted, the color

00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:26.900
of the people who were in
charge-- the power structure--

00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:27.714
began to change.

00:23:27.714 --> 00:23:29.630
That's the kind of thing
Joe is talking about.

00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:33.070
That was the transformation--
the power shift

00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:34.150
that began to happen.

00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:37.700
And that was so significant
to come back and see that.

00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:40.590
It was almost
incredible to us, having

00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:43.930
lived through the segregated
time, to see what was happening

00:23:43.930 --> 00:23:47.330
and how change can come.

00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:49.080
SPEAKER 2: Well, thank
you, Joe and Joyce,

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:51.370
for recounting those stories.

00:23:51.370 --> 00:23:53.070
They're absolutely incredible.

00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:56.280
And I think what
we'll do now is turn

00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:59.600
toward a modern
application of the lessons

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:03.810
that you've learned through
your social justice advocacy.

00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:07.850
And the first
question is, there's

00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:13.360
been a lot of media coverage on
the refugee crisis in Europe.

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:16.500
And I just wanted to
hear a bit about the work

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:19.675
that you have done with refugees
here in the United States.

00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:26.100
REV. JOSEPH ELLWANGER: Where we
got our experience as pastor--

00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:30.640
I was pastor of Cross
Lutheran Church in Milwaukee

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:35.850
from '67 until 2001.

00:24:35.850 --> 00:24:44.850
And it was in the
1970s that refugees

00:24:44.850 --> 00:24:51.280
from the Vietnam
War-- the Hmong people

00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:57.970
and Laotian people who
had befriended our US

00:24:57.970 --> 00:25:03.600
military while we were
there in that war,

00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:07.570
were in danger, of course,
once the war was over.

00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:11.270
And so they asked
for asylum and they

00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:14.650
were refugees who were
streaming into this country.

00:25:14.650 --> 00:25:21.880
And our congregation supported
them and sponsored some

00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:24.500
families, in spite of the
fact that our congregation was

00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:29.950
an urban congregation with
65%-- at that point, about 60%,

00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:33.760
65% African-American membership.

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:41.280
And we could have said that
this is not really our calling

00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:42.960
and this is not for us to do.

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:47.700
But we felt that we
needed to make it clear

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:57.420
that our country welcomes people
who have experienced oppression

00:25:57.420 --> 00:25:59.130
and experienced danger.

00:25:59.130 --> 00:26:00.950
And we should welcome them.

00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:06.280
So we had a whole series
of refugees and immigrants

00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:17.450
that we sponsored, then,
from Haiti, from Guatemala.

00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:22.090
We had a Guatemalan
refugee in sanctuary,

00:26:22.090 --> 00:26:25.750
which is a whole 'nother story.

00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:31.010
But the end result was
that all of this experience

00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:34.730
in walking with people
from different cultures

00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:39.800
and coming with the
shirt on their backs

00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:43.710
was an enriching
experience for us.

00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:51.100
And I think every person and
certainly every faith community

00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:55.360
should have the experience
of receiving and welcoming

00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:57.950
people who don't speak
your language, who

00:26:57.950 --> 00:26:59.780
have a different culture.

00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:03.740
It blows us out of
our isolation and out

00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:07.490
of our self-centeredness
to recognize that we're

00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:11.190
part of a global village
and to recognize it

00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:13.770
in a real way-- not
just in an academic

00:27:13.770 --> 00:27:14.960
and an intellectual way.

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:18.050
So that was a really
rich experience

00:27:18.050 --> 00:27:20.790
that has catapulted
us to this stage

00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:28.710
to recognize that we really--
as the nation that stands

00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:35.020
for freedom, as well as the
people of faith who recognize

00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:38.040
the value of every
individual-- should

00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:42.160
be in the forefront of welcoming
immigrants and refugees,

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:45.640
not throwing up-- talking
about building walls

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:48.827
and making it difficult
for people to come.

00:27:48.827 --> 00:27:50.910
JOYCE ELLWANGER: I think
the learning, too-- these

00:27:50.910 --> 00:27:53.790
are people fleeing war
in their own countries.

00:27:53.790 --> 00:27:59.230
And with the Sanctuary
Movement, our government

00:27:59.230 --> 00:28:05.490
was not supporting these
people or recognizing the death

00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:06.990
threats and the
kinds of things that

00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:10.750
were the realities of our own
US foreign policy, in regard

00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:15.110
to places like El
Salvador and Guatemala.

00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:18.620
And so there was
some risk for people

00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:20.470
who were involved in
the Sanctuary Movement,

00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:23.000
if you know anything about it.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:27.680
There was a possibility of a
$5,000 fine or imprisonment

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:30.050
for a number of
years for people.

00:28:30.050 --> 00:28:33.090
So it was not an easy thing
for a congregation to say,

00:28:33.090 --> 00:28:36.180
we're going to take this
person into the sanctuary

00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:38.530
and the protection
of the church.

00:28:38.530 --> 00:28:42.320
And it opened a door
for a lot of discussion

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:45.590
of what our faith values
and roots that say we

00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:48.700
welcome the stranger
in our land?

00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:52.090
And I think the lesson for
today, too-- many people

00:28:52.090 --> 00:28:53.720
are still fleeing
the wars that are

00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:56.240
part of our US foreign policy.

00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:58.900
And now we're
putting up barriers

00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:01.420
to them coming into our country.

00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:04.040
So it's a time to re-examine
those values, especially

00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:06.180
those faith values
and those moral values

00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:10.880
that we hold about
welcoming people.

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:13.140
And all of those undocumented
people in our country

00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:15.470
who have lived here and
raised their children

00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:21.100
and been good citizens and still
can't have a driver's license,

00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:24.320
can't get insurance for
a car if they're driving.

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:27.830
Can't be-- they're just
not able to enter fully

00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:32.890
into the society, although
they fully support the economy.

00:29:32.890 --> 00:29:35.660
And so there are just a lot
of issues under the surface

00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:37.650
that maybe we need to revisit.

00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:42.150
And especially, I think how
our US foreign policy affects

00:29:42.150 --> 00:29:45.580
the growing number of
people who are having

00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:47.840
to flee, be displaced
in their own countries,

00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:49.870
and outside of countries.

00:29:49.870 --> 00:29:51.320
And who's going to welcome them?

00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:55.220
And who are the people
best equipped to do that?

00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:57.410
As one of the wealthiest
countries in the world--

00:29:57.410 --> 00:30:01.250
we're a country of immigrants--
it seems to me, that's us.

00:30:01.250 --> 00:30:05.180
And I'm really distressed that
we aren't doing more right now

00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:09.750
to help those people who
are also fleeing those wars.

00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:11.910
SPEAKER 3: Thus far,
we've inquired with you

00:30:11.910 --> 00:30:14.580
about your past experience.

00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:16.800
Because of that, now we
want to take a moment

00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:19.770
and reflect on some
of your thoughts.

00:30:19.770 --> 00:30:22.380
We want you to tell
us how exactly you

00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:26.360
feel about the
international social justice

00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:29.200
issues like human trafficking.

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:33.220
And what you think we, as a
people-- as global citizens--

00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:37.142
can actually do to address that.

00:30:37.142 --> 00:30:39.100
REV. JOSEPH ELLWANGER:
One of the basic lessons

00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:44.890
that we learned in the '60s
and we dare never forget

00:30:44.890 --> 00:30:52.290
is that the movement for
justice is never complete.

00:30:52.290 --> 00:30:55.080
It's never ended.

00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:58.310
We can never say,
well, now we have

00:30:58.310 --> 00:31:02.940
just society in a just
world, where everyone

00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:06.050
is treated with dignity.

00:31:06.050 --> 00:31:08.960
And by the way, I
would-- we would not

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:13.270
have any right to talk about
our involvement in the 1960s

00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:18.450
if we were not involved
right now in such an issue

00:31:18.450 --> 00:31:22.630
as you mentioned here,
human trafficking.

00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:25.170
Which can certainly
be understood and seen

00:31:25.170 --> 00:31:30.980
as modern day slavery and an
example of an injustice that

00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:32.480
has to be opposed.

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:35.200
And how do we deal with it?

00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:38.770
Well here's a lesson from the
'60s that we dare not forget.

00:31:38.770 --> 00:31:41.700
And that is that it
was because people

00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:47.940
came together,
organized, and clearly

00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:53.120
set goals for themselves
and cut issues-- that's

00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:59.370
organizers jargon for
taking the massive problems

00:31:59.370 --> 00:32:02.450
and figuring out a
point at which we

00:32:02.450 --> 00:32:05.720
can puncture the balloon.

00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:13.850
And we can attack human
trafficking as the big problem,

00:32:13.850 --> 00:32:16.770
but we have to do it
on the local level

00:32:16.770 --> 00:32:21.530
and we have to do it
with organized people who

00:32:21.530 --> 00:32:27.190
are willing to stand up for
what is right and to take risks.

00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:29.750
I will never forget
that CT Vivian, who

00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:33.940
was one of the real champions
in the Selma movement,

00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:35.800
told me about five
years ago when

00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:40.770
we were in Selma for the
anniversary of Bloody

00:32:40.770 --> 00:32:43.640
Sunday-- there's always
that anniversary.

00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:48.150
If anybody really wants to get
a feel for both the experience

00:32:48.150 --> 00:32:53.040
and the importance of
the Selma movement,

00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:55.150
try the Bloody
Sunday commemoration.

00:32:55.150 --> 00:32:56.540
It's really powerful.

00:32:56.540 --> 00:33:01.100
So I was there five years
ago, for the 50th anniversary,

00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:04.480
and CT Vivian came
over to our table.

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:10.310
We were eating in
the hotel restaurant.

00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:14.520
And he said, you know, Joe,
when you look at what our humble

00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:19.240
efforts here in
1965 accomplished,

00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:24.630
do you realize that that means
that there is no problem--

00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:28.320
no injustice-- in this
country that we cannot make

00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:33.400
a difference with if we
organize, if we stay committed,

00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:35.610
and if we're willing
to take risks?

00:33:35.610 --> 00:33:37.760
And those are the three big ifs.

00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:40.520
JOYCE ELLWANGER: The other
thing is most of us in Milwaukee

00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:44.890
didn't realize that Milwaukee
is one of the real hotbeds--

00:33:44.890 --> 00:33:47.060
the real centers--
for human trafficking

00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:48.130
in the whole country.

00:33:48.130 --> 00:33:49.940
Who would have thought?

00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:50.480
You don't.

00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:55.220
This is-- it's not an issue
that surfaces that easily.

00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:57.470
And so that's been a
real learning for us.

00:33:57.470 --> 00:34:00.290
And we have a strong human
trafficking committee

00:34:00.290 --> 00:34:04.450
that meets monthly and
has engaged our mayor

00:34:04.450 --> 00:34:07.630
and the powers that be
to really understand

00:34:07.630 --> 00:34:10.100
the dimensions of that
in our own community.

00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:11.400
Because it's under the surface.

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:14.800
You're not going to
necessarily be aware of it

00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:16.929
unless you're educated about it.

00:34:16.929 --> 00:34:19.290
And so that's so
true of education

00:34:19.290 --> 00:34:22.880
around the issues
that are right there.

00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:25.820
And many people live
in a bubble and either

00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:27.790
choose not to see them
or really don't know.

00:34:27.790 --> 00:34:30.040
So education is one
of the first steps

00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:34.190
in being able to mobilize
people if they really

00:34:34.190 --> 00:34:36.889
understand the problem is
right here, and it's us.

00:34:36.889 --> 00:34:37.750
It's our problem.

00:34:40.659 --> 00:34:42.670
SPEAKER 2: I just wanted
to hear a bit more

00:34:42.670 --> 00:34:46.670
about your involvement with
the women's and LGBT movements.

00:34:46.670 --> 00:34:48.630
And just to hear of
some of your thoughts

00:34:48.630 --> 00:34:51.170
on the advances for
those movements,

00:34:51.170 --> 00:34:56.650
and also some of the
hurdles to those movements.

00:34:56.650 --> 00:34:58.330
REV. JOSEPH ELLWANGER:
Well, we have

00:34:58.330 --> 00:35:03.790
to honestly say that our
nation and people of faith

00:35:03.790 --> 00:35:09.040
have had to really
struggle with that issue

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:15.390
because our culture had
told us, and still tells us,

00:35:15.390 --> 00:35:21.810
that LGBT people are
people who are heterosexual

00:35:21.810 --> 00:35:25.320
and they just chose
to be that way.

00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:28.565
And they're playing a game,
or at least, it's not right

00:35:28.565 --> 00:35:35.490
and they need to just shape
up and be heterosexual.

00:35:35.490 --> 00:35:40.310
And what our nation and what
most of the church-- now,

00:35:40.310 --> 00:35:44.870
there are certainly some pockets
in the church and the faith

00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:52.110
community that are still
kicking in their heels on this,

00:35:52.110 --> 00:35:55.710
but most people have
come to recognize,

00:35:55.710 --> 00:35:59.530
as our nation has-- especially
in the last few years--

00:35:59.530 --> 00:36:06.220
that LGBT people
are people who have

00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:10.080
this as part of their
DNA, part of who they are.

00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:14.030
It's the way they
are born, just as I

00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:15.740
was born as a heterosexual.

00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:17.460
And that's hard
for heterosexuals

00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:21.730
to recognize and
admit and to realize.

00:36:21.730 --> 00:36:29.060
But once you come to that point,
then receiving and accepting

00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:34.970
LGBT people with dignity
is something that not only

00:36:34.970 --> 00:36:36.540
can happen-- that must happen.

00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:41.560
Our congregation in Milwaukee
had the struggle back

00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:48.790
in-- this was back in the
late 1980s and early 1990s.

00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:55.260
And we had the
interesting struggle

00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:57.630
to come to terms
with this and make

00:36:57.630 --> 00:37:01.910
the decision-- are we going
to really be a Reconciling

00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:03.310
In Christ congregation?

00:37:03.310 --> 00:37:07.200
Which is what we
used, and still use,

00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:11.650
in the Lutheran church as a
way of saying that we believe

00:37:11.650 --> 00:37:17.160
in the dignity and equality of
every person, including LGBT.

00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:20.390
And are we going to become
a Reconciling In Christ

00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:24.720
congregation, or are we going
to just try to sit this out?

00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:27.680
JOYCE ELLWANGER: It didn't
happ-- it didn't just happen.

00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:32.260
We spent a year in Bible study
and really-- digging really

00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:36.760
deeply into our what our
scriptures have to say.

00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:40.940
And predominately
African-American congregation--

00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:43.790
many people had grown up
in very conservative ways,

00:37:43.790 --> 00:37:45.920
thinking homosexuality is a sin.

00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:51.260
And the LGBTQ community was
one they hadn't experienced.

00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:56.350
We had an office inside
of the church for a group

00:37:56.350 --> 00:37:58.530
that we started called
Project Return that

00:37:58.530 --> 00:38:01.100
was working with people coming
out of the prison system

00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:04.790
and helping them reintegrate--
to find jobs and housing

00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:07.240
and reintegrate
into the community.

00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:11.560
And the director was a gay man.

00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:14.150
And it's when he stood
before the congregation--

00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:16.520
we had our first
coming out Sunday.

00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:18.340
And he came and
he told his story

00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:23.750
of his struggle-- how he tried
to change, all of the prayer,

00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:26.800
and all the things he went
through with his family

00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:29.660
and his own trying to
discover who he was,

00:38:29.660 --> 00:38:35.040
and trying to be someone that
he wasn't and how that affected

00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:36.370
him.

00:38:36.370 --> 00:38:40.530
And then, when he accepted
who he was and he really

00:38:40.530 --> 00:38:43.480
shared this with the
congregation in a heartfelt--

00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:46.410
just such a beautiful way.

00:38:46.410 --> 00:38:48.179
And at the end of
that testimony--

00:38:48.179 --> 00:38:50.470
this was someone they had
known, but they hadn't really

00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:51.840
known him as a gay man.

00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:55.030
And when he came out
to the congregation,

00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:57.680
there was about a
four or five minute

00:38:57.680 --> 00:39:00.010
standing ovation for him.

00:39:00.010 --> 00:39:02.810
Because suddenly, this
person that they had known

00:39:02.810 --> 00:39:05.200
had shared his
heart and his soul.

00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:08.250
And there was that feeling
of, well, this is Tim.

00:39:08.250 --> 00:39:09.530
And we loved Tim.

00:39:09.530 --> 00:39:13.100
And he's helped us to see,
in a new way, who he is.

00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:14.470
And we love him as he is.

00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:17.630
And so that's the kind of
thing that happens when

00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:19.110
people have that opportunity.

00:39:19.110 --> 00:39:22.290
So many people
haven't had that kind

00:39:22.290 --> 00:39:23.960
of an experience
of really getting

00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:27.780
to know the heart and
soul of someone who

00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:29.880
is a part of that community.

00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:32.000
One of the things we did,
too, as a congregation

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:32.880
to bring witness.

00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:37.030
There's a parade at-- we
have a lakefront festival

00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:40.680
and there are different
ethnic groups that have events

00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:41.970
to celebrate their ethnicity.

00:39:41.970 --> 00:39:48.570
And there is the weekend when
we have gay pride weekend.

00:39:48.570 --> 00:39:51.125
And so the congregation would
take our congregational van,

00:39:51.125 --> 00:39:53.490
with the name of the
church on the side,

00:39:53.490 --> 00:39:55.590
and some of the older
members would ride inside,

00:39:55.590 --> 00:39:58.890
and we would walk alongside
in the gay pride parade.

00:39:58.890 --> 00:40:02.270
Just to say, we are here and we
are affirming this community.

00:40:02.270 --> 00:40:05.140
And that kind of public witness
on the part of, I think,

00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:07.540
people of faith is
really important, too.

00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:09.820
It's not just doing something
inside your own group

00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:12.960
or your own heart, but it's
giving that public witness that

00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:15.780
can help other people
to stop and think

00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:22.110
about their own feelings and to
begin to deal with some of it.

00:40:22.110 --> 00:40:25.230
SPEAKER 3: We want to give way
for a little time for those

00:40:25.230 --> 00:40:29.260
that are in the audience
to be able to pose

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:31.430
some questions to you.

00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:34.760
And our last question
before we go to our Q&amp;A--

00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:37.640
because we're a
technological company,

00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:41.910
I think that this would
be a perfect way to segue.

00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:44.980
How do you feel
technology has altered

00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:48.900
the behavior of the social
movement in modern society?

00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:52.660
And tell me how
you view technology

00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:55.325
as an actual catalyst
for social change.

00:40:58.297 --> 00:41:00.380
REV. JOSEPH ELLWANGER:
There's absolutely no doubt

00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:07.380
that modern technology has
been at the heart and the core

00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:11.780
of a couple of-- well,
many recent movements,

00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:21.350
including Black Lives Matter,
including the Arab Spring.

00:41:21.350 --> 00:41:24.820
All of those movements
would not have

00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:32.500
been able to muster
the number of people

00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:35.630
without that kind of
communication system.

00:41:35.630 --> 00:41:42.120
And it would have been very
difficult to communicate

00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:48.600
the underlying basis of the
movement, and theme, and goal

00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:50.000
of the movement.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:55.450
And it's just a perfect
tool for organizing

00:41:55.450 --> 00:42:00.585
and that's one of
the real pluses

00:42:00.585 --> 00:42:04.320
that I will give to
technology today.

00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:08.831
It definitely is a big,
big boost for organizing.

00:42:11.162 --> 00:42:12.870
SPEAKER 3: We want to
give an opportunity

00:42:12.870 --> 00:42:14.536
to those that are in
the seats, if there

00:42:14.536 --> 00:42:17.130
be any that would have
any questions that you'd

00:42:17.130 --> 00:42:20.599
like to pose to the Ellwangers.

00:42:20.599 --> 00:42:23.140
SPEAKER 2: Got microphones to
the sides here if you want to--

00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:23.806
SPEAKER 3: Yeah.

00:42:23.806 --> 00:42:25.370
We have a person here, Josh.

00:42:25.370 --> 00:42:25.870
Yep.

00:42:25.870 --> 00:42:27.370
You can just go to the mic.

00:42:30.370 --> 00:42:32.440
AUDIENCE: Based on your
historical experience,

00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:35.590
it feels, today, that
there are movements,

00:42:35.590 --> 00:42:37.670
but they're not
having fast enough.

00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:41.225
The progress made with Black
Lives Matter, the progress made

00:42:41.225 --> 00:42:45.160
with Arab Spring, et cetera-- it
seems that there's potentially

00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:47.570
even more fear than ever today.

00:42:47.570 --> 00:42:49.990
And it doesn't
feel like progress

00:42:49.990 --> 00:42:52.200
is happening fast enough.

00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:54.390
Based upon your
experience in the '60s,

00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:55.970
did you feel the same way then?

00:42:55.970 --> 00:42:58.050
Or did you see things
happening more quickly

00:42:58.050 --> 00:43:02.230
because people were rallying
very tightly together

00:43:02.230 --> 00:43:04.672
to get things done?

00:43:04.672 --> 00:43:07.130
REV. JOSEPH ELLWANGER: It's a
very, very important question

00:43:07.130 --> 00:43:12.010
for people who are going to
take seriously a commitment

00:43:12.010 --> 00:43:15.080
to working on justice.

00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:19.940
If we think that we are going
to solve human trafficking

00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:25.740
and voter suppression and
joblessness in the central city

00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:28.240
and mass incarceration
and poverty

00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:34.480
and on with a long list of
really serious injustices

00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:37.050
that everyone should be
concerned about-- if we think

00:43:37.050 --> 00:43:41.720
we're going to solve these
in the next year or two,

00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:44.590
we're badly mistaken.

00:43:44.590 --> 00:43:47.790
And that is a reason
why some people shy away

00:43:47.790 --> 00:43:51.130
from becoming involved
because they realize,

00:43:51.130 --> 00:43:53.290
whoa, man, these are
such huge problems.

00:43:53.290 --> 00:44:00.670
And look how long it took
for slavery to be eliminated.

00:44:00.670 --> 00:44:02.580
How long it took for
women's suffrage,

00:44:02.580 --> 00:44:07.400
how long it took to get
rid of child employment.

00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:10.820
And how long it took to finally
get a strong Voting Rights

00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:12.690
Act, and then get the
push back that we've

00:44:12.690 --> 00:44:15.610
gotten in the last few years.

00:44:15.610 --> 00:44:16.420
What's the use?

00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:21.570
Well, what we have to
keep in mind is that,

00:44:21.570 --> 00:44:27.820
as Margaret Mead once said,
never doubt that a few people

00:44:27.820 --> 00:44:33.620
organizing-- coming together--
around a given issue cannot

00:44:33.620 --> 00:44:35.650
make a difference.

00:44:35.650 --> 00:44:39.510
That really is the only way that
any change has ever happened

00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:42.180
and the only way that
change will happen.

00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:45.840
And we really have to have
the vision for the long haul.

00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:49.500
As a person of faith
and a Christian,

00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:51.930
I truly believe--
and by the way,

00:44:51.930 --> 00:44:55.830
Martin Luther King
was constantly having

00:44:55.830 --> 00:44:58.110
to deal with that very issue.

00:44:58.110 --> 00:45:01.370
Look how long we've
been working at bringing

00:45:01.370 --> 00:45:04.570
about the end of segregation.

00:45:04.570 --> 00:45:07.990
Not only-- it didn't just
begin with the Montgomery bus

00:45:07.990 --> 00:45:09.230
boycott.

00:45:09.230 --> 00:45:10.880
But if you started
there and count

00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:15.140
that as the beginning,
here it is 1960,

00:45:15.140 --> 00:45:19.960
1963, 1965-- look at how
many people went to jail,

00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:24.125
look at how much has been
paid, and where are we?

00:45:24.125 --> 00:45:28.040
There is that
constant uncertainty

00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:32.390
about the value of
working for justice.

00:45:32.390 --> 00:45:38.330
And at the end of the
Selma to Montgomery march,

00:45:38.330 --> 00:45:44.240
Dr. King said something that he
used at the end of two or three

00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:45.910
other times with his speeches.

00:45:45.910 --> 00:45:49.440
But never to be forgotten.

00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:53.010
How long is it going
to be before we

00:45:53.010 --> 00:45:55.440
get the end of segregation?

00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:58.010
In this case, that
was our issue.

00:45:58.010 --> 00:46:00.310
Not long, he said.

00:46:00.310 --> 00:46:03.710
Truth crushed to
earth will rise again.

00:46:03.710 --> 00:46:05.690
How long will it take?

00:46:05.690 --> 00:46:12.450
Not long, because those who
sew that-- whatever we sew,

00:46:12.450 --> 00:46:14.860
we shall reap.

00:46:14.860 --> 00:46:16.560
How long?

00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:20.740
Not long, because the moral
arc of the universe is long,

00:46:20.740 --> 00:46:22.930
but it bends toward justice.

00:46:22.930 --> 00:46:29.960
And so that belief that we're
not just fighting by ourselves,

00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:33.060
but that God is on our side.

00:46:33.060 --> 00:46:35.870
This is spiritual
language, but that's

00:46:35.870 --> 00:46:39.150
what God is all about--
bringing about justice,

00:46:39.150 --> 00:46:43.710
bringing healing, bringing
reconciliation and redemption.

00:46:43.710 --> 00:46:47.760
And therefore, the
really important thing

00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:50.310
is to make sure we're
on the right side

00:46:50.310 --> 00:46:51.820
and not on the wrong side.

00:46:51.820 --> 00:46:55.240
And that we are doing
something to bend

00:46:55.240 --> 00:46:56.970
that moral arc of the universe.

00:46:56.970 --> 00:46:59.410
That was Barack
Obama who picked up

00:46:59.410 --> 00:47:05.880
on that image of the moral
arc of the universe is long,

00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:07.400
but it bends toward justice.

00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:11.390
And he said, and we have
to be pushing on that arc

00:47:11.390 --> 00:47:17.430
to hurry up that
move toward justice.

00:47:17.430 --> 00:47:27.330
So it takes commitment, knowing
that change can take place,

00:47:27.330 --> 00:47:30.470
believing that it
will take place.

00:47:30.470 --> 00:47:36.500
But knowing all along that we
have to constantly be vigilant

00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:37.770
and be alert.

00:47:37.770 --> 00:47:43.720
Because even when we arrive
at the point of demolishing

00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:50.080
segregation-- racial
segregation, legal segregation,

00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:53.210
we know that there's been
the push back and there's

00:47:53.210 --> 00:47:56.100
de facto segregation.

00:47:56.100 --> 00:47:59.940
And there is white
flight and there's

00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:04.770
all of that stuff that
means that we still

00:48:04.770 --> 00:48:06.630
have some work to do.

00:48:06.630 --> 00:48:11.540
And in the end, there
will be a victory.

00:48:11.540 --> 00:48:15.950
Think of that song that was the
theme song of the civil rights

00:48:15.950 --> 00:48:18.260
movement-- "We Shall Overcome."

00:48:18.260 --> 00:48:23.450
That was not just a small little
ditty or a Sunday school song.

00:48:23.450 --> 00:48:26.220
That was a song that
was sung by people

00:48:26.220 --> 00:48:31.720
who had that deep commitment
that we shall overcome.

00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:33.410
We don't know when.

00:48:33.410 --> 00:48:37.710
We don't know whether that
march over the Edmund Pettus

00:48:37.710 --> 00:48:39.810
bridge on Bloody
Sunday is really

00:48:39.810 --> 00:48:44.120
going to produce a strong
Voting Rights Act this year

00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:46.050
or 20 years from now.

00:48:46.050 --> 00:48:49.300
But we shall overcome.

00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:52.992
And that's the spirit in
which we have to do our work.

00:48:52.992 --> 00:48:54.450
JOYCE ELLWANGER:
We're also working

00:48:54.450 --> 00:48:58.710
for institutional kinds of
changes and that takes decades.

00:48:58.710 --> 00:49:00.620
That doesn't happen in a year.

00:49:00.620 --> 00:49:03.230
And it's power shifts,
and people don't willingly

00:49:03.230 --> 00:49:04.610
give up power.

00:49:04.610 --> 00:49:08.090
And so those are some of
the things to keep in mind.

00:49:08.090 --> 00:49:10.945
And it's worth the struggle.

00:49:13.790 --> 00:49:16.320
We stand on the shoulders of
the people who went before us.

00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:17.210
We really do.

00:49:17.210 --> 00:49:20.560
And so we have our opportunity
during our lifetime

00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:25.140
to add our feet and our hands
and our hearts and our minds

00:49:25.140 --> 00:49:28.140
to that and continue
that struggle.

00:49:28.140 --> 00:49:32.070
But it's good to know we're up
against institutional change.

00:49:32.070 --> 00:49:36.040
And that just is something
you work at over the decades.

00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:38.170
And then, you have
to go back and you'll

00:49:38.170 --> 00:49:40.460
see things coming,
like education,

00:49:40.460 --> 00:49:44.350
and some of the issues that we
thought we had really won on.

00:49:44.350 --> 00:49:47.000
And then you come
back and you have

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:51.807
the privatization of education,
of the prison systems,

00:49:51.807 --> 00:49:52.390
of everything.

00:49:52.390 --> 00:49:57.040
You have to go back and
just take a second breath

00:49:57.040 --> 00:50:01.740
and say, well, let's do
what we can do in the time

00:50:01.740 --> 00:50:02.550
that we have.

00:50:02.550 --> 00:50:04.220
And then, timing is everything.

00:50:04.220 --> 00:50:06.080
There are times-- and
I think right now,

00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:08.890
the criminal justice--
the transformation

00:50:08.890 --> 00:50:11.570
of criminal justice
around the country-- this

00:50:11.570 --> 00:50:13.280
is a pregnant time for that.

00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:15.472
So it's an issue that I
would hope that many of you,

00:50:15.472 --> 00:50:17.180
if that's something
you're interested in,

00:50:17.180 --> 00:50:18.620
really dig in and
work on it now.

00:50:18.620 --> 00:50:21.570
Because the pendulum is
swinging and the more of us

00:50:21.570 --> 00:50:26.082
that work at that, the more
change is going to come.

00:50:26.082 --> 00:50:28.290
SPEAKER 2: Thank you so much
for that great question.

00:50:28.290 --> 00:50:33.680
And thank you again, Joe and
Joyce, for everything today.

00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:34.900
We really appreciate it.

00:50:34.900 --> 00:50:37.940
And let's give them
a round of applause.
