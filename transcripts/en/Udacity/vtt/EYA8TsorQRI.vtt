00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.540
Some of you may remember Microsoft's first entry

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:07.390
in the world of PCs, with their operating

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.410
system called DOS, or disc operating system, and

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.160
the structure of DOS looks as shown here.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.290
And at first glance, at least visually, You

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:19.930
might think that this structure is very similar

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.190
to what I showed you as a monolithic

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.850
structure before. What is the difference you see

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.220
in this structure? First I would like you to think about it

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.400
yourself before we go any further, so here is a question for you.
