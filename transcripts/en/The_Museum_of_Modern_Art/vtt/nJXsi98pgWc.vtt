00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.740
Here comes trouble.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.620
The tape is on the backside here now.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.540
Why, why, why is this happening?

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.020
There is too much tape on the role.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:27.820
Yeah, it’s too much because when it’s
to rewind it’s so close…

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.620
the tape will get out.

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:33.920
It’s gone in on the backside there.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.200
I don’t know how this could happen.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.739
I think Friday is a bad day for me

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:49.800
because when we were in London, and I was
in this, it was also Friday.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.560
I don’t understand.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.680
It’s something with Fridays…

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:06.080
Because it could have happened earlier this
week instead of Friday.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.460
The sound is from ’68.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:14.460
1968?

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.460
And then this is the sound right now?

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:17.460
Yeah.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:25.180
Just that, what you hear from that is acoustic
sound from the bubbles.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.060
I can show you…

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.979
You have some speakers down there?

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.840
This is the sound on the tape.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.860
[bubble recording sounds]

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.500
Yeah?

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.480
That is the tape.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:53.840
And that tape sound goes through here and
activates the pool.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:04.000
In the beginning when they were going to show
this at some performance or something they

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.090
tried to activate the pool with some different
sounds.

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:16.150
But Rauschenberg wasn’t so happy with that,
what they had coming over.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:24.670
So at the end, just some days before the opening,
they just put in air in the bubbles, and they

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.120
recorded the bubble sound.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:34.390
So on the tape now, it’s just the bubbles
sound that activates the bubbles again.

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:41.820
I can put in a CD player and play a CD if
you want to, your favorite music.

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.599
And you can see…

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:53.370
I think it would be nice to see how, if you
have a piece of classical music, with very

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.891
slow violins in the beginning and the crescendo
in the end…

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:05.920
and then at the crescendo, every bubbles are
coming up together and yeaaahhhh!

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.320
Okay, there it is…

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.760
One, two, three…

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.760
♫ “…to pay the bills I have to pay”
♫

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.480
♫ “Ain't it sad” ♫

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.280
♫ “And still there never seems to be a
single penny left for me” ♫

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.080
♫ “That's too bad” ♫

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.320
♫ “In my dreams I have a plan” ♫

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.280
♫ “If I got me a wealthy man” ♫

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.800
♫ “I wouldn't have to work at all, I'd
fool around and have a ball” ♫

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.880
♫ “Money, money, money” ♫

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.320
♫ “Must be funny” ♫

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.600
♫ “In the rich man's world” ♫

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.920
♫ “Money, money, money” ♫

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.240
♫ “Always sunny” ♫

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.000
♫ “In the rich man's world” ♫

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.000
♫ “Aha aha” ♫

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.560
♫ “All the things I could do” ♫

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.160
♫ “It's a rich man's world!” ♫

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:10.720
[cheers]

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.800
Yeah!

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.680
Thank you!

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.160
Gunnar!

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.960
Yeah!

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:22.640
That’s fantastic.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:23.600
Yeah.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.440
Great.

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.400
Okay, back to work!

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.320
Back to work!

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:45.040
