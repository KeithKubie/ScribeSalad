[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.960
AMY STARR: Jim is the author
of the award-winning cocktail

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.000
book, "The PDT Cocktail Book,"
as well as his newer release,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.070
"Meehan's Bartender Manual."

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.990
In an article from
"Imbibe" magazine,

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.180
they described it as ambitious.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.880
And actually, in
that same article,

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.570
you went in and mentioned it
was his midlife crisis project.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.110
But the word that comes to mind
when I first began reading it

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:31.320
was thorough.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.570
It really does cover the
breadth of every aspect

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.760
of the business, when
we're talking about recipes

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.150
and techniques, the
history of cocktail making,

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.830
as well as service
and hospitality.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:49.130
But more importantly, the thing
about having a Chicago native

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.680
here to talk about this, even
though his career has taken him

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.820
all over the country, is what
we're known for in Chicago--

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.540
being neighborly, we know
our local watering holes,

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.410
and we know a lot about our
rich, historic architecture.

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:10.070
So with his newer project,
your neighbor, Prairie School,

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.850
we are talking about
the influence that

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.430
comes from Frank Lloyd
Wright's Prairie School

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.670
aesthetic and the Japanese
cultural influence

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:24.320
that that has, as well as being
neighbors to a great cocktail

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.820
bar.

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.290
So with that,
welcome Jim Meehan.

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:27.456
JIM MEEHAN: Thank you, guys.

00:01:27.456 --> 00:01:30.810
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.170
Thanks, Amy.

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.090
AMY STARR: Congratulations
on the book.

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.250
JIM MEEHAN: Thank you.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.230
AMY STARR: Like I
said, it's great.

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:36.480
JIM MEEHAN: Thank you so much.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.740
AMY STARR: I read it all.

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.030
JIM MEEHAN: This one
has a lot of words in it

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.200
compared to the last one--

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.340
AMY STARR: Lots of words.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.110
JIM MEEHAN: --which
was basically--

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:41.400
AMY STARR: Still
plenty of pictures.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.860
JIM MEEHAN: --like a
children's book with recipes.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:43.260
Yeah.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:44.510
AMY STARR: Plenty of pictures.

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.170
Still great illustrations.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.632
And not only thorough,
very thoughtful as well.

00:01:49.632 --> 00:01:51.090
How do you think
that this book can

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.820
translate to your
readers that are not

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.680
hospitality professionals?

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.770
JIM MEEHAN: I think that
when I wrote this book,

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.190
I sort of had "Zen and the
Art of Motorcycle Maintenance"

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.800
in the back of my mind.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:16.020
I started bartending in
Madison, Wisconsin, in 1995.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.950
I've always loved parties, but
I realized later in my life

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:20.940
that I'm an introvert.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.070
And I like the idea of parties
more than I like partying.

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.750
And I found that working in bars
allowed me to be at the party

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.390
but not necessarily be
in the mosh pit there.

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:43.140
And so I guess after
20-plus years of this--

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.410
bartending, making
cocktails, serving people--

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.070
I've kind of begun to
start extrapolating how

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:51.660
this is sort of a way of life.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.590
You hear the maxim that everyone
should work in a restaurant

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.260
or work as a server
or a bartender

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.550
at some point in their life.

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.370
And as I have gotten
older and started

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.790
thinking about
what I do, and when

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.280
I started writing
this book, I realized

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.100
that I came into
bartending through books.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.390
So in 1995, as all of
you are aware at Google,

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.910
the internet wasn't
the capital I internet.

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.000
We didn't learn how
to do all the things

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.120
that we know how to do through
YouTube or through googling it.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.370
And if you wanted
to know something,

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.520
you had to go to a library or
find someone who could get you

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.030
the book.

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.840
So I learned about the
history of bartending,

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.510
the history of cocktails,
even in some ways,

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.180
once I was able to find
some of the older books,

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.560
about bartending through books.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.830
And one of the things
I've found that kind

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.450
of runs through all of the
books is, a lot of books

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.560
tell you the who, what,
when, where, and how,

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.330
but a lot of books
don't tell you why.

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.620
And I would say for me,
as I've gotten older

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.660
and kind of been doing
this longer and longer,

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:09.960
I've found that, as a young
bartender, as a young manager,

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.660
I always thought that
the way to get everyone

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.769
to get on the same page with
me was to lead by example.

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.680
And I came to a certain
point in my career

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.970
where I realized that by
setting a very high example,

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.140
by striving towards
perfection, it actually

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.570
was incredibly discouraging
to a lot of the people who

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:31.830
work with me.

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.040
And in some ways, the way
in which I carried myself

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.020
didn't motivate them to
want to work with me.

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.350
It made them sort of shirk away
from wanting to work with me.

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.980
And I found in writing this
book and then, eventually,

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.570
transitioning in
management style,

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:48.440
that if I actually showed
people why I did things the way

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.880
that I did them, they
could think about them

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.760
and come to their own
sense of why they think

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.990
that is a good way
or, more importantly,

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.340
we can open a dialogue up
about what the best way would

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:00.840
be to all do it together.

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.090
And so when I wrote
this book, I was

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.760
thinking about not just
the who, what, when, where,

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.160
and how, but the why.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:13.160
And I think in the same
way as within your life

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.720
and your business and
my life and my business,

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.290
I feel like that process of
understanding that there are

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:25.260
many paths to a destination
is something that

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:26.640
is important to understand.

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.180
There are many
ways to do things.

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.763
And what I said right from the
very beginning in this book is,

00:05:30.763 --> 00:05:33.720
there are many ways to do
this job, and here is mine.

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:38.790
And I think the more in which
either bartenders or architects

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:42.030
or chefs or software
designers can

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:46.710
talk about their
process and the process

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.440
which they use to get
to their destination--

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.780
but that actual
process, once you've

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:55.320
formed it and come to certain
ideas or conclusions about it,

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:59.040
can be very useful
to many people.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.700
AMY STARR: Excellent.

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:03.990
So I mentioned, of course, the
influence of Frank Lloyd Wright

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:05.267
in opening Prairie School.

00:06:05.267 --> 00:06:06.600
How did that project come about?

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.210
How did your partnership
with Heisler Hospitality

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:10.020
come around?

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.897
And tell us more about
the influence in the space

00:06:12.897 --> 00:06:13.980
and your cocktail program?

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:14.688
JIM MEEHAN: Yeah.

00:06:14.688 --> 00:06:24.480
So when I listen to a lot
of successful people talk

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.850
about their career
or their life,

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:31.140
this sort of idea of manifest
destiny usually creeps into it.

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:35.610
And you hear of a story of the
self-made person who always

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:37.650
wanted to do X, and
their whole life

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:41.040
has been this series of
just moving towards X.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:44.040
And I think for
me and my career,

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.380
I wish it was like that.

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:48.400
I always wanted to be a doctor.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:49.740
But that didn't work.

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:54.390
So my life has not been a
story of manifest destiny.

00:06:54.390 --> 00:07:00.570
My life has been a story
of opportunism and sort

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:03.000
of understanding
what I was good at

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.460
and what I enjoyed
doing, and trying

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:09.750
to keep doing more of what I
was good at and enjoyed doing.

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:12.810
While Oak Park and River
Forest are wealthy places,

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:15.066
my dad was worked at
Maywood race track

00:07:15.066 --> 00:07:16.190
in the emission department.

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:19.950
My mom was a schoolteacher
at St. Giles teaching art,

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:22.050
first, and then third grade.

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:24.270
And we didn't have a
lot of family money.

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:26.550
So most of what
I've done in life

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:29.702
came from amazing opportunities
being foisted upon me.

00:07:29.702 --> 00:07:31.410
Like, do you want to
edit "Food and Wine"

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:32.880
magazine's cocktail book?

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:33.440
Yes.

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:35.090
Are you qualified?

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:37.319
You know, just fake
it 'til you make it.

00:07:37.319 --> 00:07:38.110
AMY STARR: Exactly.

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:39.390
JIM MEEHAN: Yes, I'm qualified.

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:41.431
I've been saying I've been
qualified to do things

00:07:41.431 --> 00:07:43.800
since I was very young.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:47.500
And so I guess the exciting
part about Prairie School--

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:50.220
like PDT, for instance,
people think that I just

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:54.280
opened my bar in
New York on my own,

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:57.060
whereas I was actually brought
into PDT as a consulting

00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:00.060
opportunity through
one of the regulars I

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:02.280
had at the first
restaurant I worked in.

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:03.444
And they were two guys.

00:08:03.444 --> 00:08:04.860
One of them owned
a hot dog stand.

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:07.710
The other was his kind
of childhood best friend.

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:13.619
And they had kind of designed
this kind of crazy bar,

00:08:13.619 --> 00:08:15.660
and they just didn't know
how to serve cocktails.

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:19.320
So they brought me in to show
them how to serve cocktails.

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.910
And then we kind of have
been involved ever since.

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:23.865
AMY STARR: So the phone
booth was the chicken

00:08:23.865 --> 00:08:24.900
and the cocktails were the egg.

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:25.380
JIM MEEHAN: The phone booth--

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:26.296
AMY STARR: Vice versa?

00:08:26.296 --> 00:08:28.740
JIM MEEHAN: --the taxidermy,
all the sort of fun parts

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:30.480
are Brian Shebairo, my partner.

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:33.840
And all the parts that I'm
passionate about-- the service,

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:37.590
the drinks, the environment--
are me, which no one really

00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:39.690
cares about or copies.

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:41.909
But with respect
to Prairie School,

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:45.660
it was amazingly serendipitous.

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:49.020
I was at my favorite bar,
probably in the world,

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:51.540
Bar Radio in Tokyo.

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:57.990
And it's this tiny little
beautiful, perfect, tiny space.

00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:00.330
And I was enjoying
cocktails at the bar.

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:04.320
And there's never any
Americans in there.

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.630
And there was someone in
there speaking English.

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:11.490
And I didn't go there
to talk to Americans.

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:14.560
But towards the end of
our visit, he said hello,

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:19.050
and very humbly said that he
was a bar owner in Chicago,

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:20.790
and we exchanged cards.

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:22.680
And we met later
again in Berlin.

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:24.720
And then we would kind of talk.

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:28.170
And eventually, we
did meet in Chicago.

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:31.410
And his partner Matt
Eisler, they both

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:33.180
opened Sportsman's
together, and I always

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:34.830
love the Sportsman's Club.

00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:37.290
And I stayed in touch
with them for a few years.

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:39.270
And then finally, Matt
and I had a conversation

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:41.490
about working together.

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:49.020
And then last winter, I guess
it was, Matt drove me down

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:53.190
to this neighborhood when
that was a construction site

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:55.680
and said, there's a
potential opportunity

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.730
to open something here.

00:09:57.730 --> 00:09:58.480
What do you think?

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:02.070
And I was like, yes, I'd like
to open a bar in the Google

00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:04.650
building across from the
new Ace hotel in the hottest

00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:05.720
neighborhood in Chicago.

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:07.530
That sounds great.

00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:09.360
OK.

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:13.020
And the thing that's
most, I think,

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:15.090
exciting for me
is that I grew up

00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:18.930
kitty-cornered to a Frank Lloyd
Wright house in River Forest

00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:25.790
and drove past the sort
of temple every day

00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:26.550
to high school.

00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:32.010
And I feel like this project
allows me to explore my roots.

00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:35.020
I left Chicago or
the Chicagoland area.

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:36.930
People who grew
up in Chicago get

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:38.760
very upset when you
say you're from Chicago

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:41.070
when you aren't
from the 312 area.

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:44.100
But I left this area
when I was 18 years old

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:45.000
and never came back.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.364
I tended bar every summer.

00:10:46.364 --> 00:10:47.530
And then I went to New York.

00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:51.180
And so it's amazing
to come home and to be

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:54.660
able to learn about
Chicago and how

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:56.760
it came to be through this bar.

00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:00.330
And I feel like,
in opening bars,

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:02.490
when you're able to put a
little bit of yourself--

00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:04.980
a little bit of your
history and your story--

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:07.380
in the bar that you
have sort of operated,

00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:11.310
it's something that, I
think, really draws people

00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:12.390
in and sort of resonates.

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:15.480
I think with respect to
the cocktails themselves,

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:20.010
a cocktail, other than being
delicious and intoxicating,

00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:22.080
ideally, is something
that tells a story.

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:25.380
And I think a bar in and of
itself should tell a story.

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:30.400
So Prairie School kind of
does that for me personally.

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:33.940
For us, as Chicagoans, it
allows us to celebrate something

00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:36.940
that I think maybe
flies under the radar,

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:39.190
not necessarily for
Chicagoans, but for people

00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:39.900
around the world.

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:41.950
They don't understand
that Chicago really

00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:45.432
is a design and architecture
mecca, globally.

00:11:45.432 --> 00:11:47.140
AMY STARR: And it does
a really great job

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:52.600
of walking the line, too,
between inspiration and kitsch

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:54.230
being too much of a theme.

00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:57.070
Y'all came to the
right talk today,

00:11:57.070 --> 00:12:01.120
because we have taster sizes for
you of the Tall Boxes cocktail

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:02.670
that they offer
at Prairie School.

00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:04.452
You want to tell us
more about Tall Boxes?

00:12:04.452 --> 00:12:06.910
JIM MEEHAN: Well, first, I'll
point out the team over here.

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:08.230
That's Mony and Christina--

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:11.470
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:12.850
--the real bartenders.

00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:15.040
There was there was
talk of a cocktail demo,

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:16.465
and I said, no,
no, no, let's let

00:12:16.465 --> 00:12:18.430
the real bartenders handle it.

00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:20.610
So thank you guys.

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:24.720
So I learned how to tend bar, as
I said, in Madison, Wisconsin.

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:28.570
And back in the
late 20th century

00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:32.410
the brandy Old
Fashioned was a thing.

00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:34.600
That was what people
drank in Wisconsin.

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:35.890
They still do.

00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:39.760
And it wasn't the modern--

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:41.950
actually, the old Old
Fashioned, that sort of

00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:43.060
has become popular--

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:45.894
just bitters, sugar,
booze, and a twist.

00:12:45.894 --> 00:12:48.310
That was actually something
that we didn't make back then.

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:50.560
What we made right
back then would

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:53.590
be called the Old Fashioned
with the garbage in it.

00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:57.620
And the garbage meant that you
muddled in orange and cherry

00:12:57.620 --> 00:13:00.664
and sugar with the bitters,
and then you added the brandy,

00:13:00.664 --> 00:13:02.580
and then you'd probably
shook it and maybe you

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:04.770
poured it-- you did any number
of things with it back then.

00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:05.080
AMY STARR: A Brussels sprout.

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:07.880
JIM MEEHAN: Any number of
mixological atrocities--

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:10.230
yeah, a Brussels
sprout, a mushroom,

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:13.030
poured Sprite on top of it.

00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:16.270
But when I was looking at
writing the original menu

00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:18.250
for this bar, I
wanted to make sure

00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:20.980
that we were
celebrating the Midwest

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:24.230
and celebrating
things legitimately.

00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:27.460
And so our house Old Fashioned,
we call the Tall Boxes.

00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:28.550
It's this drink.

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:34.300
It's bitters and one muddled
cherry and one Kirsch brandied

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:36.280
Morello cherry.

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:37.540
We press that.

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:40.360
We don't mash it
into the garbage.

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:42.670
And then we add
Sacred Bond brandy,

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:44.440
which is not like
the Korbel we used

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:50.560
to pour back in Wisconsin, which
is probably mostly corn syrup.

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:53.770
And we stir it, and
then we fine strain it.

00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:57.190
So it actually looks like
the sort of more elegant,

00:13:57.190 --> 00:13:58.450
old school Old Fashioned.

00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:02.080
But it actually was made
the Wisconsin-style way.

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:05.421
And if you come
downstairs and have it--

00:14:05.421 --> 00:14:07.920
and I highly encourage of all
of you to come down to Prairie

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:10.060
School and have it--

00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:14.820
the glass is obviously a sort
of cylindrical double Old

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:15.730
Fashioned glass.

00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:20.650
It comes with a big clear cube
that is stenciled with our sort

00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:23.620
of Frank Lloyd Wright-inspired--

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:27.010
Actually, this is our
logo at Prairie School.

00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:30.010
Taking the architectural details
off the top of the building

00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:33.190
is what you'll see here, and
stretching them out and kind of

00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:35.050
bringing them down to the base.

00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:37.930
And then we use Frank Lloyd
Wright's signature red box,

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:42.250
which he put in his blueprints
as his sort of sign-off.

00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:44.470
So we stencil that into the ice.

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:46.810
And then what you'll see
with this garnished is,

00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:48.470
the cherry is a
sphere, and we've

00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:50.360
cut the orange into a triangle.

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:52.240
So if you see it
in the glass, it's

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:56.290
a cube, a sphere, a
triangle in a cylinder.

00:14:56.290 --> 00:14:58.270
And the idea is
really sort of looking

00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:02.500
at how Frank Lloyd Wright
architecture sort of used a lot

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:03.800
of those different elements.

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:05.980
So it's a really simple drink.

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:08.750
It's a drink that all
Midwesterners who have ventured

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:10.510
to Wisconsin are familiar with.

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:12.190
But we've sort of
refined it and made

00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:13.720
it more simple and
elemental, which

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:15.845
is something I think that
Frank Lloyd Wright did.

00:15:15.845 --> 00:15:16.720
AMY STARR: All right.

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:19.930
One of my favorite lines
or quotes from your book

00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:23.590
is that you refer to
bartenders as both craftspeople

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:24.830
and salespeople.

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:30.550
It's evident in how
your career has evolved.

00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:33.759
But now that you've stepped
out from behind the bar--

00:15:33.759 --> 00:15:36.300
you've already alluded a little
bit to how you've progressed,

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:38.550
but can you tell us
more in particular

00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:44.420
as to what opportunities
made you decide to take

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:46.430
a side-step toward consulting?

00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:48.440
And how do you choose
the next project?

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:50.842
Where do you find the
inspiration or influence there?

00:15:50.842 --> 00:15:52.550
JIM MEEHAN: Well, as
I sort of mentioned,

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:55.280
I wish the manifest
destiny element came in

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:56.660
and I just chose my projects.

00:15:56.660 --> 00:16:00.170
But really, I don't
choose the projects.

00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:02.000
The projects sort of choose me.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:10.280
And I feel like, in some ways,
my life has been a series of--

00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:13.440
it's like when one door
closes, another door opens up.

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:17.720
I feel like for me, personally,
a lot of the way opportunity

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:22.320
comes my way is by making
myself open to opportunity,

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:24.820
and by always considering
opportunities.

00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:26.900
I would say that for
those of you who have ever

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:28.970
worked in bars or
who know bartenders,

00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:33.050
bartenders are probably one of
the most opportunistic bunch

00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:34.590
of people you've probably ever--

00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:35.700
AMY STARR: I was ready for
you to say masochistic.

00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:37.310
JIM MEEHAN: No, I
say opportunistic.

00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:38.960
I mean, a bartender
is always keenly

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:42.110
interested in whatever sort
of scheme you have in mind--

00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:44.330
something worth considering.

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:47.540
So I would say that I wish
I could call my shots.

00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:50.870
But that isn't
necessarily how it works.

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:53.810
But I will say that the
projects that I'm always

00:16:53.810 --> 00:16:59.210
open to consider and the sort of
thought process I go through--

00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:00.980
when I realized
that I wasn't going

00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:04.730
to become a doctor because
organic chemistry and calculus

00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:07.390
were going to prevent
me from getting an A--

00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:10.920
a five and seven-credit A--

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:14.953
I just was like, it's
not going to happen.

00:17:14.953 --> 00:17:16.369
And I looked through
the syllabus,

00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:19.609
and I picked up an
honors French class.

00:17:19.609 --> 00:17:23.089
And I called a professor who
was teaching a graduate level

00:17:23.089 --> 00:17:24.640
seminar on the
Harlem Renaissance.

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:26.900
And I was like, will you
let me in your class?

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:28.670
I've never taken any of these
African-American Studies

00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:30.503
classes, but this sounds
really interesting.

00:17:30.503 --> 00:17:31.430
And she let me in.

00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:32.990
And it was the
first class I took

00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:35.840
at Wisconsin that didn't have,
like, 600 people in my class.

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:37.410
It was, like, 30 people--

00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:39.357
no, like, maybe 20 people.

00:17:39.357 --> 00:17:40.940
And I remember raising
my hand one day

00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:43.190
and asking who
W.E.B. Du Bois was.

00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:46.317
And everyone turned
around and was like--

00:17:46.317 --> 00:17:47.780
[MAKES INQUISITIVE NOISE]

00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:49.880
But I ended up double
majoring after taking

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:52.390
three of Sandra Adell's classes
in African-American Studies.

00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:54.440
So I always tell
people, depending

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:56.142
on the crowd and the
television camera,

00:17:56.142 --> 00:17:58.100
that I majored in books
and black people, which

00:17:58.100 --> 00:17:59.840
is why I became a bartender.

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:02.720
But for me, my
career has largely

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:08.180
been based off of growing up,
listening to early rap music,

00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:09.980
and seeing how this
rap music turned

00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:12.140
into this hip-hop
culture, and how

00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:15.110
certain artists
within that culture

00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:19.040
were able to identify
elements of rap music

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:22.550
that could be extrapolated
into fashion or into liquid

00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:26.350
or into design or into
many different disciplines.

00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:28.700
And I feel like with
cocktails, there

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:30.620
is a culture to cocktails.

00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:34.910
There's a sort of sensibility
that manifests itself.

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:37.040
And I feel like a
lot of the projects

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:40.490
I choose, whether it be
designing my own bar bag,

00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:44.450
or working on a spice line
with a friend who mostly works

00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:48.860
with chefs, or collaborating
with American Express

00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:51.050
to do cocktails in
airports, where it's usually

00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:54.140
impossible to get
a good cocktail,

00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:58.490
these are opportunities for
me to bring cocktail culture

00:18:58.490 --> 00:19:02.420
or bring elements of our
culture to a place where

00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:04.310
maybe people didn't
realize they wanted it

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:05.500
and they would want it.

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:09.080
And it allows me to
work with people who

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:11.090
have skills that I don't have.

00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:15.180
I really enjoy meeting Googlers.

00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:18.740
I remember at the last
Google talk I did,

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:21.170
Nick Anderer, who was the
chef at Gramercy Tavern

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:24.560
and now is the chef at Maialino,
his brother is a brain surgeon

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:27.800
and introduced me to Googler,
who, after his Google talk,

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:29.210
emailed me.

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:33.456
And he actually went and
used my app and he created--

00:19:33.456 --> 00:19:35.330
you guys, I'm sure, know
what this is called.

00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:38.910
But it was, like, a data map
that was in three dimensions.

00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:41.660
And so there were certain
nodes where an ingredient was,

00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:44.072
and every drink that
used that ingredient

00:19:44.072 --> 00:19:45.280
had all of these lines in it.

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:48.030
And it was this crazy
three-dimensional map,

00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:52.100
so you could kind of see which
ingredients you use the most.

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:53.056
It was like a cloud.

00:19:53.056 --> 00:19:53.930
And it was brilliant.

00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:56.000
So I feel like for
me, the projects

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.430
that I gravitate towards are
the ones that take me out

00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:03.800
of my Dungeons and Dragons-esque
culture into, ideally, a more

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:07.890
broad universe where I can speak
to people of other disciplines

00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:12.704
and figure out where we can
sort of find common ground.

00:20:12.704 --> 00:20:13.370
AMY STARR: Yeah.

00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:14.762
And more to learn, always.

00:20:14.762 --> 00:20:15.470
JIM MEEHAN: Yeah.

00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:17.150
AMY STARR: Kind of a
Choose Your Own Adventure.

00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:18.358
JIM MEEHAN: But not choosing.

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:23.280
AMY STARR: Finding the
dark alley to go down next.

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:25.100
With that being said,
then, any red flags?

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:27.530
Do you have a standard
set of red flags

00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:30.260
being like, definitely not
going down that dark alley?

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:31.730
That dark alley's a no.

00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:33.020
JIM MEEHAN: I am a red flag.

00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:34.880
AMY STARR: I'll choose
this less dim one.

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:37.190
JIM MEEHAN: One
of my colleagues,

00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:40.040
who was employing me-- so
I guess he was my boss--

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:43.330
he once called me
his "insult-ant,"

00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:45.190
not his consultant.

00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:48.820
And I find that the
red flags are really,

00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:51.340
in all of my
projects, do you have

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:56.530
an affinity for being honest,
being open, being transparent?

00:20:56.530 --> 00:20:59.534
I find that a lot of people
you meet in the world,

00:20:59.534 --> 00:21:02.200
especially people who have a lot
of power, unfortunately, really

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:05.110
just want you to
affirm what they think.

00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:08.010
They're looking for
people to validate them.

00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:09.240
AMY STARR: Yes, they are.

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:12.390
JIM MEEHAN: And I don't think
about the title of the person

00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:14.610
that I'm talking to
or how rich they are

00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:17.410
or what school they went to
or how much they can bench

00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:19.870
press before I tell
them what I think.

00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:22.120
And the people who have
a problem with that

00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:24.070
generally don't enjoy
working with me.

00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:27.340
So I'm, fortunately
or unfortunately,

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:28.690
my own best red flag.

00:21:32.410 --> 00:21:33.910
AMY STARR: In terms
of new projects,

00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:37.880
and once you've kind of
found that new route,

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:41.290
do generally find inspiration
like you find an opportunity,

00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:47.050
or do you have any traditions
or methodologies to help you

00:21:47.050 --> 00:21:48.945
get past a creative roadblock?

00:21:48.945 --> 00:21:51.070
JIM MEEHAN: I don't have
creative roadblocks, which

00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:51.345
sounds--

00:21:51.345 --> 00:21:51.620
AMY STARR: Lucky you.

00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:53.560
JIM MEEHAN: --really
sort of pretentious.

00:21:53.560 --> 00:22:00.100
But I feel like for me, the
way in which I work creatively,

00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:03.190
a lot of is just
based on history.

00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:06.730
And I would say that with
respect to cocktails,

00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:09.790
I'm not a fashion designer,
but I would imagine

00:22:09.790 --> 00:22:12.040
creating cocktails or
even cocktail programs is

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:14.380
a lot like either creating
a piece of clothing

00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:16.600
or creating a line of clothing.

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:20.560
And a lot of it really
is reflective of history.

00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:22.600
And I would say that
for any of you who

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:26.960
have been into cocktails
for any period of time,

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:30.250
it's amazing how
what's old becomes new

00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:32.260
and what was just
recently popular

00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:35.830
kind of goes out of style, even
though it was a good thing.

00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:38.950
And you'll find at
times, also, that things

00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:41.990
are starting to creep back in
that shouldn't be creeping back

00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:42.490
in.

00:22:42.490 --> 00:22:46.070
But they're coming back because
of the way the pendulum swings.

00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:50.110
And I find that for me,
personally, by studying history

00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:52.840
as a designer or as
a sort of creative,

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:57.010
I understand where things are
going because I understand

00:22:57.010 --> 00:22:59.040
where they've been.

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:01.030
And I don't look
at only cocktails.

00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:04.900
I look at general zeitgeist.

00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:08.020
Creativity is something, I
would say, that, for me--

00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:10.332
especially having lived in
New York, I would say that--

00:23:10.332 --> 00:23:12.790
and this would probably make
some creative people unhappy--

00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:15.880
but it's like, in some ways,
being creative or being

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:18.540
innovative is really a matter--

00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:22.900
at Google, this must feel
good, because it is probably

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:24.490
what you do and are.

00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:25.990
But in so many
ways, being creative

00:23:25.990 --> 00:23:28.240
is about connecting
the dots, and it's

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:31.660
about taking data and putting
it together and packaging it

00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:33.490
in such a way, and
then really kind

00:23:33.490 --> 00:23:35.980
of racing to get it out
first and to get it out

00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:40.480
in such a way that
resonates with an audience.

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:43.840
I know you wanted to ask
me about naming cocktails.

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:48.990
But it's so interesting--
to preempt the question--

00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:50.740
AMY STARR: Tell us
about naming cocktails.

00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:51.448
JIM MEEHAN: Yeah.

00:23:51.448 --> 00:23:55.210
So I mean, I would say
that with naming cocktails,

00:23:55.210 --> 00:23:57.580
some designers or
creatives would say there's

00:23:57.580 --> 00:23:59.290
nothing new under the sun.

00:23:59.290 --> 00:24:02.380
But with cocktails,
a lot of it really

00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:05.131
revolves around putting
together the ingredients

00:24:05.131 --> 00:24:06.880
or putting together
the different elements

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:08.050
of a cocktail.

00:24:08.050 --> 00:24:09.710
That's, like, half
of the battle.

00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:12.820
The other half the battle
is naming the drink

00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:16.210
and giving those
elements a name.

00:24:16.210 --> 00:24:18.730
I would say that the
name of a cocktail

00:24:18.730 --> 00:24:21.670
is really, in many ways, its
business plan or its marketing

00:24:21.670 --> 00:24:22.240
plan.

00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:26.980
And with respect to the first
drink you had, the Tall Boxes,

00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:29.830
you know, what do
you call a brandy

00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:31.990
Old Fashioned that
you've sort of not

00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:34.810
really done that much to except
maybe "Frank Lloyd Wright-ify"

00:24:34.810 --> 00:24:35.830
it?

00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:37.690
Well, you have to think
of, all right, well

00:24:37.690 --> 00:24:39.760
what is going to be catchy?

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:42.311
When I think of a cocktail
name, I think about,

00:24:42.311 --> 00:24:44.560
is this something that people
can pronounce in English

00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:46.450
and Spanish and Korean?

00:24:46.450 --> 00:24:50.140
Is it something
that's easy to spell?

00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:51.730
A lot of times young
bartenders will

00:24:51.730 --> 00:24:53.230
create a drink with
tequila and come up

00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:54.370
with a Spanish name for it.

00:24:54.370 --> 00:24:55.930
And you're just like, come on.

00:24:55.930 --> 00:24:59.260
So with respect to the Tall
Boxes, the origin of that name

00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:02.540
was that Frank Lloyd
Wright, 100 years ago,

00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:06.790
was describing skyscrapers with
what he called "tall boxes."

00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:09.470
And he was saying
it with some scorn.

00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:14.110
And it's interesting,
with that first drink,

00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:17.620
most people would think of
the brandy Old Fashioned

00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:20.020
with the garbage in
it with some scorn.

00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:22.360
So Frank Lloyd Wright
actually ended up

00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:23.990
designing some skyscrapers.

00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:26.020
None of them really
got built. But the idea

00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:29.560
was bringing in the
concept of Prairie School

00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:31.360
and bringing Frank
Lloyd Wright in,

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:34.210
in a sort of tangential
way to this drink

00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:36.280
that kind of ties in everything.

00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:40.340
And in many ways, to me,
a great cocktail title

00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:43.080
ties in as many different
elements as possible.

00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:47.630
And so it signifies, on
a very elemental level.

00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:50.850
But that signification
can go down low.

00:25:50.850 --> 00:25:55.970
One of the things I've realized,
as I speak about my trade,

00:25:55.970 --> 00:25:59.870
is that information
is like an iceberg.

00:25:59.870 --> 00:26:03.300
Present too much information
to people, like an iceberg,

00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:07.220
if we were all in our canoe
as the polar ice caps melt

00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:08.780
and icebergs won't
exist anymore--

00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:12.560
but imagine the polar ice caps
still had icebergs in them,

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:15.830
and we were in a boat, and
you saw a giant iceberg.

00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:18.320
What you would do is, you
would probably sail around it

00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:20.540
so your ship didn't
crash into the iceberg.

00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:21.590
Information is like that.

00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:24.720
Show too much ice, the
person goes way around it.

00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:26.270
I don't to know
this much about it.

00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:27.734
Show too little
ice, and then you

00:26:27.734 --> 00:26:29.900
crash your boat up right
against it and you capsize.

00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:33.200
So I find that a drink like
the Tall Boxes, you could just

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:35.870
not really understand why
it's called the Tall Boxes,

00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:36.830
order it, drink it.

00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:37.710
Fine.

00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:39.630
But there's a lot
more underneath it.

00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:41.240
And then the same
thing kind of goes

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:45.800
for this next drink we
have, the King Kamehameha.

00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:48.230
Fortunately, our
director of operations

00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:51.890
grew up in Hawaii, so he was
able to correctly show me

00:26:51.890 --> 00:26:53.990
how to say Kamehameha.

00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:55.280
AMY STARR: I googled it.

00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:56.030
JIM MEEHAN: Yeah.

00:26:56.030 --> 00:26:56.863
You could Google it.

00:26:56.863 --> 00:26:59.810
But you have to use the,
like, pronounce-it app.

00:26:59.810 --> 00:27:02.720
But this is just a
traditional punch.

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:05.630
So this is a
Taiwanese tea that's

00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:08.510
really sort of rich
and sweet and kind

00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:12.710
of tobacco-y with a pot-stilled
rum with lemon juice,

00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:14.660
maple syrup, and just nutmeg.

00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:18.630
And I chose to name it
the King Kamehameha.

00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:23.570
I was sort of stretching
here, but Frank Lloyd Wright c

00:27:23.570 --> 00:27:25.560
structures all over the world.

00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:27.560
And one of his
structures was recently

00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:30.300
rebuilt by Taliesin
Architects in Hawaii.

00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:34.640
So obviously, a drink that
has sort of a rum punch

00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:38.390
would make sense to have a sort
of Frank Lloyd Wright-y sort

00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:39.350
of tropical element.

00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:40.890
Not all of our
drinks, by the way,

00:27:40.890 --> 00:27:45.460
are named after
Frank Lloyd Wright.

00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:46.160
AMY STARR: OK.

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:48.740
Let's talk more about
how technology ties in.

00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:52.700
You discuss, in your history
section of the manual--

00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:54.350
but also, as you
briefly said earlier,

00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:57.200
you spent a lot of time
with cocktail books.

00:27:57.200 --> 00:28:00.770
And it wasn't always so easy
to find these original editions

00:28:00.770 --> 00:28:01.980
and everything else.

00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:03.860
Now that we have
the internet readily

00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:05.780
at our fingertips at all times--

00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:08.390
we have Google here--

00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:13.310
and as Googlers, and as a
verb that we use most often,

00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:17.390
how else has technology been
integrated into the hospitality

00:28:17.390 --> 00:28:18.290
world?

00:28:18.290 --> 00:28:22.680
And how do you think we can
be more careful and thoughtful

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:24.330
in how we use it?

00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:26.580
JIM MEEHAN: This is
a great question.

00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:28.420
I was sort of like,
ooh, this is tough.

00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:31.500
So if you look at
modern cocktail history,

00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:34.890
one of my favorite books was
"Vintage Spirits and Forgotten

00:28:34.890 --> 00:28:36.000
Cocktails" by Ted Haigh.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.290
And Ted Haigh was the
original moderator on one

00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:42.840
of AOL'S chat groups.

00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:46.350
And if you look at where this
modern cocktail renaissance

00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:49.680
came back, the second
edition of his book

00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:52.860
actually has an
additional chapter

00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:55.350
that was 25 of the most
influential cocktail

00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:56.550
bloggers of all times.

00:28:56.550 --> 00:28:59.880
And I remember when I bought
this book, as a guy who

00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:02.340
thinks he's an important
modern bartender,

00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:04.150
I looked at the
back of this book,

00:29:04.150 --> 00:29:07.560
and I was like, why is this guy
giving credit to 25 bloggers

00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:09.350
instead of actually
giving credit to--

00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:11.790
because it came out many years
later-- to the bartenders

00:29:11.790 --> 00:29:13.680
who actually brought
the drinks back?

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:16.230
And many years later, as I've
sat here and shrunk my head

00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:17.820
and become less
of an egomaniac, I

00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:20.500
realized that if you
read that chapter,

00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:25.410
you'll see how important
DrinkBoy and all

00:29:25.410 --> 00:29:27.960
of the early cocktail--

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:31.470
how, basically, this
renaissance was incubated

00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:33.720
in internet chat rooms.

00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:37.607
And I don't have a cogent,
long argument to make here,

00:29:37.607 --> 00:29:38.940
and I won't make it to you guys.

00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:42.330
But I would argue that the
reason why the cocktail

00:29:42.330 --> 00:29:45.690
renaissance kind of came back
had a lot to do with technology

00:29:45.690 --> 00:29:47.700
and had a lot to do
with technologists being

00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:49.390
really interested in cocktails.

00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:52.610
The two guys that
I opened PDT with,

00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:54.690
Don Lee, who
created our Benton's

00:29:54.690 --> 00:29:59.100
Old Fashioned, and John
[INAUDIBLE],, who's a CTO.

00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:03.330
He goes from one company to the
next and gets another buyout,

00:30:03.330 --> 00:30:06.490
and just keeps getting
richer and richer.

00:30:06.490 --> 00:30:08.520
But it's two tech guys.

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:10.530
And I find that it's amazing--

00:30:10.530 --> 00:30:13.230
whenever I meet programmers,
they're always into cocktails,

00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:16.140
and always know way
more about it than I do.

00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:20.730
So I would say that the whole
modern cocktail renaissance

00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:25.230
kind of came about with the rise
of the internet and information

00:30:25.230 --> 00:30:26.520
technology.

00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:31.980
But in many ways, Prairie School
is a response to something

00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:34.470
which I haven't liked
over the last, probably,

00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:37.410
five, six, seven, eight years,
which is, what I've found

00:30:37.410 --> 00:30:39.870
is that as so many
bartenders learn

00:30:39.870 --> 00:30:42.810
how to bartend on
YouTube from watching

00:30:42.810 --> 00:30:44.820
YouTube videos of their
favorite bartenders

00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:50.310
in London or in Japan or in
Singapore or in Barcelona, what

00:30:50.310 --> 00:30:55.080
I've found is, there's been
a homogenization of cocktail

00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:55.710
styles.

00:30:55.710 --> 00:30:59.010
When I finally got
the chance to travel,

00:30:59.010 --> 00:31:01.230
probably starting
around 2003 or 2004

00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:03.600
to visit distilleries
and other bars

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:06.360
and bartenders all over the
world, it was very cool to me

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:09.480
how this sort of throwing
techniques, which you'll

00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:12.840
see progressive,
trying-too-hard bars

00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:15.000
nowadays probably
here in Chicago,

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.650
that came from Morocco.

00:31:16.650 --> 00:31:19.980
And then really, you would
only see that in Barcelona.

00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:22.350
And then the Japanese
hard shake, obviously,

00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:24.690
came from Tokyo, and was
brought all over the world

00:31:24.690 --> 00:31:29.010
by a bartender from Bratislava
in Stanislav Vardrna.

00:31:29.010 --> 00:31:31.050
But to make a long
story short, now,

00:31:31.050 --> 00:31:34.080
when you go to a
bar in Indianapolis,

00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:36.420
you'll see the Japanese
hard shake technique,

00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:38.970
you'll see the
[INAUDIBLE] long throw,

00:31:38.970 --> 00:31:42.300
you'll see Australian chat.

00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:48.150
And you'll just see this sort
of monster hybrid homogenization

00:31:48.150 --> 00:31:52.950
of this perfect cocktail
competition-winning bartender

00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:57.270
that, to me, has lost
its "Indianapolis-ness."

00:31:57.270 --> 00:32:02.490
And I find that when I go to
a great bar in Indianapolis,

00:32:02.490 --> 00:32:04.800
it has the same bottles
on the back bar,

00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:08.640
the same Japanese cocktail
shakers as in Tokyo.

00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:11.250
It's like the same
bar everywhere.

00:32:11.250 --> 00:32:13.700
The bars in Berlin are like
the bars in Indianapolis

00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:16.680
are like the bars in Auckland
are like the bars in Moscow.

00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:20.460
And I've found
that, in some ways,

00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:23.790
it takes the joy
out of going to bars

00:32:23.790 --> 00:32:26.790
and finding the weird
idiosyncratic tics that

00:32:26.790 --> 00:32:28.590
make certain people
the way they are.

00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:33.600
I've found that culture is
incubated and sort of preserved

00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:36.510
quite beautifully in its
culinary and drinking

00:32:36.510 --> 00:32:37.740
traditions.

00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:41.430
And I find, in some ways,
that YouTube mostly, but also

00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:44.790
the internet, has sort
of made us more global.

00:32:44.790 --> 00:32:46.830
And I think that's
certainly a great thing.

00:32:46.830 --> 00:32:48.375
But the challenge is--

00:32:48.375 --> 00:32:51.000
and it's a question I would ask
you guys-- how do we figure out

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:56.610
ways to better preserve
our unique cultural sort

00:32:56.610 --> 00:33:00.720
of weirdness, like our
brandy Old Fashioned?

00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:01.960
I think Malort's terrible.

00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:05.370
But how do you
make sure that you

00:33:05.370 --> 00:33:08.790
know that Malort is something
that these weird Chicago

00:33:08.790 --> 00:33:11.145
people like drinking, even
though it's not delicious?

00:33:11.145 --> 00:33:12.720
AMY STARR: Without
homogenizing everything.

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:13.170
JIM MEEHAN: Right.

00:33:13.170 --> 00:33:13.570
AMY STARR: Yeah.

00:33:13.570 --> 00:33:14.278
JIM MEEHAN: Yeah.

00:33:14.278 --> 00:33:17.130
Like, I don't want to drink
Jeppson's Malort in Berlin,

00:33:17.130 --> 00:33:19.860
even though you like
Chicago in Berlin.

00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:21.635
AMY STARR: Hey, Chicago!

00:33:21.635 --> 00:33:22.257
Drink Malort!

00:33:22.257 --> 00:33:23.840
JIM MEEHAN: Actually,
I think Malort--

00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:24.465
well, whatever.

00:33:24.465 --> 00:33:27.356
I'll leave Malort
alone for a minute.

00:33:27.356 --> 00:33:28.230
AMY STARR: All right.

00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:30.402
We want to prepare for some Q&amp;A.

00:33:30.402 --> 00:33:31.110
JIM MEEHAN: Yeah.

00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:32.151
We got five more minutes.

00:33:32.151 --> 00:33:33.897
AMY STARR: We got
some questions here.

00:33:33.897 --> 00:33:35.980
I hope you all have some
questions to ask for Jim.

00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:42.330
Volunteers here will
bring the mic to you.

00:33:42.330 --> 00:33:43.410
Miss?

00:33:43.410 --> 00:33:47.360
And just wait until we
have the mic in your hand.

00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:50.580
AUDIENCE: So a question
about naming the cocktails--

00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:52.990
how often do people ask
you about the names?

00:33:52.990 --> 00:33:56.250
And are you kind of secretly
hoping that they do?

00:33:56.250 --> 00:33:58.380
JIM MEEHAN: I am really
hoping that people

00:33:58.380 --> 00:34:01.900
ask lots of questions.

00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:02.400
Yes.

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:06.440
So I mean, I wish people
asked lots of questions.

00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:09.659
Part of what I would
consider great bartending,

00:34:09.659 --> 00:34:12.659
going back to that iceberg
theory of information,

00:34:12.659 --> 00:34:15.179
is really gathering
a sense of why

00:34:15.179 --> 00:34:16.800
someone has come to your bar.

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:18.660
And I mention this in
the service chapter.

00:34:21.659 --> 00:34:26.489
A huge part of bartending
is just reading the data,

00:34:26.489 --> 00:34:28.429
looking at the situation.

00:34:28.429 --> 00:34:34.980
So for instance, I
think, in some ways,

00:34:34.980 --> 00:34:38.219
just like in life, we
all want to be noticed.

00:34:38.219 --> 00:34:41.070
We all want to be
interesting and desirable

00:34:41.070 --> 00:34:43.980
and want people to
ask us all the things

00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:45.540
that we are passionate about.

00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:48.360
So yes, in my
narcissistic little heart,

00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:50.670
I would love for you
to ask me about how

00:34:50.670 --> 00:34:53.310
I came up with these
little children of mine.

00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:56.159
But realistically,
when you show up

00:34:56.159 --> 00:35:01.710
at the bar with your suitcase
or looking at your Tinder app

00:35:01.710 --> 00:35:04.950
or with your parents--

00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:07.560
there's a lot of reasons
why people come to a bar.

00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:09.600
And I think a great
bartender understands

00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:14.160
that you have to serve the guest
based on why they're there.

00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:16.047
So yes, the answer
to the question

00:35:16.047 --> 00:35:17.880
is, I do want you to
ask me about my drinks.

00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:20.790
But I have to be
disciplined and I

00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:23.010
have to understand that you
might be there for a date

00:35:23.010 --> 00:35:25.860
or for a business meeting or
to catch up with your friends

00:35:25.860 --> 00:35:28.320
or just to get any old drink.

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:31.980
And I have to give
you that experience.

00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:35.730
And I think that,
with respect to bars,

00:35:35.730 --> 00:35:38.640
and especially with
respect to cocktail bars,

00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:42.660
I would describe bars,
and especially my bars,

00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:45.220
as what I would call
elaborate traps.

00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:48.900
And what I mean by that
is that so many times,

00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:50.550
you'll go to a cocktail bar.

00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:54.169
And let's just say we
go to cocktail bars,

00:35:54.169 --> 00:35:55.710
usually, because
you hear about them.

00:35:55.710 --> 00:36:00.540
And if Mary Doyle, your amazing
PR and marketing director,

00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:03.000
does such a great job, you're
in the media all the time.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.370
So people come because they
read about you somewhere.

00:36:05.370 --> 00:36:07.260
But in the event you
don't have a Mary Doyle

00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:09.350
or you're 10 or 11
years old like PDT

00:36:09.350 --> 00:36:11.100
and no one writes about
you because you're

00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:13.020
10 or 11 years
old, your business

00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:14.460
is driven by word of mouth.

00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:17.160
And so most of the people
who come to the bars

00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:20.340
that I am involved with
are coming because someone

00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:21.200
brought them there.

00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:24.950
And the reality is, that someone
is probably a cocktail geek.

00:36:24.950 --> 00:36:27.630
But the five people that
they bring, one of them

00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:29.100
might be a cocktail geek.

00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:30.960
But probably the other
three or four of them

00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:32.910
are only there because
they like their friend.

00:36:32.910 --> 00:36:34.734
And maybe they
hate cocktail bars.

00:36:34.734 --> 00:36:36.900
And so a lot of times,
they'll go to a cocktail bar.

00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:38.850
They don't even want
to go to this bar.

00:36:38.850 --> 00:36:40.381
And then they'll
look at the menu.

00:36:40.381 --> 00:36:41.880
They'll not see
anything on the menu

00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:43.463
that they want because
they don't like

00:36:43.463 --> 00:36:44.814
cocktails and cocktail bars.

00:36:44.814 --> 00:36:46.230
And they'll order
a glass of wine.

00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:48.870
And the bartender
or the waiter will

00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:51.330
make them feel bad for
ordering a glass of wine.

00:36:51.330 --> 00:36:54.582
And that will reinforce why
they don't like cocktail bars.

00:36:54.582 --> 00:36:56.040
And then they'll
just be miserable.

00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:58.530
And what I like to
happen in my bars

00:36:58.530 --> 00:37:01.620
is, you get dragged by
your friend to my bar,

00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:03.900
and you order a glass of
wine, and the server is not

00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:07.080
mean to you, and they have
a somewhat thoughtful glass

00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:08.370
of wine to order.

00:37:08.370 --> 00:37:09.870
And then you get
your glass of wine,

00:37:09.870 --> 00:37:11.536
and you realize
everyone else around you

00:37:11.536 --> 00:37:12.780
is drinking cocktails.

00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:16.680
And you have, like, 20 minutes
to actually take in the scene,

00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:18.690
maybe try some of your
colleagues' drinks.

00:37:18.690 --> 00:37:20.970
And by 20 minutes
later, the chances

00:37:20.970 --> 00:37:23.694
that you are open to
one of these cocktails

00:37:23.694 --> 00:37:25.860
becomes greater, and then
maybe you order a cocktail

00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:26.818
the second time around.

00:37:26.818 --> 00:37:28.560
And then you're mine.

00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:32.370
So that's sort of
the way in which I

00:37:32.370 --> 00:37:33.450
think bars should be run.

00:37:36.944 --> 00:37:37.485
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:37:37.485 --> 00:37:39.220
So this is kind of
a personal question.

00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:40.130
So I'm from Cuba.

00:37:40.130 --> 00:37:43.160
And my favorite cocktail
is a daiquiri-- like,

00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:44.240
a classic daiquiri.

00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:47.060
And it's incredibly
hard around the city

00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:49.750
to get a bartender to even
know what I'm talking about.

00:37:49.750 --> 00:37:53.490
They'll always immediately go to
the frozen daiquiri party scene

00:37:53.490 --> 00:37:55.589
of New Orleans or something.

00:37:55.589 --> 00:37:57.380
And I'm curious what
your take is on that--

00:37:57.380 --> 00:38:00.740
on sort of these classic
cocktails being either

00:38:00.740 --> 00:38:06.200
forgotten or kind of shifting
to this super popular sugary

00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:06.800
frozen--

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:09.690
AMY STARR: We gotta find out
where you're hanging out first.

00:38:09.690 --> 00:38:11.780
AUDIENCE: I mean,
even nice bars,

00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:13.280
they will have a
hard time sometimes

00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:14.345
making a good daiquiri.

00:38:14.345 --> 00:38:15.720
JIM MEEHAN: The
struggle is real.

00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:18.850
So the second drink you
had, the King Kamehameha,

00:38:18.850 --> 00:38:20.900
is made with Banks 7 rum.

00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:25.190
I helped create
that brand and have

00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:28.190
been working as an international
brand ambassador of sorts

00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:31.070
for Banks since 2009.

00:38:31.070 --> 00:38:35.090
And this involved me making
daiquiris all over the world.

00:38:35.090 --> 00:38:39.620
And I will say that the
daiquiri is the hardest drink

00:38:39.620 --> 00:38:41.270
to make in the entire world.

00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:44.342
And it's funny.

00:38:44.342 --> 00:38:45.050
I agree with you.

00:38:45.050 --> 00:38:48.204
When I first started introducing
the daiquiri to people,

00:38:48.204 --> 00:38:50.870
a lot of times, you go to a bar,
and you'd asked for a daiquiri,

00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:52.245
and they'd say,
oh, I'm so sorry,

00:38:52.245 --> 00:38:54.080
we're out of strawberries,
or, I'm so sorry.

00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:54.310
AMY STARR: No blender.

00:38:54.310 --> 00:38:55.685
JIM MEEHAN: The
blender's broken,

00:38:55.685 --> 00:38:57.140
or we don't have a blender.

00:38:57.140 --> 00:38:58.190
And you'd be like,
well, that's OK.

00:38:58.190 --> 00:38:58.790
Do you have rum?

00:38:58.790 --> 00:38:58.887
Yes.

00:38:58.887 --> 00:38:59.650
Do you have lime?

00:38:59.650 --> 00:39:00.150
Yes.

00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:00.680
Do you have sugar?

00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:01.160
Yes.

00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:02.535
I'm like, we can
make a daiquiri.

00:39:02.535 --> 00:39:07.610
But the thing I've found
is that there's nothing

00:39:07.610 --> 00:39:08.730
simple about this drink.

00:39:08.730 --> 00:39:12.710
The limes change
pH all the time.

00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:16.100
A barista would
be better equipped

00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:17.900
mentally to make a daiquiri.

00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:20.330
Because they understand
that the coffee

00:39:20.330 --> 00:39:23.240
bean, their main material, is
an ever-changing agricultural

00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:24.080
product.

00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:25.270
The lime is as well.

00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:27.350
Their sweetness and
sourness and "limeyness"

00:39:27.350 --> 00:39:28.820
change at all times.

00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:32.480
The simple syrup that you
use to make the daiquiri

00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:36.650
changes based on the aptitude
and interest and focus

00:39:36.650 --> 00:39:39.560
of the person who makes the
simple syrup for your bar.

00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:44.000
Or if you're so sad that
you buy sugar syrup in,

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.070
that sugar syrup is
filled with stabilizers

00:39:46.070 --> 00:39:48.140
that makes it not so
simple and actually

00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:50.570
quite flavorful in a
really chemical way.

00:39:50.570 --> 00:39:52.610
And the other thing
about the daiquiri

00:39:52.610 --> 00:39:58.490
is, it is the elemental drink of
strong rum, sweet sugar, sour.

00:39:58.490 --> 00:40:00.620
So you would think
that that is something

00:40:00.620 --> 00:40:01.920
that's easy to balance.

00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:05.300
But what I've found in
my career, which I guess

00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:08.340
could also probably relate
to everyone's life--

00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:11.660
it was a very "Matrix"
moment in my career.

00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:13.600
We were talking earlier about--

00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:17.060
as a young bartender who's,
like, really serious--

00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:20.622
maybe you have a mustache or
some tattoos or shirt garters

00:40:20.622 --> 00:40:21.830
and arm garters or something.

00:40:21.830 --> 00:40:23.455
Like, you take yourself
really serious.

00:40:23.455 --> 00:40:24.710
AMY STARR: Suspenders.

00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:26.840
JIM MEEHAN: As a young bartender
that takes your craft really

00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:28.756
seriously, you spend all
of this time creating

00:40:28.756 --> 00:40:30.290
the perfect recipes.

00:40:30.290 --> 00:40:33.740
And when the guest inevitably
sends the drinks back,

00:40:33.740 --> 00:40:36.650
the first thing you think
is, what's wrong with you?

00:40:36.650 --> 00:40:42.530
And you get bitter, as opposed
to realizing that everyone

00:40:42.530 --> 00:40:43.700
has a different palate.

00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:46.370
And the truly "Matrix"
moment for me,

00:40:46.370 --> 00:40:49.880
when the bullets came
at me much more slowly

00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:51.680
and everything started
to make more sense

00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:55.340
was, I realized that if I
stopped at creating drinks

00:40:55.340 --> 00:40:58.130
with this even notion that
you could have a perfectly

00:40:58.130 --> 00:41:03.110
balanced drink, I would have a
chance in pleasing more people.

00:41:03.110 --> 00:41:05.645
So I guess the long way of
answering your question--

00:41:05.645 --> 00:41:06.470
[BEEPING]

00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:09.860
--is that-- are
we about to blow?

00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:11.780
The long way of
answering your question

00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:14.400
is, the reason why you probably
can't find a perfect daiquiri

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:17.780
is because we all have a
different conception of like,

00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:20.600
it needs to be too strong,
too sweet, too sour.

00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:22.950
And those variables, which
you would think are easy,

00:41:22.950 --> 00:41:24.150
change every day.

00:41:24.150 --> 00:41:27.500
And I would say, to
speak to your pain,

00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:30.100
that we've gotten away from--

00:41:30.100 --> 00:41:33.860
and this is me soapboxing,
saying, look what I'm doing

00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:37.130
and everyone else is
not because I'm old.

00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:39.290
We've gotten away
from elemental drinks,

00:41:39.290 --> 00:41:42.370
like two drinks you had-- a
classic five-ingredient punch

00:41:42.370 --> 00:41:44.150
or a classic Old Fashioned.

00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:46.400
And we want to make the
Hemingway daiquiri before we

00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:47.870
ever make the daiquiri.

00:41:47.870 --> 00:41:51.410
And I think that
these simple drinks,

00:41:51.410 --> 00:41:54.480
like the daiquiri, which is a
bike with a kickstand on it--

00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:56.990
a three-ingredient drink or
even a two-ingredient drink,

00:41:56.990 --> 00:42:00.140
like our highball, are
actually much more complicated,

00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:02.270
I would argue, to
make really well

00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:05.390
than these five-ingredient
drinks with Malort.

00:42:11.189 --> 00:42:12.980
AUDIENCE: I also went
to school at Madison.

00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:13.050
JIM MEEHAN: Yes!

00:42:13.050 --> 00:42:15.591
AUDIENCE: And I was just curious
what your favorite bar there

00:42:15.591 --> 00:42:17.340
is.

00:42:17.340 --> 00:42:19.427
JIM MEEHAN: Oh, my gosh.

00:42:19.427 --> 00:42:21.510
I worked at Paul's Club
for four and a half years,

00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:24.030
and it was my favorite
bar until they moved it.

00:42:24.030 --> 00:42:28.530
The new bar does not feel as
"Paul's Clubby" as it used to.

00:42:28.530 --> 00:42:31.620
If I had to pick a favorite
bar in Madison right now,

00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:33.230
as I think back--

00:42:33.230 --> 00:42:35.550
I mean, the bars I loved
there were around the square.

00:42:35.550 --> 00:42:36.600
So I love Jenna's.

00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:39.150
And I've always loved
The Tornado Room.

00:42:39.150 --> 00:42:42.150
I think that the bar around
the corner there is amazing.

00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:45.787
So I guess I'm going to pick
a favorite bar right now,

00:42:45.787 --> 00:42:46.620
it would be Jenna's.

00:42:52.094 --> 00:42:53.510
AUDIENCE: Working
in New York, you

00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:55.160
have a lot of great
partners there--

00:42:55.160 --> 00:43:00.860
Brian Miller, Dale DeGroff,
the late Sasha Petraske.

00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:04.280
Do you have any main influences
while you working there?

00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:05.960
JIM MEEHAN: Yeah.

00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:09.320
When I moved to New York, I
moved to Stanton and Clinton,

00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:12.950
and I was very fortunate to be
there right when wd~50 opened.

00:43:12.950 --> 00:43:17.480
So Eben Freeman was the
head bartender there.

00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:20.270
And Shiller's
Liquor Bar actually

00:43:20.270 --> 00:43:23.960
opened over on Norfolk and
Rivington just maybe a year

00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:24.870
or two after that.

00:43:24.870 --> 00:43:28.400
So I was very fortunate when I
moved there to be able to have

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:33.140
shift drinks with Eben at wd~50.

00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:37.205
Dewey Dufresne, Wiley's dad,
was a really amazing wine

00:43:37.205 --> 00:43:38.240
and spirits collector.

00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:42.710
And I drank most of the 1900s
armagnac for free during those

00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:44.010
days.

00:43:44.010 --> 00:43:48.920
And Dushan Jaric and Jay Kosmas,
who opened Employees Only,

00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:52.790
the last bar that they worked
out for Keith McNally was

00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:53.640
at Shiller's.

00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:57.660
So between those two bars, it
was sort of really influential

00:43:57.660 --> 00:43:58.160
for me.

00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:01.040
And then my first
sort of aha moment

00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:04.820
was when Eben took me late
one night to Milk and Honey

00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:06.400
in 2003.

00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:08.870
I'll never forget going there.

00:44:08.870 --> 00:44:11.870
Joseph Schwartz, who opened
Little Branch with Sasha

00:44:11.870 --> 00:44:14.177
was working on the
floor, and Toby Maloney,

00:44:14.177 --> 00:44:16.010
who opened the Violet
Hour here and ended up

00:44:16.010 --> 00:44:18.800
opening The Pegu Club as
the head bartender with me,

00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:19.730
was behind the bar.

00:44:19.730 --> 00:44:22.550
And I had a Gold Rush cocktail.

00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:25.730
And it was a drink that TJ
Siegel, who was Sasha's best

00:44:25.730 --> 00:44:26.600
friend, created.

00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:29.120
And it was a simple combination
of bourbon and lemon juice

00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:31.010
and honey.

00:44:31.010 --> 00:44:35.090
Both Toby and Joseph were
wearing the banker's garb.

00:44:35.090 --> 00:44:37.790
And Joseph had this
beautiful silver tray

00:44:37.790 --> 00:44:41.870
with a candle on it.

00:44:41.870 --> 00:44:45.770
And he was just very elegant
and very accommodating

00:44:45.770 --> 00:44:46.670
in the way served it.

00:44:46.670 --> 00:44:49.850
They served this drink to me
in an ice cold Old Fashioned

00:44:49.850 --> 00:44:53.030
glass with a hand-carved
piece of ice.

00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:56.240
Going back to the daiquiri,
it was a perfect sour

00:44:56.240 --> 00:45:00.250
with Eljah Craig and
lemon juice and honey.

00:45:00.250 --> 00:45:01.830
And the environment was amazing.

00:45:01.830 --> 00:45:05.060
One of the things that has been
sort of lost in translation

00:45:05.060 --> 00:45:08.330
as we think about this sort
of modern cocktail renaissance

00:45:08.330 --> 00:45:11.180
is that Milk and Honey,
really, back in those days,

00:45:11.180 --> 00:45:12.050
was a refuge.

00:45:12.050 --> 00:45:15.440
Before apps were the way
that people met each other,

00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:16.970
people met each other in bars.

00:45:16.970 --> 00:45:20.960
And bars were really sort of, in
my opinion, somewhat predatory,

00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:22.580
knuckle-dragging
places where people

00:45:22.580 --> 00:45:25.170
kind of just like glommed onto
each other and got wasted.

00:45:25.170 --> 00:45:28.640
And I didn't really like that.

00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:30.510
Milk and Honey was
like going to church.

00:45:30.510 --> 00:45:36.480
And so that was sort of a huge
game-changing moment for me,

00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:38.780
where I was considering
focusing on wine

00:45:38.780 --> 00:45:40.910
and maybe being a
sommelier when I grew up.

00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:42.729
And I realized
that, at that point,

00:45:42.729 --> 00:45:44.270
I'd been a bartender
for eight years,

00:45:44.270 --> 00:45:47.540
really loved it, and saw
this kind of escape route

00:45:47.540 --> 00:45:49.550
into bartending.

00:45:49.550 --> 00:45:54.050
And so certainly, Sasha
and Joseph and Eben

00:45:54.050 --> 00:45:56.780
were early
inspirations, and then

00:45:56.780 --> 00:46:01.250
obviously Audrey Saunders and
Julie Reiner and many others.

00:46:01.250 --> 00:46:04.550
I think that when you
speak to a lot of sort

00:46:04.550 --> 00:46:06.890
of successful people
or important people,

00:46:06.890 --> 00:46:10.130
they want to tell you that
they were inspired or mentored

00:46:10.130 --> 00:46:13.550
by the most famous people that
they know or ever worked with.

00:46:13.550 --> 00:46:16.370
And I would say,
for me, I've always

00:46:16.370 --> 00:46:18.170
made a point of trying
to learn something

00:46:18.170 --> 00:46:19.610
from everybody I worked with.

00:46:19.610 --> 00:46:22.940
And I would say that every
single person I've worked with

00:46:22.940 --> 00:46:25.250
has taught me something
about my career, about myself

00:46:25.250 --> 00:46:26.280
that I didn't know.

00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:29.480
And I maintain
that if you remain

00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:32.360
open to knowing
more about yourself

00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:36.920
and more about your
craft through being open,

00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:40.220
working with others, I feel
like you continue to learn.

00:46:40.220 --> 00:46:43.470
I was sitting at Prairie
School last time here--

00:46:43.470 --> 00:46:45.470
I've actually never tended
bar at Prairie School

00:46:45.470 --> 00:46:46.967
yet, which, to me, is--

00:46:46.967 --> 00:46:48.800
when I have to tend
bar, I know I've failed.

00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:49.910
AMY STARR: What are you
doing a little later?

00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:51.200
JIM MEEHAN: Thankfully,
you will not see me

00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:52.450
behind the bar tonight either.

00:46:52.450 --> 00:46:54.800
But I watched one
of our partners--

00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:57.380
I believe it was Scott or Ed.

00:46:57.380 --> 00:46:59.844
He was holding both
jiggers in one hand, which

00:46:59.844 --> 00:47:01.760
is something that came
about while I was still

00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:03.730
behind the bar, but
I never did that.

00:47:03.730 --> 00:47:06.560
But in order to do a one
and a half ounce pour, which

00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:10.380
is something that-- you
usually either do something

00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:11.630
I don't really like very much.

00:47:11.630 --> 00:47:15.470
You pour not all the way up to
the top of the two-ounce cup,

00:47:15.470 --> 00:47:19.130
or you have to do 3/4,
3/4, it's a double pour.

00:47:19.130 --> 00:47:20.690
He flipped his
jiggers in such a way

00:47:20.690 --> 00:47:23.540
so it was a one-ounce
cup and a half-ounce cup.

00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:26.900
And he poured into both
the half and one-ounce cup,

00:47:26.900 --> 00:47:29.510
and then dumped both cups
into the mixing glass.

00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:32.210
And I watched him do
that, and I was like,

00:47:32.210 --> 00:47:35.120
I've been doing this since
1995, and I had never

00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:38.180
thought of pouring a one and a
half ounce with two jigger cups

00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:41.390
in my hand and pouring
at the same time.

00:47:41.390 --> 00:47:42.235
It's so simple.

00:47:42.235 --> 00:47:44.360
But it's just something
I'd never seen done before.

00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:47.660
And I think that those moments
for me are very exciting.

00:47:47.660 --> 00:47:49.830
And it's the reason
why I surround myself

00:47:49.830 --> 00:47:53.040
with young smart
people, and why I'm not

00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:56.730
so didactic about the
way things are done.

00:47:56.730 --> 00:47:59.940
I think if you create
enough leeway for people

00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:04.210
to do things their way as
much as they possibly can,

00:48:04.210 --> 00:48:07.185
as the boss, or as the
overseer or operator,

00:48:07.185 --> 00:48:09.810
or, really, as the person who's
responsible for everything that

00:48:09.810 --> 00:48:12.109
goes wrong, you put
yourself in a position

00:48:12.109 --> 00:48:14.400
where you can see people do
things that you never would

00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:16.680
have thought of, because
you gave them the runway

00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:17.430
to take off from.

00:48:23.260 --> 00:48:25.150
AUDIENCE: So outside of
Prairie School, which

00:48:25.150 --> 00:48:26.733
is the best bar in
Chicago, obviously,

00:48:26.733 --> 00:48:28.360
can you give us a
rundown of Chicago?

00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:29.859
What are your spots,
or where do you

00:48:29.859 --> 00:48:32.490
respect, or other cocktail bars,
or even bars, how you said,

00:48:32.490 --> 00:48:35.227
that have that nostalgic,
authentic factor?

00:48:35.227 --> 00:48:37.060
Because I think that's
an interesting angle.

00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:38.830
Obviously, we have
The Aviary right here.

00:48:38.830 --> 00:48:41.500
But there's also a lot
of good local spots,

00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:43.150
and it seems like
you're well-traveled.

00:48:43.150 --> 00:48:43.858
JIM MEEHAN: Yeah.

00:48:43.858 --> 00:48:46.030
I mean, when I was
younger, I went

00:48:46.030 --> 00:48:47.740
to all the bars in
Chicago, and that's

00:48:47.740 --> 00:48:51.160
why I don't go to all the
bars in Chicago anymore.

00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:53.240
All the miles in my
liver have been used up.

00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:55.810
But today was a great example.

00:48:55.810 --> 00:48:57.820
I showed up early
for a treatment

00:48:57.820 --> 00:49:01.690
and was sent around the corner
to a bar called The Map Room.

00:49:01.690 --> 00:49:06.040
And I was sent there
to get a cup of coffee.

00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:08.720
And it's a beer bar, from
what Google tells me.

00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:11.020
And it was amazing.

00:49:11.020 --> 00:49:13.000
Like, I walked
into this beer bar,

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:16.300
and it didn't smell
like a beer bar.

00:49:16.300 --> 00:49:17.414
I sat down at the bar.

00:49:17.414 --> 00:49:18.580
And I looked at the spirits.

00:49:18.580 --> 00:49:20.530
And while all the
bottles in the back bar

00:49:20.530 --> 00:49:24.047
had pour spouts on it,
which is a no-no in my mind,

00:49:24.047 --> 00:49:26.380
all the spirits on the back
bar were really thoughtfully

00:49:26.380 --> 00:49:28.450
chosen, great spirits.

00:49:28.450 --> 00:49:32.230
And the bartender
working, pouring coffee

00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:35.740
was this incredibly,
effusively polite,

00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:39.310
probably Mexican gentleman,
who I order a coffee from.

00:49:39.310 --> 00:49:40.450
It was a black coffee.

00:49:40.450 --> 00:49:41.890
It was an Intelligentsia coffee.

00:49:41.890 --> 00:49:43.630
And I sat in the room.

00:49:43.630 --> 00:49:46.690
And it once again had
that church-like feel.

00:49:46.690 --> 00:49:49.090
And I would say that,
with respect to Chicago,

00:49:49.090 --> 00:49:52.250
certainly there are the
Milk Rooms and the Aviaries

00:49:52.250 --> 00:49:56.910
and the Billy Sundays
and the Violet Hours.

00:49:56.910 --> 00:50:01.540
There are world class bars
that are doing next level

00:50:01.540 --> 00:50:04.600
stuff that I would put up
against the bars in San

00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:06.130
Francisco or New
York, or London.

00:50:06.130 --> 00:50:09.630
But I find that the
taverns that I visit--

00:50:09.630 --> 00:50:11.710
the sort of corner
bars in Chicago--

00:50:11.710 --> 00:50:14.470
are the ones that really
kind of blow me away.

00:50:14.470 --> 00:50:18.550
And I would go back to not
just the Midwestern sense

00:50:18.550 --> 00:50:21.400
of hospitality and
work ethic, but just

00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:25.300
the idea that drinking
in Chicago is a thing.

00:50:25.300 --> 00:50:32.620
Like, there's no guilt.
People have a hedonistic--

00:50:32.620 --> 00:50:33.880
like, Wisconsin's even better.

00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:38.860
But people eat and drink
here like it's not this thing

00:50:38.860 --> 00:50:41.290
that they shouldn't be doing,
or this thing that they're

00:50:41.290 --> 00:50:43.000
doing instead of yoga.

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:44.660
It's this thing that they do--

00:50:44.660 --> 00:50:46.380
AMY STARR: After yoga.

00:50:46.380 --> 00:50:49.820
JIM MEEHAN: Or before
yoga, or instead of yoga.

00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:51.220
Is there yoga?

00:50:51.220 --> 00:50:55.200
And I feel like the
cross-pollination of like great

00:50:55.200 --> 00:50:58.570
bars and operators,
but great guests--

00:50:58.570 --> 00:51:03.070
like, people who really
enthusiastically enjoy bars,

00:51:03.070 --> 00:51:05.770
I feel like, is what makes
drinking in Chicago great.

00:51:05.770 --> 00:51:09.100
There's a symbiotic
relationship between those

00:51:09.100 --> 00:51:11.910
who come to bars and
those who work in bars.

00:51:11.910 --> 00:51:15.580
And I would say that, in
many ways, when I opened PDT,

00:51:15.580 --> 00:51:19.150
I realized very quickly
that my staff was

00:51:19.150 --> 00:51:21.190
fully capable of
making what I thought

00:51:21.190 --> 00:51:22.560
were complicated drinks.

00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:27.580
What really became the challenge
was, in such a small bar,

00:51:27.580 --> 00:51:30.880
how can I do everything
I can to make sure

00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:33.700
that most of my guests
were sympathetic to what

00:51:33.700 --> 00:51:35.150
we were trying to do there.

00:51:35.150 --> 00:51:38.390
Because a couple of
bad people in a bar,

00:51:38.390 --> 00:51:41.320
especially a small bar,
just ruins the vibe.

00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:45.670
And in so many ways, I find that
it's so much easier to run bars

00:51:45.670 --> 00:51:48.100
in Chicago, because
most of the guests

00:51:48.100 --> 00:51:51.970
are nice, reasonable,
good, vibey people.

00:51:54.710 --> 00:51:56.780
Go to the Map Room.

00:51:56.780 --> 00:51:58.940
Have a cup of of black
Intelligentsia coffee.

00:52:01.620 --> 00:52:04.370
AUDIENCE: Let me preface
this question with,

00:52:04.370 --> 00:52:07.030
I used to live in East
Village in New York.

00:52:07.030 --> 00:52:08.044
Love PDT.

00:52:08.044 --> 00:52:08.960
JIM MEEHAN: Thank you.

00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:10.430
AUDIENCE: Didn't go
there nearly as often

00:52:10.430 --> 00:52:12.210
as I'd like to, because
it was too hard to get in.

00:52:12.210 --> 00:52:12.920
JIM MEEHAN: I apologize.

00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:15.140
That's what most people
say on the internet, too.

00:52:15.140 --> 00:52:16.660
AUDIENCE: And I got your book.

00:52:16.660 --> 00:52:17.000
JIM MEEHAN: Thank you.

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:17.870
AUDIENCE: And I
definitely appreciate

00:52:17.870 --> 00:52:19.730
all the thoughtfulness
and hard work

00:52:19.730 --> 00:52:21.560
and production
that went into it.

00:52:21.560 --> 00:52:22.476
JIM MEEHAN: Thank you.

00:52:22.476 --> 00:52:25.460
AUDIENCE: Also, looking forward
to The Aviary's cocktail book.

00:52:25.460 --> 00:52:27.500
JIM MEEHAN: Yeah, their
Kickstarter updates

00:52:27.500 --> 00:52:28.610
are unbelievable.

00:52:28.610 --> 00:52:32.020
AUDIENCE: So with that said,
you mentioned Milk and Honey.

00:52:35.856 --> 00:52:39.252
You usually don't get a
drink that's on a menu.

00:52:39.252 --> 00:52:40.460
JIM MEEHAN: There is no menu.

00:52:40.460 --> 00:52:44.990
AUDIENCE: Yeah, you want
a, how do you feel today?

00:52:44.990 --> 00:52:46.760
You know, bartenders choice.

00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:49.820
So I wanted to hear
your opinion on,

00:52:49.820 --> 00:52:52.090
which direction is
the industry going--

00:52:52.090 --> 00:52:55.670
towards well thought out,
well-named cocktails,

00:52:55.670 --> 00:53:02.030
or creative,
on-the-fly concoctions?

00:53:02.030 --> 00:53:06.950
And what is your opinion
of, which way should it go?

00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:11.750
JIM MEEHAN: Well, I think that,
going back to my "Matrix-y"

00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:14.390
Pacific Northwest answer,
I think it's going in all

00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:15.300
directions.

00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:17.540
The cocktail culture
is growing at this sort

00:53:17.540 --> 00:53:19.310
of exponential pace right now.

00:53:19.310 --> 00:53:21.960
So it is definitely
going in all directions.

00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:24.890
The reason why I
haven't chosen to go

00:53:24.890 --> 00:53:27.110
in the
choose-your-own-adventure,

00:53:27.110 --> 00:53:32.100
"how are you feeling,"
[INAUDIBLE] forked path,

00:53:32.100 --> 00:53:35.195
"let me find you a drink" style
of service that you used to get

00:53:35.195 --> 00:53:37.820
at Milk and Honey, and you still
get at some cocktail bars, is,

00:53:37.820 --> 00:53:44.990
I feel like writing a menu
is actually really hard.

00:53:44.990 --> 00:53:48.226
And coming up with the menu
and changing the menu--

00:53:48.226 --> 00:53:49.850
We have what we call
a [INAUDIBLE] menu

00:53:49.850 --> 00:53:53.140
at Prairie School, where
every two and a half weeks, we

00:53:53.140 --> 00:53:55.170
actually change a
page of our menu.

00:53:55.170 --> 00:53:59.480
We put three new drinks on, a
different black and green tea

00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:02.480
or an oolong or white
tea, and a different food

00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:05.480
dish, and a different
single-origin coffee.

00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:08.040
So that changes every
two and a half weeks.

00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:14.360
And then our full menu
changes, not in its entirety,

00:54:14.360 --> 00:54:16.850
quarterly, sort of in an
American seasonal set.

00:54:16.850 --> 00:54:22.280
So I would say that, for
me, my interest has always

00:54:22.280 --> 00:54:28.040
been sort of pitched towards
writing and towards design.

00:54:28.040 --> 00:54:30.590
And I find that the
menu is a way for me

00:54:30.590 --> 00:54:37.514
to exercise my creativity in a
way that I am passionate about

00:54:37.514 --> 00:54:38.430
and that I believe in.

00:54:38.430 --> 00:54:45.620
And I think it's
empowering to the guest.

00:54:45.620 --> 00:54:48.170
When your drink is
going to depend, really,

00:54:48.170 --> 00:54:52.490
on the ability of the bartender
to take you on the forked path

00:54:52.490 --> 00:54:54.470
that you want, if
the bartender isn't

00:54:54.470 --> 00:54:56.360
great on taking you
on that forked path,

00:54:56.360 --> 00:54:59.330
or the bartender doesn't want
to take you down all the roads

00:54:59.330 --> 00:55:01.910
that are on that path,
you, as the guest,

00:55:01.910 --> 00:55:05.180
may not really get to where
you really wanted to go.

00:55:05.180 --> 00:55:08.810
So it puts a lot of
pressure on the bar staff

00:55:08.810 --> 00:55:12.200
and on the person who trains
the bar staff when you put it

00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:13.010
all on their hands.

00:55:13.010 --> 00:55:15.080
And going back to
the question about,

00:55:15.080 --> 00:55:18.650
do you want me to
ask about the drink,

00:55:18.650 --> 00:55:20.780
not all guests want to
have that much interaction

00:55:20.780 --> 00:55:22.020
with the bartender.

00:55:22.020 --> 00:55:28.490
So going back to my simplistic,
multi-purpose iceberg analogy,

00:55:28.490 --> 00:55:35.510
that menu allows you to deeply
engage and a lot of the path

00:55:35.510 --> 00:55:37.430
we can take you on
and the way that we're

00:55:37.430 --> 00:55:39.342
going to take you,
on your own terms,

00:55:39.342 --> 00:55:41.300
ideally, if you speak
English and read English.

00:55:41.300 --> 00:55:46.760
But it's going to let you become
more empowered, I believe.

00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:50.090
Whereas that sort of
bartender-dependent,

00:55:50.090 --> 00:55:54.800
choose-your-own-adventure style
is highly dependent on the sort

00:55:54.800 --> 00:55:58.550
of knowledge and demeanor and
capabilities of the bartender,

00:55:58.550 --> 00:56:01.070
and the willingness of the
guests to want to engage

00:56:01.070 --> 00:56:05.040
in that way, which, I just
feel like not everyone does.

00:56:05.040 --> 00:56:06.530
So that's my answer.

00:56:06.530 --> 00:56:09.540
My answer would be, I have
a way of doing things.

00:56:09.540 --> 00:56:11.520
And certainly, you
can tell by my answer,

00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:14.660
I can tell you how I like it to
go, and why I like it that way.

00:56:14.660 --> 00:56:17.840
But I have so much respect
for the omakase-style cocktail

00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:19.250
experience done well.

00:56:19.250 --> 00:56:22.360
It is very hard to do well.

00:56:22.360 --> 00:56:23.859
I think we're out
of time, right?

00:56:23.859 --> 00:56:25.400
AMY STARR: We have
time for one more?

00:56:25.400 --> 00:56:25.940
All right.

00:56:25.940 --> 00:56:27.510
Well, thank you, Jim, so much.

00:56:27.510 --> 00:56:28.090
JIM MEEHAN: Thank you very much.

00:56:28.090 --> 00:56:28.390
AMY STARR: Thank you all coming.

00:56:28.390 --> 00:56:29.590
We appreciate your time.

00:56:29.590 --> 00:56:30.673
JIM MEEHAN: Thank you all.

00:56:30.673 --> 00:56:34.440
