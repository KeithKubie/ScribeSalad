you're stuck in your damn group and it's
 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.570
you're stuck in your damn group and it's
the only thing about you anyways it's

the only thing about you anyways it's
 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.699
the only thing about you anyways it's
relevant which is why we might base our

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709
relevant which is why we might base our
 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:38.670

hiring on it for example and you're

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680
hiring on it for example and you're
 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.530
hiring on it for example and you're
oppressed and even if you don't know it

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540
oppressed and even if you don't know it
 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.210
oppressed and even if you don't know it
it's only because you've internalized it

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220
it's only because you've internalized it
 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.350
it's only because you've internalized it
and it's the only thing that's real

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360
and it's the only thing that's real
 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.229
and it's the only thing that's real
about you anyways and I can't talk to

about you anyways and I can't talk to
 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:48.210
about you anyways and I can't talk to
you because I'm in my own little silo of

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220
you because I'm in my own little silo of
 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.490
you because I'm in my own little silo of
privileged belief and besides we can't

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500
privileged belief and besides we can't
 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.410
privileged belief and besides we can't
use logic because that doesn't exist and

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420
use logic because that doesn't exist and
 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.420
use logic because that doesn't exist and

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430
so you're in a group and I'm in a group
 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.690
so you're in a group and I'm in a group
and all we can do is have a war or we

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700
and all we can do is have a war or we
 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.039
and all we can do is have a war or we
can talk but we don't get to talk

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049
can talk but we don't get to talk
 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:00.300
can talk but we don't get to talk
because you can't talk if you're a

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310
because you can't talk if you're a
 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.860
because you can't talk if you're a
postmodernist because speech is just

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870
postmodernist because speech is just
 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.309
postmodernist because speech is just
chatter so it's just chatter that it

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319
chatter so it's just chatter that it
 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:08.280
chatter so it's just chatter that it
supports the people in power that's how

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290
supports the people in power that's how
 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.020
supports the people in power that's how
