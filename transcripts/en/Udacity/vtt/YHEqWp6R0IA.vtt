00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
Okay, here is my solution for a valid year.

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
It's almost identifical to valid day. We take in a year.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
First, we make sure it's all digits, then we convert it to an integer.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Then we check to see if it's within 1900 and 2020,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and if it is, we return it.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Let's go ahead and test this.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Okay, I'll start with a valid year--1995.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
We'll run this. That works.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Let's try another year--2000. Let's try that. That works. 2000.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Let's try an invalid year--1875.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
If any of our users were born in 1875, they're probably not going to enjoy using our web app.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Okay, so it returned none as we expected.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Let's try some junk strings to make sure our function doesn't blow up.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Also returning none.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Let's try another string that's too big--2300.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Also prints none, so our function is good.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Alright, good job! Let's move on.
