1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,990
We live in a sheep fucking society today.

2
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:11,860
We're all trying to be the same person.
If you look around,

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,390
we're all looking the same.

4
00:00:13,391 --> 00:00:16,660
When you go to silver lake and you get
on stage and look at the people in the

5
00:00:16,661 --> 00:00:20,620
80% of people look the same.
They all got the same fucking glasses,

6
00:00:20,621 --> 00:00:24,760
the same tight jeans, the same
fat tool. It's the Chinese side.

7
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:28,910
Everybody's wanting to meet
up month and every bodies,

8
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:34,420
you know, you wake up in the morning,
walk into a studio for an audition.

9
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,190
What does everybody have in front
of them? A couple of what? Fuck.

10
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:40,270
Book Starbuck and if
you ain't got Starbucks,

11
00:00:40,271 --> 00:00:42,940
you weren't invited to the
fucking party and it's not coffee.

12
00:00:42,941 --> 00:00:47,100
Everybody got coffee. It's the status
of going to Starbucks. Oh my God.

13
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:53,080
Oh my God. When we were growing up
in Boston, a where you lived at,

14
00:00:53,081 --> 00:00:57,400
your grandfather's in newer people have
a little fucking blue cup that's in

15
00:00:57,401 --> 00:01:00,430
coffee and went to a diner and
you said, give me a, what was the,

16
00:01:00,431 --> 00:01:02,140
what was it called? Regularly? Yeah,

17
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,540
but we didn't carry the
coffee cups like a Budweiser.

18
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:06,730
It's like when you go out and make
you take a picture with somebody,

19
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:09,220
what do they always got their head?
Let's put the bolts on.

20
00:01:09,221 --> 00:01:11,950
They could tell I'm drinking. What the
fuck? What the beat down your fuck.

21
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,230
Same thing with coffee.
That society.

22
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,980
Everybody wants to fucking be cool
and drink that and fucking coffee.

23
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:22,510
You ever had someone look at your copy in
the woods at fucking coffee bean? What?

24
00:01:22,511 --> 00:01:25,990
You can afford Starbucks, Bro.
Yo, step up. No Starbucks.

25
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:29,710
Why would you want doughnuts, Bro?
Why would you wait on that line?

26
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,200
Listen to that Brazilian bold.
We'll keep you up to three days.

27
00:01:32,201 --> 00:01:36,080
That's what isis drinks. Don't be
my pocket with the cases. Drinks,

28
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,130
coffee. Fuck. Do they drink fucking

29
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:44,410
you ever drink resilient?
Both on fucking Dunkin donuts.

30
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,130
You can donuts for everybody

31
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:56,550
that pays
me by Alex and anti fungus

32
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:02,850
and get fat fucking bolt and come
back and say that's liquid slugging.

33
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:07,000
Daddy. Fuck you. Don't
let's I agree with Shit.
