00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:04.450
FEMALE SPEAKER: Thank you a
lot for coming to our talk.

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:07.530
It's my pleasure to introduce
today's distinguished guest

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:11.680
speaker, Dr. John Gray, a great
author of the book "Men Are

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.670
from Mars, Women Are Venus,"
the best-selling relationship

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:17.030
book of all years.

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.830
He wrote 18 other books,
and you can read about them

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.320
on his website and his
[INAUDIBLE] publications.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.960
And I won't keep
you longer, and I'll

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.860
let John Gray to
speak for himself

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.530
and share with you
the differences

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:32.770
between the genders.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:33.944
Thank you, John, for coming.

00:00:33.944 --> 00:00:35.610
JOHN GRAY: Thank you
for having me here.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.440
Well, it's really fun
for me to be at Google,

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.610
since I live on Google.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.710
It's a researcher's dream to
be able to Google everything

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:49.360
instantly.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.110
You don't understand
something, Google it.

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.834
Understand something, Google it.

00:00:53.834 --> 00:00:55.500
I remember one of my
mentors a long time

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.440
ago was saying that if, when
you're speaking, if you use one

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.510
word that somebody
can't understand,

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.430
then they tend to blank out
on everything else you say.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.350
And one of the great
things for Google for me

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.109
is I'll be reading
research and this and this,

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:09.983
and if a word comes
along I don't understand,

00:01:09.983 --> 00:01:12.897
I can immediately Google
that and come back.

00:01:12.897 --> 00:01:14.480
Because to truly
understand something,

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.870
you have to actually
understand every word.

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:19.640
But we intuitively think we're
going to get it at the end,

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.220
but we don't.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.130
So in my message on
"Men Are from Mars,

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.590
Women Are from Venus," what's so
much fun for me is, typically,

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.070
people can relate
to the examples

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.352
from your own
personal experience.

00:01:31.352 --> 00:01:33.310
So just to know you a
little bit as my audience

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.464
so I give the right talk, who
has read "Men Are from Mars,

00:01:37.464 --> 00:01:38.380
Women Are from Venus"?

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.060
How many of you read it?

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.755
So a lot of you haven't.

00:01:41.755 --> 00:01:45.180
OK, now, how many of you who
haven't have heard of it?

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.120
So your parents read it, right?

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.800
That was when I knew
I was getting old,

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:50.780
when people would
come up and they'd go,

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.050
oh, I love your book,
and my parents read it.

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.430
They started going
on walks together.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.850
They actually are so
much happier afterwards,

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:00.700
so they thank me.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:01.770
And I said, well,
when you get ready,

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.700
you'll probably want
to read the book, too.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.030
So I'm going to give-- for those
of you haven't read "Men Are

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.449
from Mars"-- some of the basic
ideas of that in our short

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:11.040
presentation, and we'll
also have room for question

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.910
and answers, if you
like to ask questions.

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.270
I'll also briefly talk about
my most recent book, which

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.770
is called "Work with Me,"
which is about 25 books later.

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.020
I've applied the
principles of understanding

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.712
gender differences
in a positive way.

00:02:25.712 --> 00:02:27.670
Because so much of the
time, when men and women

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.010
show up differently
in a relationship,

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.919
we often have an intuitive
reaction, which is wrong.

00:02:33.919 --> 00:02:36.460
How many of you have read the
book called "Slow Thinker, Fast

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:37.840
Thinker"?

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.870
It was a good book,
but it talks about most

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.046
of our interpretation
of reality is automatic,

00:02:43.046 --> 00:02:45.785
kind of like I know that that
building's quite far away,

00:02:45.785 --> 00:02:47.200
and you're closer to me.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.070
And when we're in relationships,
when our partners say or do

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.940
things, we have an
automatic interpretation,

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.970
which is often
wrong, particularly

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.100
when it's the opposite sex.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.670
So a lot of my ideas,
I think the popularity

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.420
of "Men Are from Mars"
was that you really

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.670
don't have to do
anything to change

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.677
your relationship to the better.

00:03:06.677 --> 00:03:08.510
Because so many of the
problems that couples

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.250
have in relationships
is misinterpretation.

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.620
And so if you can start
to interpret a situation

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.140
correctly, you find
out the problem

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.680
is not as big as
you thought it was.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.170
There's an old
Eastern Indian story

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.390
of the person who sees a snake
on the ground, and it's dark,

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.650
and they start yelling and
screaming, snake, snake.

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.870
And somebody turns on the
light, and it's a stick.

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.450
So so many of the problems
I see with my couples

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.400
as a marriage counselor
are big problems to them,

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.630
and then I explain it to
them, and it's a stick,

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.240
and then you can
work with the stick.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.370
So in "Work with Me"--
that's the second book

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:46.750
I'll be briefly talking about.

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.280
That's my most recent
published book.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.220
It talks about gender
differences in the workplace,

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.860
and how are these basic blind
spots between men and women.

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.312
And we teach through
human resources

00:03:58.312 --> 00:03:59.270
in different companies.

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:02.700
We go in, and we do these
workshops sometimes.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.180
And we did a survey of
over 100,000 men and women

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.830
from workshops.

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.770
So they filled out this survey
before they took the course.

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:13.490
And we found that there are
these basic blind spots.

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:15.760
There's eight that I focus
on, but I'll mention one

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.990
right now, which is
we asked the women,

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:22.950
do you feel appreciated
in the workplace?

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.730
And over half of the
women felt they were not

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:28.670
being appreciated by men.

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:31.540
And then we ask the men,
do you appreciate women

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:32.960
in the workplace?

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.610
And over 90% of men
said, of course.

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.230
So that's a blind spot.

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.810
Men think that they're
communicating appreciation,

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.850
but women often not
feeling appreciated.

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.170
And this gives rise to one
of the basic differences

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:51.490
between men and women, which
is that women feel valued

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.150
and appreciated when
you know what they do.

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.120
When a man gets paid, get
acknowledged for the result--

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.660
good job, you did this, now you
get this promotion or whatever.

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.410
That makes a man feel
valued and appreciated.

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.310
Acknowledge what I do.

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.820
But for a woman, she wants to be
acknowledged for what she does,

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:13.380
but she also wants to be seen.

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:14.910
She wants to be heard.

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:17.040
She wants to be understood.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:20.000
And this was my first insight
into the world of "Men Are from

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.680
Mars, Women Are from
Venus"-- what was it--

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.862
over 30 years ago.

00:05:25.862 --> 00:05:28.320
Before I realized it, before
I was even married to my wife.

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.260
We've been married 28 years.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.190
But Helen is my
assistant 30 years ago.

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:35.820
And Helen comes to me and
says she wants to quit.

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:37.730
And I said, why would
you want to quit?

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:38.540
You're the best.

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:39.540
I just gave you a raise.

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.670
You make as much
as me, basically.

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:45.340
And she said, it's
not about the money.

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.300
I just don't feel appreciated.

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:49.287
And I said, all right.

00:05:49.287 --> 00:05:49.870
Well, hold on.

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.180
Why don't you feel appreciated?

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:54.120
Because I thought she
was a gift from heaven.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.360
And she said, well, John, you
don't even know what I do.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.600
And my reaction as
a man was, that's

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.850
why I appreciate you so much.

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:06.250
And we laugh because we
can see the logic of that.

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:06.870
Of course.

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:07.850
I don't have to think.

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:08.800
I don't have to plan.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:09.880
I don't have to do anything.

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:11.070
She made all the arrangements.

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:12.097
She put the money in the bank.

00:06:12.097 --> 00:06:12.930
She paid my bills.

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:14.030
She organized my seminars.

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:16.580
She handled all my clients.

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:19.662
I just showed up at work and
counseled eight women today.

00:06:19.662 --> 00:06:21.870
Which, by the way, when "Men
Are from Mars" came out,

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:24.070
everybody was so upset at me.

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:25.055
Some people still are.

00:06:25.055 --> 00:06:25.930
How do you know this?

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:28.470
I said, well, my
credentials, basically,

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:31.330
as a counselor-- how many
men have sat in a room

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:34.700
and listened to women talk for
eight hours a day for 10 years?

00:06:37.195 --> 00:06:39.320
You have to get paid a lot
of money to do that job.

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:48.380
So I said to her, just
let me-- she said,

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:50.077
you don't even know what I do.

00:06:50.077 --> 00:06:51.410
And so I caught on very quickly.

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:54.450
I said, well, give me
a week, and let's see.

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:56.570
So Helen continued to
work for me for years.

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:58.880
I just celebrated her birthday
with her just recently.

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:03.700
And all I did differently--
and Helen stayed with me

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:05.560
and felt valued
and appreciated--

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:10.590
was I took five extra minutes
a day to find out what she did.

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:15.000
And once I knew what she did,
then she felt part of a team.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.740
Very important for women
to feel part of a team,

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:19.940
not to feel isolated.

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:22.670
Second thing is she
felt seen, and that I

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:26.080
come in and actually
look at her.

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:30.610
If you're a programmer, an
engineer brain, you're a guy,

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:33.420
eye contact is not
so important for you.

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:34.440
But to women, it is.

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:37.130
Watch women talk, they'll
be looking at each other,

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:39.710
whereas guys could be looking
off or looking down or looking

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:41.420
around, sometimes
looking at each other,

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:43.610
but always when there's a point.

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:46.510
If you're talking
social talk with guys,

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:48.820
we have to be looking at a
football game or a computer

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:49.840
screen.

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:52.520
It was just the other
night, I was at a party

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:55.400
with one of my old friends
who was sitting next to me.

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:56.820
And my wife is
sitting over here.

00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:58.236
Actually, it was
Helen's birthday,

00:07:58.236 --> 00:07:59.560
and she's sitting in front.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:02.290
And I'm talking to
Martin, his name is,

00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:04.920
and my wife points out
to me 3/4 of the way

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:07.640
into the evening,
John, you're not

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:10.150
looking at Martin when you talk.

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:13.010
You need to look at him.

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:14.740
I said, OK, honey.

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:15.700
I looked at Martin.

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:19.400
He didn't even notice either.

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:22.480
So what I focus on is
the little differences

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:23.490
between men and women.

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:25.890
It's not like a woman
can't do what a man does.

00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:27.870
It's not that a man can't
do what a woman does.

00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:30.870
And it's not that all men and
all women fit into these slots

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:31.960
so neatly.

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:33.960
Generally, about
10% of men will tend

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:35.990
to relate more the
female examples.

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:39.006
10% of women will relate
more to the male examples.

00:08:39.006 --> 00:08:40.630
Women often come up
to me and say, gee,

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:42.749
I feel like I'm from Mars.

00:08:42.749 --> 00:08:44.290
And I say, well,
that's conditioning,

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:46.180
to a great extent.

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:48.100
Women today are
conditioned to be like men,

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:50.040
and there's no
safety to acknowledge

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:52.240
feminine aspects of who you are.

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.640
And part of my message
is to validate that,

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:57.870
but not to negate if you're
more on your masculine side.

00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:58.530
That's great.

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:01.870
That allows you to
often fit into the work

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:03.189
world much better.

00:09:03.189 --> 00:09:05.230
And women will say to me
after they read my book,

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:07.390
they say, yeah, I feel
like I've become a man

00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:10.910
to become successful, and I'm
very confused when I get home.

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:12.790
It's like I feel split.

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:16.910
So I wrote a book, which is
called "Why Mars and Venus

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:19.520
Collide" before I
wrote this book.

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:22.660
And "Why Mars and
Venus Collide" is--

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:28.180
what's happening today is that
women go into the workplace.

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:31.074
The workplace stimulates
certain hormones.

00:09:31.074 --> 00:09:33.240
Now, that hormone is the
hormone is the hormone that

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.526
gets produced when
you're solving problems

00:09:35.526 --> 00:09:37.525
and particularly when you
have a responsibility,

00:09:37.525 --> 00:09:40.780
and it's all up to you, and
you're solving a problem.

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:42.700
Now, what hormone would that be?

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:45.550
That hormone is
called testosterone.

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:47.050
It's the emergency hormone.

00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:49.080
It's the hormone when
you feel pressured,

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:51.520
when you feel a sense
of got to go fast.

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:52.550
Got to get this done.

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:53.380
It's up to me.

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:55.220
Nobody else is going to do it.

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:58.319
Or you sacrifice because
it's a difficult thing,

00:09:58.319 --> 00:10:00.610
but you say, I can handle
it, because I'm getting paid,

00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:02.210
and that's my job.

00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:03.890
That's the hormone
only gets produced.

00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:05.920
It's testosterone.

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:10.380
Well, the difference between a
woman's body and a man's body

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:12.420
is hormonal.

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:14.790
These are real
physiological differences.

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:19.270
The average male
needs 30 times more

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:22.710
testosterone to
be in a good mood.

00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:25.370
The number one cause
of heart disease in men

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:27.040
is a low testosterone.

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:29.840
There's no man that has
a heart attack unless he

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:33.170
has low testosterone,
high estrogen, estrogen

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:35.310
being the feminine hormone.

00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:38.640
As men get older, they start
thinking, I want to quit.

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:44.830
That's because faulty diet,
lack of exercise, too many

00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:46.760
estrogens in our environment.

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:48.720
What happens is
estrogen levels star

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:53.680
rising, pushing
testosterone levels down.

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:55.770
That is number one
cause of heart disease.

00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:57.420
As soon as the
man retires, which

00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:59.460
means he doesn't have
work, which means,

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:01.010
I have to get up
and do something.

00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:03.310
I have to solve problems.

00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:06.150
A man has one year before
his first heart attack.

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:08.810
This is a statistical fact.

00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:10.030
So a statistical fact.

00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:11.190
Not every man.

00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:12.920
But men need to work.

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:15.230
Men need to go out there
and solve problems,

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:18.650
because solving problems
releases testosterone,

00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:23.630
and testosterone a hormone
that lowers stress for men.

00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:26.580
Does testosterone
lower stress for women?

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:27.920
No.

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:30.810
Does testosterone being
released feel good to women?

00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:31.870
Yes.

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:33.600
It feels good.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:37.040
So women can love
their testosterone job,

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:40.780
but their stress levels
rise and rise and rise.

00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:42.530
And this is shown
in a study that

00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:46.435
was done in Scandinavian
countries of several hundred

00:11:46.435 --> 00:11:48.270
thousand women and
men being tested,

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:50.797
and they found
that-- and this is

00:11:50.797 --> 00:11:52.630
one of the areas where
you have the greatest

00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:55.087
equality between
men and women-- I

00:11:55.087 --> 00:11:57.670
get frustrated when I go there,
because they call it equality.

00:11:57.670 --> 00:11:59.990
I call it blindness.

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:02.220
We're all the same,
which we're not the same.

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:03.960
But at least there's
equal respect

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:05.890
for everybody, which
is a good thing.

00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:07.870
But real equality is
when you can recognize

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:10.600
the differences in the
spirit of equality,

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:13.730
equal opportunity, equal
respect, regardless

00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:18.010
of man, woman, culture,
race, whatever.

00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:20.810
So what they found in this
study in Scandinavia--

00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:25.490
huge four-country study-- is
that women in the workplace,

00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:28.770
their stress levels were
twice as high as men's.

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:34.030
When women came home
from the workplace,

00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:37.190
their stress levels were
four times higher than men.

00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:39.340
These are averages.

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:43.110
And that basically means their
happiness level is dramatically

00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:44.660
declining.

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:47.140
University studies in
America have repeatedly

00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:51.200
shown that, in the '70s, women's
happiness level was way up

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:52.850
here, and men's was down here.

00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:55.070
Men has pretty much
stayed the same,

00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:57.770
and women has
dramatically dropped.

00:12:57.770 --> 00:13:00.740
So what you get, as women
move more into the workplace,

00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:04.240
as an average, their
happiness goes down.

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:06.040
So what's going on there?

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:07.930
When I say this, I'm
not saying, oh, women

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:09.180
shouldn't be in the workplace.

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:10.000
I have three daughters.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.291
They all have jobs and careers.

00:13:11.291 --> 00:13:12.850
I've supported that completely.

00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:14.530
But they're happy.

00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:16.390
Their stress levels are low.

00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:19.310
They're educated to understand--
they have two parts.

00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:21.100
We all have two parts.

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:23.820
The masculine side
is solving problems,

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:25.910
releasing testosterone.

00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:28.025
If you're a man, that
will lower your stress.

00:13:28.025 --> 00:13:30.194
But what lowers
stress for women?

00:13:30.194 --> 00:13:31.610
Well, this was a
huge breakthrough

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:37.980
that happened in 2002 at UCLA.

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:42.650
They discovered that the hormone
oxytocin, which is generally

00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:49.510
associated childbirth and female
orgasm, the hormone oxytocin

00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:51.860
is the hormone that
actually directly lowers

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:53.690
stress for women.

00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:57.790
And without an abundance
of oxytocin in your body,

00:13:57.790 --> 00:14:01.500
your brain does not have
an off switch, which

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:04.040
means when you have
problems, if a woman's upset,

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:07.130
she's upset for days
and days and days.

00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:09.960
She's still thinking about
this, thinking about this.

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:12.990
I was just counseling a couple,
and they were in their 80s.

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:15.370
And they haven't seen
me in about a month,

00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:17.900
and she brings up an issue
that happened six weeks ago

00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:19.430
or a month ago.

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:21.890
He says, I can't believe she's
still thinking about this.

00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:23.400
I said, you don't understand.

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:24.990
Women don't have an off switch.

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:27.504
They keep going around
and around and around.

00:14:27.504 --> 00:14:29.670
Now, how many women in this
room can relate to that?

00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:32.250
You're not on camera, but
you can relate to that?

00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:33.280
I'm getting some nods.

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:34.310
Can I get some arms up?

00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:34.990
Let me just see.

00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:42.380
They've actually put men
and women on computer scans

00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:46.040
when the sun sets, and what
happens for a man and a woman

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:47.570
is very different.

00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:50.490
Unless there's an emergency,
you say to the man and woman,

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:52.600
you say, sit down and relax.

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:54.490
And you put your brain
scans on to measure

00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:56.350
blood flow in the brain.

00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:59.330
And for the woman, as
soon as she sits down,

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:02.180
blood flow increases
to the brain.

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:04.320
Brain activity increases.

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:06.460
You ask her, what
is she thinking?

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:08.640
What is she thinking?

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:10.380
She's thinking
about all the things

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:13.030
she needs to do that
she's not doing it

00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:15.710
while she's sitting
here on this couch.

00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:17.940
That's her brain
going like this.

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:22.540
You look at the man's brain,
blood flow literally stops.

00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:24.580
It just goes back
here to where he

00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:28.170
can keep his body temperature
and breathing and so forth.

00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:29.900
And you ask him, what
are you thinking?

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:31.230
And what does he say?

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:31.730
Nothing.

00:15:34.259 --> 00:15:36.300
And if you didn't have
that test, the woman says,

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:38.030
you must be thinking
of something.

00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:41.310
You must be thinking
of something.

00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:42.450
And this is the difference.

00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:45.110
And so what's going on
there, which I talked about

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:47.800
in "Men Are from Mars" long
before all this research came

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:49.660
about, I just observed it.

00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:52.420
Is that men
typically go to work.

00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:54.170
They're solving
problems all day.

00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:56.470
They're releasing
testosterone, particularly

00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:59.680
if a man is successful, which
means he feels confident,

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:01.980
I know how to solve problems.

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:05.130
So if I get in my car, and
I'm driving 100 miles an hour,

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:08.380
if I feel like I'm in a good
car, and I'm a good driver,

00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:10.190
actually my stress
level goes down.

00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:11.880
How many men can relate to that?

00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:13.000
Of course.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.200
You're doing something which
is extremely dangerous,

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:16.024
by the way.

00:16:16.024 --> 00:16:18.190
Because if you were to let
go of the steering wheel,

00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:19.620
you would die.

00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:21.830
Or if a deer ran out in
front of your car, which

00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:24.330
you have no control
over, you would die.

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:26.200
But your brain,
basically, you're

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:29.230
producing huge amounts of
testosterone, releasing it,

00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:30.160
and dopamine.

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:32.050
Dopamine is the
brain chemical focus,

00:16:32.050 --> 00:16:35.330
so you're going right into focus
zone because there's danger.

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:38.680
So dopamine and testosterone
go hand in hand.

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:40.380
So your stress levels
are going down.

00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:42.660
So quite often, I noticed
that if I got in an argument

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:44.870
with my wife, or something
was stressing me out,

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:47.660
I'd want to go for
a drive in my car.

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:49.800
And I would just drive a
little faster than usual,

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:52.008
so I have to look front and
backwards for the police.

00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:56.401
And I would start to relax.

00:16:56.401 --> 00:16:58.150
Now, of course, if my
wife was in the car,

00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:01.410
that would raise her
stress levels hugely.

00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:04.990
So there's huge differences
here in how we cope with stress.

00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:06.780
That's just one little example.

00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:08.724
But, typically, what
I would see happening,

00:17:08.724 --> 00:17:10.640
what I still see happening,
which a lot of men

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:14.050
don't do now, and this is
part of my message to men,

00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:16.819
is that we would go to work,
and we would solve problems,

00:17:16.819 --> 00:17:20.150
and we'd come home from work,
and we'd forget problems.

00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:21.640
You have to realize,
for thousands

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:24.170
of years, hundreds of
thousands of years--

00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:26.349
I've gone 18 times
around the world,

00:17:26.349 --> 00:17:28.930
been with indigenous
tribes around the world,

00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:31.400
when the sun sets,
the men sit around,

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:34.450
because their job is
in the jungle doing

00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:35.930
what they do when
there's sunshine.

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:37.513
Now they're sitting
around, or they're

00:17:37.513 --> 00:17:40.190
a guard sitting around
doing nothing, as well.

00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:42.480
So they don't move
when the sun sets.

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:44.890
They actually need to relax.

00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:47.770
And when they relax, their
brain, in order to relax,

00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:49.330
their brain literally
has the ability

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:52.240
to forget stressful messages.

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:55.555
So the way men cope with
stress is you solve problems,

00:17:55.555 --> 00:17:59.490
and at the end of the day,
you forget your problems.

00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:00.780
And we have a shut off.

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:02.900
We can turn them off.

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:05.550
And when you turn off
your problems, you relax.

00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:09.640
And when you relax, your
body rebuilds testosterone.

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:11.750
That's how you
rebuild testosterone

00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:14.240
is to do anything a
woman would consider

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:18.022
to be a complete waste of time.

00:18:18.022 --> 00:18:19.230
So he'll come home from work.

00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:21.730
He'll sit around, maybe watch
the news, sit on his computer,

00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:23.627
do something, play a
video game, anything.

00:18:23.627 --> 00:18:25.960
And she's going, but we've
got this, and we've got this,

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:26.560
and we've got this.

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:27.020
And there's this.

00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:27.800
And you forgot this.

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:28.550
You're not doing this.

00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:30.190
And she can't
understand why he's not

00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:32.840
attending to all those things.

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:36.450
But he's doing what he has to
do to cope with stress, which

00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:39.380
is to turn off all
responsibilities

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:41.660
for a little me time.

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:45.486
And she's going, well, why does
he get me time, and I don't?

00:18:45.486 --> 00:18:46.235
Because you can't.

00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:51.500
You should be admiring that.

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:54.079
You should be going, I
wish I could do that.

00:18:54.079 --> 00:18:56.370
And, of course, women, you
do subconsciously admire it.

00:18:56.370 --> 00:18:59.490
This is all the spa magazines,
all the upper level gold

00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:00.870
watch magazines.

00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:03.460
They always show some
beautiful spa resort place,

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:05.520
and a woman is
sitting in meditation.

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:08.970
And she seems to be so
beatifically calm and peaceful.

00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:11.210
You have no idea she's
worrying about 50 things.

00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:14.190
But the illusion is that
she can turn off her brain

00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:15.970
and be completely
happy like that,

00:19:15.970 --> 00:19:17.780
which is an illusion
for women today.

00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:19.160
They can't.

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:23.430
But what this research in
1992 showed is how you can.

00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:25.560
And you can do it.

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:30.570
The hormone that allows
you to relax is oxytocin.

00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:33.970
Oxytocin is stimulated
in a variety of ways.

00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:35.790
I've written whole
books on oxytocin,

00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:37.312
how to simulate it,
how you lose it,

00:19:37.312 --> 00:19:38.520
how you get in, and so forth.

00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:40.770
We'll go a little
bit over it today.

00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:45.820
And with oxytocin, when a
women is giving love-- OK,

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:49.270
if you're nurturing others,
if you're caring about others,

00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:51.780
if you're thinking about others,
if you're helping others--

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:54.730
basically, if you're taking care
of your kids-- because women,

00:19:54.730 --> 00:19:56.415
for thousands and
thousands of years,

00:19:56.415 --> 00:19:57.790
if you go to an
indigenous tribe,

00:19:57.790 --> 00:20:00.180
you'll see the babies are
being born every year.

00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:01.997
Women are just pregnant
most of the time.

00:20:01.997 --> 00:20:03.330
They're taking care of the kids.

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:04.746
When the sun sets,
the men are all

00:20:04.746 --> 00:20:07.270
sitting around doing nothing,
sharpening their tools

00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:10.670
or whatever, telling stories,
or not talking at all.

00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:12.850
Women are completely busy.

00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:16.130
They're nonstop action,
nonstop busy, busy, busy.

00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:19.450
But their stress levels
are dramatically low.

00:20:19.450 --> 00:20:22.250
What is lowering their stress?

00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:23.900
When you feel you're
in an environment

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:26.270
where there's no time pressure.

00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:30.370
The number one inhibitor
of oxytocin production

00:20:30.370 --> 00:20:33.140
is feeling not enough time.

00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:35.280
The number one complaint
I hear from women

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:39.190
today is not enough time.

00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:42.750
There's too much to do, and
there's not enough time.

00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:46.080
And when you feel, as a woman,
there's not enough time for me

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:48.230
to do what I'd like
to do, to do what

00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:51.710
I enjoy doing-- it's a huge,
perplexing thing for men when

00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:54.840
we see women say, I
have no time for me.

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:57.820
He'll take a deep breath and
go, how is that even possible?

00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:01.890
Because if a guy runs out of
time for me, he just takes it.

00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:03.690
But when a woman is
feeling stressed,

00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:06.820
your mechanism to
lower stress is

00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:10.740
to nurture others
and release oxytocin.

00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:13.460
Oxytocin, when you're
giving to other people,

00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:16.630
caring for others, being
concerned for others,

00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:19.660
doing for others-- not
necessarily solving problems--

00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:22.100
being in a social relationship,
listening to someone,

00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:23.250
helping them, whatever.

00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:26.790
It's not so much solving
problems as nurturing.

00:21:26.790 --> 00:21:28.720
See, here's the difference
between nurturing,

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:39.130
which is oxytocin-releasing,
and problem solving

00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:41.140
is testosterone-producing.

00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:42.700
So my wife is a gardener.

00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:44.480
When she's planting
her seeds, when

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:48.100
she's caring for her
seeds, that's nurturing.

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:51.420
When the irrigation
system is broken,

00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:55.760
and water is spurting up,
that's solving a problem.

00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:58.410
So you see how solving a problem
is the illusion that I'll

00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:00.750
solve it, and it's done forever.

00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:02.250
And then, of course,
they come back.

00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:05.210
So men make great
emergency workers.

00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:08.090
A big problem comes,
I'm going to solve it.

00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:10.180
Then you feel like,
ah, now I can rest.

00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:10.750
Relax.

00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:12.160
Forget about that.

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:15.830
But women are designed to
not forget about things.

00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:17.440
This is the big
complaint men have,

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:20.500
is 30 years in-- I'll just
do a funny story here.

00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:22.850
My wife and I were in
the Galapagos Islands.

00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:26.100
You know, the Galapagos
turtles live long lives.

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:28.300
There's a T-shirt
they're selling there,

00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:31.550
it's these two old
turtles talking,

00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:35.210
and the husband's saying to
the female turtle, honey,

00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:39.706
the affair was 97 years ago.

00:22:39.706 --> 00:22:42.900
Can we let it go?

00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:46.790
When she's under stress,
all of her memories come up.

00:22:46.790 --> 00:22:49.370
See, this is how
women cope with stress

00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:52.210
is talking about what's
stressing you out.

00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:53.810
So the memories come up.

00:22:53.810 --> 00:22:56.460
Men cope with stress by
forgetting those things.

00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:57.030
Forget it.

00:22:57.030 --> 00:22:57.750
Forget it.

00:22:57.750 --> 00:23:00.300
So a woman's busy talking
about stressful things,

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:02.370
and a man goes, just forget it.

00:23:02.370 --> 00:23:03.380
Don't worry about it.

00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:04.479
It's not a big deal.

00:23:04.479 --> 00:23:05.770
Just do this and this and this.

00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:07.279
Don't take that exit next time.

00:23:07.279 --> 00:23:09.570
And the worst is the man will
listen to you complaining

00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:12.970
about your job, he'll
say, just quit that job.

00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:14.980
You can get another job.

00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:18.520
As if you're going to say,
gee, I hadn't thought of that.

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:19.700
What a brilliant idea.

00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:20.908
No wonder I'm married to you.

00:23:20.908 --> 00:23:22.570
You're so smart.

00:23:22.570 --> 00:23:26.170
But, see, when a man hears a
problem, he wants to kill it.

00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:28.420
Basically, it's run
from it or kill it.

00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:29.000
Solve it.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:29.930
Fix it.

00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:32.660
Because that releases
testosterone.

00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:34.310
Then he relaxes.

00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:40.570
For a woman, testosterone does
not lower her cortisol levels.

00:23:40.570 --> 00:23:42.180
It doesn't raise them.

00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:44.450
It just doesn't lower them.

00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:50.690
So what lowers stress levels
for women is oxytocin.

00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:51.380
Ah.

00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:53.530
So now when you're in a
personal relationship,

00:23:53.530 --> 00:23:57.570
and you're nurturing others,
you're releasing your oxytocin.

00:23:57.570 --> 00:23:59.620
Your stress levels goes down.

00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:00.910
But guess what?

00:24:00.910 --> 00:24:05.720
Giving doesn't
rebuild your oxytocin.

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:09.700
What rebuilds oxytocin
so you have it to give

00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:12.480
is when you feel you're
receiving support.

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:15.570
So, for women, everything
is about reciprocity.

00:24:15.570 --> 00:24:17.920
It's I give, and I get back.

00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:20.830
I give-- if you're my friend,
I do something for you,

00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:23.940
and now you're obligated
to do something back.

00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:26.920
If we're two girlfriends,
and I call you up,

00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:29.510
with the first thing
I'll do is a woman

00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:31.300
is say, tell me about your kids.

00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:32.250
Or tell me about this.

00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:34.000
It's like I remember
everything about you,

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.190
and I ask lots of
questions, get you talking,

00:24:36.190 --> 00:24:38.290
and now you owe me five
minutes of listening.

00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:43.730
Women can't believe when a
guy will talk about himself

00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:45.870
and then not ask her questions.

00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:47.810
It's like, how can he
just talk about himself?

00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:51.930
And he's over here thinking, why
does she have nothing to say?

00:24:51.930 --> 00:24:54.790
Because women eagerly ask
questions to draw somebody out

00:24:54.790 --> 00:24:58.010
because they so much
value being heard.

00:24:58.010 --> 00:25:00.770
See me, hear me, touch me.

00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:05.180
All of these things
are oxytocin producers.

00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:07.356
So that if you feel
seen and heard,

00:25:07.356 --> 00:25:08.730
and you feel backed
up, if you're

00:25:08.730 --> 00:25:10.860
part of a team-- and
this is women in tribes.

00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:13.540
Women have always
been in tribes.

00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:14.860
You go to indigenous cultures.

00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:17.790
They're doing everything
together, all the time.

00:25:17.790 --> 00:25:20.380
And there's never any
rushing, by the way.

00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:22.260
There's a sense of support.

00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:24.570
It's that you feel that you
have support at all times.

00:25:24.570 --> 00:25:26.660
It's not like you need
that support all the time.

00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:28.760
It's not I like you're
this needy person.

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:31.480
It's just that you
always have backup.

00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:33.590
And so women, because
their instinct is always

00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:36.380
to be giving, because
giving releases oxytocin,

00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:39.370
and you have a rewards
system to make you feel good.

00:25:39.370 --> 00:25:41.410
Women are busy always
giving, but if it's

00:25:41.410 --> 00:25:44.440
all women you're working with,
all day long, everybody's

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:48.305
giving, so
everybody's receiving.

00:25:48.305 --> 00:25:50.430
And suddenly, you take a
women and put them in hand

00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:53.750
with men, who don't
live in that world.

00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:57.630
Or in a corporate environment,
it isn't structured that way.

00:25:57.630 --> 00:26:01.370
See, the whole difference of
Mars world and Venus world,

00:26:01.370 --> 00:26:03.190
we have to blend them together.

00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:04.270
One is not bad.

00:26:04.270 --> 00:26:05.670
One's not better.

00:26:05.670 --> 00:26:08.950
But to make sense of it,
you look at the two worlds.

00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:12.390
In the Mars world,
the strong survive.

00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:15.530
The better you are, the
bigger result you get.

00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:18.090
The harder you work, the smarter
you are, the bigger result.

00:26:18.090 --> 00:26:19.020
You get paid more.

00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:21.350
Gee, he didn't get paid
much, but look what you did.

00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:23.120
You got more.

00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:28.790
At home, in the personal world,
the child who is the sickest

00:26:28.790 --> 00:26:30.640
gets more.

00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:32.030
They get more attention.

00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:33.080
They get more help.

00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:34.270
They get more support.

00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:36.000
And everybody gets
what they need.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.027
It's not what you earn,
it's what you need.

00:26:39.027 --> 00:26:41.110
But you don't go into your
boss and say, you know,

00:26:41.110 --> 00:26:44.320
I really need that job.

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:46.776
Your chances of
getting it go down.

00:26:46.776 --> 00:26:48.150
It's like, I've
earned this role.

00:26:48.150 --> 00:26:48.930
Look what I've done.

00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:50.096
I do this and this and this.

00:26:50.096 --> 00:26:52.600
Therefore, I should
get this reward.

00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:55.150
These are two different
worlds of thinking

00:26:55.150 --> 00:26:58.760
that blend together, and this
is the male female relationship,

00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:02.440
which is a new experiment
on planet Earth.

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:04.230
If you go to any the
indigenous tribes--

00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:06.850
we're talking thousands and
thousands of years of history.

00:27:06.850 --> 00:27:11.880
Go visit in Africa, you'll
see two fires at night.

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:14.750
Women around one,
men around another.

00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:15.590
Go to the Amazon.

00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:18.534
I was just in your
Google Maps area

00:27:18.534 --> 00:27:19.950
where you can see
the whole world,

00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:22.450
and I was going all
these places I've been.

00:27:22.450 --> 00:27:23.552
Go down to the Amazon.

00:27:23.552 --> 00:27:24.260
Go to the Amazon.

00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:27.860
You'll see, at night,
men are sitting around.

00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:29.950
Women are behind a
wall, and they're

00:27:29.950 --> 00:27:33.030
all busy with the children and
cooking and cleaning and making

00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:36.289
alcoholic beverages
to give to the men.

00:27:36.289 --> 00:27:38.080
How do they make those
alcoholic beverages?

00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:39.990
Just little trivia here.

00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:42.370
They chew these roots.

00:27:42.370 --> 00:27:45.000
They masticate them,
chew them, and spit them

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.320
into this bowl with a
little heat under it.

00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:50.600
And if they go for
three or four days,

00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:52.046
it becomes very alcoholic.

00:27:52.046 --> 00:27:53.670
So the men are all
just sitting around.

00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:55.128
The women come out
with their bowls

00:27:55.128 --> 00:27:56.950
occasionally and hand
it to their husbands.

00:27:56.950 --> 00:27:59.240
And there I am with the
chief, so the chief's wife

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:00.350
gave me his bowl.

00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:03.710
It was this big on--
just tasted terrible.

00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:09.680
That chief, by the
way, [INAUDIBLE] chief,

00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:13.370
he was also very proud of
his seven shrunken heads.

00:28:13.370 --> 00:28:14.920
They do exist.

00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:19.660
And through my two translators
asking him, why do you do that?

00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:21.480
He says, oh, very clear.

00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:23.622
I have seven children.

00:28:23.622 --> 00:28:25.410
I said, well,
explain that to me.

00:28:25.410 --> 00:28:27.410
He says, well, the jungle
only has so much food,

00:28:27.410 --> 00:28:31.212
and you can only get so much
from your grocery store.

00:28:31.212 --> 00:28:33.420
And if you're going to bring
a child into this world,

00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:37.200
you have to eliminate somebody
from a neighboring tribe.

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:39.400
Otherwise, there will
be a shortage of food.

00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:42.350
That was their
sustainability program.

00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:45.910
I think we've come a long way.

00:28:45.910 --> 00:28:49.340
It's tribal thinking versus
global consciousness.

00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:50.940
Now we're moving
into the world where

00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:53.810
if I hurt someone out
there, I'm hurting myself.

00:28:53.810 --> 00:28:55.810
And the history of
tribal consciousness

00:28:55.810 --> 00:28:57.310
is I don't care about them.

00:28:57.310 --> 00:28:58.530
I care about my children.

00:28:58.530 --> 00:28:59.730
That's a mafia family.

00:28:59.730 --> 00:29:01.670
Mafia fathers are very
loving to their kids

00:29:01.670 --> 00:29:06.310
as long as they say yes,
but not to anybody else.

00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:08.340
So this, we're trying
to get out to see,

00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:10.520
and that's the experience
of the heart opening.

00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:13.130
And, ultimately, this happens
through this great experiment

00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:15.800
of romance, men and
women coming together

00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:18.020
in romantic relationships.

00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:21.710
You seek out, you find someone
that your heart opens to.

00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:25.200
And can you keep your heart
open to the same person who's

00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:26.674
not perfect?

00:29:26.674 --> 00:29:28.090
Say, for the first
three years, it

00:29:28.090 --> 00:29:32.590
seems as though they're perfect,
and then reality sets in.

00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:36.980
And reality sets in because
when you meet someone new,

00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:39.160
and there's sexual
attraction, your brain

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:42.650
produces massive
amounts of dopamine.

00:29:42.650 --> 00:29:45.492
How many are familiar
with the term dopamine?

00:29:45.492 --> 00:29:47.200
That's when you're
driving your car fast.

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:48.990
That's when you're really
focused on a project.

00:29:48.990 --> 00:29:50.120
That's when you're
getting a reward.

00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:51.570
That's when there's danger.

00:29:51.570 --> 00:29:52.720
That's when there's sex.

00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:58.810
That's when you're doing--
any addictive substances goes

00:29:58.810 --> 00:30:00.990
into the nucleus
accumbens, where dopamine

00:30:00.990 --> 00:30:02.140
produces lots of pleasure.

00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:04.950
So anything that's pleasurable
for you is producing dopamine.

00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:09.680
So in the first
three years, one of

00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:14.010
the major dopamine
simulators is newness.

00:30:14.010 --> 00:30:16.680
Newness stimulates dopamine.

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:19.730
Now, what is the
opposite of newness?

00:30:19.730 --> 00:30:21.470
Not newness.

00:30:21.470 --> 00:30:23.720
And what happens
after three years?

00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:24.620
It's not new.

00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:26.120
And then to make
things worse, when

00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:29.380
you have an argument, what
does she generally do?

00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:31.570
She brings up the past.

00:30:31.570 --> 00:30:33.420
So there's definitely not new.

00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:35.019
It's the worst thing
couples can do.

00:30:35.019 --> 00:30:37.310
And I'm not putting it on
her, because she'll start it,

00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:38.934
but then he'll come
back, and now he'll

00:30:38.934 --> 00:30:41.170
start going into the past, too.

00:30:41.170 --> 00:30:43.540
And now you're both
living in the past.

00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:45.670
As soon as you can't
be in present time,

00:30:45.670 --> 00:30:48.130
dopamine levels start
decreasing, decreasing,

00:30:48.130 --> 00:30:48.730
decreasing.

00:30:48.730 --> 00:30:51.140
All that passion you
felt in the beginning

00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:54.240
dissipates after
three years unless you

00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:56.160
have relationship skills.

00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:58.220
You have to understand
the software.

00:30:58.220 --> 00:30:59.790
With so many of
you into software--

00:30:59.790 --> 00:31:01.980
that's how I got into this
whole relationship thing.

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:03.490
I used to work as
a programmer back

00:31:03.490 --> 00:31:07.480
in the days of Stanford
Research Institute and COBOL.

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:09.070
So I used to program
the computers.

00:31:09.070 --> 00:31:12.160
At a certain point, I realized
I should program people.

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:13.970
So I had that very
analytical perspective

00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:15.803
that men are like this,
women are like this.

00:31:15.803 --> 00:31:17.020
If we do this, then this.

00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:18.580
If we do this, then that.

00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:20.300
And we can see it predictively.

00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:22.801
A man comes home-- he
doesn't know anything

00:31:22.801 --> 00:31:24.300
about men and women
differences-- he

00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:25.010
says, hi, honey.

00:31:25.010 --> 00:31:27.920
And he goes and sits
down and reads a book.

00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:30.010
And she's going, is that it?

00:31:30.010 --> 00:31:31.660
He used to be excited to see me.

00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:34.160
Matter of fact, what she'll do
if they're married in a house

00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:36.360
is he comes home,
she'll test them.

00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:40.000
She'll go to another part
of the house and wonder,

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:40.940
does he even miss me?

00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:42.420
Does he care about me?

00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:44.550
She's playing hide ad seek,
Venusian hide and seek.

00:31:44.550 --> 00:31:47.240
I'm hiding, and you're
supposed to find me.

00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:50.870
So she's going, I could be
dead, and he wouldn't even care.

00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:53.871
And he's from Mars-- he has
his own little hide and seek.

00:31:53.871 --> 00:31:55.620
Men come home-- he
goes, she's not around.

00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:56.119
Good.

00:31:58.690 --> 00:32:02.230
He just wants to be alone, no
interference, nobody calling

00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:03.856
on, nobody asking for anything.

00:32:03.856 --> 00:32:05.230
Just give me a
break for a while.

00:32:05.230 --> 00:32:06.604
So he's playing
hide and go seek,

00:32:06.604 --> 00:32:08.730
but the rules are,
don't find me.

00:32:08.730 --> 00:32:09.910
He doesn't want to be found.

00:32:09.910 --> 00:32:13.040
She wants to be found.

00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:16.840
Men solve problems to feel
better and then forget them.

00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:19.020
The easiest way to solve
a problem is forget it.

00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:19.690
Manana.

00:32:19.690 --> 00:32:20.280
Tomorrow.

00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:21.894
I don't have to
deal with it now.

00:32:21.894 --> 00:32:23.810
And that's what we're
trying to help you with,

00:32:23.810 --> 00:32:25.360
but it doesn't work for her.

00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:27.900
And she'll be
talking about things

00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:29.790
and just blows him
out of the water.

00:32:29.790 --> 00:32:31.360
He goes, oh, my gosh.

00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:33.530
I'll make $1 million on a book.

00:32:33.530 --> 00:32:35.440
We'll be doing a bunch
of fun stuff together.

00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:37.710
I'll come home one
day a week later,

00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:40.810
and I'll leave a glass
out on the counter.

00:32:40.810 --> 00:32:44.780
And she'll lose it
and go, ugh, is it

00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:49.100
that hard to put your
glass this far over to here

00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:50.630
and put in the dishwasher?

00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:52.850
I mean, can't you at
least put it there?

00:32:52.850 --> 00:32:57.135
And I'm like, what is
she, nuts or something?

00:32:57.135 --> 00:32:59.920
We're, like, the luckiest
people in the world.

00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:02.780
We're having an argument over
a glass, which is right here?

00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:04.150
How could she do that?

00:33:04.150 --> 00:33:06.000
But when you understand
her world-- and part

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.700
of the craziness,
from my perspective,

00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:10.100
is two days before,
it was a big bunch

00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:11.850
of all these dishes
were everywhere.

00:33:11.850 --> 00:33:13.142
It was piling up and piling up.

00:33:13.142 --> 00:33:14.683
It was some party
we had, and nothing

00:33:14.683 --> 00:33:16.020
had been done for a couple days.

00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:19.180
So she had spent much
of the day cleaning up.

00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:21.730
So it was completely clear--
so you have to imagine this.

00:33:21.730 --> 00:33:23.396
You've been living
with trash, and women

00:33:23.396 --> 00:33:24.730
see this 10 times more than men.

00:33:24.730 --> 00:33:26.562
They actually have more
cells in their eyes.

00:33:26.562 --> 00:33:27.070
They see it.

00:33:27.070 --> 00:33:27.986
They can't ignore it.

00:33:27.986 --> 00:33:28.610
Guy comes home.

00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:29.570
He sees his TV set.

00:33:29.570 --> 00:33:30.835
That's it.

00:33:30.835 --> 00:33:31.710
Doesn't see anything.

00:33:31.710 --> 00:33:34.310
She sees everything,
and it's hard to relax

00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:37.080
if it's not in order, organized.

00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:37.930
So here it is.

00:33:37.930 --> 00:33:39.260
It's been cleaned up.

00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:41.572
She spent all day
cleaning it up.

00:33:41.572 --> 00:33:43.770
And from her point,
can't there just

00:33:43.770 --> 00:33:47.520
be a moment where it
stays so pretty and nice?

00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:48.836
So it just triggered a button.

00:33:48.836 --> 00:33:50.085
She had an emotional reaction.

00:33:50.085 --> 00:33:52.340
And when women have
emotional reactions, see,

00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:54.450
men think that that
emotional reaction is just

00:33:54.450 --> 00:33:56.230
about the glass.

00:33:56.230 --> 00:33:59.390
But it's never about just the
first thing she talks about.

00:33:59.390 --> 00:34:00.590
That's just the warm up.

00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:04.000
That's the foreplay for the
big story that's about to come.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.420
She's got all kinds of
things that are bothering her

00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:07.690
that have been building up.

00:34:07.690 --> 00:34:10.520
It's like, for women,
it's like the straw that

00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:12.469
breaks the camel's back.

00:34:12.469 --> 00:34:15.350
Women hold this stress up,
this stress up, this stress up.

00:34:15.350 --> 00:34:19.060
And finally something happens,
and it starts to come out.

00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:21.710
And when it comes out, a
guy thinks you're nuts.

00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:24.279
But here's a way to help, ,
again interpret each other

00:34:24.279 --> 00:34:24.779
correctly.

00:34:24.779 --> 00:34:25.780
She's not nuts at all.

00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:27.760
It's just that she
has a greater need

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:30.590
to talk about what's
bothering her.

00:34:30.590 --> 00:34:33.790
Men have a greater need to
forget what's bothering them.

00:34:33.790 --> 00:34:36.070
So our job is to
forget about it.

00:34:36.070 --> 00:34:40.111
Her job is to talk about it.

00:34:40.111 --> 00:34:41.360
So here's a little difference.

00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:44.357
We come into some physiology.

00:34:44.357 --> 00:34:45.940
The emotional part
of the brain called

00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:49.650
the limbic system is twice
as big in a woman than a man.

00:34:49.650 --> 00:34:50.540
Big difference.

00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:52.570
Twice as big.

00:34:52.570 --> 00:34:56.719
Under moderate stress, a woman
will experience eight times

00:34:56.719 --> 00:35:00.190
more blood flow to the
emotional part of the brain.

00:35:00.190 --> 00:35:01.800
Under moderate stress.

00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:06.410
Under extreme stress, a man
will experience that blood flow,

00:35:06.410 --> 00:35:09.160
but the problem has
to be really big.

00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:11.400
Women will experience
an emotional reaction

00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:13.470
to small problems.

00:35:13.470 --> 00:35:16.620
And so a man misinterprets
her emotional reaction

00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:18.980
as if she's saying
the problem is big,

00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:20.689
and she doesn't know
what to do about it.

00:35:20.689 --> 00:35:23.104
So we're constantly seeing
women, when they get emotional,

00:35:23.104 --> 00:35:24.870
it's like, what, she
can't handle that?

00:35:24.870 --> 00:35:26.750
She's not saying, I
can't handle that.

00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:29.210
She's just having an
emotional response to it

00:35:29.210 --> 00:35:31.740
as a way to let go of stress.

00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:34.040
And man's way to
let go stress is

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:37.330
to detach, to separate
from his emotions.

00:35:37.330 --> 00:35:39.700
And you can see
this in brain scans.

00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:41.811
The amygdala in
a man is wired up

00:35:41.811 --> 00:35:44.060
to go right to the part of
the brain-- fight or flight

00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:47.070
is the amygdala-- into
solving the problem.

00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:48.940
You know what Freud
did-- it totally

00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:51.790
different from modern therapy.

00:35:51.790 --> 00:35:55.700
90% of the people who see
modern therapists are women.

00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:56.330
Why?

00:35:56.330 --> 00:35:57.990
It's changed.

00:35:57.990 --> 00:35:59.400
It's eye contact.

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:00.420
It's how do you feel?

00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:01.570
How do you feel?

00:36:01.570 --> 00:36:02.499
What else do you feel?

00:36:02.499 --> 00:36:03.290
What else happened?

00:36:03.290 --> 00:36:04.570
How does that make you feel?

00:36:04.570 --> 00:36:08.260
It's all this personal
nurturing interaction.

00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:09.320
Freud did none of that.

00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:11.170
He had mostly men.

00:36:11.170 --> 00:36:13.580
You go into a dark room
where you had no eye contact.

00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:16.346
You lie down on a couch,
which every man loves to do.

00:36:16.346 --> 00:36:21.700
He'd sit behind you, and all
he would do is take notes.

00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:23.670
He'd ask you questions.

00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:24.880
And you would solve problems.

00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:25.840
Why do you think this?

00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:26.920
And why you think that?

00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:28.360
And why do you think this?

00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:32.552
He could have just been saying,
and what is 23 times 17?

00:36:32.552 --> 00:36:34.510
And you would have to
calculate these problems.

00:36:34.510 --> 00:36:39.720
Just solving problems and
relaxing lowers a man's stress.

00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:41.670
It wasn't some
big, magical thing.

00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:43.640
But for women, it did nothing.

00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:45.270
So, gradually, it
evolved for women.

00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:47.090
And usually it was
just very wealthy men

00:36:47.090 --> 00:36:50.320
they did therapy, because
once you're a man,

00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:53.780
and you have lots of
wealth, you go crazy.

00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:55.280
Why?

00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:57.810
And by crazy, I mean, look
at the "National Enquirer"

00:36:57.810 --> 00:37:00.446
and see all the wealthy
superstar people.

00:37:00.446 --> 00:37:01.195
They get divorced.

00:37:01.195 --> 00:37:02.390
They have battles.

00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:03.324
They take drugs.

00:37:03.324 --> 00:37:04.490
They're going through rehab.

00:37:04.490 --> 00:37:08.700
What's going on is that they
don't have to work anymore.

00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:11.160
These are men who
don't have to work,

00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:14.130
so they get to do
what they like to do.

00:37:14.130 --> 00:37:18.130
When you do what you like to
do, oxytocin gets produced.

00:37:18.130 --> 00:37:21.300
Oxytocin doesn't
lower stress in men.

00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:23.490
Doing anything that
women like to do

00:37:23.490 --> 00:37:26.280
does not lower stress in men.

00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:27.780
That's why in the
beginning, men are

00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:29.472
so happy to do things with you.

00:37:29.472 --> 00:37:31.680
And after a while, they're
ready to sit on the couch.

00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:33.360
And what you'll say
to them things like,

00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:34.965
hey, what would you like to do?

00:37:34.965 --> 00:37:37.340
He'll say, I'd like to just
sit here and have you make me

00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:38.840
dinner.

00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:42.250
Or you might want to go
out to dinner tonight,

00:37:42.250 --> 00:37:44.076
and you say to him,
hey, John, would you

00:37:44.076 --> 00:37:45.450
like to go out to
dinner tonight?

00:37:45.450 --> 00:37:48.190
And what does every woman
interpret that to mean?

00:37:48.190 --> 00:37:50.054
What she's really
saying is, I'd like

00:37:50.054 --> 00:37:51.220
to go out to dinner tonight.

00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:52.520
Wouldn't you like
to go out to dinner?

00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:53.811
Let's go out to dinner tonight.

00:37:53.811 --> 00:37:55.330
But she doesn't say that.

00:37:55.330 --> 00:37:57.440
She says, hey,
John, would you like

00:37:57.440 --> 00:37:59.240
to go out to dinner tonight?

00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:02.310
If he's not initiated into
the Venusian language-- which

00:38:02.310 --> 00:38:04.560
is very convoluted and
changing all the time,

00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:07.026
depending on her
mood-- would you

00:38:07.026 --> 00:38:08.400
like to go out to
dinner tonight?

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:10.270
No, I'd rather just stay home.

00:38:10.270 --> 00:38:12.400
You could make me this dinner.

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:14.330
Because he actually
thinks you're

00:38:14.330 --> 00:38:15.865
asking what he'd like to do.

00:38:21.310 --> 00:38:25.272
The flip side of this is
Friday night comes along.

00:38:25.272 --> 00:38:27.480
And this is where we have
this experiment of romance.

00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:30.090
Marriage is based upon love
and affection and romance,

00:38:30.090 --> 00:38:32.030
which is magnificent.

00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:34.160
I've been married
to my wife 28 years.

00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:39.610
To experience passion with
somebody that you know,

00:38:39.610 --> 00:38:41.522
it's like a
miraculous experience.

00:38:41.522 --> 00:38:43.230
Very few people have
ever experienced it.

00:38:43.230 --> 00:38:45.635
They have to have somebody
new, somebody different.

00:38:45.635 --> 00:38:49.512
To actually experience passion
with somebody you know.

00:38:49.512 --> 00:38:51.220
It was like seven
years into our marriage

00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:54.035
is when I woke up to
how great my life was.

00:38:54.035 --> 00:38:55.680
Not that I wasn't
having a good time,

00:38:55.680 --> 00:39:00.570
but making love with my
wife, it was fireworks.

00:39:00.570 --> 00:39:01.420
It was spectacular.

00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:03.378
It was one of those times
where, afterward, you

00:39:03.378 --> 00:39:05.980
just laugh at how
fantastic it was.

00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:09.010
And I said to her,
wow, that was as good

00:39:09.010 --> 00:39:10.940
as it was in the beginning.

00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:12.940
And she goes, oh,
that was better.

00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:14.580
I said, what do you mean?

00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:16.850
She says, well, in the
beginning, the sex was great,

00:39:16.850 --> 00:39:19.660
but you didn't really know me.

00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:22.250
Now, you've seen the
best of me, and you've

00:39:22.250 --> 00:39:26.470
seen the worst of me, and
you still love and adore me.

00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:28.070
That's real love.

00:39:28.070 --> 00:39:29.981
That's real love.

00:39:29.981 --> 00:39:32.230
In the beginning, its a
glimpse of what it feels like.

00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:33.570
It's the brain
chemicals of love.

00:39:33.570 --> 00:39:35.528
But you don't even know
who you're reacting to.

00:39:35.528 --> 00:39:36.880
It's mostly fantasy.

00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:38.540
In order to keep
your heart open,

00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:42.392
we need to have these advanced
communication insights.

00:39:42.392 --> 00:39:43.350
Because what do you do?

00:39:43.350 --> 00:39:45.570
If a guy needs to
go to his cave--

00:39:45.570 --> 00:39:47.570
one of the big insights
of "Men Are from Mars"--

00:39:47.570 --> 00:39:49.740
now it's pretty much
gone into the culture.

00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:51.110
Man cave.

00:39:51.110 --> 00:39:52.830
He needs his man cave.

00:39:52.830 --> 00:39:58.190
He goes to his man cave, except
men typically don't come out.

00:39:58.190 --> 00:40:00.914
So I teach women how to bring
him out of the man cave.

00:40:00.914 --> 00:40:02.330
He's got to have
that, but he also

00:40:02.330 --> 00:40:04.464
needs a little
incentive to come out.

00:40:04.464 --> 00:40:06.880
If you say to him, what would
you like for dinner tonight,

00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:08.020
or what would you like to do?

00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:09.436
He'll say, just
sit in my man cave

00:40:09.436 --> 00:40:12.400
and continue doing what I'm
doing, as opposed to you

00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:14.490
have to know what you'd
like, what you want,

00:40:14.490 --> 00:40:16.160
learning how to ask for support.

00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:17.640
These are all like new skills.

00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:20.060
Women have never had
to do that in the past.

00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:22.180
And for thousands and
thousands of years

00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:24.570
in indigenous cultures, women
don't ask men for anything.

00:40:24.570 --> 00:40:26.870
They don't even talk to men.

00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:29.550
Men learned a man's
role from his father.

00:40:29.550 --> 00:40:30.970
Women learned to do from mother.

00:40:30.970 --> 00:40:32.160
That was it.

00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:35.660
There's very little
connection and communication.

00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:39.090
So it's learning to take
the time that we need.

00:40:39.090 --> 00:40:41.440
And for men, it's
often alone time,

00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:43.650
and for women, it's
connection time.

00:40:43.650 --> 00:40:46.030
If you want to keep the
connection open with a man,

00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:48.180
and you want to keep
him connected to you,

00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:51.810
your role is to, in a
sense, draw him out.

00:40:51.810 --> 00:40:54.030
And one of the best
metaphors for this

00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:57.540
is when I was going to
places in indigenous India.

00:40:57.540 --> 00:41:00.849
You go to these temples that
are 5,000-year-old temple,

00:41:00.849 --> 00:41:02.390
and you'll see all
around the temple,

00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:05.515
men are sitting in meditation,
not the women at the spa.

00:41:05.515 --> 00:41:07.640
Men are all sitting in
meditation, because they can

00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:09.530
more quickly--
it's not automatic,

00:41:09.530 --> 00:41:12.290
but a man has the ability
to shut the world out,

00:41:12.290 --> 00:41:14.110
and that is the most
powerful way for him

00:41:14.110 --> 00:41:17.410
to rebuild his testosterone
and regenerate his body.

00:41:17.410 --> 00:41:19.607
So men are all
meditating at the temple,

00:41:19.607 --> 00:41:21.940
and women are all dancing
around naked with little bells

00:41:21.940 --> 00:41:23.360
in their waist.

00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:24.280
And their job?

00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:26.490
To get men out of meditation.

00:41:26.490 --> 00:41:28.480
You're supposed to draw
us out of the cave.

00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:32.040
Their whole mythology
is Shiva would meditate

00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:34.580
10,000 years or a million
years or whatever,

00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:37.340
and his wife has to dance
around him until finally they

00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:39.040
make love and create the world.

00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:41.750
But it's the woman
that draws the man out.

00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:45.174
And women today, they don't even
care about drawing the man out.

00:41:45.174 --> 00:41:46.840
They just like going
on with their life,

00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:49.710
and then they misinterpret
he's sitting in his cave.

00:41:49.710 --> 00:41:52.186
What you start to think is,
well, he doesn't love me.

00:41:52.186 --> 00:41:54.880
He didn't used to go
to the cave before.

00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:57.320
And that's because he had the
newness in the relationship

00:41:57.320 --> 00:42:00.090
that would produce huge
amounts of dopamine,

00:42:00.090 --> 00:42:01.860
and then that
produces testosterone,

00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:04.910
so he wasn't needing
to rebuild it as much.

00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:06.620
So now you're in
the relationship.

00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:08.230
He's taking more time away.

00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:10.190
He doesn't have that
same attraction to you

00:42:10.190 --> 00:42:10.830
he had before.

00:42:10.830 --> 00:42:12.100
He's starting to pull away.

00:42:12.100 --> 00:42:13.870
And women go, oh, I
have to get it back.

00:42:13.870 --> 00:42:14.930
I have to get back.

00:42:14.930 --> 00:42:19.542
And you run after him,
and he runs away more.

00:42:19.542 --> 00:42:21.750
That was one of the big
themes in "Men Are from Mars,

00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:26.710
Women Are from Venus" is
men are like rubber bands.

00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:30.890
They want to get close to
you, and then they pull out.

00:42:30.890 --> 00:42:35.080
When they pull out, like a
rubber band, they stretch.

00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:38.230
And when it reaches its length
of how much space do I need,

00:42:38.230 --> 00:42:42.460
then he springs back, and he
falls in love with you again.

00:42:42.460 --> 00:42:45.180
And then he pulls
away-- he misses you--

00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:47.110
and he springs back.

00:42:47.110 --> 00:42:50.740
Now, I'm going to go on
a trip to China next week

00:42:50.740 --> 00:42:52.380
or so for three weeks.

00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:56.280
I haven't been away from my wife
in eight years for three weeks.

00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:59.150
But what I know is I'll
have the best sex of my life

00:42:59.150 --> 00:43:00.791
when I come home.

00:43:00.791 --> 00:43:02.790
That other time I was on
a tour for three weeks,

00:43:02.790 --> 00:43:05.320
and it was the best
sex of my life then.

00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:05.890
Why?

00:43:05.890 --> 00:43:08.070
Because I have pulled back.

00:43:08.070 --> 00:43:10.220
And when I pull back, I
have a chance to miss her.

00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:12.450
I have a chance to
rebuild my focus on her.

00:43:12.450 --> 00:43:15.150
I have a chance for my
testosterone levels to rise.

00:43:15.150 --> 00:43:18.481
And when I come back, it
will just be super stud land.

00:43:18.481 --> 00:43:20.230
I'm really looking
forward to it much more

00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:24.010
than how much I'm getting
paid, which is a lot as well.

00:43:24.010 --> 00:43:26.000
But that is really
an exciting thing.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:29.900
So when men pull away, they
spring back like a rubber band.

00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:35.720
And then once they're in,
the rubber band gets soft.

00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:37.130
It's just a metaphor for sex.

00:43:37.130 --> 00:43:40.110
Imagine a man just
went in and stayed.

00:43:40.110 --> 00:43:42.120
You'd be wanting
to push him away.

00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:42.990
He pulls out.

00:43:42.990 --> 00:43:43.630
He goes in.

00:43:43.630 --> 00:43:44.300
He pulls out.

00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:44.870
He goes in.

00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:47.240
It's that dance of coming
closer, pulling apart.

00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:49.530
And that's his role to
go in and pull back.

00:43:49.530 --> 00:43:51.040
He has the hormones for it.

00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:54.350
Testosterone is the
in and out urge.

00:43:54.350 --> 00:43:56.490
This is testosterone.

00:43:56.490 --> 00:43:58.800
When women don't understand
the hormonal differences

00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:03.520
between men, when he pulls
away, what do you do?

00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:05.510
You run after him.

00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:07.360
And so if you're
running after him,

00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:09.442
does that rubber band
ever get to stretch?

00:44:09.442 --> 00:44:10.650
And how do you run after him?

00:44:10.650 --> 00:44:13.400
I go into all the details
in the books, but you say,

00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:14.900
what's the matter?

00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:16.040
Is there something wrong?

00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:17.900
Or let me do something for you.

00:44:17.900 --> 00:44:19.670
Or let's do this together.

00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:21.330
Or what would you like to do?

00:44:21.330 --> 00:44:23.982
And now you're
concerned about him.

00:44:23.982 --> 00:44:25.440
When he pulls away,
that's when you

00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:28.980
have to come back to being
self-sufficient, self-reliant.

00:44:28.980 --> 00:44:33.400
I have a life, and you're
lucky to be part of it.

00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:35.990
If you can stand in your
place without getting insecure

00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:38.110
and running after
him, that causes

00:44:38.110 --> 00:44:39.560
him to want to come back.

00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:43.670
Because, see, men really
need women to be happier.

00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:47.010
We can only get to a
certain level of happiness.

00:44:47.010 --> 00:44:49.840
Then we have to be able to
make a woman happy to take us

00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:51.440
to a higher level.

00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:53.240
The illusion we
all have as men--

00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:55.380
we get caught in this
trap-- is that we

00:44:55.380 --> 00:44:57.180
think we can make her happy.

00:44:57.180 --> 00:44:59.880
You can't make a woman happy.

00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:03.240
You can only make
a woman happier.

00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:05.990
You're not responsible
for her happiness.

00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:07.820
Because in the beginning,
all that newness

00:45:07.820 --> 00:45:09.530
stimulates huge
amounts of dopamine,

00:45:09.530 --> 00:45:12.600
just like winning the
lottery, just like superhero.

00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:14.860
That's why they
call heroin, heroin.

00:45:14.860 --> 00:45:17.230
You get to be a hero and
sit down and do nothing.

00:45:17.230 --> 00:45:18.890
It makes you feel like a hero.

00:45:18.890 --> 00:45:22.170
A woman makes you feel like a
hero, makes you feel fantastic.

00:45:22.170 --> 00:45:23.980
Look what I did.

00:45:23.980 --> 00:45:25.000
She's so happy.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:26.560
The problem is,
when you take credit

00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:28.740
for all of her happiness,
when she's not happy,

00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:30.330
look what you feel.

00:45:30.330 --> 00:45:31.650
You feel like you've failed.

00:45:31.650 --> 00:45:32.830
You shut down.

00:45:32.830 --> 00:45:34.110
You get bent out of shape.

00:45:34.110 --> 00:45:35.220
You get pouty.

00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:37.486
You get feminine.

00:45:37.486 --> 00:45:39.100
See, what people
don't understand

00:45:39.100 --> 00:45:40.840
is this feminization
of men is when

00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:44.240
men become all
negative emotions.

00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:45.640
If you're in your
masculine side,

00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:50.590
you have healthy testosterone,
you don't get afraid.

00:45:50.590 --> 00:45:52.080
You don't get angry.

00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:54.740
You don't cry unless the
problem is really big,

00:45:54.740 --> 00:45:58.270
and there's nothing you can do
about it, like grieving a loss.

00:45:58.270 --> 00:46:02.270
There's places for feelings
but not in arguments.

00:46:02.270 --> 00:46:04.970
Men used to be taught
this stuff, how

00:46:04.970 --> 00:46:07.340
to endure pain without
talking about it.

00:46:07.340 --> 00:46:10.190
In initiation for
an American Indian,

00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:12.010
they'd stick sticks
through the breast

00:46:12.010 --> 00:46:14.500
in front of the whole
village at 13 years old.

00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:17.680
They'd tie ropes to it
and slowly raise you.

00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:20.876
Throw the rope over a limb,
slowly raise you in the air,

00:46:20.876 --> 00:46:23.430
and you hang there
the whole day.

00:46:23.430 --> 00:46:25.990
And you're not
allowed to cry out.

00:46:25.990 --> 00:46:27.930
You have to learn to
deal with that pain.

00:46:27.930 --> 00:46:30.560
You have to contain
it inside yourself.

00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:32.600
And now do we need
these initiations today?

00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:33.100
No.

00:46:33.100 --> 00:46:34.810
We have a more
advanced initiation.

00:46:34.810 --> 00:46:37.240
Try listening to your wife
without saying anything

00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:39.230
for 10 minutes.

00:46:39.230 --> 00:46:41.580
Without reacting back.

00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:43.000
See, you have to
learn as men how

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.120
to contain the
female side of you

00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:47.790
inside and not become
a female and start

00:46:47.790 --> 00:46:50.140
whining and complaining back.

00:46:50.140 --> 00:46:51.980
This destroys marriages.

00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:53.720
A woman will complain.

00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:55.080
A man has 10 more back.

00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:56.140
He says, I can beat that.

00:46:56.140 --> 00:46:56.639
I'm a man.

00:46:56.639 --> 00:46:57.630
I got testosterone.

00:46:57.630 --> 00:46:59.160
I can do more.

00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:01.240
And now you get this little
tit for tat argument.

00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:02.380
Nobody's taught men today.

00:47:02.380 --> 00:47:03.130
You don't do that.

00:47:03.130 --> 00:47:04.670
That's not what men do.

00:47:04.670 --> 00:47:06.710
What women need most
is to feel heard,

00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:09.060
and then a magic trick happens.

00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:12.180
She feels better, and
nothing has changed.

00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:13.420
This is like a revelation.

00:47:13.420 --> 00:47:15.780
I have women coming into
my office so unhappy,

00:47:15.780 --> 00:47:17.364
and when they leave,
they're so happy.

00:47:17.364 --> 00:47:18.780
And after a while,
I point out, do

00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:20.800
you realize that you come
to my office unhappy,

00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:24.206
and you leave happy,
and nothing has changed?

00:47:24.206 --> 00:47:25.580
Nothing has changed
in your life.

00:47:25.580 --> 00:47:28.780
It's all inside ourselves
how we look at the world.

00:47:28.780 --> 00:47:31.750
As a couple, men can learn
how to support a woman.

00:47:31.750 --> 00:47:34.710
Women can learn how to
receive that support.

00:47:34.710 --> 00:47:36.860
That's the whole new
dance, is women learning,

00:47:36.860 --> 00:47:39.790
how do I motivate him to
give me the support I need?

00:47:39.790 --> 00:47:42.420
Because he wants to do it,
but it's very hard to start.

00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:45.420
When he goes to his
cave, you misinterpret,

00:47:45.420 --> 00:47:47.770
thinking, he must not love me.

00:47:47.770 --> 00:47:49.460
So how can you go
and ask for support

00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:51.350
to somebody you think
doesn't love you?

00:47:51.350 --> 00:47:53.270
Or ask for help
around the house?

00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:54.810
Women need way more help.

00:47:54.810 --> 00:47:55.640
How can you ask?

00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:57.320
You look at him with
eyes of resentment.

00:47:57.320 --> 00:47:58.111
Aren't you helping?

00:47:58.111 --> 00:47:59.065
Aren't you joining in?

00:47:59.065 --> 00:48:00.695
Why aren't you helping me?

00:48:00.695 --> 00:48:02.120
Well, he needs a
job description,

00:48:02.120 --> 00:48:04.570
and he needs to be paid.

00:48:04.570 --> 00:48:06.271
Paid is your happiness.

00:48:06.271 --> 00:48:08.020
So let's say you need
him to do something.

00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:09.060
Would you move that box?

00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:11.070
And it's the third
time you've asked him.

00:48:11.070 --> 00:48:13.070
He moves the box,
and you glare at him,

00:48:13.070 --> 00:48:14.720
like, finally you did it.

00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:16.950
As opposed to, oh,
you moved the box.

00:48:16.950 --> 00:48:21.230
Then, next, you're training
him to do little things

00:48:21.230 --> 00:48:22.060
to make you happy.

00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:24.540
Because in a man's
mind, big things

00:48:24.540 --> 00:48:27.170
make you happy,
not little things.

00:48:27.170 --> 00:48:27.960
He's dating you.

00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:29.240
He's only doing little stuff.

00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:31.780
And he figures if little
stuff makes you happy,

00:48:31.780 --> 00:48:34.410
wait until I do the big
stuff like commitment,

00:48:34.410 --> 00:48:37.430
and marriage, or
sharing my income.

00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:38.810
That's the big stuff.

00:48:38.810 --> 00:48:41.170
Then I don't need to
do the little stuff.

00:48:41.170 --> 00:48:42.810
But it's the little
stuff that actually

00:48:42.810 --> 00:48:44.850
generates the oxytocin.

00:48:44.850 --> 00:48:47.520
So if I give one
rose to a woman,

00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:50.020
she gets a surge of oxytocin.

00:48:50.020 --> 00:48:53.430
If I give her 24 roses, in
my mind, that's at least 24

00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:55.031
surges, right?

00:48:55.031 --> 00:48:55.530
No.

00:48:55.530 --> 00:48:57.170
It's just the same surge.

00:48:57.170 --> 00:48:59.910
So think of it in
terms of points.

00:48:59.910 --> 00:49:02.890
In a man's mind, I'm giving
her 24 roses, 36 roses.

00:49:02.890 --> 00:49:03.950
That 36 points.

00:49:03.950 --> 00:49:06.910
That should last
me half the year.

00:49:06.910 --> 00:49:08.360
It's one point.

00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:10.490
And why are roses so
symbolic of romance?

00:49:10.490 --> 00:49:12.446
Because they die in a week.

00:49:12.446 --> 00:49:13.695
You have to keep nurturing it.

00:49:13.695 --> 00:49:16.400
You have to keep nurturing it.

00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:18.050
So once men
understand this stuff,

00:49:18.050 --> 00:49:19.400
women are not so complicated.

00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:21.300
It's easier to make
the relationship work.

00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:23.020
But it is an art.

00:49:23.020 --> 00:49:26.030
It is like learning
a new program.

00:49:26.030 --> 00:49:26.940
It's a new system.

00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:29.660
And once you learn the new
system, it's really easy.

00:49:29.660 --> 00:49:31.360
But when you turn
over to a new system,

00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:32.660
it's really hard for a while.

00:49:32.660 --> 00:49:34.240
That's what we're going
through right now.

00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:36.230
So we have about 10 minutes
for questions and answers.

00:49:36.230 --> 00:49:37.313
I see one right over here.

00:49:37.313 --> 00:49:38.150
Go right ahead.

00:49:38.150 --> 00:49:39.497
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:49:39.497 --> 00:49:40.080
JOHN GRAY: OK.

00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:42.800
So you'd like to know how women
sabotage communication at work?

00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:44.560
Because that is probably
one of the things

00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:48.529
that I write about
in "Work with Me."

00:49:48.529 --> 00:49:50.320
I have 10 minutes to
talk, so I'll give you

00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:53.910
one way women sabotage
communication at work

00:49:53.910 --> 00:49:59.410
is they simply use the phrase,
Bob, could you do this for me?

00:49:59.410 --> 00:50:03.550
And Bob will say, sure,
and then forget to do it.

00:50:03.550 --> 00:50:05.680
And you'll think,
how could he forget?

00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:09.440
And this is something you
experiment with this week.

00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:11.080
Instead of using,
could you do this?

00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:11.900
Can you do this?

00:50:11.900 --> 00:50:15.560
Say, Bob, would
you do this for me?

00:50:15.560 --> 00:50:17.330
And you'll see he will
remember to do it.

00:50:17.330 --> 00:50:18.380
It's linguistics.

00:50:18.380 --> 00:50:22.094
If you say would, a man
feels he's making a promise.

00:50:22.094 --> 00:50:23.260
If you say, could you do it?

00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:24.100
Yeah, I could do it.

00:50:24.100 --> 00:50:26.266
It doesn't even go into the
front part of his brain.

00:50:26.266 --> 00:50:28.820
It literally doesn't go there.

00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:33.080
The next one, another way is not
giving enough feedback to a man

00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:34.770
that you value him.

00:50:34.770 --> 00:50:38.270
Because women just assume that
if you're interacting with him,

00:50:38.270 --> 00:50:39.330
he must feel valued.

00:50:39.330 --> 00:50:41.960
So one of the ways a woman
can communicate value to man,

00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:44.020
that you value
him-- three phrases.

00:50:44.020 --> 00:50:45.880
You start doing this
this week, you'll

00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:48.429
see a huge difference in
the men you work with.

00:50:48.429 --> 00:50:48.970
He's talking.

00:50:48.970 --> 00:50:52.570
When he pauses, say,
that makes sense.

00:50:52.570 --> 00:50:55.320
And just brighten up,
like, that makes sense.

00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:55.820
You'll see.

00:50:55.820 --> 00:50:56.880
He'll take a double take.

00:50:56.880 --> 00:50:57.730
What did I say?

00:50:57.730 --> 00:50:59.230
Somebody acknowledged
I make sense.

00:50:59.230 --> 00:51:00.390
That makes sense.

00:51:00.390 --> 00:51:04.300
Another one is, with a little
female enthusiasm, good idea.

00:51:04.300 --> 00:51:06.250
You'll see his
mood will changed.

00:51:06.250 --> 00:51:09.040
And at least a couple times
a week, go, brilliant.

00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:10.350
He says, yes, yes.

00:51:10.350 --> 00:51:12.910
What else can I do for you?

00:51:12.910 --> 00:51:15.360
Now, I know the flip side of
this-- how do men sabotage?

00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:17.130
Well, I'll do a
couple on men, which

00:51:17.130 --> 00:51:19.650
is how men could sabotage
relationships in the workplace.

00:51:19.650 --> 00:51:22.130
Same thing at home, which
is, ask more questions.

00:51:22.130 --> 00:51:24.750
Whenever you think you're ready
to give a solution or a point

00:51:24.750 --> 00:51:26.790
of view, ask another question.

00:51:26.790 --> 00:51:29.980
If you show interest in
a woman's point of view,

00:51:29.980 --> 00:51:32.110
you start building
a bond of trust,

00:51:32.110 --> 00:51:33.910
as opposed to just
being interested

00:51:33.910 --> 00:51:35.410
in solving the problem.

00:51:35.410 --> 00:51:38.070
Men are just interested
in solving the problem.

00:51:38.070 --> 00:51:40.280
But if you can just
ask another question,

00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:43.720
it take your interest
into her point of view

00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:45.870
if a man can ask
that extra question.

00:51:45.870 --> 00:51:48.420
Here is the next one, as a
male manager, particularly,

00:51:48.420 --> 00:51:50.230
but working on a
team with women.

00:51:50.230 --> 00:51:53.520
When there's a problem, and a
woman's presenting the problem,

00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:56.670
don't immediately give what
you think is the answer.

00:51:56.670 --> 00:52:00.110
Instead, pause, and
say to her, and what

00:52:00.110 --> 00:52:02.490
do you think we
should do about this?

00:52:02.490 --> 00:52:04.310
And listen to her answer.

00:52:04.310 --> 00:52:06.150
Because so much of
the time, men just--

00:52:06.150 --> 00:52:08.810
if you talk about a
problem, men jump in there

00:52:08.810 --> 00:52:10.720
with 30 times more
testosterone, which

00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:12.020
gives you faster reaction time.

00:52:12.020 --> 00:52:13.330
I got the answer!

00:52:13.330 --> 00:52:14.870
I'll solve that problem.

00:52:14.870 --> 00:52:17.410
And he doesn't realize that
you have the answer, too.

00:52:17.410 --> 00:52:20.220
So you're sabotaging
your success

00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:22.290
by not letting him know
you have an answer-- that

00:52:22.290 --> 00:52:24.850
would be another topic on
how women sabotage-- but men

00:52:24.850 --> 00:52:28.470
sabotage building trust
and a sense of cooperation

00:52:28.470 --> 00:52:31.430
when they're working with women
by jumping in with solutions,

00:52:31.430 --> 00:52:34.100
rather than asking a
few questions first.

00:52:34.100 --> 00:52:36.720
But, for men, it's like
playing basketball.

00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:39.194
I want to grab the ball
and dunk it myself.

00:52:39.194 --> 00:52:40.610
Women are all, on
a certain level,

00:52:40.610 --> 00:52:42.710
let's all take turns, and
let's all take credit together.

00:52:42.710 --> 00:52:43.360
We're a team.

00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:45.000
We did it all ourselves.

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:47.160
And a man's over
here, but I did this.

00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:48.260
Anyway, a lot on that.

00:52:48.260 --> 00:52:50.032
That's from the
book "Work with Me."

00:52:50.032 --> 00:52:51.490
Well, I'm asking
the question where

00:52:51.490 --> 00:52:54.300
you hear I mentioned I
had a study of 100,000 men

00:52:54.300 --> 00:52:56.530
and women that we
took their evidence

00:52:56.530 --> 00:53:00.570
right from the book, which is
another one of the blind spots

00:53:00.570 --> 00:53:03.324
was the number one
complaint women have--

00:53:03.324 --> 00:53:05.740
we asked this question, it
just happened to be the highest

00:53:05.740 --> 00:53:11.160
one-- is, do you experience
that men listen to you?

00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:15.500
And over 70% of women
said men don't listen.

00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:20.050
They asked the men, do
men listen to women?

00:53:20.050 --> 00:53:24.940
And 90% of the men
said, of course.

00:53:24.940 --> 00:53:28.450
So in his world, he's
listening, but in her world,

00:53:28.450 --> 00:53:29.880
she doesn't feel heard.

00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:30.770
That's a gap.

00:53:30.770 --> 00:53:33.062
And, yes, we've done
the research on that.

00:53:33.062 --> 00:53:34.520
I did that book
just because people

00:53:34.520 --> 00:53:35.800
would say what you just said.

00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:37.960
Well, where's your
research on this?

00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:40.290
I probably talked to more
people about relationships

00:53:40.290 --> 00:53:43.090
than anybody in history,
than the whole planet

00:53:43.090 --> 00:53:44.500
history of the world.

00:53:44.500 --> 00:53:46.750
That's all I do
is talk to people

00:53:46.750 --> 00:53:48.920
about relationship experiences.

00:53:48.920 --> 00:53:51.680
Not in a scientific study
with 18 men and women,

00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:55.150
with thousands of people, with
50 people, again and again

00:53:55.150 --> 00:53:55.710
and again.

00:53:55.710 --> 00:53:57.580
And what I see is these themes.

00:53:57.580 --> 00:53:59.160
But I wrote that
book just so people

00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:02.750
who like to look at the digits
could actually see the digits

00:54:02.750 --> 00:54:05.715
and how many women truly see the
world through different eyes.

00:54:05.715 --> 00:54:07.710
But I appreciate the comment.

00:54:07.710 --> 00:54:10.720
It's a force that
we have to overcome,

00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:13.760
because there's a
huge force which

00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:17.040
wants to say we should
all be the same.

00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:18.600
We should all think the same.

00:54:18.600 --> 00:54:20.020
We should all react the same.

00:54:20.020 --> 00:54:22.657
And if we can all
just become one,

00:54:22.657 --> 00:54:24.240
then the world will
be a better place.

00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:26.410
It will be fairer for people.

00:54:26.410 --> 00:54:28.210
It'll be fairer for people.

00:54:28.210 --> 00:54:31.230
We'll be able to
appreciate our differences,

00:54:31.230 --> 00:54:33.150
appreciate our
different strengths,

00:54:33.150 --> 00:54:35.840
and create room for
people to be different.

00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:39.270
That is what will make
this world a better place.

00:54:39.270 --> 00:54:41.880
Yeah, women have a lot more
adrenaline going on than men.

00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:44.770
What happens with
adrenaline is adrenaline

00:54:44.770 --> 00:54:46.484
is produced from dopamine.

00:54:46.484 --> 00:54:48.400
So I'll give you an
example you can relate to.

00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:51.300
As a man, you're driving a
car around 80 miles an hour,

00:54:51.300 --> 00:54:53.270
you feel very relaxed, right?

00:54:53.270 --> 00:54:54.242
Easy going.

00:54:54.242 --> 00:54:56.700
And then you hit it up-- there's
a certain point between 80

00:54:56.700 --> 00:55:00.800
and 120 where most men will
start to feel the adrenaline.

00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:01.630
It's like, rrrr.

00:55:01.630 --> 00:55:04.200
There's like this
rrrr energy inside.

00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:07.670
That's the shifting of dopamine,
which you're confident,

00:55:07.670 --> 00:55:09.490
you're capable, you're online.

00:55:09.490 --> 00:55:10.290
That's dopamine.

00:55:10.290 --> 00:55:12.410
Lots of testosterone
being produced.

00:55:12.410 --> 00:55:15.110
Now your concerns
start to increase.

00:55:15.110 --> 00:55:18.370
That a dropping of your
serotonin, your optimism.

00:55:18.370 --> 00:55:20.370
You're starting to think
of what could go wrong.

00:55:20.370 --> 00:55:22.120
That's serotonin dropping.

00:55:22.120 --> 00:55:24.870
So when your serotonin
levels start to drop,

00:55:24.870 --> 00:55:27.660
your dopamine converts
into adrenaline.

00:55:27.660 --> 00:55:31.490
And adrenaline gives you even
more ability to react fast,

00:55:31.490 --> 00:55:34.310
so you get spikes in
testosterone at that point,

00:55:34.310 --> 00:55:35.810
maybe 10 times more.

00:55:35.810 --> 00:55:38.190
But then you
deplete, so then you

00:55:38.190 --> 00:55:41.107
need more recovery
time afterwards.

00:55:41.107 --> 00:55:43.440
And this is all about how
much adrenaline gets produced.

00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:46.030
For women, your
vulnerability in your brain

00:55:46.030 --> 00:55:48.200
is that because your limbic
system is so much more

00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:50.510
active than men's,
you tend to run out

00:55:50.510 --> 00:55:52.550
of serotonin much
faster than men.

00:55:52.550 --> 00:55:54.460
This is why women
have depression

00:55:54.460 --> 00:55:57.150
four times more than men.

00:55:57.150 --> 00:56:00.590
They run out of serotonin
faster under moderate stress

00:56:00.590 --> 00:56:02.080
as opposed to men.

00:56:02.080 --> 00:56:04.050
Canadian research
shows that men actually

00:56:04.050 --> 00:56:06.760
make serotonin 50%
more efficiently.

00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:08.700
That's because we
have more muscle mass.

00:56:08.700 --> 00:56:13.490
Men store 50% more of residue
serotonin, which is probably

00:56:13.490 --> 00:56:15.911
an evolutionary development,
because you're in danger.

00:56:15.911 --> 00:56:17.410
Your life is in
danger, and you have

00:56:17.410 --> 00:56:19.220
to stay cool,
calm, and collected

00:56:19.220 --> 00:56:22.730
to prevent your dopamine from
converting into adrenaline.

00:56:22.730 --> 00:56:25.410
But adrenaline, particularly,
once you feel adrenalin,

00:56:25.410 --> 00:56:28.490
as a man, you really need to
physically move your body.

00:56:28.490 --> 00:56:30.520
If you don't burn
the adrenalin off

00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:34.410
through physical movement of
the muscles, then what occurs

00:56:34.410 --> 00:56:36.790
is cortisol levels
will start to rise.

00:56:36.790 --> 00:56:39.360
And cortisol levels don't
go away very quickly.

00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:41.040
Adrenaline can
burn off like that.

00:56:41.040 --> 00:56:44.570
But once your cortisol levels
rise, it's sort of a slow rise,

00:56:44.570 --> 00:56:45.759
and it stays in there.

00:56:45.759 --> 00:56:47.300
It's the worst thing
for your health.

00:56:47.300 --> 00:56:50.690
Cortisol inhibits digestion,
inhibits your immune system,

00:56:50.690 --> 00:56:54.310
inhibits your detoxification
system, causes brain injury.

00:56:54.310 --> 00:56:56.260
All those things
are directly related

00:56:56.260 --> 00:56:58.870
to chronically elevated
cortisol levels.

00:56:58.870 --> 00:57:02.050
And this is the world that's
happening for women today.

00:57:02.050 --> 00:57:04.460
So women's health issues
are dropping down.

00:57:04.460 --> 00:57:06.690
More women have heart
attacks than men today.

00:57:06.690 --> 00:57:09.080
And this can all
be remedied-- not

00:57:09.080 --> 00:57:11.760
by saying women should be home.

00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:14.830
It's by saying women should have
a balanced personal life where

00:57:14.830 --> 00:57:16.730
they schedule their
lives so that they're

00:57:16.730 --> 00:57:20.150
doing their testosterone
stimulating activities balanced

00:57:20.150 --> 00:57:26.180
by personal, fulfilling, home
experiences in a personal life

00:57:26.180 --> 00:57:27.830
to balance the work life.

00:57:27.830 --> 00:57:30.440
And it's understanding
all those dynamics

00:57:30.440 --> 00:57:33.030
of what creates
oxytocin in your body

00:57:33.030 --> 00:57:36.170
because our world has become
way too testosterone oriented.

00:57:36.170 --> 00:57:41.480
And ultimately, for men, love is
very important to men, as well.

00:57:41.480 --> 00:57:43.770
And if he comes home, and
a woman can't be loving,

00:57:43.770 --> 00:57:45.990
then you get a man who
doesn't come out of his cave.

00:57:45.990 --> 00:57:49.630
So there's a huge
balance and upset.

00:57:49.630 --> 00:57:52.587
So many of the problems
we experience today

00:57:52.587 --> 00:57:54.920
with all of the mass shootings
and all that stuff that's

00:57:54.920 --> 00:57:55.419
going on.

00:57:55.419 --> 00:57:57.470
We see the kids going
and shooting people.

00:57:57.470 --> 00:57:59.940
These kids are always
on antidepressants

00:57:59.940 --> 00:58:01.561
or antipsychotics.

00:58:01.561 --> 00:58:02.560
They're always on drugs.

00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:05.390
Since we started using
drugs for mental illness,

00:58:05.390 --> 00:58:09.120
there's now, since 1980, 35
times more mental illness

00:58:09.120 --> 00:58:10.360
in America.

00:58:10.360 --> 00:58:12.340
35 times more.

00:58:12.340 --> 00:58:16.170
People, once they start taking
medications, don't go off.

00:58:16.170 --> 00:58:17.780
They do not heal the brain.

00:58:17.780 --> 00:58:20.500
They change the brain, and
the brain-- the problem

00:58:20.500 --> 00:58:21.580
goes worse and worse.

00:58:21.580 --> 00:58:26.210
That whole story is written
in my most recent book, which

00:58:26.210 --> 00:58:28.600
you can all get a
free-- for right now--

00:58:28.600 --> 00:58:31.900
free pre-publication
copy, just doing

00:58:31.900 --> 00:58:33.570
a free download
at marsvenus.com.

00:58:33.570 --> 00:58:38.670
It's called the "Mars Venus
Wellness Solution for Focus,"

00:58:38.670 --> 00:58:40.950
So focus is-- the
challenge for our children

00:58:40.950 --> 00:58:46.480
today is one out of five
boys with ADHD being drugged.

00:58:46.480 --> 00:58:48.120
And what parents
don't realize is

00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:51.950
ADHD drugs cause stunted
growth for young children.

00:58:51.950 --> 00:58:53.089
They cause heart disease.

00:58:53.089 --> 00:58:54.880
Some of them are against
the law in Canada,

00:58:54.880 --> 00:58:56.790
because actually you get
heart attacks from it.

00:58:56.790 --> 00:58:58.331
But long before
heart attacks, you're

00:58:58.331 --> 00:58:59.960
getting arteriosclerosis.

00:58:59.960 --> 00:59:01.770
It also causes
brain changes that

00:59:01.770 --> 00:59:04.960
don't disappear as teenagers
but just turn into addictions

00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:08.510
to caffeine, addictions
to internet porn,

00:59:08.510 --> 00:59:11.750
and the inability to commit
to a long-term relationship.

00:59:11.750 --> 00:59:16.100
These are all the more adult
stages of ADD and ADHD.

00:59:16.100 --> 00:59:18.880
And in the new book, I
map at every stage of life

00:59:18.880 --> 00:59:21.050
how, when we get
ADHD as children,

00:59:21.050 --> 00:59:22.940
and what causes
it-- which they all

00:59:22.940 --> 00:59:24.920
say we don't know-- we do know.

00:59:24.920 --> 00:59:26.600
It's all there in
all the literature.

00:59:26.600 --> 00:59:29.020
I just quote PubMed again
and again, all the causes

00:59:29.020 --> 00:59:32.230
of ADHD, the rampant
imbalance today.

00:59:32.230 --> 00:59:34.860
And as we move through
stages of life,

00:59:34.860 --> 00:59:37.570
people don't recognize
as your brain develops,

00:59:37.570 --> 00:59:39.950
ADHD turns into something else.

00:59:39.950 --> 00:59:42.350
One of the consistent
ingredients that goes along

00:59:42.350 --> 00:59:46.860
with ADHD in an autistic
child, Asperger's child,

00:59:46.860 --> 00:59:51.400
ADHD child is dramatically low
glutathione levels in the body.

00:59:51.400 --> 00:59:53.660
Glutathione protects the
brain from brain energy

00:59:53.660 --> 00:59:55.810
or free radical damage.

00:59:55.810 --> 01:00:00.210
In all those cases, dramatically
low glutathione levels.

01:00:00.210 --> 01:00:03.310
Every person who has dementia
and Alzheimer's-- it is now

01:00:03.310 --> 01:00:05.670
predicted that one out of
three people over 70 will have

01:00:05.670 --> 01:00:07.100
dementia and Alzheimer's.

01:00:07.100 --> 01:00:09.170
My younger sister
has Alzheimer's.

01:00:09.170 --> 01:00:11.850
My older brother has
dementia and early stages

01:00:11.850 --> 01:00:12.860
of Alzheimer's.

01:00:12.860 --> 01:00:16.730
This is becoming another
rampant epidemic in America.

01:00:16.730 --> 01:00:17.932
The cause is so clear.

01:00:17.932 --> 01:00:19.640
They keep saying we
don't know the cause.

01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:22.200
Go right to the
physiology, and you'll

01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:24.360
find that-- I can't go
into all the causes.

01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:27.180
That's a whole other book--
but I talk about the causes.

01:00:27.180 --> 01:00:30.250
I talk about the remedies,
natural remedies.

01:00:30.250 --> 01:00:32.470
But natural remedies
don't work if you

01:00:32.470 --> 01:00:34.436
don't eliminate the causes.

01:00:34.436 --> 01:00:36.060
Say you have a
headache, and I actually

01:00:36.060 --> 01:00:38.650
have a natural pill that will
take away your headache-- which

01:00:38.650 --> 01:00:40.470
I don't, by the way--
but if I had a pill

01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:42.870
to give you to take
away your headache,

01:00:42.870 --> 01:00:45.870
but you keep hitting yourself
in the head with a hammer,

01:00:45.870 --> 01:00:47.350
will that pill work?

01:00:47.350 --> 01:00:47.854
No.

01:00:47.854 --> 01:00:49.520
But for people that
don't hit themselves

01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:52.150
in the head with a
hammer, it will work.

01:00:52.150 --> 01:00:57.260
Well, there are 10,000 studies
on natural solutions for ADD

01:00:57.260 --> 01:00:58.890
and ADHD all over the place.

01:00:58.890 --> 01:01:00.540
They just don't
work all the time,

01:01:00.540 --> 01:01:03.070
as drugs don't work,
because people don't know,

01:01:03.070 --> 01:01:06.770
how am I creating this every
day by my lifestyle choices

01:01:06.770 --> 01:01:07.720
and decisions?

01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:10.840
So, anyway, more on that
subject is at marsvenus.com.

01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:14.299
Just get a free
download of the book.

01:01:14.299 --> 01:01:15.090
For now, it's free.

01:01:15.090 --> 01:01:16.210
Soon it will be on Amazon.

01:01:16.210 --> 01:01:19.510
You can order it and buy
it, but it's an easy read.

01:01:19.510 --> 01:01:24.050
And, particularly, as a techie,
for some techie guys here--

01:01:24.050 --> 01:01:26.862
because they don't realize that
they have huge amounts of ADD,

01:01:26.862 --> 01:01:28.820
because they think, I
have no problem focusing.

01:01:28.820 --> 01:01:31.620
I can focus on my
computer for 10 hours.

01:01:31.620 --> 01:01:34.830
And I remember talking to one
of the world's experts on ADHD,

01:01:34.830 --> 01:01:37.656
and I looked at him, and I
said, you know, you have ADHD.

01:01:37.656 --> 01:01:38.780
He said, that's ridiculous.

01:01:38.780 --> 01:01:40.090
I have total focus.

01:01:40.090 --> 01:01:42.150
I'm so focused, my
wife can talk to me,

01:01:42.150 --> 01:01:43.900
and I don't hear a
word she says while I'm

01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:45.530
thinking about something.

01:01:45.530 --> 01:01:47.260
That's also ADHD.

01:01:47.260 --> 01:01:49.160
That's a problem
with attention where

01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:51.280
you can't shift
your attention here,

01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:53.690
but you become overly
focused on one thing.

01:01:53.690 --> 01:01:55.280
And I'll finished
my talk by talking

01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:58.560
about how ADD is creating
huge problems in relationships

01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:02.450
today, is that it causes
men to become hyperfocused

01:02:02.450 --> 01:02:03.700
on one thing.

01:02:03.700 --> 01:02:05.990
In the beginning, they can
be hyperfocused on her,

01:02:05.990 --> 01:02:07.690
but once the newness
goes away, he

01:02:07.690 --> 01:02:10.100
becomes hyperfocused
on his work,

01:02:10.100 --> 01:02:14.290
and he doesn't take the time
to rebuild his testosterone.

01:02:14.290 --> 01:02:17.450
The average for a man at 50 has
half the testosterone levels

01:02:17.450 --> 01:02:18.820
he had as a younger man.

01:02:18.820 --> 01:02:21.240
I have 25% more.

01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:22.671
And I know exactly how I did it.

01:02:22.671 --> 01:02:25.170
I explain it in my books, so
I'll live a long, healthy life.

01:02:25.170 --> 01:02:27.100
This is why men die, is
their testosterone levels

01:02:27.100 --> 01:02:27.780
start dropping.

01:02:27.780 --> 01:02:29.180
Dopamine levels drop.

01:02:29.180 --> 01:02:32.540
But, anyway, focus-- for men,
they become hyperfocused.

01:02:32.540 --> 01:02:35.980
And for women, they become
hyperfocused on the things that

01:02:35.980 --> 01:02:39.170
would, theoretically, release
oxytocin-- other people's

01:02:39.170 --> 01:02:39.990
needs.

01:02:39.990 --> 01:02:41.810
So they're overwhelmed.

01:02:41.810 --> 01:02:46.350
So overwhelm, the adult symptom
of ADHD, is so common in women,

01:02:46.350 --> 01:02:47.840
it's unbelievable.

01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:49.330
It's like, I have
no time for me.

01:02:49.330 --> 01:02:50.770
I have to do this
for this person.

01:02:50.770 --> 01:02:52.070
Who says?

01:02:52.070 --> 01:02:54.960
It's your brain taking
on more than you can do.

01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:56.470
This is ADHD.

01:02:56.470 --> 01:02:58.250
And it can be corrected.

01:02:58.250 --> 01:03:00.610
These are simple solutions
for all these things.

01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:02.340
I have people writing
it to me, it's

01:03:02.340 --> 01:03:04.560
like, my child is now
taking your vitamin C

01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:06.665
and grapeseed extract
that you recommended,

01:03:06.665 --> 01:03:07.665
and he suddenly changed.

01:03:07.665 --> 01:03:10.289
And he says, Daddy, I like this
so much more than the medicine.

01:03:10.289 --> 01:03:11.810
This makes me feel so good.

01:03:11.810 --> 01:03:14.260
Just simple anti-inflammatories
for the brain

01:03:14.260 --> 01:03:17.410
rather than taking a drug
that does not cure anything,

01:03:17.410 --> 01:03:19.670
nor do they claim
to cure anything.

01:03:19.670 --> 01:03:23.100
It only creates more of the
same problem that caused ADHD

01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:26.780
in the first place, very
similar to any drug addiction.

01:03:26.780 --> 01:03:28.960
Anyway, you've been a great
audience here at Google.

01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:32.290
Thanks for inviting me,
and thanks for the great

01:03:32.290 --> 01:03:33.490
work that you do.

01:03:33.490 --> 01:03:35.340
Appreciate it.
