00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.220
The N64 upside down looks like a koala's face.

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.460
And here's a wall that changes color
when you pee on it.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.060
Vsauce. Kevin here.
This is Mind Blow.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.199
This jet pack of sorts just set a
record by flying for seven straight

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.250
minutes.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.660
The company claims their current model
can carry a 250-pound man for half an

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:22.189
hour

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:26.740
at a max speed of 60 miles per hour.
But if you prefer to sit down while you

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.000
travel, try out his motorized

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.960
easy chair.
It's just a prototype, so you can't buy it.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.860
Or this monster.
It's a 1000 watt subwoofer chair

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.730
with two 16-inch subwoofers and it can
connect the iPods

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.899
or gaming consoles.
Apparently some people like to sit on recycled

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:46.000
computer parts

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.610
with Ethernet and ribbon woven seats encased frame.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.020
And others like to sit on... wow.
The flexible

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.239
love seat incorporates an accordion
like honeycomb structure

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.629
made from recycled paper and wood.
It's kind of like a slinky for your

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.890
butt.
Get ready for summer with the Nerf

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.390
Thunderstorm. It's a battery-powered
super soakers, so you don't need to pump it

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.860
and it has interchangeable clips of water.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.590
You could stay inside all summer
and just build a giant Lego wall.

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.720
You'll need 270,000 legos

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.090
and probably a bodyguard with a Lego ARC gun from

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.869
District 9.
Or stay inside for thirty years and build

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:29.369
a toothpick sculpture of San Francisco.
There are

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.280
eight paths for ping pong balls to
travel along as they tore this incredibly

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.869
intricate creation.
Quick challenge.

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:39.090
Listen to this music box and see if you
recognize the song.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:55.520
Time's up.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.080
Here's the mega answer.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.759
This is a prototype of a screen that
follows your

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:11.550
eye movements. By using a webcam with face
tracking software,

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.480
the idea is to make games like
first-person shooters seem even more

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.760
immersive.
And to make kissing less immersive,

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.090
here's a kissing transmission device.
Basically you make out with his strong

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.099
looking thing

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:27.440
and it transmits the data to affect the
other straw looking

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.060
thing and...
Guy getting struck by lightning.

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.360
A Russian figure skating couple won
a silver medal

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.730
thanks to their plumber-themed routine.

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.910
Finally here's an absolutely epic record-setting

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.610
Beatmania performance.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.020
I'm gonna leave you with a riddle.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.810
"Only one color but not one size

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.840
Stuck at the bottom yet easily flies

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.060
Present in sun but not in rain

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.980
Doing no harm and feeling no pain

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.300
What is it?"

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.100
The genius of the week is going to be a number

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:23.340
scavenger hunt.

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.350
Here's how it works.
I've given 5 clues,

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.980
each clue leads to a number.
Three clues are on this page.

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.870
One clue is at Facebook.com/VsauceGaming.

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.180
And the final clue is in 'Weirdos of the
Month #2.'

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.960
Find all five clues, add up all the
numbers and give us your answer.

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.459
Leave it in the comments below and I'll
give you a hint for the clue in 'Weirdoes #2.'

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:51.480
Eurovision.
Good luck.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.820
And as always, thanks for watching.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.900
Vsauce.

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:59.650
Announcement time. First things first, we've
got a brand new video on Vsauce2

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.700
that's a little bit different.
It's a conversation with myself in a group

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:03.050
called

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:06.120
'Underbelly' where they share with me some creepy

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.640
Pokemon facts.
They're really knowledgeable, I think you'll enjoy it.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.190
Speaking of you, it's about time you got rewarded

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.820
more. And so, over the next few months,
Vsauce is going to be expanding genius of

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:18.340
the week

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.169
to include more slots.
On our channel page right now we've got two.

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:26.560
One is the Genius of the Week that Kevin already
mentioned, but the second one is a brand

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.870
new title called

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.870
'Sauciest of the Week.'
This is for someone who suggested something really

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:32.970
cool to Vsauce.

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.760
Whether it was a private message or on
Facebook, whether it was an online game or

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:37.169
a cool

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:39.969
image or something to buy, or just a hilarious comment.

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:43.400
Now, for the first week I chose 'sofusser,'

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.780
because of all the cool things he made with
stuff that we recommended on DONG.

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.500
But here's the excellent part.
Each week the current winner

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:55.260
picks next week's winner. So, 'sofusser,' if you're out there watching and you see

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.660
something over the next week that was
suggested to us or someone put something

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.040
on Facebook you think is cool,

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.740
let us know. Send us a YouTube message and
let us know who you think should be the

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:04.669
next week's winner.

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:08.770
And then that winner will pick the week after
that. So every winner gets to pass

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.530
the crown.
It should be pretty fun to see what happens.

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:12.550
And, hey guys,

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:13.650
as always,

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:14.670
thanks for watching.
