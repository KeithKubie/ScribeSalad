00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.310
- [Instructor] What we are
going to do in this video

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.320
is talk a little bit about lipids.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:06.610
Now, a lot of times,

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:10.800
lipids are strongly associated with fats,

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.730
and that's not incorrect.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:14.230
Fats are lipids,

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.680
but not all lipids are fats.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.140
A better definition or
a better association

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.700
for lipids would be a class of molecules

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.260
that you often see in biological
systems that are not so

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.180
water

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:30.190
soluble.

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:32.270
And I didn't say outright hydrophobic,

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.890
which means not attracted to water,

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.490
because there are definitely lipids

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:38.240
that have parts that are hydrophobic,

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.690
that are trying to get
away from the water.

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.850
But there is other parts
that are hydrophilic,

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:43.850
that like the water,

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.800
that would be attracted
to water molecules.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.100
Now, in terms of roles
they play in the body,

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.210
and we can think of fat molecules here,

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.380
well, they definitely play a role

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.590
in terms of energy

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:58.540
storage.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:00.630
Whenever I look at my belly,

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.830
I just like to think of all that energy

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.670
that is there covering my six-pack.

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.580
They could be involved in signaling.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.250
In future videos, we're
going to study hormones,

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.390
and hormones are nothing but molecules

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.820
that help transmit a signal
from one part of the body

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.670
to another part of the body.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.400
And many of these hormones are lipids.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.440
They're also involved in membranes.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.470
So a lot of the time in biology,

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.840
we're gonna talk about cellular membranes

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.850
and how they're formed
with these phospholipids.

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.120
And we'll see these
phospholipids, in particular,

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.630
have one end that's trying
to get away from the water

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.020
and another end that is
attracted to the water.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.140
And that's actually what
makes them good for membranes.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.040
Just going back to fats,
let's actually take a look

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.040
at what some of these
lipid molecules look like.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:59.010
So this right over here is
an example of a fat molecule,

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.000
but the general structure
you're going to have is

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.340
these three fatty acids.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.750
So that's one right over there,

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.330
one fatty acid,

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.960
two fatty acids,

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.540
and three fatty acids

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.490
that are connected to a glycerol.

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.360
And don't worry too much
about the words here.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.860
You'll study them more when you get

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.660
to an organic chemistry class.

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.360
But that's where this word
triglyceride comes from,

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.410
tri- for your three fatty acids

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.950
and -glyceride from a glycerol.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.950
And triglyceride is, in
fact, another word for fat.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.180
And what makes a triglyceride
not so soluble in water?

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.410
Look at these long hydrocarbon
chains where you just

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.940
essentially have a bunch
of carbons and hydrogens.

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.570
Those parts, remember, things
that are soluble in water,

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.310
they tend to be polar molecules,

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.360
things that have a partial
charge on one end or another

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.780
or even a full charge.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.090
But when we look at
these hydrocarbon chains,

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.660
they tend to not have
these partial charges on

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.770
one side or another,

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.120
and so that doesn't make
them so soluble in water.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.420
And another word that you sometimes hear

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.030
associated with fats,
saturated or unsaturated fat.

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.700
That's really referring to what's going on

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.470
on these hydrocarbon chains.

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:18.900
If the carbons are as bonded

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.970
to as many hydrogens as they can,

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.810
well, then you're talking
about a saturated fat.

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.700
It's saturated with hydrogens.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.000
If it's not bounded, if it,
in theory, it could bond

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.120
to more hydrogens because it
has some double bonds in there,

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.640
well, then it's unsaturated.

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.260
Maybe in a future video, we'll
talk about the health issues

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.980
of saturated versus unsaturated fat.

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.760
Sometimes in popular
culture, fat gets a bad name

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.450
because everyone's trying
to get their six-packs

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.860
or whatever else, but it's
very important to realize that

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.100
without fats you would die.

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.990
Many vitamins, which are
not so soluble in water,

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:53.170
making them, in fact, lipids,

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.810
need fat in order to be
absorbed into the body properly.

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.240
But as I also mentioned,
all lipids are not fats.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.820
Here are more examples of lipids,

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.150
and I'm not gonna go into detail

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.980
into their molecular structure.

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.120
But you see something similar here.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.500
They all have long chains of hydrocarbons

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.210
that aren't so soluble in water.

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:19.910
These parts right over
here would be hydrophobic,

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:21.680
hydrophobic.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.680
But what's interesting, especially
about this sphingomyelin,

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.150
which is involved in your
myelin sheath in the brain,

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.670
it helps electrically insulate neurons,

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.160
it's also involved in membranes,

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.040
it makes up a substantial part

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.850
of the phospholipids in membranes,

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.320
is that this sphingomyelin right over here

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.230
has a part that actually is hydrophilic.

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:42.810
And as we'll see later on,

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.717
that's what makes things,
molecules like this,

00:04:45.717 --> 00:04:48.530
phospholipids, this is
a sphingophospholipid,

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.770
makes them good for membrane structures.

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.230
Because the part that's
attracted to the water

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:54.490
could be on the outside,

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.740
and the part that's not
attracted to the water

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.010
could be on the inside.

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.210
And so you can form these membranes

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:03.040
that a cross-section of which
would look something like this

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.950
where the circular parts
are the part that want,

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:08.570
the parts that want to
be around the water,

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:10.850
while these tails right over here,

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:12.630
these are the hydrophobic chains

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:14.360
that want to go away from the water.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.320
And this is, in fact,

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.610
what cellular membranes actually look like

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.670
if you were zoom really,
really, really far in.

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:22.090
I'll leave you there.

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:26.730
Between lipids, carbohydrates,
proteins, nucleic acids,

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:29.870
we've really covered
the major macromolecules

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:32.140
that you will see in biological systems.

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.230
Once again, what makes
them macromolecules?

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:36.610
Well, they can be composed

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:39.510
of many, many, many, many, many atoms.

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:41.870
They aren't small molecules.
