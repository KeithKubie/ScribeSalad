00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:02.128
- [Voiceover] Let's now tackle part C.

00:00:02.128 --> 00:00:04.736
So they tell us block 3 of mass m sub 3,

00:00:04.736 --> 00:00:06.030
so that's right over here, is added

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:07.805
to the system as shown below.

00:00:07.805 --> 00:00:11.522
There is no friction between
block 3 and the table.

00:00:11.522 --> 00:00:14.087
Alright, indicate whether the magnitude

00:00:14.087 --> 00:00:15.946
of the acceleration of block 2

00:00:15.946 --> 00:00:18.407
is now larger, smaller, or the same

00:00:18.407 --> 00:00:20.926
as in the original two-block system.

00:00:20.926 --> 00:00:23.992
Explain how you arrived at your answer.

00:00:23.992 --> 00:00:25.980
So let's just think
about the intuition here.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.827
If you think about the net forces

00:00:27.827 --> 00:00:31.817
on the system itself, they're the same

00:00:31.817 --> 00:00:34.927
as we had before, now the internal forces

00:00:34.927 --> 00:00:36.321
are going to be different, you're actually

00:00:36.321 --> 00:00:38.190
going to have two different tensions now,

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.059
now that you have two different strings

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:42.477
but the net forces, the ones that are

00:00:42.477 --> 00:00:46.074
causing this thing to accelerate

00:00:46.074 --> 00:00:48.534
in the upward direction
on the left-hand side

00:00:48.534 --> 00:00:51.545
to the right on the top and then downwards

00:00:51.545 --> 00:00:54.151
on the right-hand side,
it's still this though

00:00:54.151 --> 00:00:56.505
the difference in the weights between

00:00:56.505 --> 00:00:59.813
the two blocks but now
that difference in those,

00:00:59.813 --> 00:01:01.771
inbetween the weights of the two blocks

00:01:01.771 --> 00:01:06.115
is moving more mass and we know that force

00:01:06.115 --> 00:01:08.855
is equal to mass times acceleration

00:01:08.855 --> 00:01:10.899
or acceleration is equal to force

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:15.136
divided by mass and our
force, our net force

00:01:15.136 --> 00:01:18.098
is being, is the differential
between the weights

00:01:18.098 --> 00:01:19.571
or the difference between the weights

00:01:19.571 --> 00:01:21.687
of the block but now we're going

00:01:21.687 --> 00:01:23.980
to be moving more aggregate mass,

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:28.194
this is going to be m1 plus m2 plus m3

00:01:28.194 --> 00:01:31.911
and so you're going to have
a smaller acceleration.

00:01:31.911 --> 00:01:36.911
And so what you could
write is acceleration,

00:01:36.913 --> 00:01:40.453
acceleration smaller

00:01:43.013 --> 00:01:48.006
because same difference,

00:01:50.866 --> 00:01:54.131
difference in weights,

00:01:54.131 --> 00:01:56.721
in weights,

00:01:56.721 --> 00:01:59.511
between m1 and m2

00:01:59.511 --> 00:02:03.199
is now accelerating more mass,

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:09.449
accelerating more mass.

00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:13.985
And that's the intuitive
explanation for it

00:02:13.985 --> 00:02:15.819
and if you wanted to
dig a little bit deeper

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:17.340
you could actually set up free-body

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.799
diagrams for all of these blocks over here

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:23.587
and you would come to
that same conclusion.

00:02:23.587 --> 00:02:27.221
So let's just do that, just
to feel good about ourselves.

00:02:27.221 --> 00:02:30.348
So what are, on mass 1

00:02:30.348 --> 00:02:32.665
what are going to be the forces?

00:02:32.665 --> 00:02:37.018
Well you're going to have
the force of gravity,

00:02:37.018 --> 00:02:40.583
which is m1g, then you're going to have

00:02:40.583 --> 00:02:44.565
the upward tension pulling upwards

00:02:44.565 --> 00:02:47.027
and it's going to be larger
than the force of gravity,

00:02:47.027 --> 00:02:48.966
we'll do that in a different color,

00:02:48.966 --> 00:02:52.969
so you're going to have, whoops,

00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:55.131
let me do it, alright so you're going

00:02:55.131 --> 00:02:58.230
to have this tension, let's call that T1,

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.387
you're now going to have
two different tensions here

00:03:00.387 --> 00:03:01.703
because you have two different strings.

00:03:01.703 --> 00:03:04.791
Now the tension there is T1, the tension

00:03:04.791 --> 00:03:07.253
over here is also going to be T1

00:03:07.253 --> 00:03:11.003
so I'm going to do the same magnitude, T1.

00:03:11.003 --> 00:03:12.767
Now since block 2 is a larger weight

00:03:12.767 --> 00:03:15.601
than block 1 because it has a larger mass,

00:03:15.601 --> 00:03:17.248
we know that the whole system is going

00:03:17.248 --> 00:03:21.012
to accelerate, is going to accelerate

00:03:21.012 --> 00:03:22.713
on the right-hand side it's
going to accelerate down,

00:03:22.713 --> 00:03:24.400
on the left-hand side it's
going to accelerate up

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.036
and on top it's going to
accelerate to the right.

00:03:27.036 --> 00:03:29.961
And so if the top is
accelerating to the right

00:03:29.961 --> 00:03:31.720
then the tension in this second string

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.628
is going to be larger than the
tension in the first string

00:03:34.628 --> 00:03:37.830
so we do that in another color.

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:43.963
I'm having trouble drawing straight lines,

00:03:43.963 --> 00:03:48.026
alright so that we could call T2,

00:03:48.026 --> 00:03:52.231
and if that is T2 then

00:03:52.231 --> 00:03:55.711
the tension through,

00:03:55.711 --> 00:03:58.988
so then this is going to be T2 as well

00:03:58.988 --> 00:04:00.647
because the tension through, the magnitude

00:04:00.647 --> 00:04:02.167
of the tension through the entire string

00:04:02.167 --> 00:04:04.443
is going to be the same, and then finally

00:04:04.443 --> 00:04:07.903
we have the weight of the block,

00:04:07.903 --> 00:04:11.049
we have the weight of block 2,

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:13.701
which is going to be
larger than this tension

00:04:13.701 --> 00:04:16.123
so that is m2g.

00:04:16.123 --> 00:04:17.991
Now I've just drawn all
of the forces that are

00:04:17.991 --> 00:04:20.967
relevant to the magnitude
of the acceleration.

00:04:20.967 --> 00:04:22.487
If I wanted to make a complete

00:04:22.487 --> 00:04:24.658
I guess you could say free-body diagram

00:04:24.658 --> 00:04:29.658
where I'm focusing on m1, m3 and m2,

00:04:29.882 --> 00:04:32.540
there are some more forces acting on m3.

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.072
M3 in the vertical direction,

00:04:35.072 --> 00:04:39.624
you have its weight,
which we could call m3g

00:04:39.624 --> 00:04:42.502
but it's not accelerating downwards

00:04:42.502 --> 00:04:45.068
because the table is exerting force

00:04:45.068 --> 00:04:47.962
on it on an upwards, it's exerting

00:04:47.962 --> 00:04:50.641
an upwards force on it so

00:04:50.641 --> 00:04:54.124
of the same magnitude
offsetting its weight.

00:04:54.124 --> 00:04:56.399
So that's if you wanted to do a more

00:04:56.399 --> 00:04:58.478
complete free-body diagram for it

00:04:58.478 --> 00:05:00.475
but we care about the things that are

00:05:00.475 --> 00:05:02.355
moving in the direction of the accleration

00:05:02.355 --> 00:05:04.840
depending on where we are on the table

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.114
and so we can just use Newton's second law

00:05:08.114 --> 00:05:10.924
like we've used before,
saying the net forces

00:05:10.924 --> 00:05:13.664
in a given direction are equal to the mass

00:05:13.664 --> 00:05:15.537
times the magnitude of the accleration

00:05:15.537 --> 00:05:16.879
in that given direction, so the magnitude

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:18.069
on that force is equal to mass

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:20.110
times the magnitude of the acceleration.

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.522
And so we can do that first with block 1,

00:05:22.522 --> 00:05:23.776
so block 1, actually I'm just going to

00:05:23.776 --> 00:05:25.745
do this with specific, so block 1

00:05:25.745 --> 00:05:27.703
I'll do it with this orange color.

00:05:27.703 --> 00:05:30.339
So block 1, what's the net forces?

00:05:30.339 --> 00:05:35.339
Well it is T1 minus m1g,

00:05:35.444 --> 00:05:37.522
that's going to be equal
to mass times acceleration

00:05:37.522 --> 00:05:41.697
so it's going to be m1
times the acceleration.

00:05:41.697 --> 00:05:43.977
Now what about block 3?

00:05:43.977 --> 00:05:48.242
Well block 3 we're
accelerating to the right,

00:05:48.242 --> 00:05:50.641
we're going to have T2,

00:05:50.641 --> 00:05:52.708
we're going to do that
in a different color,

00:05:52.708 --> 00:05:56.673
block 3 we are going to have

00:05:56.673 --> 00:06:00.252
T2 minus T1,

00:06:00.252 --> 00:06:04.082
minus T1 is equal to m

00:06:04.082 --> 00:06:06.650
is equal to m3 and the magnitude

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:08.846
of the acceleration is
going to be the same.

00:06:08.846 --> 00:06:10.564
Here we're accelerating to the right,

00:06:10.564 --> 00:06:11.864
here we're accelerating up,

00:06:11.864 --> 00:06:12.770
here we're accelerating down,

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:14.244
but the magnitudes are
going to be the same,

00:06:14.244 --> 00:06:18.029
they're all, I can denote
them with this lower-case a.

00:06:18.029 --> 00:06:21.301
And then finally we can
think about block 3.

00:06:21.301 --> 00:06:24.194
We could say that the net forces,

00:06:24.194 --> 00:06:28.516
well that's m2g minus T2,

00:06:28.516 --> 00:06:31.218
that's going against m2g,

00:06:31.218 --> 00:06:36.125
is equal to m2 times its acceleration

00:06:37.005 --> 00:06:39.647
and now if we want to
solve for acceleration,

00:06:39.647 --> 00:06:41.040
and this will be quite convenient,

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.339
we can just add up all
of the left-hand sides

00:06:43.339 --> 00:06:45.019
to get a new left-hand side, and add up

00:06:45.019 --> 00:06:46.880
all the right-hand sides to
get a new right-hand side,

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.916
we can do that algebraically
because they're all

00:06:48.916 --> 00:06:50.317
this is equal to that,
that is equal to that,

00:06:50.317 --> 00:06:51.605
that is equal to that so if you add up

00:06:51.605 --> 00:06:53.776
these and then you add up those,

00:06:53.776 --> 00:06:56.807
well then the sums are going
to be equal to each other.

00:06:56.807 --> 00:06:58.862
And so what are you going to get?

00:06:58.862 --> 00:07:02.960
So if you add up all of this,

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.956
this T1 is going to cancel out
with the subtracting the T1,

00:07:05.956 --> 00:07:09.662
this T2 is going to cancel out
with the subtracting the T2,

00:07:09.662 --> 00:07:12.938
and you're just going
to be left with an m2g,

00:07:12.938 --> 00:07:16.278
m2g minus m1g,

00:07:16.278 --> 00:07:20.848
minus m1g, m2g minus m1g

00:07:20.848 --> 00:07:23.668
is equal to and just for,

00:07:23.668 --> 00:07:24.557
well let me just write it out

00:07:24.557 --> 00:07:27.691
is equal to m1a plus

00:07:27.691 --> 00:07:31.511
m3a plus m2a.

00:07:31.511 --> 00:07:33.982
Well we could of course factor the a out

00:07:33.982 --> 00:07:35.674
and so let me just write this as

00:07:35.674 --> 00:07:40.674
that's equal to a times m1 plus m2

00:07:40.785 --> 00:07:43.345
plus m3, and then we could divide

00:07:43.345 --> 00:07:46.865
both sides by m1 plus m2 plus m3.

00:07:46.865 --> 00:07:48.477
So let's just do that.

00:07:48.477 --> 00:07:53.477
So m1 plus m2 plus m3,

00:07:53.545 --> 00:07:57.982
m1 plus m2 plus m3,

00:07:57.982 --> 00:08:00.686
these cancel out and so this is your,

00:08:00.686 --> 00:08:02.519
the magnitude of your acceleration.

00:08:02.519 --> 00:08:05.419
And notice you have the
same difference in weights

00:08:05.419 --> 00:08:08.492
that's providing the
net force on the system

00:08:08.492 --> 00:08:11.186
but is now accelerating more mass,

00:08:11.186 --> 00:08:12.973
so you could even say, hey look,

00:08:12.973 --> 00:08:15.316
I have more mass here,

00:08:15.316 --> 00:08:18.093
so more mass to accelerate,

00:08:18.093 --> 00:08:20.979
more mass,

00:08:20.979 --> 00:08:24.619
more mass to accelerate
while I have the same

00:08:24.619 --> 00:08:26.499
net force acting on the system,

00:08:26.499 --> 00:08:27.788
we're not talking about
the internal forces,

00:08:27.788 --> 00:08:32.504
those all canceled out when
I added these equations

00:08:32.504 --> 00:08:34.467
and so if you're taking the same net force

00:08:34.467 --> 00:08:35.975
and you're dividing it by more mass

00:08:35.975 --> 00:08:37.717
you're going to have a smaller,

00:08:37.717 --> 00:08:39.512
smaller acceleration.

00:08:39.512 --> 00:08:42.484
Hopefully that all made sense to you.
