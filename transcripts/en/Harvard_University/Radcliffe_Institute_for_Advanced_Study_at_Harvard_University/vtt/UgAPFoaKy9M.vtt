00:00:06.188 --> 00:00:11.580
-Across the British West Indies
and the whole British empire,

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.440
the slave trade and the
institution of slavery

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.940
was officially
abolished in 1834.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.490
This is conventionally
said to mark

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.460
the end of bondage, the rise
of quote unquote "liberalism".

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:33.210
The origin point for an
eventual freedom for all.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.250
For the four years
preceding that date,

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.560
a halfway house institution was
erected called Apprenticeship.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.020
During the
apprenticeship period,

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.880
enslaved people across
the British Caribbean

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.090
were put into a
new legal category,

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.720
half property, half person.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.540
They were made into
debt peons, paying off

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.360
half of the price of their
manumission through their work.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.390
The other half would be borne
by the British state, which

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.920
authorized a mind-bogglingly
large compensation

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.540
package for the slave owners
of the Caribbean in 1834.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.240
Damned as property
and damned as persons,

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.150
the so-called
apprentices were made

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.750
to compensate their enslavers
for the slave owner's

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.850
loss instead of the
other way around.

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.490
Slave owners, sensing the
end of their way of life,

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.150
what Jean Rhys in
her beautiful book

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.780
describes as the
garden of quote unquote

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.950
"dead flowers and gardens
gone to the bush" unquote,

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.100
seemed intends to whip,
compel, and coerce

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.790
the last drops of life and
labor out of a decaying system.

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.610
But they did not
confine the whip

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.470
to the bounds of the Caribbean.

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.280
In fact, they began to whip,
compel, and coerce laborers

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.180
in the work houses of
Ireland, and Scotland,

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.750
and southern England.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.120
But more significantly, a
regime of force and coercion

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.620
arose across Asia
and Asia Pacific,

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.510
and eventually across
the interior of Africa.

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.470
Often, through
kidnapping and trickery

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.930
and the use of brute
force, new laborers

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:12.460
were brought from distant
lands to the plantations

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.830
of the Caribbean at the
coming of abolition.

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.800
These workers, mostly
from Asia, were

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.990
called quote unquote "Coolies".

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.270
They were contract
laborers or sometimes

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.230
debt peons--
there's a difference

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.330
and I can talk about that
after-- working under the dread

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.980
of corporal punishment.

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.530
At the same time, the plantation
itself mutated into new shape

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.360
and began to travel
the face of the earth.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.110
It is in this context
in British Guyana

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:50.420
that the following events
took place in 1836.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.250
The plantation of Vreed en
Hoop, peace and hope ironically

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.860
enough, that's
what it was called.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.880
A plantation in
British Guiana was

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:03.840
owned by this man, John
Gladstone, who lived in London.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.490
On that plantation,
Rose, a black laborer

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.760
of the plantation Vreed en Hoop
was deposed by a fact finding

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.950
committee about events that had
just recently transpired there.

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.580
She testified
quote, "I recollect

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:27.230
some Coolies running away and
going to Berbice long time ago.

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.780
It was two or three
months after they came.

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.800
I heard they went to Berbice.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.990
We were free before they
went away--" meaning this

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.150
is just after 1834.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.430
"Adonnis, a black slave foreman,
and Ramsing, an Indian Sardar,

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.650
or an overseer for the
Coolies, were sent for them.

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.420
The Coolies returned before
Adonnis and Ramsing came back.

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.410
I saw them when they were
brought to the estate,

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.490
but I did not see
who brought them.

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:56.590
They were carried
to the sick house.

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.170
Next day, they flogged
all those that ran away.

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:01.750
They brought all
from the sick house

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.970
together, and took them to
the negro yard to be flogged.

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.360
I saw them flogged.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.460
Mr Jacobs was the only
white man present.

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:12.730
The driver for
them flogged them.

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:14.910
They were flogged
one after the other.

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.870
They got more than three licks,
but I cannot say how many,

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.390
amd cannot say
that they got five.

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.960
Their backs are not
cut, but in bumps.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.020
They appeared to me as
severely punished as my mateys

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.690
were during the
apprenticeship when flogged.

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.500
They're flogged
with a cat, a cat

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.380
o' nine tails whip, the
same as was formally in use.

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.780
Some cried and some did not cry.

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.590
There was no blood.

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.350
When the blacks
have been flogged,

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:46.570
I have seen blood on
their backs," unquote.

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.970
Notice some salient features
of this first hand account

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.570
from Britain, who
first, the speaker

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.910
is a black slave woman
speaking about the attempted

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.390
escape of Indian quote
unquote "Coolies"

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.170
or indentured servants
from the plantation.

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:04.490
Second, the audience is
a fact finding committee

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:09.250
convened in 1838 to determine
whether practices of slavery

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:13.760
were continuing, even after
the abolition of slavery.

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.330
Third, notice that a black
and an Indian observer

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.410
are sent out to
capture the absconders.

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:22.320
Forth, notice Rose's
comparative analysis

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.240
in which she remarks the
ways that Indians are now

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.350
treated like black
slaves, whipped

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:31.110
in the same negro yards,
kept in the same sick houses,

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:35.920
flogged as severely by the
same cat o' nine tail whips.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.590
But she also mentions
this difference.

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:41.720
She sees no blood
on their backs,

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:46.470
which is different from what
the slaves used to experience.

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:49.760
The outcome of
the investigations

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.910
into these forms of
punishment so reminiscent

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:57.380
of slavery, the torture on Vreed
en Hoop where the following.

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:59.250
The general manager
of the estate,

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:01.930
the manager of the Coolies,
and the medical officer

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:05.530
were all indicted and
convicted a brutal assaults

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:08.600
before the inferior criminal
court of British Guyana,

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.670
and neither fined
nor imprisoned.

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:16.310
The result however, for
this man John Gladstone,

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:19.230
the slave owner of Vreed en
Hoop, who lived in London

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:21.290
is a study in contrast.

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:24.370
He went on to become one
of the most important power

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:27.670
brokers in London just
at this time, fashioning

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:31.080
policy for the whole
British West Indies, as well

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.550
as the British East Indies,
and for the labor migration

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:36.890
system that connected the two.

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:38.820
This plantation
owner John Gladstone

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:41.140
remained a very important man.

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:44.205
He stood at the center
of plantation empire.

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:00.470
Here we have in the 1830s,
an unprecedented conjuncture

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:04.200
and entanglement of once
distant peoples and histories,

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:08.320
bound together by commercial,
military, and political ties,

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:12.400
linking Britain, the
Caribbean, Africa, and India.

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:16.380
We see emerging ideas
about race, labor, economy,

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:21.100
agriculture, and ecology.

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:24.980
My central argument is that
the labor relations, land

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:27.460
relations, financial
institutions,

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:31.330
an agroecological
relations so characteristic

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:34.390
of Caribbean slavery,
did not die away

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:39.550
in the 1830s with
abolition, but rather went

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:42.070
through a genuine
mutation, which

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:44.890
allowed them to travel
like a metastasis

00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:48.580
to new parts of the earth,
and to implant and expand

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:51.060
across the global south.

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:53.970
Caribbean forms
of force, control,

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:58.400
and industrial agriculture were
disimbedded through abolition,

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:02.630
and traveled eastward to the
Indian Ocean, Asia Pacific,

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:04.800
and sub-Saharan Africa.

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:07.450
The planter class of
the British empire,

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:09.640
and although I'm
not an expert, I

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:11.960
would surmise the French
and the Dutch empires

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:16.210
as well-- that planter
class found life after death

00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:19.090
in the east.

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:22.210
The events taking
place in the 1830s

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:26.070
have important implications
for the world we live in today.

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:29.130
The unprecedented events taking
place on the Vreed en Hoop

00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:33.070
plantation in British
Guyana, and eventually

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:39.140
across this whole belt that
has been called the world

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:41.640
plantation belt,
signaled the rise

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:46.680
of a new global
agroecological regime,

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:49.280
based on an
accelerated enclosure

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:51.530
of crop lands across
the global south

00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:54.390
as well as the expansion of
settler farming across North

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:56.405
America and the white
settler colonies.

00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:03.610
So plantation slavery
ends in the 1830s

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:07.710
in the British empire, and
other empires follow after that.

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:10.180
This period from
the 1830s onwards

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:12.400
is often considered to be
the age of the Industrial

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.590
Revolution, the age
of liberal empire,

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:17.090
or the age of liberalism.

00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:20.250
And what I'm interested
in is in some ways, what's

00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:24.560
happening on the plantations
and how the plantations spread

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:27.400
exactly at that time,
exactly at the time

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.870
that conventional
wisdom tells us bondage

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:33.610
was coming to an end.

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:36.210
The period from
the 1830s to 1930

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:39.470
saw an eruption of
plantation farming, marked

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:41.390
by the production
of export oriented

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:46.380
agricultural commodities that
fed the Industrial Revolution.

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:48.660
The agricultural
products that went

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:53.400
into making refined sugar,
soap, rubber for tires,

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:58.000
tea, clothing to
clothe the workers

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.950
in European industrial cities,
as well as the shipping

00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:04.810
bags used to package
goods and commodities

00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:08.570
to be sent overseas,
were produced initially

00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:11.550
on colonial plantations
using forced

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:14.440
labor of different kinds.

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:18.330
The lands on which of these
plantation enclosures appeared

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:22.180
were confiscated through
militarism, taken away

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:25.970
from sovereign groups
considered to lack sovereignty

00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:30.150
due to their perceived
racial inferiority.

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:34.040
These agricultural commodities
were sent by railroads and then

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:38.380
by sea to factories in Europe.

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:41.200
Up to the 1830s,
Europe's trade with Asia

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:44.710
was primarily marked by what
is called mercantile trade

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:47.250
by commerce and
exchange of silver

00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:52.170
for commodities such as spices,
or porcelain, or textiles.

00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:54.740
But beginning in the
1830s, we see the rise

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:57.970
of the new aggressive,
militarized plunder

00:10:57.970 --> 00:11:01.040
and conquest of Asian
lands and the destruction

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:02.940
of native sovereignties
that actually

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:06.140
echoed that previous
period of slavery

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:08.810
and what took place on
the west coast of Africa

00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:11.190
and across the Americas.

00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:14.830
As part of this big change,
what Kenneth Pomeranz calls

00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:17.970
the quote unquote
"great divergence,"

00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:29.350
huge populations were displaced
across the Bay of Bengal, which

00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:33.200
it's right there on the end.

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:36.190
Across the Bay of Bengal,
and across the South China

00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:40.440
Sea on this side of
the map, and were

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:42.540
sent to other parts
of the earth to work

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:47.730
in industrial agriculture
at suppressed wages.

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:50.420
A portion of this displacement
was inter-regional

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:54.660
with tens of millions of
Africans, Indians, Chinese, and

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:58.070
Japanese laborers boarding
ships for the Caribbean,

00:11:58.070 --> 00:12:01.500
the American West Coast, Latin
America, and the shores of Asia

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:02.530
Pacific.

00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:04.880
And I wanted to also mention
that at the same time

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:09.760
the 1830s, if you go what's
happening here in the Atlantic,

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:12.410
this is also in some ways the
eruption of the slave trade.

00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:14.510
It's taking place to
the American South,

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:18.720
it's also taking place
especially to Brazil.

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:20.790
So that factors into
the story as well.

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:24.390
But there is even a larger
number, and obscure number

00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:27.830
of laborers who are migrating
regionally or internally

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:31.160
to work on nearby emerging
plantation frontiers that

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:35.480
were opening up across
Asia at the time.

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:38.290
The Asian and Pacific waters
in addition to the Atlantic,

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:43.940
served as a labor well for the
emerging agroecological regime.

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:47.530
Simultaneously, huge amounts
of credit and finance capital

00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:49.900
were disinvested
from the Caribbean

00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:54.620
and now directed to agrarian
frontiers in India, Ceylon,

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:59.250
Malaya, Vietnam, Indonesia,
Hawaii, and the list goes on.

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:05.660
Here, we have a global whirlwind
of the plantation complex.

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:09.780
A churning storm of circulating
bodies, investments,

00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:15.190
and institutions around the eye
of London, Amsterdam, Paris,

00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:18.600
and other European centers
of finance, credit,

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:21.590
and joint stock companies.

00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:24.280
A century-long
agroecological regime

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:30.860
emerged around the 1830s,
veiled by the terminology

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:35.100
of liberalism and free trade,
which actually depended heavily

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:38.740
on the expansion of course,
of force, occupation,

00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:42.570
and waged bondage to all
corners of the earth.

00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:44.675
The Caribbean
moved to Asia, just

00:13:44.675 --> 00:13:47.700
as Asia moved to the
Caribbean during the decades

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:51.550
of the plantation empire.

00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:54.450
The plantation complex
invented in the Caribbean,

00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:58.020
entailed a racial system of
land appropriation and labor

00:13:58.020 --> 00:13:59.170
control.

00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:02.230
It entailed the
enclosure of lands

00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:05.220
for the intense cultivation
of single crops,

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:07.650
a practice called
monocropping, which

00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:10.110
were sent into the
international market.

00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:12.330
The plantation complex
involved the outlay

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:15.490
of huge amounts of
credit, which served

00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:18.875
as the lever for vast
infrastructural projects

00:14:18.875 --> 00:14:21.280
of agroecological
transformation,

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:25.300
including land enclosure,
irrigation works, railways,

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:27.940
and the dredging
of deep sea docks.

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:31.180
In short, the plantation complex
invented in the Caribbean

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:37.300
from about the 1600s
to the end of 1700s

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:40.850
mixed together racism,
colonialism, finance capital,

00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:44.710
mercantile capital, militarism,
and agricultural science

00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:48.360
in such a way that allowed
that complex like a metastasis,

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:53.920
to pick up, disembed itself,
and travel to new places.

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:59.380
I wanted to show you in a
series of three graphs or maps

00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:02.640
visually, how that plantation
complex actually traveled.

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:06.860
So 1710, this is
kind of the beginning

00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:09.420
of the story if you like,
where the plantation complex

00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:15.400
is mostly here in the
Americas in North and South.

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:19.740
Then we come to 1838, which
is right after the time

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:22.370
of abolition and you
see that the new centers

00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:25.160
for the plantation
are the Indian Ocean,

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:29.160
certainly Mauritius, parts
of West Africa, parts

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:31.420
of East Africa.

00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:34.510
And then finally, when it comes
into its full fledged form

00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:39.760
by the 1920s, it's now
spreading across the whole band

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:44.050
from the Tropic of Capricorn
to the Tropic of Cancer,

00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:48.570
across what would come to
be called the third world.

00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:52.210
So what traveled along with
this plantation complex?

00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:56.090
As the plantation complex
traveled from the Caribbean Sea

00:15:56.090 --> 00:15:58.350
to the Indian Ocean
and Asia Pacific,

00:15:58.350 --> 00:16:00.220
we see the transfer
and adaptation,

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:04.476
the mutation of forms of forced
labor including the chain gang.

00:16:04.476 --> 00:16:05.850
This is a chain
gang that you see

00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:09.820
depicted, the preference
for women on the fields.

00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:11.710
This was a phenomenon
of slavery actually,

00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:14.330
that as slavery became
a more mature system,

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:16.900
there was a preference to
employ women as opposed

00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:19.910
to men on fields because they
were more easily exploitable,

00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:22.850
thanks to both cultural
forms of patriarchy

00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:27.390
as well as capital quote unquote
"modern" forms of patriarchy.

00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:29.740
The use of the task wage--
you can ask me what that is,

00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:31.180
but it's a different
kind of wage

00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:33.830
that was often
used under slavery,

00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:35.400
and during indentureship.

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:39.400
The enduring presence
of coercive overseers,

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:45.370
there he is on his horse,
with their paraphernalia

00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:50.130
of rods and whips and the use of
physical violence as a subsidy

00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:54.550
to make labor cheaper
and more pliable.

00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:58.200
We also see the transfer of
horticultural and botanical

00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:01.520
methods as evidenced
by these master manuals

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:03.760
from the Caribbean
that began to circulate

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:06.849
across the new plantation
frontiers of Asia

00:17:06.849 --> 00:17:08.390
by the mid 19th century.

00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:13.369
Some of the most important are
for example, Monnereau, Elias

00:17:13.369 --> 00:17:15.270
Monnereau indigo planter.

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:18.780
He was a planter in the
1700s in Saint Domingue which

00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:19.770
became Haiti.

00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:26.530
And this document,
the Indigo Maker,

00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:29.780
became one of the most
celebrated manuals in places

00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:35.780
like Java, Ceylon, Bengal in
the 1820s, '30s, and '40s.

00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:42.800
Laborie is also here,
who was another coffee

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:45.345
planter of Saint Domingue.

00:17:45.345 --> 00:17:48.950
A planter from
the Saint Domingue

00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:50.290
before it became Haiti again.

00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:52.580
And this document became
especially important

00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:54.590
for example, in Ceylon
and Malaya where there

00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:56.340
was a lot of coffee planting.

00:17:56.340 --> 00:18:02.010
There is also Alvaro Reynoso,
who was a planter in Cuba

00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:04.170
and a specialist in
sugar production.

00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:11.400
And this manual again, travelled
to parts of Bengal, Malaya,

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:16.871
Ceylon, Indonesia, Philippines
as sugar production was begun

00:18:16.871 --> 00:18:17.370
there.

00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:22.710
So one interesting point is that
places like Jamaica and Haiti

00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:26.810
were not just significant
within their own empires,

00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:33.260
but they were seen in some ways
as the scientific experimental

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:36.000
hotbeds, or think
tanks if you like,

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:41.420
for how the modern industrial
plantation should work.

00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:45.000
And they had an afterlife much
after the end of the slave

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.300
regimes in Saint
Domingue or Jamaica,

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:51.180
in a very different
part of the world.

00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:53.640
After the abolition of
slavery in the 1830s,

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:55.560
the slave system of
agricultural production

00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:59.650
is not consigned to
history and is also

00:18:59.650 --> 00:19:04.280
not seen as some kind of
abomination or aberration.

00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:09.140
Rather, it becomes a focus of
intense official fascination

00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:12.870
by for example,
British businessmen

00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:14.940
and government
officials investing

00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:18.310
in the new colonial
frontiers of Asia.

00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:20.130
The East India
Company, for example,

00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:23.310
was smitten with what it
called interest in the quote

00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:28.100
unquote "West India method" and
it invited a series of slave

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:31.430
overseers from cotton
plantations and sugar

00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:36.510
plantations in Mississippi,
Louisiana, Jamaica,

00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:40.390
and other islands of the
Caribbean to south India,

00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:44.170
to move to-- they funded their
travel to south India, Bombay,

00:19:44.170 --> 00:19:47.480
Bengal, in order to set
up what they called model

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:50.110
farms in the 1830s and 1840s.

00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:53.830
These overseers brought machines
such as the ones depicted here

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:55.920
like the gin house,
or the vacuum pan,

00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:58.980
which were quintessential
with Caribbean plantation

00:19:58.980 --> 00:19:59.710
production.

00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:02.740
But they also brought with them
their whips their, hot houses,

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:04.640
their sick houses,
their dungeons,

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:08.650
their modes of labor control.

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:11.210
We also have the transfer
of plantation technologies

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:16.540
from the Caribbean to India,
including technologies relating

00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:23.500
to seeds and biota, sugar cane,
cotton, coffee, cocoa, tobacco,

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:27.230
gutta-percha, which was used
to make telegraph lines.

00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:31.750
The ways of perfecting
tea, indigo, jute,

00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:37.760
rubber, all of these botanical
and biological innovations

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:39.920
involve circulations
of knowledge

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:41.810
between the terminy
of the Caribbean

00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:43.830
Sea and the Indian Ocean.

00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:54.200
So I wanted to spend now
the last portion of my talk

00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:56.330
moving in a different
direction, which is less

00:20:56.330 --> 00:21:00.610
talking about what was
migrating, which we know now

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:04.540
where the laborers, the seeds,
the machines, the technologies,

00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:06.340
the conceptual languages.

00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:10.270
And I want to talk more
about how things came

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:12.130
to migrate in the first place.

00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:14.960
What I want to
discuss is what are

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:17.740
the conditions of possibility
for these circulations.

00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:20.820
I want to talk about
the movements of capital

00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:22.760
and of capitalists.

00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:25.400
Here, capital, which
is often invoked

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:29.030
as an ill-defined an
abstract term, here I

00:21:29.030 --> 00:21:32.080
would like to define it
in a more concrete way.

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:36.230
I want to talk about this
in terms of understanding

00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:40.320
how the power to coordinate
the movement of value

00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:43.370
over geographic space developed.

00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:47.790
How the power to disembed,
extract, and accumulate value

00:21:47.790 --> 00:21:50.890
over time was obtained.

00:21:50.890 --> 00:21:53.590
What were the dynamics
of that power that

00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:56.720
managed to create that
whirlwind that I showed you

00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:59.580
a few slides ago, that
managed to coordinate

00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:02.570
that vast and unprecedented
interpenetration

00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:05.200
between the two hemispheres
of the global south.

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:08.060
So that's what I'd
like to move to next.

00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:11.485
And to do that, let's return
to the story of John Gladstone,

00:22:11.485 --> 00:22:14.260
who we met at the
beginning, and consider

00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:17.650
his social and
political constellation.

00:22:17.650 --> 00:22:20.410
John Gladstone was
a Scottish merchant,

00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:23.090
a businessmen from
the English periphery,

00:22:23.090 --> 00:22:26.340
who accumulated immense wealth
and made a name for himself

00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:28.435
quite literally you'll
see, among the gentleman

00:22:28.435 --> 00:22:32.570
and the capitalists of his time.

00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:37.010
He literally bought himself
into the aristocracy obtaining

00:22:37.010 --> 00:22:40.550
through purchase a
baronetcy in his 60's.

00:22:40.550 --> 00:22:44.000
He was born a commoner with
the last name Gladstones.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.020
He soon reinvented
himself, dropping

00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:48.210
that S which smacked
of commonness,

00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:53.060
and thereby made himself
in this gesture, singular.

00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:56.430
His trades on the cotton
exchanges of Liverpool

00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:58.760
went well, and he
soon began investing

00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:01.980
in slaves and plantations
in the Caribbean.

00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:05.620
He eventually put capital
into the East India trade.

00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:08.430
Among his children
were three sons

00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:11.970
of note, Robertson, William,
and Thomas, one of whom

00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:14.790
went on to become the
famous prime minister.

00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:17.820
By 1830, Gladstone who
had garnered vast wealth

00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:20.090
through renteerism and
trade, especially thanks

00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:23.260
to his plantation investments,
his investment in logistics

00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:26.630
and shipping, and his
involvement in the Liverpool

00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:31.540
cotton trade, now decided it
was time to enter the highest

00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:33.570
rung of politics.

00:23:33.570 --> 00:23:36.350
In 1830, now a
very important man,

00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:39.670
he penned a letter to the then
home Secretary Robert Peel,

00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:42.850
explaining that if
slavery were to be ended,

00:23:42.850 --> 00:23:46.280
there would need to be some
new form of cheap labor

00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:48.810
that would have
to take its place.

00:23:48.810 --> 00:23:53.340
Abolition and freedom was
not incompatible, he argued.

00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:57.430
In fact, freedom went along
with the continued project

00:23:57.430 --> 00:24:02.230
of compulsory labor for the
quote unquote "lesser races."

00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:05.570
He proposed replacing slaves
with indentured laborers

00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:07.160
from Africa.

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:10.170
By the time he went to
implement his plan in 1834

00:24:10.170 --> 00:24:12.860
at the time of abolition,
now with the blessing

00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:17.560
of the government, he in
fact obtained his workers

00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:20.510
from indigenous tribes in India.

00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:24.880
By this time, Gladstone
had expanded his plantation

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:34.920
holdings and he sent
his son Robertson

00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:39.370
to Demerara or British Guyana
to oversee his new plantations.

00:24:39.370 --> 00:24:42.300
He also had a nephew,
FM Gillanders,

00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:43.850
whom he sent to Calcutta.

00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:46.200
So here's Gillanders.

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:48.030
And also in Calcutta
at the time,

00:24:48.030 --> 00:24:52.930
was another one of
his nephews Robert.

00:24:52.930 --> 00:24:56.930
And those two formed
a company that

00:24:56.930 --> 00:25:03.250
did the bidding of
Gladstone at a distance.

00:25:03.250 --> 00:25:06.870
In 1834, the British government
compensated slave owners

00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:08.940
for the loss of
their human property.

00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:10.880
I mentioned this
at the very start.

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:15.060
Based on a huge loan taken out
from a banking syndicate led

00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:17.520
by the Rothschilds,
the British government

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:21.060
went into debt to the
tune of 20 million pounds

00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:24.380
at that time, which today has
been estimated by experts to be

00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:31.060
in today's money between
13 billion pounds and 200

00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:34.710
billion pounds, depending on
how you think of that amount.

00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:37.620
And I can tell you details
about how this is calculated.

00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:39.130
But it was a vast
amount of money.

00:25:39.130 --> 00:25:43.540
It was equal to 40% of the gross
domestic product of Britain

00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:44.360
at the time.

00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:46.500
It was a huge debt.

00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:51.330
Using that slave
compensation money,

00:25:51.330 --> 00:25:55.660
Gladstone was able
to enlist his family,

00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:59.630
in order to transfer
this capital now

00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:03.380
to the new frontiers of empire.

00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:05.090
He enlisted his
nephews in Calcutta

00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:08.570
to secure a set of
Indian indigenous

00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:11.940
people, the so-called
Hill people Bihar--

00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:14.100
a term that the
British were using.

00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:17.150
He obtained to ship, he
took that group of Indians

00:26:17.150 --> 00:26:20.370
first to Mauritius
where they started

00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:26.080
working on the plantation
of one of Robert's cousins

00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:28.580
who was a plantation
owner in Mauritius.

00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:30.720
And then from there,
there was another group

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:34.480
that went on to British Guyana
reaching British Guyana in 1834

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:38.500
and making possible the story
that I began with with Rose,

00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:41.560
and what she observed
on the plantations.

00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:43.880
So here, we have the
beginning of an answer

00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:47.330
to the question of how
this genuine mutation

00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:51.320
of the agroindustrial
order took place, beginning

00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:52.410
in the time of abolition.

00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:55.520
This eruption of the
plantation complex.

00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:58.580
The unprecedented eruption
of finance capital

00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:01.310
into the hands of
ex-slave owners

00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:04.800
gave them the power to invest
into new parts of the earth.

00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:07.120
They invested into the
railways of the United States

00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:10.450
and the railways of Scotland,
and the railways of India.

00:27:10.450 --> 00:27:13.790
British banks began investing
in Central America and South

00:27:13.790 --> 00:27:19.030
America, but they also invested
into the plantations of Asia.

00:27:19.030 --> 00:27:22.880
And as much as capital
is an abstraction,

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:26.340
this story shows us that it is
embedded in family relations

00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:30.320
and friendships in the relations
between uncles and nephews,

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:33.980
fathers and sons, and in
the culture of the planter

00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:37.100
class that actually stretched
across the whole British

00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:38.430
empire.

00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:43.150
The life of capital
is a family affair.

00:27:43.150 --> 00:27:47.410
Now during this time, Gladstone
who was located in London,

00:27:47.410 --> 00:27:52.050
began to sit at the
most important tables

00:27:52.050 --> 00:27:54.360
of the British government.

00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:58.080
And he was involved in
informing policy that in that

00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:01.530
affected both the
Caribbean basin and the Bay

00:28:01.530 --> 00:28:04.270
of Bengal together.

00:28:04.270 --> 00:28:06.290
Gladstone, as well
as his sons and close

00:28:06.290 --> 00:28:09.070
friends were involved in
formulating key elements

00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:13.650
for the 1834 New Poor Law,
which affected the quote unquote

00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:16.190
"paupers" of England.

00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:20.470
He helped to define the
apprenticeship system

00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:24.270
through a series of
select committees

00:28:24.270 --> 00:28:27.920
that were called by Parliament,
which I've schematized

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:31.810
here, as well as policies
for the rise of the indenture

00:28:31.810 --> 00:28:32.310
system.

00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:35.040
All of this beginning in
around 1834 and then kind

00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:38.370
of playing out of
the next decade.

00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:40.390
So we see here
what I'm beginning

00:28:40.390 --> 00:28:42.290
to think of as a kind
of Gladstone clique.

00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:45.840
And don't really have time to go
into so much detail about what

00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:48.860
these lines represent, but they
represent either family bonds

00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:49.780
or friendship.

00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:52.570
In red, we have
actual slave owners,

00:28:52.570 --> 00:28:54.810
people who had slaves
in the Caribbean

00:28:54.810 --> 00:28:56.580
who received
compensation, and who

00:28:56.580 --> 00:28:59.342
went on to then define
what apprenticeships

00:28:59.342 --> 00:29:00.050
should look like.

00:29:00.050 --> 00:29:03.550
Or went on to define how trade
should take place East India.

00:29:03.550 --> 00:29:07.840
Or to foreign policy
for the establishment

00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:11.080
of the plantations across the
Bay of Bengal in the 1840s.

00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:14.862
So this group remained
extremely influential in what

00:29:14.862 --> 00:29:17.320
some historians call the rise
of the second British empire,

00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:20.830
which is the British
empire after 1830s.

00:29:20.830 --> 00:29:24.440
Here for example, is
another image showing you

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:27.210
a variety of
directors and chairman

00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:29.530
of the East India Company
who were slave owners, who

00:29:29.530 --> 00:29:32.540
received compensation in 1834.

00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:35.830
And who therefore were obviously
carrying with them a lot

00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:38.560
of conceptual baggage,
but also a lot of wealth

00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:43.280
from that huge payout that
the British government gave

00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:46.370
in that time.

00:29:46.370 --> 00:29:52.390
Caribbean slave owning capital
travelled to Asia after 1834

00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:57.810
and established a net of
ligaments and connections that

00:29:57.810 --> 00:30:02.900
in fact, linked the Caribbean
and Asia in an unprecedented

00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:03.400
way.

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:07.450
And I came up with some
schematizations of this.

00:30:07.450 --> 00:30:10.320
I'll try to explain
what this is showing.

00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:14.210
And this is thanks to help that
I received from two colleagues

00:30:14.210 --> 00:30:18.380
in London, Nick Draper
and Chris Jessupson,

00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:22.425
as well as work that was done
by two of the Radcliffe fellows

00:30:22.425 --> 00:30:24.190
at here.

00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:26.516
And a lot of time reading
the compensation report

00:30:26.516 --> 00:30:28.390
and looking through
trying to cross reference

00:30:28.390 --> 00:30:31.470
with the archives of
the East India Company.

00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:35.240
And what this shows, each
of these dots is a person.

00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:37.820
And there are 97 dots there.

00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:40.190
There are 97 slave
owners that we've

00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:44.420
traced thus far who actually
transferred their capital

00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:49.894
from the Caribbean to Asia
sometime between the 1800s

00:30:49.894 --> 00:30:51.510
and 1840.

00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:56.000
So there's a kind
of a 40 year image

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.460
or perspective that is being
presented here in one graph.

00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:03.130
And I wanted to first--
maybe we can just

00:31:03.130 --> 00:31:05.440
look at this in terms
of the gestalt of it,

00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:08.270
and you see that some
of the main connections

00:31:08.270 --> 00:31:10.510
are made through the
East India Company.

00:31:10.510 --> 00:31:12.939
They are also made
through Bengal.

00:31:12.939 --> 00:31:15.230
You see that some of the main
connections the Caribbean

00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:19.610
are coming out of
Jamaica, but also Granada.

00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:25.270
And you also see Guyana
coming up very, very often.

00:31:25.270 --> 00:31:27.820
Now to make this make
a little more sense,

00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:31.776
I pulled out just a few examples
from within this group of 97.

00:31:31.776 --> 00:31:33.150
And then there
are more, but this

00:31:33.150 --> 00:31:35.710
is the beginning
of trying to trace

00:31:35.710 --> 00:31:39.130
in a very concrete way,
the extent to which

00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:41.920
this slave capital, this
compensation capital

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:43.920
was being transferred.

00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:45.420
I give you four examples.

00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:49.600
First, Leonard Ray who
was born in Jamaica.

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:51.390
And he owned plantations there.

00:31:51.390 --> 00:31:56.560
And he departed a for Bengal
in the 1840s, where he started

00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:59.000
sugar plantations in Garapur.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.770
And by the late 1840s, he
then moved on to Malaya,

00:32:01.770 --> 00:32:04.230
establishing coffee
plantations and he

00:32:04.230 --> 00:32:06.570
became known in Malaya
as the quote unquote

00:32:06.570 --> 00:32:09.300
"father of coffee."

00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:13.492
Thomas Boyce Tipler, born in
Aberdeen Shire in Scotland.

00:32:13.492 --> 00:32:15.950
He was sent to Jamaica-- this
is a very interesting story--

00:32:15.950 --> 00:32:18.830
he was sent to Jamaica
at the age of 15

00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:22.400
to apprentice on a plantation,
just at the time when

00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:23.216
slavery was ending.

00:32:23.216 --> 00:32:25.590
Just at the time when there
was fear that the West Indian

00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:27.430
method was going to die away.

00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:31.360
He then went on
at age 18 in 1838

00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:34.170
to Ceylon, where he went on
to make a name for himself

00:32:34.170 --> 00:32:37.930
as the quote unquote "father
of Ceylonese coffee."

00:32:37.930 --> 00:32:44.450
And he also did a lot of work
in developing the migrant labor

00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:48.490
system in Ceylon
for the government.

00:32:48.490 --> 00:32:51.740
Julie Dartie, a planter
of French origin

00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:56.400
who redirected to her capital
from the slave plantations

00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:59.420
into shipping, and
began investing heavily

00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:04.040
in the shipment of indentured
slaves to Mauritius.

00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:08.240
And Giddan Dutai, at least
one planter that I've found.

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:11.770
I've been looking very
intently for more,

00:33:11.770 --> 00:33:14.930
but this is one example of a
planter from Saint Domingue who

00:33:14.930 --> 00:33:19.900
then travels across the imperial
boundary from the French empire

00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:21.360
to the Dutch empire.

00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:24.640
And we meet him
next in Java, where

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:28.620
he's an owner of coffee
plantations there.

00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:31.690
The effect of all of these
planter migrations and capital

00:33:31.690 --> 00:33:35.450
transfers was the propagation
in different and new parts

00:33:35.450 --> 00:33:39.430
of the earth of diverse features
of this plantation complex

00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:41.340
that I outlined earlier.

00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:43.690
Global economic
mutations take place

00:33:43.690 --> 00:33:48.530
because of impersonal abstract
forces, yes, on one level,

00:33:48.530 --> 00:33:49.410
of course.

00:33:49.410 --> 00:33:53.580
But they also take place
because of material, personal,

00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:58.680
and interpersonal
movements at another level.

00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:02.820
In the 1830s, to the 1850s,
we see a proliferation

00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:05.780
of experiments by
small scale planters.

00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:08.840
The rise of a decentralized
network of finance.

00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:11.449
Racial forms of domination
and exploitation

00:34:11.449 --> 00:34:14.090
traveled through this
planter diaspora.

00:34:14.090 --> 00:34:16.940
We see the use of techniques
such as whipping, boxing

00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:19.639
of ears, the using of prisons,
the using of hot houses,

00:34:19.639 --> 00:34:22.840
the use of gang labor and task
work, as I mentioned before.

00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:25.090
And all of this is also
traveling through these family

00:34:25.090 --> 00:34:27.870
ties and friendship networks
just as much as the capital is.

00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:32.250
Now I want to conclude
the story by seeing

00:34:32.250 --> 00:34:35.060
what happens to this
plantation complex by the time

00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:38.889
that we reach our own days.

00:34:38.889 --> 00:34:42.429
From the 1870s to the 1930s,
we see the consolidation

00:34:42.429 --> 00:34:45.429
of this agroecological
regime under the sway

00:34:45.429 --> 00:34:48.820
now of new great
multinational corporations.

00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:51.590
The rise of multinationals
and the pumping in of finance

00:34:51.590 --> 00:34:55.139
capital allows for the
expansion of modern industrial

00:34:55.139 --> 00:34:58.570
agriculture all the
way now from the Tropic

00:34:58.570 --> 00:35:01.370
of Cancer to
Capricorn, across what

00:35:01.370 --> 00:35:05.420
will become as I have said
before, known as an actress

00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:07.460
category, the third world.

00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:10.960
Unilever, Tate and Lyle,
Sunlight, Booker McConnell,

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:14.220
Tetley Tea which is
like a litany now,

00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:20.360
Lipton's, Duncan's, Ford,
Firestone, Dunlop, Michelin,

00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:23.990
Good Year, United Fruit
Company, Alexander and Baldwin

00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:27.810
thanks to Tiano for that, and
other such huge multinationals

00:35:27.810 --> 00:35:31.090
began to agglomerate their
plantation holdings worldwide.

00:35:31.090 --> 00:35:33.220
And in many parts
of the global south,

00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:35.960
these companies actually
became inseparable

00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:38.100
from the state itself.

00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:40.980
British Malaya went from
having not a single rubber

00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:45.640
plant to producing more
than 500,000 tons of rubber

00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:49.310
per year between 1900 and 1920.

00:35:49.310 --> 00:35:53.630
Unilever cultivated
74,000 hectares of land

00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:59.830
the size greater than New York
City in oil palms between 1911

00:35:59.830 --> 00:36:02.540
and 1918 in the Congo.

00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:05.270
The Ford corporation
tried and failed

00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:08.860
to turn 15,000 square
kilometers of the Amazon

00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:12.860
into a huge rubber plantation
in the 1920s, an area

00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:15.960
that they called Fordlandia.

00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:19.330
But what was happening
behind the branding?

00:36:19.330 --> 00:36:22.420
We see in the sources
the way that the terms

00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:25.420
black and niggers come
to be employed in company

00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:28.010
correspondences and in
corporate boardrooms,

00:36:28.010 --> 00:36:30.890
to talk about ethnic
communities as diverse

00:36:30.890 --> 00:36:33.950
as Bengales, Filipinos,
Afro-Caribbean,

00:36:33.950 --> 00:36:36.280
Indo-Caribbeans, and Fijians.

00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:39.020
In this parlance,
black refers to a kind

00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:42.450
of laboring body on the
fields subject to bondage,

00:36:42.450 --> 00:36:46.560
requiring discipline, requiring
civilization through labor.

00:36:51.770 --> 00:36:53.840
I wanted to show you
two more images here.

00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:57.480
So these are images from
this 1920s 1930s period,

00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:02.110
and scholars talk
about in some ways,

00:37:02.110 --> 00:37:04.480
the staging of the photograph.

00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:06.670
And here we have
the blacks, and we

00:37:06.670 --> 00:37:13.200
have the white overseer or
the white corporate visitor

00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:14.520
on the plantations.

00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:18.990
Here is Tate and Lyle, which
is still today a huge sugar

00:37:18.990 --> 00:37:19.780
producer.

00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:23.070
This is an image from their
big plantation in Caroni.

00:37:23.070 --> 00:37:25.880
And again, we have this in
a very quintessential kind

00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:28.930
of colonial scene.

00:37:28.930 --> 00:37:32.730
By the 1950s, economists from
across the third world argued

00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:38.050
forcefully that this expansion
of the plantation complex first

00:37:38.050 --> 00:37:41.000
thanks to footloose planters
and the help of the colonial

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.360
states, and then due to the
machinations of multinational

00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:48.640
corporations, resulted in quote
unquote "de-industrialization"

00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:53.620
and the enduring independence
third world nations on Western

00:37:53.620 --> 00:37:56.990
economic institutions.

00:37:56.990 --> 00:37:59.980
Now we live in a
post 1830s world,

00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:03.180
I would like to argue
after this talk.

00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:08.130
The Green Revolution of
the 1930s to the 1970s,

00:38:08.130 --> 00:38:09.950
the period that follows
what we might think

00:38:09.950 --> 00:38:12.410
of as the age of
plantation empire,

00:38:12.410 --> 00:38:17.930
was marked by the rise of a US
dominated regime of genetically

00:38:17.930 --> 00:38:20.220
engineered seeds,
petro fertilizing,

00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:22.920
which means the use of
petroleum product derivatives

00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:27.140
to make the land more
productive, but also poisons

00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:31.820
and obviously kills biological
life at the same time.

00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:35.430
As well as the coming of great
mechanization to plantations.

00:38:35.430 --> 00:38:38.740
All of this was
actually integrated

00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:41.100
into the national
policy directives

00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:44.396
of many new third world
nations during this time

00:38:44.396 --> 00:38:46.020
of the Green Revolution,
which was also

00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:49.070
the time of decolonization.

00:38:49.070 --> 00:38:53.160
But beginning in the 1980s,
this Green Revolution period

00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:56.470
was superseded by the
strident re-involvement

00:38:56.470 --> 00:38:59.300
of Western banks and
multinational corporations

00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:04.400
in redesigning agrarian
frontiers across the earth.

00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:06.829
The period of new enclosures
in which we still live.

00:39:06.829 --> 00:39:08.370
And that's not my
term, that's a term

00:39:08.370 --> 00:39:12.610
that many ecologists
and critical economists

00:39:12.610 --> 00:39:14.940
use to talk about our present.

00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:19.390
Argentina, Brazil, Indonesia,
the Philippines, Thailand,

00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:24.200
southern parts of Africa have
borne the agroecological brunt

00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:27.160
a transnational finance.

00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:29.860
Today, food security
in developing nations

00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:35.085
across the world has
diminished, not grown,

00:39:35.085 --> 00:39:39.150
as many of these nations produce
more agricultural commodities

00:39:39.150 --> 00:39:42.970
for international markets than
staples for their own home

00:39:42.970 --> 00:39:44.440
consumption.

00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:48.530
The ILO estimates that
500 million people today

00:39:48.530 --> 00:39:50.680
work on plantations,
but this does not

00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:54.250
include the millions of
undocumented children

00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:58.120
and often, undocumented
women who are

00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:00.510
a major part of this economy.

00:40:00.510 --> 00:40:04.280
In fact, that 500 million
is a gross underestimate.

00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:06.790
Undocumented trades
in shadow economies

00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:10.630
and informal employment,
whether in the agricultural or

00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:14.585
non-agricultural sectors,
comprise more than half

00:40:14.585 --> 00:40:18.460
of all employment
in the world today.

00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:20.790
It is said that
likely the majority

00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:27.210
of the undocumented workers in
the informal economy are women.

00:40:27.210 --> 00:40:31.120
In other words, more
than half of the laborers

00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:35.960
that make this world economy
run are hidden from our sight.

00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:39.960
Unrecognized by governments,
unregistered by statistics,

00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:42.700
but also easily
invoked as scapegoats

00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:45.900
to explain economic turmoil.

00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:49.720
Our consumption depends
on for as its condition

00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:53.930
of possibility on the continued
and accelerated dispossession

00:40:53.930 --> 00:40:57.812
and enclosure of sovereign
cultural domains.

00:40:57.812 --> 00:40:59.270
And just to make
that point, that's

00:40:59.270 --> 00:41:00.394
what this graph is showing.

00:41:00.394 --> 00:41:03.570
That the rate of
increase of enclosure

00:41:03.570 --> 00:41:05.970
has gone up over time,
including to our own time.

00:41:05.970 --> 00:41:08.740
It hasn't gone down, it's
not as if this process

00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:11.550
has abated or come to an end.

00:41:11.550 --> 00:41:15.390
Our consumption depends as the
condition of its possibility,

00:41:15.390 --> 00:41:17.820
on the continued and
accelerated dispossession

00:41:17.820 --> 00:41:19.870
and enclosure of
sovereign cultural lands,

00:41:19.870 --> 00:41:23.160
the purchase of human
labor at discounted rates

00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:27.080
by the use of bondage and force,
and the large scale destruction

00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:29.555
of the ecological web of life.

00:41:32.450 --> 00:41:38.290
But poets, artists, writers,
activists, and every day

00:41:38.290 --> 00:41:42.700
surviving people within
the plantation complex

00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:46.570
and within the vast
realm that some scholars

00:41:46.570 --> 00:41:48.200
call the realm of
disposable life,

00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:50.770
or the disposable economy.

00:41:50.770 --> 00:41:53.750
Even by the everyday
acts of survival,

00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:59.290
make the point that there is an
inscrutable way in which life

00:41:59.290 --> 00:42:06.360
resists, regenerates,
endures, reassembles,

00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:11.900
and it does so as it resists
the violent pursuit of enclosure

00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:15.230
and control that
masquerades as progress,

00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:17.050
and has done so for centuries.

00:42:27.172 --> 00:42:28.630
And that's my talk.

00:42:28.630 --> 00:42:30.460
Thank you.
