00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:01.800
So I don't really
understand young people. 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.220
Like, I know I am one technically speaking,
or I'm meant to be at least, 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.900
but I've always felt like I identify
more with sleepy old men 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.710
than I do with the
"youth" of today.

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:12.710
And this isn't all
young people, 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.160
but your stereotypical
18- to 25-year-old,

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:22.010
who goes to lots of parties and has a lot of fun
and says the word YOLO a lot, 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:23.210
I find them
very confusing. 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.080
However, back in October, I found
myself doing one of those things 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.500
that crazy
young people do, 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.970
and I went on a road trip
around Europe 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.230
with a bunch of fun loving YouTube
kids because, you know what, 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.200
you do only
live once. SIGH

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.570
The whole trip was organized and paid for
by the overly nice people of Contiki, 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.360
who are a "youth" oriented
travel company.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.090
They planned out
every activity for us, 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.320
even down to like what
food we were eating,

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.470
which, as a self confessed
control freak, was pretty terrifying. 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.840
And one of those things that Contiki
decided for us was our "morning song," 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.630
which was one song that Contiki played
at us every single morning of the trip 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:00.620
when we got
on our coach.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.160
And the song that they picked, naturally,
was "We Are Young" by Fun., 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.960
a song all about being young
and getting drunk 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.290
and having a nice time
and setting the night on fire, 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.040
which sounds incredibly
dangerous to me. 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.680
Let's just say that it's not a
song I can identify with, 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.930
nor is it a song that I ever thought
I would know all the lyrics to, but I now do. 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.160
The plan was to visit five
different countries in ten days, 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.050
so we were
packing a lot in, 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.340
and we started in Munich, Germany
around the time of Oktoberfest, 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.730
which is the
world's largest fair. 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.240
What I found about Germany
is that there is a lot of meat, 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.090
there is a lot of potatoes,
and there is a lot of beer.

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.340
and Oktoberfest, specifically,
is a temporary Disneyland, basically, 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.940
but specifically for beer,
and I don't drink, surprisingly,

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.960
so naturally I was a bit skeptical
of the whole thing, 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.000
especially of the giant beer tents
filled to the brim with drunk people. 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.800
I was surprised to find,
though, that the rowdiness 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.880
that I tend to associate with
large amounts of drinking here in the UK

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:53.950
just wasn't really there. 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.140
Everyone was just
sort of nice and jolly. 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.740
Our second stop on
the trip was Austria, 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.380
which became an instant favorite of mine
just because of how relaxing it was. 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.770
It was beautiful and quiet, 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.130
and we had this really nice lunch
outside a cabin on a mountainside, 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.900
and we went on a
bike ride in the afternoon

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.040
and then we went
white water rafting, 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.060
which was a
bit different. 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.840
It was very wet and
very, very cold, 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.700
and not something that I ever would
have decided to do of my own accord, 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.240
and was also the most fun
that I had on the entire trip, 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.790
which I was
not expecting. 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.450
Honestly, I was just amazed
by how pleased I was 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.530
that someone else had forced me to do
that because it was just the best thing. 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:33.710
Country number
three was Italy. 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:35.320
We stopped off
quickly in Verona, 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.510
which is the setting of
"Romeo and Juliet," 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.640
where they have a Juliet's
balcony and a statue of Juliet, 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.870
where the tradition for some reason is
that you go up to her and you rub her breast. 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.470
So, I did that, obviously. 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:49.590
And then we went
to Venice in Italy, 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.160
which was a very weird place to visit
because it's a sinking city, 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.070
and nobody really
lives there. 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.490
It's very eerily quiet. 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:56.720
But it was also really
weird for me because 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.620
even though I had never
been to Venice before, 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.610
I had this really strange sense of déjà vu
walking around the square

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.400
because some of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood
is set in Venice, the video game. 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.090
And so I walked around thinking,
"I've climbed to the top of that tower," 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.420
and "I think I've killed a
man in that museum." 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:12.980
The next place was
Paris in France,

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.990
which greeted us with a
lovely amount of rain. 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:18.130
We went up the Eiffel Tower even though
it was too foggy to really see anything.

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:19.720
We went to a cabare show
in the evening 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.690
and then, we tried some
snail because, you know, 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.660
that's just what
you do in Paris. 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.680
I don't understand
the appeal.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.640
And our final stop on the trip was
London, England, which is here. 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.330
That's-- That's where
I am right now. 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.510
We ended our trip in our own
dedicated pod on the London Eye, 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.040
and just as our little ride
was coming to an end, 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.860
everybody around me
started singing. 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.790
♪Tonight♪ Yah!

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.240
♪We are young♪

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.020
And once again,
I found myself surprised 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.760
because I gave in and
I sung along with them, 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.700
and not only that,
but I actually enjoyed myself, 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.340
and I don't really know how
I feel about it yet, to be honest. 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.050
Contiki's slogan is
"No regrets,"

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.160
which has never been a phrase that
I've really liked because, to me, 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.780
it only seems one step away from
that kind of YOLO attitude of, 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.740
"Let's make the same mistakes
over and over again 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.380
because we don't want to have to think
about the consequences of our actions."

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:10.950
But I found myself realizing
that "No regrets"

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.440
needn't be used as an
excuse to do stupid things.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.550
It's there as a motivator
to do those things 

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:18.670
that you're not sure if
you'll enjoy or not yet 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:20.250
because you just
haven't tried them, 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.510
and so, although by the end of this trip I was
so exhausted and so happy to be home, 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.940
I didn't regret going
on it in the slightest. 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.160
There you go. 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.700
There's my cheesy ending.

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.840
Sorry. Sorry that
I grew as person. Ugh. 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.010
STEPHEN FRY VOICE: You've just had the almost
imponderable joy of watching charlieissocoollike,

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:42.380
which makes you, like, cool.

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:50.415
RAINING
