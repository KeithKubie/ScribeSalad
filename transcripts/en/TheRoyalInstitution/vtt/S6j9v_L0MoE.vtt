Hi, I'm Natasha.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.639
Today at the Ri we're going to be
doing something we've been

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.380
wanting to do for a really long time.

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:19.120
But it is incredibly dangerous so we had to

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.820
make sure we knew how to do it safely
before we made this video.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.240
And in case you were wondering,
do not try this at home.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.320
Ready...? Burn!

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.940
So we're going to attempt to make
something called Lichtenberg figures.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.920
These are beautiful branching
patterns that you can burn into wood

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.528
using electricity.
The reason why they're so dangerous

00:00:46.528 --> 00:00:51.240
is because if you don't know what you're doing,
the voltages and the currents can kill you.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.950
So no pressure!

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.570
I took apart an old microwave to get the
transformer, again don't try this at home,

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.620
the magnetron in the microwave contains
beryllium oxide powder,

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.000
which is highly toxic, and also the residual charge in the capacitor could always kill you

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.640
if you don't discharge it properly.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.080
This is something that can step up the mains voltage to over 2,000 volts,

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.460
this will then travel along these wires here to these electrodes

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.700
and this is where the magic happens.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.820
So let's see if this works...

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.000
I'm going to wet the wood with some salt
solution, the ions help conduct the

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.780
electricity a little bit better.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.960
Okay so I'm plugging it in, it's potentially live...

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.360
System is live... and burn!

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.980
That worked really well actually!

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.620
And second time... Burn!

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.299
So what's happening here?
We expect wood to be an insulator,

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.780
but we've wetted the surface with a salt
solution which can conduct electricity,

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.100
which completes the circuit between the
two bolts.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.000
This means that current can flow,
and the current heats up the water,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.380
causing it to evaporate.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.020
The electric field is highest
around the points of the bolts

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.080
so this bit heats up first.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:44.060
It gets so hot that the wood starts to burn.
This burning wood produces a kind of

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.000
carbon that can conduct electricity,
a little bit like graphite.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.580
This burnt carbon creates a pathway
where current can flow,

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.740
which means you get even more
resistive heating and even more burning.

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:03.220
So the tendrils are an advancing conductive front,
burning a path for themselves as they go.

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.380
This is what makes the beautiful
branching Lichtenberg patterns.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.220
Once these two fronts meet,
you have a line of burnt wood

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.380
which is quite good at conducting electricity.

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.840
So suddenly you get a lot of current, and
you see that lovely flash.

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.580
Interestingly since we've been
using plywood for this demonstration,

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:31.620
some of the pathways have gone between the plies
and then popped up here and here

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.220
as tendrils on the surface.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.240
So that's it for this video.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.700
I really enjoyed building this
demonstration from scratch

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.360
and seeing the beautiful patterns
being burnt into the wood.

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.020
