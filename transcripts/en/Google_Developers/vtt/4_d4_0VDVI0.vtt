00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.410
FEMALE SPEAKER: Welcome,
welcome, welcome.

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.060
Want to give you a
few words about what

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:13.560
we're doing with this day.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.060
And just so you
know, there's events

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:19.240
like this happening across
the globe at different Google

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.310
locations.

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.436
So this is just one of the big
conversations we're having.

00:00:23.436 --> 00:00:24.810
There's another
in Mountain View,

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.610
and then there's a whole
bunch of local conversations

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.110
that are happening
today everywhere.

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.460
But for International Women's
Day, what we want to celebrate

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.430
is raising the visibility of
technical women, recognizing

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.550
and celebrating
their contributions,

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.650
and then also expanding the
network of women in tech.

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.450
And we know that there
are fewer women taking CS,

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.030
that there are fewer
women in the CS pipeline,

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.880
and that's something we're
really dedicated to changing

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.170
here at Google
because we really see

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.810
not only wanting to grow and
keep the talent we have here

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.540
but also helping to change
the environment for women

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.090
in technology overall.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.970
Hey, all right.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.240
This is actually working.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.730
So diversity, something
I do every day.

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.460
Just a little bit about
diversity at Google-- we really

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.620
prize diversity because we feel
that we can't truly understand

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.520
the experience of our
user if we ourselves

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.950
are not as diverse as
the users that we have.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.170
And so we all know how
diverse Google's users

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.510
are by the faces in this
room and by everyone

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.960
that you're related to and
know who also uses Google.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.380
And so we need to reflect that.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.800
We need to know that we
are really representing

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.080
the needs, the
desires of our user.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.430
So to do that, we're
looking at diversity

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.280
in the work environment.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.980
Diversity's been part of
the conversation at Google

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:58.019
since the beginning.

00:01:58.019 --> 00:01:59.810
It's something we have
always talked about,

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.620
we have always focused
on, we have always

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.140
been conscious about.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.830
One of the things that we
have been doing recently

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.210
to continue this
conversation around diversity

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.289
is work on unconscious bias.

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.690
We know that we all--
everybody have biases.

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.820
And so we've been
talking to our Googlers

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.490
about the science
of this, making

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.550
them aware of what
unconscious bias is

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.610
and the impact that it has.

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.220
To date, 20,000 Googlers have
gone through that training,

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.900
and it's a continuing
conversation

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.700
that we're having all
the time to make sure

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.290
that this is the most
inclusive work environment

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.710
that we can have.

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.260
We also want diversity in
the future of what we create,

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.020
from a technology perspective.

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.850
And so our education,
our scholarship plans,

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.720
are really investing in
the future of technology.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.270
We have Generation
Google scholarships

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:01.950
which look to help high school
seniors and undergrads continue

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.080
their CS and technical studies.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.890
We work very closely
with Anita Borg Institute

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.590
on all of their efforts
around technology

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.370
and around promoting
more women in technology.

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.800
And then we want diversity on
the web and in our products.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.890
So we really want to make
the web work for everyone,

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.530
and we're trying to
make our products more

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:32.670
accessible for small businesses,
for different groups globally.

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.920
So one program is
Women on the Web, which

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.250
is to increase women's
participation in our Google

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.200
business groups and
drive technology-enabled

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.100
entrepreneurship opportunities,
and then also help women become

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.050
successful by leveraging
the power of the internet.

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.090
So we're really
looking at diversity

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.520
from all these
multifaceted perspectives

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.410
to make sure it's happening
internally, externally,

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.440
and that we're growing the
pipeline as we're doing that.

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:11.370
So we really know that women
in the workplace matter.

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.190
And research shows that
when we have more diversity,

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.420
we come back with better ideas.

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:19.380
McKinsey has done
work on this showing

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.490
that when there
are women and men--

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.780
but when we have more
equal numbers of women

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.800
in top management, they
see a greater return

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.030
on their equity
and their earnings.

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.930
Catalyst has done work
to show that if you

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.260
have three women on
a board, it radically

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.360
shifts how that board interacts,
how they make decisions, what

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.400
the outcomes are
for that company.

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.206
We know that having
more diversity

00:04:46.206 --> 00:04:48.080
means we have better
collective intelligence.

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.620
And today, we're talking about
it from a gender perspective,

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.580
but we're thinking
about that broadly too,

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.340
from an age perspective,
from race, ethnicity,

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.540
from sexual orientation-- all
of those pieces come together.

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:02.570
Any kind of diversity
really does impact

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:07.460
and increase the collective
intelligence of the group.

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.120
And also, we see that there's
economic impacts, right?

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.140
We see that when we get those
better products out there,

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.960
we get a better return, and
that's certainly important.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.550
And then last but not least,
right, hearts and minds.

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.680
It's the right thing to do.

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:26.020
We have an increasingly
diverse workforce coming in.

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.610
We know that women
are graduating

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:30.140
at higher rates than
men from colleges.

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:34.090
And so we have to
always be making sure

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:37.439
that we're on the cutting edge
of getting the best talent here

00:05:37.439 --> 00:05:39.480
at Google and making sure
that we're representing

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.810
the talent that's coming in and
the talent that is out there.

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:49.600
So we are hiring
phenomenal women.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:54.030
And not that this is just a
little plug-- we are hiring.

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:55.360
You should apply.

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.400
Just saying.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.424
It's a great place to work.

00:05:59.424 --> 00:06:00.340
But you don't have to.

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:01.230
But you should.

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:02.700
You should.

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:03.350
No pressure.

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:06.930
We'll just keep saying
it throughout the day.

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:08.750
So our goal is to
really change the world.

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.000
And I'll tell you a few other
things that we're doing.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.790
We are looking a K through 12.

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:15.880
We have a very robust program.

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:19.070
We have the RISE Awards
and women at Google

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:21.930
that are working to
encourage more girls

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:23.900
to move into computer science.

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:27.980
We see that some of the biggest
impacts on getting girls

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:30.010
into computer science
is seeing that there

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:33.660
are other women in
computer science

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:35.690
and having them talk
about their experiences.

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:37.231
So we make sure that
that's something

00:06:37.231 --> 00:06:38.560
we're consistently doing.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.010
Again, we have the
university scholarships

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:42.790
through Anita Borg.

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:45.280
We also have Google
Get a Job, which

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.270
is helping women to
study more in CS.

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:50.510
So we're really
making sure that we're

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:54.400
bringing that possible
talent into our sphere.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.930
We know that when
people actually do

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:02.680
come to interview here and when
you come to interview here--

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:06.220
just saying-- that it
makes an impact if you

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:07.950
have an interviewer
who is female.

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:09.990
So we make sure in
all of our interviews

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:14.490
that we have female interviewers
interviewing our candidates

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:17.610
so that there is that more
diverse view from the candidate

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:20.510
perspective.

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:22.440
We also want to
make sure that there

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:24.740
are networking opportunities.

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:28.920
And so we have very, very
robust communities and networks

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:29.610
within Google.

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:34.300
Our Women@Google has
over 4,000 members.

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:36.960
It's very, very active.

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:39.810
We have other groups
for women in tech.

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:42.330
So we're really making
sure that the communities,

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:46.490
that the networking for
women, and for women with men,

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:48.295
are very robust and very active.

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:53.640
Now I get to show
you a fun video.

00:07:58.840 --> 00:09:24.167
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:09:24.167 --> 00:09:25.000
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.419
How cool is that, right?

00:09:28.419 --> 00:09:28.960
You can clap.

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:33.360
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:34.880
OK.

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:36.446
Get this-- there we go.

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:40.420
OK.

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.730
Hey, there we go.

00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:48.800
So this is our
wonderful agenda today.

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:53.322
We're going to be hearing from
some really fantastic women

00:09:53.322 --> 00:09:54.780
technologists who
are going to talk

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:56.550
about different
aspects of their work

00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:58.760
or talk about being
a woman in tech.

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:01.132
And we want to encourage these
to be really interactive,

00:10:01.132 --> 00:10:02.590
so the speakers
are going to speak,

00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:05.180
and then there will be time for
questions at the end of each.

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:07.179
Just a note-- if you're
going to ask a question,

00:10:07.179 --> 00:10:09.150
come up to the mike
so we can hear you.

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:12.410
And we'll just always be
reminding you of that as well.

00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:15.600
We will feed you lunch.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.450
That's nice of us.

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:22.700
And so we will at lunch
have some fun activities

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:23.946
to do as well.

00:10:23.946 --> 00:10:25.570
And then at the end
of the day, there's

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:28.370
a really cool reception, and
we have these cool little Spiro

00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:29.765
balls which I'm just--

00:10:29.765 --> 00:10:30.640
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:30.930
FEMALE SPEAKER: Right?

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:31.860
AUDIENCE: They're awesome.

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:32.960
FEMALE SPEAKER: I know, right?

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:33.459
I know.

00:10:33.459 --> 00:10:34.810
I just learned about them.

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:37.550
And the fact that I could
potentially program something

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:38.520
is kind of amazing.

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:41.600
So we'll be able to play
with those at the reception.

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.420
So if that doesn't
keep you here,

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:44.670
we'll think of something else.

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:46.070
But that should keep you here.

00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:47.957
I'm just saying.

00:10:47.957 --> 00:10:50.040
Just to give you a sense
of the other events going

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:56.790
on globally-- pretty
amazing, and, frankly,

00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:58.090
really impressive.

00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:01.790
We had a lot of people who were
super excited about this day

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:03.960
and super excited to
put on different events.

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:08.060
And so we're excited that you're
a part of the New York event.
