00:00:00.306 --> 00:00:01.850
- [Voiceover] We've already
talked about the notion

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:04.021
that a water molecule has polarity to it.

00:00:04.021 --> 00:00:06.227
One end has a partially negative charge,

00:00:06.227 --> 00:00:09.222
and the other end has
partially positive charges.

00:00:09.222 --> 00:00:11.683
And we've talked about how
this leads to hydrogen bonds,

00:00:11.683 --> 00:00:13.099
and we alluded to the fact

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:14.701
that maybe these hydrogen bonds

00:00:14.701 --> 00:00:16.942
give us all sorts of
neat properties of water.

00:00:16.942 --> 00:00:18.207
And what I want to talk
about in this video

00:00:18.207 --> 00:00:21.086
is one of those very important properties,

00:00:21.086 --> 00:00:25.614
and that's water's ability to be a solvent

00:00:25.614 --> 00:00:29.081
Water's ability to be a solvent.

00:00:29.081 --> 00:00:31.542
And this means that it's
easy for certain things

00:00:31.542 --> 00:00:33.748
to be dissolved inside of water.

00:00:33.748 --> 00:00:34.769
And that's super important,

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:36.650
because that's how a lot
of the chemistry occurs,

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.380
by things getting dissolved in water

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.363
and then interacting and
bumping with other things.

00:00:41.363 --> 00:00:43.279
And this is actually what's
happening inside of cells,

00:00:43.279 --> 00:00:44.440
in the cytoplasm.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.704
The cytoplasm, which is mostly water,

00:00:46.704 --> 00:00:49.269
is a solvent which allows
a bunch of interactions

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:51.765
to happen between different
types of molecules.

00:00:51.765 --> 00:00:55.283
But let's think about why
water is a good solvent,

00:00:55.283 --> 00:00:58.498
and what types of things
it can dissolve easily

00:00:58.498 --> 00:00:59.961
and what types of things it might not

00:00:59.961 --> 00:01:02.469
be able to dissolve so easily.

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:05.847
So the key feature that
makes water a good solvent,

00:01:05.847 --> 00:01:08.900
or at least a good solvent for
a large class of molecules,

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.301
is its polarity.

00:01:12.301 --> 00:01:15.842
If I were to take some sodium chloride,

00:01:15.842 --> 00:01:18.036
often known as table salt,

00:01:18.036 --> 00:01:19.116
so let me...

00:01:19.116 --> 00:01:24.116
So if I were to take sodium
NaCl, sodium chloride.

00:01:24.282 --> 00:01:26.557
Sodium chloride, the sodium and chloride

00:01:26.557 --> 00:01:28.461
are attracted by ionic bonds.

00:01:28.461 --> 00:01:30.945
The sodium right over here
has a positive charge,

00:01:30.945 --> 00:01:33.615
it has an electron stripped from it,

00:01:33.615 --> 00:01:35.902
and the chloride has a--

00:01:35.902 --> 00:01:39.230
let me write that in a different color.

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.053
So the sodium has a positive charge,

00:01:41.053 --> 00:01:42.846
because it has an
electron stripped from it,

00:01:42.846 --> 00:01:45.452
and the chloride, it is an anion,

00:01:45.452 --> 00:01:48.224
it has a negative, it is
a negatively charged ion,

00:01:48.224 --> 00:01:51.428
because it gains an extra electron.

00:01:51.428 --> 00:01:52.624
But they are attracted to each other.

00:01:52.624 --> 00:01:54.980
This has a positive charge,
this has a negative charge.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.919
This is called an ionic bond.

00:01:56.919 --> 00:01:59.241
But if you put sodium chloride in water,

00:01:59.241 --> 00:02:00.564
something very interesting happens.

00:02:00.564 --> 00:02:01.888
This is something that
we've all experienced.

00:02:01.888 --> 00:02:04.964
Take some table salt and put it in water

00:02:04.964 --> 00:02:06.067
and see what happens.

00:02:06.067 --> 00:02:07.739
It will dissolve.

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:09.201
And why does it dissolve?

00:02:09.201 --> 00:02:11.808
Well, let's draw it out.

00:02:12.301 --> 00:02:14.805
So this is the sodium right over here.

00:02:14.805 --> 00:02:16.324
So that's the sodium.

00:02:16.324 --> 00:02:18.553
It has a positive charge.

00:02:18.553 --> 00:02:20.991
It has a positive charge.

00:02:20.991 --> 00:02:25.402
And then this is the
chloride right over here.

00:02:25.402 --> 00:02:27.225
It has a negative charge.

00:02:27.225 --> 00:02:30.882
What's gonna happen if you
put it inside of the water?

00:02:30.882 --> 00:02:33.041
Let me do that negative
charge in the green.

00:02:33.041 --> 00:02:36.570
What's gonna happen when
you put it inside of water.

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:37.987
Well, you can imagine.

00:02:37.987 --> 00:02:39.948
The negative ends of the water molecules

00:02:39.948 --> 00:02:43.663
are going to be attracted
to the sodium ion.

00:02:43.663 --> 00:02:46.380
So it's going to look something like this.

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.760
So you have the oxygen,

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.264
oxygen, oxygen, oxygen, oxygen,

00:02:53.264 --> 00:02:54.843
I'm clearly not drawing things to scale,

00:02:54.843 --> 00:02:56.468
but this'll just give you the idea.

00:02:56.468 --> 00:02:58.662
This end of the water molecule

00:02:58.662 --> 00:03:01.460
all has a partially negative charge.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:02.923
Partially negative charge.

00:03:02.923 --> 00:03:06.545
So it's going to be attracted
to the positive sodium ion.

00:03:06.545 --> 00:03:09.041
And then the hydrogen ends,

00:03:09.041 --> 00:03:10.469
the hydrogen ends,

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:12.686
are going to have a
partial positive charge,

00:03:12.686 --> 00:03:14.601
and then they're going to be repelled.

00:03:14.601 --> 00:03:19.601
They are going to be repelled
from the positive sodium ion.

00:03:20.355 --> 00:03:22.760
So it's gonna look something like this.

00:03:23.195 --> 00:03:26.039
And it's gonna look something like this.

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:29.087
And you're gonna have
partial positive charge

00:03:29.087 --> 00:03:31.050
on the outside.

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.755
Partial positive charge on the outside.

00:03:33.755 --> 00:03:35.636
And now these hydrogens over here,

00:03:35.636 --> 00:03:37.249
this will just interact with water

00:03:37.249 --> 00:03:38.991
the way that it would typically,

00:03:38.991 --> 00:03:40.407
with the hydrogen bonding,

00:03:40.407 --> 00:03:42.950
the molecules just
flowing past each other.

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.072
So the fact that the sodium ion here,

00:03:46.072 --> 00:03:48.626
it's an ion, it has charge.

00:03:48.626 --> 00:03:51.970
It is able to dissolve
in the water very easily,

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.953
because it is attracted to
the partially negative ends

00:03:54.953 --> 00:03:56.428
of the water molecule.

00:03:56.428 --> 00:03:57.867
Now, a similar thing is going to happen

00:03:57.867 --> 00:04:00.653
with the chloride ion.

00:04:00.653 --> 00:04:03.149
And we call a negative ion an anion.

00:04:03.149 --> 00:04:05.192
So over here, over here,

00:04:05.192 --> 00:04:07.212
and actually let me get some,

00:04:07.212 --> 00:04:08.965
let me move it over a little bit

00:04:08.965 --> 00:04:10.776
so that I have some space.

00:04:10.776 --> 00:04:13.616
So the chloride anion,

00:04:13.616 --> 00:04:16.851
let me move it over a little bit.

00:04:16.851 --> 00:04:21.310
So right, or maybe I'll move it over here.

00:04:22.256 --> 00:04:24.539
So the chloride,

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:26.094
the chloride anion,

00:04:26.094 --> 00:04:28.834
let me see, I'm having trouble
with my selection tool.

00:04:28.834 --> 00:04:30.993
Alright. So there we go.

00:04:30.993 --> 00:04:33.257
The chloride anion has a negative charge

00:04:33.257 --> 00:04:36.310
that's going to be attracted
to the positive end

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:37.912
of the water molecules.

00:04:37.912 --> 00:04:40.199
So you could imagine something like this.

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:42.997
So the hydrogen ends, the hydrogen ends,

00:04:42.997 --> 00:04:44.518
are going to be attracted to it,

00:04:44.518 --> 00:04:47.060
they have a partially positive charge.

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.649
They have a partially positive charge.

00:04:49.649 --> 00:04:51.448
And of course you have the oxygen end

00:04:51.448 --> 00:04:53.735
that has a partially negative charge.

00:04:53.735 --> 00:04:55.593
It has a partially negative charge.

00:04:55.593 --> 00:04:58.077
And I could draw more of these.

00:04:58.077 --> 00:04:59.830
Hydrogen, hydrogen,

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:00.910
attracted there,

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.057
you have the oxygen over,

00:05:03.057 --> 00:05:06.494
let me do that, I wanna
keep my colors consistent.

00:05:06.494 --> 00:05:08.374
The oxygen right over there,

00:05:08.374 --> 00:05:09.593
we have the hydrogen,

00:05:09.593 --> 00:05:11.648
once again this isn't drawn to scale.

00:05:11.648 --> 00:05:15.607
Hydrogen, it is bonded to the oxygen.

00:05:15.607 --> 00:05:17.708
And so once again, you can form this,

00:05:17.708 --> 00:05:21.017
so you could almost imagine
this shell of water molecules

00:05:21.017 --> 00:05:22.375
is going to be attracted to it,

00:05:22.375 --> 00:05:25.707
it's going to be attracted,
or I guess you could say

00:05:25.707 --> 00:05:28.307
the partially positive end,

00:05:28.307 --> 00:05:30.687
which is where the hydrogen atoms are,

00:05:30.687 --> 00:05:33.392
is what's going to be
attracted to this negative ion.

00:05:33.392 --> 00:05:35.632
So this is partial positive over here.

00:05:35.632 --> 00:05:37.014
And then on the partially negative side,

00:05:37.014 --> 00:05:38.732
outside of this shell,

00:05:38.732 --> 00:05:40.311
you can imagine it's just
gonna interact with the water

00:05:40.311 --> 00:05:42.110
just the way any water molecule would,

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.885
and so it's gonna be
able to flow very easily.

00:05:44.885 --> 00:05:47.032
So you probably see
something interesting here.

00:05:47.032 --> 00:05:48.425
If something has charge,

00:05:48.425 --> 00:05:50.387
if it's an ion,

00:05:50.387 --> 00:05:52.407
or if something has some polarity,

00:05:52.407 --> 00:05:55.913
it's very easy to dissolve
it inside of water.

00:05:55.913 --> 00:05:59.233
And in this case, and just to
have some terminology here,

00:05:59.233 --> 00:06:02.403
in this case, water is the,

00:06:02.403 --> 00:06:05.073
water is the solvent,

00:06:05.073 --> 00:06:07.487
so water is the solvent.

00:06:07.487 --> 00:06:09.763
So the solvent is water.

00:06:09.763 --> 00:06:12.352
And the thing that's being
dissolved in the water,

00:06:12.352 --> 00:06:14.386
we call that a solute.

00:06:14.937 --> 00:06:17.920
So we call this the solute.

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.383
So the sodium chloride.

00:06:19.383 --> 00:06:23.260
That is, you could use
sodium chloride as a solute,

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.557
or you could say that the
sodium ions are a solute

00:06:26.557 --> 00:06:29.715
and so are the chloride ions.

00:06:29.715 --> 00:06:34.715
That is also considered to be the solute.

00:06:34.916 --> 00:06:36.912
And so you say, well what
kind of things dissolve well?

00:06:36.912 --> 00:06:39.292
Well, things that that have
charge or that are polar.

00:06:39.292 --> 00:06:40.813
And things that are charged and polar

00:06:40.813 --> 00:06:42.520
and tend to dissolve well in water,

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.191
there's another word we use for them.

00:06:44.191 --> 00:06:46.780
We say that they are hydrophilic.

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:51.780
So we could say that this
right over here is hydrophilic.

00:06:52.603 --> 00:06:54.136
And if you look at the word root,

00:06:54.136 --> 00:06:56.748
hydro is referring to water.

00:06:56.748 --> 00:07:00.068
So hydro is referring to water.

00:07:00.068 --> 00:07:01.496
And philic means loving.

00:07:01.496 --> 00:07:04.236
So this literally means water loving.

00:07:04.236 --> 00:07:07.010
Water loving.

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:08.717
Hydrophilic.

00:07:08.717 --> 00:07:09.994
And so you might be asking, okay,

00:07:09.994 --> 00:07:10.969
everything we've talked about,

00:07:10.969 --> 00:07:12.408
you know, we've seen water molecules,

00:07:12.408 --> 00:07:15.287
that's polar, we're
looking at charged ions,

00:07:15.287 --> 00:07:16.309
okay we could get that,

00:07:16.309 --> 00:07:18.050
we can get why they'd be hydrophilic,

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:20.511
they can incorporate
themselves well into the water,

00:07:20.511 --> 00:07:21.626
but what are examples of things

00:07:21.626 --> 00:07:24.551
that would not incorporate
themselves well in water?

00:07:24.551 --> 00:07:26.490
Well, in general, things
that don't have charge,

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:29.009
or that aren't polar, aren't
going to be able to dissolve

00:07:29.009 --> 00:07:30.634
in water all that well.

00:07:30.634 --> 00:07:33.072
And a good example is hydrocarbons.

00:07:33.072 --> 00:07:34.674
So if you took some hexane.

00:07:34.674 --> 00:07:38.106
And hexane is a major
constituent of car gasoline.

00:07:38.106 --> 00:07:42.007
So hexane, hex the
prefix means six carbons.

00:07:42.007 --> 00:07:43.378
So let's see, one,

00:07:43.378 --> 00:07:45.588
let me do this in another color.

00:07:45.588 --> 00:07:50.429
So we have one, two, three,

00:07:50.429 --> 00:07:54.968
four, five, six carbons.

00:07:54.968 --> 00:07:57.488
So one two three four five six carbons.

00:07:57.488 --> 00:08:01.667
And then all the other
bonds are with hydrogens.

00:08:01.667 --> 00:08:05.486
So let me draw this as well as I can.

00:08:05.486 --> 00:08:09.504
Carbon, at least typically,
forms four bonds.

00:08:09.504 --> 00:08:14.504
So hydrogen, hydrogen, hydrogen, hydrogen,

00:08:14.631 --> 00:08:18.269
hydrogen, hydrogen, hydrogen.

00:08:18.269 --> 00:08:20.974
This right over here is hexane.

00:08:20.974 --> 00:08:23.354
This thing has no polarity to it.

00:08:23.354 --> 00:08:24.805
It doesn't form hydrogen bonds,

00:08:24.805 --> 00:08:26.244
it doesn't have any polarity.

00:08:26.244 --> 00:08:28.009
And so if you were to take hexane

00:08:28.009 --> 00:08:29.449
and throw it into water,

00:08:29.449 --> 00:08:31.248
it's not going to dissolve that well.

00:08:31.248 --> 00:08:33.071
It's actually going to kind bead up.

00:08:33.071 --> 00:08:34.649
And you would see that
if you actually threw

00:08:34.649 --> 00:08:36.669
some gasoline inside of water.

00:08:36.669 --> 00:08:40.651
So things like hexane we
would call hydrophobic.

00:08:40.651 --> 00:08:42.485
Hydrophobic.

00:08:42.485 --> 00:08:47.222
So this right over here is hydrophobic.

00:08:47.222 --> 00:08:48.011
Hydrophobic.

00:08:48.011 --> 00:08:50.368
It'll literally ball up
to avoid getting in touch,

00:08:50.368 --> 00:08:52.109
to minimize its contact with water.

00:08:52.109 --> 00:08:53.885
Because the water is attracted to itself,

00:08:53.885 --> 00:08:56.509
and it is not so attracted to
this stuff right over here.

00:08:56.509 --> 00:08:57.682
And hydrophobic?

00:08:57.682 --> 00:08:59.423
You still have hydro, meaning water,

00:08:59.423 --> 00:09:01.745
and then phobic, it means fearing.

00:09:01.745 --> 00:09:03.509
So this right over here is water fearing.

00:09:03.509 --> 00:09:07.120
That's why it's hard to mix
things like water and oil

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:09.738
or gasoline and water.
