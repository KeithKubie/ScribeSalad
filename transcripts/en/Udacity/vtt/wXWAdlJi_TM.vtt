Since between group variability deals with the variability between groups,

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.342
obviously, then we're concerned with the number of groups we have. There are

00:00:10.342 --> 00:00:14.186
three groups, and the degrees of freedom is then 2. For within group

00:00:14.186 --> 00:00:20.636
variability, we add the degrees of freedom from every group. 2 plus 2 plus 2,

00:00:20.636 --> 00:00:23.405
which is 6.
