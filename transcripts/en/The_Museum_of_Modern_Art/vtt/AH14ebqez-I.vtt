00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.760
Yvonne: Well, I can say right off the bat
that I came into this situation with certain

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:21.180
reservations about performing during the day
in this huge space with this constant buzz

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:29.600
of museum-goers, but I resigned myself to
it and I thought it was a very good situation.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.100
Ana: People were pretty focused, somehow.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.600
Yvonne: Yeah, look.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.120
Pat: And also, they don't know they're gonna
stand there for five minutes.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.180
They're waiting to see what happens so they're
attentive.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.420
Patricia: Do you direct them to be dead serious
or…?

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.200
Yvonne: Yeah, yeah.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.760
I didn't tell them not to blink or, you know…

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:58.950
Patricia: Smile but not to smile.

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.080
Yvonne: It's an individual matter how you
stand still.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:03.700
Patricia: They have to count?

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.300
Yvonne: No but they have music to…

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.300
Pat: No, they know the music.

00:01:06.309 --> 00:01:10.420
They recognize the shift in the music when
they are to begin to run which is…

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.760
The shift in the music starts in about 10
seconds.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.420
Ana: You both did it, no?

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.020
Patricia: I've never done it before.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.760
Ana: You never did it? No?

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:27.700
Patricia: Never done it, no.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:28.860
Yvonne: I've done it.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:31.960
Patricia: Really?

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.700
Pat: But you did it barefoot.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:35.819
That's what interested me.

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.360
Yvonne: Yeah, that was the difference.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.539
Pat: The most important thing is to keep the
shape of the clump.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.139
Patricia: But the individuals inside can't
move.

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:44.209
Pat: Can't move around.

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:47.640
They sometimes have to position themselves
that they have a breakaway.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.980
There he broke away really easily right there,
but sometimes it was awkward.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.500
Patricia: Well, every time they came back
into the dressing room when we were warming up…

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.180
…they would be, like, you know,
all the difficulties of navigating that space.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.340
Pat: They should be closer together.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.640
Yvonne: See, now here they should be…

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.560
Pat: They're too spread out.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.800
Yvonne: …closer together.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.260
Patricia: Whatever were they thinking?

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.060
Yvonne: Come on.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.320
Get together.

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.540
Pat: Well, it's hard, in a way, to run when
you're in the center because you're just kind of

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.800
going around yourself.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:25.080
Pat: Now these two people, I taught this to them
in Dublin because they were dancers I chose

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.200
for Yvonne's performance at the Irish Museum
of Modern Art.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.820
Thomas: Do you think it makes any difference
whether the dancers are people you know or

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:35.980
don't know?

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.080
Like, back in the day, these were folks that
you were working with and you knew their work.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.940
I'm just wondering, like, in terms of how
close you get or how far you get.

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:50.460
Yvonne: My own group I've been working with
some of you since 2000…

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:51.880
Pat: 1999, 2000.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:52.800
Yvonne: Well, Pat...

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.860
Pat: Me forever but...

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.100
Ana: 1931.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:56.640
Pat: Yeah, just about.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:02.860
Yvonne: With new people, yeah, it's a different
situation, yeah, in my experience.

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.820
Pat, what's yours?

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.819
Pat: Well, it is like you have to kind of
get used to what kind of instructions people

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:12.379
respond to and what kind of instructions they
don't get.

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:17.160
Patricia: Like Mary Kate, I would've
never thought that she would be a Trio A-er.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.040
Yvonne: Why?

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.660
Patricia: Because of her training.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:26.380
She performs in more presentational kinds
of works/choreographers, but she did so great.

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:33.900
Pat: She grasped details of performance and
gesture immediately and retains it.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.180
Patricia: She had, like, an athletic energy…

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.040
Pat: Yeah, she has an athleticism that's really
beautiful.

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.100
Patricia: …that was so fantastic to see
it.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.060
Pat: Here comes the star.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.480
Patricia: Everybody talked about this coat
to me.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.540
Yvonne: Why?

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.320
Patricia: Like, is this character from a French
film?

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.560
Yvonne: Why a French film?

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:54.460
Patricia: I have no idea.

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:57.520
Because it's elegant, it's minimalist, it's...?

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.440
Yvonne: What does that have to do with French
film?

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:08.000
Patricia: I think there was something communicated
by the costume more this time than ever before

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.300
Yvonne: Oh, oh.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.400
Patricia: ...that she was in a train station or something,
you know, running to catch the train.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.560
Like, that was a whole narrative that never
we've had there before.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.800
Yvonne: Well, the other weird thing is you're
not allowed to take your hands out of your

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.280
pockets.

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.160
You have to get up…

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:29.200
Patricia: I mean it's hard to run, like, in
bare feet and all. But...

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.760
I really got in shape.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.400
People applauded the running.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.880
Yvonne: They thought it was over.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.560
Yvonne: Oh, I love this part.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.080
Patricia: You taught me.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.280
You taught me everything I know.

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.240
Pat: That smile is particularly bizarre.

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.000
Patricia: I mean I've been doing this for
10, 12 years, 15 years.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.720
I remember the first day that you came to
the…it was, like, 2001.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.000
She was looking for somebody who could scream.

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:41.560
Yvonne: In a theatrical setting, she would
get up and…

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:43.560
Yeah...

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:50.400
...and as she turns her head to the left, the lights fade to black.

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:57.200
So, I think I gave you special instructions,
milk it.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.080
Patricia: Use it. Take your time, yeah.

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.720
Yvonne: Take your time, yeah.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.280
Patricia: And that was, like, the hardest
part to…

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.920
Pat: The hardest thing to do, I would think,
yeah.

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.740
Patricia: And because I would see every single
person in the audience.

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:08.320
I would cry.

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.120
Yvonne: Oh, this is beautiful.

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:12.020
Oh, my God.

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:14.560
Oh, my God.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.560
It's great as a closeup.

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:19.160
Pat: It's beautiful.

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:32.540
Yvonne: I was involved in repetition at that
time and randomness.

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:38.660
Yeah, it's not choreographed the overall structure.

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:40.880
Each movement has a number.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:41.820
Pat: Or a letter.

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:43.020
Yvonne: Or a letter.

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:44.600
Patricia: And anybody can call it.

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:50.880
Yvonne: If you want to change a diagonal,
you tap someone and go on a different diagonal.

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:52.680
Pat: This is six.

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:58.540
She's doing nine, which nobody likes to do.

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:00.080
She got abandoned.

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:02.300
This is C.

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:03.860
Yvonne: It's a two

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:04.800
Pat: It's a C.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:08.600
Patricia: So now David just touched Emily
and they changed directions.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.640
Yvonne: Yeah, and they'd go to a different
corner.

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:14.340
Patricia: And you have to stay moving like
that in the corner.

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:17.140
Yvonne: You do this treading motion.

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:18.640
Ana: And what are you doing, Pat?

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.440
Pat: I'm doing random walking.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.960
Patricia: What you see is what you get.

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:27.160
Pat: I just did D3, I think.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:32.360
And I stopped still which you can do in the
random walking, but you can't move again unless

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:33.920
someone jostles you.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:34.800
Here comes, Ms. Yvonne.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.520
Patricia: We didn't know Yvonne was coming
in.

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:38.080
Ana: You didn't?

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:38.860
Patricia: No.

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:39.680
Yvonne: No, this is the first time.

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.380
I just came in and stood.

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:44.280
Patricia: Everybody's smiling because we're
like, "What is Yvonne doing here?"

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.720
Pat: When she started coming out, I thought, "Oh,
she's going to come out and tell us

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:49.200
we're doing something wrong."

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:54.040
Patricia: Like, in the middle of the performance,
Yvonne would be like, "I don't know what three is".

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.940
So we would have to do, like, a quick…

00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:57.540
Ana: Update.

00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:58.740
Patricia: Update, yeah.

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:01.640
Oh, Yvonne, now you joined the group.

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:03.560
Pat: Eight. That was eight.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:06.340
Yvonne: That's enough of that.

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:10.940
Patricia: The privileges of the boss, you
go in and out when you want.

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:13.420
Yvonne: Now I'm in the group.

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:15.720
Pat: Raise your head, Yvonne.

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.920
Why are you looking at the floor?

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:20.800
Patricia: It's really hard to watch yourself.

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.660
Yvonne: Oh, dear.

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:26.420
Pat: Three, this is three.

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:29.740
Patricia: "Okay, forget it."

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:30.880
Pat: "I'm over that."

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:32.480
Yvonne: I'm not going to do that.

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:38.360
Yvonne: What am I doing?

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:39.480
Pat: Getting us to come out.

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:41.680
Patricia: And she's out there by herself.

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:42.960
It's like, "Come on out."

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:46.600
Pat: But when we were done, I mean we were
all performing at age a hundred twice

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:47.440
a day.

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:52.320
So we were like, "Okay, we're done," but at
the same time, it felt like it was just the

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.560
beginning like there was something happening.

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:58.240
Yvonne: What am I going to do?

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.800
What do you want from me?

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:05.120
Patricia: You were happy.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:06.400
Yvonne: Of course.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:07.440
Patricia: You were so happy.

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:08.440
Yvonne: Yeah, I was very happy.

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:09.480
Yeah.

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:14.080
[applause]
