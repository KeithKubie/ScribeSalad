No movie universe has shaped young minds or
found a place in kids’ hearts like the decades

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.420
of Disney’s animated adventures. So it’s
no surprise that fans have spent time and

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.369
energy trying to prove that every film connects
to those around it, sometimes looking a bit

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:26.269
too closely at a random easter egg. With the
surprise success of Disney’s Frozen, fans

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:30.279
have come up with a theory that is out of
this world, claiming another Disney hero is

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:35.649
a long lost sibling of the starring sisters.
With Disney keeping quiet on any official

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:40.430
canon, the theories are all in the name of
fun, and using a bit more imagination in between

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.750
releases. We’ve done our best to lay out
the theories that work – and the ones that

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.440
don’t – in our first Docu Series exploring
The Secret Family Relations Between Disney

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.340
Movie Princesses.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.489
Frozen IN-Tangled

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:59.059
By now, every Disney fan knows where this
theory starts: with a single split-second

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:04.409
cameo from two other Disney stars. But before
we get to Queen Elsa’s coronation, we’ll

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.740
have to explain why the throne is empty in
the first place. It’s nothing new for a

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.630
Disney hero to be without their parents, so
seeing the King and Queen of Arendelle leave

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:19.100
the picture was less than shocking. That doesn’t
make it any less tragic, with Anna and Elsa

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.490
bidding farewell as their parents head out
to sea for a two week roundtrip journey.

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.140
The ship is lost at sea, leaving the girls
without their parents – and Arendelle without

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:34.310
a monarch. After three years Elsa is old enough
to claim the crown, and the entire kingdom

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.979
and visitors from far-off lands show up to
celebrate. The doors are opened, and Anna

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:44.509
heads out to greet the guests – two of which
are instantly recognizable. Rapunzel and Flynn

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:50.399
Rider, the stars of Tangled are impossible
to miss, thanks to their hairstyles and clothing.

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.040
It might seem like a tiny easter egg, but
it got fans thinking: Frozen would have to

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.759
be set after the events of Tangled for the
cameo to make sense – so perhaps the two

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.060
movies are more connected than they seem…

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.250
Fans have spun some wild theories, claiming
Rapunzel and Elsa’s mothers look alike because

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.220
they’re sisters, married to the kings of
two different kingdoms. One daughter is born

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.890
with the gift of healing thanks to a magical
flower, while the other is born with control

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.830
of icy magic. It’s impossible to actually
prove the princess is there to see her cousin’s

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.099
coronation… but Arendelle should have sent
someone to celebrate Rapunzel’s return home,

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:30.080
and wedding. Like, say, the King and Queen?

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.330
Unfortunately, Frozen never explains where
the Royal Couple is headed, or why – only

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.370
that their ship sinks on the way. But using
the countries that the fictional kingdoms

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.920
of Frozen and Tangled were based on takes
this theory even farther. Disney’s animators

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.090
took a trip to Norway to help create the mountainy
kingdom of Arendelle, and Rapunzel’s home

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.890
of Corona is likely inspired by 18th Century
Germany, the same place the Brothers Grimm

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:02.180
wrote their famous version of the story. That
would put the two films on opposite sides

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.379
of the North Sea – with the ship being sunk
somewhere off the coast of Denmark. Why does

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:08.379
that matter?

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:13.450
Well, no Disney movie is explicitly set in
a Danish kingdom, but one of the studio’s

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:19.030
most beloved classics was written by a Danish
citizen – a fact that takes this theory

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.390
into time-bending, shared universe territory.

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:24.930
The Little Mermaid

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.450
The writer in question is Hans Christian Andersen,
whose version of The Little Mermaid was a

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.530
bit darker than Disney’s version. But some
have claimed that the movie actually ties

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:41.920
into Frozen directly, with the shipwreck explored
by Ariel in the opening scenes the exact ship

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.379
that Elsa’s parents died on. The theory
can lose some steam with that twist, since

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:53.030
it’s… a bit of a reach. But the biggest
problem is the climate: Andersen also wrote

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.319
“The Snow Queen,” which Frozen was based
on. And that’s a better fit for the North

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:01.360
Sea than a story filled with tropical fish
and sandy beaches.

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.760
But don’t worry, conspiracy fans, the shipwreck
in The Little Mermaid can still come from

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:11.069
Arendelle – it’s just nowhere near Denmark,
or the North Sea. When the directors of Frozen

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:16.759
were asked point blank about Elsa’s parents’
destination on Reddit, they gave direct answers.

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:21.570
Jennifer Lee said it was a wedding, with Chris
Buck clarifying that the King and Queen didn’t

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:26.750
die on the ship at all. In fact, it didn’t
even sink. The ship, and the couple, survived

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:32.180
weeks, possibly even months lost at sea…
until they washed up on a jungle shore, and

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.500
had to build a home next to a family of gorillas.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:37.500
Tarzan

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:42.199
That’s right, according to Buck, the King
and Queen of Arendelle were the shipwrecked

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:45.585
parents of the boy who would grow up to be
Tarzan. They also learned the lesson that

00:04:45.585 --> 00:04:46.585
traveling at sea when you don’t know you’ve
got a baby on the way isn’t wise:

00:04:46.585 --> 00:04:48.400
“They get shipwrecked, and somehow they
really washed way far away from the Scandinavian

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.940
waters, and they end up in the jungle. They
end up building a tree house and a leopard

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.130
kills them, so their baby boy is raised by
gorillas.” (Reddit)

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.370
So the storm didn’t sink the ship, it just
tossed it out into the Atlantic, to travel

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:06.600
south to Africa before bursting into flames
and sinking – something that happens pretty

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.669
often in Disney’s universe. That might be
a hard trip to believe, but in a world of

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:18.060
ape men and magical attacks, a storm being
really powerful is actually easy to believe.

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:23.449
Just to be clear, weird family relations in
the Tarzan story aren’t anything new, either.

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:28.000
In the original version of the story, Tarzan’s
real name would have been John Clayton – a

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.150
cousin of the movie’s villain. Frankly,
we’re all for a different explanation.

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.470
There are still a few problems with the theory,
but it’s what director Chris Buck believes

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:42.690
happened – and since he also directed Tarzan,
he’s kind of an authority on the subject.

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:48.539
It’s still an unhappy ending for the King
and Queen, but Elsa and Anna’s brother finds

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:53.220
a family and happiness of his own. Even if
the details don’t match up, it’s what

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.960
the director believes is the true story.

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.380
As for the wrecked ship?

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.900
For those who love the idea of Ariel investigating
it, who’s to say it couldn’t drift a bit

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.090
farther before sinking?

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:08.220
After all, there’s another hint that these
locations aren’t as far apart as you might

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.350
think.

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:12.060
The Cinderella Factor

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:18.009
To prove that these Disney kings, queen, princes
and princesses really do share the same social

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:23.720
circles, fans can watch when Prince Eric is
almost duped into marrying the wrong woman

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:29.120
in The Little Mermaid. A split second shot
shows the King and Duke from Cinderella, having

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:33.710
traveled to see the Royal Wedding. And when
the doors to Arendelle’s castle are opened,

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:38.009
the first few frames feature a woman sharing
more than a passing resemblance to Sleeping

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:42.509
Beauty’s Princess Aurora AND The Princess
and The Frog’s Princess Tiana. With all

00:06:42.509 --> 00:06:47.069
those details, it’s hard to believe Elsa’s
parents WEREN’T headed to the wedding of

00:06:47.069 --> 00:06:48.949
another Disney princess.

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:53.650
It isn’t likely that Disney will ever confirm
or deny any official connections, and in the

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:58.169
end, they don’t really need to. Since the
characters aren’t likely to ever meet, it’s

00:06:58.169 --> 00:07:03.340
enough to know that in the mind that helped
to create Tarzan and Frozen, Anna and Elsa’s

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:08.960
long lost brother in a far away land was the
King of the Jungle. The ship that got him

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:15.300
there… well, that’s just for fans to do
what Disney is all about: use their imagination.

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:19.940
To summarize everything, the theory claims
that Elsa and Anna are actually the sisters

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:24.970
of Tarzan, since their parents lived long
enough to deliver him as a baby to the gorillas

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:26.530
who raised him.

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:31.270
A part of their ship kept on drifting until
it came to rest on the ocean floor, where

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:36.419
Ariel eventually explored it for trinkets.
The rest would eb used to build a treehouse…

00:07:36.419 --> 00:07:40.490
She would marry Prince Eric not long after
- a prince who was apparently close enough

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:45.680
to Cinderella's family to have her father
the King, and his right hand man the Grand

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:47.509
Duke at the wedding.

00:07:47.509 --> 00:07:52.020
Disney royalty apparently make a point of
attending other royal weddings, and Frozen's

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:56.849
director confirms the King and Queen of Arendelle
were headed to one when they disappeared.

00:07:56.849 --> 00:08:00.590
It could have been Cinderella's wedding to
Prince Charming, Aurora's wedding to Prince

00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:05.660
Phillip, or even Tiana's wedding to Prince
Naveen, since they're both shown arriving

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:07.330
for Elsa's coronation.

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:12.090
But if the Queen of Arendelle really was the
sister of Rapunzel's mother, or they're just

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:16.210
neighboring queens, it's a safe bet they were
headed to Rapunzel's wedding to Flynn Rider

00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:21.520
when they disappeared. Not one to forget such
a sacrifice, Rapunzel and Flynn made sure

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:24.539
to see Elsa's coronation in person.

00:08:24.539 --> 00:08:29.910
It's not as complicated as it may sound, if
fans realize that the characters may be familiar,

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:35.450
or even friendly, with stars of other classic
movies. Which all lead to one big question:

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:38.769
are all Disney films part of the same shared
universe?

00:08:38.769 --> 00:08:46.440
They may never give a clear answer, so until
then, let us know what YOU think!
