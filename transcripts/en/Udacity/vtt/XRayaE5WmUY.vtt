00:01:06.822 --> 00:01:11.130
As fun as that clip was to watch, it was ten times more fun to make.

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.340
We did a silent film because the Canvas is a visual-only medium that

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.020
doesn't provide sound.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.850
When we were brainstorming this project, we had to figure out how to

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.060
do things typically done in video editing software, in the Canvas.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.230
We accomplished this by using a combination of tutorials we found online,

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.700
source code, sometimes in other programming languages, that we converted to

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.420
JavaScript, and other times, a description of the thing that we wanted to do.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.330
We don't have the time to teach you all of the effects we did, but

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.480
we'll give you some pointers in this lesson.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.480
