00:00:25.307 --> 00:00:27.890
(gentle music)

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.300
- As you know from the program

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.460
and just from general knowledge,

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.720
these lectures were established in 1976

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.030
by colleagues, joined by friends, family,

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.900
and students to commemorate
the contributions

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.140
and their continuing
influences and transformations

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.440
of Carl Sauer,

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.590
who was perhaps one of the, or certainly,

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.050
is one of the most influential geographers

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.610
of the 20th century.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.800
His books, his works,
are veritably crossed

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.160
and trans-disciplinary,

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.849
there are many concepts and approaches

00:01:26.849 --> 00:01:29.390
that Sauer pioneered and/or championed

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.070
that scholars use today,

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.930
often without realizing their
origin and their history.

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:36.650
Sauer was a professor of geography

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.770
here at Berkeley from 1923 to 1957.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.460
And he was an emeritus professor

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.220
until his death in 1975.

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.240
This was the formative time

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.860
of what became a distinctly
Berkeley cultural geography.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.590
And you would not be surprised to learn

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.430
that being a contemporary here,

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.840
with the anthropologist Alfred Kroeber,

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.190
there were discussions and debates

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:59.550
between the two and their students,

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.520
both leaving a legacy of
promise and challenges

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.930
to the understanding of human cultures,

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.180
their landscapes, and their histories.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.600
We are honored that
members of the Sauer family

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.750
are here with us today for

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.740
the 21st Sauer Memorial Lecture,

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:15.778
and we are grateful to them

00:02:15.778 --> 00:02:18.700
for their continuing
support of the endowment.

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.330
Today I am really pleased to introduce

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.030
our 21st Sauer Lecturer,
Professor Marie Price,

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.060
of the George Washington University,

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.200
where she is recently Chair of
the Department of Geography.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.250
As you will understand from her lecture,

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.810
she is also a professor
of international affairs

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.500
and has served as director

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.830
of the Latin American Studies

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.570
for the Elliot School of
International Affairs.

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.650
She is frequently on call for the press

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.750
and many organizations,
and if you go onto Google,

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.590
you can find some interviews with her.

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.240
Given her expertise on such crucial topics

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.920
for today's world as immigration,

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.450
this is something of a homecoming,

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:58.460
if you will, for Marie.

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:59.760
She is a Californian.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.720
She is a Berkeley graduate.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.710
Having earned her bachelor's degree here

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:05.780
in the Department of Geography before

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.110
attending Syracuse University from where

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.560
she received her PhD in 1991.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.380
She's had extensive field experience

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.390
researching urban immigration,

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.310
migration, and development
in Latin America.

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.920
She's surveyed immigration from Bolivia,

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.650
investigated migration and
coffee cultivation in Venezuela,

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.840
and gathered data and
conducted field research

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.990
on global cities and immigrants.

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:31.480
Her articles have been published

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.310
in such journals as the Annals of

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.830
the Association of the
American Geographers,

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:37.320
the Geographical Review,

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.310
the Journal of Historical
Geography, Urban Geography,

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.830
International Journal of
Urban and Regional Research,

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.340
Studies in Comparative
International Development and Focus.

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.240
Her books include a co-edited book,

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.970
Migrants to the Metropolis:

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.950
the Rise of Immigrant
Gateway Cities in 2008,

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.550
with Lisa Benton-Short,

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:59.350
and up now to the 5th
edition of the textbook,

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.300
Diversity Amid Globalization:

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.390
World Regions, Environment,
and Development,

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.860
co-authored with Les
Rowntree, Martin Lewis,

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.980
and William Wyckoff,
who are all here today

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.730
to celebrate their co-author.

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.080
Price is a member and very active member

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.990
of several of the key
professional associations,

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:20.900
including the American
Geographical Society,

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.890
the Association of American Geographers,

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.470
the Institute of Current World Affairs,

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.690
the Latin American Studies Association,

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.070
and the Society of Women Geographers.

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:31.810
She's been awarded numerous honors

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.980
for her extensive work in the field.

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:38.320
In 2010, the Conference of
Latin Americanist Geographers

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.120
awarded her the Preston E. James

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.650
Eminent Latin Americanist career award.

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.760
She received the 2005 Trachtenberg Prize

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.100
for Teaching from GW, George
Washington University,

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.250
and her article that she
co-authored with Catherine Cooper:

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.310
Competing Visions, Shifting Boundaries:

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.360
The Construction of Latin
America as a World Region

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.830
was honored as a best current,
concant article of 2008

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.290
in the Journal of Geography

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:05.610
by the National Council
for Geographic Education.

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.830
We are therefore more than pleased

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.400
to be able to welcome
Marie back to Berkeley,

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.950
where she will give
her presentation today.

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:15.130
As you can see,

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.750
Diffusion, Deflection, and Diversity:

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.630
A geographic perspective on
contemporary immigration.

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:22.675
Marie.

00:05:22.675 --> 00:05:25.675
(audience applauds)

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:32.020
- Well, it's a great privilege to be here,

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:36.080
and to see so many
familiar faces and friends.

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:41.610
I was thinking when I agreed to do this

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.000
that the Sauer Lecture changed my life.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
In 1983, I was an undergraduate,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.030
and I've only attended one Sauer lecture.

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:55.880
It was given by D.W. Meinig,

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.950
and after the event,

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:01.590
as would be Betty Parson's tradition,

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:05.060
she invited everybody
up to eat at her house,

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:06.310
it was a big crowd.

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:07.910
And she asked me if I'd help.

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:09.637
I was an undergraduate, I said yes.

00:06:09.637 --> 00:06:11.980
(audience laughs)

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:14.190
The end of the dinner, everyone's served,

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:16.140
and there's one seat left at the table,

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:18.630
and it's next to D.W. Meinig,

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:20.750
and I sat next to him.

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:21.870
And next thing you know,

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:24.690
I was headed to Syracuse
University to get a PhD.

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:25.530
(audience laughs)

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:27.940
So be forewarned,

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:29.815
this lecture could change your life.

00:06:29.815 --> 00:06:32.160
(audience laughs)

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.260
Professor Conkey invited
me to give this lecture

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.040
and I was honored and both taken aback.

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:41.580
My work is very unlike Carl Sauer's,

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:42.910
surely there were others that would be

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:45.850
more appropriate to give this talk.

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:47.940
I write about contemporary immigration,

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:50.250
and rely on large datasets

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:52.180
from censuses and government agencies

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:54.070
to examine the demographic, cultural,

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:56.540
and political consequences
of labor migration.

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:01.620
Sauer was interested in plant
and animal domestication

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:04.540
by historical and prehistorical peoples,

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:07.010
undergoing processes that are largely

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:10.530
non-recurrent and concerning spans of time

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:13.220
beyond the short runs
available to enumeration.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.180
Sauer's brand of cultural history

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:18.870
focused on human environmental interaction

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:21.450
and the place of humans in nature,

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:24.850
whereas I'm interested in
human patterns of settlement

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:27.760
and social inclusion and exclusion

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.590
in increasingly diverse cities.

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:35.820
As different as my empirical
focus is from Carl Sauer's,

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:39.720
the Berkeley school tradition
of cultural geography

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:42.540
has always inspired me as a fertile

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:44.870
and diverse body of scholarship

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:49.730
focused upon field work and
long-term landscape change,

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:51.230
especially in Latin America.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:56.690
This is a illustration
done by a Bolivian artist,

00:07:56.690 --> 00:08:01.530
Antonio Sotomayor, of
Sauer in the field, 1932.

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:02.620
And you know it's Sauer

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:04.610
because he has a pipe in his mouth,

00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:09.480
he's in the cot in the front.
(audience laughs)

00:08:10.528 --> 00:08:13.800
And insistence on field experience

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.490
was the rule in Sauer's day,

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:17.820
and I'm happy to see it's very much

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:21.090
alive today among Berkeley geographers.

00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:22.550
The value of going to places,

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:24.320
observing forms and patterns,

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:25.570
talking with people,

00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:26.930
digging into archives,

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:30.360
mapping results cannot be underestimated.

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:33.490
Interestingly, since
many immigration scholars

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:35.940
base their research on
statistical analysis

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:38.640
and large datasets,
having a field component

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:41.250
in my immigration research often leads to

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:43.870
different lines of argument
and interpretation.

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:47.240
Secondly, Sauer stressed the importance

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:49.840
of following particular themes or topics

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:52.510
rather than insisting
on regional expertise

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:53.360
for its own sake.

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:55.760
Field work in Latin America led to

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:58.980
Sauer's interest in agricultural
origins and dispersals

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:00.630
as well as native peoples.

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:03.410
But ultimately, the
topic demanded research

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:05.660
well beyond the boundaries
of Latin America.

00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:09.470
Similarly, I was trained
as a Latin Americanist

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:11.440
at Syracuse University,

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:14.240
but due to the global reach
of international migrants,

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:16.830
my research has stretched
into new localities,

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:19.820
such as the streets of Barcelona, Dubai,

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:23.160
or Washington DC, as well
as into new literatures.

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:27.042
Sauer insisted that geographers make

00:09:27.042 --> 00:09:31.270
value judgements in their
writings and actions,

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:32.103
and for Sauer,

00:09:32.103 --> 00:09:34.570
these judgements reflected
his serious concern

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:36.840
about environmental degradation,

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:39.420
especially the threat that modernity posed

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:41.260
for traditional rural peoples.

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:44.800
Sauer was not an overt activist

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:47.014
but he's thought to
engage a broad audience

00:09:47.014 --> 00:09:49.600
and share his deeply held conviction for

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:52.310
the necessity of sustainable livelihoods.

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:55.450
Over 70 years ago,

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:58.230
he published a subtly subversive book

00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:02.480
for American schoolchildren,
Man in Nature:

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:05.650
America before the days of the white man.

00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:08.590
Granted, it's not a gender neutral title,

00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:11.790
but it was handsomely illustrated

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:14.890
by a Bolivian artist, Antonio Sotomayor.

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:17.096
And it was a book meant to teach

00:10:17.096 --> 00:10:20.720
American children about Amer Indian life

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:22.620
prior to European contact

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:24.810
that was way ahead of its time.

00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:27.220
Sadly its message did not penetrate

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:29.880
US school curriculum in the 1930s

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:32.210
but it demonstrates a conscious effort

00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:34.380
at outreach and engagement that continued

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:35.580
throughout his lifetime.

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:38.170
As an immigration scholar,

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:40.690
my outreach has been
through policy engagement,

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:43.810
working with immigrant groups

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:46.590
and creating tools that
local jurisdictions

00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:49.270
can use to facilitate immigrant inclusion,

00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:51.650
a project I just finished with UNESCO.

00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:55.230
The value judgment I bring to my research

00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:58.120
is that immigrant inclusion

00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:00.950
is important but difficult,

00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:02.990
and does not naturally happen,

00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:04.840
because racially, linguistically,

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:07.410
ethnically distinct immigrants force

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:11.440
a reexamination of self
and collective identity

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:14.330
that can be difficult for
native and foreign-born alike.

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:19.110
Yet ultimately, inclusion is essential

00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:20.770
in our increasingly diverse

00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:23.710
and immigrant-dependent societies.

00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:27.420
Or as political scientist
Robert Putnam reminds us,

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:32.050
the central challenge for
modern, diversifying societies

00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:35.970
is to create a new and
broader sense of we.

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:40.970
I was fortunate to be an undergraduate

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:43.390
at Berkeley in the early 1980s,

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:45.830
when practitioners of the Berkeley School

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:49.400
of Cultural Geography
were still an active force

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:51.660
in the Department of Geography.

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:53.550
And when I teach geographic thought

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:55.630
to seniors in my department,

00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:58.660
they all read works by Carl Sauer.

00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:00.950
Most recently, we discussed the essay,

00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:03.490
the Seminar as Exploration,

00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:05.440
which is currently included
in William Denevan's

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:07.212
newly edited collection called,

00:12:07.212 --> 00:12:11.010
Carl Sauer on culture and landscapes.

00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:13.440
And as Dr. Conkey said,

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:16.230
you cannot ignore Carl Sauer

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:18.000
when you're talking about 20th century

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.270
North American geography.

00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:23.930
My human bridge to the tradition

00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:27.540
was the incomparable Dr. James Parsons,

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:28.690
a student of Sauer's

00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:30.940
and noted Latin Americanist
in his own right.

00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:33.940
Parsons was a mentor and friend

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:36.130
from my undergraduate days at Cal

00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:38.450
until his death in 1997.

00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:44.740
Jim always referred to
Carl Sauer as Mr. Sauer.

00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:48.850
A deferential stance towards the man

00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:52.350
and his work that frankly
seemed out of place

00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:53.890
with the rough and tumble world

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:56.240
of Berkeley academic discourse.

00:12:57.340 --> 00:12:59.890
What was it about the
man and his scholarship

00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:01.470
that seemed beyond reproach?

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:04.790
For some geographers in the department,

00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:06.940
I always suspected that this deference

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:09.970
was annoying and even
downright perturbing.

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:13.740
Like Sauer, most Berkeley scholars

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:16.460
are eager to chart their own course.

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:19.360
And by the 1980s, critical
social theory, and later,

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:22.260
political ecology were
the roads that beckoned.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.580
Traditional cultural
geography a la Berkeley

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:27.260
was too much cumbersome baggage,

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:28.510
best to cast aside.

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:32.870
I believe that a tremendous opportunity

00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:35.470
was lost by this rejection.

00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:37.450
Rather than build connections

00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:39.040
with an intellectual tradition

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.610
that has inspired multiple generations

00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:45.040
of American and Latin
American geographers,

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:47.890
the preferred course was
an active disassociation

00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:50.750
from a rich academic inheritance

00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:53.850
that any other department
wouldn't have erased.

00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:54.870
So in today's talk,

00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:55.770
I hope to demonstrate

00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:59.180
how two traditional Sauerian concepts,

00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:02.150
cultural diffusion and cultural landscape,

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:05.540
have been relevant in my
research on immigration.

00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:07.530
I will draw upon a decade of field work

00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:08.440
in the Americas,

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:12.350
especially Washington DC
and Cochabamba, Bolivia,

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:14.310
to demonstrate how immigration creates

00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:18.240
new patterns of diffusion
and ruptures in the landscape

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:19.530
that must be acknowledged

00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:22.960
in order for more inclusive
and diverse communities.

00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:27.270
So let us turn now to
the topic of immigration.

00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:33.390
Immigration has always captured
my geographic imagination.

00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:35.210
The literature on immigration is immense

00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:36.920
and scholars from many disciplines

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:37.910
contribute to it.

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:40.720
Ironically, given the popular

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:42.750
and scholarly interest in immigration,

00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:46.560
very few people actually
leave their country of birth

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:48.030
for residence abroad.

00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:50.930
According to the United Nations,

00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:55.930
the migrant stock figure
is 214 million people,

00:14:56.250 --> 00:15:00.710
or 3.1% of the world's 7 billion people.

00:15:01.905 --> 00:15:03.420
Of course, this figure does not capture

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:05.750
all international
migration so it's important

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:08.560
to consider this number
as a demographic floor

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:10.370
and not a ceiling.

00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:12.370
This figure shows the steady upward trend

00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:14.710
in the estimates of global migrant stock.

00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:18.400
Here the absolute numbers
warrant attention.

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:20.510
In 1960, the world's migrant stock

00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:22.710
was about 80 million,

00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:24.240
and a large portion of those numbers

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:26.660
came from the partitioning of India

00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:28.800
along with traditional
countries of settlement,

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:31.270
the US, Canada, Argentina, and Australia.

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:35.440
Today the number exceeds 214 million,

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:37.590
which if grouped together in one state,

00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:40.440
would be the fifth largest
country in the world,

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:42.500
wedged in between Indonesia and Brazil.

00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:46.270
Despite the absolute growth of immigrants,

00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:48.220
for 50 years,

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:50.460
the world's migrant stock has ranged

00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:55.430
between 2.1 or 3.1% of
the world's population.

00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:59.660
So why is immigration a big deal

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:00.970
if so few people leave?

00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:05.950
The answer is uneven
geographic distribution.

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:09.670
When shifting level to the nation state,

00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:12.570
where immigrants settle
is extremely uneven,

00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:14.030
both in terms of absolute numbers

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:16.730
and proportion of the total population.

00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:18.660
It's no surprise to anyone in this room

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:20.172
that the United States has the largest

00:16:20.172 --> 00:16:23.700
foreign-born population around 40 million,

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:26.490
which is more than three
times larger than Russia,

00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:29.400
which has the second largest
foreign-born population,

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:32.870
followed by Germany, Saudi
Arabia, Canada, and France.

00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:37.020
A more interesting list of
immigration destinations

00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:39.950
shows that states where migrants make up

00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:43.600
the largest proportion
of the total population.

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:46.380
Here the Gulf States stand out,

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:48.430
with Qatar topping the list

00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:52.240
at a whopping 87% foreign-born,

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:54.660
followed by the UAE at 70%,

00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:56.780
and Kuwait at 69%.

00:16:58.240 --> 00:16:59.530
Migrants to these countries

00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:01.208
come from other Arab states,

00:17:01.208 --> 00:17:05.590
but also large numbers are
from South and Southeast Asia.

00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:09.270
A running joke amongst immigrants in Dubai

00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:11.980
is that it's the best run Indian city

00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:15.480
in the world.
(audience laughs)

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:16.980
Two cities on this list,

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:19.240
Singapore, a city state
that relies heavily

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:21.000
upon immigrants from neighboring Malaysia

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.350
but also from East and Southeast Asia,

00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:25.800
and Hong Kong, which for
administrative purposes,

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:28.339
is still treated as a
demographically distinct

00:17:28.339 --> 00:17:30.580
entity from the PRC,

00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:31.790
although not surprisingly,

00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:33.390
the majority of Hong Kong's immigrants

00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:34.640
come from mainland China.

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:39.040
By comparison, the US,
which is not on this list,

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:43.050
only has 12.5% of its
population foreign-born.

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:46.710
The uneven geography
of immigrant settlement

00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:47.960
is more stunning when you shift

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:51.560
to the scale of analysis
to metropolitan areas.

00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:53.690
In research that Lisa Benton-Short and I

00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:55.580
conducted on immigrant gateways,

00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:58.090
we found that 19 metropolitan areas

00:17:58.090 --> 00:18:00.840
that had over one million
foreign-born residents

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:03.410
accounted for nearly one in five

00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:05.920
of the world's immigrants in 2005.

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:09.490
This map is dynamic and changing.

00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:13.960
Cities such as Doha and
Madrid may soon be added.

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:16.440
Buenos Aires fell off the list

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:19.370
but may be back on when
the census is completed.

00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:22.590
Also there's emerging
data on the foreign-born

00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:25.710
in Chinese cities, especially Shanghai,

00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:27.730
and these global immigrant destinations

00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:31.010
of foreign-born can be one quarter or more

00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:33.020
of the total population,

00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:36.270
a point that's underscored
by this next figure,

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:40.920
which shows a list of cities

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:44.950
followed by the percentage
foreign-born in red,

00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:46.060
and then the percentage

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:48.810
of the country's foreign-born in blue.

00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:53.810
So for example, Toronto, which
is over 45% foreign-born,

00:18:54.910 --> 00:18:57.760
is, where is the country of Canada,

00:18:58.682 --> 00:19:00.960
it's a little bit about 20% foreign-born.

00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:05.320
Mapping the world's urban
immigrant destinations

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:08.050
is challenging because no agency

00:19:08.050 --> 00:19:11.620
collects and distributes
urban immigrant data.

00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:16.160
But this figure shows metropolitan areas,

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:18.850
with work I've done with
my colleagues at GW,

00:19:18.850 --> 00:19:21.620
that have at least 100,000
foreign-born in purple,

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:25.790
those with 250,000 foreign-born in green,

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:27.690
and over a million in red.

00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:32.660
Europe, the region of the
world with the most immigrants,

00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:35.540
and North America
dominate this world view.

00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:39.870
Yet, Southwest Asia has
many important destinations

00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:41.520
and there's some significant shifts

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:44.810
occurring in East Asia
with more immigrants

00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:48.100
flowing into cities in
Japan, Korea, and China.

00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:51.670
Unfortunately, serious data gaps result

00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:53.820
in under-representation
of immigrant movements

00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:55.250
in Sub-Saharan Africa,

00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:56.680
which we know are significant

00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:58.960
but we just don't have data on,

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:01.790
as well as for India and China,

00:20:01.790 --> 00:20:03.680
although China's story is really much more

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:05.690
of an internal migration.

00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:06.750
But on this map,

00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:09.920
there are over 140 metropolitan areas

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:13.290
that account for about
70 million immigrants.

00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:15.940
And each of these dots represents cities

00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:18.530
that are experiencing
demographic, cultural,

00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:20.800
and economic change due to immigration.

00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:26.660
So let me turn to the first
concept of cultural diffusion.

00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:29.680
Large scale contemporary immigration,

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:30.700
especially the cities,

00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:33.900
creates new pathways of cultural diffusion

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:36.950
that are both exhilarating
and intimidating

00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:39.180
to localities and livelihoods.

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:41.790
The agents of cultural diffusion

00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:43.750
are immigrants themselves,

00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:46.490
especially when they arrive
in large numbers as adults

00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:49.360
and bring with them
distinct cultural practices,

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:52.390
languages, religions, food preferences,

00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:53.950
identities, and taste.

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:58.120
Obviously, culture is complex,

00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:01.550
and cannot be reduced to national origins.

00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:04.470
But country of origin is
not a bad proxy measure

00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:06.760
for culture and it gives us some data

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:09.080
to work with when trying to understand

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:11.480
global and metropolitan level change.

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:16.280
To appreciate this shifting
cultural complexity,

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:19.890
we need a new reality TV show.

00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:25.510
Call it Wheaton 20906.

00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:28.330
Anyone know Wheaton?

00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:32.660
There's Wheaton right there.

00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:37.660
Imagine a suburb that
was 97% white in 1970.

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:41.210
But in the decades of the 90s,

00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:45.640
received new immigrants
from 131 countries.

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:47.800
This was not the only zip
code in the Washington area

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:50.720
that received a sudden and
diverse flux of immigrants.

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:52.440
Metropolitan Washington is still

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:54.860
a relatively new immigrant gateway,

00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:57.170
compared to San Francisco at least.

00:21:57.170 --> 00:21:58.970
But the foreign-born poured in,

00:21:58.970 --> 00:22:01.030
in the 1980s and 90s,

00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:02.720
and now make up about 20%

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:04.690
of the metropolitan area's population.

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:08.360
There are varying ways
that we can visualize this

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:10.440
that are suggestive of both demographic

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:12.680
and sociocultural change.

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:17.040
So this map here is
showing just the suburbs

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:19.290
of Washington and the codings,

00:22:19.290 --> 00:22:22.020
the pale yellow is less
than 9% foreign-born,

00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:23.770
the darker yellow 10 or more,

00:22:23.770 --> 00:22:26.070
and the orange 20%.

00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:28.160
This is what the pattern looked like in

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:30.380
from the 1980 census.

00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:32.750
This is the 1990 census.

00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:35.740
And this is the 2000 census.

00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:37.830
And as an editorial aside,

00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:41.710
the US census, note, did not ask in 2010,

00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:43.190
foreign-born status,

00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:47.500
so it would be really
interesting to know that

00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:49.020
but we will not,

00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:51.030
though you can kinda
dig through the ACS data

00:22:51.030 --> 00:22:52.530
and try and piece it together.

00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:57.390
But there are other ways
to think about this change.

00:22:57.390 --> 00:22:58.830
I rather like this map.

00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:00.850
I couldn't show all
the different countries

00:23:00.850 --> 00:23:02.950
cuz the map would look
like a plate of spaghetti,

00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:04.920
but by regions you see that Washington

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:08.440
does get a very diverse flow of immigrants

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:11.270
from South America, Central America,

00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:14.430
East Asia, Southeast
Asia, Africa, and Europe.

00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:17.050
Or the ever popular pie chart.

00:23:17.050 --> 00:23:20.160
One of the things that makes
Washington a bit different

00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:22.950
is the mix of its immigrants.

00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:25.060
The largest group is Salvadoran,

00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:28.110
followed by India, Korea, Mexico, Vietnam,

00:23:28.110 --> 00:23:32.570
Philippines, China, Guatemala,
Bolivia, and Ethiopia.

00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:36.810
In major immigrant destinations,

00:23:36.810 --> 00:23:39.710
such as Washington,
San Francisco, Chicago,

00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:43.650
or New York, social scientists
are still struggling

00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:46.500
to understand what does culture mean

00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:48.450
in such diverse settings.

00:23:48.450 --> 00:23:51.110
What kind of society will form

00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:52.890
and how do we visualize it?

00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:57.590
Anthropologist Arjun Appadurai summarizes

00:23:57.590 --> 00:23:59.990
the problem in his work,
Modernity at Large.

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:03.810
As groups migrate,
regroup in new locations,

00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:05.190
reconstruct their histories,

00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:07.740
and reconfigure their ethnic projects,

00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:11.630
the ethno in ethnography
takes on a slippery,

00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:15.310
non-localized quality
to which the descriptive

00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:18.500
practice of anthropology
will have to respond.

00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:22.960
Like anthropologists,
many cultural geographers

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:26.000
usually associate culture with territory,

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.810
yet it is the non-localized,

00:24:27.810 --> 00:24:32.080
or reterritorialized
experience of culture,

00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:36.130
in part brought about by
complex migratory streams,

00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:39.140
that is unsettling and unexpected.

00:24:40.690 --> 00:24:43.100
This unsettling experience happened to me

00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:46.420
at a PTA meeting at my son's middle school

00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:47.350
several years ago.

00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:50.950
Before it began, an announcement was made

00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:54.410
that the proceedings
would be simultaneously

00:24:54.410 --> 00:24:58.220
translated into Spanish, not unusual,

00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:02.570
and Mongolian, unusual.
(audience laughs)

00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:04.620
I later found out that through

00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:06.740
the US Diversity Visa Program,

00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:09.320
a sudden influx of Mongolian families

00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:11.260
had arrived in the early 2000s

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:13.330
and settled in Arlington County,

00:25:13.330 --> 00:25:17.240
hence the unsettling need
for Mongolian translation.

00:25:19.030 --> 00:25:22.300
There is an uneasiness
when our assumptions

00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:24.320
about the cultural map of a place

00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:27.400
do not conform to our experience.

00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:30.590
And in places that undergo
rapid demographic change

00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:31.950
due to immigration,

00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:34.120
the sense of cultural uncertainty

00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:36.840
is shared by native-born
and foreign-born alike.

00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:40.170
Imagine again what it must be like

00:25:40.170 --> 00:25:43.670
to live in a zip code with
neighbors from 130 countries.

00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:46.340
Given the cultural ambiguity,

00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:48.260
it's not surprising that immigrant groups

00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:51.260
seek refuge among co-ethnics to affirm

00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:52.480
a sense of identity.

00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:56.930
One Bolivian immigrant in
metropolitan Washington

00:25:56.930 --> 00:25:59.060
explained the need to do folkloric dance

00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:01.460
and such as a refuge.

00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:04.420
It's very difficult to come
to a country like this,

00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:06.540
it's so big, that is a monster.

00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:09.330
It's a monster to us because
it's so big and diverse.

00:26:10.290 --> 00:26:13.060
Then this is the reason why
we continue folkloric dancing.

00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:14.500
It's a cultural refuge.

00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:15.460
We like to dance.

00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:16.590
We like the music.

00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:19.250
It's a cultural refuge to maintain life

00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:21.250
and stay connected with Bolivia.

00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:23.680
When I dance and dance, I return.

00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:28.420
But this cultural practice
of folkloric dance

00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:32.190
on a fall afternoon
occurred in a suburban park,

00:26:32.190 --> 00:26:34.810
where children and parents
from other countries

00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:37.600
also viewed the spectacle with curiosity,

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:40.810
and perhaps some empathy
that this was a symbolic

00:26:40.810 --> 00:26:45.080
act of return or at least
an expression of identity

00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:46.760
in a multicultural setting.

00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:51.730
Yet the feeling of
displacement also happens

00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:52.930
among the native-born.

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:58.040
It's them, the immigrants
who've made us into racists,

00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:00.770
remarked a Swedish teen
quoted in geographer

00:27:00.770 --> 00:27:04.570
Allen Pred's remarkable
and unblinking analysis

00:27:04.570 --> 00:27:07.010
of immigrant exclusion and segregation.

00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:11.350
Even in Sweden, racism, racialized spaces,

00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:13.800
and popular geographical imagination

00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:17.330
describes the intolerance
and spatial segregation

00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:20.420
experienced by racially
distinct immigrants.

00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:22.820
In a formerly homogeneous country,

00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:25.350
long recognized for its
progressive policies

00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:28.900
of social tolerance,
as the title suggests,

00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:32.380
seemingly tolerant
places can suddenly shift

00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:35.120
when immigration is
questioned or rejected.

00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:40.050
In fact, the certainty of
anti-immigrant backlash

00:27:40.050 --> 00:27:43.250
is perhaps the one law of immigration

00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:44.300
that we can count on.

00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:46.980
Demetri Papademetriou, a founder

00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:48.510
of the Migration Policy Institute,

00:27:48.510 --> 00:27:52.660
contends that when support
for immigration collapses,

00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:54.130
which historically speaking,

00:27:54.130 --> 00:27:57.820
occurs with pendulum-like regularity,

00:27:57.820 --> 00:28:00.840
the duration and depth
of a society's engagement

00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:02.740
with the process does not seem

00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:07.140
too inoculated against
excessive reactions.

00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:11.550
Excessive reactions
happen no matter the size,

00:28:11.550 --> 00:28:15.630
composition, or contributions
of an immigrant population.

00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:19.620
So if you accept the
premise that immigration

00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:22.090
results in cultural diffusion

00:28:22.090 --> 00:28:26.000
and in some cases,
hyper-diverse localities form,

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.020
then how do localities
and the people in them,

00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:30.600
react to these changes?

00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:34.710
In general, there are
three spatial strategies

00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:37.020
that emerge as immigrant newcomers settle

00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:39.396
in cities and localities.

00:28:39.396 --> 00:28:41.250
They're loosely grouped in

00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:43.900
concentration segregation strategies,

00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:48.900
deflection strategies, or an
integration diversity approach.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.940
How intentional these strategies are

00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:55.390
can vary over time and with
distinct immigrant groups

00:28:55.390 --> 00:28:56.870
and local governance.

00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:58.670
Also, in any one locality,

00:28:58.670 --> 00:29:00.690
each of these patterns may be evident.

00:29:01.910 --> 00:29:05.770
So I'll begin with concentration
and, or segregation.

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:08.960
It's irresistible for geographers

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:12.050
to map immigrant residential patterns.

00:29:12.050 --> 00:29:14.300
Geocoded census data invites others

00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:18.620
to take such spatial patterning seriously.

00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:20.890
Patterns of immigrant clusters, however,

00:29:20.890 --> 00:29:24.300
do not get at the processes
by which they form.

00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:27.250
The drivers may be
economic housing policies,

00:29:27.250 --> 00:29:30.920
network driven, or
blatantly discriminatory.

00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:32.670
In the US, the formal restriction

00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:34.610
of immigrant settlement
to particular areas

00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:36.630
of a city is not legal,

00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:38.770
but that does not stop informal networks

00:29:38.770 --> 00:29:40.850
and structural forces from directing

00:29:40.850 --> 00:29:43.630
certain immigrants to
reside in particular areas.

00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:47.130
One of the interesting
debates in immigration policy,

00:29:47.130 --> 00:29:49.050
especially refugee policy,

00:29:49.930 --> 00:29:53.070
is should clustering be
encouraged or discouraged.

00:29:54.990 --> 00:29:58.740
Or how much does racial
or ethnic segregation

00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:02.410
inhibit social and economic
integration in society.

00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:05.990
Evidence shows that
concentrated immigrant areas

00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:08.150
are often poorer, less educated,

00:30:08.150 --> 00:30:10.370
and linguistically isolated.

00:30:10.370 --> 00:30:13.670
Yet others contend that
in a democratic society,

00:30:13.670 --> 00:30:15.530
if immigrants self select to cluster

00:30:15.530 --> 00:30:19.550
among co-ethnics then it's
their choice and their right.

00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:22.800
For immigrant groups small and large,

00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:24.590
highly skilled or less skilled,

00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:27.370
there are clear advantages in clustering.

00:30:27.370 --> 00:30:29.820
Geographer Wei Lee writes about ethnoburbs

00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:32.770
as a suburban cultural
and commercial landscape

00:30:32.770 --> 00:30:34.560
that form to meet immigrant needs

00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:36.830
and maintain transnational linkages.

00:30:37.770 --> 00:30:40.720
This does not mean that
compact neighborhoods emerge

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:44.450
of a single ethnic group,
such as Little Italy,

00:30:44.450 --> 00:30:48.270
but if co-ethnics settle
relatively near each other,

00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:51.820
then an ethnic economy
emerges with small businesses,

00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:54.330
such as restaurants,
travel agencies, groceries,

00:30:54.330 --> 00:30:56.460
money sending services that serve

00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:58.880
the particular needs of immigrants.

00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:01.490
In this map, Bolivians in Washington

00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:03.450
show some patterns of concentration

00:31:03.450 --> 00:31:06.180
especially in Northern Virginia.

00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:08.830
But what's interesting is
when I was in a focus group

00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:11.260
with business entrepreneurs
who were Bolivian,

00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:12.490
didn't show them this map,

00:31:12.490 --> 00:31:14.450
I showed them a map of Washington

00:31:14.450 --> 00:31:16.490
and asked them where did they think

00:31:16.490 --> 00:31:19.210
the best place for business
opportunities were,

00:31:19.210 --> 00:31:20.800
and it pretty neatly conformed

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:22.760
with where the Bolivians resided.

00:31:25.030 --> 00:31:28.950
The second strategy, called deflection.

00:31:30.050 --> 00:31:32.490
Deflection is an exclusionary practice

00:31:32.490 --> 00:31:33.660
that happens regularly

00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:35.900
and may also explain why immigrants

00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:37.720
leave one area of a city for another

00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:39.600
or cluster in particular areas.

00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:42.880
Deflection happens
according to sociologist

00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:45.190
Sibon Light, when zoning ordinances,

00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:48.200
anti-loitering laws,
industrial regulations,

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:50.530
often created for other purposes,

00:31:50.530 --> 00:31:53.560
are enforced to push out
or redirect poor immigrants

00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:56.020
away from particular cities or suburbs.

00:31:58.710 --> 00:32:03.710
Light describes it as a four step process

00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:07.060
of absorption, saturation,

00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:09.340
intolerance, and later deflection,

00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:12.820
which pushes migrants around US cities.

00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:14.240
So in metropolitan Washington,

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:16.670
there've been three major
deflection strategies,

00:32:16.670 --> 00:32:20.140
which I've had the
opportunity to view up close.

00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:23.120
Zoning against excessive occupancy,

00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:27.490
regulation of day labor
sites and 287G agreements.

00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:31.110
Interviewing local
officials and town planners,

00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:32.240
going to town meetings,

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:34.400
conducting focus groups
at day labor sites,

00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:37.560
provided insight in
how deflection happens.

00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:41.730
Most local jurisdictions
have occupancy limits

00:32:41.730 --> 00:32:43.770
based on housing type that are in place

00:32:43.770 --> 00:32:46.430
for public protection and safety.

00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:49.540
But enforcement of these
codes vary tremendously.

00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:51.530
Typically, if the neighbor is unhappy with

00:32:51.530 --> 00:32:55.050
the number of cars in a
nearby private residence,

00:32:55.050 --> 00:32:59.160
he or she can report
excessive occupancy violations

00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:02.350
to the town and they are
obliged to investigate it.

00:33:02.350 --> 00:33:04.690
Immigrants often feel targeted by this,

00:33:04.690 --> 00:33:06.710
saying that they have larger households

00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:08.790
and extended families.

00:33:08.790 --> 00:33:11.790
At one point, the town
of Manassas, Virginia,

00:33:11.790 --> 00:33:14.390
which had experienced a dramatic surge

00:33:14.390 --> 00:33:18.230
in Hispanic population, tried
to legally define family.

00:33:19.307 --> 00:33:21.240
And when they couldn't do that,

00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:22.790
they took the unusual approach

00:33:22.790 --> 00:33:25.150
of passing a local ordinance that made it

00:33:25.150 --> 00:33:28.820
illegal to sleep in any
other room but a bedroom.

00:33:29.785 --> 00:33:32.310
(audience laughs)

00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:35.640
Not surprisingly, the law
was contested and repealed.

00:33:37.285 --> 00:33:40.340
Day labor sites can be
informally tolerated

00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:43.240
by communities, formally
organized by them,

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:45.780
or aggressively prosecuted.

00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:49.400
The town of Herndon,
Virgina, erupted in 2005,

00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:52.040
as it struggled to resolve
the day labor issue.

00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:54.400
And here's some day laborers gathered,

00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:55.920
actually they're mostly sending money

00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:57.120
back home in this photo.

00:33:58.690 --> 00:34:00.600
Herndon straddles the border of Fairfax

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:03.480
and Loudoun counties near Dulles Airport.

00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:05.840
Herndon's immigration population grew

00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:08.420
in neighborhoods with older,
less expensive apartments

00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:10.260
and single family homes.

00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:12.560
But it was a concentrated gathering,

00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:17.180
sometimes 200 or more, of
Hispanic men near a 7-11,

00:34:17.180 --> 00:34:20.620
waiting for work that
drew the ire of residents.

00:34:20.620 --> 00:34:23.120
A coalition of religious
groups and a progressive mayor

00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:25.540
created a formal day labor site

00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:28.250
in a former police station
at the edge of town

00:34:28.250 --> 00:34:29.790
where the men could gather.

00:34:29.790 --> 00:34:32.080
Employers and employees could register,

00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:35.160
and English language classes
were taught by volunteers,

00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:36.460
and interestingly enough,

00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:39.380
I found a geographer who
was running this site.

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:45.680
Yet a race for mayor in
2006 led to a denouncing

00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:49.210
of public money going to non-citizens.

00:34:49.210 --> 00:34:50.490
A new mayor was elected,

00:34:50.490 --> 00:34:53.330
the facility was eventually closed.

00:34:53.330 --> 00:34:56.480
Loitering laws were aggressively enforced,

00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:58.900
and the day laborers began to dissipate,

00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:01.770
many moving to other more tolerant areas

00:35:01.770 --> 00:35:03.090
in the metropolitan area.

00:35:04.490 --> 00:35:06.770
Yet the most politically
contentious strategy

00:35:06.770 --> 00:35:09.450
has been the adoption of 287G agreements,

00:35:09.450 --> 00:35:11.430
where local law enforcement officers

00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:15.890
are trained to act as immigration
enforcement officials.

00:35:15.890 --> 00:35:17.570
And interestingly enough,

00:35:17.570 --> 00:35:19.620
Herndon was one of the
first towns to adopt

00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:22.920
the 287G agreement, which was considerably

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:26.420
more costly than maintaining
the day labor site.

00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:30.610
But it was Prince William's County

00:35:30.610 --> 00:35:33.060
decision to adopt the 287G,

00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:36.330
led by an,

00:35:38.110 --> 00:35:41.970
an ambitious chair of the
county board of supervisors,

00:35:41.970 --> 00:35:44.910
Corey Stewart, that led to a ugly chapter

00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:47.390
in immigration deflection processes.

00:35:48.830 --> 00:35:51.280
Among Latinos, Prince
William County had been

00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:53.580
a popular destination with good schools

00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:54.940
and affordable housing,

00:35:54.940 --> 00:35:58.580
but suddenly it became tierra prohibida.

00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:02.280
A year and a half into the program,

00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:05.820
when enrollment in ESL
programs showed declines,

00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:07.700
Corey Steward declared victory.

00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:11.120
Yet the stigma against
Prince William County's

00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:13.950
anti-illegal immigrant
approach manifested itself

00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:17.530
in stunning devaluation of home prices,

00:36:17.530 --> 00:36:20.160
and a dramatic drop in small businesses,

00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:22.150
so much that the Chamber of Commerce

00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:24.830
asked that they stop
enforcing the policies.

00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:28.090
The county was hurt much
more by the economic

00:36:28.090 --> 00:36:30.910
recession in 2008 and nine

00:36:30.910 --> 00:36:33.190
than comparable outer jurisdictions.

00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:39.610
Robert Putnam's 2007 large scale study

00:36:39.610 --> 00:36:43.170
documenting greater erosion
of social capital or trust

00:36:43.170 --> 00:36:45.560
in more ethnically diverse settings

00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:49.080
is a relevant albeit controversial study.

00:36:49.970 --> 00:36:53.060
He warns, in the short to medium term,

00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:55.510
immigration and ethnic diversity challenge

00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:59.780
social solidarity and
inhibit social capital,

00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:04.290
or in the vernacular, diversity
at least in the short run,

00:37:04.290 --> 00:37:06.620
brings out the turtle in all of us.

00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:10.030
Yet there are scholars that highlight

00:37:10.030 --> 00:37:12.820
the diversity advantage
such as Richard Florida's

00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:14.450
the Rise of the Creative Class,

00:37:14.450 --> 00:37:17.500
or AnnaLee Saxenian's the New Argonauts,

00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:20.640
stressing the positive economic impact

00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:22.560
of creating societies that are open

00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:25.630
to diverse peoples, including immigrants.

00:37:25.630 --> 00:37:27.540
Usually this group is mostly interested

00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:30.500
in highly skilled
immigrants, but not always.

00:37:31.450 --> 00:37:35.930
In metropolitan Washington,
South Asian Indians

00:37:35.930 --> 00:37:39.770
are the second largest
immigrant group in the region,

00:37:39.770 --> 00:37:41.260
probably the only metropolitan area

00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:44.320
where they are number two
except maybe San Jose.

00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:46.100
They're generally highly educated

00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:48.570
and have higher than
average household incomes.

00:37:48.570 --> 00:37:49.980
In terms of immigrant settlement,

00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:52.270
they are highly suburban and dispersed,

00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:54.840
and there's no real residential clusters.

00:37:55.790 --> 00:37:58.090
But they are large in number.

00:37:59.070 --> 00:38:04.070
Although this map does show
some residential avoidance.

00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:08.750
The District of Columbia
and Prince George's County,

00:38:08.750 --> 00:38:12.110
which is this area here
that's the palest green.

00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:14.870
In both these cases,

00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:17.670
these are areas where
African Americans are,

00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:20.070
or at least recently
have been, the majority.

00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:24.710
The District of Columbia no
longer has a racial majority

00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:28.130
as according to 2011 estimates.

00:38:28.130 --> 00:38:29.300
For people with families,

00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:32.980
the District also has notoriously
underperforming schools,

00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:34.740
despite recent efforts to improve them.

00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:37.560
So that's one of the explanations.

00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:41.270
But mapping immigrant
inclusion or exclusion,

00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:44.020
at least in Washington,
there's always a complex layer

00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:46.890
of black white racial segregation

00:38:46.890 --> 00:38:49.600
that seems to be
influencing the settlement

00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:52.890
decisions of immigrant newcomers

00:38:52.890 --> 00:38:54.520
from very different backgrounds.

00:38:55.690 --> 00:38:58.750
In terms of celebrating
the diversity advantage,

00:38:58.750 --> 00:39:00.490
I return to Wheaton,

00:39:00.490 --> 00:39:03.280
the location of my imaginary reality show.

00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:07.610
Wheaton officials decided
to promote their diversity

00:39:07.610 --> 00:39:10.070
with a marketing campaign.

00:39:10.070 --> 00:39:13.251
Wheaton, deliciously habit forming.

00:39:13.251 --> 00:39:15.450
(audience laughs)

00:39:15.450 --> 00:39:17.850
Why go to downtown to eat where the food's

00:39:17.850 --> 00:39:19.810
more expensive and there's no parking?

00:39:19.810 --> 00:39:21.643
Come to Wheaton, you can still have

00:39:21.643 --> 00:39:24.910
all the ethnic food
and diversity you want.

00:39:29.690 --> 00:39:32.040
Now my comments about
the cultural landscape.

00:39:33.170 --> 00:39:35.470
The cultural landscape
concept has been useful

00:39:35.470 --> 00:39:37.110
to me in appreciating the ways

00:39:37.110 --> 00:39:39.450
that immigrants change localities.

00:39:39.450 --> 00:39:40.640
Not only demographically,

00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:43.350
but also through the built environment.

00:39:43.350 --> 00:39:46.170
Cultural landscape,
especially residential ones,

00:39:46.170 --> 00:39:51.170
often conceal the degree
of social change occurring.

00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:53.900
And it epitomizes the lie of the land

00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:56.350
that Don Mitchell writes
about in his analysis

00:39:56.350 --> 00:39:58.850
of migrant agricultural
workers in California.

00:39:59.810 --> 00:40:01.610
But commercial and religious landscapes

00:40:01.610 --> 00:40:04.610
can be more revealing of
multicultural dynamism.

00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:08.680
There's also an ephemeral
ethnoscapes that groups

00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:11.920
create to maintain identity
and transnational linkages.

00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:15.610
In terms of immigrant
exclusion or backlash,

00:40:15.610 --> 00:40:18.370
these physical changes to familiar places

00:40:18.370 --> 00:40:21.450
often deeply distress long-term residents.

00:40:22.570 --> 00:40:25.090
So when I take my students out

00:40:25.090 --> 00:40:27.590
to Washington's edge gateways,

00:40:27.590 --> 00:40:30.270
they are struck by the normalcy of it all.

00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:34.130
Narrow townhouses, brick garden apartments

00:40:34.130 --> 00:40:36.000
with rows of cars in front of them,

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.940
they are in no way
distinct immigrant markers.

00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:40.960
They almost seem disappointed.

00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:43.370
How come the lawns don't
have pagodas on them?

00:40:43.370 --> 00:40:45.410
Or shrines to the Virgin of Guadelupe?

00:40:46.940 --> 00:40:49.600
But then we turn a corner and a strip mall

00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:51.280
or ethnic shopping center heralds

00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:53.230
an immigrant-created landscape

00:40:53.230 --> 00:40:54.910
such as Eden Center,

00:40:56.010 --> 00:40:59.670
named for a popular shopping
center in former Saigon.

00:40:59.670 --> 00:41:01.100
Or Seoul Plaza.

00:41:02.850 --> 00:41:05.910
My GW colleague Elizabeth
Chaco defines these

00:41:05.910 --> 00:41:08.360
as socio-commerce-scapes
that play an important

00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:10.290
commercial and community building roles

00:41:10.290 --> 00:41:13.260
for immigrant groups who are
not residentially clustered.

00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:16.360
If you've been Washington DC,

00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:19.760
you may be familiar with
the Shaw neighborhood,

00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:23.560
and especially U Street and 9th Streets,

00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:24.680
where there's an impressive array

00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:28.640
of Ethiopian restaurants, music
shops, and ethnic services.

00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:32.660
Ethiopians were important
small business pioneers

00:41:32.660 --> 00:41:35.600
in this area in the 1980s and 90s,

00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:37.770
before the Green Line opened up U Street

00:41:37.770 --> 00:41:39.540
to a wave of gentrification.

00:41:40.410 --> 00:41:42.120
Yet when the Ethiopian community

00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:44.680
approached the DC
government about designating

00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:47.520
the area Little Ethiopia,

00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:49.370
they were publicly rebuked.

00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:52.670
For the first half of the 20th century,

00:41:52.670 --> 00:41:54.980
U Street in the Shaw neighborhood

00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:59.190
was the black Broadway
for segregated Washington.

00:41:59.190 --> 00:42:01.660
This is where Duke Ellington
lived and performed

00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:03.300
and famous venues such as

00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:05.390
the Lincoln Theater are still located.

00:42:06.310 --> 00:42:08.650
Ethiopians were welcomed
to bring their businesses

00:42:08.650 --> 00:42:11.400
to this place and reshape its landscape

00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:14.180
but there was no formal rebranding

00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:16.250
of this place as Little Ethiopia.

00:42:18.370 --> 00:42:21.660
Ethnoscapes, another Appadurai term,

00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:24.350
are created through
fluid networks of people

00:42:24.350 --> 00:42:26.970
and are often ephemeral in nature.

00:42:26.970 --> 00:42:28.310
Rather than the built environment,

00:42:28.310 --> 00:42:30.740
they are an informal
occupation of space for

00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:33.410
a particular event that
may be filled with meaning

00:42:33.410 --> 00:42:35.320
for the immigrants involved.

00:42:36.330 --> 00:42:39.240
I've learned a lot about
the Bolivian community

00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:42.450
through spending time at
immigrant-run soccer leagues.

00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:46.450
These gatherings are
not just about a sport.

00:42:46.450 --> 00:42:49.330
They are social events,
where friends gather,

00:42:49.330 --> 00:42:52.130
news from home is
shared, jobs are offered,

00:42:52.130 --> 00:42:56.240
and funds are raised to
help communities back home.

00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:58.770
One of the more interesting
events I attended

00:42:58.770 --> 00:43:01.520
was when the Bolivian ambassador,

00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:03.480
the hip guy here in a ponytail,

00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:09.580
presented the Copa Evo Morales
to the championship team

00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:13.600
from the incopier league Mamanaca.

00:43:15.110 --> 00:43:19.037
Here the captain from a very small town,

00:43:19.037 --> 00:43:21.770
fewer than 1000 people is accepting

00:43:21.770 --> 00:43:25.530
some serious hardware from
the President of Bolivia

00:43:25.530 --> 00:43:27.200
in Reston, Virgina.

00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:32.410
Which leads to Bolivia,
and how landscape analysis

00:43:32.410 --> 00:43:34.203
and interpretation have been fundamental

00:43:34.203 --> 00:43:38.070
in understanding the
complex transformation

00:43:38.070 --> 00:43:40.380
that is occurring in this rural area

00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:42.660
due to long-standing and far-reaching

00:43:42.660 --> 00:43:44.710
patterns of immigration.

00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:48.360
Up until now, I've focused upon
the impacts of immigration,

00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:52.300
but how does emigration
transform landscapes,

00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:54.490
and what do people think about this?

00:43:55.420 --> 00:43:58.610
An area I have done
research for 10 years now,

00:43:58.610 --> 00:44:00.328
the Valle Alto,

00:44:00.328 --> 00:44:05.328
this rural scene is very much
a transnationalized landscape.

00:44:06.130 --> 00:44:10.770
This rather large church for
a town of maybe 300 people

00:44:10.770 --> 00:44:13.580
was built with money from immigrants,

00:44:13.580 --> 00:44:15.600
and the plaza in front as well.

00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:18.900
All these peach trees are also the result

00:44:18.900 --> 00:44:23.190
of capital coming from the US and Spain,

00:44:23.190 --> 00:44:25.210
and people investing in the land.

00:44:27.590 --> 00:44:32.200
The Valle Alto, thank you Google Earth,

00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:33.970
this is the city of Cochabamba,

00:44:33.970 --> 00:44:34.920
there's a large dam here,

00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:38.310
and this large area here is a high valley

00:44:38.310 --> 00:44:39.990
around 9000 feet long,

00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:42.790
an important agricultural
center for Bolivia,

00:44:42.790 --> 00:44:46.180
and actually, a major
sending area for emigrants

00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:49.180
not just within Bolivia
but internationally.

00:44:50.170 --> 00:44:51.580
But one of the striking things,

00:44:51.580 --> 00:44:55.940
and I visited here and
flown over in a light plane,

00:44:55.940 --> 00:44:59.180
is it's, on one level,
it's a very simple place.

00:44:59.180 --> 00:45:02.640
Small communities, many
of them were established

00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:06.090
three or four hundred years ago.

00:45:06.090 --> 00:45:11.090
Humble, poor, and dirt roads,
lots of adobe structures.

00:45:11.710 --> 00:45:15.260
But suddenly, there have been
ruptures in the landscape.

00:45:16.550 --> 00:45:18.080
And it's been very striking

00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:19.490
as people talk about,

00:45:19.490 --> 00:45:23.010
this is a house that really stood out

00:45:23.010 --> 00:45:26.970
when I was there in, gosh,

00:45:26.970 --> 00:45:29.010
it was like 1999.

00:45:29.010 --> 00:45:31.680
And it seems to be a competition going on

00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:35.090
in these immigrant show houses.

00:45:35.090 --> 00:45:37.790
And it led to some very
interesting discussions.

00:45:38.770 --> 00:45:40.490
Many of these homes are empty.

00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:44.990
People just come for
a few weeks at a time.

00:45:44.990 --> 00:45:47.270
Or maybe they have a family
member, or caretaker,

00:45:47.270 --> 00:45:50.310
stay in them, and yet the
extraordinary thing is,

00:45:50.310 --> 00:45:53.420
every year I go back, there's
more and more of these,

00:45:53.420 --> 00:45:56.340
and they are getting
more and more elaborate.

00:45:56.340 --> 00:45:57.590
It's not a coincidence

00:45:57.590 --> 00:46:02.200
that the immigrants, generally men,

00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:03.880
although women immigrate as well,

00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:05.360
work in construction,

00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:07.510
and they've brought
housing types and designs

00:46:07.510 --> 00:46:10.940
that they've done in
places like Barcelona,

00:46:10.940 --> 00:46:13.230
or Washington, and they've added it

00:46:13.230 --> 00:46:15.510
to the mix of lifestyles.

00:46:16.870 --> 00:46:19.600
People have lots of different attitudes.

00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:24.600
This man, Juan, said to
me, he grew up in Mamanaca,

00:46:26.070 --> 00:46:29.750
spent all his youth in Argentina,

00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:32.260
came back with his young children

00:46:32.260 --> 00:46:34.520
and then went to the United
States for a few years.

00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:36.850
And was, in a quote here, very thankful to

00:46:36.850 --> 00:46:38.170
the United States for the opportunity

00:46:38.170 --> 00:46:39.003
it gave me to work.

00:46:39.003 --> 00:46:41.780
He worked for four
years and then came back

00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:44.180
and started building.

00:46:44.180 --> 00:46:47.710
Now all of his children
are in the United States.

00:46:47.710 --> 00:46:50.440
One recently returned,
and he's been spending

00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:53.210
the last few years building
their dream houses.

00:46:54.450 --> 00:46:56.579
Not quite as elaborate
as the earlier ones,

00:46:56.579 --> 00:47:00.530
but it's a conscious
effort to capitalize abroad

00:47:00.530 --> 00:47:05.530
and then build upon a future in Mamanaca

00:47:06.370 --> 00:47:08.460
through transnational labor flows.

00:47:09.441 --> 00:47:11.530
This is the mayor of Arbieto,

00:47:11.530 --> 00:47:12.940
well the former mayor of Arbieto.

00:47:12.940 --> 00:47:16.360
He had a pretty downright
negative view of immigration.

00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:20.050
He complained that the youth left,

00:47:20.050 --> 00:47:23.080
and they were all taking the same road.

00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:25.530
Although the road could
lead to different places.

00:47:26.900 --> 00:47:29.930
He also complained that the problem

00:47:29.930 --> 00:47:32.370
that there's no support, bad governance,

00:47:32.370 --> 00:47:35.010
not a progressive state, there's no plan,

00:47:35.010 --> 00:47:36.630
we can't do anything.

00:47:36.630 --> 00:47:39.210
Interestingly, he was
just voted out of office

00:47:39.210 --> 00:47:41.980
about a year ago, and an immigrant

00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:46.980
who had made a small fortune
selling used cars in Miami

00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:49.810
has returned to Arbieto

00:47:49.810 --> 00:47:51.920
and is now running for the town

00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:54.410
which locally they refer it

00:47:54.410 --> 00:47:57.030
as the land of little gringos

00:47:57.030 --> 00:47:58.530
because there's actually

00:47:58.530 --> 00:48:02.710
a lot of American-born Bolivians there

00:48:02.710 --> 00:48:06.600
and the surrounding
towns and cities complain

00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:08.260
as they've got more money than we do.

00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:13.260
So this is another rupture in
the socioeconomic landscape.

00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:18.080
I'm gonna end with the photo
that always makes me smile.

00:48:19.210 --> 00:48:21.550
Employing the concepts
of cultural diffusion

00:48:21.550 --> 00:48:23.300
and cultural landscapes when studying

00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:25.560
contemporary immigration does not lead

00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:28.080
to a Sauerian interpretation of the world.

00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:31.440
Yet these concepts can help to explain

00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:34.060
why immigration is filled with promise

00:48:34.060 --> 00:48:35.510
and negative backlash.

00:48:36.650 --> 00:48:40.040
My interest in living with diversity

00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:42.840
is very different from Sauer's concern

00:48:42.840 --> 00:48:45.750
for conserving diversity.

00:48:45.750 --> 00:48:47.980
Or at least preserving the viability

00:48:47.980 --> 00:48:50.290
of distinct rural life ways.

00:48:51.210 --> 00:48:54.110
The hyper diverse places I've described

00:48:54.110 --> 00:48:57.260
are relatively new
sociocultural phenomenon,

00:48:57.260 --> 00:48:59.840
but since they're growing and occurring

00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:01.940
in many of the global command centers

00:49:01.940 --> 00:49:03.390
of the world economy,

00:49:03.390 --> 00:49:06.040
making them work is of keen importance.

00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:11.000
Sauer's interest in cultural
diffusion was quite specific

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.090
in that he saw domesticated
plants and animals

00:49:13.090 --> 00:49:15.750
as historically meaningful
cultural products

00:49:15.750 --> 00:49:18.320
that diffused widely and in the process

00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:21.010
reshaped the biophysical
and cultural landscape.

00:49:22.170 --> 00:49:24.520
In terms of human migration,

00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:27.800
the early Spanish main by Sauer documents

00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:31.110
with devastating precision the impact

00:49:31.110 --> 00:49:34.714
of Spanish colonization on
the peoples of Hispaniola.

00:49:34.714 --> 00:49:39.700
Conquests, slavery, disease,
and demographic collapse

00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:42.170
within 50 years of Spanish arrival.

00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:46.310
Consequently for Sauer,
there was no upside

00:49:46.310 --> 00:49:49.210
to this migrant-led form
of cultural diffusion

00:49:49.210 --> 00:49:50.850
and demographic collapse.

00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:55.250
The cultural practices that
immigrants bring with them

00:49:55.250 --> 00:50:00.180
are complex, multifaceted
and difficult to pin down.

00:50:00.180 --> 00:50:02.780
Yet the cultural anchors
migrants move with

00:50:02.780 --> 00:50:06.316
motivate all kinds of
social and economic networks

00:50:06.316 --> 00:50:09.570
as well as identity
performances that persist

00:50:09.570 --> 00:50:12.700
in interesting and
sometimes unexpected ways

00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:14.450
in places of destination.

00:50:16.330 --> 00:50:19.260
One way I've tried to
appreciate this cultural malage

00:50:19.260 --> 00:50:20.270
is through mapping.

00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:24.860
It isn't perfect and perhaps
too empirical for some.

00:50:24.860 --> 00:50:27.760
But it is an intuitive
tool that can be used

00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:30.770
to elicit process as well as pattern.

00:50:31.890 --> 00:50:34.280
Put a street map in front
of a group of people,

00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:36.160
immigrants or native-born,

00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:38.360
and some sticky dots, and ask them,

00:50:38.360 --> 00:50:41.100
where would you like to live, and why?

00:50:41.100 --> 00:50:42.920
Or where would you not like to live?

00:50:43.820 --> 00:50:45.330
What makes a good neighborhood or

00:50:45.330 --> 00:50:47.330
a right place to establish a business?

00:50:48.180 --> 00:50:51.070
These simple exercises can reveal starkly

00:50:51.070 --> 00:50:53.650
different understandings
of space and place

00:50:53.650 --> 00:50:55.500
and culturally diverse settings

00:50:55.500 --> 00:50:57.190
where many of us live.

00:50:57.190 --> 00:50:58.680
And these can be especially helpful

00:50:58.680 --> 00:51:00.530
in working towards greater inclusion.

00:51:02.370 --> 00:51:04.140
As for the cultural landscape,

00:51:04.140 --> 00:51:06.930
it is a fickle guide to cultural change

00:51:06.930 --> 00:51:08.490
with regards to immigration.

00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:12.440
That is, it can hide as
much as it can reveal.

00:51:13.550 --> 00:51:15.170
Yet I found that paying attention

00:51:15.170 --> 00:51:18.520
to the built environment
and the relative visibility

00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:21.960
or invisibility of immigrant
communities within it

00:51:21.960 --> 00:51:25.290
has opened up ways for understanding

00:51:25.290 --> 00:51:28.000
how we live with diversity,

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:32.930
and as we struggle to construct
more inclusive cities.

00:51:32.930 --> 00:51:33.998
Thank you very much.

00:51:33.998 --> 00:51:36.998
(audience applauds)

00:51:44.950 --> 00:51:46.860
- [Emcee] We do have
time for some questions

00:51:46.860 --> 00:51:47.830
if anybody would like

00:51:47.830 --> 00:51:50.210
and we do have a
microphone to pass around.

00:51:50.210 --> 00:51:52.030
Anybody wanna ask any questions

00:51:52.030 --> 00:51:53.580
or make some comments?

00:51:53.580 --> 00:51:54.660
- [Audience Member 1] Great talk, Marie.

00:51:54.660 --> 00:51:57.680
I'm wondering with
communities that do aggregate,

00:51:57.680 --> 00:51:59.700
if you find another level of aggregation

00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:02.580
based on region or ethnicity, for example,

00:52:02.580 --> 00:52:05.133
do the Bolivians who are
native Quechuan speakers

00:52:05.133 --> 00:52:07.290
tend to live somewhere different from

00:52:07.290 --> 00:52:09.340
those who are Spanish or Aymara speakers?

00:52:13.530 --> 00:52:15.130
- [Marie] The linguistic isolation's

00:52:15.130 --> 00:52:17.830
a really interesting one and you can find,

00:52:17.830 --> 00:52:20.070
but in general, I find no,

00:52:20.070 --> 00:52:21.710
that actually most of
the speakers who come

00:52:21.710 --> 00:52:24.450
are either Spanish or Quechuan speakers

00:52:24.450 --> 00:52:26.370
and we don't have many Aymara speakers.

00:52:26.370 --> 00:52:28.260
But I mean, if you start
looking at language

00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:32.430
and some of the ACS data,
you can tease that out,

00:52:32.430 --> 00:52:36.370
but what I've found, the
separation in Bolivians,

00:52:36.370 --> 00:52:37.950
and I've mapped this quite a bit,

00:52:37.950 --> 00:52:41.830
is that it's often
between class differences

00:52:41.830 --> 00:52:45.040
and also time of arrival.

00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:47.230
So there's this perception
of the newcomers

00:52:47.230 --> 00:52:49.060
versus the old guard, and it's probably

00:52:49.060 --> 00:52:51.380
when they are able to buy homes

00:52:51.380 --> 00:52:53.510
and afford to live and that shifts.

00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:57.810
But you could definitely
move down in scale

00:52:57.810 --> 00:52:59.580
in terms of region of origin, language,

00:52:59.580 --> 00:53:02.450
and really come up with some
different patterns, I'm sure.

00:53:02.450 --> 00:53:04.090
Especially for the Indians,

00:53:04.090 --> 00:53:06.360
and I'm still waiting to dig into that.

00:53:08.110 --> 00:53:08.943
- [Audience Member 2] I'm curious, Marie,

00:53:08.943 --> 00:53:12.060
how important is religious affiliation,

00:53:12.060 --> 00:53:13.940
particularly for sort of evangelic

00:53:13.940 --> 00:53:15.630
or fundamentalist communities?

00:53:17.170 --> 00:53:19.510
- [Marie] You know, I
haven't looked at religion

00:53:19.510 --> 00:53:22.460
and I should, but certainly,

00:53:24.230 --> 00:53:27.330
Central Americans are
very strongly evangelical

00:53:27.330 --> 00:53:29.450
and they often form their own churches

00:53:29.450 --> 00:53:32.460
and have very clear transnational linkages

00:53:32.460 --> 00:53:35.070
and direct flow so on one level,

00:53:35.070 --> 00:53:36.660
you can look at the Catholic Church,

00:53:36.660 --> 00:53:41.660
which probably has benefited
enormously from immigration.

00:53:41.960 --> 00:53:46.470
Especially Latino, Filipino,
Vietnamese Catholics.

00:53:47.890 --> 00:53:51.700
And that is, but there's also,

00:53:51.700 --> 00:53:53.530
my colleague Elizabeth
Chaco's worked a lot

00:53:53.530 --> 00:53:56.060
on Ethiopians, there's
the Coptic Christians,

00:53:56.060 --> 00:53:59.440
and they form their own churches, and so,

00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:03.150
while country of origin
is a convenient start

00:54:03.150 --> 00:54:06.360
for diversity, you can
slice and dice at religion.

00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:10.730
There's a group that have
tried to look at religious

00:54:10.730 --> 00:54:15.155
mapping and where churches
are, and synagogues and temples

00:54:15.155 --> 00:54:17.750
as a way to understand the complexity.

00:54:17.750 --> 00:54:19.980
The thing that always
amazes me in Washington

00:54:19.980 --> 00:54:21.830
because we have a large Korean population,

00:54:21.830 --> 00:54:24.300
we had huge Korean churches,

00:54:24.300 --> 00:54:25.750
and they are very well attended,

00:54:25.750 --> 00:54:28.880
so I think like, to get
at the Korean Baptists,

00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:31.010
in particular, that's really powerful.

00:54:31.960 --> 00:54:34.740
Bolivians, my feeling and experience is,

00:54:34.740 --> 00:54:36.020
they don't go to church so much.

00:54:36.020 --> 00:54:37.347
They like soccer better.

00:54:37.347 --> 00:54:38.180
(audience laughs)

00:54:38.180 --> 00:54:40.370
So soccer was clearly the place to go

00:54:40.370 --> 00:54:41.780
to learn what was going on.

00:54:44.306 --> 00:54:45.180
There's a couple hands back there.

00:54:46.304 --> 00:54:47.290
- [Audience Member 3]
Yes thank you. Pardon me.

00:54:47.290 --> 00:54:48.910
Thank you very much.

00:54:48.910 --> 00:54:52.010
Some time ago, I found a old study,

00:54:52.010 --> 00:54:54.880
that I guess now at the
time was quite well known,

00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:56.810
was really a confluence study

00:54:56.810 --> 00:54:58.830
of the working class communities,

00:54:58.830 --> 00:54:59.663
which is a sociological,

00:54:59.663 --> 00:55:02.720
rather than anthropological,
or geographical,

00:55:02.720 --> 00:55:05.910
at least not self-consciously
either of those.

00:55:05.910 --> 00:55:10.300
And he, this was Chicago in the 50s,

00:55:10.300 --> 00:55:11.830
so we're talking about all the residue

00:55:11.830 --> 00:55:14.630
of Eastern Europeans or Southern Europeans

00:55:14.630 --> 00:55:17.240
who are still Eastern European
and Southern European.

00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:19.970
And one of the interesting things was,

00:55:19.970 --> 00:55:24.850
this was a time of industrial prosperity.

00:55:24.850 --> 00:55:27.200
The steel mills were rolling along,

00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:29.342
I don't know the exact ups and downs,

00:55:29.342 --> 00:55:31.150
economically at the time,

00:55:31.150 --> 00:55:34.390
but one of the key places of negotiation

00:55:34.390 --> 00:55:36.800
between the different
groups was the workplace,

00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:39.560
and sort of large industrial places

00:55:39.560 --> 00:55:43.380
with a lot of internal
technical division of labor.

00:55:43.380 --> 00:55:45.280
So there's all these fights about

00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:46.190
who's going to be the foreman

00:55:46.190 --> 00:55:48.140
and who's going to work under whom,

00:55:48.140 --> 00:55:50.530
and they, according to Kornblume's

00:55:50.530 --> 00:55:52.680
rather rosy picture of it,

00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:55.110
is just, you know, burley
guys working it out,

00:55:55.110 --> 00:55:58.140
so to speak, and also,

00:55:59.910 --> 00:56:02.360
the religious area too,

00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:04.980
because there's a mix of, you know,

00:56:04.980 --> 00:56:09.010
Orthodoxy and Catholicity,

00:56:09.010 --> 00:56:10.460
that is also another place

00:56:10.460 --> 00:56:12.210
because there's only so many churches

00:56:12.210 --> 00:56:14.340
and you've gotta sort of, once again,

00:56:14.340 --> 00:56:15.280
negotiate it in the church.

00:56:15.280 --> 00:56:16.569
So I was wondering about,

00:56:16.569 --> 00:56:19.740
you know I keep hearing
that in your presentation,

00:56:19.740 --> 00:56:22.800
we looked at a lot of residential areas,

00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:26.044
and I think in the suburbs
they don't mix it up too much,

00:56:26.044 --> 00:56:30.710
but I wanted to know more
about that. Thank you.

00:56:30.710 --> 00:56:32.810
- [Marie] Well, two responses.

00:56:32.810 --> 00:56:34.300
One of the curious things is,

00:56:34.300 --> 00:56:36.560
in the near-in suburbs and the cities,

00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:39.560
a lot of churches,
different congregations,

00:56:39.560 --> 00:56:42.384
have really lost their,

00:56:42.384 --> 00:56:45.220
the base of their congregations.

00:56:45.220 --> 00:56:46.770
So what often happens is that

00:56:46.770 --> 00:56:49.620
the churches in a sense rent out space,

00:56:49.620 --> 00:56:52.850
or appeal to a diversity of immigrants,

00:56:52.850 --> 00:56:55.330
and so you might have a congregation

00:56:55.330 --> 00:56:57.450
that offers religious services

00:56:57.450 --> 00:56:58.860
in seven or eight languages

00:56:58.860 --> 00:57:00.420
and the different groups come in.

00:57:00.420 --> 00:57:03.480
And so you can have groups
sharing the same space

00:57:03.480 --> 00:57:05.270
but coming in at different times.

00:57:05.270 --> 00:57:10.270
So how integrative it
is is not, it's limited.

00:57:10.300 --> 00:57:11.970
In terms of employment,

00:57:13.050 --> 00:57:16.270
some work I've looked at
immigrant entrepreneurship,

00:57:16.270 --> 00:57:18.450
in general, immigrants are more likely

00:57:18.450 --> 00:57:22.340
to be self-employed than the native-born.

00:57:22.340 --> 00:57:24.400
And there's reasons for that,

00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:26.040
you know being excluded from the workforce

00:57:26.040 --> 00:57:28.300
in some ways and also maybe a desire

00:57:28.300 --> 00:57:29.750
to create your own business.

00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:33.210
But in the case of Bolivians,

00:57:33.210 --> 00:57:34.500
where I've just written a piece

00:57:34.500 --> 00:57:36.114
on immigrant entrepreneurship
in Washington,

00:57:36.114 --> 00:57:39.380
they had twice a rate of entrepreneurship

00:57:39.380 --> 00:57:42.040
than other Hispanics in the area,

00:57:42.040 --> 00:57:44.700
and they're really good
at opening a business.

00:57:44.700 --> 00:57:46.130
Say, we're gonna do drywall.

00:57:46.130 --> 00:57:48.221
Now drywall's not a lot of fun.

00:57:48.221 --> 00:57:49.054
(audience laughs)

00:57:49.054 --> 00:57:49.887
I don't know if any of
you have done drywall,

00:57:49.887 --> 00:57:51.120
they're heavy sheets.

00:57:51.120 --> 00:57:53.150
But then they just bring in a stream

00:57:53.150 --> 00:57:55.030
of young guys from the country.

00:57:55.030 --> 00:57:56.956
There's a boss that organizes it,

00:57:56.956 --> 00:57:59.230
there's a lot of trust,

00:57:59.230 --> 00:58:02.410
maybe some self-exploitation
amongst co-ethnics,

00:58:02.410 --> 00:58:05.270
and they get their drywall
business up and running.

00:58:06.600 --> 00:58:08.124
Women have really cornered the market

00:58:08.124 --> 00:58:13.124
in these very, kind of
cutesy, domestic services.

00:58:13.730 --> 00:58:16.020
One, it's got about 45 Bolivian women,

00:58:16.020 --> 00:58:20.170
called Maid in America, M-A-I-D.

00:58:21.720 --> 00:58:22.860
Makes me smile.

00:58:22.860 --> 00:58:26.010
So they run around in
little Toyota Corollas

00:58:26.010 --> 00:58:27.650
and do their cleaning services,

00:58:27.650 --> 00:58:29.100
but it's all Bolivian.

00:58:29.100 --> 00:58:31.150
Occasionally they'll let in an outsider,

00:58:31.150 --> 00:58:33.348
say a Peruvian or Guatemalan,

00:58:33.348 --> 00:58:36.130
but it's very interesting how the ethnic,

00:58:36.130 --> 00:58:38.080
you know, there is, you know,

00:58:38.080 --> 00:58:40.860
as people stay and integrate,

00:58:40.860 --> 00:58:44.470
or certainly, by the second
generation or young children,

00:58:44.470 --> 00:58:46.360
there's probably a lot
more crossing the lines.

00:58:46.360 --> 00:58:48.130
But I think when you first arrive,

00:58:48.130 --> 00:58:51.100
there's a real tendency
to stick with your own.

00:58:52.280 --> 00:58:53.113
Yes.

00:58:54.023 --> 00:58:55.300
- [Audience Member 4] Thanks a lot, Marie,

00:58:55.300 --> 00:58:58.920
for bringing us some geographic
concepts to migration

00:58:58.920 --> 00:59:01.482
that we don't get enough of, I think.

00:59:01.482 --> 00:59:03.790
Couple of questions. One is,

00:59:03.790 --> 00:59:04.800
could you tell us a little bit

00:59:04.800 --> 00:59:07.210
about when migration kicks off

00:59:07.210 --> 00:59:08.460
from the Valle Alto?

00:59:09.530 --> 00:59:12.100
What period, what kicks it off?

00:59:12.100 --> 00:59:14.190
And then as far as the connections

00:59:14.190 --> 00:59:16.370
to the Washington DC area,

00:59:16.370 --> 00:59:19.170
what is, what draws the pioneers there?

00:59:19.170 --> 00:59:23.240
What is the initial hook there? Thanks.

00:59:23.240 --> 00:59:24.073
- [Marie] Great.

00:59:26.030 --> 00:59:28.790
So people in the Valle
Alto started migrating

00:59:28.790 --> 00:59:32.720
in the 20s, but they weren't
going to North America.

00:59:33.717 --> 00:59:37.740
An early movement to Chile
and then also Argentina.

00:59:37.740 --> 00:59:39.400
That was clearly the big destination

00:59:39.400 --> 00:59:40.980
and it would be much more,

00:59:40.980 --> 00:59:43.470
a bus ride to Argentina,
kind of a long bus ride,

00:59:43.470 --> 00:59:44.960
and coming back and forth.

00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:46.570
Maybe staying there for several years

00:59:46.570 --> 00:59:50.660
and then coming back.

00:59:51.710 --> 00:59:53.810
I've met some people that
literally call themselves

00:59:53.810 --> 00:59:56.340
pioneers that went to the US.

00:59:56.340 --> 01:00:00.610
And these first pioneers
came in the 1960s,

01:00:00.610 --> 01:00:02.660
late 60s, early 70s,

01:00:02.660 --> 01:00:05.630
one of them came as a young woman,

01:00:05.630 --> 01:00:07.290
worked as a domestic,

01:00:07.290 --> 01:00:09.970
eventually got a college degree,

01:00:09.970 --> 01:00:11.470
her daughter went to Harvard,

01:00:11.470 --> 01:00:15.320
and now is the only elected
Bolivian official in the US.

01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:19.300
She was elected by the
Arlington County school board.

01:00:19.300 --> 01:00:21.380
Emma Violand-Sanchez.

01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:24.080
And she tells this, you know,

01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:27.240
the rags to riches story
that will just make you cry.

01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:29.850
She is a believer in what can happen,

01:00:29.850 --> 01:00:34.640
these transformations and
opportunities that happen.

01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:37.330
But most of the Bolivians
really started coming

01:00:37.330 --> 01:00:41.180
in the early 80s and
Bolivia was in terrible

01:00:41.180 --> 01:00:44.330
economic free fall, hyper inflation.

01:00:44.330 --> 01:00:47.210
And then Argentina wasn't
looking so good either.

01:00:47.210 --> 01:00:49.490
So this notion of,

01:00:49.490 --> 01:00:51.130
we'd better try someplace new,

01:00:51.130 --> 01:00:52.330
somebody knew somebody,

01:00:52.330 --> 01:00:55.000
and then the classic
kind of chain migration.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:59.670
Then very clearly, even before 9/11,

01:00:59.670 --> 01:01:02.960
when Operation Gatekeeper
went in in '96, '97,

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:04.510
it got a lot harder,

01:01:04.510 --> 01:01:06.980
because many people from the Valle Alto,

01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:08.350
they just look at where they're from,

01:01:08.350 --> 01:01:10.410
and they're never given a visa.

01:01:10.410 --> 01:01:12.240
They just assume they're
intended migrants,

01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:15.060
so then they will often come illegally.

01:01:15.060 --> 01:01:16.800
And it's very expensive.

01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:19.320
$15000, it's a lot of money.

01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:22.250
You've gotta work that debt off.

01:01:22.250 --> 01:01:24.820
So then the promised land became Spain,

01:01:24.820 --> 01:01:29.110
and there are twice as
many Bolivians in Spain now

01:01:29.110 --> 01:01:30.540
than in the United States.

01:01:31.610 --> 01:01:34.970
And they really poured into
Spain for several years.

01:01:34.970 --> 01:01:37.030
And then a few other places.

01:01:37.030 --> 01:01:39.960
Italy's got quite a few,
so what's interesting,

01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:43.510
you know, unlike the
Mexican immigration story,

01:01:43.510 --> 01:01:45.900
it's overwhelmingly to the US,

01:01:45.900 --> 01:01:49.130
what is it, 96, 97% of
Mexicans who emigrate

01:01:49.130 --> 01:01:49.963
come to the US.

01:01:50.910 --> 01:01:52.850
Bolivia's obviously much smaller,

01:01:52.850 --> 01:01:55.590
proportionally it has a
very large emigrant stream,

01:01:55.590 --> 01:01:58.580
but they've always gone
to a variety of places.

01:01:58.580 --> 01:02:00.430
Both within South America and Europe.

01:02:00.430 --> 01:02:03.790
There's even an interesting flow to Japan

01:02:03.790 --> 01:02:07.890
because Bolivia received
something like 100 Japanese,

01:02:07.890 --> 01:02:10.310
you know, when the Brazilian,

01:02:10.310 --> 01:02:11.480
mostly they were going to Brazil,

01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:14.920
and then if you could
somehow prove ancestry,

01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:16.710
you can get to Japan.

01:02:16.710 --> 01:02:18.820
So the embassy estimates there's

01:02:18.820 --> 01:02:22.120
like 2000 Bolivian Japanese,

01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:25.370
we say that with
quotation marks, in Japan,

01:02:25.370 --> 01:02:28.220
because they're probably
not ethnically Japanese

01:02:28.220 --> 01:02:30.290
but they somehow proved that.

01:02:31.460 --> 01:02:35.280
So that strategy, and I think right now,

01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:37.090
there's, the flows are not,

01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:39.810
illegal flows are very small,

01:02:41.150 --> 01:02:43.080
because it's so hard and expensive.

01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:46.290
And there's also been a pretty
significant deportation.

01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:50.180
I was looking at some statistics

01:02:50.180 --> 01:02:54.690
and the Obama administration has deported

01:02:54.690 --> 01:02:57.090
more people than any other President,

01:02:57.930 --> 01:02:59.790
any other presidential administration,

01:02:59.790 --> 01:03:01.460
still got another year to go.

01:03:01.460 --> 01:03:03.540
I don't think that was
totally intentional.

01:03:03.540 --> 01:03:07.740
It was about the changes
in secure communities

01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:10.120
but we're not just talking
stopping people at the borders,

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:13.410
these are deportations of people
who've lived several years.

01:03:13.410 --> 01:03:15.140
And it's wrenching.

01:03:15.140 --> 01:03:16.870
I've been to fundraisers when

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:19.950
you know, basically what happens,

01:03:19.950 --> 01:03:22.130
dad drives to work, dad gets stopped,

01:03:22.130 --> 01:03:24.220
dad doesn't have a driver's license

01:03:24.220 --> 01:03:26.710
because you can't get one
if you're undocumented.

01:03:26.710 --> 01:03:27.640
Dad is arrested.

01:03:28.570 --> 01:03:30.580
Dad's detained for months

01:03:30.580 --> 01:03:31.910
and the family's stuck.

01:03:33.270 --> 01:03:34.450
Kids might be Americans

01:03:34.450 --> 01:03:39.350
so that deportation story is obviously

01:03:39.350 --> 01:03:41.600
a kind of a national deflection strategy.

01:03:42.730 --> 01:03:47.510
But it's plays out all the
time in the Latino media.

01:03:47.510 --> 01:03:50.520
We don't hear it as
much in the Anglo media.

01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:54.240
But estimates are that one
in four Latinos in the US

01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:59.110
know someone who has
been deported or will be.

01:04:00.220 --> 01:04:04.090
And that's a really sad figure but it's,

01:04:04.090 --> 01:04:06.220
it plays up at least in the work

01:04:06.220 --> 01:04:07.200
I've been doing in Washington,

01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:09.870
how immigrants perceive
their opportunities.

01:04:09.870 --> 01:04:12.265
I think it merely means
the economic challenges

01:04:12.265 --> 01:04:14.900
with the recession is just,

01:04:14.900 --> 01:04:16.600
coming here is not so appealing.

01:04:18.370 --> 01:04:19.203
Greg?

01:04:20.740 --> 01:04:21.950
Use the microphone.

01:04:21.950 --> 01:04:23.250
(audience member mumbles)

01:04:23.250 --> 01:04:25.031
This is also my brother.

01:04:25.031 --> 01:04:25.864
(audience laughs)

01:04:25.864 --> 01:04:26.900
- [Marie's Brother] So I was looking

01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:29.670
at the economic examples,

01:04:29.670 --> 01:04:32.450
the economic examples from
Prince William County,

01:04:32.450 --> 01:04:33.283
two questions.

01:04:33.283 --> 01:04:37.107
How well known in that
community were those

01:04:37.107 --> 01:04:40.490
in the economic consequences
of the immigration policy.

01:04:40.490 --> 01:04:43.120
And looking at what's happening in Alabama

01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:45.220
and earlier in Arizona,

01:04:45.220 --> 01:04:49.069
what could our elected officials
learn from geographers?

01:04:49.069 --> 01:04:49.902
- [Marie] Hmm.

01:04:49.902 --> 01:04:51.300
(audience laughs)

01:04:51.300 --> 01:04:53.017
Thank you for that policy question.

01:04:53.017 --> 01:04:54.420
(audience laughs)

01:04:54.420 --> 01:04:57.600
So in Prince William County,

01:04:57.600 --> 01:04:59.460
and as people have looked at the data,

01:04:59.460 --> 01:05:03.300
it's very hard to tease out
the impacts of the recession,

01:05:03.300 --> 01:05:06.930
which was coming on at the same time.

01:05:06.930 --> 01:05:10.740
But and there was also a lot
of home foreclosures there,

01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:12.390
especially among Hispanics,

01:05:12.390 --> 01:05:15.570
and was that because they
just decided to walk away

01:05:15.570 --> 01:05:17.200
because of the political environment?

01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:19.300
The political environment was really ugly.

01:05:21.352 --> 01:05:22.710
And I went to a couple meetings

01:05:22.710 --> 01:05:24.420
and it was terrifying.

01:05:24.420 --> 01:05:27.970
It really had this mob quality of people

01:05:27.970 --> 01:05:29.964
just inciting, saying outrageous things,

01:05:29.964 --> 01:05:31.230
from both sides.

01:05:32.790 --> 01:05:35.830
So one of the things
that I learned from that.

01:05:35.830 --> 01:05:37.580
I went and interviewed the sheriff,

01:05:37.580 --> 01:05:39.220
who had to enforce those.

01:05:39.220 --> 01:05:40.840
And I asked him, you know,

01:05:41.780 --> 01:05:44.570
let's say, tomorrow
legislation was changed

01:05:44.570 --> 01:05:46.740
and everybody that came undocumented,

01:05:46.740 --> 01:05:49.650
which was the target of
their search, became legal,

01:05:49.650 --> 01:05:51.310
what would that mean to you?

01:05:51.310 --> 01:05:53.890
And he said, it would make
my life so much easier.

01:05:53.890 --> 01:05:56.170
This is a really hard thing to do.

01:05:56.170 --> 01:05:57.630
We can't police this way.

01:05:59.390 --> 01:06:02.150
And to me, the lesson from Prince Williams

01:06:02.150 --> 01:06:04.520
was that it, again it often happens,

01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:06.620
it was really one or two politicians

01:06:06.620 --> 01:06:09.240
that saw an opportunity to play on fears

01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:10.790
and prejudices and run with it.

01:06:11.840 --> 01:06:13.900
So that is one lesson.

01:06:13.900 --> 01:06:17.250
In terms of Alabama, I don't get it.

01:06:17.250 --> 01:06:20.140
It's not like Alabama has a lot
of immigrants to begin with,

01:06:20.140 --> 01:06:25.140
but I do think it plays
upon a general feeling

01:06:25.140 --> 01:06:29.460
of all immigration is somehow
tainted with illegality now

01:06:29.460 --> 01:06:32.340
because of the, the deadlock we're in.

01:06:32.340 --> 01:06:33.560
You know, there has been,

01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:35.580
people have been saying
immigration reform is coming,

01:06:35.580 --> 01:06:36.620
it's coming, it's coming,

01:06:36.620 --> 01:06:37.550
it's not coming.

01:06:38.540 --> 01:06:41.500
And so, states and jurisdictions think,

01:06:41.500 --> 01:06:43.152
well, this is the way we act,

01:06:43.152 --> 01:06:48.152
and I'm not sure Alabama can
go much lower economically,

01:06:49.110 --> 01:06:53.690
so that's you know, hard to
really, you know, compete.

01:06:53.690 --> 01:06:56.990
But Arizona, I think there is some pretty

01:06:56.990 --> 01:07:00.130
convincing evidence that it's
having economic implications

01:07:00.130 --> 01:07:02.500
but at the same time,

01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:04.960
you know, if you really
believe that immigration

01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:08.230
is making your place worse,

01:07:08.230 --> 01:07:10.370
then you're gonna need to martial evidence

01:07:10.370 --> 01:07:13.090
that will support that, and people do.

01:07:16.439 --> 01:07:17.272
- [Emcee] I think that was probably,

01:07:17.272 --> 01:07:18.780
unless somebody has
another burning question,

01:07:18.780 --> 01:07:21.280
it's probably the last question,

01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:24.380
what can geographers offer
to politics in a good way,

01:07:24.380 --> 01:07:26.840
for us to all reflect on,

01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:29.580
and also think about the ways in which

01:07:29.580 --> 01:07:32.210
Marie has so creatively used some of these

01:07:32.210 --> 01:07:34.690
Sauerian concepts to engage us

01:07:34.690 --> 01:07:37.000
in something of everyday concern.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:38.640
We thank you enormously.

01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:42.460
Please join us for refreshments
just in the atrium here,

01:07:42.460 --> 01:07:44.244
and thanks again, Marie.

01:07:44.244 --> 01:07:45.777

- [Marie] Thank you.

01:07:48.321 --> 01:07:50.904
