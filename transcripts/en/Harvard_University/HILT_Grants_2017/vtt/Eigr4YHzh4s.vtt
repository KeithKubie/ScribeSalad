00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:08.020
My project is about trying
to do a flipped classroom

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:09.760
in a humanities context.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.520
I was really excited by
it, because it gave me

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.860
an opportunity to
make my pedagogy align

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.660
with my stated goals of what
learning about and teaching

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:20.980
philosophy is.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.080
Because it is not a
body of subtle doctrine

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.870
that the students are
supposed to simply internalize

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:27.490
and perhaps admire.

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:32.820
It's supposed to be
a tool for learning

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.430
and a tool for self-development.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.950
And students can only do
that if they are actually

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.110
actively engaged in the
classroom, as opposed

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.160
to being the passive
recipients of some knowledge

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.110
from the professor.

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.870
The big challenge for
people in the humanities

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.480
is that, of course, there
are no clear answers

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.580
to any of the questions
that we investigate.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.790
And so it's very
challenging to try

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.600
to identify tasks or
activities that the students

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.620
can perform in class that are
directed enough so that they

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:09.150
make progress but do not
misrepresent the subject

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.670
matter so that everything
seems to be much more

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.150
clear-cut than it actually is.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.880
So I've always been
really interested

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.150
in the idea of a flipped
classroom in the humanities.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.360
Because-- this is certainly
true in philosophy,

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.420
but I imagine that this is
true of other humanities fields

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.500
as well--

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.990
we do not want the
students to simply

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.540
be passive recipients
of settled knowledge,

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.720
or to simply think
of what we can convey

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.310
to them as a number of doctrines
that they can repeat back

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:41.000
to us.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.440
Instead, we want these materials
to be things and artifacts

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.210
that they can
engage with actively

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.190
to shape their own
thinking and to develop

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.680
as thinkers in their own right.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.320
But, of course, it's
very hard to do this

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.140
if the students aren't actively
engaged in the classroom.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.140
So I've always been very excited
about this very general idea.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.170
But I've always also
been very scared

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.990
of trying to implement
it in the classroom,

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.780
because in the
humanities, our questions

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.180
don't have clear-cut
answers, which

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.830
makes it very hard to generate
activities that students can

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.740
pursue in a classroom,
get feedback on,

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:25.320
and still not misrepresent
our fields as being much more

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.300
clear-cut, or much
more simpleminded,

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.130
than they actually are.

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.780
The HILT grant gave
me an opportunity

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.340
to pursue a pedagogical
strategy that I'd

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.020
learned about at a
conference and thought

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.070
had a lot of potential.

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.460
But I couldn't quite see how
to implement it in my class.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.100
So with the funds
that HILT gave me,

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.120
I was able to go to some
training workshops that

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.470
allowed me to look in detail
at how that kind of strategy

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.440
had been implemented in other
areas and at other schools.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.870
And it allowed me to hire
some graduate students

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.740
to work with me on developing
a course with this methodology.

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.000
I taught the course that I
designed as a classroom twice.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.860
I taught it once in
the summer school.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.930
And then I'm just
about to finish

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.180
teaching it for the first
time in the college.

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.320
And going through the course
twice in detail with students

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.200
in the classroom
under real conditions

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.810
was incredibly informative.

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:28.960
It gave me many points for me
to focus on moving forward.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.970
Not just if, but when I
teach this course again

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.220
next fall, there will
be a lot of changes

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.110
that I'll be able
to make because I've

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.000
gone through the process.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.500
The other thing
that has done really

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.250
well is I've been able to
work very closely with some

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:43.630
of my graduate students.

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.930
And that's been great.

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.130
I also believe that the
course on its own terms

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.140
has been quite successful.

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.530
Students are much more engaged
with the course materials.

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.690
They report on
mid-term evaluations,

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.480
for instance, that
the methodology that

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.100
asks them to perform
tasks in class as teams

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.640
incentivizes them to
actually do the readings.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.080
Sometimes they say this
with a note of surprise.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.300
I can also tell, just
from my own perspective

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.200
in grading students'
papers, that their level

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.390
of understanding is
much deeper than it

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:23.390
was in past iterations of the
course, where the students were

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:30.880
simply there as an
audience for a lecture.

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:36.140
One change that I think
is absolutely essential

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:39.190
is that when students
go through a classroom

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.900
and through class experience
from day-to-day where

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.960
the class is broken up into
many small parts, where

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.780
the professor might present
material for 5 to 10 minutes,

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.290
they perform a task.

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.080
There's a debrief of that task.

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.330
Then there is, again,
the professor presenting

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.510
something else, another
task, another debrief.

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:58.700
It's sometimes hard
for students to see

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.850
exactly what the point of each
element of the lecture is.

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.360
Whereas, if a person simply
gives a 53-minute lecture,

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.850
or a 60- or 70-minute
lecture, there

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:10.870
is a natural arc
in the narrative.

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.020
One of the things that I didn't
emphasize enough this time

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.620
around, and that I want to make
sure I emphasize next time,

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.220
is always showing the students
what the narrative is.

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.360
What did we learn
from this task?

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.670
Especially given that,
as I mentioned before,

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:30.820
the tasks themselves don't
issue any clear verdicts

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.940
on any matter of
philosophical importance.

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.490
So in general, in philosophy,
there's always the question,

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:39.490
what are we getting out
of this, since we're not

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.740
settling the issue of what
the best way to live is,

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.780
for instance?

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:45.550
And I think this
is only exacerbated

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.390
by this kind of methodology.

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:53.160
Correspondingly, if I want to
spend time on giving students

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.320
a sense of what the
narrative of a single class

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.200
session or of a module of the
course or the course as a whole

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:01.440
is, it means that
something else has to go.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.060
And I think, even
though I tried to be

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.000
very aware of the
trade-off between covering

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.770
in-depth and covering
a lot of material

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:12.320
by exposing students
to it, I still

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:17.480
think I went too far in trying
to cover too much material.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.220
So I sometimes ran out of time.

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.370
I didn't give enough time to
the students, or to myself,

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:25.270
to do this kind of
meta cognitive work.

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:27.580
I proposed the
project to HILT. There

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.200
was a certain kind of outcome.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.630
Teach a class in a certain way.

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:35.440
But one thing that allowed me to
make consistent progress on it,

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:38.470
and to make sure that
something would come out

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:43.240
of this experience, was to
stop thinking about the outcome

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.550
and only focus on the process.

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:49.360
And so it would be totally
OK if it turned out,

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.230
for instance, that in the
course of designing the class

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:57.820
and redesigning it to be a
flipped classroom, if it turned

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:02.260
out that that process
led to really insuperable

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.680
difficulties, that
itself would be

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:09.210
a really interesting result and
an important result to share.
