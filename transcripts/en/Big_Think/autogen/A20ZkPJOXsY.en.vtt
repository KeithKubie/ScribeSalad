there are very few people have actually
 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.259
there are very few people have actually
in this industry you could work for a

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269
in this industry you could work for a
 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.220
in this industry you could work for a
big pharmaceutical industry for 20 years

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230
big pharmaceutical industry for 20 years
 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.960
big pharmaceutical industry for 20 years
and may not actually get to see a drug

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:19.970
and may not actually get to see a drug
 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.179
and may not actually get to see a drug
and in its final stages or come to

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189
and in its final stages or come to
 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.830
and in its final stages or come to
market and that's very very common so

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840
market and that's very very common so
 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.140
market and that's very very common so
because it you know of all the drugs

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150
because it you know of all the drugs
 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.970
because it you know of all the drugs
that we develop all all the drugs that

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980
that we develop all all the drugs that
 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.420
that we develop all all the drugs that
come off the pipeline very very few make

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430
come off the pipeline very very few make
 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.080
come off the pipeline very very few make
it out

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090
it out
 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.680
it out
so the successes that you see are very

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690
so the successes that you see are very
 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.229
so the successes that you see are very
very few you know they're just few

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239
very few you know they're just few
 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.860
very few you know they're just few
candidates that have made it from a

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870
candidates that have made it from a
 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.170
candidates that have made it from a
thousand that started the journey and it

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180
thousand that started the journey and it
 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.170
thousand that started the journey and it
takes sometimes up to 15 years so you

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180
takes sometimes up to 15 years so you
 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.049
takes sometimes up to 15 years so you
for most cases you'd always have to

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059
for most cases you'd always have to
 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.119
for most cases you'd always have to
start with a project you know 50 years

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129
start with a project you know 50 years
 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.110
start with a project you know 50 years
prior and see it come to fruition you

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120
prior and see it come to fruition you
 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.900
prior and see it come to fruition you
know so and very few people do that so

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910
know so and very few people do that so
 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.960
know so and very few people do that so
but you tend to see this drug in

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970
but you tend to see this drug in
 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.760
but you tend to see this drug in
different stages and I have been

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770
different stages and I have been
 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.929
different stages and I have been
involved with several candidates and the

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939
involved with several candidates and the
 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.399
involved with several candidates and the
different stages of the development

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409
different stages of the development
 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.660
different stages of the development
process the candidate or drug candidate

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670
process the candidate or drug candidate
 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.990
process the candidate or drug candidate
that I we're now working with now is in

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000
that I we're now working with now is in
 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.030
that I we're now working with now is in
its final stage and it's exciting

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040
its final stage and it's exciting
 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.940
its final stage and it's exciting
because not very many people have

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950
because not very many people have
 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.609
because not very many people have
actually been able to be a part of a

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619
actually been able to be a part of a
 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.340
actually been able to be a part of a
team that would say they've seen the

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350
team that would say they've seen the
 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.319
team that would say they've seen the
last stage you know this is the filing

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329
last stage you know this is the filing
 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.080
last stage you know this is the filing
stage we've submitted you know new drug

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090
stage we've submitted you know new drug
 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.440
stage we've submitted you know new drug
application to the FDA so it's the final

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450
application to the FDA so it's the final
 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.210
application to the FDA so it's the final
stage and we're you know being you know

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220
stage and we're you know being you know
 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.490
stage and we're you know being you know
and not very many people can say they've

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500
and not very many people can say they've
 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.710
and not very many people can say they've
actually seen that so for me it's

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720
actually seen that so for me it's
 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.030
actually seen that so for me it's
exciting and it's a huge achievement
