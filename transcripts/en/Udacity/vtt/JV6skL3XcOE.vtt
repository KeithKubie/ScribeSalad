00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
This differential equation would mean that T1 decays exponentially to zero.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
We're losing a certain fraction every hour. This does not make sense.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
With this differential equation, T2 would gain from T1.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The red process would be in place, but we would never lose anything--this is not true.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
In the second differential equation, initially T2 is smaller than T1,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
meaning that this difference is negative.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The rate of change of T2 would initially at least be negative which doesn't make sense T2 has to grow.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:43.000
The first one is correct. The percentage of 10%--0.1 per hour of T2 flowing into T1

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and there is minus 10% per hour of T1 flowing out of T1

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and in a similar fashion the lower one is true as 10% per hour of T1 flowing into T2 a plus sign

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
here and there is minus 10% per hour of T2 flowing out of T2 minus.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
So actually what's of interest to us is only the difference of the temperatures. Footnote.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
So we could have been using degrees Celsius and degrees Fahrenheit all the way

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
because we're forming this difference and are not interested in the total amount

00:01:18.000 --> 09:59:59.000
of energy contained in each compartment.
