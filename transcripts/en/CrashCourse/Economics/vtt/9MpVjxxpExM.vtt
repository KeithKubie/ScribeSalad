00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:03.919
Adriene: Welcome to Crash Course Economics,
I'm Adriene Hill.

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:07.859
Jacob: And I'm Jacob Clifford, and today we're
talking about poverty and extreme poverty,

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.680
which are not easy problems to talk about,
and not easy problems to fix.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.440
Adriene: But just because the problem is
difficult doesn't mean we shouldn't try to 
understand it. So let's get into it.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:24.140
[Theme Music]

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.860
Jacob: Back in the 1990's the United Nations created 8
Millennium Development Goals, with a deadline of 2015.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.720
The goals included things like reducing child mortality,
promoting gender equality, and combating major

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.860
diseases. But the first on the list was to eradicate
extreme poverty and hunger. Now, poverty means

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.580
different things in different countries because there's
different standards of living around the world.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:51.200
In the U.S. a person is officially living in poverty
if they make less than $11,770 a year, around $32 a day.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.780
This is called the "poverty line" or "poverty threshold",
but we're gonna focus on extreme poverty, which

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:01.180
according to the U.N. is "a condition characterized by severe deprivation of basic human needs, including

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.660
food, safe drinking water, sanitation facilities, health, shelter, education and information."

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:12.179
The U.N. defines "extreme" or "absolute poverty"
as living on less than $1.25 a day. The goals

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:16.909
set by the U.N. was to reduce the number of
people living in extreme poverty by half.

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:23.840
Well, it's 2015, the results are in, and the U.N. reports
that 836 million people still live in extreme poverty.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.340
But that's down from 1.9 billion, so success.
Or at least a lot of progress. And the World

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.729
Bank predicts that by 2030 the number of people
living in extreme poverty could drop to less

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.799
than 400 million. Of course, that assumes
everything will keep improving as it has.

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:40.759
But there's an asterisk here. Climate change is
a threat to these improvements in global poverty.

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:45.799
Adriene: So we're moving in the right direction,
but we're talking about extreme poverty. Most

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:51.859
people who've been lifted out of extreme poverty
are still poor. Really poor. And being poor

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:57.979
comes with serious problems, from disease
to lack of water. Income inequality is rampant,

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.840
and one in seven people still live without
electricity.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.249
So why is extreme poverty falling? The answer
to this is really complicated. A bunch of

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:11.879
factors like better access to education, humanitarian
aid, and the policies of international organizations

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:16.980
like the U.N. have made a difference. But
the greatest contributor is globalization

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.590
and trade. The world's economies and cultures
have become more interconnected and free trade

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.710
has driven the growth of many developing economies.

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.080
Let's go to the Thought Bubble. World trade
has been growing since the end of the World

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.140
War II. Free trade agreements and technological
advances in transportation and communication

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.260
mean goods and services move around the world
more easily than ever. And we're talking everything.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.340
From shoes and bananas, to innovations and
ideas.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.300
Take mobile phones. Mobile phones are pretty
much good for everything, including reducing

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:52.349
poverty. According to economist Jeffrey Sachs,
mobile phones are the "single most transformative

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:56.970
technology" when it comes to the developing
world. Phones give people access to banking

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:02.159
and payment systems. Better access to education
and information. In some places mobile phones

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:06.860
help farmers get information and get the best
price for the stuff they're producing. Installing

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.900
cell phone towers is also a lot cheaper than
running thousands of kilometers of telephone lines.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.980
Economists call this "leapfrogging". The idea
that countries can skip straight to more efficient

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:21.829
and cost effective technologies that weren't
available in the past. International trade

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:26.959
has also created new opportunities for people
to sell their products and labor in a global

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:32.469
marketplace. There are some significant downsides
to globalized trade. But the statistician

00:03:32.469 --> 00:03:37.650
Hans Rosling made this point: "The one to
two billion poorest in the world, who don't

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:43.250
have food for the day, suffer from the worst
disease: globalization deficiency. The way

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.879
globalization is occurring could be much better,
but the worst thing is not being part of it."

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:52.400
Jacob: Thanks, Thought Bubble. So globalization
is the result of companies trying to outmaneuver

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.609
their competitors. While you search for the
cheapest place to buy shoes, companies search

00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:00.650
for the cheapest place to make those shoes.
They find the cheapest sources of leather,

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.920
dye, rubber, and of course, labor. The end
result is that labor intensive products like

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.359
shoes are often produced in countries with
the lowest wages, and the weakest regulations.

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:13.760
This process creates winners and losers. The
winners include corporations and their stockholders,

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.810
who earn more profit, but also consumers who
get products at a cheaper price. The losers

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.319
are high wage workers who used to make those
shoes, their jobs moved overseas. But what

00:04:22.319 --> 00:04:25.639
about the low wage foreign workers? Are they
winning or losing? Well, a lot of workers

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:29.600
are thrown into hazardous working conditions,
but it's also true that many workers in developing

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.520
countries are at least making more money.

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.020
These jobs pay above average wages. People
want these jobs and although the pay would

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.740
be unacceptable in developed countries, they're
often the best alternative. And the multiplier

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.560
effect means that more money is being spent
on local businesses, so these jobs create

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.479
jobs. According to the economist Paul Krugman
"The Bangladeshi apparel industry is going

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:51.500
to consist of what we would consider sweatshops,
or it wouldn't exist at all. And Bangladesh,

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.680
in particular, really really needs its apparel industry; it's
pretty much the only thing keeping its economy afloat."

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:01.080
Adriene: But not everyone agrees. Opponents
of globalization called outsourcing of jobs

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:07.199
"exploitation and oppression", a form of economic
colonialism that put profits before people.

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:12.620
A few call for protectionist policies like
higher tariffs and limitations on outsourcing.

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:19.120
But others focus on the foreign workers
themselves by demanding they receive higher wages
and more protections.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.560
The root of many arguments against globalization
is that companies don't have to follow the

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:28.660
same rules they do in developed countries.
Some developing countries have no minimum

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:32.960
wage laws. They don't have regulations that
provide safe working conditions, or protect

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:39.680
the environment. And although nearly every country
bans child labor, those laws are not always enforced.

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:45.240
But in the absence of regulation, it's still
possible workers won't be horribly mistreated.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:49.270
First, public awareness is growing, along
with pressure from the international community

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:55.610
to take steps to protect workers. For example,
the U.S. produces an annual publication called

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:00.800
"The List of Goods Produced by Child Labor
or Forced Labor". If a company is buying products

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.870
from that list, they're likely to get blasted
by officials and the media.

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:10.890
So awareness is the first step to improvement.
The second step comes from those that support

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:16.500
globalization. The pro-globalization set argued
that as developing economies grow there are

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:21.720
more opportunities for workers, which leads
to more competition for labor, and higher wages.

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:26.260
Jacob: Perhaps the strongest argument against
globalization is its lack of sustainability.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:30.860
Many experts don't think the planet can sustain
a growing global economy. Deforestation, pollution,

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:35.260
and climate change aren't gonna fix themselves.
Especially if increases in living standards

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:39.040
lead people to demand more consumer goods
like cars, and meat, and smartphones.

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:43.040
Globalization has helped millions of people
get out of extreme poverty, but the challenge

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:47.080
of the future is to lift up the poor while
at the same time keeping the planet livable.

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:51.909
Adriene: One of the best ways to help those
in extreme poverty is to enable them to participate

00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:56.520
in the economy. This applies to developing
countries in the global marketplace, but also

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.599
to individuals at the local level.

00:06:58.599 --> 00:07:04.470
A perfect example is microcredit. In 2006
a Bangladeshi professor named Muhammad Yunus

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:10.569
won the Nobel Peace Prize for implementing
a simple idea. He gave small loans, on average

00:07:10.569 --> 00:07:16.620
around $100, to low-income people in rural
areas. The borrowers, who are mostly female, often

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:21.180
used the money to fund plans that could raise their
income. For example, they started small businesses.

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:26.420
"Microcredit was a success and has since spread
to developing countries throughout the world.

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:31.540
Private lenders, governments, and nonprofit
organizations have jumped onboard to loan

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:34.590
billions of dollars to the world's most disadvantaged."

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:39.759
By itself, microcredit isn't going to solve
the problem of extreme poverty, but it supports

00:07:39.759 --> 00:07:44.580
the idea that enabling people to participate
in the economy can make their lives better.

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:50.220
Yunus explains "In my experience, poor people
are the world's greatest entrepreneurs. Every

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:55.030
day, they must innovate in order to survive.
They remain poor because they do not have

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:59.680
the opportunities to turn their creativity
into sustainable income."

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:04.349
Microcredit, when it works, allows people
to improve their lives by participating in

00:08:04.349 --> 00:08:09.319
the economy on their own terms. But we can't
forget, a lot of people who participate in

00:08:09.319 --> 00:08:14.000
the global economy aren't doing it on their
own terms. Many of the people who emerged

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.199
from extreme poverty in the last 25 years
have jobs, wages, and working conditions that

00:08:19.199 --> 00:08:21.919
would be unthinkable in the developed world.

00:08:21.919 --> 00:08:27.509
Economists say that's okay, it's progress,
but it's progress that's awfully hard to stomach.

00:08:27.509 --> 00:08:30.389
