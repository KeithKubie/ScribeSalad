00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.070
Now we want to actually start looking at the details of how a camera operates.

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.560
And we'll be specifically be talking about the details of what happens when

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.610
a camera takes a picture.

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.504
These are more photographic principles, and all I'm going to be talking about is

00:00:15.504 --> 00:00:19.235
what's referred to in the photographic circles as the exposure triangle.

00:00:19.235 --> 00:00:23.275
In an exposure triangle, a photographer controls variety of

00:00:23.275 --> 00:00:26.933
parameters that let's him or her capture the best image.

00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:29.806
The three things that are controlled are, the aperture,

00:00:29.806 --> 00:00:33.630
which is the size of the opening that actually let's the light into the sensor.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.890
The shutter speed, which is of course, the,

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.530
how fast the shutter opens and closes.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.390
And the ISO, which is the sensitivity of the sensor.

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:44.060
Most of the time,

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.280
a photographer basically attempts to optimize all of these three parameters,

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.630
that's why this is referred to as an exposure triangle, to get the best picture.

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.770
What we're interested in is learning these concepts, because we want to be

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.630
able to figure out how we're going to control these in a computational manner.
