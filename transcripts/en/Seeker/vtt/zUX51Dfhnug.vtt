00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.090
The praying mantis appears to be such a zen
and calm creature.

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:08.200
After all, the prayer is directly in it’s
name!

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:13.690
But the praying is understandable considering
any sexual encounter for the male mantis,

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:15.459
might be fatal.

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:20.039
Praying mantis’ are characterized by the
unique and specialized behavior of sexual

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.410
cannibalism.

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.641
The sperm transfer process can be quite lengthy,
so this means that it’s important for a

00:00:26.641 --> 00:00:32.400
male to occupy his female partner's’ attention
for as long as possible.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.980
More time equals more of his own sperm making
its way into her reproductive tract AND less

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.910
time for other males to have a similar chance.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.329
And one good strategy to maximize his monopoly
on a female's’ time is by letting her reach

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:51.579
back, rip off his head, and begin to consume
it.

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:57.170
Although in some cases a male might try to
escape, this may not be in his best biological

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:58.609
interest.

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:05.070
You see, while she is enjoying her appetizer,
his body continues to rhythmically pump sperm

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.380
into her body.

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.800
Once she’s done eating the head, she will
begin to consume the rest of his body, and

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:17.700
all the while his sperm continues to perform
the only task that matters to his future biological

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.400
existence.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.980
By the time a female has finished consuming
the male, there is a very good chance that

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:29.300
a significant amount of his sperm is alive
and well in her sperm storage organ, and will

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.300
be used to sire the next generation.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:37.870
Although it seems a rather severe way to attain
biological fitness, it makes sense seeing

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:43.850
as many of these males will only ever get
a few chances at copulation during their lifetimes.

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.210
Despite the fact that it’s a strategy unlike
anything close to what humans would encounter,

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.310
it seems to work well for several species
of mantis across the world.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.010
I’m sure their future offspring would thank
them for taking one for the team.

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.130
