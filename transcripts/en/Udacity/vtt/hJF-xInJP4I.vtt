00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.290
Now in this previous question,
the ratio is 1 to 2.

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.571
Sometimes you'll see such
a ratio written as 1 colon 2.

00:00:09.571 --> 00:00:12.880
And this just means the exact
same thing is 1 over 2.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.300
I actually prefer 1 over 2, because
really what we're doing is division, but

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.220
you will see this a lot and I don't
want you to be confused when you do.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.878
So, for example with 3 out of 5
dentists, this ratio is the same as 3:5,

00:00:25.878 --> 00:00:29.980
and you would read that as 3 out of 5,
or 3 to 5.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.360
And so, thinking of the examples
we've gone over so far.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.702
3 out of 5 dentists, 8 out of 10 cats,
200 out of 500 graduates,

00:00:37.702 --> 00:00:42.208
and 2 to 9 being the ratio of
color printers to total printers,

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:46.473
we could have written any of
these using our colon notation.

00:00:46.473 --> 00:00:49.321
3:5, 8:10, 200:500, 2:9.

00:00:49.321 --> 00:00:53.110
Of course, we should still simplify
when we can, but the idea is the same.

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:54.414
Let's do a little bit of practice.

00:00:54.414 --> 00:00:56.671
As I'm filming this,
it's near tax day in the United States.

00:00:56.671 --> 00:00:59.960
So 3 out of 36 forms
were filed incorrectly.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.570
I want to know,
what's the ratio in this sentence?

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.150
Enter your answer in this box, and
this time, try using colon notation.
