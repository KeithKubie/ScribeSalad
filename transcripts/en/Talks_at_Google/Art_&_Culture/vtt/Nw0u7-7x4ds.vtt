NIRDHAR KHAZANIE: And today
I have the distinct pleasure

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.080
of introducing Karsh Kale.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.243
Welcome, Karsh, to Google.

00:00:11.243 --> 00:00:12.951
KARSH KALE: Thank you
guys for having me.

00:00:12.951 --> 00:00:15.991
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:15.991 --> 00:00:18.490
NIRDHAR KHAZANIE: So Karsh, I
started playing tabla probably

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.230
when I was around 10 years old.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.944
And I remember one of
our family friends--

00:00:23.944 --> 00:00:25.360
his name is Pradeep
[? Bindhe-- ?]

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.370
he came to our hometown in
Greenville, North Carolina,

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:31.070
and then he sat down with us.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.842
And one time, at dinner, he saw
some tabla, which were there

00:00:33.842 --> 00:00:35.800
in the living room, and
then he pulled them out

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.635
and he asked my dad,
can you play tabla?

00:00:37.635 --> 00:00:38.640
Or, can I play tabla?

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.300
And I said, no, I'm
only 10 years old.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.730
So then he started playing.

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.700
And then, lo and
behold, he became

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.820
my guru, which
started off after,

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.170
like, a career with around
two years of me playing.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.600
But then I gave it up.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.660
And then I didn't even
think about how much love

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.570
and how much fascination
I have with tabla.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.090
How did you actually start
learning to play tabla

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.900
and how did that life--

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.300
KARSH KALE: Well, I mean,
tabla was always in my house.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.930
My father is very much into
Indian classical music and film

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.110
music and old Marathi folk music
and all that kind of stuff.

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.000
So since I was born, this
music was playing in my house.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.076
And he actually had tablas
in the house since--

00:01:21.076 --> 00:01:23.200
I think, since I was about
three or four years old.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.220
So I always went over, and I had
a kind of natural inclination

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.320
to the instrument.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.980
But I rebelled against it.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:31.480
It was--

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.521
NIRDHAR KHAZANIE: How so?

00:01:32.521 --> 00:01:34.930
KARSH KALE: Well, because
growing up in Long Island

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.700
in the early '80s, I was
probably the only Indian kid

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.100
in a school of about 2,000--

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.800
mostly Jewish kids.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.200
And it was just not
something that I could

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.960
use as a part of my identity.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.710
So I was-- I mean,
I was a drummer.

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.500
I started-- I was
playing a drum kit.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.165
I was into heavy
metal and hard rock

00:01:58.165 --> 00:01:59.290
and all that kind of stuff.

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:00.010
NIRDHAR KHAZANIE:
What kind of music

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.030
were you listening to back then?

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.740
KARSH KALE: Oh,
Rush, Led Zeppelin.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.630
I mean, those were my
doorways into music.

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.612
It was definitely
Rush and Led Zeppelin.

00:02:06.612 --> 00:02:08.570
And then, I mean, all
kinds of different stuff,

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.299
all kinds of progressive rock.

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:13.090
And it wasn't until my
dad kind of realized

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.360
that I was listening
to sophisticated music,

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.700
so he took me to see Zakir Bhai.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.690
He took me to see Zakir Hussain
perform in Columbia University.

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.330
And that was the first
time I realized that you

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.680
can take this art form and--

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.060
because I witnessed it.

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.740
I witnessed this
guy come to New York

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.260
and take this classical
art form and turn it

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.150
into a rock concert.

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.310
And everybody left there--

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.220
I mean, this guy wasn't
just a classical musician.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.425
He was a rock star.

00:02:43.425 --> 00:02:43.990
NIRDHAR KHAZANIE:
Is that when you

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.040
knew that you could actually
make a career out of it?

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.560
Was that what inspired you?

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.740
KARSH KALE: I mean, I
was too young to think

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:48.890
about it as a career.

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.800
I just knew that this
was something that I--

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.424
all of a sudden, was
something I wanted

00:02:52.424 --> 00:02:56.500
to make a part of my
identity as a human being.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.012
I mean, I didn't
really understand

00:02:58.012 --> 00:03:00.220
how that was going to play
out later on in my career,

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.820
but that was where I really
embraced tabla and embraced

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.070
the science of
tabla and embraced

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.350
what it had to offer to--
not just as a tabla player,

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.770
as a classical musician, but
to all the different forms

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.680
of music that I was involved in.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.870
Because it was
informing everything.

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.964
So that was my doorway
into playing tabla.

00:03:18.964 --> 00:03:20.380
And then, of course,
from there it

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.767
evolved into becoming
a serious student.

00:03:23.767 --> 00:03:26.350
NIRDHAR KHAZANIE: I don't know
how many of you in the audience

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.350
have followed Karsh, but
I've been following him

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.210
since he first debuted
in around like 2001-ish

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.430
with the "Realize" album.

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.220
I remember distinctly, I was
in my freshman year of college

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.400
with my friend Rocky [INAUDIBLE]
and we were in his car

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.690
and he puts on this track.

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.090
And then, out of nowhere,
I fell in love with tabla

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.130
all over again.

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.870
And that, for me, was
when I knew that this is

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.700
a completely different sound.

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.070
You were doing things in music
that no one else had ever

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:55.260
done before.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.480
It was more than just
special, it was an awakening

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.880
into a new movement.

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.650
Tell me a little bit
about the motivation

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.890
for this album, and kind of
like where your inspiration came

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:06.405
from for it.

00:04:06.405 --> 00:04:07.780
KARSH KALE: Well,
the first album

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.290
is called "Realize"
for a reason.

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.060
"Realize" was actually
a line in a song

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.820
that I was working on with
a friend, which wound up

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.750
on the album called "Fabric" a
few years before the album came

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:20.380
out.

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.670
And the line in the song is
"1,001 designs intertwined.

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:26.540
Which one is mine?"

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.380
And then "realize."

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.740
So "Realize" was kind of the
culmination of everything

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.710
that I had done as a
musician, as an artist,

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.450
as an explorer of music.

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:41.080
And finally, finding
that laser-like

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.340
hole that I could send all
of that information through.

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.550
It really had to
do with identity.

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.152
It had to do with the
fact that, back then--

00:04:50.152 --> 00:04:52.360
this was at a time where we
didn't have social media.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.310
We didn't have
access to anything.

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.350
So everything that
we were hearing about

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:58.840
was all kind of legend.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.797
You know, that in London,
this stuff is happening.

00:05:01.797 --> 00:05:03.880
In San Francisco, this
kind of thing is happening.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.790
So that became a
huge impetus to kind

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:09.070
get involved in
this movement that

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:14.050
was about defining a new
generation's identity,

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.800
where we didn't have-- we don't
come from India in that way.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.070
We didn't-- I mean, Bollywood
didn't necessarily define who

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.600
we are.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.386
Neither did the Desis
Bhangra parties that

00:05:24.386 --> 00:05:25.510
were happening at the time.

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.930
NIRDHAR KHAZANIE: Sure.

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:27.670
KARSH KALE: So we needed
to create something else.

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:29.710
We needed to create a
safe space for people

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:33.340
to be able to come and express
who it is exactly who they are.

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:34.900
And that's what this
music was about.

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.700
And it wasn't just
about my music.

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.490
At that same time, there was
this whole movement going on

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.890
in London with Talvin
Singh and Nitin Sawhney,

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:45.250
and the Anokha Movement, and
Nasha, and Badmarsh &amp; Shri.

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:47.770
And then there was a whole
movement happening here

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:48.947
in San Francisco.

00:05:48.947 --> 00:05:51.280
And there was stuff happening
in New Delhi and in Tokyo,

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.330
and it all started
happening at the same time.

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.765
So we all found out that
we all thought for a moment

00:05:55.765 --> 00:05:57.640
that we were the only
ones in the world doing

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:58.431
what we were doing.

00:05:58.431 --> 00:06:00.280
And then we realized
that this was actually

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:02.590
something that was
happening, and we were just

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:06.290
part of a time period where
we needed to define something.

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:08.650
And I think what you
felt was probably

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:11.090
similar to what I felt when
I Zakir Bhai perform, which

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:14.020
was just that, yeah,
I mean, this is me.

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:16.640
This is not-- and that's
what I've learned, I think,

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:20.380
as an artist ever since
making that first album,

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.630
is that people--

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:25.330
when you make music,
you can be as specific

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:28.160
as you want to be
about your own story.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:32.050
But it really only takes shape
when somebody else's mirror is

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:35.700
in front of them and it
reflects off of their own story,

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:37.920
when people feel like
this is who I am.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:38.920
NIRDHAR KHAZANIE: Right.

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:44.360
So you perform
regularly with artists

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.040
of all different
backgrounds, specializing in

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:50.450
percussion, strings, choral,
different disciplines.

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:53.099
Last night, you played
at the SF Jazz Center.

00:06:53.099 --> 00:06:53.890
Amazing performance

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:54.270
KARSH KALE: Thank you.

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:55.760
NIRDHAR KHAZANIE: I was there.

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:58.760
What kinds of emotion do
you draw from your audience

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:01.085
when you're playing?

00:07:01.085 --> 00:07:01.960
KARSH KALE: I think--

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.890
I mean, I'm less drawing
from the audience,

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:09.090
and more trying
to paint pictures

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:12.660
that I think that the
audience will resonate with.

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:14.760
And it's always different.

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:17.940
Before coming to SF Jazz,
I did 12 dates in India

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:19.107
where I was doing a DJ tour.

00:07:19.107 --> 00:07:20.523
NIRDHAR KHAZANIE:
And we're really

00:07:20.523 --> 00:07:23.320
happy that you came all the
way to Google as part of that.

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.860
KARSH KALE: Yeah, part of me
is still in India right now.

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:29.190
So forgive this slight jet lag.

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:31.340
But-- sorry.

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:34.397
I lost my spot.

00:07:34.397 --> 00:07:36.230
What was the last part
of the last question?

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:38.146
NIRDHAR KHAZANIE: Oh,
yeah, I was just saying,

00:07:38.146 --> 00:07:40.560
how do you actually just draw
energy from the audience?

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:40.960
KARSH KALE: Oh, right.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.740
NIRDHAR KHAZANIE: And then how
people are relating to you.

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:44.030
KARSH KALE: Yeah, I
mean, once again, I

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:45.738
mean, back to what I
was saying before, I

00:07:45.738 --> 00:07:48.440
think it's really about--

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:49.301
and over the years--

00:07:49.301 --> 00:07:50.800
I mean, when I made
the first album,

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.560
I was shooting in the dark.

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:56.860
I had no idea how people
were going to react.

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:59.600
It was overwhelming,
the reaction.

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:02.230
But what stayed after
the initial wave

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:04.310
was that people would--

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:06.310
and to this day, people
from all over the world,

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:09.580
they write to me about the
fact that the music played

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:12.580
a particular role, sometimes
at a very difficult time

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:15.550
in their lives, or at a
time where they needed

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:17.020
to get through
something, or it was

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:19.942
something that motivated them to
be able to reach another level.

00:08:19.942 --> 00:08:22.150
And I realized that, for
me, that's the kind of music

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:23.260
that I listen to, as well.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.620
I mean, music is medicine
at its most potent.

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:29.680
So what I really
try and focus on

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:31.870
is the fact that
people will dance

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:33.340
and people will get into stuff.

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:35.650
And people have come up to
me, and say, hey, man, that

00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:38.390
was some sick beats, yo,
and all that kind of stuff.

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:41.020
But what really--
where I feel like I'm

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:44.440
successful as an artist
is when people come to me

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:47.560
and say that the music
resonated in a way

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:49.090
where it was transformative.

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:51.130
It really helped them
through something.

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:53.220
NIRDHAR KHAZANIE: I
know my wife, Rani,

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:55.236
she's very much so
indebted because she always

00:08:55.236 --> 00:08:56.735
listened to your
music in med school

00:08:56.735 --> 00:08:58.200
and it's what, pretty
much, got her through.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.033
KARSH KALE: Oh, wow.

00:08:59.033 --> 00:09:01.765
NIRDHAR KHAZANIE: So I think
she can relate to that.

00:09:01.765 --> 00:09:03.490
If you had the
opportunity for one year

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:07.000
to go back in time and
study from one of the greats

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.080
that you haven't already worked
with so far, who would it be?

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:12.835
KARSH KALE: Peter Gabriel.

00:09:12.835 --> 00:09:13.710
NIRDHAR KHAZANIE: OK.

00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:14.820
KARSH KALE: Yeah.

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:15.820
He's just somebody who--

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:18.310
I mean, not just Peter
Gabriel, but I've always

00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:21.130
been fascinated by
artists who were

00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:25.990
willing to change the
terrain, who were willing to--

00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:27.520
whatever path was
in front of them,

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:31.600
they decided to
go into the forest

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:35.762
and completely change the
perception of what music was.

00:09:35.762 --> 00:09:37.220
Someone like Peter
Gabriel, I mean,

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:40.390
he was quite instrumental
in introducing the world

00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:42.700
to what we call world music.

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:44.335
NIRDHAR KHAZANIE: Yeah.

00:09:44.335 --> 00:09:45.880
Any particular
track of his that--

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:48.016
KARSH KALE: Oh,
god, albums, albums.

00:09:48.016 --> 00:09:49.390
I mean, everything
from "Genesis"

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:54.280
all the way to when he went solo
and to "The Passion" soundtrack

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:56.170
to all of his solo albums.

00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:57.820
No, he's just somebody who is--

00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:03.280
he doesn't think in terms
of a conventional format.

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:03.886
When we make--

00:10:03.886 --> 00:10:05.260
If you're making
a rock song, you

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.450
want to have drums
and bass and guitar,

00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:09.700
and maybe some
keyboards and vocals.

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:12.070
But someone like
Peter Gabriel will

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:14.860
get L. Shankar to
play electric violin

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:17.740
and have Youssou N'Dour
sing this one little line

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:19.510
at the end of the song.

00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:21.400
And create a-- I
mean, the ornaments

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:24.250
on the tree that he
creates are so unique.

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:27.110
And so that's-- these are the
kind of people that I grew up.

00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:28.810
I mean, still,
these are the people

00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:31.234
that I look to as inspirations.

00:10:31.234 --> 00:10:32.650
I mean, Zakir Bhai
is another one.

00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:33.870
NIRDHAR KHAZANIE: Sure.

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:35.070
KARSH KALE: Bill
Laswell is another one.

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:35.980
Sting is another one.

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:38.350
I mean, these are people
who, when they make music,

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:42.160
they think so outside of the box
that I think that when they're

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.590
doing it, they're probably
a little scared, as well,

00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:47.530
in terms of, I don't know
how this is going to land.

00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:51.517
But usually, they
land on their feet.

00:10:51.517 --> 00:10:53.350
NIRDHAR KHAZANIE: What's
your message to all

00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:54.670
the young and upcoming artists?

00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:57.430
I think this is something that
you're very passionate about.

00:10:57.430 --> 00:10:59.429
You try to be
extremely proactive.

00:10:59.429 --> 00:11:00.970
How do you suggest
that they actually

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:03.940
try to navigate the waters in
this very competitive music

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:05.080
environment?

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:06.250
KARSH KALE: I think it's--

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:08.590
especially nowadays
because we are so

00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:10.590
inundated with so
much information

00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:13.215
and you just go
on YouTube, and--

00:11:13.215 --> 00:11:14.590
anything that
you're looking for,

00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:19.410
you'll find 16 hours
worth of content.

00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:22.300
That I think that what
oftentimes happens

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:24.340
is that we, as artists--

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:27.040
or not just artists, but
especially young artists--

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:30.370
tend to want to fit into
a mold and fit into a box,

00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:36.110
or fit into a already tried and
true path that's been created,

00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:40.120
whether it be Indian classical
music or techno or punk or rock

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:41.680
music-- whatever it is--

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:45.380
so that they can immediately
say, this is what I do.

00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:46.770
And I think that those who--

00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:48.145
I mean, the people
that I've seen

00:11:48.145 --> 00:11:52.770
who have been able to
create a lasting career

00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:54.340
are the people that
create something

00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:57.520
that no one's necessarily
heard of before,

00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:59.980
something outside of a
genre, something outside

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:03.940
of a particular box.

00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:04.900
I think that what--

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:07.780
I always, when I meet young
artists who come to me and say,

00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:09.700
you know, I've been
listening to your music

00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:12.310
and if I listen to it
and it sounds like me,

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:15.940
the first thing that I say
is that I'm just waiting

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:17.590
for it to sound like you now.

00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:21.220
You need to now find a
completely different space that

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:22.390
is yours.

00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:24.580
Because the thing is that
there's so many different

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:27.940
places that an artist
can explore that resonate

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:29.020
with people.

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:30.970
This isn't foreign art.

00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:33.520
We're not creating something
that people won't understand.

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:35.170
But it's about having
the courage to be

00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:36.670
able to step out of that--

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:40.240
if you can find it on
YouTube, then create something

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:41.920
that you can't find yet.

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:44.190
That would be my advice
to any young artist,

00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:46.510
is to try-- at least, that
should be your pursuit.

00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:49.540
Because I think that, in
the end, where you wind up

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:52.360
is at a whole other space.

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:54.744
NIRDHAR KHAZANIE: That's
really good advice.

00:12:54.744 --> 00:12:56.910
Technology is a huge part
of our daily lives today--

00:12:56.910 --> 00:13:00.070
and you had talked about
this a little bit earlier--

00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:01.030
especially for artists.

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:02.920
This is how you're
able to produce.

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:06.220
You're able to record different
thoughts and emotions, which

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:08.080
instantly can be
shared with the masses.

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.520
And I think YouTube
is a great way

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:13.005
of being able to distribute
that kind of content.

00:13:13.005 --> 00:13:14.380
What do you think
that Google can

00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:18.640
do more of to try to help
upcoming artists and people who

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:20.950
are thinking of trying
to share their music

00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:22.450
and get out there more?

00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:23.740
KARSH KALE: I think--

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:26.020
I mean, especially
for new artists,

00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:29.590
I think when YouTube
first started,

00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:32.830
it seemed a lot easier
to be able to find new--

00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:35.800
because there wasn't as
much content available--

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:39.400
it was a lot easier
to find new content.

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:43.000
I think now, because there is
just so much stuff out there,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.490
that it's very difficult
for a young artist

00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:50.900
to be able to get heard, to
be able to find an audience.

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:53.830
And if there was,
maybe, a space where

00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:58.240
people could go to only
for and strictly for brand

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:01.600
new presentations of
whatever it is, whether it

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:04.930
be in-studio presentations or
videos that young artists have

00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:08.330
created or new tracks
or new artwork,

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:12.100
that there's a dedicated space
where people can actually

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:14.250
go to that they know
that this is all-- this

00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:16.030
is brand new, fresh stuff.

00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:18.030
And then, of course,
there's all the other stuff

00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:19.950
that you can find, the
stuff that we've been

00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:21.810
watching for years and years.

00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:24.750
And now there's all the archival
stuff that we can get to.

00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:27.090
But it winds up
getting so mixed up

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:29.760
that people don't realize
that this is brand new.

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:32.230
We don't ever hardly look at
the date, the upload date.

00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:33.600
NIRDHAR KHAZANIE: Sure, no.

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:36.600
I think one of the nice things
is, for instance, if someone

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:38.880
wanted to learn even tabla
from the very beginning

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:41.505
part, the very early
stages now, you can go on

00:14:41.505 --> 00:14:43.666
and you can ask for
something like tintal,

00:14:43.666 --> 00:14:45.040
and then you can
go and there are

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:47.115
a hundred different
variations of how to do this.

00:14:47.115 --> 00:14:47.990
KARSH KALE: Oh, yeah.

00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:49.110
NIRDHAR KHAZANIE: And so
many different teachers

00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:50.310
online who can
actually do that, too.

00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:51.000
KARSH KALE: It's amazing.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.620
I mean, I was
actually-- the other day

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:53.850
my daughter came home.

00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:55.530
She's 15 now.

00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:57.510
And she played me
some song, and she

00:14:57.510 --> 00:14:59.597
was like, I want to
learn this on the piano.

00:14:59.597 --> 00:15:00.930
I was a little busy at the time.

00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:03.330
I was like, let's
do it on Sunday.

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:04.880
By the time Sunday
rolled around,

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:06.840
she had learned the song already
because she went on YouTube

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:07.715
and found a tutorial.

00:15:07.715 --> 00:15:09.744
And she played it for me
and taught me the song.

00:15:09.744 --> 00:15:10.660
NIRDHAR KHAZANIE: Wow.

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:12.810
That's amazing.

00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:15.985
You've been in the industry
now, I'd say, what, at least--

00:15:15.985 --> 00:15:17.110
KARSH KALE: About 25 years.

00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:18.990
NIRDHAR KHAZANIE: 25 years.

00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:21.132
How has technology changed
the music industry?

00:15:21.132 --> 00:15:22.090
KARSH KALE: Oh, my god.

00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:23.160
I've seen--

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:25.470
NIRDHAR KHAZANIE: Mainly
how people create pieces.

00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:30.420
KARSH KALE: I've seen this,
especially in the music world.

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:33.330
I mean, when I was in
college, I was at NYU.

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:37.140
I was learning how to
record to 2-inch tape.

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:39.330
And we were cutting--

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:41.730
editing by cutting tape and
sticking it up on the wall

00:15:41.730 --> 00:15:44.280
and figuring out
where the snare drum

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:46.360
hit so that we can cut
it at the right spot

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:50.580
so we can bring in another
part, or truncate one section.

00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:53.520
And all of this stuff that
I spent years learning.

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:55.590
And then the year I
graduated, Pro Tools

00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:58.560
was available in your bedroom.

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:02.490
So I hardly-- I don't think
I ever used it ever again.

00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:03.420
So I mean, it was--

00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:04.740
I mean, it's been--

00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:06.810
I think every year
or two, technology

00:16:06.810 --> 00:16:09.480
would just take a
leap forward, in terms

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:11.520
of what you're able to do.

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:14.520
I mean, I came from a time
where we needed to get together

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:17.070
with 16 musicians in a studio.

00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:18.590
We'd spend three days recording.

00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:20.590
And if you messed up,
you'd have to start again.

00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:22.130
And editing was a big problem.

00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:24.270
And then when it came
down to mixing a track,

00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:26.430
there would be five of
us sitting at a board.

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:29.300
And we'd have to all sit
there, and kind of, oh,

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:31.349
got to get the
reverb at the bridge.

00:16:31.349 --> 00:16:33.390
And if you miss it, you
have to start over again.

00:16:33.390 --> 00:16:36.030
Whereas now, you can literally--

00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:38.790
I mean, I have been
at the airport,

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:42.780
seen something inspiring,
worked on a track on my phone,

00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:45.000
and landed and have made
a video for the track

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.250
that I made on my phone
and have put it up

00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:49.644
on YouTube within five hours.

00:16:49.644 --> 00:16:50.310
I mean, that's--

00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:51.850
NIRDHAR KHAZANIE: That's
the power of distribution.

00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:54.433
KARSH KALE: Well, it's just the
power of what's available now.

00:16:54.433 --> 00:16:57.960
I mean, I think the only thing
that people need to balance

00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:02.430
is the human element
and the experience

00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:04.589
that one needs to
be able to have.

00:17:04.589 --> 00:17:06.730
It's not enough to just
have the technology.

00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:09.030
It's about marrying the two.

00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:10.890
And if you're able to
actually get access

00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:13.650
to that kind of knowledge,
to be able to help

00:17:13.650 --> 00:17:18.150
be able to create
something on the spot

00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:22.440
and be able to share it and
get feedback in the manner

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:23.900
that we're able to do right now.

00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:25.710
That we also need
to be able to have

00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:29.430
that library of information for
people to be able to access,

00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:32.220
so that they can keep
going back and referencing

00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:35.280
what it is that they're doing
and where they're drawing

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:37.870
their inspirations from.

00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:41.370
NIRDHAR KHAZANIE: So let's move
into the VR aspect of things.

00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:44.850
So you and I, we've been working
together for about eight months

00:17:44.850 --> 00:17:46.447
or so now.

00:17:46.447 --> 00:17:48.030
Do you want to share
with the audience

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:52.212
a little bit about our
VR experiment, what

00:17:52.212 --> 00:17:52.920
we're working on?

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:54.240
KARSH KALE: Yeah.

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:56.531
NIRDHAR KHAZANIE: So for
those of you who may not know,

00:17:56.531 --> 00:17:59.110
this is the Google VR jump rig.

00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:02.100
It's a product that we
have here where we're

00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:05.840
working with GoPro cameras.

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:08.000
The VR experience is
something that Karsh and I

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.210
are very passionate about.

00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:12.221
So I'll give it to you to talk a
little bit about the motivation

00:18:12.221 --> 00:18:13.220
behind what we're doing.

00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:14.370
KARSH KALE: Yeah.

00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:17.430
Well, I mean, I think for me--

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:21.990
I mean, even going back to my
childhood, what I've always

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:25.920
wanted to have is more
access to the artists

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:27.690
that I was listening to.

00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:30.360
And back then, we had vinyls.

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:32.400
We had magazines.

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:35.100
Occasionally, we'd get to
see them on television,

00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:36.660
and that was about it.

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:39.570
So I mean, I had videotapes
that I played a thousand times

00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:41.580
and studied, just
to be able to get

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:46.830
into the intimate details of
what these artists were doing.

00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:49.620
And even now, when my
daughter comes and asks me--

00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:52.050
she's a musician, as well--

00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:54.180
about a particular
musician, whether it

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:57.000
be someone like
Prince or David Bowie,

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.730
I always say to
her that you need

00:18:59.730 --> 00:19:03.000
to spend the rest of your life
sitting in that genius's chair

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.570
and figuring out what it is that
they did, how it is that they

00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:09.090
came about what they created.

00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:13.800
And when the VR
world came about,

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:15.510
the first thing
that came to my mind

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:19.520
was, what an incredible way to
be able to give people access.

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:22.260
To let them step
into the studio,

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:24.510
to step into the
world of an artist,

00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:26.310
and not just as a performer.

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:28.560
I mean, there's obviously
the performance aspect,

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:30.600
where people can actually
be there and sit right

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:33.810
next to the musician and watch
them and watch their hands

00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:38.130
and watch their expressions and
try and get that vibe, and even

00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:39.390
interact with them.

00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:43.230
But there's also the aspect
of getting into the studio

00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:47.370
and being in an environment
where you can actually

00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:49.440
interact, where you can--

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:52.920
while in real time, there's
a track that's being created,

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:57.210
that's being manifested
right in front of you.

00:19:57.210 --> 00:19:58.620
And then people leave the room.

00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:02.070
And then you're able to actually
go in and play with that.

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:03.960
Have the kind of
unprecedented access

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:06.150
that we've never had
before with artists.

00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:07.920
I mean, that was the
most inspiring thing

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:10.920
about the VR world that--

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:12.840
my initial inspiration.

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:16.170
And then, there's
the entire world

00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:21.270
of how to change the whole
relationship between--

00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:23.670
I mean, we're on a stage and
you guys are in the audience

00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:24.190
right now.

00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:26.880
But that this, we can change.

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:28.580
We can change this
whole interaction.

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:33.810
We can change the fact that
musicians are put on a pedestal

00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:36.870
and the audience sits in
a place where you can only

00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:39.470
have a certain level of access.

00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:43.860
But if you can actually step on
stage and go behind the artist,

00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:46.170
it just completely
changes your perspective.

00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:49.380
And I think about when
I was seven years old

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:53.220
and I went to see Zakir Bhai,
if I could have went up on stage

00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:56.370
and sat behind him while he
was performing and gotten

00:20:56.370 --> 00:20:59.850
that kind of access, how
much information that

00:20:59.850 --> 00:21:02.250
would have been for me.

00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:05.700
It took me years to just
study whatever bits and pieces

00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:06.520
that I could get.

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:09.540
And I realize that
for young artists,

00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:12.210
for young students of music,
and just fans of music,

00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:14.970
to be able to have that kind
of access, especially in a day

00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:16.770
now where digital music has--

00:21:16.770 --> 00:21:18.270
the one thing that
it's done is it's

00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:22.380
also erased those artifacts that
we used to get from artists--

00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:25.140
the liner notes,
the information,

00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:27.270
the stuff they'd write
in albums and stuff.

00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:30.240
The stuff that you'd-- the
little intimate details that

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:33.120
made you feel like you're a
little bit closer to the artist

00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:34.560
have kind of disappeared.

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:37.920
So in that place, I feel
like we are stepping

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:41.010
into a whole other world where
we can give people really

00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:44.440
incredible access to what it--

00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:45.570
and not just for music.

00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:49.590
I mean, this is for
anything, all walks.

00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:51.810
NIRDHAR KHAZANIE: I'd
like to take this moment

00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:53.510
and open it up for
audience questions.

00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:56.250
If people have any
questions, we have mics.

00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:58.500
AUDIENCE: What are the
challenges of effectively using

00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:00.010
spatial audio in VR?

00:22:02.912 --> 00:22:04.870
KARSH KALE: Well, I think
that that's something

00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:06.490
that we're still exploring.

00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:08.800
So I think that I'll have
to answer that question

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:12.490
in maybe a few months, in terms
of what the challenges might

00:22:12.490 --> 00:22:13.410
be.

00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:15.124
NIRDHAR KHAZANIE: Thanks.

00:22:15.124 --> 00:22:18.440
AUDIENCE: How do you
address creative block?

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:20.540
I think every artist
experiences that.

00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:23.450
What is your, I
guess, methodology

00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:25.190
of getting over that hump?

00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:26.900
KARSH KALE: Well,
I mean, for me,

00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:29.510
if I get a creative block when
I'm working on my own stuff,

00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:31.050
I just stop.

00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:32.470
I just stop until--

00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:35.039
I mean, for me, it doesn't
work unless I'm inspired.

00:22:35.039 --> 00:22:37.330
And sometimes I'm inspired
at 3 o'clock in the morning.

00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:38.871
I'll get straight
out of bed and I'll

00:22:38.871 --> 00:22:40.960
go start working on something.

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:45.100
If I'm working on something for,
say, a film or something that

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:49.120
requires a deadline, I've
amassed enough skills

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:52.160
to be able to get it done.

00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:55.270
But I think that the
difference is getting something

00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:59.440
done that you know
will do the job,

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:01.780
and then there's
that inspired work

00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:06.280
that you know only works
when you're inspired.

00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:08.170
AUDIENCE: You play a
lot of instruments.

00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:09.206
How did it work for you?

00:23:09.206 --> 00:23:10.830
How do you learn all
those instruments?

00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:14.070
How did you split your time
learning those instruments?

00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:17.740
Was it one instrument for
a specific period of time

00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:19.330
or how did it work?

00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:22.090
KARSH KALE: Well, I mean,
when I was growing up,

00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:23.350
I was a drummer.

00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:26.320
So whenever I had
band rehearsals,

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:27.970
they were at my house.

00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:30.400
So all of the musicians would
bring their instruments up

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:32.770
to my house and they
would leave them there.

00:23:32.770 --> 00:23:34.590
So I had a house full of--

00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:36.700
I had a bass and a
bass amp with pedals.

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:38.350
I had a guitar
with guitar pedals.

00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:40.210
I had an 8-track
recorder and a keyboard.

00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:43.040
And all of this stuff that
I never played myself,

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:44.729
but that's how I
learned how to play it.

00:23:44.729 --> 00:23:47.020
And I learned also-- because
I had an 8-track recorder,

00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:49.300
I started making my own music--

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:50.200
terrible music.

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:52.180
But it was my own stuff.

00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:54.340
So I was learning how
to write bass lines.

00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:56.170
And then how that
worked in counterpoint

00:23:56.170 --> 00:23:57.430
to a keyboard part.

00:23:57.430 --> 00:23:59.410
And how that worked
with a guitar part.

00:23:59.410 --> 00:24:02.110
And then how that worked
with a particular drum part

00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:03.140
that I was writing.

00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:04.960
And so these were all--

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:09.409
that was the way for me to step
into that world of making music

00:24:09.409 --> 00:24:10.450
on different instruments.

00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:13.960
And I realized that my
fascination with music

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:16.874
was never only based
on one instrument.

00:24:16.874 --> 00:24:18.790
When I would listen to--
when I was growing up

00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:22.210
listening to Zeppelin
or Rush or Queen,

00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:24.490
I was always listening
to really big music

00:24:24.490 --> 00:24:26.330
with a lot of stuff going on.

00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:29.720
And I always wanted to
be able to do all of it.

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:35.690
It wasn't about being
an expert or a virtuoso

00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:38.270
at any of those
particular things.

00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:42.620
These were means to be able
to create that large sound,

00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:45.560
to be able to-- so that's why I
learned how to-- and I always--

00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:47.390
I started playing sarod
for a little while.

00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:49.440
I played santoor
for a little while.

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:51.080
And I knew that I wasn't going
to play these instruments

00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:52.216
for the rest of my life.

00:24:52.216 --> 00:24:53.840
But there was something
that I learned.

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:56.600
There was something that I was
able to-- that I still apply in

00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:59.650
my own music by spending
that two years playing sarod

00:24:59.650 --> 00:25:02.900
and those four years
playing santoor.

00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:06.290
As a tabla player, as a
composer, all of these things

00:25:06.290 --> 00:25:07.582
come into play.

00:25:07.582 --> 00:25:09.290
And a lot of people,
a lot of musicians--

00:25:09.290 --> 00:25:10.880
especially producers--

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:13.370
that you meet,
oftentimes, are people

00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:15.290
who have been able
to explore a lot

00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:19.700
of different styles of music
and different instrumentation.

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:21.890
It's important to know
the physicality of what

00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:23.764
it is that you're working with.

00:25:23.764 --> 00:25:25.430
So now when I work
with a guitar player,

00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:27.200
I have a much
deeper understanding

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:30.247
of what it is that they're
doing besides me just

00:25:30.247 --> 00:25:32.080
asking for something
and them delivering it.

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:33.500
I know what to ask for.

00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:35.930
I know what their first
physical limitations are.

00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:38.259
I know the limitations
of the instrument itself.

00:25:38.259 --> 00:25:40.550
I'm not going to sit here
and do a guitar solo for you,

00:25:40.550 --> 00:25:42.133
but I know enough
about the instrument

00:25:42.133 --> 00:25:44.870
to be able to work with
great guitar players

00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:48.430
and get more out of
that interaction.

00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:52.870
AUDIENCE: For me, I feel
like your fusion music was

00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:59.030
the first that connected
with me in a very

00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:01.100
pure and specific way.

00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:04.962
And yet, it's always
evolving and you're always

00:26:04.962 --> 00:26:06.170
pushing the boundaries on it.

00:26:06.170 --> 00:26:09.450
So where do you feel that
fusion music is today,

00:26:09.450 --> 00:26:11.580
and where do you
think it's headed?

00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:15.190
KARSH KALE: Well, I
think, fusion music

00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:17.660
has always been happening.

00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:18.950
That's what music is.

00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:22.080
I mean, everything, even Indian
classical music is fusion.

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:24.320
It's a fusion of
many different ideas

00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:27.500
that come together on one stage.

00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:30.120
But these ideas come from
many different places.

00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:33.230
So I think that it's
always evolving.

00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:36.000
I mean, fusion is the process.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.460
It's not a style.

00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:40.430
It's not a particular
form of music.

00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:44.270
Fusion is the process that
we acknowledge as music

00:26:44.270 --> 00:26:46.130
is evolving in front of us.

00:26:46.130 --> 00:26:50.600
And we might have had a moment
where this was our time.

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:53.870
This was the time where we
resonated most with that music.

00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:57.350
But it's-- I think that what I
see and what's happening today

00:26:57.350 --> 00:27:02.150
is another generation
of artists who are--

00:27:02.150 --> 00:27:04.990
they are already fused.

00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:08.960
They're growing up with U.
Srinivas and Zakir Hussain

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:11.960
and John Coltrane and
the latest heavy metal

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:14.280
album and the latest
Anderson Paak record

00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:16.610
and whatever new hip hop
record is coming out,

00:27:16.610 --> 00:27:18.230
all happening at the same time.

00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:20.744
And they're expressing
that all at the same time.

00:27:20.744 --> 00:27:22.160
I mean, some of
the artists that I

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:25.040
work with now in my
collective in India

00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:28.169
are young artists who are
blowing my mind with how

00:27:28.169 --> 00:27:29.960
they're able to come
and be like, oh, yeah,

00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:31.700
it's this, this,
this, and that, right?

00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:34.300
So it's kind of
like a techno meets

00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:37.280
bhajan meets a light
classical thing

00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:43.250
with a little Carnatic twist,
and a dash of heavy metal.

00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:44.870
Whereas for us, it
took us years to be

00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:47.574
able to kind of get to that
point where we understood.

00:27:47.574 --> 00:27:49.490
So I think that, if
anything, that's, I think,

00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:50.281
where we're at now.

00:27:50.281 --> 00:27:53.810
It's that the music that we're
going to hear from now on

00:27:53.810 --> 00:27:56.977
is going to be on a
whole other level.

00:27:56.977 --> 00:27:57.810
AUDIENCE: Hi, Karsh.

00:27:57.810 --> 00:27:58.435
KARSH KALE: Hi.

00:27:58.435 --> 00:28:00.260
AUDIENCE: I'm a huge
fan of your work.

00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:01.990
I would like to
ask you about taste

00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:03.860
and if you, from
your own experience,

00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:07.670
have any ideas on creating a
rich journey of discovering

00:28:07.670 --> 00:28:08.720
new music?

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:10.250
KARSH KALE: Well, I mean,
that was what I was actually

00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:11.060
addressing before.

00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:12.518
I think that there
is still-- there

00:28:12.518 --> 00:28:17.120
needs to be a little bit more
of a platform for new emerging

00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:20.660
artists who have
something new to say.

00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:23.690
Because oftentimes, it
gets lost in the mix.

00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:25.640
There's so much stuff
out there that it's

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:28.109
hard to find the new stuff.

00:28:28.109 --> 00:28:29.900
And I think that that
also has to do with--

00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:35.690
it's also a curator's job to
bring those things together

00:28:35.690 --> 00:28:38.396
and present new music
in that particular way.

00:28:38.396 --> 00:28:40.520
And I think there are people
out there-- people who

00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:43.130
are doing podcasts and people
who are putting together

00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:45.890
playlists-- that a lot
of people check out

00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:48.320
because they trust what it is.

00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:50.900
I mean, I remember
when I was coming up,

00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:53.840
back then, it was
people's radio shows.

00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:55.760
But there were a
few people who were

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:59.000
responsible for introducing
the world to some of the--

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.240
I remember when my
second album had come out

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:05.090
and Coldplay was
still a new band

00:29:05.090 --> 00:29:07.610
that was being
introduced as a brand

00:29:07.610 --> 00:29:10.661
new artist in this compilation
that I was a part of.

00:29:10.661 --> 00:29:12.410
Now they're, of course,
one of the biggest

00:29:12.410 --> 00:29:13.950
bands on the planet.

00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:17.370
But yeah, it was because there
was a platform like that.

00:29:17.370 --> 00:29:20.420
So I think that the important
thing is to be able to have,

00:29:20.420 --> 00:29:23.770
and encourage people, as
well, to share playlists

00:29:23.770 --> 00:29:27.500
and to share-- to curate--

00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:30.230
these kind of things
where people have access

00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:33.327
to new music and new artists.

00:29:33.327 --> 00:29:34.910
AUDIENCE: So one
thing I want to know,

00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:36.868
because you've been in
the industry for a while

00:29:36.868 --> 00:29:38.510
and you have worked
various artists

00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:40.800
from India or from elsewhere.

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:42.110
How do they approach the music?

00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:44.068
I mean, what's the
difference in their approach

00:29:44.068 --> 00:29:45.570
to the music, which is--

00:29:45.570 --> 00:29:49.040
the Asian underground is still
based on Indian classical,

00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:49.890
to an extent.

00:29:49.890 --> 00:29:52.400
So how do they
approach the music

00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:54.734
based on their
cultural background?

00:29:54.734 --> 00:29:56.150
KARSH KALE: I mean,
I can't really

00:29:56.150 --> 00:29:59.060
say that there's a particular--

00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:02.390
I mean, every
musician is different.

00:30:02.390 --> 00:30:05.900
I've met artists that
are purists coming

00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:08.840
from the electronic music
world that don't really

00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:10.490
necessarily understand
how to step out

00:30:10.490 --> 00:30:12.080
of that particular box.

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:13.640
I've met Indian
classical musicians

00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:15.530
who've been playing
for decades who

00:30:15.530 --> 00:30:20.210
have absolutely no issue
with hearing some grimy drum

00:30:20.210 --> 00:30:22.760
and bass track and know
exactly how it is that they

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:24.104
fit into that context.

00:30:24.104 --> 00:30:25.520
So there's no real
answer to that.

00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:28.700
I mean, it really comes down
to the individual artists.

00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:30.680
I mean, there have been
classical musicians

00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:34.820
who I've worked with that
I've had to completely mute

00:30:34.820 --> 00:30:37.500
everything that I was working on
and just play a classical tabla

00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:40.640
part just so that they could
understand what the context was

00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:42.650
that I was trying
to bring them into.

00:30:42.650 --> 00:30:45.050
And usually, those are
actually younger artists.

00:30:45.050 --> 00:30:47.600
Older artists tend to
be a little bit more

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:50.690
versatile because they've
been there and done that.

00:30:50.690 --> 00:30:53.120
We assume when we hear
musicians that this

00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:55.460
is what they do so this is
the bubble that they live in.

00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:57.640
But they hear everything.

00:30:57.640 --> 00:30:58.920
They've seen everything.

00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:00.060
And the older the artist--

00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:03.320
I mean, someone like Zakir
Bhai, who's not only seen,

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:05.660
but he's lived
through, he's breathed

00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:08.390
through so many
different genres of music

00:31:08.390 --> 00:31:13.040
that his own audiences
still have no idea how much

00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:14.570
this guy has lived through.

00:31:14.570 --> 00:31:18.912
So when a guy like that
comes into the studio,

00:31:18.912 --> 00:31:20.870
I'm hard-pressed to throw
him a curveball where

00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:24.082
he's scratching his head.

00:31:24.082 --> 00:31:27.050
NIRDHAR KHAZANIE: Well, thanks
everyone for your questions.

00:31:27.050 --> 00:31:29.490
So we have a very nice surprise.

00:31:29.490 --> 00:31:31.160
It's that Karsh,
I think, is going

00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:35.600
to give us a quick little
demonstration of the tabla.

00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:40.270
KARSH KALE: So for those of you
who have not seen these drums,

00:31:40.270 --> 00:31:41.186
it's called the tabla.

00:31:44.378 --> 00:31:47.420
Traditionally, an Indian
classical instrument,

00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:50.810
but now used all
over the world in all

00:31:50.810 --> 00:31:54.260
walks of music, whether it be
in Hollywood films or hip hop

00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:58.370
music or pop music or Kirtan--

00:31:58.370 --> 00:32:00.530
all kinds of stuff.

00:32:00.530 --> 00:32:02.660
And it's also an incredibly
versatile instrument

00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:05.180
in that it's not only
a rhythm instrument,

00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:08.780
it's also a tonal instrument,
a melodic instrument.

00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:11.420
And it's a a talking
drum, as well.

00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:12.050
It can speak.

00:32:12.050 --> 00:32:13.980
It can have conversations.

00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:15.110
So the way that--

00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:19.370
the repertoire that we
learn is based on syllables.

00:32:19.370 --> 00:32:21.710
These are syllables
that we turn into words.

00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:23.960
Then these words, we
turn into paragraphs,

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:27.370
and we create stories.

00:32:27.370 --> 00:32:30.860
There is a particular
rhythm called Keherwa,

00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:34.640
which is probably one of
the most popular rhythms

00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:36.070
all over the planet.

00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:38.090
And you hear it in
devotional music.

00:32:38.090 --> 00:32:39.599
You hear it in Bhangra.

00:32:39.599 --> 00:32:40.640
You hear it in Bollywood.

00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:42.437
You hear it in reggae music.

00:32:42.437 --> 00:32:44.270
You hear it in all kinds
of different music.

00:32:44.270 --> 00:32:49.670
And it's a very simple rhythm
that anyone can learn, and then

00:32:49.670 --> 00:32:50.420
expand upon.

00:32:54.890 --> 00:32:57.819
So the syllables
of Keherwa are--

00:32:57.819 --> 00:32:58.360
[DRUM SOUNDS]

00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:00.950
dhin, naa.

00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:03.839
So it's dhin naa,
dhin, dhin naa.

00:33:03.839 --> 00:33:05.320
Dhin naa, dhin, dhin naa.

00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:06.242
So dhin--

00:33:06.242 --> 00:33:09.008
[DRUM SOUNDS]

00:33:09.930 --> 00:33:17.620
So that's the general
composition of Keherwa.

00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:20.540
But there's many, many different
interpretations of that.

00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:22.790
So I'll kind of take you
through a little bit of that.

00:33:22.790 --> 00:33:25.778

[APPLAUSE]

00:34:41.911 --> 00:34:43.785
It was kind of like
typing with a typewriter.

00:34:43.785 --> 00:34:45.679
I had to keep moving it back.

00:34:45.679 --> 00:34:47.347
But thank you.

00:34:47.347 --> 00:34:48.930

Thank you, everyone.
