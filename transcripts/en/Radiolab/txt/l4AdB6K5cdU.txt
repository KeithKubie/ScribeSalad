Speaker 1:          00:01          Okay. Ready? Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich and this is Radiolab. Today we've got a story about the crazy power of words in particular, 60 words, single sentence that it is, has you could say defined America for the last 12 years and uh, yeah, and the place to start is a difficult one. This Justin, you were looking at obviously a very disturbing live shot there. September 11th, 2001 8:46 AM

Speaker 2:          00:27          a plane has crashed into the World Trade Center. We don't know anything more than that. We don't know.

Speaker 3:          00:32          This is a day that anyone who is old enough to remember does remember we have no idea. You can remember where we were on board or who we were with.

Speaker 2:          00:39          So you have no idea. Rather right. Rather write one another plane. Just oh my God. Another plane has jet kit

Speaker 4:          00:46          and of course we can remember how he felt. Tell me what you just saw. Oh, fell down. Let's go see what happened. It just the worst attack ever on American soil.

Speaker 3:          01:08          If you really want to understand the world we live in now, you've got to jump ahead. One day to September 12th two a corner office in the White House where there's a lawyer sitting at a computer trying to figure out how are we going to declare war. And one of the things that everybody realizes after sort of an initial discussion is yes, we'd like to declare war, but we have no idea upon whom we should declare war. That is Gregory Johnson, the Michael Hastings national security reporting fellow at buzzfeed. Now the reason this lawyer man by the name of Timothy Flanagan, the reason Flanagan is sitting at a computer in an office, it's because then president George Bush had to do something. He had to act and he didn't want to act alone. You want it congressional approval, right? I mean, technically in an emergency president can defend the country, is the commander in chief. After all, he doesn't have to go to Congress and say, Hey, do I have authorization to use force? Not An emergency. That's been with us by the way, senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution. But President Bush needed congress on his side. He felt it was important that we project unity, that we're all standing together as one and second, if this was an act of war, the power to declare war in the constitution is given to Congress, not to the executive. When Congress declares war, suddenly the president has a very clear and powerful mandate.

Speaker 4:          02:31          [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          02:31          Now, the declaration of war is kind of a dead instrument of international law. I mean, nobody's declared war since World War II, but the modern incarnation of the declaration of war is the authorization to use force, the authorization to use force, what's called the authorization for the use of military force, or as it's commonly referred to the a u m f.

Speaker 1:          02:59          Right? So our lawyer in the White House Flannigan, he's given a task go right in AUMF that Congress can send to the president. He really has no idea. So he goes back to the last time that the u s did this last time congress passed one of these things. He does a quick sort of search on his computer. Boom, finds it. 1991 Iraq. The Gulf War Flannigan grabs the text and then he copies that into a word document and that becomes his template. He makes some cuts, he makes some changes, he deletes some words. Then he hits send our war on Tara, a just war and he sets in motion. This be will during series of events by U s drone strike in early to al Qaeda and the wall, Wayne trapes. Hey madness. That is basically the world. We live in. 15 members of a wedding procession or killed by us and if you're like me, bizarre, even sadistic treatment, you're like me and you find yourself flipping through the channels, see the news, basically ignoring it, but then every so often thinking, wait a second.

Speaker 1:          04:00          Terrorism targets in Africa from Libya now the U S air for drone strike in southern Somalia. Wait, wait, how are we doing this in all these different places? 100 presenters are on a hunger strike and like that protest of their indefinite detention. How? How? How are we detaining people for so long? Is that, is it okay to do that? We'll just who signed off on this, you know, and it turns out we all did because it was in that document. This is the legal foundation for everything that the u s has done. Everything from Guantanamo Bay to drone strikes to secret renditions to seal rates. It's all been hung off these 60 words and that's the crazy part, the body of this document, the part that really matters. And the reason that when I was reading Gregory's reporting on this, I was like, what is it? It all goes back to one single sentence, 60 words, one sentence. Can you read it? Absolutely. That the president is authorized to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations organizations or persons he determines, planned, authorize, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11 2001 or harbored such organizations or persons in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations or persons. 60 words

Speaker 5:          05:32          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          05:32          today, a collaboration with buzzfeed and with reporter Gregory Johnson. We're going to try to decode those words and ask where do those words come from and how could they come to mean what they mean, which is not what you think they know and how did they end up leading us into what is arguably the longest war in American history.

Speaker 5:          05:53          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          05:54          and nobody saw it coming. Absolutely. No, but that's the weirdest as well. Nobody minus one. Let's start there. Maybe you should introduce us to Barbara Lee. Right. Barbara Lee is a congresswoman from right around Berkeley, California. [inaudible] hello? Hello. Hello. Hi. It's Barbara. And she is someone who has been in many ways, a lifelong activist going all the way back to when she was 15 in high school in San Fernando Valley because I wanted to be a cheerleader. But you know, since this was the early sixties you had to have certain criteria, like at least whether it was stated or not being blind and blue eyes, that would've been hard for you. I would figure that was really hard. So I went to the NAACP. She got them to pressure the school to change the rules, and I won. And she became the first black cheerleader, um, at, at her high school. Yeah. Yeah. That's just by way of introduction. Fast forward many years, she becomes a congress woman. She gets elected to a second term, and on that day

Speaker 6:          06:56          there is smoke pouring out of the Pentagon. She was at the capitol. No one knew where to go. So then the police officers just said, run, run, run, go, go, go. This was an apparent terrorist attack on our country. So I ran out of the capitol. Wow. Down Pennsylvania Avenue. I remember looking back and saw a lot of smoke, which was, you know, the Pentagon, you know, clearly the country's under attack. Clearly people have died. Clearly, we've got to deal with whoever did this,

Speaker 1:          07:22          whatever it takes. Fast forward two days, September 13th, Barbara Lee's back at the capitol to meet with her democratic colleagues to review that document that Flanagan had sent over. The mood in the room was very somber and very angry. The thing we have to keep in mind when we're talking about this is all of this was done within 72 hours after the worst terrorist attack in United States history and very confused what would be the appropriate response. So as she and her colleagues read those 60 words, there was a lot of debate going on back and forth. Oh yes. Oh yes. From everyone. Because this actually wasn't the first draft. Flanagan had sent one over the night before September 12 2001 and that one was something that almost no one agreed to. According to Gregory, that early draft had a few extra lines in it. One gave the president the power to preempt any future acts of aggression against the United States and Barbara Lee and her colleagues knew that look, so many things can be packed into this word aggression, that if we sign on to this, that if we give the president this power, the president may never have to come back to Congress ever again and request authorization for military force because he can say that anything is aggression and we're also giving him the power to preempt.

Speaker 1:          08:44          Two, they kicked it back to the White House. Flanagan took out those words and now they have this new draft that the president is authorized to use all necessary inappropriate force, which is what you heard. It's still, when Barbara read that and saw phrases like all necessary inappropriate force, she thought, what does that even mean? I said, this is too broad. It's not definitive. It's open-ended, and as she was speaking, this is taking place in the basement of the Capitol building. She sees some of her democratic colleagues start to nod. Yup. People were nodding. People were nodding because everybody there knew the danger of ill-defined words. You just had to go back 50 years to the Gulf of Tonkin, Gulf of Tonkin and talking Tonkin. Todd can with an n. Yes. To explain it.

Speaker 7:          09:28          My thought about America as president and commander in chief

Speaker 1:          09:33          1964 LBJ announces at two American ships.

Speaker 7:          09:36          So you asked the straw yours, correct,

Speaker 1:          09:39          Denise, Gulf of Tonkin off the coast of Vietnam or torpedoed by North Vietnamese,

Speaker 7:          09:43          both by a number of hostile vessels.

Speaker 1:          09:45          People now argue that one of these attacks never even happened. Nonetheless, President Johnson wanted to strike back, so he asked Congress,

Speaker 7:          09:52          I asked a resolution,

Speaker 1:          09:53          which they did, giving them the power to quote, take all necessary measures to repel any armed attack against the forces of the United States and to prevent further aggression.

Speaker 7:          10:06          Making it clear that our government is United in its determination to take all necessary measures and support a freedom and in the fence of peace in Southeast Asia.

Speaker 1:          10:19          Now, it is the broad language of that document. Most people believe that opened the door to the worst part of the Vietnam War.

Speaker 8:          10:27          [inaudible] the rangers and Marines, the casualty mostly from hidden sniper,

Speaker 1:          10:31          thousands and thousands of casualty. Keep dropping. There's nothing you can do. Horrific atrocities.

Speaker 8:          10:36          Shawn was, had been made that troops Carroll as many as 567 south Vietnamese civilians during the sleep in March, 1968

Speaker 1:          10:45          and in a television interview in 1969 when President Johnson was asked to justify it all, he said, you can't just blame [inaudible].

Speaker 7:          10:52          Yeah, Congress gave us this authority in August, 1964 the new whatever made me not sure that's pretty far reaching. That's the sky's the limit. So

Speaker 1:          11:06          the lessons of the Gulf, Tongan and Vietnam, that was very much in the air in that meeting on September 13th, 2001 several key leaders hope to avoid a repeat of the 1964 Tonkin Gulf resolution. So it was understandable that when Barbara Lee stood up and said to her colleagues that she was worried about some of this language, people were nodding, people were nodding. So there was a lot of uncertainty about what to do. But in the end, those concerns were ultimately outweighed by another desire. We've got to be unified with the president. We can't show political divisions. Let's have the nation. Let's have Congress speaking with one voice. It was a time for unity and for action, and so walking out of that democratic caucus meeting on the evening of September 13th congressional leadership decided that these 60 words, this is the version, there's no going back to the drawing board.

Speaker 1:          11:51          And so that 10:00 AM September 14 2001 said it will come to order. The Senate is gabbled into session. Cork will call the roll. Dashiell calls a vote. Mr Akaka, Mr Allard, Mr. Allen, there are 98 senators on the floor. Mr Durban, Mr Voinovich, all 98 of them vote. Yay. No senator voted in the negative. So that was a sweep. Yeah. Later in the day, the resolution would go to the house where Barbara Lee was a representative. Daschel had x. You rushed the vote through the Senate because the White House has called for a national prayer meeting at the National Cathedral for the victims of nine 11 that's supposed to start right at noon. And so right after the vote, all the senators pour out of the capitol and get onto the buses. I'm trying to get through the drizzle. It was actually raining that day. No, at that moment, Barbara League, she hadn't decided how it is that she was going to vote.

Speaker 1:          12:44          I struggled with it for the previous two nights. September 12th and 13th she stayed up late, calling back to advisers, to friends in California. We talked every day, including this guy. This is Ron Dellums. I serve for over 27 years in the u s house of Representatives. Barbara used to be his chief of staff and when he resigned, she won his congressional seat. You know, she would say, well, what about this and what do you think about that? And we kind of talked through the, the emotional state of the country that we are feeling pain, anger. We're shocked. Both Barbara and Ron were trained as psychiatric social workers. So they both knew that when a person is feeling all of those things, it's generally better to do nothing. Yeah. Psychology One oh one you don't make decisions when you're morning afraid. On the other hand, I believe you know in unity too, I want to be unified with the president when the country is under attack.

Speaker 1:          13:38          I understood and he didn't tell me. He didn't say which way I should vote, but I did say to her, Barbara, however you vote, I will always respect you. You will always be friend. You will always be family. So at that moment with the memorial service about to start in a few hours till the House vote, Barbara Lee was at the capitol that was in the cloak room and since she wasn't sure how she was going to vote, she planned to skip the memorial service. She wanted to stay. She wanted to think, and then I don't know what it was. May have been the spirit move in me, I don't know. But at the very last minute she was drinking actually a can of Ginger Ale at the time. I said, I think I'm going to go and I just ran out. I probably was the last one on the bus. I had the can of Ginger Ale in my hand and ran down the steps and got on the bus. She got to the Cathedral. The House buses arrived about 30 minutes or so before the opening. And so for, for 30 minutes, she's in the cathedral about halfway back listening to the Oregon,

Speaker 1:          14:38          thinking about the families in those who were killed. There are people around her who are sort of whispering the pain and anguish. The few people who are crying. I said, I gotta pray over this. And

Speaker 6:          14:52          she's just wrestling with her boat.

Speaker 4:          14:57          [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          14:57          her heart is saying one thing, this is too broad and her head is saying unity. How is it that you can be against the president at this point?

Speaker 4:          15:07          [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          15:07          speaking of the president, eventually President Bush takes the podium.

Speaker 10:         15:11          We are here in the middle hour of our grief. Yes, three days removed from these events. Americans do not yet have

Speaker 4:          15:23          the distance of history, but our responsibility to history is already clear

Speaker 10:         15:33          to answer these attacks and rid the world of evil.

Speaker 9:          15:36          And then as soon as President Bush steps down, everyone in the congregation stands up.

Speaker 4:          15:46          [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          15:46          and, and they, they sing the battle hymn of the republic

Speaker 4:          15:53          [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          15:53          which is a very powerful, a very moving, um, piece of music, but it's not the sort of thing that is typically sung at a memorial service. It's a, it's a very forward and almost aggressive sounding. Has the phrase terrible with sewer. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          16:24          [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          16:30          Oh my God.

Speaker 6:          16:32          It was not quite what I expected in a memorial service.

Speaker 9:          16:37          But the second speaker, a reverend by the name of Nathan Baxter got up and he gave a reading from Jeremiah 31

Speaker 11:         16:46          when ancient Israel's suffered the excruciating pain and tragedy of militant aggression and destruction.

Speaker 6:          16:56          Hearing that all over again takes me right back there and I remember, oh, voices heard in Ramo lamenting and better weeping, weeping Rachel weeping for her children, weeping for her children when he spoke. That's when, to me, it was the memorial. And then that Assurant, he, he started to pray

Speaker 11:         17:17          for the healing of our grief stricken hearts for the souls and sacred memory of those who have been lost.

Speaker 6:          17:25          And he said something that really struck Barbara Lee.

Speaker 11:         17:30          Let us also pray for divine wisdom. He said, as we ask that as we act, we've not become the evil we deploy

Speaker 6:          17:44          that evil that we deplore. When he said that I became very, it was the sense of peace and calm came over me.

Speaker 5:          17:55          Uh,

Speaker 6:          17:55          and Barbara Lee says it was right. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          17:58          [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          17:58          but she knew what she'd do.

Speaker 12:         18:00          The clerk report the title House Joint Resolution 64 joint resolution to authorize the use of United States army.

Speaker 6:          18:07          Later that evening, the house opens up its debate on the AUMF

Speaker 12:         18:11          speaker. I rise in support of this resolution which authorizes the president to use all force necessary

Speaker 6:          18:18          Sarah and congressperson after congressperson. Mr Speaker stands up. I rise in support of this resolution that's just bigger. I rise tonight to fully endorse and authorize the use of force one after another or I rise in support of the authorization. I rise today in support of this resolution. We will rally behind our president 16 in a row until Joel Wellman from California is recognized for a minute and a half. We get to Barbara Lee, Mr Speaker members I rise today. Really what that [inaudible] very heavy heart, one that is filled with sorrow for the families and the loved ones who were killed and injured this week. Only the most foolish and the most cows would not understand the grief that has really gripped our people and millions across the world.

Speaker 13:         19:04          [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          19:05          I have agonized over this vote, but I came to grips with it today and I came to grips with opposing this resolution during the very painful yet very beautiful memorial service as a member of the clergy so eloquently said, as we act, let us not become the evil that we deplore just after the vote, Barbara Lee says she was in the cloak room again and she starts getting accosted by colleagues. All of these friends are coming up to her and saying, you've got to go back. You. You cannot vote this way. As I brought changing my vote, one of them actually said to her, look, you've done so much on HIV. You've done so much on aids. This vote is going to take you out. Think of the bigger picture. They are saying, you're dead. Yeah, but that's the right vote. I'm not going to give any president the authority to go to war and we don't know when we're doing. You know, the only congress can declare a war. Yeah. It helped me on this guys, uh, has the houseboat. Uh, okay. The house is just now finished that boat and uh, we see one no vote or the final vote for the house was 420 to one. We know what's a democrat. We don't yet know who will figure that out.

Speaker 13:         20:30          Well in a moment or so, but that vote is now. Yep.

Speaker 6:          20:33          Barbara Lee was the only person in the Senate or the house to cast a no vote. That must've been a very lonely moment, to be perfectly honest with you. I said some prayers for my friend.

Speaker 13:         20:48          This was the right thing to do. And you know, boats like this, you have to be ready to, to pay the consequences. Over the next few weeks and months, her office was inundated with letters. Barbara Lee, you are a traitor and a disgrace to the office that you hold. You can find all these letters archived at Mills College. You weren't played on American society, terrorist yourself. So much hatred. I don't know why you decided to place yourself into the camp of terrorists. Those attacks came and they came and they came. Septate head line, death threats. No, off to hell with you. You Benedict. Arnold wanted beans. So I had to have security day and night up yours. Thanks for supporting the top hand. Hey Hanway proper Ellie, what are you, what do you believe in? If you go to Mills College in Oakland and we sent a reporter there, you will find 60,000 letters. They're not all negative but most are killed. But Congressman Lisa, she never faltered because right after the vote and she was in her office,

Speaker 6:          21:42          my dad called me, lieutenant colonel retired in the army. He said, I'm really proud of you. You know, and my dad had been in Korea and World War II and he, he sees it the way I see it because I really wasn't sure what he was saying cause you know, I really wasn't sure which you thought. All right, Daddy's proud of me.

Speaker 14:         22:04          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          22:05          now we should note that Barbara Lee is still a congress woman. She did not pay the price for that no vote. And whenever you think of of her vote, whether you think it was the right thing to do with the wrong thing to do, what is interesting to me is that as we're sitting here looking back on 12 years of war, she was sitting there 12 years ago looking forward and maybe she saw something about how this would play out, but how these, these words, these 60 words would start to grow and expand. That's next

Speaker 14:         22:38          [inaudible].

Speaker 6:          23:37          Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad, I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab, and today 60 words is the collaboration with buzz feed and report or Gregory Johnson.

Speaker 17:         23:46          The story is based on a, an article that Gregory wrote about the 60 simple words that have really defined American counter terrorism for more than a decade. It's called the authorization for use of military force that shortened do a u m F and it was passed by Congress three days after September 11th and here it is again read by Senator John McCain,

Speaker 18:         24:07          which says the president is authorized to use all necessary inappropriate force against those nations organizations or persons. He determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11 2001 are harbored such organizations or persons in order to prevent any future action of international terrorism against the United States by such nations organizations. Sure.

Speaker 17:         24:31          All right, so why would we be looking at that boring ass sentence? He seems seamless almost of saying it. Yeah, he does. Can I just be honest with you for a second? Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 19:         24:42          I generally move through the world with the assumption which is, which has been proven over and over again to be true. That I don't know how the world works. Like somehow I missed that day at school or something. Are you referring to something specific like a no, I'm free to a general sense that somehow like Oz is out there behind the curtain pulling levers and I'm just always going to be stuck on this side, you know? Yeah. I think it's what motivates the show for me. Is it like I just, I feel kind of stupid most of the time and these shows are a way to engage the world and really examine the world. Right, exactly. And when it comes to these matters of national security, I really feel clueless. And so when I read Gregory's article, uh, I felt like I understood something crucial for the first time. But the way words actually operate in the world,

Speaker 17:         25:29          because like again, this sentence, this totally boring sentence, this is the legal foundation for everything that the u s has done. Everything from Guantanamo Bay to drone strikes

Speaker 19:         25:37          to secret renditions to seal rates. It's all been hung off. These 60 words. One lawyer who was in the Bush administration said, look, this sentence is like a Christmas tree. All sorts of things have been hung off of this. But how, how?

Speaker 17:         25:53          Cause you read the thing and you don't see any mention of Guantanamo Bay in those 60 words. It doesn't mention detention. It doesn't mention drone strikes. It doesn't mention drone strikes against American citizens. You guys. So that guy. So one of the first folks we call to help us decode this. That's a, that's John Bellinger. I served as the [inaudible] Sir for the National Security Council from 2001 to 2005 and as the legal advisor for the Department of state from 2005 to 2009, you can't do any speed dating within with a credential like that, cause the date will be over yet. That's my congressional testimony voice. And we asked them like, okay, so a detention isn't anywhere in this document. So how do you read detention from these 60 words? The argument with which I am comfortable as illegal matter is he says, if you go eight words into those 60 words and you get to the phrase all necessary and appropriate force.

Speaker 17:         26:49          Oh, necessary, right? Yeah. You got to ask yourself, what is force? What does that mean? What do you do? You know what for us is, if I punch you in the face, that's the musing for it. That's one kind of force can use force to kill people. Uh, but a lesser use of force is to detain them. Detention is simply lesser included. Uh, and the use of force that comes naturally in a military operation. It's like a subset of force basically. So if you're authorized to use force to kill people, you are also by default authorized to use force to detain them, essentially to knock them out of the battle in other ways and that that forces both necessary and it's appropriate. And the courts have upheld that.

Speaker 20:         27:31          So that one word force, that is how you justifying Guantanamo Bay, all the controversy surrounding Guantanamo Bay continues. The authorization to use military force act has happened at military commissions. At this, I've been the legal basis for the detention of thousands of individuals and many of them have been detained for more than 10 years. None have ever been charged. And the words detention are never mentioned.

Speaker 17:         27:55          Okay. So that's the tension. If it gets even trickier, if you go just a few words past all necessarily inappropriate force to what you get to the mention of the enemy, who the forest is supposed to be used against. That's right. And it seems to be very limited language. Oh, you mean we can't shoot everybody or anybody? No, only the people who planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11 2001 oak harbor sounds much more, it sounds very much tethered to nine 11 right? Yeah. Which is why a lot of congress men and women voted for it. Joe Biden on the day of the vote, September 14th, 2001 he says,

Speaker 9:          28:32          look, people don't freak out about this language. It's relates to the incident and there's broad authority related to the incident. It does not relate to all terrorism every place, because we're just talking about all kind of

Speaker 17:         28:43          did this and the Taliban who have harbored them, right? Nope.

Speaker 9:          28:49          Not necessarily. Gregory Johnson. Again, over time what's happened is there's been this other sort of catchall category that has been read into these 60 words, even though it appears nowhere in these 60 words, and that catch all category is associated forces. Associated Forces. Yeah. What we've been calling these 61st and 62nd word wrestle time. It is special and few define the enemy as al-Qaida, the Taliban and associated forces. It's a whole different ballgame. Yeah. So when you read those, those, all those words that did not include the phrase associated forces is nowhere in the text. So where does who then, why could people cite something that isn't in the deck? This is one of the enduring mysteries of, of this. So the earliest example that we could find of those two words is in a 2000 and memo from

Speaker 1:          29:42          Deputy Secretary of Defense, Paul Wolfowitz. He defines the enemy as al-Qaida, the Taliban and associated forces. But the truth is it may have just been there from the beginning. What do you mean? Because according to Ben Witness from the Brookings Institution,

Speaker 21:         29:56          there is a concept in the laws of war called co belligerency. It's the idea that if you're at war with person a and person B is on personajes side in the war, you're also legally at war with person B. Makes

Speaker 1:          30:13          perfect sense. If you think of it in traditional war terms, cause like we're at war with Germany, Italy joins their side. So by default we're at war with Italy too, right? So just transpose out here. If we're at war with this group called al Qaeda and a certain set of groups that aren't them join the war on al Qaeda side, then you are legally at war with them. If you don't think about that too hard, it is crystal clear. But then the question that has arisen over time is how broad do you make that that circle? Cause the problem obviously is that we're, we're not talking about nation states anymore. We're talking about groups. So, okay. How close does the link to all Chi Eta and the people who carried out September 11th have to be, so if you have someone who's connected to someone who's connected to someone who's connected to someone who is connected to September 11 is that enough or is it only three lakes or can you be an associate and an associate?

Speaker 16:         31:06          Uh,

Speaker 19:         31:07          no, we can't exactly know how broadly the Obama and Bush administrations have defined those words. And we'll talk about why in a second. But you just have to look at the news, right? And you could see that like we started with a war that was in Afghanistan and then spread to a lot of different places. Pakistan, Libya, Somalia, Yemen. Yeah. And in Yemen there is a lot of debate and a lot of discussion about like, is this legal, does this have anything to do with September 11th anymore? Cause now the group in Yemen, all kid in the Arabian peninsula, which is a group that was first formed in 2009 they have their own hierarchy and their own structure. And it's not clear how and in what fashion. They take orders from either Osama bin Laden, why he,

Speaker 1:          31:51          it's still alive or now I am an [inaudible]. So does this make them an associated force or does it make them part of Al Qaeda? The answer, at least on good morning everyone. It is Friday, September 30th, 2011 market down on your calendar. Denver 30th 2011 seemed to be, yes. When the u s assassinated two members of the group,

Speaker 21:         32:10          this is not confirmed yet, but it could very well have been a u s Predator drone strike. That is a u s government attack.

Speaker 1:          32:17          Pretend to put all this in context between 2002 and 2014 according to some estimates, there've been about 65 drone strikes in Yemen killing about 400 people. So much hinges on how you define those words. So much is in the definition. I asked the Pentagon, I said, who? What are the list of associated forces? So all Chi Eta. Yes, U s is a war. That's clear. What about the other groups? Al Shabaab, al Qaeda in Iraq. I'll kite in the Islamic McGrath armed Islamic group. I would say of Jemiah as Amelia Brotherhood of this brotherhood of that who? Who are these groups? Who is the U S at war with? And the Pentagon emailed me back and they said the list is classified enough republican release. Wait, so we, who we are at, we're with, we don't know. I wait. So you're saying when you approached the Pentagon,

Speaker 17:         33:05          did they say that they will not tell you the names of the people were at war against? Well, maybe they shouldn't. It'd be that valuable. Well, don't you want to know as a citizen of America who were fighting? On the other hand, do I want to know as the, as if the United States has determined that I am dangerous to it. If it announces, then that would give me a certain amount of, uh, notice which I may perhaps would be disadvantageous to the United States. It could also though act as a disincentive for you to take action maybe, but maybe not. Maybe they will just get quieter, more dangerous.

Speaker 1:          33:46          I mean it's true. There might be reasons for this. They have not wanted to provide a public list because they, this is John Bellinger again. One, the groups move all the time. And so a few say, well these were associated groups. While then certain people just moved from Group A to group B and they also want to leave these different groups guessing, but it still raises democratic concerns if the American people don't really know who the executive branch believes is covered by the AUMF in a democracy and in a representative democracy that has to be weighed out. Should the citizens of the United States know who it is that the United States is targeting for death around the world, who it is that the United States is technically at war with? Should war be a decision that the citizens of a democracy of a representative democracy have a say?

Speaker 17:         34:34          Well, we're a representative democracy as you just said. So I'm assuming that the chairman of the House intelligence committee, he knows every item on that list. I'm not so sure. Morning everybody. The committee meets today to receive testimony on the law of armed conflict.

Speaker 1:          34:47          One of the more interesting Senate hearings took place in early 2013

Speaker 17:         34:53          including the status of the 2001 authorization for the use of military force. The AUMF,

Speaker 1:          34:59          the Senate Armed Services Committee. Um, Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, Chairman of the committee, Senator McCain is on the committee, like to welcome our witnesses. And Gregory says the senators call the couple of Defense Department officials to answer questions. Members committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify about the legal framework for the u s military operations to defend our nation. Cause they wanted to know like now that we're 12 years into this war, how are you using this document? Does it need to be changed? So the Department of defense officials, and there were four of them came and said, look, I believe that existing authorities are adequate for this armed conflict. Don't revisit this sentence. Don't repeal it. This sentence is sufficient. It gives us all the power that we need against Okada, yeah.

Speaker 22:         35:43          And associated forces.

Speaker 1:          35:44          And as they're laying out their case, they say those two words,

Speaker 22:         35:47          associated force, associated forces and associated forces, associated forces and associated force and associated forces and associated forces and they were associated forces, associated force and associated forces

Speaker 17:         36:00          instead of just nodding along. A lot of the senators were like, what gentlemen? I've only been here five months, but this is the most astounding and most astoundingly disturbing hearing that I've been to since I've been here. You guys have essentially rewritten the constitution here today.

Speaker 1:          36:14          That's Angus king, independent senator from Maine

Speaker 17:         36:16          and you keep using the term associated forces. You use it 13 times in your statement that is not in the AUMF and you said at one point it suits us very well. I assume it does suit you very well because you're rating it to cover everything

Speaker 1:          36:31          and anything. But one of the most striking moments of this hearing is when the head of the committee, Senator Carl Levin turns to one of the DOD officials and asks him, is there a list

Speaker 17:         36:41          now there, is there an existing list of groups that are affiliated with al-Qaida senator there? I'm not sure there's enlist per se. I'm very familiar with the organizations that we do consider a right now are affiliated with al Qaeda and I could provide you that. Listen, would you, would you give us that list? Yes sir. We can do that. And when you add or subtract names from that list, would you let us know? We can do that as well Mr Chairman to queue.

Speaker 6:          37:05          Let me just see if I understand what you just said at a committee hearing. Yeah. Say U S senator asks specifically, so who's on the list of people we were allowed to kill, right. That suggested that the Senate Arms Services Committee who had oversight really had no idea she pays one or like alright, if we don't have any idea who we're at war with in the Senate, arms services committee doesn't seem to have any idea. Then who does? Well, one of the things that became clear to me as I was reporting on this story was that many of the people who are making these decisions but had never been elected by anyone to any position and they were the ones who were making the decision, not the elected represented. And so who are they

Speaker 21:         37:50          going to be in YC right thing? I guess so. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          37:54          So we were rooting around for awhile looking for an answer to that question until we found this guy. This is Daniel Kleidman. He's a journalist and I've covered national security, uh, and counter terrorism for many years and based on hundreds of confidential interviews that became his book killer capture. He was able to paint a picture for us of who makes these decisions and how he told us about these meetings. You say it's the s T v s meetings. What are they? Who's in the room? How did the events unfold?

Speaker 17:         38:21          Well, these are the, they called them, uh, civets meetings in the vernacular of the bureaucracy. It stands for secure video teleconference meetings.

Speaker 1:          38:31          You described them as a sort of a massive top secret Google hangout where literally hundreds

Speaker 17:         38:36          of people from throughout the national security bureaucracy login to decide who's on the list and who isn't and who should live and who should die. You said literally hundreds, literally hundreds of people. Now, many of them are backbenchers. They're not participating in the call, but they're taking notes before they get together. In this meeting. Many of the folks at this meeting, he says they're given a little packets of information on each targets. They call them baseball cards because they sort of look like you got a picture and some stats like Yogi Berra on one side, and then you got his batting average and his hometown on the back, the terrorist equivalent of all of that. So who is this person? Where does he ranked and what kinds of operations has he been involved in in the past? Eventually a general will come on the screen and say, here's our target objective Akron. For some reason he says they always refer to the targets by the name of American cities. Objective. Toledo general might say, target is in Yemen. We have a drone over our head, there's an opportunity to kill this person. Can we legally do it? And the fascinating thing, although maybe it won't come as much of a surprise, is that the people he's making this pitch to are not generals, but lawyers,

Speaker 3:          39:41          Aaron lawyers everywhere. That is just a basic fact of modern warfare. Says John Bellinger, you know, have lawyers on the ground with artillery units, 10 commanders, lawyers in Kevlar, lawyers and helicopters. They are lawyers really

Speaker 1:          39:54          almost behind every bomb, just lawyers everywhere. And that's a very good thing. That's Harold Koh. He was the top lawyer at the State Department from 2009 to 2013 because it means that we're not just shooting away at people willy nilly or because we're angry at them or anything. It's a considered careful decision. Now, Harold Co Cordie, the Dan Klaban's reporting was in those civets meetings and he would often be the one to answer the general's questions. Can we legally kill this person? So we asked him like if lawyers are now the ones deciding who we are at war with and who we aren't, how do you do it and unfortunately for us, I don't know they're going get into that on this call. There are multiple methods but I'm not going to go into that. He said he couldn't comment on any of it because it's classified but

Speaker 3:          40:45          Harold Co is a creative lawyer according to Dan Kleiman who spoke with a lot of people familiar with the process. Co in particular had a fascinating way of determining who is and is not an associated force. In other words we are or aren't at war with and it seems to be less about the groups as a whole and more about individuals within the group. For example, a seniority. That was a an important issue for Co. If you're going to target a guy, he has to be a senior member of group like al-Qaida, right? He has to be able to give orders and he has to be unique within the organization. You couldn't simply under Harold coast theory go after say a driver or a cook who was in a Al-qaida or even foot soldiers, uh, because, uh, they were fungible, meaning they could be easily replaced. Another criteria was whether they were externally oriented

Speaker 17:         41:34          for Co. If they were just participants in a civil war, you couldn't target them. But if they were targeting westerners or Western interests, then yes. So if you take Dan Clyde mins account of Harold Co's criteria as a representative and we personally have no way of verifying it. But if you take that as the norm, then maybe there is a strong vetting process in place. But I interviewed, um, numerous people who participated in these meetings. And one of the things that, um, I heard over and over again was it that there was this kind of an extra bubble momentum toward killing and that the military people in these meetings could speak with a kind of a tone of do or die urgency. In fact, two of the people who I quote in my book used exactly the same metaphor to describe that sense of momentum that was very difficult to resist.

Speaker 17:         42:25          It was like standing on a train track with a train hurdling towards him at a hundred miles an hour. Cause then I guess like the important question for me is like how often do they say no? Well, it should've been 99 times. Yes. And one time no. Or 50 times. Yes and 50 times, no. Yeah. How many nos are there? Well look, I, I'd say I did not come across many, many examples, but he did tell us about this one instance. This was a meeting between the top lawyer at the Defense Department and then a man named Jay Johnson and the top lawyer at the State Department who was then Harold Harold Co and according to Dan sources, Harold Koh, j Johnson were faced with determining the fate of a 40 year old man, roughly 40 named Schaef Multi-hour Robo. I think that's the right way to say his name. I'm not sure. He's a member of the Smalley group, l Shabaab.

Speaker 17:         43:19          And for context news, World Cup celebrations have turned to tragedy in the central African nation of Uganda. A few months before this conversation, this is in 2010, Al Shabaab bombed a rugby club and a restaurant at the same time in Uganda killing 74 people, breaking chairs, smashed tables, and the sounds of pain as rescuers search for the living and the dead. So that just happened. And according to Dan Kleidman at this moment in intelligence circles, there was a debate raging as to whether Al Shabaab should or should not be considered an associated force. Okay. Time their leader had sworn allegiance to Osama bin Laden, but their agenda was primarily a local agenda. They had never struck out against the United States or against American interests in the region. So you've got the top lawyer at the State Department and the top lawyer at the Pentagon facing off as to whether this fellow Robo from Al Shabaab should live or die.

Speaker 17:         44:16          And how does this work? Does somebody just like just someone pound the table? Yes. This was, this was a very heated meeting. Jay Johnson, um, argued vehemently that Robo was covered under the AUMF. He was after all, a founding member of al-shabaab. Harold Koh vehemently disagreed. Harold Co's conclusion based on the evidence. And the intelligence that he saw was that Robo was not externally focused. In fact, he belonged to a faction of Al Shabaab that was arguing against attacking the United States and other Western interests. So according to Kleidman, these two men went back and forth and back and forth until eventually Harold Koh just drew a hard line and essentially said, look, if you do this, you need to know that you will be doing it over the unambiguous objections of the State Department's legal advisor. The unambiguous, and that's very strong language coming from a lawyer. And the signal that it's sent to the White House was you will be taking a military action, even though the top lawyer at the State Department has said that this would be an illegal action. All right. So what happened? Did they decide not to? They did not do it.

Speaker 14:         45:26          [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          45:26          this is not academic. It's, it's, um, lives depend on which way the decision goes.

Speaker 14:         45:38          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          45:39          authorized [inaudible] land on the rise committed or eight in the terrorist attacks on September 3rd on September 11 2000 [inaudible]

Speaker 17:         45:54          we'll continue in a moment.

Speaker 23:         46:01          This is Jim Donahue from Fort Worth, Texas.

Speaker 17:         46:25          hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich. This is Radiolab today. We've devoted the intro. We're continuing to devote the entire show to a single sentence. One sentence, 60 words. That's all. It's the 2001 authorization to use military force was signed into law on September 18th, 2001 and together with buzzfeed and reporter Gregory Johnson, we have, we have manhandled these words. We have dissected, we have bisected, trisector and whatever other kinds of sectors you could want resected. Who the AUMF as it's called. Yes. And you know, we've looked at how the, the, the sentence has defined the our last 12 years of counterterrorism. Now how will it define our future? Gentlemen. Thank you for being here today. This is a very, so when we were thinking about that Senate Arms Services Committee hearing, we ended up calling someone who sat on the committee, Tim Kaine, Senator from Virginia and who was there that day. Yeah, that was a, that was a very uh, kinda hair-raising day and Senator Kaine told us that one of the most hair-raising moments for him was when one of his fellow senators, Lindsey Graham asked one of the Department of defense officials, do you agree with me the war against Islam or Tara or whatever description like to provide will go on after the second term of President Obama.

Speaker 17:         47:37          In other words, how long do you think this particular war as declared in the section is going to go on? Then in my judgment, this is gonna go on for quite awhile and yes, beyond the Turks, second term of the president and beyond this term of Congress. Yes sir. I think it's at least 10 to 20 years.

Speaker 13:         47:55          [inaudible] it was chilling cause like this is already the longest war in the history. United States along the Vietnam and now a dod official is saying add on 10 or 20 years. So, um, I said and use it, the administration's position that you tell me if, if somebody who's born after nine 11, let's imagine in 2030, they join a group that has just become associated with al-Qaida in 2030 is that the administration's position at the AUMF would, would cover them and those organizations. And without hesitation, the, uh, the administration witnesses said yes, as long as they become an associated force under the, uh, the, the legal standard that was set out, it's not limited in time, not limited in geography, really troubling. Um, but you know, I'm also troubled by another thing, right?

Speaker 17:         48:44          I mean, you know, the iconic, uh, it's a New York picture of a VJ Day kiss and Times Square.

Speaker 4:          48:51          I used to be in a car [inaudible] we have a combination of every type from typing

Speaker 17:         48:56          August 14th, 1945, there ought to be a day where those who have served in war that you declare that the war is over and then you celebrate it.

Speaker 4:          49:06          All these people happy. That's the only white [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 17:         49:15          you can ask sometimes by service families, like when is this gonna end? Does it ever come up? Yes, yes, yes. You told us that something like one in three people in his state of Virginia are connected to the military. So he does get that question a lot. And the truth is we all want to VJ day, we need it. And so seven days after that, Senate Arms Services Committee hearing

Speaker 21:         49:39          President Obama, it is a great honor, gave a speech to return to the National Defense University

Speaker 17:         49:47          where he seems to say basically it's time,

Speaker 21:         49:50          this war, like all wars must end. That's what history advises. That is why I intend to engage congress about the existing authorization to use military force or AUM at

Speaker 17:         50:06          basically announces that he would like to get rid of those 60 words and in this war. Yeah, but common sense tells you, yeah,

Speaker 13:         50:15          that these are different kind of enemy, not a state or a government. They just, they make war, uh, in a different way. Senator McCain has a great line. He goes, look, we're in an age of warfare where the war isn't going to end with the signing of a peace treaty on the deck of the destroyer. That's not how it happens these days. There no clear start and ending. And yet the president, he wants to end the war, suspend widows, and every war has come to an end. He sees himself as a person who came in to a country fighting two wars and he brought them all to an end. And I think he wants to have done that. But how, how do you, how do you do that? How do you end a war

Speaker 1:          50:54          when the vast amount of people that you're calling the enemy haven't stopped fighting? Yeah.

Speaker 21:         50:58          So what he does, America cannot in the May speech, and it's extremely clever and by the way, it's really well lawyer, is he announces a set of rules going forward for drone strikes. America does not take strikes to punish individuals. We act against terrorists who pose a continuing an eminent threat to the American people that he's only gonna use drone strikes when there's an imminent threat capable.

Speaker 1:          51:27          And it's well understood by people who understand this kind of stuff, that in the constitution and also in international law, the president is allowed to act unilaterally in self-defense when there is an imminent threat, meaning it's urgent and you can't feasibly capture that person. Ben Fears that what President Obama was doing there by stressing that word,

Speaker 21:         51:49          an imminent threat to the American people.

Speaker 1:          51:52          You said he was laying a new foundation.

Speaker 3:          51:56          You're saying when the AUMF ends and I want it to end, I do have another way of justifying all these things. Maybe they wouldn't change. So the drone strikes and the rates would, would continue as long as you have a capacious enough understanding of what the word imminent means, you might be able to continue a whole lot of this stuff and then you don't have to go to Congress at all and you can say you've ended the war and the human rights groups will cheer for you and we're going to mysteriously find that there are a whole lot of imminent threats for freedom.

Speaker 21:         52:35          Thank you very much everybody. God bless you.

Speaker 4:          52:38          Hey God bless the United States of America.

Speaker 3:          52:46          And in the context of what happened to those 60 words, you do have to wonder what's going to happen to a word like imminent. And all the while according to Ben Witness and pretty much everyone we spoke with, we haven't really answered the big questions. When do we want to attack the enemy? Who is the enemy? And if we're going to be fighting them even when we're not technically at war with them, then what's the difference between war and peace?

Speaker 4:          53:24          And that's why this whole subject

Speaker 5:          53:26          is so unsettling. And again, if you don't know the common sense definition anymore of when you're at war and when you're at peace, then how do you, how do you write rules? Yeah. This was an attempt to begin opal war and a, so it had the usual beginning questions. Okay, you who are you? Are you out there where you for how long until you surrender and know you're not going to surrender? Like all of the usual, uh, business of warfare is, it doesn't apply in this case. So then you have to think of, now what do we do? [inaudible] yeah, it's just like one long improvisation. [inaudible]
