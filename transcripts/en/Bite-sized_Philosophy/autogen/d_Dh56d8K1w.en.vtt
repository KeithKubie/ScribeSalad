00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 align:start position:0%
what is it the answer is you don't know
 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.630 align:start position:0%
what is it the answer is you don't know

and that's why when you pick it up you
 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.179 align:start position:0%
and that's why when you pick it up you
get<00:01:03.329><c> this</c><00:01:03.539><c> paralyzed</c><00:01:04.379><c> sinking</c><00:01:04.949><c> feeling</c>

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:25.070 align:start position:0%
past and I can enumerate more of them if
you'd<00:07:23.490><c> like</c><00:07:23.550><c> and</c><00:07:23.910><c> so</c><00:07:24.360><c> it</c><00:07:24.480><c> doesn't</c><00:07:24.750><c> that's</c>

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:25.080 align:start position:0%
you'd like and so it doesn't that's
 

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
you'd like and so it doesn't that's
actually<00:07:25.500><c> what</c><00:07:25.620><c> you</c><00:07:25.650><c> like</c><00:07:25.920><c> and</c><00:07:26.220><c> I</c><00:07:26.370><c> tried</c>

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:26.970 align:start position:0%
actually what you like and I tried
 

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:28.370 align:start position:0%
actually what you like and I tried
fixing<00:07:27.360><c> you</c><00:07:27.420><c> and</c><00:07:27.540><c> didn't</c><00:07:27.780><c> work</c><00:07:27.900><c> and</c><00:07:28.170><c> so</c><00:07:28.260><c> it</c>

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:28.380 align:start position:0%
fixing you and didn't work and so it
 

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:29.300 align:start position:0%
fixing you and didn't work and so it
looks<00:07:28.530><c> like</c><00:07:28.590><c> you're</c><00:07:28.770><c> going</c><00:07:28.890><c> to</c><00:07:28.920><c> be</c><00:07:29.040><c> like</c><00:07:29.190><c> that</c>

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:29.310 align:start position:0%
looks like you're going to be like that
 

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:30.770 align:start position:0%
looks like you're going to be like that

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:30.780 align:start position:0%
up into the future and you're basically
 

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:32.510 align:start position:0%
up into the future and you're basically
saying<00:07:31.050><c> to</c><00:07:31.230><c> them</c><00:07:31.380><c> well</c><00:07:31.800><c> you're</c><00:07:32.010><c> a</c><00:07:32.040><c> bad</c><00:07:32.250><c> person</c>

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:34.440 align:start position:0%
and the only thing they can do is either
 

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:37.370 align:start position:0%
and the only thing they can do is either
collapse<00:07:35.250><c> or</c><00:07:35.520><c> punch</c><00:07:36.030><c> you</c><00:07:36.240><c> and</c><00:07:36.450><c> punching</c><00:07:37.350><c> you</c>

collapse or punch you and punching you
 

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:39.320 align:start position:0%
collapse or punch you and punching you
is<00:07:37.560><c> actually</c><00:07:37.890><c> better</c><00:07:38.130><c> than</c><00:07:38.310><c> collapsing</c><00:07:39.090><c> but</c>

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:39.330 align:start position:0%
is actually better than collapsing but
 

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:40.370 align:start position:0%
is actually better than collapsing but
you<00:07:39.450><c> don't</c><00:07:39.600><c> you</c><00:07:39.690><c> know</c><00:07:39.750><c> what</c><00:07:39.840><c> I</c><00:07:39.900><c> mean</c><00:07:40.050><c> it's</c><00:07:40.230><c> such</c>

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:40.380 align:start position:0%
you don't you know what I mean it's such
 

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:42.170 align:start position:0%
you don't you know what I mean it's such

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:42.180 align:start position:0%
a counterproductive way of arguing they
 

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:43.850 align:start position:0%
a counterproductive way of arguing they
you<00:07:42.480><c> don't</c><00:07:42.660><c> leave</c><00:07:42.810><c> the</c><00:07:42.930><c> person</c><00:07:43.230><c> any</c><00:07:43.350><c> out</c><00:07:43.530><c> and</c>

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:43.860 align:start position:0%
you don't leave the person any out and
 

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:46.400 align:start position:0%
you don't leave the person any out and
so<00:07:44.400><c> maybe</c><00:07:44.580><c> while</c><00:07:45.480><c> they're</c><00:07:45.660><c> civilized</c><00:07:45.870><c> so</c><00:07:46.320><c> it</c>

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:46.410 align:start position:0%
so maybe while they're civilized so it
 

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:48.500 align:start position:0%
so maybe while they're civilized so it
doesn't<00:07:46.680><c> get</c><00:07:46.770><c> physical</c><00:07:47.310><c> well</c><00:07:47.490><c> maybe</c><00:07:48.300><c> that's</c>

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:48.510 align:start position:0%
doesn't get physical well maybe that's
 

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:50.150 align:start position:0%
doesn't get physical well maybe that's
good<00:07:48.720><c> and</c><00:07:48.870><c> maybe</c><00:07:49.020><c> it</c><00:07:49.140><c> isn't</c><00:07:49.290><c> but</c><00:07:49.620><c> then</c><00:07:50.010><c> they</c>

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
good and maybe it isn't but then they
 

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:51.980 align:start position:0%
good and maybe it isn't but then they
