00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
This simple design of blowgun can be made in just a few minutes and for only a couple dollars.

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:10.049
It uses soft reusable ear plugs as ammunition and can be decorated in dozens of different ways.

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:20.899
I'm betting a lot of you have seen made or used the toy guns that use marshmallows as ammunition.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:21.520
Those are pretty fun, but marshmallows have some severe downsides.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.000
If you play around with marshmallows for a while

00:00:29.389 --> 00:00:30.140
There's a good chance

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:36.110
you'll end up with some of it stuck to the floor and your shoe. In addition to being really sticky marshmallows can also attract ants

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:37.160
and other pests.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.779
So we wanted to come up with a way that we could use something similar to a marshmallow that doesn't have those

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.050
downsides. These small orange ear plugs are pretty similar to marshmallows in a few different ways: they're small,  they're very squishy

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.009
and they're soft enough that even if they hit you at a high speed. It's not really gonna hurt. I

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.570
wanted to find a good way to make a blowgun that uses these ear plugs as a projectile.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.660
Normally marshmallow guns are built out of 1/2 inch PVC,

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.470
but the diameter of these ear plugs is small enough that in 1/2 inch PVC too much air travels around them

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.709
And you don't get much velocity. After walking around the hardware store for a while,

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.789
I found this stuff called PEX tubing which is usually something that runs through your walls

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.990
carrying water from one part of your house to another.  This PEX tubing is lightweight very low cost and best of all is a

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.849
perfect fit for these foam ear plugs. A 5-foot length of this tubing costs less than

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.999
$2 and best of all it comes in multiple colors.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.099
If you are in a dire situation in an earplug based war and you need a weapon

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.509
ASAP it can be as simple as cutting one of these pieces of tubing to the length you want,

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.880
loading in an air plug and joining the game.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.720
The piping easily cuts with a knife or hacksaw.

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.870
As is this works as a blowgun. Carry around a handful of your earplugs, and you can start shooting

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.769
But it's not very exciting in fact.

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.810
It's just about the most boring looking weapon I have ever seen. So what I think we need to do is find a way to

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.869
decorate this and just overall make it a little more snazzy

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.519
Decorations are made easily with tape or if you like the original coloring of the piping you can leave it like that. It might be

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:24.369
a good way to split things up into teams of red or blue

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.069
I want to try making one of these blowguns a little bit more tactical.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.440
So I'm gonna try adding some hand grips a little bandolier that holds multiple shots and maybe a sight down at one end.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.920
Those hand grips look good now. Let's see if we can add something in the middle that will work to store ammunition.

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.940
Bullseye

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:20.440
If you're a fan of the old classical marshmallow gun shooter style these, 1/2 inch copper adapter pieces fit

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:26.619
beautifully over our PEX piping. We can lay out whatever style we want attach all of the pieces using just a little bit of glue,

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.800
and then we'll have a little bit more of a gun style ear plug shooter.

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.669
These earplugs don't make it around of tight corners very well because it fits so closely into the PEX.

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.410
But we can load an ear plug into the back,  put our thumb over the hole and then fire.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.530
Our blow guns are working great and for the most part this ammunition would even be safe to shoot at other people well.

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.530
Let's build a fun little target out of it anyway.

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:11.819
We've got ear plugs as ammunition, so it kind of seemed right that what we shoot at is an ear.

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:43.229
It is too sensitive.

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:49.858
Got seven out of nine with the ammunition I have in the gun.  Not bad!

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.500
Hey, what's up guys is grant here with a brand new Galaxy
