 (rock music)

00:00:05.538 --> 00:00:07.073
 - So, yeah, hey, my
 name is Mark Normand,

00:00:07.106 --> 00:00:09.208 size:88% position:44%
 from New Orleans, Lousiana.

00:00:09.241 --> 00:00:10.410
Who dat?

00:00:10.443 --> 00:00:14.147 align:start size:88% position:13%
And I started comedy
there at a real dive bar

00:00:15.548 --> 00:00:19.218
 I got hammered, I had a yeast
 infection and I got hammered

00:00:19.251 --> 00:00:21.187 align:start size:88% position:13%
and I talked about it
and it went pretty well.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.056
 And then I moved to New York.

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:23.790 size:88% position:44%
 A couple of friends
 of mine moved up.

00:00:23.823 --> 00:00:25.558
 I said, "I'm going with ya."

00:00:25.591 --> 00:00:27.293 align:start size:88% position:13%
 Moved to Crown
 Heights, Brooklyn, got
 mugged three times,

00:00:27.326 --> 00:00:30.696
 landlord died of AIDS, and
 the first night I was there,

00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:33.132 size:88% position:44%
  there was a pigeon
  in my apartment.

00:00:33.165 --> 00:00:35.735
I like a good Netflix document.

00:00:35.768 --> 00:00:37.136 size:88% position:44%
  Occasionally, I'll
  hit a treadmill.

00:00:37.169 --> 00:00:39.205 size:88% position:44%
 I like to put on a
 little Van Morrison

00:00:39.238 --> 00:00:41.707 align:start size:88% position:13%
 and look at people's
 Facebook photos.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.242
 You ever do that, just
 stay up late at night,

00:00:43.275 --> 00:00:46.345 size:84% position:42%
  looking for that bikini
  shot of a girl, you know?

00:00:46.378 --> 00:00:48.381
 Alright, finally, I've
 got that Florida trip.

00:00:48.414 --> 00:00:49.649
 There we go.

00:00:49.682 --> 00:00:50.517
Alright.

00:00:51.684 --> 00:00:54.187 align:start size:88% position:13%
 Have a glass of
 red wine, you know.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.521 size:88% position:44%
 Good times.

00:00:55.554 --> 00:00:57.657
(laughs)

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.525
You guys do that, right?

00:00:59.558 --> 00:01:03.129 align:start size:88% position:13%
 Today I spent the
 whole day on Facebook?

00:01:03.162 --> 00:01:04.664
 (crowd laughs)

00:01:04.697 --> 00:01:05.798 size:84% position:42%
  Let me ask you guys this.

00:01:05.832 --> 00:01:06.966 align:start position:0%
 You guys ever Google something
 and you notice on your

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.136
 Facebook wall, there's an ad
 for the thing you Googled?

00:01:10.169 --> 00:01:12.105
 Well, what the hell is that?

00:01:12.138 --> 00:01:13.206
I was on my Facebook wall today,

00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:15.141 size:84% position:42%
  there was an ad
  for sexy cougars.

00:01:15.174 --> 00:01:16.642
 (crowd laughs)

00:01:16.675 --> 00:01:20.746
I was like, hey Google,
that was between us.

00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:22.515
 (crowd laughs)

00:01:22.548 --> 00:01:24.383 align:start position:0%
  First of all, I've had
  every bad job in the book.

00:01:24.416 --> 00:01:26.452
Busboy, I was a furniture mover,

00:01:26.485 --> 00:01:29.189
 I was an office temp, janitor.

00:01:30.723 --> 00:01:31.824
Janitor, worst job ever.

00:01:31.858 --> 00:01:35.394 align:start position:0%
Got fired because I was
mopping - true story - mopping,

00:01:35.427 --> 00:01:38.764
 a guy slipped, he yelled at
 me for not putting a sign out

00:01:38.797 --> 00:01:41.300 size:84% position:42%
  but I was mopping
  in front of him.

00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:44.337
 I'm mopping in front of you,
 what, what, what's the sign?

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:45.171 size:84% position:42%
  What's the point?

00:01:45.204 --> 00:01:46.139
 I am the sign?

00:01:46.172 --> 00:01:47.607 size:88% position:44%
 Quit every other job I had.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.709 align:start position:0%
 I would, I'm, I'm such a
 pussy that I can't quit stuff,

00:01:49.742 --> 00:01:52.111 size:84% position:42%
  so I would just tell, I'd
  be like, my grandmother,

00:01:52.144 --> 00:01:54.380 align:start position:0%
  she won't leave my
  apartment, I've got to go,

00:01:54.413 --> 00:01:55.815
 you know, fight her.

00:01:55.848 --> 00:01:57.517
 I can't come back into work.

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.785 align:start position:0%
  I'm running a cock fight,
  I can't come back in.

00:01:59.818 --> 00:02:02.054 align:start position:0%
 Like, I'd just make up all
 these crazy excuses, you know.

00:02:02.087 --> 00:02:03.122
(laughs)

00:02:03.155 --> 00:02:05.591 size:84% position:42%
  I used to live with an
  Asian guy, a Chinese guy,

00:02:05.624 --> 00:02:08.094 align:start position:0%
 and one time, we were
 walking around in Brooklyn,

00:02:08.127 --> 00:02:09.529 size:84% position:42%
  somebody called
  him a "Chinaman."

00:02:09.562 --> 00:02:10.763 size:88% position:44%
  He was devastated.

00:02:10.796 --> 00:02:11.597
 But can we all agree
 that's definitely

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.466 size:84% position:42%
  the gentlest of
  the racial slurs.

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:15.134
 (crowd laughs)

00:02:15.167 --> 00:02:16.669 align:start position:0%
  And he was saying, no
  it's horrible racial slur,

00:02:16.702 --> 00:02:19.272
and I was like, he's
from China, he's a man.

00:02:19.305 --> 00:02:20.773 size:88% position:44%
  That's not so bad.

00:02:20.806 --> 00:02:23.209 size:88% position:44%
 To me, I think the names of
 Chinese restaurants sound

00:02:23.242 --> 00:02:25.211
 a lot more like racial slurs.

00:02:25.244 --> 00:02:26.779 size:88% position:44%
 I remember seeing a
 Chinese restaurant,

00:02:26.812 --> 00:02:29.282 size:84% position:42%
  it was called like, Panda
  Express, and I was, like,

00:02:29.315 --> 00:02:31.050
that sounds like a racial slur.

00:02:31.083 --> 00:02:32.585 size:84% position:42%
  You know who can't drive?

00:02:32.618 --> 00:02:34.820 size:88% position:44%
 Those god-damn Panda Kings.

00:02:34.853 --> 00:02:35.654
 (crowd laughs)

00:02:35.687 --> 00:02:38.157 size:88% position:44%
  I'll tell you that
  right now, yeah.

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.024
And listen to this, one
of those Golden Noodles

00:02:39.058 --> 00:02:40.726 size:88% position:44%
 just moved into my
 apartment building.

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:41.827
 (crowd laughs)

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.064 size:84% position:42%
  Those guys really burn me
  up, those Lucky Dragon.

00:02:45.097 --> 00:02:47.099
 (crowd laughs)

00:02:47.132 --> 00:02:49.569
