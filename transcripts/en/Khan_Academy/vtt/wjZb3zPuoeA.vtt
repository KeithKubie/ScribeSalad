00:00:01.267 --> 00:00:06.000
What I want to do in this video is show you a very cool video, then pose a question.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.667
But I want to make sure that everything is up and up,

00:00:08.667 --> 00:00:10.867
in terms of the copyright laws.

00:00:10.867 --> 00:00:14.000
So the video I want to show you is from the show called the fifth gear,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
that appears on channel 5, I believe in the United Kingdom.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.667
I think I'm okay on good copyright grounds to claim

00:00:21.667 --> 00:00:23.159
fair use here, because

00:00:23.159 --> 00:00:26.164
obviously the point of this is I'm going to ask a math question

00:00:26.164 --> 00:00:28.185
about the vide were going to see

00:00:28.185 --> 00:00:28.685
and so fair use

00:00:28.685 --> 00:00:29.185
laws

00:00:29.185 --> 00:00:31.108
the purpose and character of use

00:00:31.108 --> 00:00:34.708
including whether such a commercial nature or non profit educational

00:00:34.708 --> 00:00:36.933
purposes we're definitely the later

00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:39.067
non profit educational purposes

00:00:39.067 --> 00:00:40.533
we are actually

00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:43.667
we aren't trying to in any way replace the work being used

00:00:43.667 --> 00:00:47.133
I'm just going to show a little snippet of it

00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:49.836
so we can use it as the basis for a problem

00:00:49.836 --> 00:00:52.533
this is kinda the meat of fair use law

00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:56.200
the viewer may fairly cite from the original work if it is

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.200
design if his design be really and truly to use the passages

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.600
for the purposes for fair and reasonable criticism

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.708
in this case

00:01:03.708 --> 00:01:06.867
it's fair and reasonable math problem or physics problem

00:01:06.867 --> 00:01:12.267
on the other hand it is as clear he thus cites the most important parts of the work. with the view not to criticize

00:01:12.267 --> 00:01:14.933
but to supercede the

00:01:14.933 --> 00:01:16.733
the use of the original work and substitute

00:01:16.733 --> 00:01:18.333
the review for it

00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:21.667
such a use will be deemed in law a piracy

00:01:21.667 --> 00:01:26.333
so in no way do I want to supersede it. You should go look it up, go watch the show.

00:01:26.333 --> 00:01:27.933
this is not good enough

00:01:27.933 --> 00:01:29.667
I don't even have the sound on

00:01:29.667 --> 00:01:31.600
it's going to be a small window over here

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.400
where I'm just going to show this

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.533
really really

00:01:33.533 --> 00:01:36.267
the part where they actually do a loop

00:01:36.267 --> 00:01:37.067
de loop.

00:01:37.067 --> 00:01:39.200
now with that out of the way

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.733
this is where you can find more about fifth gear

00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:43.533
which is on channel 5

00:01:43.533 --> 00:01:46.067
so now let me show you the video

00:01:46.067 --> 00:01:49.600
I'm going to have the sound down and so this is the video over here

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.800
this is a pretty neat video

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.067
this guy is going to try to do a loop de loop and he's actually going to succeed

00:01:55.067 --> 00:01:56.533
at doing the loop de loop

00:01:56.533 --> 00:01:59.200
and what I want you to do, the question I want to pose

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.933
is look at this video

00:02:00.933 --> 00:02:03.467
and get a stop watch out

00:02:03.467 --> 00:02:05.733
or whatever else you need out a ruler whatever else you might need to do

00:02:05.733 --> 00:02:07.200
and try to figure out what

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.067
we're going to try to figure out two things

00:02:10.067 --> 00:02:12.200
we're going to find out the minimum velocity the car needs to do the

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.467
loop de loop

00:02:13.467 --> 00:02:15.667
and we're also going to try to figure out what his actual velocity was

00:02:15.667 --> 00:02:19.133
over the course of the loop de loop

00:02:19.133 --> 00:02:21.333
so let's actually just watch this video

00:02:21.333 --> 00:02:22.267
so there he goes

00:02:22.267 --> 00:02:23.333
he's starting

00:02:23.333 --> 00:02:24.267
he's accelerating

00:02:24.267 --> 00:02:25.000
it looks like he's

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.600
just crossed

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.867
he's pushing almost forty miles an hour

00:02:28.867 --> 00:02:31.200
at least I'm assuming that's miles per hour

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.533
this is a British show

00:02:32.533 --> 00:02:34.133
and then he

00:02:34.133 --> 00:02:35.667
hits

00:02:35.667 --> 00:02:38.867
the loop de loop

00:02:38.867 --> 00:02:40.400
and then he finishes it

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.800
and he's done

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.000
so let's think about for the next video

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.533
let's think about if we can figure out what the minimum

00:02:46.533 --> 00:02:51.733
what the minimum velocity or i should say the magnitude of the velocity

00:02:51.733 --> 00:02:53.267
or the speed had to be

00:02:53.267 --> 00:02:53.767
to actually

00:02:53.767 --> 00:02:57.533
complete the loop right over here and then we can actually get a stopwatch later on to

00:02:57.533 --> 99:59:59.999
see what his actall velocity was
