00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
Jeff Lagarias, a mathematician I admire a lot, thinks it's one of the hardest problems around.

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.320
Erdos actually said "this is a problem for which mathematics is perhaps not ready"

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.840
Turns out that all this fuss is about a problem that any fourth-grader can understand.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.700
To show you how this all works I'm gonna give you an example:

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.200
Brady, chose a number between one and ten.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.700
[Brady, off camera: I shall go for seven]

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:23.340
Alright, let us start with seven.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.040
Now,  I'm gonna apply two rules depending on what number I get

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.120
I'm gonna do this in succession

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.780
[..] then if n is even I'm gonna take n and divide it by two

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.460
If n is odd then I'm gonna take n

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.940
Can't divide it by two and get a whole number

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.400
so I'm gonna take n and multiply it by three and add one

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.880
Those are my rules.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:49.000
and I'm interested in what happens to n. Does it grow to infinity? Does it get small?

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.620
let's see what happens with 7

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:57.000
7 seems to be an odd number, so I multiply by 3 and add 1. Three times seven is 21

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:03.740
check me on this, and add one is 22. I go to 22. 22 is certainly even

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:11.220
so I'll divide by two and get eleven. Eleven is odd, so I'll multiply by 3, getting 33 and add one and get 34.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.400
34 is even, I divide by 2 and I get 17

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:21.940
so far it's going up and down. But 34 was the biggest yet, so maybe it's headed off to infinity after all.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.340
17... so 17 is odd, I multiply by 3

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:32.820
3 times 10 is 30, 3 times 7 is 21. 51 plus 1 is 52. Even.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:39.660
divide by 2 and get 26. still even. divide by 2 again and get 13. now it's odd.

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.540
multiply by 3 and add one. 40. 40 is even.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:54.120
I divide, I get 20. I divide again I get 10. I divide again, I get 5. Boy, we fell down a long way! Maybe we're heading for a small number after all.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.660
multiply by 3 and add 1, I get 16. Whoa! 16. VERY even number!

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:07.620
I get 8. I get 4. I get 2. And I get 1.

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:14.280
If I do it again, something interesting happens. I go 3 times 1 plus one is four.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:21.020
whoops, I'm back to 4. But now I'm just going to cycle forever, going through 1 over and over again.

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.780
So I got to one. Seven got to one.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:31.000
Now,  people have tried lots of numbers beginning this way, and so far, all of them have gone to one.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.760
They've tried roughly two to the sixtieth numbers, that's almost ten to the twentieth...

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:43.500
So the famous Collatz conjecture says that every number, every whole number, will eventually get to one.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:49.620
And a huge amount of work has been done on this problem by combinatorialists, by number theorists.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.880
This is the problem that maybe mathematics is not ready for,

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:59.460
but that any fourth grader could play with and try, right? Try some numbers.

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:04.400
First of all, we'd like to understand what's happening, in such a way that we can say for certainty

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.200
that every number, all the numbers we haven't ever tried, WILL get to one.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.840
You could just try this on your computer; it's a good test for your personal computer too.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.840
How fast a program can you make?

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:22.020
Here's a little hint. Every time I take an odd number and multiply by three and add one, I get an even number.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.320
So why not take two steps at once?

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:31.480
to three n plus one over two. Combine those two steps...

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.560
when I get and odd number. that speeds things up a bit. And there are other tricks like that.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:43.340
So people make graphs like this, and they're called "trees". Right. So far, all the number go down to one,

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.440
but we might start with another number.
If we started with five,

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.960
we already see what the answer would be. Any number that appears here, we already know the answer.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:58.180
We don't have to do it again. What's the first number that doesn't appear here? I think it's six.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.620
Shall we try six? [Brady, off camera: Let's do it!]. Let's do it.

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:09.920
okay, 6. And 6 goes, well, it's even. Goes to 3. 3 goes to 10. And we got 10. Whoops, there's 10

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.220
So, I should just draw the 3 going down to 10 instead.

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:20.020
And now I know, I'm beginning to build up my tree. And now I've tried now all the numbers up through seven.

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:27.220
Uh, 8 I got. 9 I thought I had somewhere. Didn't I have a nine? [Brady: I can't see a nine].

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.120
No, I don't see a nine. Let's try nine. So, nine.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:40.440
ok. Odd number. three times nine plus one: 28. 28, 14... whoops, seven. Where's my seven? There it is.

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.760
Goes to seven. So I can begin doing this and build up my tree.

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.820
I don't have to go all the way each time. I know what's going to happen after I get to seven.

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:54.620
If you look at the cover of this book that I showed you first, that's a tree of just this kind.

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.080
But people have built up HUGE trees of this kind.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:03.180
And there's a wonderful article on Wikipedia which you can look at which shows some of the pictures of this.

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.800
[Brady: there. there does seem to be a very striking feature of it, and this is this line down the middle here].

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.740
Yes, that's right. This is like the third rail.

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.920
Once you touch that line, you fall right away to 1.

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:17.180
By the way, there's another name for the this problem, which is the Hailstone problem.

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:22.500
And the reason is, as you probably know, when hailstones form in the clouds,

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.920
the way they form, the way they get bigger, is that they start low and they

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:30.600
get blown up by the winds, and they get some ice on them. And they fall down a bit,

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.560
and then they go up and down. They go up and down many times.

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.460
and finally they fall to Earth. If they never get to Earth, then of course they're not hailstones.

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:39.780
And it's just like numbers here.

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:45.600
They go seemingly randomly up and down and up and down and then eventually they seem to fall to one.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.180
To the ground. What kind of things have people done with this funny funny problem?

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.580
Well, they've compiled, for instance, records

00:05:53.580 --> 00:06:00.500
I, I got a long string with seven. What's the next number after seven which gives a longer string?

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:04.900
well, it's not 8. 8 is down here. we found it already, it's 9.

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:10.180
Nine only goes through seven. What's the next number after that? Well, you can look on the

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.200
online encyclopedia of integer sequences,

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.840
that great resource

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.360
and you'll find a table of the record holding numbers.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:23.700
You'll also find a table of the numbers that hold the record for the longest time to get to one.

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:26.460
Let's get a couple of examples here. There's some wonderful ones.

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:30.820
For instance, the longest , the one, the record holder, for the numbers under a hundred million,

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:39.400
people, people know all these things,  is 63,728,127.

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:43.100
and that takes nine hundred and forty nine steps to get to one.

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:47.520
I bet the person who found it thought maybe (s)he was on to something

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:50.100
Maybe finally had a counter example. But no.

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:55.980
There are records and records and records. And people have tabulated this looking for patterns

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:59.320
that might help them understand  what's really going on.

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:03.340
So the randomness of this is what seems to make it hard.

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:10.320
The fact that you don't see a pattern and that no matter how hard you look, the patterns you see tend to be

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:15.560
illusory somehow. They, they melt away when you look further, or you don't understand them.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:22.120
Like the pattern of always going to one. That one holds sure, but we don't understand why it's there.

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:25.980
[Brady: If you'd like to see even more of this interview about the Collatz Conjecture,

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:30.360
I've posted it at Numberphile2].  Why 3n+1? Why not
 3n-1?

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:33.900
Brady, let's try a 3n-1..

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:37.580
[Brady: in case you don't know, Professor Eisenbud is the director at MSRI

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:40.520
which is a huge supporter of Numberphile]

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:44.880
[Brady: You can see more videos with Professor Eisenbud or other videos filmed at MSRI

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:48.780
by clicking the links on the screen or in the video description]

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:51.880
You draw that line, and then draw this line..
