00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.862
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.610
SPEAKER 1: I'm very
pleased to welcome you all,

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.040
and to welcome a
very esteemed author.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.630
Not just an author,
but someone I

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.570
consider a genuine friend here.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.000
Ryan Williams.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.260
He and I went to
university together.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.090
And he has a very
esteemed background

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.854
that I think a lot of you are
familiar with and have seen.

00:00:25.854 --> 00:00:27.270
And I'd appreciate
it if you'd all

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.172
give him a round of applause
to welcome Ryan to the stage.

00:00:30.172 --> 00:00:32.532
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:32.532 --> 00:00:35.301
RYAN WILLIAMS: Thank you.

00:00:35.301 --> 00:00:36.300
Thank you everyone here.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.210
It's a pleasure to be up
in Mountain View at Google.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.960
So I'd like to start
off by giving you all

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.490
self a round of applause
for coming out today

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:45.960
and spending some time to
talk about influencers.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.751
So get up for yourselves.

00:00:47.751 --> 00:00:51.120
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.210
So this book is called
"The Influencer Economy."

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.320
It's about how to launch your
idea, share it with the world,

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.690
and thrive in the digital age.

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.790
So today we'll be
thinking about how

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.675
we can influence others
to collaborate, to share

00:01:05.675 --> 00:01:09.920
our ideas, to help build
products people love,

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.140
because ultimately
when you collaborate

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.630
with your community,
your customers,

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.885
and influential leaders in your
field, you become an influencer

00:01:18.885 --> 00:01:19.385
yourself.

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.130
So this all started for me
when I was 22 years old.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.870
I'm a former clinically
depressed person.

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:37.010
And I say this because I was
22, living in Washington DC.

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.770
And you can only imagine what
my apartment looked like.

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.070
I had beer bottles and soda
cans strewn across the floor.

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.780
My bed was never made
for weeks at a time.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.710
I had dishes all over the
kitchen that were stacked up

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.120
like you couldn't believe.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.800
I struggled to breathe.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.770
And I went to my day
job as my main outlet.

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.830
In order to get over the
hump of being depressed,

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.550
I did what any rational
person would do.

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.200
I became a stand-up comedian,
because why wouldn't you

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.250
want to be a clinically
depressed stand-up comedian

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.380
where your main goal is to make
strangers laugh at comedy clubs

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.940
with their arms folded,
drunk off flat beer,

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.440
eating greasy chicken wings.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.760
Imagine this scenario with
the smoky bars in Baltimore,

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.540
Washington DC, where your main
goal is to make them laugh.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.700
How do you think it went?

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.850
If you find out a way for it
to go well, please let me know.

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.906
My parents, my therapists,
and my now wife

00:02:36.906 --> 00:02:38.530
who was then my
girlfriend at the time,

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.069
they were curious themselves.

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:41.860
What I learned a lot
about through stand-up

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.370
was putting yourself out there
and dealing with rejection

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.860
is what makes the
experience unique.

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.690
And I ultimately
pivoted my career.

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.240
I listened to the
market that told me--

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.120
again, I'll let you be the
decider if I was funny or not.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.340
But I ultimately
listened to the market.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.130
And I was a marketing
pro at stand-up.

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.180
And I could fill amphitheaters
and comedy venues and dive bars

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.560
all over DC.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.340
And I Comedy Central comedians
call me up, texting me, saying,

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.510
I headline at my show
and five people come.

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.370
But you can get 250.

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:16.720
What's your secret?

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.250
And that's when I
realized I could

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.890
pivot my career into marketing.

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.880
And my aspirations
of being an artist

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.330
were going to be put
on hold temporarily.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.347
So I left the comedy world
and I moved to Los Angeles.

00:03:28.347 --> 00:03:29.930
And I worked at a
couple of companies.

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.820
I helped raise venture
capital and run marketing.

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:38.430
And as Googlers, who here is
familiar with machinima.com?

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.710
We are a multichannel network,
for those that don't know.

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:43.350
I see a lot of
people are familiar.

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.570
We're a gaming
network on YouTube.

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:49.350
So think about ESPN for gamers,
where the sports instead

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.140
of being football, or soccer,
they are Call of Duty,

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.540
they are Minecraft.

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.930
And who here has played
the game Minecraft?

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.860
Better question-- whose kids or
cousins have played Minecraft?

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:02.360
OK.

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.600
More hands have showed up,
because ultimately, Minecraft

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.690
was a game that we helped launch
at Machinima with no budget.

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.230
And I realized that our sales
team was functioning really

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:12.920
well.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.420
But we had no marketing.

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:15.110
So we're young.

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:16.162
We're energetic.

00:04:16.162 --> 00:04:17.570
We needed marketing collateral.

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.970
We launched our social
media and our branding.

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:21.560
And we had a hungry team.

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.310
And we were building
this amazing product.

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.910
You all, the majority of the
room are technologists here.

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.951
So you know the power of
building a tech solution

00:04:27.951 --> 00:04:29.210
and how exciting it is.

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.340
So we were acquired
by Warner Brothers

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.260
a couple of months
ago for $100 million.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.010
And ultimately, Machinima was
one of the pioneering groups

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.830
I've ever seen to galvanize
a community because we

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.440
built our products
with the community.

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.034
Our alpha, our beta, our launch.

00:04:45.034 --> 00:04:46.700
And our customers--
like with Minecraft,

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:51.530
which sold for $2.5
billion to Microsoft--

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:52.250
they built it.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.041
And we helped them,
because we let everyone

00:04:54.041 --> 00:04:55.550
into the creative process.

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:57.980
So I was fascinated
by influence, right.

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:59.750
And the word
"influencer" has been

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:04.640
hijacked-- it's been hijacked
by a bunch of no-talent zeros.

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.890
Just because you get a
bunch of likes on Instagram

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:10.340
because you're sexy, or these
jeans make you look sexy,

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:11.480
it doesn't matter.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:12.140
Right?

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.600
Influencers does
not equal followers.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.570
Influencers do not
equal impressions.

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:20.810
Influence is something where
you want to make a dent in life.

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:22.160
You want to be known.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.150
And if we look back in 20
years, Google will exist.

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.730
I mean, it's up to you all
to keep it in business.

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:30.470
But Google will
exist in 20 years.

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:33.350
And we will Google peoples'
names for influence.

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:35.900
And we're not going to find
some Instagram celebrity.

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.540
We're not going to find
someone who looks hot in jeans

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.570
and was paid $25,000 to
tweet about a product.

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:44.740
That is not what
an influencer is.

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.020
So an influencer,
to me, is "someone

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.360
who can create a movement
around their idea

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.080
through collaboration, community
passion, and a shared vision."

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.960
It's something connective,
because ultimately,

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.320
collaboration is where
influence is derived.

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.600
And influencers can
change a small idea

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:05.530
into a world-changing
one seemingly overnight,

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:08.470
because something small could
become big because influencers

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:10.300
can endorse these ideas.

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.970
And also, influence is
gained through collaboration,

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:14.500
often in a niche community.

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.980
Like we did at Machinima,
we'll be Minecraft gamers

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:19.450
in a very specific game.

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:20.500
We made videos around it.

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.030
We built that community.

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:26.470
And finally, influence has
nothing to do with impressions,

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:28.360
has nothing to do
with followers,

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.090
and it has nothing to do
with any vanity metric.

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:33.580
Vanity metrics are
not real word metrics.

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:37.240
And how I know this is
because I did some research

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:38.880
because I live in LA.

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:42.010
And everyone there is
obsessed with celebrity.

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:44.560
And Kim Kardashian
and Ryan Seacrest

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.540
are your textbook celebrities.

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.340
So I went into their data.

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:51.370
And what I found was our
Machinima influencers

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:52.690
could move the needle.

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:54.820
We had hundreds of thousands
of YouTube subscribers

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:55.570
on these channels.

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:59.750
Anyone here watch
the Machinima video?

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:02.170
It's a bunch of game play,
oftentimes people narrating

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:03.470
over Minecraft.

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:06.070
And so imagine instead of
watching a football game

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:08.440
with the announcers, that
someone's playing Minecraft

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:10.390
and telling funny
stories about their life.

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:11.440
They're called vlogs.

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:11.940
Right.

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:12.510
Video logs.

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:13.784
They're really big in YouTube.

00:07:13.784 --> 00:07:15.700
So these gamers that had
hundreds of thousands

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:19.180
of subscribers would make
videos playing Minecraft,

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:22.810
just educating people about the
world that was in Minecraft.

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:25.000
And in aggregate,
these influencers

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.090
with less celebrity
followers like these mascots

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:32.150
up here, they were influencers
because in their communities

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:35.750
in clusters of five to 10, these
influencers moved the needle.

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:38.960
And I think people like
Seacrest, people like Kim

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.680
Kardashian, they add value.

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:42.530
They drive traffic.

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:43.980
People watch their TV shows.

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:46.020
They're cultural taste makers.

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:49.190
But they are not true
social media influencers,

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:51.816
because again, the
word has been hijacked.

00:07:51.816 --> 00:07:54.440
And they aren't no-talent zeros
like a lot of these influencers

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:56.480
are on Instagram, because
they do add value.

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:57.980
But ultimately I
want to show you

00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:01.190
the data around why they're
not influential online.

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:04.580
So this is a slide
literally I made years ago

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:06.320
when I was working
doing research

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.840
on celebrity investments
and startups,

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:10.876
and how they move the
needle, because again,

00:08:10.876 --> 00:08:12.500
every Silicon Valley
product, they want

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:14.030
to connect with a celebrity.

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:15.527
And they say, I
want to get someone

00:08:15.527 --> 00:08:16.610
to tweet about my product.

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:18.260
It will be an overnight success.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:19.760
And that is wrong.

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:21.200
Celebrities don't
move the needle

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:24.800
as much as very targeted,
specific niche influencers.

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.450
So this is Kim.

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:28.700
When she had a tweet, again,
I ripped this directly

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:32.000
from a deck I made years ago.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.090
Anyone here familiar with Bitly,
the data tracking software

00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:36.650
you can use to share links?

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:38.809
So she shared an
episode of "Keeping up

00:08:38.809 --> 00:08:41.659
with the Kardashians"
to preview an episode.

00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:45.811
And she got around
83,000 clicks on Twitter.

00:08:45.811 --> 00:08:46.310
Right?

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:48.720
She has 18 million followers.

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:52.490
So that conversion is less
than a banner ad would be.

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:53.600
Banner ads are terrible.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.910
Like who hear clicks on
banner ads on purpose?

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:58.814
Oftentimes I get mad, because
I actually click on it,

00:08:58.814 --> 00:08:59.480
and I'm go back!

00:08:59.480 --> 00:08:59.979
Go back!

00:08:59.979 --> 00:09:00.830
Go back!

00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:05.180
So ultimately, the influencers
are very niche and targeted.

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:07.100
And Kim is super broad.

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:12.070
So here you can see that she's
around 0.46 of a percent.

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:14.840
Banner ads on average are
around half of a percent.

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:17.600
So you may as well go spend a
bunch of money on banner ads

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:20.720
if you can spend a bunch of cash
to get Kim Kardashian to tweet

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:24.200
about your product, or
your club opening in Vegas,

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:25.790
or anything relevant
to her community,

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:27.710
because she has a
broad celebrity.

00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:28.910
She's a mascot.

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:31.160
And what's equally
fascinating about this data

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:33.130
is you notice the decay up here.

00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:37.280
In the first 48 hours is where
the bulk of her traffic comes.

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:39.050
So nothing is being recycled.

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:41.720
Nothing is being circulated
amongst other influencer

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:43.550
communities to
keep this thriving.

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:45.050
Unlike the Minecraft
videos, which

00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:47.390
are more timeless,
more evergreen,

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:50.570
and more personality-driven.

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:54.110
So all this fascination after I
left Machinima and I love what

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:56.760
we were doing-- those big ideas
we built the marketing team--

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:58.760
I went on to some other
startups and helped them

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:00.920
raise capital and do marketing.

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:06.080
But ultimately, I believe that
the world is so fascinating

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:09.530
right now, because you can
make a dent in doing something

00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:11.810
that you can leave
influence around.

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:14.260
And then ultimately
there's a bartering

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.280
and there is an
exchange of ideas.

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:19.100
And we truly have
navigated a new economy.

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:21.830
So I wrote this book
to help us learn

00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:24.180
how to operate in
this new economy,

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:25.640
and helping to teach others--

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:27.890
because learning is
really the fundamental

00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:29.540
of how we exchange ideas.

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:32.570
And oftentimes giving
value is what matters.

00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:35.480
And that's how we
navigate this new world.

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:36.640
So Seth Godin.

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:39.970
He's a fellow speaker at Google.

00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:41.620
I interviewed over
100 influencers

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:44.800
for my podcast, which is called
"Stories from the Influencer

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:46.870
Economy," because I
wanted to build up

00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:50.080
an idea and a platform
ahead of my book launch.

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:51.810
So I talked to Adam Grant--

00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:52.940
anyone see his talk here?

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:53.981
It's a really good talk--

00:10:53.981 --> 00:10:56.710
Dorie Clark, and many other
influential business writers.

00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:58.450
And I took their application.

00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:02.350
And I applied their old
knowledge with new influencers

00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:04.160
in the social media space.

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.400
So Seth, why we'll
be talking about

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:09.100
him is because
he's an influencer.

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:12.760
He'll be around in 20 years
when you Google his name.

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:14.890
So he talks about
a tribe, and how

00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:17.740
a tribe is a group of people
connected to one another,

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:20.572
connected to a leader,
connected to an idea.

00:11:20.572 --> 00:11:22.030
For millions of
years, human beings

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:23.890
have been part of
one tribe or another.

00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:26.130
A group needs only two
things to be a tribe.

00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:29.320
A shared interest, and
a way to communicate.

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:32.110
Your company at Google
is led by tribes.

00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:34.990
Everyone who has different
teams from research to tech,

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:36.400
you have a tribe leader.

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:38.530
And you are interested
in connecting.

00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:40.270
And that's ultimately
what happens

00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:44.230
with storytelling and sharing of
ideas and why someone like Seth

00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:46.480
is an influencer.

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:50.330
So these are the chapters of
the book, which you all got,

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:51.650
in emoji.

00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:53.670
I researched his book years ago.

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:56.060
I did this slide to
connect with millennials,

00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:58.460
because my parents
didn't use emoji.

00:11:58.460 --> 00:11:59.930
But now my parents use emoji.

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:01.910
So this slide is
really for everyone.

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:04.790
But ultimately, the emoji
chapters of the book

00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:07.640
are how you craft
your big vision.

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:11.939
Every influencer I talk to
has a big vision, a big idea,

00:12:11.939 --> 00:12:12.980
to sell you on something.

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:15.770
Like Sergei and Larry years
ago, they had this big vision

00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:16.940
to solve a problem.

00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:19.250
Because you need buy-in from
people to believe in what

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:20.480
you're doing.

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:22.790
Secondly is you pick a platform.

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:24.217
I picked the
suitcase emoji here,

00:12:24.217 --> 00:12:26.300
because you've got to pick
somewhere you're going.

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:27.365
And you need a channel.

00:12:27.365 --> 00:12:29.240
So it's no longer, oh,
I want to go to coffee

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:30.140
and pick your brain.

00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:30.680
Right?

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:31.940
Those people drive me nuts.

00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:32.740
I don't know.

00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:35.150
Sorry if anyone here does that.

00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:37.040
Sorry, not sorry, actually.

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:39.940
Because ultimately, you want
to collaborate with someone.

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:40.910
And you pick a channel.

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:43.160
It could be building an alpha
version of your product.

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:44.701
It could be you make
YouTube content.

00:12:44.701 --> 00:12:46.220
For me, it was podcasting.

00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:48.860
And ultimately, we were
building these relationships

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:52.430
because that's what is currency
in the influencer economy.

00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:55.371
The next thing is a
book your own gigs.

00:12:55.371 --> 00:12:57.620
You have to deal with
rejection, like Jay-Z. Actually,

00:12:57.620 --> 00:12:59.480
this is the only
emoji that I invented.

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:01.310
I thought Jay-Z
would need an emoji.

00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:02.540
I mean, who doesn't?

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:04.940
If anyone earned an
emoji, it's Jay-Z.

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:06.980
So you got to deal
with rejection.

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:08.420
You have to build relationships.

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:09.711
And you have to accept failure.

00:13:09.711 --> 00:13:11.330
And you have to do every job.

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:13.190
And I grew up in
Des Moines, Iowa.

00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:15.290
And it's known for corn farming.

00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:17.660
And I like to say,
never build in a silo.

00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:19.790
Never build by yourself.

00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:23.210
I mean, this company was founded
in a garage in Silicon Valley

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:24.410
and Stanford.

00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:26.426
But that stereotype is over.

00:13:26.426 --> 00:13:27.800
People need to
build with others.

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:28.790
You have to share.

00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:31.100
Because you need psychological
and behavioral buy-in

00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:33.710
from people to help make
your idea better, and then

00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:35.600
moreover help spreading it.

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:39.020
The next is adopt
technology early and often.

00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:41.270
Influencers are always
curious around technology.

00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:43.210
They need to find
tech as a solution.

00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:44.930
And they can't be tech phobics.

00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:47.460
The next one is striving
for authenticity.

00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:50.210
And authenticity is a
word that's overused.

00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:52.130
I love the word and
I hate the word.

00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:55.570
Who here likes the
word "authentic"?

00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:57.091
Who here doesn't like the word?

00:13:57.091 --> 00:13:57.590
Right.

00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:59.210
So it's a very branded word.

00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:00.800
It's like influencer, right?

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:03.410
It's been hijacked by a
bunch of no-talent zeros.

00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:05.510
So we're taking
it back right now,

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:08.540
because authenticity really
means having a strong message

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:11.750
and being comfortable in your
own skin, and being affable,

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:14.480
being likable because
you are who you are.

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:16.520
And ultimately we have flaws.

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:19.490
And we have characteristics
that we can't always execute on.

00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:22.100
I wish I could say that
every word coming out today

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:23.510
will be perfect.

00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:26.510
But the more likely I am to
admit that I'm not perfect,

00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:28.700
the more likely
I'll be authentic.

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:31.481
And you only know
authenticity when you see it.

00:14:31.481 --> 00:14:33.980
And then we have collaboration,
which we'll talk about a lot

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:34.640
today.

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:35.870
The fist bump.

00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:37.204
Capturing lightning in a bottle.

00:14:37.204 --> 00:14:39.578
That's something that you know
like, when you double down

00:14:39.578 --> 00:14:41.144
or you need to pivot
with your idea,

00:14:41.144 --> 00:14:42.560
because you have
that moment where

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:44.504
you know what your
customers are telling you,

00:14:44.504 --> 00:14:46.670
that they either love it
or they want you to go back

00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:47.985
to the drawing board.

00:14:47.985 --> 00:14:50.360
And then ultimately, you got
to meet people in real life.

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:51.764
You can't rely on the internet.

00:14:51.764 --> 00:14:53.180
You people live
streaming at home,

00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:54.890
hopefully I'll get to
meet you in person.

00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:57.380
But ultimately, you can't
sit back and passively

00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:58.970
watch things on a laptop.

00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:00.500
Influencers and
influential people

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:02.180
go out and meet
people in real life.

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:03.680
And finally, you
have to be a giver.

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:05.780
You have to open doors
for other people.

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:08.150
And then you have to give
people ownership of your idea.

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:11.230
You have to let them buy
in and celebrate with you,

00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:12.730
your wins and your losses.

00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:15.290
Because I have a
metaphor with Benihana.

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:17.600
Who here has been to Benihana?

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:19.760
You know how they cook
the food in front of you?

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:21.830
They let you into
the creative process.

00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:24.170
And you get to see the
chef and they do tricks.

00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:25.712
And you see what
you're about to eat.

00:15:25.712 --> 00:15:27.920
And there's something
psychologically fun about that.

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:29.330
You get to meet
people at a table

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:30.400
that you don't ordinarily know.

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:31.983
I used to celebrate
my birthdays there

00:15:31.983 --> 00:15:35.040
when I was younger, growing
up in Des Moines, Iowa.

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:37.370
And we loved it because
you'd celebrate with others.

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:39.140
So you have to figure
out a way to cook

00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:41.060
with the community
and your customers

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:43.370
to get them to buy in.

00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:46.640
So these are the three types
of collaboration styles.

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:48.050
And there's the collaborators.

00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:51.770
This is roughly 10% of your
customer and community base.

00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:54.910
These folks are the techies,
what I call the regulars.

00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:56.540
They're the ones
you build the alpha,

00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:59.120
and they're going to show
up like they would at a bar,

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:01.560
drinking with their friends
every Friday at happy hour.

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:02.860
They're the happy hour crew.

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:03.440
Right?

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:05.023
The regulars, they're
the one, they're

00:16:05.023 --> 00:16:06.860
going to buy it when
you pilot your program

00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:08.420
and give it out at a discount.

00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:10.190
Because you need to
build these people

00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:11.630
as your proof of concept.

00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:13.670
And ultimately, they
become early adopters.

00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:15.650
They become your
brand ambassadors.

00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:19.110
And for me with my book,
getting it out to my friends,

00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:21.800
my family, my email list,
psychologically a lot of people

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:24.430
wanted to help me because they
were part of the process early.

00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:25.930
And so these are
your collaborators.

00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:26.638
They validate it.

00:16:26.638 --> 00:16:27.980
Because people make mistakes.

00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:30.366
And they want to go
to influencers early.

00:16:30.366 --> 00:16:31.490
And they pitch influencers.

00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:33.070
And they fall on their face.

00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:34.910
Because influencers
are the next group.

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:36.660
But you have to build
the proof of concept

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:39.170
out before you get the
key stakeholders involved.

00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:41.086
I use the word "key
stakeholder" because we're

00:16:41.086 --> 00:16:42.670
at a corporate company, right?

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:45.590
Isn't key stakeholder like,
the most corporate word ever?

00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:47.470
Like, I talk in front
of tech entrepreneurs.

00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:48.720
And I never mention that word.

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:50.690
So you at home,
just let you know,

00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:54.140
I'm giving it to you as a
very corporate branding here,

00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:57.620
because ultimately, I think
that the influencers are the one

00:16:57.620 --> 00:17:01.700
percenters that you have to have
something to offer before they

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:02.655
want to work with you.

00:17:02.655 --> 00:17:04.280
And you don't want
to burn that bridge,

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:06.770
because ultimately, they
are the industry leaders.

00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:08.240
They are the authorities.

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:10.075
They are the one to
give you social proof.

00:17:10.075 --> 00:17:11.450
And they're your
lead generators.

00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:13.550
If you find the right
influencer to collaborate

00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:15.710
with-- and again, don't
ask them just for coffee.

00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:18.589
Ask them to review your
alpha to get feedback

00:17:18.589 --> 00:17:19.780
to make your product better.

00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:22.280
You don't want to ask them to
tweet about it, because that's

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:23.329
unbecoming.

00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:25.500
And you also don't want
to ask them for a favor.

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:26.359
You don't want to
have someone feel

00:17:26.359 --> 00:17:27.525
like they owe you something.

00:17:27.525 --> 00:17:30.530
Like psychologically,
influence comes from a win-win,

00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:33.230
from a mutual you
help me, I help you.

00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:34.730
And we'll talk more
about this later

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:37.830
about giving as a big
philosophy for influence.

00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:41.540
And the final step here
is the mass marketers.

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:44.540
People don't care,
often if influencers

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:45.830
endorse your product.

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:47.210
When someone buys
a Nest product,

00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:48.650
they just care that it works.

00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:50.320
They don't care that you had
an ambassador program, that you

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:52.403
had early adopters, that
you had a bunch of people

00:17:52.403 --> 00:17:54.830
that gave you feedback,
and you got into Best Buy.

00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:56.510
They just want it at Best Buy.

00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:58.640
And so ultimately, the
consumers, the buyers,

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:02.150
the mass market, they're
about 90% of the groups.

00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:04.215
So you want to build
something for them.

00:18:04.215 --> 00:18:05.090
And it's fully baked.

00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:07.090
And they're going to buy
it because it's already

00:18:07.090 --> 00:18:08.420
established.

00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:11.970
So getting into a couple of key
principles here of the book.

00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:14.090
This is the platform rule.

00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:16.640
My father-in-law
is named Joe Moore.

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:19.060
Who here is married?

00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:23.440
Of you, you know what
father-in-laws are all about.

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:24.880
Sometimes you love them.

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:27.130
Sometimes whatever the
opposite of love is,

00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:28.390
that's how you feel.

00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:31.539
So my father-in-law, he has no
idea what I do in California.

00:18:31.539 --> 00:18:33.580
He says how are these
startups valued at hundreds

00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:35.600
of millions of dollars?

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:39.434
What do you do to add
that value to the company?

00:18:39.434 --> 00:18:40.600
Where's the money coming in?

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:42.430
Because he runs a
boiler repair company

00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:43.930
in Raleigh, North Carolina.

00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:45.970
So I talked to him
about influence.

00:18:45.970 --> 00:18:47.770
And he was really
curious about my book

00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:48.770
and what I'm working on.

00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:52.000
And I said, how do you
define the word "influence"?

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.200
And he said, look.

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:54.850
"You have to give
people something

00:18:54.850 --> 00:18:57.700
they can't get anywhere
else in quite the same way."

00:18:57.700 --> 00:18:59.440
And you have to
solve a pain point.

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:01.720
And he gave me an
example of sales.

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:04.000
So he has people calling
him up through the Southeast

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.830
for boiler problems.

00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:07.900
He gives them free
advice for a half hour,

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:09.490
gives them just
enough information

00:19:09.490 --> 00:19:11.802
that they're dangerous, and
then not enough information

00:19:11.802 --> 00:19:13.510
that they can execute
on it, because they

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:15.120
don't have the resources.

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:16.870
So he says the problem
with so many people

00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:18.730
is they don't know
how to solve problems.

00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:20.470
And ultimately,
that's what happens

00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:23.500
when you want to gain influence,
and you're not helping people,

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:25.360
you're not solving
a market demand.

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:27.580
Ultimately you have to
develop a knowledge or skill

00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:29.050
that most people don't have.

00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:30.384
And then you share it with them.

00:19:30.384 --> 00:19:31.841
And you build that
proof of concept

00:19:31.841 --> 00:19:33.100
that with your collaborators.

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:34.937
And then ultimately,
customers come

00:19:34.937 --> 00:19:36.770
because you've built
something that you know

00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:39.280
there's a massive demand for.

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:43.030
Anyone that works in YouTube
know who Hannah Hart is?

00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:44.920
She's a wonderful human being.

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:48.160
She has a series called
"My Drunk Kitchen."

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:50.980
And guess what it's about?

00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:53.410
Her drinking wine and
getting tipsy and making food

00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:54.610
with her friends.

00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:56.230
She's a massive success.

00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:57.520
She turned it into a TV show.

00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:59.841
She has a bestselling book
called "My Drunk Kitchen."

00:19:59.841 --> 00:20:01.840
And she's done an amazing
job branding her idea.

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:03.917
But she is an endearing person.

00:20:03.917 --> 00:20:05.500
And she did a Hello,
Harto tour, which

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:07.129
is a crowdfunding campaign.

00:20:07.129 --> 00:20:08.920
And ultimately with
her, she shared with me

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:12.430
that you give now, and
people will pay later.

00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:13.930
And you have to
hear their problems.

00:20:13.930 --> 00:20:16.450
So she went out and she
galvanized her base,

00:20:16.450 --> 00:20:18.310
because she knew
they wanted a tour.

00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:22.660
She went around the
country in an RV.

00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:25.270
And people who crowdfunded her
project at a certain threshold

00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:27.010
were entered into a lottery.

00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:29.770
And she went to your
house and drunk cooked,

00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:31.610
and then made content around it.

00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:34.180
So you're collaborating
in her videos.

00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:36.100
Who here knows what
the term collab

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:38.485
means in the YouTube ecosystem?

00:20:38.485 --> 00:20:39.485
It's not that technical.

00:20:39.485 --> 00:20:40.790
It means what you think.

00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:45.230
But collabing in YouTube is
when someone has a video series.

00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:50.344
And let's say Peyton has a video
series about building a home

00:20:50.344 --> 00:20:52.010
security system, cause
he works at Nest.

00:20:52.010 --> 00:20:53.850
He's super into this category.

00:20:53.850 --> 00:20:56.210
And let's say he has
100,000 YouTube subscribers.

00:20:56.210 --> 00:20:57.260
Really compelling.

00:20:57.260 --> 00:20:58.460
Super compelling guy.

00:20:58.460 --> 00:20:59.200
Right?

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:01.340
100,000 subscribers
is no small feat.

00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:03.590
Let's say the gentleman right
here in the green shirt,

00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:07.430
let's say you have a
business vlog-- a video log--

00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:10.790
where you talk about
CES mainstream products.

00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:14.800
And let's say, what's a name
for your channel if you had one?

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:16.545
What's an interest of yours?

00:21:16.545 --> 00:21:17.170
AUDIENCE: Food.

00:21:17.277 --> 00:21:18.110
RYAN WILLIAMS: Food?

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:19.240
What?

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:19.740
Food.

00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:23.240
So let's call it
Nerd Food Tech Zone.

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:25.130
And you have a million
subscribers, right?

00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:27.500
And Peyton with his
channel has 100,000.

00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:28.880
So you do a collab.

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:32.480
You appear in his niche
channel, do a video together.

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:36.545
You appear in Nerd
Food Blog Tech.

00:21:36.545 --> 00:21:37.910
Is that what we called it?

00:21:37.910 --> 00:21:40.010
Yeah.

00:21:40.010 --> 00:21:42.050
And so you have a
massive channel.

00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:42.890
So you collaborate.

00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:43.820
There's no money exchanged.

00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:45.170
Again, it's a bartering system.

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:47.960
You want to help make his
channel better and get him

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:49.160
new subscribers.

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:52.910
But then equally you know
that he's very niche,

00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:55.430
and you can appear in his
videos and be in a super target

00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:56.280
segment.

00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:57.410
So you share audience.

00:21:57.410 --> 00:22:00.230
And that bartering,
that collab, is really

00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:02.300
where influence thrives.

00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:03.911
I get back to the
win-win of it all.

00:22:03.911 --> 00:22:05.660
You have to find a
mutually beneficial way

00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:06.785
to collaborate with people.

00:22:06.785 --> 00:22:07.880
It could be through money.

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:09.110
It could be through equity.

00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:10.550
Or it could be through goodwill.

00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:12.675
But that's what I learned
from all these YouTubers.

00:22:12.675 --> 00:22:13.400
Years

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:14.077
And Brad Feld.

00:22:14.077 --> 00:22:15.160
Anyone familiar with Brad?

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:16.730
He started Techstars.

00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:19.980
It's a big startup accelerator
in Boulder, Colorado.

00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:23.240
And they essentially
give $25,000 to $50,000

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:26.930
to early stage companies to help
them accelerate their ideas.

00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:30.590
And Brad, he talks about how
you need to pilot your ideas.

00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:34.580
And piloting your idea comes
down to testing something

00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:37.010
where the barrier
to entry is low.

00:22:37.010 --> 00:22:41.150
So Brad started blogging at
feld.com I would say back

00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:42.110
in '05.

00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:42.730
Right.

00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:46.010
So now he's one of the
early adopter tech bloggers.

00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:48.680
And his advice to me was, don't
always have a defined goal.

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:51.452
Sometimes start something
for curiosity's sake.

00:22:51.452 --> 00:22:53.660
So he started Techstars,
which is a massive incubator

00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:55.040
and accelerator.

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:57.985
He started it because he
could make new friends.

00:22:57.985 --> 00:23:00.110
Or he could turn it into
a billion dollar business.

00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:02.579
But most likely, it was going
to be somewhere in between.

00:23:02.579 --> 00:23:03.620
So he's made new friends.

00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:06.140
And they've invested in
thousands of startups.

00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:08.270
And he's been there for
the early stage growth.

00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:10.850
He's become a mentor in
the startup community.

00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:12.894
He even talks about
topics like depression.

00:23:12.894 --> 00:23:14.810
Like he came on my podcast
recently and talked

00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:17.630
about OCD and depression,
because he wants to help

00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:18.950
build communities.

00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:20.920
And ultimately,
piloting your ideas

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:22.460
is something where
you can workshop

00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:23.990
when the stakes are low.

00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:26.390
Because if Nest
breaks down, people

00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:29.120
get mad, because they paid a
lot of money for their product.

00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:31.880
But if you're piloting something
with the barrier of entry low,

00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:34.609
and you have no customers,
no one's using it,

00:23:34.609 --> 00:23:36.650
you can make those mistakes
when no one's looking

00:23:36.650 --> 00:23:39.950
and the bright
lights aren't on you.

00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:41.720
So these guys are
the Vlog Brothers.

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:44.420
Has anyone seen
their work before?

00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:47.559
The Vlog brothers
are these guys,

00:23:47.559 --> 00:23:49.100
essentially they
started a conference

00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:50.660
called VidCon, which
is a big YouTube

00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:52.190
conference down in Anaheim.

00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:53.789
And they started very small.

00:23:53.789 --> 00:23:55.580
And their channel called
the Vlog Brothers,

00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:58.110
they do science fiction,
or science videos.

00:23:58.110 --> 00:24:00.860
And they did one
video blog a day

00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:03.420
to each other for
an entire year.

00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:04.670
So they did 365 videos.

00:24:04.670 --> 00:24:05.630
And that's how they got started.

00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:06.130
Right.

00:24:06.130 --> 00:24:07.220
They started small.

00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:09.380
So with influence,
it's like naming

00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:12.080
your community is a
massive opportunity,

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:14.540
because they called their
community Nerd Fighters.

00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:17.260
And you notice they have
the Spock fingers up here

00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:20.660
on their thumbnail, because
naming and identifying

00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:22.290
your community--
like you're Googlers.

00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:22.790
Right?

00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:24.590
That's a community identifier.

00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:28.070
Having a community of people
that recognize themselves

00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:30.080
can help you
galvanize that base.

00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:32.474
And think about YouTubers.

00:24:32.474 --> 00:24:33.890
Like, YouTubers,
that's the people

00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:35.740
that make the YouTube
videos and have subscribers.

00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:37.160
Like, there's a
connotation there.

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:39.380
So identifying your
customers, naming them--

00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:42.660
even just internally-- helps
you galvanize that base.

00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:46.250
And when you have an idea
with the customer in mind,

00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:48.420
oftentimes there's two
ways to go about it.

00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:51.497
One is you find that big vision,
and then you take a platform.

00:24:51.497 --> 00:24:52.580
So for me, my big vision--

00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:54.950
I'm going to write this
influencer economy book.

00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:58.227
And I started my podcast to
connect with influencers,

00:24:58.227 --> 00:25:00.560
to connect with audiences,
because I'm a former stand-up

00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:03.270
and I love doing that,
and to help tell stories

00:25:03.270 --> 00:25:04.950
so people can learn.

00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:08.000
But sometimes influencers and
people that are influential,

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.830
they start small with a vlog.

00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:12.050
And that turns into
VidCon years later.

00:25:12.050 --> 00:25:14.120
And these guys are
brilliant branders.

00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:19.120
One of their catchphrases is
don't forget to be awesome.

00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:21.080
That's assuming you're
already awesome.

00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:22.875
And they're reminding
you not to forget it.

00:25:22.875 --> 00:25:24.250
So I think that's
a wonderful way

00:25:24.250 --> 00:25:27.430
to think about how to build
that relationship is you've got

00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:28.790
to brand your ideas creatively.

00:25:28.790 --> 00:25:32.290
And that's really where the
authenticity comes into play.

00:25:32.290 --> 00:25:37.190
So another YouTuber I love is
this guy named Freddy Wong.

00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:39.260
And it's funny, because
a lot of people,

00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:40.490
they don't know who he is.

00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:44.600
But if I ever have anyone under
the age of 16 in the crowd,

00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:46.080
they love this guy.

00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:48.650
He did a series called Video
Game High School, which

00:25:48.650 --> 00:25:51.920
is like a Harry Potter for video
games, where in the future--

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:53.060
you all have seen it?

00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:56.206
Like in the future, there
is gaming academies.

00:25:56.206 --> 00:25:57.830
And these professional
gaming academies

00:25:57.830 --> 00:25:59.449
are going to help
save the world.

00:25:59.449 --> 00:25:59.990
It's amazing.

00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:03.380
It's been viewed a
billion times online.

00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:07.760
And he's crowdfunded three
campaigns for $2 million.

00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:10.460
He was crowdfunding before
Spike Lee did it, you know,

00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:13.940
before Veronica Mars, and before
all these mainstream Zach Braff

00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:15.940
projects were on Kickstarter.

00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:19.290
And I love how he used
technology to his advantage.

00:26:19.290 --> 00:26:22.680
He figured out a way to leverage
tech and be an early adopter,

00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:24.590
amass YouTube subscribers
back when YouTube

00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:26.910
wasn't even monetizable.

00:26:26.910 --> 00:26:29.490
And he makes sci-fi
videos that people love.

00:26:29.490 --> 00:26:31.830
And his crowdfunding
campaign shattered records,

00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:35.144
because ultimately, Freddie
had these amazing perks.

00:26:35.144 --> 00:26:36.810
So I would take it
most people at Google

00:26:36.810 --> 00:26:40.030
have supported a
crowdfunding campaign.

00:26:40.030 --> 00:26:41.860
And I love crowdfunding
campaigns, right?

00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:44.040
Because they give you
updates continually.

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:46.480
And so Freddie's perks
define the accessibility

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:48.250
of people with influence.

00:26:48.250 --> 00:26:51.100
For $5,000 he had
a perk where you

00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:54.160
could go with the cast and
crew of Video Game High School

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:55.720
to Disney for the day.

00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:57.190
All you did do was
get to Anaheim.

00:26:57.190 --> 00:26:58.390
And then you would
spend the whole day

00:26:58.390 --> 00:27:00.400
on roller coaster rides
and Space Mountain

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:02.920
with Freddy and his buddies
that are in your favorite web

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:03.890
series.

00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:06.400
He had another one
for $3,500, I believe,

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:10.030
where he would deliver fried
dough to your front door

00:27:10.030 --> 00:27:12.177
anywhere in the country.

00:27:12.177 --> 00:27:14.510
Or the local equivalent, if
you didn't have fried dough.

00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:15.760
So glazed donuts.

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:21.760
And so luckily, he said that it
was a person in New Jersey who

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:22.487
bought that perk.

00:27:22.487 --> 00:27:23.320
So he's in New York.

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:24.980
And he ships it over for work.

00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:27.340
But ultimately, that
kind of cleverness,

00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:29.080
leveraging the technology.

00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:31.750
Can you imagine what would
Steven Spielberg even

00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:33.640
say to you if he
was on your door?

00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:35.477
Like, sorry, Steven,
if you're watching.

00:27:35.477 --> 00:27:37.060
But I mean, I ask
the broader question

00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:41.500
is, the celebrity is a
broad person with influence.

00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:43.690
But Freddy is on
your mobile device.

00:27:43.690 --> 00:27:44.860
He's on your laptop.

00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:46.540
He's on your iPad.

00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:50.020
He's someone that you have a
connected relationship with,

00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:51.460
because he's truly influential.

00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:52.900
And you're
collaborating with him.

00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:54.397
I think everyone needs to--

00:27:54.397 --> 00:27:56.230
if you haven't done a
crowdfunding campaign,

00:27:56.230 --> 00:27:58.830
and you're watching
this, just support one.

00:27:58.830 --> 00:28:01.210
Because those e-mails you
get, even when they are late

00:28:01.210 --> 00:28:03.640
and the project's overdue,
they're with love.

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:05.800
And you buy something
and you preorder it

00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:08.080
because you buy in and back it.

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:10.540
I think the backing
mentality is how marketers

00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:12.280
win in the new economy.

00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:14.890
You have to think of your
customers as backers,

00:28:14.890 --> 00:28:17.230
and let them drive
to a larger goal

00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:18.970
where you give them
a vision and say,

00:28:18.970 --> 00:28:20.410
I'm going to execute on this.

00:28:20.410 --> 00:28:23.770
I'll let you in on something
when I launched my book.

00:28:23.770 --> 00:28:25.990
I had an email list
and some friends

00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:28.170
that I sent the book
out to for free.

00:28:28.170 --> 00:28:30.550
And it's relevant, because
I used a Google doc.

00:28:30.550 --> 00:28:32.200
So I know my audience.

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:33.940
And I love Google Docs, right?

00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:34.960
So I sent it out.

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:37.720
And I said, if you give
me an edit for the book--

00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:41.440
and this was like months before
I was going to launch it--

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:44.290
if you give me any feedback,
if I use it or not,

00:28:44.290 --> 00:28:47.320
I'll give you an editor
title in my book.

00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:49.450
And I learned that from
crowdfunding campaigns,

00:28:49.450 --> 00:28:50.950
because I saw people
that were-- you

00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:53.200
could become an executive
producer for video series

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:56.110
and movies if you donated
a certain amount of money.

00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:58.870
And my wife said,
that's a terrible idea.

00:28:58.870 --> 00:29:00.970
Why would you give
your book out for free?

00:29:00.970 --> 00:29:03.400
And what I learned was,
it was the best idea

00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:05.980
I could have hatched,
because the people that

00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:08.060
left me the comments
made my book better.

00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:09.487
And I pivoted part of it.

00:29:09.487 --> 00:29:11.320
And it actually had
more actions and lessons

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:12.790
for people to learn from.

00:29:12.790 --> 00:29:16.030
Moreover, the first people
to buy my book at launch

00:29:16.030 --> 00:29:23.230
and leave reviews on book sites
were my first cred editors.

00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:24.612
And they all got in the book.

00:29:24.612 --> 00:29:26.320
So psychologically
they built it with me.

00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:29.380
I mean, I have a Gmail account,
which is pretty much my name.

00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:31.270
I'm not going to give
it out to everyone.

00:29:31.270 --> 00:29:32.811
Because I was a
early adopter, right?

00:29:32.811 --> 00:29:34.589
And people love
getting access early.

00:29:34.589 --> 00:29:36.880
And if you can figure out a
way to psychologically make

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:38.588
people feel part of
the process, then you

00:29:38.588 --> 00:29:40.130
are going to be a winner.

00:29:40.130 --> 00:29:41.990
So how's everyone doing?

00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:42.727
We good?

00:29:42.727 --> 00:29:43.310
Everyone good?

00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:45.184
We're going to have some
questions afterward.

00:29:45.184 --> 00:29:47.840
If you have questions
even now, as long as

00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:50.182
you ask them politely, please.

00:29:50.182 --> 00:29:51.390
I used to do stand-up comedy.

00:29:51.390 --> 00:29:55.160
So this is a warmer crowd
than dive bars in Baltimore.

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:59.390
There's a smoky haze because
it's non-smoking in this room.

00:29:59.390 --> 00:30:02.960
It's a couple of more examples
is the giver mentality.

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:05.150
Adam Grant-- he's
spoken at Google.

00:30:05.150 --> 00:30:06.680
Have you seen his work?

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:07.880
"Give and Take."

00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:09.314
It's a phenomenal book.

00:30:09.314 --> 00:30:09.980
"Give and Take."

00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:13.010
Adam's a Wharton professor
and a business consultant.

00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:15.590
He talks about how givers
succeed more in life.

00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:19.080
And takers, you obviously
know who they are.

00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:19.580
Right?

00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:21.780
They take the most in life.

00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:23.690
And most of us are matchers.

00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:25.340
So givers, takers, and matchers.

00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:28.282
And matchers are people that
you help me, quid pro quo.

00:30:28.282 --> 00:30:29.990
You scratch my back,
I scratch your back.

00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:32.120
You want to collaborate
with those people, right?

00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:36.230
But givers succeed the most,
and they fail the most.

00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:39.820
Because you need to give with
your own self-interest aligned.

00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:42.260
And you want to give
with your own interests,

00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:44.870
because why give for
the sake of giving?

00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:46.890
Because you get
taken advantage of.

00:30:46.890 --> 00:30:48.260
And that's truly remarkable.

00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:51.860
I wrote an article about why
giving and helping others

00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:53.360
without expecting
anything in return

00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:55.260
is the best business
model for life.

00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:58.320
And I threw it up on
the website medium.com.

00:30:58.320 --> 00:30:59.750
It's a blog engine.

00:30:59.750 --> 00:31:01.730
And it's already
getting surfaced.

00:31:01.730 --> 00:31:03.890
And it made its way to Adam.

00:31:03.890 --> 00:31:07.220
And I ended up getting an
email introduction to him

00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:08.690
because I wrote this article.

00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:11.930
And oftentimes, putting yourself
out there, taking a chance,

00:31:11.930 --> 00:31:14.450
even if it's a blog post
that no one's going to read.

00:31:14.450 --> 00:31:16.880
Like I registered
influencereconomy.com years

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:17.710
ago.

00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:19.234
And multiple companies ago.

00:31:19.234 --> 00:31:21.650
I knew I was never going to
be able to write the book when

00:31:21.650 --> 00:31:23.667
I had a crazy intense job.

00:31:23.667 --> 00:31:24.500
But I bookmarked it.

00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:25.670
I wrote a blog post.

00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:27.717
Well, I wanted
Google SEO as well,

00:31:27.717 --> 00:31:30.050
because I don't want people
searching influencer economy

00:31:30.050 --> 00:31:32.360
and having a Gawker media post.

00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:35.480
But I ultimately did it
because it was a reminder

00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:38.440
to keep this project going,
because life gets in the way.

00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:40.190
And at Google, maybe
some of your products

00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:42.710
get sidled or put
on the back burner.

00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:44.300
But ultimately, that
blog post really

00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:48.170
helps you identify
where you stand.

00:31:48.170 --> 00:31:51.770
And this is a guy named
Troy Carter who I talked to.

00:31:51.770 --> 00:31:53.960
He used to manage Lady Gaga.

00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:55.040
He's a wonderful guy.

00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:59.990
He managed Lady Gaga and Eve,
the rapper, Biggie Smalls,

00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:03.440
aka Notorious BIG, for
those playing at home.

00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:05.960
And he was a club
promoter back in the day.

00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:09.530
And now he's gone on to invest
in companies like Uber and Lyft

00:32:09.530 --> 00:32:11.950
and Dropbox as an
angel investor.

00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:13.770
And we talked about
pivoting with him,

00:32:13.770 --> 00:32:15.870
because he wanted to
be a hip hop artist.

00:32:15.870 --> 00:32:18.410
He grew up in West
Philadelphia, born and raised.

00:32:18.410 --> 00:32:22.610
So of course, his idols were
the Fresh Prince and Jazzy Jeff.

00:32:22.610 --> 00:32:24.140
So he pitched them
in their studio

00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:28.040
after stocking them for a
couple days, maybe weeks.

00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:31.010
And he realized his passion was
in behind-the-scenes producing

00:32:31.010 --> 00:32:32.480
and managing talent.

00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:34.190
So he told me that
you need to have

00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:36.890
that personal internal
gauge tell you

00:32:36.890 --> 00:32:38.780
when it's time to pivot.

00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:40.700
And oftentimes,
people may not know

00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:43.340
that Twitter was originally
a podcast network.

00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:45.680
Twitter was a podcast
network called Odeo.

00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:47.690
But they realized at
the time that Apple

00:32:47.690 --> 00:32:50.330
was going to dominate
the podcasting landscape.

00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:53.030
Instagram was originally
a check-in device

00:32:53.030 --> 00:32:55.910
like Foursquare, where you
could tell people your location.

00:32:55.910 --> 00:32:57.410
But they got the
market feedback.

00:32:57.410 --> 00:32:59.600
And they pivoted to
make their idea better.

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:02.450
And ultimately, pivoting comes
down to moments in your career

00:33:02.450 --> 00:33:03.650
or with your products.

00:33:03.650 --> 00:33:06.860
But with Troy, I
asked him, how do

00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:10.310
you go from being a talent
manager in the music industry

00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:13.400
to being a prolific angel
investor in tech companies?

00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:14.300
And he told me--

00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:16.100
it was really funny--
he said, well,

00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:19.205
there's curiosity,
because I wanted

00:33:19.205 --> 00:33:20.870
to know if there
was life on Mars

00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:23.519
in Silicon Valley as
a music executive.

00:33:23.519 --> 00:33:25.560
And they wanted to know
if there was life on Mars

00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:27.980
as a music industry veteran.

00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:29.750
And there was mutual curiosity.

00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:31.400
And he waited a
year before he even

00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:34.145
did an investment, because he
wanted to survey the landscape.

00:33:34.145 --> 00:33:35.770
So pivoting doesn't
mean just, hey, I'm

00:33:35.770 --> 00:33:39.470
going to stop what I'm doing
and actually change my tracks.

00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:42.320
It means I'm going to enhance
what I'm doing and leverage

00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:45.050
my opportunities and
build on my network,

00:33:45.050 --> 00:33:47.370
because I have established
myself in one field.

00:33:47.370 --> 00:33:50.120
And I can transition
that to another.

00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:53.540
So that is what
we're sharing today

00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:57.350
in the influencer economy with
how to launch and collaborate

00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:58.730
and thrive.

00:33:58.730 --> 00:34:02.960
And this is the part where I
talk about some pun related

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:05.360
to stand-up comedy,
because people always say,

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:07.350
you need to tie
it back to comedy.

00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:10.130
So I'll just give
you one example

00:34:10.130 --> 00:34:13.820
of what I learned through
stand-up was that you always

00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:15.969
got to finish your set.

00:34:15.969 --> 00:34:18.940
That was the hardest part
was when I was doing sets

00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:23.320
at open mics or at The Improv
where I reached my peak,

00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:26.080
was you always have your set
list on a cocktail napkin,

00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:28.000
whether you're drinking
a beer or water.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.033
And you have your jokes.

00:34:29.033 --> 00:34:30.699
You know, bands have
it as well onstage.

00:34:30.699 --> 00:34:33.340
And they have their set down.

00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:36.400
And I got heckled so hard at
this dive bar in Baltimore

00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:38.320
that people were
calling like, look at me

00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:41.170
and think of any insult
that stereotypically

00:34:41.170 --> 00:34:42.699
you could make for me.

00:34:42.699 --> 00:34:44.380
And that's what they gave me.

00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:46.690
And I gave up on my set.

00:34:46.690 --> 00:34:49.750
And that's the advice I'd give
to anyone with stand-up comedy

00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:53.699
or writing a book or launching a
product, is never get deterred,

00:34:53.699 --> 00:34:57.190
and always follow your
methods and your philosophy

00:34:57.190 --> 00:34:58.390
and finish your set.

00:34:58.390 --> 00:35:00.490
Because even if you get
through it and you bomb,

00:35:00.490 --> 00:35:04.160
there's always the next
gig that you can go to.

00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:07.094
Thank you very much for
checking this out today.

00:35:07.094 --> 00:35:12.310
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:15.460
SPEAKER 1: I'd love to hear from
you just a little bit about how

00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:19.810
you've maybe shared some
of those same principles

00:35:19.810 --> 00:35:21.970
that you walked us
through, but in your life.

00:35:21.970 --> 00:35:24.520
How have you applied
some of this, Ryan?

00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:28.150
RYAN WILLIAMS: So for starters,
I mentioned I have a podcast.

00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:32.110
If it was present day, I would
not start a podcast right now,

00:35:32.110 --> 00:35:34.337
because it's so
competitive and noisy.

00:35:34.337 --> 00:35:35.920
But when I started
it three years ago,

00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:37.750
I was an early adopter.

00:35:37.750 --> 00:35:39.310
And it was unique.

00:35:39.310 --> 00:35:41.110
So I could land a lot
of A-plus interviews

00:35:41.110 --> 00:35:43.660
with people like Seth
Godin or Brad Feld

00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:46.520
that I couldn't get unless
I had been an early adopter.

00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:48.520
And so that was a
characteristic that I realized

00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:52.060
that I was fortunate
to have, and that all

00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:54.040
these influential people
I interviewed always

00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:56.320
thought about tech
to enable them.

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:59.500
And then equally, having
that platform of a podcast

00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:02.369
could get me in the door with
people that ordinarily may not

00:36:02.369 --> 00:36:03.910
be interested in
what I'm working on,

00:36:03.910 --> 00:36:05.900
because as you know,
I worked at Machinima

00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:09.460
and these big startups, and all
these companies maybe you've

00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:10.920
never even heard of.

00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:13.660
And so why would these
influential people talk to me?

00:36:13.660 --> 00:36:16.270
But I pitched them on this
big vision with the book.

00:36:16.270 --> 00:36:18.460
And who doesn't want
to be in a book?

00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:19.150
Right?

00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:21.020
And then also I had
a podcast that I'm

00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:22.210
going to edit meticulously.

00:36:22.210 --> 00:36:23.050
And it's on iTunes.

00:36:23.050 --> 00:36:24.730
They can share it
with their friends.

00:36:24.730 --> 00:36:26.605
And who doesn't want to
talk about themselves

00:36:26.605 --> 00:36:27.580
for 45 minutes?

00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:30.160
So those two elements
really got reinforced

00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:33.790
as I kept doing the
research for the book.

00:36:33.790 --> 00:36:35.290
AUDIENCE: So how
did you make people

00:36:35.290 --> 00:36:36.498
come to the basketball games?

00:36:40.180 --> 00:36:42.520
RYAN WILLIAMS: This group
was an insurgent group.

00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:44.650
For those of you
that study marketing,

00:36:44.650 --> 00:36:48.570
it's always good
to have an enemy.

00:36:48.570 --> 00:36:51.150
Google started
off with an enemy.

00:36:51.150 --> 00:36:54.750
My enemy in this PowerPoint is
celebrities like Kim Kardashian

00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:56.160
and Seacrest.

00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:58.855
And so our enemies actually
were the Memorial Maniacs.

00:36:58.855 --> 00:37:00.960
If you were there
with this group,

00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:02.220
they did things by the book.

00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:03.790
Let's just say that.

00:37:03.790 --> 00:37:06.540
And so The Psychos is
the group I started.

00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:09.170
And I stole the movie
font from the movie

00:37:09.170 --> 00:37:10.590
and put it on a t-shirt.

00:37:10.590 --> 00:37:13.140
And then Hitchcock, he's
known for his outline,

00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:15.560
his soliloquy outline.

00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:18.810
So I took it in Cornelius
Vanderbilt silhouette.

00:37:18.810 --> 00:37:20.490
And I put it on the
back of the t-shirt.

00:37:20.490 --> 00:37:22.245
And I was the anti [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:22.245 --> 00:37:23.120
We're going have fun.

00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:25.830
We're gonna have parties
before and after.

00:37:25.830 --> 00:37:27.630
And I made it more
of an experience.

00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:30.331
So win or lose, you had
that connected community.

00:37:30.331 --> 00:37:31.830
And also I went to
school with a lot

00:37:31.830 --> 00:37:34.500
of fragmented fraternities
and sororities

00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:36.220
and different organizations.

00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:38.730
So this was like a
neutral party and location

00:37:38.730 --> 00:37:40.855
where we could all get
together and rally and yell.

00:37:40.855 --> 00:37:43.355
And our team ultimately didn't
even make the NCAA tournament

00:37:43.355 --> 00:37:44.190
when I started it.

00:37:44.190 --> 00:37:46.560
But I think having that
community and that connectivity

00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:47.677
with others, maybe--

00:37:47.677 --> 00:37:49.760
I think a lot of people
want to meet folks outside

00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:50.970
of their network.

00:37:50.970 --> 00:37:53.760
That's why Twitter and Facebook
and all these communities

00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:56.315
exist, in some ways, because
you want to go out-of-network.

00:37:56.315 --> 00:37:58.440
It's like helping people
meet other folks that they

00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:00.898
wouldn't have met in college
was actually a big part of it.

00:38:00.898 --> 00:38:03.000
And the basketball
was secondary.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.530
It was really the
community part of it.

00:38:05.530 --> 00:38:06.130
Nice recall.

00:38:06.130 --> 00:38:08.645
I like that question.

00:38:08.645 --> 00:38:11.020
AUDIENCE: So do you tend to
have one project you focus on

00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:11.520
at a time?

00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:14.440
Or do you tend to have several
projects going at once?

00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:17.590
RYAN WILLIAMS: I have lots
of products going at once.

00:38:17.590 --> 00:38:22.000
Like I learned from Brad Feld
about piloting your ideas.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:23.980
As long as it doesn't
take up too much time.

00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:28.060
Like I prioritize my podcast,
my book, my consulting business.

00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:31.930
I have an online course
inspired by the book.

00:38:31.930 --> 00:38:35.590
Actually someone from the crowd
when I book toured this summer,

00:38:35.590 --> 00:38:38.260
said hey, you should put
this into an online course.

00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:42.220
And so I just transferred all
the data into a video series.

00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:45.130
And ultimately, I feel like
the strength I've found

00:38:45.130 --> 00:38:49.330
is to be influential is if you
can repurpose your message--

00:38:49.330 --> 00:38:52.050
there's a book called
"Making Ideas Happen"

00:38:52.050 --> 00:38:53.440
by a guy named Scott Belsky.

00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:55.735
He started up Behance that
was acquired by Adobe.

00:38:55.735 --> 00:39:00.880
And he talks about how you need
to be agnostic to the platform,

00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:02.890
but be mission-centric.

00:39:02.890 --> 00:39:05.290
So your mission should
always be true to anything

00:39:05.290 --> 00:39:07.930
you do, whether it's
writing a book, a podcast,

00:39:07.930 --> 00:39:09.820
your consulting
business, a course,

00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:11.320
or any product you make.

00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:13.570
And that's a great way
to help you prioritize

00:39:13.570 --> 00:39:16.990
what to focus on, because if you
start going outside your lane,

00:39:16.990 --> 00:39:19.660
then you can realize that hey,
maybe I'm veering off too much.

00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:22.300
But I believe strongly about
piloting new ideas/ even if you

00:39:22.300 --> 00:39:24.640
write a blog post
that no one reads,

00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:27.070
but it got something off
your chest and makes you feel

00:39:27.070 --> 00:39:29.570
better, and you can share it
to five people in your network.

00:39:29.570 --> 00:39:32.254
Then, there's value in that.

00:39:32.254 --> 00:39:34.670
AUDIENCE: This is a topic that
a lot of people talk about.

00:39:34.670 --> 00:39:37.812
And I just think that there's
a lot of real content there.

00:39:37.812 --> 00:39:38.770
Very, very interesting.

00:39:38.770 --> 00:39:40.390
Thank you for that.

00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:45.160
On your point about
metrics, so you know,

00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:47.620
reality is, a lot of
the social networks

00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:50.230
and the places in which people
congregate on the internet

00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:52.600
are all about subscribers,
likes, and things like that.

00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:53.100
Right?

00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:55.180
And you said that this
doesn't necessarily

00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:58.450
mean whether or not you are
on important influencer.

00:39:58.450 --> 00:40:00.530
But I guess for people
who are arriving

00:40:00.530 --> 00:40:02.530
at any piece of content
from the outside, that's

00:40:02.530 --> 00:40:04.210
the only thing they
have at moment zero.

00:40:04.210 --> 00:40:04.730
Right?

00:40:04.730 --> 00:40:04.970
RYAN WILLIAMS: Right.

00:40:04.970 --> 00:40:07.800
AUDIENCE: It's like as it
becomes the ethos a little bit

00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:09.272
in a certain way.

00:40:09.272 --> 00:40:11.480
So how do you break this
ice when you're starting out

00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:14.057
and you know you have
something good to offer.

00:40:14.057 --> 00:40:16.390
But you're going to have to
be faced with this rejection

00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:18.810
at first with your low numbers?

00:40:18.810 --> 00:40:19.810
RYAN WILLIAMS: Oh, yeah.

00:40:19.810 --> 00:40:21.820
You're going to be
wholeheartedly rejected

00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:22.910
at first.

00:40:22.910 --> 00:40:26.350
I see a lot of people through
the course of my career

00:40:26.350 --> 00:40:28.860
that they build
this amazing thing.

00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:31.442
And it's like an empty
house when they launch it.

00:40:31.442 --> 00:40:33.400
And they're like, say,
where are the customers?

00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:36.097
I thought people would buy my
book or download my product.

00:40:36.097 --> 00:40:37.930
And they don't realize
that you consistently

00:40:37.930 --> 00:40:40.186
have to be in a
phase of relaunching,

00:40:40.186 --> 00:40:42.060
and that you pivot, you
listen to the market,

00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:43.893
you get the feedback,
and then you relaunch.

00:40:43.893 --> 00:40:46.670
The internet has an
incredibly short memory.

00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:47.950
Right?

00:40:47.950 --> 00:40:49.660
Mistakes we made at
Machinima on YouTube,

00:40:49.660 --> 00:40:51.580
we could just take
the video down.

00:40:51.580 --> 00:40:52.510
People forget.

00:40:52.510 --> 00:40:54.520
Imagine the inundation
of information

00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:56.515
we get through social
media every day.

00:40:56.515 --> 00:40:57.390
People make mistakes.

00:40:57.390 --> 00:40:58.420
You own it.

00:40:58.420 --> 00:40:59.720
And you move on.

00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:01.440
And I think ultimately,
perseverance

00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:03.190
is really-- like you
have to have a bigger

00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:06.380
vision, because you can
get lost in the weeds.

00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:08.610
Like if you start a
pilot, a project--

00:41:08.610 --> 00:41:12.040
let's say you're writing a blog,
and there's no bigger purpose,

00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:13.956
then you're going to lose focus.

00:41:13.956 --> 00:41:15.580
So if you can tie it
into a longer term

00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:18.190
opportunity for yourself
and say, this is a channel.

00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:19.440
This is a platform.

00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:21.820
I'm building an alpha
prototype for a product.

00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:23.350
And I want to get to beta.

00:41:23.350 --> 00:41:25.119
Because that's going
to get me to launch.

00:41:25.119 --> 00:41:27.160
And doing smaller milestones
for a bigger vision.

00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:29.860
I feel like wrapping
those two up together is

00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:32.530
a recipe for success,
because ultimately, it's

00:41:32.530 --> 00:41:34.960
so easy to lose focus because
we're incredibly busy.

00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:37.209
And so if you don't have a
bigger mission or purpose--

00:41:37.209 --> 00:41:39.060
and sometimes that
takes time to discover.

00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:41.050
And if you don't just
put yourself out there,

00:41:41.050 --> 00:41:42.250
then you'll never know.

00:41:42.250 --> 00:41:43.390
And so if you start
something now,

00:41:43.390 --> 00:41:45.140
getting back to your
part of your question

00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:47.771
about making it pop or
making it successful,

00:41:47.771 --> 00:41:49.270
it's really finding
that validation.

00:41:49.270 --> 00:41:53.560
Like, with my podcast, I've had
some fairly well-known people

00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:57.790
that I didn't invite on the show
as Episode number 3's guest.

00:41:57.790 --> 00:41:59.440
You know, I built
up 25 episodes.

00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:02.080
And then I knew
Willie Geist, who's

00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:04.720
hosted "The Today
Show," from college.

00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:06.850
And I reached out to
him at Episode 25.

00:42:06.850 --> 00:42:11.440
And I said, I have
this valid audience.

00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:12.740
I started writing the book.

00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:15.460
And so don't go after
influencers too early.

00:42:15.460 --> 00:42:18.490
It's like they can
really help jet fuel

00:42:18.490 --> 00:42:22.000
to get your product to
market in an accelerated way.

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:23.989
And then equally
once they're there,

00:42:23.989 --> 00:42:25.530
make sure your
website doesn't crash.

00:42:25.530 --> 00:42:27.071
Make sure your
product doesn't break.

00:42:27.071 --> 00:42:29.890
Like, I was on the front page of
Reddit with one of my podcasts.

00:42:29.890 --> 00:42:31.930
And I have children.

00:42:31.930 --> 00:42:34.180
And I was like walking
my kid down the street.

00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:36.010
And I see this woman's tweet.

00:42:36.010 --> 00:42:38.385
And she's part of a community
called Rooster Teeth, which

00:42:38.385 --> 00:42:39.400
is a YouTube network.

00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:40.960
She tweets out my link.

00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:42.250
And I'm like freaking out.

00:42:42.250 --> 00:42:44.330
My kid, and I'm pushing
her down the street.

00:42:44.330 --> 00:42:45.160
And I ran home.

00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:47.460
And it was just like,
what's going on here?

00:42:47.460 --> 00:42:48.910
Is my website stable?

00:42:48.910 --> 00:42:50.582
Because I got that surge.

00:42:50.582 --> 00:42:52.540
And so really having the
technology proved out.

00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:55.606
And if your website breaks,
that's a great problem to have.

00:42:55.606 --> 00:42:56.980
AUDIENCE: So your
presentation is

00:42:56.980 --> 00:43:01.030
focused on consumer goods and
performances and things that

00:43:01.030 --> 00:43:06.280
mostly are products being
marketed out there to people.

00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:08.620
What about for things
like political mindshare?

00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:10.900
Could the same general
ideas and concepts

00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:14.407
be applied to something
like a political campaign?

00:43:14.407 --> 00:43:15.490
RYAN WILLIAMS: Absolutely.

00:43:15.490 --> 00:43:17.500
I think getting into
the heart of the matter

00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:21.255
with finding problems
and people's needs.

00:43:21.255 --> 00:43:22.880
So politics is
interesting in two ways.

00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:26.890
One is how you reach people
during the campaign season

00:43:26.890 --> 00:43:30.820
to find their problems to
then make them feel heard,

00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:32.104
and say, I'm working on this.

00:43:32.104 --> 00:43:33.520
I'm solving this
problem with you.

00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:37.090
I think that the most
phenomenal political campaigns

00:43:37.090 --> 00:43:39.040
are run like a tech product.

00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:39.550
Right?

00:43:39.550 --> 00:43:41.740
Where you do
gathering and surveys.

00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:43.000
And you build the alpha.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.010
You build that core
community of people

00:43:45.010 --> 00:43:47.140
that are going to help
you reach a critical mass.

00:43:47.140 --> 00:43:49.710
And then you reach out to
swing states if you're running

00:43:49.710 --> 00:43:50.120
the president's.

00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:52.328
And you have to make a
message that goes a little bit

00:43:52.328 --> 00:43:54.160
more mainstream in most cases.

00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:55.630
But ultimately,
that core community

00:43:55.630 --> 00:43:57.676
of people whose
problems you're solving

00:43:57.676 --> 00:43:59.050
is what's going
to get you there.

00:43:59.860 --> 00:44:02.560
Like student debt for
college graduates.

00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:04.030
That's a huge problem.

00:44:04.030 --> 00:44:06.202
60 million people
are affected by it.

00:44:06.202 --> 00:44:07.660
So if you run for
president, that's

00:44:07.660 --> 00:44:10.000
a great market to
address and figure out

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.610
a way to solve that
problem with that community

00:44:12.610 --> 00:44:14.950
like you would building
a product at Google.

00:44:14.950 --> 00:44:18.280
And then secondarily,
how bills get passed

00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:21.340
and how the back and
forth having open forums,

00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:24.220
town halls to get
feedback on bills that you

00:44:24.220 --> 00:44:26.364
want to pass, and have ideas.

00:44:26.364 --> 00:44:28.780
And I look at it like if you
have 100 people that give you

00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:31.530
advice from a random
sample set, if you

00:44:31.530 --> 00:44:34.811
get one big idea from that
group, it's entirely worth it.

00:44:34.811 --> 00:44:35.310
Right?

00:44:35.310 --> 00:44:37.230
And it gets people
involved so they

00:44:37.230 --> 00:44:39.900
can help you transcend
the message to other folks

00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:41.160
to get them on board.

00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:44.820
And I look at actually passing
bills with a tech angle

00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:45.360
as well.

00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:47.490
And that would be better
served with Congress

00:44:47.490 --> 00:44:51.660
in passing with transparency,
listening to people's needs,

00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:54.600
truly collaborating with
the community, and ideally

00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:56.230
both sides of aisle.

00:44:56.230 --> 00:44:57.890
AUDIENCE: I was just wondering.

00:44:57.890 --> 00:45:00.860
Your book on Amazon has
200 reviews and all of them

00:45:00.860 --> 00:45:01.670
five stars.

00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:02.750
How did you do that?

00:45:05.420 --> 00:45:09.550
RYAN WILLIAMS: So thank you
for checking out the reviews.

00:45:09.550 --> 00:45:11.060
They're not vanity metrics.

00:45:11.060 --> 00:45:12.211
They're real world metrics.

00:45:12.211 --> 00:45:12.710
Right?

00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:16.190
So I'll tell you just the truth.

00:45:16.190 --> 00:45:19.640
I was approached by a
friend who is an author.

00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:23.500
And I don't know if I should be
admitting this, but he said--

00:45:23.500 --> 00:45:24.650
I self-published.

00:45:24.650 --> 00:45:26.180
He said, if you
want a publisher,

00:45:26.180 --> 00:45:28.850
then you need 100
Amazon reviews.

00:45:28.850 --> 00:45:32.090
Because that's the one
percenter of books on Amazon.

00:45:32.090 --> 00:45:34.610
So 1% of all books
have 100 reviews.

00:45:34.610 --> 00:45:38.630
So he says you'll have that
social proof if you actually

00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:39.297
get 100 reviews.

00:45:39.297 --> 00:45:40.963
And then I'll introduce
you to my agent.

00:45:40.963 --> 00:45:42.480
And you know, the
rest is history.

00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:44.270
So the book's going
to come out next year.

00:45:44.270 --> 00:45:48.940
We're translating into
Korean simultaneously.

00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:51.650
And so 100 reviews
is a huge threshold.

00:45:51.650 --> 00:45:53.057
So I would barter with people.

00:45:53.057 --> 00:45:54.890
And if you came to my
book event this summer

00:45:54.890 --> 00:45:57.410
in Raleigh, North Carolina,
and I'm signing books,

00:45:57.410 --> 00:45:59.090
and you have a
long line of people

00:45:59.090 --> 00:46:02.330
that are asking in-depth
questions, I would say, look.

00:46:02.330 --> 00:46:04.490
If you leave me
an Amazon review,

00:46:04.490 --> 00:46:07.250
if you honestly read the
book, I will give you

00:46:07.250 --> 00:46:10.021
a free Skype consultation
when I go back to LA.

00:46:10.021 --> 00:46:10.520
Right.

00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:11.769
So I would barter with people.

00:46:11.769 --> 00:46:14.120
And they would give me
amazing feedback on the book.

00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:15.980
I look at a book like software.

00:46:15.980 --> 00:46:17.600
And I'll publish 2.0 next year.

00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:21.110
And I'll use that feedback
as part of the experience,

00:46:21.110 --> 00:46:23.400
because people have told me
how I can make it better.

00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:26.015
And so I found hooks
like that where--

00:46:26.015 --> 00:46:27.890
like, I'm on the board
of my kids' preschool.

00:46:27.890 --> 00:46:30.050
And a bunch of people
bought the book.

00:46:30.050 --> 00:46:32.480
And there's that
phrase, "just ask."

00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:35.010
Like, no one knows that
Amazon reviews are currency.

00:46:35.010 --> 00:46:37.090
They don't know that
it's a bartering economy,

00:46:37.090 --> 00:46:39.382
and that that matters to
people like me that are really

00:46:39.382 --> 00:46:40.506
getting the word out there.

00:46:40.506 --> 00:46:42.140
And the fact that
it was noticeable--

00:46:42.140 --> 00:46:44.420
a Korean publisher-- I
had four people from Korea

00:46:44.420 --> 00:46:46.001
reach out to me in three weeks.

00:46:46.001 --> 00:46:47.750
And I imagine those
reviews really matter,

00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:51.020
because you can get social proof
from the community, not just

00:46:51.020 --> 00:46:52.160
influencers.

00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:54.230
If you have a million
YouTube subscribers

00:46:54.230 --> 00:46:56.180
and a bunch of Amazon reviews.

00:46:56.180 --> 00:46:57.680
So I really bartered
with people,

00:46:57.680 --> 00:47:00.162
because no one understood
really from my friends,

00:47:00.162 --> 00:47:01.370
the people that would see it.

00:47:01.370 --> 00:47:04.280
So anyone listening now, please,
if you leave an Amazon review,

00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:06.009
honestly, that would be amazing.

00:47:06.009 --> 00:47:08.300
And email me and tell me what
you think about the book,

00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:10.880
because you have to open
yourself up to criticism.

00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:13.850
And the reviews
actually are solid,

00:47:13.850 --> 00:47:16.100
because it was the
right focus group

00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:19.250
with the core community
of people who want

00:47:19.250 --> 00:47:20.989
to read this type of content.

00:47:20.989 --> 00:47:22.280
SPEAKER 1: Thank you very much.

00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:23.113
RYAN WILLIAMS: Yeah.

00:47:23.113 --> 00:47:23.750
Thank you.

00:47:23.750 --> 00:47:25.550
Thank you, Peyton, and uh--

00:47:25.550 --> 00:47:28.600
[APPLAUSE]
