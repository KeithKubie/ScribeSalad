00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
In this unit, we talked about electric field line.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
And we described electric field lines as a way of visualizing the forces caused by an electric field.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
If for example I had a particle right here,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
this line would indicate that the force of electric field would push it this way

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
if it had a positive charge and this way if it had a negative charge.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And for this problem I've drawn three separate field diagrams.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Each of which are corresponding to the same configuration of charges.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
We have one particle with the charge of +5q, another particle with the charge of just +q,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and finally a particle with the charge of -10q.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Out of these three electric field diagrams, only one of them has the lines drawn correctly.

00:00:36.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Can you tell me which one of these is drawn correctly? Check your answer down here.
