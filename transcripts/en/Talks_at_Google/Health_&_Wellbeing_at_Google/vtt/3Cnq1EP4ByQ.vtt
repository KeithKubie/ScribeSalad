[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.942 --> 00:00:08.650
GOPI KALLAYIL: All
right, good afternoon,

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:09.820
Yoglers and Googlers.

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.430
I'm delighted to welcome
to the Google campus

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.640
one of the most celebrated
names in Bollywood today, Shilpa

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.039
Shetty Kundra.

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.322
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.230
Shilpa's an actress,
producer, former model.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.690
She's the winner of
the British reality TV

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:31.590
show, "Celebrity Big Brother
5" and has been nominated

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.997
for four Filmfare awards.

00:00:33.997 --> 00:00:35.580
And over the years,
she's delighted us

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.970
with her acting and dancing
in mostly Hindi movies,

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.220
but also Tamil,
Telugu, and Kannada.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.920
But more importantly,
she has this passion

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.940
for the art of wellness and
how we can transform ourselves

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.990
inside out through modalities
like yoga, meditation,

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.870
or good nutrition, which
is one of the main topics

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.800
she wants to share with us.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.830
And if you get lucky, she
might actually lead us

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.090
through a short yoga practice.

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.420
So please help me
with a Bollywood-style

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.452
welcome to Shilpa Shetty Kundra.

00:01:05.452 --> 00:01:05.952
Shilpa.

00:01:05.952 --> 00:01:09.256
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:11.616 --> 00:01:13.370
SHILPA SHETTY KUNDRA: Namaste.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.690
Wow, what an
amazing introduction

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.490
from the yogi himself.

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:19.360
I'm elated.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.560
Thank you so much.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.601
GOPI KALLAYIL: Thank you.

00:01:21.601 --> 00:01:23.117
Namaste and welcome, Shilpa.

00:01:23.117 --> 00:01:24.200
SHILPA SHETTY KUNDRA: Wow.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.310
I'm at Google.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.290
[LAUGHS] Yay.

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.140
This is fab.

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.480
GOPI KALLAYIL: With the
yoga practice in Googlers

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:31.240
called Yoglers.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.823
SHILPA SHETTY KUNDRA:
I know, Yoglers.

00:01:32.823 --> 00:01:33.790
How wonderful is that?

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.635
So all of you actually do yoga?

00:01:35.635 --> 00:01:38.110
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.221
That's terrible.

00:01:40.221 --> 00:01:41.830
That's terrible, guys.

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.730
Let's hope we can change that.

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.450
So if I do come in
next time, let's

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.182
see more people saying yes to
that, like, more confidently.

00:01:50.182 --> 00:01:51.478
GOPI KALLAYIL: Absolutely.

00:01:51.478 --> 00:01:52.270
SHILPA SHETTY KUNDRA: Yeah.

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:53.710
GOPI KALLAYIL: No, we have
a pretty active program

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.750
with several hundred
classes a week.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.110
Just in the San
Francisco Bay Area alone,

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.460
we have 50 classes every week.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.900
SHILPA SHETTY KUNDRA:
That's wonderful.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.175
GOPI KALLAYIL: And
they're pretty packed.

00:02:01.175 --> 00:02:03.380
But on your channel,
one of your signatures

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.030
is swastra ho mastra ho.

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.530
Right?

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.130
We got to make everyone do that.

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.631
So can you demonstrate it once?

00:02:08.631 --> 00:02:10.130
And then I'll get
the whole audience

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.390
to join it a couple of times.

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:12.196
What do you say?

00:02:12.196 --> 00:02:14.070
SHILPA SHETTY KUNDRA:
So swastra ho mastra ho

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.580
means stay healthy, and just
throw caution to the wind,

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.170
and just be happy.

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.710
So that truly is
my mantra in life,

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.120
stay happy and stay [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.490
So I do it like this.

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.107
Swastra ho, mastra ho!

00:02:29.107 --> 00:02:31.690
GOPI KALLAYIL: All right, let's
do it with her a couple times.

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:32.200
Do it again.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.630
SHILPA SHETTY KUNDRA: Yeah.

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.910
GOPI KALLAYIL: Everybody.

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.285
SHILPA SHETTY
KUNDRA: Swastra ho!

00:02:34.285 --> 00:02:35.304
Mastra ho!

00:02:35.304 --> 00:02:37.220
GOPI KALLAYIL: One more
time, a little louder.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.690
SHILPA SHETTY
KUNDRA: Swastra ho--

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:39.940
GOPI KALLAYIL: With the hands.

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:40.900
Mastra ho.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:41.730
Thank you.

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.220
SHILPA SHETTY KUNDRA: Normally,
you can see my biceps.

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.962
But yeah.

00:02:43.962 --> 00:02:46.505
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:46.505 --> 00:02:48.880
GOPI KALLAYIL: So I understand
you are here for a women's

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.250
empowerment conference.

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.560
SHILPA SHETTY KUNDRA: Yes.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.851
GOPI KALLAYIL: How did that go?

00:02:51.851 --> 00:02:54.130
And what is your vision
for empowering women

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.030
around the world?

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.890
SHILPA SHETTY
KUNDRA: Oh, my god.

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.100
Yeah, that went really well.

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.850
I mean, we're close to Women's
Day on the 8th of March.

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.810
And I thought this was
a great opportunity.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.200
And when I was offered
it, I said, great,

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.690
I'll tour around the US.

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.950
And more importantly, I
think, since I've just

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:21.652
started this wellness series
through digital media,

00:03:21.652 --> 00:03:23.860
I just thought this would
be a great opportunity also

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.400
to come and visit you guys,
learn from you, and help--

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:34.090
or rather, get help from you
to help me help the world.

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.290
And you know, I've been
acting for the last 20 years.

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.110
But this truly is my calling.

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:44.620
I really believe that
I became an actor

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.390
and I became someone who's
famous so that I could

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.580
be of some use in this sphere.

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:57.850
And for me, health
is truly my passion.

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.210
I've suffered with
cervical spondylosis.

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:03.100
I've seen people who
are near and dear

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.210
to me suffer with cancer.

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:10.390
And I've been able to
change my life through yoga,

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.560
through meditation, through
good eating habits, which I

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.750
call a lifestyle modification.

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.370
I never use the word
"diet" because I

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.190
think it's just so
vulgarized, the word

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.380
"diet," that the
minute you say "diet,"

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:24.995
people are put off by it.

00:04:24.995 --> 00:04:26.620
They think it's going
to be bland food.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.390
It's not going to be tasty.

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:33.310
It's going to be
sodium-less, oil-less.

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:40.740
So I said, how do I debunk these
myths with food, with health?

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:46.221
And there is a lot of
information on Google.

00:04:46.221 --> 00:04:46.720
Great.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.930
[LAUGHS] I just
thought I'll make

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.290
it easier through
my channel to make

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:59.320
it a one-stop shop for people
who really can't afford a gym,

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.380
don't have the time to
work out, don't know what

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.840
to cook for their children.

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.690
And I just think that women
especially are already

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:14.320
in such an empowered
position, since we're

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.980
talking about empowerment,
I thought to just give them

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:24.290
the knowledge and empower them
with the knowledge of health,

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:27.400
which I think is
something that is

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.960
far more powerful than the
feminist sort of empowering.

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.880
You know?

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.530
I thought to my channel
I'd be able to channelize

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.290
a bit of my knowledge
through the experts

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:45.880
that I have on my channel,
to be able to empower people

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:51.210
with the importance of health,
how important it is to breathe,

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:52.610
which we're not doing.

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:55.840
In this time and age, we're so
busy running after our goals,

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.330
we're not breathing.

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.010
Forget doing pranayamas.

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:01.470
How many of you
actually sit down

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:06.160
and take a breath of fresh air?

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:06.990
Very few.

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:07.720
Yeah, you do.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:08.870
GOPI KALLAYIL: Yes.

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.369
SHILPA SHETTY KUNDRA: I'm not
directing the question to you.

00:06:11.369 --> 00:06:17.060
[LAUGHS] But none of us sit
down and just inhale and exhale.

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:18.700
We don't do that.

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:19.704
Our chest isn't opening.

00:06:19.704 --> 00:06:21.370
GOPI KALLAYIL: OK,
teach them right now.

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:23.140
Let's change that.

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:23.924
How do you do it?

00:06:23.924 --> 00:06:25.090
SHILPA SHETTY KUNDRA: Just--

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:26.131
GOPI KALLAYIL: Lead them.

00:06:26.131 --> 00:06:32.194
SHILPA SHETTY KUNDRA: [INHALES]
You just open up, you know.

00:06:32.194 --> 00:06:35.503
Inhale all the positivity.

00:06:35.503 --> 00:06:39.670
[EXHALES] Exhale
all the negativity.

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:42.190
Trust me, there's lots of it.

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:43.607
OK?

00:06:43.607 --> 00:06:45.190
And when you're
inhaling and exhaling,

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:47.620
you're not doing you just
from your chest and your body,

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:50.390
you're doing it from your mind.

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:55.600
So it's your entire mind and
soul that is getting purified.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:59.200
You know, oxygen is
reaching your lungs,

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:03.160
and it's purifying your
body and your mind.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.510
It opens up your mind.

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:08.770
And the space that you guys
are in-- trust me-- it's

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:10.620
going to help you a lot.

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:12.070
Your need your mind.

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:14.290
You're all mind workers.

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:18.790
And I just think that small
little things like that,

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:21.550
breathing-- chewing food.

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:26.290
Chewing food, how many of us
chew our foods up 32 times?

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:28.530
Each morsel has to
be chewed 32 times.

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:29.950
[INAUDIBLE] ayurveda.

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:34.090
Because that's the reason
we're given 32 teeth.

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:35.230
None of us do it.

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:37.380
We just [GULPS].

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:39.010
We just gobble it.

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:41.500
We've started gobbling our food.

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:43.960
We've stopped-- we
don't even concentrate

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:45.820
on what we're eating.

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:48.190
How many of you look at
your food with gratitude

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:49.190
and say, oh, my god.

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:49.930
Wow.

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:52.450
This is going into my body.

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:53.980
None of us do it.

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:55.360
You do it?

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.780
That's why you look so
pink, in the pink of health.

00:07:57.780 --> 00:07:59.613
GOPI KALLAYIL: He looks
well-nourished, yes.

00:07:59.613 --> 00:08:00.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.780
SHILPA SHETTY KUNDRA: So we
just have stopped living.

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:06.160
We're just living.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:08.770
We're not enjoying our life.

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:11.470
And I just think
that before it gets

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:14.380
too late-- because
I've lost a few people

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:17.700
that I love very
dearly to bad health.

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:20.200
And I just felt that
it was important for me

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:21.880
to take this up as a cause.

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:26.480
I mean, I've worked
with HIV patients.

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:29.830
And I've done something
in that sphere of health.

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:33.580
And I'm like, gosh, what
if we could actually just

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:38.950
rewind and live better
lives rather than reach

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:41.539
a point of no return?

00:08:41.539 --> 00:08:44.890
We all do vitamin
doing injections today.

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:47.470
We're all D3
deficient, most of us.

00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:50.290
80% of us are D3
deficient because we don't

00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:53.170
want to stand out in the sun.

00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:57.040
So I'm like, small
little things.

00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:00.750
I just think I want to bring
focus to the old way of living.

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:03.610
And I want to do that
through this channel.

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:10.210
And it really comes out of my
heart and less from my mind.

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:12.610
And I've said this before.

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:14.050
The world is going digital.

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:17.325
And I thought, let me do it this
way because it will reach out

00:09:17.325 --> 00:09:17.950
to more people.

00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:20.670
I'm really happy, on
the day we launched,

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:25.050
we touched nearly 1.5
views, million views.

00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:28.510
And it was a huge compliment,
and also reassuring

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:30.220
that people are
interested in health.

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:32.844
I don't know if they just wanted
to see Shilpa Shetty in lycra.

00:09:32.844 --> 00:09:33.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:36.970
But [LAUGHS] that couldn't
have been the only reason.

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:38.770
So we have a few
subscribers now.

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:40.082
We've touched nearly 67K.

00:09:40.082 --> 00:09:41.540
GOPI KALLAYIL: So
health, wellness,

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:43.250
and how to are one of
the popular categories.

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:44.450
SHILPA SHETTY KUNDRA: Yes, I've
answered all the questions.

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:46.200
He doesn't need to
ask me any questions.

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.710
GOPI KALLAYIL: No, nut
one of the accomplishments

00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:49.540
we're very proud of,
among everything else,

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:52.180
is that you chose to be
what we call a YouTuber.

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:55.090
You've chosen a platform that
has more than a billion people

00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:57.580
coming and watching some video
or the other every month.

00:09:57.580 --> 00:09:58.340
SHILPA SHETTY KUNDRA: Yeah.

00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:00.340
GOPI KALLAYIL: So in fact, the
audience may not have seen it.

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:02.180
Can we roll a video
just to show everyone

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:07.288
a little taste of what Shilpa's
channel looks like on YouTube?

00:10:07.288 --> 00:10:09.520
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:12.520
- Hello, everyone.

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:16.350
I'm here to tell
you why I'm here

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:19.050
and what this
channel is all about.

00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:21.900
Out of the various things
that I have done in life,

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:24.090
the reason to start
this channel is

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:29.780
to bring about an awareness for
what I value the most, life.

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:32.110
How many of us
really value life?

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:35.500
Why is the quality of
our health deteriorating?

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:37.960
Why do we have to stay
dependent on artificial aids

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:41.590
like medication, vitamin
injections, and succumb

00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:45.340
to deficiencies, diseases,
deteriorating immunity

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:47.200
and genes?

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.600
The answers to all
these questions

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:54.850
lie in one important fact, our
constant neglect and apathy

00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:57.810
towards our own health.

00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:00.850
The target of this channel
is to address both--

00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:04.050
weight as well as health issues.

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:06.770
Those who cannot afford
a gym, or nutritionist,

00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:09.650
or don't have the time for
a regime will be introduced

00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:13.950
to a panel of experts in
various fields of health,

00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:16.640
along with my limited
knowledge and experience.

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:19.520
To make the change, please
subscribe to the Shilpa Shetty

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:23.360
channel where you will find
quick, healthy, and tasty food

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:28.730
recipes made by me, yoga
asanas, simple fitness routines,

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:33.620
and challenges along the way
with weight loss targets.

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:36.440
Remember, there is no
better time than now

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:38.090
to start living healthy.

00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:41.930
Maintaining your weight
and keeping fit is an art.

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:44.640
And the art is, keep it simple.

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:47.020
We'll show you how.

00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:50.719
One last thing,
swastra ho, mastra ho.

00:11:50.719 --> 00:11:51.717
[LAUGHS]

00:11:51.717 --> 00:11:52.715
[END PLAYBACK]

00:11:52.715 --> 00:11:53.419
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:53.419 --> 00:11:55.210
SHILPA SHETTY KUNDRA:
Thank you, thank you.

00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:55.719
Thank you.

00:11:55.719 --> 00:11:57.510
I didn't know they were
going to play that.

00:11:57.510 --> 00:11:59.200
Gosh, I did the whole
spiel on my own.

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:00.825
If I knew they were
going to play that,

00:12:00.825 --> 00:12:03.114
I wouldn't have
to speak so much.

00:12:03.114 --> 00:12:04.530
GOPI KALLAYIL:
Repetition is good.

00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:05.710
So I have two questions
for you, Shilpa.

00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:06.250
SHILPA SHETTY KUNDRA: Yeah.

00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:07.740
GOPI KALLAYIL: First is, how
has the experience with YouTube

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:08.240
been?

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:11.270
And secondly, you've got some
of the smartest YouTube folks

00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:12.470
sitting right here.

00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:14.465
Do you have any ask for them?

00:12:14.465 --> 00:12:15.590
SHILPA SHETTY KUNDRA: Yeah.

00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:17.180
I want to ask them to help me.

00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:18.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:21.501
GOPI KALLAYIL: What
help do you want?

00:12:21.501 --> 00:12:23.000
SHILPA SHETTY KUNDRA:
Obviously, I'd

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.390
love to hear from you how
I could popularize this.

00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:29.870
And I realize why I think I'm
one of the first celebrities

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:31.100
to be a YouTuber.

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:33.200
Because it takes so long.

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:35.450
It takes so much time.

00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:38.390
You know, we're such a pampered
lot and also spoiled in the way

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:41.160
that we are paid
for every minute.

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.520
And this is something
that I'm doing free.

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:47.480
And I'm saying this
with a lot of humility.

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:53.030
So I realized when I embarked
on this venture or this journey

00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:55.800
that I thought, you
know, I'll just shoot,

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:57.880
and I'll just start
putting up stuff.

00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:00.720
But it wasn't that easy.

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:04.390
There was work going into
what we are supposed to shoot,

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:07.790
what we are supposed
to actually put out,

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:11.180
targeting all the
important questions.

00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:13.430
As a layman, what is it that--

00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:15.120
how do we start off?

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:19.616
How do we keep that
interest going?

00:13:19.616 --> 00:13:21.240
What is the first
thing that will catch

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:25.760
people's eyes or imagination?

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:27.640
How do we get them
interested in health?

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.480
There was so much homework.

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:34.527
And then the hours of shooting,
eight hours of doing yoga--

00:13:34.527 --> 00:13:35.360
GOPI KALLAYIL: Yeah.

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:36.350
In one day?

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:39.327
SHILPA SHETTY KUNDRA: Eight
hours every shoot of doing--

00:13:39.327 --> 00:13:40.160
you know, six hours.

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:42.714
I couldn't do beyond that
because I started cramping.

00:13:42.714 --> 00:13:44.630
And you know, when you
do yoga, you can't eat.

00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:45.630
GOPI KALLAYIL: True.

00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:47.088
SHILPA SHETTY
KUNDRA: So I was on--

00:13:47.088 --> 00:13:50.970
I was just sipping
on liquids and fruit.

00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:54.580
So our shoots would begin at,
like, 9:00 in the morning.

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:56.667
And I'd have to keep light.

00:13:56.667 --> 00:13:59.000
GOPI KALLAYIL: So you were
fully enlightened by evening.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.041
SHILPA SHETTY KUNDRA: No.

00:14:00.041 --> 00:14:03.320
And the beauty of
it is I discovered--

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:05.450
I discovered so much
through that journey.

00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:07.100
Because I mean,
when you do yoga,

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:09.300
you don't do it beyond an hour.

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:12.170
But at the shoot,
because I, obviously,

00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:15.090
wanted to do my
best, and I wanted

00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:18.810
to do it every
asana to my optimum

00:14:18.810 --> 00:14:24.080
best because I wanted
people to realize that this

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:27.260
is what you can achieve.

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:30.290
So I didn't know I had
that kind of strength.

00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:33.140
And I didn't know that
I could actually stay

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:36.490
without food for six hours.

00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:39.860
And that's the power of yoga.

00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:41.637
It truly is mind over body.

00:14:41.637 --> 00:14:42.720
GOPI KALLAYIL: Absolutely.

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:45.860
SHILPA SHETTY KUNDRA: And so
till the shoot would go on,

00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:46.515
I'd be OK.

00:14:46.515 --> 00:14:48.860
And as soon as the shoot
was over, I'd be like,

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:50.930
give me anything to eat!

00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:52.340
So that is amazing.

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:53.935
And then also with the cooking--

00:14:53.935 --> 00:14:55.310
so we didn't have
a food stylist.

00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:56.660
It's YouTube.

00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:59.030
We had really [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:01.220
So we're, like, cost-cutting.

00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:02.390
I said, we can't afford it.

00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:04.070
This is not a normal shoot.

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:08.510
So everything from cutting
the vegetables to putting it

00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:10.430
on the plate, and
showing it to people,

00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:12.540
I've done it all myself.

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:19.520
And we did nearly
eight dishes a day

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:23.380
because we wanted a bank
before we started rolling.

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:27.890
And the minute we had
60, 70 videos in hand,

00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:29.270
that's when I launched it.

00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:33.660
But the work has been going
on for the last nine months.

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:35.570
So it was a lot of hard work.

00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:37.040
And that's what I realized.

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:40.560
And then after you finished
it, I also had to dub it.

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:44.180
So every asana is dubbed by me.

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:45.620
So it was a lot of hard work.

00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:48.350
So I realized why no
celebrity wants to do this.

00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:50.314
I was like, good gracious god.

00:15:50.314 --> 00:15:51.980
GOPI KALLAYIL: So
that's great feedback.

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:52.938
And we'll take it away.

00:15:52.938 --> 00:15:55.930
And we're happy to share
some best practices with you.

00:15:55.930 --> 00:15:58.590
But one suggestion is actually
that behind-the-scene story

00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:00.436
you just told, that
itself will make

00:16:00.436 --> 00:16:01.560
for an interesting episode.

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:02.935
Because people
want to hear that.

00:16:02.935 --> 00:16:04.290
Your fans want to hear that.

00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:08.130
So go back and relive
the production days--

00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:09.000
one more video.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.200
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:13.217
SHILPA SHETTY
KUNDRA: That's crazy.

00:16:13.217 --> 00:16:14.550
But what did you take out of it?

00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:17.640
I want to know from you because
you are a yogi yourself,

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:19.477
and you're very passionate.

00:16:19.477 --> 00:16:20.310
GOPI KALLAYIL: Yeah.

00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:23.130
So my biggest takeaway
is, when I was a kid,

00:16:23.130 --> 00:16:25.770
I ran away to an ashram
and I learned yoga.

00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:28.970
And we were primarily taught
by bearded men in orange.

00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:31.530
It was an esoteric practice.

00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:34.140
And thanks to now,
supermodels, super-actresses

00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:37.140
turned super-yoginis,
it's become

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:40.200
more accessible to
a larger population.

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:42.000
It's got de-mystified.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.140
And you frame it in
more contemporary terms.

00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:48.644
And you make it accessible to
a lot of people otherwise who

00:16:48.644 --> 00:16:49.810
would not have looked at it.

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:51.360
So I want to thank
you for doing it.

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:51.750
SHILPA SHETTY KUNDRA: How sweet.

00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:52.249
Thank you.

00:16:52.249 --> 00:16:55.160
And I want to thank you that
you're in San Francisco,

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:59.769
and you're such diligent
follower of yoga.

00:16:59.769 --> 00:17:01.560
And you're trying to
spread the word, which

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:02.520
is really wonderful.

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:04.109
So a huge round of
applause for you.

00:17:04.109 --> 00:17:05.150
GOPI KALLAYIL: Thank you.

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:06.262
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:06.262 --> 00:17:07.640
SHILPA SHETTY KUNDRA: Wonderful.

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:09.410
GOPI KALLAYIL: So
speaking of yoga,

00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:12.890
one question, and then we'll
go into a practice mode.

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:16.760
Bollywood is not exactly
the right environment

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:19.594
for a yoga mindfulness
kind of practice.

00:17:19.594 --> 00:17:20.510
It's a frenzied place.

00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:21.759
Things move quickly.

00:17:21.759 --> 00:17:24.300
And there's a lot of tension
and stress, and a lot of travel.

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:26.300
So how do you reconcile
those two worlds

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:28.250
and bring it together?

00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:30.710
SHILPA SHETTY KUNDRA: That's
a really interesting question.

00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:32.540
That's why I'm not
doing movies right now.

00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:37.720
[LAUGHS] I haven't done
for the last seven years.

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:40.160
I think maybe nine.

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:41.760
But I'm still here.

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:43.430
I'm still at Google.

00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:46.040
And I've made my choices.

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:47.305
I've been there, done that.

00:17:47.305 --> 00:17:51.960
I've been part of the milieu
for the last 20 years.

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:53.420
I do TV.

00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:55.610
I choose to do that
because I can't be part

00:17:55.610 --> 00:18:02.600
of this erratic timings and--

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:05.480
I have a
4-and-1/2-year-old baby.

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:08.750
And for me, I'm very
clear that that is my--

00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:09.960
he is my priority.

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:12.370
My family is my first priority.

00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:17.150
And I want to give time to
myself, and unapologetically.

00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:20.780
And when you're an actor,
it's very hard to do that.

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:22.700
So I mean, obviously,
my recognition

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:24.230
comes through movies.

00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:26.480
That will always be
my claim to fame.

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:28.730
I'm very proud of it.

00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:31.610
But if I do choose
to do a movie,

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:33.560
I'll have to work
around my schedules.

00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:37.520
It'll have to be a film that
will start and end quickly.

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:41.810
Also, I think I don't do yoga
because of the frenzied life

00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:43.060
that we lead.

00:18:45.670 --> 00:18:47.360
It's a very hard life.

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:49.730
You're constantly living
in a glass fishbowl.

00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:52.845
And you're getting trolled.

00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:59.750
Instagram determines how famous
you are, how much you're liked.

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:03.260
It's really shallow.

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:10.970
Though I have to say in the
most unhypocritical sort of way,

00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:12.530
that I love that.

00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:13.650
I love it.

00:19:13.650 --> 00:19:15.950
I really do.

00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:19.790
But the time that I
share with myself,

00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:26.101
that, for me, is just my time.

00:19:26.101 --> 00:19:26.600
You know?

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:29.310
It just helps me
cope with everything.

00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:35.840
So even if I'm trolled, and if
somebody writes a bad article,

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:37.580
that's part of my life.

00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:39.770
The morning that I wake
up, and I do my pranayama,

00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:44.600
and I'm in the sun, basking in
its glory, and my feet are--

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:49.340
my feet is firmly on
the grass, that is life.

00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:50.620
You know?

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:55.610
Just being able to do
that, to breathe the air

00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:59.060
and to just live this
blessed life, for me,

00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:07.470
that is far more important than
all the craziness of our job.

00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:09.200
So I think that's what
keeps me grounded.

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:10.790
So a lot of people
tell me, how do you

00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:15.080
manage to be so positive?

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:18.400
And you're, like, smiling.

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:19.760
I get upset.

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:21.890
I'm only human.

00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:23.150
Of course, I get upset.

00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:28.520
Of course, I go through
my times of why would they

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:29.610
write something like that?

00:20:29.610 --> 00:20:31.070
But then I'm out of it.

00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:32.190
I don't carry forward.

00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:35.380
And I think yoga has
helped me do that.

00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:41.940
Yoga has made me believe that
what cannot be cured has to be

00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:43.550
endured.

00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:50.750
And once you understand that,
life is so much more easier.

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:52.920
Otherwise, being an actor
is a really hard job.

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:54.570
Let me tell you.

00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:58.220
And to be part of it for
the last 23 years has been--

00:20:58.220 --> 00:20:58.970
I don't know how--

00:20:58.970 --> 00:21:00.678
I don't know how I've
lasted out so long.

00:21:00.678 --> 00:21:01.390
[LAUGHS]

00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:02.740
GOPI KALLAYIL: Well, yoga,
meditation, you've told us.

00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:04.531
SHILPA SHETTY KUNDRA:
Yeah, really, really.

00:21:04.531 --> 00:21:07.350
And I'm jet-lagged.

00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:09.690
I have traveled all
the way from India.

00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:11.821
And I've done Orlando,
and I've come here.

00:21:11.821 --> 00:21:13.070
I've done an event last night.

00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:15.800
I've barely slept seven hours.

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:18.730
But I got up, and I just
went out in the open.

00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:21.860
And I just did a couple
of breathing exercises,

00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:22.959
and I'm good to go.

00:21:22.959 --> 00:21:24.000
GOPI KALLAYIL: Fantastic.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.630
So would you lead us through a
practice and make us do that?

00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:26.900
SHILPA SHETTY KUNDRA: Sure.

00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:27.860
GOPI KALLAYIL: But
before doing that,

00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:29.390
I got one more thing for you.

00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:32.460
We can't have Shilpa Shetty
here and not do a little thumka.

00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:32.960
Right?

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:33.742
SHILPA SHETTY KUNDRA: Oh, god!

00:21:33.742 --> 00:21:34.464
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:34.464 --> 00:21:35.630
GOPI KALLAYIL: That's like--

00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:36.530
SHILPA SHETTY KUNDRA:
That's terrible.

00:21:36.530 --> 00:21:38.530
GOPI KALLAYIL: That's
like having Michael Jordan

00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:39.740
here and no slam dunks.

00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:42.770
So teach us how
to do the thumka.

00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:44.020
SHILPA SHETTY KUNDRA: Oh, man.

00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:44.580
GOPI KALLAYIL: All right.

00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:45.440
Can we have some music?

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:47.356
SHILPA SHETTY KUNDRA:
You can't do this to me.

00:21:47.356 --> 00:21:49.160
This is really embarrassing.

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:50.840
For all of the
respect that I'm on.

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:52.474

00:21:52.474 --> 00:21:54.140

it's only on YouTube.

So only a billion people
will be watching it.

00:21:55.595 --> 00:21:56.928
SHILPA SHETTY KUNDRA: Oh, great.

00:21:56.928 --> 00:21:58.280
Thanks.

00:21:58.280 --> 00:21:59.850
Yeah, lovely.

00:21:59.850 --> 00:22:01.110
Yeah.

00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:02.015

00:22:02.015 --> 00:22:02.656
GOPI KALLAYIL:
Thank you, Shilpa.

00:22:02.656 --> 00:22:03.850
All right, so
everybody stand up.

00:22:03.850 --> 00:22:05.020
SHILPA SHETTY KUNDRA:
We need music.

00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:07.353

is playing some music for us.

OK.

many people want

Come [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:05.668 --> 00:23:07.980
OK.

00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:09.990
SHILPA SHETTY KUNDRA:
Come on to your sides.

00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:10.950
Get on to your sides.

00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:12.183
And now come up.

00:23:12.183 --> 00:23:14.450
Yeah.

00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:15.680
Sit down.

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:18.110
Yeah, we can all
sit in Sukhasana.

00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:21.720
OK, if you don't know what
that means, just one leg up.

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:26.070
Sukhasana, "sukh"
means "happiness."

00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:28.320
So it's the asana of happiness.

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:36.580
When you are in this asana,
the entire concentration

00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:38.170
is on your core.

00:23:38.170 --> 00:23:40.760
That's where all our
strength lies, our core.

00:23:46.150 --> 00:23:48.220
What is pranayama?

00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:51.220
Most importantly, before we
start, for all those people

00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:55.060
who don't know the
meaning of pranayama,

00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:58.630
"prana" means "life."

00:23:58.630 --> 00:24:04.480
And "yama" means "control."

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:10.540
So the god of death is called
Yama because he controls life.

00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:18.430
So pranayama actually is the
control of your life force,

00:24:18.430 --> 00:24:21.940
which happens through breath.

00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:26.230
So when they say
align your breath,

00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:30.700
you are controlling
your mind through that.

00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:33.580
And when your mind
is in control,

00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:39.280
there's nothing that you
cannot achieve in life.

00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:43.570
So most importantly, why we
lead such fast-paced lives,

00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:49.090
even if we don't get the
time to do all the asanas,

00:24:49.090 --> 00:24:51.800
if we just get the time to
just do a few pranayamas.

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:57.900
It takes 10 minutes.

00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:03.530
And if 10 minutes can actually
align your mind, body,

00:25:03.530 --> 00:25:09.100
and soul, life would
be so worth living.

00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:11.860
So we'll start off with
the simple technique

00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:16.480
of just inhaling and
exhaling through your nose.

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:17.860
OK?

00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:21.910
When you inhale, let
your chest open out.

00:25:21.910 --> 00:25:24.160
OK?

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:25.790
OK?

00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:29.170
In dhyana mudra.

00:25:29.170 --> 00:25:32.710
They say this is
the mudra of wisdom.

00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:36.590
Your heart and your
mind are aligned.

00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:37.480
On your knees.

00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:42.198
Taking a deep breath.

00:25:42.198 --> 00:25:43.572
[INHALES]

00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:48.572

00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:23.140
Wonderful.

00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:26.980
We start off with Anulom Vilum,
where we take in the breath

00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:29.260
through the left nostril.

00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:30.190
OK?

00:26:30.190 --> 00:26:31.630
So this is your hand.

00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:33.820
Just keep it simple.

00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:34.499
OK?

00:26:34.499 --> 00:26:36.290
There's a more complicated
way of doing it.

00:26:36.290 --> 00:26:37.998
I'm going to keep it
simple for you guys.

00:26:37.998 --> 00:26:39.580
Just the index finger out.

00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:40.416
All right?

00:26:40.416 --> 00:26:43.630
The thumb, OK?

00:26:43.630 --> 00:26:45.280
Or you can even do this.

00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:50.470
So you basically need
to control your thumb

00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:54.580
on your right nostril,
breath in through your left.

00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:56.190
I'll do it once for you.

00:26:56.190 --> 00:26:56.690
OK?

through the right.

00:27:28.765 --> 00:27:31.550
So this is Anulom Vilum.

00:27:31.550 --> 00:27:32.210
We'll start.

00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:32.710
OK?

00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:34.155
We do five of these.

00:27:34.155 --> 00:27:35.930
All right?

00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:51.490
[SPEAKING HINDI]
is like if you can

00:27:51.490 --> 00:27:54.630
be in an asana for more
than an hour and a half,

00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:56.500
you are actually going
to attain siddhi.

00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:57.880
You become a true
yogi if you can

00:27:57.880 --> 00:27:59.170
be in a pose for three hours.

00:27:59.170 --> 00:28:00.830
I haven't reached
that stage yet.

yet a qualified yogi.

Eyes closed.

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:51.440
Concentrating on the center of
your forehead, the ajna chakra.

00:30:59.630 --> 00:31:02.485
For all you Googlers, this
is the most important chakra.

00:31:07.789 --> 00:31:11.950
It helps you concentrate.

00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:14.680
And the sahasrara chakra,
which is right above that

00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:15.940
in the center of your head.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:22.915
Open up your mind.

00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:28.760
And just breathe.

00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:49.806
Open your eyes slowly.

00:31:54.570 --> 00:31:56.650
And now we do Kapalbhati.

00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:02.540
Gopi-ji is going to explain
the method of Kapalbhati

00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:04.715
to you because he's
done many classes.

00:32:07.510 --> 00:32:08.470
Basically-- yeah.

00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:10.178
GOPI KALLAYIL: It's
a breathing technique

00:32:10.178 --> 00:32:14.190
where you pump your lungs
up by forcefully exhaling

00:32:14.190 --> 00:32:16.405
and let the inhalation
come in naturally.

00:32:16.405 --> 00:32:19.294
So one way to get the feel
is to place your right hand

00:32:19.294 --> 00:32:20.660
on your abdomen.

00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:24.264
And exhale forcefully,
and just relax.

00:32:24.264 --> 00:32:27.060
So the exhalation is forced.

00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:30.280
The inhalation, you just
let it naturally come.

00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:32.182
Then you do a series
of them like this.

00:32:32.182 --> 00:32:33.660
SHILPA SHETTY KUNDRA:
Shall we do sets of 20?

00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:34.440
GOPI KALLAYIL: OK.

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:36.356
SHILPA SHETTY KUNDRA:
We'll do two sets of 20.

00:32:36.356 --> 00:32:40.350
You have to imagine, what
if a small little insect

00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:41.907
has gone into your nose?

00:32:41.907 --> 00:32:42.990
How would you take it out?

00:32:42.990 --> 00:32:46.570
[EXHALES SEVERAL TIMES]
Yeah, that's

00:32:46.570 --> 00:32:47.680
one way of explaining it.

00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:48.430
GOPI KALLAYIL: 20.

00:32:48.430 --> 00:32:49.555
SHILPA SHETTY KUNDRA: Yeah.

00:32:49.555 --> 00:32:51.050
For people who've
never known yoga.

00:32:51.050 --> 00:32:52.508
GOPI KALLAYIL: Blow
out 20 insects.

00:32:52.508 --> 00:32:54.590
SHILPA SHETTY KUNDRA:
Yeah, blow out 20 insects.

00:32:54.590 --> 00:33:03.070
And you have to feel the air
be pumped from the center.

00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:04.780
OK?

00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:06.970
And what this
technique does, it's

00:33:06.970 --> 00:33:10.330
a brain cleansing technique.

00:33:10.330 --> 00:33:12.940
It's a very, very
powerful technique

00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:16.110
and a powerful pranayama.

00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:20.500
So we start, hands on your--

00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:24.200
one hand on your
navel, the center.

00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:26.590
Yeah?

00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:28.102
Take a deep breath in.

00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:06.490

And you don't have to
move your entire body.

It's only the breath and
your stomach that moves.

00:34:15.150 --> 00:34:19.590
So it's not-- no.

00:34:19.590 --> 00:34:21.739
Your body is upright.

00:34:21.739 --> 00:34:23.830
Align your chakras.

00:34:23.830 --> 00:34:25.839
You have to align
your back, straight.

00:34:29.449 --> 00:34:30.679

I know a lot of you
have just started out.

00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:38.660
So you require a
little more pressure.

00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:43.130
But this is a great technique
to cleanse your nasal passage.

00:35:43.130 --> 00:35:45.650
I'm down with a bad cold,
thanks to San Francisco.

00:35:45.650 --> 00:35:48.320
I was out last night.

00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:54.080
But this a great way
to cleanse your brain,

00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:56.585
to oxygenate your lungs.

00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:03.260
You suddenly start feeling
a glow on your face

00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:08.210
when you continue with this
practice for maybe a month,

00:36:08.210 --> 00:36:10.970
if you do it every day.

00:36:10.970 --> 00:36:14.930
These three pranayamas, if
you can do every day, or maybe

00:36:14.930 --> 00:36:17.540
four times a week, you
will see the difference

00:36:17.540 --> 00:36:22.950
that it will have in
your life, on your life.

00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:25.940
So I always say that
fitness is like a marriage.

00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:29.040
You can't cheat on it
and expect it to work.

00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:32.990
So you have to give it
some amount of your time,

00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:36.110
commitment, and love.

00:36:36.110 --> 00:36:39.380
So do you want to continue?

00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:41.065
Should we do into Shavasana?

00:36:41.065 --> 00:36:43.440
GOPI KALLAYIL: Do you want to
do a little asana practice?

00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:43.870
SHILPA SHETTY KUNDRA: Yeah.

00:36:43.870 --> 00:36:45.180
GOPI KALLAYIL: A couple
of Surya Namaskar?

00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:46.030
SHILPA SHETTY KUNDRA:
Surya Namaskar?

00:36:46.030 --> 00:36:47.610
Wouldn't it be too
difficult for them?

00:36:47.610 --> 00:36:48.690
GOPI KALLAYIL:
It's more likely--

00:36:48.690 --> 00:36:49.620
SHILPA SHETTY KUNDRA: As I do.

00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:50.620
GOPI KALLAYIL: Go ahead.

00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:51.519
Hit it.

00:36:51.519 --> 00:36:52.560
SHILPA SHETTY KUNDRA: Ah.

00:36:55.990 --> 00:36:59.017
AUDIENCE: There are three
pranayama, the Kapalbhati--

00:36:59.017 --> 00:37:01.100
SHILPA SHETTY KUNDRA:
Kapalbhati and Anulom Vilum,

00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:02.780
and just breathe
in, breathe out.

00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:03.276
AUDIENCE: Bhastrika.

00:37:03.276 --> 00:37:05.234
SHILPA SHETTY KUNDRA:
Bhakstrika, no, Bhastrika

00:37:05.234 --> 00:37:07.215
is still a little
more complicated.

00:37:07.215 --> 00:37:10.830
You know when you start
off, you start with ABCD.

00:37:10.830 --> 00:37:12.760
You don't start with XYZ.

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:15.410
So just these
three, concentrating

00:37:15.410 --> 00:37:16.880
on your breath for 15 minutes.

00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:17.720
Can I get a tissue?

00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:18.958
Anybody have a tissue?

00:37:21.862 --> 00:37:23.314
GOPI KALLAYIL: [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:29.950
SHILPA SHETTY KUNDRA: I
normally never start with

00:37:29.950 --> 00:37:32.950
the Surya Namaskar with
people who have just

00:37:32.950 --> 00:37:37.000
started to learn because I feel
you need to spot them and make

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.920
sure that they're going
in the right position

00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:39.940
when they're in Downward Dog.

00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:40.930
I don't want anybody injured.

00:37:40.930 --> 00:37:41.950
So I'm going to
show it to you once.

00:37:41.950 --> 00:37:43.010
GOPI KALLAYIL: Many of
them are practitioners,

00:37:43.010 --> 00:37:43.690
so you should be fine.

00:37:43.690 --> 00:37:44.898
SHILPA SHETTY KUNDRA: Lovely.

00:37:47.008 --> 00:37:47.994
[INAUDIBLE]

00:37:54.910 --> 00:37:56.770
First and foremost,
before you get

00:37:56.770 --> 00:37:58.160
down to doing the
Surya Namaskar,

00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:00.212
we have to do a stretch.

00:38:00.212 --> 00:38:03.000
Yoga is about action, reaction.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:07.240
So every stretch has
a counter-stretch.

00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:12.910
So before starting, just
loosen every part of your body.

00:38:12.910 --> 00:38:14.812
Just shake it all out.

00:38:14.812 --> 00:38:16.290
Yeah.

00:38:16.290 --> 00:38:17.960
Just shake it all out.

00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:20.642
Hands.

00:38:20.642 --> 00:38:24.305
Yeah, just like-- just move.

00:38:24.305 --> 00:38:25.540
Yeah, just every part.

00:38:25.540 --> 00:38:26.530
It's like a dance.

00:38:26.530 --> 00:38:28.510
[LAUGHS] Yeah.

00:38:28.510 --> 00:38:35.060
Just-- just-- just
warm your body up.

00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:35.770
Yeah.

00:38:35.770 --> 00:38:36.895
Just kick your legs around.

00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:47.290
We'll just do the neck
rotation because it's

00:38:47.290 --> 00:38:49.190
very important to warm up.

00:38:49.190 --> 00:38:51.730
I cannot be more
emphasis on warm-ups.

00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:58.510
Never get into a regime
or an exercise routine

00:38:58.510 --> 00:39:00.280
without a warm-up.

00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:04.540
So you just look to
your right first.

00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:11.870
Center, slowly, to the left.

00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:18.970
Center, look straight up.

00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:26.680
Try and go as behind as you can.

00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:28.960
Stretch your neck.

00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:30.760
And you come down the same way.

00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:32.840
Try to touch your
chin to your chest.

00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:42.370
Right in the center,
straight ahead.

00:39:42.370 --> 00:39:43.480
Rotate your neck now.

00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:51.455
Three times.

00:39:54.256 --> 00:39:55.380
Looking towards your right.

00:39:59.690 --> 00:40:02.720
Come to the center.

00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:04.460
Three times on
the opposite side.

00:40:21.850 --> 00:40:27.150
And we go into Tadasana, OK,
where you stand like a tree.

00:40:27.150 --> 00:40:27.730
Hands up.

00:40:32.580 --> 00:40:35.130
Try and touch the skies.

00:40:35.130 --> 00:40:38.152
On your toes.

00:40:38.152 --> 00:40:38.985
Open out your chest.

00:40:41.855 --> 00:40:42.355
Breathe.

00:40:45.330 --> 00:40:46.660
Down.

00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:51.144
Hands on the side, come down.

00:40:51.144 --> 00:40:52.500
We do the same thing again.

00:40:55.710 --> 00:40:58.200
Go into Namaste right on top.

00:40:58.200 --> 00:40:58.700
Stretch.

00:41:02.107 --> 00:41:02.607
Stretch.

00:41:08.835 --> 00:41:09.335
Down.

00:41:11.890 --> 00:41:16.520
Try to touch your fingers
to the ground now.

00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:19.180
Breathe out.

00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:22.120
[EXHALES]

00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:30.050
Breathe in.

00:41:30.050 --> 00:41:30.640
Come up.

00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:34.105
[INHALES]

00:41:34.105 --> 00:41:37.080
[EXHALES]

00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:38.866
Can we do that again?

00:41:38.866 --> 00:41:40.740
And when you do it the
second time, trust me,

00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:43.370
you will go down lower.

00:41:43.370 --> 00:41:44.358
Hands up.

00:41:44.358 --> 00:41:45.762
[INHALES]

00:41:48.110 --> 00:41:48.990
Exhale.

00:41:48.990 --> 00:41:51.870
[EXHALES]

00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:00.090
Inhale.

00:42:00.090 --> 00:42:00.590
Come up.

00:42:00.590 --> 00:42:02.081
[INHALES]

00:42:04.070 --> 00:42:05.705
Hands on the side.

00:42:05.705 --> 00:42:06.205
Come down.

00:42:10.770 --> 00:42:12.446
We do the Surya Namaskar?

00:42:12.446 --> 00:42:13.300
GOPI KALLAYIL: Yeah.

00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:13.510
SHILPA SHETTY KUNDRA: Ready?

00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:13.952
[INAUDIBLE]

00:42:13.952 --> 00:42:15.278
GOPI KALLAYIL: They have
two, three, minutes, and then

00:42:15.278 --> 00:42:16.028
we're out of time.

00:42:16.028 --> 00:42:17.610
SHILPA SHETTY
KUNDRA: Oh, lovely.

00:42:17.610 --> 00:42:19.850
So only I'll be doing
the Surya Namaskar then.

00:42:19.850 --> 00:42:21.350
GOPI KALLAYIL: We'll
do it together.

00:42:21.350 --> 00:42:23.420
SHILPA SHETTY KUNDRA: Come,
let's do it together then.

00:42:23.420 --> 00:42:23.720
Yeah?

00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:24.511
GOPI KALLAYIL: Yes.

00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:29.010
SHILPA SHETTY KUNDRA: Make sure
that the breathing technique

00:42:29.010 --> 00:42:29.509
is right.

00:42:29.509 --> 00:42:32.340
So with every asana, breathe in.

00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:37.670
Breathe out.

00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:38.495
One leg behind.

00:42:43.620 --> 00:42:48.250
Chest, butt up, chest
to the floor first.

00:42:48.250 --> 00:42:50.244
And knees on the floor.

00:42:53.140 --> 00:42:55.360
Bhujangasana.

00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:57.400
Now you get into a Downward Dog.

00:42:57.400 --> 00:42:59.455
Make sure that the
heels touch the ground.

00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:06.920
Try to go towards your navel.

00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:08.370
One leg in front.

00:43:12.987 --> 00:43:13.570
Then the next.

00:43:17.170 --> 00:43:20.790
Come up slowly.

00:43:20.790 --> 00:43:21.390
Hands up.

00:43:24.290 --> 00:43:25.020
Into Namaste.

00:43:27.590 --> 00:43:29.470
How did that make you feel?

00:43:29.470 --> 00:43:30.160
Awesome, right?

00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:32.241
Let's do that now in one go.

00:43:32.241 --> 00:43:32.740
Yeah?

00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:33.970
You got the technique.

00:43:33.970 --> 00:43:36.800
Ready?

00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:38.400
Hands up.

00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:40.506
Bend backwards.

00:43:40.506 --> 00:43:41.005
Down.

00:43:46.980 --> 00:43:47.735
Butt up.

00:43:47.735 --> 00:43:49.550
Only knees touch the floor.

00:43:55.390 --> 00:43:56.065
Downward Dog.

00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:12.330
Let's do three of these.

00:44:12.330 --> 00:44:15.000
One more, OK?

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.510
Hands up.

00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:18.010
Down.

00:44:40.270 --> 00:44:42.820
That's fantastic.

00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:45.910
Make sure when you go
down, that position,

00:44:45.910 --> 00:44:48.480
I feel most people do it wrong.

00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:52.870
When you go down,
when you are here,

00:44:52.870 --> 00:44:54.970
make sure you go down like this.

00:44:54.970 --> 00:44:57.890
This is the right way to do it.

00:44:57.890 --> 00:45:01.470
Most people do this.

00:45:01.470 --> 00:45:03.040
That's not the right way.

00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:08.480
So only your-- this
is the way to do it.

00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:10.280
Then you come up.

00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:11.960
And then you go do this.

00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:17.900
In Downward Dog, try and always
concentrate and go backwards.

00:45:21.830 --> 00:45:22.840
I just showed it to you.

00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:27.830
When you guys do it, you
need to get this right.

00:45:27.830 --> 00:45:28.820
OK?

00:45:28.820 --> 00:45:31.321
We'll just do one more asana.

00:45:31.321 --> 00:45:35.060
We do the Virabhadrasana,
which is my favorite asana.

00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:37.311
It's great for the legs.

00:45:37.311 --> 00:45:37.810
OK?

00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:45.900
Feet hip width apart.

00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:47.360
Yeah?

00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:49.100
Lovely.

00:45:49.100 --> 00:45:50.570
Now, you turn one leg.

00:45:55.450 --> 00:45:56.440
Hands on the side.

00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:00.801
Hands on top.

00:46:00.801 --> 00:46:01.300
Bend.

00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:08.550
Breathe.

00:46:08.550 --> 00:46:11.960
You should feel the tension in
your glutes, on your thighs.

00:46:16.700 --> 00:46:17.542
Come up.

00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:21.500
Turn to the other side.

00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:37.090
Come up.

00:46:37.090 --> 00:46:38.690
Center.

00:46:38.690 --> 00:46:39.450
Hands on the side.

00:46:44.070 --> 00:46:46.120
Yay!

00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:46.810
That felt great.

00:46:46.810 --> 00:46:47.851
GOPI KALLAYIL: Beautiful.

00:46:47.851 --> 00:46:48.430
Thank you.

00:46:48.430 --> 00:46:49.763
SHILPA SHETTY KUNDRA: Thank you.

00:46:49.763 --> 00:46:52.408
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:52.908 --> 00:46:55.390
Thank you.

00:46:55.390 --> 00:46:56.131
Thank you.

00:46:56.131 --> 00:46:56.630
Thank you.

00:46:56.630 --> 00:46:57.990
GOPI KALLAYIL: With
that, thank you, Shilpa,

00:46:57.990 --> 00:46:59.140
for a wonderful class.

00:46:59.140 --> 00:46:59.420
SHILPA SHETTY KUNDRA: Thank you.

00:46:59.420 --> 00:47:00.220
GOPI KALLAYIL:
And namaste again.

00:47:00.220 --> 00:47:00.720
Thank you.

00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:03.350
SHILPA SHETTY KUNDRA:
Thank you so much.
