00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.740
of he could not carry a decent
conversation and yet here he was

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750
conversation and yet here he was
 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.630

think he had Asperger's syndrome

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479
think he had Asperger's syndrome
 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.690
think he had Asperger's syndrome
now Asperger's syndrome is a mild form

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700
now Asperger's syndrome is a mild form
 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.020
now Asperger's syndrome is a mild form
of autism and in autism we have what I

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030
of autism and in autism we have what I
 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.960

Manhattan see the entire New York Harbor

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310
Manhattan see the entire New York Harbor
 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.270
Manhattan see the entire New York Harbor
and then from memory sketched the entire

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280
and then from memory sketched the entire
 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.569
and then from memory sketched the entire
harbor in fact if you want to see it go

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579
harbor in fact if you want to see it go
 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.969

to JFK Airport in New York City and you

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979
to JFK Airport in New York City and you
 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.830
to JFK Airport in New York City and you
will see it as you enter the

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840
will see it as you enter the
 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.499
will see it as you enter the
international terminal so what is it

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509
international terminal so what is it
 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.899
international terminal so what is it
about these people well first of all a

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909
about these people well first of all a

and so what is it about their brains

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879
and so what is it about their brains
 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.640
and so what is it about their brains
well Einstein

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650
well Einstein
 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.850
well Einstein

he just realized that he was sitting

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720
he just realized that he was sitting
 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.929
he just realized that he was sitting
next to something historic took the

00:02:29.929 --> 00:02:29.939
next to something historic took the
 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:31.429
next to something historic took the
brain took it home with him

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:31.439
brain took it home with him
 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:33.860
brain took it home with him
and it was sitting in a jar in his home

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870
and it was sitting in a jar in his home
 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.679
and it was sitting in a jar in his home
for decades he even drove across the

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:36.689
for decades he even drove across the
 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:38.929
for decades he even drove across the
country with the jar inside his trunk

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:38.939
country with the jar inside his trunk
 

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:42.559

and there's even a TV special where you

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569
and there's even a TV special where you
 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:45.410
and there's even a TV special where you
can actually see the cut-up brain of

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420
can actually see the cut-up brain of
 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.199
can actually see the cut-up brain of
Albert Einstein and you realize first of

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209
Albert Einstein and you realize first of
 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.089
Albert Einstein and you realize first of
all the brain is a little bit different

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099
all the brain is a little bit different
 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:52.369
all the brain is a little bit different
you can't tell by looking at it that is

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:52.379
you can't tell by looking at it that is
 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:54.680
you can't tell by looking at it that is
so remarkably different but you realize

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690
so remarkably different but you realize
 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.539
so remarkably different but you realize
that the connections between the

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549
that the connections between the
 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:58.879
that the connections between the
prefrontal cortex and the parietal lobe

00:02:58.879 --> 00:02:58.889
prefrontal cortex and the parietal lobe
 

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:02.179
prefrontal cortex and the parietal lobe
a connection that is accentuated in

00:03:02.179 --> 00:03:02.189
a connection that is accentuated in
 

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:04.210
a connection that is accentuated in
people that do abstract reasoning is

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220
people that do abstract reasoning is
 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.800
people that do abstract reasoning is
thickened so there definitely is a

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810
thickened so there definitely is a
 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.440
thickened so there definitely is a
difference in the brain of Einstein but

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450
difference in the brain of Einstein but
 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.750
difference in the brain of Einstein but
the question is did it make iron Stein

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760
the question is did it make iron Stein
 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.559
the question is did it make iron Stein
or did Einstein make this change of the

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569
or did Einstein make this change of the
 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:18.619
or did Einstein make this change of the
brain are champions born or are they

people who exercise mental abilities

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060
people who exercise mental abilities
 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.390
people who exercise mental abilities
mathematical abilities they can thicken

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400
mathematical abilities they can thicken
 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.890
mathematical abilities they can thicken
that product that part of the brain

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900
that product that part of the brain
 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.289
that product that part of the brain
themselves so we know that people who do

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299
themselves so we know that people who do

well in mathematics brain scans clearly

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:32.669
well in mathematics brain scans clearly
 

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:33.979
well in mathematics brain scans clearly
show that their brains are slightly

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989
show that their brains are slightly
 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:37.369
show that their brains are slightly
different from the average brain so in

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:37.379
different from the average brain so in
 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:40.189
different from the average brain so in
conclusion we're still children with

don't go home and bang yourself on the

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:46.109
don't go home and bang yourself on the
 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:48.619
don't go home and bang yourself on the

left temporal lobe we don't know how it
 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:51.080
left temporal lobe we don't know how it
works we just know that in a tiny

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090
