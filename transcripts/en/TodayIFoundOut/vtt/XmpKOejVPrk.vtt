00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.570
Mallice in Dallas - How two Major Companies
Avoided Court By Settling a Dispute the Old

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.009
Fashion Way

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:26.789
David vs. Goliath. Burr vs. Hamilton. Ali
vs. Frazier. These fights have captured the

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.940
public’s imagination like few others. On
March 20, 1992, another battle entered this

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.829
conversation. Herwald vs. Kelleher. Okay,
so most likely, you probably don’t have

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:43.739
any clue who Kurt Herwald and Herb Kelleher
are and why they decided to match up against

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.930
one another, but you soon will.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:54.830
Prior to 1978, the airline industry was completely
regulated by the government. As in, if a seat

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:59.390
on a flight from Washington DC to New York
City was a hundred dollars on United, it would

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.619
be hundred dollars on Continental and American
as well. Prices were the same for every airline

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.130
due to federal regulations, as dictated by
the Civil Aeronautics Board, because it was

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.740
considered interstate commerce. That is unless
the airline only flew within one state. That

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.950
was the thinking behind Texas businessman
Rollin King’s creation of Air Southwest.

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.470
In 1968, King saw a gap in the airline market.
Texas was a big state- bigger than the UK,

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.500
the Netherlands, Austria, and Italy combined-
and it was rather time-consuming to drive

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.680
between cities. So, why not create an airline
that would fly passengers between cities?

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.300
Legend has it that he conceived the idea on
a cocktail napkin in San Antonio, but King

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.770
later admitted this wasn’t quite true, but
made for a great story.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.010
Since the airline only would operate within
one state, their prices wouldn’t be regulated.

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.909
They could charge whatever they liked – including
drastically lower fares. King, knowing he

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:57.409
would need help to get this idea, literally
and figuratively, off the ground, approached

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:02.500
his lawyer, Herb Kelleher. The two Texans
went into business together, creating Air

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.380
Southwest.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.460
As one would imagine, the rest of the industry
did not take too kindly to a rogue airline

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.150
trying to circumvent the rules, so did what
most companies do in this situation, sicced

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.090
their lawyers on the upstart. Texas International,
Barniff, and Continental were among the airlines

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.200
that fought Southwest. After three years of
litigation, the Texas Supreme Court finally

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.150
upheld Southwest’s right to fly in Texas.
When the US Supreme Court decided to withhold

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.120
comment, it was a done deal. They changed
their name to Southwest Airlines and on June

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.900
18, 1971, Southwest began service to Dallas,
San Antonio, and Houston.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.250
From the beginning, Southwest Airlines, led
by King and Kelleher, fostered it’s reputation

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.200
as a fun and zany airline. Their lower prices
helped with this. So did the (all-female)

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.010
flight attendants wearing bright orange shorts
and go-go boots.

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:54.040
With the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978,
the airline industry deregulated and Southwest

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.630
began flying to places outside of Texas, with
New Orleans being the first in December of

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.420
1978.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.680
Southwest Airlines had always used catchy,
whimsical advertising and slogans to promote

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.090
their brand. “Love is Still Our Field”
was their first slogan, premiering in 1972.

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.800
(Love Field in Dallas was, and still is, the
location of Southwest corporate headquarters.)

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.930
Then, came “Somebody Up There Loves You”
and “THE Low Fare Airline.”

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:25.930
On October 22, 1990, Southwest introduced
a new slogan in Phoenix, “Just Plane Smart.”

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.280
They used that slogan for about 15 months
until they got a call from Stevens Aviation

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.010
in Greenville, South Carolina. Apparently,
they had been using the slogan “Plane Smart”

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.349
prior to Southwest.

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:40.010
Instead of spending hundreds of thousands
of dollars on legal fees and letting the courts

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:45.160
decide the matter, Stevens Aviation chairman
Kurt Herwald came up (along with executive

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.080
vice-president Stephen Townes) with an idea.
They challenged the CEO of Southwest, Herb

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.760
Kelleher, to an arm wrestling match for the
rights to the slogan “Plane Smart.”

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.430
Herwald knew Southwest’s propensity for
doing things outside of the box, plus he thought

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.470
he publicity for the two companies would be
far better in the long run than fighting via

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.900
the courts for a slogan. Kelleher excitedly
accepted.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.540
“Malice in Dallas” was to be held on March
20, 1992 at the famed wrestling forum, the

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.669
Dallas Sportatrium in downtown Dallas. This
quite obviously was a home game for Kelleher

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:22.340
and Southwest, with their headquarters mere
miles away. But Herwald was fine with it-

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.289
anything for publicity.

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:28.340
Besides losing rights to the slogan, the loser
of each round (it was going to be a best of

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:33.990
three competition) would have to donate $5,000
to the Muscular Dystrophy Association or Ronald

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.150
McDonald House of Cleveland.

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.100
The days leading up to the match-up, both
companies heavily promoted it. Customers and

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.229
well-wishers sent items to Kelleher that they
thought would help him win, including a box

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:48.970
of Wheaties, a can of spinach, a bottle of
Wild Turkey, and “anabolic steroids from

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.000
Mexico.”

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.830
Both men showed up to the ring at nine am
on Friday, March 20th prepared to fight. They

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:59.130
also made a spectacle out it. Herb Kelleher
arrived in a bus with cheerleaders wearing

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:04.160
a white satin robe. Kurt Herwald, when introduced,
ran from the tunnel in a red robe with boos

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.750
reigning down from the pro-Southwest crowd.

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:11.030
After Kelleher arrived in the ring to the
“Rocky” theme song and pre-match tussling

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.990
between the two corners died down, the competition
began.

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:19.080
Immediately, Kelleher called in a “replacement”
due to his “injured arm” that he suffered

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:24.540
while saving a child on his way to the arena.
That replacement was J.R. Jones, the 1986

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:29.810
Texas arm wrestling champion. Jones and Southwest
Airlines easily won the first around.

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:34.020
The second round, Herwald brought in a “ringer”
as well, one of his employees – “Killer”

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:39.210
Annette Coats. She faced off with Kelleher,
even though his arm still “hurt.” Coats

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.840
defeated him in a manner of seconds.

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:46.139
Now with theatrics out of the way, the real
match began. The third round was perfectly

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:50.259
set-up with a winner-take-all between the
two faces of their companies. Herwald, in

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:54.860
a red polo shirt, and Kelleher, with a cigarette
hanging out of his mouth, locked arms in a

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:57.639
dead heat for a solid 35 seconds.

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:02.250
Finally, Herwald pinned Kelleher’s arm for
the win. Boos erupted from the crowd in Dallas,

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:07.430
but Herwald won fair and square, meaning Stevens
Aviation got to keep the slogan. But Kurt

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:12.020
Herwald decided to do things a bit different
one more time. He allowed Southwest to use

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:16.550
the slogan too as a show of good sportsmanship
and for Southwest’s willingness to accept

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.550
such a crazy proposal in the first place when
so many other companies would have simply

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:21.789
gone to court.

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:25.810
After the match-up, both heads of the companies
agreed that determining the dispute this way

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:30.490
was a fantastic idea for publicity, their
bottom line, and a way to show the personalities

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:32.440
of their companies. Said Herwald,

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:37.009
There’s too much litigation in business
today and not enough leadership. We need more

00:06:37.009 --> 00:06:41.509
guys like Herb Kelleher who are willing to
say we don’t need to go to court all the

00:06:41.509 --> 00:06:42.000
time.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.160
Kelleher told the New York Times that if Stevens
and Southwest went to court about this, it

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:52.789
would have cost Southwest $500,000 and a few
years to decide. He also admitted that, “Frankly,

00:06:52.789 --> 00:06:56.460
Stevens had been using ‘Plane Smart’ in
their ads longer. We didn’t know about it

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:00.490
but they had it first. So we might well have
lost the case on top of all that money, effort,

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:01.910
and time spent on it.”

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:04.979
Both companies believe that the “Malice
in Dallas” had much to do with their rise

00:07:04.979 --> 00:07:09.740
in profits directly after. Stevens Aviation,
three years later, was making nearly four

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:15.380
times as much as it did in 1992. Ed Stewart,
manager of public relations for Southwest,

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:20.240
estimated it at least generated six million
dollars in publicity, and a mere year later

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:26.039
Southwest’s stock prices had doubled. And
to top it all, $15,000 got donated to charity

00:07:26.039 --> 00:07:31.130
between the three rounds. Even the President
of the United States took notice. George H.W.

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:48.529
Bush sent a congratulatory letter to both
participants calling it a “win-win.”
