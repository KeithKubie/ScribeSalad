00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.710
Go ahead and come on around.

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:03.730
Okay.

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:04.760
Yeah.

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.540
You will probably need to wear them just slightly
higher than you are used to wearing them,

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.750
because men wore stuff at their waist.

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:17.000
Back in the day they wore them at their waist.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:31.860
Okay, she's going to have to decide if she
wants to shorten those.

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:37.330
Mm okay. I shortened the waist.  I think we're kind of in the ballpark.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.710
Do we want to shorten it?

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.211
When he bends his knee, he actually needs
that girth.

00:00:43.211 --> 00:00:47.450
–Go ahead and bend your knees for us please.

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.910
Yeah, he needs the girth definitely.

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.040
Yeah, with his shoes on it's 39.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.070
–Is this right? is this where it should
be?

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.789
–The objective of this project is really
to recreate this famous tracksuit that Bruce

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:09.670
Lee wore in the 1971 TV show, Longstreet.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:16.159
Thankfully, we have body measurements from
him because he was such a meticulous documenter

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:18.810
of his own physical progress.

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.729
We had to then find a fit model, who was as
close to Bruce Lee's measurements as possible,

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.219
which was not that easy of a feat.

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:28.200
–Okay, so we know this is coming in.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.350
What about on his forearm?

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:30.909
I think we're okay on that forearm.

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:31.909
–I do, too.

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:32.909
–Alright, cool.

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.619
–I want to do an extended chest here again,
you guys.

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:36.619
Yeah, 39.

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:37.619
–Boom.

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:38.619
–Okay, good.

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.560
Very good.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.619
The fabric took more work than just about
anything I would say.

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:51.599
Because this was the 70s, or late 60s, the
fabric that they would use then, we can't

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:53.090
get anymore.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.669
This is a representative, a representation
of a knit fabric, it's probably a bit heavier

00:01:58.669 --> 00:02:04.799
than those were at that time, it's got a little
bit different stretch, but it reads like this.

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:05.799
And that's the whole thing.

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:09.759
Making it look so that it reads, when the
person looks at it, "Oh, that's that burgundy

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:10.759
tracksuit."

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:16.260
And that was the whole beginning, too, of
all the Adidas and Reebok, all those companies

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.150
getting going with their stripes and you know,
being athletic.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.879
So as long as it reads to your eye when you
see it that that's what this is, then we've

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:25.810
done our job.

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.480
–Maria?

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:39.150
You cut this elastic at 29, right?

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:54.159
Okay, we need to take about two inches off.

00:02:54.159 --> 00:03:02.620
In a short amount of time, that man died when
he was 32, he opened so many doors for Asian

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:09.010
people and introduced martial arts to the
United States and the world really.

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:14.000
He brought it out of its closed community
and gave it to the world.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.879
He did so much with so little.

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:22.849
And when you see him on the screen, he is
just fluid motion and action.

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:25.750
He's larger than life.

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.060
Plus, he's just cool.

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:34.609
Bruce Lee is just cool.

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:38.329
Why is this tracksuit different from every
other tracksuit known to man?

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:42.920
The most significant thing is the stirrup
and the zipper on the side.

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.650
The stirrup definitely, because he's doing
so much action.

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.010
That'll hold the pant in place.

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.069
And the fact that he's got the zipper on the
side means he can get in and out of it quickly.

00:03:54.069 --> 00:04:00.790
So those little details are specific to his
needs as an actor and as an artist.

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.769
That's what makes it a Bruce Lee tracksuit.

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:11.859
I got reference photos, I got some rudimentary
measurements, I had sample garments that I

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:16.610
could get more information off from, and I
was given fabric and trim.

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:18.920
That was the package I got.

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.770
This is a shirt that was most likely custom
made for Bruce Lee.

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:28.130
It has his initials and it's got Lee stamped
in the back.

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:32.860
But more importantly, there are little minute
details on this shirt that say to me that

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.860
this was custom made by someone.

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.810
This wasn't manufactured in a facility.

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.550
We don't really think about it because he's
up on the big screen, so what you're seeing

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:46.840
is a huge blown up image, plus his own personality
and charisma made him seem larger than life.

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.170
But in real life, he's actually a tiny guy.

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:54.700
He's only 5' 7", I'm 5' 6" - so he was probably
about an inch taller than me and he was very

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:55.700
slight.

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:03.320
His build was very muscular, he has very rounded
shoulders, he has very...he's kind of a V-shape,

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.730
his rib cage and his shoulders are large compared
to his very tiny waist.

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:09.920
His waist is 29".

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:18.480
We also were given this pair of Levi's Strauss,
so these are definitely manufactured, the

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:19.570
label is still in them.

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:27.160
But like Sharon was saying, they were probably
tailored. And we also got this fine pair of

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.330
pants.

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:34.150
Now this is also manufactured, this was one
of his favorite pairs of pants and this is

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:37.420
a fine piece of 70s, 70s clothing here.

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:44.160
Now, I didn't use these to make a pattern
because it has very specialized seams.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:49.940
It's got saddleback seams, it's got seams
cutting here, the legs are really wide.

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:54.370
This isn't a good garment for me to tear apart
to make a tracksuit.

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:59.370
So I went with the Levi's, which were, its
got an inseam and an outseam.

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:04.210
The leg is fairly tapered, so I get a better
idea of what his leg is like, so that's what

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:05.210
I used.

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:08.220
The reference images, that's the blueprint.

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:11.330
That tells me what I'm making.

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:15.120
This is a good reference photo for the overall
design.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:23.110
It shows me front, it gives me a three-quarter
view so I can see this detail in the sleeve.

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:25.220
It's a good starting point.

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:32.180
This one's good because it gives me collar
front detail, and I can also see just very

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:35.200
faintly that there's a raglan sleeve line.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:39.320
This is another good one, I can definitely
see my raglan sleeve line here.

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:41.420
I can get an idea of the length of the collar.

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:44.990
I've got a good shot at the cuff.

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:51.970
This is an excellent reference photo because
it shows me that he has a zipper on the side.

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:55.660
It also shows me that he's got stirrups that
he's wearing.

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:59.720
I get a good indication of what length the
cuff would be.

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:03.400
This is an even better photo because I can
clearly see the zipper pulled here.

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:11.360
It tells me the stirrup is forward of the
zipper, and I can get a general idea of how

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.800
wide those stripes are and what the space
between the stripes is.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:19.520
We love our Bruce Lee.

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.560
We love our mannequins.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:26.660
Okay.
