00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.730
Now let's take a look
at Android security.

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.160
Here's an overview of the architecture
of Android which is based on Linux.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.010
Android is implemented in the form
of a software stack architecture

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.440
consisting of a Linux kernel,
a runtime environment and

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:23.050
corresponding libraries, an application
framework and a set of applications.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.320
At the lowest level is the Linux Kernel.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.480
It provides a level of abstraction
within device hardware and

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.640
the upper layers of
the Android software stack.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.400
Each application running on the Android
device runs its own instance

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.992
of the Dalvik virtual machine.

00:00:39.992 --> 00:00:44.840
After written in Java,
and compiled to bytecode

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.678
of the Java virtual machine, which is
then translated to Dalvik bytecode.

00:00:49.678 --> 00:00:55.030
The Dalvik excutable format is very
compact and it is designed for

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.400
systems such as smart phones that
are constrained in terms of memory and

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.860
processor speed.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:07.030
By using Dalvik, Android can
achieve performance and efficiency.

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.430
The Android core libraries
are Java based libraries for

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.390
application development.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.710
For example, for
web browsing, data access and

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.940
database queries,
graphics rendering, and so on.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.950
The Android call libraries
do not actually perform

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.020
much of the actual work.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.282
And are in fact, essentially Java
wrappers around a set of C and

00:01:30.282 --> 00:01:32.377
C++ based libraries.

00:01:32.377 --> 00:01:39.046
These C and C++ libraries are included
to fulfill a wide range of functions,

00:01:39.046 --> 00:01:45.860
including 2D or 3D graphics rendering,
secure second layer, etc.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.210
The application framework is a set
of services that collectively,

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.730
from the environment,
for Android apps to run.

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.210
The application framework allows
apps to be constructed using usable,

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.500
interchangeable, and
replaceable components.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.860
Furthermore, an app can publish
its capabilities along with any

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:12.580
corresponding data, so that they can
be found and reused by other apps.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.040
At the top of the Android
software stack are the apps.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.560
These include apps that come
with the device such as home,

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.000
contacts, and phone and browser.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.160
A lot of third party apps
that the user has downloaded

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.640
after he purchases the device.
