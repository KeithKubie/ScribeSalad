00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.394
 

00:00:00.394 --> 00:00:01.810
What I want to do
in this video is

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:04.740
explore what happens when we
get to really, really, really

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:05.660
small scales.

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:07.290
And before we even
think about it,

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.160
I want to familiarize
ourselves with the units here.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.160
So, we're all familiar with
what a meter looks like.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.360
The average adult male is
a little under two meters.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.155
If you were to divide a
meter into 1,000 units,

00:00:21.155 --> 00:00:22.280
you would get a millimeter.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.446
And I think we probably
know what a millimeter is.

00:00:24.446 --> 00:00:26.070
If you've ever looked
at a meter stick,

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.650
it's the smallest measurement
on that meter stick.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.170
So it's already pretty
hard to look at.

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.440
Now, if you were to divide
each of those millimeters

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.745
into 1,000 sections,
you'd get a micrometer.

00:00:37.745 --> 00:00:39.495
Or another way to think
about a micrometer

00:00:39.495 --> 00:00:42.880
is, it's one
millionth of a meter.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.550
So this is kind of
beyond what we're

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.710
capable of really perceiving.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.750
If you were to take each
of those micrometers

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.230
and divide them
into 1,000 sections,

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:52.900
you would get a nanometer.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.600
So now we're at one
billionth of a meter.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.490
You divide that by 1,000,
you get a picometer.

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:06.390
So a picometer is 1,000
billionth of a meter,

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.660
or you could say a
trillionth of a meter.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.080
You divide one of
those by 1,000,

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.760
and you would get a femtometer.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.904
So these are unimaginably
small things.

00:01:15.904 --> 00:01:17.570
Now once you're
familiar with the units,

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.890
let's explore what
types of things

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.600
we can expect to find at
these different scales.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.830
And I'll start over here.

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.900
And I've written them
on the left as well,

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.350
but it's more compelling
when you see the pictures.

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.130
We'll start over
here with the bee.

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.530
And I've arbitrarily picked
something of this scale.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.010
There's many, many, many,
almost an infinite number

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.260
of things I could have
picked at this scale.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.220
But the average bee is
about two centimeters long.

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.300
This bee right over here.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.410
It's about, give or take, it's
about one hundredth the length

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.720
of the average
adult human being.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.137
But once again,
the honey bee not

00:01:53.137 --> 00:01:54.970
too exciting, although
it is pretty exciting

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.570
to see it zoomed in like this.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.720
But a honey bee is something
that we can relate to.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.960
We've all seen honey bees.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.280
Now, what I want
to do is zoom in,

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.680
or look at something that's 50
times smaller than a honey bee.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.490
So something that if I
were to show how big it

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.670
is relative to this honey
bee, it would look something

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:16.460
like this.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:17.940
I'm doing it very rough.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.190
And that is a dust mite.

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.750
And this right here, these are
both pictures of dust mites.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.430
Now dust mites look like these
strange and alien creatures,

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.280
but what's amazing about them
is that they are everywhere.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.320
They're all around us.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.780
You probably have many of them
lying on your skin or wherever

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.310
right now, which is
kind of a creepy idea.

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:40.940
But we're talking
about scale here,

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.895
and the average
dust mite-- so we

00:02:44.895 --> 00:02:47.120
were talking about
centimeters before,

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.450
now we'll talk about
millimeters-- the average dust

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.830
mite is less than
1/2 of a millimeter.

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.380
Or if you want to
talk in micrometers,

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.630
it's about 400 micrometers long.

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.525
So this length right over
here is about 400 micrometers,

00:03:03.525 --> 00:03:07.469
so about 1/50th the length--
remember, this huge thing

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:09.510
that I'm showing right
here, this is a honey bee.

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.200
It's about 1/50th of the
length of the honey bee.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.970
Or maybe to put
it in other terms

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.290
that you might be
familiar with, this

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.212
is a zoomed-in
picture of human hair.

00:03:19.212 --> 00:03:21.670
And you might say, oh my god,
this person has horrible hair,

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:22.470
but no.

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.280
If you looked at your own hair
under an electron microscope,

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.870
you'd be lucky if
it looked this good.

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.600
This person, actually I've seen
pictures of more damaged hair

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:31.100
than this.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.020
This is probably smooth
and silky hair right here.

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.380
But the diameter of human
hair, and this is on average,

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.390
it depends on whose hair
you're talking about,

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.910
the diameter of human
hair is about 100--

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.150
you can't see it when
I write in that color.

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.160
It's about 100
micrometers thick.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.460
That's the diameter.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:57.330
So it's about a fourth
the length of a dust mite.

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.370
Or if I were to draw some human
hair relative to this honey

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.850
bee, it would look
something like this.

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:08.390
It would be about-- and I'm
drawing the whole hair--

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.070
so its width would be the width
of this thing that I just drew.

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.240
Now remember, we're looking
at a honey bee here.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.610
It looks like some type of
giant, but it is a honeybee.

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:19.200
Let's zoom in even more.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.980
So, we started
with the honey bee.

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.220
We zoomed in by 50
to get the dust mite.

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.450
We zoomed in by
another factor of 4

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.350
to get the width of human hair.

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.050
If we zoom in, we're in
the micrometer range now.

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.900
If we zoom in by another,
roughly, another factor of 10,

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.590
we get to the scale of cells.

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.890
And this right here
is a red blood cell.

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:43.430
I think this is a white
blood cell right over here.

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.920
About 6 to 8 micrometers.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.210
So once again, if I
were to draw a cell

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.080
relative to this human
hair, it would probably

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.970
look something like this.

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.050
Something on a similar
scale that we can still

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.630
kind of relate to, is
the width of spider silk.

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.450
It's about 3 to 8 micrometers.

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:07.390
So if I were to draw some
spider silk on the same diagram,

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:10.400
it would look
something like this.

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.190
This is an actual
image of spider silk.

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.690
So, once again, something
that we can kind of perceive.

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.700
You can bump into it, you
can touch spider silk,

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.237
you can see it if the sun
is reflecting just right,

00:05:19.237 --> 00:05:21.070
or if it has a little
bit of moisture on it.

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.870
But it's about the thinnest
thing that humans can perceive.

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:28.440
And this is in the ones
of micrometer range.

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.220
At that same range,
you start to have

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.220
some of your larger bacteria.

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.260
Bacteria can be
anywhere from-- and I'm

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:38.140
speaking very roughly--
1 to 10 micrometers.

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:41.160
So in general, they're
smaller than cells.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.610
Most bacteria are
smaller than most cells.

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:47.022
And just to figure out
where we sit on our scale,

00:05:47.022 --> 00:05:48.864
I have it over here.

00:05:48.864 --> 00:05:50.280
So we started off--
I want to keep

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.220
reminding ourselves-- humans.

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.630
You divide by 100,
you get to the bee.

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:57.870
So each of these slashes
right here are dividing by 10.

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:59.710
So this is divide by 10.

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:02.990
Divide by 10 again, you're
divided in size by 100.

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:06.160
Divide by 10 again,
you get to millimeter.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:07.510
You've divided by 1,000.

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:09.930
Divide by 10 again,
you are doing

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.520
tenths of millimeters,
which is about the size

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:13.740
of the human hair.

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:17.270
You divide again by 10, you're
going to tens of micrometers.

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:20.080
By 10 again, you get into
the micrometer range.

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.587
So now we're talking about
human hair-- not human hair.

00:06:24.587 --> 00:06:25.670
Human hair we did up here.

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:26.810
We're talking about cells.

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:30.420
We're talking about bacteria.

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:32.920
Now things are going
to get really crazy.

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:36.160
Now they're going to get
really, really, really crazy.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.900
This was in the ones
of micrometer range.

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.671
Now we're going to start getting
into the hundreds of nanometer

00:06:41.671 --> 00:06:42.170
range.

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:44.370
And just to get a
sense of things--

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:49.270
So remember, a nanometer is
a thousandth of a micrometer,

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:56.590
or 100 nanometers would be
a tenth of a micrometer.

00:06:56.590 --> 00:07:00.660
And this picture right here,
this big enormous planet

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:04.190
or asteroid looking thing,
this is a white blood cell.

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:08.090
 

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:10.682
The enormous blue
thing in this picture.

00:07:10.682 --> 00:07:13.140
And so if I were to zoom out,
it would might look something

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:14.710
like this right over here.

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:16.890
But what's really fascinating
about this picture

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:19.570
for multiple reasons are
these little green things

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:23.570
that are emerging after
essentially reproducing,

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:27.600
emerging from the surface
of this white blood cell.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:30.885
And these things right here,
these are AIDS viruses.

00:07:30.885 --> 00:07:37.210
 

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:41.960
So now if we zoom in roughly
another factor of, you know,

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:46.020
about 100 to 1,000 from
the size of a cell,

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:49.210
you are now getting to
the size of a virus.

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:52.560
And all of the genetic material
necessary to replicate that

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:55.900
virus is right inside each
of these little capsids.

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:59.440
It's right inside each of
these little green containers.

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:01.810
So now, going back
to our scale--

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:04.570
let me get my scale
right over here--

00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:07.200
we are down to the
scale of a virus.

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:10.440
So we're in the hundreds
of nanometer range.

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:12.590
If we divide by 10
and then divide by 10,

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:14.350
you get to the nanometer range.

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:16.640
And right in the ones
of nanometer range,

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:22.020
you get to the width of the
double helix of a DNA molecule.

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:24.550
So this right here is,
if you were to zoom in,

00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:26.890
and this is an artist's
depiction of it, obviously.

00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:30.850
Well, this is not a picture,
so to speak, of a DNA molecule.

00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:35.245
But the width of this double
helix is about 2 nanometers.

00:08:35.245 --> 00:08:36.620
Or another way to
think about it,

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:40.616
about 1/60th the diameter of
one of these viral capsids.

00:08:40.616 --> 00:08:42.240
Which it would have
to be, because it's

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:43.740
going to have to
get all wound up

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:47.010
and fit into one of
these viral capsids.

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:49.640
And DNA, just to make it clear,
this is just the width of DNA.

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:52.670
It's much, much, much, much,
much, much, much, much longer.

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:54.880
And we can talk about
that in future videos.

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:57.540
So once again, we're at
a very, very small scale.

00:08:57.540 --> 00:08:59.480
If you want to think of
it in terms of meters,

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:03.510
we're at two
billionths of a meter.

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:06.550
You could put 500
million of these side

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:10.620
by side to get to a meter.

00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:12.400
Or you could even
think of it this way,

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.620
this is two millionths
of a millimeter.

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:17.390
So once again, super small.

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:20.090
You could put these side by
side, one DNA, and another DNA,

00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:24.200
and if you made them touch,
you could put 500,000

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:27.350
next to each other
in a millimeter.

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:30.290
So this is unbelievably
small amount of space.

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:32.840
And now I'll introduce
you to another unit that's

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:35.040
not kind of in the
conventional, you know,

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:36.930
prefix followed by meters.

00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:38.220
And this is an angstrom.

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:41.330
And 10 angstroms
equal one nanometer.

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:45.185
So the width of this
DNA double helix,

00:09:45.185 --> 00:09:49.940
it would be two nanometers
or 20 angstroms.

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:54.260
Now, if we were to
divide again by 10,

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.770
you get to something that's
2 angstroms or 0.2 nanometers

00:09:57.770 --> 00:09:59.530
wide, and that is
a water molecule.

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:02.150
 

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:04.010
Maybe instead of
using red, I should

00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:05.830
have used blue or something.

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:10.050
But this right
here is the oxygen,

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:16.162
and it is bonded to the 2
hydrogens right over here.

00:10:16.162 --> 00:10:17.620
So we're getting,
you know, this is

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:20.030
beyond, frankly, human
perception, I mean.

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:22.870
Or even really, stuff
that we can conceptualize.

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:24.550
Not to even speak
of perception, I

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:26.970
have trouble imagining
how small we're

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:28.460
dealing with right over here.

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:30.160
We're essentially
dealing, remember,

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:35.010
we're dealing with less, 1/5
of a billionth of a meter,

00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:38.039
or 1/5 of a millionth
of a millimeter.

00:10:38.039 --> 00:10:39.580
Something that I
really can't fathom.

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:42.050
But we're going to get
even smaller than that.

00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:45.270
If we were to zoom in on one
of these hydrogen atoms--

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:47.290
and now things start to
get kind of abstract,

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:49.040
and we start dealing
in the quantum realm.

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:51.760
And it's hard to define where
one thing ends and one thing

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:52.280
begins.

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:53.130
And what is real?

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:54.110
And what is not real?

00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:55.410
And all of that silliness.

00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:57.730
But if we try our best to
do it, if we were to zoom in

00:10:57.730 --> 00:11:00.760
and we sort of put some
boundary on a hydrogen atom--

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:03.300
because electrons actually
could jump around anywhere--

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:06.190
but if we set some boundary of
where the electrons are most

00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:10.230
likely to be found, the
diameter of a hydrogen atom

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:13.642
is roughly 1 angstrom.

00:11:13.642 --> 00:11:15.350
Which makes sense from
this diagram, too.

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:19.310
It's about 1/2 of the diameter
of this water molecule.

00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:22.990
What's extra crazy
is one, this atom

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:24.464
is super, super duper small.

00:11:24.464 --> 00:11:25.880
Something that we
can't, you know,

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:30.550
this is one ten
billionth of a meter,

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:32.890
or one ten millionth
of a millimeter.

00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:35.430
So something we really,
really can't fathom.

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:38.549
But what's crazier than that,
is that it's mostly free space.

00:11:38.549 --> 00:11:40.090
We've gotten this
small, we're trying

00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:41.830
to get to these
fundamental units,

00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:44.860
and this thing right here
is mostly free space.

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:46.875
And that's because if
you look at an electron,

00:11:46.875 --> 00:11:49.400
and when we say
radius here, it's

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:51.502
really hard to define
where it starts and ends.

00:11:51.502 --> 00:11:53.710
And you have to do some
things related to the charge.

00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:56.085
And we're not even thinking
about quantum effects and all

00:11:56.085 --> 00:11:56.832
of that.

00:11:56.832 --> 00:12:00.530
An electron has a
radius of 3 times 10

00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:02.540
to the negative 1/5 angstroms.

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:04.510
And the nucleus of
a hydrogen atom,

00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:07.130
which is really just a proton,
has a radius a little bit--

00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:09.830
and you don't even worry
about this number right here.

00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:12.380
The general idea is, it's
the same order of magnitude.

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:15.460
It's about 1/10,000th
of an angstrom.

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:17.740
And just to give a
sense of what it's like,

00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:21.170
if you have the entire, if you
view the entire atomic radius

00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:23.470
to be about an
angstrom, kind of,

00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:26.900
just have a conception
for scale of the atom

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:29.580
and how much free space
there is in an atom,

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:33.140
if we even want to think
what is free space.

00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:36.270
Imagine a nucleus
being maybe a marble

00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:38.270
at the center of a
football stadium,

00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:40.200
of a domed football stadium.

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:44.940
And imagine an electron being a
honey bee just randomly jumping

00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:47.520
around random parts
of that entire volume

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:49.600
inside of that football stadium.

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.729
And obviously, it's
a quantum honey bee,

00:12:51.729 --> 00:12:53.395
so it can jump around
from spot to spot,

00:12:53.395 --> 00:12:54.860
and it's not easy
to predict where

00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:56.651
it's going to go next,
and all of the rest.

00:12:56.651 --> 00:12:58.940
But that will give you
a sense of the scale

00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:02.730
of the electron and the
proton relative to the atom

00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:03.370
as a whole.

00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:04.870
But even more
crazy, it gives you

00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:14.010
a sense for how empty atoms,
and really all matter really is.
