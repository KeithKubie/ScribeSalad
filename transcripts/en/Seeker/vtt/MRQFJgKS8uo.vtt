00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.340
When I was in Middle School, we wandered around
and put tape on the phone, the lockers, the

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.749
toilets, our history teacher -- then we’d
culture the bacteria.

00:00:07.749 --> 00:00:13.450
They made us stop after we accidentally cultured
strep throat.

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.830
Yo, what up?

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:17.830
The space station!

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:18.830
That’s what!

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.220
I’m Trace, thanks for continuing to watch
DNews after that “joke.”

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.980
The problem with those tape experiments is
we always assume it’s toilets that are the

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.130
grossest, but it’s more commonly things
like shared landline phones or door handles!

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.170
If you watch movies about space stations you
probably think of them as futuristic… and

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.210
the future?

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:36.850
Super clean, right?

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.079
The thing is… like anywhere else humans
inhabit: space stations are super gross.

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:45.100
Even after a shower, there are potentially
many billions of bacteria and fungi on your

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.820
skin; there’s no escaping them.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.800
So, when you’re trapped in a canister above
the Earth they exist there too!

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.610
During the 15-year flight of Soviet (then
Russia’s) Mir, cosmonauts would regularly

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.220
clean the surfaces of the space station to
fight the scourge of bacteria and fungi, but

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:07.240
in 1998 U.S. astronauts opened a “rarely-accessed
panel” and found a “large free-floating

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.299
mass of water” the size of a basketball.

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:14.190
Without gravity, moisture had begun to coalesce,
forming spheres.

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.990
The Mir crew then embarked on what must have
been a truly disgusting hunt, and found two

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.450
more globules… and get this, they had color.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.990
Two were brownish, and a third was “cloudy
white.”

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.530
They sucked some up for samples, and found
“amoebas and protozoa,” and “dust mites.”

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.940
Blech.

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.720
Space is a crazy place, it’s not like you
can open the window and air it out.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.000
Whatever lives on you or me, hitches a ride
to what may be bacterial heaven… a PLOS

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.020
One study from November 2016 found bacteria
loooove space.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.490
They’re even better at forming biofilms,
creating higher density populations, and may

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.390
even be more capable of causing disease up
there!

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:59.460
Another study in PeerJ found Bacillus safensis
-- grows 60-percent better in space.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.909
Fun and scary fact: it got it’s name Safensis
after it was found on spacecraft at the Kennedy

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.890
Space Center’s, Spacecraft Assembly Facility
(SAF).

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.729
New species, all thanks to space exploration.

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.950
More recently, in a study of the Japanese
module, Kibo -- that was basically like putting

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.249
tape around my school -- astronauts took samples
from the incubator, an air intake, air diffuser,

00:02:20.249 --> 00:02:21.799
and (bum-bum-bum) a handrail.

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:28.319
Their paper, published in npj Microgravity,
noted that Staphylococcaceae and Enterobacteriaceae

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.549
were the most common on the space station
-- normally they’re found on human palms,

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:36.170
and species of these can cause some nasty
illnesses…

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.319
Salmonella is a type of Enterobacteria, and
in tests done with mice, salmonella flown

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.959
into space killed the mice two days earlier
than regular salmonella.

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:45.959
Wheee!

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.650
The space industry is taking this seriously.

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.909
In this study, they also found species related
to the human stomach, as well as those from

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:55.200
water and land-based ecosystems.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.450
Another study in Microbiome found Actinobacteria
-- important for soil systems on Earth, but

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.059
also a possible cause of skin irritations
and inflammations.

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:06.650
And this is a humans-in-space problem.

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.010
Before it was launched, Kibo was scrubbed
with isopropyl alcohol, and had less than

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.389
200 bacteria per square centimeter, but after
a few years in space, there were 50 times

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:17.389
more!

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:21.510
On Earth, bacteria have to compete with chlorines,
soaps and other naturally-occurring chemicals,

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.129
naturally antibacterial minerals like copper,
other predatory and competitive species, and

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:29.129
of course the never-ending UV blast from the
sun.

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:33.099
In an effort to keep bacteria from taking
over the football-field-sized flying hamster

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:38.699
tubes -- space-bound humans keep very clean
and are tested, and space-bound equipment

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:43.029
is cleaned and sanitized… but as we said,
that’s not always enough.

00:03:43.029 --> 00:03:47.239
The problem with bacteria on space stations,
is that we don’t always know what they are!

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:51.379
Species have to be collected, transported
back to ground, and then DNA sequenced and

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:52.379
analyzed.

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:57.359
NASA is working on something called the LOCAD-PTS,
the Lab-On-a-Chip Application Development–Portable

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:02.519
Test System, which will (hopefully) be able
to test surfaces for pathogens in minutes,

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:04.510
rather than culturing in a lab.

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.680
As we look to asteroids, Mars, or beyond…
we’ll need to figure this out.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.430
If we don’t, we could end up with the nightmare
scenario: a bacteria or fungus that naturally

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.120
lives in (or on) humans, that thrives and
mutates in space, and causes a rapid onset

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.720
illness millions of miles from home.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.770
It sounds like a movie plot, but top scientists
are working making sure we never have to make

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:23.770
that biopic.

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:24.770
Ha!

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:25.770
Biopic!

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.340
We can’t do episodes like this without our
sponsors.

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.689
