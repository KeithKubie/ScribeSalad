I think two years old and my grandma was
 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.500
I think two years old and my grandma was
cleaning the windows at home and I was I

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510
cleaning the windows at home and I was I
 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.480
cleaning the windows at home and I was I
was insisting that that she put numbers

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:32.490

on the put the detergent on windows in
 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.030
on the put the detergent on windows in
the form numbers so I always liked

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040
the form numbers so I always liked
 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.460
the form numbers so I always liked
numbers and patterns and and logic and

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:40.470
numbers and patterns and and logic and
 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.350
numbers and patterns and and logic and
so things are very black-and-white where

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360
so things are very black-and-white where
 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.790
so things are very black-and-white where
there's one right answer and everything

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800
there's one right answer and everything
 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.080
there's one right answer and everything
else is wrong I didn't like so

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090
else is wrong I didn't like so
 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.510
else is wrong I didn't like so
subjective shades a great time question

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520

competitions doing that was very

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040
competitions doing that was very
 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.720
competitions doing that was very
different from doing research

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730
different from doing research
 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.399

mathematics the type of problems that

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:01.409
mathematics the type of problems that
 

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:03.920
mathematics the type of problems that
that you're given in a problem book and

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930
that you're given in a problem book and
 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.630
that you're given in a problem book and
so forth so very can of problems things

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640
so forth so very can of problems things
 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.649
so forth so very can of problems things
you can do in five minutes or ten

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659
you can do in five minutes or ten
 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.140
you can do in five minutes or ten
minutes and they don't prepare you

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150
minutes and they don't prepare you
 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.210
minutes and they don't prepare you
completely for a research problem where

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220
completely for a research problem where
 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.500
completely for a research problem where
where you know you have spent six months

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510
where you know you have spent six months
 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.000
where you know you have spent six months
you have to read the literature talk to

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010

people or try something doesn't work
what if I try it again

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470
what if I try it again
 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.920
what if I try it again
and it's a there's a very different

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930
and it's a there's a very different
 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.899
and it's a there's a very different
experience doing research but I like it

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909
experience doing research but I like it
 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.420
experience doing research but I like it
a lot better actually than and and then

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430
a lot better actually than and and then

a little bit you know you know when I
 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.749
a little bit you know you know when I
was a kid you know just talking numbers

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759
was a kid you know just talking numbers
 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.090

was I was around people who are older

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470
was I was around people who are older
 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.160
was I was around people who are older
than me but had similar backgrounds so

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170
than me but had similar backgrounds so
 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.270
than me but had similar backgrounds so
we were add so the same level

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280
we were add so the same level
 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.650
we were add so the same level
mathematically so you know these people

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660
mathematically so you know these people
 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.750
mathematically so you know these people
five years older maybe but you know

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760
five years older maybe but you know
 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:29.890
five years older maybe but you know
we're both struggling the same homework

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900
we're both struggling the same homework
 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:30.970

assignments we both like to talk about
 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.070
assignments we both like to talk about
various methods and so forth so I felt

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080
various methods and so forth so I felt
 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.470
various methods and so forth so I felt
at home you know so I did miss out on on

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480
at home you know so I did miss out on on
 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.479
at home you know so I did miss out on on
maybe sort of the regular high school

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489
maybe sort of the regular high school
 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:39.460
maybe sort of the regular high school
experience you know sorry I didn't go to

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470
experience you know sorry I didn't go to
 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:40.840
experience you know sorry I didn't go to
too many you know high school social

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850
too many you know high school social
 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.309
too many you know high school social
events and so forth I did a lot of that

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319
events and so forth I did a lot of that
 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.229
events and so forth I did a lot of that
actually 1000 grad school in Princeton

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239
actually 1000 grad school in Princeton
 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.120
actually 1000 grad school in Princeton
you know so I then I hung around people

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130
you know so I then I hung around people
 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.340
you know so I then I hung around people
my own age and you know we yeah then I

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350
my own age and you know we yeah then I
 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.530
my own age and you know we yeah then I
partied and so forth in it so yeah I saw

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540
partied and so forth in it so yeah I saw
 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.440
partied and so forth in it so yeah I saw
her slightly and we organised childhood

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450
her slightly and we organised childhood
 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.990
her slightly and we organised childhood
but it worked out well for me and I have

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000
but it worked out well for me and I have
 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.289
but it worked out well for me and I have
to say Terrance how was competing there

00:02:59.289 --> 00:02:59.299
to say Terrance how was competing there
 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:02.920
to say Terrance how was competing there
and he only got one out of seven let's

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930
and he only got one out of seven let's
 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.720
and he only got one out of seven let's
actually cut cut Terrance to our some

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730
actually cut cut Terrance to our some
 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.800

slack the guy who's like coming close to

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810
slack the guy who's like coming close to
 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.840
slack the guy who's like coming close to
solving the twin prime conjecture it's

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850
solving the twin prime conjecture it's
 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:12.220
solving the twin prime conjecture it's
actually pretty awesome because he was

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230
actually pretty awesome because he was
 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:13.870
actually pretty awesome because he was
only 13 years old he holds the record as

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880
only 13 years old he holds the record as

I think he was giving me a mass problem

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090
I think he was giving me a mass problem
 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.290
I think he was giving me a mass problem
which I did I think I even know what it

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300
which I did I think I even know what it
 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:45.520
which I did I think I even know what it
is because he did send me a postcard

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530
is because he did send me a postcard

he did write me a letter recommendation
 

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:43.600
he did write me a letter recommendation
for 4th for Princeton later on so he did

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:43.610
for 4th for Princeton later on so he did
 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:45.040
for 4th for Princeton later on so he did
hurt my career directly did you ever

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050
hurt my career directly did you ever
 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:46.810

have people you looked up to and thought

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:46.820
have people you looked up to and thought
 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:49.900
have people you looked up to and thought
they were like the top guns not really I

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:49.910
they were like the top guns not really I
 

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:52.000
they were like the top guns not really I
mean you know I would learn about boiler

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:52.010
mean you know I would learn about boiler
 

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:53.530
mean you know I would learn about boiler
and Gauss and Newton it's awful but but

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:53.540
and Gauss and Newton it's awful but but
 

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.240
and Gauss and Newton it's awful but but
these were largely just names yeah I

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:55.250
these were largely just names yeah I
 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.100
these were largely just names yeah I
think I didn't really have a sense of

think I didn't really have a sense of
 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:58.930
think I didn't really have a sense of
you know so I had learned ways theorems

00:05:58.930 --> 00:05:58.940
you know so I had learned ways theorems
 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.090
you know so I had learned ways theorems
and tricks and so forth but I am I

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:01.100
and tricks and so forth but I am I

didn't really have a good sense of what

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:02.990
didn't really have a good sense of what
 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:04.180
didn't really have a good sense of what
was the most important or what was the

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:04.190
was the most important or what was the
 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:07.659
was the most important or what was the
what was the yeah I didn't the why of

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:07.669
what was the yeah I didn't the why of
 

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:09.690
what was the yeah I didn't the why of
mathematics into a little later I

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:09.700
mathematics into a little later I
 

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:11.860
mathematics into a little later I
remember when I was learning calculus I

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:11.870
remember when I was learning calculus I
 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:13.510
remember when I was learning calculus I
I thought that the most important method

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520
I thought that the most important method
 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.219
I thought that the most important method
ition would not be Taylor because

00:06:15.219 --> 00:06:15.229
ition would not be Taylor because
 

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:17.370
ition would not be Taylor because
Taylor's name appears everywhere in

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:17.380
Taylor's name appears everywhere in
 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:19.230
Taylor's name appears everywhere in
in undergraduate calculus Taylor

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:19.240
in undergraduate calculus Taylor
 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:20.670
in undergraduate calculus Taylor
expansion Taylor's will and so forth and

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:20.680
expansion Taylor's will and so forth and
 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.530
expansion Taylor's will and so forth and
you know he was a good math addition but

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:22.540
you know he was a good math addition but
 

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:24.090
you know he was a good math addition but
but yeah you know there are many other

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:24.100
but yeah you know there are many other
 

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:26.280

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:37.120
when you're doing mathematics do you use

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:37.130
when you're doing mathematics do you use
 

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:38.890
when you're doing mathematics do you use
any kind of visualization in your head

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:38.900
any kind of visualization in your head
 

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:40.300
any kind of visualization in your head
what does it look like in your head when

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:40.310
what does it look like in your head when
 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:46.690
what does it look like in your head when
you're doing math that's a bit hard to

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:46.700
you're doing math that's a bit hard to
 

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:50.290
you're doing math that's a bit hard to
explain yeah it's always always a

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:50.300
explain yeah it's always always a
 

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:51.760
explain yeah it's always always a

and speaking out loud and working on the
 

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:56.680
and speaking out loud and working on the
board you do try to isolate sort of the

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:56.690
board you do try to isolate sort of the
 

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:58.930

simplest metaphor or something for your

00:06:58.930 --> 00:06:58.940
simplest metaphor or something for your
 

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:02.200
simplest metaphor or something for your
problem like how can I explain it so you

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:02.210
problem like how can I explain it so you
 

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:03.940
problem like how can I explain it so you
know for instance um I do a lot of

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:03.950
know for instance um I do a lot of
 

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:06.370

less than Y and sometimes it helps to to

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:08.720
less than Y and sometimes it helps to to
 

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.150
less than Y and sometimes it helps to to
think of this as of economics problems

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:10.160
think of this as of economics problems
 

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.160
think of this as of economics problems
like you have a budget of Y and can you

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:12.170
like you have a budget of Y and can you
 

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:15.490
like you have a budget of Y and can you
afford X and then and that that way you

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:15.500
afford X and then and that that way you
 

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:17.170
afford X and then and that that way you
you start thinking economically like

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:17.180
you start thinking economically like
 

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:19.300
you start thinking economically like
like yeah so the way you put in equality

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:19.310
like yeah so the way you put in equality
 

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:20.740
like yeah so the way you put in equality
is like a first and why is that you

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:20.750
is like a first and why is that you
 

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:22.690
is like a first and why is that you
normally you you maybe try to first buy

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:22.700
normally you you maybe try to first buy
 

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:24.910
