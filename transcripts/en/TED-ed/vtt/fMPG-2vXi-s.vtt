00:00:06.977 --> 00:00:11.967
Nanahuatl, weakest of the Aztec gods, 
sickly and covered in pimples,

00:00:11.967 --> 00:00:14.589
had been chosen to form a new world.

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:19.337
There had already been four worlds, each 
set in motion by its own “Lord Sun,"

00:00:19.337 --> 00:00:21.960
and each, in turn, destroyed:

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.005
the first by jaguars, the next by winds,

00:00:25.005 --> 00:00:28.800
the next by rains of fire, 
and the fourth by floods.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.549
To establish the Fifth Sun,

00:00:30.549 --> 00:00:33.142
Lord Quetzalcoatl, 
the “Feathered Serpent,”

00:00:33.142 --> 00:00:36.796
had gone to the underworld and 
returned with the bones of earlier people,

00:00:36.796 --> 00:00:40.031
nourishing them with his own 
blood to create new life.

00:00:40.031 --> 00:00:41.969
But for them to have a world to live in,

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.420
another god had to leap into the 
great bonfire and become the fifth sun.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.370
The Lord of Sustenance and the Lord of 
Fire had chosen Nanahuatl for this task,

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.205
while the Lord of Rain and 
the Lord of the Four Quarters

00:00:54.205 --> 00:00:59.045
had picked their own offering:
the proud, rich Tecciztecatl.

00:00:59.045 --> 00:01:03.305
First, the chosen ones had to complete a 
four-day fasting and bloodletting ritual.

00:01:03.305 --> 00:01:06.946
Nanahuatl had nothing but cactus thorns 
with which to bleed himself,

00:01:06.946 --> 00:01:09.363
and fir branches to paint 
with his red offering,

00:01:09.363 --> 00:01:11.483
but he resolved to try his best.

00:01:11.483 --> 00:01:14.871
Meanwhile, Tecciztecatl flaunted 
his riches,

00:01:14.871 --> 00:01:20.063
using magnificent jade spines and branches
adorned with iridescent quetzal feathers

00:01:20.063 --> 00:01:22.028
for his own blood offering.

00:01:22.028 --> 00:01:25.314
When four days had passed, 
the fire was roaring high.

00:01:25.314 --> 00:01:28.954
Four times proud Tecciztecatl 
approached the flames,

00:01:28.954 --> 00:01:31.515
and four times he pulled back in fear.

00:01:31.515 --> 00:01:33.593
Humble Nanahuatl stepped forward.

00:01:33.593 --> 00:01:37.104
The other gods painted him chalky 
white and glued feathers to him.

00:01:37.104 --> 00:01:40.281
Without hesitation, he threw himself 
into the flames.

00:01:40.281 --> 00:01:43.190
A fire-blackened eagle 
swooped over the fire,

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.253
grabbed Nanahuatl and carried 
him into the sky.

00:01:46.253 --> 00:01:49.042
There, Lord and Lady Sustenance 
bathed him,

00:01:49.042 --> 00:01:53.012
sat him on a feathered throne, and 
wrapped a red band around his head.

00:01:53.012 --> 00:01:54.567
Inspired by Nanahuatl,

00:01:54.567 --> 00:01:59.602
Tecciztecatl threw himself into what 
was left of the fire: cooled ashes.

00:01:59.602 --> 00:02:05.402
A jaguar jumped over the fire pit, but 
couldn’t carry Tecciztecatl into the sky.

00:02:05.402 --> 00:02:10.026
When Tecciztecatl reached the horizon, a 
band of goddesses dressed him in rags.

00:02:10.026 --> 00:02:13.721
Still, he shined just as brightly 
as Nanahuatl.

00:02:13.721 --> 00:02:17.293
But since he had shown far less bravery 
and much more pride,

00:02:17.293 --> 00:02:20.816
one of the gods picked up a rabbit 
and tossed it in his face,

00:02:20.816 --> 00:02:22.674
dimming his light.

00:02:22.674 --> 00:02:25.564
But the fifth world still wasn’t 
truly established.

00:02:25.564 --> 00:02:28.805
Nanahuatl, Lord Sun,
shined for four days straight

00:02:28.805 --> 00:02:32.387
without moving through the sky like 
all the previous suns had moved.

00:02:32.387 --> 00:02:36.286
Back in their home, Teotihuacan, 
the gods began to worry.

00:02:36.286 --> 00:02:39.791
They sent Obsidian Hawk up 
to ask what was wrong.

00:02:39.791 --> 00:02:44.313
Nanahuatl replied that just as he had 
sacrificed himself to become Lord Sun,

00:02:44.313 --> 00:02:47.366
he now needed the nourishing 
blood of the other gods

00:02:47.366 --> 00:02:49.615
in order to move through the sky.

00:02:49.615 --> 00:02:55.277
Enraged at this suggestion, Lord Dawn 
stepped up and shot an arrow at Lord Sun.

00:02:55.277 --> 00:02:56.581
Lord Sun shot back,

00:02:56.581 --> 00:02:59.700
and his quetzal-feathered arrows 
struck Lord Dawn in the face,

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.493
turning him to frost.

00:03:01.493 --> 00:03:03.549
Before anyone else could act rashly,

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:06.984
the other gods turned to each 
other to discuss what to do.

00:03:06.984 --> 00:03:10.024
Of course, no one wanted to 
sacrifice themselves,

00:03:10.024 --> 00:03:12.712
but nor did anyone want to 
act like Lord Dawn.

00:03:12.712 --> 00:03:16.909
Besides, Nanahuatl had held up his end of 
the bargain to nourish the earth—

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:19.451
how could they refuse to 
nourish him in return?

00:03:19.451 --> 00:03:22.152
They remembered how even 
the wimpy Tecciztecatl

00:03:22.152 --> 00:03:25.587
had eventually managed to 
emulate Nanahuatl's bravery.

00:03:25.587 --> 00:03:29.772
At long last, five other gods agreed 
to sacrifice themselves.

00:03:29.772 --> 00:03:34.060
One by one, Lord Death stabbed them 
in the heart with an obsidian knife,

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.998
offering their bodies to 
their new Lord Sun.

00:03:36.998 --> 00:03:39.049
As the last god made the sacrifice,

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:42.948
Lord Quetzalcoatl blew the embers 
of the great fire back to life,

00:03:42.948 --> 00:03:45.688
and the sun began to move 
through the sky at last,

00:03:45.688 --> 00:03:48.232
ushering in the fifth age.

00:03:48.232 --> 00:03:52.242
Thanks to a pimply weakling whose 
fortitude inspired all the other gods,

00:03:52.242 --> 00:03:54.465
the sun moves along its daily path,

00:03:54.465 --> 00:03:57.675
the rabbit-faced moon 
following in its wake.
