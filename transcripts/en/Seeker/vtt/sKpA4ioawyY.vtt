00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:04.290
There’s no place on earth quite like Antarctica.

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.520
Its landscape alone sets it apart: a vast
white wilderness that can provide a haven

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.290
for solitude.

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.840
But Antarctica’s uniqueness isn’t just
its scenery.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.359
Politically, Antarctica is also an anomaly.

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:21.699
There are no permanent inhabitants, no government,
and to date, no nation has successfully claimed

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:23.640
this territory as its own.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.210
But with many outside nations eyeing its resources,
the question is, how long can Antarctica remain

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.210
ungoverned?

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.790
The people living here seem to be at peace
with themselves.

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:36.370
My name is Natacha Pisarenko.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.730
I’m a professional photographer working
for the Associated Press....

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:48.350
My photos were taken in South Shetland Islands,
and in the Western Antarctic peninsula..

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.900
Natacha came to Antarctica to document scientists
who hailed from different fields and different

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.940
countries around the world.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.280
And despite their different backgrounds, during
her time on the icy continent, what Natacha

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.760
observed was peaceful cooperation among the
researchers.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.710
These relationships were established, and
codified, back in 1959, during the height

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.780
of the Cold War.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.409
Antarctica is protected by a treaty as scientists
have to investigate Global warming and other

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:16.700
important issues.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.569
What she’s referring to is The Antarctic
Treaty.

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:25.780
Twelve countries, including the US and Soviet
Union, signed the agreement, which states,

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.549
“Scientific observations and results from
Antarctica shall be exchanged and made freely

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:31.549
available”.

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:37.890
Overall, its goal is to foster international
relations and cooperative scientific research.

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.240
The treaty also means that no one “owns”
Antarctica.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.890
And sure, some countries have tried to lay
claim to land here, but these claims have

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.909
never been universally recognized.

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:52.850
Today, there are about 75 research stations
here, maintained by various governments.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.539
And all of the countries represented still
maintain the idea of cooperation that was

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:00.689
stated in the treaty 57 years ago.

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.369
But international harmony isn’t the only
draw here.

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:09.099
Antarctica’s pollution-free air allows for
air quality monitoring with a reliable baseline.

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:13.290
Dark winters attract astronomers, and ice
core samples can be analysed to provide a

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.590
climatic record for the planet that dates
back hundreds of thousands of years.

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.650
However, as Natacha realized during her time
with the scientists, all of this collaboration

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.150
can be fragile.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.060
many fear that countries will rush to explore
its mineral resources and oil.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.420
For now, countries are banned from drilling
or having military bases, but several nations

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.660
keep research stations as a way to claim territory.

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:44.500
We’re talking about as much as 200 billion
barrels of oil...which is perhaps enough to

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.550
at least ask the question -- could oil break
the peace here?

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.700
We might not know the answer until the Treaty’s
review in 2048.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:58.330
Until then, Antarctica might remain the closest
thing we have to a Utopia.There have never

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:03.870
been any wars, nuclear testing, or any form
of military activity despite all the different

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.780
countries working here.

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.700
We can’t say nearly as much for anywhere
else in the world.

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.920
It’s a beautiful world, there are no borders,
and people rely on generosity and kindness

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:11.920
to survive.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.780
I really hope it remains untouched, it’s
a key place for all of us, and where we keep

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:20.819
coming back to ask ourselves, where did we
come from, are we alone in the universe, what’s

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:23.319
the fate of our warming planet?

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:29.739
On the other side of the planet there’s
another isolated polar region at the center

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:31.739
of a geopolitical debate.

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:36.540
Check out this video on how The Bering Strait
could become a major trading hub on the scale

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:37.540
of the Panama Canal.

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.200
The agreement was established in the Cold
War era, when a group of scientists from 12

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.500
different nations convinced the UN to institute
the “International Geophysical Year”,

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:46.500
an event designed to promote scientific research
in Antarctica.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.400
It’s success contributed to the Treaty we
know today.
