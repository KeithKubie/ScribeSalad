00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:16.230
Through the latter half of 
the 19th century, Mark Twain was on a mission

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.680
to attack pretense with satire.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.550
One of his most hilarious, if completely scandalous
and by many standards inappropriate, works

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.970
was a lecture he gave to The Stomach Club
in 1879 about masturbation titled, “Some

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.980
Thoughts on the Science of Onanism.”

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.680
During the 19th century, medical practice
had been increasingly incorporating scientific

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.410
thoughts and developments, including how disease
spread and the rise of anesthesia.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:46.101
As such, simply calling something a “science”
at that time gave it a certain cachet, so

00:00:46.101 --> 00:00:50.860
the irony of juxtaposing this honorific with
the topic of self-abuse (as masturbation used

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.079
to be called), would not have been lost on
the audience.

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:59.079
Nor would any part of Twain’s talk go unappreciated,
as The Stomach Club was a group of writers

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.020
and artists who loved to get together over
a delicious meal, and a few too many drinks,

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.189
and enjoy a bawdy tale.

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.109
That evening, Twain’s topic would not disappoint,
as Onanism was well known at the time as a

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:12.109
euphemism for masturbation

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:15.540
If you’re wondering, Onan was the guy from
the Old Testament who was killed for spilling

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.289
his “seed” on the ground instead of in
the lady- the oldest documented instance of

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:24.630
the withdrawal method of birth control being
used, which contrary to what many think is

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.659
actually nearly as effective at preventing
pregnancy as condoms according to a 2008 study,

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.959
Better Than Nothing or Savvy Risk-Reduction
Practice?

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:36.429
The Importance of Withdrawal, written by researchers
from Princeton, Central Connecticut State

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:40.509
University, the Guttmacher Institute, and
Ibis Reproductive Health.

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:44.999
Specifically, they note the withdrawal method,
while a poor way to prevent STDs in general,

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:48.919
when executed perfectly- which just means
withdrawing before ejaculation, aiming said

00:01:48.919 --> 00:01:53.419
ejaculate away from the relevant lady bits,
and not having sex again until one has urinated

00:01:53.419 --> 00:01:58.539
first to clear any remaining sperm out of
the urethra- is 96% effective at preventing

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:04.060
pregnancy if used as the primary means of
contraception over the course of a given year.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.989
For comparison, using a condom, when done
perfectly, is 98% effective over that same

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:15.030
span and oral contraception has a “perfect
use” rate of about 99.7%.

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.400
Now this is when all three methods are done
“perfectly”, so what about in actual practice

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.970
with everyday people?

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.440
The pull and pray method is roughly 82% effective
while using a condom is roughly 83% effective,

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.209
give or take depending on which study you
want to go with.

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.530
The pill, in contrast, does offer a much better
“actual use” rate of around 96%.

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.829
In any event, back to Twain and his thoughts
on Onanism- getting off to a good start with

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:44.730
his speech, Twain began by referring to the
act as a “species of recreation . . . to

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.959
which I perceive you are much addicted.”

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:47.959
He goes on,

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.920
Homer, in the second book of the Iliad says
with fine enthusiasm, “Give me masturbation

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.100
or give me death.”

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.599
Caesar, in his Commentaries, says, “To the
lonely it is company; to the forsaken it is

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:02.140
a friend; to the aged and to the impotent
it is a benefactor.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.890
They that are penniless are yet rich, in that
they still have this majestic diversion.”

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.900
In another place this experienced observer
has said, “There are times when I prefer

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:11.969
it to sodomy.”

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:15.630
Robinson Crusoe says, “I cannot describe
what I owe to this gentle art.”

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.200
Queen Elizabeth said, “It is the bulwark
of virginity.”

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.999
Cetewayo, the Zulu hero, remarked, “A jerk
in the hand is worth two in the bush.”

00:03:22.999 --> 00:03:26.190
The immortal Franklin has said, “Masturbation
is the best policy.”

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:32.430
… Michelangelo said to Pope Julius II, “Self-negation
is noble, self-culture beneficent, self-possession

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:38.040
is manly, but to the truly great and inspiring
soul they are poor and tame compared with

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.040
self-abuse.”

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.040
…

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.159
Obviously a fan, Twain remained faithful to
his journalistic roots and gave equal time

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:47.319
to those who were not enamored with the ancient
art, noting

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:51.569
Brigham Young, an expert of incontestable
authority, said, “As compared with the other

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:54.930
thing, it is the difference between the lightning
bug and the lightning.”

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.599
Solomon said, “There is nothing to recommend
it but its cheapness.”

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:04.219
Galen said, “It is shameful to degrade to
such bestial uses that grand limb, that formidable

00:04:04.219 --> 00:04:08.870
member, which we votaries of Science dub the
Major Maxillary–when they dub it at all–which

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:14.269
is seldom, It would be better to amputate
the os frontis than to put it to such use.”

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:17.280
Twain then turned to Darwin and the noble
monkey, stating,

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.729
Mr. Darwin was grieved to feel obliged to
give up his theory that the monkey was the

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:24.190
connecting link between man and the lower
animals.

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:25.599
I think he was too hasty.

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:30.530
The monkey is the only animal, except man,
that practices this science; hence, he is

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.950
our brother; there is a bond of sympathy and
relationship between us.

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.520
Give this ingenuous animal an audience of
the proper kind and he will straightway put

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:43.479
aside his other affairs and take a whet; and
you will see by his contortions and his ecstatic

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:48.250
expression that he takes an intelligent and
human interest in his performance.

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.949
Like a modern roast today, Twain couldn’t
resist sticking it to his audience a bit as

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:56.950
he opined that those who indulge in the recreation
too much can be easily detected by their “disposition

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:02.539
to eat, to drink, to smoke, to meet together
convivially, to laugh, to joke and tell indelicate

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:03.539
stories.”

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:07.490
Ultimately, however, Twain explained that
this science was the least efficacious of

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:08.790
all sexual acts since:

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:13.150
As an amusement, it is too fleeting; as an
occupation . . . too wearing; as a public

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:14.879
exhibition, there is no money in it.

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:19.340
It is unsuited to the drawing room, and in
the most cultured society it has long been

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:23.510
banished . . . It has at last, in our day
of progress and improvement, been degraded

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:25.699
to brotherhood with flatulence.

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:29.930
Among the best bred, these two arts are now
indulged in only private–though by consent

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:33.419
of the whole company, when only males are
present, it is still permissible, in good

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:37.210
society, to remove the embargo on the fundamental
sigh.

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.440
Finally, Twain concluded with these maxims:

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:43.710
If you must gamble your lives sexually, don’t
play a lone hand too much.

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:47.669
When you feel a revolutionary uprising in
your system, get your Vendome Column down

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:52.120
some other way – don’t jerk it down.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.159
Circumcision in the United States did not
become popular because Christians were trying

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:59.229
to keep with the covenant between God and
Abraham, as is often thought today.

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:04.289
After 50 BC, circumcision remained, at least
popularly speaking, a largely Jewish affair

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:06.810
as it had been since at least 1800 BC.

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:11.710
However, there eventually arose a controversy
concerning the practice among Christians as

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:15.940
it was unclear whether the Gospel required
circumcision among converts, which would thus

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.970
restrict Christianity to Jews or Gentiles
willing to snip the tip.

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:24.330
Ultimately, it was decided that circumcision
was not a prerequisite to conversion, and

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.770
the Catholic Church maintained a degree of
hostility towards the practice which would

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:32.909
set the tone for circumcision among Catholics
and Protestants alike until the 19th century

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:34.379
(though of course Muslim groups would popularly
also eventually adopt the practice).

00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:38.740
But as for the Western world, the popularity
of circumcision didn’t grow until the 19th

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.610
century as a way to try to discourage masturbation.

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:45.190
Clitoridectomies were also mildly popular
for a time as a treatment for masturbation

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:46.190
in women.

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:50.220
For more on this, see our video The History
of Circumcision.

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:53.650
Samuel Clemens grew up along the banks of
the Mississippi River, where he eventually

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:55.689
became a steamboat pilot in 1857.

00:06:55.689 --> 00:07:00.009
It was from his experiences here that he came
up with the name “Mark Twain” sometime

00:07:00.009 --> 00:07:01.630
around 1863.

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:06.220
This was river slang for 12 feet of water,
or two fathoms, with Mark twain literally

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:46.449
meaning “mark two” or the second mark
on the depth measurement line.
