Hi! My name is Chloe Marianne, a new animator at Psych2Go. I'm animating this episode for you today. Enjoy!

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.240
Dating is rough for everybody

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.529
But is being queer an extra hurdle to jump over in the effort to find love?

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.080
We at Psych2Go say yes.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:31.319
There are many unique problems that those in the LGBT community face during their time on the dating scene.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:37.020
Without further ado, here is a list of eight dating problems the LGBT community faces

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.560
Number one: Casual racism

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.500
A recent study on gay dating preferences shows that 80% of black men,

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:53.669
79% Asian men and 75% of South Asian men have all endured racism in their efforts to date.

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:57.209
Many people of color also experience fetishization

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:01.439
Black men are messaged in the hopes that they'll be aggressive or masculine

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.910
Asian men are often messaged because they might seem cute or submissive

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.089
How do women compare? Fairly better, actually.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:15.059
Queer women are less likely to be affected by ethnicity and more open to interracial dating.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.960
Number two: Fat and femme shaming

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.560
The queer community is full of individuals with different body types and gendered energies

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.400
This includes some of us who are a little on the skinny side or weigh a few extra pounds,

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.900
Or exude some feminine energy.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:37.880
The unfortunate truth is, gay culture does not deem these traits desirable in our world today

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.780
Muscles and manliness went over femininity, which many mistakenly consider subordinate and lesser

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.620
Number three: Hook up culture

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.280
Believe me, when you're looking for a hook up or a friends-with-benefits type situation, this can be great

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.920
This is not to say that there aren't queer people who are searching for a deeper connection

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.820
But if you are looking to get to know someone before they stick their hands down your pants, this can be extremely frustrating

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:13.200
It's not easy talking to someone you've just met only for them to ask you about your sexual preferences and what your genitals look like

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.800
Number four: Not enough fish in the sea

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.420
Growing up in an urban cityscape can be the best thing in the world for a queer person looking for options

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.159
Whether you're in New York, L.A, Tokyo or London,

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.279
There is endless opportunity for you to find the person of your dreams. Not in a city packed with people?

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:34.579
The odds are less in your favor.

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:40.619
It's hard for a queer person in a small town or sparsely populated area to meet potential partners

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:45.179
Don't give up! Dating in a small town does not mean that you're doomed

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:49.438
Number five: Are they even into you?

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:55.140
Sure, there are some common tells that could give us some insight on whether someone is LGBTQ, but

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.079
Sometimes the only way to know is to ask

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:05.420
Is she into women or not? Can you get a guy to fall in love with you even though he keeps calling you his bro?

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.900
For the LGBTQ community, this is a common obstacle

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.280
Number six: Dating while closeted

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:21.180
Let me preface this point by saying that many people choose to keep their sexual identity a secret for a range of reasons

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:23.909
including the preservation of their personal safety

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.720
That being said, it is hard to date while you are still in the closet.

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.740
It can be mentally and emotionally exhausting to keep the person you love a secret

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:41.200
It can also be just as exhausting for your partner who must help you maintain a double life in order for your relationship to continue

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.600
For these reasons, those who date while in the closet may experience relationships strain.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.760
Number seven: Dating with HIV

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.599
HIV is still a huge taboo in the LGBT community today.

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:00.400
Modern medicine has come a long way over the past few decades and HIV is no longer a death sentence.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:06.980
But those who live with HIV positive status are shunned from the dating scene because of this same fear

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.140
and the misconceptions many of us have of HIV.

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:16.408
While it is still important to take safety measures, HIV is an obstacle that can be overcome by couples

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:20.549
It is important to remember that people with HIV are not dirty, or

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.839
deserving of their status in any way, and it's totally possible to have a healthy,

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.720
safe relationship with an HIV-positive individual.

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.960
Number eight: Transphobia

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.440
Dating can be rough if you're trans.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:41.700
Trans and non-binary individuals still receive a great deal of harassment in regards to their gender, sex and appearance.

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:49.700
Trans and non-binary people also have the added stress of deciding if, and when to disclose their identity to dates and partners

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:55.348
Many trans people who are simply looking to get to know someone often find themselves fetishized.

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:03.478
Now, keep in mind the LGBT community is diverse, and a few of these problems are directed more to some than they are to others

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:08.729
The first step to solving these problems is awareness.

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:15.449
The LGBT community and its supporters have the ability to shed light on these issues so that they can be met with love and acceptance.

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:19.739
So, what do you think? Are there any problems that we've missed?

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:24.660
Let us know, are there any items on this list that you feel need their own videos?

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.180
