[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:07.750
SPEAKER: Thank you so much for
joining us today, Michelle.

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:07.948
MICHELLE LEE: Of course.

00:00:07.948 --> 00:00:09.740
Thank you for having me.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.890
SPEAKER: So what is it
like to be editor-in-chief

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:12.910
at "Allure" magazine?

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.059
MICHELLE LEE: Oh,
what a question.

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:18.340
So I always think of it
as-- so I've been working

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.540
in media for the past 25 years.

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.560
And when I first started out,
the role of the editor-in-chief

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.350
was completely different.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.850
So my first role here in New
York was actually at "Glamour."

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:30.100
And so at the time, it
was "Glamour" magazine.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.710
The editor-in-chief was this
totally legendary editor

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.030
named Ruth Whitney.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.220
And so she had that
one role though,

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.500
which was to be the
editor-in-chief of a magazine.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.620
I think today being an
editor-in-chief is almost

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.970
being the shepherd of a brand.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.250
So I've been there now
for about 3 and 1/2 years.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.190
And when I started,
I was very much

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.860
seen as this new realm
of editor-in-chief who

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.500
was sort of like the modern
editor who understood print,

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.270
and digital, and
video, and social,

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.110
and all those different things.

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.660
So one of my
biggest things to do

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.780
was to have everybody understand
that we're not just a magazine

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:02.680
anymore.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.475
So I remember when
I first started,

00:01:04.475 --> 00:01:06.100
people would still
introduce themselves

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.480
and say, I'm so-and-so.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.640
I'm an editor at
"Allure" magazine.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.830
So we very much, like, that
first week, we're like,

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.690
you're not an editor
at "Allure" magazine,

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.560
you're an editor at "Allure."

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.920
And it was shifting the
viewpoint of everyone

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.720
internally, but also
externally to have

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.920
them understand we're
not just a magazine,

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.660
we're now a media brand.

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.037
So flash forward
3 and 1/2 years,

00:01:25.037 --> 00:01:26.620
and I actually see
it much differently

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.072
now where we're not just a media
brand, but we're also a brand.

00:01:30.072 --> 00:01:31.780
So we were talking
before we came up here

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.560
about one of our businesses
is the "Allure" Beauty Box.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.540
So we now are in
consumer products.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:38.470
We're doing events.

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.900
We're doing all those
other media things as well.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.503
But I think that what's been
really innovative in the past 3

00:01:43.503 --> 00:01:44.920
and 1/2 years that
I've been there

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.650
has been us shifting
from being just media

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.745
into being an overall brand.

00:01:49.745 --> 00:01:52.120
So yes, but to answer your
question also about what is it

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.070
like to be the editor-in-chief,
on social media

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.130
if anyone follows me, we play
with a lot of beauty products.

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.080
Like it's definitely
a very, very fun job.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.440
I have a couple of my
coworkers here who--

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.980
it's probably one of the only
offices that you can walk into

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.320
and it's completely
normal to walk by someone

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.840
and they're putting on
a full face of makeup.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.930
We actually are testing for our
"Allure" Best of Beauty Awards

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:14.900
right now.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.150
And so every season, we test
10,000 products just for that.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.120
So it sounds so fun
and it is very fun,

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.430
but it's also
incredibly overwhelming

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.130
because we go home every
single day with just bags

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:28.600
and bags of stuff.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.928
So that's the fun part of it.

00:02:29.928 --> 00:02:31.720
Like, I think playing
with beauty products,

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.870
getting to understand everything
about the beauty industry.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.630
But I think being an editor in
chief, also, is a lot of work.

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.470
I think a lot of
times, people in media

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.300
and in movies and
stuff have this picture

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.427
of what an editor in chief does.

00:02:46.427 --> 00:02:48.260
For example, "The Devil
Wears Prada," right?

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.710
I think that we all have this
image of what the Miranda

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:52.485
Priestly character does.

00:02:52.485 --> 00:02:54.610
I always describe being an
editor in chief, though,

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.150
sort of like being the
director of a movie.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.650
For some of my family members,
for example, who don't really

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.250
understand what an editor is,
I often got the question, like,

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:04.420
what does an editor do?

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.880
Are you fixing the commas
and periods all the time?

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.950
I'm like, that's a part
of it, but really, it's

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.260
being the director
of a movie, where

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.930
I am the key
decision maker in all

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.620
the different creative choices.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.190
So if we also wanted to get
into some new business--

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.590
if we wanted to launch a
line of brushes or makeup

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.420
bags or anything
else, I would be

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.690
involved in the entire
creative process of it, too.

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.940
So I think that my role now--

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.580
honestly, it touches a lot
more on the business side

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.460
than I ever could have
imagined 20 years ago.

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:34.750
SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.610
Well this next
question comes more

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.320
from a personal spot for me.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.120
The publishing
industry in general

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.170
is overwhelmingly white.

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.970
We're talking about novels,
magazines, et cetera.

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.730
And growing up as a
young girl, I rarely

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.700
saw models looking like
myself when I was--

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.200
MICHELLE LEE: Where
did you grow up?

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.720
SPEAKER: In Canada,
in Vancouver.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.040
So when I was there, I never
saw a lot of cover models

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.100
who looked like me or who
were different on covers.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.670
And so this year alone,
in 2019, Serena Williams

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:01.720
was your January cover.

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.480
Then you had "Crazy Rich
Asians" star Gemma Chan

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.240
in another cover.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:09.710
So how do you approach
diversity at the organization,

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:11.710
and then how do you also
make that trickle down,

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:13.063
beyond just editor in chief?

00:04:13.063 --> 00:04:15.730
MICHELLE LEE: Yeah, well I think
it's a couple different things.

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.880
Part of it is, internally,
how we look at our staff,

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.890
how we look at
hiring, and I actually

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:23.510
do think that that's very much
related to the type of content,

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.820
then, that we produce, also.

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.240
So in the 3 and 1/2 years
that I've been at "Allure"--

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.780
so right before I started,
I created a presentation

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.530
for my bosses to say,
this is what I would

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.030
want to do with the brand.

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.400
And obviously, you
start out having a plan,

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.850
and things evolve over time.

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:40.060
I think if I looked back
at that presentation now,

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.018
a lot of things would
have changed from it.

00:04:42.018 --> 00:04:44.560
But one of the things that was
core to that mission even back

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.370
then was diversity.

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.290
So it's crazy actually
to think about

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:51.940
that 3 and 1/2 years ago, there
was like hardly any diversity

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.100
when it came to
magazine covers, when

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.650
it came to models on
runways, and actually, we've

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.290
come so far since then.

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:01.918
But I think back
three years ago,

00:05:01.918 --> 00:05:04.210
it was still considered to
be kind of a quote, unquote,

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.598
"risk" to put a person
of color on the cover.

00:05:07.598 --> 00:05:09.140
I'd have to look
back at the numbers,

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:10.557
but I would guess
that on average,

00:05:10.557 --> 00:05:13.150
if you looked at the
normal magazine cover,

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.630
it was maybe average to have
about two people of color

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:18.670
on a cover in a year.

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:22.570
Last year alone, I think
more than half of our covers

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:24.610
were people of color.

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.190
But it's also not just doing
diversity for diversity's sake.

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:30.070
I think that now, we've moved
on to this space of looking

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.100
at what it means as a story, but
also making sure that diversity

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.050
is just woven into
everything that we do

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:37.840
and that it doesn't
feel heavy handed.

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.965
I think that the thing that
we never want to happen

00:05:39.965 --> 00:05:42.070
is have someone feel
like it's exploitative

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:45.970
or that we're just doing it
to get the pat on the back.

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:48.130
And also thinking about
what is diversity, right?

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:50.770
I think that as an
Asian-American woman,

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.410
I think of diversity
first and foremost

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:57.380
from a gender perspective, but
also from race and ethnicity.

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:59.050
But when it comes
to beauty, I think

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:02.440
there are still a lot of
underserved communities

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:06.730
that deal with
body type, ageism.

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:11.500
We, in 2017, famously banned the
term anti-aging from "Allure"

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:15.183
forever, and it actually became
just this global phenomenon

00:06:15.183 --> 00:06:17.350
where people around the
world were talking about it.

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:20.080
I actually read
something that in the UK,

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.840
someone had put
forward a referendum

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:26.620
to ban anti-aging from the UK
because they read our story.

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:28.325
So I feel like
there is something

00:06:28.325 --> 00:06:29.950
through diversity
and inclusion that we

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:33.610
can do that's really important
and kind of beyond just making

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:35.630
people feel good
about themselves.

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:36.720
I think that--

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:40.150
I have two kids, so for my
son and also my daughter,

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:41.410
I think it's really cool--

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:42.910
the fact that they
can watch movies,

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:44.493
that they can look
at magazine covers,

00:06:44.493 --> 00:06:47.990
that they can look at photos
of people who look like them,

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:50.560
and it's not necessarily that
this image of beauty that's

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.960
portrayed by the media or
pop culture or anything else

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.240
is just this one
super narrow view.

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.460
So yeah, I think diversity--

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:00.310
it's been very, very
important to me.

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:01.810
We, last year, also--

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:04.360
you mentioned the
Gemma Chan cover.

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.880
Last year for June,
we had our hair issue.

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:10.672
So we were trying to think about
who we would have on the cover.

00:07:10.672 --> 00:07:12.130
So it's always this
big discussion.

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:13.810
We usually have
boards up and stuff

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:16.950
about looking at different
celebrities and models of who

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:18.760
is having a moment right now.

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:21.250
So we decided to choose
three Asian models,

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:23.980
and we-- it still was this
beautiful hair moment.

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:26.230
We had one with
bright pink hair,

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:29.320
we had one with black hair,
and one with platinum hair.

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:32.230
But putting three Asian
models on the cover--

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:34.570
it was sort of this
statement without being too

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:38.380
beat people over the head
of it about tokenism,

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:41.320
because normally, if you look at
an advertisement or a magazine

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:43.630
cover where they talk
about it being diverse,

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:47.380
there is usually, let's say,
five white models and then

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:48.730
one person of color.

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:50.230
So for us, we were
like, we're going

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:53.560
to give these three Asian
models their own cover.

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:56.770
It went crazy out in the
world of social media.

00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:59.050
Chrissy Teigen tweeted
about it and stuff.

00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:01.330
And so I wrote my
editor's letter about--

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:03.310
after we decided to
do that, I actually

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:05.620
started looking into
how many Asian women had

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:08.560
been on the cover of "Allure"
in the past 28 years.

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:10.320
So in the past 28 years--

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:12.560
and I want to say it
was like 327 covers--

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.860
there had only been
two Asian women.

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:17.020
The first was Lucy
Liu over 10 years ago,

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:18.490
and then Olivia Munn.

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:20.290
So in this one issue
of "Allure" where

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:22.760
we had the three Asian
women on the cover,

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:24.730
we actually had more
Asian representation

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:27.320
than in the entire
28 year history.

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:31.000
So that's just "Allure," and I
think for the entire industry,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.570
it's important for all
of us, when we can,

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:36.490
to be showing that these
things can be successful

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:38.710
and showing that--

00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:40.448
just what it looks
like, because I

00:08:40.448 --> 00:08:42.490
think that the people who
are at the helm of some

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:43.720
of the other brands--

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:46.880
they don't know what it is
until they actually see it.

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.660
And the thing that I
find kind of alarming--

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:52.830
I talk a lot about diversity
in a lot of panels and stuff,

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:54.580
and I think that there
are a lot of people

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:56.560
who think that we're
good, that we're like,

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:59.590
oh, the beauty and fashion
industry is so diverse now.

00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:02.200
And I'm like, we
are so not there.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:04.845
I think that people very
much still see it as like--

00:09:04.845 --> 00:09:06.220
they've got one
sort of-- they've

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:07.720
got like a light
skinned black girl,

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.670
and then they go,
tick, like, ding.

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:11.710
We can click that off.

00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:14.260
And I just feel like
there's so much more to do

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.463
and so much more to
start the conversation.

00:09:16.463 --> 00:09:18.130
SPEAKER: Thank you
for providing a voice

00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:21.470
to a lot of communities that
haven't seen representation.

00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:22.750
So I really appreciate that.

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:23.810
MICHELLE LEE: Thank you.

00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:27.602
SPEAKER: Beyond just disrupting
covers and narratives

00:09:27.602 --> 00:09:29.560
that you tell in "Allure,"
I'm curious to know,

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:32.020
from your POV, what
are some areas that

00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:35.290
are ripe for disruption in
the beauty industry today?

00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:36.610
MICHELLE LEE: So many.

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:38.860
How many of you work in the
beauty industry right now?

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:40.777
Because I feel like there
were some of you who

00:09:40.777 --> 00:09:41.910
had beauty clients, right?

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:42.430
OK.

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:44.740
So beauty is so
exciting right now.

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:47.590
I don't have to tell
you guys who work in it.

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:51.265
I do think, though, in the
world of sustainability,

00:09:51.265 --> 00:09:53.890
I actually think that there's a
lot of interesting conversation

00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:57.070
happening right now, and
partly because if you think

00:09:57.070 --> 00:10:01.030
about beauty and personal
care, how much waste there is,

00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:03.150
not only just on the
consumer portion of things.

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:04.650
Like we talk about
this all the time

00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:08.640
because us testing 10,000
products in a three month

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:11.070
period for Best of Beauty--
imagine how much just

00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:12.628
packaging waste we get.

00:10:12.628 --> 00:10:15.170
And it tends to be that the more
expensive brands, let's say,

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:16.260
in skin care--

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.270
we always equate it to
like a Russian doll where

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:20.110
it's like you get this
little tiny cream,

00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:21.820
but it's inside 10
boxes that you have

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:24.010
to kind of open up like this.

00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:26.160
There's a lot of waste
within that process,

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.008
but then also within
manufacturing.

00:10:28.008 --> 00:10:29.550
So I actually think,
and I've started

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:32.490
to see some movement in
this, too, of some startups

00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:35.430
and stuff who are doing
things packaging free.

00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:37.680
I think Lush does some really
interesting things, also

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.060
in terms of bath bombs.

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:42.130
If you think about them, there's
no packaging waste, whatsoever.

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:44.640
So I think that some of the
new things that I've just

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:47.010
been seeing hitting my
desk have been more related

00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:50.770
to the actual delivery of
things, as opposed to even--

00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:53.220
there's still innovation
happening with skin care

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:55.830
ingredients and with new
makeup colors and everything,

00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:58.915
but in a way, that's almost
like side stuff right now,

00:10:58.915 --> 00:11:00.540
and the really cool
things are actually

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:03.030
happening in the
distribution of products,

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:05.490
in personalization,
and also in how

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:08.010
to create these things in
a more sustainable way.

00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:09.427
SPEAKER: Is there
a favorite brand

00:11:09.427 --> 00:11:12.070
that you see doing this that
our audience should be aware of?

00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:12.660
MICHELLE LEE: Like
I said, I think

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:14.020
Lush is really interesting.

00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:15.270
There was this brand, which--

00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:17.062
I'm going to butcher
the name of the brand,

00:11:17.062 --> 00:11:19.920
so I'm not even going to say it,
but this founder-- and it's not

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:21.670
a big company, whatsoever, yet.

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:24.210
But she came to visit
me, and it was that--

00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:27.600
her thought process was so smart
because she basically had--

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:31.110
it was like a little bamboo
round box that just swivels,

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:32.807
and she called them--

00:11:32.807 --> 00:11:34.140
I think it was like bath stones.

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:34.980
No, no, I'm sorry.

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:36.030
Body stones.

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:39.300
So basically, this woman
who was the founder--

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:42.822
she started out in finance, but
then she went to pastry school.

00:11:42.822 --> 00:11:45.030
So she learned how to make
chocolates and everything.

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:47.880
So using the same methods of
how she would make chocolates,

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:50.918
she decided that she wanted
to make body care products.

00:11:50.918 --> 00:11:53.460
So rather than having-- if you
think about the lotion bottles

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:55.210
that you have at home,
right, what do you?

00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:57.940
You hopefully recycle them,
but then you just toss them,

00:11:57.940 --> 00:11:59.220
and it's like a lot of waste.

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:01.690
For her, she was like, if
I create these body stones,

00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:04.000
it's basically just, you
rub it onto your body,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.780
and then the heat from
your skin melts it

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:09.920
and it's basically
zero waste, whatsoever.

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:11.920
I don't know how big her
company is going to be,

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:14.190
but I thought that the
thought process behind it

00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:15.960
was really innovative,
and I think

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:19.560
that the more people who are
doing those types of things,

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:22.660
the larger companies are
also going to follow suit.

00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:23.610
SPEAKER: I like this.

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:25.470
Environmental,
sustainable-- probably

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:28.350
where the direction of
the world needs to go.

00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:29.460
So I'm kind of curious.

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:31.530
Because we live
here in New York,

00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:34.740
it's definitely a mecca for
all sorts of beauty treatments

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:37.180
and beauty innovation.

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:39.320
What are some must
tries in New York City?

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:40.362
MICHELLE LEE: Oh my gosh.

00:12:40.362 --> 00:12:41.580
I've tried so many.

00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:43.380
I thought about
this a lot because I

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:45.750
think as part of my job--

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:47.610
a very fun part of my job--

00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:49.638
we get to try a lot of
different treatments.

00:12:49.638 --> 00:12:51.930
So I recently, which we were
just talking about before,

00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:53.012
had brow microblading.

00:12:53.012 --> 00:12:54.970
I don't know if you guys
all know what that is,

00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:56.730
but it's basically
little tattoos

00:12:56.730 --> 00:12:58.680
that look like hairs,
so you don't have to do

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:00.240
your brows anymore every day.

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:00.930
Fascinating.

00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:03.940
Highly, highly recommend it.

00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:07.980
The other thing, too, is that
I think that for a long time,

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:10.050
people either
believed in facials

00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:11.610
or they didn't
believe in facials.

00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:13.680
I think I knew a lot of
people who thought, well,

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:15.050
facials are just kind of BS.

00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:17.550
Like they basically just put a
lot of products on your face,

00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:20.550
and you could do that at
home and not pay $300.

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:23.040
Today, though, I think
the modern facials

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:27.988
are really cool because they mix
technology also with products.

00:13:27.988 --> 00:13:30.280
There are a couple of really
great facials in the city.

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:32.400
I love Joanna Vargas.

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:35.562
There's Dr. David Colbert,
who-- he recently, I

00:13:35.562 --> 00:13:37.770
want to say within the past
couple of years, launched

00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:39.280
a whole secondary practice.

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:42.260
So his first practice was the
New York dermatological center,

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.280
and then now, he has
a whole other floor

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:48.060
of this building that's all
surrounding technology and skin

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:50.010
care and just general beauty.

00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:54.990
So he has things like
red light LED beds--

00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:55.907
very, very cool stuff.

00:13:55.907 --> 00:13:58.198
And then the other thing I
would highly recommend, too,

00:13:58.198 --> 00:14:00.985
for anyone who's very into
skin care, is microneedling.

00:14:00.985 --> 00:14:02.650
Do you guys all
know what that is?

00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:02.730
OK.

00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:05.105
So microneedling, you probably
see on Instagram and stuff

00:14:05.105 --> 00:14:07.740
of those at-home
tools where it looks

00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:10.050
sort of like a little
roller, and those are fine.

00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:14.190
But I think if you go to get
professional microneedling,

00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:17.140
I highly, highly believe
in it, where again,

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:19.500
it's sort of this merger
of technology and skin care

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:22.710
and everything else where the
thought process behind it is

00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:25.770
basically-- if you've ever had a
laser treatment, it's similar--

00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:28.290
that if you get a
little cut on your skin,

00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:32.172
our skin is miraculous
because it can heal itself.

00:14:32.172 --> 00:14:33.630
So it's sort of a
similar situation

00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:35.713
of where it's creating
these little micro-injuries

00:14:35.713 --> 00:14:37.540
in your skin that
then heal themselves,

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:41.070
and then they're producing
more collagen. That one, I

00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:43.280
truly, truly believe in.

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:45.030
You may have seen some
of the scary photos

00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:47.430
online of the vampire facial.

00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:51.030
That's a part of microneedling
where they do something called

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:54.120
PRP, which is
Platelet Rich Plasma,

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:57.030
and they basically spin
your blood in a centrifuge,

00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:58.650
and then after they
do microneedling,

00:14:58.650 --> 00:15:02.150
they put that all
over your face.

00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:05.820
It looks crazy, but
it really does work.

00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:08.173
SPEAKER: Well I got to chat
with Michelle prior to this

00:15:08.173 --> 00:15:10.340
and saw her very up close,
and her skin looks great.

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:12.632
So maybe I'll have to take
some of your recommendations

00:15:12.632 --> 00:15:13.790
and go for this.

00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:16.100
So at Google, I've
had the pleasure

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:18.500
of working with a lot of
different types of people,

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:22.800
and one person who's very
dear to me who sits next to me

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:25.640
is a drag queen on the weekends
and sometimes on nights.

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:28.550
So I'm really curious
about this question here.

00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:31.028
Beauty, historically,
has primarily

00:15:31.028 --> 00:15:33.320
been focused on women, but
when I've covered the beauty

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:35.930
industry within Google, the big
trend I see is year over year,

00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:39.820
we see men's grooming
skyrocketing exponentially.

00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:42.950
And mainstream culture has
also increasingly embraced

00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:45.020
male-identified makeup
influencers in shows

00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:46.520
like "RuPaul's Drag Race."

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:50.280
So how do you see this
impacting change over time?

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:52.655
And what do you expect in this
space in the coming years?

00:15:52.655 --> 00:15:53.447
MICHELLE LEE: Yeah.

00:15:53.447 --> 00:15:55.710
Oh, I think for sure in
the past year and a half,

00:15:55.710 --> 00:15:57.560
I would say, the whole--

00:15:57.560 --> 00:15:59.480
it sounds weird to
even call it a trend,

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:01.880
but the whole movement
of genderless beauty

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:03.648
has really taken off.

00:16:03.648 --> 00:16:05.690
I tend to think that in
the next couple of years,

00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:07.650
especially among the
younger generation,

00:16:07.650 --> 00:16:09.320
they're not going to
see gender anymore,

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:11.090
when it comes to beauty.

00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:14.240
My daughter is 10, and all of
her friends went crazy for--

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:17.780
there was like the James Charles
palette over the holidays.

00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:20.720
They all wanted this
James Charles palette.

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:23.780
I think that genderless beauty
is a really important trend.

00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:27.260
There's been a lot of
discussion about male grooming

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.360
in the past five years, though.

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:31.310
I think that when I
talk to companies,

00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:32.900
they haven't really
seen like a huge--

00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:35.480
there's always been this
feeling of men's grooming

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:37.730
is going to really take off,
really going to take off.

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:39.740
And I think that if we
looked at it on a chart,

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:43.918
I'm sure that it
has kind of gone up.

00:16:43.918 --> 00:16:46.460
I don't know that there's going
to be like a huge boom in it,

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:48.377
though, that we're feeling yet.

00:16:48.377 --> 00:16:50.210
I actually think that
there's still a huge--

00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:51.890
just looking at
America, there's still

00:16:51.890 --> 00:16:55.130
a huge, huge group of
people who don't do

00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:57.690
any type of beauty whatsoever.

00:16:57.690 --> 00:17:00.140
I think Olay had done some
study a couple years ago that

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:01.940
found that the vast
majority of people

00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:03.440
don't even wash their faces.

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:06.020
So even to capture 1%
of those people who

00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:08.880
don't wash their faces, like
that's still a huge number.

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:10.790
So I think that if I
were a beauty brand,

00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:12.079
I would definitely be
looking at like some

00:17:12.079 --> 00:17:13.912
of the low-hanging fruit
of like can we just

00:17:13.912 --> 00:17:16.420
get people to wash their faces?

00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:19.910
But, yeah, I think that in
general, like drag makeup,

00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:24.957
frankly, has been probably the
biggest catalyst for pushing

00:17:24.957 --> 00:17:26.540
makeup in general,
because if you look

00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:28.220
at every big-- or not every.

00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:30.920
If you look at most big
beauty influencers right now,

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:34.730
everyone is kind of doing
a form of drag makeup.

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:38.420
Contouring, you know, like
really amazing, amazing

00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:40.790
blending of like eye shadows--

00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:43.770
a lot of that really originates
from the drag community.

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:45.755
So I think that,
frankly, there's

00:17:45.755 --> 00:17:47.380
a lot of people who
don't realize that.

00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:48.838
But I do think that
a lot of people

00:17:48.838 --> 00:17:51.620
do realize that there is
that, the emphasis of it,

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:53.660
and also just
appreciate the artistry.

00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:54.920
SPEAKER: Mm-hmm.

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:55.880
Thank you.

00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:58.730
So "Allure" has also been
able to expand the brand

00:17:58.730 --> 00:18:01.010
with efforts like the
Best of Beauty seal

00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:04.280
that you see in a lot of stores,
as well as the "Allure" Beauty

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:05.240
Subscription Box.

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:07.250
So why do you think
these have been

00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:09.230
so successful for the company?

00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:12.230
And how important
is it for brands

00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:14.480
that have had more traditional
approaches to innovate,

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:15.633
to grow?

00:18:15.633 --> 00:18:16.620
MICHELLE LEE: Yep.

00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:18.620
Well, I think this one goes
back to what I was saying before

00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:20.870
about getting people to
understand that we're not just

00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:23.780
a media brand, and
we truly are a brand.

00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:26.450
I completely nerd
out when it comes

00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:28.610
to business and technology.

00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:30.717
Like I love talking
about those things.

00:18:30.717 --> 00:18:32.300
So the fact that as
an editor-in-chief

00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:33.980
I can actually work
on consumer products

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:36.600
is really exciting to me.

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:38.630
I think it's important
for us, and the reason

00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:43.000
it's been successful has been we
do have these 28 years of trust

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.480
that "Allure" has built up.

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:46.090
I think everything
that we do when

00:18:46.090 --> 00:18:47.840
it comes to consumer
products, and events,

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:49.465
and other things is
kind of still built

00:18:49.465 --> 00:18:51.740
on this overall
trust and authority

00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:53.540
of us being that
brand that if it's

00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:56.817
anything related to beauty, you
should trust our word on it.

00:18:56.817 --> 00:18:59.150
Like we want to be the first
and last word on any beauty

00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:01.620
trend, on what the
best products are.

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:04.070
And if you think about like
the "Allure" Beauty Box,

00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:05.950
it's a monthly
subscription that you get.

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:07.700
And so what makes ours
different from some

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:09.230
of the other ones
on the market is

00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:11.450
that it's all editor curated.

00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:13.370
So it's sort of
like getting a box

00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:17.330
from me, where we would write
little reviews about here's

00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:19.020
what you should like
about this product.

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:20.510
Here's how you can use it.

00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:23.900
This worked for this skin
tone, not for this skin tone.

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:29.000
We actually had an editor from
"Allure" Korea visit recently.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.940
And she brought me two
boxes, like about this big,

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:35.210
like really big, filled
with Korean beauty products

00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:36.770
that you can't buy here.

00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:39.680
And she very nicely wrote like
little handwritten Post-it

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:41.590
notes on every
single one of them.

00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:43.790
And it's hard to get
me excited about things

00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:45.290
now because we see
so many products.

00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:48.590
But I was so excited to get
these products because it

00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:51.147
was hand-curated by her,
where she was like, these are

00:19:51.147 --> 00:19:52.730
the products that I
know that Michelle

00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:55.188
is going to get excited about
and that she's going to love.

00:19:55.188 --> 00:19:56.825
So I think that,
in the ideal case,

00:19:56.825 --> 00:19:58.700
is really what the
"Allure" Beauty Box should

00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:02.570
be, that for you at home, if
you're a fan of "Allure" on any

00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:04.490
of the other platforms,
or maybe not,

00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:06.320
you feel like you're
getting something

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:07.700
that is straight
from the editors

00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:10.240
that we've picked for you.

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:11.930
SPEAKER: Amazing.

00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:15.230
So this question-- our
audience today, no surprise,

00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:16.690
skews heavily towards women.

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:19.840
So I'd like to ask this
question on their behalf, right?

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:21.580
You have a very
powerful position

00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:23.890
at determining the
voice of "Allure"

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:27.707
and what gets disseminated
to your readers, right?

00:20:27.707 --> 00:20:29.290
So for a lot of the
women in this room

00:20:29.290 --> 00:20:31.690
who do envision themselves
in a leadership position one

00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:35.908
day, what are the habits and
behaviors that you adopted

00:20:35.908 --> 00:20:37.450
over the years that
helped propel you

00:20:37.450 --> 00:20:38.590
to where you are today?

00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:41.630
MICHELLE LEE: Yeah, out of
curiosity, as a show of hands,

00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:44.990
how many of you manage people?

00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:46.940
OK, so a bunch of you.

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:49.850
I think, for me, the biggest
lesson that I had to learn

00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:50.780
was about management.

00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:52.530
And I'm not sure how
things are at Google.

00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:54.598
Do you guys have like
management training here?

00:20:54.598 --> 00:20:55.140
SPEAKER: Yes.

00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:55.490
MICHELLE LEE: You do, OK.

00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:57.755
SPEAKER: I think when you get
promoted to a certain level,

00:20:57.755 --> 00:20:58.170
[INAUDIBLE].

00:20:58.170 --> 00:20:58.580
MICHELLE LEE: Got it.

00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:00.805
So typically, in media,
there's no such-- well,

00:21:00.805 --> 00:21:02.930
I mean, there's some, I
guess, management training.

00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:04.460
But it's not
necessarily something

00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:07.520
that people have to go
through or always go through.

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:09.860
So the weird thing
about when you

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:11.960
start to climb the
ladder within media,

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:14.103
often you start as an assistant.

00:21:14.103 --> 00:21:15.770
There used to be sort
of like this path.

00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:18.050
You become an assistant
editor, an associate editor,

00:21:18.050 --> 00:21:19.760
senior editor, dah dah dah.

00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:23.540
The further you go up, suddenly
you're managing people.

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:25.400
And then it becomes
this weird thing.

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:28.260
And especially if you're
a young manager, for me,

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:31.010
it was a hard
transition of where

00:21:31.010 --> 00:21:34.790
you go from being people's
friend and colleague

00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:37.037
to suddenly you're
managing people.

00:21:37.037 --> 00:21:38.620
And I think the
hardest thing for me--

00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:42.260
and as I've talked to other
women who are managers, too--

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:44.150
one of the hardest things
is this distinction

00:21:44.150 --> 00:21:47.060
between being liked
and being respected

00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:50.010
and not confusing those two,
because they are different.

00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:52.010
And I think that for a
long time in the earlier

00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:55.010
part of my career, I only
cared about being liked.

00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:58.213
And it would hurt my feelings
if I felt like I wasn't liked.

00:21:58.213 --> 00:22:00.380
The difference now, I think,
is that along the way--

00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:02.838
and my husband's actually here,
and he was the one who sort

00:22:02.838 --> 00:22:04.340
of like drove this
home with me--

00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:07.250
it's more important
to be respected.

00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:10.010
And if you have the
respect of your team,

00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:11.970
they're also going
to like you, too.

00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:15.540
So I think that what happens
a lot sometimes with women,

00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:19.610
I think, in particular is that
you can get kind of frozen

00:22:19.610 --> 00:22:22.948
in decision-making if you
try and make everyone happy.

00:22:22.948 --> 00:22:24.740
So if you're trying to
make everyone happy,

00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:26.480
you're going to
make no one happy.

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:28.850
I very much learned-- so
Anna Wintour is my boss.

00:22:28.850 --> 00:22:30.530
And I very much
learned a lot from her

00:22:30.530 --> 00:22:32.690
in terms of decision-making.

00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:35.690
People always talk about she
is the most efficient woman

00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:36.510
in the world.

00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:38.855
I don't know how she does all
of her meetings every day.

00:22:38.855 --> 00:22:40.730
But I have definitely
noticed that if there's

00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:43.160
a meeting with her, and
it's set for half an hour,

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:44.940
it's done in about 10 minutes.

00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:46.830
So I've started to-- whoop--

00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:49.213
I've started to do that
also, and understanding

00:22:49.213 --> 00:22:50.630
just how much more
efficient I can

00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:52.820
be with my time, how
much more efficient

00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:56.990
I can be with decision-making,
not sitting on decisions all

00:22:56.990 --> 00:23:00.240
the time and being like, what
do you think, what do you think?

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:02.760
Like, obviously, I want
to hear people's opinions.

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:05.210
But I think there comes
a time where you just

00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:09.710
have to kind of pull the
trigger and do something.

00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:11.600
So, yeah, I think
learning management has

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:14.982
been a really big thing for me.

00:23:14.982 --> 00:23:16.440
What was the rest
of your question?

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:18.380
I feel like I had
another point about that.

00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:19.880
SPEAKER: The rest
of my question was

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:22.377
related to around other
strategies or habits--

00:23:22.377 --> 00:23:23.210
MICHELLE LEE: Right.

00:23:23.210 --> 00:23:24.668
SPEAKER: --that
you might have had,

00:23:24.668 --> 00:23:27.318
or any books or trainings that
you might have attended that

00:23:27.318 --> 00:23:28.860
could be shareable
with the audience.

00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:30.568
MICHELLE LEE: Yeah,
I think the big thing

00:23:30.568 --> 00:23:35.030
for me was understanding
that being a good manager

00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:39.977
and leadership is all
about being different, too.

00:23:39.977 --> 00:23:42.560
I don't know if it's something
about being Asian-American also

00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:43.792
maybe, but I think that--

00:23:43.792 --> 00:23:45.500
I've definitely thought
about this a lot,

00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:48.170
that when I was younger, I
just wanted to assimilate.

00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:51.350
So I grew up in a
very not-diverse town.

00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:54.890
And so my whole MO back then
was be like everyone else.

00:23:54.890 --> 00:23:57.410
I just want to fit in and
be like everyone else.

00:23:57.410 --> 00:23:59.460
And weirdly, in the
beginning of my career,

00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:02.540
I think that I kind of took
that same approach, where I was

00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:03.800
like, I would work in a job.

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:05.150
And I was like, I just want
to be like everyone else

00:24:05.150 --> 00:24:05.990
and fit in.

00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:08.240
So any of my ideas
that I had, I didn't

00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:11.420
want to do anything that
was too weird because I just

00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:14.720
want to fit in, when
actually, probably

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:16.850
like at the halfway
point of my career,

00:24:16.850 --> 00:24:19.320
I realized that I was doing
things completely wrong.

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:20.930
And here at Google,
I think you guys

00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:22.888
have a completely different
approach on things,

00:24:22.888 --> 00:24:25.400
where it is about standing
out and having ideas.

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:28.490
In certain worlds of media,
especially in fashion media,

00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:30.805
it was not that way whatsoever.

00:24:30.805 --> 00:24:32.930
But I always-- the advice
that I give to people now

00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:33.800
is stand out.

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:35.450
Be weird.

00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:37.550
Have kind of weird ideas.

00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:42.410
It truly is that thing that I
don't think like 10 years ago,

00:24:42.410 --> 00:24:44.990
because I was so sort of
stuck in this mindset of just

00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:47.080
fitting in, I don't
think that I would

00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:49.670
have gotten to where I am
now if I didn't start to take

00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:52.620
big risks, take big chances.

00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:54.980
And some of that comes
with being a leader

00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:57.650
and being given the
opportunity to do that.

00:24:57.650 --> 00:24:59.690
I'm lucky in that, like,
my bosses have given me

00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:01.920
that opportunity and the
runway to be like, it's OK.

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:02.420
Go ahead.

00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:03.795
They haven't said,
make mistakes,

00:25:03.795 --> 00:25:05.690
but they've said,
take big risks.

00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:08.776
And I took that as make
mistakes sometimes.

00:25:08.776 --> 00:25:10.700
But I think it's
important to stand out.

00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:12.950
Like I always talk about
people in our office

00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:14.990
who I call them
the quiet warriors.

00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:18.110
And that used to be me, where
I had this feeling that if you

00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:20.780
just put your head down and like
work, work, work, work, work,

00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:22.250
you're there 12 hours
a day, and you're

00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:24.417
going to prove to your boss
that you are the hardest

00:25:24.417 --> 00:25:25.250
worker there.

00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:27.080
In some cases that works.

00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:29.270
But I will say,
like the people who

00:25:29.270 --> 00:25:31.370
are better about
promoting themselves,

00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:33.447
they're good at
presenting in meetings,

00:25:33.447 --> 00:25:35.030
they have some of
those softer skills,

00:25:35.030 --> 00:25:37.723
too, it is so important.

00:25:37.723 --> 00:25:39.890
And I think, because of
like looking at my kids now,

00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:42.223
I think, nowadays they teach
kids like better presenting

00:25:42.223 --> 00:25:44.780
skills, how to do
things like that more,

00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:46.220
to think outside the box.

00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:49.812
But it very much was something
that I had to learn a lot.

00:25:49.812 --> 00:25:50.520
SPEAKER: Amazing.

00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:51.978
So I would love to
know, what is it

00:25:51.978 --> 00:25:55.115
like to work for Anna Wintour?

00:25:55.115 --> 00:25:56.240
MICHELLE LEE: It's amazing.

00:25:56.240 --> 00:26:00.320
Like I said, I have
learned so much from her.

00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:01.900
So do you guys
all know Eva Chen?

00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:06.563
OK, so Eva, my very first
day when I came to work

00:26:06.563 --> 00:26:09.230
at "Allure," and it was actually
my fourth time working at Condé

00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:09.730
Nast.

00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:13.290
But becoming an editor-in-chief
at "Allure" is a big deal.

00:26:13.290 --> 00:26:14.520
So I live in New Jersey.

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:16.640
And I was driving into
work my first day.

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:19.190
So Eva was like, call me,
because I'll give you,

00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:21.870
like, you know, advice
about how to do things.

00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:24.230
So she was the one
who first said to me,

00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:27.500
like, you're not going to have
a lot of small talk with Anna.

00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:30.230
But it's not because
she doesn't want to.

00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:32.540
It's that she is so busy.

00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:35.340
And she is the most
efficient woman in the world.

00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:38.790
So in emails, everything else,
you just get to the point.

00:26:38.790 --> 00:26:41.030
So again, like sometimes
I'm someone who

00:26:41.030 --> 00:26:42.850
I will write a lot in an email.

00:26:42.850 --> 00:26:45.230
But with her, I just know
to keep it short and sweet.

00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:47.300
And I think that
because of those things,

00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:48.770
and understanding
that in a meeting

00:26:48.770 --> 00:26:51.050
you have to just get your
point out right away,

00:26:51.050 --> 00:26:53.870
I actually feel like I've
learned so much from that.

00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:56.203
And I've learned a
lot from watching her.

00:26:56.203 --> 00:26:57.620
Her personality
and my personality

00:26:57.620 --> 00:27:00.020
are not necessarily
exactly the same.

00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:02.120
And I don't think that
that's necessarily, like,

00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:04.220
what she's looking for either.

00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:06.860
But I have learned so
much just about dealing

00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:10.460
with people, management, and
getting straight to the point.

00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:11.940
SPEAKER: Amazing.

00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:16.700
So as a very public
face of "Allure,"

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:20.000
what are three values that you
abide by or causes that you

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.280
work on outside of "Allure"?

00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:23.530
MICHELLE LEE: Ooh, causes.

00:27:23.530 --> 00:27:29.890
Well, I guess to answer
your first question,

00:27:29.890 --> 00:27:34.130
I guess like qualities--

00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:38.720
I feel like there is a feeling
of respect that, especially

00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:42.120
working at a brand that's within
the fashion and beauty space,

00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:48.020
I think that the stereotype,
I guess, of working in fashion

00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:50.540
was that it was very bitchy.

00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:52.790
And like people are mean
and backbiting and stuff.

00:27:52.790 --> 00:27:56.000
And, yes, it does exist
in certain places.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.900
I think for me, though, I have
always spent my entire career

00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:02.180
with this kind of dumb
belief sometimes, I guess,

00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:04.530
of where people should
be happy at work.

00:28:04.530 --> 00:28:06.715
And like I am just such
a huge believer in it,

00:28:06.715 --> 00:28:08.090
where people have
given me advice

00:28:08.090 --> 00:28:10.400
before about like you need
to go, like, Machiavellian

00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:12.380
on this person, and
do this, dah dah.

00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:15.050
I'm just a huge believer that
like if I just go like that,

00:28:15.050 --> 00:28:18.080
I do things with respect,
and like trust people,

00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:21.165
everything tends to
kind of work out fine.

00:28:21.165 --> 00:28:23.540
I think in terms of causes
that I'm really interested in,

00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:27.043
so last week I was at a
gala for Apex for Youth.

00:28:27.043 --> 00:28:28.210
Have you ever heard of this?

00:28:28.210 --> 00:28:28.450
SPEAKER: Mm-hm, yes.

00:28:28.450 --> 00:28:30.242
MICHELLE LEE: So Apex
for Youth is actually

00:28:30.242 --> 00:28:32.900
this great Asian-American
organization here in the city.

00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:35.210
And I have learned
so much from them,

00:28:35.210 --> 00:28:37.370
because I actually had
no idea until getting

00:28:37.370 --> 00:28:40.430
involved with them that
Asian-Americans actually

00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:43.520
have the highest poverty
rate here in the city.

00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:46.760
There are crazy statistics about
how I think Asian-Americans

00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:49.880
make up 13% of the
population here in the city

00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:53.600
but only get about
1% of the resources.

00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:55.490
There are a ton of kids who--

00:28:55.490 --> 00:28:56.870
I don't remember
the exact stats,

00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:59.570
but it's like a lot of them
are the only one who speaks

00:28:59.570 --> 00:29:00.900
English in their household.

00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:02.930
Like a lot of them
drop out of school.

00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:04.910
So I feel like in
the past three years,

00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:07.560
I've definitely gotten
involved in that quite a bit.

00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:10.023
And like I said, diversity
efforts in general,

00:29:10.023 --> 00:29:11.690
I think because of
everything that we've

00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:15.420
done at "Allure" in terms of
really promoting diversity,

00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:16.970
it is absolutely
the topic that I

00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:19.250
go out and talk about the most.

00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:21.260
And also the thing I
find really interesting

00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:23.420
is the more sort of
internal part of it, too.

00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:26.183
Like I've met with a lot
of diversity-and-inclusion

00:29:26.183 --> 00:29:28.100
directors for other
companies that we normally

00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:31.317
don't work with, like other,
like, consumer electronics

00:29:31.317 --> 00:29:32.150
and stuff like that.

00:29:32.150 --> 00:29:34.460
And I'm always
fascinated to hear

00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:36.087
about what people are doing.

00:29:36.087 --> 00:29:37.670
I met with someone
from, I want to say

00:29:37.670 --> 00:29:40.260
it was like Samsung and
another company also.

00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:42.260
And they were talking
about how they've actually

00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:44.500
started-- they've
stopped using the terms

00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:45.500
diversity and inclusion.

00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:47.990
And now internally they
just say belonging.

00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:51.120
And they explained to me about
how belonging is different.

00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:51.920
And I don't know.

00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:53.750
I'm just finding it
really fascinating

00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:57.590
watching what's happening to the
world in this super short span

00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:58.660
of time.

00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:00.410
SPEAKER: So if you
weren't editor-in-chief

00:30:00.410 --> 00:30:02.373
of "Allure," what else
would be your dream job?

00:30:02.373 --> 00:30:04.040
MICHELLE LEE: Well,
I used to always say

00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:06.960
when I was way too old to say
this, when people would say,

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:09.585
what do you want to be when you
grow up, I always said a baker.

00:30:09.585 --> 00:30:10.790
[CHUCKLES]

00:30:10.790 --> 00:30:13.040
I think when I was a little
kid, I really just enjoyed

00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:14.565
the fantasy of being a baker.

00:30:14.565 --> 00:30:16.190
And I thought I could
just wear the hat

00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:18.440
and like have fun all the time.

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:21.380
I was this weird
kid who, up until I

00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:23.600
was a sophomore in
college, I really

00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:25.280
didn't know what I wanted to do.

00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:26.780
People ask me all
the time, like did

00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:28.430
you know when you were a
little kid that you wanted

00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:29.870
to be an editor-in-chief?

00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:31.790
Not at all.

00:30:31.790 --> 00:30:34.103
I think once I chose
journalism, everything

00:30:34.103 --> 00:30:35.270
ended up falling into place.

00:30:35.270 --> 00:30:36.950
And then you look
back on your life,

00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:40.010
and everything
sort of made sense.

00:30:40.010 --> 00:30:42.440
I think that if I-- as I was
mentioning to you before,

00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:44.570
I'm obsessed with food.

00:30:44.570 --> 00:30:46.880
So I would either want to--

00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:50.300
I don't think I would actually
want to cook or bake, though.

00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:53.660
My dream job is really to
have, like, a travel show,

00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:56.240
where I just go around
and travel and eat.

00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:57.710
[CHUCKLES]

00:30:57.710 --> 00:31:00.050
SPEAKER: Is there a favorite
restaurant in New York

00:31:00.050 --> 00:31:01.430
or in the world?

00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:03.350
MICHELLE LEE: OK,
so in the world,

00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:05.485
we-- actually, my whole
family went to Europe,

00:31:05.485 --> 00:31:07.610
and we stayed for like a
couple of weeks last year.

00:31:07.610 --> 00:31:10.140
And we went to
Frenchie in Paris.

00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:12.140
And it was one of those
things where it was just

00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:13.790
an amazing experience.

00:31:13.790 --> 00:31:16.190
And like I love, love,
love traveling and eating.

00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:20.237
I also spent two weeks in
Japan this past summer.

00:31:20.237 --> 00:31:22.820
And it's hard to even say like
what my favorite restaurant was

00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:23.160
there.

00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:25.035
I think it's more of
the experience of going.

00:31:25.035 --> 00:31:27.680
And some of my favorite
meals-- this sounds so great--

00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:30.500
were actually just like,
you know, just stops

00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:33.188
and having like a little
like rice bowl or something.

00:31:33.188 --> 00:31:34.730
A lot of times, I
feel like it's just

00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:37.040
the overall experience of it.

00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:38.000
SPEAKER: Amazing.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.470
Well, actually, at this time--

00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:41.610
thank you, Michelle--
we're going

00:31:41.610 --> 00:31:43.580
to open the floor
for any questions

00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:45.560
that folks may
have for Michelle.

00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:48.860
So we do have two mics
on the right and left.

00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:51.692
And feel free to ask a
question if you have any.

00:31:51.692 --> 00:31:52.400
MICHELLE LEE: Hi.

00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:56.210
AUDIENCE: So my question is,
you mentioned that your--

00:31:56.210 --> 00:31:59.090
one of your objectives was
to turn "Allure" from being

00:31:59.090 --> 00:32:01.170
a magazine into a brand.

00:32:01.170 --> 00:32:04.758
So I was wondering, for the
content that is traditionally

00:32:04.758 --> 00:32:06.800
delivered through the
magazine, like the articles

00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:10.295
and the interviews, like whether
that will kind of-- the idea

00:32:10.295 --> 00:32:12.440
is for it to continue
to go through that,

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:15.470
or if like some of that will
be moved on to other platforms,

00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:18.213
and like what the role of the
magazine will be in the future?

00:32:18.213 --> 00:32:20.130
MICHELLE LEE: Yeah, no,
it's a great question.

00:32:20.130 --> 00:32:22.160
I think that for
us, the magazine

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:25.620
is still a really important
part of who we are.

00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:26.750
The great thing about--

00:32:26.750 --> 00:32:27.470
I mean, you guys all know.

00:32:27.470 --> 00:32:29.900
Like the media world right
now, it's like this, right?

00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:32.120
You hear about every
week practically

00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:34.940
there's some new website
going under, or being sold,

00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:36.648
or like a magazine is
going out of print.

00:32:36.648 --> 00:32:38.732
I think for us, though,
what's great is that we're

00:32:38.732 --> 00:32:39.890
part of the beauty world.

00:32:39.890 --> 00:32:43.670
And the beauty world is one
of the only growing sectors

00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:45.720
right now, especially
within retail,

00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:46.970
which I know you work in, too.

00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:49.490
Like, you know,
beauty has really

00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:52.070
been the one that's just sort
of like bucking all the trends.

00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:53.600
Whereas like other
brick-and-mortar stores

00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:55.880
are going out of business,
the Sephoras, and Ultas,

00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:57.338
and Credo Beauties,
and everything,

00:32:57.338 --> 00:32:59.725
like they're all
taking off like crazy.

00:32:59.725 --> 00:33:01.850
It's sort of the same thing
with us for print, too.

00:33:01.850 --> 00:33:05.030
I think that print, there is
such an interest in beauty

00:33:05.030 --> 00:33:07.580
right now that we're very
lucky in that it's really

00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:10.160
been like kind of
growing and stable.

00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:12.110
In terms of like platforms,
though, I actually

00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:13.997
think that they're
such different beasts.

00:33:13.997 --> 00:33:15.830
I always talk about
that with digital media,

00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:18.410
it's very much a sort of
like lean-forward experience,

00:33:18.410 --> 00:33:20.720
where you're reading
kind of quicker articles.

00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:22.850
You're watching videos
and other things.

00:33:22.850 --> 00:33:25.820
Still, to me, the print
experience is very lean-back.

00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:28.488
It's very much like you
always see people on airplanes

00:33:28.488 --> 00:33:30.030
and like at the
beach and everything.

00:33:30.030 --> 00:33:32.870
It's that time that you get to
just sort of like lean back.

00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:34.933
And it's such a
different experience.

00:33:34.933 --> 00:33:37.100
So I think that when we
think about creating content

00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:39.290
in that way, too, we
think about the magazine

00:33:39.290 --> 00:33:41.780
as that place where we can
do some more long reads.

00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:43.700
There's more
investigative journalism.

00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:45.260
There's more reporting there.

00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:47.662
There's more just
beautiful, big photography.

00:33:47.662 --> 00:33:49.370
And the other thing
that I think is still

00:33:49.370 --> 00:33:52.310
very important on so many
different levels is the cover.

00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:55.552
So I always say to people that
a magazine cover still matters.

00:33:55.552 --> 00:33:57.260
And you probably have
all seen that a lot

00:33:57.260 --> 00:33:59.510
of digital, native
brands are starting

00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:02.180
to do now digital
covers, because there's

00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:05.390
something about when you
pop that logo on a photo,

00:34:05.390 --> 00:34:07.130
it just means something.

00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:11.750
I think it sort of, it's like
the original form of curation,

00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:13.670
that it's saying,
this is the person,

00:34:13.670 --> 00:34:16.872
this is the story that you
should really pay attention to.

00:34:16.872 --> 00:34:18.830
So in terms of like
celebrities, everyone else,

00:34:18.830 --> 00:34:21.548
like that cover
still really matters.

00:34:21.548 --> 00:34:23.090
When we put Helen
Mirren on our cover

00:34:23.090 --> 00:34:26.210
when we banned the
term anti-aging,

00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:28.699
we could have done that
as a smaller story online.

00:34:28.699 --> 00:34:31.340
But the fact that we
made it a cover story

00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:34.260
and shot her for the cover had
so much more impact than that.

00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:36.409
So I definitely the magazine
is really important.

00:34:36.409 --> 00:34:37.672
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:34:37.672 --> 00:34:39.880
AUDIENCE: I've noticed this
happening a lot recently,

00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:41.929
where a lot of women
in their 20s and 30s

00:34:41.929 --> 00:34:43.520
are starting to
think about Botox.

00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:45.780
And I'm just curious,
your thoughts on that,

00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:47.840
the health risks,
and again, just kind

00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:49.760
of going back to
that term anti-aging,

00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:52.889
and what kind of that means with
Botox coming into play so early

00:34:52.889 --> 00:34:53.389
on.

00:34:53.389 --> 00:34:54.889
MICHELLE LEE: Yeah,
well, it's funny

00:34:54.889 --> 00:34:57.290
because after we
banned anti-aging,

00:34:57.290 --> 00:34:59.630
I think some people
took it as, does that

00:34:59.630 --> 00:35:02.510
mean that you guys are going
to stop talking about Botox,

00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:04.580
you're going to stop
doing things on skin care?

00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:07.100
I think for us, that was
totally not our intention.

00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:09.350
Like, for us, we are
very much whatever

00:35:09.350 --> 00:35:11.777
you want to do that makes
you happy is awesome.

00:35:11.777 --> 00:35:13.610
I think that for people
in their 20s and 30s

00:35:13.610 --> 00:35:17.030
who want to try Botox,
I think why not, right?

00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:19.610
I think that anything
that makes you happy,

00:35:19.610 --> 00:35:22.370
as long as it's something that's
actually driven by you and not

00:35:22.370 --> 00:35:25.040
by society saying,
this is what we think

00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:26.960
you need to do
because, uh-oh, you're

00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:30.320
getting some little fine lines
and wrinkles under there.

00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:31.443
I think that there is--

00:35:31.443 --> 00:35:33.110
I would say in your
20s and 30s, though,

00:35:33.110 --> 00:35:36.620
there's other skin care that
can probably do similar things

00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:37.980
at this point.

00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:40.350
Like I said, microneedling
is one of them.

00:35:40.350 --> 00:35:42.470
Definitely I've talked
to other people who

00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:45.830
because they don't want to do, I
don't know, four times of Botox

00:35:45.830 --> 00:35:48.980
a year, they're kind of willing
to try other things first.

00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:51.810
That would be my suggestion
is that a lot of it, frankly,

00:35:51.810 --> 00:35:54.537
in terms of like early
aging, is sun damage.

00:35:54.537 --> 00:35:56.120
I know there's been
a lot of like talk

00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:58.970
about the danger
of sunscreen now.

00:35:58.970 --> 00:36:01.070
But even just honestly
wearing a hat,

00:36:01.070 --> 00:36:02.570
or like when you
go to the beach,

00:36:02.570 --> 00:36:04.915
going under shade sometimes.

00:36:04.915 --> 00:36:06.290
Like seriously,
like anyone who's

00:36:06.290 --> 00:36:10.400
seen those, the images of
like sun damage on skin,

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:11.930
it is a real thing.

00:36:11.930 --> 00:36:14.117
When you go to Asia,
like every woman

00:36:14.117 --> 00:36:15.200
is wearing like a big hat.

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:17.060
She's got an umbrella
on a sunny day.

00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:19.070
Like we need to start
taking more care--

00:36:19.070 --> 00:36:20.180
maybe not that far, but--

00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:22.080
[CHUCKLES]

00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:23.030
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:24.488
AUDIENCE: When I
think of "Allure,"

00:36:24.488 --> 00:36:28.310
I always think industry
leader and, like, authentic.

00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:32.180
And whether it's in terms of
your diverse [INAUDIBLE] covers

00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:35.300
or the Best of Beauty
seal that you provide,

00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:40.250
one problem that I perceive
in the social media beauty

00:36:40.250 --> 00:36:43.490
industry right now is
these influencer-led

00:36:43.490 --> 00:36:47.510
direct-to-consumer brands, where
a lot of the content that I'm

00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:52.970
seeing today are ads by
DTC beauty companies, where

00:36:52.970 --> 00:36:56.150
someone or the other
has a really glorious,

00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:58.040
authentic review of the brand.

00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:00.230
And that, in itself,
is the ad, right?

00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:04.070
There is no other professionally
shot post or anything.

00:37:04.070 --> 00:37:08.450
I find that quite misleading
and also potentially dangerous.

00:37:08.450 --> 00:37:10.970
So as an industry
leader, do you feel

00:37:10.970 --> 00:37:13.310
like "Allure" has a
responsibility or a role

00:37:13.310 --> 00:37:17.480
to play to rectify
the situation here?

00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:19.730
MICHELLE LEE: I think that
it would probably take more

00:37:19.730 --> 00:37:22.630
than us to rectify
the situation,

00:37:22.630 --> 00:37:25.730
because you mentioned like diet
products in particular, right?

00:37:25.730 --> 00:37:29.150
AUDIENCE: Diet and,
in general, all sorts

00:37:29.150 --> 00:37:32.218
of corrective measures
in the beauty space.

00:37:32.218 --> 00:37:33.010
MICHELLE LEE: Yeah.

00:37:33.010 --> 00:37:34.635
AUDIENCE: Whether
it's teeth whitening,

00:37:34.635 --> 00:37:36.875
teeth straightening,
pores, so on and so forth.

00:37:36.875 --> 00:37:39.250
MICHELLE LEE: Yeah, I do think
that we have the authority

00:37:39.250 --> 00:37:40.390
to do that.

00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:42.850
I think that, again, like the
whole anti-aging thing really

00:37:42.850 --> 00:37:46.360
changed my viewpoint on how
we look at what our role is,

00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:49.222
that actually as the industry
leader, by us saying--

00:37:49.222 --> 00:37:50.930
like in my Editor's
Letter of that issue,

00:37:50.930 --> 00:37:52.430
I did a call to the
entire industry,

00:37:52.430 --> 00:37:55.640
saying, we call on you guys
to join us in this change.

00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:56.978
And I've thought about--

00:37:56.978 --> 00:37:58.270
this is sort of off the record.

00:37:58.270 --> 00:38:00.187
But I've thought about
doing something similar

00:38:00.187 --> 00:38:02.380
with sustainability, too,
that if us as a leader--

00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:06.070
like I don't think that a
beauty brand could say, hey,

00:38:06.070 --> 00:38:08.170
beauty industry, we want
you guys to join us.

00:38:08.170 --> 00:38:10.030
It's different coming from them.

00:38:10.030 --> 00:38:12.190
I think coming from
"Allure" to say,

00:38:12.190 --> 00:38:15.100
we're going to take this huge
step, we want you to join us,

00:38:15.100 --> 00:38:16.720
I think it does mean something.

00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:19.367
And similarly,
with diet products

00:38:19.367 --> 00:38:21.450
and also just sort of like
the ads and everything,

00:38:21.450 --> 00:38:24.190
I think it's a huge problem.

00:38:24.190 --> 00:38:27.040
I am hopeful that
consumers can kind of

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:28.130
see through those things.

00:38:28.130 --> 00:38:30.130
But I do wonder, ,
like what it's doing.

00:38:30.130 --> 00:38:32.740
And I, again, like think
about my son is 14.

00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:35.512
So I think for
14-year-olds in particular,

00:38:35.512 --> 00:38:36.970
especially like
with girls, there's

00:38:36.970 --> 00:38:39.178
so much that's targeted to
them that they don't fully

00:38:39.178 --> 00:38:41.500
understand yet
what's like sponsored

00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:44.440
and what's not sponsored.

00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:46.828
In terms of what we
could do about it,

00:38:46.828 --> 00:38:49.120
I don't think that it's
something that I've necessarily

00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:49.995
thought about before.

00:38:49.995 --> 00:38:51.690
But do you know Jameela Jamil?

00:38:51.690 --> 00:38:55.300
So, right, so she's been like
so outspoken as one person,

00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:57.390
saying, you guys,
stop doing this.

00:38:57.390 --> 00:38:59.530
So when I do look at
someone like her--

00:38:59.530 --> 00:39:03.958
and we actually, we featured
her as part of that, too--

00:39:03.958 --> 00:39:05.500
like I feel like
she is someone who's

00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:07.420
shown that even us
just like one person

00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:09.130
you can have an impact on that.

00:39:09.130 --> 00:39:11.170
So I don't know how to
answer it necessarily,

00:39:11.170 --> 00:39:13.670
because I don't think that we're
doing anything specifically

00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:15.018
related to that.

00:39:15.018 --> 00:39:16.060
I do think it's an issue.

00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:19.795
And at least on our own
platforms, like we--

00:39:19.795 --> 00:39:22.420
one of the big questions that I
always got when I first started

00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:25.085
was, how do you plan to compete
with influencers, right?

00:39:25.085 --> 00:39:27.460
Because when people think
about the beauty world, they do

00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:28.700
think about influencers now.

00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:31.750
There's a lot of brands who
are paying them a lot of money.

00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:33.820
A lot of them have
very big audiences.

00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:35.920
I think that we're such
a different animal.

00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:37.870
And I think that we
can actually co-exist.

00:39:37.870 --> 00:39:39.550
The big thing with
us, though, and which

00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:41.140
I think some of the
bigger influencers

00:39:41.140 --> 00:39:43.182
also are starting to adopt
some of these methods,

00:39:43.182 --> 00:39:45.700
is don't accept
money for something

00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:47.588
that you don't believe in.

00:39:47.588 --> 00:39:49.630
I think that for some of
the smaller influencers,

00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:52.900
or the ones who are just focused
on getting money probably,

00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:54.610
they maybe don't
understand that.

00:39:54.610 --> 00:39:57.220
But I always say to our
team, like there is no one,

00:39:57.220 --> 00:39:59.710
there's no brand who
can pay me to say

00:39:59.710 --> 00:40:02.070
that a product is the best.

00:40:02.070 --> 00:40:04.660
There's no brand that can pay
me to say I like a product,

00:40:04.660 --> 00:40:06.860
that I use a product
all the time.

00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:08.770
We definitely do branded
and sponsored posts.

00:40:08.770 --> 00:40:11.350
But I think there's a way
to do things that you still

00:40:11.350 --> 00:40:13.400
maintain your credibility.

00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:15.560
AUDIENCE: Have you--
just a follow-up to that,

00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:19.210
have you thought of like having
a certification for influencers

00:40:19.210 --> 00:40:23.290
in place, sort of saying that
these are the guidelines that

00:40:23.290 --> 00:40:25.830
influencers should
follow to be authentic,

00:40:25.830 --> 00:40:28.620
and here's a list of
influencers that "Allure"

00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:33.190
is working with who meet
these guidelines for brands,

00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:36.250
small and large,
to really follow,

00:40:36.250 --> 00:40:38.650
and for consumers to also
know that if it's coming from

00:40:38.650 --> 00:40:41.727
an "Allure"-certified
influencer, I am like--

00:40:41.727 --> 00:40:43.810
MICHELLE LEE: That's
actually a really great idea.

00:40:43.810 --> 00:40:45.772
We've thought about
similar things of,

00:40:45.772 --> 00:40:47.230
right now our Best
of Beauty awards

00:40:47.230 --> 00:40:48.650
are really just for products.

00:40:48.650 --> 00:40:51.520
So we have thought before
about do we, at some point,

00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:54.730
expand those awards to
include people, other things?

00:40:54.730 --> 00:40:56.175
That's a great idea, though.

00:40:56.175 --> 00:40:58.300
AUDIENCE: I'd love to hear
more about your thoughts

00:40:58.300 --> 00:41:03.070
on how "Allure" as a brand with
20-plus years of reputation

00:41:03.070 --> 00:41:07.090
as beauty experts can coexist
with this influx of beauty

00:41:07.090 --> 00:41:09.110
influencers and people
on YouTube, Instagram,

00:41:09.110 --> 00:41:11.610
Facebook, and social media
who, in their own way,

00:41:11.610 --> 00:41:13.690
people have been coming
to them perhaps because

00:41:13.690 --> 00:41:16.960
of a history of a lack
of diversity in print

00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:17.800
and in media.

00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:20.140
And YouTube, anyone
can be an influencer,

00:41:20.140 --> 00:41:24.640
and you can find someone who
really matches you, or works

00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:27.745
for, you know, your look,
your color, et cetera.

00:41:27.745 --> 00:41:29.620
And so, yeah, I'd love
to hear more about how

00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:31.552
you think about
coexisting in that space

00:41:31.552 --> 00:41:33.760
and not thinking about that
as kind of cannibalizing.

00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:35.720
MICHELLE LEE: Yeah, I
think it's two things.

00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:39.100
One, I see what our biggest
differentiating factor is,

00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:40.390
is expertise.

00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:43.150
So it's not only that we're
this collective of editors

00:41:43.150 --> 00:41:46.690
who literally see every single
product, we go to every show,

00:41:46.690 --> 00:41:50.780
we see every trend before
products even come out.

00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:53.560
So we have this built-in
expertise among our staff.

00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:56.050
But then we also have the
expertise of all the experts

00:41:56.050 --> 00:41:56.900
who we talk to.

00:41:56.900 --> 00:42:00.850
So dermatologists, plastic
surgeons, cosmetic chemists,

00:42:00.850 --> 00:42:01.930
medical doctors--

00:42:01.930 --> 00:42:03.305
you know, whoever
else, and we're

00:42:03.305 --> 00:42:05.390
talking to the best of
the best in the world.

00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:07.490
I think with influencers,
with most of them

00:42:07.490 --> 00:42:09.540
it comes from a place
of personal experience.

00:42:09.540 --> 00:42:10.510
And there's nothing
wrong with that.

00:42:10.510 --> 00:42:12.850
I definitely want, when I'm
looking at a product to buy

00:42:12.850 --> 00:42:14.980
or something else, I
want to hear the person's

00:42:14.980 --> 00:42:16.113
personal experience.

00:42:16.113 --> 00:42:17.530
But I think there's
also something

00:42:17.530 --> 00:42:20.740
really valuable with having
the science behind things,

00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:23.742
the broader scope of things,
understanding that actually

00:42:23.742 --> 00:42:25.700
that ingredient doesn't
mix well with that one,

00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:27.600
and you shouldn't use that.

00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:29.350
So I think that where
we have kind of like

00:42:29.350 --> 00:42:31.142
carved out a really
great niche for ourself

00:42:31.142 --> 00:42:34.490
has been that feeling of
expertise and authority.

00:42:34.490 --> 00:42:36.053
But then the other
thing was, too,

00:42:36.053 --> 00:42:37.720
when I started at
"Allure," I always say

00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:40.060
like I really didn't know
a lot of the editors.

00:42:40.060 --> 00:42:42.010
I think now with social
media and everything,

00:42:42.010 --> 00:42:43.990
like I follow a lot of editors.

00:42:43.990 --> 00:42:47.800
I feel like the dictate
at "Allure" was very much,

00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:49.930
we write from the
royal we, right?

00:42:49.930 --> 00:42:51.790
You're writing as
"Allure" the brand.

00:42:51.790 --> 00:42:52.640
You're not "Allure."

00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:55.120
You're not Jenny Bailly, who's
our executive beauty director.

00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:56.703
You're not writing
from Jenny's voice.

00:42:56.703 --> 00:42:58.330
You're writing from
the "Allure" voice.

00:42:58.330 --> 00:43:00.220
I very much wanted to
tear down those walls,

00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:02.802
because I do think that beauty
is personal, that as you were

00:43:02.802 --> 00:43:04.260
saying before about
like diversity,

00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:06.730
like because of YouTube and
social media and everything

00:43:06.730 --> 00:43:08.770
else, you do kind of want
to connect to somebody

00:43:08.770 --> 00:43:11.780
and understand, OK, this
person has hair like mine.

00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:14.410
This person has
dry skin like mine.

00:43:14.410 --> 00:43:17.470
So I very much wanted to make
sure that people understood

00:43:17.470 --> 00:43:19.228
who is behind the brand, too.

00:43:19.228 --> 00:43:21.520
So in the "Allure" Beauty
Box, for example, we actually

00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:25.030
just started doing this, where
the reviews in our little mini

00:43:25.030 --> 00:43:28.000
magazine that we put in each box
used to be written in the royal

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.120
we, where it would just be
sort of the "Allure" voice.

00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:34.810
But we've actually now started
putting little editor photos

00:43:34.810 --> 00:43:35.723
with each of them.

00:43:35.723 --> 00:43:37.390
And it's written from
that first person.

00:43:37.390 --> 00:43:40.270
So you understand that,
like, if Gabby did a review,

00:43:40.270 --> 00:43:42.790
Gabby is talking about it from
her own personal experience

00:43:42.790 --> 00:43:44.920
as an editor and as an expert.

00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:47.560
But also, you can
understand, oh, OK, great,

00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:48.760
she's just like me.

00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:51.260
You know, I understand that
this is her personal experience.

00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:55.180
So I feel like it's
such a different thing.

00:43:55.180 --> 00:43:57.630
And we do work with
some influencers, too.

00:43:57.630 --> 00:44:00.115
I think for a long
time, there were

00:44:00.115 --> 00:44:02.240
editors who kind of didn't
really like influencers.

00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:04.365
They thought like, oh, who
are these people sitting

00:44:04.365 --> 00:44:06.520
front row at Fashion
Week and blah blah blah?

00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:08.380
I actually have a
totally different belief.

00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:10.690
I think that there are
great ones out there

00:44:10.690 --> 00:44:11.810
who we can work with.

00:44:11.810 --> 00:44:13.810
We've done really great
partnerships with people

00:44:13.810 --> 00:44:15.110
before.

00:44:15.110 --> 00:44:17.710
And it can be sort of this,
like, mutually beneficial

00:44:17.710 --> 00:44:18.702
thing.

00:44:18.702 --> 00:44:21.160
AUDIENCE: Thank you for talking
about the new brands coming

00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:26.758
in to the cosmetics space
for gender inclusivity.

00:44:26.758 --> 00:44:28.300
I guess my question
is, as an editor,

00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:30.467
when you're thinking about
an article on those types

00:44:30.467 --> 00:44:35.020
of brands or items to put
in an "Allure" box, what

00:44:35.020 --> 00:44:38.470
do you think makes one brand
better than another, other

00:44:38.470 --> 00:44:41.860
than like an authentic brand
message around inclusion?

00:44:41.860 --> 00:44:44.448
Just like what's the difference
between formulation and--

00:44:44.448 --> 00:44:45.240
MICHELLE LEE: Yeah.

00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:46.240
AUDIENCE: --colors for--

00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:47.300
MICHELLE LEE: It's a lot.

00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:48.880
I will tell you,
because I'm heavily

00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:53.100
in testing right now for
Best of Beauty awards,

00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:57.145
I'm shocked sometimes by how
many bad products there are.

00:44:57.145 --> 00:44:59.843
Like I think that as we're
testing these like thousands

00:44:59.843 --> 00:45:02.260
and thousands of products, it
actually makes me really sad

00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:04.120
that people spend
money on products

00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:06.560
that are just not good.

00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:10.630
So I think instantly, we're
able to really determine quickly

00:45:10.630 --> 00:45:12.010
like what's bad, right?

00:45:12.010 --> 00:45:13.390
But then let's
say if you're left

00:45:13.390 --> 00:45:16.160
with like 20 eyeliners or
something that you're like,

00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:19.660
OK, these are really good,
it's a lot of testing.

00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:21.728
If it's skin care, we
go to a lot of experts,

00:45:21.728 --> 00:45:23.770
and we talk about, you
know, it's not necessarily

00:45:23.770 --> 00:45:24.560
the ingredients.

00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:28.763
But it's also looking at
the amounts of ingredients,

00:45:28.763 --> 00:45:30.430
because sometimes
people think like, oh,

00:45:30.430 --> 00:45:33.127
if it's 100% hyaluronic
acid, it must be better.

00:45:33.127 --> 00:45:34.210
Actually, that's not true.

00:45:34.210 --> 00:45:36.670
Like if you talk to a chemist,
and they're like, actually,

00:45:36.670 --> 00:45:39.640
the optimal percentage
is going to be this,

00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:42.970
we get very, very nerdy about
some of these ingredient

00:45:42.970 --> 00:45:43.623
things.

00:45:43.623 --> 00:45:45.790
So I think it's a lot of
research with those things.

00:45:45.790 --> 00:45:48.730
And also, like the
biggest thing is,

00:45:48.730 --> 00:45:51.190
I think you mentioned
the word authenticity.

00:45:51.190 --> 00:45:53.550
Fenty Beauty obviously
had a big year,

00:45:53.550 --> 00:45:56.730
like big couple of years
where they really did

00:45:56.730 --> 00:45:58.585
disrupt the beauty industry.

00:45:58.585 --> 00:46:00.210
When they came out
of the gate and they

00:46:00.210 --> 00:46:03.540
had those 40 shades
of foundation,

00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:04.720
it was a huge statement.

00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:06.720
There were other brands
at the time, though, who

00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:08.830
said, well, that's nothing new.

00:46:08.830 --> 00:46:11.960
We started out, and we had
a diverse shade range also.

00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:13.710
But I think what was
different about Fenty

00:46:13.710 --> 00:46:16.140
was that the diversity
message wasn't just,

00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:18.630
here's 40 colors
on our Instagram.

00:46:18.630 --> 00:46:20.280
The diversity-and-inclusion
message

00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:22.410
was woven through every
single thing that they did.

00:46:22.410 --> 00:46:26.340
So every single photo, every
video, everything that they do,

00:46:26.340 --> 00:46:27.610
it's all interwoven in that.

00:46:27.610 --> 00:46:30.420
And I think that nowadays,
the consumer is kind of savvy.

00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:31.680
And they understand that--

00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:34.982
like for those six to eight
months after Fenty came out,

00:46:34.982 --> 00:46:36.690
there were a ton of
other brands who were

00:46:36.690 --> 00:46:38.190
like, we now have 40 shades.

00:46:38.190 --> 00:46:39.582
We now have 40 shades.

00:46:39.582 --> 00:46:40.290
And that's great.

00:46:40.290 --> 00:46:42.040
And I think it's been
an amazing movement.

00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:43.620
But I do think that
the consumer can

00:46:43.620 --> 00:46:45.720
kind of tell when there's
like a true authenticity

00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:46.890
behind things.

00:46:46.890 --> 00:46:49.050
And brands have to be able
to follow through on it,

00:46:49.050 --> 00:46:50.967
too, because I think one
of the big complaints

00:46:50.967 --> 00:46:54.350
has been even though a brand
will say they have 40 shades,

00:46:54.350 --> 00:46:56.280
if you then go to the
store, they actually

00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:58.320
don't stock the darker shades.

00:46:58.320 --> 00:46:59.550
So it does come in.

00:46:59.550 --> 00:47:00.720
People talk, right?

00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:02.160
Like influencers talk.

00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:03.960
Reviews talk.

00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:07.260
People will understand pretty
quickly if you are not really

00:47:07.260 --> 00:47:08.960
the real deal.

00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:11.460
AUDIENCE: I've worked here as
a product marketer and a brand

00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:12.150
marketer.

00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:14.160
And my line of work
has me thinking

00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:16.260
a lot about the relationship
between dark skin

00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:18.280
and technology these days.

00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:19.780
From a machine-learning
perspective,

00:47:19.780 --> 00:47:22.720
from a camera-vision
perspective, how do you--

00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:25.470
we've seen that manufacturers
in different parts of the world

00:47:25.470 --> 00:47:29.760
will sometimes express or
build in cultural preference

00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:31.330
into the way that
technology works.

00:47:31.330 --> 00:47:33.960
So in India, you
see skin lightening.

00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:36.480
In China, you see
skin whitening.

00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:40.050
How do you deal with the
relationship between trend

00:47:40.050 --> 00:47:43.620
and cultural preference
and morality, I guess,

00:47:43.620 --> 00:47:46.800
and kind of what
is a good standard?

00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:50.490
MICHELLE LEE: My
take on it is that I

00:47:50.490 --> 00:47:54.630
think that for people in a
position of authority of mine,

00:47:54.630 --> 00:48:00.910
let's say, in media, I
think that morality is key.

00:48:00.910 --> 00:48:02.430
I think that
sometimes, for example,

00:48:02.430 --> 00:48:06.840
we've done covers in the past
where I think because diversity

00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:08.620
has been such an
important thing to me

00:48:08.620 --> 00:48:11.160
and to the brand,
which if you looked

00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:15.510
at the newsstand sales of that
issue, it wasn't a big winner.

00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:17.970
At the same time, I kind
of don't care, right?

00:48:17.970 --> 00:48:21.510
I actually think that as a
larger mission, you know,

00:48:21.510 --> 00:48:23.700
magazine sales used
to always be like what

00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:24.750
are your newsstand sales?

00:48:24.750 --> 00:48:26.310
And that drove what
was the success

00:48:26.310 --> 00:48:28.030
or the failure of anything.

00:48:28.030 --> 00:48:31.450
I think that I look at it
now as success is overall

00:48:31.450 --> 00:48:34.170
what we're doing, how we're
growing, but also what

00:48:34.170 --> 00:48:37.260
we're doing with society and
how we're changing things.

00:48:37.260 --> 00:48:38.490
When I look back at how--

00:48:38.490 --> 00:48:40.323
I actually really do
think that we've pushed

00:48:40.323 --> 00:48:41.500
the needle in a lot of ways.

00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:43.720
I think just even from my
own personal experience,

00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:45.220
I think that the
morality part of it

00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:46.320
is always going to be key.

00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:47.903
AUDIENCE: Can I ask
a quick follow-up?

00:48:47.903 --> 00:48:49.850
So if your back is
against the wall,

00:48:49.850 --> 00:48:52.260
and you have to justify
a decision like that,

00:48:52.260 --> 00:48:54.890
how does that conversation
go [INAUDIBLE]??

00:48:54.890 --> 00:48:56.640
MICHELLE LEE: I'm very
lucky, like I said,

00:48:56.640 --> 00:49:00.000
in that my bosses,
diversity for them

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:01.920
is such a core mission, too.

00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:05.580
I have never had a problem
with pushing forward anything.

00:49:05.580 --> 00:49:11.230
So I'm actually on the Diversity
Council of our company as well.

00:49:11.230 --> 00:49:13.260
And I think that,
unfortunately, I

00:49:13.260 --> 00:49:15.180
do know it's not like
that at every company.

00:49:15.180 --> 00:49:19.290
I think I just personally am
sort of lucky that I have that.

00:49:19.290 --> 00:49:22.380
I think that it is
kind of understanding

00:49:22.380 --> 00:49:26.610
who your allies are, too, that
luckily, at my own company,

00:49:26.610 --> 00:49:28.890
most of the executives are
actually on the Diversity

00:49:28.890 --> 00:49:29.910
Council, too.

00:49:29.910 --> 00:49:31.768
So even if it's
like a key moment,

00:49:31.768 --> 00:49:34.310
you know, that like they have
to make a decision or whatever,

00:49:34.310 --> 00:49:36.810
like I think that they now
have trust in certain people.

00:49:36.810 --> 00:49:38.920
And they understand
like the broader goals

00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:41.080
and like how this is really
good for us as a whole,

00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:44.690
as an industry, but also as
society to do these things.

00:49:44.690 --> 00:49:46.440
I think a lot of times,
though, it is hard

00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:49.680
because I know other people who
don't work in that environment.

00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:52.140
It is finding your
allies and kind

00:49:52.140 --> 00:49:54.502
of going as like a
group of people, too.

00:49:54.502 --> 00:49:55.210
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:49:55.210 --> 00:49:58.117
AUDIENCE: I deliver mental
health services here at Google.

00:49:58.117 --> 00:49:59.700
So I'm wondering--
which is very, very

00:49:59.700 --> 00:50:01.210
unusual for my career.

00:50:01.210 --> 00:50:04.350
So I'm wondering, in the space
of beauty that's women-heavy,

00:50:04.350 --> 00:50:06.660
what kind of services
are offered as a benefit

00:50:06.660 --> 00:50:08.160
to your staff, to--

00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:09.990
you've got major,
major challenges

00:50:09.990 --> 00:50:14.250
to deliver, both deliver
services and deliver confidence

00:50:14.250 --> 00:50:15.785
and beauty, as people are.

00:50:15.785 --> 00:50:17.160
So what are you
doing about that?

00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:18.355
MICHELLE LEE: Well, I want
mental health services.

00:50:18.355 --> 00:50:18.700
I don't know.

00:50:18.700 --> 00:50:19.200
[CHUCKLING]

00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:20.820
AUDIENCE: Uh-huh.

00:50:20.820 --> 00:50:23.580
MICHELLE LEE: Our services are
not necessarily mental health.

00:50:23.580 --> 00:50:27.940
But for our staff, we have a
lot of beauty services, frankly.

00:50:27.940 --> 00:50:30.918
We've got like a brow
person who comes in.

00:50:30.918 --> 00:50:31.710
It's more sort of--

00:50:31.710 --> 00:50:33.210
AUDIENCE: Well,
that's more external

00:50:33.210 --> 00:50:36.630
and that, you know, that, I
mean, not that it's not good,

00:50:36.630 --> 00:50:41.460
but that there's also a need for
women to be internally happy.

00:50:41.460 --> 00:50:44.040
And folks who come from
different backgrounds, folks

00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:48.048
of color often have some
internal unbeautiful feelings.

00:50:48.048 --> 00:50:48.840
MICHELLE LEE: Yeah.

00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:49.340
So--

00:50:49.340 --> 00:50:52.500
AUDIENCE: And so I just wonder,
I've got to-- that's what I do.

00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:55.410
So I always wonder about
the internal beauty.

00:50:55.410 --> 00:51:00.060
And when we look at things
in women, like, you know,

00:51:00.060 --> 00:51:03.210
I can see the beauty that
comes from external, both bath

00:51:03.210 --> 00:51:04.630
gel, brows, makeup.

00:51:04.630 --> 00:51:08.220
But when they sit before
me, they're cutting,

00:51:08.220 --> 00:51:10.350
they're not eating,
they're drinking too much.

00:51:10.350 --> 00:51:13.680
And they can be very successful
in any place in their life.

00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:16.920
But they're really damaging
themselves or damaging families

00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:19.437
by lack of emotional
intelligence.

00:51:19.437 --> 00:51:20.770
And then they don't make great--

00:51:20.770 --> 00:51:22.290
they're not a great
team member when

00:51:22.290 --> 00:51:23.520
they're before you
because they're

00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:24.660
doing all this other stuff.

00:51:24.660 --> 00:51:27.450
They've got great
brows, and that's good.

00:51:27.450 --> 00:51:30.330
But there's some-- so
I'm just wondering.

00:51:30.330 --> 00:51:30.830
Is there--

00:51:30.830 --> 00:51:31.590
MICHELLE LEE: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:51:31.590 --> 00:51:33.257
So at our larger
company, actually, this

00:51:33.257 --> 00:51:35.040
is a somewhat newer
thing this past year.

00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:37.720
So we've actually launched
a bunch of groups.

00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:41.130
One has been a Latinx group.

00:51:41.130 --> 00:51:43.890
One is a women's network,
which just launched probably

00:51:43.890 --> 00:51:44.850
about six months ago.

00:51:44.850 --> 00:51:47.670
And I'm actually the executive
sponsor of the women's network.

00:51:47.670 --> 00:51:50.522
So within a lot of these smaller
groups within Condé Nast,

00:51:50.522 --> 00:51:52.980
these are actually some of
those things that are happening.

00:51:52.980 --> 00:51:54.270
We'll do other events.

00:51:54.270 --> 00:51:57.150
There's smaller
mentorship programs,

00:51:57.150 --> 00:51:59.340
not necessarily always
talking about mental health.

00:51:59.340 --> 00:52:03.060
But I do think that feeling like
there's a community of people

00:52:03.060 --> 00:52:05.260
within your own company
is really helpful, too,

00:52:05.260 --> 00:52:08.395
and being able to know people
within other departments that

00:52:08.395 --> 00:52:10.020
you can talk to who
are not necessarily

00:52:10.020 --> 00:52:13.085
your direct manager, or they're
not a colleague of yours,

00:52:13.085 --> 00:52:14.460
I think, has been
really helpful.

00:52:14.460 --> 00:52:17.337
But, yes, I would love to have
mental health services, too.

00:52:17.337 --> 00:52:18.920
AUDIENCE:
Employee-assistance program.

00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:19.970
It's a great idea.

00:52:19.970 --> 00:52:22.138
And so is all that other
stuff you're doing.

00:52:22.138 --> 00:52:23.430
Thanks for the diversity space.

00:52:23.430 --> 00:52:25.517
I opened your magazine
in the nail salon,

00:52:25.517 --> 00:52:27.100
and I saw someone
that looked like me.

00:52:27.100 --> 00:52:29.910
So for folks that are
older and younger, but they

00:52:29.910 --> 00:52:32.388
see hues that are like
them, they get some trust

00:52:32.388 --> 00:52:34.680
because they know that you
understand, that you get us,

00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:37.040
and you value us as
beautiful persons.

00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:38.290
MICHELLE LEE: Well, thank you.

00:52:38.290 --> 00:52:39.082
SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:52:39.082 --> 00:52:40.200
We have one more time--

00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:42.000
time for only one more question.

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:42.660
Yes.

00:52:42.660 --> 00:52:43.493
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:52:43.493 --> 00:52:45.840
Thank you both for being here.

00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:47.580
A lot of people in
their 20s and 30s

00:52:47.580 --> 00:52:50.310
spend time trying to build
an identity as they enter

00:52:50.310 --> 00:52:54.510
into the workforce, especially
in industries where they're not

00:52:54.510 --> 00:52:56.140
fully represented all the time.

00:52:56.140 --> 00:52:58.910
And they reconcile how to
fit in while also trying

00:52:58.910 --> 00:53:01.780
to be true to who they are.

00:53:01.780 --> 00:53:04.050
And so I'm curious to hear
from your perspective,

00:53:04.050 --> 00:53:07.130
how did you build your identity
and grow into that confidence

00:53:07.130 --> 00:53:09.020
of being who you are?

00:53:09.020 --> 00:53:12.110
MICHELLE LEE: Yeah, like I
said, it was not always there.

00:53:12.110 --> 00:53:16.730
I think that my personality
is actually pretty reserved.

00:53:16.730 --> 00:53:18.620
I was definitely
someone in, like when

00:53:18.620 --> 00:53:22.820
I was a junior editor, who I got
very nervous at pitching ideas

00:53:22.820 --> 00:53:23.933
in meetings and stuff.

00:53:23.933 --> 00:53:26.350
At a certain point, though,
like even something like this,

00:53:26.350 --> 00:53:28.225
like people always talk
about like, you know,

00:53:28.225 --> 00:53:29.060
public speaking.

00:53:29.060 --> 00:53:31.070
I had the hardest
time public speaking.

00:53:31.070 --> 00:53:35.330
Like in college, I actually,
I had a terrible phobia of it.

00:53:35.330 --> 00:53:38.190
And it's just something that you
end up having to work through.

00:53:38.190 --> 00:53:41.300
I think for me, though,
coming up with my own identity

00:53:41.300 --> 00:53:43.760
within the workspace,
it was just

00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:45.480
finding that
confidence in myself

00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:48.570
that, like, if I had ideas, and
they were sort of a bit weird

00:53:48.570 --> 00:53:50.660
and outside the
box, that it was OK.

00:53:50.660 --> 00:53:53.330
I actually also weirdly think
that social media has helped me

00:53:53.330 --> 00:53:57.650
with that, because having
a persona on social media,

00:53:57.650 --> 00:53:59.180
like it actually helps me.

00:53:59.180 --> 00:54:01.920
In my daily job, once
you become a manager,

00:54:01.920 --> 00:54:03.632
you're not always
a creator anymore.

00:54:03.632 --> 00:54:05.090
And I think that
I missed something

00:54:05.090 --> 00:54:07.830
about the act of
creating all the time.

00:54:07.830 --> 00:54:11.420
So now, it's not even part of
my job, but now I'll do videos,

00:54:11.420 --> 00:54:14.948
or I'll do other content that's
just for my own Instagram.

00:54:14.948 --> 00:54:16.490
And I feel like it's
helping to serve

00:54:16.490 --> 00:54:18.650
not only like that
creative hunger

00:54:18.650 --> 00:54:21.080
that I'm having, but I also
do feel like it's helping

00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:23.970
to define my identity
within the workspace,

00:54:23.970 --> 00:54:26.600
but also within the beauty
industry as a whole.

00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:28.725
Like when I was talking
before about like how we're

00:54:28.725 --> 00:54:30.290
different from
influencers, someone

00:54:30.290 --> 00:54:32.510
asked me in another
panel, would you

00:54:32.510 --> 00:54:34.010
call yourself an influencer?

00:54:34.010 --> 00:54:36.110
And I was like, oh, no,
I'm not an influencer.

00:54:36.110 --> 00:54:38.210
But they were like,
you actually are.

00:54:38.210 --> 00:54:40.190
I think it's just that
the word influencer has

00:54:40.190 --> 00:54:41.840
gotten a strange connotation.

00:54:41.840 --> 00:54:44.240
But I do actually think
I'm an influencer in that

00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:47.150
certain things I do, or products
that I talk about, or getting

00:54:47.150 --> 00:54:49.430
my brows microbladed,
I instantly

00:54:49.430 --> 00:54:52.135
have people messaging
me saying, oh,

00:54:52.135 --> 00:54:53.510
because you wrote
about that, I'm

00:54:53.510 --> 00:54:55.770
actually going to try that now.

00:54:55.770 --> 00:54:57.770
So I think that it's
helped me, weirdly,

00:54:57.770 --> 00:55:00.530
as I've been working out
what to post on social media,

00:55:00.530 --> 00:55:02.420
and what I want the
world to know about me,

00:55:02.420 --> 00:55:06.103
it's actually helped me
define who I am, too.

00:55:06.103 --> 00:55:08.020
SPEAKER: That's actually
how I found Michelle.

00:55:08.020 --> 00:55:09.770
I was admiring her
from afar on Instagram.

00:55:09.770 --> 00:55:12.310
And I slid into her DMs and
was like, hey, Michelle,

00:55:12.310 --> 00:55:14.140
would you like to
come talk at Google?

00:55:14.140 --> 00:55:14.690
MICHELLE LEE: I was like, yes.

00:55:14.690 --> 00:55:15.940
SPEAKER: You're an influencer.

00:55:15.940 --> 00:55:17.350
You're an influencer, for sure.

00:55:17.350 --> 00:55:19.420
Well, there's copies
of the magazine

00:55:19.420 --> 00:55:21.910
in the very back
for all those who

00:55:21.910 --> 00:55:23.512
may want to grab one
on their way out.

00:55:23.512 --> 00:55:24.720
Thank you so much, Michelle--

00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:25.170
MICHELLE LEE: Thank you.

00:55:25.170 --> 00:55:26.503
SPEAKER: --for being here today.

00:55:26.503 --> 00:55:29.390
[APPLAUSE]
