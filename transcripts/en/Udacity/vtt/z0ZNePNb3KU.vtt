Okay--the first tag we're going to learn about is the b tag.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
And it looks like this: it's got an opening b and a closing b,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.000
there's our closing slash.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And anything that appears inside the b tag appears bold.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
So this is b for bold.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Pretty simple tag.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Let's play around with this in the HTML editor a little bit.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Here we are--we've got this--you know--

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000
this plain text that we typed in before.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Let's make one of these words bold.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Okay--so I took the word love and I preceded it

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.147
by an opening tag and a closing tag,

00:00:33.147 --> 00:00:36.509
and when we click update here, updates this

00:00:36.509 --> 00:00:38.632
the word love is now in bold

00:00:38.632 --> 00:00:40.456
pretty simple

00:00:40.456 --> 00:00:42.446
quiz time - In the box below

00:00:42.446 --> 00:00:46.817
make the words reasonably straight forward appear bold
