00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.180
I think it's time we got explicit about the

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:06.340
physical processes that lead to genetic variability and the physical

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.550
passing on of our genes. Now if you want to

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.740
have your own biological children, there's a pretty important event

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.167
that must precede the presence of children. instead of thinking

00:00:16.167 --> 00:00:18.675
of you having your own children lets just think about

00:00:18.675 --> 00:00:22.560
you, right. Here I am pretty happy, 30 years old.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.580
But where did I come from? About 30 years ago,

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.220
I was in my mother's womb developing as an

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.240
embryo and then fetus. But where did I come from

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.750
before that? About nine months before I was born, I

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.340
was conceived meaning that the sex cells from my parents,

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.940
the sperm fertilized the egg and I received my

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.354
very first cell with a full genome. Half from mom,

00:00:44.354 --> 00:00:47.720
half from dad. And of course about 30 minutes to

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.990
one full day before conception, there was a pretty important

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.590
physical interaction my biological mother and biological father

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.510
had to go through, the act of sexual intercourse.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.830
For me to be here today, standing here, teaching

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.330
this course to you. All three of these previous

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.970
events must have happened. My parents must have found

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.570
each other and exchanged sex cells. They must have

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.060
had a successful fertilization of these sex cells. And

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.050
they must have had a successful development in utero,

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.490
or growing in my mother's womb. Now while I owe a lot to my mom and dad for

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.670
bringing me into this world, I really owe their

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.100
sex cells. Or what we call gametes. Gametes are

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.790
either sperm or eggs, sperm in male, eggs in

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.320
females. And germ cells make gametes. Germ cells are

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.500
the precursors to the sex cells. And in this

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.950
case the word germ. Doesn't mean germ like bacteria

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.110
it means germ like germination, like a flower.

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.020
The cells that make our gametes are called

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.740
germ cells because they are the seed for

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.850
our germination. So understanding how germ cells make

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.450
gamete is a really critical component to understanding

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.550
which alleles you're going to get from which parent.

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:02.670
Let's talk a little bit more about how

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.710
that process of cell division is going to occur.
