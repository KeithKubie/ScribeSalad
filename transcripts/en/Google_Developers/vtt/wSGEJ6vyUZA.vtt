KORY JEFFREY: Welcome everybody.

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.120
We're on site at Founder
World in San Francisco.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.420
I'm joined in the studio
today by Kris Gale, co-founder

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:09.579
of Clover Health.

00:00:09.579 --> 00:00:10.870
Kris, thank you for joining me.

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:11.253
KRIS GALE: Hi, yeah.

00:00:11.253 --> 00:00:12.020
Thanks for having me.

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.478
KORY JEFFREY: So we were talking
just before camera started

00:00:14.478 --> 00:00:15.980
rolling about the
really cool stuff

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.790
that you're doing in
the health care space.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.580
Can you kind of elaborate
what Clover Health is and some

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.290
of the innovations that
you're bringing to the market.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:23.456
KRIS GALE: Yeah, absolutely.

00:00:23.456 --> 00:00:26.390
So Clover Health is a
health insurance startup.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:27.850
But what we're
doing is using data

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:31.480
about our members to figure out
the specific moments in time

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.180
where we have an opportunity
to intervene in their care,

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.850
and actually prevent them
from having adverse health

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.315
consequences down the road.

00:00:38.315 --> 00:00:40.190
So for things like, if
we have a member who's

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:41.970
managing a chronic
disease-- say,

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.670
congestive heart failure--
we're looking for opportunities

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.890
for specific care
follow ups, or tests,

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.210
or interventions with
the member that we know

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.830
will reduce their probability
of having all the adverse health

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.342
consequences that are
associated with that disease.

00:00:57.342 --> 00:00:58.800
KORY JEFFREY: So
for the developers

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.720
who are watching,
how does that work?

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:01.540
How do you do that?

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.730
KRIS GALE: Yeah, so we take
all these raw data points--

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:04.855
we're an insurance company.

00:01:04.855 --> 00:01:06.860
So we can see historical claims.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.210
Claims have diagnoses
associated with them, treatments

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:11.440
and procedures.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.810
And they're all
encoded as numbers.

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.770
So then we have to match those
up through concept ontologies

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.050
to be able to say, this
person took this drug.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.630
We know this to be an
oral diabetes medication.

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:23.650
Or they had this test.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.490
And we know that
it's an indication

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.750
of how well they've controlled
their blood sugar up

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:28.700
to this point.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.170
And then we can
say, OK, well now

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.580
we can assemble a clinical
profile of the person who

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.430
has all those raw data
points associated with them.

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.600
So we know this is, for example,
a high risk type 2 diabetic.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.020
And we know the appropriate
clinical standards

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.274
for managing that disease.

00:01:44.274 --> 00:01:45.940
And we can see the
care they're actually

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.030
receiving from their doctors,
hospitals, specialists.

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.340
And we can identify
the missing pieces,

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.480
and then go out with our own
staff of nurse practitioners.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.370
And while they're in that
encounter with that member,

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:00.220
they're using applications
that we've written to say,

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.800
while you're interacting
with this member,

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.160
make sure you do this one thing.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.870
Because we know the quantitative
effect on their health

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.990
probabilities for you
filling this care gap

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:12.492
at this moment in time.

00:02:12.492 --> 00:02:13.950
KORY JEFFREY: So
that obviously has

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.217
a lot of upside
for the individual,

00:02:16.217 --> 00:02:18.550
but also seems to have a lot
of upside for the insurance

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:19.659
company as well.

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:20.700
KRIS GALE: Yeah, exactly.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.550
And that's why we chose to
do this as a health insurance

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.730
company, because we're
on the hook for paying

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.020
for really expensive
hospitalizations

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.060
if they happen.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.990
So our financial incentives
are aligned with the health

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.360
incentives of our members.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.480
And as we're improving
their quality of life,

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.630
we're actually saving
costs for ourselves.

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.279
So we think it's a really well
aligned way of managing health.

00:02:42.279 --> 00:02:44.070
KORY JEFFREY: How new
is this in the space?

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.611
Do you guys see that you guys
are the only people doing this?

00:02:46.611 --> 00:02:48.600
Are there people
now following along?

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.657
What's the space like?

00:02:49.657 --> 00:02:51.240
KRIS GALE: The space
is largely people

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.630
who are trying to
do pieces of this.

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.480
I think we're sort
of best positioned

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.390
to do this comprehensively,
because we are an insurance

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.910
company who also has this
data science and software

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.350
development function.

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.540
I think a lot of people
are building similar tools

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.040
to the ones we've
built, and they're

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.320
trying to sell them into
insurance companies.

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.270
But it sits alongside
six or seven

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.280
other IT tools they're using.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.460
It's not sharing data
among those things.

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.480
And they're missing these
opportunities, then,

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.930
to actually drive operational
behavior changes, because all

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.550
they can do is sell software.

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.170
We think we're doing it
all together in one room.

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.682
And we think that's
the novel part.

00:03:26.682 --> 00:03:28.890
KORY JEFFREY: And so an
insurance company with a very

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.420
cool, holistic tech bend to it.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.747
What draws you to a
place like Founder World?

00:03:34.747 --> 00:03:36.830
KRIS GALE: I think what's
interesting about events

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.371
like this is seeing all of the
other things that are starting

00:03:39.371 --> 00:03:43.150
to happen in the space, and
potentially find other health

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.630
tech startups that are doing
things that will produce

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.130
improved disease outcomes,
and then looking at Clover

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.860
as potentially a
platform to go out and be

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.490
a customer for those things.

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:57.660
Because we'll invest in any
technology that we can show

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.170
improves the clinical quality
outcomes of our members.

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.782
So we think we're
the ideal customer

00:04:02.782 --> 00:04:04.740
for a lot of the people
who might be exhibiting

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:06.550
at an event like this.

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:08.972
KORY JEFFREY: And so you
were a speaker today.

00:04:08.972 --> 00:04:10.430
What was it you
were talking about?

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:11.400
What was the message
you were trying

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.450
to get across to everybody?

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:13.991
KRIS GALE: Yeah,
largely it was this.

00:04:13.991 --> 00:04:16.640
It was about the state of
the health care vertical,

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.420
and what entrepreneurs
and people looking

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:22.840
to get into this space should
know about who buys what.

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.580
What are their incentives?

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.390
What are the changing regulatory
dynamics of health care?

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.610
KORY JEFFREY: So as
you look at-- obviously

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.610
we talked about you
investing in anything that

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.640
makes sense for the incentives.

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.930
Is there any one space
from a health care

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.940
point of view that looks
particularly promising?

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:41.820
Is it VR?

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.060
Is it big data?

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.749
Is it anything like that?

00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:47.290
KRIS GALE: Yeah,
for me, I think it's

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.540
a lot of stuff related
to behavioral health.

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.360
So we're ensuring a population
of seniors, 65 and older,

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.370
who might be on a lot of
medication simultaneously.

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.510
And it's very difficult
if you're also

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:04.120
managing maybe depression, or
other behavioral health issues,

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.232
to stay adherent to your
medication schedule.

00:05:06.232 --> 00:05:08.440
So a lot of people are coming
up with different tools

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.400
where maybe it's a smartphone
app, or a smart pill bottle,

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.440
or things that help people to
take their medication on a more

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:16.660
regular schedule.

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.650
We know that improves
health outcomes.

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.570
So we're looking at
potentially being

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.277
a customer for those
sorts of things,

00:05:22.277 --> 00:05:24.110
because we can measure
whether it's actually

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.260
working for our
members, and continue

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.660
to deploy the technology
that actually helps.

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:29.760
KORY JEFFREY: OK.

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.259
That's really cool too, because
you could actually prove out

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:34.340
the model for the startups
as well, because you

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:35.750
have the holistic system.

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:36.400
Awesome.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.840
So speaking of
technology, do you

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.810
have a favorite
Google technology?

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:42.930
KRIS GALE: Yes, I've
been using Inbox lately.

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.310
Yes, I'm a huge fan of Inbox.

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.750
Just within the last
couple months rolled out

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:49.840
for our enterprise account.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:50.702
So I love it.

00:05:50.702 --> 00:05:52.410
KORY JEFFREY: So do
you find the paradigm

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:55.470
shift hard to get used to, or
are you just easy to pick up?

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:57.470
KRIS GALE: I think it
took a couple weeks for me

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:00.240
to get to Inbox Zero
and start to use that.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.200
But being able to defer
something and say I'll

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.616
get to this tomorrow morning
and clear it out of my inbox,

00:06:04.616 --> 00:06:07.920
and just always be managing
the things that come through.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.780
One of the things I
find is that my job

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:12.035
as a co-founder in
this business is

00:06:12.035 --> 00:06:14.369
to really be up on
top of things and make

00:06:14.369 --> 00:06:16.660
sure I'm not blocking anyone
in the organization that's

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:18.070
waiting on me for an answer.

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:22.840
So being able to have that sort
of optimization for cycle time,

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.470
that I think Inbox does a
really good job of for me.

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:25.760
KORY JEFFREY: Yeah, I know.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.051
I'm kind of cheating right now.

00:06:27.051 --> 00:06:28.492
I have both Inbox and Gmail.

00:06:28.492 --> 00:06:30.450
And so I've got kind of
one foot in both camps.

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:32.160
And that doesn't work
well all the way around.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.951
KRIS GALE: I went
completely over to Inbox.

00:06:33.951 --> 00:06:36.160
The second I used
it, I was 100% in.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:37.910
KORY JEFFREY: You
have inspired me.

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:38.170
I'm going to have to do it.

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:39.290
Well, thank you very
much for joining.

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:40.000
KRIS GALE: Yeah,
thanks for having me.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:40.450
KORY JEFFREY: Awesome.

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:42.110
And thank you guys for joining.

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:45.640
This is site at Founder
World in San Francisco.
