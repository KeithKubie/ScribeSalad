00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.410
So the first step was decomposition.

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:05.680
In order to decompose the systems into components we begin

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.330
with the analysis model that we produced earlier.

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:11.310
Note that the elements in the analysis model are good candidates to

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:13.170
serve as architectural components.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.370
However in general, we might need to make some adjustments or

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:19.840
add new components in order to deal with non-functional requirements.
