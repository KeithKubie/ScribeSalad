take that take that world and show just
how deep and profound and analytic and

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540
how deep and profound and analytic and
 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.330
how deep and profound and analytic and
rigorous and intellectually serious it

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340

but but I'm glad that I actually tried
 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.140
but but I'm glad that I actually tried
to do both of those things and put both

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150
to do both of those things and put both
 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.000
to do both of those things and put both
of those things together instead of just

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010
of those things together instead of just
 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.819
