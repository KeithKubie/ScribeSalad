Speaker 1:          00:00:00       You are listening to radiolab radio from W N Y. S t. A. I'm Jana. Boom Rod. I'm Robert Krulwich Radiolab. So we got an email from you not long ago, our editor, Soren Wheeler and I, we got into a conversation with this woman. I live in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Her name is Janell. Jenny. I like the packers. Of course you do. Yeah, I guess photographer would technically be my job, but I do a whole lot of different things. None of which really pertain to the story at hand. But that's, and our story really starts when Janell sent an email to the radio lab, um, inbox basically saying, I need your help. Yeah. Something had happened to her that was kind of wondrous and unexplainable and very weird. And as a result, Jenelle had found herself stuck in a story, a story told to hundreds of thousands of people all across the [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:01:06       a story that sits right smack dab in the middle of one of the biggest cultural divides in our country right now.

Speaker 1:          00:01:15       It was a story that wasn't hers and she wanted us to help her find a way to finally tell her story, so to speak. Um, do you want me to kind of just talk me out? Yeah, sure. Well, um, when I was 18, I went to a concert,

Speaker 2:          00:01:32       a rock concert actually is that warp tour. So it's like a festival of young rock concerts, tons of bands on different stages all over the place. And Janell

Speaker 1:          00:01:44       is walking around between all the different stages and merchandise tables when she sees this 10 10 by 10 white 10th with just the little table in front of a table with a sign on it that said bone marrow donor sign up to be on the registry, save a life, something like that. So this was a rock music and good deeds brought together, right, which is a pretty good mix in hindsight. So Jenelle read the sign and she thought to herself, I'll sign it. Sure, why not? Yeah. Did you know what bone marrow was? Yeah, yeah. I mean, I knew that that would mean that they'd take a really long needle and stick it in you and suck out bone stuff. Yeah. I suppose at that point that was probably not the four thoughts. Um, I think the altruistic like do something. Yeah, that was probably the main motivation and all Janell had to do with standing in front of that tent was signed some papers and swab or cheek, because with a bone marrow donation they actually have to figure out if you're a genetic match with someone who would receive the donation.

Speaker 1:          00:02:44       Yeah. Which was part of what Jenelle thought was cool about it. I always thought that, you know, just be an amazing opportunity to be the one person who could do something for somebody that like literally no one else in the world could deep kind of connection with someone there. Yeah. There's, you know, I don't know if either of you are only children, but it's, yeah, it's, you know how there's just like, you have cousins, you've got friends, but at some point there's not that it sounds so stupid, but that biological connection like besides my parents or one night, right.

Speaker 2:          00:03:15       Was that, that you, you missed the idea of someone who was much Li like you and muchly in your world and muchly

Speaker 1:          00:03:25       yeah. And also even the kind of the need like somebody out there dependent on me on kind of that almost other worldly level.

Speaker 2:          00:03:34       So Janell swapped her cheek, signed the paper, and then went about her normal life. And then about six months later she got a call.

Speaker 1:          00:03:42       Yeah. Yeah. It was a phone call to my landline. That's my along with, oh gosh. So what year are we talking here? No, it's 2009. Okay. Um, it was a phone call and I remember very specifically, it was a voicemail because I hadn't had the chance to answer it. And they said something to the extent of, you know, high are familiar. The national bone marrow donor registry. We've done some tests and we've narrowed you down to be a preliminary match for a patient. So we need you to come in and do some further tests that involve no blood and stuff. Did you think, oh no, I forgot that I did that or are you thinking, oh boy, or what were you, oh, I was so I overcome with emotion. I remember just just to think there's somebody, there's somebody out there that might be my person. Uh, so absolutely no hesitation on my end. I went, sure.

Speaker 3:          00:04:38       Janell has into the clinic because, well, some bone marrow, the stuff in the kind of core of your bones actually produces all your blood cells and importantly including um, your white blood cells, which are a key part of your immune system. So what you're doing with the bone marrow transplant is taking a healthy immune system out of one person and putting it into another person whose immune system is, you know, cancer or, or messed up in some kind of way. He is though, because the immune system is that part of you that like recognizes you from not you and attacks anything that's not you. You have to like fool the new body into thinking that this immune system is them. And so the parts of your DNA that have to do with your immune system, couple of key parts of that have to match with the donor. So that's what they're doing with Jenelle. They're taking her into like test your DNA to see if the stuff that marks out her immune system matches closely enough with this, you know, recipient so that the bone marrow transplant will work.

Speaker 1:          00:05:36       And then maybe a month later I get like another call on this one. I was able to answer and they say, well, we've done tests and you are the ideal person in this 8 million person registry to donate for this patient. You are a perfect wow. Well you do it. And I was like, absolutely. Um, so did that feel totally like the call of destiny? Like oh maybe, maybe this was meant to be okay. Yeah, there's something I feel that's like bigger than myself. That's happening and I don't really, they made it, can't really explain it yet at that point. But I know there's like, okay, here's a, there's a big thing. So I go in and unfortunately to disappoint you Robert, the way that I don't need it, bone marrow wasn't the actually the real bad way with the big needle. I'm no, I'm your new map disappointment.

Speaker 1:          00:06:37       Whoever have they come up with a small needle urge. Yeah. Well what the straw or something. What they essentially do, and this is actually the far more common way of doing it, neuro is they inject you with all these drugs and it is like eight injections, um, that boosts your white blood cell count up to astronomical heights. And do you know, like when you get sick, when your immune system kicks in overdrive and you feel sick, imagine that like eight times over. But just cause I [inaudible] Achy, so achy, every bone hurt. And while Janell was feeling achy and sick inside of her, her bone marrow is pumping out a bunch of new baby blood cells on matured stem cells that can really become almost anything. Then they just go in and [inaudible] grab those cells. They harvest you, I guess. So you have a needle in both arms and you pretty much sit still for six hours.

Speaker 1:          00:07:30       Jellies, suck all your blood out of your body, put it in a machine and give you back what they don't need. So I think they've got about, you know, one of those little ivy begs just a quart size plastic bag full of my stem cells. And once you're done they put some bandaids on you and they're like, alright, um, let us know if you need anything. And do you know anything about like what happens to your blood cells? Like who gets it or what they're, um, the whole, uh, registry is very, very strict about patient confidentiality. But they did tell me that it was, um, a 29 year old man with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and that's their like, literally, that's all I knew for a whole year. Did you look that up in the, in the, Oh, of course they did endless Google searches of 29 year old man, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, trying to get a real p right.

Speaker 1:          00:08:26       I was like, oh, maybe he's worded it that way and I didn't find anything of course. But once the ears up, if both parties agree, then we can talk. And that's, that's kind of really interesting because I definitely was looking forward to that year mark. But once that hit, I kind of got cold feet. I really just wasn't ready to know exactly who he was. Um, and then I was also worried that maybe this guy's like real piece of crap. Like maybe he's a clan member or criminal or something. So there's a part of that two or three that you'd open up the sentinel and it would say formerly ill person robs three banks and hits all ladies. Horrible man saved by Janell Janney it's so stupid to say, but I thought that, so I did end up eventually sending this email or whatnot in, I think about October. It took them a couple of weeks to actually give my info to my patient and vice versa.

Speaker 4:          00:09:29       I was eating a lunch with a friend of mine and I remember having chips and Guacamole

Speaker 1:          00:09:35       by the way. My, my patient's name is Jim. Um, so they gave Jim my info

Speaker 4:          00:09:40       and my phone went off in my pocket. There was an email in my inbox and um, there was a, a scanned pdf attached to this email and open it up and she had filled this out with their own hand and I just broke, I totally badges a web, like a little baby in a, in a booth, in a Mexican restaurant, middle of Grapevine, Texas. Um, and I got on Facebook, I saw a picture, I saw a picture of her and I was like, oh my gosh, it's got, it's kind of be her.

Speaker 1:          00:10:08       I had gotten an email or not email to Facebook friend request from said this guy named Jim Monroe in Texas. And I was like, oh, okay. I don't know anybody in Texas. And then it clicked all the time. Ah, this, this is the guy, this is him. I could see his picture. I can look in. What does he look like? Not very much like me. Better now with shorter, no, wait. Yeah, I'm tall before I've got blonde, her hair, blonde hair, I think fake blonde, I should say. It's started right now, but I have like strawberry blonde hair, but tall blonde haired, blue eyed white guy. Um, I'm very handsome. Yeah. Short blonde haired blue eyed person until I guess we could be cousins. I think it, yes, when I looked at all of his pictures and his wife who's a model and these kids were so adorable and he tried to find as much as I can and as far as his profession, I was like, oh, he appears to be some sort of magician. So I guess we'll talk about that leader. So I don't even know, like, I guess why don't we just find out like where you're from, where you were raised and okay.

Speaker 4:          00:11:28       That way. So I was, uh, born in Orange County, California, Fullerton, California. I went to school in Anaheim, high school in Anaheim, uh, was a baseball player. So I ended up going, it was very, very good baseball player. I, uh, I got drafted by the, uh, at the time they were called the Tampa Bay devil rays. Now they're just the Tampa Bay rays. Oh, you were that good? Yeah. I turned down a professional baseball contract to go play at the University of Texas in Austin. What did you play? I was a pitcher. I was a hard throwing right-hander huh. And uh, ended up getting, like I said, drafted and went to the University of Texas to play baseball and that's what I thought I was going to be. I thought it was gonna be professional baseball player. And then my, uh, my sophomore year of college, I blew out my shoulder.

Speaker 4:          00:12:09       I had a surgery my freshman year and then came back and was throwing harder than ever then did it again. Uh, so baseball was kind of over, I'm over it like 19, like that's, yes sir. Yeah, it was a pretty, it was a big kick in the head, but he finished up school. They, I maintained my scholarship as a medical red shirt and majored in business and psychology. Yeah. Then moved up to boulder, Colorado, got married and had a couple kids and one of my really good friends during this time was, his name was Tennyson and he became one of my best friends and he was, he wasn't just my best friend, he was like my brother, he was an athlete too, so he was a former college football player and he had also lost his football career based upon an injury. Um, and then also new magic, uh, and illusion and magic was actually something that Jim had been fascinated by, um, ever since he was a kid. Yeah. I saw a trade show magician when I was 10 or 11. It was at the Anaheim convention center of all places at an optometric convention. Both of my parents are optometrists and he was just doing

Speaker 5:          00:13:09       trade show stuff at a booth. Do you remember what he was doing? He did a version of this trick called cards across. He made a cigarette, appeared you gotta which he pulled out of your head or out of somebody. Just, he just casually holding his hand and was holding a zigzag in the tips of his fingers and he goes to light it and there's a puff of smoke and there's a, there's a real cigarette [inaudible] and the thought you had at that moment was I want to do that.

Speaker 4:          00:13:32       It was how did he do that? And that is cool and you know, I'm going to go learn how that's done. So I just began to look at card tricks and read books on all how all this stuff was done to figure out how it was done. So when he met Tennyson, they started practicing together and doing shows in front of friends and family and pretty soon, sure enough we start doing gigs. But they started doing these shows at like schools and festivals and stuff. And they would do these tricks like a lot of kind of card tricks and number tricks. Say we pick a random number and it went and up, it was written on a piece of paper in the shoe of an audience member or something like that. But then the show would turn into something else because the thing is, Tennyson was a believer overwhelmingly so like believer like in God you mean?

Speaker 4:          00:14:20       Yeah. Uh, Christian and, uh, Tennyson was very convinced and so after an hour or so of magic tricks, just pure entertainment, Tennyson would say to the crowd. This has been great. We're going to take a quick break. We're going to give you guys a chance to take off cause during the second part of this show and we're going to talk about what the Christian perspective is and why we believe this Christian thing. If you want to stick around, great. If you don't take off. Now, Jim says during this part of the show, Tennyson in particularly was way more of the evangelistic piece. This, um, and I considered myself more of a producer. Now Jim had actually grown up going to church. Yes, I was, uh, my parents went to Lutheran church. I was, um, at one point doing that. It's, but still there's, you know, at the end of the day it was just, there was nothing in it that, uh, seem to be satisfying.

Speaker 4:          00:15:11       And so at this point in the show, Jim would sort of stand back a bit as Tennyson talked about how magic is actually all about the unseen and behind the veil of reality. There's a god watching over us and Jim says he would be standing there on stage watching these people in the audience who are feeling this real connection with God. However, um, I wasn't having that experience. He's just like, I don't feel what they're feeling. And he started to think to himself, I didn't want to be the guy that said, well, I'm a Christian because my friends were, or I'm a Christian, cause I was raised that way. I want it to be true. And he just wasn't sure that it was right. Um, and then after he and Tennyson, who had been doing this show for a year and a half or so, Jim got a call. Tennyson had been out hiking in the mountains just outside of boulder.

Speaker 4:          00:15:57       And, uh, he was found, uh, in a river. His body was partially submerged, uh, just at the edge of the water, at the base of a 40 foot cliff. And, uh, peaceful valley who was calling. No one really knows how he passed away. It looked like he might've actually fallen from the cliff. Um, the police thought maybe suicide, but it could be, you know, exposure to the elements, that kind of thing. Um, yeah, Jim says he was just, you know, devastated and he's probably the closest male friend I've ever had. Just felt like he was, you know, in the bottom of a hole. Yeah. Bottom of a hole, kind of figuring it out. Best friend passes away. My wife and I as a result, Kinda got into this really strange season where, you know, I'm depressed, she's depressed, we're pretty much on the verge of calling it quits. Uh, and then, uh, my leg starts hurting really badly. We're in the leg underneath my right knee.

Speaker 3:          00:16:56       Jim says he started popping Advil every day at first, just a couple, then more and more. And I'm trying to gut it out. Then he came home one day and he says the pain was so bad he couldn't even get out of his car. And so his wife was like, look, we're going to the hospital now and I'm sitting there and in an emergency room and this man walks into my room and he looks at me. He says, um, you have cancer. Jim had leukemia, which is I'm cancer of the blood cells. So the white blood cells inside of your bone marrow have literally exploded out of control. And the reason why your leg hurts so bad is cause your, your bone is breaking on its own from the inside. Wow. And he said, uh, if you don't do anything, you're going to die in two months. Just before Christmas of 2008 Jim checks into the hospital and right away they do two things. One, they put Jim on the bone marrow registry in the hopes that he can find a donor and two, just to keep them alive, only waits. They start putting him through round after round of Chemo and get this wicked concoction of stuff and then be let out. He loses his hair, his body starts to fall apart. And all you can do at that point is just hope, you know, like tick tock, tick tock, tick, tick, Tock, tick tock.

Speaker 3:          00:18:10       That's when you think you know what you believe to be true is in con is in adversity. That's, that's when you find out. And so for me it was not, it was not a Christian worldview. If there is an all loving on that, a powerful being that makes the universe go around, then why would things like, you know, suicide or murder or rape exist in a, in a, in this constructed world of his gym, just couldn't get himself to believe in the existence of a god like that or really any god, no, there wasn't any rhyme or reason or purpose is just, this is, this is my lot, this really sucks.

Speaker 4:          00:18:54       And then when he was at his lowest point, I remember driving back to Houston, Texas for more chemo. And my phone rang and I didn't recognize the number and I said hello, and this woman on the other line,

Speaker 1:          00:19:05       she said, uh, there's a one person that we've been able to identify on the planet. Out of all the databases, everything, there's one, you are the ideal person in this 8 million person registry to donate for this patient. A thing about that is in the world, you are a perfect match, will you do it? And I was like, absolutely. My wife and I were in the car together and it was just tears, you know, it's like, wow, that's amazing. So April 20th and this is important to remember, April 20th was when I donated

Speaker 4:          00:19:49       and is there a pulling the cells out of Janelle's body up in Wisconsin?

Speaker 3:          00:19:53       You know, one of those little ivy bags full of my stem cells down in Texas. Jim's doctors were telling him, your bone marrow transplant is scheduled for April 23rd on April 23rd the nurses, they come inside of your room to celebrate your second birth. And then I remember Dr Dror telling me, are you ready to put your boxing gloves on? Well, when he was preparing me for was a death,

Speaker 4:          00:20:21       come to find out later on they pulled my wife out of my room and they said, we're going to give this to Anne with all this medication. He's, he could potentially receive this and reject this violently and pass away. Because remember they're essentially replacing Jim's immune system with somebody else's, in this case, Janelle's. And in a very real way, the replacing that part of Jim that determines who he is with someone who he clearly isn't. And so there's a real chance the body will just short circuit. So they give you this drug and the nurses nicknamed shake and bake. It's designed to basically wipe out whatever is left of Jim's immune system, his, his white blood cells, but inside a Viv and your body just starts convulsing. And then they put Janelle's cells in and they monitored me. And over the next couple of weeks to know cells entered Jim's body, they get into his bone marrow and they start producing new white blood cells as per basically producing a whole new immune system. And eventually Jim is cancer free. I mean, it's literally like new life, you know.

Speaker 4:          00:21:26       Now I will say this, some bells kind of began to go off on my head a little bit. Jim says before he even got the transplant, um, his doctor had come into his room and told him, you're going to be like a baby inside your mother's womb, literally being born again because on April 23rd and once again, this is their terminology. There's someone else that's going to be living on the inside of you. And this new system of blood is gonna be your life. Why is that interesting? You know, April 23rd, my new birthday is April 23rd and my old birthday is April 20th. Uh, my new birthday is on April 23rd that's on the third day. And on the third day, significant cause of the biblical echo of Biblical Echo. Yeah. I came back from whatever I was in because of the only blood on planet earth that could save me and my disease.

Speaker 4:          00:22:15       So, you know, does this land on you the way it sounds to me, like it lands on you now or did you go through a like, like what happened? Like those words. Yeah, those words in particularly bells went off in my head. Right. Does that mean that you now suddenly, um, believe in God again or for the first time or, I mean, I, it's process, right? You follow and then I think the puzzle pieces are kind of all swirling and coming together, but everything changed on that demarcating day, April 23rd, all thanks. Obviously to Janell. And not long after they got each other's information and [inaudible] each other on Facebook, they hopped on a, on a phone call. So she gets on and I get on and, but it's all kind of like, hey, oh my gosh, this is crazy. Yeah. I cannot believe this is nuts.

Speaker 4:          00:23:06       Yeah. This is so crazy. And then she drops this on me. She said, I went and got a tattoo of a jigsaw puzzle piece on the very spot where they stuck that IV in my arm to pull out the new blood knowing that I was the missing piece in someone else's life and without me, that person wouldn't be alive. And I said, do you? I was like, I was thinking, do you have a ton of tattoos? And she said, no, I have one. Do you know what Christians and related to be true, right? What is that? Their savior rolled up and showed them the very spot on his body where blood came out so that they would believe, so you're just going down this road, you're, you're just, you're driving like a hundred miles an hour towards, towards this. For me, it was like I was being introduced to a person.

Speaker 6:          00:23:56       Um,

Speaker 4:          00:23:57       there was an experiential understanding

Speaker 6:          00:24:00       of [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          00:24:02       that which was going on behind the scenes of this existence that was answering my [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          00:24:06       prayer. The prayer is for, is the periods closed. Are you there? Yep. Are you there? God Basically Jim Satya now and her donation to him as almost more than just allegory is like something close to literal proof of the existence of God. Like a very real, very present sign. I told her too, I told her that we need to meet. I said, can I please bring you out to Dallas, Texas? He said, I have to bring you to Texas, which is my nightmare. I'm just kidding. Absolutely. I wanted to go right into it. I remember her tone. She's like, yeah, sure. Super excited. So yes, I flew her to Dallas, Texas.

Speaker 7:          00:24:48       This says Michael Scam rags and it's coming down. I actually recorded it. So it might be, you've met sqirl girl saved my life. Oh really?

Speaker 2:          00:24:57       In the video you see Jim sort of standing at the bottom of this escalator in Dallas, Fort Worth airport. He's, you know, looking pretty thin and pale and nervous. And then the camera turns and there's Janell

Speaker 7:          00:25:14       coming down the escalator and the hug, his kids come up, his wife.

Speaker 1:          00:25:36       Okay, so, so, so now you'd go home. We go to his, his home. Right. And he lives in a very big house outside of Dallas.

Speaker 2:          00:25:44       They had dinner with the family and then, you know, once everybody else was kind of heading off to bed, um, Jim and Chanel started to talk

Speaker 1:          00:25:51       and, uh, I think if I remember correctly, we were just outside by the pool and just talking and figuring out who each other was and you know, I was like, so, you know, magician, what, what, what is that? And uh, he started telling me about what kind of magician he really is and he is a Christian magician.

Speaker 4:          00:26:16       I'm sure that in her mind she's thinking, oh my gosh, I just saved a Christian magician from Texas life and jokes on me. Isn't that wonderful? You know,

So Soren, you left us in the backyard. They were about to talk, right? Yup. Sitting in Jim's backyard by the pool and he's basically telling her his whole story about his sort of loss of faith and the cancer and how she saved his life. And then he tells her that right after she saved him, he started doing the magic show again. That show that he used to do with Tennyson is called the nays.

Speaker 7:          00:28:04       My name is Jim Monroe. This is the maze. So we actually get to see Jim show and I have to say he's a pro. It's a, it's an impressive production. He gets big venues here, ready to have some fun tonight, usually a thousand people or so. There's crazy laser light show stuff and he does these really complicated illusions that are sort of half Penn and teller, half David Blaine

Speaker 2:          00:28:34       sample taking a random phone number out of the phone book where seven Zeros ends up being someone in the audience and then their phone will end up like hidden somewhere, something like that. And they're very good. So Jim is telling Jenelle about all these tricks, but then he says, second half of the show is about us. [inaudible] he explains it, the magic show at this point. And he tells people they can leave if they want to and he starts to talk openly, professionally to the audience.

Speaker 7:          00:29:04       Well, I quickly found out that I had cancer

Speaker 2:          00:29:09       in very personal terms about what happened to them.

Speaker 7:          00:29:12       Well my wife and I raced down to MD Anderson Cancer Center

Speaker 2:          00:29:16       in a certain point he shows a video

Speaker 7:          00:29:24       stuff started cause I changed anything in there. He's in the hospital [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:29:36       throwing up into a bucket and he's Pale, thin, huge circles under his eyes.

Speaker 5:          00:29:47       And then he explains it right when he was on the edge of death at his lowest point, this, this thing happened, a miracle happened.

Speaker 7:          00:29:58       There is one person just

Speaker 1:          00:30:05       when his blood was literally poisoning his own body, somebody substituted their blood on his behalf so he could be born again. Yes,

Speaker 7:          00:30:15       on your behalf that you can live again.

Speaker 1:          00:30:17       Read days after his birthday.

Speaker 7:          00:30:19       The third day I came back from the dead is the only global appointment. They're considered legacies.

Speaker 1:          00:30:24       So there's a whole three days thing there, which is a story of Easter and the rebirth. It's just, let's see, I mean he sees this as like definitive proof that there's a god

Speaker 7:          00:30:34       I didn't either. The statistical anomaly that continues to propagate this false ideology about supernaturalism and miracle results. I even got to the testicle anomaly that the soul, the wild, that's like being bitten by a shark and struck by lightning at the same time twice in this lifetime. Or you might have to believe what I believe is true and that is there is a bigger one on mine, the scenes and his name is Jesus. Mm.

Speaker 2:          00:31:02       So yes, this is all being thrown at me. And is he, is he saying all this to you by the pool? Is it all, it all comes tumbling out. Yeah. Yeah. And how are you, how are you feeling inside stranger and stranger going down the wormhole? Because

Speaker 1:          00:31:23       I am an atheist in the sense that I don't, I don't believe in the tenants of Christianity. I don't believe really in the tenants of any established religion I've ever seen. Honestly. I just think that once things are labeled and you're pigeonholed and the exclusivity of really any religion is this the cause for a lot of problems throughout history. But faith can be beautiful and there's definitely parts of me and there's moments in my life that boy praying and really feeling like that was going out to somebody would feel great, but I just can't, they just can't do it. So at that moment he's telling me this and yeah. And he's like, well, you know, you're here in Texas for this weekend and would you be willing to come on stage for one of my shows so I can introduce you? And of course I said yes. And of course, of course she said yes. Yeah, of course. I've always kind of looked at our story as something bigger than what he believes. What? I don't believe it's bigger. It's capital B. Underlined, bold. It's big.

Speaker 2:          00:32:45       Partly because Jim at every show he has the bone marrow registry people right there ready to sign fold.

Speaker 1:          00:32:51       And because of the show they just saw he can get in hundreds. Um, I know that dozens of people have gone on to be matches. Oh. So this was truly the culmination of, from the moment I signed up to be on that registry, this felt like the zenith of this entire thing.

Speaker 8:          00:33:12       Mm.

Speaker 1:          00:33:14       So next night at Texas Christian University, packed house Chanel's in the audience. I was in like the front row

Speaker 2:          00:33:22       and during the second part of the show, when Jim goes through the rebirth part, he stops and he says, guess what? Everyone that person who saved my life, she's here.

Speaker 7:          00:33:31       Okay. He has me walk up on stage. Proud wins wild. It's first time in my life I got a standing ovation because your [inaudible]. That's why the magical is crazy. It's because, yes,

Speaker 10:         00:33:49       yeah. All of these kids in the audience who are all pretty much my age as well at that point are seeing my being onstage as the quite possibly the biggest proof they've ever had. That there is a god,

Speaker 2:          00:34:08       will you will you know? Was there any part of you that said, I shouldn't be here? Are you all,

Speaker 1:          00:34:14       yeah, there was a part of me that felt a little bit of an imposter,

Speaker 2:          00:34:22       but for Janelia she says that feeling was outweighed just by the number of people that were lining up at the bone marrow donation table and so the next time she had a chance she did it again

Speaker 7:          00:34:38       and again and again.

Speaker 2:          00:34:45       She's now appeared at the end of the show around a dozen times all around the country playing the role of Jim's personal savior and she says, the more time she did it, the more that feeling, that sort of fraud feeling kept popping up each time a little bit louder.

Speaker 1:          00:35:01       Yeah. There's parts of me, there's little fibers in my being better like wow, if, if this is a sign, if there is a god, I'm a real jerk. This is such a beautiful and really literal story being told to me about like, hey, you know maybe there is a god. She said she started to feel that like if she's both perpetuating that story and refusing it, there's special place in hell for me

Speaker 2:          00:35:30       and this is why Janell got in touch with us because she wanted us to help her figure out a way to tell a story that led her way of seeing the world into the room. Okay. Are you guys, is everyone there? Hi Jim. Can you hear us? Yeah, I can hear you guys. Jenelle can hear me. I can. How are you? So our producer let, if Nasser actually started talking to Jenelle about what exactly she wanted to do and they decided that we should just all get in the studio, Jim and her and all of us and see if we could hash it out. Okay. I guess like Jenelle do you want to just kind of talk through what we've been thinking?

Speaker 1:          00:36:08       Oh sure. I can try and if you want to help me, lot TIF sir. Um, uh, essentially lot defy and I have been talking about what would be the best way for me to kind of tell my side of the story. Um, yeah, my side of our story so to speak without so much of the religious stuff. Yeah. So when are you guys gonna do that? Hmm,

Speaker 2:          00:36:35       maybe I missed the point. I'm sorry. So do you say we as in like we are going to [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:36:39       do you have version of that? Well I thought you could help me. Oh cool. Well I have no problem kind of just cause you are so not only a magician with magic things but also with words [inaudible] so maybe if we could, if you could help me. So yeah, totally.

Speaker 2:          00:36:58       That's, that's so interesting. My mind begins to spin and I have a, so at first we suggested maybe Jenelle could come out at the end of one of Jim shows and just read a statement or something. And Jim said, you know, that's probably not gonna work. As you guys know in this world, there's, I mean, audiences come based upon how things are marketed and booked. And Jim said, you know, he has to worry about sort of as a business, the expectations of his, of his sponsors and even the audience who are, who are looking for a certain thing like a producer. Cause I'm, I'm totally up. So we're like, yeah, okay, fair enough. Maybe we could be like a Q and a after the show or something like that. I don't know. I'd have to really like process it, but I'm totally open to it. I would always love to help. Um, Jenelle fig, I mean help her put it all together and like, I think though that, so eventually we landed on a plan. Jim was going to be doing his show up in St, cloud, Minnesota and we decided, well we could just do a show with him and Jenelle the next night. So along with producers, Latif Nasser in any McKeown, we headed up to St. Cloud, met up with Janell and that night we went to all go see Jim's show.

Speaker 1:          00:38:04       It's pretty big venue. There was probably like a thousand people. They're all college students and of course because Juno was there, uh right after he did the sort of personal journey back to God.

Speaker 7:          00:38:18       She's here too. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:38:22       a bit hard to hear, but there was literally like a shutter of energy that went through the crowd at that moment.

Speaker 7:          00:38:27       Ladies and gentleman, welcome to this day. Just as General Jenny come on up here too. [inaudible]

Speaker 11:         00:38:46       so yeah, you're the much better speaker than me. What I can say is I encourage all of you taking center.

Speaker 2:          00:38:58       So Janell just pointed out that the national bone marrow registry would be there that night and she encouraged everybody to, you know, sign up and have a chance to save a life and and do something good.

Speaker 11:         00:39:10       So please do that or at least consider it.

Speaker 2:          00:39:15       Then Jim had her show the whole audience or puzzle piece. Tattoo

Speaker 7:          00:39:18       [inaudible] only one [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:39:28       and once Janell had stepped back off the stage,

Speaker 7:          00:39:31       before we close, I wanted to know if I can pray for you. Do you guys still pray in Minnesota? All right, so would you mind, I told you to leave. I want you to pray this prayer with me. Just say this in your home. So Lord Jesus, two nights I choose to turn and start living for myself, my own version of my own story and I want to trust you. I don't have all the answers, but I know you do. And tonight and by faith I choose to follow you. Thank you for loving ladies. Thank you. In the midst of all of this randomness that I experienced coming after me for being jealous, I love him too. In Jesus mighty name. Amen. And Amen.

Speaker 2:          00:40:27       And then just before everybody stepped out,

Speaker 7:          00:40:30       awesome. This is very good. I'm going to be here another night. I'm going to appear that we're going to be here tomorrow. Have you guys heard the [inaudible]?

Speaker 2:          00:40:41       That was about three people that shout it out.

Speaker 7:          00:40:43       They're in the audience. I'm just going to sit. I'm not going to point them out, but in the audio,

Speaker 2:          00:40:46       nobody cared.

Speaker 7:          00:40:48       I'm ready. Man is going to be holding this forum. [inaudible] now, Jen is going to touch your side of the story of what happens is we heard through this process. All right. All right,

Speaker 2:          00:40:58       so after the show we actually got a chance to talk to some of the people from the audience.

Speaker 11:         00:41:04       Then hearing the whole three days, I'm like, oh my God. That's wow. Oh my gosh. I can't believe that she was actually here, here in their rank about it. I would've been so shocked to sit right next to her. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:41:17       pretty much everybody was totally floored by actually getting to see Janell in person and they all seem to take her story the way Jim does a visual example,

Speaker 11:         00:41:25       put a face to this whole thing. So many things fell in mind where, yeah, you just have to believe in my opinion. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:41:32       yeah, yeah. So [inaudible] the next night. Good evening, everyone. Welcome. My name is mark spring, winter night. Much less fanfare in a much smaller room, like maybe a hundred people there are. So with the help of the religious studies program at St, Cloud University, hear me okay? Yes, here I am. Oh my God, we did Janelle's thing. All right. So I'm Robert [inaudible]. I am one of the cohost of the public radio program cause they called radio lab. I want to introduce also, sorry wheeler who is our managing editor who's gonna at Sam. He's going to be adding his 2 cents from times nine. We're a very democratic show and like nobody controls anything and everybody pitches in so, so he will to, uh, and I want to begin by just telling you a story. So we brought Jenelle up on stage, but you know, could you just come up here and sit, I guess, might as well sit here.

Speaker 2:          00:42:17       We told them her whole story of, you know, donating and then waiting a year to find out, you know, who Jim really was talk, I had no idea that when we brought Jim onstage, I saw Jim the years up, he talked about, you know, his whole process of recovery. Trying to get your bearings. You talked about how grateful and thankful he was. And then we turned back to Janelle. Me, let's make this a little more complicated. Sorry. Could you just run the a m I asked you like how you felt in that first round and you, this is what you told me in the interview,

Speaker 12:         00:42:52       there was a part of me that felt a little bit of an impostor. Well, no, why, why would you use the word imposture? What is that? Why did you choose that word? So that's how we should start getting into the meat and potatoes of my thoughts. I think so, yeah.

Speaker 13:         00:43:11       Part of me is, um, and at that time especially thought that I'm up here, um, again as this pretty hard and fast proof or a very compelling narrative for a lot of people and their faith that I don't particularly share at all.

Speaker 12:         00:43:33       Okay. Can I ask a question? Yeah. Um, but I, I knowing that you knew what at that point, cause we talked about that and I was, I was very concerned knowing that you, you know, didn't agree with what I believe to be true, that, that you would feel like you were in that spot.

Speaker 14:         00:43:54       Okay.

Speaker 12:         00:43:55       That's why I asked you. Oh, of course. And I could've declined. Yeah. But at the same time, it doesn't make anything different than the fact that it's still what it is, you know? Exactly.

Speaker 13:         00:44:05       I would have done it regardless of whatever it was. Yeah. If your whole theme of your show was how great the Dallas cowboys were and it got everybody to join the bone marrow registry, I would have got up there, cowboys hat. Honestly, Jim, every time I see your show, even though I don't it, you know, adhere to the religious tenants of it, I still get that feeling and everybody,

Speaker 1:          00:44:33       all my family, all my friends, whatever their religious, even my Muslim friends that I've told this story get, do you know that feeling? And you know what that feeling is, is a little intangible. But I think it's something even a little bigger than that. Sounds so crappy to say bigger than Jesus. That's really blasting miss, but I can't think of a better way.

Speaker 15:         00:45:01       What did he, what did you mean? Can you explain what that means?

Speaker 1:          00:45:06       Well, you know, um, that

Speaker 13:         00:45:10       there is good in this universe and there is good in everybody and it is regardless of the goodness is at the top of the list of you and everything else is follows your religion and your race and where you were born and your favorite pizza, toppings and all of that. But at the very top is

Speaker 15:         00:45:32       good with the capital junior. It's underlined too. All Right Jim, in your show you have a rather gorgeous take on, on moral relativism. You have a, a string of bonds, um, that this idea that being good and doing no harm and living as ethically as, you know, how is satisfying to some people, but can you review it isn't really enough. Um,

Speaker 12:         00:45:59       oh yeah. This is where we, I mean obviously there's some disagreement here. Um, I think that there is good and I think that there is evil in this world and I think that people in and of their own left to their own vices left on devices. I think that they struggle with being good. I think that even on our best day, I think that we fall short.

Speaker 15:         00:46:24       And so in hearing her account, you just say, you just saying thinking what? That, that, that she's not

Speaker 8:          00:46:32       [inaudible]

Speaker 15:         00:46:33       what is, what if, where does she fall? She, where does this idea lose you?

Speaker 12:         00:46:37       I don't, I mean, it doesn't lose me. I think it's phenomenally good. It's not, not acknowledging as good. I just think that it's for it, for the Christian. It's not about being good or bad. I think, what is it about, I think it's about, uh, I think it's about having a relationship with God. Does that make sense?

Speaker 2:          00:46:55       That last sentence? I guess it makes sense at that point, Jim, you know, he made it clear that he definitely wasn't condemning Janell because she didn't have a relationship with God. But then we took it sort of different approach. We started talking about the unlikeliness of this whole story, which is one of the things that Jim talks about in his show and so at that point I decided I should jump in and I, I say this and I,

Speaker 15:         00:47:17       I really say this only because it is our job as a show that when we hear a story like this, we dig in, we investigate and we do that from a frame that really focused on math, facts, science

Speaker 4:          00:47:30       and couple of things happen to you if you happen to be in my position, you run across stuff like this and I'll just read from the BIA match website. A patient's likelihood of finding a match donor on be the match registry is estimated to be between 66 and 97% the chances that you'll find a 10 to 10 match in the way that Jim and Jenelle were 10 to minute 10 matches is around 50% oh wait a second year, which I, that doesn't make sense to do it. Well it doesn't because a million people, he, she was the one, yeah. Let me say that this does not actually contradict with Jim and Janelle's experience of it for, for that to happen to Jim, it is truly staggering. It is truly, it could be one in a trillion. And you know, like the way winning a lottery has one in a trillion. That how can it be both one in the can. Because what happens is if you back up away from the individual and ask not what are the chances, that's what happened to Jen, but what are the chances that this would happen to someone somewhere? It's like there's this,

Speaker 15:         00:48:25       there's a story about if you're golfing and you hit a golf ball and it goes however many hundreds of yards. I don't play golf so I don't know how far they go, but it lands on a blade of grass and that blade of grass says, why me? Why would this golf ball crush me like this? Which is a valid point. Uh, I would feel that too. Uh, but that ball was going to land on some weight of grass. So you, it doesn't like there the why me is still a true thing. It is a true experience in which there is a, there is still this difference. I think, um, the ball can't point to anything greater no than the argument alerts behind this is uh, that these things happen and it is just chance two places. The random view accrediting, how are you going to be able to that, that you were randomly there and you were randomly [inaudible]

Speaker 12:         00:49:15       chosen isn't the bird you were it that the ball's mercy landed on you. But I'm not, I also am not coming at it from just that angle. I wonder if it was just the bone marrow transplant. If it would be people get that all the time. I think perhaps the other bits and pieces of the puzzle maybe help shadow it in, you know, a little bit for me. Um, and so I don't know if it's me. It's a, it's a multilayered cake. I thought you really don't like this

Speaker 15:         00:49:42       idea of like in this science version there is no design and there is no first cause except the first random event that sets the thing in motion. Right. Do you do both? Could you either of you live with that version of what just happened to you? [inaudible]

Speaker 13:         00:49:59       yeah. Well that's perfect cause it's exactly what you talk about in your show with the, all the different cards

Speaker 15:         00:50:07       Janelle's referring to a thing in gym show where he talks about how unlikely any particular order of cards in a deck is.

Speaker 13:         00:50:13       And the idea of a particular set of cards being dealt in a particular way is 52 factorial, which is pretty much impossible. It is impossible. It's an impossible number you could statistically, right, right. But yet you, the cards and they happen right there. So this really gets into just the different viewpoints on the proverbial deck of cards and who's dealing them. Is it in a particular fashion? And I think that's, you know, what Jim believes is that there is a proverbial dealer and I don't, I guess,

Speaker 15:         00:50:52       and you agree that that's pretty much the difference.

Speaker 12:         00:50:54       Yeah. I mean, having given thought to that, um, I believe that, that there was some sort of, you know, mind personality [inaudible]

Speaker 15:         00:51:05       so the, I believe part is where you is, where you stand. It is. Absolutely. Yeah. Absolutely it is. It's faith and [inaudible] your his savior I guess. And we saved his life. But in some way you don't, you, you haven't. I don't. How do you worry about this at all?

Speaker 13:         00:51:25       Yeah, absolutely. And even right now on this stage, there's a part of me that in front of all of you that I'm sure a lot of you were at the show last night. There was a part of me that is afraid of disappointing that I don't share what you believe to be true. I mean, you're an entire experience, pretty much points the Arrow that like, I'm like an alliteration of Jesus and your story. And that's really difficult to reconcile as someone who doesn't have faith. And it makes me sad sometimes because I think it would be a lot easier if I just believed exactly what you believed. And I think that I always am very afraid of letting that be known. Like I'm super like clammy right now, just saying it in front of this many people. Um, I just feel like people would see your story and it's so tremendously compelling. It's unbelievable. And then see that that last piece of this little puzzle literally doesn't fit at all.

Speaker 12:         00:52:32       I mean, I, I, it's not like I haven't, I haven't thought about that either. Um, and how you might feel and I empathize and I don't know how to answer that. Yeah. You know, I, I just, I just want to give you a hug, but yeah, there's an unconditionality to how I feel about you that I just, you can do no wrong in my eyes. Yeah.

Speaker 15:         00:52:54       Here's the, for you, the hardest thing I was just trying to think of how difficult this must be. You have been, say your life has been saved by her [inaudible]. She is in effect your savior. And yet your belief is that unless she accepts Jesus, that in some sense she's outside of grace. And you know, I don't know. I don't know what you believe about Hell and heaven, but that she might be punished. So what do you do about this weird contradiction? She's insisting, nope, not for me. Then you says, oh, this is the way it is, and oh my gosh, it's was it, is it hard

Speaker 4:          00:53:26       for you? No, not at all. Okay.

Speaker 12:         00:53:28       I'll tell you why. Because it's not my place to do that. I'm very sorry to everyone who listens to this, whoever feels like they got judged by Christian cause it's never their place to do that. And this is where I think most of the times and everybody listened. This podcast is placed as kind of positioned or pigeonholed Christians. And what they don't understand is that I'm not commanded to do anything but to love and to start conversations. Right? I'm not the one, I'm the, I'm not the, I'm not the one who was sent into the world to judge. All right? But what I, so, so putting it like that, I know, I know where you want to go with this.

Speaker 4:          00:54:10       No, I'm just, this is not actually an honest question. You have to love the judge that may not love the woman who saved your life. That's hard I think yet. But,

Speaker 12:         00:54:19       but at the same time, it's, uh, that's, that's not what I'm s that's not, that's not my place.

Speaker 4:          00:54:26       I had to say, I think we were sort of expecting that maybe there would be a sharper edge to the differences between Jim and Janell. But to be honest, their conversation that night and, and their stories started to feel like

Speaker 16:         00:54:41       almost an allegory for how to move through the world and hold your differences but still be one.

Speaker 15:         00:54:48       Let me just finish this way. Do you have a sense between the two of you? Um, because I mean obviously you, you stay very, very good friends. I mean that's obvious. Is there some something that either of you can say that explains why you can dignify ugly but emphatically disagree and still stake such extraordinary close touch? I think the idea of humility and as Jim might even say, grace

Speaker 8:          00:55:20       is

Speaker 15:         00:55:22       absolutely essential no matter your tenants of belief. And that's really what's going to get you through conflict. So yeah. And is it because you're in this big ocean of the world and the two of you or just little little dots in it and so whatever you think is still, you're in the big ocean and there you are together. Is that the, I think maybe. Yeah. Yeah. And do you ever have a bigness thing? Do you feel small? Do I feel small? Yeah.

Speaker 12:         00:55:54       I feel tiny humility at it's root word is it comes from the root as Hump Humus,

Speaker 15:         00:56:02       which means dirt. Huh?

Speaker 12:         00:56:05       So when you become humble, you become there.

Speaker 4:          00:56:10       And however I can see it now, I can keep going. I can keep going. You know, God does with third is he creates things, but I won't go there. But you become dirt.

Speaker 12:         00:56:18       And, um, and I think, I think where we get hung up is that we want to be right. And that hasn't been brought into the this yet. You want to be right and right and wrong are the words right and wrong are our dead, I think in relationship or deadly words. I think that saying I'm right, you're wrong. Um, is, is, it's not good for relationships. I think it's like, let's find, let's find where we, have you ever said you are right or you're wrong to her? No. No one said to him either. I'd never left a nice place to land. I think so.

Speaker 17:         00:56:57       I think we're done. Now. That doesn't mean we're done. Done. That means that I'm going to let these two people introduce the person

Speaker 3:          00:57:11       at the end of the show. We had the bone marrow registry people there and uh, encouraged people sign up and quite a few dead, I think maybe 20 or so, but that was pretty much nothing compared to what gym.

Speaker 7:          00:57:23       Got It. At the end of this show, 150 people, wait, say that again. Just like 150 people signing up right now. Did you count them? That's our producer Andy McEwens at least that. Is this bigger than normal or I always like this. This is a little bigger than normal, I think anytime, but I'm actually in the show. It's a little bit better. So I've been told and what is it? How are you feeling when you watch this? It's really overwhelming. Like, yeah, it kind of makes me want to cry. Yeah. Yeah. I mean without you, this wouldn't happen, right? It's almost too big to think of [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 11:         00:58:47       [inaudible]
