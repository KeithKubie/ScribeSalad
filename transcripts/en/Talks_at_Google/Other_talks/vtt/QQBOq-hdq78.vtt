&gt;&gt;Eric: Hi and I just want to say it's an
honor today to bring AXS Lab, to Google and

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:12.889
their featured project, Axis Map.

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:19.369
And it's really about taking this idea of
accessibility and going out into the world

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:24.320
and how to we make this more inclusionary
environment.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.619
And with that I actually want to give a quick
introduction for each of our guests today.

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:32.509
First I'll actually introduce Jason.

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:36.190
He's the founder of AXS Lab.

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.430
He's also a director even before this project.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:46.290
Some of his work has been featured at Sundance
and HBO and PBS.

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.740
He is the founder and the kind of president
of this initiative.

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.350
And Alice is our executive director.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:01.150
She graduated from Stanford in Environmental
Engineering with a Masters and has been just

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.869
doing great ever since and really keeps this
ship afloat here.

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:11.450
And then, their newest member today, Kevin
Bluer, he been in web, mobile web development

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:12.860
for ten years.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.549
Um, and it's just ah a serial entrepreneur
and we're luck to have him as a part of this

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:18.549
team.

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:24.100
So as a little bit of background, I was introduced
to these folks in early 2011 in New York City

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.939
as part of a technical incubator.

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:33.219
And what I've loved to and responded to immediately
to this team, is this is a team that's taking

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:37.220
data and maps and combining it with story
telling.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.969
And that is an incredibly powerful combination.

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:44.620
And they're using this together to really
try to make a difference in the world.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.560
So I'm honored to bring them here today so
you can hear their story, their journey and

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.280
see some of their initial results.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:57.409
And I'm also to happy to note that they are
in part funded by Sundance and other groups

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:03.090
who are also Google and, the Google earth
outreach developer grant as well.

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:13.720
So with that, give them a round of applause
and we'll turn over 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:14.720
the mic.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:15.720
[Applause]
&gt;&gt;Jason: Thanks Eric.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:16.840
My name is Jason DeSilva.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.230
I'm the creator of AXS Map.

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.940
&gt;&gt;Alice: And I'm Alice Cook the producer of
AXS Map.

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.519
&gt;&gt;Kevin: And I am Kevin Bluer, the lead developer
of of AXS Map.

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:30.310
&gt;&gt;Jason: So let's just jump right in.

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:36.069
So this may be a surprising statistic but
actually one out six people have a disability

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:38.090
of some kind.

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.069
I happen to be one of those people.

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:43.480
I have primary progressive multiple sclerosis.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:50.810
I was diagnosed in 2005 and I saw over the
course of 7 years I've gone from walking just

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:58.769
fine to using a cane to a walker to a wheelchair
to a scooter where I am today.

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:01.180
And you know I'm a documentary filmmaker,
as Eric said.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.640
I've been working as a documentary filmmaker
for 10 -15 years now.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:13.469
I made films on PBS on HBO, I had a film with
Sundance, so it was natural for me, I decided

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:17.579
to take the camera and turn it on myself and
make a film.

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:21.830
The film is called 'When I Walk' it was picked
up by PBS.

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.650
It'll be broadcasting on PBS next year and
it really goes through and shows my whole

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:27.650
journey.

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:33.879
The, actually the making of AXS Map is in
the film, so that's the connection here.

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:37.030
So let's go ahead and show a preview of the
film.

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.150
[Film]
&gt;&gt;Female 1: I couldn't imagine my son being

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:46.829
a depressed person, because he has always
been up and about laughing and smiling.

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:52.890
He was just walking weird across the street,
walking, crossing the street at an angle.

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.909
&gt;&gt;Jason: We have a diagnosis, you have multiple
sclerosis.

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:04.900
&gt;&gt;Female 1: At least we can postpone him being
in a wheelchair and the doctor just looked

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.329
at us point blank and said 'No, he will be
in a wheelchair soon'.

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:10.270
&gt;&gt;Male 1: We will have problems that are consistent.

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:14.390
&gt;&gt;Male 2: Even normal people have patterns
that aren't quite as repeatable.

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.700
&gt;&gt;Jason: it was frustrating.

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:23.160
Multiple sclerosis was taking over my life.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:29.130
I'm gonna do to do everything in my power
to make sure that doesn't happen.

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:43.669
[Music]
&gt;&gt;Female 1: When you think your life is bad

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:45.340
think of situations like this.

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.350
&gt;&gt;Male 3: Everything in your mind.

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:48.690
[Multiple voices]
[Man breathing]

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:58.780
&gt;&gt;Jason: Getting a tattoo is nothing compared
to MS.

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:07.840
It's just like child's play.

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:17.310
We all have different struggles, but they're
more similar than we think.

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:31.340
[Music]
&gt;&gt;Jason: So this is my neighborhood in the

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:37.310
east Village before I was diagnosed with MS
you can find me waking up, going for brunch

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:42.069
some place, I catch lunch or dinner at a restaurant
with a friend.

00:05:42.069 --> 00:05:47.770
I'd go to a bar or a club at night, I believed
the whole world, the world was my oyster and

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.030
New York was my playground.

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:54.949
You know and then I got MS and then I started
slowly having trouble walking.

00:05:54.949 --> 00:06:00.060
So as my walking faded my neighborhood faded
and then my community involvement faded as

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:05.250
well.

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:11.090
So during this time I was inspired with the
idea of AXS Map and that's that's what happened,

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:14.580
so what I'm going to do now is show you, I'm
just going jump right in, show you a little

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.949
animation all about AXS map.

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:18.720
[Film]
&gt;&gt;Jason: Hi!

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:22.330
My name is Jason and I use a scooter to get
around.

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:23.639
It's not so easy.

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:30.930
I have trouble going to stores, finding bathrooms
that are accessible and meeting up with friends.

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:37.169
[Phone ringing]
&gt;&gt;Jason: Of course I can call ahead but many

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:41.699
places say they're accessible, but really
they're not.

00:06:41.699 --> 00:06:45.229
There has to be a better way.

00:06:45.229 --> 00:06:46.920
So I had an idea.

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:50.780
What if everyone could share all the accessible
places they know?

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:53.650
And what if all this was put on one map?

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:59.660
And that map was available on the web and
mobile phones?

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:02.349
I call it AXS Map.

00:07:02.349 --> 00:07:08.470
In the online and mobile app where anyone
can search for accessible places, or view

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:12.680
them on their entry ways or bathrooms.

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:17.879
AXS Map opens up a whole new world of choices
and I can instantly find all the accessible

00:07:17.879 --> 00:07:18.879
places around.

00:07:18.879 --> 00:07:24.610
Where to eat, shop, grab a coffee or get a
haircut.

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:28.900
Even if you're not in a wheelchair you're
invited to give ratings and contribute.

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:31.960
AXS map is powered by you.

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:34.650
The more you review, the better it gets.

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:41.810
For people with canes, walkers or wheelchairs,
even moms and dads with strollers.

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:45.690
AXS Map is your ticket to mobility freedom.

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:48.259
It's easy and free to use.

00:07:48.259 --> 00:07:50.860
Help make this world a more inclusive one.

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:54.050

[Music]

00:08:05.949 --> 00:08:11.720
&gt;&gt;Jason: Thanks now I'm going to pass it over
to Kevin Bluer who's the lead technologist

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:12.740
for the project.

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:14.889
&gt;&gt;Kevin: Thanks Jason.

00:08:14.889 --> 00:08:20.240
Hi everyone, as mentioned my name's Kevin
Bluer the lead developer on AXS Map.

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:22.080
So I'm just going to go through a few things.

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:25.139
I'm going to start with a quick walk through
of what we've built so far.

00:08:25.139 --> 00:08:28.979
And then I'm going to take a step back just
to show some of the design decisions we've

00:08:28.979 --> 00:08:33.220
made, in kind of building the product, talk
briefly through the API and so on.

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:38.680
Then, jump to the kind of future, talk about
kind of some of the upcoming releases, and

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:42.490
some of the concepts we'd like to you know
put in, medium to long term.

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:48.561
Kay so this is the home screen of AXS Map
going to go from the top down, you can kind

00:08:48.561 --> 00:08:51.390
of see the two, the two search boxes.

00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:57.220
On the left, the venues, some of the examples
Jason mentioned, cafe restaurant bar, etc.

00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:04.730
On the right you can put in the location,
so your zip, post code or street, whatever.

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:08.300
And then, the middle for now we've just got
the video which you saw was pretty nice it

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:11.960
kind of tells Jason's story pretty well, it
kind of frames what the application or the

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:12.960
platform is about.

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:17.050
We may change that over time, but you know
it's there right now, on the right we've got

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:22.440
just categories, so you can kind of jump right
into a specific place.

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:26.640
This is the search results screen, so after
you've done a search on the left you've just

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:30.291
got the stars, the other attributes which
we'll come on to in a moment.

00:09:30.291 --> 00:09:34.440
The two ratings you saw, as you saw in the
animation are getting in, which is obviously

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:35.440
fundamental.

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:39.980
If you can't get into a place then you know
nothing else really matters.

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:43.720
Beneath that we've got restrooms, once you
are inside, you know if you need to know how

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.519
accessible the restrooms are, then that's
there.

00:09:45.519 --> 00:09:48.990
There kind of two, what we found to be two
most important measures.

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:52.370
On the right hand side we've got Google map,
which is great that's very high level on Manhattan

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:56.709
right now, but obviously typically you'd zoom
in a lot lower than that.

00:09:56.709 --> 00:10:01.530
This is a venue page, so again, the two measures
there and then we've got a bunch of other

00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:03.870
attributes which I'll come on to in a moment.

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:08.300
In the top right we've actually got the Google
street view imbedded which is a great service

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:12.130
and I know Jason and Alice would use that
and still do use that before going out to

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:13.130
a venue.

00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:14.570
So now it's imbedded right in the place.

00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:17.810
And the actually graphic up there you can
just see, I've just zoomed in on a step.

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:23.430
So it's just as an example, it's a pretty
useful tool just determining that.

00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:29.000
Below that we've got the aerial view and below
all that we've got the ratings from the individual

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:35.000
contributors, so you know any additional comments
and stuff, you know pretty straightforward.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.981
This is adding a review, so again the same
measure as you saw in the animation there.

00:10:38.981 --> 00:10:43.160
It's kind of nice, kind of big chunky icons
you know very visual, very easy just to click

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:44.160
the stars.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:47.040
Now the attributes, we've got going from left
to right and these are just kind of ones you

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:49.530
light up, so if they're kind of binary, if
their applicable.

00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:55.010
So you know we've the spaciousness of the
venue, kind of traversable inside the venue,

00:10:55.010 --> 00:11:00.400
we've then got the quiet, so the volume inside
the venue, whether there's disabled parking,

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:04.650
whether they've got a disabled ramp, or sort
of a ramp for getting up, getting up stairs

00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:07.000
if they have stairs.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.760
We then have a second entryway as well, so
whether there's an entryway that's not visible,

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:14.680
you know, from the primary entryway.

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:17.920
And then on the far right where there's Braille,
so again if there's Braille on the menu, Braille

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:19.950
menu on the signs and so on.

00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:24.430
And below that we've got comments, so just
you know if there's any sort of tips or quirks

00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:29.269
about the venue, that are not covered in those
above, you know attributes, you can add additional

00:11:29.269 --> 00:11:30.269
things there.

00:11:30.269 --> 00:11:34.370
I was going to quickly show you a video the
guys have put together on how to rate, which

00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:42.510
is kind of quirky and gives you a bit of insight,
a bit more detail on the rating system.

00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:47.370
[Film]
[Music]

00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:51.100
&gt;&gt;Jason: Hi my name is Jason.

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:53.149
I'm the founder of AXS Map.

00:11:53.149 --> 00:11:55.510
Today we're going to give you some tips on
giving reviews.

00:11:55.510 --> 00:12:00.269
So, let's hit the street.

00:12:00.269 --> 00:12:04.510
&gt;&gt;Alice: Hi I'm AXS map scout Alice.

00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:05.750
Today Jason's asked me to give a review.

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:07.709
I'm just about to stop here for a bite to
eat.

00:12:07.709 --> 00:12:08.709
So let's take a look.

00:12:08.709 --> 00:12:10.520
So as you can see this place is kind of amazing
for accessibility.

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:15.970
Huge entryway, totally flat, no lip here whatsoever
and no heavy door for anybody to open.

00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:17.850
I'm going to give this place five stars.

00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:19.430
So now that we're inside I'm going to check
a couple other features.

00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:22.760
The first thing I'm going to check is, is
it spacious?

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:26.360
This is spacious is really spacious.

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:30.600
Tap here to vote yes for spacious.

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:40.079
The other thing I'm checking to see if it's
it really quiet.

00:12:40.079 --> 00:12:43.740
It's a really great place, it's at the height
of brunch but it still the volume isn't too

00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:44.740
loud.

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:45.740
So I'm going to tap quiet.

00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:46.740
Now lets go check out the bathrooms.

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:47.740
In this place, like the entryway looks amazing.

00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:48.740
The key is the door opens out.

00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:49.740
It gives enough space for someone using a
wheelchair and an assistant to get inside.

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:50.740
Notice that it has a bar here and two bars,
key, having two bars.

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:54.690
The toilet is a decent height.

00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:58.779
The sink is a little high, but I'm still giving
it five stars.

00:12:58.779 --> 00:12:59.779
And that's it, that's my review.

00:12:59.779 --> 00:13:00.779
So that was fun.

00:13:00.779 --> 00:13:05.650
I also had lunch and the food here happens
to be amazing.

00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:09.980
So let's check out another place and give
another review.

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:14.300
[Music]
&gt;&gt;Alice: Ok so I'm going to stop in this shop.

00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:16.040
Looks like there's one step.

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:22.779
I'm going give it a two stars.

00:13:22.779 --> 00:13:29.810
But first I'm going to check to see if they
have a portable ramp, if they have portable

00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:30.810
ramp I'll give it four stars.

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:31.810
Let's go inside.

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:32.810
Ok so I just asked the shop owner and they
don't have a ramp, so I've gotta give it two

00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:33.810
stars.

00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:37.720
So Jason has another scout out giving reviews
today, let's check in with him.

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:39.480
&gt;&gt;Steve: Hi I'm AXS map scout Steve.

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:41.120
And I'm out giving reviews today.

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.460
So I'm at this Laundromat.

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:49.579
So you can see it's got two steps, so I'm
going to give that a one star rating.

00:13:49.579 --> 00:13:54.580
So this place's got one step, so I'm going
to give a two, before I do I want to check

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:58.820
to see if it's got maybe a portable ramp,
or if it's got an alternative entrance.

00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:02.440
Ok so they just told me there's an secondary
entrance around the back so let's go back

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:08.839
and check it out and see how good it is.

00:14:08.839 --> 00:14:13.940
Ok, so you can see they've got an accessible
door right here, so it's not clear from the

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:19.260
outside, so I wouldn't this a five, so I'm
going to give this place a four star rating.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:22.481
So this place has got one step, but I checked
inside but they've actually got a ramp, so

00:14:22.481 --> 00:14:30.529
we're going to get it out and see what it
looks like.

00:14:30.529 --> 00:14:32.269
Beautiful!

00:14:32.269 --> 00:14:34.009
Great!

00:14:34.009 --> 00:14:37.160
I'm going to give this place four stars.

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:40.949
Ok so I stopped at a hardware store and they
actually do have a ramp, but it's a bit steep,

00:14:40.949 --> 00:14:46.440
so instead of four I'm going to give it a
three star.

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:50.769
&gt;&gt;Jason: So that was some examples of how
to give reviews.

00:14:50.769 --> 00:14:58.230
Just to recap, that was a one, that was a
two, that was a three, the portable ramp was

00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:00.440
four and that was a five.

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:03.389
Keep in mind there is no wrong answer.

00:15:03.389 --> 00:15:06.580
And think like you're using a wheelchair or
a scooter.

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:09.880
And have fun!

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:18.380
[Music]
&gt;&gt;Kevin: Ok, so just continuing with some

00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:20.899
of the screens we put together just to give
you that insight.

00:15:20.899 --> 00:15:24.420
This is some screen shots from the mobile
apps we have.

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:28.899
As you can see it's kind of consistent with
the design and style that we put together

00:15:28.899 --> 00:15:30.079
for the main web.

00:15:30.079 --> 00:15:33.579
Bigger emphasis on kind of categories.

00:15:33.579 --> 00:15:36.820
Also taking the [inaudible] obviously I haven't
got a map screen up there, but you know it

00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:39.380
will hone in based on where you are of course.

00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:43.550
Ah, and then just on the right hand side there,
you can see the rating of the venue again

00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:46.500
consistent with the rest of the app.

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:53.399
Just taking a step back, designed like as
we saw started building it we had just sort

00:15:53.399 --> 00:15:56.170
of bunch of goals in mind.

00:15:56.170 --> 00:16:00.570
So they, you know, were kind of obvious emphasis
on simplicity and ease of use of course.

00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:05.480
And broad appeal, you saw in animation you
know trying to cover a range of use cases

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:06.480
obviously.

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:11.600
In Jason's case being in a scooter right through
to anyone, being a Mum with a stroller and

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:14.500
it was kind of everything in between.

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:17.100
From the interface perspective you've seen
the kind of colors there.

00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:20.959
We went for white on black, big fonts bigger
icons.

00:16:20.959 --> 00:16:24.070
So just again a big emphasis on ease of use.

00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:29.550
I actually worked with a few different designers
as well as including a fellow Googler, Rick

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:33.500
Farrell, so I want to say thanks to him for
some of his insights which were great.

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:38.641
and these are some actually screen shots,
or some wire frames we put together, some

00:16:38.641 --> 00:16:43.500
mock ups, jury you know before we actually
started any building and we made these interactive.

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:47.279
Which was great for, Jason and I to actually
kind of play around and move around within

00:16:47.279 --> 00:16:48.950
the app, obviously a pure simulation.

00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:51.480
Did that for the main web too.

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:57.160
And then on the right hand side there you
can see the the kind of actual first mock

00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:01.850
up we got put together for the mobile web
version.

00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:07.640
Terms of API and data, on the back end we're
using Google places API which has been great.

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:11.720
As you saw as well obviously using Google
maps and street view, you know it's great,

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:15.110
really really good services and to be honest
we couldn't have built this without some of

00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:16.110
those.

00:17:16.110 --> 00:17:19.570
In terms of the data we'll kind of recapture
and augment on top.

00:17:19.570 --> 00:17:25.230
It's been kind of interesting balance and
we've seen it as a journey, not a destination

00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:30.400
in so much that we try to get the balance
between you know capturing the relevant information,

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:35.030
you know to make and to allow someone to determine
whether it is accessible but not over burdening

00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:36.110
reviewers as well.

00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:41.000
So you know asking someone to ok give me fifty
different attributes when you're adding a

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.000
review.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.740
So we're trying to strike that balance and
we certainly welcome feedback on that.

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:48.320
And some points towards the end and how you
can give that feedback.

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:52.260
And finally in terms of our AP- We've built
an API as well.

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:56.080
Right now our apps consuming that API and
over time we intend to, well right now as

00:17:56.080 --> 00:18:00.390
of right now open that up to anyone else who
wants to interesting in consuming the data

00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:02.030
that we capture.

00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:06.230
From a build perspective I'm not going to
go into any depth here at all, it's just for

00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:09.630
those who are technical in the audience this
is a technology stack that we've used.

00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:14.280
In terms of testing we've actually worked
through, obviously Jason and then other members

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:18.850
of the community to get feedback out of it
and again you know very much intend to do

00:18:18.850 --> 00:18:20.940
that as we you know evolve the app.

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:25.380
And again just to reiterate throughout the
talk, the rest of the talk about getting feedback

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:27.410
from yourselves would be fantastic.

00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:33.270
So in terms of upcoming release it's kind
of live today, which is literally, like today

00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:37.840
is almost the launch of the first iteration,
beyond that you know very soon we've got a

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:42.070
new interaction coming which is going to have
photo uploads to allow people to take photos

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:44.880
of you know key things in and around the venues.

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:49.630
So be that outside the doorway or the restrooms,
which again to add that kind of visual layer

00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:51.040
on top which would be great.

00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:54.490
And richer filters as well so you can actually
do a search for something like show me the

00:18:54.490 --> 00:18:58.880
available you know restaurants in my area
that have Braille menus for example.

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:01.670
We got an android app coming really really
soon too.

00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:05.550
And then obviously incremental sort of tweaks
and fixes.

00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:08.770
And then bigger picture, just an insight into
some of the sort of more conceptual things

00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:13.080
we'd like to do, going from left to right,
getting gamification is something we'd been

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:17.420
exploring, so adding kind of incentivization
mechanics and getting mechanics on top to

00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:19.760
actually encourage people to add reviews.

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:25.730
The middle visualization as well, so you know
as we build this data set, actually adding

00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:29.450
visualization layers on top so you can answer
kind of questions and there's one up in there.

00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:30.610
How accessible is my city?

00:19:30.610 --> 00:19:33.960
Or that could be how accessible is my neighborhood
or my state or whatever.

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:36.970
So some interesting things we could certainly
start exploring there.

00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:41.910
And on the far right we've got augmented reality,
so just different interfaces on top of the

00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:42.910
data sets.

00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:46.910
We've just got a quick mock up which I'll
show you now, which is pretty nice about how

00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:48.790
this could work.

00:19:48.790 --> 00:19:54.380
&gt;&gt;Jason: Just just to give some personal context
is really I'm having trouble with my hands

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:59.300
right now it would be really great to be able
to hold up my phone to just see all the places

00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:01.630
around me that are accessible.

00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:08.200
&gt;&gt;Kevin: yeah that's cool stuff and as we
were talking with Eric about the Google glasses

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:11.750
another cool thing would be maybe add in on
down the line.

00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:15.810
Ah so with that I'm going to hand over to
Alice Cook who is the producer for AXS Maps

00:20:15.810 --> 00:20:17.790
to talk a bit about the future.

00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:20.510
&gt;&gt;Alice: Thanks.

00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:28.240
So when I'm not out scouting for Jason I'm
producing AXS Map, and first, so yeah and

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:32.940
I'm going to cover the future in terms of
how we're going to engage community and how

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:35.710
we're really going to get data into the app.

00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:40.120
So Jason founded a non-profit three years
ago called AXS Lab.

00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:45.800
Our mission is to supercharge the disability
movement, disability rights movement, to engage

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:50.630
audiences, to playfully explore the disability
experience, story is important to us as Eric

00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:55.040
said in the beginning and kind of the mission
behind the mission is to make the world a

00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:57.270
more compassionate, inclusive and enriching
place.

00:20:57.270 --> 00:21:02.040
So the first two big initiatives of AXS Lab
are the, Jason's film "When I Walk" and then,

00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:09.210
of course, AXS Map. so one of the ways we
think we're fulfilling our mission with AXS

00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:12.760
Map is is trying to give disab- a fresh identity
for disability.

00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:19.040
So everyone's familiar with this symbol on
the left is the international symbol for wheelchair

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:24.570
accessibility, it references the hospital
blue, sort of the medical model of the disability

00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:30.960
identity and so we want for AXS Map we wanted
a new identity that reflected the crowd source,

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:33.740
the empowered community of disability.

00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:40.890
So the idea was to use you know a strong yellow
and give it a sportier, more youthful, just

00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:43.500
a fresher identity for disability.

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:45.450
So these are our funders.

00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:49.550
We're so proud to be working with such a prestigious
group of funders.

00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:56.250
Google Earth as Eric mentioned, helped fund
us, and that grant was administered by the

00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:57.270
Tides Foundation.

00:21:57.270 --> 00:22:02.710
Our largest supporters are actually a prestigious
foundation in New York called the Nathan Cummings

00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:03.860
Foundation.

00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:06.190
They're really movers and shakers in the philanthropy
world.

00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:09.850
They called AXS Map their Jeremy Lin of philanthropic
endeavors.

00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:12.760
So we are really proud to be working with
them.

00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:17.850
Fledgling Fund is another, is behind us, and
of course, Finance and PBS are behind the

00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:20.040
film "When I walk."

00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:24.310
so the future of AXS Map, how we are going
to engage communities.

00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:26.160
the first thing is really populating the database.

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:30.250
Because it's not going to be a useful tool
until we get a lot of data in.

00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:33.200
And that way we're going to be doing that
is by holding community mapping days.

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:35.440
So I'll tell you a little bit about that.

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:38.320
We're also going to be encourage accessibility.

00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:42.560
We want to encourage business owners to become
accessible if their not already accessible.

00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:46.630
And then the last one, we think that the thing
that's really going to coalesce this as a

00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:52.200
movement is really about sharing stories and
gathering stories from the community.

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:56.030
So for business owners we're going to offering
window stickers.

00:22:56.030 --> 00:22:59.660
This is like our first way of engaging business
owners.

00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:05.650
And we think this is really, going to be a
fun way for business owners to distinguish

00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:06.650
themselves.

00:23:06.650 --> 00:23:10.430
They can put this in the window to show any
wheelchair users passing by that they are

00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:11.430
accessible.

00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:13.820
Maybe that their main entryway isn't but they
have an alternative entrance.

00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:17.870
The other really great thing is that is a
form of market distinction.

00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:22.400
So they can show that they're socially responsible
and this is something they care about.

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:28.420
so our mapping days, our first mapping day
was actually last year, May 12, 2011. and

00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:34.120
that went well, but we were just using clipboards
and going out across Brooklyn.

00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:39.740
So what happens on a mapping day we bring
together a group of volunteers, they meet

00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:44.140
in one place, we form teams and then they
fan out across a neighborhood, exploring the

00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:48.370
neighborhood on foot and inputting reviews
on accessibility.

00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:53.510
And one of the really fun things we're doing
on our mapping days is letting participants

00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:54.950
test drive a scooter.

00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:59.520
And I think able body participants test drive
a scooter just to experience what it's like

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:03.990
to navigate the world using a scooter.

00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:09.500
So the vision is, in the next year we would
have fif- we're working to set up partnerships

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:13.950
with big non- national non-profits to set
up mapping days so we'd have- This is a mock

00:24:13.950 --> 00:24:17.850
up that would be a page on the site to show
there'd be 50 mapping days all across the

00:24:17.850 --> 00:24:22.150
country and you could look here to find a
mapping day near you to get engaged.

00:24:22.150 --> 00:24:27.780
The other thing we think is important is this
is that, this is a grassroots sort of movement

00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:30.950
and that individuals can lead their own mapping
days.

00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:34.980
And actually we've already had some people
reaching out to us who want to host their

00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:35.980
own mapping day.

00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:41.060
Which is really exciting, and actually it
was just two weeks ago a student from upstate

00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:45.980
New York named Matthew reached out to us and
said that he wanted to lead a mapping day,

00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:50.210
we had a chance to video chat with him, just
a few days ago and so we're going to share

00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:54.170
that video chat with you with Matthew.

00:24:54.170 --> 00:25:03.490
&gt;&gt;Matthew: [computer voice] Hi my name is
Matthew Ballow; I'm almost 18 years old.

00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:09.380
I am from Clarence, New York which is a town
outside of Buffalo.

00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:13.270
I go to school at Clarence Senior High.

00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:16.680
I like to read and watch movies.

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:22.020
I also like to play computer games and board
games.

00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:29.460
I also like to go to the mall near my house,
bowling at my local bowling alley and out

00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:33.050
to different restaurants.

00:25:33.050 --> 00:25:40.980
AXS Map could give me more freedom, because
it would help me know in advance what places

00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:44.210
in my community I would be able to go.

00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:47.040
Where I can drive myself around.

00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:50.030
It is important to me to be independent.

00:25:50.030 --> 00:25:58.400
I need a lot of help with my daily tasks but
one thing I can do all by myself is drive

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:02.520
and operate my wheelchair.

00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:09.200
I think AXS Map will help both people in wheelchairs
and people who are with people who are in

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:11.840
wheelchairs.

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:18.130
Personally it is frustrating when I cannot
get around some place for both me and whoever

00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:21.300
is with me.

00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:24.330
I would like to lead a mapping day.

00:26:24.330 --> 00:26:31.520
I think it will be fun to travel around my
community and see where I can go.

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:38.170
I also would like to do this because it will
help other people in my community who are

00:26:38.170 --> 00:26:47.030
in a wheelchairs and face the same challenges
I do when they want to go out.

00:26:47.030 --> 00:26:48.550
Nice to meet you.

00:26:48.550 --> 00:26:56.530
&gt;&gt;Alice: So that's Matthew and we're so excited
that he reached out to us and we think it's

00:26:56.530 --> 00:27:00.330
a great example of how individuals can step
up and lead up mapping days.

00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:04.830
And we also think his story is a great story
for showing why accessibility matters.

00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:08.480
When you have such great challenges and for
Matthew the one thing he can really do is

00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:14.610
drive and operate his wheelchair, it means
a lot when he can he can get in a business

00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:15.610
or a restaurant.

00:27:15.610 --> 00:27:20.630
So on that note, we're actually having a mapping
day this Saturday in San Francisco and we're

00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:22.710
inviting Googlers to attend.

00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:25.930
It's near Soma at the 155 Ninth Street.

00:27:25.930 --> 00:27:30.890
The time 12:15 you can RSVP to Jason if you're
interested.

00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:36.020
Really thank you to Eric for coordinating
this and a thank you to our other supporters,

00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:39.580
the Google, Google Earth team, Tanya Birch
and Raleigh Seamster have been really supportive

00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:44.160
of the project and I think we could open it
up to questions.

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:45.160
Yeah.

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:47.340
[Clapping]
&gt;&gt;Alice: Thank you.
