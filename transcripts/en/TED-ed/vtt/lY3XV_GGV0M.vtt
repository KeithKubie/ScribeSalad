00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
So what is gravity?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I bet most of you think it's:

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
"What goes up,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
must come down!" Is that right?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Well, sorta, but not really.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Technically, the law of gravity is an equation.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
It is: F = G x M1 x M2 / R^2,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
where G is the universal gravitational constant,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
M1 and M2 are the masses of the two objects,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.984
and R is the distance between them squared.

00:00:40.984 --> 00:00:42.461
That was easy, right?

00:00:42.461 --> 00:00:45.000
Probably not. What does this actually mean?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Well it means that - well, everything is attracted to everything else.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.584
What I mean by that is if you have two objects, any two objects,

00:00:54.584 --> 00:00:57.000
they are attracted to each other. OK.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Let's try and wrap our minds around this.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
What happens when you drop a rock off a cliff?

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.676
It falls to the earth. Right?

00:01:03.676 --> 00:01:07.076
Well, yes, but something else happens.

00:01:07.076 --> 00:01:10.000
You see, the law of gravity says that both objects,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.046
the rock and the earth, are attracted to each other.

00:01:14.046 --> 00:01:16.000
This means that the rock falls towards the earth,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.323
and the earth falls towards the rock.

00:01:19.323 --> 00:01:24.507
Wait a second - you mean to tell me that if - the earth falls up to meet the rock?

00:01:24.507 --> 00:01:27.061
Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying.

00:01:27.061 --> 00:01:29.753
And the reason you don't see the earth fall up to meet the rock

00:01:29.753 --> 00:01:34.000
is because the objects move towards each other proportionate to their respective masses.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.830
The earth is much much much more massive than the rock,

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.800
so it moves a very very small distance,

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.292
and the rock is much less massive, so it moves farther

00:01:44.292 --> 00:01:46.384
with respect to the earth.

00:01:46.384 --> 00:01:49.384
Maybe a better way to understand gravity is to take two teenagers

00:01:49.384 --> 00:01:53.000
in spacesuits, and place them far out in space - away from all the planets and the stars.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
It turns out they will be attracted to each other.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
I'm not talking about that kind of attraction.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
See, they have mass, and since they have mass,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
they will move towards each other.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
They are attracted to each other.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Maybe one more thing might help. Have you ever played with two magnets?

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
You know, the magnets with the north and the south poles?

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
When you take the magnets and put them closer to each other,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
they move together. They are attracted to each other.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
And the closer they are, the stronger the attraction.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Think of the mass of the object like the strength of a magnet

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.753
and the distance between the objects like the distance between the two magnets.

00:02:28.753 --> 00:02:32.000
Now understand, I'm not saying that gravity and magnetism are the same,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
they just behave in a similar way.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.784
Let's think of one other thing - astronauts.

00:02:37.784 --> 00:02:39.753
You know, astronauts, they weigh less on the moon

00:02:39.753 --> 00:02:42.198
than on the earth. Why is that?

00:02:42.198 --> 00:02:46.000
Well you see, the moon is less massive than the earth.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Therefore it has a smaller gravitational pull on the astronaut.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
It's like the moon is a weaker magnet.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
They aren't as attracted to each other.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.615
Distance also plays a role. Think back to playing with a magnet.

00:02:56.615 --> 00:02:59.000
The pull of the magnets towards each other

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
are stronger when they are closer together. The same is true of gravity.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
For example, the sun is the most massive object near the earth.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.861
It dictates most of the gravitational forces in our solar system.

00:03:09.861 --> 00:03:14.261
It is very very massive. But it is relatively far away,

00:03:14.261 --> 00:03:17.938
so even though the sun is a much stronger magnet, so to speak,

00:03:17.938 --> 00:03:20.000
it is a long ways away.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Therefore the attraction isn't as strong.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.183
So let's look back at that law of gravity.

00:03:25.183 --> 00:03:30.000
The equation: F = G x M1 x M2 / R ^2.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.261
You see the force of gravity is equal to a number.

00:03:33.261 --> 00:03:36.000
That's that universal gravitational constant G

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.415
times the mass of object one, times the mass of object two.

00:03:39.415 --> 00:03:42.000
Think of M1 being the mass of the sun

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.553
and M2 being the mass of the earth.

00:03:44.553 --> 00:03:48.000
And then we divide by the distance between them squared.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
This determines the force of attraction between the sun and earth.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
You could just as easily plug in your mass

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.061
and the earth's mass and the distance between you and the center of the earth,

00:03:59.061 --> 00:04:01.000
and find out how much you are attracted to the earth,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
and the earth attracted to you.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
So, what's gravity?

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Everything is attracted to everything else.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Everything. Oh, one last thing,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
just to make you wonder. What causes gravity?

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.338
Why are two objects with mass attracted to each other?

00:04:17.338 --> 00:04:20.000
Well, the answer is -

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.184
We don't know.

00:04:21.184 --> 00:04:24.000
The cause of gravity remains a mystery to scientists.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.492
We don't really know conclusively what causes gravity.

00:04:28.492 --> 00:04:32.184
It is one of the great mysteries of science.
