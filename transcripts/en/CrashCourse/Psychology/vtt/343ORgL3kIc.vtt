00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.240
All right, so you might have read "The Hobbit"
or "The Lord of the Rings," you have probably

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.700
seen them, you've definitely heard of them.
But not everyone knows the story of their

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:13.590
author, J.R.R. Tolkien. Tolkien was an English
World War One veteran. A reluctant solider,

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.470
he joined up with a sense of duty and he lived
through the bloody battle of Somme suffering

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.259
tremendous shock, guilt, and loss during and
after the war.

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:27.429
It took Tolkien years to processes his experiences.
To help him do it he turned to writing fiction

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:33.040
and in time he constructed a world that helped
him and all of us better understand war, human

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.320
nature, loss, and growth. His novels were
the bi-product of trauma and they're among

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.980
the more beautiful reminders of how it can
affect us.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.160
Most of us will experience some kind of traumatic
event in our lives and most of us will exhibit

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.010
some kind of stress related behavior because
of it, these symptoms usually fade but for

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.480
some those reactions can linger and start
of disrupt their lives or the lives of those

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.650
around them. These reactions can develop into
full blown psychological disorders including

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.870
post-traumatic stress disorder and, in an effort
to cope, sometimes addiction, but it doesn't

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.620
always have to be that way.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.940
Ultimately, Tolkien was able to harness the
effect of his trauma and shape them into something

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:12.460
important and to reclaim is own life because there
is such a thing as post-traumatic growth, too.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.140
As it does with many other things psychology
approaches trauma related disorders with different

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.260
perspectives, but they all tend to ask the
same questions.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.890
How do you identify and diagnose these disorders?
And how do you treat them, so that the patients

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.510
can recover? -- With the understanding that
they might never be the same as they were

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.590
before the trauma, but they can still be healthy
and happy.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.770
In a way, psychology helps patients ask themselves,
what Tolkien asks his readers, and what Frodo

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.340
asks when he is finally safe back in the shire:
"How do you pick up the threads of an old

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.600
life? How to go on, when in your heart, you
begin to understand that there is no going back."

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.580
It could be September 11 or a serious car
accident or a natural disaster or a violent

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.210
crime that you survived but are still haunted
by. Trauma comes in many different forms and

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.080
sometimes it can stick with you.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:15.730
When it manifests as nightmares, flashbacks,
avoidance, fear, guilt, anxiety, rage, insomnia,

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.310
and begins to interfere with your ability
to function it can come to be known as post-traumatic

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.230
stress disorder or PTSD.

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.920
It was once call "shell shock" a term used
to describe the condition of veterans, like

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.670
Tolkien in World War One but PTSD isn't limited
to veterans. It's defined as a psychological

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.390
disorder generated by either witnessing or
experiencing a traumatic event. Its symptoms

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.250
are classified into four major clusters in
the DSM V.

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.880
One of these clusters involves re-living the
event through intrusive memories, nightmares,

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.200
or flashbacks. The second involves avoiding
situations you associate with the event, while

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.959
the third generally describes excessive physiological
arousal like heart pounding, muscle tension,

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.510
anxiety or irritability, and major problems
sleeping or concentrating. And finally we

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:05.140
have the fourth major symptom cluster: pervasive
negative changes in emotions and belief, like

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.580
feelings in excessive guilt, fear, or shame -- or no
longer getting enjoyment out of what you used to.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.470
PTSD patients may also experience numbing,
or periods of feeling emotionless or emotionally

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:21.420
"flat" and dissociation, feeling as if situations
aren't real or are surreal, feeling like time

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.930
has slowed down or sped up, or even blacking
out.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.730
We have been discussing how anxiety or mood
disorders can affect a person's ability to

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.160
function and how that impairment itself leads
to more suffering and dysfunction.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.739
When any of these disorders is left untreated
suffers may start to feel desperate to find

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:41.200
some way to cope and one way may be substance
abuse. Unfortunately, addiction and trauma

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.700
can go hand in hand and it can be hard to
recover from one without also dealing with

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.480
the other. According to the US department
of Veteran's Affairs more than 2 in 10 veterans

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.190
with PTSD also struggle with substance abuse
problems and 1 in every 3 vets seeking

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.860
treatment for substance abuse also have PTSD.
And across many studies, between a third to

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:02.260
a half of women in treatment for substance
abuse have experienced rape or sexual assault.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:07.030
For a long time most psychologists understood
PTSD through the lens of fear conditioning

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.860
or the unshakable memory of being in mortal
danger and the learned responses that stem

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.680
from that memory. But clinicians have also
begun to recognize that for some the disorder

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:21.130
can also be a kind of moral injury, widening
the focus to include hauntings not just of

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:26.250
violence done to a person but also what that
person did or did not do to others.

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.370
Brandon was a combat drone operator in the
air force he enlisted at 21 years old and

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.610
spent 6 years sitting in a bunker in the American
South-West watching Iraq and Afghanistan from

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:36.780
surveillance drones.

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:42.440
He watched soldiers die and people get executed.
He also watched kids play, people get married,

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.180
goats grazing -- and when the time came he
ordered hell fire missiles to strike military

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.370
targets or people who had no idea they where
even being watched.

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.560
Although he was half a world away from combat,
he ultimately suffered the psychological trauma

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.900
felt by many on the ground soldiers. He was
diagnosed with PTSD. Brandon suffers no fears

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:06.509
for his own safety, but still experiences
the same intrusive memories, nightmares, depression,

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:11.630
anxiety, and substance abuse of many emotionally
traumatized combat soldiers. So do a lot of

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:12.530
other drone operators.

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:18.290
But why do some victims or trauma suffer from
PTSD while others seem able to move on?

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:22.710
Well, its psychology so the risk factors are
complicated. Some findings suggest that there

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:26.680
may be genetic predispositions making some
people more vulnerable than others. We also

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.800
know that context and environment matter,
for instance, someone who has experienced

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.160
childhood abuse might feel on the one hand
more ready to deal with difficult and traumatic

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.540
experiences. But on the other hand they might
be more likely to default to the suppression

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:43.509
and avoidance in which PTSD suffers frequently
engage, which as we've discussed in previous

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:46.889
episodes often makes psychiatric symptoms
worsen over time.

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:52.259
As far as whats going on in the brain, PTSD
shares some similarities with anxiety disorders.

00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:56.539
For example the brains limbic system may flood
the body with waves of stress hormones like

00:05:56.539 --> 00:06:01.009
cortisol every time images of the traumatic
event bubble up uninvited into consciousness.

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:05.310
And we've already talked a lot about how the
amygdala and hippocampus are involved in those

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:10.430
classic fight or flight reactions, which when
prolonged can be really rough on the body.

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:14.660
In fact, neuroimaging suggests that trauma
-- or the chemical processes set into motion

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:19.210
by trauma -- might actually damage and shrink
the hippocampus. Since this region is also

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:23.680
associated with how we consolidate memories,
this might explain how memories associated

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:28.680
with trauma could fail to be filed away as
long-term memories and instead remain vivid

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.150
and fresh through flashbacks and nightmares.

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:35.460
If there's any silver lining to all of this,
it's that some people may actually experience

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:40.120
positive change after a trauma. Treatment
and social support help some suffers achieve

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:45.199
post-traumatic growth, positive psychological
changes resulting from the struggle with challenging

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:47.270
circumstances and life crises.

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:52.210
That's in part what Tolkien did. Though he
suffered great trauma and loss on the battlefield,

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:58.550
he was eventually able to use those experiences
to drive those powerful, allegorical stories. Stories

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:02.960
that helped not just himself, but many readers
of all ages around the world.

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:07.550
It seems that while whatever doesn't kill
you might not necessarily make you stronger,

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:09.030
sometimes it really does.

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:13.810
But suffering can feed on itself. Many victims
of trauma try to cope through whats colloquially

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:18.910
called self-medicating and some can end up
with substance abuse or dependence issues.

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:23.699
Psychologists define addiction or dependence
as compulsive, excessive, and difficult-to-control

00:07:23.699 --> 00:07:29.120
substance use, or other, initially pleasurable
behavior that beings to interfere with ordinary

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.380
life, work, health, or relationships.

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:36.100
This could mean over-consuming drugs or alcohol,
or compulsively gambling, eating, shopping,

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:40.569
exercising, or having sex. People with addictions
may not even realize that they have lost control

00:07:40.569 --> 00:07:42.369
of their behavior for some time.

00:07:42.369 --> 00:07:47.240
Addiction can refer to a physical dependence,
a physiological need for a drug, that reveals

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:52.169
itself through terrible withdrawal symptoms
if the use stops or reduces. Or psychological

00:07:52.169 --> 00:07:56.500
dependence, the need to use that drug, or
complete that activity in order to relieve

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:57.580
negative emotions.

00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:02.479
People with addiction can sometimes be stigmatized
as pleasure-bound hedonists who have no self-control,

00:08:02.479 --> 00:08:07.229
but people often compulsively use substances
or do things in reaction to stress and other

00:08:07.229 --> 00:08:11.949
psychological problems. For various reasons
they have been prevented from coping in other

00:08:11.949 --> 00:08:14.169
ways or maybe they just never learned how.

00:08:14.169 --> 00:08:19.220
So in this way addiction itself is often secondary
to the more complicated matter of how a person

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:24.720
deals with stress and difficult emotions, or what
kinds of stressful situations they've survived.

00:08:24.729 --> 00:08:29.840
Few will dispute that much of what makes addiction
possible is chemistry, but people are different

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:34.749
-- from their life experiences to their biological
sensitivities. So people respond in different

00:08:34.749 --> 00:08:39.259
way to different drugs and behaviors. Many
people can drink casually or gamble once in

00:08:39.259 --> 00:08:42.509
a while without losing control. Others simply
can't.

00:08:42.509 --> 00:08:46.350
People in recovery from addiction may also
have different needs. Some will need to be

00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:51.209
completely sober and never again touch that
drug or do that thing. While others may in

00:08:51.209 --> 00:08:55.059
time be able to regain enough control to use
again in moderation.

00:08:55.059 --> 00:08:59.279
Likewise, some folks can kick the habit on
their own while others do better with or need

00:08:59.279 --> 00:09:01.800
support from professionals or support groups.

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:06.219
Researchers and groups like Alcoholics Anonymous
debate whether addiction is a mental illness

00:09:06.219 --> 00:09:10.749
-- like a "software problem" related to thoughts, and
behaviors, and feelings -- or a physical disease

00:09:10.749 --> 00:09:15.029
-- a "hard wire problem" related to biology
and genetics -- or both, and even whether

00:09:15.029 --> 00:09:17.369
addiction and dependence are the same thing.

00:09:17.369 --> 00:09:21.319
Either way it can be hard to recover from
an addiction if you don't get the underlying

00:09:21.319 --> 00:09:26.059
problem treated. But some people believe that
you can't treat the underlying problem without

00:09:26.059 --> 00:09:28.420
first getting the addiction out of the way.

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:32.779
While this controversy too continues, many
are moving toward a model of treating both

00:09:32.779 --> 00:09:37.050
at at the same time. The so-called Dual Diagnosis
Model of treatment.

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:40.939
Addiction that's rooted in deeper psychological
issues -- especially in emotional trauma like

00:09:40.939 --> 00:09:45.389
PTSD -- often require some version of dual
treatment to untangle both issues.

00:09:45.389 --> 00:09:50.369
The good news is while PTSD and substance
dependence may be distressing and complex,

00:09:50.369 --> 00:09:53.999
people can begin to heal given the chance
and the resources.

00:09:53.999 --> 00:09:59.379
We're amazingly resilient creatures. When nurtured with
the proper support and practice, we can overcome a lot.

00:09:59.389 --> 00:10:04.249
Today we talked about the causes and symptoms
of PTSD and how trauma can affect the brain.

00:10:04.249 --> 00:10:08.600
We also looked at addiction, physical and
psychological dependence, the relationship

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:13.639
between trauma and addiction, and why they
can require dual treatment, and we touched on

00:10:13.639 --> 00:10:16.939
post-traumatic growth with the wisdom of Frodo
Baggins.
