00:00:06.912 --> 00:00:09.110
He was one of the most influential figures

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:10.775
of the 20th century,

00:00:10.775 --> 00:00:12.360
forever changing the course

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.960
of one of the world's largest countries.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.254
But was he a hero

00:00:16.254 --> 00:00:17.963
who toppled an oppressive tyranny

00:00:17.963 --> 00:00:20.967
or a villain who replaced it with another?

00:00:20.967 --> 00:00:23.193
It's time to put Lenin on the stand

00:00:23.193 --> 00:00:26.138
in History vs. Lenin.

00:00:26.138 --> 00:00:28.025
"Order, order, hmm.

00:00:28.025 --> 00:00:32.769
Now, wasn't it your fault that the band broke up?"

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:36.359
"Your honor, this is Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov,

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:38.233
AKA Lenin, the rabblerouser

00:00:38.233 --> 00:00:42.740
who helped overthrow 
the Russian tsar Nicholas II in 1917

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.276
and founded the Soviet Union,

00:00:45.276 --> 00:00:48.776
one of the worst dictatorships of the 20th century."

00:00:48.776 --> 00:00:50.776
"Ohh."

00:00:50.776 --> 00:00:52.776
"The tsar was a bloody tyrant

00:00:52.776 --> 00:00:55.667
under whom the masses toiled in slavery."

00:00:55.667 --> 00:00:57.377
"This is rubbish.

00:00:57.377 --> 00:01:01.494
Serfdom had already been abolished in 1861."

00:01:01.494 --> 00:01:03.161
"And replaced by something worse.

00:01:03.161 --> 00:01:04.969
The factory bosses treated the people

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:08.180
far worse than their former feudal landlords.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.743
And unlike the landlords,

00:01:09.743 --> 00:01:12.102
they were always there.

00:01:12.102 --> 00:01:16.523
Russian workers toiled for eleven hours a day

00:01:16.523 --> 00:01:19.942
and were the lowest paid in all of Europe."

00:01:19.942 --> 00:01:23.154
"But Tsar Nicholas made laws to protect the workers."

00:01:23.154 --> 00:01:27.366
"He reluctantly did the bare minimum to avert revolution,

00:01:27.366 --> 00:01:29.410
and even there, he failed.

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.244
Remember what happened in 1905

00:01:31.244 --> 00:01:35.126
after his troops fired on peaceful petitioners?"

00:01:35.126 --> 00:01:36.994
"Yes, and the tsar ended the rebellion

00:01:36.994 --> 00:01:38.877
by introducing a constitution

00:01:38.877 --> 00:01:41.548
and an elected parliament, the Duma."

00:01:41.548 --> 00:01:45.562
"While retaining absolute power and dissolving them

00:01:45.562 --> 00:01:46.994
whenever he wanted."

00:01:46.994 --> 00:01:49.430
"Perhaps there would've been more reforms in due time

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.598
if radicals, like Lenin,

00:01:51.598 --> 00:01:53.685
weren't always stirring up trouble."

00:01:53.685 --> 00:01:57.688
"Your Honor, Lenin had seen his older brother Aleksandr

00:01:57.688 --> 00:02:03.026
executed by the previous tsar for revolutionary activity,

00:02:03.026 --> 00:02:04.696
and even after the reforms,

00:02:04.696 --> 00:02:09.410
Nicholas continued the same mass repression and executions,

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.243
as well as the unpopular involvement

00:02:11.243 --> 00:02:13.411
in World War I,

00:02:13.411 --> 00:02:17.206
that cost Russia so many lives and resources."

00:02:17.206 --> 00:02:18.626
"Hm, this tsar doesn't sound like

00:02:18.626 --> 00:02:20.412
such a capital fellow."

00:02:20.412 --> 00:02:23.047
"Your Honor, maybe Nicholas II did doom himself

00:02:23.047 --> 00:02:24.328
with bad decisions,

00:02:24.328 --> 00:02:26.911
but Lenin deserves no credit for this.

00:02:26.911 --> 00:02:29.009
When the February 1917 uprisings

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:31.180
finally forced the tsar to abdicate,

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.993
Lenin was still exiled in Switzerland."

00:02:33.993 --> 00:02:36.060
"Hm, so who came to power?"

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.676
"The Duma formed a provisional government,

00:02:38.676 --> 00:02:40.578
led by Alexander Kerensky,

00:02:40.578 --> 00:02:43.275
an incompetent bourgeois failure.

00:02:43.275 --> 00:02:46.269
He even launched another failed offensive in the war,

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:49.282
where Russia had already lost so much,

00:02:49.282 --> 00:02:52.828
instead of ending it like the people wanted."

00:02:52.828 --> 00:02:55.287
"It was a constitutional social democratic government,

00:02:55.287 --> 00:02:57.327
the most progressive of its time.

00:02:57.327 --> 00:02:59.495
And it could have succeeded eventually

00:02:59.495 --> 00:03:01.628
if Lenin hadn't returned in April,

00:03:01.628 --> 00:03:05.078
sent by the Germans to undermine the Russian war effort

00:03:05.078 --> 00:03:07.412
and instigate riots."

00:03:07.412 --> 00:03:09.078
"Such slander!

00:03:09.078 --> 00:03:12.346
The July Days were a spontaneous and justified reaction

00:03:12.346 --> 00:03:15.057
against the government's failures.

00:03:15.057 --> 00:03:17.100
And Kerensky showed his true colors

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.935
when he blamed Lenin

00:03:18.935 --> 00:03:22.078
and arrested and outlawed his Bolshevik party,

00:03:22.078 --> 00:03:24.232
forcing him to flee into exile again.

00:03:24.232 --> 00:03:25.942
Some democracy!

00:03:25.942 --> 00:03:27.697
It's a good thing the government collapsed

00:03:27.697 --> 00:03:30.362
under their own incompetence and greed

00:03:30.362 --> 00:03:32.497
when they tried to stage a military coup

00:03:32.497 --> 00:03:35.662
then had to ask the Bolsheviks for help

00:03:35.662 --> 00:03:37.622
when it backfired.

00:03:37.622 --> 00:03:39.327
After that, all Lenin had to do

00:03:39.327 --> 00:03:42.745
was return in October and take charge.

00:03:42.745 --> 00:03:46.162
The government was peacefully overthrown overnight."

00:03:46.162 --> 00:03:48.245
"But what the Bolsheviks did

00:03:48.245 --> 00:03:49.635
after gaining power

00:03:49.635 --> 00:03:51.077
wasn't very peaceful.

00:03:51.077 --> 00:03:53.413
How many people did they execute without trial?

00:03:53.413 --> 00:03:55.013
And was it really necessary

00:03:55.013 --> 00:03:59.850
to murder the tsar's entire family, even the children?"

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.229
"Russia was being attacked by foreign imperialists,

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:04.274
trying to restore the tsar.

00:04:04.274 --> 00:04:06.661
Any royal heir that was rescued

00:04:06.661 --> 00:04:09.610
would be recognized as ruler by foreign governments.

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.030
It would've been the end

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.410
of everything the people had fought so hard to achieve.

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.534
Besides, Lenin may not have given the order."

00:04:16.534 --> 00:04:18.036
"But it was not only imperialists

00:04:18.036 --> 00:04:19.664
that the Bolsheviks killed.

00:04:19.664 --> 00:04:21.414
What about the purges and executions

00:04:21.414 --> 00:04:23.583
of other socialist and anarchist parties,

00:04:23.583 --> 00:04:25.126
their old allies?

00:04:25.126 --> 00:04:26.627
What about the Tambov Rebellion,

00:04:26.627 --> 00:04:29.211
where peasants, resisting grain confiscation,

00:04:29.211 --> 00:04:32.175
were killed with poison gas?

00:04:32.175 --> 00:04:33.427
Or sending the army

00:04:33.427 --> 00:04:35.044
to crush the workers in Kronstadt,

00:04:35.044 --> 00:04:37.127
who were demanding democratic self-management?

00:04:37.127 --> 00:04:39.794
Was this still fighting for the people?"

00:04:39.794 --> 00:04:42.377
"Yes! The measures were difficult,

00:04:42.377 --> 00:04:44.230
but it was a difficult time.

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:46.271
The new government needed to secure itself

00:04:46.271 --> 00:04:48.360
while being attacked from all sides,

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.488
so that the socialist order could be established."

00:04:51.488 --> 00:04:54.044
"And what good came of this socialist order?

00:04:54.044 --> 00:04:55.711
Even after the civil war was won,

00:04:55.711 --> 00:04:57.653
there were famines, repression

00:04:57.653 --> 00:05:01.126
and millions executed or sent to die in camps,

00:05:01.126 --> 00:05:04.060
while Lenin's successor Stalin established

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.420
a cult of personality and absolute power."

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.293
"That wasn't the plan.

00:05:09.293 --> 00:05:11.211
Lenin never cared for personal gains,

00:05:11.211 --> 00:05:12.757
even his enemies admitted

00:05:12.757 --> 00:05:14.376
that he fully believed in his cause,

00:05:14.376 --> 00:05:16.961
living modestly and working tirelessly

00:05:16.961 --> 00:05:20.462
from his student days until his too early death.

00:05:20.462 --> 00:05:22.127
He saw how power-hungry Stalin was

00:05:22.127 --> 00:05:23.979
and tried to warn the party,

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:25.936
but it was too late."

00:05:25.936 --> 00:05:28.461
"And the decades of totalitarianism that followed after?"

00:05:28.461 --> 00:05:30.484
"You could call it that,

00:05:30.484 --> 00:05:32.960
but it was Lenin's efforts that changed Russia

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.611
in a few decades

00:05:34.611 --> 00:05:37.573
from a backward and undeveloped monarchy

00:05:37.573 --> 00:05:39.786
full of illiterate peasants

00:05:39.786 --> 00:05:42.795
to a modern, industrial superpower,

00:05:42.795 --> 00:05:45.711
with one of the world's best educated populations,

00:05:45.711 --> 00:05:48.711
unprecedented opportunities for women,

00:05:48.711 --> 00:05:51.505
and some of the most important scientific advancements

00:05:51.505 --> 00:05:53.211
of the century.

00:05:53.211 --> 00:05:55.008
Life may not have been luxurious,

00:05:55.008 --> 00:05:57.544
but nearly everyone had a roof over their head

00:05:57.544 --> 00:05:59.347
and food on their plate,

00:05:59.347 --> 00:06:01.349
which few countries have achieved."

00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:03.294
"But these advances could still have happened,

00:06:03.294 --> 00:06:04.852
even without Lenin

00:06:04.852 --> 00:06:06.977
and the repressive regime he established."

00:06:06.977 --> 00:06:09.543
"Yes, and I could've been a famous rock and roll singer.

00:06:09.543 --> 00:06:13.651
But how would I have sounded?"

00:06:13.651 --> 00:06:16.239
We can never be sure how things could've unfolded

00:06:16.239 --> 00:06:18.073
if different people were in power

00:06:18.073 --> 00:06:19.964
or different decisions were made,

00:06:19.964 --> 00:06:22.077
but to avoid the mistakes of the past,

00:06:22.077 --> 00:06:23.663
we must always be willing

00:06:23.663 --> 00:06:26.915
to put historical figures on trial.
