00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:12.780
Nuclear power is like the unloved child of
sustainable energy.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.700
It’s got so much potential, but it only
gets noticed when it does something wrong.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:27.300
If only people could just see how cool it
is.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.140
Ahoy-hoy fallout boys and girls, Julian here
for DNews and today we’re going to talk

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.690
about nuclear power.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.329
Now I know this is an element that splits
the internet and leads to an explosive chain

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:43.810
reaction (see what I did there?) but we are
going to gingerly handle this sensitive material

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.510
like the science-loving adults that we are.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.690
The most popular green energies people like
to discuss are solar and wind power, and I

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:57.980
agree, the idea of harnessing the phenomenal
cosmic power of the sun and...snazzy earthy

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.109
blowingness of wind is pretty cool.

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:04.559
But we’re going to have to upscale our production
in a big way if we are going to meet demands.

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.930
Last year in the US, wind provided 4.13% of
our power, and solar?

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.520
A microscopic .23%.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.830
So we’d need almost 25 times as much of
each just to meet demands, not to mention

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.930
we’d have to overproduce and store energy
for when it’s dark and not windy.

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.290
And we’ll have to build the storage facilities.

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.930
Meanwhile nuclear provides 19% of our energy
in this country, but we’re using an idea

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.290
we haven’t updated since the 50’s; the
Light Water Reactor.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.740
Light Water Reactors split uranium 235 to
heat water.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.200
In the US this water is kept at extremely
high pressures to keep it in liquid form.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.800
This super-heated super-pressurized water
then heats a second loop of water, turning

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.320
it to steam and driving a turbine.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.130
Reactors like this became widespread because
of their simplicity, but they only use about

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.580
5% of their fuel and the waste is radioactive
for 10,000 years.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.030
The fuel can be recycled though.

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.770
France has been relying on nuclear power since
the 70s and by recycling, the total amount

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:08.040
of high-level waste that could give a family
of 4 power from when the kids are born until

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.450
they’re in college is about the volume of
a cigarette lighter.

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.600
You still have to put that somewhere, and
waste storage is one of the major dividing

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.600
issues.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.090
Don’t kid yourself though, in California
alone the production of solar panels makes

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:26.660
over 13 million tons of toxic waste annually,
and that’s just stored somewhere too.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.740
There’s no such thing as a free lunch.

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.640
Molten Salt Reactors were a competing idea
that were shelved in the 60’s, despite the

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.830
fact that engineers built reactors that proved
they could work.

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.890
Lately interest in them is growing because
of their potential benefits.

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.170
The concept is liquid salt is the reactor’s
coolant, meaning it doesn’t need to be pressurized

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.980
like it’s light water counterparts.

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.500
This means there’s no complications from
loss of pressure like the rapid expansion

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.790
of radioactive gas or loss of coolant to the
reactor.

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.560
In fact it’s possible to design molten salt
reactors in such a way that they are self-regulating

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.560
and melt-down proof.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.560
Pretty neat, huh?

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.640
And it gets better, Molten Salt Reactors that
would use Thorium as their fuel source would

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.390
use almost 100% of their fuel.

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.310
And they would breed more of their own.

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.000
When thorium 232 is hit with a neutron, it
absorbs it and eventually decays into uranium

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000
233.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.850
U-233 is fissile, and shoots out 2 or 3 more
neutrons.

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.850
These can keep the chain reaction going and
also bombard more thorium to generate more

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:20.850
uranium.

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.740
Thorium has the benefit of being 3 to 4 times
more abundant than uranium, and right now

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.270
is just a hazardous waste byproduct of rare-earth
mining.

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.670
So we’re already digging the stuff up, and
have nothing to use it for.

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.770
Thorium 232 has a half-life of over 14 billion
years, but once it’s been used in a Liquid

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:40.880
Fluoride Thorium Reactor, 80% of the waste
decays to safe levels in 10 years.

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:41.880
A small amount would need up to 300 years
before it was safe, but that beats 10,000

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:42.880
years by a long shot.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.569
And the products of a LFTR reactor are harder
to use for nuclear weapons, so there’s less

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:47.780
of a worry about nuclear proliferation.

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.090
Not that we don’t have enough weapons to
murderize everyone already.

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.040
MSRs still have issues of their own to work
out, like keeping the liquid fluorides from

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.740
corroding the metal they’re stored in.

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.959
China thinks they can solve these problems
and make safer, more sustainable, and less

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.120
polluting nuclear power.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.860
They’ve planned to have a functioning thorium
reactor within the next decade.

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:10.440
If you’re worried about the storage of nuclear
waste, Anthony has some pretty cool info for

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.180
you here about how it’s compacted and stored.

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.110
What are your thoughts on the future of energy?

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:17.199
Do you have a personal favorite solution?

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:18.650
Let us know in the comments.

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:30.229
I’ll see you next time on DNews.
