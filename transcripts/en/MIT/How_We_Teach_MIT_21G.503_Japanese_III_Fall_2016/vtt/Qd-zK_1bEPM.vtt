TAKAKO AIKAWA: So we had
two different sessions.

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:13.530
One is grammar session, and
the other one is drill session.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.000
Grammar session is to teach or
introduce new grammar items,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.430
and usually, we do
this grammar session,

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:26.200
we are using English, especially
for beginners classes.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:31.060
The drill session is to practice
what students have learned

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.790
in grammar session,
so lots of drills

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.200
and interactive activities
in class, and drills sessions

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.700
are entirely in Japanese, even
from day two of the first year.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.500
And in terms of
proportion, we usually

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.930
spend one day for
grammar session

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:56.510
and four to five days for
drill sessions per each lesson.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.560
So for grammar
session, the students

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:04.269
are supposed to read grammar
notes of the textbook, so

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.350
each lesson, we have grammar
notes on the textbook.

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.330
And at the same
time, each lesson

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.250
introduces 40 to 50
new vocabularies,

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.810
so students are supposed to
learn those new vocabularies as

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:20.980
well.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.400
For drill sessions,
we have a lot

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.500
of online interactive
exercises, so students

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.440
are supposed to go
to this online site

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.765
and then do a lot of practice.

00:01:34.765 --> 00:01:38.500
So conducting drills
sessions entirely in Japanese

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.680
it's quite challenging
for us, but I

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.600
believe that language needs
to be learned together

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.170
with context.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.860
So as a language
teacher, and then

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.440
I believe that other
colleagues do the same thing,

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.750
too, we bring a
lot of visual aids.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.370
so that the classroom becomes
more like a real context,

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.290
and then we try to create
a so-called immersive

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.110
environment in
class, and that way

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.526
we can conduct
interactive drills.
