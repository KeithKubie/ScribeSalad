00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.399
Hi I’m John Green and this is Crash Course
European History.

00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:08.850
So, when we left off last time, the Renaissance
was a very big deal, provided you were part

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.530
of the elite in approximately this part of
the world.

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.390
Today, we’re going to follow the spread
of the Renaissance to France, England, Spain,

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.140
the Low Countries, the seventy two bajillion
ministates of central Europe.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:29.570
Also, suddenly there are a lot more books
to read.

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:36.170
INTRO
The Renaissance was shaped and promoted by

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.670
the discovery in the mid-15th century of moveable
type printing.

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.679
The credit goes mostly to the German goldsmith
and tinkerer Johannes Gutenberg, whose printing

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:51.210
press from the 1440s produced the famous Gutenberg
Bible and fueled the spread of printed books.

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.329
Now, printing techniques, including movable
type, had been used in China for many centuries,

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:00.699
but printing could be quicker in Europe because
the Latin alphabet only contained twenty-six

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:06.110
characters, and also innovations made the
letters easy to eject and reset to form new

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:12.190
words, pamphlets, and newsletters, and then
entire books.

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:14.890
In fact, there are books in the Center of
the World today!

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.050
It’s my favorite center of the world yet!

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.050
I love books.

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.330
It’s really hard to exaggerate just how
big a deal printing was.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.610
Like, before our friend Gutenberg, most books
in Europe were copied from other books by

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:28.610
hand.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.570
This was time-consuming and expensive, and
it introduced errors.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.230
And it also meant that books were not part
of most people’s lives.

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:41.030
Like, if you were among the around 80% of
people in England and France who worked in

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.100
agriculture at the time, it’s not just that
you didn’t need to learn to read to do your

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.660
job; there was generally nothing you could
read.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.850
But printing changed all of that incredibly
quickly.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.460
The first printing press arrived in Venice
in 1469.

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.390
By 1500, there were 417 printing presses in
the city.

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:07.570
In the first fifty years after printing came
to Europe, over 20 million volumes of books

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:08.570
were printed.

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.829
This included the great works from the classical
world that the Renaissance was rediscovering,

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:14.459
but also many legal works.

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:19.340
And as jurists worked to decipher the meaning
of every Latin word of the corpus of Roman

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.060
law, the western legal tradition was born.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.040
More copies of the Bible were available to
read, and argue about.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.379
And new stories and poems could be shared
more widely.

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:35.530
Think of it this way: Whether you were interested
in science or literature or law or mathematics,

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:41.930
printing meant that more people had the opportunity
to encounter far more voices from across time

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:42.930
and space.

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.360
And as Renaissance ideas spread north fueled
in part by printing, it followed that writers

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.989
and scholars would see the ideas of humanism
through the lens of local concerns.

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:58.389
Also, of course, northern European thinkers
downplayed the movement’s Italian origins.

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:02.969
One of the great rules of history is that
whenever Italy has an idea, northern Europe

00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:04.270
will be like, “Yeah, no.

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.040
We totally already had that idea like eight
times.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.129
Our version is so much different and better.

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:16.939
Wait till you see how we do the black death
slash ballet slash fascism slash automatic

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:20.629
weapons slash pizza slash defensive-minded
football.”

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:25.579
Anyway, Pieter Brueghel’s “Dutch Proverbs”
is one example of how different northern Renaissance

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:30.879
art was from its Italian counterparts--Breughel
is still interested in the ideas of humanism

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:36.569
in this painting--it’s secular, focused
on people, set in the natural world--but you

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:41.450
can see that Breughel’s painting of scruffy
rural villagers acting out ridiculous common

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:47.280
wisdom has none of the lyricism or elegance
of, say, Botticelli’s Birth of Venus.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.480
Then again, in many respects, the Northern
renaissance wasn’t so unique--the touchstone

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.749
was still the classical world and its art
and writing.

00:03:55.749 --> 00:03:59.090
Florentines had made much of the Roman legal
tradition that empowered the paterfamilias,

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:04.599
or the male head of the family, and this was
very much embraced in the north as well.

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:10.159
The idea was that all social and political
order stemmed from the exercise of the father’s

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:12.489
authority over the family unit.

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:17.340
From the father’s secure position, the well-being
of the family flowed.

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.210
And more than that, the well-being of the
larger state depended on the good order of

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:27.621
all the families it encompassed, just as the
successes of Rome had rested on familial underpinnings.

00:04:27.621 --> 00:04:34.270
And if humanism was opening the door to rethinking
current values, some sort of anchor was need

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:39.520
to prevent chaos, and people to the north
and south agreed that security was going to

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.759
rest in the classic tradition of the father’s
legal dominance.

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:46.650
In both North and South, humanism also went
radical.

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.430
Some humanists began regularly teaching—not
just discussing—its principles and its main

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.990
subject matter: rhetoric, which may not seem
like a big deal to you, but it means that

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:01.759
at least in the radical fringe of the Renaissance
world, ancient Latin and Greek were being

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:06.720
taught, not just the medieval versions of
those languages--which would eventually contribute

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:12.930
to a rethinking of what certain texts actually
said, perhaps most notably The Bible.

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:18.620
Also, girls sometimes joined their brothers
in being tutored, a radical idea indeed, although

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:23.330
one that could also trace itself back to the
Old Light--in justifying the education of

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:28.330
girls, scholars cited ancient women who’d
received tutoring, including Sappho, Aspasia,

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.220
and Cornelia, the daughter of the Roman general
Scipio.

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:34.970
And as humanism grew, so did the number of
universities.

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:41.300
European universities had long taught a system
of theology and philosophy known as “scholasticism”

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:46.290
that focused on early church teaching and
Aristotelian logic, but now they began to

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:51.479
embrace humanism, spending less time studying
religious texts and more time investigating

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:57.050
the human condition and thinking about how
to organize human societies, including how

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:58.729
to establish and enforce laws.

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:04.259
And amid these developments, Desiderius Erasmus
of Rotterdam, also known as the “Prince

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:08.639
of the Humanists,” became the commanding
figure in the Northern Renaissance.

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:09.980
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:16.199
Erasmus contributed to taking humanism along
its twisted path from ideas of the study of

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:18.909
“humans” and the “active life” into
politics.

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:24.490
In 1595, he went to study at the University
of Paris and began publishing his opinions

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:29.210
on public affairs, including the responsibilities
of a ruler.

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:34.220
A prince, he declared in the Education of
a Christian Prince, needed to study the classics

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:37.250
and the deeds of worthy ancient leaders.

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:42.090
And in these examples he would discover the
means by which great leaders achieved the

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:46.389
public good and keep the peace even in troubled
times.

00:06:46.389 --> 00:06:51.770
he also emphasized the importance of reading
the Bible and the leading Christian authors.

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:56.440
It was for this that he came to be known as
advocating for a “middle road” between

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:00.270
the pagan ancients and the more recent Christian
thinkers.

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:03.699
But he was also at times very critical of
the Catholic Church.

00:07:03.699 --> 00:07:09.180
Erasmus was also a central figure in the rising
“Republic of Letters,” a growing international

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:11.349
community of humanists in Europe.

00:07:11.349 --> 00:07:17.440
In fact, he corresponded with some five hundred
people around Europe, including everyone from

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:22.080
Sir Thomas More to Martin Luther to Pope Leo
X.

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:26.509
Aside from his work on Biblical translations,
he also edited, translated, and published

00:07:26.509 --> 00:07:31.590
ancient pagan texts, like Cicero’s, and
the works of many pivotal religious authors,

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:32.979
especially Saint Jerome.

00:07:32.979 --> 00:07:38.219
He was astonishingly prolific, hiring editors,
proofreaders, and even ghostwriters to help

00:07:38.219 --> 00:07:42.909
him produce mountains of humanistic texts
and fashion himself as the quintessential

00:07:42.909 --> 00:07:47.639
figure of the Northern Renaissance before
dying suddenly of dysentery at the age of

00:07:47.639 --> 00:07:51.249
69 because, you know, it was the sixteenth
century.

00:07:51.249 --> 00:07:52.689
Thanks Thought Bubble.

00:07:52.689 --> 00:07:56.749
Before he died, Erasmus saw the rise of the
Protestant reformation.

00:07:56.749 --> 00:08:01.699
He disagreed with much of Luther’s teachings,
and remained loyal to the Catholic Church,

00:08:01.699 --> 00:08:08.999
but Erasmus’s emphasis on inner spirituality
over ritual did in some ways presage Protestantism.

00:08:08.999 --> 00:08:12.749
Some felt that “Erasmus had laid the egg,
and Luther had hatched it,”

00:08:12.749 --> 00:08:17.409
but Erasmus dismissed that, saying that “Luther
hatched a different bird entirely.”

00:08:17.409 --> 00:08:22.969
Also, for the record neither Erasmus nor Martin
Luther could lay eggs, because they were mammals.

00:08:22.969 --> 00:08:27.440
But now we’re into biology, and getting
a bit ahead of ourselves with the Reformation.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:31.009
Before we start debating how many angels can
fit on the head of a pin, we should acknowledge

00:08:31.009 --> 00:08:36.320
the other great Renaissance thinker who shaped
what we now call political science--Niccolo

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:40.320
Machiavelli, who was like the Erasmus living
in the Upside Down.

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:44.460
Machiavelli had been a faithful supporter
of Florence’s republican traditions.

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:49.920
After the death of Lorenzo Medici in 1492,
Machiavelli served the republic in several

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:50.920
positions.

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:55.950
But after Spanish, papal, and other forces
defeated the republic in 1512, Machiavelli

00:08:55.950 --> 00:09:01.750
was imprisoned and tortured (he was hung by
his wrists until his shoulders were dislocated).

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:06.560
He was eventually released after three weeks
in prison and then set out to write his masterwork

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:11.220
The Prince, which was only published in 1532,
five years after his death.

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:16.779
The Prince was very different from the work
of other humanists, especially from the political

00:09:16.779 --> 00:09:21.040
ideals of Christian humanism found in Erasmus’s
essays and letters.

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:26.010
Machiavelli imagined a grounding in the classics
for an aspiring leader of his day, but he

00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:31.420
believed the attitudes necessary for leaders
were vastly different from what the ancients

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:32.420
had counseled.

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:37.490
His most quoted advice focused on whether
a ruler should aim to be loved or feared:

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:42.750
“One should wish to be both, but, because
it is difficult to unite them in one person,

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:45.529
it is much safer to be feared than loved.”

00:09:45.529 --> 00:09:50.240
Machiavelli took a so-called realist views
of politics--he focused on how a prince could

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:52.990
retain power, and maintain order.

00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:58.630
And he was much more interested in what was
effective than what was, like, noble.

00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:04.950
And unlike many humanists’ focus on maintaining
peace, Machiavelli believed war was necessary--in

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:07.750
fact, he wrote a book about it, called Art
of War.

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:12.670
He argued that rulers needed to prepare for
war by studying great military leaders of

00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:18.290
the past, and he believed that effective military
leadership was vital to effective political

00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:23.480
leadership, because those who win wars get
to gain peace on their terms.

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:28.449
But there were also idealists among Renaissance
humanists, like the Englishman Thomas More,

00:10:28.449 --> 00:10:31.230
who was one of Erasmus’s five billion friends.

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:32.579
And a close one in fact.

00:10:32.579 --> 00:10:37.380
More wrote the classic book Utopia, which
imagines a society without private property,

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:42.710
where reason and cooperation have replaced
struggles for glory and power.

00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:48.250
It’s an odd book--More was a devout Catholic,
and in fact would eventually be executed for

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:54.500
opposing King Henry VIII’s turn toward Protestantism,
and yet the seemingly enlightened Utopia is

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:56.670
very much not Catholic.

00:10:56.670 --> 00:11:01.800
Like, the Utopians have married priests, for
instance, and also they can get divorced.

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:06.000
But regardless, More believed that humanistic
analysis could lead to widespread peace and

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:12.079
prosperity--which by the way I would argue
turned out to be sort of correct, even though

00:11:12.079 --> 00:11:18.360
A. it would take a while for humanism’s
benefits to be felt, and B. More did not get

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:22.770
to enjoy them, on account of being separated
from his head in 1535.

00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:27.649
A century before More’s Utopia, another
book that imagined an ideal citystate, Book

00:11:27.649 --> 00:11:30.391
of the City of Ladies, was written by Christine
de Pizan.

00:11:30.391 --> 00:11:36.050
De Pizan was born in Venice but moved to France
as a kid when her dad got a job as the French

00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:37.450
king’s astrologer.

00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:38.450
As you do.

00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:42.730
She married and had three children, but then
her husband died of the plague, and thereafter

00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:44.540
she earned her living writing.

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:49.079
In Book of the City of Ladies, de Pizan gathered
up all the great and good women of history

00:11:49.079 --> 00:11:52.700
and placed them in a city where the Virgin
Mary is queen.

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:57.920
The book argues that women can be virtuous
leaders, and rational beings, and that leadership

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:04.790
by virtuous women could beget virtuous communities--a
stark contrast to Machiavelli’s worldview.

00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:09.460
So at this point, it’s common at this point
to ask students to think about the relative

00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:16.050
merits of idealism and realism--is a prince
or princess, or for that matter a student

00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:20.320
at a high school, better off being loved or
feared?

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:24.779
Is it more important for a community to be
fair or stable?

00:12:24.779 --> 00:12:29.230
Should leaders prioritize virtue or effectiveness?

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:32.889
These are big, interesting questions, and
I think they’re worth considering.

00:12:32.889 --> 00:12:38.820
But I’d also ask you to look at the lens
through which you’re approaching those questions.

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:43.079
Machiavelli’s life was marked by endless
wars and shifting alliances.

00:12:43.079 --> 00:12:46.709
He saw many short-lived governments fail to
achieve stability.

00:12:46.709 --> 00:12:51.579
Christine de Pizan saw the intense oppression
of women and the dismissal of their talents

00:12:51.579 --> 00:12:52.579
and intellect.

00:12:52.579 --> 00:12:57.029
Erasmus didn’t exactly have an easy life--he
was born out of wedlock and both his parents

00:12:57.029 --> 00:13:02.120
died of plague when he was a teenager--but
he saw a very different world in northern

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:06.930
Europe than Machiavelli saw in Italy, or than
Christine de Pizan saw.

00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:12.290
Where do you sit in the world, and how might
that shape what kind of community you wish

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:16.050
to see?

00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:18.060
Thanks for watching.

00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:42.519
I’ll see you next time.
