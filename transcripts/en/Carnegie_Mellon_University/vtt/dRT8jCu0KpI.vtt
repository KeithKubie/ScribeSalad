[MUSIC]

00:00:25.812 --> 00:00:31.159
The Board of Trustees and the faculty of
Carnegie Mellon University, together with

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:36.653
the staff, students, alumni, and friends
of the university are convened here today,

00:00:36.653 --> 00:00:42.350
October 26, 2018, to celebrate the history
and traditions of our institution

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.662
and to look forward with the inauguration
of the tenth president of

00:00:46.662 --> 00:00:50.205
Carnegie Mellon University, Dr.
Farnam Jahanian.

00:00:50.205 --> 00:00:59.607
[APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Ladies and gentlemen, please rise for

00:00:59.607 --> 00:01:05.275
the National Anthem, sung by alumnus Corey Cott, accompanied by Professor Gary Kline.

00:01:12.019 --> 00:01:22.019
[MUSIC]

00:03:08.181 --> 00:03:18.181
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:23.048 --> 00:03:25.029
&gt;&gt; Wow, that was great.

00:03:25.029 --> 00:03:25.931
Thank you, Corey.

00:03:25.931 --> 00:03:28.152
How about a round of applause for a Tartan.

00:03:28.152 --> 00:03:37.283
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:38.534 --> 00:03:39.472
&gt;&gt; I'm getting a sign.

00:03:39.472 --> 00:03:40.955
Please be seated.

00:03:43.045 --> 00:03:45.464
Good morning and welcome, everyone.

00:03:45.464 --> 00:03:46.561
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:03:46.561 --> 00:03:47.956
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:03:47.956 --> 00:03:52.002
Farnam, I don't know about you, but
it feels good to be here this morning,

00:03:52.002 --> 00:03:52.772
doesn't it?

00:03:52.772 --> 00:03:53.403
How about that.

00:03:53.403 --> 00:03:55.594
A wonderful place to be this morning.

00:03:55.594 --> 00:04:00.249
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Thank you all for

00:04:00.249 --> 00:04:05.184
being part of this wonderous celebration
of a transformative moment in CMU's

00:04:05.184 --> 00:04:07.740
history and pivotal time for humanity.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.190
The digitilization of information and
the democratization of knowledge and

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.210
the unprecedented access to data and

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:20.840
analytics are driving societal
change at a spectacular pace.

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.100
The scope, scale, and
ubiquity of these technologies

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.290
are revolutionizing every
sector of our economy

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.220
including finance,
healthcare, transportation,

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.169
energy, manufacturing,
education, and yes, the arts.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.210
The trail blazing work of our faculty and 
students has position CMU at

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.820
the leading edge of human progress.

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.940
There's never been a more exciting time to
engage in research and work that matters.

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:55.081
The potential for profound impact is
extraordinary and we at CMU have a long

00:04:55.081 --> 00:05:00.495
tradition of excellence in our bold
visual arts, music, and theater programs

00:05:00.495 --> 00:05:02.874
and we continue to define and

00:05:02.874 --> 00:05:08.441
manage the space where our humanity
intersects with technology.

00:05:08.441 --> 00:05:13.100
CMU not only embraces the new
paradigms we define them.

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.392
Our university recruits diverse
perspectives and ideas

00:05:16.392 --> 00:05:20.290
to advance human knowledge and
pursue new modes of human expression.

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:25.600
Here at CMU we dismantle the silos
restricting forward momentum

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.710
and we help people from all
walks of life to succeed.

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:34.500
When we consider ideas from
across the grand spectrum

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.230
in a culture of civil discourse,
we all win.

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:40.870
The things that make our community unique

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:42.850
have never been more
valuable than they are now.

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:47.600
Now the future of education
in the 21st century

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.860
will depend upon breaking
down disciplinary silos.

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:56.410
It will be forged by diverse minds coming
together in learning and research.

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:01.510
As an institution grounded in
relentless creativity and

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:05.230
driven by fearless entrepreneurial spirit,

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:09.340
Carnegie Mellon University knows
how to do this better than anyone.

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:14.809
Education is the key to staying
ahead of the fast moving current.

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:20.010
To make the most of opportunities that
lie ahead, we must be willing to disrupt

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:25.010
the system of higher education itself,
and to do that we need a bold leader.

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:30.500
The single greatest responsibility of
our Board of trustees, thank you so

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:35.519
many of you for being here, is to select
a president who can guide our university.

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:40.190
Dr. Farnam Jahanian is the right
leader at the right time

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:42.320
to guide our great university forward.

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:48.590
A prominent scientist,
creative entrepreneur, public servant and

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:53.100
esteemed educator, Farnam Jahanian
brings the experience, passion, and

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:55.910
leadership necessary to steer CMU.

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:02.190
Each of us has a role in his
success here as we charge in with

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:07.890
the fantastic work of magnifying the
societal impact of scientific discovery

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:11.250
emphasizing our leadership and
creative expression and

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:14.860
building the skills students need for
a lifetime of learning.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.740
I ask all of you, and each of you,

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:23.540
to join me in supporting him, in his
efforts, to meet this strategic vision.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:30.110
Now, it's a great honor for me to
introduce one of our university professors

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:33.135
who are the most, one of our most
senior members of our faculty.

00:07:33.135 --> 00:07:39.341
Dr. Marlene Berman, who is the Thomas
X. Stockton Baker University Professor

00:07:39.341 --> 00:07:41.897
of Cognitive Neuroscience and

00:07:41.897 --> 00:07:46.928
the first CMU woman elected to
the National Academy of Sciences.

00:07:46.928 --> 00:07:47.978
Marlene.

00:07:47.978 --> 00:07:49.501
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Here's Marlene.

00:07:49.501 --> 00:07:52.951
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:07:52.951 --> 00:07:58.284
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:08:02.167 --> 00:08:03.110
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:11.250
It is a true privilege for me to
participate in this investiture ceremony.

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:14.720
I came to CMU in 1993, expecting

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:20.080
that my sojourn in Pittsburgh
would last just a couple of years.

00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:23.441
This year marks my 25th anniversary.

00:08:23.441 --> 00:08:28.357
Even after trying to move to
Toronto to be closer to my

00:08:28.357 --> 00:08:33.499
family in 2006,
CMU exerted its magnetic pull and

00:08:33.499 --> 00:08:37.880
drew our family back
after a brief six months.

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:45.255
I've served under three
previous presidents at CMU

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:49.160
and am delighted to join you
in welcoming the University's

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:53.540
tenth President, Dr. Farnam Jahanian.

00:08:53.540 --> 00:09:02.080
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:07.140
&gt;&gt; I also take much pleasure in welcoming Dr. Jahanian's wife, Tris,

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:11.834
whom I have come to know
over these past few years,

00:09:11.834 --> 00:09:15.937
as well as all the members
of the Jahanian family.

00:09:15.937 --> 00:09:24.357
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:27.000
&gt;&gt; I am truly honored to have been

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.460
chosen as a speaker for
this august ceremony and

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:35.720
am unreservedly supportive of Dr.
Jahanian.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:42.590
I have witnessed him close up in
action over the last four years and

00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:45.851
have observed his gracious behavior,

00:09:45.851 --> 00:09:50.806
even on those occasions when
I've been a thorn in his side.

00:09:53.567 --> 00:09:58.508
Particularly remarkable is that Dr.
Jahanian takes time

00:09:58.508 --> 00:10:03.560
to listen to the multiple
constituencies that make up CMU.

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:10.750
I served as a co-chair of the task force
to enhance the students' experience.

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:18.510
As provost, he not only initiated this
task force, but he remains supportive and

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:24.970
involved in its work even when
he was no longer provost.

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:29.983
Stepping back,
I am struck by how CMU has evolved

00:10:29.983 --> 00:10:34.762
since my first year here way back in 1993.

00:10:34.762 --> 00:10:38.682
It is truly staggering.

00:10:38.682 --> 00:10:43.137
Some of this evolution is
a result of the expansion and

00:10:43.137 --> 00:10:47.295
growth of the physical
setting of the campus and

00:10:47.295 --> 00:10:54.430
the recruitment of outstanding new
faculty, staff and importantly, students.

00:10:56.230 --> 00:11:03.900
But this evolution is reaping the benefits
of hard work done over generations

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:08.380
to build CMU as an educational and
research powerhouse.

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:14.402
And as links in the chain
of this ongoing community,

00:11:14.402 --> 00:11:21.440
we have all forged a common bond
with a perpetual commitment

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:28.080
to improve the students' experience,
to enhance the educational opportunities,

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:33.860
to engage our alumni and
to conduct cutting edge research

00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:39.110
that makes a difference to our society and
our world.

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:44.930
I'd like to share with you a comment
made to me a couple of weeks ago.

00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:49.112
I was having lunch with a junior in
mechanical engineering, Alex Markowitz,

00:11:49.112 --> 00:11:55.680
and in discussing CMU, he said,
it just does not get better than this.

00:11:57.090 --> 00:11:57.910
And he is right.

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:03.320
My personal commitment to
the institution is clear, too.

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:08.950
My husband, David Plaut,
who is also a faculty member here, and

00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:14.470
I, have entrusted CMU with
the education of our own children.

00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:18.340
It just does not get better than this.

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.970
We're a CMU family through and through.

00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:29.260
And so, as we begin this new
chapter in the evolving

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:35.180
book of Carnegie Mellon University,
my colleagues and I dedicate ourselves

00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:40.430
to continue building an institution
of the very highest caliber

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:47.162
with a commitment to an inclusive and
equitable campus for

00:12:47.162 --> 00:12:51.095
all of its members and
with opportunities for

00:12:51.095 --> 00:12:56.286
all to realize their educational and
research potential.

00:12:56.286 --> 00:13:00.198
Dr. Jahanian has clearly expressed his

00:13:00.198 --> 00:13:05.031
commitment to facilitating
these initiatives

00:13:05.031 --> 00:13:09.642
and we are all so
excited to see what comes next.

00:13:09.642 --> 00:13:10.682
Thank you.

00:13:10.682 --> 00:13:20.682
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:26.869
&gt;&gt; Now, I am pleased to welcome to
the podium, Dr. Ramayya Krishnan,

00:13:26.869 --> 00:13:31.979
Dean of the Heinz College of
Information Systems and Public Policy.

00:13:31.979 --> 00:13:41.460
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Marlene.

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:45.671
Good morning, I'm delighted to
introduce our next speaker,

00:13:45.671 --> 00:13:49.405
Keith Block,
is a great friend of mine personally, but

00:13:49.405 --> 00:13:53.630
also a great friend of the university and
of the Heinz College.

00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:58.049
Keith is a distinguished
alumnus of the Heinz College,

00:13:58.049 --> 00:14:04.173
a member of my Deans Advisory Council,
and a member of the Board of Trustees.

00:14:04.173 --> 00:14:10.170
He's also co-CEO of Salesforce and
member of their board of directors.

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:15.758
Keith serves and
has served a number of important roles.

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:19.760
He's served as the company's vice-chairman,
president and

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:24.360
as a director since joining
the company in June 2013

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:29.340
and additionally served as the company's
chief operating officer since

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:34.080
February 2016 - clearly a multidimensional,
multi-talented person.

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:39.560
As President and COO of Salesforce, Keith
oversaw the company's multi-billion dollar

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:45.298
global sales and services business,
alliances and channels, industry strategy,

00:14:45.298 --> 00:14:50.540
corporate development, corporate affairs,
marketing and business operations.

00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:56.560
In February 2018,
Keith and his wife Suzanne

00:14:56.560 --> 00:15:01.640
established the Block Center for
Technology and Society at CMU.

00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:08.560
This important center, which is cross-cutting and university-wide will foster

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:14.200
critical dialog on campus to create
inclusive and meaningful plans

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:19.870
of action on topics, such as a future to
work and issues of trust and transparency

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:23.719
in the use of autonomous systems to
improve the quality of life for all.

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:28.550
Keith holds a Master of Science
Degree in Management and

00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:31.230
Policy Analysis from the Heinz College and

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:36.570
a Bachelor Degree in Information
Systems from Dietrich College.

00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:40.570
So he was ahead even then at being at
this nexus of technology in society.

00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:46.630
In addition to his membership on
the Carnegie Mellon University Board of

00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:50.850
Trustees, he's also currently a member of

00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:55.320
the World Economic Forum's Information
Technology Community as a governor and

00:15:55.320 --> 00:16:01.564
on the advisory board of
our Heinz College and

00:16:01.564 --> 00:16:05.180
its Board of Trustees
of the Concord Museum.

00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:08.088
Please join me in welcoming
Keith Block to the podium.

00:16:08.088 --> 00:16:08.834
Keith.

00:16:08.834 --> 00:16:17.670
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:18.940
&gt;&gt; Well, thank you, Krishnan.

00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:23.264
You've made me blush this morning,
so I appreciate that

00:16:23.264 --> 00:16:27.260
and thank you very much for
that very kind introduction.

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:31.234
So first, I want to say, good morning
everybody.

00:16:31.234 --> 00:16:32.290
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:33.990
&gt;&gt; Okay, that was my best Farnam.

00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:38.100
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; I gave it a run, my friend.

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:41.238
Anyway, good morning to everybody,
faculty,

00:16:41.238 --> 00:16:45.960
alumni, staff, family and friends.

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:50.698
It is an honor to be here today to
celebrate the investiture of a great man,

00:16:50.698 --> 00:16:54.580
Dr. Farnam Jahanian, as president
of Carnegie Mellon University.

00:16:56.730 --> 00:17:01.070
In all of life's endeavors, Farnam
has led with a tremendous spirit and

00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:02.170
an unrivaled dedication.

00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:07.507
Whether as a world-renowned
computer scientist, a passionate,

00:17:07.507 --> 00:17:11.295
successful entrepreneur,
a tireless public servant or

00:17:11.295 --> 00:17:15.060
a world-class leader in higher education.

00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:18.310
And, oh by the way, just an incredible,
incredible human being.

00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:23.260
Now, I've had the opportunity to
work very closely with Farnam.

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:28.310
and we have shared many
experiences around career and

00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:33.000
our life journeys, including
everybody's favorite, parenthood.

00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:38.051
And Farnam, by the way, that advice you
gave me about curfews for teenage kids,

00:17:38.051 --> 00:17:39.271
thank you so much for that.

00:17:39.271 --> 00:17:40.333
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; I would never

00:17:40.333 --> 00:17:41.794
I would never have thought of that myself.

00:17:41.794 --> 00:17:45.030
&gt;&gt; [COUGH] But thank goodness it worked.

00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:48.110
Over the years, we've had a very,
very close relationship and friendship

00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:50.458
and for that I'm very, very grateful.

00:17:50.458 --> 00:17:53.934
Professionally, I've also had
the opportunity to observe Farnam in his

00:17:53.934 --> 00:17:56.730
influence in guiding policy
at the World Economic Forum.

00:17:56.730 --> 00:17:58.140
And I will tell all of you,

00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:00.720
he has represented this
university incredibly well.

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:06.730
I've also witnessed his leadership here
at CMU personally, with students and

00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:10.530
faculty and staff, and
members of the Board of Trustees

00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:15.306
and whether it's uniting the community
to support the Special Olympics,

00:18:15.306 --> 00:18:18.509
where I understand he as a passion for
dunk tanks -

00:18:18.509 --> 00:18:20.130
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Do you just wanna come up and

00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:22.060
tell everybody about this dunk tank?

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:23.599
All right,
I'm sure you'll get to that at some point.

00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:28.390
- or really fostering engagement between
students from different colleges, Farnam

00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:32.080
has a talent, a true talent for bringing
people together and breaking down walls.

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:38.230
Farnam is also a leader with impeccable
integrity and the highest of character.

00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:44.330
He conducts himself with grace, and
dignity, and thoughtfulness, and warmth.

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:47.000
There is no question,
no question Farnam will guide this

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.920
institution into the future and
accelerate its impact on the world.

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:51.852
So today,

00:18:51.852 --> 00:18:57.122
we witness the passing of the torch
to an incredibly talented individual.

00:18:57.122 --> 00:18:58.728
Now, this torch has been held by many,

00:18:58.728 --> 00:19:02.420
many great leaders throughout
Carnegie Mellon's very rich history

00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:04.780
and there have been so
many accomplishments and so

00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:05.880
many historic milestones.

00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:11.150
Since Andrew Carnegie founded
a technical school in 1900,

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:12.790
individuals of great character and

00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:18.430
honor have taken the reigns of leadership
of this very prestigious institution

00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:22.888
and each of them have led with courage and vision.

00:19:22.888 --> 00:19:28.283
Names like Hamerschlag, Doherty, Stever,

00:19:28.283 --> 00:19:32.580
Cyert, Cohon, those are but a few.

00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:38.290
Each of these presidents and others of
this storied institution led through

00:19:38.290 --> 00:19:43.110
myriad chapters of American history,
world history, the turn of the century,

00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:47.080
the Great Depression, the explosion of
technology that Jim was talking about just

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:53.450
a few minutes ago,
civil unrest, war and peace.

00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:56.970
And throughout all of this,
presidents of Carnegie Mellon

00:19:56.970 --> 00:20:00.900
have guided this institution to
the forefront of educational excellence

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:04.710
and they have shaped the minds of so
many young people.

00:20:06.250 --> 00:20:11.110
All the while ensuring that the university
remained a source of inspiration,

00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:14.100
a guiding light, a beacon of hope.

00:20:15.170 --> 00:20:18.940
And now we pass this
torch to Farnam Jahanian.

00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:24.070
There is no one who is better suited
to lead us into the next chapter

00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:26.590
and this next chapter is
arguably the most important ever.

00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:30.208
For we do live in very,
very interesting times.

00:20:30.208 --> 00:20:33.750
We have seen, and
this is just the beginning,

00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:36.770
but we have seen incredible
advances in technology.

00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:38.690
We are at the dawn of a new era.

00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:40.820
Some refer to it as
the Fourth Industrial Revolution.

00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:46.630
And this is where we have the convergence,
the perfect storm of social, and mobile,

00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:49.754
and deep learning, and artificial
intelligence, and 3D printing, and

00:20:49.754 --> 00:20:54.640
amazing technologies all brought
together to drive incredible innovation.

00:20:56.010 --> 00:20:59.330
Now, like many of you,
I have the opportunity and

00:20:59.330 --> 00:21:02.170
good fortune to speak with other CEOs and
world leaders.

00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:04.970
And what is top of mind in that group

00:21:06.170 --> 00:21:09.790
is how to harness this wave of
innovation in a very positive way.

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:14.970
This convergence of technology is
having a profound impact on our world.

00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:16.379
We see it in our daily lives.

00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:21.900
It has also brought great disruption and
given rise to many, many questions.

00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:25.350
What will these new technologies be?

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:27.700
Will they be positive for mankind?

00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:30.130
What are the socioeconomic effects?

00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:32.347
What are the privacy implications?

00:21:32.347 --> 00:21:34.679
What will be the regulatory issues?

00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:36.320
What will be the future of work?

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:42.200
And Farnam is passionate about these
questions and even more passionate

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:47.040
about CMU leading the way to drive
those answers to these questions.

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:52.020
These are all important issues of our time
that we have to consider in a thoughtful,

00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:53.400
and meaningful, and measured way.

00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:56.780
We are clearly at an inflection point.

00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:01.610
These advances must be for good.

00:22:01.610 --> 00:22:03.690
They must enlighten, they must empower,

00:22:03.690 --> 00:22:06.200
and they must take humanity
to greater heights

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:10.230
and in a world where there is
an ever increasing divide,

00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:15.118
these advances must create opportunity for
all, not just a few, so

00:22:15.118 --> 00:22:19.009
that all of mankind can participate and
contribute.

00:22:19.009 --> 00:22:20.403
Now, this will take vigilance.

00:22:20.403 --> 00:22:23.840
It will take dedication and
it will take leadership.

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:26.410
And this is why the faculty,
the staff, the students,

00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:30.376
this community at Carnegie Mellon are so
critical to the future of this nation,

00:22:30.376 --> 00:22:35.140
this society, this world.

00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:38.620
For the young minds that we shape
here have an important mission.

00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:40.910
They will go forth into the world
with the knowledge, the vision, and

00:22:40.910 --> 00:22:43.390
the ethics that Carnegie Mellon
has instilled in them.

00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:46.710
And they will go forward into the world

00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:51.720
to solve universal issues that lie at the
intersection of technology and humanity.

00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:57.040
The graduates of CMU must be equipped to
thrive and lead in a world of uncertainty.

00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:59.110
For these are truly uncertain times.

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:03.830
Today, the value of trust is
being questioned more than ever.

00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:09.940
Trust in technology, trust in our
institutions, trust in our leaders.

00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:11.814
Some would say there is a crisis of trust

00:23:13.737 --> 00:23:16.599
and this crisis of trust has
created a leadership void.

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:20.675
And now individuals, and
companies, and faculty, and

00:23:20.675 --> 00:23:22.797
students alike must fill this breach

00:23:22.797 --> 00:23:26.330
and it will be the graduates of CMU that
will answer this call for leadership

00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:28.100
and for them, it is a call to arms.

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:30.060
It is a call to arms for us all.

00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:33.480
It is an obligation to
lead in an ethical and

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:39.120
transparent way,
to engage in constructive civil discourse,

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:42.920
where disagreements will arise
and that's okay, but

00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:45.330
dialogue must happen with respect,

00:23:45.330 --> 00:23:48.520
and while there can be differing opinions,
there cannot be differing facts,

00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:53.160
and, most important, most important,

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:57.080
to restore trust in our society,
because without trust, we have nothing.

00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:01.500
It will be the graduates of Carnegie
Mellon that will be called upon to

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:04.950
cultivate and drive a culture of
success in business and society,

00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:09.936
where the core tenants of diversity, empathy, equality, humanity,

00:24:09.936 --> 00:24:14.900
accountability, and opportunity for
all are at the forefront.

00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:20.600
Never before has this institution
been more important to the world.

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:24.480
Never before has leadership at the
intersection of technology, and society

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:27.440
and humanity been as
critical as it is right now.

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:32.390
And though the future is unwritten I
am very confident, very confident that

00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:35.350
the graduates at CMU will be the authors
of a great future for all of us.

00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:40.190
Now, as we stand at
the doorstep of this new world,

00:24:40.190 --> 00:24:44.100
the dawn of a new era,
we need a truly special leader.

00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:44.720
To help guide and

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:48.900
shape the lives of those who will
determine the future, all of our futures

00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:51.830
and never before has a presidency
of this institution been

00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:53.240
as important as it is right now

00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:58.940
and it requires a remarkable leader,
a truly outstanding human being, and

00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:01.790
that person is Dr. Farnam Jahanian.

00:25:01.790 --> 00:25:03.110
We stand with Farnam today,

00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:06.770
as he takes his rightful place amongst
the great presidents of Carnegie Mellon.

00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:12.950
I cannot imagine a better leader
who embodies the values of CMU.

00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:18.628
I cannot imagine a better leader with
as much vision, with as much passion,

00:25:18.628 --> 00:25:19.630
with as much focus

00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:22.940
and I cannot imagine a better leader and
torch-bearer of this great institution.

00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:27.640
Farnam, we are very lucky to have you.

00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:30.159
You are the right leader,
as Jim says, at the right time.

00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:35.130
So ladies and gentlemen, please join me
in congratulating a true friend, a great

00:25:35.130 --> 00:25:40.970
leader, and the next President of Carnegie
Mellon University, Dr. Farnam Jahanian.

00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:49.651
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Ladies and

00:25:49.651 --> 00:25:54.147
gentleman, please welcome Professor
Gary Kline, and alumna, Tamara Tunie

00:25:54.147 --> 00:25:58.955
accompanied by the School of Drama choir
performing, "How Can I Keep from Singing".

00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:08.960
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:26:12.800 --> 00:30:13.440
[MUSIC]

00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:36.000
&gt;&gt;[APPLAUSE]

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:47.920
[MUSIC]

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:57.680
&gt;&gt;Wow. That is a miracle. Tamara, thank you so much.

00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:01.970
That was just - the choir is absolutely spectacular.

00:31:01.970 --> 00:31:03.360
Thank you, thank you.

00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:04.902
Another round of applause.

00:31:04.902 --> 00:31:14.770
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:31:14.770 --> 00:31:16.290
&gt;&gt; Gary Kline. Gary Kline,

00:31:16.290 --> 00:31:17.300
thank you so much.

00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:20.900
I mean, when someone shows up with a mace,

00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:24.705
it takes the fun out of the meeting,
usually.

00:31:24.705 --> 00:31:27.270
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:31:27.270 --> 00:31:30.310
&gt;&gt; But I have to say that it's just a,
that is just wonderful.

00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:31.530
Thank you, thank you so much.

00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:37.048
At this time, I would like to welcome
to the stage, Dr. Rebecca Doerge.

00:31:37.048 --> 00:31:40.072
The Glen de Vries Dean of the Mellon,
College of Science.

00:31:40.072 --> 00:31:44.234
Ladies and gentlemen, Dean Rebecca Doerge.

00:31:44.234 --> 00:31:49.854
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:31:55.189 --> 00:31:55.930
&gt;&gt; Thank you Jim.

00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:00.455
It is my pleasure to
introduce Martha Pollack.

00:32:00.455 --> 00:32:04.730
Dr. Pollack is the 14th
president of Cornell University.

00:32:06.010 --> 00:32:09.263
As faculty at the University of Michigan,
Dr. Pollack and

00:32:09.263 --> 00:32:12.160
Dr Jahanian forged a strong friendship.

00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:15.090
I'm pretty sure that neither of them
imagined that they would be here today as

00:32:15.090 --> 00:32:18.120
president of two of the best
universities in the United States.

00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:22.920
[LAUGH] Their presidencies come at
an important time in history, when we're

00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:26.689
presented with new opportunities and
challenges on a daily basis.

00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:31.420
Technology is moving
forward at an amazing pace.

00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:35.820
It's impacting all areas of research,
transforming how we teach and

00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:38.480
blending the lines between disciplines.

00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:43.238
Doctors Jahanian and Pollack are the right
time of leader at the right time, bold,

00:32:43.238 --> 00:32:46.400
innovative, forward thinking.

00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:50.690
We need to make our institutions
a transformational part of this time.

00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:55.180
Since becoming the President of
Cornell University about a year and

00:32:55.180 --> 00:32:59.920
a half ago, Dr. Pollack has demonstrated
a strong commitment to sustaining and

00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:05.070
enhancing Cornell's academic distinction
while enhancing equality, diversity

00:33:05.070 --> 00:33:07.108
and inclusivity.

00:33:07.108 --> 00:33:10.838
She has supported the university's
expansion into New York City,

00:33:10.838 --> 00:33:15.234
where it has programs that range from
architecture to technology to medicine.

00:33:17.095 --> 00:33:20.783
Dr. Pollack came to Cornell University
from the University of Michigan,

00:33:20.783 --> 00:33:25.270
where she was Provost and Executive
Vice President for Academic Affairs.

00:33:25.270 --> 00:33:30.944
Before her tenure at Michigan, she served
on the University of Pittsburgh's faculty,

00:33:30.944 --> 00:33:32.996
so welcome back to Pittsburgh.

00:33:37.583 --> 00:33:41.483
Dr. Pollack is renowned for
her contributions in computer science and

00:33:41.483 --> 00:33:43.600
artificial intelligence.

00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:47.930
Her research focuses on automated
planning, temporal reasoning, and

00:33:47.930 --> 00:33:50.020
constraint satisfaction.

00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:54.000
She has designed intelligent technology to
assist people with cognitive impairments

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:54.995
and their caregivers.

00:33:54.995 --> 00:33:59.440
Dr. Pollack has also served as
president of the Association for

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:01.850
the Advancement of
Artificial intelligence

00:34:01.850 --> 00:34:04.220
and was a member of
the advisory committee for

00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:06.930
the National Science
Foundation's Computers and

00:34:06.930 --> 00:34:09.710
Information Science Engineering Division

00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:13.960
and a member of the Board of Directors
of the Computing Research Association.

00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:18.525
Please join me in welcoming
Dr Martha Pollack.

00:34:18.525 --> 00:34:28.387
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Rebecca.

00:34:28.387 --> 00:34:30.910
Good morning to all of you.

00:34:30.910 --> 00:34:35.530
I'm truly honored to be here today for the
inauguration of my colleague and friend,

00:34:35.530 --> 00:34:39.500
Farnam Jahanian, as the tenth president
of Carnegie Mellon University.

00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:43.450
Most of you probably don't know this,
but there's an historical

00:34:43.450 --> 00:34:47.560
connection between Carnegie Mellon and
my own university, Cornell.

00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:53.810
Andrew Carnegie was one of Cornell's first
trustees, elected to that role in 1890.

00:34:53.810 --> 00:34:59.350
Later, honoring his passion for music,
Carnegie donated to Cornell a magnificent

00:34:59.350 --> 00:35:04.090
organ to celebrate the 80th birthday of
our first president, Andrew Dixon White.

00:35:05.095 --> 00:35:08.710
Alas, the organ suffered a ignoble fate.

00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:13.720
It's air intake, for some inexplicable
reason, was located in the men's bathroom,

00:35:15.730 --> 00:35:21.300
and in 1935 there was a plumbing failure
that filled that room with water.

00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:25.340
Unaware of this, the university
organist sat down at the instrument and

00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:29.553
according to historical account,
blew a mighty crescendo,

00:35:29.553 --> 00:35:33.285
which filled the leather organ
pouches with water, ruining them.

00:35:33.285 --> 00:35:36.590
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Perhaps we're doing better off with

00:35:36.590 --> 00:35:37.805
a gift of bag pipes.

00:35:37.805 --> 00:35:40.430
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Now,

00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:43.070
there is also a long time
connection between Farnam and me,

00:35:43.070 --> 00:35:46.460
although of course not as long
as between our universities.

00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:50.880
As Rebecca said, Farnam and I met about
20 years ago when we were both faculty

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:55.130
members in computer science and
engineering at the University of Michigan.

00:35:55.130 --> 00:35:59.450
I later became Chair of CSE and
Farnam succeeded me in that role.

00:35:59.450 --> 00:36:02.420
Later, he became provost
here at Carnegie Mellon,

00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:05.540
a few years after I had
become provost at Michigan.

00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:07.830
And he started as interim president here,

00:36:07.830 --> 00:36:11.118
just a couple of months after
I became Cornell's president.

00:36:11.118 --> 00:36:19.365
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:36:19.365 --> 00:36:22.090
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:36:22.090 --> 00:36:25.930
&gt;&gt; But I'm gonna take that couple of
month's head start seriously, and

00:36:25.930 --> 00:36:29.885
imagine that he gives me the right to
offer him some advice on leadership.

00:36:29.885 --> 00:36:34.960
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Specifically, I'd like to quote Hopper,

00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:40.390
the grasshopper in the animated movie,
A Bug's Life, who said this. [I] quote,

00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:43.892
"the first rule of leadership,
everything is your fault."

00:36:43.892 --> 00:36:46.928
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; I hate to tell you this Farnham,

00:36:46.928 --> 00:36:50.560
but Hopper's right, especially when
you're the president of a university.

00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:55.230
But really, having everything be
your fault is a fair trade off for

00:36:55.230 --> 00:36:58.960
all that is wonderful about
being a university president.

00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:03.805
It is, as I know Farnham appreciates,
a huge privilege to lead a university,

00:37:03.805 --> 00:37:07.130
especially a great one
like Carnegie Mellon.

00:37:07.130 --> 00:37:11.416
Universities are institutions that
are second to none in changing lives.

00:37:11.416 --> 00:37:13.938
We change the lives of our students.

00:37:13.938 --> 00:37:18.830
We change the lives of the communities
into which our students graduate

00:37:18.830 --> 00:37:23.140
and we changed the lives of all those
who are touched by the research and

00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:25.800
the scholarship of our faculty.

00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:30.770
Farnam, I can assure you is the perfect
choice to lead Carnegie Mellon and

00:37:30.770 --> 00:37:34.890
to ensure that it continues it's
proud tradition of changing lives for

00:37:34.890 --> 00:37:36.290
the better.

00:37:36.290 --> 00:37:40.510
He has a range of experience that's
an extraordinary fit for this university.

00:37:40.510 --> 00:37:44.810
Experience in academia, where he's
been a talented and dedicated teacher,

00:37:44.810 --> 00:37:49.100
as well as a renowned researcher who
discoveries have had broad impact.

00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:53.455
Experience in industry where he founded
a very successful network security

00:37:53.455 --> 00:37:55.200
start-up company.

00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:56.740
And experience in government,

00:37:56.740 --> 00:38:00.190
where he served in major roles at
the National Science Foundation,

00:38:00.190 --> 00:38:02.490
the National Research
Council's Computer Science and

00:38:02.490 --> 00:38:05.550
Telecommunications board, and more.

00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:06.610
But beyond all that,

00:38:06.610 --> 00:38:11.580
what I want you to know, is that Farnham
also has a set of personal characteristics

00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:15.840
that are in complete alignment
with Carnegie Mellon's culture.

00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:18.500
He is a person of high
integrity who values and

00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:22.850
exhibits creativity,
innovation and entrepreneurship.

00:38:22.850 --> 00:38:25.720
He values and promotes mentorship and
the development of

00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:30.570
leadership skills as essential to
preparing students for today's world.

00:38:30.570 --> 00:38:33.675
He appreciates the importance of
university supporting a breath of

00:38:33.675 --> 00:38:34.931
intellectual inquiry,

00:38:34.931 --> 00:38:37.511
but he also has a particular passion for

00:38:37.511 --> 00:38:42.865
translational research that produces
results that directly benefit society.

00:38:42.865 --> 00:38:46.380
He's focused on the ways
in which technology can enhance

00:38:46.380 --> 00:38:51.089
all aspects of the university from
teaching to research, to operations.

00:38:52.130 --> 00:38:56.010
A few years ago when Alan G. Merten
retired from the presidency of

00:38:56.010 --> 00:38:59.050
George Mason University he said this.

00:38:59.050 --> 00:39:02.280
[I] quote, "do I like being
a university president?"

00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:03.430
I don't know.

00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:07.750
But I do know that I have loved being
George Mason University's President.

00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:10.000
Some of my friends
are university presidents.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:13.750
I wouldn't wanna be where they are and
they probably wouldn't wanna be here.

00:39:13.750 --> 00:39:18.110
These jobs can look a lot alike,
but they are not." End quote.

00:39:18.110 --> 00:39:22.378
Search committees look for university
Presidents who fit their university.

00:39:22.378 --> 00:39:26.250
And I can't imagine Carnegie Mellon
finding someone who fits better

00:39:26.250 --> 00:39:27.530
than Farnam.

00:39:27.530 --> 00:39:32.040
He will be a brilliant and inspired
leader for this wonderful university.

00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:35.065
And who knows,
he may even learn to play the bagpipes.

00:39:35.065 --> 00:39:38.769
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:39:52.484 --> 00:39:54.354
&gt;&gt; Thank you, President Pollock for

00:39:54.354 --> 00:39:56.840
your thoughtful and inspiring words.

00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:58.885
We appreciate your presence with us here today.

00:39:58.885 --> 00:40:03.355
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:40:06.487 --> 00:40:08.228
&gt;&gt; My name is Jeanne VanBriesen and

00:40:08.228 --> 00:40:12.803
the Chair of the Faculty Organization and
Educame, like company Professor of Civil

00:40:12.803 --> 00:40:16.490
and Environmental Engineering and
Engineering in Public Policy.

00:40:17.630 --> 00:40:22.670
I'm joined by Jessica Owens,
the Chair of Staff Council and

00:40:22.670 --> 00:40:25.880
the Program Coordinator for
Supplemental Instruction,

00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:29.215
an Excel Collaborative
Learning Group program.

00:40:29.215 --> 00:40:32.850
Roshni Mehta,
the President of the Student Body and

00:40:32.850 --> 00:40:37.280
a junior in economics in
Dietrich College and the Tepper school

00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:41.680
and Alex DiClaudio,
the President of the Alumni Association Board,

00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:46.730
an alumnus of Heinz and Dietrich Colleges
and the Tepper School of Business.

00:40:46.730 --> 00:40:48.720
He also serves on our Board of Trustees.

00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:54.260
Prominent within our university
seal is the thistle.

00:40:54.260 --> 00:40:57.970
For more than five centuries,
the thistle has stood as the national

00:40:57.970 --> 00:41:03.170
emblem of Scotland, the birthplace
of our founder, Andrew Carnegie.

00:41:03.170 --> 00:41:08.140
Among the oldest still celebrated
national emblems in the world, the thistle

00:41:08.140 --> 00:41:13.460
represents one of the highest honors an
individual can receive from the community.

00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:14.600
Among the Scots,

00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:18.890
it is bestowed only on those who have
made an outstanding contribution in life.

00:41:20.050 --> 00:41:22.248
It is our distinct honor to present Dr.

00:41:22.248 --> 00:41:25.860
Jahanian with an specially
commissioned sculpture of a thistle.

00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:30.630
On behalf of the Carnegie Mellon
University community.  This token is meant

00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:35.630
to serve as a reminder of the attributes
within the CMU community that thistles

00:41:35.630 --> 00:41:42.690
are said to embody- strength,
bravery, determination, and devotion.

00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:46.590
The first characteristic is strength.

00:41:46.590 --> 00:41:49.060
Our strength is in the work we do and

00:41:49.060 --> 00:41:54.220
in our approach to it that is
equal parts fearless and curious.

00:41:54.220 --> 00:41:57.920
This strength lives in our students,
our faculty,

00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:03.490
our staff, our alumni, our leadership
and our board of trustees.

00:42:03.490 --> 00:42:06.238
All of our hearts are in the work.

00:42:16.498 --> 00:42:20.950
&gt;&gt; The second characteristic is bravery,
we've got it.

00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:25.690
The people who are drawn the Carnegie
Mellon view challenges not as obstacles

00:42:25.690 --> 00:42:27.770
but as opportunities.

00:42:27.770 --> 00:42:33.444
We inspire each other to dig in,
dive deeper, peel back the extra layer,

00:42:33.444 --> 00:42:38.856
continually in search of breakthroughs
that will make a difference.

00:42:46.407 --> 00:42:48.510
&gt;&gt; The next characteristic
is determination.

00:42:50.020 --> 00:42:53.610
We are determined to solve the most
difficult questions posed by society.

00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:59.640
In order to do so we use self motivation,
discipline, and multiple

00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:04.379
opportunities to explore potential
solutions that no one has posed yet.

00:43:13.938 --> 00:43:16.600
&gt;&gt; The final characteristic is devotion.

00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:18.620
We are devoted to Carnegie Mellon.

00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:22.350
We're devoted to its experimentation,
its rigour and

00:43:22.350 --> 00:43:27.100
research with the human dimension
of purpose and tangible impact.

00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:31.534
That impact is felt on campus in
Pittsburgh, throughout the nation and

00:43:31.534 --> 00:43:32.789
across the globe.

00:43:38.698 --> 00:43:41.165
&gt;&gt; President Jahanian,
can you please join us?

00:43:43.930 --> 00:43:48.154
We hope this sculpture reminds you of
these characteristics interwoven in

00:43:48.154 --> 00:43:50.576
the CMU community, and your leadership.

00:43:50.576 --> 00:43:56.278
May it inspire you everyday, let it
forever commemorate and symbolize this

00:43:56.278 --> 00:44:02.083
day as we move forward into the future
we are committed to creating together.

00:44:02.083 --> 00:44:12.083
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:42.925
&gt;&gt; What a beautiful representation
of all that is Carnegie Mellon.

00:44:42.925 --> 00:44:46.090
Thank you so much for
sharing this beautiful community gift

00:44:46.090 --> 00:44:48.260
on behalf of everyone at CMU, thank you.

00:44:50.710 --> 00:44:54.640
The investiture of a president
is held as an academic ceremony

00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:56.500
much like commencement and,

00:44:56.500 --> 00:45:02.180
like graduation, it symbolizes an important
transition, a right of passage.

00:45:02.180 --> 00:45:05.310
Today's ceremony is a right
of passage not only for Dr.

00:45:05.310 --> 00:45:07.900
Jahanian, but also for Carnegie Mellon.

00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:14.010
New leadership can inspire new thinking,
new directions and new aspirations

00:45:14.010 --> 00:45:17.898
and I'm confident that under Dr.
Jahanian presidency,

00:45:17.898 --> 00:45:22.910
university will take on a fresh group
of challenges and ask new questions.

00:45:24.110 --> 00:45:28.651
Dr. Jahanian and Faculty Marshals,
will you please come forward to join me?

00:45:46.505 --> 00:45:50.269
Farnam Jahanian, by the authority
of the Board of Trustees and

00:45:50.269 --> 00:45:54.993
with the enthusiastic approval of
the faculty, staff, students, alumni, and

00:45:54.993 --> 00:45:56.842
this distinguished assembly,

00:45:56.842 --> 00:46:01.032
I present into your keeping the charter
of Carnegie Mellon university.

00:46:03.034 --> 00:46:13.034
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:46:14.318 --> 00:46:19.073
&gt;&gt; And I also present to you the great
seal of the university, the symbol of

00:46:19.073 --> 00:46:23.751
the high office you now hold, and
invest you with all of the rights,

00:46:23.751 --> 00:46:28.368
privileges, and responsibilities
of the Office of the President.

00:46:28.368 --> 00:46:37.096
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:46:39.841 --> 00:46:49.841
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:04.187 --> 00:47:05.627
&gt;&gt; Ladies and gentlemen,

00:47:05.627 --> 00:47:10.379
on behalf of the board of trustees and
the members of the academy, I now present

00:47:10.379 --> 00:47:15.214
you with the 10th president of
Carnegie University, Dr. Farnam Jahanian.

00:47:15.214 --> 00:47:35.360
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:37.120
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:41.360
&gt;&gt;[APPLAUSE]

00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:43.360
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:45.920
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:54.880
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:47:56.560 --> 00:48:01.012
&gt;&gt; Wow, Chairman Rohr,

00:48:01.012 --> 00:48:06.167
trustees, faculty colleagues,

00:48:06.167 --> 00:48:10.591
students, staff, alumni, and

00:48:10.591 --> 00:48:16.761
honored guests,
good morning and thank you.

00:48:20.283 --> 00:48:25.314
It's a great honor and
a truly humbling experience to stand

00:48:25.314 --> 00:48:30.460
here as the tenth president of
Carnegie Mellon University.

00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:37.360
I hereby accept the symbols,
the Office of the President, and

00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:42.520
all of the responsibility
pertaining thereto.

00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:53.060
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:48:53.060 --> 00:48:55.978
&gt;&gt; It brings me great joy to celebrate

00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:58.800
this occasion with my family,
especially my wife,

00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:05.175
Tris and my children,
Daniel, Thomas, and Sarah.

00:49:05.175 --> 00:49:10.690
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Who

00:49:10.690 --> 00:49:13.700
have always been my greatest blessing.

00:49:15.530 --> 00:49:20.808
I am so touched by the presence of
friends, former students, colleagues

00:49:20.808 --> 00:49:26.015
and collaborators, who have traveled
from across the country to be here.

00:49:26.015 --> 00:49:30.116
I also wanna acknowledge
community partners and

00:49:30.116 --> 00:49:33.817
civic leaders from the Pittsburgh region,

00:49:33.817 --> 00:49:39.838
who are showing their support for
this university today and every day

00:49:39.838 --> 00:49:44.523
and I would especially like
to thank my dear friends,

00:49:44.523 --> 00:49:49.417
Marlene Behrmann, Keith Block,
and Martha Pollack,

00:49:49.417 --> 00:49:53.910
for their kind and
thoughtful words this morning.

00:49:55.670 --> 00:49:58.555
Martha, I've been
following your footsteps.

00:49:58.555 --> 00:50:02.550
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; What you didn't tell them is that you

00:50:02.550 --> 00:50:07.879
were my department head and my provost,
my boss for many, many years.

00:50:07.879 --> 00:50:09.430
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; I

00:50:09.430 --> 00:50:10.990
don't know what you're
planning to do next.

00:50:10.990 --> 00:50:14.042
I'm pretty happy to be here,
so don't do anything else.

00:50:14.042 --> 00:50:18.314
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:50:18.314 --> 00:50:25.175
&gt;&gt;[APPLAUSE]

00:50:25.175 --> 00:50:28.753
&gt;&gt; Today's ceremony is a celebration

00:50:28.753 --> 00:50:34.835
steeped in tradition,
the singing of our national anthem,

00:50:34.835 --> 00:50:40.335
our academic regalia,
the iconic sound of bagpipes.

00:50:42.485 --> 00:50:45.691
These rituals remind us that this moment

00:50:45.691 --> 00:50:50.440
iss not about the beginning
of my journey as President.

00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:55.535
Rather, this ceremony celebrates
our storied history as a community

00:50:55.535 --> 00:50:59.865
of scholars in a nation driven
by learning and discovery.

00:50:59.865 --> 00:51:04.880
CMU is, relatively, a young university.

00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:10.260
We've come so far in such a short time,
and our accomplishments

00:51:10.260 --> 00:51:14.899
would have not been possible without
the leadership of my predecessors.

00:51:16.540 --> 00:51:19.620
I especially want to acknowledge and

00:51:19.620 --> 00:51:24.465
thank President Emeritus Jerry Cohon

00:51:24.465 --> 00:51:32.232
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt;aAnd past Provost Mark Kamlet

00:51:32.232 --> 00:51:37.150
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; for their

00:51:37.150 --> 00:51:41.963
enduring commitment

00:51:41.963 --> 00:51:47.100
to this university.

00:51:47.100 --> 00:51:50.820
We are so grateful to you for
everything you have done for

00:51:50.820 --> 00:51:52.495
Carnegie Mellon, Mark and Jerry.

00:51:52.495 --> 00:51:59.960
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Of course,

00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:03.760
great leaders are inspired by
an extraordinary community.

00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:07.780
As Mark and Jerry can attest,
countless faculty, staff, alumni

00:52:07.780 --> 00:52:12.770
and partners help to build the foundation
of excellence CMU enjoys today.

00:52:14.070 --> 00:52:17.911
I am grateful to all the men and
women who have guided this

00:52:17.911 --> 00:52:22.430
university since its founding,
and who will secure its future.

00:52:23.730 --> 00:52:27.295
In particular,
I wish to recognize the members of

00:52:27.295 --> 00:52:32.140
Carnegie Mellon's Board of Trustees,
who are the stewards of this institution.

00:52:32.140 --> 00:52:37.140
I am so grateful for
their trust they have placed in me.

00:52:37.140 --> 00:52:41.655
Trustees, would you please stand to be
recognized, Carnegie Mellon trustees.

00:52:41.655 --> 00:52:51.766
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:52:51.766 --> 00:52:52.410
&gt;&gt; Thank you, please be seated.

00:52:52.410 --> 00:52:58.242
I would also like to acknowledge and
thank the university deans,

00:52:58.242 --> 00:53:02.591
vice provost, and
executive management team,

00:53:02.591 --> 00:53:09.180
my co-conspirators, who do so
much to advance CMU every day.

00:53:09.180 --> 00:53:12.455
Would the university leadership
team please stand to be recognized.

00:53:12.455 --> 00:53:22.455
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:53:25.236 --> 00:53:30.000
&gt;&gt; Like many of us here, I left home
as a teenager to pursue an education.

00:53:31.750 --> 00:53:35.161
As I prepared for
my journey from Iran to Texas,

00:53:35.161 --> 00:53:38.332
I remember asking my
mother to help me pack.

00:53:38.332 --> 00:53:44.086
She said,
pack light because what ever you need,

00:53:44.086 --> 00:53:48.744
you will find there. Pack light because

00:53:48.744 --> 00:53:53.548
what ever you need, you will find there.

00:53:53.548 --> 00:53:58.610
And so as I left home with
little more than a sense

00:53:58.610 --> 00:54:03.410
of optimism and a desire to
make the most of the incredible

00:54:03.410 --> 00:54:08.930
opportunities that only an education
in the United States could provide,

00:54:10.020 --> 00:54:13.820
I've carried my mother's words
with me over these many years.

00:54:15.190 --> 00:54:20.664
I think her advice may have been based
on a hope that I would return home

00:54:20.664 --> 00:54:26.220
once the initial excitement wore off,
but I was pretty stubborn.

00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:31.970
In fact, I got my tenacity from her,

00:54:31.970 --> 00:54:37.060
along with a work ethic
instilled in me by my father.

00:54:37.060 --> 00:54:38.820
My siblings who are here
can attest to that.

00:54:40.810 --> 00:54:44.090
But looking back, perhaps my mother
was hinting at the knowledge

00:54:44.090 --> 00:54:46.210
I would accumulate in the journey ahead.

00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:49.330
As a teacher and advisor,

00:54:49.330 --> 00:54:54.290
I came to understand the incredible
power of education to change lives.

00:54:54.290 --> 00:54:58.800
As a researcher, mentor, entrepreneur,
I observed the potential of

00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:04.140
a single idea to launch a new enterprise
or disrupt an entire industry

00:55:05.800 --> 00:55:09.870
and during my time in public
service in Washington,

00:55:09.870 --> 00:55:14.676
DC, I saw how these ideas,
how the ideas emerging from higher

00:55:14.676 --> 00:55:21.200
education serve as a foundation
of our success as a nation.

00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:24.780
My 30-year career ultimately led me here,

00:55:24.780 --> 00:55:28.856
to this city and this university.

00:55:28.856 --> 00:55:34.810
This community, our community

00:55:34.810 --> 00:55:41.350
embodies all of my most fervent
beliefs and my greatest passions.

00:55:41.350 --> 00:55:44.950
Every day at CMU, I am inspired by you.

00:55:46.390 --> 00:55:50.680
Here, the world's most ambitious
students collaborate at the edges and

00:55:50.680 --> 00:55:55.430
intersection of diverse fields, and
go on to change the world as alumni.

00:55:56.530 --> 00:56:02.260
Here, faculty leave an indelible mark
on society through their scholarship.

00:56:03.541 --> 00:56:05.241
Here, professionals and

00:56:05.241 --> 00:56:10.040
dedicated staff create an environment
that supports our shared success.

00:56:11.950 --> 00:56:19.160
These are the people and the ideals that
set CMU apart from the very beginning.

00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:26.935
When Andrew Carnegie founded the Carnegie Technical Schools to educate the sons and

00:56:26.935 --> 00:56:30.996
daughters of factory workers in 1900.

00:56:30.996 --> 00:56:32.410
Early, it's an evolution.

00:56:33.490 --> 00:56:38.040
This institution would house two
great learning environments,

00:56:38.040 --> 00:56:41.160
the College of Engineering and
the College of Fine Arts.

00:56:42.190 --> 00:56:49.720
You see right from the start, we were
bringing together creativity and industry.

00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:55.390
Our willingness to take risks
continued in the 20th century when

00:56:55.390 --> 00:57:00.320
we became the first degree granting
drama institution in the United States.

00:57:01.820 --> 00:57:06.987
And then when the Mellon Institute
of Research founded by Richard and

00:57:06.987 --> 00:57:13.237
Andrew Mellon, merged with Carnegie Tech
to create Carnegie Mellon University.

00:57:13.237 --> 00:57:17.394
And again, when Newell,
Simon, Perliss and

00:57:17.394 --> 00:57:22.886
Raj Reddy came to dominate
the emerging field of computer science

00:57:22.886 --> 00:57:28.120
and establish artificial intelligence
as the next frontier in human progress.

00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:33.580
To paraphrase CS pioneer Grace Hopper,
the most

00:57:33.580 --> 00:57:38.540
dangerous phrase in the English language
is we've always done it this way.

00:57:40.680 --> 00:57:43.810
So at a time when computers
were barely understood.

00:57:45.150 --> 00:57:49.060
We were among the very first to
recognize the power of computing and

00:57:49.060 --> 00:57:51.870
we made some big bets.

00:57:51.870 --> 00:57:56.077
In 1965, we established our
Department of Computer Science,

00:57:56.077 --> 00:58:00.897
in 1979, we founded the first
Robotics Institute at the US University.

00:58:00.897 --> 00:58:04.414
In 1984, we attracted funding
from the federal government to

00:58:04.414 --> 00:58:07.170
launch the Software Engineering Institute.

00:58:07.170 --> 00:58:11.530
And in 1988, we announced the first

00:58:11.530 --> 00:58:15.570
college in the world devoted
solely to computer science.

00:58:16.950 --> 00:58:22.435
Ours is still the model
that others follow.

00:58:22.435 --> 00:58:32.420
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:58:32.420 --> 00:58:33.960
&gt;&gt; In the process,

00:58:33.960 --> 00:58:38.550
we've created new fields of inquiry, such
as machine learning, transition design,

00:58:38.550 --> 00:58:40.489
and the science of learning.

00:58:41.560 --> 00:58:46.000
We've magnified our societal impact
through technologies like autonomous

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:48.710
vehicles and additive manufacturing.

00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:53.976
And we did all of this while
also cleaning up at the Tonys,

00:58:53.976 --> 00:58:57.241
the Emmys and
the Putnam competition.

00:58:57.241 --> 00:59:06.180
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; There's

00:59:06.180 --> 00:59:09.750
a lot to be gained by
looking back at our past.

00:59:09.750 --> 00:59:10.820
We see who we are,

00:59:12.540 --> 00:59:13.620
who we've always been.

00:59:14.870 --> 00:59:18.820
Alumni from those early years
would certainly see themselves

00:59:18.820 --> 00:59:20.820
in today's students.

00:59:20.820 --> 00:59:26.190
Entrepreneurial, creative, collaborative,

00:59:26.190 --> 00:59:30.672
whip smart, and just a little bit quirky.

00:59:30.672 --> 00:59:35.611
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; While the past has left a bright trail,

00:59:35.611 --> 00:59:39.923
the future is arriving faster than
anyone could have predicted and

00:59:39.923 --> 00:59:43.166
you've heard several
speakers talk about that.

00:59:43.166 --> 00:59:47.422
Our entire world is adapting
to unprecedented advances that

00:59:47.422 --> 00:59:52.170
are rapidly transforming our economy,
our society and our culture.

00:59:53.330 --> 01:00:00.100
We must ask ourselves, how can higher
education fit into this dazzling future?

01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:06.640
Indeed, our industry has
recently come under scrutiny.

01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:08.830
This is not a new phenomenon.

01:00:08.830 --> 01:00:13.636
Academic institutions have
often been seen as or

01:00:13.636 --> 01:00:17.170
criticized rather as ivory towers.

01:00:17.170 --> 01:00:21.307
But there is no doubt that sustained
investment in research and

01:00:21.307 --> 01:00:26.348
education has fueled our nation's
broad prosperity since World War II.

01:00:26.348 --> 01:00:35.799
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

01:00:35.799 --> 01:00:39.198
&gt;&gt; Universities exemplify our faith in

01:00:39.198 --> 01:00:46.003
the power of education to transcend
social economic and racial divides.

01:00:46.003 --> 01:00:50.132
To reinforce our role as
pillars of progressive society,

01:00:50.132 --> 01:00:55.106
higher education must approach our
mission with renewed attention to

01:00:55.106 --> 01:00:58.180
the unique demands of tomorrow.

01:00:58.180 --> 01:01:04.530
At stake is the ability of our society
to retain its fundamental commitment

01:01:04.530 --> 01:01:09.788
to democracy, truth, equity,
and freedom of expression.

01:01:09.788 --> 01:01:19.699
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

01:01:19.699 --> 01:01:21.103
&gt;&gt; At Carnegie Mellon,

01:01:21.103 --> 01:01:25.710
we have always responded to challenges
with trademark fearlessness.

01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:31.530
I'm reminded of the leadership
of Dick Cyert, who not only

01:01:31.530 --> 01:01:36.090
pioneered a new model for business
education as dean of our business school.

01:01:37.470 --> 01:01:42.470
But would later serve as one
the most visionary CMU presidents.

01:01:43.580 --> 01:01:47.170
More than 40 years ago, he made bold but

01:01:47.170 --> 01:01:51.780
calculated investments in the very
areas that define our leadership today.

01:01:53.160 --> 01:02:00.430
These risks were not always met with
broad support, but they paid off.

01:02:00.430 --> 01:02:05.570
As a result,
CMU grew from a small regional institution

01:02:05.570 --> 01:02:08.359
to an international center
of higher education.

01:02:09.660 --> 01:02:14.950
The time to be intentionally
bold is once again upon us.

01:02:14.950 --> 01:02:19.680
We have a singular opportunity to
wield our exceptional strength

01:02:20.810 --> 01:02:24.380
and make the next big investments
in our global leadership.

01:02:26.090 --> 01:02:30.890
Let's consider together what society
needs most from academic institutions In

01:02:30.890 --> 01:02:36.760
the context of our two core missions,
research and education.

01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:41.990
At CMU, we advance human knowledge
through scholarly research and

01:02:41.990 --> 01:02:45.600
forge new connections to our
humanity through the arts.

01:02:46.850 --> 01:02:52.750
But the nature of research and creativity
is rapidly changing, increasingly becoming

01:02:52.750 --> 01:02:57.710
dependent on people working across
the boundaries of established disciplines

01:02:58.750 --> 01:03:02.270
and on computational
data-driven approaches

01:03:02.270 --> 01:03:05.210
that are accelerating discovery and
innovation.

01:03:06.630 --> 01:03:10.540
This is precisely where CMU excels.

01:03:10.540 --> 01:03:14.830
In fact,
we have cultivated distinct leadership

01:03:14.830 --> 01:03:19.450
where these two areas intersect at
the nexus of technology and society.

01:03:20.780 --> 01:03:28.020
Through this expertise, we're enhancing
the way we live, work and communicate

01:03:28.020 --> 01:03:34.020
and we're shaping modern culture through
visionary art, performance and design.

01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:41.540
CMU legend Herb Simon once said,
we're not observers of the future,

01:03:42.540 --> 01:03:46.820
we're actors,
our job is to design a sustainable and

01:03:46.820 --> 01:03:50.080
acceptable world and bring it about.

01:03:51.530 --> 01:03:58.480
This remains true, as true today as when
he said it more than 20 years ago.

01:04:00.450 --> 01:04:05.800
What has also remained constant is
the tremendous responsibility that comes

01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:06.930
with this influence.

01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:12.970
I was reminded of this last year when I
came across an editorial by David Brooks

01:04:12.970 --> 01:04:18.140
in the New York Times, which
reflected on Pittsburgh's Renaissance.

01:04:18.140 --> 01:04:23.480
Of course, our connection to this
city is one of our greatest strengths.

01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:30.640
But this article,
while acknowledging CMU's positive impact,

01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:36.440
also warned of a so-called,
Carnegie Mellon layer of prosperity.

01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:42.840
That had not quite penetrated
working class neighborhoods.

01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:46.310
Indeed, we are witnessing
the disenfranchisement

01:04:46.310 --> 01:04:49.330
of a growing segment of our population,

01:04:49.330 --> 01:04:53.480
people who just do not see themselves
as part of this new economy,

01:04:54.790 --> 01:04:57.390
who can't even imagine a pathway to entry.

01:04:59.300 --> 01:05:05.111
While the nature of this divide has
been debated by pundits on the left and

01:05:05.111 --> 01:05:10.310
on the right, this goes far beyond partisan politics.

01:05:10.310 --> 01:05:12.330
We all bear responsibility for

01:05:12.330 --> 01:05:17.060
ensuring that the future we
are building works for everyone.

01:05:17.060 --> 01:05:22.561
If we succeed, the United States
will continue to serve as a shining

01:05:22.561 --> 01:05:27.781
example of prosperity and
democracy for the rest of the world.

01:05:27.781 --> 01:05:30.891
Here lies the greatest obligation for

01:05:30.891 --> 01:05:35.172
institutions of higher
learning in the modern era

01:05:35.172 --> 01:05:40.751
and a commitment that lies at
the heart of CMU's leadership.

01:05:40.751 --> 01:05:45.712
Even as we break new ground in technology,
we must work to mitigate

01:05:45.712 --> 01:05:50.600
any consequences that diminish
human dignity and opportunity.

01:05:51.740 --> 01:05:58.338
That is why at CMU, scientists and
engineers work together with philosophers,

01:05:58.338 --> 01:06:03.392
artists, economists who will
shape what might be possible,

01:06:03.392 --> 01:06:08.380
with ethicists, humanists, and
policy experts, who will guide our path

01:06:10.340 --> 01:06:15.230
and with the behavioral scientists
who will measure the impact of our

01:06:15.230 --> 01:06:16.614
work on humanity.

01:06:16.614 --> 01:06:22.350
Reinforcing our distinct strength at
the nexus of technology and humanity will

01:06:22.350 --> 01:06:28.440
be crucial to building an extraordinary
momentum in both research and creativity.

01:06:29.510 --> 01:06:34.300
And as president, I am committed
to supporting this leadership.

01:06:34.300 --> 01:06:38.344
By investing in a diverse community
of faculty and researchers,

01:06:38.344 --> 01:06:42.688
by doubling down on our partnership
beyond the borders of our campus

01:06:42.688 --> 01:06:47.258
and by creating vibrant living
laboratories in communities around

01:06:47.258 --> 01:06:48.066
the world.

01:06:48.066 --> 01:06:51.526
This is the next frontier for
Carnegie Mellon and

01:06:51.526 --> 01:06:56.600
I believe it will only deepen our
societal impact heading into the future.

01:06:56.600 --> 01:07:06.600
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:12.500
&gt;&gt; As much as we value the impact of our

01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:18.410
research and creativity, we are equally
committed to our educational mission

01:07:19.490 --> 01:07:21.430
and as a CMU parent,

01:07:21.430 --> 01:07:26.840
the responsibility of preparing the next
generation is deeply personal to me.

01:07:28.935 --> 01:07:34.097
For the CMU students, here today,

01:07:34.097 --> 01:07:39.720
and also across various campuses and
on our campus watch parties,

01:07:42.390 --> 01:07:45.130
you are my most important motivation.

01:07:47.820 --> 01:07:51.300
You're spending your
most formative years here

01:07:51.300 --> 01:07:54.320
from what I remember from
my own college experience.

01:07:55.660 --> 01:07:59.517
You are undoubtably forming
life-long friendships.

01:07:59.517 --> 01:08:03.020
You know, many of my best friends from college
are still my best friends today.

01:08:04.740 --> 01:08:09.590
The foundation you built here will
sustain you as you enter a world defined

01:08:09.590 --> 01:08:11.800
by continuous disruption.

01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:15.790
According to a recent study, about two
thirds of jobs that you will

01:08:15.790 --> 01:08:19.069
hold throughout your
lives do not even exist.

01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:23.890
This reality has dramatic and
immediate implications for

01:08:23.890 --> 01:08:26.060
the kind of education you deserve today.

01:08:27.710 --> 01:08:33.450
Throughout our history, every period
of significant technological change

01:08:33.450 --> 01:08:37.820
has been met with a corresponding
wave of innovation in education.

01:08:39.770 --> 01:08:43.720
I'm here to tell you, that right now,

01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:50.080
we are at the dawn of the next major
transformation in education

01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:54.283
and Carnegie Mellon will be at
the forefront of these changes.

01:08:54.283 --> 01:08:58.607
From curriculum to pedagogy,
to structure and organization,

01:08:58.607 --> 01:09:02.700
we are re-imagining our education
with your futures in mind.

01:09:04.450 --> 01:09:08.080
We're breaking down disciplinary silos and
launching

01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:12.696
cross-cutting programs that better serve
your interests and societies' needs.

01:09:12.696 --> 01:09:18.820
Programs like behavioral economics,
neuroscience and IDEATE.

01:09:18.820 --> 01:09:23.578
We're embedding continuous learning
in the skills that will only increase

01:09:23.578 --> 01:09:27.770
in demand as automation
reshapes the future work.

01:09:27.770 --> 01:09:32.000
Skills like communication,
critical thinking and entrepreneurship.

01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:38.710
We're investing in infrastructure that
supports the new ways that students learn

01:09:38.710 --> 01:09:42.832
and collaborate,
spaces like Tepper Quad and Scott Hall.

01:09:42.832 --> 01:09:47.583
We are utilizing our
expertise in the science of

01:09:47.583 --> 01:09:51.978
learning to develop
a personalized model of

01:09:51.978 --> 01:09:56.982
education focused on how
each of you learns best.

01:09:56.982 --> 01:10:02.034
Every day we work to build and
sustain a community that's inclusive,

01:10:02.034 --> 01:10:07.270
equitable, nurturing for
both graduate and undergraduate students.

01:10:07.270 --> 01:10:12.034
A place where diverse perspectives
can come together in a culture of

01:10:12.034 --> 01:10:13.380
civil discourse.

01:10:14.860 --> 01:10:18.530
To our students, thank you for

01:10:18.530 --> 01:10:23.910
entrusting us with this most
important chapter in your lives.

01:10:25.700 --> 01:10:32.656
You will always be at
the heart of my presidency.

01:10:32.656 --> 01:10:33.883
As we consider-

01:10:33.883 --> 01:10:43.326
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

01:10:43.326 --> 01:10:45.982
&gt;&gt; As we consider aspirations that unite

01:10:45.982 --> 01:10:50.796
this global community,
philanthropy must continue to catalyze and

01:10:50.796 --> 01:10:53.040
support our forward momentum.

01:10:54.220 --> 01:10:58.690
In fact, this university was
founded by an act of philanthropy.

01:11:00.150 --> 01:11:05.850
At this pivotal moment, I am delighted
today to announce two extraordinary

01:11:05.850 --> 01:11:10.110
new commitments that will provide
critical resources to Carnegie Mellon.

01:11:11.270 --> 01:11:16.110
In recent years, Carnegie Mellon has
been making significant investments for

01:11:16.110 --> 01:11:17.790
our College of Engineering,

01:11:17.790 --> 01:11:23.280
including a state of the art maker
ecosystem that serves the entire campus.

01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:27.824
Today I'm pleased to announce that
the Allegheny Foundation has committed

01:11:27.824 --> 01:11:31.658
a $30 million lead grant toward
the transformation of Scaife

01:11:31.658 --> 01:11:36.000
Hall into a modern new home for
our Mechanical Engineering Department.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:46.000
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

01:11:52.302 --> 01:11:54.666
&gt;&gt; This grant, the largest in the history

01:11:54.666 --> 01:12:00.040
of Allegheny Foundation, will enable us to
bring our total infrastructure investments

01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:04.960
in engineering over the last decade to
more than a quarter billion dollars.

01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:10.870
But this commitment, CMU will be better
able to compete for best students and

01:12:10.870 --> 01:12:16.330
faculty, driving Pittsburgh's
reputation as a hub for innovation.

01:12:16.330 --> 01:12:19.720
We're joined today by Matt Groll,
President and

01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:21.780
Chairman of Allegheny Foundation.

01:12:21.780 --> 01:12:24.315
Please join me in thanking
Allegheny Foundation for

01:12:24.315 --> 01:12:26.222
their generosity to Carnegie Mellon.

01:12:26.222 --> 01:12:28.607
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Matt, please stand to be recognized.

01:12:28.607 --> 01:12:38.607
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

01:12:40.723 --> 01:12:43.783
&gt;&gt; At a time when college education has

01:12:43.783 --> 01:12:48.883
never been more important,
many prospective students and

01:12:48.883 --> 01:12:53.473
middle class families feel
as though they're simply

01:12:53.473 --> 01:12:58.484
priced out of education that
they may need for the future.

01:12:58.484 --> 01:13:04.491
This is why CMU has made growing our
endowment for scholarship, fellowships,

01:13:04.491 --> 01:13:09.792
and financial aid, one of our most
important strategic priorities.

01:13:09.792 --> 01:13:15.887
Today I am pleased to announce
that CMU trustee Todd Johnson and

01:13:15.887 --> 01:13:22.672
his wife Cindy have committed $50
million to create an endowment to

01:13:22.672 --> 01:13:28.423
support undergraduate scholarship and
student success.

01:13:28.423 --> 01:13:38.423
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

01:14:00.181 --> 01:14:01.442
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

01:14:01.442 --> 01:14:11.442
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

01:14:18.235 --> 01:14:20.708
&gt;&gt; You know, I made the announcement a couple of

01:14:20.708 --> 01:14:24.041
times yesterday, and
I said this last night.

01:14:24.041 --> 01:14:29.352
Every time I'm making this announcement
when I get to the word student,

01:14:29.352 --> 01:14:30.230
I choke up.

01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:32.708
That's why we're here.

01:14:32.708 --> 01:14:36.705
Todd and Cindy will you stand
please to be recognized.

01:14:36.705 --> 01:14:41.404
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

01:14:41.404 --> 01:14:52.216
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

01:14:52.216 --> 01:14:53.280
&gt;&gt; Well, I lost my place.

01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:54.929
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

01:15:02.823 --> 01:15:04.920
Boy, I didn't realize this
speech was this long.

01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:10.068
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; I know, tell me about it.

01:15:13.122 --> 01:15:18.527
Well,
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

01:15:23.065 --> 01:15:25.257
&gt;&gt; Back to the place that I lost track

01:15:25.257 --> 01:15:25.898
of time.

01:15:25.898 --> 01:15:30.708
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; This support will greatly expand our

01:15:30.708 --> 01:15:35.000
ability to ensure that
a Carnegie Mellon education

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:38.908
is within the reach of
all talented students.

01:15:41.414 --> 01:15:47.717
This gift, the largest toward scholarship
support in Carnegie Mellon's history,

01:15:47.717 --> 01:15:51.917
was inspired by Todd's own path
to success here at CMU and

01:15:51.917 --> 01:15:55.260
the fellowships that funded his education.

01:15:57.160 --> 01:16:00.470
Please once again join me in thanking and

01:16:00.470 --> 01:16:05.215
congratulating the Johnsons for their
generosity and commitment to our students.

01:16:05.215 --> 01:16:08.405
Todd and Cindy, we are so
grateful to you for your generosity.

01:16:08.405 --> 01:16:16.458
[APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

01:16:16.458 --> 01:16:22.210
&gt;&gt; I hope you packed a good lunch.

01:16:22.210 --> 01:16:22.718
This is a long speech.

01:16:22.718 --> 01:16:27.640
My fellow Tartans.

01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:32.233
Whether you're in Pittsburgh,
Silicon Valley,

01:16:32.233 --> 01:16:37.249
Australia, Rwanda or Qatar,
I hope you are as excited as

01:16:37.249 --> 01:16:42.080
I am about the future of
Carnegie Mellon University.

01:16:43.850 --> 01:16:48.360
To be part of CMU at
this moment is to be at

01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:53.560
the cusp of the next great phase of
societal and human development.

01:16:55.250 --> 01:17:01.930
If we continue doing what we do today,
we'll maintain momentum and

01:17:01.930 --> 01:17:06.100
continue to be a great university.

01:17:06.100 --> 01:17:10.680
But if we are very intentional, if we

01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:17.600
are unapologetically bold, and
if we are committed to taking risks.

01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:22.620
I am confident that we
will position ourselves

01:17:22.620 --> 01:17:25.338
among the top tier
institutions in the world.

01:17:25.338 --> 01:17:31.155
A place that's known for writing the story of this century.

01:17:31.155 --> 01:17:35.960
An institution dedicated
to anticipating and

01:17:35.960 --> 01:17:40.390
solving the most pressing
challenges facing humanity.

01:17:40.390 --> 01:17:45.940
Through creative inquiry, through
scientific discovery, through the impact

01:17:45.940 --> 01:17:51.370
of technology and through a transformative
education that changes lives.

01:17:52.700 --> 01:17:58.290
As we embark on this exhilarating
future together, we do so

01:17:58.290 --> 01:18:03.665
as a community bound together
by a set of core values

01:18:03.665 --> 01:18:05.706
that serve as our foundation.

01:18:05.706 --> 01:18:12.850
Integrity, knowledge, compassion, respect.

01:18:12.850 --> 01:18:17.940
The great scientist Albert Einstein
understood this fundamental connection

01:18:17.940 --> 01:18:20.650
between excellence and human values.

01:18:21.900 --> 01:18:23.440
In 1950 he wrote,

01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:30.150
only morality in our actions can
give beauty and dignity to life.

01:18:32.020 --> 01:18:37.199
To make this a living force and
bring it to clear consciousness

01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:42.340
is perhaps the foremost task of education.

01:18:44.670 --> 01:18:48.080
Andrew Carnegie put it
a little more simply.

01:18:49.130 --> 01:18:50.540
My heart is in the work.

01:18:52.030 --> 01:18:56.880
Each one of us has a role to
play in bringing beauty and

01:18:56.880 --> 01:18:58.890
dignity to our mission.

01:18:58.890 --> 01:19:02.868
Through the impact we make on society,
the leaders we develop and

01:19:02.868 --> 01:19:05.418
the opportunities we create for others.

01:19:05.418 --> 01:19:10.727
