00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.450
- So let's draw a square.

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.520
So it's not perfectly drawn but this is a

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.920
reasonable attempt at a square, and of course

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.720
one of the things that we know about a square

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.020
is all of the sides are going to have the same length.

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.090
So if the length of this side is x,

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.050
well all of them are going to have,

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.490
all of them are going to have length x.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.490
We also know this is a, these are going to be

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.110
right angles, that's what makes it a square.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.190
Now the question I want to ask,

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.390
are the lengths of the side of a square

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.890
proportional to its area?

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.450
And I encourage you to pause the video and think about it,

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.890
are the lengths of a side, are the lengths

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.180
of the sides of a square proportional to the square's area?

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.250
Well to think about that let's draw,

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:46.750
let's have a little table here.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.730
So side length, side length

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.450
and that's going to be given as x,

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.290
so that's going to be x, and then

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:59.850
I'll have another column, I can draw

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.150
that a little bit neater so let me

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.520
use this tool, so there you go,

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.490
and I'm going to make two columns,

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.881
two columns right over here,

00:01:09.881 --> 00:01:12.170
and then over here I'm going to put area.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.750
Area, and what's the area going to be?

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.090
Well the area is going to be one of the sides squared,

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.800
I suppose you could view it as the width times the height,

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.650
so its going to be x times x or x squared.

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.490
So let's just pick some values for x

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.850
and then figure out what the area is going to be.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.790
So if x is going to be equal to one,

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.550
the area's going to be one times one,

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.020
which is still one.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.590
If x is going to be equal to two,

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.780
the area's going to be two times two,

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.790
which is equal to four.

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.920
If x is going to be equal to three,

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.770
the area's going to be three times three,

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.430
which is equal to nine, and I could keep going

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.190
but I think this is enough, these are enough points

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.450
to think about is the side length proportional to the area,

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.590
or is the area proportional to the side length?

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:59.890
Now one of the ways you can think about

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.840
proportionality is, are the ratios between

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.050
the side length and the corresponding area

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.650
always the same, so we want to look at

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.250
the ratio between side length and area,

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.160
or area and side length, as long as they're always constant.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.050
Area and side length, here let me do those

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.380
as two separate, and side length.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.150
So let's make an extra column here.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.070
Let's make an extra column here,

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.350
so there we go, and let's look at that ratio,

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.710
the ratio of area to side,

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:35.940
to side length.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.620
So here the ratio's one over one,

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.281
one over one, which equals one.

00:02:41.281 --> 00:02:42.850
Now that seems reasonable.

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.620
For this next one the ratio of

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.820
area over side length is four over two,

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.220
four over two, which equals two.

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.590
I don't even have to go to this third one,

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.800
I can, I can say this ratio is going to be

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.520
area over side length is going to be equal to three.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.380
And notice I get a different value every time.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.350
This is not equal to a constant, I don't have

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.680
a constant ratio between area and side length

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.720
so that tells us that these two, that

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.790
the side length and the area are not proportional.

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.500
Not, not proportional.

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.650
And if you look at it, it makes a lot of sense

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.250
that the ratio is actually going to be equal to

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.290
the actual side length, that it changes

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.750
depending on the side length and that's because

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.080
we're squaring things, it's literally,

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.420
you're literally taking x squared,

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.020
if, you know, you have x here,

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.510
this is going to be x squared

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.190
and the ratio is going to be x squared over x,

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.890
which of course is always just going to be

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.990
equal, this is x times x divided by x,

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:40.590
that's always going to be equal to x,

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:41.590
and we see that right over here.

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.931
But it's definitely not proportional.
