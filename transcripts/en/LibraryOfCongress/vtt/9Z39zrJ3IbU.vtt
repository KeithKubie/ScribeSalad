00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.480
&gt;&gt; Mary Jane Deeb: Well, welcome
all to the Library of Congress.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.180
I'm Mary Jane Deeb, Chief of
the African Middle East Division

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.940
which is sponsoring this exciting
event today in partnership

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.680
with the Assyrian Universal
Alliance of America.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.720
Before I start let me
first thank the two people

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.850
who have been most instrumental
in making this program possible.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.070
Miriam [assumed spelling]
[inaudible] came to the Library

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.070
about a year ago to discuss the
possibility of holding a program

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.390
on Assyrians at the Library.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.530
Together we planned and designed
a framework for this project.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.110
And then Eden [assumed
spelling] [inaudible] joined us

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.420
to organize the content
of today's symposium,

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.280
and to bring together
this exceptional group

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.260
of scholars whom you
will hear from today.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.880
Let's give them both
a round of applause.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.510
Can you please stand?

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:24.040
[ Clapping ]

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.530
I also want to thank the Chairman
of the Assyrian Universal Alliance,

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.510 position:56%
Carlo Ganjeh, who will address us
in a moment, and I want to thank him

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.080
for his support for this program.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.720
Thanks also go to my own team--

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.410
Joan Weeks, head of
the Near East Section.

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:46.780
There she is at the back.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.000
[inaudible], Mohammed
[inaudible], Levon Avdoyan

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.010
and Ann Brenner [assumed spelling].

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.240
They all put together the
wonderful display of materials

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.950
that you will see down there
in the Woodrow Wilson Room.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.010
Today's symposium on the Assyrian
legacy from ancient civilization

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.580
to today's cultural revival
is the first symposium

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.130
on the Assyrians ever held
at the Library of Congress.

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.880
It is also part of a series

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.340
of programs my division has been
holding for the past few years

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.850
to bring to the public the history

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.430
of some ancient civilizations
of the Near East.

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.480 position:56%
We hear little about the history of
these ancient people today primarily

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.210
because the empires of which
they were part have disappeared.

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:38.010
However, there exists abundant
materials in ancient [inaudible],

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.060
Greek, Latin text on the Assyrians,

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.670
and certainly since the mid-19th
century there have been major

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.620
archaeological discoveries
in Mesopotamia

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.490
to chronicle the history.

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.960
And yet while some
are trying to unearth

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.690
and preserve the ancient
sites that tell the story

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.820
of past civilizations others,
unfortunately, are destroying them.

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:08.240
At the Library of Congress we
collect, we preserve, we serve

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.410
and we make possible through our
programs a better understanding

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.200
of the past history and the
present cultures of the world.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.770
We consider that the Library's
unique collections preserve the

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:24.960
memory of the world and through
our programs we reveal some

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.760
of its recollections.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.540
And, so, today we're sharing with
all those present in this room,

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.070
and with all those who will be
watching the videotape program,

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.520
a page of history that will
be narrated by a number

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.580
of exceptional scholars
who have travelled from all

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.150
over the United States,
Canada and as far as Finland

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.460
to present the research
on the Assyrian legacy.

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:57.790
But to begin with I would like
to introduce Robert Newlen,

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:03.240
the Chief of Staff of
the Library of Congress.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:13.500 position:56%
And Robert Newlen was appointed
Chief of Staff on December 14, 2014.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.510
In this capacity he has
Library-wide program

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.640
and management responsibilities,
and also oversees the Offices

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:26.000
of Communications, Congressional
Relations, Development,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.570
Financial Office, Contracts and
Grant Management, General Counsel,

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:34.730
Office of Opportunity and
Inclusiveness and Compliance,

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:38.200
and the Office of Strategic
and Planning Office.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.790
Before being named Chief of Staff
Mr Newlen joined the Library

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:48.960
of Congress in November 1975,
and has been at that institution

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:54.070
since then, most recently as
the Assistant Law Librarian

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.070
for Collections, Outreach and
Services in the Law Library.

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:04.510 position:56%
So, let us all welcome Robert Newlen
who will make a few remarks for us.

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:11.050
[ Clapping ]

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.070
&gt;&gt; Robert Newlen: Well, good
morning and thank you, Mary Jane,

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.570
for that kind introduction.

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.060
I really appreciated that
she said I had been Chief

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:23.200
of Staff since November 2014.

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.990
At a similar function here at the
Library recently I was introduced

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:31.960
as Robert Newlen who has been
Chief of Staff since November 1914.

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.730
And I have been here a long time.

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:42.370
I'm in my 41st year, but I was not
around for the Russian Revolution.

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.870
So, thank you, again, Mary Jane.

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:46.340
And welcome to all of you.

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.780
And I welcome you on behalf
of the Acting Librarian

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.820
of Congress, David S. Mao.

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:59.740
As a Librarian myself I encourage
each of you to explore the breadth

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:03.290
and depth of our incredible
collections both online

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:04.750
and in person.

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:07.450
And I hope if this is your
first visit to the Library

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:12.360
that you'll have an opportunity to
explore this incredible building,

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:17.700
the Thomas Jefferson Building,
which is a real national treasure.

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:21.580
Today's symposium is an example

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:24.730
of what the Library
of Congress does best.

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:28.610
And that is bringing
people together to explore,

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:33.290
learn and discover how each
culture has contributed

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:36.570
to the evolution of civilization.

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:43.390
To the best of my knowledge this is
the first time the Library has held

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:50.150
a program of this magnitude
on the Assyrian civilization.

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:54.410
The symposium today
would not have occurred

00:06:54.410 --> 00:07:00.330
without the Assyrian Universal
Alliance of America, its Chairman,

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:07.230
Carlo Ganjeh, Dr. Eden [inaudible]
and Mrs. Miriam [inaudible],

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:11.680 position:56%
as well as all of the Library staff.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:16.510
I also want to acknowledge Mary
Jane Deeb, Chief of the African

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:18.230
and Middle Eastern Division,

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:21.160 position:56%
who brings such wonderful
leadership not only to the division,

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.150
but to the Library of Congress.

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:26.670 position:56%
And I would also like to acknowledge
the very talented Library

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:28.860
of Congress staff that
she works with.

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:33.210 position:56%
We have two treasures here at the
Library of Congress, our collections

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:37.140
and our staff, who really
are national treasures.

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:40.380
So, I'd like to give
Mary Jane and her staff

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:44.510
and our other contributors
a round of applause.

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:50.370
[ Clapping ]

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:52.900
It is most fitting that
the Assyrian community

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:56.060
of America hold a conference
on its history

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:59.290
in ancient civilization
here at the Library.

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:03.870
We hold one of the largest
collections in the world of books,

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:10.230
serials, newspapers, maps and
photographs on and about Assyrians,

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:15.300
not only in Semitic languages
such as Aramaic, Syriac,

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:20.600
Arabic and Hebrew, but also
in Turkish and Persian,

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:25.960
as well as in English and numerous
European languages such as French,

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:29.870
German, Italian and Spanish.

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:35.020
Mary Jane mentioned earlier the
publications or the materials

00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:37.540
that we have in the room adjoining.

00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:41.480
And I hope you'll take
advantage at the breaks and lunch

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:44.310
to take a look at the
material there.

00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:49.670
The room that the material is
in is the Woodrow Wilson Room

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:51.170
of the Library of Congress.

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:56.140 position:56%
So, you're going to be surrounded
by Woodrow Wilson's personal library

00:08:56.140 --> 00:09:03.570
which was given to us
by his widow in 1946.

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:08.240
In conclusion, I want to wish you
a most enjoyable day as you listen

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:12.420
to the celebrated scholars from
around the world that are speaking.

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:16.290
I had a chance to review
the biographies of all

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:20.120
of the participants in
this symposium today,

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:26.060
and it's really an
unbelievable group of scholars.

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:29.690
So, thank you for being
here and enjoy the day.

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:31.560
And welcome to the Library.

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:33.360
Thank you.

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:42.270
[ Clapping ]

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:43.570
&gt;&gt; Mary Jane Deeb:
Thank you, Robert.

00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:47.150
And thank you all for being here.

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:51.160
And now I'd like to
introduce someone

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:55.970
without whose support we would not
have been able to gather today.

00:09:55.970 --> 00:10:01.330
Carlo Ganjeh is the Chairman

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:09.880
of the Assyrian American National
Federation Advisory Boards

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:13.310
and an advisor to the
Assyrian American Association

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:16.040
of San Jose, California.

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:19.950
And in 2002 he was elected
Chairman of the America's Chapter

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:22.900
of the Assyrian Universal Alliance.

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:26.740
He is an Assyrian who for
30 years has been engaged

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:31.340
as an active volunteer working on
Assyrian issues serving his people

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:35.930
in different capacities at the
local, state and national levels

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:39.420
in U.S. organizations and globally.

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:44.100
He's a graduate of the Assyrian
High School in Tehran, Shoshan,

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:48.340
but immigrated as a
refugee to the United States

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:51.740
because of the Iraq-Iran war.

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:57.170
He currently resides in the Bay
Area in California where he owns

00:10:57.170 --> 00:11:01.200
and operates a financing business.

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:04.550
And I would like to
call upon him to come

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:09.350
and make some remarks
on this occasion.

00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:11.510
So, Carlo Ganjeh?

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:23.820
[ Clapping ]

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:26.250
&gt;&gt; Carlo Ganjeh: [foreign
language] peace on you.

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:28.130
On behalf of the Assyrian American

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:32.860
and Assyrian Universal Alliance
Americas Chapter I would

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:37.040
like to thank the Library of
Congress, especially Dr. Deeb

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:42.360
for assisting us in organizing
this program for our people one

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:45.240 position:56%
of the builders of the civilization.

00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:51.990
After World War I and II,
and Assyrians being displaced

00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:56.250
from their original lands
because of the World Wars,

00:11:56.250 --> 00:12:01.290
the Assyrian community in Middle
East they see the need that we have

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:05.660
to have international organization
to work on the Assyrian issues

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:09.030
to preserve our culture,
our heritage

00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:15.570
and bring a better
future for our people.

00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:22.120
Exactly two years ago after the
Isis [inaudible] attacked Mosul

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:28.930
over 200,000 Assyrians they
were displaced from [inaudible].

00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:34.630
Today Assyrians live
in over 40 countries.

00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:38.380
And we try to preserve
our culture, our heritage

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:41.710
and bring a better
future for our people.

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:45.920
Assyrian people are indigenous
people of the Middle East.

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:52.650
And we are continuing to preserve
our heritage, our language,

00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:57.640
and we believe that in future
we will have a better, peaceful

00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:00.440
and prosperous future
for our people.

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:04.320
Thank you, and I also would like
to thank you Dr. Eden [inaudible]

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:08.010
because without her this
program it was impossible.

00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:12.040
Again, thank you from the Library
of Congress for the opportunity.

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:15.130
And I was amazed with the
collections that you have.

00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:17.880
And I'm sure this program
will bring more attention

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:22.100
to the Assyrian Americans to
contribute more to the Library,

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:26.760
and hopefully we can get more
books and more publications here.

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:30.510
Thank you and we appreciate
your help and support.

00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:40.040
[ Clapping ]

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:42.380
&gt;&gt; Mary Jane Deeb: Thank
you so much, Mr. Ganjeh.

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:47.180
And now we're going
to start the program.

00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:51.410
And may I call upon
Professors Harrak,

00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:55.590
Woods and Parpola to
come to the stage?

00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:24.570
Thank you.

00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:30.160
So, we will start in the order
that you have on your programs.

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:34.490
We will start with
Professor Amir Harrak.

00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:38.210
Each speaker will speak
for about 20 minutes.

00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:46.660
And we will leave the questions and
answers for the end of the panel.

00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:49.980
And at the end we will open
it to questions and answers,

00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:55.360
and we'll be following
the program you have here.

00:14:55.360 --> 00:15:03.500 position:56%
Although you do have the bios of
the speakers I will still read them.

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:07.420
And the reason I'm doing so
is that we're being televised,

00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:11.290
and the program will be webcast
on the Library's website.

00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:15.820 position:56%
And, so, for people around the world
who will be seeing this program,

00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:18.510
we are just a small
fraction of the people

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:23.150
who will be seeing this program.

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:26.740
Once it's webcast then
it's picked up by YouTube,

00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:30.350
it's picked up by other
organizations, and we have found

00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:33.810
out that our programs
are seen literally

00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:36.650
in every corner of the world.

00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:42.320
So, I will begin with
introducing Professor Harrak.

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:45.750
He's a professor of
Aramaic and Syriac Studies

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:47.970
at the University of Toronto.

00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:49.830
He studied Philosophy and Theology

00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:52.260
at St. John's Seminary
in Mosul, Iraq.

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:57.490
And in 1980 he obtained
three [inaudible] degrees

00:15:57.490 --> 00:16:03.340 position:56%
in Church History, Oriental Studies,
and Archaeology and Art History

00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:06.770
from the Catholic University
of Louvain, Belgium.

00:16:06.770 --> 00:16:10.950
He received his Ph.D.
in 1987 in Assyriology

00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:13.890
from the University
of Toronto, Canada.

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:19.660
And the next year began a teaching
career at the same university.

00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:24.020
Among his latest publications
are the two volumes on Syriac

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:28.260
and Garshuni Inscriptions
of Iraq published in 2010

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:32.120
by the Académie des Inscriptions
et Belles-Lettres in Paris,

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:41.060 position:56%
and a Catalog of Syriac and Garshuni
Manuscripts CSCO, Subsidia, Louvain.

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:43.750
He is also the founder
and the current president

00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:46.710
of the Canadian Society
for Syriac Studies

00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:49.930
and the General Editor
of its journal.

00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:57.450
Professor Amir Harrak will now give
a talk and a Power presentation

00:16:57.450 --> 00:17:01.280
on the Neo-Assyrian Winged
Bulls and their Origins.

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:03.580
Professor Harrak?

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:12.340 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Amir Harrak: Thank you, Dr. Deeb.

00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:13.870
Good morning, everyone.

00:17:13.870 --> 00:17:18.890
I will talk about winged
bulls and beyond.

00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:23.260
I would like to talk a little
bit about other stone works,

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:26.810
as well as ivory and
jewelry, and you will see

00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:30.510
that it is quite fascinating.

00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:43.070
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:48.480 position:56%
Okay. But with the ninth and seventh
centuries B.C. Assyria built the

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:53.730 position:56%
first empire which extended from
Western Persia to the Mediterranean,

00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:57.780
and from Northern Mesopotamia
and Syria to Egypt.

00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:02.260
The empire was constantly dated
by a powerful military machine,

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:05.760
and a sophisticated administrative
system, both reflected

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:09.060 position:56%
in native annals and state archives.

00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:13.760
The empire also produced
remarkable works of art.

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:18.910
Laurel leaf sculptures,
wall paintings, jewelry

00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:23.670
and ivory carvings, which
at finest and elegance

00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:28.160
to mighty Assyria we shall
survey this great wealth of art,

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:32.320
which had reached new and
sometimes unique standards.

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:37.770
The Assyrian stone [inaudible]
and artists expressed some

00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:41.370
of their religious beliefs
in their stone works.

00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:48.320
The gateways of palaces and temples
were all flanked by winged bulls

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:53.810
and lions, which they took for
guardians of gates and entrances.

00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:56.330
Since the third millennium B.C.

00:18:56.330 --> 00:19:03.090 position:56%
in Mesopotamia supernatural beings
were conceived as being combinations

00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:06.380
of human and animal
elements, and thus we see

00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:10.020 position:56%
in art human-headed bulls and lions,

00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:14.570
and statues of half
man-half bull or lion.

00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:19.660
During the 13th century B.C. the
Assyrians added another element

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:25.850
to these monsters-- wings to
highlight their celestial nature.

00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:32.470 position:56%
Thus winged men and winged bulls and
lions began to appear in a variety

00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:38.860
of positions as you can see
in the [inaudible] here.

00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:43.120
Figures that quickly spread
out from Assyria to the rest

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:45.340
of Mesopotamia and Upper Syria.

00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:51.180
As Assyria progressively became an
unmatched superpower at the dawn

00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:56.850
of the first millennium B.C.
Assyrians stoned the monsters

00:19:56.850 --> 00:20:02.890
into [inaudible] placed
almost always at gateways.

00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:07.100
Here they play two roles--
architectural and religious.

00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:15.330
In architecture the [inaudible]
are mere jumps upon which arches

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:17.410
of gates and doorways rest.

00:20:17.410 --> 00:20:22.740
And in religion they are protective
deities not much different

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:27.150
from the Judeo-Christian
concept of angels.

00:20:27.150 --> 00:20:30.370
There are three main
types of [inaudible]--

00:20:30.370 --> 00:20:37.690
the Centaur, made of the upper body
of man and the lower body of lion,

00:20:37.690 --> 00:20:43.430
attested monumentally only
during the ninth century B.C.,

00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:53.150 position:56%
the Anthropomorphic Winged bull,
and the Anthropomorphic Winged Lion.

00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:58.020
The latter two are known from the
ninth to the seventh centuries.

00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:01.530
The Assyrians portrayed
these monsters

00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:07.710
with the stylistic features known
to the Assyrians of that period.

00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:15.300
They all wear cylindrical tiaras
with horns seen in other deities,

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:17.890
but the earrings hanging
from the ears of some

00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:23.010
of the [inaudible] are also worn
by Assyrian kings and dignitaries.

00:21:23.010 --> 00:21:26.530
Some were found in
archaeological digs, in fact.

00:21:26.530 --> 00:21:30.980
The hair which covers the cheeks,
the chin and part of the chest,

00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:36.090
and which also falls at the back
of the head, is always plated just

00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:40.920
as the hair of contemporary
kings and people is.

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:42.740
And the depiction of [inaudible]

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:47.040
and people the eyebrows
are thick and continuous.

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:51.380
The eyes are bulgy and the
nose is slightly round,

00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:54.890
anatomical features known to
Mediterranean people in general.

00:21:54.890 --> 00:22:01.930
One of the most remarkable Assyrian
achievements in art is to express

00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:06.270
in the same work different
positions at the same time.

00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:12.880
Some of the [inaudible] are
depicted with five legs to be seen

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:17.850
in a profile in a walking
position as if patrolling,

00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:23.430
and in front in a resting
position of guards at entrances.

00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:28.380
These peculiar anatomical features
dates to the ninth century B.C.,

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:32.890
but Assyrians expressed
already during the 13th century

00:22:32.890 --> 00:22:38.720
in a relief showing
King Tukulti-Ninurta I

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:42.710
in two worshipping attitudes--
standing and kneeling.

00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:47.580
The fact that the Assyrian artist
at the time of Ashurbanipal,

00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:52.030
seventh century B.C., also
depicted a hunting lion

00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:58.180
in three positions coming out of
the cage, moving towards the king

00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:04.120
and jumping at him highlights
a centuries-old practice among

00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:05.450
the Assyrians.

00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:07.000
The [inaudible] are mentioned

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.920
in Assyrian royal inscriptions
naming them

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:14.140
and defining their
functions within the palace.

00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:17.930
The two frequent names
are the Lamashtu,

00:23:17.930 --> 00:23:22.950
she's a female, or
Lamashtu and Shadu.

00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:29.030
The Lamashtu may have its origin
in the Sumerian protective goddess,

00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:33.750
Lama, and is always a good
genius, a good spirit.

00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:36.520
By contrast the name Shadu refers

00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:40.890
to two different spirits--
one good and one bad.

00:23:40.890 --> 00:23:43.790
But when Shadu accompanies the name

00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:48.130
of Lamashtu Shadu is
always the good spirit.

00:23:48.130 --> 00:23:51.440
Modern Assyrians know
the name Shada,

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:58.590 position:56%
devil from which the word Shaitan,
devilish or foolish person, derives.

00:23:58.590 --> 00:24:05.100
I will expand now to talk a
little bit about laurel leafs.

00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:07.340
The Assyrian artists also worked

00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:11.080
with the stone slabs
recording religious, military

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:14.370
and hunting scenes
carved in laurel leafs.

00:24:14.370 --> 00:24:17.830
Since ancient Mesopotamian
buildings were constructed

00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:20.840
with mud bricks stone
slabs were placed

00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:24.290
against their lower
walls in protection.

00:24:24.290 --> 00:24:30.010
The local limestone was
readily available in Assyria,

00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:34.210
and with it until recently
churches, synagogues, mosques

00:24:34.210 --> 00:24:36.250
and houses were constructed.

00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:42.140
The practice of depicting
sceneries on such slabs is known

00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:46.330
in Mesopotamia and Syria, but
the maturity of the Assyrian art,

00:24:46.330 --> 00:24:51.760 position:56%
even in the ninth century, indicates
an indigenous practice dated much

00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:55.100
earlier than that century.

00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:57.810
The first depicted
slabs date to the time

00:24:57.810 --> 00:25:01.870
of the ninth century Ashurbanipal I

00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:07.440
in his capital city Kalhu
nowadays called Nimrud.

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:10.500
The scenery is essentially
religious and even

00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:16.790
when it includes hunting episodes.

00:25:16.790 --> 00:25:20.830
It shows the king with a variety

00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:24.900
of winged genies including
eagle-headed men

00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:32.740
and winged men standing or kneeling
on both sides of a stylized tree.

00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:39.720
The genies hold bales and cords
while the king carries a libation

00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:44.490
bowl in the right hand and holds
a staff with the left hand.

00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:49.580
In another [inaudible] scene the
king is seen seated with a bowl

00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:57.850
in his hand and surrounded
by attendants and genies.

00:25:57.850 --> 00:26:01.030
Military and hunting scenes
dominated art of the eighth

00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:03.550
and seventh centuries B.C. in line

00:26:03.550 --> 00:26:05.750
with the territorial
expansion of Assyria.

00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:11.980
In both cases the king is the
focus of the scenes with no place

00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:18.590
for genies or other divinities
including the national guard Ashur.

00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:23.470
We see the king participating in
warfare and hunting wild animals,

00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:27.080
namely lions, and in
both cases he is depicted

00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:32.990
as a human being proving
his prowess in hunting.

00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:37.560
Military scenes include sieges,
deportations and impaling,

00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:41.300
violent tactics used
by all ancient nations.

00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:48.070
Even is these brutal contexts the
Assyrian artist added environmental

00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:54.870
sceneries including rivers
filled with fish and crabs,

00:26:54.870 --> 00:27:00.330
mountains covered with
trees and shrubs,

00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:04.560
and all kinds of birds
flying in the open skies.

00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:11.850
Lines of soldiers and prisoners
of war are traced symmetrically

00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:15.430
and harmoniously with
lines of trees.

00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:21.400
And since this arrangement recurs
nearly in all military scenes it is

00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:27.190
as if the artist involved nature
in otherwise bloody events.

00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:32.670
In the siege of Lachish,
a biblical city in Israel,

00:27:32.670 --> 00:27:34.630
which the late century
Sennacherib [inaudible],

00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:39.120
the artist produced a
well-conceived composition.

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:42.310
The scene begins at the bottom

00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:46.680
with the drafted armies marching
toward the city of Lachish located

00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:51.430
in the middle of the way, and then
progresses toward the seated king

00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:54.680
who occupies the top
of the composition.

00:27:54.680 --> 00:28:00.270
The military scenes include a
variety of weapons, siege engines,

00:28:00.270 --> 00:28:04.970
defensive tactics and
different throngs of soldiers.

00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:15.290
The artist also traced the
topography of foreign countries.

00:28:15.290 --> 00:28:18.890
For example, here we have boats,
whether they are maritime,

00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:23.710
mountainous or just plain lands,
foreign people are depicted

00:28:23.710 --> 00:28:27.010
by the way they physically
looked and dressed up

00:28:27.010 --> 00:28:30.620
and the type of works
they undertook.

00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:35.590
Besides military events peace
treaties are fittingly recorded.

00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:42.650
And the scene shown in the throne
of King [inaudible] III the treaty

00:28:42.650 --> 00:28:45.480
between warring kings is concluded

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:51.440
by probably the first
political handshaking.

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:57.260
A rare scene even in antiquity and
you can see them shaking the hands.

00:28:57.260 --> 00:29:00.420
Hunting depictions are
particularly interesting

00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:05.800
because they show striking realism
never detected in ancient art.

00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:11.530
Hunted lions are shown
suffering, reeling and agonizing,

00:29:11.530 --> 00:29:19.110
but one lioness, defiant
even while succumbing

00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:21.630
to arrows penetrating her body.

00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:25.590
No artist in antiquity had every
reached the artistic standard

00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:30.750
that the Assyrians had so
brilliantly achieved in art.

00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:37.300
Artists also portrayed people
hunting wild animals and bulls

00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:41.340
as a scene in some
delightful scenes.

00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:45.790
The military and hunting activities
were also painted on walls

00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:49.530
with vivid colors and
gracious lines.

00:29:49.530 --> 00:29:55.280
They survive in a few Assyrian
provincial cities of Syria.

00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:59.170
The paintings reflect the ability
of the Assyrian artists to work

00:29:59.170 --> 00:30:06.280
with pigments and drawings
creating charming sceneries.

00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:09.750
Ivory works-- a great number of
ivory objects were [inaudible]

00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:14.730
in Assyria especially in
the capital Kalhu, Nimrud.

00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:17.890
While the art of these
objects betrays Egyptian

00:30:17.890 --> 00:30:25.040
and Syrian influences some objects
exhibit Mesopotamian motives.

00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:27.730
Since the Assyrians were brilliant

00:30:27.730 --> 00:30:32.370
in art some ivory works
must have been produced

00:30:32.370 --> 00:30:35.180
by Assyrian craftsman in Assyria.

00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:39.260
One can admire what I call
the Assyrian Mona Lisa

00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:45.820
with her subtle smile the
[inaudible] looking lady

00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:54.240
at the window, and the truly
delightful cow suckling her calf

00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:58.510
while turning her head towards
the latter in affection.

00:30:58.510 --> 00:31:04.650
Even if these works may not
be Assyrian they tell much

00:31:04.650 --> 00:31:09.940 position:56%
about the finesse and charm of their
owners since the Assyrian used them

00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:12.480
to ornate their chairs,
beds, thrones

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:15.810
and other pieces of furniture.

00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:24.810
Lastly, jewelry work-- in producing
jewelry the Assyrians reached

00:31:24.810 --> 00:31:27.020
such a professional standard

00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:32.080
that not even our modern
machines can reach.

00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:33.980
And I'm not exaggerating.

00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:40.270
A cache of jewels was uncovered in
Nimrud in 1989 in a royal grave,

00:31:40.270 --> 00:31:45.530
and it is so stunning that the King
Tut's treasures looks quite pale

00:31:45.530 --> 00:31:48.010
in comparison with it.

00:31:48.010 --> 00:31:51.680
The treasure of Nimrud
includes pairs of earrings

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:55.680
with hanging bells,
pomegranate-shaped pendants,

00:31:55.680 --> 00:32:02.600 position:56%
solid gold bracelets, pairs of cuffs
made of heavy gold, bangles, anklets

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:08.630
and the truly unique
and splendid headbands.

00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:15.760
The headband is made of fine-woven
herringbone-patterned gold strands,

00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:21.260
and consists of six gold
ribbons connected by hinges

00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:26.720
with five discs each inlaid
around a precious stone,

00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:32.860
and a rectangular plaque decorated
with rosettes around its edges.

00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:37.460
The plaque is inlaid with
two square precious stones

00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:43.330
and with tassels attached
to its lower edge.

00:32:43.330 --> 00:32:49.560
The gold necklace is made
of a tube [inaudible]

00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:54.370
with alternating vertical
and horizontal wavy lines.

00:32:54.370 --> 00:32:59.880
Twenty-eight almond-shaped pendants
are suspended around the tube

00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:03.640
by a gold wire passing
through rings.

00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:08.440
Its clasp is made of two
entwined dragon's heads

00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:13.670
and Mesopotamian motif that
continue to be seen in the art

00:33:13.670 --> 00:33:17.850
of medieval churches
in the north of Iraq.

00:33:17.850 --> 00:33:22.050
One would add four gold bowls.

00:33:22.050 --> 00:33:26.380
Two of which inscribed with
names of Assyrian queens.

00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:32.560
In producing these gold vessels the
Assyrian goldsmith imitated bowls

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:35.780
made of exceptionally thin walls,

00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:39.180
called by archaeologists
palace ware,

00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:42.000
that is abundantly found in Nimrud.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:48.680
In conclusion, Assyrian artists
added elegance to an empire known

00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:52.790
for its military prowess and
its administrative regal.

00:33:52.790 --> 00:33:54.590
Thank you.

00:33:54.590 --> 00:34:08.040
[ Clapping ]

00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:09.340
&gt;&gt; Mary Jane Deeb: Thank
you, Professor Harrak.

00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:14.570
That was really beautiful
and inspiring.

00:34:14.570 --> 00:34:16.270
And now we're going

00:34:16.270 --> 00:34:21.340
to have Professor Woods who's
Associate Professor of Sumerology

00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:28.900
in the Oriental Institute of
the University of Chicago,

00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:33.640
and whose paper, there's a change
in the title from what you have,

00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:41.460
it's going to be on Gilgamesh in
its ancient and modern context.

00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:48.280 position:56%
Professor Woods teaches in the
Oriental Institute in the Department

00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:52.120
of Middle Eastern Languages and
Civilization, and the Program

00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:57.410
in the Ancient Mediterranean World
of the University of Chicago.

00:34:57.410 --> 00:35:02.830
He received his bachelor's degree
from Yale University and his Ph.D.

00:35:02.830 --> 00:35:06.450
in Assyriology from
Harvard University.

00:35:06.450 --> 00:35:09.070
He was a Junior Fellow
in the Harvard Society

00:35:09.070 --> 00:35:11.030
of Fellows before joining
the faculty

00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:13.120
of the University of Chicago.

00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:17.260
His research interests include
Sumerian writing and language,

00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:20.600
as well as early Mesopotamian
religion,

00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:23.620
literature and administration.

00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:28.470
He is currently completing two
monographs including one entitled

00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:33.910
"Gilgamesh in Sumerian Literary
Tradition" for the SBL Series

00:35:33.910 --> 00:35:38.110
in Writing of the Ancient World,
which will provide new translations

00:35:38.110 --> 00:35:43.780 position:56%
and commentary for the six Gilgamesh
[inaudible] preserved in Sumerian.

00:35:43.780 --> 00:35:46.080
So, Professor Woods?

00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:55.340
[ Clapping ]

00:35:55.340 --> 00:35:57.730
&gt;&gt; Christopher Woods:
So, this is [inaudible].

00:35:57.730 --> 00:36:00.440
So, I'd like to thank
the organizers,

00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:05.620 position:56%
particularly Eden [inaudible], for
the invitation to speak on Gilgamesh

00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:10.660 position:56%
at this first ever conference on the
Assyrian legacy here at the Library

00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:14.680
of Congress in this
really impressive building.

00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:17.090
It's a great honor
for me to be here.

00:36:17.090 --> 00:36:21.640
So, as the wonderful
introduction just mentioned,

00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:25.300
what I'd like to do today is speak
about the history and context

00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:30.340
of the Epic of Gilgamesh, and
concluding with a focus on the role

00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:33.620
of two prominent Assyrians
in this story--

00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:40.460 position:56%
one its greatest patron in antiquity
and the other its modern discoverer.

00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:44.470
But first what is the
Epic of Gilgamesh about?

00:36:44.470 --> 00:36:47.500
Well, it's human mortality
and the fear

00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:49.740
of death are the principle themes.

00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:55.100
The death of Gilgamesh's
companion, Enkidu, after a series

00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:58.980
of shared adventures
sets Gilgamesh on a quest

00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:02.760
to meet the immortal survivor
of the flood, Utnapishtim,

00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:07.590
the Mesopotamian Noah, to learn
the secret of immortality.

00:37:07.590 --> 00:37:11.520
It's a quest, of course, in
which he ultimately fails,

00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:16.130
but acquires a great deal
of wisdom in the process.

00:37:16.130 --> 00:37:19.710
So, the epic is about the
acquisition of self-knowledge,

00:37:19.710 --> 00:37:23.660
as well as the divinely-ordained
scheme of things,

00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:26.230
a wisdom that the gods
gave to humans

00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:31.930
in the antediluvian age before the
flood, but was lost with the flood.

00:37:31.930 --> 00:37:37.170
We of course celebrate Gilgamesh
as the first masterpiece

00:37:37.170 --> 00:37:39.230
of world literature
and, certainly today,

00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:42.770
it's the best known
Mesopotamian composition.

00:37:42.770 --> 00:37:44.450
But what we often overlook is

00:37:44.450 --> 00:37:50.090
that Gilgamesh also had a
substantial following in antiquity,

00:37:50.090 --> 00:37:53.320
to judge by its wide
circulation and longevity

00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:56.860
and artistic representation,
it enjoyed popularity

00:37:56.860 --> 00:37:58.950
in the ancient world as well.

00:37:58.950 --> 00:38:03.660
The major themes of the epic
resonate with us just as much

00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:05.780
as they did with the ancients.

00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:11.250
And this is what gives the epic
its universal and timeless appeal.

00:38:11.250 --> 00:38:18.400 position:56%
And here you have an example of a
first millennium B.C. cylinder seal.

00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:24.080
It depicts Gilgamesh and Enkidu
dispatching the Bull of Heaven

00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:28.730
as its recounted in
tablet six of the epic.

00:38:28.730 --> 00:38:33.630
Here is a relief of a
hero, it's not definite,

00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:37.290
but many people have
wanted to identify

00:38:37.290 --> 00:38:39.760
with Gilgamesh overpowering a lion.

00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:42.800
This is from the throne
room of Sargon II.

00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:46.680
And at the very least it recalls
a passage from the beginning

00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:51.780 position:56%
of tablet nine of the Epic of
Gilgamesh where Gilgamesh distraught

00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:56.740 position:56%
after the death of Enkidu reverts to
this primitive state becoming a sort

00:38:56.740 --> 00:39:04.410
of child of nature before beginning
his quest to seek out Utnapishtim.

00:39:04.410 --> 00:39:09.450
In the epic, of course,
we have Humbaba,

00:39:09.450 --> 00:39:12.000
who's the protector
of the Cedar Forest.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.500
He's decapitated by Enkidu.

00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:18.410
And we have a great variety
of mask-like representations

00:39:18.410 --> 00:39:21.890
from Mesopotamian depicting the
head of Humbaba that were used

00:39:21.890 --> 00:39:25.480
as probably protective amulets,
and these have also survived

00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:28.360
in the archaeological record.

00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:30.310
Well, images from the epic,

00:39:30.310 --> 00:39:33.470
particularly those involving
Humbaba, these were very ,

00:39:33.470 --> 00:39:37.090
very popular, they liked this part
of the story a lot, and is slang

00:39:37.090 --> 00:39:41.210
or found really far and wide in
Mesopotamia, again a testament

00:39:41.210 --> 00:39:43.980
to the epic in antiquity
and its popularity.

00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:47.110
We have here this piece from
the Old Babylonian Period,

00:39:47.110 --> 00:39:51.090
from the second millennium
B.C., another piece all the way

00:39:51.090 --> 00:39:58.470
up from the Anatolian capital in
Turkey, and even in Southeast Iran.

00:39:58.470 --> 00:40:02.970
Now, Gilgamesh is at
present a damaged

00:40:02.970 --> 00:40:06.580
and only partially
complete masterpiece.

00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:11.250
What you see here are some of the
largest fragments of the epic.

00:40:11.250 --> 00:40:15.700
As many of you no doubt know it's
written in the cuneiform script

00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:18.140
and it represents standard
Babylonian.

00:40:18.140 --> 00:40:20.070
That's the canonical version of it.

00:40:20.070 --> 00:40:23.090
This is a dialect of
Akkadian, a Semitic language.

00:40:23.090 --> 00:40:28.660 position:56%
And these bits and pieces have to be
assembled in a jigsaw-like puzzle.

00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:32.240
Unfortunately, only
2,000 of the 3,000 lines

00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:33.950
of the epic are preserved,

00:40:33.950 --> 00:40:38.690
but because Mesopotamian literary
texts were copied and recopied

00:40:38.690 --> 00:40:41.520
as scribal exercises
there's hope that more,

00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:48.120
and perhaps eventually the entire
epic, may one day be recovered.

00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:51.880
Now, when we speak of the history
of Gilgamesh it's really a story

00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:57.570
that centers around three
Mesopotamian cities-- Uruk, Ur--

00:40:57.570 --> 00:41:01.270
not to be confused with
Uruk-- and Nineveh.

00:41:01.270 --> 00:41:05.120
Now, Gilgamesh hailed from
the city state of Uruk.

00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:07.170
He was the King of Uruk.

00:41:07.170 --> 00:41:09.590
And Uruk is a very special place.

00:41:09.590 --> 00:41:15.160
It emerges at the end of the fourth
millennium B.C., or 34, 3,500,

00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:18.940
as the world's first
city, first metropolis.

00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:23.230
And it's the place where writing is
first invented in all likelihood.

00:41:23.230 --> 00:41:27.340 position:56%
Now, Gilgamesh didn't rule at that
point in time, but he ruled probably

00:41:27.340 --> 00:41:33.490
about five, six, 700 years
later, around 27, 2,800 B.C. So,

00:41:33.490 --> 00:41:37.230
about easily 500 years after
the invention of writing, but,

00:41:37.230 --> 00:41:41.610
unfortunately, just before or
just on the cusp of history

00:41:41.610 --> 00:41:44.170
when we had the first
historical texts.

00:41:44.170 --> 00:41:46.950
So, often people ask was
Gilgamesh a real person.

00:41:46.950 --> 00:41:49.880
Well, we don't know for sure
because we have no texts

00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:54.000
that we can relate directly to him,
but they're good reasons to assume

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:58.580
that there is a real person
behind the actual legend.

00:41:58.580 --> 00:42:04.230
Now, Ur, on the other hand, was the
seat of a very important dynasty

00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:05.930
at the end of the third millennium.

00:42:05.930 --> 00:42:08.350
So, now we're fast
forwarding again another five,

00:42:08.350 --> 00:42:12.510
600 years down to 2100 B.C.,
and this dynasty was known

00:42:12.510 --> 00:42:16.560
as the third dynasty of
Ur or the Ur III Period.

00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:20.290
Now, the kings of Ur claimed
a very special bond with Urok.

00:42:20.290 --> 00:42:23.280
And they commissioned several
stories about Gilgamesh

00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:26.280
in the Sumerian language,
which is completely unrelated

00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:29.310
to standard Babylonian.

00:42:29.310 --> 00:42:34.180
Nineveh, in this story, now we fast
forward again another 1,500 years,

00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:39.450
was as we heard the capital of the
vast Assyrian empire Ashurbanipal,

00:42:39.450 --> 00:42:44.590 position:56%
we just heard much about, was one
of the greatest Mesopotamian rulers.

00:42:44.590 --> 00:42:48.220
He ruled his empire from Nineveh
in the seventh century B.C.,

00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:51.370
and he's famous for his
military exploits, of course,

00:42:51.370 --> 00:42:54.450
but he was also something
of a renaissance man,

00:42:54.450 --> 00:42:58.450
and one of the few Mesopotamian
monarchs to claim literacy.

00:42:58.450 --> 00:43:01.770
At his capital Nineveh
he established one

00:43:01.770 --> 00:43:06.840 position:56%
of the great libraries of antiquity,
the Library of Ashurbanipal.

00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:10.550
And it's from this library that
we have the best preserved copies

00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:13.150
of the Epic of Gilgamesh.

00:43:13.150 --> 00:43:20.290 position:56%
So, our story begins at Ur around
2100 B.C. during this Ur III Period.

00:43:20.290 --> 00:43:24.280
Now, as I'd mentioned, the rulers
of Ur claimed a special bond

00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:27.760
with the early Urok rulers,
particularly with Gilgamesh,

00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:31.580
even though these rulers
of Urok preceded them

00:43:31.580 --> 00:43:34.670
by a good five, 600 years.

00:43:34.670 --> 00:43:38.940
But at Ur they saw Urok at
the time of Gilgamesh as sort

00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:43.580 position:56%
of a heroic Sumerian golden age,
and they saw themselves as the heirs

00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:47.060
and stewards of this
ancient tradition.

00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:50.930
The Ur III kings sought to
legitimize their own rule

00:43:50.930 --> 00:43:57.710
by constantly connecting themselves
with Urok and its bygone rulers,

00:43:57.710 --> 00:44:00.340
and with Gilgamesh in particular.

00:44:00.340 --> 00:44:07.050
The dynasty's greatest
ruler was Shulgi,

00:44:07.050 --> 00:44:10.830
who consolidated the
incipient empire

00:44:10.830 --> 00:44:12.800
that he inherited from his father.

00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:18.270
Shulgi, who frequently referred
to himself as Brother Friend

00:44:18.270 --> 00:44:23.090
of Gilgamesh, was like Ashurbanipal
some 1,500 years later, literate

00:44:23.090 --> 00:44:27.350
and had a special penchant
for learning.

00:44:28.450 --> 00:44:33.300
So, it comes as no surprise
that given the spirit

00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:39.300
of the Ur III Period generally, and
Shulgi's inclinations for education

00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:42.450
in particular, that it was
during this period that a cycle

00:44:42.450 --> 00:44:44.940
of poems celebrating Gilgamesh

00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:49.390
and his exploits was first
committed to writing.

00:44:49.390 --> 00:44:53.910
And no doubt these stories drew
upon longstanding oral traditions

00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:57.150
that must have been in
circulation since the days

00:44:57.150 --> 00:44:59.280
of the first dynasty of Urok.

00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:05.400
So, there are actually five
primary Sumerian Gilgamesh stories.

00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:09.960
Now, likely these poems were
composed to be performed

00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:12.600
at court before Shulgi and others.

00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:14.620
And perhaps they were set to music.

00:45:14.620 --> 00:45:18.600
But these stories have a very
laconic abrupt style suggesting

00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:21.100
that they were probably
abbreviations

00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:23.690
of traditional oral compositions.

00:45:23.690 --> 00:45:27.490
One possible purpose for writing
down of these poems may have been

00:45:27.490 --> 00:45:29.320
for training singers

00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:33.520
and for preserving the
outline of an oral performance.

00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:37.920
So, what was the historical
development of Gilgamesh?

00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:39.970
Well, it needs to be pointed

00:45:39.970 --> 00:45:45.020 position:56%
out that these Sumerian stories they
share a broad theme of Gilgamesh,

00:45:45.020 --> 00:45:47.420
but they're largely
disconnected from one another.

00:45:47.420 --> 00:45:52.590
There's no such thing as
a Sumerian Gilgamesh Epic.

00:45:52.590 --> 00:45:56.510
It was only in the
Old Babylonian Period

00:45:56.510 --> 00:45:59.150
with the first Akkadian
version of Gilgamesh

00:45:59.150 --> 00:46:02.630
that we have the first
true Epic of Gilgamesh.

00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:05.930
And this is the Old Babylonian
version of the Epic of Gilgamesh.

00:46:05.930 --> 00:46:09.220
And what this represents
it pulled together all

00:46:09.220 --> 00:46:12.460
of these Sumerian sources, it
added a lot more that wasn't

00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:16.520
in the original Sumerian stories,
had no counterpart in them,

00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:19.770
and it brought it together
into sort of a coherent whole.

00:46:19.770 --> 00:46:23.570
Now, the Old Babylonian version
of Gilgamesh is far from complete,

00:46:23.570 --> 00:46:26.880
but it's a poem of
tremendous beauty and power.

00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:31.110
And the opening line of this
story, and it's served as the title

00:46:31.110 --> 00:46:34.360
for compositions in antiquity,
the first line was the title,

00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:39.160
is translated as the one
who is greatest among kings.

00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:43.420
And this is really a very apt title
because the poem is really a hymn

00:46:43.420 --> 00:46:47.080
to heroism in knightly might.

00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:50.190
Now, in the Middle
Babylonian Period,

00:46:50.190 --> 00:46:53.490
so that we're fast forwarding
now to the second half

00:46:53.490 --> 00:46:57.900
of the second millennium,
so, 1600 to 1000 B.C.,

00:46:57.900 --> 00:47:01.540
Gilgamesh spreads throughout
the ancient Near East

00:47:01.540 --> 00:47:05.510
as Akkadian becomes the lingua
franca of the Near East,

00:47:05.510 --> 00:47:09.070 position:56%
it spreads to Northern
Mesopotamia, it spreads to Anatolia,

00:47:09.070 --> 00:47:13.270
and it takes on various
versions and translations.

00:47:13.270 --> 00:47:19.100
What happens then around 1300
to 1000 is very important,

00:47:19.100 --> 00:47:22.940
because then what we have now is
the canonization of Gilgamesh.

00:47:22.940 --> 00:47:25.310
We have all of these
disparate versions.

00:47:25.310 --> 00:47:29.360
And then at the end of the second
millennium the story is eventually

00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:32.520
canonized, and it's written
in the literary dialect,

00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:35.440
standard Babylonian that
was actually never spoken.

00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:38.080
And when you go and you
buy the Epic of Gilgamesh

00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:41.760
at a bookstore what you're
reading is this canonical version

00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:46.970
that was written at this period.

00:47:46.970 --> 00:47:50.250
Now, this story, the canonical
version of the Epic of Gilgamesh,

00:47:50.250 --> 00:47:54.790
is attributed by ancient sources
to a scribe, an [inaudible],

00:47:54.790 --> 00:47:59.410 position:56%
by the name of Sin-leqi-unninni, who
may have been the principle editor

00:47:59.410 --> 00:48:02.870
of the text, who pulled together
all of this ancient material

00:48:02.870 --> 00:48:08.390
and crafted this one
canonical version perhaps.

00:48:08.390 --> 00:48:11.680
It's a very different story
than the one that we have

00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:14.760
in the Old Babylonian Period,
and, again, the very first line

00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:17.120
of the story reflects this.

00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:20.240
The standard Babylonian
version places emphasis

00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:24.220
on Gilgamesh's acquisition
of wisdom and self-knowledge

00:48:24.220 --> 00:48:29.070
through hard experience
and personal suffering.

00:48:29.070 --> 00:48:33.180
It's a somber reflection,
a less confident

00:48:33.180 --> 00:48:35.500
and more introspective story.

00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:39.780
And, again, you see this in the
first line-- he who saw the deep,

00:48:39.780 --> 00:48:41.490
the foundations, of the land--

00:48:41.490 --> 00:48:46.970
which contrast very nicely with
the earlier Old Babylonian title.

00:48:46.970 --> 00:48:49.690
Now, one of the things
we're interested

00:48:49.690 --> 00:48:53.300
in is how Sin-leqi-unninni,
if we can trust

00:48:53.300 --> 00:48:56.230
that ancient attribution,
changed the epic.

00:48:56.230 --> 00:49:00.380
So, in addition to shaping and
refocusing the theme and mood

00:49:00.380 --> 00:49:02.480
of the epic he, or another,

00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:07.790
made a number of concrete
changes that we can identify.

00:49:07.790 --> 00:49:11.900 position:56%
For instance, we have this beautiful
sweeping prologue at the beginning

00:49:11.900 --> 00:49:15.990
of the epic that portrays it as
the autobiography of Gilgamesh.

00:49:15.990 --> 00:49:18.370
This didn't exist in
earlier versions.

00:49:18.370 --> 00:49:21.920
The transformation of Enkidu,
who plays a very minor role

00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:25.560
in the early Sumerian
stories, and now he's elevated

00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:29.130
to Gilgamesh's counterpart,
and sort of his alter ego.

00:49:29.130 --> 00:49:33.850
And we have the addition of
the final tablet of the epic,

00:49:33.850 --> 00:49:37.590
this mysterious tablet 12,
which is really an appendix

00:49:37.590 --> 00:49:41.410
to the 11-tablet epic, and it's
a literal translation of one

00:49:41.410 --> 00:49:43.640
of these earlier Sumerian stories--

00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:45.230
Gilgamesh, Enkidu and
the netherworld.

00:49:45.230 --> 00:49:48.380
And he did this as a show
probably of scholarly erudition

00:49:48.380 --> 00:49:54.630
to underscore the mortality
theme of the epic.

00:49:54.630 --> 00:49:58.280
More generally, Sin-leqi-unninni's
conceptualization

00:49:58.280 --> 00:50:02.360
of the epic is reflected in the
very structure of the narrative.

00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:06.150
The travels of Gilgamesh come
to encapsulate the known world

00:50:06.150 --> 00:50:10.070
and are symbolic of the
universality of the epic.

00:50:10.070 --> 00:50:13.940 position:56%
That is the sort of all-encompassing
theme of the epic is reflected

00:50:13.940 --> 00:50:17.420
in the physical action of
the narrative with Urok,

00:50:17.420 --> 00:50:21.480
the city par excellence, serving
as the anchor and focal point.

00:50:21.480 --> 00:50:25.320
The first half of the epic,
tablets three through five,

00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:28.910
are really an adventure
story out west.

00:50:28.910 --> 00:50:33.160
Right? Their travels are all done
in the western part of Mesopotamia

00:50:33.160 --> 00:50:35.070
at the Near Eastern world.

00:50:35.070 --> 00:50:39.660
The second half is a search
for this antediluvian wisdom,

00:50:39.660 --> 00:50:43.550
the wisdom of Utnapishtim
in the mythical east.

00:50:43.550 --> 00:50:47.780
So, what I would like to devote
the remainder of this talk to,

00:50:47.780 --> 00:50:51.550
and conclude with, is the
discovery of Gilgamesh

00:50:51.550 --> 00:50:54.630 position:56%
after it was lost for two millennia.

00:50:54.630 --> 00:50:56.930
The event, as I'd mentioned
at the outset,

00:50:56.930 --> 00:51:01.470
is bookended by two Assyrians--
one ancient and one modern.

00:51:01.470 --> 00:51:03.850
And I've already mentioned,
we've heard mention already,

00:51:03.850 --> 00:51:08.010
of the great seventh-century
Assyrian King Ashurbanipal

00:51:08.010 --> 00:51:12.500
and his famous library at
the capital of Nineveh.

00:51:12.500 --> 00:51:18.980
Ashurbanipal, as I mentioned, was
known for his claims to literacy

00:51:18.980 --> 00:51:22.230
and his love of learning, and
you can see him boasting about it

00:51:22.230 --> 00:51:28.710
in this quote, and of
course his famous library.

00:51:28.710 --> 00:51:33.440
Now, the library, actually
you have here is a letter

00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:36.310
from Ashurbanipal asking his agents

00:51:36.310 --> 00:51:38.940
to collect materials
for the library.

00:51:38.940 --> 00:51:43.520 position:56%
The library actually began
modestly with texts involving omens.

00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:47.150
But eventually it grew to
at least 25,000 tablets.

00:51:47.150 --> 00:51:50.130
You can see he's went far and
wide to collect this material.

00:51:50.130 --> 00:51:55.320
It included literary compositions
and other records of all kinds,

00:51:55.320 --> 00:51:58.970
and included multiple copies
of the Epic of Gilgamesh.

00:51:58.970 --> 00:52:02.600
There are probably at least four
copies of the Epic of Gilgamesh

00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:07.320
in Ashurbanipal's library, and
that, in fact, is our main source

00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:10.170
for the epic comes
from this library.

00:52:10.170 --> 00:52:14.230
When Nineveh fell in 612
B.C. the royal palace,

00:52:14.230 --> 00:52:15.850 position:56%
and with it the library, were burnt.

00:52:15.850 --> 00:52:18.550
The library rooms collapsed
to the foundations

00:52:18.550 --> 00:52:22.160
of the building sending
25,000 tablets plunging

00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:25.950
into the palace foundations, and
they rested there undisturbed

00:52:25.950 --> 00:52:28.970
for two and a half thousand years.

00:52:28.970 --> 00:52:32.560
Now, fast forward to the
middle of the 19th century

00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:35.970
and we had the birth of ancient
Near Eastern archaeology.

00:52:35.970 --> 00:52:37.730
And a few things are
happening at this point.

00:52:37.730 --> 00:52:42.330 position:56%
We had the decipherment of cuneiform
by Rollinson and others, the French

00:52:42.330 --> 00:52:45.650
and British, often in
competition with one another,

00:52:45.650 --> 00:52:49.270
begin excavating Assyrian capitals
which were known for mentions

00:52:49.270 --> 00:52:51.970
in the bible and classical sources.

00:52:51.970 --> 00:52:55.990
But our interests lie in
the pioneering excavations

00:52:55.990 --> 00:52:59.710
of Nineveh [inaudible]
by Austen Henry Layard

00:52:59.710 --> 00:53:02.240
in the mid-19th century.

00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:07.450 position:56%
Now, he was primarily, at this point
these were really treasure seekers.

00:53:07.450 --> 00:53:09.540
Right? They're interested
in sculpture

00:53:09.540 --> 00:53:13.590
and these were shipped back to
the British Museum including,

00:53:13.590 --> 00:53:17.830
you can see here these, well,
we just heard about a lot

00:53:17.830 --> 00:53:20.000
about [inaudible] were shipped
back to the British Museum,

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:24.990
and they also incidentally
found some tablets as well.

00:53:24.990 --> 00:53:28.830
Layard finds these were a
sensation in the United Kingdom.

00:53:28.830 --> 00:53:30.220
You could see them moving one

00:53:30.220 --> 00:53:32.320
of these [inaudible]
into the British Museum.

00:53:32.320 --> 00:53:37.220
There's a caricature of Layard
as writing on one of these bowls

00:53:37.220 --> 00:53:39.640
when he started his
political career.

00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:45.520
Some of these drawings were
actually made by Layard.

00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:46.820
He was an artist.

00:53:46.820 --> 00:53:49.950
You can see him here in the
lower-left image actually drawing.

00:53:49.950 --> 00:53:53.920
These were very destructive
archaeologic treasure-hunting

00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:58.620
operations and very destructive
tunneling at Nineveh and Corsiva

00:53:58.620 --> 00:54:01.880
that they engaged in
to find these things.

00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:05.200
It was just how archaeology
was done at the time.

00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:08.360
But Layard actually
didn't work alone.

00:54:08.360 --> 00:54:10.270
He had an assistant who would go

00:54:10.270 --> 00:54:14.160
on to become his archaeological
successor, Hormuzd Rassam,

00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:17.580
who would play a critical role
in Near Eastern archaeology,

00:54:17.580 --> 00:54:20.730
and is really one of
its unsung heroes.

00:54:20.730 --> 00:54:24.950
Rassam was an ethnic Assyrian born
in Mosul, a Chaldean Christian.

00:54:24.950 --> 00:54:30.480
He was actually hired by
Layard as a paymaster in 1845.

00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:35.630
Layard was highly impressed with
Rassam, and he became something

00:54:35.630 --> 00:54:38.810
of a father figure to Rassam,
and the two remained friends

00:54:38.810 --> 00:54:42.190
for the next 50 years
until Layard's death.

00:54:42.190 --> 00:54:45.910
Eventually Rassam would
succeed Layard

00:54:45.910 --> 00:54:48.440
and the British Museum
entrusted Rassam

00:54:48.440 --> 00:54:51.360
with heading its excavations
in Iraq.

00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:55.750
Now, the field work was
conducted between 1852 and 54

00:54:55.750 --> 00:55:00.080
where Rassam really made a number
of astonishing discoveries.

00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:05.680 position:56%
In fact, it was Rassam, not Layard,
who excavated Ashurbanipal's library

00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:10.070
and palace, and discovered
all the tablets that would go

00:55:10.070 --> 00:55:11.580
on to make the nucleus

00:55:11.580 --> 00:55:14.630
of the British Museum's
fantastic tablet collection.

00:55:14.630 --> 00:55:18.850
And so it was Rassam who actually
discovered the Epic of Gilgamesh.

00:55:18.850 --> 00:55:23.800
Here you see two portraits of
Rassam that he sat for at the age

00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:28.700 position:56%
of 25 just before he became Director
of the British Museum excavations,

00:55:28.700 --> 00:55:33.650
and they really contrast
the Middle Eastern

00:55:33.650 --> 00:55:38.730 position:56%
and European dress symbolizes really
the ambivalence in Rassam's life.

00:55:38.730 --> 00:55:42.980
He belonged to both worlds in
name, but in reality, in the end,

00:55:42.980 --> 00:55:45.790
unfortunately, to neither.

00:55:45.790 --> 00:55:50.030
Now, Rassam's fortunes changed
for the worse once he returned

00:55:50.030 --> 00:55:54.890
to England where he found that
in the press his colleagues

00:55:54.890 --> 00:55:58.850
in the fields and at the British
Museum were either claiming his

00:55:58.850 --> 00:56:00.630
discoveries for themselves,

00:56:00.630 --> 00:56:02.860
or crediting his accomplishments
to others.

00:56:02.860 --> 00:56:05.820
And really this was an
issue of cultural prejudice

00:56:05.820 --> 00:56:07.980
in Victorian England
where many couldn't accept

00:56:07.980 --> 00:56:11.580
that a Middle Easterner had
made contributions of this kind.

00:56:11.580 --> 00:56:14.550
He was often described, for
instance, as a digger with Layard

00:56:14.550 --> 00:56:16.700
as the brains behind the operation.

00:56:16.700 --> 00:56:21.350
And this prejudice was to
plague him the rest of his life

00:56:21.350 --> 00:56:27.270 position:56%
after a disastrous stint in politics
Rassam resumed his archaeological

00:56:27.270 --> 00:56:30.100
career later in life, and
he made more important finds

00:56:30.100 --> 00:56:31.400
at Balwat in Sipar.

00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:35.550
However, he entered into a very
public dispute with this man

00:56:35.550 --> 00:56:39.200
in the lower right, Budge
of the British Museum,

00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:42.060
who actually accused him
of stealing artifacts.

00:56:42.060 --> 00:56:44.170
There was no evidence
for this, of course.

00:56:44.170 --> 00:56:49.610
Rassam sued Budge for slander
in a very famous lawsuit in 1893

00:56:49.610 --> 00:56:53.130
that was a sensation in the
U.K. covered by the press.

00:56:53.130 --> 00:56:56.890
He won the lawsuit, but was
awarded almost nothing in damages.

00:56:56.890 --> 00:57:00.260
He retired in Brighton
in debt, embittered,

00:57:00.260 --> 00:57:01.980
embarrassed and largely forgotten.

00:57:01.980 --> 00:57:06.230
But the field has, however, been
kinder to him in recent years.

00:57:06.230 --> 00:57:09.450
And there's been a real
effort to restore Rassam

00:57:09.450 --> 00:57:11.610
and his position in the field.

00:57:11.610 --> 00:57:15.890
Now, as for the Epic of Gilgamesh
itself after it was discovered,

00:57:15.890 --> 00:57:19.650
we have to fast forward 20
years from Rassam's discovery

00:57:19.650 --> 00:57:22.320
of Ashurbanipal's library.

00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:24.940
You have to remember,
or know, that Layard

00:57:24.940 --> 00:57:28.670
and Rassam couldn't read
the tablets that they found.

00:57:28.670 --> 00:57:32.340
Right? The decipherment of
Akkadian was in its infancy.

00:57:32.340 --> 00:57:39.340 position:56%
Enter a genius by the name of George
Smith from a working class family,

00:57:39.340 --> 00:57:44.550
limited formal education, but
fascinated with biblical history

00:57:44.550 --> 00:57:48.270
and the sensational Assyrian finds
that were being made at the time.

00:57:48.270 --> 00:57:51.630
He spent his lunch hours at
the British Museum training

00:57:51.630 --> 00:57:55.740
under Rollinson, who was one of the
principle decipherers of Akkadian

00:57:55.740 --> 00:57:57.690
and the father of Assyriology.

00:57:57.690 --> 00:58:01.000
George eventually got a
position at the British Museum,

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:03.810
and began looking through
this vast tablet collection

00:58:03.810 --> 00:58:07.180
for a sensational tablet
that would make him a star,

00:58:07.180 --> 00:58:09.370
and make a big splash in the world.

00:58:09.370 --> 00:58:12.760
It took him five years to find
it sifting through these tablets,

00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:17.150
but in 1872 he found it, sorting
through the thousands of tablets

00:58:17.150 --> 00:58:19.430
in Ashurbanipal's library.

00:58:19.430 --> 00:58:23.980 position:56%
He found the best preserved
manuscript of tablet 11 of Gilgamesh

00:58:23.980 --> 00:58:27.630
which just so happens
recounts the flood.

00:58:27.630 --> 00:58:31.130
And this was an absolutely
sensational find

00:58:31.130 --> 00:58:34.400
as it not only corroborated
the biblical account

00:58:34.400 --> 00:58:36.470
of the flood, but it predated it.

00:58:36.470 --> 00:58:38.780
And, so, it showed
that a major episode

00:58:38.780 --> 00:58:42.780
of genesis had earlier
Mesopotamian origins.

00:58:42.780 --> 00:58:45.460
You can see here in
this quote from Budge--

00:58:45.460 --> 00:58:49.250
Rollinson's reaction upon
finding the tablet where he sort

00:58:49.250 --> 00:58:52.660
of took his clothes off in
a state of great excitement.

00:58:52.660 --> 00:58:55.750
Some people now actually think he
was suffering an epileptic fit, so,

00:58:55.750 --> 00:59:00.650
maybe is a different spin on this.

00:59:00.650 --> 00:59:08.730
To conclude, Smith presented his
findings at a very public meeting

00:59:08.730 --> 00:59:10.880
at the Society of Biblical
Archaeology

00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:14.100
where even Prime Minister
Gladstone was in attendance.

00:59:14.100 --> 00:59:15.800
It made international news.

00:59:15.800 --> 00:59:17.620
Actually you can see it here.

00:59:17.620 --> 00:59:22.470 position:56%
The Daily Telegraph was so impressed
with Smith's famous lecture

00:59:22.470 --> 00:59:25.130
on the flood that they
actually funded him to go back

00:59:25.130 --> 00:59:30.000
to Rassam's old trenches to find
missing pieces of the flood story.

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:33.170
And that's really an incredible
thing to ask if you're familiar

00:59:33.170 --> 00:59:35.770
with these things because it's
like literally finding a needle

00:59:35.770 --> 00:59:39.140
in a haystack, finding
another bit of a tablet.

00:59:39.140 --> 00:59:42.830
But actually he succeeded in part.

00:59:42.830 --> 00:59:46.140
He found a portion of a
text that wasn't Gilgamesh,

00:59:46.140 --> 00:59:49.080
but a related text, but it
filled an important gap.

00:59:49.080 --> 00:59:53.630
This was a sensational
success for the Daily Telegraph

00:59:53.630 --> 00:59:55.620
that was funding this excavation.

00:59:55.620 --> 00:59:57.590
They couldn't ask for
a better outcome.

00:59:57.590 --> 01:00:02.040
He found it like within the second
or third day of returning to Iraq.

01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:03.990
However, he was a victim
of his own success,

01:00:03.990 --> 01:00:06.310
because once they had the
tablet they were looking

01:00:06.310 --> 01:00:10.750
for they cancelled the
expedition in the end.

01:00:10.750 --> 01:00:17.980
So, George Smith, in 1876
on a return trip to Iraq,

01:00:17.980 --> 01:00:20.650
he fell ill in Aleppo
and, unfortunately,

01:00:20.650 --> 01:00:24.060
died at a very young age of 36,

01:00:24.060 --> 01:00:26.110
which brings us to
the end of our story.

01:00:26.110 --> 01:00:29.610
And I would just point
out some further reading

01:00:29.610 --> 01:00:33.260
if you're interested, if you
read the Epic of Gilgamesh,

01:00:33.260 --> 01:00:36.060
and I hope you all do or have,

01:00:36.060 --> 01:00:41.100
you should read the exceptional
translation of Andrew George.

01:00:41.100 --> 01:00:43.630
I think it's the only
one you should read.

01:00:43.630 --> 01:00:49.100 position:56%
And then there are a number of other
very nice books on Assyrian legacy.

01:00:49.100 --> 01:00:54.300
There's another one by Mogens
Trolle Larsen called "The Conquest

01:00:54.300 --> 01:00:56.660
of Assyria" which is excellent,
but I think, unfortunately,

01:00:56.660 --> 01:00:59.670
out of print and very expensive.

01:00:59.670 --> 01:01:01.900
There's "Empires of the Plain"

01:01:01.900 --> 01:01:04.450
which recounts the
early pioneering efforts

01:01:04.450 --> 01:01:07.730 position:56%
of ancient Near Eastern archaeology.

01:01:07.730 --> 01:01:11.410
And "The Buried Book" is a book
about Gilgamesh, and it recounts

01:01:11.410 --> 01:01:16.530
in very nice detail the era
of Rollinson and Rassam,

01:01:16.530 --> 01:01:22.220
and the sort of fascinating
story that was their lives.

01:01:22.220 --> 01:01:24.510
Thank you very much.

01:01:24.510 --> 01:01:37.600
[ Clapping ]

01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:38.900
&gt;&gt; Mary Jane Deeb: Thank
you, Professor Woods,

01:01:38.900 --> 01:01:43.070
and for those who have read
Gilgamesh it's definitely

01:01:43.070 --> 01:01:44.370
an inspiration.

01:01:44.370 --> 01:01:45.670
Go back to it.

01:01:45.670 --> 01:01:47.480
Thank you.

01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:51.600
So, now we have Professor Simo
Parpola, Professor Emeritus

01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:54.530
of Assyriology at the
University of Helsinki.

01:01:54.530 --> 01:01:57.720
He specializes in the
new Assyrian Empire.

01:01:57.720 --> 01:02:02.060
His research interests encompass
all aspects of Assyrian language,

01:02:02.060 --> 01:02:05.880
culture and history,
especially Assyrian religion,

01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:08.550
royal ideology and sciences.

01:02:08.550 --> 01:02:11.850
The Melammu Project,
which he initiated,

01:02:11.850 --> 01:02:15.960
investigates the continuity,
transformation and diffusion

01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:20.420
of Assyrian and Babylonian culture
throughout the ancient world.

01:02:20.420 --> 01:02:23.670
In addition to his academic
activities Professor Parpola has

01:02:23.670 --> 01:02:25.890
also worked for the
benefit of oppressed

01:02:25.890 --> 01:02:31.050
and persecuted modern Assyrians,
and is co-founder and chairman

01:02:31.050 --> 01:02:34.450
of the Finland Assyria Association.

01:02:34.450 --> 01:02:36.510
Professor Parpola?

01:02:36.510 --> 01:02:44.280
[ Clapping ]

01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:46.570
&gt;&gt; Simo Parpola: Ladies
and gentlemen.

01:02:46.570 --> 01:02:48.400
Assyria is known from the bible

01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:53.860 position:56%
as a great military power oppressing
the Near East for centuries,

01:02:53.860 --> 01:02:55.600
only to be utterly destroyed

01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:59.470
and wiped off the face
of the Earth in the end.

01:02:59.470 --> 01:03:03.020
This notion of Assyria
is still very common,

01:03:03.020 --> 01:03:06.760
but it is misleading and wrong.

01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:12.120
The Assyrian Empire was much more
than just a cold military power.

01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:16.810
And when it fell it by no
means meant the end of Assyria

01:03:16.810 --> 01:03:21.510
and Assyrians, nor
the end of the empire.

01:03:21.510 --> 01:03:27.310
I have planned my talk so that
we will begin with having a look

01:03:27.310 --> 01:03:31.910
at what happened to Assyria and
Assyrians after the fall of Empire

01:03:31.910 --> 01:03:36.210
and then continue with a
look at the organization

01:03:36.210 --> 01:03:40.160
of the Empire at its heyday.

01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:44.860
We will see that the ideological
and administrative structures

01:03:44.860 --> 01:03:51.120
and methods needed to keep
everything going did not disappear,

01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:56.370
but remained in place even
after the fall of Assyria.

01:03:56.370 --> 01:03:59.110
They were as vital
to the functioning

01:03:59.110 --> 01:04:04.420
of all subsequent empires
as they had been to Assyria.

01:04:04.420 --> 01:04:11.210 position:56%
And thus came to have a profound and
lasting impact on the afterworld,

01:04:11.210 --> 01:04:14.930
both in the west and the east.

01:04:14.930 --> 01:04:22.790
The Assyrian Empire was the
United States of its time.

01:04:22.790 --> 01:04:29.100
It was a large multi-ethnic
scientific

01:04:29.100 --> 01:04:32.600
and technologically-advanced
country,

01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:36.870
and certainly the most
powerful country

01:04:36.870 --> 01:04:42.780
in the Eastern Mediterranean
and the Near East.

01:04:42.780 --> 01:04:51.240
Like the United States
it had been born,

01:04:51.240 --> 01:05:01.070
it grew from humble
beginnings by conquest.

01:05:01.070 --> 01:05:07.840
But through a very
efficient and effective policy

01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:15.960
of integration it was
able to unify the country

01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:25.500 position:56%
to a homogenous foe sharing a common
language, the imperial Aramaic,

01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:31.560
which was sort of the
equivalent of American English,

01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:37.810
which was spoken all over the
empire by people who had long

01:05:37.810 --> 01:05:45.920
since forgotten their ethnic
origins and shared values, religion

01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:47.370
and ideology of the empire.

01:05:47.370 --> 01:05:54.480
Even the ruling class,
which traced its origins

01:05:54.480 --> 01:06:00.690
in the Old Akkadian Empire
of the third millennial B.C.

01:06:00.690 --> 01:06:09.110
and spoke mainly Assyrian,
was totally bilingual.

01:06:09.110 --> 01:06:14.810
And probably some of
the elite who were

01:06:14.810 --> 01:06:22.960
of other ethnic origins also
shared the ideas of the empire.

01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:36.460
This is very important to keep in
mind when we look at what happened

01:06:36.460 --> 01:06:38.760
after the fall of Assyria.

01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:48.450
Well, you already have seen
pictures of the Assyrian Empire.

01:06:48.450 --> 01:06:52.600 position:56%
What we have here is just the extent

01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:59.800
of Assyria's provincial
administration.

01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:09.790
Actually Assyria was considered
a bit larger if you count

01:07:09.790 --> 01:07:18.380
in the vessel states, such as Lydia
and Phrygia in the Anatolia area

01:07:18.380 --> 01:07:27.200
and Urartu, now Armenia,
to the north of Assyria.

01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:35.610
In fact, Assyria's indirect
influence extended much farther

01:07:35.610 --> 01:07:45.010
than the [inaudible] area until
the [inaudible] Peninsula,

01:07:45.010 --> 01:07:51.580
that is to say now Spain,
because the Finnishians,

01:07:51.580 --> 01:07:58.270
who were experienced
vessels, acted for Assyrians

01:07:58.270 --> 01:08:03.880
in their commercial enterprises
and for [inaudible] silver mines

01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:08.410
in Spain, which were
important to the empire.

01:08:08.410 --> 01:08:20.720
Now, Assyria fell, as we have
heard, when Nineveh was destroyed

01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:29.780
in 612 B.C. as a result of a long
power struggle among the ruling

01:08:29.780 --> 01:08:36.500
elite which started with two sons
of Ashurbanipal fighting for power,

01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:45.780
and then ended up involving the
whole ruling elite including

01:08:45.780 --> 01:08:52.070
Assyrian governors in
Southern Babylonia and Media.

01:08:52.070 --> 01:09:06.020
In 612 Nineveh was [inaudible]
and razed to the ground,

01:09:06.020 --> 01:09:10.020
and the country was
divided into two parts--

01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:17.260
the Medes, who actually carried
out the destruction of Nineveh,

01:09:17.260 --> 01:09:28.530
carried away all the parts of the
governments that they were not able

01:09:28.530 --> 01:09:39.000
to escape from the city, and
deported much know-how not only

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.070
from Ninevah, but also
from [inaudible]

01:09:41.070 --> 01:09:47.110
to their capital [inaudible]
in Western Iran.

01:09:47.110 --> 01:09:52.260
The Babylonians, under
the leadership

01:09:52.260 --> 01:09:58.790
of [inaudible] took the
western part of the empire,

01:09:58.790 --> 01:10:09.200
including Assyrian areas in
[inaudible] and Anatolia.

01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:16.640
So, it's important to remember
here that the actual seat

01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:21.250
of Assyrian government
remained on the Median side,

01:10:21.250 --> 01:10:26.070
and thus the Medes were able
to claim universal kinship.

01:10:26.070 --> 01:10:29.340
[inaudible] this appear
as heirs to the Assyrians,

01:10:29.340 --> 01:10:38.220 position:56%
whereas the Babylonians, who in fact
were just part of the old empire,

01:10:38.220 --> 01:10:46.000
could only claim the kinship of
Babylon because they were not

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:51.040
on the scene when Assyria fell.

01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:57.310
Apart from the shift of the
power to [inaudible] and Babylon,

01:10:57.310 --> 01:11:04.380
and the liquidation of much
of the Assyrian abilities,

01:11:04.380 --> 01:11:10.610
nothing much happened elsewhere
otherwise in the empire.

01:11:10.610 --> 01:11:18.090
Life went on as it had been,
and both the Babylonians,

01:11:18.090 --> 01:11:20.090
and especially the Babylonians,

01:11:20.090 --> 01:11:27.410 position:56%
pursued the Assyrian policies before
the fall including, for instance,

01:11:27.410 --> 01:11:31.620
the deportations as we know
very well from the bible.

01:11:31.620 --> 01:11:42.790
So, here we have a map of the
new division of the empire.

01:11:42.790 --> 01:11:47.020
I must point out here that
the areas controlled by Media,

01:11:47.020 --> 01:11:51.310
which are much larger than
actually Assyria ever controlled,

01:11:51.310 --> 01:11:56.990
they are more loosely organized
than in the Assyrian Empire,

01:11:56.990 --> 01:12:04.870
and consisted of all sorts
of tributary arrangements

01:12:04.870 --> 01:12:10.370
between the Medes and
other Median tribes.

01:12:10.370 --> 01:12:15.670
Some have even contested
that a Median, its empire,

01:12:15.670 --> 01:12:22.790
actually ever existed, but I
believe there was an empire.

01:12:22.790 --> 01:12:31.570
And, in fact, it was very much
Assyrian, probably not only

01:12:31.570 --> 01:12:35.420
in organization, but also
in its habits as we'll learn

01:12:35.420 --> 01:12:39.890
from later historiographers.

01:12:41.930 --> 01:12:57.430
Well, some 70 years after Assyria's
fall both Media and Babylonia,

01:12:57.430 --> 01:13:05.220
near Babylonia, an empire came
under control of Cyrus the Great,

01:13:05.220 --> 01:13:07.230
who now became [inaudible]

01:13:07.230 --> 01:13:16.920
of all the countries
earlier ruled by Assyria.

01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:31.310 position:56%
It's incredible, but this
[inaudible] of time that had elapsed

01:13:31.310 --> 01:13:36.980
since the fall of Assyria
the Persians under Cyrus

01:13:36.980 --> 01:13:42.880
and his followers proved to be
even more faithful followers

01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:49.980
than Babylonians and Medes before
them of Assyrian practices.

01:13:49.980 --> 01:13:56.380
The former Assyrian area was
preserved under its former name,

01:13:56.380 --> 01:14:01.520
Athura, actually in the
form of four [inaudible],

01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:07.960
but actually only one [inaudible]
controlled by the same family,

01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:16.490
which had ruled it under
the Babylonian kinship.

01:14:16.490 --> 01:14:22.710
And the Median half
also was combined

01:14:22.710 --> 01:14:27.580
into four [inaudible]
consisting of Media, [inaudible]

01:14:27.580 --> 01:14:33.490 position:56%
and then Cyrus' home country Persia.

01:14:33.490 --> 01:14:41.090
Aramaic continued its
position as lingua franca.

01:14:41.090 --> 01:14:46.880
Assyrian practices and
manners [inaudible] everywhere.

01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:56.140 position:56%
And we have, for instance, the
great historical records [inaudible]

01:14:56.140 --> 01:15:06.920
witness descriptions of the life
in the sort of the [inaudible]

01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:16.930
which really shows how
unchanged everything went on.

01:15:16.930 --> 01:15:29.980
Here is the provincial division
of the Median Empire Assyria along

01:15:29.980 --> 01:15:36.410
with Abar-Nahara, which is the old
Assyrian Eber-Nari, the designation

01:15:36.410 --> 01:15:39.050
for the Transeuphratene provinces.

01:15:39.050 --> 01:15:45.370
And here's a telling example

01:15:45.370 --> 01:15:53.910
of how it certainly unfaithfully
the Persian kings followed the

01:15:53.910 --> 01:15:57.990
Assyrian model.

01:15:57.990 --> 01:16:02.610
These are two depictions
of the royal origins

01:16:02.610 --> 01:16:04.430
at the New Year's festival.

01:16:04.430 --> 01:16:09.380
One from [inaudible] in
Assyria to the left, 740 B.C.,

01:16:09.380 --> 01:16:17.120
and the second is the Persian King
[inaudible] seated on the throne

01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:20.660
in [inaudible] 230 years later.

01:16:20.660 --> 01:16:29.530
The only thing here that really
differs is that some [inaudible]

01:16:29.530 --> 01:16:35.630
in the throne, but we have similar
representations of Assyrian throne,

01:16:35.630 --> 01:16:38.270
also from Assyria, and the fact

01:16:38.270 --> 01:16:42.760
that the Persians despite
the destruction brought

01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:44.540
in Nineveh were able

01:16:44.540 --> 01:16:46.950
to so faithfully copy
Assyria's [inaudible].

01:16:46.950 --> 01:16:54.170
Its [inaudible] by the fact that
it was the Assyrian sculptures

01:16:54.170 --> 01:17:01.020
who actually executed these
reliefs for the Persians as is told

01:17:01.020 --> 01:17:04.290
in the Persian inscriptions also.

01:17:04.290 --> 01:17:08.100
And we have also [inaudible]
documents

01:17:08.100 --> 01:17:11.880
from [inaudible] recording
the payments made

01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:14.240
by the Assyrian artists.

01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:20.170
Now, after Alexander
the Great's defeat

01:17:20.170 --> 01:17:37.420
of the [inaudible] he established a
far-flung empire, as you all know,

01:17:37.420 --> 01:17:44.270
which extended far to India,
but this did not last long

01:17:44.270 --> 01:17:53.530
since Alexander died soon, and
it was divided by his generals

01:17:53.530 --> 01:17:57.390
who each started to
compete for power

01:17:57.390 --> 01:17:59.880
and establish their own empires.

01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:03.360
The most successful of his
followers was [inaudible]

01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:10.850
who in fact reestablished
Assyria again,

01:18:10.850 --> 01:18:23.080
and the area of the [inaudible]
Empire, here as you can see,

01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:31.460
[inaudible] points to the
throne of Persian Empire.

01:18:31.460 --> 01:18:37.550
Its administrative center
was originally in Babylonia

01:18:37.550 --> 01:18:42.060
in a city founded by [inaudible]
quite close to Babylon,

01:18:42.060 --> 01:18:46.550
and later on in Syria,
Syria [inaudible].

01:18:46.550 --> 01:18:56.290 position:56%
So, you see that just like Alexander
had made his empire's capital

01:18:56.290 --> 01:19:02.280 position:56%
Babylon the [inaudible] also
continued this habit, and the weight

01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:09.970 position:56%
of the empire was really in the west
[inaudible] Assyrian central areas.

01:19:09.970 --> 01:19:19.440
The Macedonians who helped power
soon they're very much [inaudible].

01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:26.310
And it's quite clear that some
of them started speaking Aramaic,

01:19:26.310 --> 01:19:29.560
which remained the
official language.

01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:37.440
And even though they perpetuated
Hellenistic customs and art forms,

01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:43.250
they also favored [inaudible]
with the Mesopotamia culture.

01:19:43.250 --> 01:19:49.870
At this time we are still
[inaudible] from libraries

01:19:49.870 --> 01:19:53.810
in Babylonia, so the
historical knowledge

01:19:53.810 --> 01:20:03.010
of Mesopotamia was preserved,
and also the Mesopotamians

01:20:03.010 --> 01:20:11.320
and Assyrians made their culture
known to the priests in the form

01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:27.050
of a history written by the
Priest [inaudible] in 280.

01:20:28.730 --> 01:20:35.100
Then finally [inaudible] about
Mesopotamia and Roman rule.

01:20:35.100 --> 01:20:43.140
What is important to keep
in mind is that at the time

01:20:43.140 --> 01:20:49.280
when Romans entered the scene the
[inaudible] Empire had been started

01:20:49.280 --> 01:20:57.740
to dwindle under the
attacks of the Parthenons

01:20:57.740 --> 01:21:05.700 position:56%
and actually comprised only at this
time the areas of present day Syria.

01:21:05.700 --> 01:21:07.320
And when it was [inaudible]

01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:14.720
by Rome it became the Roman
province of Syria in this extent.

01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:21.700
In the other areas of former
Mesopotamia some areas had become

01:21:21.700 --> 01:21:25.430
semi-independent kingdoms
under the Parthenons.

01:21:25.430 --> 01:21:34.450
For instance, [inaudible] in
Syria and [inaudible] in the east

01:21:34.450 --> 01:21:46.150
in the area where we have
nowadays [inaudible], for instance.

01:21:46.150 --> 01:21:51.680
When Roman prosecution
was changed from republic

01:21:51.680 --> 01:21:59.280
into dictatorship there
started an influx

01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:06.000
of Oriental influence
into the Roman court.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:15.400
And already from the
first Roman emperors

01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:24.390
on there were several Syrian
or Mesopotamian advisors

01:22:24.390 --> 01:22:29.360
in the Roman court
[inaudible] and [inaudible].

01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:40.340 position:56%
These were astrologers, but they
continued as advisors of the emperor

01:22:40.340 --> 01:22:46.210
as in Mesopotamia before.

01:22:49.150 --> 01:22:58.770
Despite all appearances all
Mesopotamian cultural traditions

01:22:58.770 --> 01:23:05.900
continued still in Syria now
called [inaudible] Province,

01:23:05.900 --> 01:23:12.610
and we have several ancient
live descriptions of life there,

01:23:12.610 --> 01:23:16.350
for instance, by Lucian who calls
himself by Assyrian [inaudible],

01:23:16.350 --> 01:23:21.790
the author of the first
theorate order Aramaic,

01:23:21.790 --> 01:23:24.380
[inaudible] who claims
he was born in Assyria

01:23:24.380 --> 01:23:30.990
and despises the three culture
[inaudible] the Greeks have

01:23:30.990 --> 01:23:35.160
inherited everything
from the Assyrians.

01:23:35.160 --> 01:23:40.930
Until this point Hellenistic Roman
[inaudible] had not distinguished

01:23:40.930 --> 01:23:48.100
between Syria and Assyria,
but from the point

01:23:48.100 --> 01:23:53.980
that Assyria became a Roman
province the name Syria,

01:23:53.980 --> 01:23:57.980
which is actually only an
abbreviation of Assyria,

01:23:57.980 --> 01:24:03.290 position:56%
became to denote justice [inaudible]
area while the Assyria started

01:24:03.290 --> 01:24:05.080
to be applied to the former empire.

01:24:05.080 --> 01:24:11.260
Here is an example of the
cultural continuity in Roman Syria.

01:24:11.260 --> 01:24:15.180
We have here Assyrian priests
[inaudible] officiating

01:24:15.180 --> 01:24:19.860
in [inaudible] in 50 B.C. the same
[inaudible] Syrian [inaudible]

01:24:19.860 --> 01:24:24.080
and still bearing the
same sort of [inaudible]

01:24:24.080 --> 01:24:31.010
as the Assyrian priests
700 years earlier.

01:24:31.010 --> 01:24:36.330
Well, the Assyrians had on
the formerly Median side

01:24:36.330 --> 01:24:41.720 position:56%
of the [inaudible] still remained
outside of the Roman Province Syria,

01:24:41.720 --> 01:24:57.260 position:56%
because the Romans thought that it
did not pay off and [inaudible] far,

01:24:57.260 --> 01:25:04.840
but they were shortly an annexed by
the Romans, first by train and then

01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:08.330
by the [inaudible], who
established in Rome a dynasty

01:25:08.330 --> 01:25:10.120
that really transferred the center

01:25:10.120 --> 01:25:15.860
of the Roman Empire
from Rome to the east.

01:25:15.860 --> 01:25:26.230
And under this emperor started the
development that eventually led

01:25:26.230 --> 01:25:38.440
to the division of the Roman
Empire into Eastern Roman part,

01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:42.350
and transformed the
[inaudible] culture to very close

01:25:42.350 --> 01:25:47.740
to the old Assyrian
heritage in religious terms.

01:25:47.740 --> 01:25:59.500
But on the other hand these
influences also were transmitted

01:25:59.500 --> 01:26:04.700 position:56%
to the west through the Roman Empire

01:26:04.700 --> 01:26:11.030
and the establishment
of Christianity in Rome.

Okay, now, let's move to considering
the Assyrian state [inaudible].

01:26:18.630 --> 01:26:27.350
I will go through-- yes,
well, I'm afraid I will have

01:26:27.350 --> 01:26:34.080
to skip my presentation
because I wasted too much time

01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:37.220
on the preservation of Assyrian
identity in post-empire times,

01:26:37.220 --> 01:26:40.180
but I consider that a
very important point

01:26:41.420 --> 01:26:51.860
because it shows how everything
that we find as Assyrian influence

01:26:51.860 --> 01:26:57.910
in later times was not due
to borrowing or, let's say,

01:26:57.910 --> 01:27:00.740
not intimate contact with Assyria,

01:27:00.740 --> 01:27:06.790
but really through a historical
development where everything passed

01:27:06.790 --> 01:27:15.560
on structurally and naturally
to the later generations.

01:27:15.560 --> 01:27:25.010
I will now just shortly show
you the remaining slides

01:27:25.010 --> 01:27:32.090
that I have prepared.

01:27:32.090 --> 01:27:59.160
Unfortunately, the time
does not permit to discuss.

01:28:30.100 --> 01:28:32.010
So, is my time out?

01:28:32.010 --> 01:28:33.320
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

01:28:33.320 --> 01:28:36.190
Completely.

01:28:36.190 --> 01:28:38.490
Okay.

01:28:48.040 --> 01:28:50.970
Well, as you can see there
should have been stuff

01:28:50.970 --> 01:28:54.730
for a much longer talk.

01:28:54.730 --> 01:28:58.290
Here at this point
I just have to say

01:28:58.290 --> 01:29:06.010
that these Assyrian art motifs
are to be seen everywhere nowadays

01:29:06.010 --> 01:29:09.600
and the last centuries
official buildings.

01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:14.190
For example, also here, the
[inaudible] and the [inaudible].

01:29:14.190 --> 01:29:17.510
Thank you very much.

01:29:17.510 --> 01:29:27.040
[ Clapping ]

01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:30.120
&gt;&gt; Mary Jane Deeb: Thank you
very much, Professor Parpola.

01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:34.010
And now we have a few
minutes for questions.

01:29:34.010 --> 01:29:43.510 position:56%
So, if you please address the
issues that the speakers brought up.

01:29:43.510 --> 01:29:46.510
Okay? Yes, Professor Eden?

01:29:46.510 --> 01:29:50.230
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

01:29:50.230 --> 01:29:54.460
&gt;&gt; I'd like to return to Gilgamesh,
if I may please, Professor Woods.

01:29:54.460 --> 01:29:58.470
I was wondering about two things.

01:29:58.470 --> 01:30:03.950
Whether when the language
changed from Akkadian to Aramaic,

01:30:03.950 --> 01:30:06.530
and Akkadian was no longer spoken

01:30:06.530 --> 01:30:11.950
as you said was Gilgamesh
read off in Aramaic?

01:30:11.950 --> 01:30:17.510
Because reading off was rather a
tradition of the ancient world.

01:30:17.510 --> 01:30:21.620
&gt;&gt; Christopher Woods: Yeah, I think
this is partly a question for Simo,

01:30:21.620 --> 01:30:27.370 position:56%
but sometime in the first millennium
B.C. there's a switch from Akkadian

01:30:27.370 --> 01:30:33.200
to Aramaic, but Gilgamesh, as I
mentioned, was originally written

01:30:33.200 --> 01:30:38.730
in Sumerian, then the first
actual Akkadian epic that we know

01:30:38.730 --> 01:30:44.680
of was written in Old Babylonian,
but then the canonical version

01:30:44.680 --> 01:30:50.280
of Gilgamesh was written in a
dialect called standard Babylonian,

01:30:50.280 --> 01:30:52.150
which was just a literary dialect.

01:30:52.150 --> 01:30:53.450
No one actually spoke it.

01:30:53.450 --> 01:30:56.930
It was based on Old Babylonian.

01:30:56.930 --> 01:30:58.540
It had Old Babylonian forms.

01:30:58.540 --> 01:31:02.440
And it was a literary language.

01:31:02.440 --> 01:31:05.690
And once it was canonized
and written

01:31:05.690 --> 01:31:10.220
in the standard Babylonian version
that became the set version of it.

01:31:10.220 --> 01:31:15.170
So, there's not evidence
of an Aramaic Gilgamesh.

01:31:15.170 --> 01:31:19.720
The question of the
legacy of Gilgamesh

01:31:19.720 --> 01:31:23.250
in the post-[inaudible]
world is a fascinating one,

01:31:23.250 --> 01:31:28.410 position:56%
one that we don't have a lot of
evidence for, but it shows up, well,

01:31:28.410 --> 01:31:35.590
Gilgamesh and Huwawa show up in
"The Book of Giants," they show

01:31:35.590 --> 01:31:39.660
up in some early Arabic
incantations,

01:31:39.660 --> 01:31:45.020
and probably Gilgamesh
played an important role

01:31:45.020 --> 01:31:47.800
in shaping The Alexander Romance.

01:31:47.800 --> 01:31:53.900
It may even show up in parts of the
1,001 Nights, elements, influences,

01:31:53.900 --> 01:32:01.970 position:56%
but as a story, as an epic, it was
just written in standard Babylonian.

01:32:01.970 --> 01:32:03.890
&gt;&gt; Simo Parpola: Well,
I wanted to add

01:32:03.890 --> 01:32:10.200
that if I remember correctly
there's also an Aramaic fragment

01:32:10.200 --> 01:32:11.500
from [inaudible].

01:32:11.500 --> 01:32:12.800
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

01:32:12.800 --> 01:32:14.100
Mentioning [inaudible].

01:32:14.100 --> 01:32:17.000
&gt;&gt; Christopher Woods:
Yeah, and this is "The Book

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:18.950
of Giants" that I had mentioned.

01:32:18.950 --> 01:32:21.640
And, so, they're mentioned.

01:32:21.640 --> 01:32:26.040
So, Gilgamesh and Huwawa
are mentioned as giants.

01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:29.710
In fact, that tradition
from [inaudible] goes back

01:32:29.710 --> 01:32:31.290
to the actual Epic of Gilgamesh

01:32:31.290 --> 01:32:34.830
where Gilgamesh is described
as a giant essentially.

01:32:34.830 --> 01:32:39.370
But that mention of Gilgamesh
and Huwawa is isolated.

01:32:39.370 --> 01:32:42.700
It has nothing to do with the
story of the Epic of Gilgamesh.

01:32:42.700 --> 01:32:45.380
They're just mentioned
as two possible giants.

01:32:45.380 --> 01:32:46.680
And this tradition that you see

01:32:46.680 --> 01:32:49.740
in the [inaudible] also
makes its way into Arabic.

01:32:49.740 --> 01:32:52.760
And they actually become
sort of demonic figures.

01:32:52.760 --> 01:32:58.720
So, there's a memory of them,
but the actual story is lost.

01:32:58.720 --> 01:33:00.030
So, they're mentioned in Arabic,

01:33:00.030 --> 01:33:03.690
but there's no Aramaic
version of Gilgamesh.

01:33:03.690 --> 01:33:04.990
&gt;&gt; Mary Jane Deeb: Yes?

01:33:04.990 --> 01:33:14.130
&gt;&gt; I wonder if you could address it
a little more about the influence

01:33:14.130 --> 01:33:17.220
of Gilgamesh on the bible.

01:33:17.220 --> 01:33:21.060
You mentioned, you know, the
flood myth, but also I wonder

01:33:21.060 --> 01:33:24.470
if you could briefly touch on
what other influences it had

01:33:24.470 --> 01:33:26.380
on the bible, and did
it have any influence

01:33:26.380 --> 01:33:29.580
on Roman literature,
Latin literature?

01:33:29.580 --> 01:33:33.940
&gt;&gt; Christopher Woods: Well,
yeah, there is a mention,

01:33:33.940 --> 01:33:39.110
there's a very interesting,
it's very difficult to nail

01:33:39.110 --> 01:33:41.040
down the actual influences.

01:33:41.040 --> 01:33:44.670
So, even if you take something like
the flood story that doesn't come

01:33:44.670 --> 01:33:48.270
from Gilgamesh, it comes from
another story called [inaudible],

01:33:48.270 --> 01:33:52.800
and there was even a
Sumerian flood story,

01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:57.210
but it is in the story
[inaudible] and [inaudible] deals

01:33:57.210 --> 01:34:02.030
with the Mesopotamian Noah,
and the early versions

01:34:02.030 --> 01:34:07.700 position:56%
of Gilgamesh don't include the flood
narrative, although interestingly,

01:34:07.700 --> 01:34:10.900
in the Sumerian story
there's a reference.

01:34:10.900 --> 01:34:15.190
One of the earlier Sumerians
there's a reference to Utnapishtim,

01:34:15.190 --> 01:34:18.530
so they are always
somehow linked together.

01:34:18.530 --> 01:34:22.250
But that really is a
separate tradition.

01:34:22.250 --> 01:34:26.210
That's almost grafted or fleshed
out in the [inaudible] Epic

01:34:26.210 --> 01:34:30.630
of Gilgamesh, and that
obviously makes it way directly

01:34:30.630 --> 01:34:31.930
into the bible.

01:34:31.930 --> 01:34:35.780
But Gilgamesh, as a story,
it would be very hard

01:34:35.780 --> 01:34:41.130
to actually prove a direct
link between Gilgamesh

01:34:41.130 --> 01:34:44.890
and biblical accounts
outside of the flood story.

01:34:44.890 --> 01:34:52.340
As for classical literature
there is a mention of Gilgamesh

01:34:52.340 --> 01:35:03.760
in a little small sort of almost
anecdotal story of [inaudible]

01:35:03.760 --> 01:35:09.860
where he sort of [inaudible]
Gilgamesh with another king,

01:35:09.860 --> 01:35:12.360
[inaudible], and a bunch of
others, and it has nothing to do

01:35:12.360 --> 01:35:15.540
with the Epic of Gilgamesh, but
it's really just the name is frozen

01:35:15.540 --> 01:35:16.840
in there.

01:35:16.840 --> 01:35:18.210
And that's what you
get, more or less,

01:35:18.210 --> 01:35:20.260
are sort of mentions of the name.

01:35:20.260 --> 01:35:28.260
Really the primary, the best
evidence for Gilgamesh's influence

01:35:28.260 --> 01:35:33.250
on later classical literature would
have to be the Alexander Romance,

01:35:33.250 --> 01:35:38.640
because the parallels between and
the themes of these two stories are

01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:41.360
so remarkable when you read
them next to one another.

01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:43.530
The travel out east, the diving,

01:35:43.530 --> 01:35:47.850
the trying to transcend
human limitations,

01:35:47.850 --> 01:35:50.070
the fear of death, immortality.

01:35:50.070 --> 01:35:51.500
It's harder not to see a connection

01:35:51.500 --> 01:35:54.020
between the Greek Alexander
Romance and Gilgamesh.

01:35:54.020 --> 01:35:56.170
And they're two sort
of parallel figures.

01:35:56.170 --> 01:35:58.020
Right? Alexander goes
to the end of the world,

01:35:58.020 --> 01:36:03.060
conquers all the known world,
and wants to seek a type

01:36:03.060 --> 01:36:04.860
of immortality in doing so.

01:36:04.860 --> 01:36:07.540
Gilgamesh is a similar
type of figure

01:36:07.540 --> 01:36:11.450 position:56%
so you can see how then the ancients
sort of saw these two as analogous.

01:36:11.450 --> 01:36:16.120
And I think the Greek Alexander
Romance takes a lot of its cues,

01:36:16.120 --> 01:36:20.090
is modeled in large
part upon Gilgamesh,

01:36:20.090 --> 01:36:23.770
but really after that
it's very difficult

01:36:23.770 --> 01:36:26.890
to show definitive connections.

01:36:26.890 --> 01:36:28.190
&gt;&gt; Mary Jane Deeb: Okay.

01:36:28.190 --> 01:36:30.940
And I think there was one here.

01:36:30.940 --> 01:36:33.030
Yes?

01:36:33.030 --> 01:36:35.040
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:36.340
Okay, where is Candace?

01:36:36.340 --> 01:36:37.640
Just speak and then we [inaudible].

01:36:37.640 --> 01:36:40.680
&gt;&gt; My question is for
Professor Parpola and others.

01:36:40.680 --> 01:36:46.460 position:56%
We've heard a lot about the
Assyrians as dynasts and as monarchs

01:36:46.460 --> 01:36:50.450
and so forth, but who did they
rule in Northern Mesopotamia?

01:36:50.450 --> 01:36:52.380
Who were the Assyrian people?

01:36:52.380 --> 01:36:53.680
Were they nomads?

01:36:53.680 --> 01:36:55.450
Were they pastoralists?

01:36:55.450 --> 01:36:58.120
Were they tribally organized?

01:36:58.120 --> 01:37:01.600
Who were these people
in Northern Mesopotamia

01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:07.160
or Anatole or to the Mediterranean?

01:37:07.160 --> 01:37:15.550 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Simo Parpola: Well, the Assyrians
are one of the indigenous people

01:37:15.550 --> 01:37:21.020
of Mesopotamia who
are already attested

01:37:21.020 --> 01:37:23.890
in various sources,
Sumerian sources.

01:37:23.890 --> 01:37:31.030
So, the city of [inaudible] is
the old center of Assyrians,

01:37:31.030 --> 01:37:38.660
which was an important commercial
place in the third millennium B.C.

01:37:38.660 --> 01:37:46.540
And it became part of
the Old Akkadian Empire,

01:37:46.540 --> 01:37:53.280
and there was a governor of the
Akkadian Empire in that city.

01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:59.300
Later on after the collapse of
the Old Akkadian Empire the city

01:37:59.300 --> 01:38:04.850
of [inaudible] continued
its long-distance trade

01:38:04.850 --> 01:38:07.160
with Anatolia, for instance.

01:38:07.160 --> 01:38:19.890
And in the early 2000, about
1950 B.C., we see the rise

01:38:19.890 --> 01:38:25.790
of the first Assyrian kingdom

01:38:25.790 --> 01:38:30.390
that soon controlled large
parts of Northern Mesopotamia.

01:38:30.390 --> 01:38:33.230
So, they were not nomads
in the sense,

01:38:33.230 --> 01:38:36.050
but they were originally traders.

01:38:36.050 --> 01:38:41.820
And they carried out such a
lucrative trade with Anatolia

01:38:41.820 --> 01:38:46.380
because they monopolized, for
instance, the trade in tin,

01:38:46.380 --> 01:38:49.960
which was essential
for producing thrones.

01:38:49.960 --> 01:38:54.330
So, they became very
wealthy and very ambitious,

01:38:54.330 --> 01:39:00.640
and became empire builders.

01:39:00.640 --> 01:39:12.370
And the Old Assyrian Empire
collapsed quite roughly soon,

01:39:12.370 --> 01:39:22.430 position:56%
but in the so-called [inaudible] age
1300 before Christ we see the rise

01:39:22.430 --> 01:39:26.370
of the Middle Assyrian Empire,
which is really the same thing

01:39:26.370 --> 01:39:30.010
as the New Assyrian
Empire from which I talked.

01:39:30.010 --> 01:39:35.310
It dominated for 700 years
with little ups and downs,

01:39:35.310 --> 01:39:38.740
the political scene
in the Near East.

01:39:38.740 --> 01:39:45.150
Well, as I tried to explain
not very successfully,

01:39:45.150 --> 01:39:52.710
the citizens of the [inaudible]
Empire really collectively shared

01:39:52.710 --> 01:39:56.390
the Assyrian national
identity in addition

01:39:56.390 --> 01:40:02.060
to what ethnic memories they
may have had of their origins.

01:40:02.060 --> 01:40:08.130
But when Assyria collapsed this
national identity was changed

01:40:08.130 --> 01:40:15.040
into ethnic identity, because there
was no Assyrian Empire any longer.

01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:23.140
But the Assyrians insisted they
knew what they were, and the things

01:40:23.140 --> 01:40:26.390
that really connected them
was the language, and,

01:40:26.390 --> 01:40:28.380
of course, also their religion.

01:40:28.380 --> 01:40:32.380
I would have explained if I had
time that there are many elements

01:40:32.380 --> 01:40:36.290
in Christianity for instance
the [inaudible] doctrine

01:40:36.290 --> 01:40:38.700
that goes back to Assyria.

01:40:38.700 --> 01:40:47.080
Also the idea of Christ
as the savior of mankind.

01:40:47.080 --> 01:40:52.960
This is the role that the Assyrian
kings performed in the world.

01:40:52.960 --> 01:40:57.670
They were the incarnations
of [inaudible] say the son

01:40:57.670 --> 01:41:00.160
of the Supreme [inaudible].

01:41:00.160 --> 01:41:06.540
And also I would have talked
about the third element

01:41:06.540 --> 01:41:10.410
in Assyria religion, namely,
the belief in the Holy Ghost.

01:41:10.410 --> 01:41:14.770
But there was no time for it.

01:41:16.580 --> 01:41:21.330
Anyhow, so, when we talked about
Assyrians we have to distinguish

01:41:21.330 --> 01:41:26.130
between two things-- the
Assyrians of the time of the empire

01:41:26.130 --> 01:41:31.540
and then the Assyrians
that are the same people,

01:41:31.540 --> 01:41:36.100
but have a slightly different
identity to say despite the fact

01:41:36.100 --> 01:41:45.210
that Aramaic was also spoken
in Assyrian Empire, of course,

01:41:45.210 --> 01:41:50.480
the people usually identify
the old Syrians with Akkadians.

01:41:50.480 --> 01:41:53.120
But they were the same
as [inaudible],

01:41:53.120 --> 01:41:59.710
but they were Aramaic
[inaudible] mainly,

01:41:59.710 --> 01:42:02.480
and believed in more or
less the same things.

01:42:02.480 --> 01:42:03.880
&gt;&gt; Mary Jane Deeb:
Thank you very much.

01:42:03.880 --> 01:42:05.190
One more question.

01:42:05.190 --> 01:42:07.780
We have someone here, and
then we'll take a break.

01:42:07.780 --> 01:42:09.080
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:42:09.080 --> 01:42:13.540
My question is I understand they
were indigenous people, Assyrian,

01:42:13.540 --> 01:42:20.150
so they were not migrated from
any other places prehistorically

01:42:20.150 --> 01:42:22.640
like the Medes or [inaudible]
which they came

01:42:22.640 --> 01:42:26.140
from I think today's [inaudible]?

01:42:26.140 --> 01:42:27.440
&gt;&gt; Simo Parpola: No.

01:42:27.440 --> 01:42:29.660 position:56%
They were indigenous to Mesopotamia.

01:42:29.660 --> 01:42:33.930
For instance, the Arameans
which later gave their language

01:42:33.930 --> 01:42:42.940
to the whole empire were
originally inhabitants

01:42:42.940 --> 01:42:45.720
of [inaudible], [inaudible]
in Syria.

01:42:45.720 --> 01:42:52.410
And then at the end of the
seventh millennium B.C.

01:42:52.410 --> 01:42:59.200
when climatic conditions started
to [inaudible] there was a period

01:42:59.200 --> 01:43:03.580
of warming which meant fewer rains.

01:43:03.580 --> 01:43:07.750
These Arameans, who were
nomads and had multiplied

01:43:07.750 --> 01:43:13.820
under more favorable climatic
conditions, started to move

01:43:13.820 --> 01:43:18.270
from [inaudible] to other
parts of the Near East,

01:43:18.270 --> 01:43:21.870
spreading all over
the Assyrian Empire.

01:43:21.870 --> 01:43:25.740
That was the beginning
of the spread of Aramaic.

01:43:25.740 --> 01:43:31.970
But they are still part of the
historical ancient Near East.

01:43:31.970 --> 01:43:33.270
&gt;&gt; Mary Jane Deeb: Okay.

01:43:33.270 --> 01:43:34.570
Thank you.

01:43:34.570 --> 01:43:35.870
Thank you so much.

01:43:35.870 --> 01:43:37.170
Now we'll take a break
for 10 minutes.

01:43:37.170 --> 01:43:40.960
The books are there, but please
take no food inside, no food,

01:43:40.960 --> 01:43:45.270
no drinks in the Woodrow
Wilson, but please help yourself.

01:43:45.270 --> 01:43:48.700
Have a break and then we'll
start with the second panel.

01:43:48.700 --> 01:43:52.090
Okay? So, and thanks
again to the speakers.

01:43:52.090 --> 01:43:54.510
They've done a fabulous job.

01:43:54.510 --> 01:43:58.810
[ Clapping ]

01:43:58.810 --> 01:44:02.510
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
