Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience. What I think is interesting is that the continual buyers along that technological path is towards profit. You know, when we see those machines, the end point is always how do we make, how do we maximize profit? There is no like the influence of how do we do what's right. That's that sort of a a person like a sort of a general effort call. Uh, what do I want to say? Sort of code is not being introduced. There is no regulation. Like, you know, ultimately, you know, ultimately people will create the warrior monkeys or the most profitable machines people because the counter argument isn't being made. No one is like what I'm saying now it's making it there. There's just, there's no union of uh, you know, there's no sort of clear opinion of, hang on a minute, where could we be going? No, there is no body or ideology that's able to oppose the relentless march of capitalism.

Speaker 1:          00:59          I'm not sort of like a flower. Capitalism is bad. Here I am promoting a book using or an iPhone or you know what I mean? We're all swimming in it. Right? But what I'm saying is that if we acknowledge there are transcendent realms, there is information and data that exists beyond what we're able to receive with our senses. How are we going to incorporate that in the way we organize? Cause otherwise this off the magnetism, the Paul the g force of what's most profitable, what's going to continue to suit the uh, requirements of the powerful that will always, the bias will always fall in that direction. And it seems like where that's heading is certain kinds of ecological disaster, certain kinds of economic inequality, certain kinds of conflict, you know, and like we're not, one of them are, they're simple. Uh, uh, experiments that I apply is, you know, if we're, you know, if when people say, oh, what's wrong with the world world's I fucked all this polarity, I sometimes think, well who is benefiting from how it is now? Are there, is anyone benefiting? Are there any groups, institutions or individuals for whom this current state is beneficial? And if the answer to that question is yes, then look at who those institutions are. And they are most likely to a degree involved in establishing and maintaining these systems. And there are, you know, institutions and individuals and organizations that this works just fine for

Speaker 2:          02:16          they just capitalizing on it or are they organizing it and is a normal part of the way human beings operate with this constant desire for innovation, constant desire for improvement. We always want to push further. No, no one's comfortable where they are. They will always want to be in a better place. And this is almost like it's built into capitalism, right? I agree that this materialism, which is built into capitalism also is what fuels innovation because you want the newest iPhone so they have to design it and build it and make it, and when new things come out, like this new robot that apparently you're gonna hundred models, whatever that means. What that is is this is they're going to sell it. So there's like, it's fueling innovation. Someone else will come along and compete with Boston dynamics. Then there'll be, there'll be innovation wars. If these innovation wars weren't in place right now, our phones would look nothing like the iPhone 10 it just wouldn't, it wouldn't look like the Esx it would look like, who knows where it would look like. But there would be no, no incentive for them to compete against all these Samsung devices and Huawei devices and all that stuff is fueling this innovation. But it's all being fueled by capitalism.

Speaker 1:          03:22          You're quite right that that is the innovation is one of the benefits of the maintaining this system. But it seems to me that we are excluding other factors like that that recur throughout human cultures. We all have an idea of fairness of justice and yeah, I don't want some clunky, weird sort of eastern bloc phone made out of gray plastic. Only one button on it. Yeah. But like we have to I suppose, examine as a society and as individuals what is important to us now where I think, you know, we've talked, touched several times upon the fact that as an individual you're more likely to bias yourself towards negative information online. You know like we do have a degree of individual power and individual responsibility and I feel like if enough people awaken to the possibility of different narratives that the capitalist idea of innovation and success and progress that that all of these words can be examined.

Speaker 1:          04:20          What do you mean progress? That assumes a teleology, a purpose, a destination. If all time is happening at once, if space is infinite, like you know that bit of yours of light unit to try and fathom for a moment the limitlessness that were existing within, then all these things are constructs. This is a construct and it is good to have technology, but it's possible to like at points in times of crisis such as what it feels like we're at now. Now though that people have said, oh, we always feel that every generation thinks that they're the one because they know their own impending death is coming and they narrativize that into something social and global regardless. There's got to be a time where we start to introduce different ideas into our systems. It seems like there's room for that now because we do live in a toe, a truly global culture that there is the possibility for mono lifts to introduce new innovation and there is nothing that can oppose it or regulate it.

Speaker 1:          05:13          We started to see this kind of breakdown, so I'm interested in how we can individually prepare ourselves to organize society differently to be able to overcome pretty superficial differences like, oh you go hunting and I don't go hunt in. We ain't really gives a fuck. They start talking about how we can organize a size where people who go on and it'll don't go hunting can live peacefully in different ways. Not entirely governed by a small cabal. You know, and I'm sure plat power is more complex than that, that seem to be hugely biasing the direction of this so called program.

Speaker 2:          05:47          I think you answered your own previous questions when you're talking about whether or not you can be spiritual and funny and like what are you doing? Can you carve that path out for yourself? That what you're there by explaining that would influence people would give people a perspective that allows them to say, yeah, like why are we doing this and what is the purpose of this? And if enough people hear those words and have that perspective introduced to them, it'll change the way they interact with the world. And that changes the world. It really does. And that's one of the more powerful things about discussions when someone like you says something like that and it resonates with people and they start thinking like, why am I living like this? Like what if I'm only have, if I really do only have 50 years to live, why am I living these 50 years in some really unproductive bullshit way that's not satisfying at all? Cause I just want a bigger house. Like what is it? Do I want a faster car? Do I want to have expensive piece of jewelry? Like what is, what is the purpose of this path that I'm on now versus a path that I could be on? And what is the real conflict that we all experienced between each other? Is it? How much of it is due to a lack of communication? How much of is due to a lack of real listening and understanding.
