00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.840
The Amazing Audie Murphy

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.120
Audie Murphy was born on June 20, 1925 in
Texas.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.480
His family was extremely poor, partially due
to having twelve young mouths to feed.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.530
When his father abandoned the family when
Audie was fifteen years old, he was forced

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.470
to pick up some of the slack by hunting and
doing what work he could to keep food on the

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.470
table.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.840
Unfortunately, his mother died just a year
after his father left.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.520
Shortly thereafter, when the Japanese attacked
Pearl Harbor, Audie attempted to join the

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.310
various branches of the U.S. military but
was turned down in each case owing to his

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:36.719
age and diminutive stature -five and a half
feet tall (1.66 meters) and weighing only

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.670
about 100 pounds (45 kg).

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.850
About seven months later, just ten days after
he turned seventeen, he tried again.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:49.420
Having gained some weight (getting up to a
whopping 112 pounds / 50.8 kg) and with falsified

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.890
testimony from his sister claiming he was
actually 18, this time Audie was able to get

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:55.030
into the army.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.620
He was then shipped off to North Africa and
later deployed to Sicily.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.289
Despite his small size, Murphy proved to be
a phenomenal soldier.

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:07.410
In 1944, after witnessing the death of a friend
during Operation Dragoon, he charged a group

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.690
of German soldiers, took over their machine
guns and other weapons, and proceeded to take

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.540
out the other enemy soldiers within range
using their own artillery.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.330
He was awarded a Distinguished Service Cross
for his actions that day, the first of many

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:21.690
medals.

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.640
During another battle shortly after this,
to cover retreating Allied soldiers, he jumped

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.950
onto a tank that had been hit and was on fire,
exposing himself to the advancing enemy soldiers.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.931
Why did he put himself in such an exposed
position on a tank that could potentially

00:01:33.931 --> 00:01:34.931
explode at any minute?

00:01:34.931 --> 00:01:37.610
There was a .50 caliber machine gun on the
tank.

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.640
As Private Anthony Abramski said of the event,
“It was like standing on top of a time bomb

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.210
… he was standing on the TD chassis, exposed
to enemy fire from his ankles to his head

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.080
and silhouetted against the trees and the
snow behind him.”

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.490
Nevertheless, over the course of the next
hour, he held off six German tanks and several

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.390
waves of enemy soldiers, who were all trying
desperately to take out the little American

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.530
who was the only thing in their way at that
point.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.170
He only retreated when he ran out of ammo.

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.020
Once this happened, having sustained a leg
wound and completely exhausted, Audie said

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.459
in his book To Hell and Back,
“I slide off the tank destroyer and, without

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.819
once looking back, walk down the road through
the forest.

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.099
If the Germans want to shoot me, let them.

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:20.800
I am too weak from fear and exhaustion to
care.”

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.290
Despite the leg wound, as soon as he caught
up with his retreating soldiers who had now

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.510
re-formed, he turned them around and managed
to reclaim a stretch of forest from German

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:29.519
occupation.

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:33.840
According to the official report, in that
battle, he killed or severely wounding at

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.819
least fifty German soldiers by himself.

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:41.470
For this act of bravery and for “indomitable
courage and his refusal to give an inch of

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.930
ground [saving] his company from possible
encirclement and destruction…” he was

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.440
awarded the U.S. Medal of Honor.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.989
He rose through the ranks and was a captain
when he was pulled out of the war in 1945.

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:57.940
All in all, he earned 33 awards and decorations
for his exemplary service during the war.

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.349
He was just 20 years old at the time and,
as one movie critic later put it, knew more

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:05.230
of death than he did of life.

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.410
When Murphy returned from the war, he suffered
from post-traumatic stress disorder, a condition

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.189
that often went undiagnosed at the time.

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:16.459
After being featured on the cover of Life
magazine, he found himself in Hollywood without

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.440
work, sleeping in rough conditions.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.680
He caught his big break in 1949 when he starred
in the film Bad Boy.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.780
That same year, he released the aforementioned
autobiography titled To Hell and Back, which

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.480
topped the bestseller charts.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.670
He went on to star as himself in a movie with
the same title in 1955; it was Universal’s

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.889
top-grossing film for nearly 20 years until
Jaws usurped it.

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:39.079
Acting seemed to suit him.

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:43.780
He made no less than 44 feature films while
he was in Hollywood, many of them westerns,

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:49.779
and also filmed a 26-episode western TV series
called Whispering Smith, which aired in 1961

00:03:49.779 --> 00:03:50.779
on NBC.

00:03:50.779 --> 00:03:55.150
It was criticised for being too violent, however,
and cancelled after just 20 episodes were

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.150
aired.

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.209
A man of many talents, Murphy also dabbled
in poetry and song-writing as well as horse

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:01.480
breeding and racing.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.290
Thanks to his earnings from acting, he was
able to purchase a ranch in Texas.

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.889
He was living an incredibly comfortable life,
far grander than what he had known as a child.

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:12.430
Yet all was not well with Murphy.

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.620
Back to his post traumatic stress disorder,
he became dependent on sleeping pills to combat

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.629
the insomnia he experienced after the war.

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:23.610
Realizing he had become addicted to them,
he locked himself in a motel room for a week,

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.840
while he worked through the withdrawal symptoms.

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.479
He ended up beating the addiction and went
on to break the taboo of talking about the

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:32.800
mental disorders many soldiers suffered when
they returned home.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.010
His willingness to do so opened up discussions
about psychological care for veterans upon

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.520
their return to the US.

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.860
Murphy ended up marrying twice, divorcing
his first wife after just two years, and having

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.830
two sons with his second wife.

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.100
He appeared to be happy with his family, with
more than enough money in the bank to keep

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.120
them comfortable (though he squandered much
of it on gambling in his later years); had

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:57.000
acted in dozens of movies; and had amazing
war stories to tell his grandkids about.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.340
Unfortunately, he wasn’t able to get to
that stage of his life.

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:05.810
On May 28, 1971, Murphy was in a private plane
flying on a business trip from Atlanta, Georgia

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:07.400
to Martinsville, Virginia.

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.849
The weather conditions were less than ideal:
rain and fog shortened the pilot’s visibility

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:15.180
considerably, and he had a questionable instrument
rating.

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.160
He called in to the Roanoke, Virginia airport
to say that he would be landing shortly due

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.500
to poor conditions.

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:25.470
The plane, carrying five passengers including
Murphy, never landed in the Roanoke Valley.

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.180
It crashed into Brush Mountain twenty miles
away, close to Blacksburg.

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:30.919
Everyone in the crash was killed.

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:33.420
Murphy was just 45 years old.

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:37.889
The site of the crash has since been turned
into a monument, and in the 1990s, the Appalachian

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:40.199
Trail was rerouted to go past it.

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:42.520
That wasn’t quite the end for Murphy, though.

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.440
After a funeral in Arlington Cemetery, where
his grave remains the second most visited

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:51.870
(after Kennedy’s), he was posthumously awarded
his final medal, the Texas Legislative Medal

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:52.870
of Honor.

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:59.000
It was presented to his last remaining sister,
Nadine Murphy, on October 29, 2013 by Governor

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:12.530
Rick Perry.
