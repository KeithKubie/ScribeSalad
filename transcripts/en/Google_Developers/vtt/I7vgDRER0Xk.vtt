GREG HARTRELL: So today, I have
the privilege of welcoming you

00:00:12.795 --> 00:00:14.677
to Google's Developer Day 2015.

00:00:14.677 --> 00:00:17.260
I want to spend a little bit of
time talking about how we view

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.120
the opportunity in mobile
games with all of our platforms

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.000
and services, and then
take you through some

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.458
of the new announcements that
we're really excited to share

00:00:24.458 --> 00:00:25.110
with you today.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.090
As you all know, Android
is incredibly popular.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.550
And the platform has
grown tremendously

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.530
since we launched it
in 2008 with the G1

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.830
to a mere few thousand users.

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.480
Six short years later, it's the
most popular mobile operating

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.030
system platform in the
world, accounting for three

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.070
out of every four smartphones
and three out of every five

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.570
tablets.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.940
And Android's not
only popular, but it's

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.420
amazing to see how powerful
the platform's become.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.060
And we know that more than
85% of Android devices

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.570
are now running
Android 4.0 and higher,

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.602
and that's growing every day.

00:01:01.602 --> 00:01:03.310
But if you look beyond
just market share,

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.000
the aggregate size of
the Android device base

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.800
is equally impressive.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.280
It's grown exponentially
over the last few years,

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.140
and its velocity continues.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.500
We crossed this
milestone last year,

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.000
announcing that we have over
a billion active devices

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.280
around the world.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.970
That scale is truly
unprecedented.

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.370
And when you take a
games lens to this,

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.560
there's three in
four Android users

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.800
playing games from Google Play.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.290
That is a lot of people
playing games, needless to say.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.459
And this kind of
audience makes Google

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:36.750
Play one of the most interesting
opportunities for game

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.220
developers today.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.450
Android is also a
truly global platform.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.260
And judging from
the audience, we

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.650
know that you're coming from
all corners of the globe,

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.720
and the scale of our
international growth

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.190
is pretty amazing.

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.672
We have partnerships with 60
device manufacturers, devices

00:01:53.672 --> 00:01:55.130
all over the world
that are running

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.510
on 329 distinct carriers.

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:03.390
And the people using Android
come from over 190 countries.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.210
When you combine
all that together,

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.510
this might be the largest
platform of people playing

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.940
games perhaps ever created,
and our investments here

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.992
are going to continue.

00:02:12.992 --> 00:02:14.700
One of the areas that
we invest in really

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.210
heavily is also in our global
payments infrastructure.

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.830
In the past few years, we've
done great integrations

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.290
with carriers for billing.

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.310
We're doing that now in 32
countries around the world.

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.820
We've accelerated the rollout
of Google Play gift cards

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.330
in retail locations, and we
have that now in 28 countries.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.920
And PayPal is a form of
payment in 19 countries

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.550
and going strong.

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.620
I'm also happy to say that
with this growth of Android

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.640
and Google Play, it's paying
off for developers too.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.640
Last week, we announced
that Google Play

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.740
has paid out over $7 billion to
developers over the past year.

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.390
And that makes the
opportunity for apps and games

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.190
really intense.

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.020
And so starting from
phones and tablets,

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.750
and going to TVs, wearables,
and cars, Android is expanding.

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.660
And while Android and Play
are these platforms that

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.400
make these devices
possible, the truth

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.479
is the games that you
create, and the apps that

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:10.020
are brought to the
ecosystem, is what

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.020
makes them really worthwhile.

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.520
And so that's one
of the reasons why

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.130
we're big on helping you
tap into this opportunity.

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.500
Google helps take your
games to new heights

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.680
through our strengths in
mobile and in cloud services.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.490
This collection of
platforms and services

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:26.310
help you distribute
to a mass audience,

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.170
promote and monetize your
game, and build your audience,

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.190
and measure your success.

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:34.932
So that's the opportunity
in a nutshell.

00:03:34.932 --> 00:03:37.140
What I want to do is switch
to talking the new stuff,

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.223
and this can be thought
of in these three buckets.

00:03:39.223 --> 00:03:42.986
We'll talk about new things to
measure and monetize your game.

00:03:42.986 --> 00:03:44.360
We'll talk about
the living room,

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.234
and then we'll talk
about completely new game

00:03:46.234 --> 00:03:48.820
experiences that are emerging.

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.560
So on the measurement front,
when you publish your game

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.910
through Google Play,
you get really key tools

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.442
from Google Play services
and the Google Play Developer

00:03:57.442 --> 00:03:58.661
Console.

00:03:58.661 --> 00:04:00.660
These are essential to
running an effective game

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.397
business in our ecosystem.

00:04:02.397 --> 00:04:04.480
Some recent announcements
in the Developer Console

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.997
involve our conversion
rate reports.

00:04:06.997 --> 00:04:08.455
This is the percentage
of users who

00:04:08.455 --> 00:04:10.788
have purchased an in-app item
or subscription since they

00:04:10.788 --> 00:04:13.195
installed the game, and our
spending per buyer report,

00:04:13.195 --> 00:04:14.820
which shows your
users and what they've

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.154
spent cumulatively since they
made their first purchase.

00:04:17.154 --> 00:04:19.778
Of course, it's really essential
when you're updating your game

00:04:19.778 --> 00:04:22.140
to understand how player
spending behaviors are changing

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.450
over time and understanding
whether their lifetime value is

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.480
working out the way
that you expect.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.090
We also announced the ability
to programmatically access Play

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.590
data.

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:31.865
So if you have
internal tools where

00:04:31.865 --> 00:04:34.160
you want to bring in this
data and analyze it yourself,

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.800
or use it in third party
tools, or other query

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.610
engines like Google's BigQuery,
that's available to you

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.570
now as well.

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.650
In past announcements,
we've talked to you

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.400
about Google Play
Games, our game network,

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.100
which continues to grow and help
developers engage and retain

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.220
their users.

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:52.840
It is growing at a
rapid pace, and we

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.260
see more and more developers
incorporating it and seeing

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:56.650
great results.

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:58.910
If you have exemplary
implementations for things

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:01.630
like achievements,
leaderboards, quests,

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:03.910
we're finding developers
able to substantially retain

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:06.210
their users, increase
their lifetime value

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.555
and their revenue as a result.

00:05:08.555 --> 00:05:10.680
Now, last year, we talked
to you about bringing you

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.160
demographic data and
key business metrics

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.090
through the Google
Play Developer Console,

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.290
if you've incorporated
game services.

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:19.650
And after experiencing
the benefits of that data,

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.360
many of you are
actively using it

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.830
but also told you
you wanted more.

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.788
You wanted more player
insights, and you wanted

00:05:24.788 --> 00:05:25.949
more key business metrics.

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:28.240
So we've heard you, and I'd
like to invite my colleague

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.760
Ben onto the stage to tell
you about a new feature

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.500
that we call Play Games
Play Analytics that's

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:34.730
launching soon.

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:36.024
Ben.

00:05:36.024 --> 00:05:38.510
BEN FRENKEL: Which one of these
buttons is the [? board? ?]

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:39.300
GREG HARTRELL: You go right.

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:39.730
BEN FRENKEL: Right.

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:41.230
GREG HARTRELL: And the center
button's the laser pointer.

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:42.410
Essential.

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:44.960
BEN FRENKEL: Center button,
laser pointer-- check.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.250
All right.

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:48.050
I think we're all set.

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:50.204
So thank you, Greg.

00:05:50.204 --> 00:05:51.620
Creating a great
game is no longer

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:54.200
enough to be successful
in mobile gaming.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.670
It's still required, but it's
now an insufficient condition

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:58.710
for success.

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:00.970
And as we look at the
mobile gaming landscape,

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:03.690
it's increasingly
split into two camps--

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:05.440
those with the
resources and tools

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:10.000
to manage their game as a
service, and everyone else.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.490
And when we look at larger
developers that successfully

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:14.260
manage their game
as a service, we

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.580
find that they do three
things really well.

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:20.720
One, they set and
manage their business

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.430
to daily revenue targets.

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:26.540
Two, they can identify hotspots
in their business metrics

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:28.970
so they can continuously
focus on the updates

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:31.150
to their game that will
have the most impact.

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:33.930
And three, they use
analytics to understand

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:37.100
how their players are
progressing, spending,

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.040
and churning.

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.950
So what does it take
for a typical big studio

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:44.280
to do all these things?

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:47.610
Well, a big studio
will have many teams

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:50.820
managing all the different
functions of a game studio.

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:53.590
So you'll have a team of people
focused on game development,

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:56.740
obviously, a group of
data scientists focused

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:00.680
on analytics, and teams for
operations, and infrastructure

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:04.580
support, and
marketing, and so on.

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:08.960
On the other hand, this is
what you, the indie developer,

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:13.110
probably looks like-- a
small team, possibly just one

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:15.950
developer, doing everything.

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:17.910
Now, this indie developer
here, this happy guy

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:21.160
with the green hoodie, he
wants to spend all of his time

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.490
focused on building
games, right?

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:26.050
I'm sure many of you in the
audience feel the same way.

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:27.359
And you know what?

00:07:27.359 --> 00:07:29.400
That leaves very little
time for everything else.

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:33.280
And it's bridging
this gap between what

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:37.160
the big studios can do and
what you, the indie developer,

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:40.910
can do that was the
primary motivation for what

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:44.720
we're excited to announce
today-- Play Games Player

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:45.780
Analytics.

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:48.440
So its launching in the next
few weeks, in the Play Developer

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:51.030
Console, and this
new tool will enable

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:52.530
you to do the
three things I just

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:57.420
described-- manage your business
to daily revenue targets,

00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:59.660
identify hotspots in
your business metrics

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:02.150
so you can continuously
focus on the updates

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:05.230
to your game that will have
the most impact, and three,

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:08.550
understand how your players
are progressing, spending,

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:09.320
and churning.

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:13.390
And all of Player Analytics
is available for free

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:16.280
in the Developer Console
for everybody who

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:18.490
integrates Play game services.

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:20.860
So I'll quickly walk you
through the set of experiences

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:23.090
we'll be providing at launch.

00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:27.080
So everything starts with you
setting your daily revenue

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:28.440
targets.

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:31.110
And from there, once
you've done that,

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:34.260
you can come back into the
Developer Console every day

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.409
and check to see if you're on
track to meet your business

00:08:37.409 --> 00:08:38.360
objectives.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:40.070
And as you can see
in the chart here,

00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:44.630
this developer has set their
daily revenue target to $125,

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:47.770
is on track to exceed
their monthly goal,

00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:48.520
and you know what?

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:50.395
At the end of the month,
they should probably

00:08:50.395 --> 00:08:52.460
consider raising
their target higher.

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:56.200
But if it wasn't a
positive trend in the data

00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:00.640
that they were seeing, and
they were below the line, then

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:03.220
this report would end up
being the starting point

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:07.020
of an investigation into how
they can improve their game.

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:09.610
And to help you
focus on the areas

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:12.330
where your game updates
will have the most impact,

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:14.890
we give you the ability
to identify hotspots

00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:16.640
in your business metrics.

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:19.190
So first, we compute
a set of benchmarks

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:22.140
from a variety of inputs,
including the category

00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:23.630
that your game is in.

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:25.870
And based on those
benchmarks, we

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:29.880
create a heat map of your
key financial and engagement

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:32.100
metrics.

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:36.360
Metrics highlighted in red
are likely to offer the best

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:37.889
opportunity for improvement.

00:09:37.889 --> 00:09:39.722
And as you can see here,
this game developer

00:09:39.722 --> 00:09:41.590
is doing pretty well overall.

00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:45.360
See that sea of green there
in the chart at the bottom?

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:46.940
Green is good.

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:49.930
And so there's one exception.

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:52.400
Average revenue per
user is in dark red,

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:55.480
and trending down, and
well below the benchmark

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:56.790
for similar games.

00:09:56.790 --> 00:10:00.420
And this developer can
now have a laser focus

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:02.850
on improving just one
thing now, and that's

00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:05.125
average revenue per user.

00:10:05.125 --> 00:10:06.500
And to help you
better understand

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:08.440
how your players are
progressing, spending,

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:11.410
and churning, we give you
this classic retention table

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:15.140
and player progression
funnel, as you can see here.

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:18.230
Now, everything I just
described is available to you

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:22.180
by virtue of your integration
with Play game services

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:25.520
with near zero
incremental effort.

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:28.030
But for a little
extra work, you'll

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:30.940
be able to unlock another
set of valuable reports

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:32.410
with the Sources
and Sinks Report,

00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:35.632
which I'll go over in
a second, starting off.

00:10:35.632 --> 00:10:37.590
Throughout the development
of Player Analytics,

00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:40.830
we have been fortunate to work
with some amazing partners,

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:43.130
and one of them is
in the room today.

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:44.550
And I can see him right there.

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:47.270
It's Eric Froemling, the
developer of "BombSquad."

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:49.400
Let's go ahead and
wave to the crowd here.

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:51.670
You're going to want to
talk to him after this

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:53.910
and learn a little bit
more about his experiences

00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:56.720
with Player Analytics.

00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:00.230
So Eric is the archetype
of that indie developer

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:04.670
that I was describing before
but without the green hoodie.

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:07.070
And he's a one-man army
that does everything

00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:08.680
for his critically
acclaimed game,

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:11.570
"BombSquad," including having
built the underlying game

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:13.755
engine, which is
extremely impressive.

00:11:13.755 --> 00:11:16.620
And when we started working
with Eric a month or so ago,

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:19.850
we could tell Eric had a
great game on his hands--

00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:24.340
millions of downloads, engaged
users, a loyal fan base.

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:25.960
But like many of
you in the audience

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:30.640
who also have a great game, he
was struggling to make money.

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:33.960
So when Eric started to dig
into the Player Analytics data,

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:37.350
in particular the Sources and
Sinks Report you can see here,

00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:42.370
he was immediately able to spot
an imbalance in "BombSquad's"

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:43.550
game economy.

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:45.780
He was giving away tickets,
his premium currency,

00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:48.900
at a higher rate than people
were able to spend them.

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:51.030
And under those
conditions, there

00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:53.430
was little reason for
people to purchase tickets.

00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:56.220
And so he made a couple
of changes to his game.

00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:58.190
He added new ways
to consume tickets

00:11:58.190 --> 00:12:00.950
in the single player and
multiplayer modes in his game,

00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:03.720
to bring his economy
back into balance.

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:07.170
And the impact has been
transformational for Eric.

00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:10.160
So in addition to correcting
the economy imbalance,

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:13.800
Eric has seen more
than double in growth

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:17.480
in average revenue per user and
seen average revenue per paying

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:21.460
user grow by almost 70%.

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:25.120
That's almost unheard of growth
in such a short period of time.

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:27.911
So congratulations, Eric.

00:12:27.911 --> 00:12:30.296
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:37.700
And in his own words, "Player
Analytics has helped me home

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:40.880
in on 'BombSquad's'
shortcomings, right the ship,

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:46.220
and get to the point where I
can financially justify making

00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:47.900
the games I want to make."

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:51.410
And Player Analytics has now
successfully bridged that gap

00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:54.100
I was describing before
between the big studio

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:55.980
and what the indie
developer can do,

00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:59.830
and he can run his
game as a live service.

00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:01.820
So to recap, Player
Analytics will

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:04.930
help you do three things to
manage your game as a service.

00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:06.660
One, set and manage
your business

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:08.240
to daily revenue targets.

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:11.960
Two, identify hotspots
in your business metrics

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:14.620
so you continuously
focus on the updates

00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:16.580
to your game that will
have the most impact.

00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:18.200
And three, deepen
your understanding

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:20.300
of how your players are
progressing, spending,

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:21.230
and churning.

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:24.720
And again, all of these reports
will be available for free

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:27.320
in the Developer Console
in the next few weeks.

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:31.420
Now, creating a successful
game is still a lot of work.

00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:34.000
But with Player
Analytics, integrating

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.230
with Play game services is a
great first step to success.

00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:41.122
So with that, I'll
hand it back to you.

00:13:41.122 --> 00:13:43.511
GREG HARTRELL: Thanks, Mr. Ben.

00:13:43.511 --> 00:13:46.493
[APPLAUSE]

00:13:48.879 --> 00:13:49.920
That was pretty exciting.

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:53.430
I also want to switch over
to talking about monetization

00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:54.680
and also get us back on time.

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:56.638
We've got a clicker, and
we're going to use it.

00:13:56.638 --> 00:14:01.440
So successful game developers,
we know, deploy sophisticated

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:03.020
monetization models
for their games,

00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:07.181
and ads play a really important
role in that exercise.

00:14:07.181 --> 00:14:09.430
When you think about a good
ads monetization strategy,

00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:11.260
it really depends on
these three things.

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:14.076
One is you need to understand
your users in a very deep way.

00:14:14.076 --> 00:14:15.700
You want to be able
to tailor your game

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:19.700
experiences to those audiences
and react to how they behave.

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:22.516
Second is you want to show
ads at the right time,

00:14:22.516 --> 00:14:24.140
and this is so you
can maximize revenue

00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:26.580
for people who are
likely to spend, and also

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:28.100
have a variety of ad formats.

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:29.590
And those ad formats
help you find

00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:31.850
the balance between
when you show an ad

00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:35.250
and how you keep users
properly engaged in your game.

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:37.822
Now, if you've gone through
the exercise of thinking

00:14:37.822 --> 00:14:40.030
about building this yourself,
or if you've done that,

00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:42.840
you know it's a big investment,
both in software engineering

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:44.830
resources, know-how,
and not to mention,

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:46.470
the back-end infrastructure.

00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:50.340
Meanwhile, AdMob can provide
all these tools that you need,

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:53.200
and I'm excited to share with
you three big announcements

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:56.240
for ads that represent,
really, a platform

00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:00.850
that's a smart, audience-aware
platform for showing

00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:03.070
the right ads to your players.

00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:05.500
The first of these tools
is called Audience Builder.

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:07.760
It's now available to
all AdMob developers

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:11.920
who use Google Play Analytics,
or Google Analytics globally.

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:14.460
Audience Builder through
AdMob is this way

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:16.900
of creating a list of
users, or audience lists,

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:19.890
based on Google
Analytics segments.

00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:23.250
These can be based on behaviors,
like sessions or spending.

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:26.270
And it enables you to play
with different monetization

00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:27.610
strategies with those users.

00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:29.910
So a canonical example
might be taking

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:31.860
a segment of users
that were previously

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:34.742
paying users who had
churned out after 30 days,

00:15:34.742 --> 00:15:36.200
creating an audience
list for them,

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:38.970
and then creating an ad campaign
to try to attract them back

00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:41.070
to your game.

00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:44.380
The second tool is called
In-App Purchase House Ads.

00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:46.720
House Ads are, as
some of you know,

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:48.530
free ads that you
display in your game

00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:51.860
to promote in-game items and
consumables that players might

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:53.790
want to enhance their gameplay.

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:55.490
A challenge with
House Ads, of course,

00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:58.230
though, is that everybody's in
a different stage in your game.

00:15:58.230 --> 00:16:00.520
Early players are
probably going to be

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:03.590
interested in a different
set of purchasable items,

00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:06.360
versus advanced players
who may be more nuanced.

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:09.430
AdMob solves this with
Google algorithms and machine

00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:12.240
learning to only show
these types of ads

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:15.090
to users who are likely
to take advantage of them.

00:16:15.090 --> 00:16:17.160
We do all that work
for you so players

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:19.980
can get the ad that they
want, and for everybody else,

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:23.500
you can focus on creating
a different experience.

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:25.640
And lastly, we're incredibly
excited to announce

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:28.050
a new format,
Native Ads, which is

00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:30.130
available through
a limited beta.

00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:32.790
Native Ads is this
popular industry term

00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:35.300
that's used to describe an ad
experience that essentially

00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:37.800
weaves into the product's
form and function

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:39.560
so it looks like it belongs.

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:41.650
Google has a lot of
experience doing this well,

00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:43.880
and we're bringing that
capability to game developers

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:45.100
today.

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:48.730
Native Ads benefits users,
advertisers, and developers.

00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:51.230
From a user experience, it
is a better user experience

00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:53.910
when the ad looks like it
actually belongs in your game.

00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:56.250
And advertisers see
stronger, or can

00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:58.120
see stronger,
performance when it looks

00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:00.190
like it's natively styled.

00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:02.219
And as a developer,
you get to preserve

00:17:02.219 --> 00:17:04.010
more of the creative
direction of your game

00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:06.189
when you add ads
into your experience,

00:17:06.189 --> 00:17:08.480
while gaining the benefits
of the revenue opportunities

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:10.703
that ads can provide you.

00:17:10.703 --> 00:17:12.369
Let's take a closer
look at what Atari's

00:17:12.369 --> 00:17:16.440
up to with "RollerCoaster Tycoon
4" incorporating Native Ads.

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:18.740
You can see from here
that it fits very well

00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:20.470
within the visual
style of the game

00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:23.569
and shows you how you can easily
integrate it into, for example,

00:17:23.569 --> 00:17:24.650
user interfaces.

00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:27.000
So again, it looks
like it belongs.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.890
Native Ads can take
the form of an app

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:31.580
install or promoting
new content.

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:33.560
And it pulls from our
network of over a million

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:35.220
Google advertisers.

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:37.740
Your game simply just gets
the metadata for the ad.

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:41.750
This is the headline, the app
icon, even the store rating.

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:43.860
And you decide how to
render it in your game,

00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:45.420
using Google Guidelines.

00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:48.230
And this is available
for Android and iOS.

00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:50.580
It's in limited beta
right now, but it's one

00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:55.360
that we're excited
to expand in 2015.

00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:58.730
Let me switch over to talking
about the living room.

00:17:58.730 --> 00:18:01.040
The message today
is your Android game

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:02.770
is really not all that
far from making it

00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:05.290
into living rooms today.

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:08.690
We launched Android TV at
Google I/O in June of last year,

00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:11.050
bringing Android into the
living room for big screen

00:18:11.050 --> 00:18:13.190
apps, games, and content.

00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:15.910
It's controlled easily
through voice and remote,

00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:19.260
and as a platform, it's going
to come in a variety of flavors.

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:22.130
You're going to see it on
smart TVs, microconsoles,

00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:24.300
and set-top boxes.

00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:26.820
This year, we're really excited
about the ecosystem that's

00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:29.750
growing, and OEMs are bringing
those different form factors

00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:31.930
to the world that all
use the same operating

00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:33.300
system and experience.

00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:36.190
And that alone is
a unique phenomenon

00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:38.666
when you think about the
history of the living room.

00:18:38.666 --> 00:18:40.290
And a lot of partners
are going all in.

00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:44.100
Sony, for example, is committing
all of their compatible 2015

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:46.540
smart TVs to Android TV.

00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:48.170
And these pay TV
operators that you

00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:51.080
see here are switching
their entire platform

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:55.450
to set-top boxes using
Android TV, as well.

00:18:55.450 --> 00:18:58.240
Bringing your game to Android
TV is very straightforward.

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:01.150
And in most cases, it's going to
be a purely incremental effort

00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:02.640
from a development standpoint.

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:05.260
Because it's stock Android,
using the same services as

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:08.220
mobile and tablet, you're going
to be able to bring all of that

00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:12.060
over with a lean back experience
and get the same APIs.

00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:14.800
The Play Store continues
to be the distribution

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:15.580
point of record.

00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:17.700
So you have a familiar
distribution and promotion

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:20.300
capability there, with all of
the functionality that you've

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:21.970
come to expect from us.

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:23.830
And lastly, from a
standards point of view,

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:27.180
we have user experience
guidelines for apps and games,

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:30.450
to develop a higher
quality ecosystem, but also

00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:33.860
hardware accessory standards
for accessories like gamepads.

00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:35.940
All of these combine for
a fantastic living room

00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:38.190
experience, and we can't
wait to see the growth

00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:39.970
and what you bring
to Android TV.

00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:41.910
But we also have a
goal of actually making

00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:44.260
the gaming experience more
dynamic in the living room.

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:46.120
This is especially
in a world where,

00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:49.060
from my own personal point
of view-- local multiplayer

00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:50.954
and second screen experiences.

00:19:50.954 --> 00:19:52.620
And so today, we're
announcing something

00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:55.800
that we call the
Nearby Connections API.

00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:58.310
With this new protocol,
games can seamlessly

00:19:58.310 --> 00:20:01.180
connect smartphones
and tablets to games

00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:03.220
on the TV in front of them.

00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:05.280
The protocol simply
allows the instances

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:07.710
of games running on
phones, tablets, and TVs

00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:10.540
to find each other on
the same Wi-Fi network.

00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:13.200
We then create a peer-to-peer
network between them,

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:15.890
and you can communicate
between those devices.

00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:19.440
And this allows you to create
truly amazing local multiplayer

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:23.120
and second screen devices with
devices sitting in your pocket.

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:24.240
But seeing is believing.

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:27.010
We worked with Vector Unit,
who's a local developer here,

00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:28.820
with the creators of
"Beach Buggy Racing."

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:31.690
It's a kart racing game you
can actually play on Android TV

00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:32.309
today.

00:20:32.309 --> 00:20:34.100
Let's turn it over to
the team, to tell you

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:36.712
about what they've been
up to with "Beach Buggy."

00:20:36.712 --> 00:20:42.848
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:20:42.848 --> 00:20:43.348
-Hi, Greg.

00:20:43.348 --> 00:20:44.770
Hi, GDC attendees.

00:20:44.770 --> 00:20:46.070
You're looking great today.

00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:48.490
So I'm here with Ben from the
Google Play games services

00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:50.710
team, and we're going to
be playing a multiplayer

00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:53.070
game of "Beach Buggy Racing."

00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:55.981
But we only have one controller
and a whole bunch Android

00:20:55.981 --> 00:20:56.480
phones.

00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:58.450
So Ben, how are we
going to make this work?

00:20:58.450 --> 00:21:01.000
-So fortunately, the developer
of "Beach Buggy Racing,"

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.100
Vector Unit, has
implemented something called

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:04.610
a Nearby Connections API.

00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:07.800
That allows us to connect our
Android devices to the Android

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:09.550
TV and use them as controllers.

00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:13.080
And it's broadcasting a signal
behind the scenes, saying, hey,

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:15.440
all the phones nearby,
I'm available to connect.

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:16.886
And now the race begins.

00:21:22.385 --> 00:21:24.260
-So I noticed now that
we've started playing,

00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:25.480
your phone has changed.

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:26.540
What's going on here?

00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:28.470
-As my hands tilt
back and forth,

00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:30.440
you can tell that
an accelerometer now

00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:34.220
is being used to drive, but
more importantly, there's

00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:36.140
a couple of really
unique things that

00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:39.745
are going on that I can do
now with an Android device

00:21:39.745 --> 00:21:41.770
as a controller that
are difficult to do

00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:43.740
with a standard controller.

00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:46.700
And so the first thing is
there's these extra annotations

00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:47.580
on the screen here.

00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:49.366
Like in the upper
right-hand corner,

00:21:49.366 --> 00:21:50.990
you can see I have
this nitrous booster

00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:53.640
icon, which I can press.

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:56.340
Then on the left-hand side,
I've got my special powers.

00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:58.330
We've got some brake
pads down at the bottom

00:21:58.330 --> 00:22:01.470
so I can take these
corners a little better.

00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:04.930
And of course, there's some
animated dials in the middle,

00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:07.550
indicating how fast I'm going.

00:22:07.550 --> 00:22:09.640
-Woo!

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:10.390
-Let's play again.

00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:10.710
-All right.

00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:12.160
We're going to do
a rematch here.

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:13.785
Greg, we're going to
let you take over.

00:22:13.785 --> 00:22:15.265
Bye, Moscone.

00:22:15.265 --> 00:22:15.765
-Ciao.

00:22:20.006 --> 00:22:21.376
[END PLAYBACK]

00:22:21.376 --> 00:22:23.000
GREG HARTRELL: We
can't wait to see how

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.570
these experiences will unfold.

00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:27.600
I want to show you another quick
video from the developers who

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:30.372
make a game called "Lyricle."
"Lyricle" is a game that allows

00:22:30.372 --> 00:22:32.580
you to compete against
friends, based on how well you

00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:33.800
know song lyrics.

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:37.020
And they're going to be updating
their game later this year,

00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:38.430
to support Android TV.

00:22:38.430 --> 00:23:24.451
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:23:25.237 --> 00:23:27.570
GREG HARTRELL: Both of those
games look really exciting.

00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:29.528
I can't wait to play
them. "Beach Buggy Racing"

00:23:29.528 --> 00:23:31.700
and "Lyricle" are
launching later this year,

00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:33.370
supporting Nearby Connections.

00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:36.000
The Nearby Connections API
launches in the next few weeks

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.632
through Android on an update
to Google Play Services.

00:23:40.632 --> 00:23:42.090
Let me close out
talking about some

00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:45.630
of the new gaming experiences
that we're trying to foster.

00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:48.410
One of the platforms we
announced at Google I/O

00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:50.360
last year was the
Cardboard platform.

00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:52.160
And its vision is
fairly simple--

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:55.450
making virtual reality
accessible to everyone,

00:23:55.450 --> 00:23:57.710
and the immersive experiences
that come with them.

00:23:57.710 --> 00:24:02.460
Cardboard enables the broadest
reach of any VR platform today,

00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:05.040
and its momentum is
actually pretty amazing.

00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:08.580
We announced in December that
they shipped 500,000 devices,

00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:10.870
and it's been growing
quickly since then.

00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:12.920
And early access
developers have created

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:15.780
over 250 apps and games,
which you can search

00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:17.320
for on the Play Store today.

00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:19.250
But we're also excited
about a new generation

00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:21.600
of headsets that are emerging.

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:23.440
These are just two
examples of new headsets

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:25.170
that work with Google Cardboard.

00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:27.430
This means your games,
designed for Cardboard,

00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:29.620
will work on these
devices as well.

00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:32.000
Mattel announced
a new View-Master

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.595
that supports Google
Cardboard, and LG

00:24:33.595 --> 00:24:36.699
is shipping a headset with
every one of their 3G phones.

00:24:36.699 --> 00:24:38.240
Quick show of hands
in the audience--

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:41.060
who grew up with a View-Master?

00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:45.180
I'm also here to tell you today
that your childhood was awesome

00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:47.360
and that we're excited to
see the hardware vendor

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:49.750
ecosystem grow up
around Cardboard

00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:52.054
and bring these immersive
experiences to everyone.

00:24:52.054 --> 00:24:54.220
You can learn more about
Cardboard later in our code

00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:56.980
labs today, or you can go
to the link on the screen,

00:24:56.980 --> 00:25:00.897
g.co/cardboard, and learn more.

00:25:00.897 --> 00:25:03.480
Let me talk about Project Tango,
which is in developer preview

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:04.410
right now.

00:25:04.410 --> 00:25:06.960
This is a project from our
advanced technology group

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:08.660
that's attempting
to give devices

00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:10.667
an understanding of
space and motion.

00:25:10.667 --> 00:25:13.000
So when you think about it,
you can walk into this room,

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.360
and you have an understanding
of the walls around you,

00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:16.610
the chairs, the people.

00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:18.860
And that's how you
negotiate around the room.

00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:22.110
We want to give devices a
similar kind of understanding.

00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:25.100
And so Project Tango does this
by adding another wide camera

00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:28.630
lens to a device, a
depth-sensing camera,

00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:30.820
and a software stack that
gives you access to all

00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:32.622
of that through your app.

00:25:32.622 --> 00:25:34.580
There's a lot of really
interesting experiences

00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:38.110
that have been created from the
2,000 developer preview devices

00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:40.673
that we shipped
already-- 300 apps that

00:25:40.673 --> 00:25:43.170
have been created over
developers from 30 countries.

00:25:43.170 --> 00:25:46.660
I want to show you a quick
video from Left Field Labs.

00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:49.680
It's an example of a 3D
drawing application, where

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:52.390
you use the Tango to
draw things in the space

00:25:52.390 --> 00:25:54.212
in the room around you.

00:25:54.212 --> 00:26:34.297

00:26:34.297 --> 00:26:36.630
GREG HARTRELL: That looks
like a pretty cool experience.

00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:41.900
The ambient electronic music
doesn't ship with Tango.

00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:46.014
And finally, let's talk
about Android Auto and Games.

00:26:46.014 --> 00:26:46.680
No, I'm kidding.

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:48.254
Just don't do that.

00:26:48.254 --> 00:26:49.920
Playing games and
driving is a bad idea.

00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:52.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:55.461
We might be able to fix
that one day, though.

00:26:55.461 --> 00:26:55.960
All right.

00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:58.240
Thank you for your
time and opening up.

00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:00.624
I want to let you know
that we're hiring.

00:27:00.624 --> 00:27:02.040
Come to our code
labs later today.

00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:04.290
And let me turn it back over
to [? Kirb. ?] Thank you.

00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:05.468
Thank you.

00:27:05.468 --> 00:27:07.214
