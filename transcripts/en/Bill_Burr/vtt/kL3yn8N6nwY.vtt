1
00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:04.880
Hey,
what's going on it's Bill Burr.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon,

2
00:00:04.881 --> 00:00:09.470
just before a Friday,
Monday morning podcast.
And I am just checking in on you.

3
00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.110
Okay.
This is a very somber podcast.
I'm fucking,
it's not somber.

4
00:00:15.111 --> 00:00:18.920
I just have to go do a show and I don't fuck up my voice before I even go out

5
00:00:18.921 --> 00:00:23.300
there screaming like an idiot.
Um,
I am in clear Lake Iowa right now.

6
00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.020
I am about to do the surf ballroom,

7
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.270
the site of the final buddy Holly big Bopper,

8
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.610
uh,
Ritchie Valens show.

9
00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.670
I just landed in the airport that they took off from and subsequently died.

10
00:00:40.041 --> 00:00:43.190
I don't know if you heard about that.
They died along with some music I believe.

11
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.050
And um,

12
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:46.410
<v 0>okay.</v>

13
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.750
<v 1>Yeah,
I told a lot of people that was flying into there.
I was like,
dude,</v>

14
00:00:48.751 --> 00:00:52.230
what are you out of your mind?
Well,
good luck dude.
Good luck.

15
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.730
You know what I mean?
Yeah.

16
00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.470
They don't say that when you fly out of lax.
Right.

17
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.890
Some fucking more on flew his plane into a commercial airliner at La when the

18
00:01:07.051 --> 00:01:09.660
guy was on final.
So,
I mean,
I don't understand what the deal is.

19
00:01:09.661 --> 00:01:12.270
The reason why they are plane crashes because they didn't have the technology

20
00:01:12.271 --> 00:01:16.590
back then.
There was a,
they had ice on the wink.
Okay?

21
00:01:16.591 --> 00:01:18.450
Not only adding weight to the aircraft,

22
00:01:18.451 --> 00:01:21.900
it changes the shape of the fucking wing so it doesn't produce the lift you
need.

23
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.670
And then you've got the big bopper in there.
He's a big guy and a,

24
00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.890
you've got yourself a problem.
All right?

25
00:01:28.891 --> 00:01:31.800
Now we all know that I've been off the booze,
I've been losing weight.

26
00:01:31.801 --> 00:01:33.690
So I'm flying in,
I'm not flying in,

27
00:01:33.691 --> 00:01:37.680
I'm riding in and I'm in a prop plane coming down from Minneapolis.

28
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.521
And of course,

29
00:01:38.521 --> 00:01:41.340
you know when you're flying commercial you look at a prop plane like,
dude,

30
00:01:41.341 --> 00:01:44.700
what the fuck?
You know?
But uh,

31
00:01:44.701 --> 00:01:47.980
if you just knew how much the plane probably costs,
I don't know.
Probably too,

32
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.650
it's probably a $2 million plane.
All right?
They can seat 10 people.

33
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.850
Now if you just look at that like what if I own that?

34
00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.460
What if I owned one of those?
I have,
if you had a 10 passenger fucking plane,

35
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.360
you are the shit.
Everybody's like this guy he's doing,

36
00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.000
he's going to fucking play.
He's got to play in.

37
00:02:09.001 --> 00:02:12.300
What does it hold 10 people get the fuck out of you.
That guy's crushing it.

38
00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.630
But the second you fly commercial and it's a 10 seater,

39
00:02:15.631 --> 00:02:17.580
everybody gets all fucking freaked out.

40
00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.950
Like I'm not getting in that piece of shit.

41
00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.540
The exact same plane that if your buddy down the street went and bought it,
you,

42
00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.390
you,
you would think that he hit the lottery.
All right.

43
00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.600
A lot less mute moving fucking parts.

44
00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.180
So I get on the thing and I immediately texted a buddy of mine who was fucking

45
00:02:35.181 --> 00:02:38.270
terrified of flying just to watch,
you know,
I was,

46
00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.390
I really wish that he was there,
a buddy of mine outside of comedy.

47
00:02:41.391 --> 00:02:46.310
So I'm taking the picture as the lady who's going to fly it is doing the,
uh,

48
00:02:46.311 --> 00:02:51.140
the announcements,
telling us basically what not to do.
And uh,
he goes,

49
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.300
dude,
there's no fucking way I would be on that plane.

50
00:02:53.301 --> 00:02:57.170
And then he saw the woman's face.
He goes,
is that the pilot?
And I go,
yeah.

51
00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:58.970
And he goes,
no,
no.

52
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.900
<v 2>He said,
not for females.</v>

53
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.360
Fucking unbelievable.
What do you mean not for females?

54
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.160
And she doesn't have to bench press it.
It's a fucking machine.
Jesus Christ.

55
00:03:15.161 --> 00:03:16.090
And because of guys like you,

56
00:03:16.091 --> 00:03:18.850
she probably went through extra bullshit to become a pilot.

57
00:03:18.851 --> 00:03:21.640
I think she's going to be fun.
She crushed it.
Of course,

58
00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.050
not for females.
Um,
I dunno.

59
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:27.910
I'm sure some women will be offended by that,

60
00:03:27.911 --> 00:03:30.250
but it really just had to do with this person's fear of flying.

61
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.320
You know what I mean?
He wants,
you know,
he basically wants to pilot,

62
00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.850
I don't know what to look like to look like fucking Lee majors of some shit.
Um,

63
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.931
and to be honest with you,

64
00:03:40.931 --> 00:03:45.190
most of them don't because they sit up in that uncomfortable chair their whole

65
00:03:45.191 --> 00:03:49.480
life and they got a quick turnaround.
So they run in there and eat airport food.

66
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.750
And a lot of them,
the lot of them look like,
you know,

67
00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.490
if they didn't have like that,
uh,
they actually,
you know what,

68
00:03:56.491 --> 00:04:00.970
if you went to a buffalo wild wings and you took the average football fan,

69
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.260
you know,
draft kings,
fucking Jalapeno poppers,

70
00:04:05.261 --> 00:04:10.261
fucking loud moron and you took that fat fucks Jersey off and you put on a

71
00:04:10.391 --> 00:04:14.200
pilot,
you put them in a pilot uniform and he told you flew for American,

72
00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.460
you'd believe it.
You know,
not saying that the average pilot is,

73
00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:23.380
is dumb is he average dope that goes to a fucking sports bar,
myself included.

74
00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.010
I'm saying that they have the same body type.

75
00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.360
That's all I'm saying.
All right,
so anyways,

76
00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.160
you don't think that was fucked up is that um,

77
00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:35.580
I guess it's probably a number thing.

78
00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.270
There was only 10 of us including the pilot and is one of those flights where,

79
00:04:40.271 --> 00:04:44.800
you know,
they,
they got like weigh your bags,
all of that shit.

80
00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.440
They tell you where to sit,
you know,
the whole weight and balance thing.

81
00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.890
And then one of the passengers gets to set up in the copilot seat.

82
00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.120
And I was just thinking like,

83
00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:55.810
that's the only part about this that I don't like that there's only one pilot

84
00:04:55.811 --> 00:04:58.120
here.
Uh,
you know,
flying commercial,

85
00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.410
there should be two people in case somebody has some sort of cardiac episode or

86
00:05:01.411 --> 00:05:05.260
a or whatever.
Right.
That was the only thing I was concerned about,

87
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:09.010
but it was a course.
It was a cloudy day and all that shit.
Um,

88
00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.280
but,
uh,
it was incredible.
So anyways,
um,

89
00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:17.140
I think I might do this podcast in two parts because I'm so excited to be

90
00:05:17.141 --> 00:05:18.430
playing this venue here tonight.

91
00:05:18.431 --> 00:05:21.640
I'm here with Dean del Ray were freaking out that we're going to get to play

92
00:05:21.641 --> 00:05:25.060
this place and it's still the original stage.

93
00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:27.610
Most of these places,

94
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.650
they don't have the original stage because whoever was legendary who played

95
00:05:32.651 --> 00:05:36.280
there didn't immediately go out,
get in a plane and then died.

96
00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.640
So immediately that place became like this shrine.
So they,
they,

97
00:05:39.641 --> 00:05:44.290
they've added to the stage,
but the wood flooring is the same.
And like,

98
00:05:44.291 --> 00:05:46.060
we're going to stand on the same fucking ward.

99
00:05:46.061 --> 00:05:50.680
I don't know if you're into that type of stuff.
Um,
I am.
So I'm very excited.

100
00:05:50.681 --> 00:05:53.110
I guess everybody's ever played there as signed the wall.

101
00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:56.350
I'm going to try to take pictures that they let us know.
So,
um,

102
00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.750
but either way I'm going to come back and,
um,

103
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:05.030
finish out this podcast after I do the show.
Um,
by the way,

104
00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.460
um,
I hope you guys enjoyed that live podcast as much as I did.
Uh,

105
00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:11.600
got a bunch of compliments.
People really liked it.

106
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:16.400
I definitely want to do another one.
Um,
it was weird.

107
00:06:16.401 --> 00:06:17.830
I felt like I was doing standup,

108
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:21.740
but I was just sort of sitting down on the couch and,
um,

109
00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:26.120
and I was also like amazed at what people laugh at.

110
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.860
You know,
I had,
you know,
I,
you know,
I just been doing it,

111
00:06:30.861 --> 00:06:32.930
talking to myself like I am right now forever.

112
00:06:32.931 --> 00:06:34.760
I have an idea what you laugh at that,

113
00:06:34.761 --> 00:06:39.650
but I had no idea how much you guys laughed when people wrote in and shit all

114
00:06:39.651 --> 00:06:42.170
over me.
Um,
when they,

115
00:06:42.171 --> 00:06:45.590
when they ask advice and,
um,

116
00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:50.440
and then the level of crazy shit that I say on here,
just being a fucking moron,

117
00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:54.440
I had no idea that people laughed at that.
I just pictured,
I always pictured,

118
00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:59.330
I always picture guys snickering and then their wives shaking their heads

119
00:06:59.331 --> 00:07:03.530
walking out of the room.
That's what I picture when people listen to my podcast.

120
00:07:03.531 --> 00:07:05.840
I didn't realize,
you know,
we had,
we had a nice mix of people there,

121
00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.360
although they,
oh my God,
I forgot to tell you this.

122
00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:11.720
There was this one group of ladies who went to the show that would just hell

123
00:07:11.721 --> 00:07:14.960
bent on letting me know that their friend didn't laugh once,

124
00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.520
right?
Oh,
how did I feel is a great story.
So I'm standing there,

125
00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:24.410
I'm taking pictures,
right?
Fucking,
uh,
you know,

126
00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:28.910
signing the posters and all that shit for everybody who came out to the podcast.

127
00:07:28.911 --> 00:07:31.790
I'm being a great guy.
I'm a make God.
I'm being a great guy.

128
00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:36.350
I could've just done the fucking show and I could have hidden the green room

129
00:07:36.351 --> 00:07:40.640
afterwards being like,
I'm too tired.
I don't want to meet people,
blah,
blah,
blah,

130
00:07:40.641 --> 00:07:41.480
blah,
blah,
blah.

131
00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:45.830
I don't want to do it because I was in Reno and that guy reached in for is a

132
00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:49.310
camera that time and the loaded glock fell on the floor that he said,
oh shit.

133
00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:53.210
Quickly picked up and ran out of the fucking place.
I didn't,

134
00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:58.250
I walked out there and I was being a good guy.
Right.
So these,
uh,

135
00:07:58.251 --> 00:08:00.530
these older ladies,
right.
Um,

136
00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:04.910
older meaning they're probably about a year younger than me,

137
00:08:04.911 --> 00:08:08.870
a year or two younger than me.
You never know.
It's very hard to guess.

138
00:08:08.871 --> 00:08:12.440
A woman's age,
a white woman's age,
you know,
you can't tell.
You know what I mean?

139
00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:14.990
Because they're not big on using lotion.

140
00:08:14.991 --> 00:08:18.830
And after you have a kid like that does something to you,
you know,
see,
you know,

141
00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:22.550
as a guy it's hard because as long as we take care of ourselves,

142
00:08:22.551 --> 00:08:26.240
we don't have to go through given birth.
You know what I mean?

143
00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:28.500
Although we do have to live with women,
I may,

144
00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:31.610
maybe it just all kind of washes out.
I don't know.
Anyways,

145
00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:34.910
I think they will roughly my age.
Um,

146
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:37.490
and also I wasn't in like a,

147
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:42.050
I was in Phoenix and Phoenix is a,
yeah,

148
00:08:42.051 --> 00:08:45.260
there's enough plastic surgery there that people give a shit what they look
like.

149
00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:47.870
Some of these cities you go to like,
you know,

150
00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:53.840
like do you ever like watch old movies or old TV shows in the 70s and you'll see

151
00:08:53.841 --> 00:08:57.780
somebody or you look at a picture,
one of your favorite actors when they're 25,

152
00:08:57.781 --> 00:08:59.790
it's like,
dude,
that guy looks like a 40 year old.

153
00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:04.350
Like what 25 used to look like compared to where it does not well,

154
00:09:04.351 --> 00:09:08.760
when you go to smaller towns,
those people age the way people used to age.

155
00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:10.660
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

156
00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:14.890
<v 2>Like Lucille Ball going from I love Lucy to the Lucy show.</v>

157
00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:18.010
She looked like she did it 40 years later.

158
00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:21.730
She went from having this really nice voice to be like,
I miss the Modi.

159
00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:25.540
I like fucking smoking camel on filters.
Whatever the hell she did.

160
00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:29.810
<v 3>Um,
I dunno.</v>

161
00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:34.520
<v 2>But anyways,
what the fuck is my point?
So these ladies come walking up.
All right.</v>

162
00:09:34.521 --> 00:09:37.130
I could have just said they were about my age.
Right.
Which means to fucking old.

163
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.720
So they would just say,
hey,
you know,
you said that question,
you,
you,

164
00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:46.220
you know you wanted,
I was saying guys,
you need to be honest.
And they was,

165
00:09:46.221 --> 00:09:46.970
I think they,

166
00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:51.560
I think what happened was I think that they didn't like what I said about the

167
00:09:51.561 --> 00:09:54.500
woman that found out she was banging this guy,
we had a wife and family.

168
00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:58.250
I don't think that they,
I don't think they liked the response to that.

169
00:09:58.251 --> 00:10:02.780
So they came up cause they seem like they wanted to make me upset

170
00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:07.800
cause they came up and they were going like,
yeah,
just to let you know,

171
00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:11.220
just to let you know,
she,
she didn't laugh once.

172
00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:14.220
She didn't laugh once and I left cause that's funny,
right.
I was just like,

173
00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:16.470
oh I'm sorry.
Right.
And she goes,
yeah,

174
00:10:16.471 --> 00:10:20.940
I liked just stand up but that podcast live podcast,
I don't know about that.

175
00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:24.420
And I only like,
oh alright.
And she goes,
yeah,

176
00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:27.540
cause like I didn't laugh once and I was like,
all right.

177
00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:30.900
And then they were going like,
yeah,
and you said to be honest.

178
00:10:30.901 --> 00:10:33.630
And she didn't laugh once.
I was just like,
all right,
cool.

179
00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:37.890
So I mean,
what do you want me to do?

180
00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:43.320
I mean I had an hour and 20 minutes to make you laugh.
I didn't make you laugh.

181
00:10:43.321 --> 00:10:45.570
I mean,
I'm sure as hell not going to do it standing there.

182
00:10:45.571 --> 00:10:47.100
So I don't know what they were looking for.

183
00:10:47.101 --> 00:10:51.350
And they just kept hammering that fucking point
going.

184
00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:53.820
You said you said you wanted,
honestly,
we're just being honest.

185
00:10:53.821 --> 00:10:58.620
I say I appreciate it.
It's fine.
You know?
And then I finally just said,

186
00:10:58.621 --> 00:10:59.550
look ladies,

187
00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:05.270
like everyone else was laughing and then I kind of made a motion around the

188
00:11:05.461 --> 00:11:09.930
woman who wasn't laughing.
I was like,
I can survive this.
And they all went,
Ooh.

189
00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:11.970
And I'm saying I wasn't shitting on her.

190
00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:13.490
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

191
00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:18.320
<v 2>I just always look at it like the president of the United States.
Okay.</v>

192
00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:21.980
Like w I went in there,
there was like four or 500 people there.

193
00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:24.590
One person came up and said that they didn't like it.

194
00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:26.690
So just to make round numbers,

195
00:11:26.691 --> 00:11:30.620
we'll say 399 out of 400 people enjoyed it.

196
00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:36.170
Okay.
If a president or a senator had that level of approval rating,

197
00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:41.300
I mean it would be unheard of on fucking hurt him.

198
00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:46.090
So I'm going to walk away thinking that was a win.
And um,

199
00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:48.060
<v 3>okay.</v>

200
00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:51.660
<v 2>You know,
I dunno,
they just,
oh,
they just kept coming over,
but she didn't like it.</v>

201
00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:54.280
She did not like,
and that's the greatest

202
00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:57.200
<v 1>thing you can ever do when anybody criticize you.
Just be like,
ah,</v>

203
00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:05.130
no wait.
I want you to feel the weight of me not liking it.

204
00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:09.810
<v 2>Um,
I should have asked,
just giving her a refund.</v>

205
00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:11.750
How would she pay for the tickets?
Sweeter.

206
00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:14.640
<v 1>Alright.
Tell you what,
I'll make a deal.</v>

207
00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:19.140
I will give you that money back and whatever else it takes to get these fucking

208
00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:21.540
hands away from me.

209
00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.620
<v 2>Good Lord.
I,
I'll,
I was trying to think,</v>

210
00:12:24.621 --> 00:12:29.390
what did I say that made them take it to that level?
Because there's no way

211
00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:32.660
<v 1>if they were with some guys,
I would think,
all right.</v>

212
00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:35.510
They got dragged to the show and they were like,
who is this fucking animal now?

213
00:12:35.511 --> 00:12:38.860
That's happened to me a million times.
And then I sheepishly apologizing.

214
00:12:38.861 --> 00:12:42.920
It's like,
sorry,
I'm a moron.
Um,
but they came there by themselves,

215
00:12:42.921 --> 00:12:44.960
which means they liked me before they went there.

216
00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:52.560
So either she truly didn't laugh.

217
00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:57.860
Ones truly did not like it because she just didn't think I was funny or

218
00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.800
somewhere in there.
I pissed her off.

219
00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:06.400
<v 2>I think it might've been that,
you know,
I'm going to say,</v>

220
00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:09.580
uh,
it was either the married woman thing,

221
00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:12.130
the ovarian cancer,

222
00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:17.050
the dead first wives in the snow and Aspen,

223
00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:19.390
I'm gonna say somewhere in there

224
00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:24.590
<v 1>she decided that she needed to tell me
that she didn't.</v>

225
00:13:24.591 --> 00:13:27.200
Last ones didn't laugh once.
I have to tell you,

226
00:13:27.201 --> 00:13:28.850
it kind of made my fucking night though.

227
00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:35.020
<v 2>Um,
every,
once again,
I can't say every once in a while.
Well,</v>

228
00:13:35.021 --> 00:13:38.030
it is every once in a while now because I don't go out there,
but man,
I,
oh,
oh,

229
00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:42.350
oh God.
I had some fucking,
I can't,
I'm so old now.

230
00:13:42.351 --> 00:13:44.710
I can't even remember the amount of fucking times.

231
00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:50.830
Especially a lot of women too cause I,
I went through a bad period but a good,

232
00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:51.903
I don't know,

233
00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:58.930
I'd say like 12 year period out of my 25 just really trash and women in it just

234
00:14:00.441 --> 00:14:03.180
really was just my fucking issues.
Um,

235
00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:05.690
I'm trying to think what the fuck.

236
00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:08.360
I just vaguely remember being in North Carolina

237
00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:13.990
<v 1>and this woman was walking up to the table and it was fucking hilarious or</v>

238
00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:16.480
boyfriend or husband was like holding her back.
He looked,

239
00:14:16.481 --> 00:14:19.990
he was water skiing behind her.
She was drunk or whatever.

240
00:14:19.991 --> 00:14:23.140
I came and what the fuck she was saying cause it was such a spectacle watching

241
00:14:23.141 --> 00:14:28.141
that guy trying to hold her back as she was like climbing forward it,

242
00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:30.030
you know what it looked like.
It looked like,
you know,

243
00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:32.940
like wartime footage when they like split up families.

244
00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:35.740
It looked like she was trying to get back to her child like that.

245
00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:39.780
That was the level of effort that she was making just to come up to me to tell

246
00:14:39.781 --> 00:14:44.370
me how much of a fucking model moron she thought I was.

247
00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:47.380
<v 2>And,
uh,</v>

248
00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:52.220
<v 1>that was a good night's comedy.
I do remember that.</v>

249
00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:54.620
<v 2>I just don't remember what I said or what she said.</v>

250
00:14:57.990 --> 00:15:02.080
I had that one,
this is weird.
They're all coming to their like faceless,

251
00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:05.160
like they're like,
you know,
like when you watch like psycho,

252
00:15:05.161 --> 00:15:09.600
when he comes in with the knife and you can't see his face,
spoiler alert,

253
00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:14.280
you can't see his face.
Um,
that's what they kind of looked like to me anyways.

254
00:15:14.281 --> 00:15:16.920
I don't want to dwell on this shit any longer,
but,
uh,
anyways,

255
00:15:16.921 --> 00:15:17.970
if for whatever reason,

256
00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:22.170
if that woman who didn't laugh once is still listening to this,
uh,

257
00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:27.240
I dunno.
I Dunno what you want for me.
I would,
you know something,

258
00:15:27.241 --> 00:15:30.270
I would go to the all things comedy network.
We have plenty of podcasts.

259
00:15:30.271 --> 00:15:33.150
I'm sure there's something else that you could find there.
By the way,

260
00:15:33.151 --> 00:15:36.440
the podcast network,
uh,
the all things comedy podcast network,
uh,

261
00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:39.630
the first annual,
um,

262
00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:42.510
podcast festival was a smashing success.

263
00:15:42.511 --> 00:15:45.660
We got rave reviews from everybody came out.
I really want to thank everybody.

264
00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:50.900
And then also Irish affair who was just sort of the mayor of the podcast

265
00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:55.390
festival where he got in Thursday,
he jumped on everybody's podcast,
teach us,

266
00:15:55.391 --> 00:15:59.220
was used just the fucking greatest guy ever.
Um,

267
00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:01.140
so anyways,
with that,

268
00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:06.170
how can I go this far into my podcast and not mention the first world

269
00:16:06.811 --> 00:16:11.550
championship ever by the Houston Astros?
How great is that?

270
00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:17.490
That was such a great thing.
That was as great to see as it was sad for la.
Yeah.

271
00:16:17.491 --> 00:16:20.790
I'm telling you,
you gotta hate that somebody has to lose a game.

272
00:16:20.791 --> 00:16:21.900
Seven is just brutal.

273
00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:25.290
I was actually sitting there thinking how cool it would be to actually see magic

274
00:16:25.291 --> 00:16:29.550
Johnson.
He's got an NBA NBA ring and a world series ring.

275
00:16:29.551 --> 00:16:32.010
This does anybody,
a sports nerds,

276
00:16:32.011 --> 00:16:35.400
anybody know anybody out there on both of those rinks?

277
00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:41.130
I'm thinking back in the day,
maybe somebody won the football and the baseball.

278
00:16:41.131 --> 00:16:44.520
That was like a big thing for you or two sport guy in those sports didn't really

279
00:16:44.521 --> 00:16:48.830
overlap that you could possibly win two titles.
Um,

280
00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:54.180
but,
uh,
I don't know about a fucking stomach is growling,

281
00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:57.660
trying to stay in shape,
but like three more days in this fucking movie.

282
00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:03.330
So you wanna fucking days.
I actually,
I actually brought in a Caesar Salad.

283
00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:08.700
I'm going to say that one more time.
A Caesar's salad.
Okay.

284
00:17:08.701 --> 00:17:12.030
And I always want to do that because I love when people start yelling at you

285
00:17:12.031 --> 00:17:16.350
about the amount of calories and the dressing and the crew tons and Yada Yada

286
00:17:16.351 --> 00:17:21.180
and all of that fucking Shit and how you might as well have had a steak.
Um,

287
00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:25.270
I think all of that is bullshit.
Okay.

288
00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:29.800
She's still have the lettuce with all the fucking,
you know,

289
00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:34.860
pesticides on it,
you know,
I mean,

290
00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:36.230
that's a decision you have to make right now.

291
00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:39.440
Do I want to eat a cow that ate another cow,

292
00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:45.220
was with hormones in it or do I want to eat this thing that was sprayed by DDT

293
00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:49.500
or whatever the fuck is in this shit.
Um,
the end of the day,

294
00:17:49.501 --> 00:17:51.510
if you're gonna eat bad,
if there's a fucking salad,

295
00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:58.160
I mean I'll go with the cancerous pesticides as probably worse to eat one of

296
00:17:58.161 --> 00:18:01.010
those things,
but I don't want to hear this shit about the fucking dressing.

297
00:18:02.090 --> 00:18:04.580
I didn't want,
I didn't want to fuck,
I don't hear a word about that.
Okay.

298
00:18:04.790 --> 00:18:08.750
Cause I know I feel after I eat is fucking Caesar's salad versus how I feel if I

299
00:18:08.751 --> 00:18:13.520
eat a steak,
you know,
with a couple of sides.
The Fuck Outta here.

300
00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:19.700
That's it.
That is it.
I'm fucking grabbing at my pants like Matt Foley

301
00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:26.720
and I,
I have a gut for like three days after that.

302
00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:30.620
Um,
I know it's all fucking bad for you.
Who gives a shit?

303
00:18:30.621 --> 00:18:32.930
I just need to hit the elliptical.
Um,

304
00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:38.500
I started my physical therapy for my rotator cuff injury finally.

305
00:18:38.541 --> 00:18:40.640
I don't know why it took so long.
Like how long if I do that,

306
00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:43.100
he goes through these exercise three times a day.
I go,
when should,
when,

307
00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:47.120
how long should it say sky's like when I was six weeks typical German,
Irish,

308
00:18:47.121 --> 00:18:50.510
stupid freckled count.
I've been dealing with this for a year and a half,

309
00:18:50.511 --> 00:18:53.600
like an asshole.
I could've just gone to somebody,

310
00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:58.460
a goddamn physical therapists.
This is,
yes,
we deal with this all the time.

311
00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:02.690
This is what works.
Do this
see in a week.

312
00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:06.890
So I'm very excited.
My shoulder actually feels a little bit better.
Um,

313
00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:11.390
although being out in this Iowa,
whether,
fortunately I checked,
um,

314
00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:15.290
I check the weather before it came out here,
cause I wouldn't,
you know,

315
00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:18.380
live in an La,
you don't think it's just endless summer out.

316
00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:20.060
They sometimes you forget what time of year it is.

317
00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:23.570
I actually brought a pea coat out here and I gotta tell you it's fucking killing

318
00:19:23.571 --> 00:19:26.480
my shoulder to put it on and off.
Um,

319
00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:30.830
had had dean helped me put my coat back on after we ate the worst fucking,

320
00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:35.180
the worst fucking meal I've had since I was with Dean del Rey again when I was

321
00:19:35.181 --> 00:19:37.640
in Wyoming and we ate and this little diner.

322
00:19:37.641 --> 00:19:40.130
And I think that the short order cook wasn't there that day.

323
00:19:40.131 --> 00:19:43.250
And I wanted two eggs over easy.
They came,
they were like clear.

324
00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:48.650
It looked like fucking breast implants with Yolk in the middle of it.
What?

325
00:19:48.651 --> 00:19:50.840
This fucking Guy Brian.
I still ate him cause I was hungry.

326
00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:54.530
I remember the waitress came by,
she was just like,
was was that all right?

327
00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:58.580
And I was just like,
yeah,
it's fine.
And um,

328
00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:04.230
this time we were walking a,
I can't even tell you

329
00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:08.040
the name of the airline that we fucking took in here.

330
00:20:08.041 --> 00:20:10.950
I don't even know the name of it.
It was,

331
00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:17.640
it was a play on like air force one
like the president.
Hang on one second.

332
00:20:17.641 --> 00:20:22.280
Let me see if I can find this shit.
Oh fuck you pot.

333
00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:28.300
All right,
here we go.
Here we go.
Andy.
Uh,

334
00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:29.840
to the,
what the fuck is it?

335
00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:35.220
When a fuck is my,
you don't want it didn't want us on the plane.

336
00:20:35.221 --> 00:20:39.310
I deleted like a hundred fucking text messages.
You know,

337
00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:41.220
you have that thing like,
oh my God,
I can't delete it.

338
00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:46.080
If I deleted then I don't have the thread like you're trying some case.

339
00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:49.840
I just started deleting a bunch of them,
you know,
it felt good.
All right,

340
00:20:49.841 --> 00:20:54.100
here we go.
What is the name of this fucking thing?
Air Choice One.

341
00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:55.910
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

342
00:20:55.910 --> 00:20:57.930
<v 2>You know,
we couldn't even pre check in for this thing.</v>

343
00:20:58.010 --> 00:21:01.310
You had to walk to the gate.
We were in Minneapolis and it was just like,

344
00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:03.710
we just kept walking.

345
00:21:03.711 --> 00:21:05.840
And why don't know why we didn't take the little monorail thing.

346
00:21:05.841 --> 00:21:09.590
We just kept walking and walking and was in concourse B,

347
00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:14.090
which was like you went down some stairs and walked underneath the fucking

348
00:21:14.091 --> 00:21:19.000
tarmac or some shit
to get over to this other side.

349
00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:22.330
And uh,
but it was still cool as shit.

350
00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:25.300
And then when we landed in like the mid city airport,

351
00:21:25.301 --> 00:21:28.960
I think that's what's called,
I don't know what the fuck it's called,

352
00:21:28.961 --> 00:21:32.620
but it was a cool as shit airport.

353
00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:36.340
You just walk right in to gate agents.

354
00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:40.360
This like 12 chairs down near the baggage claims.

355
00:21:40.361 --> 00:21:45.150
I love little airports.
Um,
anyways,

356
00:21:45.151 --> 00:21:48.760
so we were,
we're on our way over there and I had the worst fucking

357
00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:53.930
food that I've had since when I was in Cheyenne,
Wyoming.

358
00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:56.060
And I know that place is better than what it was.

359
00:21:56.061 --> 00:21:58.820
I just was went there on a bad day.
I'm not shitting on Wyoming.

360
00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.330
I'm not shitting on Cheyenne.
All right.

361
00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:07.070
Um,
I got the meatloaf with the mashed potatoes.

362
00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:08.440
<v 0>Okay.</v>

363
00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:12.490
<v 2>All right.
And Spinach and a,</v>

364
00:22:12.491 --> 00:22:14.530
and I wanna hear when you talk about red meat and a starch,

365
00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:18.310
everybody knows it's shut the fuck up.
All right.
I like potatoes with the meat.

366
00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:22.510
I don't give a shit.
So they put this mushroom gravy on top of it.

367
00:22:22.511 --> 00:22:24.610
I swear to God it tastes,
I don't know.

368
00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:29.620
It tastes like somebody just took an aerosol can and sprayed it.

369
00:22:29.650 --> 00:22:33.160
It had like a chemical taste to it.
It was so fucking bad.
I was like,
Dean,

370
00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:37.180
tasteless,
tasteless.
Seems just,
you know,
just like,
what the fuck?
I was like,

371
00:22:37.181 --> 00:22:40.780
I know.
Then you know what fixes everything?

372
00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:44.710
What is the duct tape of food?
Huh?

373
00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:48.130
Like if you're in construction,
right?
If you have a problem,
duck it,
right.

374
00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:50.080
You take out the duct tape,
you fucking,
you know,

375
00:22:50.081 --> 00:22:54.220
wrap it around a few times and you find what is the duct tape of food?
Everybody,

376
00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:57.790
we all know it.
We all love it.
Salt,

377
00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:01.810
salted the shit out of it.
Salt couldn't even help it.

378
00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:04.120
I had to go for ketchup.

379
00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:10.420
I had to put salt and catch up on this fucking,
I just finally had to tap out.
Um,

380
00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:13.750
and I always,
whenever the waitress comes over says,
how was the food?

381
00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:17.140
Even if it sucks,
I say,
how are you going?
You see shows I always at,

382
00:23:17.141 --> 00:23:20.350
I always say it was good.
It was good.
Thank you.
Um,

383
00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:25.030
I even said it was good when I had the breast implant fucking eggs over easy.

384
00:23:25.031 --> 00:23:28.300
Right?
And this was the time I was going to be like,

385
00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:31.330
if she asked me how this is,
I'm going to say this is,
I'm,

386
00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:35.820
I'm just gonna say this tastes like,
this is like,
I dunno what,

387
00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:39.690
like,
like homeless,
like you some homeless guy soak his feet in it.

388
00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:44.960
I was actually just sitting there waiting for the waitress to come

389
00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:49.880
thinking,
how can I accurately describe how fucking horrific.

390
00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:54.620
And if you're in Minneapolis in Minneapolis and you're going to take air choice

391
00:23:54.621 --> 00:23:55.820
one airlines,

392
00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:59.570
there's a fucking restaurant right to the left brake before you go down the

393
00:23:59.571 --> 00:24:02.810
escalators of don't get the meatloaf with the gravy.

394
00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:06.610
All right,
spoiler alert.

395
00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:10.753
<v 0>Okay.</v>

396
00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:16.220
<v 2>Oh my God.
What was it?
Chemical is the only way to describe it.
It wasn't like,</v>

397
00:24:16.221 --> 00:24:18.260
what is that ingredient?
You're like truffle oil.

398
00:24:18.261 --> 00:24:21.110
Truffle oil is fucking obnoxious.
It just,

399
00:24:21.111 --> 00:24:25.280
it just overwhelms anything that it's on.
It's never always there.

400
00:24:25.281 --> 00:24:29.120
Truffle oil in here.
It's how much truffle oil is in this fucking thing.

401
00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:32.000
It's undeniable.
This taste.
I,
I,
you know,

402
00:24:33.390 --> 00:24:33.800
<v 0>yeah.</v>

403
00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:36.020
<v 2>I wish I could've brought it to one of those cooking shows.
You know,</v>

404
00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:38.050
those fucking guys would like [inaudible] women.

405
00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:42.720
They got like those pallets going,
okay.
Okay.
Um,
I'm tasting a little Oregano.
Um,

406
00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:43.753
and uh,

407
00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:48.850
there's chocolates or like those of noxious cigar videos with those Douche bags,

408
00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:52.070
those fucking Douche bags

409
00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:57.260
sit there smoking a cigar.
That is one of the most like,
Ugh,

410
00:24:57.830 --> 00:24:59.750
one more sec noxious things you will ever see.

411
00:24:59.751 --> 00:25:03.920
Put on a youtube video and watch a guy do a review of a fucking cigar.

412
00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:09.290
I fucking hate I when they see that this chart,
I'm tasting chocolate.

413
00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:12.980
It tasted chocolate in the smoke.
You Fat.
Fuck.

414
00:25:14.470 --> 00:25:16.670
What did you just go to friendly's.
He needed Jim Dandy.

415
00:25:16.671 --> 00:25:19.840
Who the fuck tastes chocolate?
What do you you,

416
00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:23.810
you fucking smoke at one of those cigars that they have dipped in like that

417
00:25:23.811 --> 00:25:27.110
sugary shit you've ever at some fucking guy with his sweet tooth gives you a

418
00:25:27.111 --> 00:25:28.040
goddamn cigar.

419
00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:30.410
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

420
00:25:30.410 --> 00:25:33.260
<v 2>You got to go to like the dentist the next day.
All right.</v>

421
00:25:33.261 --> 00:25:37.280
I gotta I gotta pick this up.
I gotta go.
I'm actually a couple of minutes later,

422
00:25:37.281 --> 00:25:39.470
I gotta go.
I'm,
when I,
when I returned,

423
00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:44.330
I will tell you what it was like to perform at the legendary surf ballroom for

424
00:25:44.331 --> 00:25:47.030
me.
It's giving me an hour and a half for you.
It's going to be a mere second

425
00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:54.730
and a bag just like that.
Just like that.
Two seconds of your life.

426
00:25:55.570 --> 00:25:59.350
A good fucking,
uh,
I don't know what that was.
Three,
four hours of my life.

427
00:25:59.351 --> 00:26:03.730
I just performed at the serve ballroom.
Clear Lake,
Iowa.

428
00:26:05.410 --> 00:26:07.240
Um,
unbelievable.

429
00:26:08.670 --> 00:26:08.880
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

430
00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:13.880
<v 2>one of the coolest and and also like a spooky as places I've ever performed at a</v>

431
00:26:14.970 --> 00:26:19.000
,
so here's the deal.
You dry,
you pull up,

432
00:26:19.090 --> 00:26:20.260
it looks like

433
00:26:22.290 --> 00:26:27.290
it looks like it's from the 1950s you walk in the exact same door.

434
00:26:27.991 --> 00:26:31.380
They all walked in and there was this little green room area.

435
00:26:31.381 --> 00:26:33.960
It looks like they used to be a bathroom back there too.

436
00:26:33.961 --> 00:26:38.961
They kind of just got rid of that and they had a couple of sinks I guess that

437
00:26:39.331 --> 00:26:40.470
they use to some shit.

438
00:26:40.471 --> 00:26:43.740
And everybody's autograph these walls and I'm sure that that's like the fifth

439
00:26:43.741 --> 00:26:47.070
time they probably painted over the party paint over like once every decade.

440
00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:51.780
And they just keep like these big people like a
Willie Nelson,

441
00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:55.260
Merle haggard,
Waylon Jennings of course.

442
00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:59.790
And then all these other people I saw,
you know,
all the guys from like skid row,

443
00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:03.690
bunch of bands that I knew from the eighties and nineties,

444
00:27:03.691 --> 00:27:08.070
early nineties that I used to listen to do faster pussycat,
all of them.
Uh,

445
00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:12.660
who else?
Just a whole bunch of people.
So anyways,

446
00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:16.410
you go out there and I'm telling you man,
it's like this giant.

447
00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:18.700
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

448
00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:20.050
<v 2>Looks like it's not a happy days.</v>

449
00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:25.680
And what they did is they had the original stage and then they built out from

450
00:27:26.531 --> 00:27:27.460
the original stage.

451
00:27:27.461 --> 00:27:32.290
But some women a number of years ago actually had photos from that night and she

452
00:27:32.291 --> 00:27:35.020
found them all these years later.
So you can actually tell where the stage was.

453
00:27:35.021 --> 00:27:38.530
So I made sure when I was up there,
I walked all the way back to what they have.

454
00:27:38.531 --> 00:27:43.531
Like the phone where Richie Valens and buddy Holly made their last phone calls.

455
00:27:43.991 --> 00:27:48.990
It's really,
I mean it's,
it's,
it's,
it's this weird thing of like,

456
00:27:50.010 --> 00:27:51.840
like,
uh,

457
00:27:52.170 --> 00:27:55.530
an incredible part of history and like really morbid.

458
00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:58.193
<v 3>MMM.</v>

459
00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:02.020
<v 1>I Dunno.
And I'm always interested in that type of shit.
And then it's also weird,</v>

460
00:28:02.021 --> 00:28:04.450
like I went to Elvis's house and I remember going in there,

461
00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:07.810
I was a young comic and I wanted to go in and laugh like,
oh,

462
00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:10.450
look at his shag carpet with the folks up with Elvis.

463
00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:13.300
And I went in there and I actually felt bad after awhile.
I was like,
I'm going,

464
00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:16.870
I'm in this guy's house.
This is what this guy used to chill out and shit.

465
00:28:16.871 --> 00:28:21.460
I feel like,
you know,
this is uh,
you know,

466
00:28:21.461 --> 00:28:23.980
and then the end,
you walking by his grave and shit,
it's like,

467
00:28:23.981 --> 00:28:26.170
can we just leave this guy alone already?
Cause they haven't,

468
00:28:26.171 --> 00:28:29.080
they made enough fucking money and then you go across the street,

469
00:28:29.081 --> 00:28:31.870
there's a gift shop.
They literally made a cuckoo clock,
you know,

470
00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:34.210
is it looked like his,
his hips will move it and shit.

471
00:28:35.050 --> 00:28:38.620
But the way they did it here was very like respectful.
But um,

472
00:28:39.610 --> 00:28:43.300
it's Kinda hard to not feel like a little bit of a Google when you go there.

473
00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:45.910
I'm a little bit of a Glenham death is,
is interesting.

474
00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:48.113
<v 2>You know,</v>

475
00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:52.720
<v 1>dead rockstars are interesting.
They're all right.
And I was interested in,</v>

476
00:28:52.721 --> 00:28:55.690
I went and I got to perform there and stand on the stage.
It was fucking amazing.

477
00:28:56.380 --> 00:29:01.060
And everybody coming out in the show was fucking crowd was awesome.

478
00:29:01.090 --> 00:29:05.800
I'm telling you all you fucking elitists,
liberal cons,
who live near an ocean,

479
00:29:05.801 --> 00:29:10.210

482
00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:19.940
You're missing out by not going out into the coast rights.

483
00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:23.470
Everybody fucking grow up cause there's fun to be had out there.

484
00:29:23.471 --> 00:29:24.304
You know what I mean?

485
00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:26.033
<v 3>MMM.</v>

486
00:29:26.050 --> 00:29:28.840
<v 1>You know,
it was funny when I was on the plane ride over,
this woman's going,</v>

487
00:29:28.841 --> 00:29:32.170
I was like,
she's like,
it's one of the most friendliest places.
Everybody waves.

488
00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:34.540
Hello,
everybody is just really friendly out here.
You know,
of course,

489
00:29:34.541 --> 00:29:35.770
in my head I'm thinking,
yeah,
if you're white,

490
00:29:41.650 --> 00:29:42.190
<v 3>I'm not seeing</v>

491
00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:46.990
<v 1>a black guy can't come out here.
But if a certain amount came out here,
you know,</v>

492
00:29:46.991 --> 00:29:50.650
and they weren't going to fucking play for Iowa or Iowa state,

493
00:29:50.651 --> 00:29:55.570
there'd be some issues.
Um,
you know,

494
00:29:55.600 --> 00:30:00.310
it's,
I don't know why,
but that's the way the world is.
All right,
let's,
uh,

495
00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:01.750
let's do a little,
uh,
oh yeah.

496
00:30:01.751 --> 00:30:06.370
And then we came back to the hotel and ran into this fucking guy and he came up

497
00:30:06.371 --> 00:30:08.680
to me,
he's gonna let people keep saying that,
you know,
I look at,

498
00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:13.480

And I was just like,

499
00:30:13.481 --> 00:30:16.750
I would take that as an insult.
I go,
you're a better looking version of me.
Just,

500
00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:20.600
you know,
big,
tall drunk guy.

501
00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:23.740
He just compliment just fucking whatever he wants to hear.

502
00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:27.920
Get him the fuck away from me.
Right.
But it's still funny guy.
And he just,

503
00:30:28.490 --> 00:30:31.130
he was very like,
uh,
talked with his hands and shit.

504
00:30:31.131 --> 00:30:35.720
And he was just this giant 20 years younger me with hair.

505
00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:37.813
<v 0>And</v>

506
00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:41.840
<v 1>I finally just,
I couldn't take it anymore.
I finally just said to him,
I said,</v>

507
00:30:41.841 --> 00:30:46.760

He goes,

00:30:51.870 --> 00:30:52.703
And he walked away.

00:30:57.290 --> 00:30:59.990
Oh,

558
00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:56.300
right?
You macgyver haircut you David Hasselhoff hair cut.

559
00:33:56.301 --> 00:34:00.740
I'm not talking about that when I'm talking about as a ride service.
Lyft,
l,

560
00:34:00.741 --> 00:34:03.980
I.
F.
T.
Lyft knows that their drivers are what?
Keep them moving.

561
00:34:05.030 --> 00:34:07.940
They do everything they can to make sure that their drivers are happy on every

562
00:34:07.941 --> 00:34:08.774
trip.

563
00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:13.820
Lyft is the ride sharing company that believes in treating it's people better.

564
00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:19.940
I believe if elected lift believes that being,
there's a lot of beliefs here,

565
00:34:19.941 --> 00:34:22.730
believes in being a ride,
sharing dry,

566
00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:27.770
that being a ride sharing drivers should be fun.
If you're having a good time,

567
00:34:27.830 --> 00:34:31.080
so are the passengers.
Wait,
don't enjoy yourself too much there buddy.

568
00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:34.580
He got my life in your hands.
They're okay enough with the jokes.

569
00:34:34.581 --> 00:34:35.990
Turn around and look at the fucking road here.

570
00:34:36.830 --> 00:34:41.270
Lyft was the first to offer in ad typic.
When you drive for Lyft,

571
00:34:41.271 --> 00:34:42.860
you keep 100% of the tips.

572
00:34:43.430 --> 00:34:46.700
Drivers have been paid over $200 million in tips since the feature was

573
00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:47.630
introduced.

574
00:34:48.140 --> 00:34:52.970
Express pay lets drivers get paid almost instantly instead of waiting for weeks.

575
00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:55.310
Lyft has even taken the guesswork out of pickups.

576
00:34:55.490 --> 00:34:59.930
The new amp device uses color coding to help pass.
Just find their drivers.

577
00:34:59.931 --> 00:35:03.200
You can earn hundreds of dollars a week plus tips.
One,
earn more money,

578
00:35:03.201 --> 00:35:06.200
drive more.
It's never been easier to give yourself a raise.

579
00:35:06.201 --> 00:35:09.290
It's a simple formula.
Happy drivers mean happy passengers.

580
00:35:09.291 --> 00:35:13.640
Maybe that's why nine out of 10 Lyft riders get a perfect five star rating.

581
00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:16.640
Plus people usually to mean to say that they stunk.

582
00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:20.030
Kind of like how you know I was finally going to say something about that

583
00:35:20.031 --> 00:35:24.410
fucking meatloaf with the mosquito spray on it.

584
00:35:24.890 --> 00:35:26.580
So joining the ride sharing comes.

585
00:35:26.581 --> 00:35:28.780
So join the ride sharing company that believes in treating people,

586
00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:30.470
treating gets people better.

587
00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:35.540

I Dunno.
Pro Flowers.

592

if you know any of those people who are obsessed with fall,

things like pumpkin spice lattes and scented candles.

595

Pro Flowers has the perfect gift.
A pistol with one bullet in it?

fall colors there.

Best selling cinnamon cider roses are a great option for birthday and

anniversary or any fall occasion or go with one of the classics like 100 autumn

<v 0>Okay,</v>

607
00:36:50.590 --> 00:36:53.150
<v 1>I'm just going to pause here because I don't think they ever really listened.</v>

608
00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:58.010
Why would you have autumn?
This is off the record here.

609
00:36:58.070 --> 00:36:59.540
If I can just speak off the record here.

610
00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:04.620
Why the fuck would you have an autumn theme with flowers?

611
00:37:04.621 --> 00:37:08.700
That's when everything fucking dies,
right?
It doesn't make any fucking sense.

612
00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:11.050
All right.
He likes everybody [inaudible].

613
00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:15.090
There are a ton of online mattress retailers popping up these days.

614
00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:19.410
All with a one size fits all solution to a better sleep.
Well guess what?

615
00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:22.800
One size fits all doesn't fucking work.

616
00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:26.980
All right?
I don't give a shit what those other mattress companies tell you,
okay?

617
00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:31.010
He looks helix.
They know what they're talking about.
He looks sleep opera,

618
00:37:31.050 --> 00:37:33.510
something that doesn't exist anywhere else.
Um,

619
00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:38.310
mattress personalized to your unique preferences and sleeping style that won't

620
00:37:38.311 --> 00:37:40.140
set you back thousands of dollars.

621
00:37:40.350 --> 00:37:43.560
Go to [inaudible] dot com slash Pir way your junk.

622
00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:47.340
Find which way it swings when you go to rollover and they'll have a little

623
00:37:47.341 --> 00:37:50.640
fucking pill that sewn into the mattress to catch it.

624
00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:55.180
<v 0>Okay?</v>

625
00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:56.013
<v 1>Sorry.</v>

626
00:37:56.190 --> 00:38:00.160
A mattress personalized to your unique preferences and sleeping style that won't

627
00:38:00.161 --> 00:38:04.990
set you back.
Thousands of dollars.
Go to a helix,
sleep.com/burr.

628
00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:09.550
Take their simple two to three minutes sleep quiz of somebody who had the right

629
00:38:09.551 --> 00:38:13.240
debt.
Why don't we do a benefit for that fucking person?

630
00:38:13.241 --> 00:38:14.830
They're always talking about people who have diseases.

631
00:38:14.831 --> 00:38:17.560
What about the person has to sit down and come up with a fucking quiz about a

632
00:38:17.561 --> 00:38:21.820
mattress is what I went to college for.
This is why I'm buried in debt.

633
00:38:22.690 --> 00:38:26.530
They'll build a custom matte.
Despite people drink,
they build a custom mattress.

634
00:38:26.531 --> 00:38:29.470
That will be the best thing you've ever slept on.
For couples,

635
00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:32.860
they even personalize each side of the mattress,

636
00:38:32.861 --> 00:38:34.840
which we all know is the beginning of the end of the fucking.

637
00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:41.320
I just feel like we're not connecting everyone from Gq to cosmopolitan to New

638
00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:44.860
York Times.
We're all talking about helix and once you try it out,

639
00:38:44.861 --> 00:38:45.460
you'll know why.

640
00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:49.960
Your customer mattress arrives direct to your door in a week and shipping is

641
00:38:49.961 --> 00:38:51.010
completely free.

642
00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:54.850
Just make sure you're home and they deliver it so someone else isn't sleeping on

643
00:38:54.851 --> 00:38:58.690
it and this fucking economy,
try it for 100 nights.
If you don't love it,

644
00:38:58.691 --> 00:39:01.840
they'll pick it up and you and refunded.
They'll pick it up.

645
00:39:02.290 --> 00:39:07.290
Gross and refund you in full CTA must read.

646
00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:11.200
Now let's call to action in the advertising world.
Go to helix,

647
00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:16.240
sleep.com/burger right now and you get $50 towards your custom mattress sets.

648
00:39:16.570 --> 00:39:20.650

sleep.com/burr for $50 off your order.
One more time.

649
00:39:21.970 --> 00:39:26.350
Helix,
sleep.com/burn oh lastly,
but not leastly,

650
00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:30.640
stamps.com and everybody,
the headliner,
they always go and last.

651
00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:34.000
Stay stamps.
Save you time and money.
Yeah,

652
00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:36.640
you don't have to walk over to somebody.
You can fucking put a piece,

653
00:39:36.641 --> 00:39:37.474
a little thing on there.

654
00:39:38.110 --> 00:39:41.970
And then the person with the little blue short shows up and they take it,
um,

655
00:39:41.980 --> 00:39:44.620
which you make.
Okay.
Which you can use to grow your business.

656
00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:46.120
I can mail any letter,

657
00:39:46.210 --> 00:39:51.210
any package using just to my computer and my printer and mail them in the mail.

658
00:39:51.550 --> 00:39:52.240
Man picks it up.

659
00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:56.830
The mail man picks it up right and mail lady shows up in a little fan,

660
00:39:57.500 --> 00:40:01.800
you know,
all dainty ride.
Sidesaddle avoid,
you know,

661
00:40:01.810 --> 00:40:05.590
pushing the fucking gas and the brake with little selfie stick.
Sorry,

662
00:40:05.591 --> 00:40:06.850
I live in La.
That's how it's done.

663
00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:11.080
Avoid the hassle of the post office man and mail everything from postcards to

664
00:40:11.081 --> 00:40:13.570
envelopes to packages,
domestic or international.

665
00:40:13.571 --> 00:40:18.520
Create your stamp account in minutes online with no equipment to lease and no

666
00:40:19.030 --> 00:40:22.930
longterm commitments.
I use stamps.com anytime I send out any of my posters,

667
00:40:22.931 --> 00:40:27.250
whenever I'm going to whore myself out after my shows,
I am a moron.

668
00:40:27.251 --> 00:40:31.180
If I can figure out how to use this device.
So can you,

672
00:40:45.550 --> 00:40:49.000
We a go when?
No where you ever see that?

673
00:40:49.310 --> 00:40:53.390
Me a Gif jiff whatever the fuck you call it.

674
00:40:53.410 --> 00:40:55.000
Go to stamps.com click on the

675
00:41:00.250 --> 00:41:00.520
microphone@thetopofthehomepageandtypeinbirdthatstampsdotcomenterburststamps.com

676
00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:04.630
never go to the post office again.
What was that Jif?

677
00:41:04.660 --> 00:41:08.670
Remember that something,
uh,
what you,

678
00:41:08.890 --> 00:41:11.380
you know when the woman's like,
where is this relationship going to?

679
00:41:11.381 --> 00:41:16.200
And then they cut to that old p diddy song.
We a go when?
No,

680
00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:21.700
where we a go.
No Web.
Um,
that's it.

681
00:41:21.930 --> 00:41:24.990
All right.
I think that's the podcast.
I had such a great time and uh,

682
00:41:25.070 --> 00:41:27.610
it came out and got to meet a bunch of people afterwards.
A lot of people,

683
00:41:28.030 --> 00:41:32.200
some people came in from Colorado,
people came in from all around.
Um,

684
00:41:33.110 --> 00:41:34.010
just to check out the

685
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:35.750
<v 2>venue.
That's what I liked about the show tonight.</v>

686
00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:38.000
I had a great time and I also feel there was a bunch of people that have never

687
00:41:38.001 --> 00:41:41.630
been to that venue venue before.
So they got more than a show.

688
00:41:41.631 --> 00:41:45.620
They also got to see that part of rock and roll history.
Uh,

689
00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:49.480
I mean in the pictures in there,
the people that have played there,
it's,

690
00:41:49.670 --> 00:41:54.530
it's unbelievable.
Before,
you know,
all of those guys

691
00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:58.220
Ritchie Valens at all,
those guys play.
They're like Duke Ellington.

692
00:41:58.221 --> 00:42:03.020
They have a piano that Duke Ellington Plate,
like sitting in the fucking lobby.

693
00:42:05.140 --> 00:42:05.973
<v 3>MMM.</v>

694
00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:11.100
<v 2>It's incredible.
And it's beautiful out here and that's it.</v>

695
00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:15.780
I feel like I brought America together with this show.
You know,

696
00:42:16.110 --> 00:42:18.540
I live out in liberal Hollywood where,
you know,

697
00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:24.680
we believe and we know that we are better than anybody else in this country

698
00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:30.560
because we live near an ocean and we make movies about social issues to show

699
00:42:31.501 --> 00:42:35.820
that we care before returning back to our gated communities.

700
00:42:36.690 --> 00:42:37.523
<v 3>You know,</v>

701
00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:41.320
<v 2>and we only wish that the rest of the country would catch up with us.</v>

702
00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:48.470
Um,
I'm fucking with you anyways.
That's it.
I'm on my way til two,
uh,

703
00:42:48.540 --> 00:42:50.610
Milwaukee,
Wisconsin tomorrow.

704
00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:52.973
<v 3>MMM.</v>

705
00:42:53.010 --> 00:42:57.630
<v 2>One of my favorite fucking cities.
And uh,
I'll tell you all about that on Monday.</v>

706
00:42:57.631 --> 00:42:59.250
And then I'm going up to green bay now.

707
00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:03.480
I was supposed to hang around and go to the bump bump up Monday night football

708
00:43:03.481 --> 00:43:04.750
game.
That's why we booked that one.

709
00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:07.193
<v 3>MMM.</v>

710
00:43:07.490 --> 00:43:10.520
<v 2>But,
um,
well actually it's a good thing.
I mean,
I've got an acting Gig,</v>

711
00:43:10.521 --> 00:43:14.330
so I have to leave after the show to do my last three days on a movie called

712
00:43:14.331 --> 00:43:18.330
front runner starring Hugh Jackman.
It's the Gary Hart Story.
Uh,

713
00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:21.620
it's directed by Jason Reitman.
I'm already promoting it.

714
00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:23.690
They're not even done shooting and I'm already promoting it.

715
00:43:23.691 --> 00:43:27.080
That's how great of an employee.
I am.
A,
it's going to come out next year.

716
00:43:27.081 --> 00:43:31.040
I've already seen like the dailies,
it looks,
it looks frigging amazing.
Um,

717
00:43:31.041 --> 00:43:32.780
so I'm not gonna be able to get to go to the game,
but,
uh,

718
00:43:33.410 --> 00:43:34.161
Aaron Rodgers is hurt anyways,

719
00:43:34.161 --> 00:43:38.240
but I've only been to Lambeau field and went there a long time ago.

720
00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:43.700
It was actually,
I've explained this skyline cafe in Appleton,
Wisconsin and

721
00:43:44.530 --> 00:43:45.363
<v 3>mmm,</v>

722
00:43:45.940 --> 00:43:50.940
<v 2>Green Bay had a preseason game against the Cleveland browns and Brett Farve was</v>

723
00:43:52.601 --> 00:43:53.980
still there.
That's how long ago this was.

724
00:43:54.430 --> 00:43:56.950
Brett Farve was still there and nobody was talking about him retiring.

725
00:43:56.951 --> 00:43:59.870
It was Brett Farve and,
uh,

726
00:43:59.950 --> 00:44:03.700
he played like the first quarter,
maybe into the second quarter.

727
00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:07.100
So I got to see him play a little bit there.
I know it was just preseason,

728
00:44:07.150 --> 00:44:10.330
so I kind of wanted to go back there for a legit game,
but,
uh,

729
00:44:10.331 --> 00:44:13.090
it didn't work out on this trip,
but,
uh,
it's already been awesome,

730
00:44:13.091 --> 00:44:17.220
so thank you to everybody came up,
enjoy the music.
Uh,
and with them.

731
00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:20.510
List the producer of the Monday morning podcast and Thursday afternoon just Uber

732
00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:23.860
fired him.
More questions.
Sometimes I don't want to say the whole thing.

733
00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:27.820
He's going to play some music here and then we'll listen to you listen to an old

734
00:44:27.821 --> 00:44:31.660
podcast from a Thursday from a year gone by or possibly earlier year and now I'm

735
00:44:31.661 --> 00:44:32.160
done talking.

736
00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:33.510
<v 1>Go fuck yourselves.
Have a great weekend.</v>

737
00:44:33.580 --> 00:44:36.060
You cunts and I'll talk to you on Monday.

738
00:45:11.300 --> 00:45:12.133
<v 0>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

739
00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:35.170
[inaudible]
[inaudible].

740
00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:40.900
<v 4>It's kind of this his wife.
What's her name there?
Heather Mills.</v>

741
00:45:41.250 --> 00:45:44.650
I'll read this real fast.
It's short a wife to start.
Paul.
It's short.

742
00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:48.340
It was the pot or May.
Yeah.

743
00:45:48.550 --> 00:45:50.740
Listen to this or me.

744
00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:53.890
Heather Mills said she gave Sir Paul Mccartney a strict ultimatum.

745
00:45:53.891 --> 00:45:58.210
As the relationship blossomed,
quit smoking marijuana.
Marijuana.
Excuse me.

746
00:45:58.390 --> 00:46:01.330
Or forget walking down the aisle.
Huh?

747
00:46:01.420 --> 00:46:05.200
I told him I would not get married to him if he was taking drugs.
I hate it.

748
00:46:05.201 --> 00:46:08.350
Heather.
37 told London's observe our newspaper.

749
00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:13.210
I could not have him lying to our child about not taking drugs and then going

750
00:46:13.211 --> 00:46:16.690
out for a sneaky puff.
He says he had a good incentive,

751
00:46:18.130 --> 00:46:22.750
a good incentive to stop smoking pot.
Her ultimatum.
Yeah.

752
00:46:23.230 --> 00:46:25.270
You don't give a beetle and ultimate,
excuse me.
Yeah.

753
00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:28.030
Do you think John Lennon would have taken that?
No.

754
00:46:29.630 --> 00:46:34.090
[inaudible] balcony.
Yeah.
With the one leg.
The way this is given up rules.
Yeah.

755
00:46:34.330 --> 00:46:36.370
It's Paul Mccartney.
You know what?

756
00:46:36.371 --> 00:46:39.970
He obviously didn't sign a prenup because there's no way to take that.

757
00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:43.030
She wouldn't even brought it up.
This was before they got married.

758
00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:45.280
She wanted him to stop smoking pot.

759
00:46:45.580 --> 00:46:50.230
There is no way Paul Mccartney should be taking an ultimatum from anybody.

760
00:46:50.650 --> 00:46:54.010
Especially best what?
One foot.
The second wife,

761
00:46:54.820 --> 00:46:58.660
not even at the one he wanted,
the one he wanted and married.
Died.

762
00:46:59.290 --> 00:47:04.290
She's like the standard plus lean and like for fucking decades.

763
00:47:04.630 --> 00:47:07.210
Yeah.
Yeah.
Someone needs to help that guy.

764
00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:12.520
And he sat there and let Linda Sing on those songs where she is just making an

765
00:47:13.931 --> 00:47:17.410
abortion of of a classic Beatles Song.

766
00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:23.740
Ah,
just an open book.
And I said,
live in that live

767
00:47:28.290 --> 00:47:32.230
[inaudible] is playing,
born here.
The hey Jude,
this.

768
00:47:32.450 --> 00:47:34.130
Oh my God,
I never,

769
00:47:35.970 --> 00:47:36.040
<v 5>ah,</v>

770
00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:36.870
<v 4>dude,
oh,</v>

771
00:47:36.870 --> 00:47:40.870
she has such a bad singing voice at the engineer's finally decided to just

772
00:47:40.871 --> 00:47:45.820
isolate her Mike and hit record because there's no real audio from a Paul

773
00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:48.130
Mccartney concert where she was singing background vocals.

774
00:47:48.310 --> 00:47:51.130
I guess they turned her down in the mix,
but this guy said,
this is way too good.

775
00:47:51.131 --> 00:47:55.560
I guys share this with others,
so he a taped just her microphone.
I'm guys.

776
00:47:55.630 --> 00:47:57.040
Hey Jude as being a song.

777
00:47:57.190 --> 00:48:00.010
I'm guessing she was probably kind of contacted to the guy and started actually

778
00:48:00.011 --> 00:48:02.590
thinking that she was actually a museum.
Probably was just like,

779
00:48:02.591 --> 00:48:06.520
all right of the band.
I bitch.
Yeah,
yeah.
Oh,
I'm sure she probably,
you know,

780
00:48:07.190 --> 00:48:10.760
they knew she stunk and I get more based on my monitor athlete.
Yeah,

781
00:48:13.590 --> 00:48:17.100
I can hear what with the fucking plane.

782
00:48:17.470 --> 00:48:22.120
She's the one every time looking at the sound guy pointing at her ear and

783
00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:27.100
putting our thumb up like more monitor.
I can't hear me louder in the mix.

784
00:48:28.810 --> 00:48:30.290
[inaudible] mixed you those air phones.

785
00:48:30.430 --> 00:48:34.240
That one we won over and their phone number,
their tone and holds him

786
00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:37.633
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

787
00:48:40.380 --> 00:48:43.970
<v 4>this is the real deal.
Listen to it.
Yeah,
no,</v>

788
00:48:44.430 --> 00:48:47.410
this is actually Linda Mccartney.
You'll think this is a joke.
This is so,

789
00:48:47.411 --> 00:48:48.990
this is the real deal.
Listen to this.

790
00:48:57.670 --> 00:48:58.503
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

791
00:49:05.180 --> 00:49:06.030
yeah,
Nah

792
00:49:12.850 --> 00:49:13.683
isolated.

793
00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:25.250
[inaudible] what else on this list I'm hitting allege every time

794
00:49:32.570 --> 00:49:35.240
really bad right here.
Listen,

795
00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:41.310
what's so funny,

796
00:49:42.070 --> 00:49:45.300
classic classic song.

797
00:49:48.170 --> 00:49:52.920
This song is almost secret.
Is it any wonder they broke up?

798
00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:56.000
No one can fuck that out.

799
00:49:58.190 --> 00:50:00.210
We should have put in a shower like Barney rubble.

800
00:50:05.810 --> 00:50:08.130
<v 4>So,
so,</v>

801
00:50:08.590 --> 00:50:11.780
so I it,

802
00:50:13.900 --> 00:50:15.300
but that visit a shower.

803
00:50:17.010 --> 00:50:20.280
We got a square back then

804
00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:26.320
when the saints come marching them,

805
00:50:28.670 --> 00:50:32.840
we got Bonnie Relo.
Look and listen to little rock.

806
00:50:32.900 --> 00:50:37.700
Listen to a role isn't to the Ebit in mockingbird.
Golden Smog.

807
00:50:39.150 --> 00:50:44.110
Really?
Wow.
Well Grandma's

808
00:50:47.190 --> 00:50:52.110
the mocking bird
and it's under the moccasin votes.

809
00:50:52.720 --> 00:50:56.350
Flip
bogging is wailing his last.

810
00:50:56.351 --> 00:50:59.750
So we've got enough of like Fred,
we also have a yoga,

811
00:50:59.850 --> 00:51:04.430
his legs would be doing like flawed bond down slip and go,
go,
go,
go.

812
00:51:05.990 --> 00:51:10.870
Is dog called
Yoko Ono.

813
00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:17.260
He'll go on and wasn't much better.
You ever see rock and roll circus?

814
00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:21.510
The documentary is,
is known as,
she can't sing?
No,
I've never heard of you,

815
00:51:22.340 --> 00:51:24.820
but she's more turned us onto this man.

816
00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:28.700
You had like an all star band on stage at John Lennon.
Tell me out.

817
00:51:28.850 --> 00:51:33.580
And who was on Mick Jagger?
Ringo.
Ringo is the king of the all star band.
No,

818
00:51:33.581 --> 00:51:36.520
but this was like nine drummers.
Someone's got to help us out here.
No,

819
00:51:36.521 --> 00:51:38.650
this was the finale finale.

820
00:51:38.651 --> 00:51:42.070
So it was a John Lennon oxidation with Mick Jagger.

821
00:51:42.190 --> 00:51:46.860
Eric Clapton Guitar,
Jimmy Hendrix Guitars.
Yes.
Back had to be there.
No,

822
00:51:46.870 --> 00:51:50.530
that's it right there.
The Wha wha what about the Ho no,

823
00:51:50.531 --> 00:51:51.970
that was part of the whole part of the show.

824
00:51:51.971 --> 00:51:54.640
But if this way valley matrix was alive,
this is,

825
00:51:54.670 --> 00:51:57.580
this is where they pretty much like just a dental appliance.

826
00:51:57.850 --> 00:52:01.150
It's rugs got together and just Jan's.
But the final song is what I'm getting at.

827
00:52:01.151 --> 00:52:03.700
Yeah.
It was Lennon on stage with Mick Jagger,

828
00:52:03.730 --> 00:52:08.080
Eric Clapton Guitar and Hendrick's guitars.
And they just,

829
00:52:08.470 --> 00:52:11.430
how can you fuck that?
Fuck that.
Allegence.

830
00:52:12.130 --> 00:52:15.540
So listen to Yoko Ono erectus thing.
It was the,
uh,

831
00:52:15.580 --> 00:52:18.670
the final song of this rock and roll circus.
That documentary,
who has a,

832
00:52:18.940 --> 00:52:23.020
Derek has it.
Did you fast forward a little bit or,
okay,
listen to this.

833
00:52:24.060 --> 00:52:25.790
<v 5>So they're just jamming away,
right?</v>

834
00:52:28.190 --> 00:52:29.110
There's Y'all gospel

835
00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:37.913
sound

836
00:52:42.650 --> 00:52:47.210
like
hope guys.

837
00:52:47.930 --> 00:52:49.230
That is a both at guys.

838
00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:54.110
There's an APP on her foot.

839
00:52:57.680 --> 00:53:00.260
Cubic can't make that sound like Jimi Hendrix still play.

840
00:53:00.270 --> 00:53:03.890
Like he wouldn't stop and got bar located.
Do you think Lennon,

841
00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:09.700
you're Hendrick spaces or something,
but one of them know like Clapton should,

842
00:53:09.790 --> 00:53:13.850
it just turned around and gone to John.
Your fucking lies.
How old?

843
00:53:13.990 --> 00:53:16.970
The fluffy I'm going to whine about it.
Hit her over the head with a guitar.

844
00:53:17.060 --> 00:53:21.500
It's awful.
I know I'm not,
I'm not available hot or this whole thing.

845
00:53:21.750 --> 00:53:25.740
What do you know?
She is a spool.
[inaudible] man.

846
00:53:26.910 --> 00:53:31.730
Call this program.
What is this shit,
man?
I don't know what,

847
00:53:33.030 --> 00:53:33.450
yeah,

848
00:53:33.450 --> 00:53:36.300
it's a little known fact that took Eric Clapton nine years to tell his friend

849
00:53:36.860 --> 00:53:41.730
John Lennon that he was in a disaster.
Irish.
Yeah,

850
00:53:41.731 --> 00:53:45.270
exactly.
Like this.
Sounds like I don't know how to bring it up.

851
00:53:45.810 --> 00:53:49.980
I just don't know how to bring it out.
Nice.
I go,
Gee,

852
00:53:50.120 --> 00:53:52.210
we're doing a little call back.
Call back.

853
00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:57.090
[inaudible] why couldn't anybody who's helped me before I got divorced that she

854
00:53:57.700 --> 00:54:00.900
stunk?
Have an eight.
Your fucking life.

855
00:54:01.980 --> 00:54:05.810
Miserable human being.
I want to use the new signals.

856
00:54:05.850 --> 00:54:07.470
Get together songs at the local pub.

857
00:54:10.910 --> 00:54:11.743
How is that?

858
00:54:11.940 --> 00:54:16.690
She sounds like this sounds like a napalm strike on the Ho Chi Minh trail.

859
00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:22.210
That's what it sounds like.
Just screaming Vietnamese children.
I cocked.

860
00:54:23.610 --> 00:54:26.310
Wow.
Let's do a David,
Texas.

861
00:54:26.810 --> 00:54:31.630
<v 4>Hey,
hey.
Hey Brad.
Brad's like,
oh my God.</v>

862
00:54:33.420 --> 00:54:34.253
<v 6>Linda Mccartney went up.</v>

863
00:54:34.420 --> 00:54:38.200
I been told her she was walking out the parking lot one day.

864
00:54:38.210 --> 00:54:42.010
She saw this truck driver had a McDonald's bag on the floor of his trucks.

865
00:54:42.030 --> 00:54:43.870
Fired his ass on the spot

866
00:54:44.590 --> 00:54:46.000
<v 4>for eating McDonald's.
Wow.</v>

867
00:54:47.130 --> 00:54:50.140
<v 6>Can we can do it,
dude.
I mean,
there was no,
no meat whatsoever</v>

868
00:54:52.540 --> 00:54:55.020
there fucking shot at his door was open.
You know,
we're all standing there.

869
00:54:55.250 --> 00:55:00.060
She's like,
who's truck is that?
That is,
you're fucking gone.
Like,
oh,
no shit.

870
00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:01.370
Unbelievable on the page.

871
00:55:01.610 --> 00:55:04.500
I told you I love you guys are listening you all every morning out here on tour.

872
00:55:04.501 --> 00:55:05.334
I'm punching out.

873
00:55:05.500 --> 00:55:08.660
<v 4>All right,
let's go to Randy in New York.
Randy on Yo,
what's up guys?
Hey,</v>

874
00:55:09.010 --> 00:55:12.000
<v 6>yeah.
Going a little back before.
Do you think Paul Mccartney was using a,</v>

875
00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:13.770
her leg is a bond lid.

876
00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:17.690
<v 4>Oh,
smoking's the other pas.
That's how this started.</v>

877
00:55:17.780 --> 00:55:20.990
But that's where the ultimatum was to stop smoking out.
Out Out of my lane.

878
00:55:20.991 --> 00:55:25.440
Mills is telling a beetle pot where may,
how about uh,

879
00:55:25.490 --> 00:55:30.490
me smoking pot or you gimp your ass out of here and try to find another beetle

880
00:55:32.060 --> 00:55:34.490
lottery.
Who's been nice.
Lottery does.

881
00:55:34.491 --> 00:55:38.030
One left got Pamela Caringo you idiots.
It wasn't for drugs.

882
00:55:38.031 --> 00:55:42.010
We wouldn't have had the second half of the Korea.
Sergeant Pepper's all that.

883
00:55:42.280 --> 00:55:44.600
Right.
It's drugs.
Yeah.
Drugs that did that,
thank God.

884
00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:47.870
And earlier a girlfriend and give the same ultimate and we wouldn't have all

885
00:55:47.871 --> 00:55:51.920
that stuff that came out.
I wanna hold your hand.
Pick the Beatles.

886
00:55:52.100 --> 00:55:53.420
Wouldn't you think would they would have been like,

887
00:55:53.540 --> 00:55:58.510
like one new gone down in history as much?
Yeah.

888
00:56:00.570 --> 00:56:04.490
It would have sounded like the Hanson brothers started smoking on be wasted and

889
00:56:04.730 --> 00:56:08.300
put here that those satin majorette fucking outfits on.

890
00:56:08.560 --> 00:56:12.330
So they sang a song called the yellow submarine.
Just

891
00:56:14.370 --> 00:56:16.900
take them free drugs though,
isn't it?
No,
no,
no.

892
00:56:18.550 --> 00:56:23.170
There is a definite line when they discovered drugs and it is so apparent and

893
00:56:23.171 --> 00:56:26.020
now someone is telling Paul Mccartney to lay off the plot.
Yeah,

894
00:56:26.220 --> 00:56:27.640
I'd still have some of this in.

895
00:56:27.641 --> 00:56:30.900
I'm still one little puff and all of a sudden a brings out,
it's hidden.

896
00:56:30.910 --> 00:56:35.770
It's a brilliant song coming out.
Remember me?
Yeah.
Smoke your pot.

897
00:56:35.980 --> 00:56:39.820
Smoke your pot.
She's pitching at him.

898
00:56:40.300 --> 00:56:43.660
Find another beetle.
Go ahead.
Go ahead.
That's amazing.

899
00:56:43.661 --> 00:56:47.500
I wonder why he is he too pussy to go?
Um,
let's,
let's,
let's,

900
00:56:47.501 --> 00:56:49.520
let's be honest here to see this house you're living in.

901
00:56:49.580 --> 00:56:52.060
And that was because I was smoking pot with my pals,

902
00:56:52.180 --> 00:56:55.300
smoking pot and doing a lot more.
I would just leave where I cut down.

903
00:56:55.330 --> 00:56:59.800
I would just be in the house and go off and answer.
Let me show you something.

904
00:57:00.010 --> 00:57:03.790
Echo,
Echo.
You see that shit.
That's the living room.

905
00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:09.560
I will do whatever the fuck I want to do.
I just put him in the leg.
Just listen.
A

906
00:57:12.060 --> 00:57:14.080
champion,
a ham,

907
00:57:15.130 --> 00:57:18.220
Fox fucking captain Ahab Ndm and knew a lot of money.
Look,

908
00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:20.980
I'm just constantly pointed her foot.
Nobody,

909
00:57:21.010 --> 00:57:25.610
no one's hot enough to be missing a limb when I'm,
I'm,
I can get,
uh,
he,

910
00:57:25.630 --> 00:57:30.340
I bet you Paul Mccartney could get a 21 year old dude.
He met you.

911
00:57:31.430 --> 00:57:36.190
This is not by South beach.
Yeah.
This isn't even an issue that you have to say.

912
00:57:36.191 --> 00:57:40.990
I bet you he can.
He's Paul Mccartney,

913
00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:46.360
the Beatles this into,
there's only two left.
You just sit there right when she's,

914
00:57:46.361 --> 00:57:47.650
when she's talking shit to you,
you just,

915
00:57:47.710 --> 00:57:49.870
you just shake your head back and forth like mm.
Mm.

916
00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:52.900
And you just keep looking at her until she said so.
And she,

917
00:57:52.901 --> 00:57:54.790
and you just keep going.
As you'd shake your head,
look at it.

918
00:57:54.791 --> 00:57:59.250
I didn't look at her foot once again,
but Theresa will just something,

919
00:57:59.440 --> 00:58:02.230
she can't come out.
They set up,
these are going to go.
And

920
00:58:05.490 --> 00:58:08.080
um,
which one is it again?
Back to the,
I'm on a second.

921
00:58:08.081 --> 00:58:12.670
And then knowing it and then knocking on the fake one.
Um,
hello.

922
00:58:13.150 --> 00:58:17.230
I'm a Beatle.
Bitch.
Who fills your closet with left shoes?

923
00:58:18.840 --> 00:58:22.530
Paul?
My fucking fucking baby.

924
00:58:24.160 --> 00:58:29.040
That's your last name.
Bitch.
My fucking Courtney.
How about the,
and you know what?

925
00:58:29.590 --> 00:58:33.700
I'm going to give you a new one of those new wooden legs in the shape of a joint

926
00:58:35.550 --> 00:58:40.540
just
to it ashy like it was fucking

927
00:58:42.410 --> 00:58:47.290
going to say one end from somebody sucking on it.

928
00:58:48.500 --> 00:58:51.100
Paul.
A fucking Carnaby's joint on the side of it.

929
00:58:53.170 --> 00:58:57.110
Let's go to Frankie on whales to rim shot.

930
00:58:58.450 --> 00:58:59.490
What's up?
Crazy.

931
00:59:02.340 --> 00:59:05.370
<v 6>Okay.
See that's where</v>

932
00:59:06.300 --> 00:59:09.390
<v 4>Paul made a mistake.
Uh,
uh,
an album called rubber soul.</v>

933
00:59:09.840 --> 00:59:12.660
Heather Mills happy about an album called rubber sole

934
00:59:13.690 --> 00:59:15.500
<v 6>it off my mind.
Relax and float down stream.</v>

935
00:59:16.190 --> 00:59:17.700
<v 4>I'll hold your hand.</v>

936
00:59:20.250 --> 00:59:25.190
I never thought of that in my life that she loves you.
Yay.
Yay.
Yay Paul.

937
00:59:25.191 --> 00:59:29.900
From a job in it.
But wasn't that part of their greatest hits you?
Oh yeah.

938
00:59:29.990 --> 00:59:34.960
I mean it's hindsight looking where they went.
They came out as like,

939
00:59:35.180 --> 00:59:39.830
they came out,
they were like in sync,
but the boy band of Liverpool,

940
00:59:40.570 --> 00:59:44.120
they weren't handsome in one hit wonders when that fucking came out though.

941
00:59:44.121 --> 00:59:48.360
They was
[inaudible] they were done.

942
00:59:49.010 --> 00:59:51.020
Yeah.
That stuff was,
they will dry out if they didn't,

943
00:59:51.350 --> 00:59:56.350
if they didn't listen to Peter Noone listen to Peter Noone stuff who didn't

944
00:59:57.291 --> 01:00:00.350
progress on to Henry the eight.
Yeah,

945
01:00:00.750 --> 01:00:04.220
and they really hate that he was,
he just dumb.

946
01:00:04.221 --> 01:00:06.500
He might've been addressed and he's like,
second verse,

947
01:00:06.710 --> 01:00:10.940
same as the Ame and radiate Siam.
It's just like

948
01:00:14.750 --> 01:00:19.070
[inaudible] midnight runners should Islam [inaudible] to something.

949
01:00:19.100 --> 01:00:23.460
Go Stat guy does some things,
you know,

950
01:00:24.250 --> 01:00:28.850
walking around one eye's a thousand of those guys and bad guys,

951
01:00:29.330 --> 01:00:34.280
but they never went on the smoke with pot and take the LSD and shit down with

952
01:00:34.281 --> 01:00:39.080
the Maharishi and fucking get hammered.
Even thought of that Shit,
man.

953
01:00:39.380 --> 01:00:42.440
Let's go to Paul Jersey.
He's got something.
My Paul Paul,

954
01:00:44.660 --> 01:00:47.550
<v 6>Hey Paul Mccartney,
his wife can have a full term pregnancy.</v>

955
01:00:48.590 --> 01:00:53.030
<v 4>Whoa,
Whoa,
wow.
[inaudible] beat the foot.</v>

956
01:00:55.100 --> 01:00:58.390
Wow.
Oh my goodness.
Look at Erin Smith.

957
01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:02.960
Erin Smith in the 70s completely wasted.
That's the best fucking music,
best shit.

958
01:01:04.190 --> 01:01:07.970
Then they get cleaned up and you get love in an elevator.
You got to,

959
01:01:08.060 --> 01:01:12.080
they got their most commercial success though after they got off the drug,

960
01:01:12.150 --> 01:01:14.390
so let's go to which is weird.
I know,
man.

961
01:01:14.391 --> 01:01:16.880
Stick with the pro drug fucking slant or the show.

962
01:01:16.910 --> 01:01:21.620
That is for the instant feedback bit ruining.
You did.
What did I do?

963
01:01:21.710 --> 01:01:25.380
I ruined your Beth.
That's ready.
The band.
You got me bash.
Jesus.

964
01:01:25.590 --> 01:01:30.150
You motherfuckers.
Y'All are just,
Oh,
we don't forget.
Oh,
we don't forget and

965
01:01:31.890 --> 01:01:36.590
we don't get back to Sicily.
He is laid at a time.

966
01:01:36.620 --> 01:01:40.580
You open a dro.
Let's go.
You killed my father drove.

967
01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:44.440
<v 6>Yes.
Go.
Hey Man,
what's up?
I got the MacArthur,</v>

968
01:01:44.730 --> 01:01:48.240
the ultimatum about two weeks ago.
Well,
I potter me,

969
01:01:49.350 --> 01:01:51.530
but you're not a beetle.
Yeah,
I know.

970
01:01:52.420 --> 01:01:55.370
<v 4>So you're not smoking pot anymore.
Fuck that.</v>

971
01:01:55.660 --> 01:01:57.050
<v 6>They got to go buy another bag today.</v>

972
01:01:57.220 --> 01:02:00.880
<v 4>There you go.
Alright,
let me blow it up and blow and blow.</v>

973
01:02:01.210 --> 01:02:03.370
We'd rings in a face because I was like,
he's on pot right now.

974
01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:04.270
We're talking a Beatle.

975
01:02:04.271 --> 01:02:06.860
He should be able to take her leg off and beat her over the head with this.

976
01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:07.210
Right.

977
01:02:07.210 --> 01:02:10.210
You should still come back with a loving smile or turn it into an instrument

978
01:02:10.211 --> 01:02:12.070
like the,
yeah,
the the thing that you do,

979
01:02:12.071 --> 01:02:13.770
fucking trombone that you had to come over.

980
01:02:18.150 --> 01:02:21.270
[inaudible] watch.
This means I'm a,
I'm a car holes in it.

981
01:02:21.420 --> 01:02:24.600
I'm gonna turn this to a big flute.
You're leg is a giant

982
01:02:26.370 --> 01:02:31.370
playing her leg and I want you to play your leg and some smoking to enhance my

983
01:02:31.801 --> 01:02:35.010
eye and seeing the back.
I want you to sing the chorus,
the yellow submarine.

984
01:02:35.810 --> 01:02:39.020
Why smoke weed?
All your legs.
We are

985
01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:21.913
<v 0>[inaudible].</v>

986
01:03:32.450 --> 01:03:32.530
[inaudible].

987
01:03:32.530 --> 01:03:33.760
<v 7>Hey,
what's going on?</v>

988
01:03:33.790 --> 01:03:37.780
It's built bar and it's the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

989
01:03:37.810 --> 01:03:41.800
November 2nd,

990
01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:45.880
2009 can you believe that?
It's November.
Oh my God.

991
01:03:45.881 --> 01:03:48.760
Where's this year?
God.
Jesus.

992
01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:53.320
Every year it goes by faster.
I know.
I always do that joke,

993
01:03:53.321 --> 01:03:57.670
but that's what everybody says.
Can you believe it's November?
Yes,

994
01:03:57.671 --> 01:04:01.150
I can.
You know what gave it away October.

995
01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:07.180
That was the big hint that fucking November was coming up.
You know,

996
01:04:07.210 --> 01:04:10.150
Halloween.
I remember that.
I know that's on the 31st

997
01:04:11.740 --> 01:04:14.740
so yes,
I can believe in.
Yes,
yes.
It does go by quicker.

998
01:04:14.741 --> 01:04:19.720
Obviously it goes by quicker.
Think about it.
When you were a child,
you know,

999
01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:25.110
if you were four years old,
if a year went by,
that was 25% of your life.
Yes.

1000
01:04:25.111 --> 01:04:26.490
So it definitely dragged on.

1001
01:04:26.491 --> 01:04:31.491
Plus you had two giants telling you what the fuck to do all day and what to eat

1002
01:04:32.100 --> 01:04:35.910
right.
And when you're 41 years old,
a year goes by.

1003
01:04:35.911 --> 01:04:39.360
That's like a,
it's kind of math.
I can't do,
I don't know what that is.

1004
01:04:39.361 --> 01:04:43.860
What does that one,
one 80th of my life,
you know,
it's funny.

1005
01:04:43.861 --> 01:04:47.430
It's actually Sunday night right now,
and I just settled down to do the podcast.

1006
01:04:47.431 --> 01:04:49.890
I had the apartment to myself.
I'm thinking,
all right,

1007
01:04:49.891 --> 01:04:54.090
can bang out a nice hour and all of a sudden the windows open and I hear

1008
01:04:54.091 --> 01:04:59.010
somebody driving by listening to this song,
this is how we do it.

1009
01:04:59.550 --> 01:05:02.010
It's Friday night,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
I'm like,

1010
01:05:02.011 --> 01:05:06.000
who the fuck would still be listening to that music?

1011
01:05:06.180 --> 01:05:10.830
And Lo and behold,
it's the woman I share my life with,
pulling in,

1012
01:05:11.430 --> 01:05:15.870
listen to a song that sucked when it came out on the radio.

1013
01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:18.790
Bullshit.
You listen to that station all the time.

1014
01:05:20.050 --> 01:05:24.730
All I want to do with chromosomes on Zomato bone bone.
You're up.
Yeah.

1015
01:05:24.731 --> 01:05:29.310
See?
He listened.
He listened to all of that shit.
You listen,
I'm going to pause.

1016
01:05:29.340 --> 01:05:33.160
I'm going to get satellite radio so I can listen to really bad hair metal and

1017
01:05:33.161 --> 01:05:34.900
you can know what the fuck I was listening to.

1018
01:05:35.290 --> 01:05:36.400
You know what you smell like right now?

1019
01:05:36.401 --> 01:05:40.060
You smell like that overpowering air freshener that you put in the fucking car.

1020
01:05:40.900 --> 01:05:42.280
<v 0>I smell something different.</v>

1021
01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:46.960

Yeah.
Huh?

1022
01:05:46.961 --> 01:05:49.480
I don't know what it smell it get away from me.
I got to do a podcast.

1023
01:05:49.481 --> 01:05:51.760
I can't be smelling smells.
What is it?

1024
01:05:52.690 --> 01:05:52.870
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

okay,
well then I'm going to stick with that.

1027
01:05:59.141 --> 01:06:03.040
Then gather your belongings and get out of the room.
So you guys,

1028
01:06:03.041 --> 01:06:05.530
this is how you handle a little more when they deliberately act moody.

1029
01:06:06.190 --> 01:06:09.520
You just said get away from me and I'm really rude.
No,
I didn't.

1030
01:06:09.521 --> 01:06:10.510
I said a comical way.

1031
01:06:10.511 --> 01:06:14.440
If I see if I'm holding a microphone with an orange fucking windscreen,

1032
01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:17.230
you can't take it seriously.
You can not take it seriously.

1033
01:06:17.460 --> 01:06:20.060
No Way with being an asshole.
Yeah I do.
I get away with it.
What?

1034
01:06:20.070 --> 01:06:23.230
I don't want to cause I'm running shit.
Get out woman.
Go make me.
You see here,

1035
01:06:23.231 --> 01:06:27.460
which will make me say which,
Oh beat it.
Come on.

1036
01:06:27.461 --> 01:06:31.610
I want to talk about Halloween and how I thought we had the fucking the best

1037
01:06:31.611 --> 01:06:35.090
shit on the block.
But yeah,

1038
01:06:35.091 --> 01:06:38.400
he's fucking assholes up the street.
All right,
let me back up near.

1039
01:06:38.410 --> 01:06:40.700
You need to walk so I can tell this story.
All right.

1040
01:06:40.701 --> 01:06:44.510
You and your fragrance need to get out of the room here for a second.
Okay.

1041
01:06:45.140 --> 01:06:45.973
<v 0>La.</v>

1042
01:06:47.390 --> 01:06:49.650
<v 7>Oh,

1043
01:06:50.370 --> 01:06:52.740
I had giant Athan fuck you.

1044
01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:01.340
Oh,
that's how you keep it fresh people.

1045
01:07:01.940 --> 01:07:06.440
It's the fights and then the making up and whatnot.

1046
01:07:07.130 --> 01:07:09.050
Um,
why did I just do that through,
cause I was annoyed.

1047
01:07:09.051 --> 01:07:12.020
I thought he had the apartment to myself,
so I just decided to be a Douche.

1048
01:07:12.350 --> 01:07:15.740
So there you go.
I'm Douche bag of the week.
Um,

1049
01:07:15.770 --> 01:07:20.360
I pulled it out the last seconds.
Um,
anyways,
so for Halloween,

1050
01:07:21.830 --> 01:07:26.000
those of you who are longtime listeners of the podcast know that I,
I'm,

1051
01:07:26.001 --> 01:07:27.920
I'm kind of into Halloween.
I like it.

1052
01:07:28.430 --> 01:07:32.180
I decided to embrace the holidays a couple years ago rather than just being
like,

1053
01:07:32.181 --> 01:07:36.130
dude,
this is fucking bullshit.
It's used to know the corporate fucking straight.

1054
01:07:36.420 --> 01:07:40.520
You give me [inaudible].
Um,
I find just said,
you know what?
Fuck it.

1055
01:07:41.300 --> 01:07:45.890
So,
um,
you know,
last year,
if you guys are on my myspace page,

1056
01:07:46.100 --> 01:07:47.450
so I'm sticking it out there.

1057
01:07:47.750 --> 01:07:51.440
I have pictures of the Pumpkin I carve last year I carved an ACDC pumpkin.

1058
01:07:51.441 --> 01:07:55.920
That was the shit.
Okay.
It was the shit.

1059
01:07:55.980 --> 01:07:59.670
And this year as in like,
how do I top this?
And,
um,

1060
01:07:59.730 --> 01:08:03.720
I was trying to think of the scariest thing I could think of to carve into a

1061
01:08:03.721 --> 01:08:08.460
pumpkin.
And I ended up carving the,
uh,
the Federal Reserve Bank.

1062
01:08:10.900 --> 01:08:11.640
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1063
01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:15.090
<v 7>I know I'm going crazy.
I can still smell that fucking fragrance.</v>

1064
01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:19.430
It's overpowering,
whatever it is.
Oh God,
it's awful.

1065
01:08:21.170 --> 01:08:25.910
Jesus smells like flowers and soap all at the same time.

1066
01:08:26.900 --> 01:08:29.300
You know,
one of those things individually,
they're good,
you know,

1067
01:08:29.301 --> 01:08:33.650
like brushing your teeth and orange juice,
but if you put them together,
um,

1068
01:08:33.651 --> 01:08:38.170
so anyways,
yeah,
carved the Federal Reserve Bank.
It's the fucking shit.
All right.

1069
01:08:38.500 --> 01:08:41.510
Uh,
go on,
on my myspace page.
I've got a whole picture of it,
you know,

1070
01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:46.600
and then I fucking made pumpkin bread afterwards and I fucking toasted the

1071
01:08:46.701 --> 01:08:50.180
seeds.
I was like a native American,
you know,

1072
01:08:51.770 --> 01:08:54.740
after I killed the Pumpkin,
I used all the parts.

1073
01:08:55.730 --> 01:08:59.750
I took out the Pumpkin's Achilles tendons.
I made a fucking jump rope out of it,

1074
01:09:00.250 --> 01:09:02.360
you know,
and I looked out the window,

1075
01:09:02.361 --> 01:09:07.361
I saw some trash and I got a little teary eyed and that's what I did that I just

1076
01:09:07.730 --> 01:09:12.620
use the crying Indian hacky reference.
That was funny.
Way Back on VH one.

1077
01:09:13.100 --> 01:09:16.150
Standup spotlight.
Do you guys ever used to watch that?
Any old people out there?

1078
01:09:16.190 --> 01:09:19.910
The standup spotlights when they were just scraping the bottom of the barrel of

1079
01:09:19.911 --> 01:09:21.230
anybody remotely left.

1080
01:09:21.231 --> 01:09:26.231
Funny from the 1980s half the people on there were like substitute teachers.

1081
01:09:26.690 --> 01:09:29.900
They had chalk on the back of their pants,
come in a little deal,

1082
01:09:31.250 --> 01:09:34.850
fucking erasers and they'd somehow we're making money.

1083
01:09:36.170 --> 01:09:38.300
You know,
what am I talking about?
So anyway,

1084
01:09:38.301 --> 01:09:42.320
so not only do I have the Federal Reserve pumpkin cause I figured you know what?

1085
01:09:42.321 --> 01:09:44.750
Anybody can try and scare the kids.
You know who,
who,

1086
01:09:45.510 --> 01:09:47.600
whoever tries to scare the parents.
That's what I,

1087
01:09:47.601 --> 01:09:51.290
that's why I decided to carve the Federal Reserve Bank and did it fucking three

1088
01:09:51.291 --> 01:09:52.124
d style.

1089
01:09:52.220 --> 01:09:56.630
It's the Shit I had flames behind it actually tried to carve.

1090
01:09:56.631 --> 01:10:01.070
We own you in reverse writing.
So it would come up against the wall,

1091
01:10:01.071 --> 01:10:05.450
but I failed just because I don't have,
I don't have the tools.
All right?

1092
01:10:05.570 --> 01:10:09.170
All these assholes who are making these fucking insane pumpkin's half of these

1093
01:10:09.740 --> 01:10:12.530
cunts,
they just go,
you go on a website and you just buy something.

1094
01:10:12.531 --> 01:10:14.690
He just trace it and it tells you what to do.

1095
01:10:14.990 --> 01:10:17.690
You don't have fucking third grader could do it,
you know,

1096
01:10:17.691 --> 01:10:18.530
and then you get all these,

1097
01:10:18.531 --> 01:10:22.370
all these little double edged knives and all this shit.
I had a,

1098
01:10:22.430 --> 01:10:24.110
I had a fucking paring knife,

1099
01:10:25.250 --> 01:10:30.250
the same knife I use to cut up an apple I carved in the Federal Reserve Bank.

1100
01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:34.310
Okay.
And I was going to have wheel on you,
but that part failed.
But whatever.

1101
01:10:34.610 --> 01:10:38.240
So I had that.
And then I also had,
I had full size candy bars.

1102
01:10:38.540 --> 01:10:41.630
You had your choice.
If you came to my house on Halloween,

1103
01:10:41.810 --> 01:10:46.250
you had your fucking choice of a Hershey bar without nuts.

1104
01:10:46.490 --> 01:10:49.880
Cause God knows all these fucking pussy kids are allergic to everything.

1105
01:10:50.540 --> 01:10:52.730
He can't have almonds,
almonds,

1106
01:10:52.980 --> 01:10:55.970
it countered back balances his PROZAC.

1107
01:10:55.971 --> 01:11:00.140
And then it's just crazy until Wednesday.
Really Lady.

1108
01:11:01.310 --> 01:11:06.020
Did you ever think you should have died and not had a kid?
Wow.
Wow.
That was mean.

1109
01:11:06.470 --> 01:11:08.770
So now what I was trying to say,
but I was,
I was trying to say,

1110
01:11:08.771 --> 01:11:11.980
I was talking about natural selection there that Ja,

1111
01:11:12.900 --> 01:11:16.500
whatever's in you was so fucking weak that your kid can't even have nuts.

1112
01:11:17.190 --> 01:11:20.100
You know what I mean?
I mean,
every,

1113
01:11:20.130 --> 01:11:23.340
everybody's allergic to getting fucking stabbed.
But when you're like allergic,

1114
01:11:23.341 --> 01:11:28.050
I can't have food.
You shouldn't be alive.
All these fucking people,

1115
01:11:28.350 --> 01:11:32.820
all these lactose intolerant fucking people clogging up the highways,

1116
01:11:32.821 --> 01:11:35.100
all of you,
you should not be alive.

1117
01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:39.930
You're only alive because,
uh,
Jesus Christ,

1118
01:11:39.931 --> 01:11:42.510
I really talk myself into a corner.
Why Bill?
Why are they alive?

1119
01:11:42.511 --> 01:11:47.070
Because of modern medicine.
They're just using you as a fucking revenue stream.

1120
01:11:47.890 --> 01:11:50.430
All right,
who's kidding?
Who?
I would've been dead 100 years ago.

1121
01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:53.430
I would have been,
I had a ruptured appendix and sixth grade.

1122
01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:56.520
They would have been if I would have been on like a little house in the prairie,

1123
01:11:56.550 --> 01:12:01.320
just laying there sweating on a fucking 58 blankets and an outhouse is now what

1124
01:12:01.420 --> 01:12:02.253
they did with their sick.

1125
01:12:02.610 --> 01:12:05.670
You should just stick them under blankets and start dabbing at their forehead.

1126
01:12:06.210 --> 01:12:10.110
Does this make it better?
No,
it doesn't.
No it does.

1127
01:12:10.220 --> 01:12:14.550
It's something inside of me exploded and now the poison is having a party

1128
01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:19.890
and a,
he should take me out back and shoot me like old yeller.
So anyways,

1129
01:12:19.891 --> 01:12:23.910
I got this fucking insane fucking pumpkin.
All right.

1130
01:12:25.230 --> 01:12:26.850
Okay.
Anybody can,
can,
can,

1131
01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:30.900
can carve in some shit that doesn't exist that will scare the fuck out of you.

1132
01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:34.890
This actually exists and is actually was actually fucking everyone who's walking

1133
01:12:34.891 --> 01:12:38.610
up the stairs,
all of them.
All of them should have been like,
Holy Shit.

1134
01:12:38.910 --> 01:12:42.450
That's it right there.
That is the devil.
That is the fucking devil.

1135
01:12:42.540 --> 01:12:44.340
I love that Pumpkin.
It looks great.

1136
01:12:44.490 --> 01:12:47.400
It's saying something and it's scaring the shit out of me.

1137
01:12:47.401 --> 01:12:50.850
It's working on all three levels.
It is a fucking triple threat.
Like,

1138
01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:54.900
like the way people used to be in show business back in the day where they could

1139
01:12:54.901 --> 01:12:56.880
sing and they could dance and they could tell jokes.

1140
01:12:57.060 --> 01:13:01.010
That's what that Pumpkin Pumpkin is,
you know,
that's the,
yeah.

1141
01:13:01.011 --> 01:13:03.480
You know all that was,
is what I was hoping they would think.
But they didn't,

1142
01:13:03.570 --> 01:13:07.800
I didn't get one comment.
Why did he carve a building into a pumpkin?

1143
01:13:07.801 --> 01:13:12.270
I don't understand.
Is that a Walmart?
One of my good,
Walmart's fucking scary.

1144
01:13:12.330 --> 01:13:12.940
You know,

1145
01:13:12.940 --> 01:13:15.780
somebody came with the stairs who fuckin actually try to start a hardware store

1146
01:13:16.050 --> 01:13:20.430
anyways,
so I had fired this fucking insane pumpkin.
All right.
Um,

1147
01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:23.970
have my fucking door all lit up and all that type of shit and I got full sized

1148
01:13:23.971 --> 01:13:28.050
fucking candy bars.
Okay.
For all these cute little kids coming up.
All right.

1149
01:13:28.620 --> 01:13:31.350
But uh,
something,
and this is going to be at,
word's going to get out.

1150
01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:33.420
This dude's got a fucking,
you know,

1151
01:13:33.421 --> 01:13:37.410
he carved a library into a pumpkin and he's got,
who gives a fuck?

1152
01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:38.273
The guys aware of,

1153
01:13:38.450 --> 01:13:41.520
everybody's got full size fucking candy bars and their candy bars that we

1154
01:13:41.521 --> 01:13:43.160
recognize kit-kat,

1155
01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:46.890
her Reese's peanut butter cups or fucking or Hershey.

1156
01:13:48.490 --> 01:13:52.230
What does it not?
Hershey,
Hershey milk chocolate.
Okay.
Those were all fucking,

1157
01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:55.740
we know what those are.
So even though he's a Weirdo,
it's wrapped.

1158
01:13:55.740 --> 01:13:58.500
We understand there's no poison and so I'm thinking I'm going to be the shit.

1159
01:13:58.680 --> 01:14:01.590
These kids are going to be clamoring around me like I'm fucking Dick Clark in

1160
01:14:01.591 --> 01:14:03.720
1965.
Right.
But no,

1161
01:14:04.710 --> 01:14:08.850
I got fucked because the people up the street,
they were,
they went all out.

1162
01:14:09.900 --> 01:14:13.330
This dude up the street,
his son and daughter,

1163
01:14:13.690 --> 01:14:18.690
his son fuck head that he is now his son and his daughter put on a show like uh,

1164
01:14:20.140 --> 01:14:21.520
like Michael Jackson.

1165
01:14:21.550 --> 01:14:25.570
They were doing a tribute to Michael Jackson and it was fucking insane.

1166
01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:29.140
They had a stage,
they had like monitors.

1167
01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:32.470
It looked like a fucking rock show is going to happen and they had a show like

1168
01:14:32.471 --> 01:14:36.400
every 20 minutes or every half hour and a whole crowd would gather.

1169
01:14:36.730 --> 01:14:40.300
I didn't even get to see it.
I was down the street with my full size candy bar.

1170
01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:43.870
Am I fucking new world order pumpkin going with a f where is everybody?

1171
01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:46.720
You know I got a fucking seven 11 here.

1172
01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:49.220
So what are this in my fucking kitchen look like?

1173
01:14:49.250 --> 01:14:53.480
Literally like I robbed the seven 11 and rather than taking the money I took all

1174
01:14:53.481 --> 01:14:56.390
the candy out of it.
That's what the fuck it looked like.
And I,

1175
01:14:56.490 --> 01:14:57.900
and I can't get a God damn fuck it.

1176
01:14:57.901 --> 01:15:01.460
I can't get anybody to come cause everybody's running up the street cause these

1177
01:15:01.461 --> 01:15:03.770
kids were killing it.
You don't kneel.

1178
01:15:03.771 --> 01:15:05.430
Went up there with their mom and they came back.

1179
01:15:05.900 --> 01:15:07.220
<v 8>Oh my God.
It was awesome.</v>

1180
01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:12.470
They even had the car from the fucking whatever video and he literally got in
it,

1181
01:15:12.500 --> 01:15:13.480
Blah Blah Blah.

1182
01:15:13.570 --> 01:15:18.330
<v 7>Just wanted to fucking slap both of them.
Um,
no I didn't.
I want to,</v>

1183
01:15:18.340 --> 01:15:19.210
I was fucking pissed.

1184
01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:23.460
I was literally reduced to yelling off of my balcony going as people were

1185
01:15:23.461 --> 01:15:28.200
walking by to go up to go see the Michael Jackson thing.
I was going,
hey,

1186
01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:31.710
we got kids here.
We've got candy up here.
Right?

1187
01:15:31.740 --> 01:15:36.510
Think about the 41 year old white male yelling down to children that he's got

1188
01:15:36.511 --> 01:15:40.980
candy.
It was really,
it was really bad,
but,
uh,

1189
01:15:40.990 --> 01:15:45.080
eventually I got rid of all of it and uh,
I discovered a new,
uh,

1190
01:15:45.180 --> 01:15:49.250
pet peeve that I have.
Um,

1191
01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:53.270
I don't like trick or treaters who look like they're fucking 26.
All right.

1192
01:15:53.271 --> 01:15:57.940
You know who you are.
You're too fucking old.
It's not cute anymore.
You know,

1193
01:15:57.970 --> 01:15:59.860
you're a Douche.
And um,

1194
01:15:59.890 --> 01:16:04.540
the last group of people came up as was fucking unreal kid had a better mustache

1195
01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:07.140
than I could grow.
You know,
he didn't have a mustache,
you know what I'm saying?

1196
01:16:07.350 --> 01:16:08.470
If you're too fucking old.

1197
01:16:09.050 --> 01:16:11.890
And he was actually saying she fucking hates them too when she wanted to do was

1198
01:16:11.891 --> 01:16:15.940
have a bag of apples.
And when people came up and they would do it too old,

1199
01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:20.050
she wanted to give them apples instead of candy.
I'm like,
yeah,
that's great.

1200
01:16:20.051 --> 01:16:22.360
And then they get down to the front yard and they throw it through your fucking

1201
01:16:22.361 --> 01:16:24.130
window.
Why don't we just hand out baseballs?

1202
01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:26.500
But I understood what she was talking about.
You know,

1203
01:16:28.630 --> 01:16:31.450
the fuck is wrong with you.
How old are you?
Okay,

1204
01:16:31.451 --> 01:16:35.950
you should be going to a Halloween party trying to fuck somebody dressed like a

1205
01:16:35.951 --> 01:16:38.440
tube of toothpaste or whatever it is.
That's what you supposed to be doing.

1206
01:16:38.590 --> 01:16:41.050
You're not supposed to be coming to my door.
Fucking yell.

1207
01:16:41.910 --> 01:16:46.030
Was it knowing I should have had a little bite size ones.
Anyways,

1208
01:16:46.060 --> 01:16:48.790
so I actually was walking my dog this morning and I was seeing all like the

1209
01:16:48.791 --> 01:16:52.660
candy wrappers on the ground and all the fat kids who couldn't wait til they got

1210
01:16:52.661 --> 01:16:53.950
home.
And um,

1211
01:16:56.680 --> 01:17:00.620
and um,
I dunno,
they will all bite size.

1212
01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:02.060
None of them were full size.

1213
01:17:02.061 --> 01:17:05.570
I the best candy on the fucking block and I got trumped,

1214
01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:08.990
but it's Vegas show up the fucking street.
Really?
I don't know.

1215
01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:13.960
It was just annoying.
No,
I just shit out of me.
And I also,
uh,
I,

1216
01:17:13.970 --> 01:17:16.020
when I walk my dog,
I actually,
I,

1217
01:17:16.030 --> 01:17:19.550
I pick up litter because a,

1218
01:17:19.551 --> 01:17:22.340
I think I live in a nice neighborhood and I don't like when fucking people throw

1219
01:17:22.341 --> 01:17:25.730
shit on the ground.
So I'm sitting there picking up these little candy wrappers,

1220
01:17:25.790 --> 01:17:28.370
my Goddamn Dog,
and uh,

1221
01:17:29.510 --> 01:17:33.950
came across a milky way that that bugged me.
You know,

1222
01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:39.530
we do,
you know why even give out candy if he'd given out a milky way,

1223
01:17:39.531 --> 01:17:44.240
that's such a fucking cop out.
It's like,
uh,
I can't,

1224
01:17:44.241 --> 01:17:47.000
I can't even fucking gives a fuck about Holland.
You don't Milky Way.

1225
01:17:47.001 --> 01:17:49.100
The Milky Way is like,
it's like

1226
01:17:50.660 --> 01:17:54.650
if John Oates was a candy bar,
he be,
he be a fucking Milky Way.

1227
01:17:54.651 --> 01:17:56.960
That's what I'm trying to say.
All right.

1228
01:17:56.990 --> 01:17:58.720
If you don't listen to fucking hauling out cheating,

1229
01:17:58.730 --> 01:17:59.780
you don't get the joker right.

1230
01:17:59.781 --> 01:18:04.781
He at something it knowget new get is John Oates.

1231
01:18:05.300 --> 01:18:08.810
Okay.
Nougat needs some sort of,

1232
01:18:09.260 --> 01:18:11.300
it needs something with it.
You know what I mean?

1233
01:18:11.330 --> 01:18:16.330
It's like a Andrew Ridgeley who some of the other famous duos that broke off and

1234
01:18:18.561 --> 01:18:23.480
one guy just totally fucking made it and the other guy was the human fucking

1235
01:18:23.481 --> 01:18:27.320
version of,
of new get with nothing in it.
Can you think of anybody else?

1236
01:18:28.100 --> 01:18:30.390
I know fucking in sync.

1237
01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:34.340
Justin Timberlake was the almonds.

1238
01:18:36.470 --> 01:18:39.890
Those other four mother fuckers.
That's what they were.

1239
01:18:41.420 --> 01:18:44.300
When Justin was in there,
it was a snickers bar.

1240
01:18:44.420 --> 01:18:47.300
You took him out as a Milky Way and nobody fucking gave a shit.

1241
01:18:47.301 --> 01:18:49.220
And that was the end of them.
That was the fucking end of them.

1242
01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.160
Who gives out Milky Way,
you know,

1243
01:18:52.700 --> 01:18:55.550
fucking you not even try and not even fuck.

1244
01:18:55.551 --> 01:18:57.710
I had full sized fucking candy bar and I was,

1245
01:18:57.711 --> 01:19:01.700
I was hanging out screaming at people trying to get them to come up to my

1246
01:19:01.701 --> 01:19:05.000
fucking places.
Pathetic.
But I'll tell you right now,

1247
01:19:05.001 --> 01:19:08.270
the pumpkin bread was to shit.
All right,
let's move on here.
Um,

1248
01:19:08.271 --> 01:19:11.560
let's talk about my life.
What I have going on.
Um,

1249
01:19:11.561 --> 01:19:16.250
I'm trying to hype shit that I have going on,
um,
earlier in the podcast.

1250
01:19:16.850 --> 01:19:21.500
So here goes this week.
I'm going to be a town hall in New York City.

1251
01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:26.940
I'm not the town hall,
the town hall theater.
And um,

1252
01:19:27.050 --> 01:19:28.790
I don't even know if there's any tickets left,

1253
01:19:29.450 --> 01:19:32.360
but I just like saying I'm going to be doing a theater in New York City.

1254
01:19:32.361 --> 01:19:36.200
Do you realize that?
Do you realize how huge that is for me?
You know,

1255
01:19:36.620 --> 01:19:40.370
way back in the day when I was a youngster with a big Red Afro,

1256
01:19:40.371 --> 01:19:44.150
wondering if I'd ever get on stage in New York City just to do five fucking

1257
01:19:44.151 --> 01:19:48.410
minutes at one o'clock in the morning,
you know,

1258
01:19:48.940 --> 01:19:52.190
and here it is,
38 years later,

1259
01:19:53.690 --> 01:19:56.830
I'm finally getting to do with theater and I'm actually really excited and um,

1260
01:19:56.890 --> 01:20:00.950
I'm doing my special next month and um,

1261
01:20:01.850 --> 01:20:05.000
you know,
this is going to be,
you know,
weren't basically,
if you go to that show,

1262
01:20:05.001 --> 01:20:07.980
you're going to see basically my special essentially.

1263
01:20:08.490 --> 01:20:12.810
So I got that going on and a,
that's November 6th of November 7th,

1264
01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:16.380
I'm going to be doing comics,
come home with Denis Leary,

1265
01:20:16.381 --> 01:20:19.680
the 50th anniversary.
It's for the Cam Neely,
um,

1266
01:20:20.370 --> 01:20:23.430
the Cam Nealy House that helps families,
um,

1267
01:20:23.820 --> 01:20:26.940
of people's stricken with cancer gives them a place to stay rather than sitting

1268
01:20:26.941 --> 01:20:30.000
in some awful hospital.
They actually get a nice home to stay in.

1269
01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:34.260
So that's a wonderful cause that'll be at a guidance arena with a bu terriers

1270
01:20:34.261 --> 01:20:38.670
play.
And uh,
I believe there's only a few tickets left for that one.

1271
01:20:39.510 --> 01:20:42.900
So that's what I got going on.
And later on the month I'll be in Tempe,
Arizona.

1272
01:20:42.901 --> 01:20:46.080
Really looking forward to that Gig and uh,

1273
01:20:46.081 --> 01:20:49.920
and the rest you can go to [inaudible] dot com bur for,
for uh,
for dates.
See,

1274
01:20:49.921 --> 01:20:52.890
and that's why I don't hype shit in the middle because it's not funny.

1275
01:20:52.980 --> 01:20:57.690
It's not fucking interesting.
And uh,
then what happens?
You're like,
what?

1276
01:20:57.810 --> 01:21:00.840
This guy's going to riff about fucking candy bars and musicians I don't give a

1277
01:21:00.841 --> 01:21:03.300
fuck about and then tell me where he's going to be at.

1278
01:21:04.470 --> 01:21:08.340
Let me tell you guys a story.
The other day I decided,
you know,

1279
01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:11.910
I really need to get my ass in shape so I don't look like a fat fuck on TV

1280
01:21:11.911 --> 01:21:14.790
during my special.
So,
um,

1281
01:21:14.820 --> 01:21:17.820
I have problems with joining gyms because I'm always on the road.

1282
01:21:18.120 --> 01:21:20.440
I have to freeze my membership and all that type of shit.

1283
01:21:20.570 --> 01:21:21.690
I just throw the money away.

1284
01:21:21.691 --> 01:21:26.691
So I had been working out outside basically in my apartment and then I do cardio

1285
01:21:27.241 --> 01:21:32.130
outside just like that fucking guy with all the Matthew mcconaughey.

1286
01:21:32.280 --> 01:21:34.110
There you go.
You know,

1287
01:21:34.140 --> 01:21:37.830
I do keep my shirt on and I don't run down the street with fucking palm tree

1288
01:21:37.831 --> 01:21:42.780
leaves like I'm trying to fly and it's 1898.
I don't do that shit.
All right.

1289
01:21:43.290 --> 01:21:45.120
But I've definitely been going on hikes.

1290
01:21:45.180 --> 01:21:49.830
So I found this hill out here and uh,
being a big football fan,

1291
01:21:49.831 --> 01:21:53.460
I remember how Jerry Rice used to run up this fucking hill,
you know,

1292
01:21:53.461 --> 01:21:56.790
to get in training for the,
uh,
the NFL season.

1293
01:21:56.880 --> 01:22:01.760
And I found a hill and I've been running up this fucking thing and uh,

1294
01:22:02.010 --> 01:22:04.320
been loving every minute of it.
And um,

1295
01:22:05.700 --> 01:22:09.870
I went up to go do it and I came home and my fucking,
I couldn't find my keys

1296
01:22:11.550 --> 01:22:13.440
like an asshole.
I left the,
uh,

1297
01:22:13.441 --> 01:22:18.330
my pocket open on my sweatpants and because I'm old and when I run down the

1298
01:22:18.331 --> 01:22:21.420
hill,
I can't run down the hill.
I have to sort of Gallup,

1299
01:22:23.660 --> 01:22:26.160
that's fucking pathetic.
And a,

1300
01:22:26.161 --> 01:22:29.250
I was going really fast and I guess it kind of flew out a fucking rattlesnake

1301
01:22:29.251 --> 01:22:30.360
took it.
I don't know what happened,

1302
01:22:30.361 --> 01:22:33.150
but I went back up there to try and find them.
And I don't have them.

1303
01:22:34.020 --> 01:22:38.640
And you're like,
wow,
what's the big fucking deal?
You know?
Why don't you,

1304
01:22:38.680 --> 01:22:43.620
Oh shit.
Did I just fucking knock something out here?
What the hell just happened?

1305
01:22:43.650 --> 01:22:47.670
Hello.
Test one,
two.
I know you can hear this,
but I can't hear myself.

1306
01:22:47.671 --> 01:22:52.050
What the fuck is going on?
Hold on.
Hello.

1307
01:22:52.770 --> 01:22:57.030
I know it's recording.
What the fuck is the problem line in?
That's good.

1308
01:22:57.990 --> 01:23:02.550
Your phones.
That's fine.
Hello?
Test.
There we go.
I got it back.
Sorry.

1309
01:23:04.290 --> 01:23:07.060
Jesus Christ know what is my fucking rooms getting so God damn hot.

1310
01:23:07.061 --> 01:23:10.450
I have to turn on the fucking ceiling fan.
Hang on a second.

1311
01:23:10.451 --> 01:23:11.830
I can't do this all at once.

1312
01:23:19.780 --> 01:23:22.090
You know if at any sort of class,
I'd edit that part out,

1313
01:23:22.091 --> 01:23:27.080
but I'm not going to [inaudible].
So anyways.
Yeah,

1314
01:23:27.260 --> 01:23:29.860
so I lost my fucking keys and like anybody,
any normal person,

1315
01:23:29.861 --> 01:23:33.670
if I had a normal fucking car,
oh,
that's what I did.
I turn this thing down.

1316
01:23:33.700 --> 01:23:38.410
That's what happened.
Ah,
there we go.
Hello.
Test one,

1317
01:23:38.411 --> 01:23:43.180
two.
Wow.
Just when you thought it couldn't get any worse.
This is why it's free,

1318
01:23:43.181 --> 01:23:48.070
folks.
This is why it is fucking free.
Like a one man band here.

1319
01:23:48.100 --> 01:23:50.110
I should have like symbols between my legs.

1320
01:23:51.250 --> 01:23:54.790
How fucking easy was it to be a goddamn entertainer back in the day that,
that,

1321
01:23:54.791 --> 01:23:57.670
that that's what you could have you ever seen one of those one man band guys.

1322
01:23:57.950 --> 01:23:58.960
It's never good.

1323
01:23:59.710 --> 01:24:03.130
It's never fucking good when somebody does like a throwback to that shit and

1324
01:24:03.150 --> 01:24:07.660
they get symbols between their legs and a base drum behind their back.
Great.

1325
01:24:07.661 --> 01:24:11.740
I turned the fan on too high and I'm blowing shit off my fucking desk.
Um,

1326
01:24:12.700 --> 01:24:17.260
anyways.
Yeah.
So I can't find my keys and um,
you know,

1327
01:24:17.261 --> 01:24:18.460
the house keys,
no big deal.

1328
01:24:18.461 --> 01:24:23.461
But the problem was was it was also the key to my car and I drive a hybrid and

1329
01:24:24.071 --> 01:24:28.060
it's this special fucking key to special key people.

1330
01:24:28.061 --> 01:24:30.550
They couldn't just give me a regular key where you stick it in the door and

1331
01:24:30.551 --> 01:24:31.690
shove it in the ignition.

1332
01:24:33.220 --> 01:24:35.560
This is like one of these keys where you can have it in your pocket and you

1333
01:24:35.561 --> 01:24:36.550
don't need to take it out,

1334
01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:40.540
and then you just fucking reach and touch the door and it magically unlocks

1335
01:24:41.290 --> 01:24:46.120
because some sort of wave is coming out of the pocket,
going to the door lock,

1336
01:24:46.390 --> 01:24:51.010
bouncing back off and putting cancer into your testicles.
You know?

1337
01:24:51.400 --> 01:24:52.420
That's what I'm basically doing.

1338
01:24:52.620 --> 01:24:57.580
I'm risking ball cancer so I don't have to fucking unlike my door the

1339
01:24:57.581 --> 01:25:00.310
conventional way.
But the bottom line is you want to,
you're probably wondering,

1340
01:25:00.311 --> 01:25:00.671
well bill,

1341
01:25:00.671 --> 01:25:05.671
how much does this pocket ball cancer fucking car key cost?

1342
01:25:06.780 --> 01:25:10.390
Evidently it's between two two in 300 bucks.
I remember when I bought the car,

1343
01:25:10.391 --> 01:25:12.190
I made sure you'd all wooziness Merck,
shrewd,

1344
01:25:12.330 --> 01:25:16.110
all losers because we call story tool $224 to park grumble,
blah,
blah,
blah.

1345
01:25:16.500 --> 01:25:19.090
And I was thinking in my head,
wow,
that sounds like a fucking rip off to me.

1346
01:25:20.140 --> 01:25:24.110
Really,
that little plastic thing.
So I don't,

1347
01:25:24.200 --> 01:25:27.100
and I went back up the hill and I tried to find the fucking thing and I couldn't

1348
01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:32.080
once again,
you know,
I went up there and it's actually really these,

1349
01:25:32.081 --> 01:25:35.410
these unbelievable houses like um,

1350
01:25:36.580 --> 01:25:39.670
like rich people,
but like classy rich,
not like a,

1351
01:25:40.480 --> 01:25:45.310
not Jerry Jones rich,
you know what I mean?
Classy,
tasteful,
rich,
you know,

1352
01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:49.720
and I was walking down the hill and I was looking for the keys and I came down

1353
01:25:49.721 --> 01:25:54.721
and this is fucking all gay is walking up the street and right as I was about

1354
01:25:55.520 --> 01:25:59.260
ready to say hello to him,
you know,
rich people are so like they,

1355
01:25:59.261 --> 01:26:02.830
some of them just have the,
they have an inability to lake,

1356
01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:07.250
just have a conversation.
It's like I'm walking down the street,

1357
01:26:07.251 --> 01:26:11.930
he's coming up the hill,
he sees me and I'm just be like,
hey,
how are you?

1358
01:26:11.990 --> 01:26:14.900
That's all I'm going to say.
He just,
this is what,
this is how he greets me.

1359
01:26:15.170 --> 01:26:19.760
He just goes,
beautiful fall afternoon.

1360
01:26:23.100 --> 01:26:24.960
I didn't know what the fuck to say to that.

1361
01:26:24.961 --> 01:26:29.961
And he said it that loud and it took him that like he drew out the words

1362
01:26:30.631 --> 01:26:33.900
beautiful fall afternoon.

1363
01:26:35.490 --> 01:26:37.950
You know what should have happened right after he said that,
you know,
in those,

1364
01:26:37.951 --> 01:26:40.770
the original monster movies of Hollywood,
you know,

1365
01:26:40.771 --> 01:26:44.910
that church organ that they,
you know,
and then the lightening strikes,

1366
01:26:44.911 --> 01:26:48.040
that's what the fuck should happen.
After that guy talked,
it's like,
Whoa,

1367
01:26:48.990 --> 01:26:50.850
what are you just naming shit that you like?

1368
01:26:52.020 --> 01:26:55.830
Like I didn't know socially what I was supposed to say after beautiful fall

1369
01:26:55.831 --> 01:27:00.340
after noon,
um,

1370
01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:04.450
half off Budweiser's at a titty bar.

1371
01:27:07.180 --> 01:27:07.840
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1372
01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:10.320
<v 7>What do you say to that?
I don't know what the fuck to say to the guy and I,</v>

1373
01:27:10.321 --> 01:27:15.010
I just sorta went.
Yeah,
yeah,
it is.

1374
01:27:16.120 --> 01:27:19.540
It's a nice one.
Just kept fucking walk.

1375
01:27:22.360 --> 01:27:23.193
<v 3>Ugh.</v>

1376
01:27:24.040 --> 01:27:27.010
<v 7>With the fire.
It was like,
I was trying to think like what question I could have.</v>

1377
01:27:28.950 --> 01:27:33.530
I was thinking he's playing a board game in his head or he played the first five

1378
01:27:33.531 --> 01:27:36.920
notes,
so to a song and I said,
ah,
what is the name of that song?
Uh,

1379
01:27:36.950 --> 01:27:40.130
tell me what is it?
It's called beautiful fall afternoon.
That's what it's called.

1380
01:27:41.590 --> 01:27:44.410
Um,
anyway,
so I walked back up there and I just kept saying to people,

1381
01:27:44.950 --> 01:27:49.730
[inaudible] you have,
is she a shed a quiche?
And they'd be like,
no,
no,

1382
01:27:49.731 --> 01:27:54.290
I didn't.
Um,
but if I find them,
I will,

1383
01:27:54.830 --> 01:27:58.880
uh,
and I had no information to give him.
And I was just like,
yeah,

1384
01:27:58.881 --> 01:28:02.180
just sort of stick them on a rock,
go on a rock.

1385
01:28:02.181 --> 01:28:05.750
And maybe I'll come walking by and I'll fucking,
you know,
but I held out hope.

1386
01:28:05.810 --> 01:28:09.500
I was like,
you know what,
it's a park.
There's a lost and found.

1387
01:28:09.590 --> 01:28:11.990
I'll go there tomorrow when the lost and found is open.

1388
01:28:12.290 --> 01:28:17.290
And I went there hoping against hope that for once in my life I lost something

1389
01:28:17.361 --> 01:28:20.510
in public and somebody actually returned it,
you know?

1390
01:28:20.540 --> 01:28:23.000
Do you remember that from back in the day when I lost my cell phone,

1391
01:28:23.150 --> 01:28:26.670
my girlfriend since I been with her has probably lost three cell phones and any

1392
01:28:26.900 --> 01:28:31.790
time she loses his cell phone,
all she does is call it.
She calls it.

1393
01:28:31.970 --> 01:28:34.910
And not only does somebody pick it up,
it is the greatest

1394
01:28:36.550 --> 01:28:40.990
person on the planet.
You know,
I should just call up and I'm thinking my head.

1395
01:28:40.991 --> 01:28:44.080
Then I was going to answer this shit.
It's gone.
Just like mine is always gone.

1396
01:28:44.081 --> 01:28:48.430
And then she calls,
you know,
one and a half ring.
Somebody just picks it up.
Hello.

1397
01:28:48.910 --> 01:28:52.480
Well,
yes I do.
Absolutely.
Come on over.
I'll give it to you.

1398
01:28:52.630 --> 01:28:54.880
I actually just bake some cookies.
Come on over.

1399
01:28:54.881 --> 01:28:58.120
I'll give you a fresh cookies and your fucking cell phone back because that's

1400
01:28:58.121 --> 01:28:59.830
how your life works,
right?

1401
01:29:01.380 --> 01:29:05.910
I lose my mind in the back of a fucking car is fucking douchebag is driving me

1402
01:29:05.911 --> 01:29:08.340
to the airport.
I realize it like a half hour later.

1403
01:29:08.341 --> 01:29:12.900
I know we still working and the phone is on and it's ringing in his fucking back

1404
01:29:12.901 --> 01:29:14.310
seat in the can.
Doesn't answer it.

1405
01:29:16.440 --> 01:29:18.780
So that has been my experience.

1406
01:29:18.781 --> 01:29:21.780
So I go over to the little ranger Rick thing going on,
please.
There may be,

1407
01:29:21.781 --> 01:29:24.960
this is the one time keep a positive attitude,
put it out to the universe.

1408
01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:28.770
I'm going to get my $200 set of keys back and of course I show up and they're

1409
01:29:28.771 --> 01:29:32.640
like,
uh,
no.
Nobody has returned any keys.
You,

1410
01:29:32.641 --> 01:29:35.550
if you want to check back later and giggling at,
rarely.

1411
01:29:35.910 --> 01:29:37.500
Rarely am I really gonna come back later.
You know,

1412
01:29:37.501 --> 01:29:39.980
I'm not going to come back later.
So just spare me the speech,
right.

1413
01:29:41.100 --> 01:29:45.720
Just go fucking change the chances of fire sign out there.

1414
01:29:45.721 --> 01:29:47.580
Why don't you just go fucking do that.
You're like,
oh man.

1415
01:29:47.581 --> 01:29:52.581
At the park ranger because I ran with my AMF fucking sweat pants with the sides.

1416
01:29:53.581 --> 01:29:58.470
Unzipped like an asshole.
Like a fucking asshole.
All right.

1417
01:29:58.650 --> 01:30:01.800
Last week I talked about this guy who I wanted to uh,

1418
01:30:03.060 --> 01:30:06.750
flattened his nose while I sent my fist all the way to the back of his fucking

1419
01:30:06.751 --> 01:30:11.751
cranium stopping just short of the hypothalamus and I was talking about fights

1420
01:30:12.450 --> 01:30:13.830
and uh,

1421
01:30:13.890 --> 01:30:17.640
just how when you get older you have to walk away from fights because there's no

1422
01:30:17.641 --> 01:30:22.470
winning.
There really isn't.
When you get old,
it's just like,
okay,

1423
01:30:22.471 --> 01:30:26.670
either a,
I get out of the car and I get the living shit kicked out of me.

1424
01:30:27.150 --> 01:30:31.350
Right?
Or B,
I win and then I get sued.

1425
01:30:32.280 --> 01:30:35.880
Right.
And the older you get,
the the,

1426
01:30:35.881 --> 01:30:39.350
the greater chance of the first one,
which is,
I don't know.

1427
01:30:39.390 --> 01:30:41.220
What do you think's worse?
Getting the shit kicked out of you?

1428
01:30:42.390 --> 01:30:44.690
I think getting sued is worse,
but as long as it depends on the,

1429
01:30:44.700 --> 01:30:47.220
the level of ass kicking.
I don't want to lose a tooth,
but you know,

1430
01:30:47.221 --> 01:30:49.320
if you want to beat me down,
I have a headache for three days.

1431
01:30:49.500 --> 01:30:52.740
I'd rather have that than deal with you.
Fucking taken my money.
So anyways.

1432
01:30:54.720 --> 01:30:55.170
Um,

1433
01:30:55.170 --> 01:31:00.120
so a lot of people sent me in some unbelievable stories about fights that either

1434
01:31:00.121 --> 01:31:03.090
they walked away from or that they got into.

1435
01:31:03.510 --> 01:31:07.350
I'm one of them is actually a case pending,
so I'm not allowed to talk about it.

1436
01:31:07.351 --> 01:31:08.460
So I'll basically,

1437
01:31:08.910 --> 01:31:13.910
I'll skim over it is basically a kid is walking down the street and three drunk

1438
01:31:15.241 --> 01:31:18.060
guys start giving him shit.
He gives him shit back.

1439
01:31:18.810 --> 01:31:20.970
They give him some more shit and he says,
Oh yeah,

1440
01:31:21.090 --> 01:31:22.610
you guys are real tough with three.

1441
01:31:22.950 --> 01:31:26.370
None of you would fight me one on one and this one kid goes,
all right,

1442
01:31:26.371 --> 01:31:31.110
I'll fight you.
So they square off,
they'd throw a few in the dough.

1443
01:31:31.170 --> 01:31:32.800
The kid who was just part of,
you know,
the,

1444
01:31:32.910 --> 01:31:36.210
the innocent kid connected hit the kid.

1445
01:31:36.211 --> 01:31:39.840
The kid falls down and hits the back of his head on the pavement.
He,
you know,

1446
01:31:39.870 --> 01:31:43.920
and he's not fucking moving.
And the kid's like,
holy fuck,
what did I do?

1447
01:31:43.921 --> 01:31:46.470
So he's kind of walking away,
but he's also concerned,

1448
01:31:46.590 --> 01:31:51.590
his big fucking mistake was he actually gave a shit and then the cops showed up.

1449
01:31:53.100 --> 01:31:57.360
He was still in sight.
He got fucking,
uh,
uh,
did they arrest him?
I can't remember.

1450
01:31:57.630 --> 01:32:00.850
All I know was in the end of it,
this,

1451
01:32:01.510 --> 01:32:03.310
there's three of them and only one of him.

1452
01:32:03.311 --> 01:32:08.311
And he ended up getting sued and lost something about a preemptive strike.

1453
01:32:10.180 --> 01:32:11.980
Can you fucking believe that?
I was like,
Oh,
I'm sorry.

1454
01:32:11.981 --> 01:32:16.000
Was I supposed to let the one guy with the two other friends hit me a couple

1455
01:32:16.001 --> 01:32:19.540
times and then I was supposed to punch back is fucking unbelievable.

1456
01:32:20.260 --> 01:32:24.850
It's unbelievable.
Just A,
I don't know.
So there was a lot of people going like,

1457
01:32:24.940 --> 01:32:26.890
oh,
I want to kick the shit out of this guy.
What should I do?

1458
01:32:26.891 --> 01:32:28.900
You know what you should do?
We should just fucking walk away.

1459
01:32:30.040 --> 01:32:33.280
Just walk away and just forget about the whole fucking thing.

1460
01:32:33.400 --> 01:32:37.120
And don't even tell yourself that lie that he'll get his,
he'll get his,

1461
01:32:37.330 --> 01:32:39.570
cause you know what,
they don't,
they don't get there.

1462
01:32:39.650 --> 01:32:42.130
So you know what they do is they get punched in the face,

1463
01:32:42.131 --> 01:32:46.720
may be in the worst case scenario is they win 10 grand.
Um,

1464
01:32:47.290 --> 01:32:50.620
they don't,
they don't.
I,
I've lived long enough to realize that,
you know,

1465
01:32:50.621 --> 01:32:54.580
when the bad guy gets his in the movies,
that's when it happens.
Okay.

1466
01:32:54.640 --> 01:32:58.420
The rest of them go on to live very successful lives.

1467
01:33:01.690 --> 01:33:04.120
They have great looking girlfriends.
They a porous,

1468
01:33:04.121 --> 01:33:08.530
raw sewage into drinking water and they find some other Dick to take the fall

1469
01:33:08.531 --> 01:33:08.921
for it.

1470
01:33:08.921 --> 01:33:13.300
And then they buy land in South America and they leave the country and they're

1471
01:33:13.301 --> 01:33:18.030
fine.
They're fucking find.
So,
uh,
you're better to just,

1472
01:33:18.031 --> 01:33:22.140
just walk away.
Somebody gave me some great advice saying that,
uh,
the,

1473
01:33:22.150 --> 01:33:25.690
he used to get into fights all the time.
This is so simple.

1474
01:33:25.691 --> 01:33:26.770
I never even thought of it.

1475
01:33:26.980 --> 01:33:31.450
He just bought a heavy bag and he would come home and he would just beat the

1476
01:33:31.451 --> 01:33:35.170
shit out of the bag and he felt way better and there was no lawsuits.

1477
01:33:35.380 --> 01:33:38.200
And then certain days when he wanted to murder somebody,

1478
01:33:38.201 --> 01:33:41.740
he would take a baseball bat and just slam it into the heavy bag.

1479
01:33:42.280 --> 01:33:46.540
And he would feel phenomenal afterwards.
And,
uh,

1480
01:33:48.660 --> 01:33:52.600
I,
I liked,
I want to,
I want to believe that that works.

1481
01:33:54.460 --> 01:33:57.340
I don't know.
I have an insane temper.
I take it to the point of,

1482
01:33:57.370 --> 01:34:01.900
I want to feel that other guy quit.
That's how mad I am.

1483
01:34:02.080 --> 01:34:05.020
I want to beat the fuck out of you.
I want you to fight back,

1484
01:34:05.021 --> 01:34:09.310
but I want to feel the moment where you fucking quit.
You know how sick is that?

1485
01:34:09.670 --> 01:34:10.271
That's how mad.

1486
01:34:10.271 --> 01:34:15.190
I just can't see that getting that out with the fucking heavy bag.
All right,

1487
01:34:15.191 --> 01:34:17.770
so let's read a couple of stories here.
These were very long.

1488
01:34:17.771 --> 01:34:21.760
This was a very passionate subject.
Um,

1489
01:34:21.761 --> 01:34:25.540
so forgive me with my awful reading here goes,
I'm gonna read a couple of these.

1490
01:34:26.740 --> 01:34:29.470
Um,
all right.
Uh,
here's,

1491
01:34:29.471 --> 01:34:32.050
here's the classic like this.

1492
01:34:32.051 --> 01:34:35.200
This is like anger that will come out of you 20 years from now.

1493
01:34:35.380 --> 01:34:39.520
Here's a great story here.
Uh,
Bill,
I sympathize about the whole fight thing.
Um,

1494
01:34:39.521 --> 01:34:43.390
it seems like anytime some asshole decides to start shit with me,

1495
01:34:43.690 --> 01:34:48.400
it will happen in a war in a way that I can't retaliate without either getting

1496
01:34:48.401 --> 01:34:52.420
arrested or sued.
Literally what I was just talking about.
He goes,
so anyways,

1497
01:34:52.750 --> 01:34:55.560
I was at a packed bar with some friends the other night and uh,

1498
01:34:55.630 --> 01:35:00.290
we had gotten there about a half hour prior and I had about a one beer in me,

1499
01:35:00.291 --> 01:35:04.700
so I wasn't even remotely drunk.
Um,
I guess the place was packed.
So anyways,

1500
01:35:04.701 --> 01:35:05.780
he's a,
she says,

1501
01:35:05.790 --> 01:35:09.800
I was making my way through the crowd with a pint glass in my hand trying to

1502
01:35:09.801 --> 01:35:12.230
navigate to the bathroom along the way,

1503
01:35:12.231 --> 01:35:17.210
some scrawny little cunt who apparently has had way too much to drink,

1504
01:35:17.390 --> 01:35:22.390
backs into me and spills half my beer and make a habit out of quickly saying,

1505
01:35:24.291 --> 01:35:24.981
excuse me,

1506
01:35:24.981 --> 01:35:28.970
and thank you whenever I walk through a crowd because I figure people are more

1507
01:35:28.971 --> 01:35:31.490
apt to let you through if you're polite about things.

1508
01:35:31.640 --> 01:35:34.420
This prick turns around and says,
this is the guy who,

1509
01:35:34.460 --> 01:35:36.860
who bumps into him and spills half as his beer.
He said,

1510
01:35:36.861 --> 01:35:39.620
this prick turns around and says,
what the fuck is your problem?

1511
01:35:40.070 --> 01:35:42.650
And knocks my drink out of my hand.

1512
01:35:43.880 --> 01:35:47.930
Jesus Christ.
You ought to be able to take a fucking wrench to that guy's head.

1513
01:35:49.580 --> 01:35:51.080
Um,
he said at this point,

1514
01:35:51.081 --> 01:35:55.940
one of his friends jumps on him trying to break it up while the little bitch

1515
01:35:55.941 --> 01:35:59.270
keeps talking shit.
So I tell them to go fuck himself.

1516
01:35:59.570 --> 01:36:03.290
It was going to talk shit till the prick would,
uh,
would throw a punch.

1517
01:36:03.500 --> 01:36:04.850
But just at that moment,

1518
01:36:04.880 --> 01:36:09.880
a guy standing next to us wearing a blazer but with some kind of shirt sweater

1519
01:36:10.611 --> 01:36:13.910
that was,
that wasn't buttoned down,

1520
01:36:13.911 --> 01:36:16.490
tells me forcefully keep walking.

1521
01:36:17.450 --> 01:36:21.650
At that moment I figured it was one of the bouncers pissed off over having lost

1522
01:36:21.651 --> 01:36:26.450
a drink and being insulted.
Uh,
I head to the bathroom,
my window to fight.

1523
01:36:26.451 --> 01:36:29.630
That shit had open and closed so quickly that I didn't get a chance at any

1524
01:36:30.350 --> 01:36:31.730
vindication.
When I got to the bathroom,

1525
01:36:31.731 --> 01:36:36.440
I noticed that the guy who I thought was a bouncer was it,
um,
maybe he was,

1526
01:36:36.980 --> 01:36:40.460
maybe he was this little clowns,
a bodyguard,
but I couldn't tell.

1527
01:36:40.610 --> 01:36:42.200
He didn't seem like one,

1528
01:36:42.710 --> 01:36:45.410
he didn't seem like one of his friends because the little cut in his friends

1529
01:36:45.411 --> 01:36:49.310
were all dressed the same way with designer ripped jeans and opened button down

1530
01:36:49.311 --> 01:36:50.900
shirts with necklaces and shit.

1531
01:36:51.170 --> 01:36:54.740
Basically they all look like they were members of some eighties rock band that

1532
01:36:54.741 --> 01:36:59.360
was still touring but couldn't get but can only get gigs in a dive bar.
Um,

1533
01:36:59.361 --> 01:37:04.010
now my chance,
my choices are either,
okay,
now he's in the bathroom.
Uh,
he says,

1534
01:37:04.011 --> 01:37:07.760
now my choices are either walked back to my group without a beer

1535
01:37:09.470 --> 01:37:14.060
or a the bitch move of telling one of the bouncers and seeing if I can get that

1536
01:37:14.061 --> 01:37:18.140
prick tossed out.
Um,
I could also go and confront them,

1537
01:37:18.860 --> 01:37:22.970
but even if I could take the bodyguard,
um,

1538
01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.700
what kind of person goes to a bar dressed with that ed?

1539
01:37:26.060 --> 01:37:29.780
The clothing with the girl.
What did I just miss here?
Sorry.

1540
01:37:29.781 --> 01:37:33.980
This is really fucking long and I'm seeing double here.
Ah,
fuck.

1541
01:37:34.100 --> 01:37:37.770
You just killed the whole story bill.
What is wrong with you?
Confront him,

1542
01:37:38.270 --> 01:37:39.021
which from his size,

1543
01:37:39.021 --> 01:37:42.510
I think I stared a good chance as long he was an MMA fighter.
Uh,

1544
01:37:42.590 --> 01:37:45.110
this was in New Jersey.
Mind you.
So I thought,
uh,

1545
01:37:45.650 --> 01:37:49.460
I thought considering he was Italian looking and had a girl that was way out of

1546
01:37:49.461 --> 01:37:53.090
his league,
maybe he was connected or some bullshit like that.
Maybe a,

1547
01:37:53.091 --> 01:37:56.490
the little prick even had a gun or a knife on him because stupid shit like that

1548
01:37:56.610 --> 01:37:59.730
is happening off thing.
I didn't want to take any shit from him,

1549
01:37:59.940 --> 01:38:04.270
but I'm not about to get shot over a beer anyways.
It's,

1550
01:38:04.271 --> 01:38:05.450
so this is what he ends up doing.
He goes,

1551
01:38:05.460 --> 01:38:08.970
ended up walking back to my group without a beer and hiding my bad mood for the

1552
01:38:08.971 --> 01:38:13.320
rest of the night.
One on one with either one of those cons,
I would've been fine.

1553
01:38:13.321 --> 01:38:18.150
I'm five,
1,195 pounds and mostly muscle and I've never lost a fight.
Then again,

1554
01:38:18.151 --> 01:38:21.600
I've only been in a few.
I'll spare the rest of this shit.
Um,

1555
01:38:22.320 --> 01:38:24.540
I don't know if he's asking me what I can't even remember.
I just,

1556
01:38:24.840 --> 01:38:28.770
I get a headache when I have to read that much,
so,
you know what I mean?

1557
01:38:28.860 --> 01:38:31.020
It's like,
and do you think that little,
maybe that little fuck,

1558
01:38:31.140 --> 01:38:35.130
we'll get his because he's so like I could see knocking it over and be like,

1559
01:38:35.131 --> 01:38:38.220
dude,
what the fuck's your problem?
That's sort of your average asshole in a bar,

1560
01:38:38.221 --> 01:38:40.290
but then slap it out of your hand.

1561
01:38:41.250 --> 01:38:45.330
He's got that Napoleon thing where he's got something to prove,
I guess.
Um,

1562
01:38:46.620 --> 01:38:48.870
I don't know.
My question is,
what do you do with that anger?

1563
01:38:49.740 --> 01:38:54.540
What do you do with that fucking anger?
Anyways,
here's an alarm bill.

1564
01:38:54.780 --> 01:38:57.620
Uh,
you were talking about this week about nearly getting into a fight with that

1565
01:38:57.621 --> 01:38:58.950
Dick and the green sedan.
Well,

1566
01:38:58.951 --> 01:39:01.560
I admit that this wasn't anywhere close to me fighting.

1567
01:39:01.830 --> 01:39:06.150
It was still a fucking horror story while it happened.
All right,

1568
01:39:06.151 --> 01:39:09.900
here's one here that will leave you with a lot of anger.
Uh,

1569
01:39:09.901 --> 01:39:12.900
I was about six months into my standup career in a friend of mine asked me to do

1570
01:39:12.900 --> 01:39:17.850
,
to do a show with him at this bar that paid them a,
that pay would pay $20.

1571
01:39:18.390 --> 01:39:20.670
I was psyched because it would be my first paid show.

1572
01:39:20.910 --> 01:39:23.400
I did the show and got a decent amount of laughs.

1573
01:39:23.640 --> 01:39:25.700
I thought I did fucking horribly,
but uh,

1574
01:39:25.800 --> 01:39:29.340
if they left and I'm not going to complain.
So he gets paid his money.

1575
01:39:29.341 --> 01:39:30.330
The next day I'm walking,

1576
01:39:30.720 --> 01:39:35.100
I'm walking home from school and I'm cutting through the basketball courts where

1577
01:39:35.101 --> 01:39:35.911
a drug dealer,

1578
01:39:35.911 --> 01:39:39.600
I know we'll call him drug dealer number one is sitting there with one of his

1579
01:39:39.601 --> 01:39:43.470
friends,
the friends he was sitting with kind of look like ghost face killer,

1580
01:39:43.890 --> 01:39:46.620
but he had a stare of a potential rapist.

1581
01:39:46.890 --> 01:39:49.650
Next thing I know I'm passing this guy and he stops me.

1582
01:39:49.890 --> 01:39:53.160
He tells me that if I don't give him my wallet,
which is visible,

1583
01:39:53.610 --> 01:39:56.460
which was visibly in my front pocket,

1584
01:39:56.640 --> 01:40:00.990
he was going to just stop me and take it.
He takes it and empties my lunch money.

1585
01:40:01.020 --> 01:40:05.700
Luckily,
or I thought,
luckily I kept a special 20 and a different compartment.

1586
01:40:06.030 --> 01:40:09.540
Now this is a lot of things a lot of comedians do or people who when they,

1587
01:40:09.570 --> 01:40:12.450
they set off on a dream,
the first amount of money they get,

1588
01:40:12.451 --> 01:40:13.710
it's usually not a lot of money.

1589
01:40:13.710 --> 01:40:17.660
So they either frame the check or they save the dollar,

1590
01:40:17.670 --> 01:40:18.900
the five bucks of the 20.

1591
01:40:18.901 --> 01:40:22.140
So I'm imagining that this is what this young comic was trying to do.

1592
01:40:22.710 --> 01:40:26.760
So we kept a $20 in the,
in a different compartment.
I said,
well,

1593
01:40:26.761 --> 01:40:31.230
he rummaged through the entire wallet,
put back my Larb library card,

1594
01:40:31.231 --> 01:40:34.890
the illiterate cunt,
and eventually found a $20 bill.

1595
01:40:35.220 --> 01:40:39.930
He threw the wallet my chest and asked me why I lied to him when he asked me if

1596
01:40:39.931 --> 01:40:42.720
I had any other money than any other money than the lunch money.

1597
01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:47.960
I actually told the guy mugging me the history of this hidden $20 bill as he

1598
01:40:49.191 --> 01:40:51.990
goes.
As I just typed that last sentence,

1599
01:40:51.991 --> 01:40:56.350
I just imagine my head slamming into the keyboard.
Um,
he says,
what a,

1600
01:40:56.410 --> 01:40:58.750
what a fag.
I was,
um,
so anyways,

1601
01:40:58.751 --> 01:41:02.260
this motherfucker told me that if I told them a good joke,

1602
01:41:02.470 --> 01:41:04.540
maybe I'd get the $20 back.

1603
01:41:05.020 --> 01:41:08.140
This is really your inexperience as a comedian because there's no joke you're

1604
01:41:08.141 --> 01:41:10.420
going to be able to tell.
So anyways,
here we go.
He said,
well,

1605
01:41:10.421 --> 01:41:14.230
I used to tell these awful one liners when I first started because my self

1606
01:41:14.231 --> 01:41:18.580
confidence would dwindle left at 10 to 15 seconds.
So I stammered out,

1607
01:41:19.090 --> 01:41:21.580
stammered out.
I knew this girl is so stupid.

1608
01:41:21.581 --> 01:41:25.270
The only reason why she knew her ABC's was because of hepatitis.

1609
01:41:26.260 --> 01:41:30.040
So then the drug dealer,
he fake laughed like a fucking maniac,

1610
01:41:30.070 --> 01:41:34.450
straightened up into a serious face and was just like,
get the fuck Outta here.

1611
01:41:39.130 --> 01:41:42.490
Wow.
Ah,
Jesus.

1612
01:41:42.820 --> 01:41:45.760
That'll age you about fucking eight years.
Anyways,
the rest of it,

1613
01:41:45.761 --> 01:41:47.650
needless to say,
I took it like a bitch,

1614
01:41:48.040 --> 01:41:51.460
but if this story didn't have a punchline in and of itself,
here's the kicker.

1615
01:41:51.700 --> 01:41:55.690
Literally less than a week later after this incident,
this drug dealer from,

1616
01:41:55.960 --> 01:41:59.380
from my school,
big black kid with a voice like Mickey Mouse.

1617
01:42:00.040 --> 01:42:03.670
It's a fucking spectacle.
A tells me that drug dealer,
number one,

1618
01:42:03.671 --> 01:42:05.500
stop hanging out with the ghost face.

1619
01:42:05.501 --> 01:42:09.280
Killer guy because he's an undercover fucking cop.

1620
01:42:10.240 --> 01:42:13.630
So this dude got mugged by an undercover fucking cop.

1621
01:42:14.230 --> 01:42:17.920
So for all you,
for all your talk about getting screwed by corporations,

1622
01:42:17.921 --> 01:42:22.780
that's the worst case of being deep dicked by the man that's ever happened to

1623
01:42:22.781 --> 01:42:23.614
me.

1624
01:42:23.830 --> 01:42:28.150
And then I realized in retrospect that even though I lost the first remanence of

1625
01:42:28.151 --> 01:42:30.820
what I'd hope B would be a successful career,

1626
01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.970
the losing of my first $20 was well worth the story.

1627
01:42:34.150 --> 01:42:36.910
I still hope that cop is shot in the line of duty,

1628
01:42:37.240 --> 01:42:41.110
in skull fucked by a gang of junkies.
See that?
That's the fucking anger.

1629
01:42:42.070 --> 01:42:45.490
That is the anger.
Um,
I dunno,

1630
01:42:45.610 --> 01:42:49.090
I don't know how many listeners I have at this point cause I don't really hight

1631
01:42:49.091 --> 01:42:51.910
this fucking thing and I never bring it up at shows.
Are there any,
uh,

1632
01:42:51.940 --> 01:42:54.790
psychologists out there?
You know,

1633
01:42:55.720 --> 01:42:59.140
psychologists like they know what to do with anger is fucking sweater wearing

1634
01:42:59.600 --> 01:43:03.010
douchebags just sitting there.
They're loafers.
He ever go to therapy,

1635
01:43:04.240 --> 01:43:06.700
he's fucking tell him shit and they're just like,
whoa.
What do you think?

1636
01:43:06.701 --> 01:43:10.690
You think that,
what would happen if you would do something like that?

1637
01:43:12.040 --> 01:43:15.850
It's just like,
it really is.
That's all you got.
You know,

1638
01:43:16.300 --> 01:43:21.190
they just basically get you to pour out all your shit and then you've got to

1639
01:43:21.191 --> 01:43:25.040
sort of figure it out.
I don't even what the f you know,
it's fucking hilarious.

1640
01:43:25.041 --> 01:43:28.750
I had been in therapy for a while now obviously it's not fucking working.

1641
01:43:29.980 --> 01:43:34.840
I'm anyways,
let's plow ahead here.
Um,
did I talk about this last week?

1642
01:43:34.841 --> 01:43:38.560
Somebody sent me a,
uh,
somebody sent,
oh,

1643
01:43:38.650 --> 01:43:40.180
somebody sent me a,

1644
01:43:40.210 --> 01:43:45.210
an email and was talking about my why and then like now I hope this,

1645
01:43:46.120 --> 01:43:49.120
this podcast has been loud enough.
I think it is.
Um,

1646
01:43:50.440 --> 01:43:53.790
somebody sent me an email talking about some new movie coming out and in the

1647
01:43:53.791 --> 01:43:57.020
subject,
the thing,
the,
the line in the movie,

1648
01:43:57.050 --> 01:43:59.390
the lion on the subject line said,
um,

1649
01:43:59.660 --> 01:44:04.660
another save the black kid movie and it said bill from various clips on Youtube.

1650
01:44:05.241 --> 01:44:09.200
I know you have some disdain for racist movies.
I was just wondering,

1651
01:44:09.201 --> 01:44:13.790
what's your feeling on the new one coming out with Sandra Bullock called the

1652
01:44:13.791 --> 01:44:18.510
blind side?
I guess it's about her helping some,
a black kid.

1653
01:44:18.511 --> 01:44:22.880
All right.
First of all,
this is what I love about this email is,
um,

1654
01:44:22.881 --> 01:44:25.140
and this is something that I've learned in standup comedy is you had,

1655
01:44:25.141 --> 01:44:28.590
you can't control how people process what you say.
Um,

1656
01:44:28.591 --> 01:44:32.520
I've never done a bit about another about save a black kid movies.

1657
01:44:32.550 --> 01:44:37.020
The name of the bit was,
uh,
white people are evil movies.

1658
01:44:37.680 --> 01:44:41.610
That's what it is.
And,
um,
I don't have,

1659
01:44:41.670 --> 01:44:43.860
obviously I have disdained for racist movies,

1660
01:44:43.861 --> 01:44:48.180
but like what the fuck movie was I talking about in my last special,

1661
01:44:48.600 --> 01:44:53.160
that one about the black swim team.
Uh,
what the fuck was it called?

1662
01:44:53.170 --> 01:44:55.050
Poolside.
I can't ever remember.

1663
01:44:56.100 --> 01:44:58.620
What was it called against the tide?

1664
01:44:59.370 --> 01:45:01.350
The fuck was that movie called whatever,

1665
01:45:01.351 --> 01:45:05.940
whatever that fucking movie was called chlorine.
What was it called?

1666
01:45:07.250 --> 01:45:09.630
Did that shock for like fucking a year on stage?

1667
01:45:10.280 --> 01:45:13.740
If you guys seen that new movie came out,
blah,
blah,
blah.
I can't,

1668
01:45:13.741 --> 01:45:17.360
I'm trying to jog if my life,
I,
I have no memory.
But anyways,

1669
01:45:17.600 --> 01:45:21.590
that movie is not an example of a racist movie.

1670
01:45:21.591 --> 01:45:26.060
That's a movie about race.
And,
uh,
I have,

1671
01:45:26.120 --> 01:45:29.740
you know,
this is just a podcast listener.
So what the food,
you know,

1672
01:45:29.810 --> 01:45:32.870
I'm not really going to give this guy shit about that,

1673
01:45:32.871 --> 01:45:37.871
but I've actually had people write reviews about my act and says,

1674
01:45:38.240 --> 01:45:41.510
and was describing some of the stuff I talked to be talks about the difference

1675
01:45:41.511 --> 01:45:44.960
between men and women.
Uh,
he does racist jokes.

1676
01:45:45.200 --> 01:45:46.940
He does Bababa Blah.
It's like,

1677
01:45:46.941 --> 01:45:51.941
I don't do I do racial jokes about race or racial jokes?

1678
01:45:53.510 --> 01:45:57.770
A movie about race is a,
is a,
you could say it's a,

1679
01:45:57.771 --> 01:46:01.400
I guess a racial movie or,
yeah,
you'd say that it's not racist.

1680
01:46:02.180 --> 01:46:06.380
A racist movie would be,
um,
I dunno.

1681
01:46:07.030 --> 01:46:11.050
What's a fucking good example of it?
What does it good?
I mean,

1682
01:46:11.051 --> 01:46:14.710
Mississippi burning is not a racist movie.
It's a movie about racist.

1683
01:46:14.711 --> 01:46:19.560
But the movie itself is not racist,
but race relations,

1684
01:46:19.710 --> 01:46:22.740
right.
My out of my fucking mind here,
that,

1685
01:46:22.741 --> 01:46:26.250
what's that fucking one of the original Hollywood movies where they have white

1686
01:46:26.251 --> 01:46:30.690
dudes dressed up in black face and then make it black people look stupid.

1687
01:46:30.990 --> 01:46:35.220
And that is the message of the movie.
They're not,
they're not doing a movie.

1688
01:46:35.221 --> 01:46:39.570
They're making fun of white people who do that are talking about why people who

1689
01:46:39.571 --> 01:46:42.990
do that,
they are.
That is the message of the movie.

1690
01:46:43.980 --> 01:46:47.760
That black people are stupid.
That is a fucking racist movie.

1691
01:46:48.360 --> 01:46:51.720
See the difference?
What the fuck is the name of that movie?

1692
01:46:54.540 --> 01:46:56.340
What the fuck is the name of that movie?

1693
01:47:00.240 --> 01:47:03.970
Did you begin with an h?
I have no,
I gotta stop talking on my cell phone.
I'm,

1694
01:47:04.060 --> 01:47:07.170
you know what I'm not doing.
I'm fuck my cell phone.
That's it.
It's over.

1695
01:47:07.890 --> 01:47:12.210
All right.
The fuck is the name of that movie.
All right,

1696
01:47:13.560 --> 01:47:18.500
but get it.
Forget it.
I fucking give up.
I have to fucking,

1697
01:47:18.930 --> 01:47:21.990
ah,
I gotta look it up now guys,
this is something,
if you can hear it,
my voice,

1698
01:47:22.020 --> 01:47:24.060
this is actually something that's fucking scare in me,

1699
01:47:25.350 --> 01:47:29.210
is that I'm starting to lose my God damn memory.
Some actually made an ah,

1700
01:47:31.500 --> 01:47:34.230
the fuck is it?
Okay,
now

1701
01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:40.380
you know what?
Where the fuck is it?

1702
01:47:42.630 --> 01:47:45.030
I really should edit all this out,
but I'm not gonna do it.

1703
01:47:45.090 --> 01:47:49.110
I'm not going to do it.
Why am I saying everything twice?

1704
01:47:49.860 --> 01:47:53.670
You know why?
Because I'm trying to find something that somebody sent me.

1705
01:47:54.990 --> 01:47:59.990
They sent me a nice little MP3 remix of the thing and I had it all queued up and

1706
01:48:00.961 --> 01:48:05.370
I can't fucking find it.
You fucking asshole bill.

1707
01:48:05.400 --> 01:48:07.620
You really are an asshole.
You fucking worthless.

1708
01:48:08.540 --> 01:48:12.000
And this is why you have to fly out to fucking Omaha at some point and tell some

1709
01:48:12.001 --> 01:48:12.301
jokes.

1710
01:48:12.301 --> 01:48:15.540
You know I had last week I made fun of Omaha saying how I wasn't going to do a

1711
01:48:15.541 --> 01:48:19.650
show in Omaha and people were like,
you know,

1712
01:48:19.680 --> 01:48:21.000
I said eventually I would do one,

1713
01:48:21.001 --> 01:48:23.850
but I was making fun of how many fucking airplanes I would have to take to get

1714
01:48:23.851 --> 01:48:26.070
there and I got like five emails from people.

1715
01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:30.410
Actually there's a direct flight from book and Gig or dirt or do you really need

1716
01:48:30.500 --> 01:48:34.710
to no fucking corn field and you can just say it up fucking stage right bucket

1717
01:48:34.711 --> 01:48:38.520
in there.
Bill people in Omaha don't talk like that.
I don't give a shit.

1718
01:48:39.030 --> 01:48:41.430
I know they don't.
Johnny Carson was from Nebraska,
wasn't he?

1719
01:48:41.580 --> 01:48:45.780
All I remember about Nebraska was doing college gigs out there and you drive

1720
01:48:45.781 --> 01:48:50.781
halfway across the state and in your driving across 80 which goes the length of

1721
01:48:50.971 --> 01:48:54.720
this,
uh,
east west.
Here's something that truckers know.

1722
01:48:54.810 --> 01:48:59.160
Do you guys know this shit?
You know if you're on in an even numbered highway,

1723
01:48:59.161 --> 01:49:02.490
that means it goes east,
west.
And if you're on a odd one,

1724
01:49:02.491 --> 01:49:06.630
that means it's north south.
Did you know that?
Huh?

1725
01:49:07.140 --> 01:49:08.370
I'm talking about highways.

1726
01:49:08.400 --> 01:49:11.310
So don't even hit me with though we're route one goes really shut up.

1727
01:49:12.090 --> 01:49:15.840
Not talking about roots.
I'm talking about highways is another thing.

1728
01:49:16.020 --> 01:49:18.420
If you're on,
if you're on a highway,
right?

1729
01:49:18.421 --> 01:49:23.421
Let's just say it's 95 and you don't have a map all right in your,

1730
01:49:23.970 --> 01:49:28.970
and you see all of a sudden there's a four 95 or eight to 95 what that means is

1731
01:49:29.880 --> 01:49:33.810
you are coming towards a congested area and if it's during rush hour,

1732
01:49:33.811 --> 01:49:38.811
you can jump on the to 95 or the four 95 and it will basically eventually re

1733
01:49:39.361 --> 01:49:41.790
hook up with the highway.

1734
01:49:41.791 --> 01:49:45.690
You're on 95 and you can avoid the traffic.
And not add to it.

1735
01:49:46.260 --> 01:49:50.150
They did that one for truckers.
Um,
it's like an la,

1736
01:49:50.280 --> 01:49:53.380
the four oh five you got the five goes right to the heart of La,

1737
01:49:53.530 --> 01:49:55.930
the four oh five when it goes out around Santa Monica.

1738
01:49:55.931 --> 01:49:57.160
But there's so many fucking people,

1739
01:49:57.161 --> 01:50:00.790
it doesn't make a difference out here cause they're all jammed.
All right.

1740
01:50:01.630 --> 01:50:04.600
That's how much I know this fuck.
That's how much road work I've done.

1741
01:50:04.960 --> 01:50:09.960
So you get on the fucking 80 and you get about halfway across Nebraska.

1742
01:50:10.540 --> 01:50:11.380
And if you're like me,

1743
01:50:11.381 --> 01:50:13.480
you're doing a college gig in the middle of the winter time.

1744
01:50:13.481 --> 01:50:16.390
So all the crops are cut down.
All right?

1745
01:50:16.391 --> 01:50:19.600
And you can't tell where the fucking dirt ends in the sky begins.

1746
01:50:19.601 --> 01:50:22.930
It's just all fucking gray.
And all of a sudden,

1747
01:50:22.931 --> 01:50:27.931
out of nowhere there's like this wooden bridge footbridge or some native

1748
01:50:29.110 --> 01:50:32.770
American Indian shit.
You know,
I just,
you know,

1749
01:50:32.771 --> 01:50:34.510
many times I drove underneath that,

1750
01:50:34.540 --> 01:50:38.200
I don't even know what the fuck it is racing back to either flying out of

1751
01:50:38.201 --> 01:50:42.790
Lincoln or Omaha trying to get back to catch my early flight.

1752
01:50:43.720 --> 01:50:46.750
And I would literally be driving like a maniac and I be looking out to the right

1753
01:50:46.751 --> 01:50:50.500
and there would literally be like a flock of geese in that V,

1754
01:50:51.850 --> 01:50:55.630
that v formation.
You know the one that daffy duck was like,
fuck this.

1755
01:50:55.660 --> 01:50:59.170
I'm not going snow flies.
Don't bother me.
Remember that one?

1756
01:50:59.950 --> 01:51:01.150
I'd be seeing that shit.

1757
01:51:04.030 --> 01:51:05.230
I drove 80 I believe.

1758
01:51:05.231 --> 01:51:09.040
I drove 80 in Wyoming and I saw a kind of antelope.

1759
01:51:09.041 --> 01:51:13.510
I don't even know what the fuck it was.
I had no idea what the fuck it was.

1760
01:51:13.900 --> 01:51:17.590
Just saw like species of animals that I didn't even know fucking existed in this

1761
01:51:17.591 --> 01:51:22.210
country.
70 I remember 70 I've drove.

1762
01:51:22.300 --> 01:51:26.170
I've driven that one all the way from la all the way right into New York City.

1763
01:51:26.650 --> 01:51:29.380
You get it all the way to about Jersey and then you've got a fucking switch it

1764
01:51:29.381 --> 01:51:33.430
up.
It's fucking brutal.
Ben On all of them,

1765
01:51:33.730 --> 01:51:37.870
90 95
I think.

1766
01:51:37.871 --> 01:51:41.530
What is 35 go from Houston right up to Dallas and that fucking insane.

1767
01:51:42.100 --> 01:51:45.920
Then all of a sudden the years later I'd be up in IB in in like Iowa.
Go.
Now,

1768
01:51:46.050 --> 01:51:49.730
this is the same fucking highway that you take from fucking Houston to Dallas

1769
01:51:49.731 --> 01:51:51.460
and it goes right at the heart of this fucking country.

1770
01:51:51.460 --> 01:51:56.290
Isn't that fucking interesting?
Um,
yeah.

1771
01:51:56.320 --> 01:51:57.490
A lot of fucking road work.

1772
01:51:57.610 --> 01:52:00.370
I was supposed to be searching for the email and actually just lean back

1773
01:52:00.820 --> 01:52:05.110
thinking about those fucking days being out,
you know,

1774
01:52:05.111 --> 01:52:09.790
many times I did Coosbay Oregon I think like three or four fucking times.

1775
01:52:09.800 --> 01:52:11.680
Every time I went down there,
the goddamned seals,

1776
01:52:12.030 --> 01:52:15.010
whenever out they had this thing where you could actually see the seals sunning

1777
01:52:15.011 --> 01:52:18.190
themselves,
which was fucking amazing to me at that point because I lived on the,

1778
01:52:18.191 --> 01:52:20.830
I lived on the east coast,
you know,

1779
01:52:21.670 --> 01:52:25.420
when the fuck do you get a chance to see that,
you know,
I just cannot,

1780
01:52:25.450 --> 01:52:29.650
I cannot find this fucking thing.
I have to find you this,
this clip,

1781
01:52:29.651 --> 01:52:34.651
this person send this MP three he did a remix to a song.

1782
01:52:35.440 --> 01:52:40.360
I'm trying to kill time because I can't fucking find it.
Hey Bill.

1783
01:52:40.361 --> 01:52:44.770
Hey Bill.
Go Fuck Yourself.
Read this shit cunt.

1784
01:52:45.170 --> 01:52:49.340
This is what,
these are the emails I get from you guys.
That's not it.

1785
01:52:51.830 --> 01:52:55.400
File recommendation.
Shithead bar fight story.

1786
01:52:58.530 --> 01:53:03.330
Oh yeah.
It's a,
it's a mission.
Now
give me something else to talk about.

1787
01:53:03.540 --> 01:53:08.220
He got anything,
any questions?
This is when I,
it kills me that I,

1788
01:53:08.221 --> 01:53:09.054
that I don't,

1789
01:53:09.420 --> 01:53:13.470
I don't have any callers because this is what the fuck happened.

1790
01:53:13.471 --> 01:53:15.660
I'm quitting after two more emails I have,
you know,

1791
01:53:15.661 --> 01:53:18.450
it's something going to be worth it by the time I find it.
It's in the payoff.

1792
01:53:18.750 --> 01:53:21.840
It's not going to be worth it.
Hey,
did the Phillies win tonight?

1793
01:53:21.841 --> 01:53:26.250
Please tell me they won.
I've never given a fuck about the Phillies until now.

1794
01:53:27.270 --> 01:53:30.750
I just can't stomach the fucking Lakers and the Yankees are gonna win it this

1795
01:53:30.750 --> 01:53:31.583
year.
You know what I mean?

1796
01:53:32.380 --> 01:53:32.980
<v 9>Yeah.</v>

1797
01:53:32.980 --> 01:53:37.000
<v 7>Jesus Christ to fucking Yankees.
What a team.
Huh?
What a fucking team.</v>

1798
01:53:39.390 --> 01:53:41.410
What a fucking team.
A Rod,

1799
01:53:41.820 --> 01:53:46.410
Rodney third jade or at said that Jesus Christ,

1800
01:53:47.430 --> 01:53:52.430
Jesus Christ covers up to the plate and the Yankee son and for one year,

1801
01:53:53.970 --> 01:53:57.480
yeah,
actually,
uh,
they actually is suspended there.

1802
01:53:57.481 --> 01:54:01.470
No facial hair rule with him.
Johnny is a little upset,

1803
01:54:01.471 --> 01:54:05.790
but you know he is the son of God fucking cunt.

1804
01:54:06.150 --> 01:54:09.180
You fucking rich.
[inaudible] he called that an accomplishment.

1805
01:54:09.540 --> 01:54:12.630
You won a world series.
What?
Cause you got the most fucking money.
There is no,

1806
01:54:12.660 --> 01:54:16.110
there's no skill in that.
There's no fucking skill in that.

1807
01:54:16.111 --> 01:54:19.500
You fucking pieces of shit and they actually have,
you know what?

1808
01:54:19.501 --> 01:54:20.580
I can't stand on my Yankee fans.

1809
01:54:20.730 --> 01:54:24.360
They actually have the nerve to be nervous during the playoffs when they cut to

1810
01:54:24.361 --> 01:54:29.070
the crowd and like,
oh Geez,
I hope this hundred million guy can do it.

1811
01:54:29.250 --> 01:54:33.820
If he doesn't do it,
maybe to share her,
we'll deal with it.
You fucking cops.

1812
01:54:33.870 --> 01:54:37.500
You know I hit about the fucking Yankees.
Whoever beats them the year before,

1813
01:54:37.530 --> 01:54:39.390
whoever the best guy is,
within two years,

1814
01:54:39.391 --> 01:54:43.410
he's on the team to share a beat them last year with the fucking angels.

1815
01:54:43.470 --> 01:54:47.760
Now he's on playing first base.
I've already bitched about this shit.

1816
01:54:48.850 --> 01:54:51.750
Who gives a fuck?
Right?
It's just fucking baseball.

1817
01:54:51.751 --> 01:54:54.270
You know what I've been actually doing?
I've been watching the NHL network.

1818
01:54:55.140 --> 01:55:00.140
I actually just watched something about the 1979 Montreal Canadians winning the

1819
01:55:00.240 --> 01:55:00.241
Stanley Cup.

1820
01:55:00.241 --> 01:55:02.910
You know what the worst thing about watching the kitties win the Stanley Cup

1821
01:55:02.911 --> 01:55:06.690
back then is you knew that there was going to be some sort of heartbreaking

1822
01:55:06.691 --> 01:55:11.691
Boston Bruins lost and 79 I was too young to remember it,

1823
01:55:11.721 --> 01:55:13.290
but I just remember people bitching about it.

1824
01:55:13.560 --> 01:55:17.310
We basically beat the Canadians for games to three and then with like a minute

1825
01:55:17.311 --> 01:55:20.520
left they called too many men on the ice,

1826
01:55:21.060 --> 01:55:23.520
which is basically,
uh,

1827
01:55:24.840 --> 01:55:29.010
I'm trying to think of the fucking,
it's,
it's,
you know,

1828
01:55:29.011 --> 01:55:32.530
like in football when somebody,
a kicks,

1829
01:55:33.220 --> 01:55:37.050
somebody calls for a fair catch and you've got to give like five yards,

1830
01:55:37.051 --> 01:55:39.690
you've got to give the guy five yards so he can catch it.
And I,
you know,

1831
01:55:39.691 --> 01:55:40.860
people break it all the time.

1832
01:55:40.861 --> 01:55:44.190
They never call it if the other defensive player gets in face that that's like

1833
01:55:44.610 --> 01:55:44.611
calling,

1834
01:55:44.611 --> 01:55:48.600
making that call with one minute left to decide who goes to the Stanley Cup

1835
01:55:48.601 --> 01:55:53.601
finals and then the fucking fly French fucks ended up scoring a goal and then

1836
01:55:54.781 --> 01:55:57.360
they got the overtime goal.
It was just fucking annoying.

1837
01:55:58.050 --> 01:56:00.180
It was annoying to watch,
but they did beat the rangers.

1838
01:56:00.181 --> 01:56:04.230
So that made me feel good.
Um,
I think that's it guys.

1839
01:56:04.231 --> 01:56:05.670
I can't find this fucking thing.

1840
01:56:07.440 --> 01:56:12.160
This guy did a remix of that song,
uh,
that,
that,
that data bup,
bup,
bup,

1841
01:56:12.520 --> 01:56:16.290
banner Bailyn hat,
hat,
hat.
He did a remix of that.
Me saying count count,
count.

1842
01:56:16.620 --> 01:56:20.770
And I thought it was cute
and I just feel like for me,

1843
01:56:21.100 --> 01:56:22.390
I can't find it.
What was better?

1844
01:56:22.391 --> 01:56:27.110
The fact that just sang it for you was that decent.
All right.

1845
01:56:27.111 --> 01:56:31.100
I give up.
That's it.
Jesus Christ.
What a fucking horrific podcast.

1846
01:56:31.101 --> 01:56:34.040
But you know what?
I did get it out Monday morning.
You know what?

1847
01:56:34.041 --> 01:56:36.790
I want to thank everybody.
I've been getting a ton of emails about people.
Uh,

1848
01:56:36.960 --> 01:56:41.180
I've got a letter from a postman who just walks around listening to my podcast

1849
01:56:41.181 --> 01:56:43.730
as he delivers the mail laughing like a maniac.

1850
01:56:43.850 --> 01:56:45.020
That's what everybody keeps telling me.

1851
01:56:45.021 --> 01:56:49.190
They keep listening to them when they're supposed to be doing their job and

1852
01:56:49.191 --> 01:56:51.960
they're just sitting there laughing like a fucking maniac.
So why?

1853
01:56:51.961 --> 01:56:54.560
I know this one was a little fucked up.
The volume was messed up,

1854
01:56:54.800 --> 01:56:57.230
but that's what you get.
That's what you get.

1855
01:56:57.500 --> 01:57:00.020
Somebody sent me an email going like,
you know what?
I'm so pissed.

1856
01:57:00.021 --> 01:57:05.021
I've been listening to Opie and Anthony for awhile and I had no idea that you a

1857
01:57:05.270 --> 01:57:07.340
podcast.
What the fuck?
This is what he said.
He said,

1858
01:57:07.341 --> 01:57:11.720
I've been a fan for several years.
Uh,
duty.
Your appearances on the OPN,

1859
01:57:11.721 --> 01:57:14.900
Anthony Show,
uh,
being the lazy shitbag than I am.

1860
01:57:14.901 --> 01:57:17.120
I've never checked out your website until a week ago.

1861
01:57:17.510 --> 01:57:20.960
How has the podcast not mentioned on Opie and Anthony?
They actually,

1862
01:57:20.961 --> 01:57:25.130
they have mentioned it.
Um,
but he said a,
do they forbid that or something?
No,

1863
01:57:25.131 --> 01:57:27.980
they do not.
But he said,
I guess it's none of my business anyway,

1864
01:57:27.981 --> 01:57:30.890
but I'm pisses me off.
You've been doing it this long,
two plus years,

1865
01:57:30.891 --> 01:57:32.390
and now I'm just finding out about it.

1866
01:57:32.750 --> 01:57:35.330
I've already listened to the last three months of podcast and we'll continue

1867
01:57:35.331 --> 01:57:39.470
back until I've heard them all.
Um,
you're,

1868
01:57:39.471 --> 01:57:43.550
you're really funny guy and it's a shame this podcast is flying under the radar.

1869
01:57:44.150 --> 01:57:47.720
Well,
I say this to you.
It is not a shame that it's flying under the radar.

1870
01:57:47.720 --> 01:57:51.470
I liked that.
It is,
I don't hype it.
You find it.
You find it.
If you don't,

1871
01:57:51.710 --> 01:57:56.560
it's like fight club.
Right.
Except you don't have to be a Badass.

1872
01:57:58.120 --> 01:58:02.770
First rule about the podcast is not that you don't talk about it.
All right?

1873
01:58:02.771 --> 01:58:06.310
You know what the first rule is?
Is that you don't take the podcast seriously.

1874
01:58:07.570 --> 01:58:08.171
That's what it is.

1875
01:58:08.171 --> 01:58:12.370
Like this fucking guy tore me a new asshole about rugby because I was shitting

1876
01:58:12.371 --> 01:58:15.290
on rugby.
This fucking guy sends me this whole,

1877
01:58:15.330 --> 01:58:19.170
we are a few weeks ago you made some disparaging remarks about rugby is compared

1878
01:58:19.171 --> 01:58:24.171
to American football ever stopped to think about how we'll look illogical and

1879
01:58:24.391 --> 01:58:27.930
ludicrous.
It is to call it football when you don't use your foot.

1880
01:58:28.110 --> 01:58:31.020
He's giving me like Jerry Seinfeld Shit.
If memory serves,

1881
01:58:31.021 --> 01:58:34.650
you said something to effect that those rugby pussies would be getting,

1882
01:58:35.190 --> 01:58:38.550
wouldn't be getting up if ray Lewis put a hit on him.
You know what dude,

1883
01:58:38.551 --> 01:58:41.650
I stand by that statement but uh,
I know I already answered you email,

1884
01:58:41.651 --> 01:58:45.280
but for all you fucking lie me cuts over there and fucking England.

1885
01:58:45.580 --> 01:58:50.580
The reason why I shit on rugby was because the English country who wrote me was

1886
01:58:50.831 --> 01:58:52.870
shitting all over fucking American sports.

1887
01:58:52.871 --> 01:58:54.880
So obviously you're not going to treat me with respect.

1888
01:58:55.060 --> 01:58:59.110
I'm going to make fun of fucking rugby and your little booty short,

1889
01:58:59.830 --> 01:59:01.900
Larry Bird short shorts from the 19 fucking eighties,

1890
01:59:02.140 --> 01:59:06.240
and how every fucking 10 minutes.
You have to basically stick your head up some,

1891
01:59:06.370 --> 01:59:06.440
uh,

1892
01:59:06.440 --> 01:59:10.990
somebody else's ass as you guys tried to do that elephant trick of kicking the

1893
01:59:10.991 --> 01:59:15.970
ball out the back.
Totally respect rugby.
I think it's a fucking awesome game.

1894
01:59:15.971 --> 01:59:20.860
I've seen it on TV.
It is the shit and they have literally bone jarring lose.

1895
01:59:21.010 --> 01:59:24.550
You're filling fucking hits all the time.
I do think it's a great sport.

1896
01:59:24.730 --> 01:59:26.560
I do think people are tough,
but you know,

1897
01:59:26.561 --> 01:59:28.330
if you're going to shit on American football,

1898
01:59:28.540 --> 01:59:31.060
I'm going to shit all over your sports.
That's how it works.

1899
01:59:31.570 --> 01:59:35.080
Please do not take the podcast seriously.
I don't fucking read.

1900
01:59:35.620 --> 01:59:39.850
I do it by myself.
As you can tell what the different levels of volume this week.

1901
01:59:40.120 --> 01:59:45.100
I'm not organized.
All right,
so that's the one and only rule.
All right.

1902
01:59:45.101 --> 01:59:49.840
Don't take it seriously.
And if you can remember,
tell somebody in if not,
don't,

1903
01:59:50.230 --> 01:59:54.280
because I think the smaller this thing stays the cooler it's going to be named

1904
01:59:54.281 --> 01:59:59.110
one fucking thing that is blown up and stayed at the same level of quality.

1905
01:59:59.260 --> 02:00:04.180
It doesn't,
it doesn't,
you know,
you want,
I want it to be like this.

1906
02:00:04.181 --> 02:00:08.140
I want to fucking,
I'm gonna be down in the Fox hole.
You know,

1907
02:00:09.200 --> 02:00:12.580
if I,
if I had this thing actually ever fucking blew up and I'm,
I'm,

1908
02:00:12.620 --> 02:00:16.660
I'm doing rants about saying unacceptable than these fucking other cons,

1909
02:00:17.110 --> 02:00:19.540
we'll figure out that.
That's what we're saying.
We're saying unacceptable.

1910
02:00:20.660 --> 02:00:22.060
Then the whole game plan is over,

1911
02:00:22.150 --> 02:00:25.990
and then what I'm doing here is fucking useless.
Right.

1912
02:00:26.920 --> 02:00:27.370
Wow.

1913
02:00:27.370 --> 02:00:31.360
Did I just go off in a fantasy there where this thing became the biggest fucking

1914
02:00:31.361 --> 02:00:34.420
radio show ever?
I think I just did.
You know,

1915
02:00:34.450 --> 02:00:36.400
that's what happens when you sit here by yourself.

1916
02:00:36.630 --> 02:00:40.390
You'll let your dreams leak out and then people make funny you and then you feel

1917
02:00:40.391 --> 02:00:43.300
silly.
Um,
all right.
That's the podcast for this week.

1918
02:00:43.301 --> 02:00:46.540
That was a fucking mess.
All right.

1919
02:00:47.800 --> 02:00:49.690
It was a fucking mess.
I'm gonna,
you know,

1920
02:00:49.720 --> 02:00:52.240
I think it kinda got back on the rails afterwards,

1921
02:00:52.450 --> 02:00:53.520
but it was a message you guys ever,

1922
02:00:53.610 --> 02:00:56.560
we were on ESPN first came out and they used to sell those fucking rednecks.

1923
02:00:56.950 --> 02:01:01.210
They'd race in the murdered member that they turn their tractors into these,
uh,

1924
02:01:01.930 --> 02:01:03.390
I don't know what the fuck they were,
but they would,

1925
02:01:03.391 --> 02:01:06.220
they would race through the Mug,
did get bogged down.
That's what the fuck it was.

1926
02:01:06.221 --> 02:01:09.520
I was at redneck sitting in that tractor in the mud.

1927
02:01:09.550 --> 02:01:12.770
I like how I had to explain that it's sucked.
Like he didn't fucking notice.
Um,

1928
02:01:12.850 --> 02:01:17.140
that's it.
All you guys have a great fucking week.
And,

1929
02:01:18.460 --> 02:01:21.910
um,
that's it.
That's the podcast for this week.
And I've,
uh,

1930
02:01:22.540 --> 02:01:26.110
talked myself into a corner once again because I usually end with have a great

1931
02:01:26.111 --> 02:01:28.570
week.
That's what I usually say.

1932
02:01:28.571 --> 02:01:32.590
And then I continued talking and now here I am down in the fucking murder again.

1933
02:01:33.850 --> 02:01:36.880
Um,
hey,
has anybody seen that come?
I'm just gonna keep talking.

1934
02:01:36.881 --> 02:01:39.350
If you guys seen that commercial where they got the fucking,
uh,

1935
02:01:40.220 --> 02:01:42.590
they're trying to help you out of that financial,
you know,

1936
02:01:42.591 --> 02:01:47.000
all these people in financial difficulties.
Um,
AH,
fuck.

1937
02:01:47.001 --> 02:01:49.460
That's what I was going to talk about.
God dammit.

1938
02:01:51.130 --> 02:01:54.040
No one's listening at this point.
I'm gonna,
I'm gonna waste this story.

1939
02:01:54.280 --> 02:01:55.750
I went to the supermarket.
Okay.

1940
02:01:56.350 --> 02:01:59.570
And I don't use those little savy saved cards that they have Yammer,

1941
02:01:59.650 --> 02:02:04.120
a little SAIDI saved card.
And I always say,
no,
would you like one?
No,
I wouldn't,

1942
02:02:05.480 --> 02:02:08.450
you know,
because basically what you're doing is a free fucking survey.

1943
02:02:08.451 --> 02:02:10.580
Remember that shit so they can figure out what you can't live without.

1944
02:02:10.581 --> 02:02:14.100
So they can jack up the price of that food and then give you like Dan Nicola

1945
02:02:14.180 --> 02:02:18.230
like,
uh,
their version of corn flakes.
So I went in there,
okay.

1946
02:02:18.231 --> 02:02:20.990
And they asked me if I had to sit in their little safe card and I said no.

1947
02:02:21.080 --> 02:02:23.630
And he said,
do you want one?
I said,
no.
And The lady goes,
it's okay.

1948
02:02:23.631 --> 02:02:25.130
I'll just punch in a code anyways.

1949
02:02:25.280 --> 02:02:28.340
So she punches in a code and I get money off anyways.

1950
02:02:28.580 --> 02:02:33.580
So it's like they even figured out a way to figure out what I'm fucking buying,

1951
02:02:34.130 --> 02:02:37.100
even when I'm saying go fuck yourself to the save thing.

1952
02:02:38.060 --> 02:02:40.100
So I think the only way to get around it at this point,

1953
02:02:40.250 --> 02:02:42.470
I'm going to try it next time is I'm going to walk in with cash.

1954
02:02:42.471 --> 02:02:46.670
And just have cash and see what the fuck they do.
You know,

1955
02:02:46.940 --> 02:02:48.350
they did it to me today at Macy's.

1956
02:02:48.351 --> 02:02:52.250
I went out there and I bought some towels and I bought some beer glasses.

1957
02:02:52.760 --> 02:02:57.110
That's what I bought Macy's.
And they say,
do you ever,
do you have a Macy's card?

1958
02:02:57.290 --> 02:03:01.610
I said,
no,
I don't.
It will give you 25% off every douchey thing you bought.

1959
02:03:01.790 --> 02:03:04.400
I said,
that's okay.
And she goes,
it's all right.

1960
02:03:04.580 --> 02:03:07.580
I'll give you the discount anyways.
And she types in this fucking code.

1961
02:03:09.260 --> 02:03:12.710
I don't know what they're up to.
I really don't know what they're up to,

1962
02:03:12.711 --> 02:03:15.200
but I know they don't sit around trying to make less money.

1963
02:03:15.440 --> 02:03:17.420
Does anybody know what the fuck that's about?

1964
02:03:17.421 --> 02:03:20.120
That is your homework for this week.
If you still listened,

1965
02:03:20.360 --> 02:03:21.830
if you listened this far,

1966
02:03:22.070 --> 02:03:26.180
you fucking hate your job and you need to get a new one.
All right?

1967
02:03:26.720 --> 02:03:30.410
Don't hurt anybody at work.
All right,
that's it.
Now I'm done.

1968
02:03:30.560 --> 02:03:32.290
Everybody have a good week.
I'll talk to you next.
