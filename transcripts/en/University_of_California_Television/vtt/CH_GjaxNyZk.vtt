- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape:
bipedal, naked, large brained. Long the

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:39.280
master of fire, tools, and language, but
still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:48.630
Aware that death is inevitable, yet filled
with optimism. We grow up slowly. We hand

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:56.140
down knowledge. We empathize and deceive.
We shape the future from our shared

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:03.530
understanding of the past. CARTA brings
together experts from diverse disciplines

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:11.340
to exchange insights on who we are and how
we got here; an exploration made possible

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.146
by the generosity of humans like you.

- [Richard] Thank you, Pascal, and thank
you to Ajit, as well, for running CARTA,

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.170
which is, really, a fantastic
organization, as you guys all know because

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:18.680
you're here in the room. It was a pleasure
to organize this meeting with Anne Stone

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:26.110
and it feels a bit like an amazing reunion
of all the folks who are really on the

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.650
front lines and doing some of the most
amazing things in the field of ancient DNA

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:38.140
in human evolution. So these CARTA
meetings, they have an extremely high

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:44.210
production quality, and they're really a
pleasure to be involved in and I want to

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:49.430
thank the organizers for all of the hard
work that they do in making this possible

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:56.350
for me and for Anne and for the speakers
here. So I will say a few words, also,

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:02.940
about CARTA and the big picture questions,
the kind of deepest questions, that one

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:10.310
can imagine. The how did we get here?
Where are we from? The interesting thing

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.720
and the great thing about CARTA, I think,
is that these are big questions, hard

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:21.630
questions, but the progress, the answers
come in very small details and one very

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:28.180
kind of small step at a time. So, for
example, where did I come from? I came

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:33.210
from Santa Cruz and I got here on a
Southwest Airlines flight. You probably

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:41.610
all have a similar story, but what we're
going to hear today are five excellent

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:48.650
talks that are very, very technical in
nature that push the envelope a little

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:54.430
bit. Answer, in some small way, very
important questions about who we are and

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:03.950
how we got here. So the first five talks
will be first from Sriram Sankararaman,

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:09.060
and I hope that I...I practiced a little
bit before I got up here. I hope that is

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:15.670
not so terrible. Sriram will tell us a
little bit about the legacy of ancestry

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.720
that we from Neandertals and Denisovans,
and kind of where this is in our genomes

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:28.220
of people who are alive today. Next we'll
have Tina Warner from Oklahoma, who will

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.540
tell us about the kind of amazing
discoveries one can make from getting DNA

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:38.960
out of dental calculus, the things
that...little bit of material that's on

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:44.660
the tooth and records a history of things
that lived in your mouth over people that

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:49.240
lived a long time ago. And then a former
colleague, Matthias Meyer, from the Max

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:56.490
Planck Institute in Leipzig will come and
tell us about perhaps the most technically

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:01.960
challenging project out there now, getting
DNA from extremely old, extremely

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:11.370
degraded, and extremely important hominem
samples from the old world. Next, my other

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:16.790
former colleague, Kay Prüfer, also from
Max Planck Institute will talk to us about

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:21.750
the Neandertal and the Denisovan genomes
that have been sequenced in that group

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:28.950
there. These are extremely well-sequenced
genomes that are we know in more exacting

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:32.920
detail than many of the genomes that we
have for humans who live today, despite

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:37.850
the fact that this material is tens of
thousands of years old. And then, finally,

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:43.380
we'll have Brenna Hen from currently at
Stony Brook University who will tell us

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:48.720
about her work investigating the origins
of modern humans, which we know

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:55.300
geographically happened someplace in
Africa but it is very difficult to pin

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.410
down kind of exactly when and where that
was, and she's working on that very hard

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:04.600
problem. Okay, so with that, I would like
to ask the first speaker, Sriram, to come

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.477
up and we'll get started.
