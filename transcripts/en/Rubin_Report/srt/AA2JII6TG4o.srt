1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,400
[inaudible]

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:08,440
do you think lawsuits are the
answer to stop some of this stuff?

3
00:00:08,441 --> 00:00:13,441
I'm also realizing right now that would
our runway to fix this is becoming

4
00:00:13,661 --> 00:00:17,140
perilously short. Like we're getting
to the best pretty damn quick.

5
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:21,040
The 2020 election is right around the
corner and that seems to me to be what

6
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:22,330
this is all ramping up to.

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,770
Absolutely. The Covington case was
such a glaring example of that.

8
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,020
So I was on vacation
in Mexico. Yeah. Okay,

9
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:29,880
so let's just go all in on
Covington right now. Yeah,

10
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,610
so it was a little town north of port
of are out there just hanging out too.

11
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,480
You know, going through
Twitter and [inaudible] son
of a bitch, try on Twitter,

12
00:00:36,481 --> 00:00:41,160
on vacations. We'll see what happens.
And so I see Maggie Haberman,

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,170
the premiere reporter for the premiere
news publication in the country covering

14
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:48,270
American politics. New
York Times. Yeah, exactly.

15
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:54,080
Basically calling for the expulsion of a
bunch of kids that she's never met that

16
00:00:54,391 --> 00:00:58,920
she doesn't know based on an event she
didn't see. And I found that so shocking.

17
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:02,310
I was like, we're crossing a whole
new line now. If we're going to go,

18
00:01:02,311 --> 00:01:04,380
it's one thing to go after what
somebody said 10 years ago.

19
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,400
That's problematic on its own terms.
We'll get,

20
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:07,830
we'll get to that in a little bit too.

21
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,990
That's what we have
statutes of limitations for,

22
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,990
but the a is that you're not going to be
held responsible for what she did when

23
00:01:12,991 --> 00:01:16,950
you're 10, but the or when you're
20, when you're 40. But the here,

24
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:21,120
these kids were who were just going up
to DC to be part of the pro life march.

25
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:25,680
Uh, and usually the pro life march at five
at family participate in that. They're,

26
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:27,750
they're just having fun.
You know, they're not mean.

27
00:01:27,751 --> 00:01:29,160
They're not out there harassing people.

28
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,640
They're just expressing what they
believe. A, these kids are having fun.

29
00:01:32,641 --> 00:01:36,270
Probably the first time ever to Washington
DC there by the Lincoln memorial was

30
00:01:36,271 --> 00:01:39,570
beautiful memorial and all of a sudden
they start getting harassed out of the

31
00:01:39,571 --> 00:01:43,290
blue and they have likely never met
the black Hebrew Israelites. Right?

32
00:01:43,291 --> 00:01:45,450
Some of us that have
no what's coming every,

33
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:49,350
I lived in New York City for many
years. Every by these guys, many times,

34
00:01:49,351 --> 00:01:52,290
every insult, known demand.
It's like really? They're
almost like an insult comic.

35
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,890
If the routine is so extreme, it's like
they find something going the next,

36
00:01:55,891 --> 00:01:58,920
then the next thing the next day,
like bad don Rickles. Oh, exactly.

37
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:02,240
Exactly the worst version, right? It's
all you combined Farah Khan with Don Rowe.

38
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,620
Yeah. Right. So,

39
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:07,410
but these kids have no ideas and they
have an African American friend that's

40
00:02:07,411 --> 00:02:11,400
there with them and the he's being
attacked and so they start defending him.

41
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:15,390
They started attacking, making various
anti gay slurs there. They question,

42
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:18,930
they respond back to that in defense
of people who are gay. So I was like,

43
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:20,250
these are in that mean kids.

44
00:02:20,251 --> 00:02:22,200
These are kids trying to handle
the shocking environment.

45
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:26,280
They decided to go internal and start,
okay, let's not deal with these guys.

46
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:30,390
Let's do our school tiers. One of their
school cheers as the old Haiku, as a,

47
00:02:30,391 --> 00:02:34,560
as the Haiku dance, which is the Great New
Zealand rugby team. All black. Yeah. I,

48
00:02:34,561 --> 00:02:36,990
in fact two weeks before it's shown
it to my son because I was like,

49
00:02:36,991 --> 00:02:39,600
look at how awesome. It's awesome.
It's all over youtube by the way.

50
00:02:39,601 --> 00:02:41,040
Anyone can watch it.
And absolutely.

51
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:43,080
When I first saw it in
the movie with Matt Damon,

52
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:47,010
that's the greatest sports
dance I've ever seen. In fact,

53
00:02:47,011 --> 00:02:49,590
before I want to get inspired
by something, I'll just
put it on and go get ready.

54
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,050
Yeah. So the, so they
do that as part of it.

55
00:02:52,051 --> 00:02:54,360
That's why when the kid's tearing his
clothes off and it's right after that,

56
00:02:54,361 --> 00:02:55,194
it's happening,

57
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:57,730
then all of a sudden the native American
comes up with some friends and he's

58
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,610
doing the drums. So two
thirds of the kids think, oh,

59
00:03:00,611 --> 00:03:03,310
he's joining in because we just did
the Iq thing. Oh, this is great.

60
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,760
And what do they know?
The most popular, uh,

61
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:10,270
native American sports thing they know
is the, is the Tomahawk Chop from, uh,

62
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:14,530
from the Florida, stayed from Kansas
City chiefs and Indian Atlanta Braves.

63
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,320
All the places where they're familiar.
And there, it's right on the,

64
00:03:17,321 --> 00:03:19,630
on the border of the Kentucky,
Ohio border.

65
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:22,750
So the kind of programs they'd be
familiar with, that's what they see.

66
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:25,750
Not Nobody's mocking him. Nobody's
chanting, build the wall out of.

67
00:03:25,751 --> 00:03:27,790
Nobody's blocking him.
Nobody's surrounding him.

68
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:30,430
And then at one point they started, some
of the kids start to figure out, okay,

69
00:03:30,431 --> 00:03:33,190
something's odd. Because some of
the people behind him are saying,

70
00:03:33,191 --> 00:03:36,640
go back to Europe. And it's like,
where did that come from? Uh,

71
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:38,890
and then they realize something's weird.
Then they just leave.

72
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,900
And then as they're on their bus home,

73
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:44,680
all of a sudden their lives are being
upended and they're not being up ended by

74
00:03:44,681 --> 00:03:48,550
just some random bot accounts who started
their being offended by Kathy Griffin

75
00:03:48,551 --> 00:03:50,020
who's calling for them to be doxed.

76
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,080
They're offended by Maggie Haberman
calling for them to be expelled.

77
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:57,070
They're upended by Matthew Dowd, who's
on ABC, who was, it was a prominent,

78
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:00,700
a Catholic on ABC saying that
things need to happen to these kids.

79
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:03,460
And in Navarro, who is saying bad
things need to happen to these kids,

80
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:04,890
almost the entire media is,

81
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,900
and then you have Hollywood celebrities
calling for them to be put through the

82
00:04:07,901 --> 00:04:10,920
shredder for them to be attacked
for them to be. You had uh, uh,

83
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:14,520
a writer who claimed to be
part of Saturday night at
nine live say she's going

84
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:17,560
to extend sexual favors for anybody
who physically assaulted these people.

85
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,210
And I was like,
these are probably the kids.

86
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,340
These are, by the way, these are
blue checked verified people,

87
00:04:22,341 --> 00:04:23,174
these are all of them.

88
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:26,230
Generally the people that Twitter says
you should pay attention to that we've

89
00:04:26,231 --> 00:04:29,970
verified that. We validated that we've
authenticated that we've authorized.

90
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:34,560
And uh, it, Twitter and social media
does almost nothing about this. In fact,

91
00:04:34,561 --> 00:04:38,490
they run with the fake news story and
these kids lives are almost over in five

92
00:04:38,491 --> 00:04:43,440
seconds based on a misleading
video. Um, and so I saw it and I,

93
00:04:43,441 --> 00:04:45,900
uh, when I first saw the video I was like,
oh, that's going to be fake news story.

94
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:49,170
Just cause you know, DC politics, you
know, you know lefty protest culture,

95
00:04:49,171 --> 00:04:53,370
you know the chances that a bunch of
Catholic kids came up and found a lefty to

96
00:04:53,371 --> 00:04:58,170
harass isn't that real high and Washington
DC say that happened in a small town

97
00:04:58,171 --> 00:05:02,790
in Alabama. Okay, maybe uh, but there's
like this story doesn't make sense.

98
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,280
And so I was like, okay,
that will probably blow over.

99
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:07,830
And that was well getting on
a plane to go to boost areas.

100
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:10,020
Then I get to the booze and
see these things and I'm like,

101
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,550
they're going to destroy
these kids' lives.

102
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,860
And I realize if they
think if they can do this,

103
00:05:13,861 --> 00:05:16,110
they can do anything to anyone at anytime,
anywhere.

104
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:17,070
And that's exactly.

105
00:05:17,071 --> 00:05:20,580
So then you started tweeting about it
alongside a couple of other people and I

106
00:05:20,581 --> 00:05:23,550
thought a couple of other people in the
legal world and I thought, all right,

107
00:05:23,551 --> 00:05:27,270
I've got to talk to this guy because
if this one doesn't get corrected,

108
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,720
which fortunately thanks to you and it's
ongoing, you and several other people,

109
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:34,050
it is getting corrected. But I thought
if this one doesn't get corrected,

110
00:05:34,051 --> 00:05:39,000
if we let them demolish high
school students, we're done.

111
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:43,170
We are done. So can you catch us up on
sort of where, where this is all at now?

112
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:46,050
So when I did initially is I first just
put out a tweet and said if anybody

113
00:05:46,051 --> 00:05:50,010
wants to sue Maggie Haberman now represent
it for free. And I was just agitated,

114
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,033
just ticked off.

115
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:54,990
And I didn't tune into Twitter until
like two days later when I came back and

116
00:05:54,991 --> 00:05:58,010
all of a sudden it blown up and I'm
getting all these and I'm like, okay.

117
00:05:58,011 --> 00:05:59,990
I realized that this was
becoming very high profile.

118
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:04,460
And so I go on Fox and my goal is to
get everybody to start to re retract,

119
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:07,730
start to back up, start to
retail, the different story.

120
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:11,720
And unfortunately almost
all the institutional media
starts to backtrack fast.

121
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,180
So to be clear,
you did not want to go the legal route.

122
00:06:14,181 --> 00:06:16,490
Actually you are giving
everybody, man, I saw you do this.

123
00:06:16,491 --> 00:06:19,220
You gave them the chance guys,
just delete the tweets.

124
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:22,680
Did you even ask them to issue apologies.
I don't even remember that I said was,

125
00:06:22,681 --> 00:06:25,250
I said that everybody got 48
hours to do one of three things,

126
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,880
either correct or delete or apologize,

127
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:32,900
just do something to correct the record
and let me to her credit congress woman

128
00:06:32,901 --> 00:06:36,410
Omar, who usually has no problem saying
anything under God's green earth. Uh,

129
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,760
she did,
she did it within an hour,

130
00:06:37,761 --> 00:06:40,010
but she only did it because
roll call covered my story.

131
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:43,610
So his role called covered my stories.
Like, Oh, maybe I can get sued. AndW ,

132
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,110
you know, took it down. By the way,

133
00:06:45,111 --> 00:06:48,440
right before that she had sent out a tweet
linking them to white supremacist and

134
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:50,480
a whole bunch of others. Yeah, a
whole bunch of false information.

135
00:06:50,481 --> 00:06:52,280
She labeled them in a whole new,
unique ways.

136
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:54,820
They'll leave it to her to figure
out a way to do that. The, uh,

137
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,950
this is a member of Congress,
by the way.

138
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:59,990
Then you have Senator Warren is running
for the presidency of the United States

139
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:01,800
repeating false statements
about these kids.

140
00:07:01,801 --> 00:07:04,220
Well that's because she's native
Americans. Yeah. Yes, yes, exactly.

141
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:06,500
She has to stand up for her.
Trump the level,

142
00:07:06,501 --> 00:07:08,690
like they portrayed him as a
native American elder. Well,

143
00:07:08,691 --> 00:07:11,390
I clerked for native American tribes. I
worked for one of these old school lefty,

144
00:07:11,391 --> 00:07:14,360
one of the best trial lawyers in the
country. And I was like, hey. I was like,

145
00:07:14,361 --> 00:07:16,280
I don't think he's an elder
of that particular tribe.

146
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:19,520
Then I realized they were just confusing
the terms because he's elderly.

147
00:07:19,521 --> 00:07:21,380
They were going to call him an elder.
I was like,

148
00:07:21,381 --> 00:07:25,130
that's an insult to all the most native
American elders are very carefully

149
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:28,790
selected. They take their job very
seriously. In fact, their court system,

150
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:31,070
if we had an ideal court
system in the world,

151
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,660
it would be the native
American elder system.

152
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,490
I'd be all for it because there's 12,

153
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:37,460
12 people sit around and you come and
you tell him your dispute and they try to

154
00:07:37,461 --> 00:07:41,060
find a remedy that will satisfy everybody
and they try not to be too punitive.

155
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:45,260
They try not to be too, uh, too
involved. They just try to say, okay,

156
00:07:45,261 --> 00:07:48,470
what's caused this problem?
How can we address the cause of it?

157
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:50,540
And they're focused on reconciliation.

158
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:53,840
How can we bring people together so it
doesn't happen again and people don't

159
00:07:53,841 --> 00:07:56,390
feel bad at the end of it.
Not Great for your profession,

160
00:07:56,391 --> 00:08:00,050
but exactly a much better system.
I'd be all for it. I mean I'm happy,

161
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:03,500
happily forfeit my law degree
to see that system put in place,

162
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:07,280
have the 12 members of your community
get to decide these kinds of disputes and

163
00:08:07,281 --> 00:08:10,610
find ways to put people back together
and protect all the things that matter to

164
00:08:10,611 --> 00:08:13,400
us rather than deepening the division
and the bitterness that exists.

165
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,290
And the legal system often creates that.

166
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:20,060
People often leave it even when they
win unsatisfied. And so the uh, so,

167
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:22,560
but so they put this guy in that context,
there's like,

168
00:08:22,561 --> 00:08:25,850
it wasn't a Vietnam war veteran.
The was really not really being accurate.

169
00:08:25,851 --> 00:08:27,980
They're trying to script a narrative,
trying to tell the story,

170
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:32,810
but doing it to these kids and include
the message was if we can destroy them,

171
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,740
we can destroy you.

172
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:38,870
It was an ultimate exemplar mechanism
of media narrative structure and that's

173
00:08:38,871 --> 00:08:43,160
why I volunteer to help them out. And so
now represent 14 families in Covington.

174
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:47,930
Oh about 90% of the people I went
on Fox and said 48 hours notice,

175
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,140
just clean it up and we'll be done.
And even after that,

176
00:08:51,141 --> 00:08:53,600
and giving people additional opportunities
and additional opportunities,

177
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:57,390
please take it down, please. That none
of the family members want to sue.

178
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:59,880
They don't want to deal with the
nightmares of the legal system.

179
00:08:59,881 --> 00:09:02,550
They don't have to go through
all that hassle hurdle. Um,

180
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:05,670
but they want the record corrected and
they don't want to happen to anyone else.

181
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,610
That's it. And so I was like, let's
set a record. Let's set a pattern.

182
00:09:08,611 --> 00:09:11,540
Let's set a precedent year that
this can get corrected and remedied,

183
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:13,380
that he can't do this to these kids.

184
00:09:13,381 --> 00:09:15,930
You can't do this to these people
that you do have standards.

185
00:09:15,931 --> 00:09:17,370
You have to be bound by those standards.

186
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,990
You have to be governed
by those standards,

187
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:20,550
and you have to act
according to those standards.

188
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:24,270
For those that refuse to do anything
about it, they're going to be sued.

189
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:27,490
Yeah. Because so some of them still
left the tweets up or did an apology.

190
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:31,860
Kathy Griffin. Matthew Dowd,
oddly enough, Maggie Haberman, uh,

191
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:34,670
Senator Warren, uh,
congresswoman Holland. Uh,

192
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:38,400
those are the five highest profile
examples of people who refuse to correct.

193
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:42,130
When you see a mob descent,
it's a little,

194
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,570
it's a little hard to figure
out how coordinated it is,
whether it's group think,

195
00:09:46,571 --> 00:09:49,450
is this coming from the top?
Is this organic?

196
00:09:49,451 --> 00:09:51,400
As much as you've had to
deal with these things.

197
00:09:51,401 --> 00:09:54,550
And especially since you dealt with the
most recent one that's still unfolding

198
00:09:54,551 --> 00:09:58,090
right now, what's your take? Is it,
is it a little bit of everything?

199
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,910
It's two different things.
One is there,

200
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:02,650
they've started to greenlight mob culture.

201
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:06,260
That's what it was scary here because
this started out with a bot account who

202
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:09,610
was spreading it through sort of liberal
ideological culture who is trying to

203
00:10:09,611 --> 00:10:10,600
create an online model.

204
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:14,140
But the reality is that online mob
would have never reached critical mass,

205
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:17,590
at least as it related to these kids
without the blue check mark crowd saying,

206
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:20,200
Yay, Yay, Yay. And
that's the problem there.

207
00:10:20,201 --> 00:10:24,850
The green light for online mob behavior
and that's why they have to be stopped

208
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:28,510
and they have to correct their actions
or they have to be remedied in court

209
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:33,220
because they are the ones
that are permitting it and
expanding it. And for them,

210
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:36,460
I don't know how often it's deliberate
and how often to cultural mindset,

211
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,230
I used to call it cotton ball culture.

212
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,650
So in the south people used
to go to the cotton ball.

213
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:44,470
They're part of the privileged classes
when they're 16 and 17 and they're sort

214
00:10:44,471 --> 00:10:48,130
of incorporated and acculturated
to a certain mindset.

215
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,710
So it's not that they all
get together and conspire,

216
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:53,450
but that they have a certain
point of view that's,

217
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,720
that's been created by
the culture they share.

218
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:00,550
And I think there's some of them online
mob culture that's been festering over

219
00:11:00,551 --> 00:11:03,130
the past half decade,
decade.

220
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:07,660
And the worst part of it is that continued
to be green light by institutional

221
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,270
people or people with big
platforms and big power.

222
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:15,220
Are you shocked also how the racial
element has become so blatant?

223
00:11:15,221 --> 00:11:19,060
So it was like these kids are white.
So you know,

224
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:24,090
they have punchable faces or excusing
the black Israelites to quizzes because

225
00:11:24,731 --> 00:11:27,670
they're black. So they can call
these kids faggots. And that's okay.

226
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,800
Even though you're supposed
to defend gay people.

227
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,030
But I guess if it's black people,
you know,

228
00:11:31,031 --> 00:11:32,940
they created this oppression
Olympics intersectional too. Yeah.

229
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:36,400
This intersectional lunacy.
So are you just shocked how,

230
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:39,640
how solidified that is in
so many people's brains

231
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,280
coordinator for like two
different reasons. One,

232
00:11:41,281 --> 00:11:44,880
whenever I see people do it or raise it,
my instinctual view is I was like, well,

233
00:11:44,881 --> 00:11:46,620
what does that person actually
done for civil rights?

234
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:48,600
So like when I'd been
attacked, I'm like, well,

235
00:11:48,601 --> 00:11:50,220
I've done civil rights for 20 years.

236
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:54,760
I've done very difficult cases in very
difficult advocating for civil rights.

237
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:59,050
So I was like, is this person really
out there trying to help protect people?

238
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,510
Or is it somebody who wants to,
uh,

239
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:04,900
social brownie points and social prestige
point for being on the right political

240
00:12:04,901 --> 00:12:07,660
side? Um, and that's 95% of them.

241
00:12:07,661 --> 00:12:11,050
These are people that aren't actually
doing anything to improve the wellbeing of

242
00:12:11,051 --> 00:12:12,820
African Americans.
And Latinos in this country.

243
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:18,120
The second part of it is it's
become social prestige to uh,

244
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:22,570
out people that are on that ever
particular disfavored political class.

245
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:26,650
And it happens to be the right now are
disfavored political classes are by

246
00:12:26,651 --> 00:12:30,490
people are men are people of certain
sort of parts of the country,

247
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,570
certain political arena.

248
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:33,140
Dacian kids wearing Maga hats.

249
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:36,110
Exactly. I was like, that's
the same sort of bigotry.

250
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:40,130
The bigotry doesn't know color bigotry
is bigotry and this has just racial

251
00:12:40,131 --> 00:12:44,030
bigotry disguised as a,
as tried to protect people.

252
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,290
They're not out to protect people.

253
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:48,710
They're out to hurt and harm people and
they just want to feel morally justified

254
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:49,693
when they do it.

255
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:54,700
So when you now have to have to move
forward on this lawsuit that you're saying

256
00:12:54,701 --> 00:12:56,680
you're going into not
really cause you want to,

257
00:12:56,681 --> 00:12:58,090
you're giving these
people a chance to go out.

258
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:02,080
How does this even work logistically
when you're going after people that have

259
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:04,870
nothing to do with each other other than
they all did it on the same platform.

260
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,780
So we're going to bring
it as a class claim.

261
00:13:06,781 --> 00:13:08,510
So all the plaintiffs will be combined.

262
00:13:08,511 --> 00:13:13,511
So all 14 kids will be one group of
plaintiffs and all the defendants will be

263
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:15,230
combined.
So the uh,

264
00:13:15,231 --> 00:13:18,710
so you can combine the defendants
together when there's a common nucleus of

265
00:13:18,711 --> 00:13:21,320
facts and there are behaving
in a coordinated way,

266
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,010
even if it doesn't rise to the level of,
say,

267
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:25,520
illegal conspiracy or aiding and abetting,

268
00:13:25,521 --> 00:13:27,170
which it may in some of these instances,

269
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,400
the effect of it is you can add them
together because for judicial economy

270
00:13:31,401 --> 00:13:33,500
purposes,
they're all part of the same event.

271
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:37,100
And it's easier for one judge to preside
over all the cases combined then the

272
00:13:37,101 --> 00:13:39,620
cases differently. Uh,
and so it's interesting,

273
00:13:39,621 --> 00:13:44,300
some of the left media's client use use
of these kinds of defamation claims has

274
00:13:44,301 --> 00:13:47,870
done used this exact procedure and it's
time to use the exact procedure back the

275
00:13:47,871 --> 00:13:48,580
other way.

276
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:50,800
You gotta be careful what you wish for.
Exactly.

277
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:54,390
So let's talk a little bit about what's
going on with Tucker Carlson right now.

278
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:57,550
Now Tucker has been on this show,
I go on his show every couple of weeks.

279
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:59,140
I find them to be a decent guy.

280
00:13:59,141 --> 00:14:03,280
We have political disagreements that we
have expressed to each other publicly

281
00:14:03,281 --> 00:14:05,560
before,
but I think he's on the right side,

282
00:14:05,561 --> 00:14:09,190
especially when it comes to the free
speech stuff now. Now media matters,

283
00:14:09,191 --> 00:14:11,230
which you mentioned already there,
they're going after him.

284
00:14:11,231 --> 00:14:15,970
They're finding old audio clips on a
shock. Jock, a Bubba, what's his name?

285
00:14:15,971 --> 00:14:18,760
Bubba. Bubba Gump, Blah
Blah. So then Bubba,

286
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:21,630
is there any, I know it's got bubble
and the bubble, that's something, right?

287
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:26,140
Yeah. Yeah. Whatever it is in
effect a Howard Stern, like figure.

288
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,680
Exactly where I was thinking.

289
00:14:27,681 --> 00:14:30,890
I tweeted something the other day that
I wish Howard stern was maybe a little

290
00:14:30,891 --> 00:14:33,320
more engaged in these days.
Ndas, I don't begrudge him. He's,

291
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:34,670
he's lived through a lot and he's had,

292
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,460
he's been a great fighter on our
side of the free speech thing,

293
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:42,530
but it's like if he was to take the 30
years of stuff that politicians, actors,

294
00:14:42,531 --> 00:14:44,720
Comedians, authors, musicians,

295
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:49,070
everybody has said the crazy sexual
acts that had been done in that.

296
00:14:49,071 --> 00:14:53,510
So you all those things and said
you what this is all part of life,

297
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:58,040
right? All say things we get
in atmospheres. Where you
joke differently this way,

298
00:14:58,041 --> 00:15:00,710
then you would that way.
All of these things,

299
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:04,940
I would love to help have him
aiding us right now in this fight.

300
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,550
So that's just one piece of this.
But putting that aside,

301
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:12,920
media matters is now digging into old
things of, of talkers. And you know,

302
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:14,500
he apparently he said Faggot.

303
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:16,820
There were a couple of other things and
they're trying to make it sound like

304
00:15:16,821 --> 00:15:21,821
he's racist and he's for abusing kids
and all of these things and I wonder what

305
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:25,640
his legal recourses now
he's not apologizing.

306
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,340
That's one thing which I think
that's pretty good for the,

307
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:31,360
if you're going to stand against the
mob, don't apologize. But also if there,

308
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:34,370
because their goal is
just to destroy this man,

309
00:15:34,371 --> 00:15:36,920
their goal is in some sort
of legal justice, right?

310
00:15:36,921 --> 00:15:40,130
Their goal is their goal isn't
to help anyone. Exactly. Right.

311
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,590
Unless they're doing something
that I can't figure out.

312
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:45,500
Their goal is to destroy a man.
And if you could destroy a man,

313
00:15:45,501 --> 00:15:48,860
you can destroy an idea and you can get
all sorts of other people to shut up.

314
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,500
So what the hell do we do?

315
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:56,690
It's very much a censorship shaming
campaign designed to marginalize his

316
00:15:56,691 --> 00:16:00,140
audience and marginalize him from having
access to his audience and to be an

317
00:16:00,141 --> 00:16:02,450
example to future people
so that they won't, Hey,

318
00:16:02,451 --> 00:16:04,100
you better not come after a big tech,

319
00:16:04,101 --> 00:16:07,640
which is really what distinguishes Tucker
from anyone else on Fox or anyone else

320
00:16:07,641 --> 00:16:09,380
in the political conservative space.

321
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:14,060
He's probably the lead high profile
person taking on big tech in this country.

322
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,500
One of the leading guys saying,

323
00:16:15,501 --> 00:16:18,430
I think you're telling me I should have
you on retainer. Is that where exactly?

324
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:22,130
That's what's happening. It's a
systematic, it's institutional. It's in,

325
00:16:22,131 --> 00:16:23,450
it's deliberate and it's obvious.

326
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:27,080
So like I first got it familiar with
this aspect of it in the context of

327
00:16:27,081 --> 00:16:28,190
representing Alex Jones,

328
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:32,030
because I was trying to figure out why
do people think he said a bunch of stuff

329
00:16:32,031 --> 00:16:35,120
that he actually didn't say or did things
that he actually didn't do or think

330
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,580
90% of what he said was
this as opposed to that.

331
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,820
And it had found out watching Joe Rogan
that it was actually a media matters

332
00:16:40,821 --> 00:16:42,620
thing that Joe Rogan himself
walked. He's like, oh no,

333
00:16:42,621 --> 00:16:45,590
I saw this media matters thing was
like who would trust media matters.

334
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:49,100
It's like they, they're politically
motivated, they're partisan oriented.

335
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:52,760
They take various forms of like people
complain about secret corporate cash and

336
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:55,940
dark money. Media matters has tons
of secret corporate cash and dark.

337
00:16:56,060 --> 00:17:00,530
Is that, is that a big problem right here
that the nonprofits now are probably,

338
00:17:00,531 --> 00:17:02,430
I don't know all the laws
related to nonprofits,

339
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,980
but they're probably in almost every
political case stepping beyond their

340
00:17:06,981 --> 00:17:07,800
boundaries?

341
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:11,060
They definitely are and then
what's happening is they're
becoming clearly their

342
00:17:11,061 --> 00:17:13,010
partisan organizations,
so here you have,

343
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,980
nobody would think media matters is
nonpartisan. I'm pretty sure they did

344
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:19,840
go after a joy reed on cable news when
her whole thing went down about the anti

345
00:17:19,841 --> 00:17:20,650
gay blog posts.

346
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:23,260
Exactly. They've defended all kinds
of people on the left who said,

347
00:17:23,261 --> 00:17:27,190
I'll come far worse things and at least
are politically ideologically aligned

348
00:17:27,191 --> 00:17:30,520
with the left are supposed to be in the
first instance and this is the left set

349
00:17:30,521 --> 00:17:31,091
of standards.

350
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:34,570
That's something you say 20 years ago
somehow means you can never have a public

351
00:17:34,571 --> 00:17:36,910
platform ever again.
For the rest of your human existence.

352
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:40,090
This is not an American standard.
This is not a conservative standard.

353
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,800
This has very much a left standard.
The,

354
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:44,140
but they don't apply it to
their own people ever at all.

355
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,650
I mean some of the things Joe Biden
has said over the years, yeah,

356
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:49,710
he's the leading Democratic candidate for
the presidency and then guy opened his

357
00:17:49,711 --> 00:17:52,500
mouth and crazy stuff came over.
Half the things that Trump says now,

358
00:17:52,501 --> 00:17:53,790
although he says them sloppily,

359
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:57,330
are the exact same things that Obama
said about immigration and Clinton said

360
00:17:57,331 --> 00:18:00,970
about immigration and Dianne
Feinstein in the rest of them. So the,

361
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,810
it's extraordinary for the,
for this sort of one side of application,

362
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,320
but clearly Tucker is a target because
Tucker is willing to take on big tech and

363
00:18:07,321 --> 00:18:10,930
the goal is they're testing when can
we use something in the person's past.

364
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:13,650
But what's extraordinary about all
of this, what unites all of it,

365
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,810
whether it's the Covington
case or the Alex Jones case,

366
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,570
is that you have people who
are unwilling to debate ideas.

367
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:20,670
It's all about if you disagree with them,

368
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,770
then they're going to
target you as an individual.

369
00:18:22,771 --> 00:18:24,900
They're going to make your life
difficult as an individual.

370
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:28,140
They're going to harass you as an
individual stock. You as an individual.

371
00:18:28,141 --> 00:18:29,670
I've already been to
Tucker's house by the way,

372
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:33,420
precisely when his wife was there and
had no clue what was going on and they're

373
00:18:33,421 --> 00:18:36,420
banging on the door and that was a
reason why Fox went off Twitter for an

374
00:18:36,421 --> 00:18:39,180
extended time period. Cause Twitter
would do nothing about it. I mean the,

375
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:41,460
the extraordinary
discrepancy in disparity.

376
00:18:41,461 --> 00:18:43,920
Everybody can witness and everybody
and people were like, Tim,

377
00:18:43,921 --> 00:18:46,890
pools on the left can
say this is problematic.

378
00:18:46,891 --> 00:18:51,360
This is kind of obvious what you guys are
doing and recognize how problematic it

379
00:18:51,361 --> 00:18:53,850
is because they're not going to
stop there. It's like Alex Jones,

380
00:18:53,851 --> 00:18:55,290
they're not going to stop with Alex Jones.

381
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,530
They're going to use it as an example to
try to go after everyone else to scare

382
00:18:58,531 --> 00:19:01,650
and intimidate everyone else. You
better not be in the independent press.

383
00:19:01,651 --> 00:19:03,030
You'd better not be in
the independent speech.

384
00:19:03,031 --> 00:19:06,540
You better not be sharing a dissident
narrative or we're going to be able to

385
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:10,920
demonetize Yardi platform
you a d bang you, uh, or,

386
00:19:10,921 --> 00:19:13,080
or defame you routinely and
regularly and get away with.

387
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,160
And that's why we need equalize the
playing field. And, but for Tucker's case,

388
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:19,020
what he could do,
uh,

389
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:22,300
is he could potentially go after
media matters for misrepresenting or

390
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:24,120
mischaracterizing the set of events.

391
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,870
They have a habit of putting out a video
that decontextualizes what happened.

392
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:28,830
They did it to Alex Jones.

393
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:32,540
They would take them where he's talking
about this subject put into a minute, uh,

394
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:34,590
where it looks like he's talking
about Sandy Hook is actually not,

395
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:36,120
he's talking about something else.
And they would say,

396
00:19:36,121 --> 00:19:39,720
these are all of the statements. So my,
they've likely done the same thing to him,

397
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:42,080
but there's limited remedies.
I also saw one of,

398
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:44,070
I think it was one of the
directors of media matters.

399
00:19:44,071 --> 00:19:46,200
I actually retweeted it saying,
if you think this is bad,

400
00:19:46,201 --> 00:19:49,700
we've got a lot more or something to
that effect. And I thought this, they're,

401
00:19:49,701 --> 00:19:54,660
they're telling you how evil they are
because they're saying we are releasing

402
00:19:54,661 --> 00:19:58,710
this information in a calculated way
to destroy a man. We're not just,

403
00:19:58,711 --> 00:20:02,010
we're not just doing it for publicly like
we found all this stuff and we're just

404
00:20:02,011 --> 00:20:04,620
going to put it all out there on day
one because people should know about his

405
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:05,100
path.

406
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:09,690
It's like we're going to keep the monster
being fed so that it can keep feeding

407
00:20:09,691 --> 00:20:12,480
on correct and it's why are
they so scared of ideas?

408
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:17,160
If they think Tucker's wrong, an ideas
debate his ideas, why attack him?

409
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:21,060
Why especially why attack him on something
he said 20 years ago on a shock jock

410
00:20:21,061 --> 00:20:22,860
show?
There's also something crazy you could do.

411
00:20:22,861 --> 00:20:25,680
You could actually pick up the remote.
You're not going to believe this.

412
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,560
There's a button on that thing that
allows you to scroll up or down.

413
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:31,620
Have you seen this thing? Exactly. I mean
if you don't like what you're hearing,

414
00:20:31,621 --> 00:20:35,000
you don't have to listen to it. If you
think it's wrong, you should engage in.

415
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,730
Years ago, Professor Lash, great historian
passed away some years ago. He said,

416
00:20:38,731 --> 00:20:42,690
the reason why we expose our ideas and
debate other people isn't necessarily to

417
00:20:42,691 --> 00:20:43,524
persuade them.

418
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:46,950
It's because they're going to expose
ideas that there are weaknesses in our

419
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:50,170
argument. And we often research
a topic when somebody says,

420
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:53,320
we got told that must be wrong and we go
and find out about it would become more

421
00:20:53,321 --> 00:20:57,640
informed by engaging in the public
debate process. And that's, that's good,

422
00:20:57,641 --> 00:20:58,420
that's healthy.

423
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:01,120
But these are people who fundamentally
don't believe in free thought,

424
00:21:01,121 --> 00:21:03,550
free expression and free speech.
Fundamentally,

425
00:21:03,551 --> 00:21:05,350
they believe that you should
have the right thought,

426
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,500
not that you should have free thought,
you should have the right expression,

427
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:10,060
not that you should have free expression.

428
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:14,500
They've combined sort of the inquisitional
Catholic church with like 1920s

429
00:21:14,501 --> 00:21:17,650
communists and they've integrated
the two in their approach.

430
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:21,490
And they're using our legal system and
using our political system and their

431
00:21:21,491 --> 00:21:25,450
superior power in the cultural,
uh, areas of influence,

432
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,730
whether it's Hollywood,
whether it's big media,

433
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:31,300
whether it's big tech to suppress and
oppress those people who have different or

434
00:21:31,301 --> 00:21:34,090
dissonant views than them,
including people on parts of the left.

435
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:39,070
So I mean people like temple is being
called a Nazi because he appears on Joe

436
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:41,950
Rogan and ask a few questions at Twitter.
I mean this is insanity.

437
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:43,830
So that's actually,
I was going to go somewhere else,

438
00:21:43,831 --> 00:21:45,720
but let's jump there for a second.
So like for example,

439
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:47,850
when I had Tim Poolan last week,

440
00:21:47,851 --> 00:21:52,850
there were verified people on Twitter
calling Tim a Nazi and Mia Fascists or me

441
00:21:52,851 --> 00:21:57,070
and Nazi and Tim, a fascist. I, I've
mentioned this before. I've had an ah Ha,

442
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,680
I grew up around Holocaust survivors.

443
00:21:58,681 --> 00:22:01,260
I lost family on both my
mom and my dad's side.

444
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,220
Okay.
Now again,

445
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:06,910
I'm the free speech guy so I
don't want to sue these people.

446
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:13,190
Is there some legal remedy for this
if I was someone different than I am?

447
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:18,620
Correct, yeah, there is. Because for
example, I took a couple of years ago,

448
00:22:18,621 --> 00:22:21,570
the Cassandra Fairbank's case,
it gets a, and one of the I,

449
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,140
one of the reasons I took it is,
yeah,

450
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,520
I want send a former lefty, by the way,
she's now all Trump, but former lefty.

451
00:22:27,521 --> 00:22:31,330
I had drinks with her one night. She gave
me her full on lefty, lefty, lefty, lefty.

452
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:35,480
Yeah, exactly. Part Puerto Rican.
And she was accused by Emma Roller,

453
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:38,810
a flashing on white power gesture
and this was the universal,

454
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:43,220
just became a white power
that was like so and so.

455
00:22:43,221 --> 00:22:46,400
She was on Twitter and he's like, I
got to stop this, can somebody help me?

456
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,181
And I said,
I'll,

457
00:22:47,181 --> 00:22:50,480
I'll help for free because I liked the
area of the case and thought needed to

458
00:22:50,481 --> 00:22:54,770
stop this because they're used to being
able to say, I'll call someone and Nazi,

459
00:22:54,771 --> 00:22:57,800
I'll call someone a racist and
that's not actionable at law.

460
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,150
And I wanted to change that.

461
00:22:59,151 --> 00:23:02,930
I want him to say when you make very
specific statements about someone's belief

462
00:23:02,931 --> 00:23:06,950
structure that someone can interpret in
a jury can objective Lee verifies either

463
00:23:06,951 --> 00:23:10,790
true or false that I think that
should be something you can sue over.

464
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:14,870
So I brought the case in DC and we
couldn't meet the actual malice standard,

465
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:19,040
but the court said yes, saying someone
is a racist in a particular way,

466
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:20,750
like saying it's a white power gesture,

467
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:23,360
you can be sued for the
United States for liable.

468
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,850
And lies and under the
defamation laws of DC,

469
00:23:25,851 --> 00:23:27,500
which are more restrictive
than a lot of other laws.

470
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,780
So that's established the standards.
I always,

471
00:23:29,781 --> 00:23:32,450
people think I can just say
anything and never get sued.

472
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:35,840
That's what we're going to make the point
in the Covington case. No you can't.

473
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:40,040
If you say things that you know not to
be true that a jury can look at and say I

474
00:23:40,041 --> 00:23:41,420
can objectives,
we verify this.

475
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:44,780
We the juries make determinations about
whether someone is involved in a hate

476
00:23:44,781 --> 00:23:45,614
crime day.

477
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:49,250
They make a determination whether someone
has racially discriminatory animus or

478
00:23:49,251 --> 00:23:51,500
motivation every day.
So if they're getting,

479
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:53,240
if someone's accusing
you of being a racist,

480
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:56,990
that should be actionable in law because
a jury can make that determination as a

481
00:23:56,991 --> 00:24:01,400
matter of objective fact and the fair
banks case establishes precedent that you

482
00:24:01,401 --> 00:24:04,310
can under certain circumstances
get legal remedy for that.

483
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:05,410
Got It.

484
00:24:05,411 --> 00:24:09,040
Will never cease to amaze me that the
free speech crew or the people that have

485
00:24:09,041 --> 00:24:13,540
to do certain things through law exact
such just to maintain free speech,

486
00:24:13,541 --> 00:24:16,510
which aside, it sounds so counter
intuitive, but it's so fascinating to me.

487
00:24:16,511 --> 00:24:18,640
So a couple of times you've mentioned Fox,

488
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:20,950
I think there's something
interesting happening here. Now,

489
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:25,420
has CNN or Msnbc ever put you on? No.
Have they ever asked you to come on?

490
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:29,050
CNN did way back about two years
ago. Okay. So CNN did two years ago.

491
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:31,910
MSNBC has not, Fox puts you on. Um,

492
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:36,490
now fox only puts me on and they put
me on with, no, I'd go on live shows.

493
00:24:36,491 --> 00:24:39,040
They don't tell me to say anything.
I can say whatever the hell I want.

494
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:43,060
I often bring up liberal Craig
while I'm, while I'm on there. Uh,

495
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:46,060
but it seems also clear to me that partly
what's going on with the Tucker thing

496
00:24:46,061 --> 00:24:49,150
is that they are really going for
Fox there. The plan is, all right,

497
00:24:49,151 --> 00:24:50,020
we'll take out Tucker.

498
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:53,050
He's sort of the bravest or the
most outspoken or whatever it is.

499
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:57,430
But really then we'll make this about
going for foxes licensing and broadcast

500
00:24:57,431 --> 00:25:01,270
abilities and everything else. You're
nodding. So I suspect you agree with me,

501
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:01,860
but I,

502
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:06,640
I'm amazed because it's like there's so
much lefty media and you never saw the

503
00:25:06,641 --> 00:25:08,770
right trying to destroy
all the lefty immediate.

504
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:12,280
There's basically one fox and it doesn't
mean I love everything they're doing.

505
00:25:12,281 --> 00:25:17,260
I don't, but you need some counterbalanced
don't. Yeah, absolutely. If

506
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:20,770
you have the approach of the inquisitional
Catholic Church or institutional

507
00:25:20,771 --> 00:25:24,220
communism of a status variety,
then what?

508
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:28,120
What drives you crazy as the heresy
so you don't look at it and say, Geez,

509
00:25:28,121 --> 00:25:32,710
how many fair balanced expressions do we
have on both sides to the acquisitional

510
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:32,860
Catholic Church?

511
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:35,920
There's only in the Catholic church
perspective and everybody else needs to be

512
00:25:35,921 --> 00:25:39,890
burned at the stake for the status
Communist. Same dynamic there.

513
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:42,610
One state channel,
there's no alternative state channel.

514
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:45,850
There's no anti state channel. So when
you come at it from that perspective,

515
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:50,200
what Unites, say Alex Jones,
the Covington case and Fox is,

516
00:25:50,201 --> 00:25:54,190
these are three institutions and they
represent different institutions that are

517
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:57,550
giving an independent narrative.
So when I was at Yale,

518
00:25:57,551 --> 00:26:01,180
we did a history project that was actually
about why African Americans and poor

519
00:26:01,181 --> 00:26:03,830
whites in the south,
we're often treated or,

520
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:08,890
or portrayed and very discriminatory
ways and cultural medium between 1,919 70

521
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:13,270
and what you find is that historically
those communities have alternative

522
00:26:13,271 --> 00:26:16,810
narratives are grandparents and parents
tell stories different than say the

523
00:26:16,811 --> 00:26:19,060
civics book version they learn
in third grade in public school.

524
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:22,870
And so consequently those groups are often
changed and censored and portrayed in

525
00:26:22,871 --> 00:26:27,160
a negative light so that the broader
public audience wouldn't trust them to

526
00:26:27,161 --> 00:26:30,070
listen to them or a react to them.
So the same thing as here.

527
00:26:30,071 --> 00:26:32,950
Like you look at the Covington kids,
they represent private Catholic education.

528
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,220
What is private?
Catholic?

529
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:37,810
Catholic education is one of the last
institutions of independent thought

530
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:41,200
compared to say all the public state
schools and public institutions.

531
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:42,970
So it drives him crazy that they,

532
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:46,470
this institution that they can't control
their thoughts and mind off, right?

533
00:26:46,471 --> 00:26:47,840
Because they don't have
access to that instance.

534
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:50,550
And then you even saw in the midst
of all this, I'm sure you saw this,

535
00:26:50,551 --> 00:26:54,570
there was that guy from the New York Times
who said, I want to know your stories.

536
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:57,090
Remember, I forget what the Hashtag you
used was, but he wanted to know your,

537
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:57,840
you're Catholic.

538
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,560
It was like Hashtag Catholic schools
stories precisely because let's now New

539
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,630
York Times, let's go after them
once we're done with this thing.

540
00:27:03,631 --> 00:27:05,730
So let's go after the
whole Catholic church.

541
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:09,810
Let's go after the Catholic
schools because we need
people to be afraid to be a

542
00:27:09,811 --> 00:27:12,720
part of those goals, to be ashamed.
If they're connected to those schools,

543
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:15,780
parents worry that if their
skills are listed on their CV,

544
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:19,230
their kids' futures will be impaired
and not have these schools being

545
00:27:19,231 --> 00:27:23,790
independent sources of thought outside
of the sort of cultural liberal, uh, uh,

546
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:26,130
hegemonic view.
And the same thing is true.

547
00:27:26,131 --> 00:27:29,280
Like Alex Jones represent sort of an
independent part of the press. Uh,

548
00:27:29,281 --> 00:27:33,210
Fox News represents institutional
part of the press that's independent,

549
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:37,200
that expresses its own perspective. That's
not part of the left majority. I mean,

550
00:27:37,201 --> 00:27:40,680
CNN and Msnbc and ABC and NBC.
And CBS,

551
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:44,430
even if they're using public airwaves
are overwhelmingly on one side.

552
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,481
Same with PBS,

553
00:27:45,481 --> 00:27:49,680
same with NPR and there's a lot of
good value and I watch all of them at

554
00:27:49,681 --> 00:27:51,330
different times or listened
to them at different times,

555
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:54,480
but I want the other side
expressed and so why?

556
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:56,550
It's this fear of free expression,

557
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:00,090
this fear of free speech that's
leading to these censorship campaigns,

558
00:28:00,091 --> 00:28:04,080
a shame campaigns, these
targeting campaigns, these
privacy invasion campaigns.

559
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:07,050
When I've told people is if you're ever
to the point where you're attacking a

560
00:28:07,051 --> 00:28:10,230
person or trying to shame a
person trying to censor a person,

561
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:13,620
trying to invade their privacy
than what you're really looking,

562
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,690
you're doing as you're looking in
the mirror and telling yourself,

563
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:18,630
I've failed on the argument,
I can't persuade on ideas,

564
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,760
no audience would
actually believe my ideas.

565
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:25,230
So it's an admission of failure and
they're really resorting to these extreme

566
00:28:25,231 --> 00:28:29,040
tactics because they're recognizing
they're losing in the public debate.

567
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:32,350
Do you think part of it also is
that it's intentional? Not now,

568
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:34,890
perhaps they're losing in the public
debate. I think that's probably,

569
00:28:34,891 --> 00:28:35,880
you could debate that either way.

570
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:39,000
On one hand I'm very enthused about
sort of where we're at in this.

571
00:28:39,001 --> 00:28:42,720
On the other hand it's very scary
too because you see this socialist,

572
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,690
whatever the hell that is arising.
So, but putting that aside,

573
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:48,570
do you think part of it is that they're
in doing it intentionally because they

574
00:28:48,571 --> 00:28:51,780
just want to basically uh,

575
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:53,580
so chaos all over the place.

576
00:28:53,581 --> 00:28:57,390
That partly what they need for
whatever their political goals are,

577
00:28:57,530 --> 00:29:02,530
they need the system that has been pretty
freakin spectacular for 200 plus years

578
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:07,170
to appear chaotic. So they, so they, what
do they do? They sew chaos. It's very,

579
00:29:07,171 --> 00:29:10,320
what's amazing is how paralleled is
the 1920 street violence in Europe.

580
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:13,590
So you see like a lot of the communist
tactics that were used back then and the

581
00:29:13,591 --> 00:29:17,490
fascist tactics that were used back
then was in WWE were designed to sow

582
00:29:17,491 --> 00:29:21,120
distrust in the system. So distrusted
the institution. That's it protected.

583
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,200
That's it.
Every day.

584
00:29:22,201 --> 00:29:26,600
Now Aoc doing another thing about how
evil we are in Reagan's evenly capitalism,

585
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:28,500
capitalism to hate pedal.
Marya.

586
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:31,380
I think with like the combination you're
talking about where there's these bad

587
00:29:31,381 --> 00:29:34,200
ideas that are spreading and yet
winning in the public debate,

588
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:37,410
what unites them is if
both sides get presented,

589
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:40,050
most people will take a
humanitarian decision,

590
00:29:40,051 --> 00:29:43,750
will make a good choice based on their
common experience in their comments sets.

591
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:44,741
Whereas,

592
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:48,420
and so that's why this side that wants
to spread their ideas knows they can't

593
00:29:48,421 --> 00:29:49,181
allow that open,

594
00:29:49,181 --> 00:29:52,510
fair debate to happen or
those institutions to be
trusted and protected and

595
00:29:52,511 --> 00:29:57,250
respected. If they can. D If they can
get people to no longer to not listen,

596
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,600
to not hear independent voices,

597
00:29:58,601 --> 00:30:01,180
to be afraid to be a part
of independent institutions,

598
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:04,720
to feel ashamed if they're connected
to it, to say, Hey, if I'm a lawyer,

599
00:30:04,721 --> 00:30:07,720
I represent this person, I'm going to
be attacked. If I'm, if I'm in the,

600
00:30:07,721 --> 00:30:10,180
in the public arena and I
voiced an independent view,

601
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:13,000
I'm going to be targeted and harassed
and stalked and then the rest,

602
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:16,480
they want people to be
scared and intimidated to
express their ideas because I

603
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:19,960
think they know that in an in a
non chaotic open debate structure,

604
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:20,823
they don't win.

605
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:23,350
And I think that's what the recommend
because otherwise you don't have to resort

606
00:30:23,351 --> 00:30:27,610
to these ridiculous tactics
and techniques. If your
ideas are great and popular,

607
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:30,270
you don't have to use chaotic
techniques. You don't have to, uh,

608
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,770
you don't have to try to censor people.
You don't have to attack people.

609
00:30:32,771 --> 00:30:36,760
You don't have to say when to Tucker say
20 years ago on a, on a shock jock show,

610
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:37,511
you can say,
Hey,

611
00:30:37,511 --> 00:30:40,240
I disagree with what he said yesterday
on Fox and I'm willing to debate them.

612
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,370
And Tucker is one of the
few people who says, Hey,

613
00:30:42,371 --> 00:30:43,510
you can come on the show and we'll debate

614
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:47,120
quite literally what it statement said
exactly. If you don't like my ideas, let,

615
00:30:47,121 --> 00:30:48,720
let's talk about exactly.
All right.

616
00:30:48,721 --> 00:30:51,480
So I want to ask you something that
I think will sort of thread, oh,

617
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:53,320
you know what, I want to ask you one
other little tech thing and then,

618
00:30:53,321 --> 00:30:55,470
and then something that I think that
will kind of bring us full circle here.

619
00:30:55,471 --> 00:30:56,970
So one of the things is,
you know,

620
00:30:56,971 --> 00:31:00,180
you see me do this all the time
where I have to publicly shame, uh,

621
00:31:00,181 --> 00:31:01,260
youtube in Thai,

622
00:31:01,261 --> 00:31:04,770
they're monetizing my video or making
sure people aren't being unsubscribed to

623
00:31:04,771 --> 00:31:07,820
the rest of it and then ran
a certain amount of people
will say, but Dave, you're,

624
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:09,750
you're a libertarian or whatever.

625
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:12,150
You're not allowed to complain because
you don't want the government involved,

626
00:31:12,151 --> 00:31:14,670
which is so idiotic because of course
I'm using my voice as a citizen.

627
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:18,090
That's what you're supposed to
do. Okay. Putting that aside, um,

628
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:23,750
do you think there is some interesting
legal mechanism if it was to be found out

629
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,030
that they were treating
traffic differently?

630
00:31:27,031 --> 00:31:29,610
So that's a little bit different
than what we talked about earlier,

631
00:31:29,611 --> 00:31:32,970
was talking about content specifically.
So you're saying this or that,

632
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:37,860
but what if they're actually turning
the screws just based on, uh,

633
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:38,880
not something you said,

634
00:31:38,881 --> 00:31:42,510
but they have a general sort of a broad
sense that they don't want certain ideas

635
00:31:42,511 --> 00:31:44,940
getting out there.
I think there are contractual principals,

636
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:48,480
equitable principles and consumer
protection principles that are in play.

637
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:50,820
So once you induce someone,
yeah,

638
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:54,810
you participate in your platform and
then you monetize their participation.

639
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,360
To me,
you have contractual obligations,

640
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:01,540
a equitable obligations you can't have
on just enrichment. So you say, Hey,

641
00:32:01,541 --> 00:32:03,810
if you participate, we,
these are the rules.

642
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:07,230
And if as long as you abide by those
rules will make sure you share in the

643
00:32:07,231 --> 00:32:10,260
profits, for example, of
monetizing your individual video.

644
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:13,320
And if they don't do that,
if they manipulate the algorithm,

645
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,000
they misrepresent facts,

646
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:19,710
they induce conduct and then only keep
the profit for themselves or use it for a

647
00:32:19,711 --> 00:32:21,990
politicized purpose.
That's different than what they said.

648
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:24,030
Those are all consumer
protection violations,

649
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:28,620
equitable all violations and legal
violations sometimes recommend a remedy by

650
00:32:28,621 --> 00:32:30,990
statutes, sometimes remedied
by common law. Well,

651
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:32,910
there's no reason for big
tech to be above the law

652
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:36,350
right there. There might also be some
legal thing related to their own board,

653
00:32:36,351 --> 00:32:38,410
right? I mean, if they're doing
things that are not related, well,

654
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:41,030
if they're not the most profitable
thing, they're bored me. I don't know

655
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,250
exactly what it was. Right?
Shareholders can take action,

656
00:32:43,251 --> 00:32:46,250
so they're going to be a
derivative suits by shareholders.

657
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,181
They could go to the board,

658
00:32:47,181 --> 00:32:51,050
but they can also bring derivative legal
claims against the institution saying

659
00:32:51,051 --> 00:32:52,760
they're not promoting the best profit.

660
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:55,280
They're creating undue
legal risk and liability.

661
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,790
They're not behaving in a
matter consistent with their
professional obligations

662
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:01,730
and their contractual obligations
to their, their own investors.

663
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:05,550
And so they can also bring action.
And in fact, the left leg went up.

664
00:33:05,551 --> 00:33:08,510
I told a lot of people is, look at what
the left has done between the seventies.

665
00:33:08,511 --> 00:33:09,344
In 2000,

666
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:13,370
you'll see a lot of legal roadmaps for
how to go at what they're doing now.

667
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:15,270
So they were with some of
the, you know, the, uh,

668
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:17,720
on the apartheid
campaigns in South Africa,

669
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:22,160
they targeted different people
using shareholders suits
using shareholder claims,

670
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:26,030
using shareholder complaints to remedy
that of people who are profiting from the

671
00:33:26,031 --> 00:33:27,470
apartheid system in South Africa.

672
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:31,010
Why can't we do the same thing now
based on the same legal theories,

673
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:34,220
same factual predicates as the,
as what's taking place here,

674
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:37,370
which is inconsistent with their
obligations and promises to people.

675
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:40,270
I guess partly in, this brings
me to the, to the last question,

676
00:33:40,271 --> 00:33:43,090
it's partly about bravery.
You need citizens who were brave enough.

677
00:33:43,091 --> 00:33:46,960
You need lawyers who are brave enough
and they've created a system where

678
00:33:46,961 --> 00:33:48,760
everyone is afraid.
Because the,

679
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:52,060
when I go out speaking to college
campuses or even I do Q and, a,

680
00:33:52,061 --> 00:33:54,370
when I'm doing standup or wherever I go,

681
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:58,750
the question I get more than anything
else is I'm afraid to say what I think and

682
00:33:58,751 --> 00:33:59,441
what should I do.

683
00:33:59,441 --> 00:34:01,900
And it's usually students that are saying
I want to get a grade cause I want to

684
00:34:01,901 --> 00:34:05,260
get out, I want to get to Grad school or
whatever. And I always think it's like,

685
00:34:05,261 --> 00:34:08,680
man, if everyone's thinking
this, if we all just stopped,

686
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:11,740
if we all just stopped acquiescing to it,

687
00:34:11,741 --> 00:34:16,060
we could actually change this thing
like that. So my question to you is you,

688
00:34:16,061 --> 00:34:20,140
and you mentioned your father before,
but why? Why are you willing to do this?

689
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:21,670
Why are you willing to
put your ass on the line?

690
00:34:21,671 --> 00:34:22,750
Where does this come from in you?

691
00:34:22,910 --> 00:34:26,540
So it's two things. One, it's, it's
growing up. So grew up poor in the south,

692
00:34:26,541 --> 00:34:30,470
got a scholarship to private schools,
scholarship to Yale. When I was at Yale,

693
00:34:30,471 --> 00:34:32,840
they tried to get rid of
poor students who were there,

694
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:36,710
let a protest by leaving Yale in order
to get them to reinstate their policies.

695
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:40,040
And I saw there, I was like,
I'm one kid, I'm 19 years old,

696
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:44,240
I'm challenging all of Yale University,
which wasn't exactly a small institution.

697
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:48,380
And just by leaving the school and
getting public attention for it,

698
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:51,500
I got them to reverse their
policies and protect poor students.

699
00:34:51,501 --> 00:34:56,390
Same access that I had to a rights to
full financial aid rights to be treated in

700
00:34:56,391 --> 00:34:59,960
a nondiscriminatory manner
in the application process.
So as a, at a young age,

701
00:34:59,961 --> 00:35:03,350
I learned why one person can change the
world. When I was a real little kid,

702
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:07,310
I loved Medgar Evers and Medgar Evers
had this great quote where they asked him

703
00:35:07,311 --> 00:35:09,260
why he wasn't afraid to die and he said,

704
00:35:09,261 --> 00:35:12,800
most men die a thousand deaths every day.
I'm only going to die once.

705
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:15,410
And I was little kid. I was like, I
want to be at Medgar Evers. It's like,

706
00:35:15,411 --> 00:35:18,170
that is so powerful. That is so
important. That's so influential.

707
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:20,300
And you realize that one
person can make a difference.

708
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,160
And when you realize one
person can make a difference,

709
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:24,350
if they know it here and act on it here,

710
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:27,890
then you realize that that that's
the power. That's the passion.

711
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:30,680
That's what leads you to want to
change the world, not be afraid of.

712
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,890
I've had rogue agents threatened me,
a IRS,

713
00:35:33,891 --> 00:35:36,470
people put me on audit every
other year whenever I want a case.

714
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:38,370
I've rogue judges threatened me.

715
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:40,920
I've had people say that they were going
to try to put me on a bogus criminal

716
00:35:40,921 --> 00:35:41,754
investigation.

717
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:45,360
I've had every smear campaign known to
man had bomb threats coming because of my

718
00:35:45,361 --> 00:35:47,040
Covington case representation,

719
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,640
and none of it concerns me because if
you understand that you really have the

720
00:35:50,641 --> 00:35:53,430
powers one person to make a
real difference in the world,

721
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:56,640
then other people will start to recognize
that and they'll act on their power.

722
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:58,680
They'll voice their,
their abilities,

723
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:01,800
they'll use their capabilities
to make a meaningful difference,

724
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:04,920
and that's how the world
changes and that's how the
world becomes a better place.

725
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,560
That is how you end an interview. Can we
smoke one of those cigars? He right here,

726
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:14,400
right? We're done here. Follow Robert.
I have a feeling you'll be back here.

727
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:19,200
I have a feeling that's going to happen
on Twitter at Barnes underscore law.
