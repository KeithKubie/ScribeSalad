Tibetans because we've got to save the
 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.850
Tibetans because we've got to save the

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860
global economy and then three months
 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.500
global economy and then three months
later something awful is going to happen

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510
later something awful is going to happen
 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.960
later something awful is going to happen
in Tibet and guess what the United

in Tibet and guess what the United
 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.160
in Tibet and guess what the United
States government is going to have to

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170
States government is going to have to
 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.470
States government is going to have to
say something about it because it would

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480
say something about it because it would
 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.230
say something about it because it would
be politically impossible not to

and then the Chinese having seen the
 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.240
and then the Chinese having seen the
pattern of silence become even more

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250
pattern of silence become even more
 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.610

upset they'll say where does that come
 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.680
upset they'll say where does that come
from we thought you weren't talking to

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690
from we thought you weren't talking to
 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.780
from we thought you weren't talking to
us about that stuff anymore and the

us about that stuff anymore and the
 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.020
us about that stuff anymore and the
diplomatic costs are even greater so I

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030
diplomatic costs are even greater so I
 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.410
diplomatic costs are even greater so I
think for you know realistic diplomatic

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420
think for you know realistic diplomatic
 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.640
think for you know realistic diplomatic

that's just part of doing business with
 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.170
that's just part of doing business with
the United States that we're going to

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180
the United States that we're going to
 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.910
the United States that we're going to

often used as an argument against
 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.610
often used as an argument against
intervening to stop human rights abuses

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620
intervening to stop human rights abuses
 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.690
intervening to stop human rights abuses
and it's a complicated set of arguments

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700
and it's a complicated set of arguments
 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.710
and it's a complicated set of arguments
but certainly in cases where you have

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720
but certainly in cases where you have
 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:26.630

extreme violence against civilians the

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640
extreme violence against civilians the

with those situations that if a state is
 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.940
with those situations that if a state is

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530
Americans in building a world in which

governments treat their people better a

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180
governments treat their people better a
 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.250
governments treat their people better a
lot of reasons for that so so I don't

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260
lot of reasons for that so so I don't
 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.590
lot of reasons for that so so I don't
think that sovereignty is an absolute

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600
think that sovereignty is an absolute
 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.860

bar to one country or one group of

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870
bar to one country or one group of
 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.000
bar to one country or one group of
people promoting human rights beyond

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010
people promoting human rights beyond
 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:07.679
people promoting human rights beyond
their political borders

00:05:07.679 --> 00:05:07.689
 

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:09.449
the United States can't be an effective

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:09.459
the United States can't be an effective
 

00:05:09.459 --> 00:05:11.579
the United States can't be an effective
champion of Human Rights anywhere if

00:05:11.579 --> 00:05:11.589
champion of Human Rights anywhere if
 

00:05:11.589 --> 00:05:15.899
champion of Human Rights anywhere if
it's generally seen around the world as

00:05:15.899 --> 00:05:15.909
it's generally seen around the world as
 

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:18.869
it's generally seen around the world as
a violator of human rights and so when

00:05:18.869 --> 00:05:18.879
a violator of human rights and so when
 

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:21.719
a violator of human rights and so when
the bush administration was not just

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:21.729
the bush administration was not just
 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:24.389
the bush administration was not just
engaging the justifying practices like

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:24.399
engaging the justifying practices like
 

00:05:24.399 --> 00:05:26.699
engaging the justifying practices like
torture and disappearing people in

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:26.709
torture and disappearing people in
 

00:05:26.709 --> 00:05:30.329
torture and disappearing people in
secret prisons and long-term detention

00:05:30.329 --> 00:05:30.339
secret prisons and long-term detention
 

00:05:30.339 --> 00:05:34.289
secret prisons and long-term detention
without charge it was very difficult not

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:34.299
without charge it was very difficult not
 

00:05:34.299 --> 00:05:35.879
without charge it was very difficult not
impossible interestingly but difficult

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:35.889
impossible interestingly but difficult
 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:38.399
impossible interestingly but difficult
for the United States to effectively

00:05:38.399 --> 00:05:38.409
for the United States to effectively
 

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:40.319
for the United States to effectively
urge other countries not to do those

00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:40.329
urge other countries not to do those
 

00:05:40.329 --> 00:05:42.779
urge other countries not to do those
things i do think although I'm critical

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:42.789
things i do think although I'm critical
 

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:44.069
things i do think although I'm critical
of some of the things that the Obama

00:05:44.069 --> 00:05:44.079
of some of the things that the Obama
 

00:05:44.079 --> 00:05:46.769
of some of the things that the Obama
administration has done that that he has

00:05:46.769 --> 00:05:46.779
administration has done that that he has
 

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:50.309
administration has done that that he has
gone a long way towards not just

00:05:50.309 --> 00:05:50.319
gone a long way towards not just
 

00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:51.929
gone a long way towards not just
eliminating those practices but

00:05:51.929 --> 00:05:51.939
eliminating those practices but
 

00:05:51.939 --> 00:05:54.029
eliminating those practices but
convincing the world that they're being

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:54.039
convincing the world that they're being
 

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:56.609
convincing the world that they're being
eliminated I I think this is actually a

00:05:56.609 --> 00:05:56.619
eliminated I I think this is actually a
 

00:05:56.619 --> 00:06:00.719
eliminated I I think this is actually a
moment perhaps a rare moment when the

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:00.729
moment perhaps a rare moment when the
 

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:01.889
moment perhaps a rare moment when the
United States government and

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:01.899
United States government and
 

00:06:01.899 --> 00:06:04.290
United States government and
particularly the president has a lot of

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:04.300
particularly the president has a lot of
 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:09.049
particularly the president has a lot of
moral credibility to go to the world and

00:06:09.049 --> 00:06:09.059
moral credibility to go to the world and
 

00:06:09.059 --> 00:06:12.839
moral credibility to go to the world and
champion an end to torture and they are

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:12.849
champion an end to torture and they are
 

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:14.579
champion an end to torture and they are
trials for everybody and freedom of the

00:06:14.579 --> 00:06:14.589
trials for everybody and freedom of the
 

00:06:14.589 --> 00:06:18.149
trials for everybody and freedom of the
press and freedom of speech that moment

00:06:18.149 --> 00:06:18.159
press and freedom of speech that moment
 

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:20.729
press and freedom of speech that moment
may not last but we do have a moment

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:20.739
may not last but we do have a moment
 

00:06:20.739 --> 00:06:23.609
may not last but we do have a moment
like that now and it's important that it

00:06:23.609 --> 00:06:23.619
like that now and it's important that it
 

00:06:23.619 --> 00:06:29.740
like that now and it's important that it
be used effectively analyzing

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:29.750
 

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:32.990
technology can be used to suppress human

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:33.000
technology can be used to suppress human
 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.370
technology can be used to suppress human
rights and to facilitate human rights

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:34.380
rights and to facilitate human rights
 

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:37.250
rights and to facilitate human rights
that's always been the case there's

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:37.260
that's always been the case there's
 

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.560
that's always been the case there's
never been one technology that is

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:39.570
never been one technology that is
 

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:42.050
never been one technology that is
beneficial only to one side in that

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:42.060
beneficial only to one side in that
 

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:44.660
beneficial only to one side in that
struggle so governments like China and

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:44.670
struggle so governments like China and
 

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:49.070
struggle so governments like China and
Iran can use the internet to monitor the

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:49.080
Iran can use the internet to monitor the
 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:52.880
Iran can use the internet to monitor the
their peoples communication to try to

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:52.890
their peoples communication to try to
 

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:56.810
their peoples communication to try to
identify dissidents and go after them

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:56.820
identify dissidents and go after them
 

00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:00.650
identify dissidents and go after them
individually but of course campaigners

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:00.660
individually but of course campaigners
 

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:02.840
individually but of course campaigners
for democracy and human rights can also

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:02.850
for democracy and human rights can also
 

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:05.920
for democracy and human rights can also
use these technologies as we saw in Iran

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:05.930
use these technologies as we saw in Iran
 

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:08.750
use these technologies as we saw in Iran
to get around government restrictions on

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:08.760
to get around government restrictions on
 

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:12.500
to get around government restrictions on
speech and it's a tug-of-war between the

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:12.510
speech and it's a tug-of-war between the
 

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:15.290
speech and it's a tug-of-war between the
dark side of the Internet and the good

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:15.300
dark side of the Internet and the good
 

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:18.650
dark side of the Internet and the good
side and there's a lot that the United

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:18.660
side and there's a lot that the United
 

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:22.370
side and there's a lot that the United
States can do to to help the good side

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:22.380
States can do to to help the good side
 

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:25.820
States can do to to help the good side
win in that fight for example there are

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:25.830
win in that fight for example there are
 

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:29.150
win in that fight for example there are
really interesting technologies being

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:29.160
really interesting technologies being
 

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:32.140
really interesting technologies being
developed that allow people to

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:32.150
developed that allow people to
 

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:36.590
developed that allow people to
communicate privately to defeat

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:36.600
communicate privately to defeat
 

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:40.210
communicate privately to defeat
surveillance and to defeat censorship um

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:40.220
surveillance and to defeat censorship um
 

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:44.540
surveillance and to defeat censorship um
programs that can be downloaded by folks

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:44.550
programs that can be downloaded by folks
 

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:47.020
programs that can be downloaded by folks
in Iran and China and Burma and Vietnam

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:47.030
in Iran and China and Burma and Vietnam
 

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:49.580
in Iran and China and Burma and Vietnam
and it's something that we've asked the

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:49.590
and it's something that we've asked the
 

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:53.000
and it's something that we've asked the
US government to to fund and and support

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:53.010
US government to to fund and and support
 

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:57.380
US government to to fund and and support
there's also a very interesting and

00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:57.390
there's also a very interesting and
 

00:07:57.390 --> 00:08:00.250
there's also a very interesting and
ambiguous role played by American

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:00.260
ambiguous role played by American
 

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.170
ambiguous role played by American
technology companies like Google and

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:03.180
technology companies like Google and
 

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:07.580
technology companies like Google and
Yahoo and Cisco these are the companies

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:07.590
Yahoo and Cisco these are the companies
 

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:08.900
Yahoo and Cisco these are the companies
that develop these liberating

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:08.910
that develop these liberating
 

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:12.140
that develop these liberating
technologies that dissidents in Iran and

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:12.150
technologies that dissidents in Iran and
 

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:14.450
technologies that dissidents in Iran and
trying to use but they've also sometimes

00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:14.460
trying to use but they've also sometimes
 

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:16.790
trying to use but they've also sometimes
partnered with the government's to give

00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:16.800
partnered with the government's to give
 

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:20.120
partnered with the government's to give
them the technology they use to suppress

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:20.130
them the technology they use to suppress
 

00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:23.540
them the technology they use to suppress
dissent they've censored their own

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:23.550
dissent they've censored their own
 

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:26.150
dissent they've censored their own
content sometimes and so helping these

content sometimes and so helping these
 

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.640
content sometimes and so helping these
companies figure out what their

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:28.650
companies figure out what their
 

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:31.540
companies figure out what their
responsibilities are when there are

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:31.550
responsibilities are when there are
 

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:34.790
responsibilities are when there are
operating in dictatorships and backing

00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:34.800
operating in dictatorships and backing
 

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:36.770
operating in dictatorships and backing
them up when they have to stand up to

00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:36.780
them up when they have to stand up to
 

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:39.710
them up when they have to stand up to
those governments is a really important

00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:39.720
those governments is a really important
 

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:42.020
those governments is a really important
