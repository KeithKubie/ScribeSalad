[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:07.140
ALAN HOLLINGHURST:
Thank you so much.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:15.540
This novel indeed begins in
the blackout in 1940 in Oxford

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.690
and ends up in the
world of Google

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:26.940
and of very different
forms of communication.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:31.200
It's in five sections, sometimes
with quite large time gaps

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.850
in between them.

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.750
And I hope part of the
effect of this structure

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.480
is that when the reader embarks
on a new section of the book

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.960
they're momentarily disoriented.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.760
And it will take them a page or
two to work out where they are,

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.290
when they are, and what the
hell's going on generally.

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.620
I hope this is also a way
of stimulating the reader's

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.870
imagination to try
to speculate as

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.120
to what might have
happened during the gaps

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.296
between the sections.

00:00:59.296 --> 00:01:01.170
A hazard of this structure
is that it's quite

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.253
a difficult book to talk
about without giving away

00:01:03.253 --> 00:01:06.550
all sorts of important
things about its narrative.

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.760
So I get to read an extract
from the very first chapter.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.660
I'll read two extracts, both
from the very first chapter

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.340
of the book.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.100
It's in Christ Church,
one of the biggest

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.490
colleges in Oxford University.

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.510
It's an October evening in 1940.

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.560
The blitz is raging in London.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.310
But Oxford, 50
miles from London,

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.420
it existed as a strange
remove from all that.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.000
And the conditions
of university life

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.930
would be very
changed by the war.

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.760
The war has now been
going on for a year.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.260
Students are far fewer.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.720
And those who come
up usually do so,

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.870
rather than for an idle three or
four years, for just one year.

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:56.790
They do a short degree.

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.360
And after that is the terrible
uncertainty of enlistment

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.030
and who knows what future.

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.530
But I was rather attracted
to the idea of an Oxford very

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.949
altered from the
traditional, literary types

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:15.430
of the city, the kind of
Brideshead idea, if you like,

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.460
one in which all
that sets of luxury

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:18.975
has been completely removed.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.800
Various quite important
functions from London

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.830
were evacuated to
Oxford in the war.

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.490
The war ministry took
over various colleges.

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:37.240
MI5 split its operations in
half into what they coyly

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.080
called town and
country And the country

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.300
have established itself
at Blenheim Palace just

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.480
outside Oxford during the
time that this first part

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.180
of the narrative is going on.

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.090
The Slade School of
Art, which is normally

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.460
part of University
College London,

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.420
was also evacuated to Oxford.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.690
So you have this strangely
dislocated and disoriented feel

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.480
about the period.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.010
We've had the meeting of
a little literary club who

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.950
exists to invite famous writers
to come and read to them.

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.920
This section
narrated years later

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.640
by the host of
this evening, a man

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.350
called Freddie
Green, who because

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.250
of some mysterious
condition is actually

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.315
exempt from military service
and is beginning his third year.

00:03:28.315 --> 00:03:31.740
There's Evert Dax,
who is the son

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:33.960
of a famous author
they've decided

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.790
to invite to speak to them.

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.900
And Peter Coyle, who is a
rather camp painter of the Slade

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.770
School, who's very much
regretting having been shoved

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.122
off to Oxford and missing
all the fun in London

00:03:46.122 --> 00:03:46.830
during the blitz.

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.612
There's something called Charlie
you don't need to worry about.

00:03:54.612 --> 00:03:57.070
I think that's probably all
you need to know at this stage.

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.710
"Evert and Peter are
looking out of the window

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:08.120
as dusk is falling
across the courtyard.

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.340
Peter says, 'Freddie,
have you seen this man?'

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.480
'Who is it?'

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.880
I went across. 'Oh,
the exhibitionist,

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.980
I suppose you mean,' I said.

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:18.480
'No.

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.440
Oh, he's gone,' said
Peter, still staring out.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.880
I stood at his shoulder
and stared too.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.190
It was that brief
time between sunset

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.190
and the blackout when you could
see into other people's rooms.

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.270
Tall panes which had
reflected the sky all day

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.810
now glowed companionably
here and there.

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.040
And figures were
revealed at work

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.110
or moving around behind
the lit grid of the sashes.

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.940
In the sets directly
opposite, old Sangster,

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.760
the blind French don,
was giving a tutorial

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.880
to a young man so supine that
he might have been asleep.

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.910
And on the floor above,
beneath the dark horizontal

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.260
of the cornice and
the broad pediment,

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.730
a single window
was alight, a lamp

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:02.770
on the desk projecting a
brilliant arc across the wall

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:04.450
and ceiling.

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:06.220
'I spotted him the
other day,' I said.

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.410
'He must be one of the new men.'

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:10.765
Peter waited with
pretended patience.

00:05:10.765 --> 00:05:15.200
And Evert, frowning still, came
back and looked out as well.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.130
Now a rhythmical shadow had
started to leap and shrink

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.220
across the distant ceiling.

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:24.040
'Oh, yes, him,' Evert said, as
the source of the shadow moved

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.880
slowly into view, a figure
in a gleaming singlet,

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.960
steadily lifting and lowering
a pair of hand-weights.

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.790
He did so with concentration.

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:35.494
There was no apparent effort.

00:05:35.494 --> 00:05:36.910
But of course, it
was hard to tell

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:40.510
at this distance, from which he
showed, in his square of light,

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:45.130
as massive and abstracted, as
if shaped from light himself.

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:46.780
Peter put his hand on my arm.

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.685
'My dear,' he said, 'I
seem to have my new model.'

00:05:49.685 --> 00:05:51.400
At which Evert
made a little gasp

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.490
and looked at him
furiously for a second.

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:55.060
'Well, you'd better
get a move on.'

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:59.290
I said, since these days new men
left as quickly and unnoticed

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:00.770
as they came.

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:04.490
'Even you must by that glorious
head, like a Roman gladiator,

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:07.435
Freddie, said Peter. 'And
those powerful shoulders,

00:06:07.435 --> 00:06:11.450
do you see the blue veins
standing in the upper arms?'

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:14.752
'Not without my
telescope,' I said.

00:06:14.752 --> 00:06:16.960
I went to fill the kettle
from the tap on the landing

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.332
and found Jill Darrow
coming up the stairs.

00:06:19.332 --> 00:06:21.790
She was late for the meeting
of the club at which she might

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:23.740
have liked to vote herself.

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:24.880
I was very glad to see her.

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.120
But the atmosphere, which
had taken on a hint deviancy,

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.640
rather changed when
she came into the room.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.520
She hadn't had the benefit of
10 years in the boys' boarding

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.270
school, with all its
ingrained depravities.

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:38.980
I doubt she'd ever
seen a naked man.

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:41.890
Charlie said, 'Ah,
Darrow,' and half stood up,

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:45.340
then dropped back into his chair
with an informality that might

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:47.720
or might not have
been flattering.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.690
'We want Dax to ask
his father to read.'

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:53.170
He said as she removed her
coat and took in who was there.

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:55.300
I set about making the tea.

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:57.260
'Oh, I see,' said Jill.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.470
There was a natural
uncertainty in Evert's presence

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:02.210
as to what could be
said about his father.

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:05.380
At the window, Evert himself
seemed not to know she

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:06.670
had come in.

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:10.360
He and Peter stood staring
up at the room opposite.

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.930
Their backs were expressive,
Peter smaller, half thick

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:16.300
and temperamental,
in the patched tweed

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:21.040
jacket which always gave off dim
chemical odors of the studio.

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.620
Evert, neat and
hesitant, a strictly

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:26.490
raised boy in an
unusually good suit

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:30.320
who seemed to gaze at pleasure
as at the far bank of a river.

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:31.570
'What are you two staring at?'

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:32.670
Jill said.

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:34.224
'Oh, you mustn't
look,' said Peter,

00:07:34.224 --> 00:07:35.390
turning and grinning at her.

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:39.730
At went she went straight to
the window, myself close behind.

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:44.110
The gladiator was still in view,
though now with his back turned

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:47.100
and doing something
with a piece of rope.

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:49.360
I was almost relieved to
see that the scouts had

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:50.860
started their rounds."

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:53.760
The scouts are the
college servants.

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:55.580
"At one window,
and then the next,

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:58.780
the small black-coated
figure appeared, reached up

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:02.740
to close the shutters, and
removed all signs of life.

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:05.620
Across the way the scout
came into Sangster's room,

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:07.780
half-hidden by the
oblong screen he

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:09.520
carried through
into the bedroom,

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:11.650
and after a minute
reappeared, edged

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:14.290
round the two occupants,
and kneeling on the window

00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:17.410
seat gazed out for a
curious few seconds

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:20.040
before pulling the
tall shutters too.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:22.720
By dinner time the
great stone buildings

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:25.476
would be lightless as ruins.

00:08:25.476 --> 00:08:27.370
'Ah, Phil,' said Charlie.

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:31.000
Behind us my own scout had
come in to do the same for us.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.929
I said sternly, 'Do you know
who this fellow is, Phil?'

00:08:34.929 --> 00:08:37.090
Phil had fought at
the Battle of Loos,

00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:40.159
and after that earlier war had
spent 15 years in the Oxford

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:41.500
police.

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:44.146
He was affable and
devoted to the College,

00:08:44.146 --> 00:08:46.270
but seemed sometimes to
regret that he had ended up

00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:49.680
in an apron, dusting and
washing dishes for young man

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:51.660
he was powerless to discipline.

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:52.740
'What was it, sir?'

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:54.360
He propped his screen
against the wall

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:57.990
and came over eagerly, as
if I'd spotted a miscreant.

00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:00.120
I noticed now that
our own reflections

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:02.010
were hanging very
faintly between us

00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:04.260
and the view of other windows.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:05.400
I pointed upwards.

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.730
'This ridiculous
fellow,' I said.

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:11.610
'Oh, him, sir," said Phil, a
bit disappointed but trying

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:13.710
for a moment to share
our own interest

00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:15.190
in the luminous figure.

00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:17.672
'I happen to know there was
a bit of trouble there.'

00:09:17.672 --> 00:09:18.630
'What sort of trouble?'

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:19.620
said Peter.

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:20.715
'Well, the noise, sir.

00:09:20.715 --> 00:09:23.510
Dr. Sangster's been
complaining about it.' 'Oh?

00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:24.090
Said Evert.

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:26.580
'Noise?' 'Rhythmical
creaking, apparently,

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:28.905
sir,' said Phil
with a grim look.

00:09:28.905 --> 00:09:30.690
'Oh, goodness," said Evert.

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:33.005
'He's not one of ours,
though, in fact,' said Phil.

00:09:33.005 --> 00:09:34.160
'Ah,' I said.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:37.280
'No, he's one of the
Brasenose men,' said Phil.

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:40.050
In the vast gloomy
College, its staircases

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:42.630
half-deserted since
the start of the War,

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:44.910
new members of
requisitioned colleges

00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:48.510
had been slipped in here and
there, disoriented freshmen who

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:51.720
find themselves also evacuees.

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:55.110
Brasenose had been seized by
a ministry of some kind, who

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:57.270
according to my tutor
were rather unsure what

00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:58.630
to do with it.

00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:00.380
'If you will just
excuse me, Mr. Green?'

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:01.741
'Oh, of course, Phil.'

00:10:01.741 --> 00:10:03.240
'You don't happen
to know his name?'

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:04.380
said Jill.

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:06.810
'He's called Sparsholt,
miss, said Phil,

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:10.200
with a small cough as he swung
the shutters to and dropped

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:13.470
the iron bar safely in its slot.

00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:17.220
'Sparsholt,' said Peter,
weighing the word and smiling

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:18.780
slyly at Evert.

00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:22.020
'Sounds like part of
a engine, or a gun.'

00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:24.660
Phil looked at him blankly
for a second or two.

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:27.180
'I dare say you're right,'
he said and went through

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:28.710
into the bedroom.

00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:30.870
I sat at my best
Meissen cups, which

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:33.660
I hoped might please Jill,
and in the new closeness

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:35.640
of the panelled
and shuttered room

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:39.260
we settled down to have tea."

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:43.770
That's the first sighting
of young David Sparsholt,

00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:47.490
who will cause quite a
flutter amongst this group

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:50.370
of young men.

00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:56.370
And in a way, the
consequences of the encounters

00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:59.220
that happened in peculiar
conditions of the blackout

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:04.740
in the first part
of the book shape

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:08.370
and, perhaps,
foretell things that

00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:10.710
are going to happen
much later on.

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:17.400
David is only 17 at that
time, unlike the others,

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:23.470
who are dreading the future
in all its uncertainties.

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:28.620
Young David Sparsholt can't
wait to get through Oxford

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:31.140
to sign up, join the RAF.

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:33.330
He knows he's going
to have a great war.

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:34.500
He's got it all planned out.

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:36.840
After the war he's
going to go get married.

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:39.220
He's going to set up
an engineering business

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:40.530
and be very successful.

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:42.750
And he does all these things.

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:46.830
I think in this first section
of the book we see him coming

00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:49.880
to an understanding
of his own power

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:51.924
at his own power
over other people,

00:11:51.924 --> 00:11:53.340
I suppse the quality
of leadership

00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:57.880
of being able to get
people to do what you want.

00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:02.370
And this power is
also something which

00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:06.010
is going to get him into
some quite serious trouble.

00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:11.820
And the trouble happens offstage
in the center of the book.

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:16.200
But it permeates a great
deal that happens afterwards.

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:19.980
The second section of the
book, which was set in 1966,

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:25.020
we first meet David
Sparsholt's son, Johnny.

00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:29.820
And he emerges, really I
suppose, as the protagonist

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:31.950
of the novel.

00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:34.170
And one of the things
I like about writing

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:36.900
about these large
spans of time is

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:41.330
that characters I've imagined
at the beginning move

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:45.900
into center stage later on and
then are themselves, of course,

00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:49.050
pushed into the wings.

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:53.130
Johnny is next met in the middle
section of the book, which

00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:54.480
takes place in 1974.

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:55.920
He has been to art college.

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:59.430
He's very unlike
his father, in being

00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:04.740
sensitive, rather introverted,
responsive to beauty.

00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:07.590
And from the first moment we see
him as a boy, he was drawing.

00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:10.170
And he's going to go
on to have a career

00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:13.930
as a successful
portrait painter.

00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:15.270
He's also gay.

00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:21.370
And when he comes to London
in 1974 at the age of 22,

00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:24.600
he's trying to find
his way through all

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:27.590
the enhanced
possibilities of London

00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:32.370
during those years, now seven
years after the Sexual Offenses

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:38.530
Act of 1967 which decriminalized
male homosexuality in England.

00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:42.530
But the change in the law
having happened overnight,

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:47.080
the social change is taking
rather longer to permeate.

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:48.870
Anyway, I'm going to
read a scene where

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:53.060
he is taken to
his first gay club

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:55.040
in Earl's Court,
which in those days

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:58.900
was the center of
gay life in London.

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:03.680
And he's going there with a
lesbian couple that he's met.

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:09.150
Francesca, who is very
posh and drinks a lot

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:11.645
and is only once
in her life been

00:14:11.645 --> 00:14:14.540
known to take public transport.

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:20.270
And Una, who is a very
large, almost silent,

00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:24.940
woman who works in the
cosmetics department of Fenwick,

00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:27.870
a famous department
store in old Bond Street.

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:38.350
And Johnny is so smitten
with a young man called Ivan.

00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:43.810
And Ivan is attractive and
friendly but rather slippery.

00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:46.480
When Johnny thinks something
is about to happen with Ivan,

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.829
Ivan sort of wriggles
out of his grasp.

00:14:48.829 --> 00:14:50.620
Anyway, Ivan is going
to come and join them

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:53.022
at the club on this evening.

00:14:53.022 --> 00:14:54.730
Johnny has been rather
slow to understand

00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:59.560
that Ivan is not interested in
people quite as young as him.

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:08.410
So Johnny and Fran
and Una have had

00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:10.140
supper in a Chinese
restaurant in Soho.

00:15:12.659 --> 00:15:13.950
"'So how are we getting there?'

00:15:13.950 --> 00:15:15.900
Johnny said when
they were outside.

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:18.120
He wasn't going to risk
suggesting the bus.

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:20.100
'Taxi,' said Una.

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:21.870
'Or we could take
the Underground.'

00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:24.710
He saw his funds for the
evening running awkwardly thin.

00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:26.150
'It's probably quicker.'

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:30.930
'Oh, the Underground,' Francesca
stood, in apparent indecision,

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:33.780
gazing at a spot a few
yards away on the pavement,

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:36.330
beneath which she seemed
to picture it running.

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:38.020
'Is it still open?'

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:39.350
Johnny looked at his watch.

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:40.950
It was 10 past 10:00.

00:15:40.950 --> 00:15:42.830
'Well, yes,' he said.

00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:46.080
And he saw in a moment the Tube
as perhaps she imagined it,

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:48.710
rather than as he knew
it from frequent use,

00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:52.910
the deep proletarian labyrinth,
the sort of human sewer,

00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:55.800
rumored to underlie
the whole city.

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:58.390
'Oh, but look--' and she ran
a few steps into the road

00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:00.900
and somehow caught the eye of
a taxi driver passing the end

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:04.140
of the street, who backed up
and turned and in 20 seconds was

00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:07.530
taking her instructions
through the open window.

00:16:07.530 --> 00:16:10.230
In the cab, as it swept round
Trafalgar Square and out

00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:13.470
into Pall Mall, Johnny had
the uncomfortable but elated

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:16.220
feeling that his London
life had taken off,

00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:18.690
not how he'd imagined
it, but the unimagined,

00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:22.190
when it happened, had
the bite of authenticity.

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:24.140
The women traveled side by side.

00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:26.070
And Johnny sat on
the folding seat

00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:29.200
looking at them and past
them, at the vanishing road

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:33.000
and the lights of the vehicles
surging up or dropping behind.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.500
He still felt hungry.

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:36.780
He'd only had one thing
at the little Chinese.

00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:38.460
And then the bill
was split three ways

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:40.160
and he couldn't protest.

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:41.890
You ate almost in
the kitchen there,

00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:44.400
with the pool splayed
roasted ducks hanging just

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:46.830
above your head like lanterns.

00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:48.420
He pushed down the
window an inch.

00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:49.920
But the throb of
the engine shivered

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:52.350
it shut in two or three seconds.

00:16:52.350 --> 00:16:55.380
Racing backwards towards
his first gay club,

00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:57.960
he felt a little queasy.

00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:00.579
'This is it,' Francesca
shouted to the driver.

00:17:00.579 --> 00:17:02.370
And they stopped at a
narrow white building

00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:04.280
on the Earl's Court Road.

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:06.530
A small queue formed outside.

00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:08.849
And there was a certain
defiance in showing so plainly

00:17:08.849 --> 00:17:10.650
where they were going.

00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:12.151
The cabbie looked out wearily.

00:17:12.151 --> 00:17:14.400
'You don't want to go in
there, love,' he said to Una.

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:15.960
'It's a poofs' place.'

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:18.310
'Yes, we do,' said Una.

00:17:18.310 --> 00:17:20.400
Francesca paid him
and took the change

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:23.210
in full and flapped her
hand in front of her face

00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:27.390
as he drove off in a loud
fart of diesel fumes.

00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:28.860
Ivan was coming
down the other way,

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:31.820
from the Tube station,
his duffel coat unbuttoned

00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:34.590
and the long fringe of
his woollen scarf bobbing

00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:37.140
like a sporran
between his thighs.

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:39.750
'Darling!' said Francesca, so
that Johnny didn't seem to know

00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:42.420
where he was, after all the
cruel things she said about him

00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:43.600
earlier.

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:46.620
Ivan kissed the two girls,
dodged a kiss with Johnny

00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:49.430
by butting his head against
the lapel of his coat.

00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:51.930
Johnny felt the quick
squeeze of tension,

00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:55.837
was anxious and lustful,
watching Ivan unwind his scarf,

00:17:55.837 --> 00:17:58.170
and was drunk enough to put
his arm around his shoulders

00:17:58.170 --> 00:17:59.700
and leave it there.

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:02.450
He seemed as drunk as they
were, and engaged with the girls

00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:05.400
more than with a friend who
was loosely holding him.

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:07.500
'Here we all are
then,' said Francesca,

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:10.050
as they edged a yard
closer to the door.

00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:11.280
She winced at Johnny.

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:14.620
'Sorry about this hideous wait.'

00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:16.470
At last they went
into the narrow space

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:20.160
inside the door, music audible
now, swing doors beyond

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:23.310
like a cinema and a glimpse when
they opened of the bare room

00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:25.370
at the start of a party.

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:28.260
The large man in a bomber
jacket glanced skeptically

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:29.195
at the girls.

00:18:29.195 --> 00:18:31.560
'You know this is a
gay club,' he said.

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:34.200
'We've been here thousands
of times,' said Francesca,

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:36.090
looking wanly past him.

00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:37.610
'So you're lesbians, are you?'

00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:38.340
he said.

00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:40.564
'Don't be vulgar,'
said Francesca.

00:18:40.564 --> 00:18:41.730
'How you going to prove it?'

00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:43.140
said the man.

00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:45.187
Francesca sighed
and looked away,

00:18:45.187 --> 00:18:46.770
as if dealing with
this kind of person

00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:48.820
were quite new indignity.

00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:52.830
Then Una, with a hint of a smile
on her large flawless face,

00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:55.920
pulled her towards her and
with a tilt of the head started

00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:58.740
kissing her with a steady
pushing and chewing

00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:02.160
motion which Francesca,
while taking no active part,

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:04.210
made no effort to prevent.

00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:06.750
Johnny giggled in amazement
and felt a sudden knot

00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:08.310
of excitement that
he and Ivan might

00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:10.080
be made to do the same thing.

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:11.570
'Whoa, whoa,' said the bouncer.

00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:15.090
But it took him another 10
seconds to separate them.

00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:17.400
He looks Johnny and
Ivan up and down.

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:19.800
'Right you are, gentlemen'
he said, and unhitched

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:21.840
the rope for them all.

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:24.030
It turned out you
had to be a member.

00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:27.030
Francesca claimed she was, but
this time couldn't prove it.

00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:29.820
So they all had to sign a list
and give their address, which

00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:31.227
made Johnny uneasy.

00:19:31.227 --> 00:19:33.310
He imagined them getting
in touch with his aunt--"

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:35.390
with whom he's
logging at the time--

00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:37.600
"and he put a different
number in the street.

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:39.250
It cost 50p each.

00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:41.730
'And of course you get your
meal,' said the little Irish

00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:43.630
boy in the lit cubbyhole.

00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:45.660
Then it was 10p to
leave your coat.

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:48.240
'Should we put ours together,
said Johnny, save money?'

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:51.110
But Ivan said, 'No, it's OK.'"

00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:53.025
They go to the club,
they get drinks.

00:19:56.010 --> 00:20:00.560
Johnny excitedly, anxiously
checks the place out,

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:04.560
then goes off to buy
some more drinks.

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:06.630
"When Johnny got back
to the table, a fat,

00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:09.150
middle-aged man with a
tray was hovering there.

00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:12.780
'It's your salads,' he said,
and started unload little bowls

00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:14.415
among the bottles and glasses.

00:20:14.415 --> 00:20:18.360
Oh, god,' said Francesca.
'I'm not hungry,' said Ivan.

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:19.070
'It's all free.

00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:22.290
It comes with your membership,'
said the man, smiling firmly.

00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:24.510
'We've already eaten,'
said Francesca.

00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:26.550
'It's just your
salads,' he said,

00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:29.220
as if a salad were a medicine,
and with the air of someone

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:31.650
used to resistance, for
all his pleasantness.

00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:32.960
'You've got to have them.'

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:36.720
He put down four forks
wrapped in paper napkins.

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:39.060
Johnny peered into the
bowls, which each contained

00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:41.760
a bit of iceberg lettuce,
a ring of tomato,

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:46.770
and almost hidden, unnamable,
a glistening square of meat.

00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:49.530
He sat down when the man
moved on to the next table

00:20:49.530 --> 00:20:50.619
and unwrapped a fork.

00:20:50.619 --> 00:20:52.410
'Well, I didn't know
we got this,' he said.

00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:54.060
'Don't eat it,' said Una.

00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:55.560
'No?' said Johnny.

00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:57.310
'It's the licensing
law,' said Ivan.

00:20:57.310 --> 00:20:59.170
'They have to serve a meal.'

00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:02.280
This seemed to Johnny both
absurd and quite fortunate.

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:05.430
He was more hungry now than he'd
been before dinner and food was

00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:09.240
here, the shameful stopgap
of the boozing student.

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:10.840
'Well, doesn't look too bad.'

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:12.570
And with the others
gazing at him,

00:21:12.570 --> 00:21:15.510
and then thinking it better
to resume their conversation,

00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:18.430
he ate his lettuce and tomato,
there was no dressing on it,

00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:21.960
and popped in the pink-grey
tongue-sized piece of meat.

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:24.150
Which he chewed
uncertainly, thinking it

00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:27.340
was probably ham,
prepacked, sweaty,

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:29.010
and with a knot of
gristle in it he

00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:30.920
had to bring out behind
his hand and hide

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:33.360
in the bowl under his
screwed up napkin.

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:36.540
It was dismaying, and connected
in a momentary violence

00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:40.020
of image with the glazed
squashed ducks earlier.

00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:42.310
Sometimes meat disgusted him.

00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:45.520
He took a swig from
his cold beer bottle.

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:47.730
Ivan raised an eyebrow
into his fringe

00:21:47.730 --> 00:21:50.070
and gestured to his own bowl.

00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:51.210
'Have mine,' he said.

00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:52.980
'No thanks,' said Johnny.

00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:55.980
'Or, well, actually--' and
switching the two bowls,

00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:57.430
he ate Ivan's salad too.

00:21:57.430 --> 00:21:59.670
It only took a minute,
smiling defiantly

00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:02.130
as he chewed and thought of
other things of Ivan's he'd

00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:03.306
like.

00:22:03.306 --> 00:22:05.100
And when that was
done, the thing

00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:07.650
with the force now of
some future anecdote,

00:22:07.650 --> 00:22:11.550
he pulled Una's salad towards
him, and polished it off.

00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:12.220
He rested.

00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:15.930
He felt some natural deferences
as he looked at Francesca.

00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:16.800
Then he smirked.

00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:18.465
And she said, 'What?

00:22:18.465 --> 00:22:22.620
Oh, go on,' waving her hand over
the bowl as she turned her head

00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:26.784
in mingled amusement
and disgust."

00:22:26.784 --> 00:22:27.756
Thank you.

00:22:27.756 --> 00:22:30.672
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:35.030
SPEAKER 1: We're going to
open it up to questions now.

00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:37.670
I guess I'll just kick off the
discussion with a question.

00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:39.200
I was wondering
if you could talk

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:42.290
more about your inspiration
for this novel and the choice

00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:46.100
to center it around a sex
scandal that reverberates

00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:47.924
over seven decades.

00:22:47.924 --> 00:22:49.590
ALAN HOLLINGHURST:
Well I think that was

00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:58.610
one of the ideas of the early
parts of this book and indeed

00:22:58.610 --> 00:23:00.590
for quite a long time afterward.

00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:03.320
If gay life emerged
into the news,

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:07.640
it was generally in
the form of a scandal.

00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:12.170
In a time when
homosexuality was illegal,

00:23:12.170 --> 00:23:18.060
there was something inherently
scandalous about it as a topic.

00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:22.850
So it interested
me to try and write

00:23:22.850 --> 00:23:26.630
not about the scandal, the
mechanics of the scandal

00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:28.820
itself, but about its impact.

00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:37.070
We don't actually learn
about the Sparsholt affair,

00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:41.790
the scandal that David Sparsholt
is involved in until eight

00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:43.810
years after it's happened.

00:23:43.810 --> 00:23:48.550
And I think I rather wanted
to create that sense that one

00:23:48.550 --> 00:23:54.380
has of something which
has been displayed

00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:58.730
to the prurient public and
news media some time ago

00:23:58.730 --> 00:24:02.090
and the details of which
are now rather faded.

00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:05.120
Because Sparsholt is
a very unusual name.

00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:07.790
When people meet young
Johnny eight years later,

00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:11.120
they do a little double take
when they hear who he is.

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:14.870
And they think, oh, you must
be related to David Sparsholt.

00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:18.495
But they can't precisely
remember what happened.

00:24:18.495 --> 00:24:21.330
And I wanted to create
the sense of the scandal

00:24:21.330 --> 00:24:25.460
as a sort of lingering,
slowly fading, stain.

00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:28.650
As it's one which has a
significant gay element in it,

00:24:28.650 --> 00:24:31.840
it's something
which rather presses

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:34.460
on Johnny's own
consciousness as he's

00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:39.530
trying to forge his
way as a an out gay man

00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:43.430
and doing something which,
in his father's case,

00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:50.280
had been very publicly
punished and stigmatized.

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:53.190
So that was certainly
one of the initial ideas.

00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:57.050
Another was getting very
interested in Oxford

00:24:57.050 --> 00:24:59.630
during the war.

00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:01.250
A very dear old
friend of mine, who

00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:03.770
actually died at the
end of last year,

00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:06.650
had been an undergraduate at
Christ Chuch during the war

00:25:06.650 --> 00:25:10.310
and reminisced to
me a lot about it.

00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:14.100
And I thought it was
fascinating that very changed,

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:17.150
the unusual conditions of
that period, very little

00:25:17.150 --> 00:25:18.760
written about.

00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:21.860
The only other novel that I've
come across such in Oxford

00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:25.490
during the Second World
War is an early novel

00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:32.528
by Philip Larkin called
"Jill," which I pirated wildly

00:25:32.528 --> 00:25:37.730
for useful details
when writing this.

00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:41.480
But it's tricky writing
this kind of book.

00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:43.490
And my previous book,
"The Strangest Child,"

00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:47.030
covered an even longer period,
I think nearly 100 years

00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:50.450
starting before
the First World War

00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:59.050
and ending up in
2008 or something.

00:25:59.050 --> 00:26:00.830
I think it's that
the idea of following

00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:04.760
the consequences of actions over
a large period at the same time

00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:09.740
as dramatizing the quite
predictable changes

00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:12.590
and surprises of time.

00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:17.780
As we get older, we
reinterpret the past.

00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:19.760
The workings of
memory, which is really

00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:26.424
a novelist's main resource, I
find more and more fascinating.

00:26:26.424 --> 00:26:28.340
But if you are writing
a book in five episodes

00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:29.714
covering a wide
period, in a way,

00:26:29.714 --> 00:26:33.780
you're starting from five
different starting points.

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:38.615
It's a hard work
way of doing it.

00:26:38.615 --> 00:26:43.376
And it makes me always feel that
I've written five short novels

00:26:43.376 --> 00:26:44.750
in one, each of
which had to have

00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:49.100
its own imaginative genesis,
even though they all link up.

00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:53.360
But they link up
at bleak angles.

00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:55.290
In "The Strangest Child,"
the first section,

00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:59.030
which was set in
1913, just takes place

00:26:59.030 --> 00:27:04.250
over one weekend where some
very ambiguous events happen

00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:07.670
concerning a young poet
who was killed in the war.

00:27:07.670 --> 00:27:10.090
And in a way, all of the later
four sections of the book

00:27:10.090 --> 00:27:15.840
are all glosses on that
initiating weekend.

00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:18.350
In this book I think the
structure's rather different.

00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:24.840
And the sections are connected
to each other more indirectly.

00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:28.280
And both books do
something which interests

00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:32.540
me more and more, which
is avoiding resolution

00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:36.380
and explanation, the sort of
classic model, which I suppose

00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:40.060
is the model of a detective
story or something,

00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:45.142
of a novel enshrining a
secret which is explained just

00:27:45.142 --> 00:27:47.100
before the end, after
which everything suddenly

00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:48.876
makes sense.

00:27:48.876 --> 00:27:53.640
And I think I did do that in
the first two novels I wrote.

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:56.740
But it seems to be increasingly
that life's not like that.

00:27:56.740 --> 00:27:59.700
And actually the experience
of living and getting older

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:02.920
is one in which more and more
things are never understood,

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:05.035
never fully explained.

00:28:05.035 --> 00:28:06.660
So I've been quite
interested in trying

00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:10.500
to create a large
fictional structure

00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:13.110
in which I hope each
part of the narrative

00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:18.610
is seductive and
interesting and amusing

00:28:18.610 --> 00:28:26.360
but which overall doesn't settle
into a clear, resolved shape.

00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:30.550
And it's a risky thing.

00:28:30.550 --> 00:28:36.015
But it does seem
to be worth doing.

00:28:36.015 --> 00:28:38.360
AUDIENCE: In
writing about a book

00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:40.850
that takes place in five
different time periods,

00:28:40.850 --> 00:28:43.230
how do you ensure
that you're faithful

00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:46.790
to the style of
conversation and dialogue

00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:48.390
in each of the
different time periods?

00:28:48.390 --> 00:28:52.670
And how do you also
ensure that whatever

00:28:52.670 --> 00:28:54.660
style you've written
for one era doesn't

00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:56.880
bleed through to
another era in the book?

00:28:59.417 --> 00:29:01.500
ALAN HOLLINGHURST: I worried
about that a lot more

00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:05.910
in "The Strangest Child,"
going back into the pre

00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:08.340
World War period.

00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:12.930
I think the bulk of this book,
with the second section set

00:29:12.930 --> 00:29:18.630
in 1966 when I was 12,
the bulk of the book

00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:21.310
actually happens
during my lifetime

00:29:21.310 --> 00:29:26.550
and during periods where I feel
pretty confident of the idioms

00:29:26.550 --> 00:29:28.160
and so forth.

00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:33.510
The earlier things
require more care.

00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:35.910
I mean, I rely on the
Oxford English dictionary

00:29:35.910 --> 00:29:42.570
online a great deal for finding
when words and usages, phrases

00:29:42.570 --> 00:29:44.925
and so on were first recorded.

00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:53.370
Anachronisms, even if
only evident to a few

00:29:53.370 --> 00:29:55.500
sharp eared people,
spoil things.

00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:58.566
So you've go to to get it right.

00:29:58.566 --> 00:29:59.940
So obviously, you
don't introduce

00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:03.600
any kind of figurative language,
which alludes to things which

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:07.350
would happen after the period.

00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:11.010
If you're writing about periods
before your own lifetime,

00:30:11.010 --> 00:30:13.490
its struck me very much
writing these things set

00:30:13.490 --> 00:30:18.270
in 1913 and 1926 in
my previous book what

00:30:18.270 --> 00:30:19.800
sort of knowledge
of those periods

00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:21.830
is irreducibly literary.

00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:26.980
And my sense of how people
spoke and conducted themselves

00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:29.950
mainly, I suppose, comes from
reading novels written recently

00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:34.690
in that period or seeing perhaps
not completely reliable films

00:30:34.690 --> 00:30:37.950
of them and also
being very interested

00:30:37.950 --> 00:30:40.440
in the literary history, reading
letters and diaries and so

00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:42.060
on of the period.

00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:45.200
And I think I've got
a reasonably good ear

00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:49.230
for the period tone.

00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:54.730
But I very much value detail
editorial scrutiny of it.

00:30:54.730 --> 00:30:57.750
I think I shouldn't have
had done the picking up.

00:31:00.390 --> 00:31:02.820
Anachronisms creep in so easily.

00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:04.790
And you can be quite
mistaken in your belief

00:31:04.790 --> 00:31:07.500
as to when something happened.

00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:09.630
In the draft, the
version of this

00:31:09.630 --> 00:31:12.734
which almost went to print, I
had people being paid in euros

00:31:12.734 --> 00:31:14.400
five years before
euros were introduced.

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:19.280
[INAUDIBLE] They'd
stopped to that point.

00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:22.690
So there's an element
of research in it.

00:31:22.690 --> 00:31:24.480
And often one just Googles it.

00:31:27.275 --> 00:31:30.060
Research is now so easy.

00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:31.740
I always feel it's too easy.

00:31:35.345 --> 00:31:37.170
I think there is a
way that research

00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:39.497
can sort of shriek
research, actually,

00:31:39.497 --> 00:31:41.330
when you're reading a
novel particularly set

00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:42.480
on the historical period.

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:44.910
And I certainly read
historical fiction

00:31:44.910 --> 00:31:47.970
in which everything
that you see is

00:31:47.970 --> 00:31:50.220
described in great detail
in where it came from

00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:51.460
and how much it cost.

00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:54.060
It's obviously someone has
just been researching it.

00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:58.180
But actually, the
superabundance of period detail

00:31:58.180 --> 00:32:01.830
oddly undermines the
naturalness and convincingness

00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:06.600
of the historical account.

00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:09.720
You want to get that sense
of people living in the past

00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:13.890
as we all do, with no
knowledge of the future

00:32:13.890 --> 00:32:15.840
and no sense of how
tremendously quaint

00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:18.400
we're all going to
look in 50 years' time.

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:21.110
And I think that's
something I try to capture

00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:23.310
in writing about the past.

00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:25.110
AUDIENCE: I'd be
curious hearing you

00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:28.530
talk some more about other ways
in which your interests have

00:32:28.530 --> 00:32:33.732
evolved since your first
novel through your career.

00:32:33.732 --> 00:32:34.940
ALAN HOLLINGHURST: Yes, gosh.

00:32:37.790 --> 00:32:39.540
But I can see there's
some interests which

00:32:39.540 --> 00:32:42.085
have remained constant.

00:32:42.085 --> 00:32:44.460
When I set out to write my
first book, "The Swimming Pool

00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:50.130
Library," which I starting
writing on January 1st, 1984,

00:32:50.130 --> 00:32:55.470
I had a very clear idea of
writing a book about gay life

00:32:55.470 --> 00:33:01.530
in England, which I hadn't
noticed anybody else writing.

00:33:01.530 --> 00:33:08.130
And that was then 17 years
off of the Sexual Offenses Act

00:33:08.130 --> 00:33:09.290
had been passed.

00:33:09.290 --> 00:33:13.470
But again, it's an example
of that rather slow grasping

00:33:13.470 --> 00:33:16.680
of the new freedoms
which this represented.

00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:18.810
When I was a graduate
student, I did work

00:33:18.810 --> 00:33:21.280
on gay writers
like E.M. Forster,

00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:23.220
who hadn't been
able to write openly

00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:27.040
about their sexuality in
their work and the effects

00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:29.970
that this might
have had on them.

00:33:29.970 --> 00:33:32.700
And this was a quite
new topic at the time.

00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:37.340
And it's hard to always
re-enter the mental conditions

00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:41.340
of earlier periods and
to remember just what one

00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:42.934
knew and didn't know.

00:33:42.934 --> 00:33:46.230
But certainly
through the 70s there

00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:51.340
was this deepening, widening
interest in gay history

00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:56.070
and a good deal of outing,
sometimes rather wishful,

00:33:56.070 --> 00:33:58.965
outing of figures for the past.

00:33:58.965 --> 00:34:01.200
And it was a fascinating moment.

00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:03.784
And I think I felt part of
that when I started writing

00:34:03.784 --> 00:34:04.950
"The Swimming Pool Library."

00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:09.639
And it was very
determinedly a gay book.

00:34:09.639 --> 00:34:18.350
And it was tremendous fun
to do and rather a risk

00:34:18.350 --> 00:34:19.889
and created a great
deal of anxiety

00:34:19.889 --> 00:34:21.905
on the part of its publishers.

00:34:21.905 --> 00:34:24.914
But happily, it was a success.

00:34:27.770 --> 00:34:30.060
What I wanted to do in that
book, one of the things

00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:32.670
I wanted to do, was just to
write from a gay position

00:34:32.670 --> 00:34:35.120
without any kind of
explanation or apology

00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:38.920
and just to do so as naturally
as most writers write

00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:41.909
from a straight point of view.

00:34:41.909 --> 00:34:45.820
And then I took that
as my basis thereafter.

00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:48.590
But of course, that first
book was about all sorts of--

00:34:48.590 --> 00:34:51.199
it wasn't just about people
being madly gay the whole time.

00:34:51.199 --> 00:34:52.642
It was about them--

00:34:52.642 --> 00:34:54.100
actually, it was
mostly about that.

00:34:56.670 --> 00:35:00.630
But it was full of a
lot of other interests.

00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:06.850
I think I've slowly
broadened the social canvas

00:35:06.850 --> 00:35:09.490
in my third shortest
novel, "The Spell."

00:35:09.490 --> 00:35:11.940
It was a novel about four
gay men and their rather

00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:15.546
complicated interrelations.

00:35:15.546 --> 00:35:19.200
But with "The Line of
Beauty," my fourth book,

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:22.920
I felt I was entering
wider territory.

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:25.080
And it's essentially
about and all seen

00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:27.360
through the eyes
of a young gay man.

00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:30.740
But a lot of the world that he's
moving in is not by any means

00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:32.097
a gay one.

00:35:32.097 --> 00:35:33.930
So I thought he would
be an interesting lens

00:35:33.930 --> 00:35:39.480
on the world of the mid 80s,
the boom years of Mrs. Thatcher

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:43.545
and the conservative
triumph in that period,

00:35:43.545 --> 00:35:47.280
just something which this
clever young man is rather

00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:50.910
slow to really understand.

00:35:50.910 --> 00:35:54.730
And I think with "The Strangest
Child," as I was saying,

00:35:54.730 --> 00:35:55.980
the whole thing has opened up.

00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:58.395
And there's a lot more
time and there's a lot more

00:35:58.395 --> 00:35:59.830
of these big gaps in it.

00:35:59.830 --> 00:36:04.140
And questions of memory become
more and more important.

00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:09.360
And the openly erotic
elements of the book

00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:13.170
are rather less, something
which a lot of reviewers

00:36:13.170 --> 00:36:13.920
complained about.

00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:23.220
And I think those are my
main preoccupations now.

00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:25.710
When "The Line of Beauty" won
the Booker Prize, of course

00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:32.890
it was journalistically
categorized as a gay book.

00:36:32.890 --> 00:36:35.220
"Daily Express"
even said gay sex

00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:41.920
wins Booker, which is a version
of the prize we've yet to see.

00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:45.180
But I think my last two
books haven't really

00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:46.600
been categorized in that way.

00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:48.810
And actually, I
feel that there was

00:36:48.810 --> 00:36:50.980
something which I was part of.

00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:57.960
There was the rise of a
specifically gay literature

00:36:57.960 --> 00:36:59.980
really through the
80s and 90s, when

00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:05.570
they were responding first
of all to liberation and then

00:37:05.570 --> 00:37:09.720
to the great unforeseen
crisis of AIDS and so on

00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:13.020
and the immense
social changes that

00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:16.600
have happened since I started
writing that first book

00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:18.900
and published it
exactly 30 years ago.

00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:25.230
I'm not responding
to the same pressures

00:37:25.230 --> 00:37:29.280
or feeling the urgency of
that material in the way

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:32.080
that I used to.

00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:38.190
It's hard for me in a way
to describe my own progress

00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:40.020
or evolution or whatever it is.

00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:42.300
And it may be something
which is oddly more apparent

00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:44.680
to the reader than it is to me.

00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:48.510
I feel too inside it.

00:37:48.510 --> 00:37:51.120
AUDIENCE: Sometimes when
I speak to younger people,

00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:54.300
I have to remind myself that
no one under the age of 40

00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:57.000
has any significant
memory of Ronald Reagan

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.060
or Margaret Thatcher
or the Soviet Union

00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:01.380
or any of the things
that many of us

00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:04.140
would consider fundamental.

00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:10.980
I'm wondering about your
reactions and observations

00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:16.110
about younger
people who were born

00:38:16.110 --> 00:38:18.140
pretty much after the whole--

00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:20.430
well, certainly well
after the Sexual Offenses

00:38:20.430 --> 00:38:25.020
Act-- but after much of
the revolution in attitudes

00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:30.600
towards homosexuality and all
of the activism everything

00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:32.610
else that was required
to bring that about.

00:38:32.610 --> 00:38:35.340
But certainly
younger people really

00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:38.650
have no personal experience
of that, and in a sense,

00:38:38.650 --> 00:38:41.040
I would think grow up in
a world with fundamentally

00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:42.300
different attitudes.

00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:47.100
And I'm wondering how you
experience that and see

00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:48.900
that when you talk
to younger people.

00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:52.260
And do they respond to your
books in a different way?

00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:55.380
ALAN HOLLINGHURST:
They probably do, yes.

00:38:55.380 --> 00:38:58.140
I'm very struck by it myself.

00:38:58.140 --> 00:39:00.840
I remember when the film of "The
Line of Beauty" was being made

00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:04.300
and young Dan Stevens had to
dance with Kika Markham playing

00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:05.440
Mrs. Thatcher.

00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:09.030
He really didn't have any
knowledge of Mrs. Thatcher.

00:39:13.170 --> 00:39:15.530
We'd moved on so far.

00:39:15.530 --> 00:39:21.710
And I think, yes, the lack of
a consciousness of the AIDS

00:39:21.710 --> 00:39:24.560
crisis is one which strikes
people of my generation

00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:26.310
very forcibly.

00:39:26.310 --> 00:39:30.500
And young people generally
are awfully rather astounded

00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:33.410
when you tell them about it.

00:39:33.410 --> 00:39:37.220
And the medical situation
is so different now.

00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:40.140
There seems to be
an alarming increase

00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:43.080
in the uptake of sexually
transmitted diseases

00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:44.495
and so on amongst young people.

00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:51.340
On the other hand,
one doesn't want

00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:55.337
them to be burdened with this.

00:39:55.337 --> 00:39:56.920
I think the whole
question of learning

00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:59.620
about the history of your own
kind if you're a gay person

00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:01.520
is a very fascinating one.

00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:04.270
And it sort of was the
model for my first book,

00:40:04.270 --> 00:40:06.110
"The Swimming Pool
Library," in a way,

00:40:06.110 --> 00:40:07.480
which was a pre-AIDS book.

00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:16.130
But the 25-year-old narrator
falls in with this much older

00:40:16.130 --> 00:40:17.330
man, a man in his 80s.

00:40:17.330 --> 00:40:21.270
And by reading his journals,
he makes his little visits

00:40:21.270 --> 00:40:25.000
into gay life in early
periods of the century.

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.810
And it gives him the
opportunity to learn some

00:40:28.810 --> 00:40:33.220
of the history of his own kind.

00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:35.050
And I think it's
one reason that I've

00:40:35.050 --> 00:40:40.600
been quite interested in
writing books in which there are

00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:47.170
strong intergenerational
relationships between older

00:40:47.170 --> 00:40:51.490
and younger men, the older
man often acting as a mentor

00:40:51.490 --> 00:40:54.460
or educator of the young
one, who may in turn act

00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:59.250
as a refresher to the older one.

00:41:03.244 --> 00:41:04.910
I'm so far out of the
world of education

00:41:04.910 --> 00:41:10.130
that I don't know to what extent
the history of the gay movement

00:41:10.130 --> 00:41:14.360
and so on would figure in an
ordinary secondary education

00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:15.680
today.

00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:18.380
Perhaps not much.

00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:26.780
It's very good in a way, that
in large areas of our culture,

00:41:26.780 --> 00:41:29.750
it's rather cool
too big to be queer.

00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:31.375
It's a subject which
never stays still.

00:41:31.375 --> 00:41:35.130
And that's one of the things
that fascinates me about it.

00:41:35.130 --> 00:41:38.900
And so rather than
defining themselves

00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:41.240
as we used to in the
past, there seems

00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:45.260
to be so much more elasticity
about the idea of sexuality

00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:46.310
now.

00:41:46.310 --> 00:41:49.790
And I think that's, perhaps
in a way, been reflected

00:41:49.790 --> 00:41:52.820
in what I've been writing myself
and being much more interested

00:41:52.820 --> 00:41:56.990
in sexual ambiguities.

00:41:56.990 --> 00:42:00.860
Una and I have got young
friends in their 20s

00:42:00.860 --> 00:42:03.920
who call themselves non-binary.

00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:06.500
I grope-- that's perhaps
not the right word--

00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:16.080
grapple slightly with
these new subcategories.

00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:22.370
That's rather ideal in a way, if
there's this degree of freedom

00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:26.745
to explore your sexuality.

00:42:26.745 --> 00:42:28.870
I gave you a rather rambly
answer to your question.

00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:35.000
I find myself as a novelist
repeatedly drawn back

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:38.180
to these earlier
periods when being gay

00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:41.440
was more challenging
in social, legal terms.

00:42:45.220 --> 00:42:48.859
But I would far
rather be living now.

00:42:48.859 --> 00:42:50.650
I'm very conscious,
too, that one is always

00:42:50.650 --> 00:42:54.640
speaking about this western,
in my case, generally

00:42:54.640 --> 00:43:01.660
metropolitan culture and that
in other parts of the world,

00:43:01.660 --> 00:43:04.750
things are not getting
better for anybody

00:43:04.750 --> 00:43:07.120
who wants to explore their
sexuality but dramatically

00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:08.100
worse.

00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:13.430
And I have a number of friends
from equatorial Africa,

00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:15.700
for instance, who've
had to flee from Uganda

00:43:15.700 --> 00:43:22.660
or Cameroon for their lives and
whose efforts to do anything

00:43:22.660 --> 00:43:25.030
to protect the rights
of sexual minorities

00:43:25.030 --> 00:43:28.490
in those countries have
led to intimidation,

00:43:28.490 --> 00:43:30.280
violence, and so forth.

00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:32.025
Through a lot of
Eastern Europe, there

00:43:32.025 --> 00:43:33.610
are similar things going on.

00:43:33.610 --> 00:43:38.500
And I think we feel in a
period of political reaction

00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:43.120
like this, all those hard
won freedoms of the past

00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:45.670
might themselves, again,
come under attack.

00:43:48.460 --> 00:43:51.640
So in that sense, an
education in this history

00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:56.160
will be doubly valuable
for the young people.

00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:57.660
AUDIENCE: I wonder
if you could talk

00:43:57.660 --> 00:44:03.420
a bit more about how you arrived
at the structure of this novel.

00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:05.700
Was it always five stories?

00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:09.420
Or did things change from
your original conception of it

00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:10.254
as you worked on it?

00:44:10.254 --> 00:44:12.461
ALAN HOLLINGHURST: It was
a bit harder in the shaping

00:44:12.461 --> 00:44:14.150
than anything I'd
done before, actually.

00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:18.970
And I think I did have a desire
to write something slimmer.

00:44:18.970 --> 00:44:22.465
I'm absolutely dying
to write a short novel.

00:44:22.465 --> 00:44:24.340
I just don't seem to
have a short novel in me

00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:25.280
unfortunately.

00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:31.130
I was reluctant
to first replicate

00:44:31.130 --> 00:44:33.190
the five part structure.

00:44:33.190 --> 00:44:38.370
But I arrived at it
after some struggle.

00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:46.020
I didn't start writing chapter
as it were until I had,

00:44:46.020 --> 00:44:48.640
I never do, until I had the
sense of the whole thing.

00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:51.610
So by that stage, I'm pretty
clear about the structure.

00:44:51.610 --> 00:44:53.910
And it's hard for
me now to retrace

00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:59.640
exactly the different stages
of decision or the indecision

00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:02.670
around the planning of the book.

00:45:06.372 --> 00:45:07.830
I knew there would
be the war time.

00:45:11.980 --> 00:45:16.180
I would only be
waffling if I tried

00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:22.390
to say exactly how the plans
finally fitted together.

00:45:25.291 --> 00:45:27.790
I knew I wanted it to turn in
a way at the end which perhaps

00:45:27.790 --> 00:45:29.610
my books generally haven't.

00:45:29.610 --> 00:45:34.420
And I think this book has a
more open and even optimistic

00:45:34.420 --> 00:45:35.830
ending to it.

00:45:35.830 --> 00:45:40.990
Normally I enjoy exercising
the novelist prerogative

00:45:40.990 --> 00:45:44.260
to push his characters off a
cliff at the end of the book

00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:48.230
or to plunge them into
some deep uncertainty.

00:45:48.230 --> 00:45:52.829
But this I think he has a
more benign ending to it.

00:45:52.829 --> 00:45:54.370
And the last two
sections of the book

00:45:54.370 --> 00:45:59.410
are called Losses,
which is reflects

00:45:59.410 --> 00:46:01.850
that period in everyone's
life when suddenly you're

00:46:01.850 --> 00:46:05.033
going to as many funerals
as you are parties.

00:46:05.033 --> 00:46:07.290
But the last section
is called Consolations.

00:46:07.290 --> 00:46:12.340
And it moves into a
further age of slightly

00:46:12.340 --> 00:46:19.890
surprising new possibilities
of happiness and so forth.

00:46:19.890 --> 00:46:21.510
And I can't quite
remember when that--

00:46:21.510 --> 00:46:24.280
I think that was quite a later
idea that it would actually

00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:27.220
end more gently.

00:46:27.220 --> 00:46:29.320
AUDIENCE: So that last
comment intrigued me,

00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:32.410
because you said that in
your more recent books

00:46:32.410 --> 00:46:35.920
you've wanted to
have more ambiguity.

00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:38.950
But it sounds like
you've seen also this one

00:46:38.950 --> 00:46:44.800
and has a more benign ending.

00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:46.430
Do you think that's related?

00:46:46.430 --> 00:46:51.220
That because there's more
ambiguity in the story

00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:52.870
that also you felt
freer to leave

00:46:52.870 --> 00:46:55.690
the people in a happier place?

00:46:55.690 --> 00:46:57.670
ALAN HOLLINGHURST:
Possibly, yes.

00:46:57.670 --> 00:47:02.820
Yes, there are so many
uncertainties about the book.

00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:06.130
Nothing it in I think is simple.

00:47:06.130 --> 00:47:09.550
I wanted to create an
image of everybody's lives

00:47:09.550 --> 00:47:14.110
being lived eventually in terms
of some kind of compromise,

00:47:14.110 --> 00:47:18.010
adjustment to what has happened,
making the most of what

00:47:18.010 --> 00:47:24.940
you can, dealing with a
life changing scandal,

00:47:24.940 --> 00:47:27.310
dealing with the
loss of loved ones.

00:47:30.082 --> 00:47:33.040
And Johnny himself,
I didn't want

00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:38.470
him to be an exemplary
heroic artist battling

00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:40.260
against philistines
or something.

00:47:40.260 --> 00:47:42.380
He actually is doing
this strange thing

00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:45.790
of being a portrait painter,
where he can obviously

00:47:45.790 --> 00:47:48.580
deploy his own skills and
instincts as an artist

00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:53.800
but is also necessarily working
to please the people who are

00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:55.440
sitting for him, paying him.

00:47:55.440 --> 00:48:00.330
So it's a strange compromise
form of artistic activity.

00:48:03.310 --> 00:48:08.855
So everything is sort of
qualified and complicated.

00:48:08.855 --> 00:48:10.925
I think that was the
sense I hoped to convey.

00:48:10.925 --> 00:48:13.300
SPEAKER 1: Thanks very much
again, everybody, for coming.

00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:16.130
And thank you so much, Alan,
for talking to us today.

00:48:16.130 --> 00:48:16.790
ALAN HOLLINGHURST:
It's been a pleasure.

00:48:16.790 --> 00:48:17.560
Thank you.

00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:20.910
[APPLAUSE]
