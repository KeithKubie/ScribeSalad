00:00:04.222 --> 00:00:05.430
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hi, everyone.

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:06.370
I'm Timothy Jordan.

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:07.410
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: And
I'm Natalie Villalobos.

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.993
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And we're here
at the Grace Hopper Celebration

00:00:09.993 --> 00:00:11.360
of Women in Computing 2017.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.300
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
In Orlando, Florida.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:12.750
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's right.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.970
And we're going to talk to some
people about their experience

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:15.750
here at the conference.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:16.110
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Awesome.

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:16.830
I'm really excited about it.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:17.788
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Me too.

00:00:17.788 --> 00:00:19.374
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:19.374 --> 00:00:20.790
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
We're sitting here

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.700
with Avni Shah, a VP of
Product Management at Google.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:24.279
Hi, Avni.

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:24.862
AVNI SHAH: Hi.

00:00:24.862 --> 00:00:26.050
Thanks for having me.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:27.633
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
Thanks for being here.

00:00:27.633 --> 00:00:30.030
So we're at Grace Hopper,
the Celebration of Women

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.110
in Computing, and you just had a
panel about product management,

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.924
and it was awesome.

00:00:33.924 --> 00:00:35.340
I was hoping we
could share, like,

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.881
a little taste of
that with everybody

00:00:36.881 --> 00:00:38.267
out there on the internets.

00:00:38.267 --> 00:00:40.350
AVNI SHAH: Product management
is a unique position

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.912
because I think
it differs from--

00:00:42.912 --> 00:00:44.370
it could differ
from the PM sitting

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.460
across the hall from you,
from the PM down the hall.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.400
And I remember my first
few months at Google,

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.190
Google Groups was going
through this major redesign.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.860
And the team was working all
weekend for this launch that

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.420
was coming up on Monday.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.400
And it was Sunday
afternoon and the team

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.940
was looking pretty tired,
and the PM, Adrian,

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.860
in the afternoon at some point
left for about 45 minutes,

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.030
and he came back and he
had these like armloads

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.905
of sandwiches because
clearly the team hadn't

00:01:09.905 --> 00:01:11.582
eaten in a really long time.

00:01:11.582 --> 00:01:13.290
And so he's handing
out these sandwiches,

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.050
and I hear this
engineer at his desk

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.701
from behind me say, oh,
so that's what PMs do.

00:01:20.701 --> 00:01:22.700
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: They
go to Togo's or Subway.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:23.950
AVNI SHAH: And get sandwiches.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.650
And what stuck
with me then, which

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.700
was really interesting and I've
learned since is that, I mean,

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.450
clearly, we don't just
deliver sandwiches.

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.210
But PMs kind of have to
do whatever it takes.

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.060
Whether it's keeping
the team happy and fed,

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.820
or planning roadmaps,
or hiring people,

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.070
or setting a vision,
or kind of the more

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.615
typical PM-type things.

00:01:42.615 --> 00:01:43.440
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
Basically doing

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.090
whatever you need to
do to be successful.

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.715
AVNI SHAH: Yep.

00:01:45.715 --> 00:01:46.910
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:48.410
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
Tell us a little bit

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.494
about what it's like to
be here at the conference.

00:01:50.494 --> 00:01:51.660
AVNI SHAH: It is incredible.

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.880
So last year was my first
year at Grace Hopper,

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.710
and I did not know
what to expect.

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.070
Like, just seeing the masses
of women here and how they--

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.530
just like this palpable
energy in the air

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.100
that's just kind of incredible.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.110
And people speaking about
very, very different domains

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:09.810
of expertise.

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.670
So like there are panels
on artificial intelligence

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:13.469
and chip design.

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:15.260
It's just, it's kind
of all over the place.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.470
And just seeing people
connecting with each other

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.130
and being able to learn and
having a community of people

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.281
that are here, it's just--

00:02:23.281 --> 00:02:24.155
it's kind of amazing.

00:02:24.155 --> 00:02:25.820
It's like nothing
I've ever seen.

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.050
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Do you
think it's valuable for men

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.550
to be here?

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:28.594
And if so, why?

00:02:28.594 --> 00:02:29.510
AVNI SHAH: Absolutely.

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:30.290
And I--

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.680
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yes.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:31.752
AVNI SHAH: It's great--

00:02:31.752 --> 00:02:33.110
yes, thank you for being here.

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.790
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.040
AVNI SHAH: I think it's great.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.414
I think it's great
on both sides.

00:02:36.414 --> 00:02:38.530
I think on the one
side, it's great for men

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.570
to hear what women
go through and just

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.640
to, like, be a part
of the conversation.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.080
Also, be able to maybe even
contribute in their own way.

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.850
For women, I think
it's really valuable

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.920
to see that they have
allies across the table.

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.410
If we're really going to
change the culture of how

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.090
women are seen in
computing, it kind of

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.170
has to be from everybody.

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:58.535
We can't do it from just us.

00:02:58.535 --> 00:03:01.260
And so having the male
allies, as you said,

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.380
is pretty critical
to the journey.

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.780
So seeing, like, 1,000
men here, it just

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.550
reinforces that
the change is going

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:08.780
to happen from both sides.

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:09.500
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: And
I think Grace Hopper

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:10.800
is going to continue to grow.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.130
I think even though this
is our biggest year yet,

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.839
I think more, as more and
more women come into tech,

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:18.005
we're going to see more and
more women participating

00:03:18.005 --> 00:03:18.690
in Grace Hopper.

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.577
And Grace Hopper's been
happening I think--

00:03:20.577 --> 00:03:22.910
Anita Borg Institute has been
around for about, I think,

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.340
30 years, and I think Grace
Hopper has been around

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.810
for maybe a little bit less.

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.870
And so I think it
humbly started from 500.

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.434
So to go from 500 to,
like, almost 20,000,

00:03:33.434 --> 00:03:34.850
and I feel like
we're just getting

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.577
started in a lot of ways,
feels really exciting

00:03:37.577 --> 00:03:38.910
and is really invigorating, too.

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.250
TIMOTHY JORDAN: You know,
another thing that I've noticed

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.430
is I've heard you talk a lot
about visibility of women

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.670
in technology and how that's
so important for other women

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.262
to enter into technology
and to see the technology.

00:03:49.262 --> 00:03:50.720
I think one of the
things that I've

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.386
realized at this
conference is it's also

00:03:52.386 --> 00:03:55.850
really important for male allies
to be at a conference like this

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.670
and see just like the
enormous amount of women

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.605
leaders and people that we can
follow in technology as well.

00:04:02.605 --> 00:04:04.546
And so that's been just
really exciting to go

00:04:04.546 --> 00:04:06.170
to all these sessions
I'm super excited

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.490
about and to have it
be not always people

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:11.474
that just look like me.

00:04:11.474 --> 00:04:12.890
And that's a little
bit of what it

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:15.890
was like to be here at the Grace
Hopper Celebration of Women

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:17.679
in Computing 2017.

00:04:17.679 --> 00:04:19.220
Natalie, is there
anything else you'd

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.230
like to tell our
audience before we go?

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:22.850
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Definitely
come to Grace Hopper next year.

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.520
There's going to be even more
incredible women in computing.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.980
