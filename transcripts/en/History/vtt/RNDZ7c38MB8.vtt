00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:03.930
ROBBIE: Let's check it.

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:04.970
How you doing?
DAN: Alright.

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:06.130
ROBBIE: You Dan or Rob?

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:07.330
DAN: I'm Dan.
ROBBIE: How you doing?

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:08.470
FRANK: Dan, how you doing?
I'm Frank.

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:09.470
DAN: Hey, Frank.

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:10.470
FRANK: Is your
brother Rob around?

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:11.530
DAN: Yeah, he's over
in the building.

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:12.730
FRANK: Can we go see him?
DAN: Yeah.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:14.000
FRANK: Wow, it's a big place.
DAN: Rob!

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.330
ROBBIE: Rob.
FRANK: How you doing, my friend?

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.770
ROBBIE: Nice to see you.
Rob Wolfe.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.300
FRANK: So you've been talking
to Danielle a little bit?

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.070
ROB: Danny talked to her
and I'm disappointed.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.400
Why'd they send
you twinkies for?

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.530
I thought she was coming.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:24.300
ROBBIE: Hey,
aren't I as good-looking?

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.870
ROB: No.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:27.330
This is chronic disappointment.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.600
FRANK: I'll tell you what we
did bring, Benjamin Franklins.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.470
ROB: Well, I tell ya,
we're a high-volume,

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.970
low-quality place here.
FRANK: Oh, yeah?

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.170
ROB: We got a lot of stuff,
so...

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.730
FRANK: Buy high, sell low?
ROBBIE: Wow.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.070
ROB: No, just
buy low, sell low.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.470
ROB: In cow poop...

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.100
there might be a
little piece of corn.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.500
ROB: That's a
neat wall-hanger.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.430
ROB: We pick the corn
out of the cow poop.

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.600
FRANK: Hey, Rob.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.500
What about this lovely item?
ROB: Yeah.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.370
FRANK: So this
would be a display.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:50.500
It would just sit up,
have a little peg,

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.700
it'd sit up on the top here.
Something you'd sell?

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.770
ROB: It's definitely for sale,
Frank, if it's something you...

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.000
FRANK: $200.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.600
ROB: You know what, it's
gonna be a long day, Frank.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.530
I'm gonna let you have it,
'cause I'm afraid you're

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.270
gonna run out of money.
FRANK: So, 200?

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.070
ROB: Yeah, 200, but...
FRANK: Alright.

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:04.170
ROB: But don't stop now.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.570
ROBBIE: I gotta hand it
to Rob and Dan--

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.030
this stuff came to them as trash
and they saw it as treasure.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.330
FRANK: So, Rob, what's up
with this Texaco sign here?

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:11.630
ROB: Frank,
I don't think it's...

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.370
It's not a legitimate...

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.430
Uh, I think someone painted it,
is what I'm saying.

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.030
FRANK: Oh, you think
it's a fantasy piece?

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.600
ROB: Yeah, I think somebody
painted it and made it--

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.900
they did a nice job.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.900
The best part is,
it could be yours.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.830
FRANK: That's the best part?
ROB: That's the best part.

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.900
FRANK: Since it's not
a real sign, but it is--

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.000
does display well...
ROB: Yeah.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.530
FRANK: $150.

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.270
ROB: I think $200
would be better.

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:33.300
FRANK: $200?

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.570
If it was real,
I'd give you 300.

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:35.800
ROB: How about the 175?

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.070
I know that's
where you're going.

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.170
FRANK: You've been
around the block a while.

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.430
ROB: No, no, I haven't.
FRANK: Let's do it.

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:40.600
ROB: This is
the very first time.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.400
FRANK: Oh, yeah.
ROB: Most people have a plan.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.730
They work, and they invest,
and they're going to retire.

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:49.100
And I think deep down
maybe that was the plan,

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.370
but...
DAN: Yeah.

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.530
ROB: ...part of that plan,
to execute it properly,

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.000
is you gotta sell.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000
FRANK: Oh, thanks.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.170
ROB: There you go.
There's your baby.

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.670
ROBBIE: Man, I'll tell you what,
it's been a great day!

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.170
ROB: And you know, I'll tell
you something about having crap,

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.500
when someone like, you know, Rob
and Frank come and look at it,

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.800
it gives you a little,
a little...

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:05.970
DAN: A little validation.

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.270
ROB: A little validation,
a little 'atta-boy.

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.730
"Oh, man, they liked it too!
Well, maybe I'm not crazy!"

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:11.730
FRANK: We could
come back in a week,

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.970
and still not see stuff
that we didn't see today.

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.270
ROB: You think they had fun?

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:16.630
I mean, they saw a lot of stuff

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.570
and they seemed
to appreciate it.

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.100
FRANK: See you later, guys!
Take care now!

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.330
ROBBIE: Thanks!
DAN: Later.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.670
