00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.790
We're told to list in order from
smallest to largest. So

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.290
each of these quantities, it
looks like we have expressions

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.420
inside of absolute
value signs.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.320
And just as a bit of review,
absolute value just means your

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.880
distance from 0.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.040
Or another way to think about
it is, if it's a negative

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.290
number inside of the
absolute value

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:19.470
sign, it becomes positive.

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.800
If it's already positive,
it stays positive.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.590
So let's think about
these numbers.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:29.020
So the first one is the
absolute value of 5.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.890
How far is 5 away from 0?

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.440
Well, it's 5 away from 0.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.900
So it's equal to 5.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.160
So I were to actually
draw a number line,

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.610
you would see that.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.240
0 is here, 5 is over
here, this distance

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.440
right there is 5.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.230
So the absolute value
of 5 is 5.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.620
Now, the next quantity they want
us to figure out is the

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.590
absolute value of 9 minus 7.

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.540
Well, this is the same thing
as the absolute value of 2.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.190
9 minus 7 is 2.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.099
And once again, 2 is just
2 units away from 0,

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:05.239
so it's just 2.

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.720
If you have a positive value in
the absolute value sign, it

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:08.980
just is itself.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.760
The absolute value of 2 is 2.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:21.500
Then we have the absolute
value of 5 minus 15.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.810
Well, that's going to
be the same thing as

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:23.610
the absolute value.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.660
5 minus 15 is negative 10, so
it's the same thing as the

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.930
absolute value of negative 10.

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.130
Now, there's two ways you
can think about it.

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.210
If it's a negative number inside
of the absolute value

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.560
sign, it just becomes the
positive version of it, so it

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.010
just becomes 10.

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.480
Another way to think about it
is, if you had negative 10,

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.310
you would plot it-- it would
be out here someplace,

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.160
negative 10, we'd have to extend
the number line-- it is

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.120
10 to the left of 0.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.840
That's what the absolute
value is telling us.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.270
Then we have the absolute
value of 0.

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.330
Well, 0 is just 0 away
from the number line.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.220
Absolute value of 0 is just 0.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.270
That is just 0.

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:02.800
That's just right there.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.490
It has no distance
from the origin.

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.340
And then finally, we have the
absolute value of negative 3.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.870
That's 3 to the left of 0, or
you can just think of it as

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.630
getting rid of this negative
sign, so it is equal to 3.

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.820
So, now that we've expressed
them all as just simple

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.120
integers, let's list them in
order from smallest to

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.720
largest.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.670
So of all of these values,
which is the smallest?

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.680
This one is the smallest,
the absolute value of 0.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.050
So let me write that down,
absolute value of 0.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.160
What's the next smallest?

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.860
What's the next one?

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.570
Since we have a 2 there,
this is the next

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.300
smallest, right there.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.870
And that original expression
was the absolute value of 9

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.810
minus 7, so the absolute
value of 9 minus 7.

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.040
And then what's the
next smallest?

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.360
We have this 3, and then
we have a 5 and a 10.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.230
So the next smallest is
this 3, right here.

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.140
That 3, and that original
expression was the absolute

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.390
value of negative 3.

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.460
Then we have this 5 over here,
which is just the absolute

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.630
value of 5.

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.600
And then finally, we have this
10 over here, which was the

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:19.200
absolute value of 5 minus 15.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.530
And we are done.
