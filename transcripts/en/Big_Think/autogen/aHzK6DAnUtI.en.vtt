some of the casualties of the recent
 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.400
some of the casualties of the recent
economic downturn have been students and

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410
economic downturn have been students and
 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.829
economic downturn have been students and
former students who are carrying huge

now these are not the government-backed

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030
now these are not the government-backed
 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.910
now these are not the government-backed
loans that have very low interest rates

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920
loans that have very low interest rates
 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.160
loans that have very low interest rates
these are loans taken out in the private

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170
these are loans taken out in the private
 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.080
these are loans taken out in the private
sector that have much higher interest

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090
sector that have much higher interest
 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.179

rates that students use to top-up the

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189
rates that students use to top-up the
 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.550

now what happened was that students came

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080
now what happened was that students came
 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.290
now what happened was that students came
out of school at a time when jobs were

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300
out of school at a time when jobs were
 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.870
out of school at a time when jobs were
hard to find and incomes were depressed

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880
hard to find and incomes were depressed
 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.870
hard to find and incomes were depressed
or at least not moving up and so the

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880
or at least not moving up and so the
 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.819
or at least not moving up and so the
money that they thought they would have

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829
money that they thought they would have
 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.830
money that they thought they would have
to pay off their student loans wasn't

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840
to pay off their student loans wasn't
 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.330
to pay off their student loans wasn't
there and they were also in an

there and they were also in an
 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.860
there and they were also in an
environment where it was hard for them

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870
environment where it was hard for them
 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.470
environment where it was hard for them
to renegotiate these loans because they

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480
to renegotiate these loans because they
 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.270
to renegotiate these loans because they
didn't look like very good credit risks

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280
didn't look like very good credit risks
 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.299
didn't look like very good credit risks
so a lot of people are stuck with loans

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309
so a lot of people are stuck with loans
 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.400
so a lot of people are stuck with loans
that they simply can't pay at the rates

that they promised to do what should we
do well if we were to forgive some of

do well if we were to forgive some of
 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.689

these loans or have a government program

these loans or have a government program
 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.760
these loans or have a government program
that will help to bail students out then

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770
that will help to bail students out then
 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.160

you could argue that anybody should take

you could argue that anybody should take
 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.959
you could argue that anybody should take
out loans because they needn't worry

somebody would always come to scoop them
 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.880
somebody would always come to scoop them
up and help them to pay and that's a

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890
up and help them to pay and that's a
 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.440
up and help them to pay and that's a
