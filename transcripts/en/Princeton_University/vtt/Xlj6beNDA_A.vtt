MICHAEL HECHT: We knew that in
addition to the Dalai Lama's

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:11.000
visit, there would be monks
coming by ahead of time

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.170
doing a sand mandala, which
is a piece of artwork that

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:17.310
exemplifies this concept
of non-permanence

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.420
and non-attachment.


00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.530
So we decided that one way to
introduce the students to some

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:23.510
of these central
concepts in Buddhism

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.310
would be to have then do a
sand mandala on their own.

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:28.930
And so we coupled
this with the dinners

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.160
that we have of my
house for the freshman.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.180
And so the students
worked on sand paintings

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.580
of Forbes class
of 2018, which is

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.620
something that's central to
their experience, something

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.230
that they might
become attached to,

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.210
but something that is,
after all, impermanent.

NATASHA TURKMANI:
I kind of viewed it

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.430
as a beautiful project in a way.


00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.540
That we're all building this
sense of community together.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.470
That the bond that we created
through making this project

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.830
isn't shown through
the sand, but it's

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.360
shown through our efforts.

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:08.660
DUC NGUYEN: A Geshe, which is
high ranking Tibetan monk came

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.370
to visit Forbes to give a
discussion about the Dalai

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.210
Lama's visit and also about
the tenets of Tibetan Buddhism

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.950
and to also let him see the sand
paintings that the freshman did

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.340
during the Zee Dinners.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.150
DAVID HOYOS: He spoke a little
bit about the sand mandalas

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.220
and their purpose which
really fascinated me.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.760
Because he explained
how these monks,

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.970
they worked so hard,
day in and day out,

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.600
building these sand mandalas.


00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.320
And they get attached
to them but part

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.590
of their responsibility is
to detach themselves from it.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.660
They have to have that
willpower to destroy the sand

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.800
mandala they worked
so hard to make.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.750
That was kind of a
reminder that they

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.120
must be detached the world.


00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.230
And he was saying that this
ties into a Buddhist principle

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:58.670
where pain or suffering,
the root of that is desire

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:59.970
or it is attachment.


00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.480
So if you can relinquish
all attachment

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.210
you reduce a lot of suffering.
