00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.070
For our first train machine example
I've chosen one that tests the oddness

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:06.410
of a binary representation
of a natural number.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.340
Note that I've cheated here
in the transition function

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.180
by including only state
symbol pairs in the domain,

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.750
though we would actually
encounter during computation.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.930
By convention,
if no transition is specified for

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.810
the current state symbol pair Then the
program just halts in the reject state.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.990
One convenient way to represent
the transition function,

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.560
by the way, is with a state diagram.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.369
Similar to what is often used for
finite automata for

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.180
those familiar with that
model of computation.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.550
Each state gets its own
vertex in a multi-graph and

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.600
every row of the transition
table is represented as an edge.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.440
The edge gets labeled with the remaining
information besides the two states.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.630
That is, it gets the symbol read,
followed by an arrow,

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.840
then the symbol to write, and
the direction to move the head.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.763
Now, let's trace through the operation
of this turning machine on this input,

00:01:00.763 --> 00:01:03.050
1, 0, 1, 1.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.740
The head first reads a 1 from the tape,
and we're in the state q0.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.860
So I go up here and
consult the transition table.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.290
And here,
I see that I should follow this edge,

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.510
since that has state q0,
and we read a one.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.930
And this transition tells me
that I should write a 1 or

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.250
leave the table alone, and
move the head to the right.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.740
And change the state to q0.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.530
So let's go ahead and update our figure.

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:31.560
We're still in state q0.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.370
And the position of the head has
been moved one space to the right.

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.650
So this becomes our new configuration.

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.280
And the next step, will be to 0.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.333
Comes up in the transition diagram.

00:01:43.333 --> 00:01:47.012
We see that this means that we
should leave the 0 alone and

00:01:47.012 --> 00:01:49.167
move the head to the right again.

00:01:49.167 --> 00:01:51.333
And stand state to 0.

00:01:51.333 --> 00:01:55.790
We read the 1 from the tape and that
means we follow this transition here and

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.792
move the head to the right again.

00:01:57.792 --> 00:01:59.950
And the next step is similar.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.005
Finally, the head reads a blank symbol.

00:02:02.005 --> 00:02:05.014
The transition table tells us
to write a blank symbol and

00:02:05.014 --> 00:02:07.230
move the head to the left.

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.400
And to switch the state to q1.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.028
Now we read the symbol under the head.

00:02:13.028 --> 00:02:15.290
That's a 1.

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.208
So we follow this transition rule here
and we end up in an accept state.
