00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let me do another quiz.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Suppose that at x1 we see landmark L0 at a distance of 9.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
This gives me a relative constraint between x1, right over here,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and landmark 0, which is over here.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Just like before, these link two things together relatively--the x1's and the L0.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Now this doesn't look like a submatrix, but it is. It's spread a little bit apart.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
But I want you to modify those 4 values in the matrix and those 2 values in the vector

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
to accommodate that we believe that the occasion

00:00:33.000 --> 09:59:59.000
of L0 is 9 greater than the robot position x1.
