who work with the environment is way off
the mark we think there are very close

00:00:11.989 --> 00:00:11.999
the mark we think there are very close

the mark we think there are very close
connections between climate and war and

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080
connections between climate and war and
 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.070
connections between climate and war and
peace and we have seen this in concrete

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080
peace and we have seen this in concrete
 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.400
peace and we have seen this in concrete
action in the Sahel area I mean if you

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410
action in the Sahel area I mean if you
 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.040
action in the Sahel area I mean if you
study the conflict in Darfur in sudan

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050
study the conflict in Darfur in sudan
 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.370
study the conflict in Darfur in sudan
and in the neighborhood countries

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.380
and in the neighborhood countries
 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.040

climate has very much to do with this

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050
climate has very much to do with this
 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.040
climate has very much to do with this
and as we see climate change more

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050
and as we see climate change more
 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.890
and as we see climate change more
globally there is a risk that global

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:36.900
globally there is a risk that global
 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.310
globally there is a risk that global
warming will flood certain areas there

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320
warming will flood certain areas there
 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.040

is a risk that resources will become

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050
is a risk that resources will become
 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.830
is a risk that resources will become
increasingly scarce this will put an

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840
increasingly scarce this will put an
 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.960
increasingly scarce this will put an
added burden and particularly on the

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:47.970
added burden and particularly on the
 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.139
added burden and particularly on the
weakest and most vulnerable of states so

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149
weakest and most vulnerable of states so
 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.030
weakest and most vulnerable of states so
there is unfortunately reason to believe

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.040
there is unfortunately reason to believe
 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.920
there is unfortunately reason to believe
that the global warming will increase

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930
that the global warming will increase

conflicts within and among countries and

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360
conflicts within and among countries and
 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.440
conflicts within and among countries and
the concrete example we offer today is

the concrete example we offer today is
