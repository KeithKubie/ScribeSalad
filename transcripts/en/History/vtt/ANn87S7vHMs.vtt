00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:01.380
Woo!
Hit it!

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:02.710
Hit--
[thud]

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:03.620
[rattling]

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:05.290
[laughter]

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:07.540
ERIC LADIN: When you step into
a team for the first time,

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.620
they're clocking you to
see what they can trust.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:11.880
You're rolling
with [inaudible] now.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.790
ERIC LADIN: You're
clocking them,

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.380
because what we're asked to do
is a matter of life and death.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:19.330
My name is Eric Ladin.

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.080
I play Trevor Wozniak.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.670
There's only one kill I have.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:23.750
I don't need a
picture, remember?

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:24.710
Yeah.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:25.580
Which one?

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.170
My first.

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.670
I remember every line
on the guy's face.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.920
ERIC LADIN: Like any of these
guys, Trevor sees things,

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.670
does things that he has to
find a way to deal with.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.670
And so he uses ink.

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.580
These guys right here?

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.080
All the past 10.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.040
You keep track.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.920
Oh, come on.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.670
Like you don't?

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.750
ERIC LADIN: He knows what each
one of those skulls represent.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.500
I think Trevor fits
in great in the sense

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.540
that he's an operator.

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.250
[gunfire]

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.580
Whether or not they agree with
his point of view on things--

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:04.920
TREVOR: Indian country.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:05.960
What the hell are
you talking about now?

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.790
I'm talking about Truman, man.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.120
--that's a different thing.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.040
They're the guys.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.210
They're loyal.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.620
But me, I see things clearly.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.210
ERIC LADIN: He crosses
the line a little bit

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.460
to see how somebody
else is going to react.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.460
I remember you
from [inaudible]..

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.960
Oh, yeah, you're
the terrorist SEAL.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.540
ERIC LADIN: And so he
messes with Fishbait.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.210
Islam is just compatible
with life, liberty,

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.880
and the pursuit of happiness.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.620
Do I think Trevor believes
many of the things he says?

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.290
Absolutely.

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.290
If I tattooed you with
every guy I've killed,

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.080
I'd run out of skin.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.880
ERIC LADIN: But do I think he
says it in a way to see if he

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.080
can get a rise out of Fish?

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.710
For sure.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.540
You got, uh, any theories
on my kind you want to add?

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.620
No, man.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.000
I love brown people.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.500
Come on!

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.580
I think he's testing
people's mental strength.

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.290
At the end of the day,
the men in that room

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.330
need to be most confident
about you as an operator

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:55.170
when you step out.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.580
[gunfire]

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.460
[grunt]

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.830
And there's no question
that Trevor's an operator.

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.830
Might as well see
what happens next.
