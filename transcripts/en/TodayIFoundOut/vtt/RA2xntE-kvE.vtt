00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:03.419
When People Started Wearing Clothes

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.700
Determining exactly when humans began wearing
clothes is a challenge, largely because early

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.420
clothes would have been things like animal
hides, which degrade rapidly.

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.340
Therefore, there’s very little archaeological
evidence that can be used to determine the

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.589
date that clothing started being worn.

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:21.169
There have been several different theories
based on what archaeologists have been able

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:22.169
to find.

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:26.890
For instance, based on genetic skin-coloration
research, humans lost body hair around one

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.029
million years ago—an ideal time to start
wearing clothes for warmth.

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:36.489
The first tools used to scrape hides date
back to 780,000 years ago, but animal hides

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:41.129
served other uses, such as providing shelter,
and it’s thought that those tools were used

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.250
to prepare hides for that, rather than clothing.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.510
Eyed needles started appearing around 40,000
years ago, but those tools point to more complex

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.410
clothing, meaning clothes had probably already
been around for a while.

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.920
All that being said, scientists have started
gathering alternative data that might help

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.730
solve the mystery of when we humans started
covering our bits.

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:06.580
A recent University of Florida study concluded
that humans started wearing clothes some 170,000

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.520
years ago, lining up with the end of the second-to-last
ice age.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.190
How did they figure that date out?

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.340
By studying the evolution of lice.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.440
Scientists observed that clothing lice are,
well, extremely well-adapted to clothing.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.570
They hypothesized that body lice must have
evolved to live in clothing, which meant that

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.680
they weren’t around before humans started
wearing clothes.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.110
The study used DNA sequencing of lice to calculate
when clothing lice started to genetically

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.750
split from head lice.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.590
The findings of the study are significant
because they show that clothes appeared some

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.690
70,000 years before humans started to migrate
north from Africa into cooler climates.

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.020
The invention of clothing was probably one
factor that made migration possible.

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.180
This timing also makes sense due to known
climate factors in that era.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.100
As Ian Gilligan, a lecturer at the Australian
National University, said that the study gave

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.450
“an unexpectedly early date for clothing,
much earlier than the earliest solid archaeological

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.630
evidence, but it makes sense.

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.300
It means modern humans probably started wearing
clothes on a regular basis to keep warm when

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.539
they were first exposed to Ice Age conditions.”

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:15.290
As to when humans moved on from animal hides
and into textiles, the first fabric is thought

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.810
to have been an early ancestor of felt.

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.720
From there, early humans took up weaving some
27,000 years ago, based on impressions of

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.390
baskets and textiles on clay.

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:31.330
Around 25,000 years ago, the first Venus figurines—little
statues of women—appeared wearing a variety

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.340
of different clothes that pointed to weaving
technology being in place by this time.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.920
From there, more recent ancient civilizations
discovered many materials they could fashion

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.050
into clothing.

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:48.480
For instance, Ancient Egyptians produced linen
around 5500 BC, while the Chinese likely started

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.790
producing silk around 4000 B.C.

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.190
As for clothing for fashion, instead of just
keeping warm, it is thought that this occurred

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.750
relatively early on.

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.310
The first example of dyed flax fibers were
found in a cave in the Republic of Georgia

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.050
and date back to 36,000 years ago.

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.630
That being said, while they may have added
colour, early clothes seem to have been much

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:13.390
simpler than the clothing we wear today—mostly
cloth draped over the shoulder and pinned

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:14.430
at the waist.

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.980
Around the mid-1300s in certain regions of
the world, with some technological advances

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:24.280
in previous century, clothing fashion began
to change drastically from what it was before.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.340
For instance, clothing started to be made
to form fit the human body, with curved seams,

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.180
laces, and buttons.

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.370
Contrasting colours and fabrics also became
popular in England.

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.660
From this time, fashion in the West began
to change at an alarming rate, largely based

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.940
on aesthetics, whereas in other cultures fashion
typically changed only with great political

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.250
upheaval, meaning changes came more slowly
in most other cultures.

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.010
The Industrial Revolution, of course, had
a huge impact on the clothing industry.

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.500
Clothes could now be made en mass in factories
rather than just in the home and could be

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.209
transported from factory to market in record
time.

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:05.840
As a result, clothes became drastically cheaper,
leading to people having significantly larger

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:15.120
wardrobes and contributing to the constant
change in fashion that we still 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:23.820
see today.
