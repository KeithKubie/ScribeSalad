[GUITAR PLAYING]

00:00:05.274 --> 00:00:07.190
DAVE: Today we're joined
by singer-songwriter,

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:10.660
multi-instrumentalist, recording
artist, and Grammy winner Rob

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:11.690
Hotchkiss.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.130
Rob's probably best known
for founding the band Train,

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.740
who released hits including
"Meet Virginia" and "I Am,"

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.320
and their best-known
"Drops of Jupiter,"

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.940
which won the Grammy for
Best Rock Song in 2001.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.140
Since 2003, Rob's been
pursuing his solo endeavors

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.770
and focusing on songwriting
and raising his family.

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.544
And he's recently
returned to the Bay Area

00:00:32.544 --> 00:00:33.710
and returned to songwriting.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.668
So today we have a special
performance from him

00:00:35.668 --> 00:00:38.280
and his wife Pamela to show
off some of their new songs.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.554
So without any further ado,
please welcome Rob Hotchkiss.

00:00:42.554 --> 00:00:47.935
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:47.935 --> 00:00:49.560
ROB HOTCHKISS: Good
evening, Cleveland.

00:00:53.279 --> 00:00:54.820
PAM HOTCHKISS: I
forgot the set list.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.486
ROB HOTCHKISS: So
here we are at Google.

00:00:56.486 --> 00:00:58.700
You guys are like
innovators, right?

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.280
We're going to do
an experiment here.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.460
Guitar has a way
to traditionally

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.900
be tuned, E, A, D, G, B,
E. You won't hear that.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.196
Every guitar I've got
here is tuned differently.

00:01:12.196 --> 00:01:13.320
I have my reasons for that.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.590
Partly I got bored
after a while.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.630
Back in Train, actually
in the beginning,

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.850
I would just--you'd write a
song and it just needed to be

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:23.650
a certain way.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.340
And I owned one guitar.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.390
So if you're going
to play shows,

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.390
my thought was, well, I
need to write three more

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.060
songs in that tuning
so I'm not sitting

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.330
there tuning up in front
of people the whole time.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:41.351
So this is Dadgad, D-A-D-G-A-D.
Just something I felt like I

00:01:41.351 --> 00:01:43.600
discovered, but some other
people have tried this one.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.490
But a song from
a record we have.

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.810
If you guys want to
grab one when you leave,

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.250
called "Midnight Ghost"
that I made a while ago,

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.080
a song called "Rainmaker."

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.738
Two, three, four.

00:01:54.738 --> 00:01:56.279
[MUSIC - ROB HOTCHKISS,
 "RAINMAKER"]

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:17.239
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:17.239 --> 00:05:18.280
PAM HOTCHKISS: Thank you.

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:19.880
ROB HOTCHKISS: And here's one
of those early Train songs.

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.690
This is probably
like-- I think I

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:26.000
wrote "Free," then "Homesick,"
then probably this one,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.508
called "Eggplant."

00:05:27.508 --> 00:05:29.007
[MUSIC - ROB HOTCHKISS,
 "EGGPLANT"]

00:08:23.171 --> 00:08:27.604
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:27.604 --> 00:08:30.559
ROB HOTCHKISS: And here's my
interpretation of the open G.

00:08:30.559 --> 00:11:58.244
[MUSIC - ROB HOTCHKISS]

00:11:58.244 --> 00:12:01.250
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:01.250 --> 00:16:41.120
[MUSIC - ROB HOTCHKISS]

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:46.510
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:48.625 --> 00:16:50.750
ROB HOTCHKISS: So Jimmy
Page found that tuning too.

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:57.250
Now this one I swear I made up.

00:16:57.250 --> 00:17:01.180
So I'm writing a
song, and it just--

00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:04.020
string by string I could
tell what I needed to do

00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:05.349
to get the sound that I wanted.

00:17:05.349 --> 00:17:07.040
And this one's
particularly strange.

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:10.790
This is a 12-string guitar,
so there's more strings to it.

00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:13.219
But you know, normally
you'd tune it in Ds and As

00:17:13.219 --> 00:17:13.760
or something.

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:16.119
That makes some sense because
then some of the strings

00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:16.869
would be the same.

00:17:16.869 --> 00:17:20.060
This one needed to be
D sharp and A sharp.

00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:20.764
It just did.

00:17:24.589 --> 00:17:25.837
Song called "Blind Faith."

00:17:25.837 --> 00:17:26.958
Two, three, four.

00:17:26.958 --> 00:17:28.583
[MUSIC - ROB HOTCHKISS, "BLIND
 FAITH"]

00:20:20.393 --> 00:20:27.194
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:27.194 --> 00:20:28.610
ROB HOTCHKISS: We
played this song

00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:30.810
at TEDx Berkeley, which
is where we met Gopi.

00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:32.680
Does anybody here know Gopi?

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:34.160
So he's a Googler.

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:34.919
Google does the--

00:20:34.919 --> 00:20:35.960
PAM HOTCHKISS: Marketing.

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:36.890
ROB HOTCHKISS: He's one
of the [? yogler. ?]

00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:38.330
He created that thing.

00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:39.880
So great guy.

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:42.056
You should meet him.

00:20:42.056 --> 00:20:44.180
And he found us at TEDx
and said, come play Google,

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:46.304
and I'm like, yes, my
favorite company on the road.

00:20:46.304 --> 00:20:48.090
So not just kissing up.

00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:50.170
But I'm a shareholder
too, so we have

00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:52.944
to inspire you guys to
keep doing great things.

00:20:52.944 --> 00:20:54.110
AUDIENCE: More productivity.

00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:55.190
ROB HOTCHKISS: More
productivity, exactly.

00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:56.640
And maybe think
outside of the box.

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:58.640
If I'm going to tune my guitar
to D sharps and A sharps,

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:00.520
you guys can at least
figure out some new way

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:01.820
to do something, right?

00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:03.486
PAM HOTCHKISS: But
can I make a comment?

00:21:03.486 --> 00:21:06.390
When you Google him,
sometimes Pat's face comes up.

00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:08.027
So if you can fix,
that would be great.

00:21:08.027 --> 00:21:09.610
ROB HOTCHKISS: Yeah,
somebody, please.

00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:11.318
Don't have the lead
singer's face come up

00:21:11.318 --> 00:21:13.468
when you Google Rob Hotchkiss.

00:21:13.468 --> 00:21:14.884
I know Dave's
working on that one,

00:21:14.884 --> 00:21:17.290
but we need the whole crew here.

00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:21.294
This is a song called
"Gods Laughing."

00:21:21.294 --> 00:21:23.002
[MUSIC - ROB HOTCHKISS, "GODS
 LAUGHING"]

00:24:41.305 --> 00:24:47.574
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:47.574 --> 00:24:48.490
ROB HOTCHKISS: Thanks.

00:24:48.490 --> 00:24:50.360
So this is proof that
when you write one,

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:51.950
you got to write two or three.

00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:57.762
So Dave mentioned I had
left Train and embarked

00:24:57.762 --> 00:24:58.470
on a solo career.

00:24:58.470 --> 00:25:00.270
The truth is I
actually disappeared

00:25:00.270 --> 00:25:02.110
for better part of a decade.

00:25:02.110 --> 00:25:03.850
And why am I doing this again?

00:25:03.850 --> 00:25:06.042
Because I wrote these songs.

00:25:06.042 --> 00:25:08.500
You write songs, are you going
to throw them in your closet

00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:10.500
or are you going to put
them in front of people?

00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:13.730
So I wrote "Blind
Faith," "Gods Laughing."

00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:15.790
"Gods Laughing," by the
way, is a pagan song.

00:25:15.790 --> 00:25:16.590
It's the gods.

00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:19.897
All those gods are
laughing, not just that one.

00:25:19.897 --> 00:25:21.980
This one's called "Glide,"
and the most recent one

00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:23.277
that I wrote.

00:25:23.277 --> 00:25:24.610
[MUSIC - ROB HOTCHKISS, "GLIDE"]

00:28:41.412 --> 00:28:42.880
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:44.289
ROB HOTCHKISS: Thanks.

00:28:44.289 --> 00:28:45.330
PAM HOTCHKISS: Thank you.

00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:50.280
And now they're going to do Q&amp;A.

00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:51.770
ROB HOTCHKISS: Thanks for
sharing your lunch time

00:28:51.770 --> 00:28:52.330
with us.

00:28:52.330 --> 00:28:54.121
PAM HOTCHKISS: Yeah,
thanks for coming out.

00:28:54.121 --> 00:28:55.110
DAVE: Thank you, Rob.

00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:56.800
We're here at Google
with Rob Hotchkiss.

00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:58.080
Guys, what do you think
of that performance?

00:28:58.080 --> 00:28:59.621
Can we hear it one
more time for Rob?

00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:06.250
Rob, thank you so much
for coming and joining us

00:29:06.250 --> 00:29:08.550
today, playing for us,
telling your stories.

00:29:08.550 --> 00:29:10.780
I guess my first question
would be about what

00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:11.880
inspired the new songs.

00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:13.390
After being a
musician all your life

00:29:13.390 --> 00:29:16.514
and taking a 10-year hiatus,
was this just the first time

00:29:16.514 --> 00:29:18.180
in 10 years you sat
down and wrote them,

00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:19.638
or the first time
they came to you?

00:29:19.638 --> 00:29:23.020
What inspired the new era of
songwriting and new music?

00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:25.170
ROB HOTCHKISS: Well,
my disappearing act

00:29:25.170 --> 00:29:27.960
had much to do with
learning piano, actually.

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:30.477
I mean, we wrote
"Drops of Jupiter."

00:29:30.477 --> 00:29:32.810
That's kind of the first piano
song that Train ever had.

00:29:32.810 --> 00:29:34.320
So I played it live.

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:36.410
So I got to do that
for a few years.

00:29:36.410 --> 00:29:39.050
And it got me interested in--I
was a little bored with guitar,

00:29:39.050 --> 00:29:39.550
I guess.

00:29:39.550 --> 00:29:42.820
So for about six
or seven years, I

00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:45.640
was learning
Beethoven and Schubert

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:49.200
or whatever, and just really
excited about the instrument,

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:51.540
and kind of put the
guitar down, really.

00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:55.550
So about a year and a half ago
I moved back to the Bay Area

00:29:55.550 --> 00:29:58.390
to actually play with one of
the former members of Train.

00:29:58.390 --> 00:30:00.700
Charlie Colin and
Tom Luce and I put

00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:03.100
a band together called
Painbirds, wherein

00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:04.920
I picked up my guitar again.

00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:08.700
And I think when I picked up
the 12-string, I was recording,

00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:13.480
and I just got into this thing
where the tuning kind of tuned

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:15.640
itself to what I was hearing.

00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:18.080
And like I said, I
wrote "Blind Faith."

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:19.560
And if you're
going to write one,

00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:20.893
you may as well write some more.

00:30:20.893 --> 00:30:23.424
So I came up with that
batch of songs that way.

00:30:23.424 --> 00:30:24.090
DAVE: Wonderful.

00:30:24.090 --> 00:30:27.480
And how has some of the
content of the things that you

00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:28.780
write songs about changed now?

00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:30.300
I mean, you're a
different man now

00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:31.600
than you were when
you were writing,

00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:33.808
say, "Drops of Jupiter" and
the original Train songs.

00:30:33.808 --> 00:30:36.469
Do you find deeper
meaning in them?

00:30:36.469 --> 00:30:38.760
Do you find that you're
writing about different things?

00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:40.420
What are you writing
about these days?

00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:42.170
ROB HOTCHKISS: I think
my stuff has always

00:30:42.170 --> 00:30:45.880
had a bit of-- I don't
want to say message,

00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:47.710
because that sounds
dated or whatever.

00:30:47.710 --> 00:30:51.830
But I don't want to
just write pop songs.

00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:53.990
They have to come from my heart.

00:30:53.990 --> 00:30:59.469
"Blind Faith," I think-- that
song, you look out at the world

00:30:59.469 --> 00:31:01.010
and you just see
some things that are

00:31:01.010 --> 00:31:02.970
going on that are disturbing.

00:31:02.970 --> 00:31:07.317
And I thought to myself, what
is it in me that I could see?

00:31:07.317 --> 00:31:09.150
You can look out there
and see these things.

00:31:09.150 --> 00:31:11.426
What is it about me as a person?

00:31:11.426 --> 00:31:12.800
So part of that
song is about you

00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:13.966
got this going on out there.

00:31:13.966 --> 00:31:16.370
Am I treating the
people around me the way

00:31:16.370 --> 00:31:17.839
they deserve to be treated?

00:31:17.839 --> 00:31:19.880
So it's kind of saying,
you know, we're humanity,

00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:22.290
but we're also-- we
have that all within us.

00:31:22.290 --> 00:31:26.750
And let's think about
that and get it together.

00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:27.302
DAVE: Thanks.

00:31:27.302 --> 00:31:29.510
Now in a bit we're going to
go to audience questions,

00:31:29.510 --> 00:31:30.220
if you guys have them.

00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:32.011
So if you would like
to ask Rob a question,

00:31:32.011 --> 00:31:34.740
please start lining up
at that mic back there.

00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:37.100
Before we go to that, I
wonder if you could regale us

00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:40.062
with a Train story that maybe
no one knows, maybe something

00:31:40.062 --> 00:31:43.480
from time on the road or
from a recording session,

00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:45.980
something that sticks
out in your mind

00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:48.020
as being one of the
fondest memories.

00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:50.260
ROB HOTCHKISS: I don't have
a great, like, funny one,

00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:51.250
at least off the
tip of my tongue.

00:31:51.250 --> 00:31:53.560
But I mean, we did a song
that nobody ever heard,

00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:56.060
which I think is one of
the--the best Train stuff

00:31:56.060 --> 00:31:57.150
nobody's heard.

00:31:57.150 --> 00:31:59.430
It was the early demos.

00:31:59.430 --> 00:32:02.840
But there was one where we did
a song for a Mel Gibson movie,

00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:05.050
and we did it in Abbey Road.

00:32:05.050 --> 00:32:07.580
So just being in
Studio B, which is

00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:11.080
where the Beatles are walking
up the stairs in "Let It Be."

00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:11.890
So to be there.

00:32:11.890 --> 00:32:13.677
John Landau had just
started managing us.

00:32:13.677 --> 00:32:15.760
It was the first time he
had really seen the band.

00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:19.820
We wrote the song on the tour
bus on the way to the studio.

00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:20.800
It's called "Fallout."

00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:25.120
You can find it on-- Google it.

00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:25.890
Google it.

00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:29.712
Thanks, Pam.

00:32:29.712 --> 00:32:30.670
Yeah, Google "Fallout."

00:32:30.670 --> 00:32:31.170
Maybe you'll find it.

00:32:31.170 --> 00:32:31.711
I don't know.

00:32:31.711 --> 00:32:33.410
It was on-- "We Were
Soldiers," I think,

00:32:33.410 --> 00:32:34.490
was the Mel Gibson movie.

00:32:34.490 --> 00:32:37.300
It was on the soundtrack,
not in the movie.

00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:38.900
But there was some magic there.

00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:41.610
We had a guy play bagpipes.

00:32:41.610 --> 00:32:46.750
We had the female background
singers doing some Pink Floyd

00:32:46.750 --> 00:32:48.220
kind of stuff.

00:32:48.220 --> 00:32:49.280
Just that moment.

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:51.290
And I had to sit
down on the piano

00:32:51.290 --> 00:32:53.440
and play "You Only
Give Me Your Money."

00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:55.980
The other guys are like,
hey, it's sacrosanct.

00:32:55.980 --> 00:32:59.810
I'm not going to not do
that if I'm sitting here.

00:32:59.810 --> 00:33:01.950
DAVE: And how have you
been over your career,

00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:03.317
at, like, judging your own work?

00:33:03.317 --> 00:33:05.150
Do you know when a
song's going to be a hit?

00:33:05.150 --> 00:33:06.190
Does it feel like a hit to you?

00:33:06.190 --> 00:33:07.480
Or are there other
songs out there

00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:08.610
where you're like, I
can't believe this one

00:33:08.610 --> 00:33:09.276
didn't take off.

00:33:09.276 --> 00:33:10.974
This is the best
one we've ever made.

00:33:10.974 --> 00:33:13.140
ROB HOTCHKISS: I've not
been good at selecting hits.

00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:15.975
"Meet Virginia," I couldn't--
people were all kind of like,

00:33:15.975 --> 00:33:16.475
really?

00:33:19.950 --> 00:33:22.340
I think I'd know when
they're really bad.

00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:27.150
You don't hear those, I hope.

00:33:27.150 --> 00:33:28.710
Maybe you heard a couple today.

00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:29.210
I hope not.

00:33:29.210 --> 00:33:33.220
But yeah, knowing
what a hit is, boy, I

00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:36.600
would never want to
get into that business.

00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:38.976
DAVE: And I think I'll go to
our first audience question.

00:33:38.976 --> 00:33:40.225
AUDIENCE: Yeah, this is Chris.

00:33:40.225 --> 00:33:42.560
Since you spent time
learning the piano,

00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:47.030
how has that affected your
guitar playing or composing

00:33:47.030 --> 00:33:49.214
or things like that?

00:33:49.214 --> 00:33:51.380
ROB HOTCHKISS: Learning
piano may have had something

00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:55.700
to do with some of these new
tunings that I'm dabbling with.

00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:58.130
On piano, everything's there.

00:33:58.130 --> 00:33:59.660
Anything you want
to do, you can do.

00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:04.670
I can hit any kind of notes.

00:34:04.670 --> 00:34:06.760
Guitar, the way
they've decided to tune

00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:12.389
a guitar, standard
tuning, it's most

00:34:12.389 --> 00:34:15.889
conducive to being able
do the most things with,

00:34:15.889 --> 00:34:18.360
but it just doesn't
sound the best to me.

00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:19.929
It doesn't ring.

00:34:19.929 --> 00:34:22.460
There's even a theory that
the Nazis had something

00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:26.329
to with A 440, that it
was to terrorize the world

00:34:26.329 --> 00:34:26.870
or something.

00:34:26.870 --> 00:34:28.230
But I'm not going there.

00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:31.429
But even take a guitar
and tune it lower.

00:34:31.429 --> 00:34:33.080
Do something, you know?

00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:36.270
And so maybe just--
I don't know,

00:34:36.270 --> 00:34:38.060
bend the rules a little bit.

00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:39.729
So piano got me re-excited.

00:34:39.729 --> 00:34:41.270
Doing all that piano
got me-- finally

00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:45.300
when I got back to guitar, I
was really excited to revisit

00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:45.935
an old friend.

00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:51.245
I did some composing
on piano as well.

00:34:51.245 --> 00:34:53.620
DAVE: Some of the songs you
played for us on guitar today

00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:55.190
were originally
composed on piano,

00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:57.320
and you had to figure out
how to kind of transpose them

00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:58.350
into a guitar arrangement?

00:34:58.350 --> 00:34:59.808
ROB HOTCHKISS:
These, not actually.

00:34:59.808 --> 00:35:01.062
These were written on guitar.

00:35:01.062 --> 00:35:02.520
DAVE: So there's
more in the closet

00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:03.920
that we can expect coming soon?

00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:06.090
ROB HOTCHKISS: Yeah, perhaps.

00:35:06.090 --> 00:35:08.065
DAVE: Looks like we have
someone heading over

00:35:08.065 --> 00:35:09.148
for another live question.

00:35:11.554 --> 00:35:12.970
AUDIENCE: First
of all, thank you.

00:35:12.970 --> 00:35:15.410
I really enjoyed all your songs.

00:35:15.410 --> 00:35:19.820
I wanted to ask you, when
you're writing a song,

00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:22.430
I know people probably ask you,
how do you know you're done?

00:35:22.430 --> 00:35:24.890
But then what is the process
that you go through when

00:35:24.890 --> 00:35:26.274
you're creating a song?

00:35:26.274 --> 00:35:27.190
I'd love to know what.

00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:29.440
ROB HOTCHKISS: I think the
songwriting process for me,

00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:32.230
it's almost like a
song will come to me.

00:35:35.830 --> 00:35:37.810
The last song that
I played you guys

00:35:37.810 --> 00:35:42.890
called "Glide," that guitar
part, the main guitar part

00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:46.400
came to me, and part of
the vocal came to me.

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:49.340
And I kept telling
my family, I said,

00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:52.540
this is either going to be the
best or the worst song I ever

00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:54.930
wrote, because you
have to believe in it.

00:35:54.930 --> 00:35:56.500
You know, this
thing comes to you.

00:35:56.500 --> 00:35:59.600
It's almost I feel
like a receiver.

00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:01.530
If you just put
yourself in the place

00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:03.130
where something can come to you.

00:36:03.130 --> 00:36:04.840
It helps to have a
guitar in your hand,

00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:06.330
or you sing at the piano.

00:36:06.330 --> 00:36:09.570
But it comes to you, and then
you just have to believe in it.

00:36:09.570 --> 00:36:14.400
You know, it's more typical for
me that I end up with the thing

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:17.180
that I started with
than that I jettison it.

00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:20.200
And there are
exceptions, but it's

00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:22.540
kind of just believing in
what you've been given.

00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:25.270
The most recent song I
wrote, or I'm actually

00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:27.990
in the process of writing,
came to me in the dream.

00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:32.260
I'm there, and it was actually
Bob Dylan playing what

00:36:32.260 --> 00:36:34.460
was more like a hip hop song.

00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:35.230
But he's doing it.

00:36:35.230 --> 00:36:38.640
I've been at Pearl Jam
rehearsals in my dreams,

00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:41.670
and they're playing this
song, and it's really good.

00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:44.462
So if you can just remember
it, you were given the song.

00:36:44.462 --> 00:36:45.920
It doesn't usually
happen that way,

00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:48.736
but there have been
a few of those.

00:36:48.736 --> 00:36:50.610
DAVE: I can't leave that
one alone quite yet.

00:36:50.610 --> 00:36:54.162
You had a dream about Bob
Dylan singing a hip hop song,

00:36:54.162 --> 00:36:56.120
and now you're trying to
recover that and write

00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:56.800
that as your song.

00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:58.633
ROB HOTCHKISS: And this
one I did, actually,

00:36:58.633 --> 00:37:03.030
because I woke up, and you've
got your iPhone these days.

00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:04.990
Used to be an old tape
machine or whatever.

00:37:04.990 --> 00:37:09.610
But I woke up and I kind of
just did the beat box thing

00:37:09.610 --> 00:37:10.690
that I was hearing.

00:37:10.690 --> 00:37:13.100
Then I went to the piano
and did the melody,

00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:16.040
because this was fully
formed, and then the melody

00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:17.670
with the singing.

00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:18.512
So that one-- yeah.

00:37:18.512 --> 00:37:19.970
DAVE: Do you think
you captured it?

00:37:19.970 --> 00:37:21.220
ROB HOTCHKISS: I do, actually.

00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:22.989
DAVE: Wow, looking
forward to it.

00:37:22.989 --> 00:37:25.280
ROB HOTCHKISS: It will not
sound like a Bob Dylan song,

00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:28.250
just so you know.

00:37:28.250 --> 00:37:32.352
I don't remember it,
actually, right now.

00:37:32.352 --> 00:37:33.310
Yeah, it's on my phone.

00:37:33.310 --> 00:37:35.450
Good point.

00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:38.140
AUDIENCE: How much
nonmusical infrastructure

00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:41.291
is needed to take a song
that's a hit and make it a hit?

00:37:41.291 --> 00:37:43.540
Let's say your identical
twin wrote "Drops of Jupiter"

00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:46.000
and wasn't in a
band-- what's needed

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.190
to get that on the radio?

00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:53.070
ROB HOTCHKISS: That
one was interesting.

00:37:53.070 --> 00:37:56.420
When we first started
coming up with that,

00:37:56.420 --> 00:37:59.950
that was, to me,
like a rock song.

00:37:59.950 --> 00:38:02.987
The label president-- it's
weird to have somebody

00:38:02.987 --> 00:38:04.820
say something good about
a label president--

00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:08.070
but he heard a
string arrangement.

00:38:08.070 --> 00:38:10.410
Actually, he had an idea
of who the guy would be.

00:38:10.410 --> 00:38:12.210
He said, this is
Paul Buckmaster,

00:38:12.210 --> 00:38:15.130
the guy who did the
Elton John arrangements.

00:38:15.130 --> 00:38:17.380
He said, he'd be
perfect for this song.

00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:22.020
So I had this demo of this
rock song that I got used to.

00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:25.930
And I'm sitting at home
and I get in the mail

00:38:25.930 --> 00:38:27.610
this version with
the strings on it.

00:38:27.610 --> 00:38:30.520
And I was like, you gotta
be kidding me, you know,

00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:32.090
what happened to our song?

00:38:32.090 --> 00:38:34.620
I actually did prevail in
getting the strings to come

00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:37.000
down because they really
beat you over the head

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.160
at that point.

00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:39.390
But I hated it.

00:38:39.390 --> 00:38:40.490
I hated those strings.

00:38:40.490 --> 00:38:42.610
So I think maybe
he had that vision.

00:38:42.610 --> 00:38:45.290
That song without the
strings, does it still

00:38:45.290 --> 00:38:46.230
have the same impact?

00:38:46.230 --> 00:38:47.210
Maybe not.

00:38:47.210 --> 00:38:52.100
So the arrangement was
important in that one.

00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:53.770
Different ways of
going about it.

00:38:53.770 --> 00:38:56.180
The Stones are a great
example of a band.

00:38:56.180 --> 00:38:58.920
They would sit there and
just kind of-- I mean,

00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:00.900
they were talking about
"Exile on Main Street"

00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:02.510
where everybody's sleeping.

00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:05.690
And Keith and Charlie
are just jamming.

00:39:05.690 --> 00:39:07.610
It's 3:00 in the morning
and they're however

00:39:07.610 --> 00:39:08.960
drunk they are or whatever.

00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:13.270
And Keith would just wait
till he knew he had something.

00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:14.340
He would just feel it.

00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:17.179
And then you wake everybody up
and you get it at that moment.

00:39:17.179 --> 00:39:17.970
So it's part of it.

00:39:17.970 --> 00:39:21.620
If you can come up on something
at the moment of creation,

00:39:21.620 --> 00:39:23.920
the Stones were
the kings of that.

00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:26.550
Those early records-- I mean,
Beatles, Little Richard, you

00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:28.160
had to do it.

00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:29.972
You didn't have a
bunch of-- you weren't

00:39:29.972 --> 00:39:31.180
overdubbing a bunch of stuff.

00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:33.920
They went and made a
record in two days.

00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:36.986
So if you can capture
the moment of creation,

00:39:36.986 --> 00:39:38.485
that's where you
get the real magic.

00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:43.870
How does it get on the radio?

00:39:43.870 --> 00:39:46.345
These days?

00:39:46.345 --> 00:39:47.470
We were talking about that.

00:39:47.470 --> 00:39:51.405
These days, I mean, the
labels are basically gone.

00:39:51.405 --> 00:39:53.530
They were the filter, you
know, they could tell us,

00:39:53.530 --> 00:39:55.321
here are the 20 bands
you should listen to.

00:39:55.321 --> 00:39:59.780
Now there's 20,000 bands
that you need to find.

00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:01.900
How do you get it on the radio?

00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:04.290
I think it's harder
than it's ever been.

00:40:04.290 --> 00:40:08.052
Radio seems to have-- there are
20 artists who get all the air

00:40:08.052 --> 00:40:08.990
play.

00:40:08.990 --> 00:40:12.450
And the rest of us have to
use Google ads or whatever--

00:40:12.450 --> 00:40:14.180
you guys know what it is.

00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:15.802
DAVE: AdWords.

00:40:15.802 --> 00:40:16.760
ROB HOTCHKISS: AdWords.

00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:17.260
Yeah.

00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:19.100
You got to get creative
and do whatever

00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:22.780
it takes to get people
to hear your song.

00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:24.602
I wish I had a better answer.

00:40:24.602 --> 00:40:25.310
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:40:28.530 --> 00:40:30.030
DAVE: Is there any
advice you'd give

00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:34.260
to a young aspiring
musician or songwriter?

00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:37.640
ROB HOTCHKISS: I would say do
it because you have no choice.

00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:40.520
Don't want to become one.

00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:41.850
Work at Google, be a lawyer.

00:40:41.850 --> 00:40:42.820
Do something.

00:40:42.820 --> 00:40:45.990
You know, it's hard.

00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:47.630
I mean, our son is a musician.

00:40:47.630 --> 00:40:49.990
He's actually the
talent in the family.

00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:54.580
And he said recently,
he just has do it.

00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:57.850
That's why you should do it,
because you just can't not

00:40:57.850 --> 00:40:58.570
do it.

00:40:58.570 --> 00:41:02.020
DAVE: What are you most
excited for coming up?

00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:04.470
ROB HOTCHKISS: Most
excited for coming up?

00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:08.070
We have a show at
Lafayette Town Hall, which

00:41:08.070 --> 00:41:09.430
is going to be interesting.

00:41:09.430 --> 00:41:13.110
It's with a group called Notes
for Hope cancer awareness

00:41:13.110 --> 00:41:14.300
and prevention.

00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:15.582
That's in July.

00:41:15.582 --> 00:41:16.540
And that's a full band.

00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:19.700
So what you saw was
us bringing it to life

00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:22.380
with an acoustic
guitar and a box drum.

00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:26.880
But full band, drums and
bass, and rock and roll.

00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:32.800
That's July 16 in Lafayette
with Notes for Hope.

00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:33.930
So excited about that.

00:41:33.930 --> 00:41:37.190
We're also going back
to-- we were up by Seattle

00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:41.120
on Vashon Island before we
moved here about a year ago.

00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:43.610
And they built a
brand-new theater there,

00:41:43.610 --> 00:41:45.900
and they're going to
have us come play there.

00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:48.690
So if anyone's in the
Pacific Northwest,

00:41:48.690 --> 00:41:51.420
July-- that's why
I bring my wife.

00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:54.510
July 9, we're going back
home to Vashon Island.

00:41:54.510 --> 00:41:55.990
So those are both
exciting shows.

00:41:55.990 --> 00:41:56.830
DAVE: Wonderful.

00:41:56.830 --> 00:41:57.950
That's so great.

00:41:57.950 --> 00:42:00.840
Remember to grab a copy of
Rob's CD on the way out,

00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:03.080
and let's hear it one more
time for Rob Hotchkiss.

00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:04.630
[APPLAUSE]
