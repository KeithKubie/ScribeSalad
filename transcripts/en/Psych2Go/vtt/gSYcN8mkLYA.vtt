00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.450
To some psychologists dreams aren't that magical, they're simply a product of our brainwave activity when sleeping.

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:08.710
However, other

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.059
psychologists, such as Sigmund Freud, the founding father of psychoanalysis,

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.400
and Carl Jung, an early supporter of Ford's theories about the unconscious,

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:24.479
believed that dreams come from a deep well within our psyches where we store all our unconscious fears and desires.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:31.679
Whether you agree with Freud, Jung or other dream experts, delving into the mysteries of dreams is

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.140
undeniably fun and fascinating.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.780
Here are seven types of Dreams:

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:38.559
- One -

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:43.619
Nightmares: have you ever woken up thoroughly relieved that your dream wasn't real?

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.959
Nightmares can haunt us if we believe our fears are greater than our power to overcome them.

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:55.409
For example, if you have anxiety or depression, you're prone to having more nightmares than pleasant dreams.

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:03.419
Researchers have also discovered that those who have frequent nightmares are often suicidal, struggle with trauma from toxic

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:09.509
relationships or have a family history of mental disorders.  - Two - Lucid Dreams:

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:14.548
Have you ever been aware that you're dreaming, while dreaming? Since you're in control

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:20.670
it can make your dream a lot more interesting. You can take advantage of the situation and do exciting things

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.100
you wouldn't be able to do in real life, via flying on a broomstick or catching a shooting star.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.119
Lucid dreaming allows you to experience the impossible.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.850
- Three - Healing Dreams:

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:40.169
Healing dreams offer insight into your health. I often used to dream about being in grimy bathrooms. Looking back

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.619
I think those dreams were a reminder to look after myself better.

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:49.559
Now that I began a healthier diet and started to exercise more, those dreams have reduced significantly.

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:58.530
Often our problems manifest themselves in our dream settings. So pay close attention to your surroundings the next time you dream. - Four -

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.140
Recurring dreams: Do you ever repeat the same dreams over and over again?

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:11.939
Recurring dreams try to communicate something important that we're ignoring or somehow failing to notice. To understand them better,

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.940
try to be more observant the next time it occurs.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:23.069
Pay attention to any overlapping themes and the actions you take, will help break the cycle in both your dreams and reality.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.360
- Five -

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.130
Physiological Dreams:

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:34.529
Physiological dreams show us what our bodies are lacking, for instance dreaming about drinking water might indicate that you're dehydrated.

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.959
Physiological dreams are often pretty straightforward and easy to interpret upon waking up.

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:47.099
When you're not meeting your body's most basic needs, it will communicate that through physiological dreams.

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.140
- Six - Psychic Dreams:

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:56.349
These dreams are also known as prophetic dreams. Something in your dream occurs that, soon after.

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:04.389
Materializes in real life. As a child I would get these dreams a lot. I believed I had access to a world

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:05.900
no one knew about,

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.500
but as I got older they became less frequent.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:15.340
Some dream experts believe that our minds can sense what is going to happen before actually making sense of the information.

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:23.738
- Seven - Epic Dreams: Epic dreams are the life-changing dreams we have that help us go through big transformations.

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:29.259
Often times these dreams affect us deeply and we vividly remember the details.

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.609
I had one recently where I dreamt up my best friend who had passed away,

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:39.129
he acted like his usual goofy self, and I realized he came to say goodbye.

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.429
Deep down, I think I wanted closure. We meant to hang out one day,

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.850
but he had an unexpected visitor that postponed our plans.

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:55.469
I never did get to see him again. As a matter of fact, he's the reason I had the courage to pursue this career.

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.570
Lately, I've been facing tremendous changes in my life. So it's been overwhelming.

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.500
But seeing him again in my dream reminded me to keep pushing.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.669
I hope you have the courage to go through epic transformations too.

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.429
