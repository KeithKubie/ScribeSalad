00:00:00.423 --> 00:00:02.176
Because the dehydration reaction

00:00:02.176 --> 00:00:04.995
is not observed to occur at 298 Kelvin,

00:00:04.995 --> 00:00:06.829
the student claims that the reaction

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:09.289
has an equilibrium constant less that

00:00:09.289 --> 00:00:12.699
one point zero zero at 298 Kelvin.

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:15.129
Do the thermodynamic data for the reaction

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:16.820
support the students claim?

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.825
Justify your answer,
including a calculation

00:00:20.825 --> 00:00:23.600
of standard or change in standard

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.073
Gibbs free energy at 298 Kelvin

00:00:26.073 --> 00:00:28.395
for the reaction.

00:00:28.395 --> 00:00:29.158
So lets first of all,

00:00:29.158 --> 00:00:30.767
let's review what the students claim is.

00:00:30.767 --> 00:00:31.712
The student claims that since the

00:00:31.712 --> 00:00:34.534
reaction is not observed at 298 Kelvin

00:00:34.534 --> 00:00:38.920
that at that temperature the reaction...

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.476
The student claims that the reaction

00:00:41.476 --> 00:00:44.551
has an equilibrium constant
less than one point o

00:00:44.551 --> 00:00:46.701
at 298 Kelvin. That's their claim.

00:00:46.701 --> 00:00:51.074
And if the idea of equilibrium constant

00:00:51.074 --> 00:00:52.398
or Gibbs Free Energy

00:00:52.398 --> 00:00:53.710
are completely foreign to you

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.130
I encourage you to review
the videos on Khan Academy

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.664
on Gibbs Free Energy and
equilibrium constants.

00:00:58.664 --> 00:01:00.324
If they are familiar
to you but you're like,

00:01:00.324 --> 00:01:01.868
OK I don't know all the formulas

00:01:01.868 --> 00:01:03.703
that might connect the information

00:01:03.703 --> 00:01:05.363
that's given in the problem

00:01:05.363 --> 00:01:06.768
and how to calculate Delta G.

00:01:06.768 --> 00:01:08.969
And maybe how do we go from Delta G

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:10.770
to equilibrium constants and figuring out

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.164
whether the equilibrium constant

00:01:12.164 --> 00:01:13.707
is going to be greater
than or less than one

00:01:13.707 --> 00:01:15.158
or even equal to one.

00:01:15.158 --> 00:01:16.946
The good thing is that they give you

00:01:16.946 --> 00:01:18.107
all of the formulas that you need.

00:01:18.107 --> 00:01:20.151
It's on the first page of
the free response section.

00:01:20.151 --> 00:01:23.866
You just have to understand
which ones are applicable

00:01:23.866 --> 00:01:26.594
and what's actually going
on with those equations.

00:01:26.594 --> 00:01:27.871
So let's first of all think about

00:01:27.871 --> 00:01:31.614
whether we can calculate Delta G

00:01:31.614 --> 00:01:34.243
with the information that they've given.

00:01:34.243 --> 00:01:35.660
And if you go to the first page

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.492
on one of the formulas they give you

00:01:37.492 --> 00:01:38.435
And you might even remember

00:01:38.435 --> 00:01:40.954
how to figure out whether a
reaction is spontaneous or not

00:01:40.954 --> 00:01:42.533
and how you can calculate Delta G

00:01:42.533 --> 00:01:43.729
based on the temperature,

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:45.818
the change in entropy, and
the change in enthalpy.

00:01:45.818 --> 00:01:49.102
You have this formula right over here.

00:01:49.102 --> 00:01:50.521
And I literally just copied and pasted it

00:01:50.521 --> 00:01:52.428
from what they give you
when you take the test.

00:01:52.428 --> 00:01:56.407
And so they give us the change
in enthalpy for the reaction.

00:01:56.407 --> 00:01:58.310
They give us the temperature, 298 Kelvin.

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.386
They give us the change in
entropy for the reaction.

00:02:01.386 --> 00:02:03.009
This is the change in standard entropy,

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:05.111
change in standard
enthalpy for the reaction.

00:02:05.111 --> 00:02:07.155
And so using those we can figure out

00:02:07.155 --> 00:02:09.210
what Delta G is going to be.

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:10.997
And then we can say,
"OK, is it consistent?

00:02:10.997 --> 00:02:13.761
Is it greater than zero?

00:02:13.761 --> 00:02:15.396
Which is conssistant

00:02:15.396 --> 00:02:17.098
with the reaction not being spontaneous

00:02:17.098 --> 00:02:18.340
which seems to be what's observed.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.745
And then how can we go from

00:02:19.745 --> 00:02:22.961
that Delta G to the equilibrium constant?"

00:02:22.961 --> 00:02:25.395
Well they also tell us that Delta G

00:02:25.395 --> 00:02:26.674
is equal to this second thing.

00:02:26.674 --> 00:02:28.933
And this connects Delta G
in the equilibrium constant.

00:02:28.933 --> 00:02:30.976
And we know some things about R and T.

00:02:30.976 --> 00:02:33.891
In fact we know exactly what
R and T are if we need them.

00:02:33.891 --> 00:02:36.019
So let's go ahead and apply

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:38.514
these equations right over here.

00:02:38.514 --> 00:02:41.207
So you have... Actually let me just write

00:02:41.207 --> 00:02:42.900
all of the information we have first.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.878
So what is our change
in standard enthalpy?

00:02:46.878 --> 00:02:47.752
We're going to have to figure that out.

00:02:47.752 --> 00:02:48.900
We're going to have to figure out

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.174
what our change in standard
entropy is going to be.

00:02:54.174 --> 00:02:55.425
We know what the temperature is.

00:02:55.425 --> 00:02:59.016
We know that that is 298 Kelvin.

00:02:59.016 --> 00:03:02.868
And we can worry about R
in a second if we need to.

00:03:02.868 --> 00:03:06.456
So up here when they gave us the reaction

00:03:06.456 --> 00:03:08.788
they gave us our change
in standard enthalpy

00:03:08.788 --> 00:03:11.599
and our change in standard
entropy at 298 Kelvin.

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:12.691
This is very convenient.

00:03:12.691 --> 00:03:17.691
So our change in enthalpy
is 45.5 kilojoules per mole.

00:03:18.405 --> 00:03:23.405
Our change in standard entropy
is 126 joules per Kelvin-mole

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:24.814
so this is very interesting.

00:03:24.814 --> 00:03:27.971
This is given in kilojoules,
this is given in joules.

00:03:27.971 --> 00:03:30.015
And so we wanna make sure
that we're being consistent.

00:03:30.015 --> 00:03:32.662
So let's just make sure that
everything is in joules.

00:03:32.662 --> 00:03:33.684
So I'm going to write this,

00:03:33.684 --> 00:03:37.271
this thing is the same as 45,500

00:03:37.271 --> 00:03:40.893
joules per mole for this reaction.

00:03:40.893 --> 00:03:42.217
So let me write this down,

00:03:42.217 --> 00:03:46.384
this is 45,500, this is
126 joules per Kelvin-mole.

00:03:47.444 --> 00:03:49.734
So this is,

00:03:50.954 --> 00:03:53.031
this right over here,

00:03:53.031 --> 00:03:56.222
is 45,500 joules per mole.

00:03:59.908 --> 00:04:03.908
This is 126 joules per Kelvin-mole.

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:08.938
And now we can figure out what
the Delta G is going to be.

00:04:08.938 --> 00:04:12.522
Delta G is going to be equal to...

00:04:14.072 --> 00:04:18.931
Well our change in enthalpy
is 45,500 joules per mole

00:04:21.583 --> 00:04:25.583
minus our temperature, 298 Kelvin.

00:04:26.576 --> 00:04:28.590
Times our change in entropy.

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.017
Times 126 joules per Kelvin-mole.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.566
And notice the Kelvin and then the Kelvin,

00:04:40.566 --> 00:04:41.686
those should both be capital Ks,

00:04:41.686 --> 00:04:44.117
capital K, cancel out.

00:04:44.117 --> 00:04:46.038
And the units here are
going to be joules per mole.

00:04:46.038 --> 00:04:47.666
The units here are going
to be joules per mole.

00:04:47.666 --> 00:04:49.674
And then we just figure
out the difference.

00:04:49.674 --> 00:04:51.538
So let's do this.

00:04:51.538 --> 00:04:54.283
Let me get my calculator out.

00:04:55.263 --> 00:04:57.134
And so this is going to be...

00:04:59.108 --> 00:05:00.704
Well let me multiply these two first.

00:05:00.704 --> 00:05:05.704
We're going to have 298
times 126 is equal to that.

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.578
And let's see, I'm going
to subtract this from

00:05:08.578 --> 00:05:11.364
45,500 so let me just make it a negative.

00:05:11.364 --> 00:05:15.538
And add it to 45,500 is
going to be equal to...

00:05:19.978 --> 00:05:23.982
is going to be equal to 7,952.

00:05:23.982 --> 00:05:25.191
And if we want to stay...

00:05:25.191 --> 00:05:26.637
I mean we want to stay consistant

00:05:26.637 --> 00:05:28.456
with how many significant digits

00:05:28.456 --> 00:05:30.290
or significant figures we have.

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:32.206
And it looks like it's pretty consistently

00:05:32.206 --> 00:05:33.483
three significant figures.

00:05:33.483 --> 00:05:34.934
So we want three significant figures here.

00:05:34.934 --> 00:05:38.219
So we could write 7,900, roughly 7,950.

00:05:40.784 --> 00:05:45.784
So our Delta G is approximately
7,950 joules per mole.

00:05:50.034 --> 00:05:52.460
And the fact that this
is greater than zero

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.260
tells us that this is not going to be

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.315
spontaneous at that temperature.

00:05:56.315 --> 00:05:58.103
So it's already consistent
with our observations.

00:05:58.103 --> 00:05:59.555
And that's always a good reality check.

00:05:59.555 --> 00:06:01.134
Because, are the things that you're seeing

00:06:01.134 --> 00:06:03.653
consistent with what the
question is describing?

00:06:03.653 --> 00:06:08.542
So Delta G greater than zero consistent.

00:06:09.582 --> 00:06:13.260
Consistent with reaction.

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:18.660
Reaction being, or not being spontaneous.

00:06:20.081 --> 00:06:23.485
Not being spontaneous.

00:06:25.325 --> 00:06:29.719
Spontaneous at 298 kelvin.

00:06:30.726 --> 00:06:33.033
In the videos on Khan
Academy on Gibbs free energy

00:06:33.033 --> 00:06:34.587
we go into a lot more
detail on what this is.

00:06:34.587 --> 00:06:36.073
But one way to think about it is,

00:06:36.073 --> 00:06:38.720
this is the energy, the change in energy

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.426
that's available to do work.

00:06:40.426 --> 00:06:44.138
And so if you have more, if
your Gibbs free energy increases

00:06:44.138 --> 00:06:45.601
over the course of the reaction,

00:06:45.601 --> 00:06:46.586
that means the products have

00:06:46.586 --> 00:06:48.189
more energy to do work.

00:06:48.189 --> 00:06:50.951
And so that means you
have to put work into it

00:06:50.951 --> 00:06:53.181
in order for the reaction
to actually proceed.

00:06:53.181 --> 00:06:55.560
If your Delta G is negative
that means your products

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:59.787
have less energy to do
work than your reactants.

00:06:59.787 --> 00:07:01.540
Which means that it can
release that energy.

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:03.664
It can do work, and it can be spontaneous.

00:07:03.664 --> 00:07:05.342
So this one, it's greater than zero.

00:07:05.342 --> 00:07:08.166
So it's not going to be spontaneous.

00:07:08.166 --> 00:07:09.919
But that doesn't answer
the question for us.

00:07:09.919 --> 00:07:12.043
We want to validate the claim that

00:07:12.043 --> 00:07:16.442
the reaction has an equilibrium
less than one at 298 Kelvin.

00:07:16.442 --> 00:07:19.095
And lucky for us they
also give us the formula

00:07:19.095 --> 00:07:23.286
that ties our Delta G to
our equilibrium constant.

00:07:23.286 --> 00:07:24.548
And we know the other things.

00:07:24.548 --> 00:07:27.289
We know R and we know T.

00:07:27.289 --> 00:07:29.381
And we might not actually
have to think about them.

00:07:29.381 --> 00:07:30.594
Because they're not telling us to

00:07:30.594 --> 00:07:32.202
calculate the equilibrium constant.

00:07:32.202 --> 00:07:33.708
They're just saying we'll validate that

00:07:33.708 --> 00:07:36.366
it's going to be less than one.

00:07:36.366 --> 00:07:41.366
And so, if we took 7,950 joules per mole

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:47.387
is equal to negative RT times

00:07:47.387 --> 00:07:51.243
the natural log of our
equilibrium constant

00:07:51.243 --> 00:07:53.493
we'll solve for the equilibrium constant.

00:07:53.493 --> 00:07:58.493
Let's see, if I divide
both sides by negative RT.

00:07:58.855 --> 00:08:03.855
Negative RT. I'm going
to get the natural log.

00:08:06.289 --> 00:08:09.714
I'll just write it this
way, the natural log

00:08:09.714 --> 00:08:12.442
of my equilibrium constant
is going to be equal to

00:08:12.442 --> 00:08:17.442
7,950 joules per mole over negative RT.

00:08:22.984 --> 00:08:26.734
Or you could say E, this is just...

00:08:26.734 --> 00:08:29.346
What power do I raise E to to get K.

00:08:29.346 --> 00:08:34.346
Or so, you could say E to the
negative 7,950 joules per mole

00:08:38.054 --> 00:08:43.033
over RT is going t to be equal to K.

00:08:43.033 --> 00:08:44.809
And we could actually
calculate what this is.

00:08:44.809 --> 00:08:46.260
We know which R to use.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.526
We're dealing with joules and moles.

00:08:48.526 --> 00:08:51.252
So it would be this first Gas constant

00:08:51.252 --> 00:08:53.643
right over here eight point three one four

00:08:53.643 --> 00:08:55.618
joules per mole-kelvin.

00:08:55.618 --> 00:08:57.673
But we actually don't even have to do that

00:08:57.673 --> 00:08:58.959
because we just have to validate that K

00:08:58.959 --> 00:09:01.071
is going to be less than one.

00:09:01.071 --> 00:09:03.561
What happens if you raise
E to a negative exponent?

00:09:03.561 --> 00:09:06.382
And this is going to
be a negative exponent.

00:09:06.382 --> 00:09:11.101
This is positive, that is
positive, this is positive.

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:15.375
We know it's 298 kelvin
positive, positive.

00:09:17.037 --> 00:09:19.917
So my entire exponent
is going to be negative.

00:09:19.917 --> 00:09:23.164
So negative, so negative.

00:09:25.132 --> 00:09:29.596
So you could say that K
equals E to negative number.

00:09:33.944 --> 00:09:36.706
I'll get this right. It's
kind of weird to write

00:09:36.706 --> 00:09:38.889
the negative and then the negative number.

00:09:38.889 --> 00:09:43.447
E to a negative number.

00:09:45.762 --> 00:09:47.417
Which must be less than one.

00:09:47.417 --> 00:09:50.707
Remember if the exponent is zero,

00:09:50.707 --> 00:09:52.334
E to the zero power is one,

00:09:52.334 --> 00:09:55.712
E to anything positive is
going to be greater than one.

00:09:55.712 --> 00:09:59.543
And E to anything negative
is going to be less than one.

00:09:59.543 --> 00:10:01.088
You wanna be careful, not less than zero.

00:10:01.088 --> 00:10:02.318
You actually can't get to less than zero.

00:10:02.318 --> 00:10:06.161
It's going to be less than one.

00:10:06.161 --> 00:10:09.017
And so this by itself already
validates the students claim.

00:10:09.017 --> 00:10:11.711
If you wanna go further you
could just calculate that.

00:10:11.711 --> 00:10:13.963
You could just say K is equal to

00:10:13.963 --> 00:10:18.963
E to the negative 7,950
joules per mole over R.

00:10:23.917 --> 00:10:26.574
Which is what? eight point three one four

00:10:26.574 --> 00:10:29.819
joules per mole kelvin.
Eight point three one four.

00:10:32.189 --> 00:10:35.967
Eight point three one four
joules per mole kelvin

00:10:38.908 --> 00:10:41.052
times 298 kelvin.

00:10:41.951 --> 00:10:44.930
Those cancel out and joules per mole

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:46.558
divided by joules per mole.

00:10:46.558 --> 00:10:48.332
Those cancel out.

00:10:48.332 --> 00:10:50.343
And so, you would get your number.

00:10:50.343 --> 00:10:51.747
And actually let's just calculate it.

00:10:51.747 --> 00:10:54.413
Just for kicks, just to
really feel good about it.

00:10:54.413 --> 00:10:56.108
And you can see this is
going to be dimensionless.

00:10:56.108 --> 00:10:58.336
And equilibrium constants
are dimensionless.

00:10:58.336 --> 00:11:01.413
So we are going to get,
this is kind of fun.

00:11:01.413 --> 00:11:04.746
So let's see. Let's do
this denominator first.

00:11:04.746 --> 00:11:08.721
If you have eight point
three one four times 298

00:11:11.526 --> 00:11:14.116
Times 298. That's going
to be equal to that.

00:11:14.116 --> 00:11:15.683
Now we're dividing by that.

00:11:15.683 --> 00:11:17.179
So let me take the reciprocal of that

00:11:17.179 --> 00:11:20.907
and multiply it by 7,950.

00:11:20.907 --> 00:11:24.284
7,950 is equal to that.

00:11:24.284 --> 00:11:26.292
Now we want to raise E
to the negative of that.

00:11:26.292 --> 00:11:28.765
So lets make that negative and now

00:11:28.765 --> 00:11:30.901
let's raise E to that power.

00:11:30.901 --> 00:11:34.804
So lets see, we can raise E to that power.

00:11:34.804 --> 00:11:36.715
So we just press that
and there you have it.

00:11:36.715 --> 00:11:41.331
This is approximately
zero point four four zero.

00:11:41.331 --> 00:11:45.997
I guess you could say, well
let's just say four zero four.

00:11:45.997 --> 00:11:50.997
So this is approximately
zero point four zero four.

00:11:52.037 --> 00:11:55.168
Approximately, and I
already forgot the number,

00:11:55.168 --> 00:11:59.587
I have a bad memory, zero
point zero four zero four.

00:11:59.587 --> 00:12:02.977
zero point zero four zero four.

00:12:04.907 --> 00:12:06.559
And the whole rules of significant figures

00:12:06.559 --> 00:12:07.850
get a little bit trickier when you're

00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:09.382
starting to deal with exponents like this.

00:12:09.382 --> 00:12:10.915
So we're not going to,
and they don't ask us

00:12:10.915 --> 00:12:12.238
to calculate the exact value but

00:12:12.238 --> 00:12:14.932
hopefully this makes
you at least appreciate

00:12:14.932 --> 00:12:19.932
that the equilibrium concept
is for sure is less than one.
