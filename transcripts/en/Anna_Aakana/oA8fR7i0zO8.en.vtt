00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:01.220
I don't know about you,

00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:03.180
but I have a terrible habit

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:05.060
of comparing myself to others.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.580
Whenever you compare yourself to another person,

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.100
I mean, you're just gonna end up feeling like shit.

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.760
There's always someone seemingly better than you.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:16.720
(gasp)

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.560
I got a perfect SAT score!

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.780
(paper rips)

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:20.420
Hi.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:22.420
I'm Megan Fox.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:24.600
(sighs)

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:25.740
Oh my god,

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.560
so what have you guys been doing since high school?

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.580
Well, I've been modeling in Paris.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.480
(collective gasps, praise)

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.560
Uh, I just got my masters in law,
and I'm about to take the bar.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.020
(collective gasps, praise)

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.060
Well, I got married,

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.796
and now I'm pregnant!

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.580
(collective gasps, praise)

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.000
I...

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.900
uh...

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.880
found a funny GIF on tumblr yesterday.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.320
Yeah, it made me laugh out loud..

00:00:56.392 --> 00:00:57.830
(weak collective praise)

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:59.071
Isn't it pronounced "GIF"?

00:00:59.071 --> 00:01:00.009
It's stupid.

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:01.541
I mean, we're judging ourselves

00:01:01.541 --> 00:01:03.780
based on what we observe in others.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.000
And it's not even a fair judgement because,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.680
we're measuring ourselves against

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.440
our IDEA of someone.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.520
It's not a fair assessment.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.178
The only real comparison you should ever do

00:01:14.178 --> 00:01:15.309
is against yourself.

00:01:15.769 --> 00:01:17.891
Have you grown as a person?

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:18.940
Have you evolved?

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.940
(leveling noises)

00:01:23.949 --> 00:01:25.208
(video game repetitive beeps)

00:01:25.208 --> 00:01:26.314
WHAT?!

00:01:26.314 --> 00:01:27.098
YEAH!

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.193
(happy screams)

00:01:29.193 --> 00:01:31.540
And more you work on yourself,

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.760
the less you compare yourself to others.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.940
And, you know, when you witness people

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.448
doing amazing things and...

00:01:37.448 --> 00:01:39.739
it'll actually be inspiring.

00:01:39.739 --> 00:01:41.708
You know? You'll be like, "Holy shit, I wanna learn that."

00:01:41.708 --> 00:01:43.161
"Oh my god, I wanna try that."

00:01:43.161 --> 00:01:46.740
Instead of feeling all envious and insecure

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.709
and inferior and you wanna shrivel up

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:51.300
and die because you're never gonna be that cool.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.440
See you next Monday.

00:01:52.449 --> 00:01:53.752
Stay awesome, Gotham.

00:01:53.752 --> 00:01:54.830
I just feel like...

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.271
I'm never gonna have enough cats.

00:01:56.271 --> 00:01:56.771
