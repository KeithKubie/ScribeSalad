00:00:00.625 --> 00:00:01.710
(whooshing)

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:03.560
- [Announcer] This
program is a presentation

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.753
of UCTV for educational
and noncommercial use only.

00:00:10.641 --> 00:00:13.224
(bright music)

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.220
- Welcome to the second of the

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.283
Hitchcock Lecture series.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.550
I'm Fenyong Liu,

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.590
a professor from School of Public Health

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.900
and also the chair of the Graduate Group

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.613
of Comparative Biochemistry.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.660
On behalf of the Dean of
the Graduate Division,

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.833
as well as the Hitchcock
Selection Committee,

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.260
it's my great pleasure,
as well as my honor,

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.010
to introduce today's speaker,

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.303
Professor Sidney Altman.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.580
Professor Altman is truly
a distinguished scientist

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.750
and an outstanding teacher.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.030
More importantly, he's
also a wonderful mentor

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.300
as I personally experienced
as a postdoc fellow

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.963
in his laboratory at Yale.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.760
I will not repeat the long
list of his accomplishments

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.970
here as Professor Lester did yesterday.

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.860
However, I would only want to edit that

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.860
he has spent his entire
40-plus year career

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.823
focused on a single, yet
critically important enzyme

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:54.483
called Ribonuclease P or RNAse P.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.110
His scientific journey on RNAse P

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.973
is an inspiring story.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.650
It starts with his initial discovery

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.690
of the substrate, as well
as the enzymatic activity

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.940
of the enzyme RNAse P

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.280
when he was a postdoc fellow

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.460
under the guidance of Sydney
Brenner and Francis Crick

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.620
at MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.690
in Cambridge, England.

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.620
He then moved to Yale,

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.950
subsequently cloning the RNA subunit

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.680
of the enzyme, RNAse P

00:02:29.566 --> 00:02:33.480
and demonstrating the catalytic activity

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.793
of the RNA subunit.

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.460
His research has revolutionized

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.640
the field of molecular biology

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.030
specifically the function
of RNA molecules.

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.760
Today he will give us
his personal reflection

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.520
of the discovery of the catalytic RNA

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.960
and share with us his
recent research progress

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.030
in his laboratory.

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.923
Please join me in
welcoming Professor Altman.

00:03:00.942 --> 00:03:03.942
(audience applauds)

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.590
- Thank you very much, Fenyong

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.590
for the introduction and for
your wonderful hospitality

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.800
during my visit here.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.020
And once again, I wanna thank the members

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.830
of the Hitchcock
Committee for selecting me

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.990
for these lectures,

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:29.353
and I hope I deliver
in some reasonable way.

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.970
I want to start by
repeating something I said

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.920
at the beginning of yesterday's lecture

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.850
which is that you've
all paid for my research

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.930
over the past 30 or 40 years.

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.210
Your income tax of which a few pennies

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:49.590
on a dollar, so to speak,

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.150
are devoted to my particular research

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.900
through the National Institutes of Health

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.650
and the National Science Foundation.

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.970
And I want to thank all of you taxpayers

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.313
for your donations over the years.

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.540
I feel that's a way of indicating my

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.370
appreciation instead of showing a slide

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.533
with many different names and
many different agencies on it.

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.990
Okay, so yesterday we talked about

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.020
the origin of life a little bit

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:22.740
and what the RNA world was.

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.970
And today I'm gonna
focus on ribonuclease P

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.620
which Fenyong indicated

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.920
which has a subunit that is catalytic.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.870
What I'm going to do is talk about

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.780
both the RNA and the
protein subunits of RNAse P

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.290
in various organisms,

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:45.662
and I wanna indicate that RNAse P

00:04:45.662 --> 00:04:48.153
is an essential enzyme in all organisms.

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.210
I won't go through the data,

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.630
but it is clear that without RNAse P

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:55.603
these organisms don't grow.

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:00.010
After I talk a little bit about the enzyme

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:02.820
I'm going to talk about
different substrates

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:07.820
both in E. coli and in higher organisms.

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.270
And then the last part
of my lecture will be on

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.540
some recent experiments in my lab

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:17.440
in which RNase P is an important mechanism

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.333
in providing a drug therapy.

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:22.570
The first slide you see

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.120
is an old slide and it indicates

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.483
the first substrate for RNase P.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.800
This is a tRNA molecule
as I showed you yesterday.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.760
It's in two dimensions.

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.587
And these are extra
nucleotides at one side of it.

00:05:40.587 --> 00:05:44.680
And RNase P cuts right
here at nucleotide one

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.120
of the mature tRNA sequence.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.890
So all these nucleotides are removed.

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:52.090
These nucleotides are
extra nucleotides too

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:54.780
and they're removed by different enzymes.

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:58.380
So essentially we make
virtually a functional tRNA

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:00.510
out of this cleavage here.

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:03.540
One of the problems we had to confront

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:07.470
and I think we solved it
as I'll show you later

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:10.430
is what is the specificity of this enzyme?

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.140
In fact there are about 60 different

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.990
tRNA precursors in every cell.

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:16.990
None of them have a,

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:19.480
none of them have a consensus sequence

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:23.480
or similar sequences
around the cleavage site.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:28.210
And so how does this enzyme
recognize its substrate?

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:31.390
It does recognize it by looking at

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:35.320
a partial RNA helix on
this side of the substrate

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:38.310
and a single-stranded
region on this side here.

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:40.840
We have two extra base pairs here,

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.400
but it's not at all clear
that they form in vivo

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.700
under the conditions
that we're talking about.

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:53.150
Now this is a chart which characterizes

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:58.150
the catalytic activity of
the RNA subunit of RNase P.

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:01.450
Let me just say although
you cannot see it clearly,

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:03.307
it's not shown here,

00:07:03.307 --> 00:07:06.380
the structure of the catalytic subunit,

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:09.890
although I will show a picture of that

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:12.040
as it has been recently crystallized

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:15.490
by Mondragon at Northwestern University,

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:18.010
the catalytic structure
is extremely similar

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:20.110
in all organisms.

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:22.450
However there is one
difference between that

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:24.773
and the proteins in the enzyme.

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:29.060
In E. coli bacteria,

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:32.650
let's say in E. coli and
in bacteria generally,

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:35.870
there's one RNA subunit which is catalytic

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:38.633
and there's one very
small protein subunit.

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:42.720
If we can rate the catalytic
activity in bacteria,

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:45.800
let's say it's of the
order of one to 10 here.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:50.800
Then we have other species
involve the Archaea

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:55.870
which we now classify as
a separate kingdom here,

00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:58.700
and the Eukarya or eukaryotes.

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:01.650
In Archaea there's one RNA subunit

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:06.410
and four and possibly
some cases more proteins

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:07.633
in the enzyme.

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:12.450
The RNA subunit is catalytic

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:14.600
and in several cases tested.

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:19.590
But the catalytic activity
is only about 1/10 to 1/100

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:22.250
of that compared to that in E. coli,

00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:24.880
but it's easily recognizable.

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:27.350
And this is at pH six

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:31.360
where in fact there's very
little degradation of the RNA

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:34.010
as you incubate it in a reaction mixture

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:36.650
so that you can run
reaction times over night

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:38.710
at pH six under the conditions

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:43.360
Leif Kirsebom in Sweden really devised.

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:46.860
And you can easily see very
low amounts of activity.

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:50.170
And Kirsebom and his group found that the

00:08:51.034 --> 00:08:53.740
RNA from a couple of Eukarya,

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:56.060
as there's one RNA subunit

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:59.270
and there are nine or
more protein subunits.

00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:03.550
The catalytic activity here
is about 10 to the minus five

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:05.920
compared to the catalytic activity here.

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:08.100
So these are

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:12.310
measurements that have
been made rather carefully,

00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:14.833
so we're very confident of these numbers.

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:18.720
This indicates the uncatalyzed reaction.

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:21.660
So if you just let the
substrate sit around,

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:24.300
you'll find the cleavage rate is around

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:26.143
10 to the minus nine or so.

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:31.640
And here are the relative references:

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:33.470
Guerrier-Takada et al. in E. coli,

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:37.280
Pannuci et al. in at
least one of the Archaea,

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:42.280
and Kikovska and Kirsebom
et al. on eukaryotes.

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:48.380
I think that's all I'm
gonna say about the RNA

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:51.133
at the moment.

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:53.960
Now we're gonna talk about diversity

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:56.353
in the subunit composition of RNAse P.

00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:00.330
So we have in bacteria

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:03.720
one protein which we call,

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:06.940
we had labeled a long time ago C5 protein

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:10.110
because it just of its position in gels.

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:13.680
In Archaea there are
four different proteins,

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:15.730
and now another one has been characterized

00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:18.710
which is actually a ribosomal subunit

00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:21.010
which when added to these four

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:23.950
stimulates the activity considerably.

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:26.590
And it has some homology

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:31.270
with one of the proteins found in yeast

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:34.656
and in HeLa cells.

00:10:34.656 --> 00:10:37.070
And we have in HeLa cells,

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:39.040
this is a human enzyme,

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:41.310
10 subunits here and you can see

00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:44.050
some of them have homology
to the Archaea subunits.

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:44.933
Here's RPP30.

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:47.740
Here, RPP38.

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:51.290
Here et cetera, RPP21 and 29

00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:53.210
and POP5 here.

00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:55.350
But there's several subunits here

00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:57.823
and as I indicated from
the previous slide,

00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:02.270
they appear to contribute
to the catalytic activity.

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:05.120
And by saying appear to contribute,

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:07.790
it could very well mean stimulating

00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:10.150
the RNA activity by itself

00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:12.660
by adding these various proteins.

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:15.250
So I should also say something about

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:17.440
the evolution of the RNA subunit.

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:20.960
The shape as you can draw
in at least two dimensions

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:25.960
is very similar from
bacteria up to human cells.

00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:29.250
There are some differences,
generally it's about,

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:33.320
the RNA's about 350 nucleotides in size.

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:34.330
But there are a couple of yeasts

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:37.090
where it's 250 nucleotides in size

00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:38.620
and there are a couple of other organisms

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:42.220
where it's like 800 or
900 nucleotides in size.

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:44.950
However the difference in size

00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:47.370
corresponds to a difference
in the recognition

00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:49.100
of certain subunits,

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:53.050
and does not seem to affect
generally what we observe.

00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:55.310
The catalytic portion of the enzyme

00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:57.420
remains more or less constant

00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:00.260
although it does change somewhat

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:04.310
between the Eukarya and bacteria.

00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:05.143
And,

00:12:05.143 --> 00:12:07.450
these slides are from Venkat Gopalan

00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:10.980
at Ohio State University.

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:14.210
And this gives an
indication of the evolution

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:16.530
of the protein subunits.

00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:19.770
We have a common ancestor here

00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:23.393
where presumably RNase P
lacked protein subunits.

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:28.200
Although there's no direct evidence,

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:30.420
there's nothing to indicate that that

00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:33.400
should not be the case,

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:37.320
we know that if we isolate
the RNA subunit by itself

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:39.220
in test tubes, in vitro,

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:42.700
it has the catalytic
activity that is for bacteria

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:45.420
and we can show it for
these other organisms.

00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:46.253
And then

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:48.810
for bacteria there's the origin

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:50.783
of a single protein cofactor.

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:56.170
And for the other organisms here

00:12:56.170 --> 00:12:59.580
apparently you start sharing
four protein subunits,

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:01.440
and then you have the Archaea.

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:03.760
And the Eukarya are out here.

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:07.920
So this is a rough picture of
the evolution of this enzyme

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:12.180
in terms, if I may make the reference

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:14.350
to what I talked about yesterday,

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:17.660
this is an indication of
the complexity of evolution

00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:19.200
as it goes along.

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:21.420
So let's not think about humans

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:24.970
as thinking individuals for a moment,

00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:26.820
but if we just look the structure

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:29.490
of a key enzyme, in this case,

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:31.520
and determine what goes on,

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:34.300
the bacterias are very simple,

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:36.440
but eukaroytes are quite complicated

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:38.330
in this particular case.

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:41.940
And we see that the proteins
seem to have replaced

00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:45.833
the contribution of RNA in
terms of the catalytic activity.

00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:49.710
Now I'm gonna talk about some substrates

00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:52.900
that have been found in E. coli to date,

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:55.970
and some of them exist in
other bacteria as well.

00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:59.680
First, we have tRNA precursors
which are listed here

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:03.440
and as I said there are
about 60 different precursors

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:07.310
in any particular organism,
bacteria or eukaryotes.

00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:08.530
Then we have

00:14:10.064 --> 00:14:14.990
4.5 sRNA in which the structure
can be drawn like this

00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:17.110
of long double-stranded regions,

00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:19.210
a long hairpin.

00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:22.660
But the precursor has
extra nucleotides here

00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:26.450
and the arrow indicates
where E. coli will cleave it

00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:28.530
just at this point here.

00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:30.970
So this in fact

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:35.030
was good reason to believe
that our other data

00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:37.760
on the structural
features that are required

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:41.220
for cleavage by RNase P is correct.

00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:43.330
That is to say, we have a long period

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:45.560
of double-stranded RNA here

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:48.220
of which actually you
only need about a half a

00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:52.420
helical strand of,

00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:54.487
a helical twist of RNA,

00:14:54.487 --> 00:14:56.493
and a single-stranded region here.

00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:02.913
This is another similar
substrate from E. coli.

00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:05.560
Here are others, I won't go into what

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:07.560
they're doing at the moment.

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:09.860
This is a phage RNA actually.

00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:12.480
This is actually tmRNA

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:15.520
or an RNA which is both a messenger RNA

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:17.570
and looks like a tRNA.

00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:19.470
That is to say, there's a coding region

00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:23.600
in this region here and it codes for a

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:26.910
small protein of about 11 amino acids

00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:29.890
which tags proteins
that are to be degraded

00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:33.200
inside E. coli and other organisms.

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:34.680
But the ends of the molecule

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:36.817
look just like a tRNA molecule

00:15:36.817 --> 00:15:40.217
and it has a precursor sequence here,

00:15:40.217 --> 00:15:42.520
and RNA cleaves it right here.

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:47.120
So these are all important
molecules in E. coli,

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:48.700
and they have,

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:50.800
they are not unstable molecules.

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:54.410
They have reasonable
lifetimes inside cells.

00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:56.470
And if you know how to look for them,

00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:58.880
and now we know how to look for these,

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:00.573
you can find them quite easily.

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:04.590
Several years ago,

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:06.820
about seven or eight years ago,

00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:08.850
in my lab it was found that there was

00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:12.770
another set of substrates for RNase P.

00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:17.540
And it remains to be shown by
really rigorous experiments

00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:22.540
that this does function
in gene regulation.

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:26.450
But we've shown in
model systems that does.

00:16:26.450 --> 00:16:29.830
So here are various operons indicated.

00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:33.410
An operon is a region that has three genes

00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:37.660
usually coding for similar
metabolic function,

00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:38.873
but not always.

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:43.420
Here's another one here with five genes.

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:46.570
Here's the histidine
operon with several genes.

00:16:46.570 --> 00:16:51.310
And the fat arrows are
coding regions for proteins.

00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:53.700
And these narrow lines here

00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:56.670
are the regions between proteins.

00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:58.700
What we can say, for example,

00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:01.260
is that RNase P, in these cases,

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:05.070
cleaves in the regions
between the coding regions.

00:17:05.070 --> 00:17:08.003
So these underlines
indicate cleavage here.

00:17:08.850 --> 00:17:09.953
One here.

00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:12.640
One here,

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:15.090
and one in this region right here.

00:17:15.090 --> 00:17:17.430
We isolated these
molecules just by looking

00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:19.570
at a temperature-sensitive mutant

00:17:19.570 --> 00:17:22.210
in RNase P at a high temperature

00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:25.360
and we picked these molecules
out from many molecules

00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:27.820
that you could find under these conditions

00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:32.020
that did not appear under
normal growth conditions.

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:37.020
So these are some examples
of cleavage in our operon,

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:39.580
but it's much easier to
do things in an operon

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:41.920
that you really recognize

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:43.110
which is the lac operon

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:47.413
for the metabolism of lactose.

00:17:48.450 --> 00:17:50.290
And here we have the lac operon.

00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:52.583
There are three genes: lacZ, lacY, lacA.

00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:56.600
We know what each one of these codes for,

00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:59.820
and here are the intergenic
regions right here.

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:03.420
So here's the end of the lacY region

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:05.200
in this particular case.

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:07.740
So we're looking at this region in here.

00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:11.650
And this is the beginning
of the lacA operon in UUG.

00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:13.530
This is a UUA here.

00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:15.810
And this is what the region between

00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:18.340
the two coding proteins looks like.

00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:22.300
And it looks like it
actually has a structure

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:24.473
that would be recognized by RNAse P.

00:18:26.181 --> 00:18:27.130
And in fact it does.

00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:29.483
This where P cleaves, it's right here.

00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:32.590
I won't go into data,

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:35.270
but this just indicates
what I'm talking about.

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:38.590
That is to say, if we put this structure

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:44.800
on a piece of genetic
information where it's coded for

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:47.610
in a bacterium where we can turn off

00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:49.660
RNase P when we want to,

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:51.240
and we can do that,

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:53.100
we show that when we turn this off

00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:55.300
we make more of lacA.

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:58.930
When we allow P to function,

00:18:58.930 --> 00:19:00.570
we make much less of lacA

00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:02.440
because you get cleavage here

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:05.240
and degradation under these cases.

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:07.410
Now it was noticed in the '60s

00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:10.470
when RNase P, ah excuse me,

00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:14.700
when the lacZ operon was
being studied by many people

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:17.160
that there was a significant difference

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:19.490
between the translation or the production

00:19:20.806 --> 00:19:22.547
of these three genes here.

00:19:22.547 --> 00:19:24.900
In fact there was much less of lacA made

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:26.980
than lacY or lacZ.

00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:30.923
And there was really no
explanations at all given for that.

00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:35.100
I think in this case, with
the model system we have

00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:38.290
actually supplied that explanation.

00:19:38.290 --> 00:19:41.210
But this simply gives
you another indicator

00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:43.900
of the range

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:48.900
and variety of substrates
for RNase P in bacteria.

00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:53.800
So we can talk a little bit
about now in eukaryotes.

00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:56.490
David Spector some time ago

00:19:56.490 --> 00:19:59.150
published a paper in RNA,

00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:00.563
I think it was 2000,

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:03.823
it was either early in 2010,

00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:05.963
ah, yes it was.

00:20:07.210 --> 00:20:12.210
And he asked us for samples
of RNase P from HeLa cells

00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:14.143
which we sent to him.

00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:16.510
He was looking at a substrate

00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:19.320
that looked like this.

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:20.870
We don't have to worry about most of this.

00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:23.683
This is just taken from his paper.

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:26.650
In fact, he was looking
at a very long piece

00:20:26.650 --> 00:20:28.540
of messenger RNA

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:31.310
and inside the message he identified

00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:34.440
what looked like a tRNA molecule here.

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:36.340
And as it turns out,

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:39.520
RNase P does cleave this molecule

00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:42.150
right at the junction of the single

00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:43.720
and double-stranded region here

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:46.800
and you wind up with this, okay.

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:51.370
This describes further
events in the pathway

00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:54.780
which I'm not interested in
for our purposes at the moment.

00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:56.830
But he clearly had found that RNase P

00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:59.720
does cut in that particular position,

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:02.510
and he recently told
me that he has at least

00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:05.480
one other such case of substrates

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:08.130
that look like this in eukaryotes.

00:21:08.130 --> 00:21:10.200
So that's satisfying.

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:12.970
We already knew from previous
experiments of course

00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:15.890
that RNase P cut tRNA precursors,

00:21:15.890 --> 00:21:18.530
for example, in HeLa cells or mouse cells

00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:22.310
or any other organism that
you wanted to look at.

00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:26.000
We know that RNase P is
actually located in the nucleus

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.683
of Eukarya and I might
mention that a little later.

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:32.640
So it cleaves tRNA precursors.

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:35.370
It cleaves these long messages

00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:37.660
with tRNAs in the middle of them.

00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:40.670
We have evidence and we published evidence

00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:43.780
that it cleaves ribosomal RNA precursors

00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:45.773
in HeLa cells and in yeast.

00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:50.610
It's hard to get purified
ribosomal precursors,

00:21:50.610 --> 00:21:53.930
but the evidence we have
is pretty convincing.

00:21:53.930 --> 00:21:55.820
So we have at least three classes

00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:58.230
of substrates in eukaryotes

00:21:58.230 --> 00:22:00.660
and I'm sure there are more substrates.

00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:02.143
It's just that we haven't,

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.160
and I don't think anybody has

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:08.293
made the effort to look for more.

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:13.920
Now it had been suggested for some time

00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:18.510
that in various organelles in eukaryotes,

00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:20.900
for example, mitochondria,

00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:23.400
or a chloroplast for example,

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:28.230
that there was no RNAse P of
the kind that I've mentioned.

00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:30.620
It had been indicated
that there was RNAse P

00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:32.733
that contained no RNA at all.

00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:38.660
However a recent paper by
Koehler and Teitell in Cell

00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:41.313
this year, a few months ago,

00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:45.450
actually was quite a remarkable paper.

00:22:45.450 --> 00:22:47.120
It was on the function of an enzyme,

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:50.770
polynucleotide phosphorylase, PNPase

00:22:50.770 --> 00:22:54.230
which is responsible for importing

00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:57.780
various pieces of RNA into mitochondria

00:22:57.780 --> 00:23:00.470
in human cells.

00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:04.000
And one of the things
it imports is RNase P.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.970
And in fact, Teitell and
Koehler and their co-workers

00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:10.900
showed that there were certain sequences

00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:15.233
that actually were cleaved
by the conventional RNase P.

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:22.020
Now these diagrams are
taken from another paper,

00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:23.600
but it doesn't really matter,

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:26.380
they demonstrate what I wanted to show.

00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:29.840
And that is when you have
the classical RNase P

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:31.940
with an RNA subunit,

00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:34.890
and in mitochondria you have situations

00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:37.210
where you have a long piece of RNA

00:23:37.210 --> 00:23:41.310
and interior in the RNA there
might be two tRNA sequences.

00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:43.470
You have messenger RNA here,

00:23:43.470 --> 00:23:45.117
messenger RNA here.

00:23:45.117 --> 00:23:48.720
And in these kinds of
cases RNase P cuts it here

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:50.950
at the beginning of this tRNA,

00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:53.463
and cuts it here at the
beginning of this tRNA.

00:23:54.790 --> 00:23:56.340
It had been shown by people

00:23:56.340 --> 00:24:00.010
who worked on these enzymes that

00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:04.850
supposedly don't have
RNA associated with them

00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:07.160
that if you have an RNA like this

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:10.230
at the head of a region where
there's a messenger RNA here

00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:13.210
and you have one RNA here that

00:24:13.210 --> 00:24:14.840
that these other enzymes

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:18.320
cleave this RNA at this particular point.

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:21.630
So that is a remarkable new finding.

00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:25.480
I found that the whole
paper that I looked at

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:28.530
in this case was a very interesting paper

00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:31.180
and very useful and it showed in fact

00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:33.183
that RNase P seems to be,

00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:36.610
in quotations, everywhere,

00:24:36.610 --> 00:24:38.163
the classical RNase P.

00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:42.400
There's one other thing
I'd like to show you

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:45.640
about the structure of the enzyme

00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:47.420
and it's complicated.

00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:49.643
It's essentially the crystal structure,

00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:53.400
a fantastic crystal structure

00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:56.770
performed by Mondragon and his colleagues

00:24:56.770 --> 00:24:58.413
at Northwestern University.

00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:02.430
They have made, they have done,

00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:05.090
they have solved the crystal structure

00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:07.230
of the ternary complex

00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:12.230
which contains the RNA
subunit of RNase P from a

00:25:13.030 --> 00:25:16.170
bacterium that's not too
different from E. coli,

00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:20.190
the protein subunit of the complex,

00:25:20.190 --> 00:25:23.280
the tRNA product of the complex,

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:25.760
and a single-strand piece of RNA

00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:28.560
which supposedly would represent

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:32.060
the cleavage product
from a tRNA precursor.

00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:36.520
So effectively we're looking
at the product of the reaction

00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:39.053
with the product in the substrate.

00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:42.863
This paper will be
published in Nature soon.

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:46.593
I can effectively guarantee that.

00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:51.380
Okay, so this is a different
way of looking at it

00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:53.870
from what the conventional picture is,

00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:56.990
but here we have in blue or purple,

00:25:56.990 --> 00:25:57.960
whatever you want to call it,

00:25:57.960 --> 00:25:59.947
the RNase P RNA.

00:26:03.050 --> 00:26:05.130
It's organized in this particular way.

00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:08.490
Usually we turn at least by 90 degrees

00:26:08.490 --> 00:26:09.910
and look at it from that point of view,

00:26:09.910 --> 00:26:11.300
but that's all right.

00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:12.690
And I'm not going to to into any

00:26:12.690 --> 00:26:15.230
of the crystallographic
details at the moment.

00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:16.890
I simply want to show that this is

00:26:16.890 --> 00:26:19.170
what has been found and how it

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:22.830
confirms some of the predictions

00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:24.630
that were earlier made.

00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:27.250
This is a tRNA precursor here.

00:26:27.250 --> 00:26:30.270
So this is the anticodon stem down here.

00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:32.490
And this is the recognition site here

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:35.783
at the junction of the tRNA molecule.

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:39.790
And there would be a
single-stranded region

00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:43.040
which we can't identify here.

00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:47.453
The protein cofactor is
located in this region here.

00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:52.910
Now there has been a lot
of RNA work done on this

00:26:52.910 --> 00:26:54.850
before the crystal structure.

00:26:54.850 --> 00:26:57.290
So we already knew something about

00:26:57.290 --> 00:27:00.760
which parts of the RNA were
in contact with the protein.

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:04.390
We knew by cross-linking
studies which part of tRNA

00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:08.240
were in contact with this
piece of the RNA too.

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:10.880
Nevertheless, I think this is

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:14.020
a fantastic piece of crystallography

00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:15.553
and very interesting work.

00:27:17.030 --> 00:27:20.103
So I offer my
congratulations to Mondragon.

00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:26.600
We had shown

00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:29.840
that the RNase P in
complex with the substrate

00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:31.663
has different confirmations.

00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:35.060
It can be the transient state

00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:37.220
or the active state of the enzyme

00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:39.890
and we don't know anything about that yet.

00:27:39.890 --> 00:27:42.230
It could be the free substrate

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:45.920
or it could be the cleaved product

00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:47.800
in the single-stranded region.

00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:51.520
But we had shown from various
enzymological experiments

00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:53.770
in vitro that these three sites,

00:27:53.770 --> 00:27:56.300
these three confirmations must exist.

00:27:56.300 --> 00:28:00.080
And Mondragon has succeeded in producing

00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:02.600
the crystal structure of this one.

00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:03.760
We had also shown

00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:06.410
from cross-linking and other studies

00:28:06.410 --> 00:28:10.250
that the aminocyl helix of
the substrate is denatured

00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:11.510
during the cleavage product.

00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:12.760
That is to say,

00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:17.760
at the helical end of the tRNA precursor

00:28:18.370 --> 00:28:22.061
where usually at the three-prime end

00:28:22.061 --> 00:28:23.910
an amino acid is attached,

00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:26.470
at the five-prime end you
have an extra substrate,

00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:27.890
those strands come apart.

00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:32.890
So it's no longer a double-stranded
region in the helix.

00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:34.970
And we'd shown that that was the case.

00:28:34.970 --> 00:28:37.820
And if you cross-link the
helix and it could not denature

00:28:38.788 --> 00:28:41.330
then you got no enzymatic reaction at all.

00:28:41.330 --> 00:28:46.330
And that was confirmed by
this particular structure.

00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:48.620
It was shown by Mondragon

00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:50.870
that in fact the two parts of this helix

00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:53.120
are denatured in the complex.

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:55.050
And furthermore the
position of the protein

00:28:55.050 --> 00:28:58.820
has been specified by various methods

00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:02.490
and the crystal structure
confirmed all of that too.

00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:04.543
So it's quite satisfying.

00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:07.663
Okay.

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:12.500
I'm going to go on now to
some recent work in our lab

00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:14.490
and I might skip some stuff

00:29:14.490 --> 00:29:16.673
because I don't wanna go over time.

00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:19.670
First of all,

00:29:19.670 --> 00:29:22.463
here is the classical tRNA precursor.

00:29:23.991 --> 00:29:26.440
It was from these molecules that in fact

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:30.360
we first deleted this region here,

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:32.150
this stem and loop and this stem and loop.

00:29:32.150 --> 00:29:33.630
It was done with Bill MacLean

00:29:33.630 --> 00:29:36.210
and we covalently linked this to this

00:29:36.210 --> 00:29:38.250
and that was a very good substrate.

00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:41.500
It was just one continuous
helix with a loop.

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:44.713
And then Tony Forster, a
postdoc from Australia,

00:29:45.650 --> 00:29:49.340
this is 15 years ago at least

00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:52.860
succeeded in deleting this loop here.

00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:55.760
So we're just left with this strand

00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:58.150
hydrogen bonded to this strand here.

00:29:58.150 --> 00:30:00.470
And if you draw that differently,

00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:02.100
this is what you see.

00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:06.390
In fact these are now two
different RNA molecules,

00:30:06.390 --> 00:30:07.940
but they get cleaved very well

00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:10.830
by RNase P at this point here.

00:30:10.830 --> 00:30:13.360
And they've been drawn
in different colors here,

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:17.330
because now they represent
the basis of the therapy

00:30:17.330 --> 00:30:19.230
I'm going to talk about.

00:30:19.230 --> 00:30:21.800
This can be any target RNA in a cell,

00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:22.703
any cell.

00:30:24.090 --> 00:30:26.860
And as long as you have
another piece of RNA

00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:29.240
that can hydrogen bond to it here,

00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:31.890
it's especially true of
bacteria in this case,

00:30:31.890 --> 00:30:36.320
we call this external
guide sequence, the EGS.

00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:39.500
And as long as this
can hydrogen bond here,

00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:41.220
this is still a very good substrate.

00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:44.210
It's just an imitation of model substrates

00:30:44.210 --> 00:30:46.453
we made and it's cleaved by RNAse P.

00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:51.840
Now,

00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:53.560
if we have a piece of DNA

00:30:56.930 --> 00:31:00.070
which is made into an
RNA or messenger RNA,

00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:01.460
whatever you want,

00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:03.790
and there's no external
guide sequence involved,

00:31:03.790 --> 00:31:04.833
you make protein,

00:31:05.713 --> 00:31:07.750
a regular state of affairs.

00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:10.190
If you have an extra guide sequence,

00:31:10.190 --> 00:31:11.920
external guide sequence,

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:14.570
hydrogen bonded to the piece of message

00:31:14.570 --> 00:31:17.150
then cleavage is going to occur

00:31:17.150 --> 00:31:19.240
at one particular end of the EGS

00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:21.970
and you're gonna get mRNA cleavage there

00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:24.430
by the host cell RNase P

00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:27.120
which recognizes this as a substrate.

00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:30.820
And you're going to
inactivate this particular RNA

00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:35.040
and you're gonna stop it from
expressing itself completely.

00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:37.520
So if the RNA's a viral RNA

00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:41.050
or an RNA that codes for
a particular disease,

00:31:41.050 --> 00:31:43.020
you're going to absolutely stop it

00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:45.363
from functioning under those conditions.

00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:48.810
So that's the basis of the therapy,

00:31:48.810 --> 00:31:51.040
that you have this situation

00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:54.520
and you have the RNase P
which exists inside the cell

00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:57.640
and so you can do all these things.

00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:02.640
Now these are some ways of
transporting any piece of RNA.

00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:07.300
There are various other
mechanisms in which RNA's involved

00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:09.960
and I'm not gonna talk
about them at the moment.

00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:12.840
Let me just say that the
method I'm gonna describe

00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:14.590
is just as good as siRNA.

00:32:14.590 --> 00:32:19.070
We've tested siRNA on the same targets

00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:21.270
as we've tested the EGS on

00:32:21.270 --> 00:32:24.423
and the numbers are very comparable.

00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:27.900
You can have things attached to antibodies

00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:30.270
which themselves attach

00:32:30.270 --> 00:32:32.610
to particular parts of cells.

00:32:32.610 --> 00:32:35.910
You can have them attached
or inserted into viruses

00:32:35.910 --> 00:32:37.850
which then infect cells.

00:32:37.850 --> 00:32:41.640
You can have oligonucleotides
encompassed in liposomes

00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:46.580
which are lipid bodies that
will wrap around a piece of RNA.

00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:50.180
Or a nanoparticle containing some RNA.

00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:53.437
Or you can have basic peptides
attached to pieces of RNA.

00:32:55.290 --> 00:32:59.190
Although our previous work
had been done biologically,

00:32:59.190 --> 00:33:02.320
that is to say, we made small genes

00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:06.417
that coded for EGSes and
inserted them into bacteria

00:33:06.417 --> 00:33:08.160
and they certainly work in E. coli

00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:11.430
and some other organisms.

00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:13.640
But now we're doing these experiments

00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:17.330
with basic peptides with
morpholino oligonucleotides.

00:33:17.330 --> 00:33:21.113
And I'll show you a picture
of that very shortly.

00:33:25.510 --> 00:33:29.430
And this is just an
indication of the kinds of RNA

00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:33.560
you could use to shut
down gene expression.

00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:35.910
There are aptamers which
are small molecules

00:33:35.910 --> 00:33:38.800
that bind to particular sequences.

00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:41.400
So these are made out of RNA let us say.

00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:46.260
Hammerhead ribozymes which
are not very good I think.

00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:50.730
siRNA which can be used in
human cells for example.

00:33:50.730 --> 00:33:54.740
Splicing variants which have been used

00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:56.970
to attack certain diseases in which

00:33:56.970 --> 00:33:58.790
there is a splicing variant

00:33:58.790 --> 00:34:02.520
that causes diseases like
Duchenne muscular dystrophy

00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:05.790
and you can adjust that splicing variants

00:34:05.790 --> 00:34:07.763
back to the normal situation.

00:34:09.180 --> 00:34:11.960
In a couple of papers
which have been published

00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:14.240
you get some improvement
in the muscular dystrophy.

00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:15.940
The EGS which is,

00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:17.680
which is what I'm gonna talk about.

00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:22.570
Locked nuclear RNA which
is another variant on RNA

00:34:22.570 --> 00:34:24.540
and peptide nuclear RNA.

00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:26.010
I'm not gonna talk much about these,

00:34:26.010 --> 00:34:27.693
but they can be useful.

00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:34.160
This is an old slide showing results

00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:36.490
with our biological effects.

00:34:36.490 --> 00:34:38.893
Simply that an E. coli for example,

00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:45.860
we can inhibit the expression
of various of these genes.

00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:50.120
When you induce beta-galactosidase
or alkaline phosphatase

00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:52.960
they're made at a level of over 1,000 fold

00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:54.840
of the constitutive level.

00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:56.500
So normally they're hardly made at all,

00:34:56.500 --> 00:34:57.970
but you can induce them

00:34:57.970 --> 00:34:59.760
and then the level goes up.

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:03.320
With one EGS attacking
one site on the message,

00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:06.350
you knock out 60% of the activity.

00:35:06.350 --> 00:35:07.700
These are essential genes.

00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:10.450
But this one is the one
that we're interested

00:35:10.450 --> 00:35:11.853
in drug resistance.

00:35:13.885 --> 00:35:17.180
And we're looking essentially
at chloramphenicol resistance.

00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:19.200
And we can stop that,

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:22.800
we can reverse that into
chloramphenicol sensitivity

00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:25.990
of a bacteria 100% by using

00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:29.560
two EGSes that attack two different sites

00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:31.210
in the messenger RNA that codes

00:35:31.210 --> 00:35:33.680
for chloramphenicol resistance.

00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:35.320
Okay, you can say that's all right,

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:38.580
but conventional antibiotics
are just as good.

00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:40.490
Well, they're not just as good.

00:35:40.490 --> 00:35:43.030
A one-step mutation can convert something

00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:46.050
that's sensitive to drug resistance.

00:35:46.050 --> 00:35:49.400
In our case, three mutations

00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:52.380
as long as they're not right
next to each in the EGS

00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:55.300
can still function.

00:35:55.300 --> 00:36:00.150
So it's clear that that is a
much better biological result

00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:05.150
than the conventional
method of doing things.

00:36:05.450 --> 00:36:09.060
And this is also has been
replicated by somebody else

00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:12.920
in actually California, now that I'm here,

00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:14.743
on amikacin resistance.

00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:17.533
Just let me go on now.

00:36:19.820 --> 00:36:22.110
Very briefly I will say that we can now

00:36:22.110 --> 00:36:24.970
isolate an EGS in a few hours

00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:31.020
providing you have a supply
of E. coli RNase P on hand

00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:33.403
which is very easy to arrange,

00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:39.060
and a 1/2 ml solution

00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:41.890
of a piece of random RNA.

00:36:41.890 --> 00:36:46.210
So in our case we might have
something this long here

00:36:46.210 --> 00:36:48.650
where N is the random RNA in these pieces

00:36:48.650 --> 00:36:51.313
and we have various
restriction sites here,

00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:54.673
and we just incubate this.

00:36:55.570 --> 00:36:57.760
You can label the target RNA,

00:36:57.760 --> 00:36:59.850
in any particular,

00:36:59.850 --> 00:37:02.490
any particular RNA you want.

00:37:02.490 --> 00:37:05.090
You can mix that labeled target RNA

00:37:05.090 --> 00:37:07.520
with this random oligo here

00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:11.970
and then incubate it for
15 minutes with RNAse P

00:37:11.970 --> 00:37:13.600
and run it out on a gel.

00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:16.900
It takes two hours perhaps.

00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:18.610
Develop the film on the gel

00:37:18.610 --> 00:37:20.490
and you will see immediately

00:37:20.490 --> 00:37:23.220
whether or not you had any cleavage.

00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:25.360
of the target RNA.

00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:28.530
And in fact, we've shown this

00:37:28.530 --> 00:37:32.350
prolifically over the last
couple years using this method.

00:37:32.350 --> 00:37:36.420
We've identified EGSes in
many different bacteria

00:37:37.470 --> 00:37:41.690
and they can be used for drug sensitivity

00:37:41.690 --> 00:37:46.340
to target pathogenic
regions in pathogenic RNA.

00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:48.063
It's a very convenient method.

00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:52.360
Now let's get to this new method

00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:54.420
which is the basic peptide's attached

00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:55.763
to morpholino oligos.

00:37:56.780 --> 00:37:58.300
This is a morpholino oligo.

00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:00.640
We see the phosphate linkages

00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:02.850
are not quite what you would expect.

00:38:02.850 --> 00:38:04.583
There's a nitrogen in here.

00:38:05.837 --> 00:38:09.000
This is a morpholino sugar in here,

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.490
a nitrogen in it.

00:38:10.490 --> 00:38:13.123
But the bases appear
as they usually appear.

00:38:16.082 --> 00:38:19.360
And the other aspect of using this

00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:22.030
is that the morpholinos
are tremendously resistant

00:38:22.030 --> 00:38:24.290
to nonspecific nucleases.

00:38:24.290 --> 00:38:27.650
So you can incubate them with human serum

00:38:27.650 --> 00:38:30.090
or bacterial growth medium

00:38:30.090 --> 00:38:32.950
and they don't get degraded
for at least 24 hours,

00:38:32.950 --> 00:38:34.840
probably much longer than that.

00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:36.800
And that's why we use them.

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:40.150
Now you attach a basic peptide at one end.

00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:42.060
And here it's 14

00:38:43.470 --> 00:38:44.640
amino acid residues.

00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:46.090
R is arginine.

00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:49.000
X is 6-aminohexanoic acid.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.030
So there are four repeats of this.

00:38:52.030 --> 00:38:54.990
X again and then beta-alanine.

00:38:54.990 --> 00:38:59.030
And this makes the covalent linkage

00:39:00.010 --> 00:39:03.563
very powerful in terms
of penetrating bacteria.

00:39:04.410 --> 00:39:08.490
We published this about a
year and a half ago or so.

00:39:08.490 --> 00:39:11.753
Let me just say that if we have,

00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:17.510
if we're looking at chloramphenicol
resistance in this case

00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:18.930
and we're using two EGSes

00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:22.870
which have been made
into morpholino oligos

00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:24.773
with a basic peptide attached,

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:29.320
these are control
bacteria after four hours.

00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:31.630
A scrambled oligo of the morpholino,

00:39:31.630 --> 00:39:34.690
so it's almost as good as the control.

00:39:34.690 --> 00:39:36.960
Two separate EGSes,

00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:39.380
and two EGSes together.

00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:41.730
So in this particular case,

00:39:41.730 --> 00:39:42.780
we're down around

00:39:45.378 --> 00:39:47.580
1/1000 of what we would've expected

00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:49.230
for the control bacteria

00:39:50.110 --> 00:39:53.773
which is actually a
very, very good number.

00:39:55.330 --> 00:39:58.090
So that's at 50 micromolar.

00:39:58.090 --> 00:39:59.610
When we do it with B. subtilis

00:39:59.610 --> 00:40:02.330
inactivating the gyrA gene in B. subtilis,

00:40:02.330 --> 00:40:05.417
we only need five micromolar of this.

00:40:05.417 --> 00:40:07.093
And we're down to about,

00:40:08.313 --> 00:40:12.100
in this case, only 0.2
of the viability of this.

00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:14.420
If we do this at 15 micromolar,

00:40:14.420 --> 00:40:17.463
we're down to about 1% of
the viability of the control.

00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:22.250
So that works extremely well.

00:40:22.250 --> 00:40:25.300
And let me just say in an experiment

00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:27.350
that was finished a couple weeks

00:40:27.350 --> 00:40:29.793
I'll just show some rough data.

00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:33.170
We are now doing the experiment

00:40:33.170 --> 00:40:35.420
with a different basic peptide.

00:40:35.420 --> 00:40:39.230
It's a basic peptide that has
been isolated from human cells

00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:41.920
that controls T cell regulation,

00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:44.860
and it's 22 amino acids long.

00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:46.430
It's written up here.

00:40:46.430 --> 00:40:48.360
It is also very basic and we've

00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:52.500
attached that to a morpholino oligo.

00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:55.100
And this chloramphenicol resistance.

00:40:55.100 --> 00:40:57.940
So we're down in the level between 1/1000

00:40:57.940 --> 00:41:01.700
and a 1/10,000 viability.

00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:04.340
Here, these are two
different preparations.

00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:06.990
This preparation is obviously much better.

00:41:06.990 --> 00:41:09.330
And that's what we're
working on at the moment.

00:41:09.330 --> 00:41:10.970
This is at five micromolar

00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:13.320
concentration

00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:15.560
of the particular
compound that I worked on,

00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:16.783
that I told you about.

00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:22.020
So that's a summary of
some of our recent data.

00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:26.520
I have some more data on some
molecular biological aspects

00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:28.430
of the morpholino oligos

00:41:28.430 --> 00:41:30.520
and how they interact
with sites in message,

00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:32.590
but I'm not gonna show that to you

00:41:32.590 --> 00:41:34.513
because it's getting late.

00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:38.600
And I'll just show you
this one other experiment

00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:41.960
which is an older summary of experiments

00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:44.513
in eukaryotic cells.

00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:48.523
I'm sure Fenyong will
recognize some of this.

00:41:49.431 --> 00:41:53.100
I'm not gonna talk about
cerevisae right now,

00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:57.580
but we can inhibit flu viruses
in mouse or canine cells

00:41:57.580 --> 00:42:00.810
by attacking two different
genes in the flu virus.

00:42:00.810 --> 00:42:03.670
Remember the flu virus has eight genes.

00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:07.280
And it also has eight
pieces of RNA in its genome.

00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:09.930
Each piece of RNA codes for a particular

00:42:09.930 --> 00:42:11.670
one of its genes.

00:42:11.670 --> 00:42:14.940
And by attacking both of
these particular genes

00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:19.180
we essentially can
inactivate flu virus by 100%.

00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:21.570
But I indicate 95% because there's

00:42:21.570 --> 00:42:24.373
a 5% error in our methods.

00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:29.210
These are essential proteins in E. coli,

00:42:29.210 --> 00:42:32.820
in HeLa cells, I won't talk
about them more at the moment.

00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:36.480
But Fenyong Liu has been
working for many years on

00:42:38.176 --> 00:42:40.973
cytomegalovirus in mice and in humans.

00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:43.730
Actually these are old data showing

00:42:43.730 --> 00:42:46.820
that he can inhibit these
particular functions.

00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:49.910
But I believe that he's
also been able to show the

00:42:51.220 --> 00:42:54.573
inhibition of live animals
under these conditions.

00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:59.000
And also herpes virus which he also did

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.070
in our lab a long time ago.

00:43:01.070 --> 00:43:02.800
So I think this is a very

00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:07.130
promising method to use,

00:43:07.130 --> 00:43:10.483
and one that's certainly worth studying.

00:43:11.370 --> 00:43:14.490
It is not necessarily

00:43:14.490 --> 00:43:17.140
adding to our molecular
biological knowledge

00:43:17.140 --> 00:43:20.060
of RNase P itself and what it's done.

00:43:20.060 --> 00:43:24.090
But it shows that RNase P can
be used in very useful ways,

00:43:24.090 --> 00:43:27.980
in this case, to attack
all kinds of disease.

00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:29.580
And with that I shall leave you.

00:43:31.189 --> 00:43:34.189
(audience applauds)

00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:38.890
- [Audience Member] Sid,
I'm curious how the basic

00:43:38.890 --> 00:43:41.860
peptide morpholino
penetrates into bacteria

00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:43.160
so efficiently.

00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:45.850
It's not the same kind of mechanism

00:43:45.850 --> 00:43:48.220
that basic peptides like TAT

00:43:48.220 --> 00:43:49.700
enter into mammalian cells.

00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:51.250
It must be something different.

00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:55.000
- I'm not sure it's very
different at all quite frankly.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:57.980
- [Audience Member] The
TAT peptide penetrates

00:43:57.980 --> 00:44:00.630
into mammalian cells by
first being internalized

00:44:00.630 --> 00:44:02.557
into an endosome and from the endosome --

00:44:02.557 --> 00:44:04.120
- Say the second half
of that sentence again.

00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:05.720
- [Audience Member] The TAT peptide,

00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:08.060
basic peptide, penetrates
into mammalian cells

00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:10.768
by first being internalized
into an endosome.

00:44:10.768 --> 00:44:11.601
- Okay.
- And then from there

00:44:11.601 --> 00:44:13.450
into the cytoplasm, that's not happening.

00:44:13.450 --> 00:44:15.453
- It's certainly not that, that's right.

00:44:17.290 --> 00:44:18.210
- [Audience Member] I'm curious about

00:44:18.210 --> 00:44:20.730
the toxicity and pharmacokinetics

00:44:20.730 --> 00:44:21.793
of these molecules.

00:44:23.030 --> 00:44:24.810
- I don't know anything the about it

00:44:24.810 --> 00:44:28.440
because I haven't done any
experiments with live animals.

00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:29.353
However,

00:44:30.410 --> 00:44:32.300
there are people have done experiments

00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:36.330
with these kinds of
compounds at AVI BioPharma

00:44:36.330 --> 00:44:41.180
which is a company now
located outside of Seattle.

00:44:41.180 --> 00:44:45.700
And they have cured infected
mice under these conditions,

00:44:45.700 --> 00:44:47.530
and the mice don't suffer at all

00:44:47.530 --> 00:44:49.240
under the conditions they used.

00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:51.840
They just survive for
several weeks afterwards.

00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:53.393
- [Audience Member] That's
encouraging, thanks.

00:44:54.750 --> 00:44:56.090
- [Audience Member] When
you showed the cleavage

00:44:56.090 --> 00:44:59.470
of some of the polycistronic
messenger RNAs in E. coli,

00:44:59.470 --> 00:45:01.833
I assume that was an in vitro experiment.

00:45:03.630 --> 00:45:05.610
- No, we've done it both ways.

00:45:05.610 --> 00:45:06.443
- Because it was--
- For--

00:45:06.443 --> 00:45:08.115
- [Audience Member] Pretty inefficient.

00:45:08.115 --> 00:45:10.940
It was only a few percent
of the intact transcript

00:45:10.940 --> 00:45:12.010
that was converted to product.

00:45:12.010 --> 00:45:12.843
So how do you expect there--

00:45:12.843 --> 00:45:15.350
- There are two different slides there.

00:45:15.350 --> 00:45:18.040
One was of several different operons.

00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:20.400
That was done in vivo, okay?

00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:22.560
And then we did the lac operon

00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:24.683
which was done in vitro and in vivo.

00:45:26.060 --> 00:45:27.450
- [Audience Member] But
it's only a few percent

00:45:27.450 --> 00:45:29.973
of the message even in vitro.

00:45:30.910 --> 00:45:32.690
Is it more efficient than vivo,

00:45:32.690 --> 00:45:35.623
the degree of cleavage
of the intact transcript?

00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:38.410
The full-length transcript persisted.

00:45:38.410 --> 00:45:41.180
You know 95% of it was still there after

00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:42.830
you know more than an hour incubation.

00:45:42.830 --> 00:45:43.930
- Well let me put it this way,

00:45:43.930 --> 00:45:45.460
with the lac operon,

00:45:45.460 --> 00:45:48.543
we completely destroy part
of the lac operon in vivo.

00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:51.150
- Okay?
- So it's more--

00:45:51.150 --> 00:45:53.370
- That was with a model system.

00:45:53.370 --> 00:45:54.690
Now the other,

00:45:54.690 --> 00:45:57.090
so I don't know what you
wanna say about that.

00:45:57.090 --> 00:45:59.300
With the other operons it is true

00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:01.190
that we don't have a good idea

00:46:01.190 --> 00:46:04.996
of the quantitative result
of those experiments.

00:46:04.996 --> 00:46:07.486
- [Audience Member] Okay.

00:46:07.486 --> 00:46:09.490
- [Audience Member] So
does the bacterial protein

00:46:09.490 --> 00:46:13.470
stimulate the RNA of Archaea and so forth.

00:46:13.470 --> 00:46:14.303
In other words,

00:46:14.303 --> 00:46:18.410
if you combine the
different proteins and RNAs

00:46:18.410 --> 00:46:20.083
are the proteins still active?

00:46:21.450 --> 00:46:22.980
- Which protein?

00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:25.580
- [Audience Member] The RNAse P protein.

00:46:25.580 --> 00:46:28.830
So immediately, does the RNAse P protein

00:46:28.830 --> 00:46:30.480
from E. coli for example,

00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:33.140
stimulate the RNA

00:46:33.140 --> 00:46:37.270
of RNAse P from Archaea and so forth?

00:46:37.270 --> 00:46:39.040
- Well if you're talking about experiments

00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:41.590
using an EGS to--

00:46:41.590 --> 00:46:42.990
- [Audience Member] No,
no, this is going back

00:46:42.990 --> 00:46:44.680
to the beginning of your talk.

00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:47.340
- Well just under normal conditions?

00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:48.780
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:51.290
The amount of P protein for RNAse P,

00:46:51.290 --> 00:46:55.630
there are about 400 to
500 copies in the cell.

00:46:55.630 --> 00:46:58.130
And if you try and activate RNAse P

00:46:58.130 --> 00:47:01.360
by attacking the message for the P protein

00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:02.850
which we have done,

00:47:02.850 --> 00:47:03.683
it actually takes

00:47:03.683 --> 00:47:06.940
several more hours to kill those bacteria

00:47:06.940 --> 00:47:08.220
than it does for example,

00:47:08.220 --> 00:47:11.930
to just change chloramphenicol
resistance to sensitivity

00:47:11.930 --> 00:47:15.390
because you have to deplete that reservoir

00:47:15.390 --> 00:47:18.620
until you're down to maybe
20 molecules per cell

00:47:18.620 --> 00:47:20.870
which is apparently not enough

00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:22.453
to keep the molecules going.

00:47:24.054 --> 00:47:25.620
- [Audience Member] EGS,
what needs to be done

00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:29.110
to bring EGS as a therapeutic technology

00:47:29.110 --> 00:47:31.190
in the--
- Somebody has to provide

00:47:31.190 --> 00:47:33.230
a few million dollars

00:47:33.230 --> 00:47:34.610
to set up a company to

00:47:36.140 --> 00:47:39.840
investigate this for commercial purposes

00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:42.360
and to build a reasonable system

00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:45.500
for delivering the covalent linkage

00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:47.450
of the basic peptide to the morpholino.

00:47:48.620 --> 00:47:51.330
So I don't know anybody
with a few million dollars

00:47:51.330 --> 00:47:53.030
who's willing to do that.

00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:55.680
And I'm not a great entrepreneur,

00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:57.563
so I can't do anything about it.

00:47:58.410 --> 00:47:59.243
- [Audience Member] I
have a follow-up question.

00:47:59.243 --> 00:48:02.010
Is it easier to design an EGS for viruses

00:48:03.010 --> 00:48:04.273
as opposed to cancers?

00:48:05.287 --> 00:48:06.930
- In concept and in principle, you could

00:48:06.930 --> 00:48:09.290
for a virus, certainly for viruses.

00:48:09.290 --> 00:48:11.003
And that's what Fenyong is doing.

00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:14.153
- [Audience Member] Well, I wanna follow

00:48:14.153 --> 00:48:16.010
was Stu's question.

00:48:16.010 --> 00:48:18.380
How much we know about the biogenesis

00:48:18.380 --> 00:48:21.437
of the enzyme in terms of the RNA subunit

00:48:21.437 --> 00:48:23.520
and the protein subunit in E. coli?

00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:25.380
- Just a minute, could you stand

00:48:25.380 --> 00:48:27.100
a little bit further
back from the microphone?

00:48:27.100 --> 00:48:28.940
Not that far back, okay.

00:48:28.940 --> 00:48:32.250
- [Audience Member] So much
we know about the biogenesis

00:48:32.250 --> 00:48:36.330
of the RNA and protein
subunits in E. coli?

00:48:36.330 --> 00:48:39.280
I mean specifically when the bacteria grow

00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:41.908
under different conditions
like under stress

00:48:41.908 --> 00:48:44.420
or under rich medium.

00:48:44.420 --> 00:48:46.811
Do we see any--
- For the protein?

00:48:46.811 --> 00:48:47.990
- [Audience Member] As
well as the RNA subunit.

00:48:47.990 --> 00:48:50.650
- Okay.
- Is there any regulation?

00:48:50.650 --> 00:48:52.850
- The protein is made in an operon

00:48:53.930 --> 00:48:56.153
with some ribosomal proteins in it.

00:48:58.570 --> 00:49:02.070
Supposedly there is a binding,

00:49:02.070 --> 00:49:05.932
the sequence of the
upstream part of that operon

00:49:05.932 --> 00:49:10.320
has a binding site for the RNA subunits.

00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:11.950
But we've done a number of experiments

00:49:11.950 --> 00:49:13.450
in which we tried to regulate

00:49:13.450 --> 00:49:16.630
the amount of RNA and
the protein in E. coli

00:49:16.630 --> 00:49:19.040
and none of them have worked.

00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:20.093
That is to say,

00:49:21.150 --> 00:49:22.490
changing the amount of RNA

00:49:22.490 --> 00:49:23.930
doesn't change the amount of protein.

00:49:23.930 --> 00:49:25.100
Changing the amount of protein

00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:26.570
doesn't change the amount of RNA.

00:49:26.570 --> 00:49:28.470
That's about all I can say about that.

00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:32.190
Is that what you wanted to know?

00:49:32.190 --> 00:49:33.090
- [Audience Member] Because I'm wondering

00:49:33.090 --> 00:49:35.270
whether the tRNA synthesis

00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:38.393
is affected by that?
- Oh, that's a separate issue.

00:49:40.290 --> 00:49:44.933
The RNA subunit is under
relaxed stringent control.

00:49:47.100 --> 00:49:50.750
And I think so is the protein subunit.

00:49:50.750 --> 00:49:54.110
So if you starve the cells for amino acids

00:49:54.110 --> 00:49:56.320
or they go into stationary phase,

00:49:56.320 --> 00:49:59.903
you stop making both the
RNA and the protein subunit.

00:49:59.903 --> 00:50:01.380
- [Audience Member] Interesting.

00:50:01.380 --> 00:50:02.980
- [Fenyong] Please join me

00:50:02.980 --> 00:50:05.330
in thanking Professor Altman

00:50:05.330 --> 00:50:07.063
for a wonderful lecture today.

00:50:08.010 --> 00:50:11.482
(audience applauds)
- Thank you.

00:50:11.482 --> 00:50:14.065
(bright music)
