1
00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:02.083
Okay.

2
00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:03.830
<v 1>Hey,
what's going on?
It's Bill Burr.</v>

3
00:00:03.831 --> 00:00:06.710
It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

4
00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.720
February 25th,

5
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.290
2019 what's going on?
How,
why?
Yeah,

6
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.290
I'm recording this in New York City right before I get on a plane,

7
00:00:18.291 --> 00:00:21.140
they go fly to London.
Um,

8
00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:26.170
do my little run through a the U K tape my special and then come home and I

9
00:00:26.461 --> 00:00:31.280
ain't doin shit.
[inaudible] Shit,
I'm taping this Sunday,

10
00:00:31.281 --> 00:00:35.450
the 24th.
I'm tough day.
Definitely a tough day.

11
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.240
They have in this memorial for a Steven Brody Stevens,
um,

12
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.480
tonight at the comedy store.

13
00:00:41.481 --> 00:00:46.340
And unfortunately I'm in New York and I can't be there and I'm crushed that I

14
00:00:46.341 --> 00:00:50.930
can't be there and say all the things I would have liked to have said,

15
00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.590
which really is the strange thing about when somebody dies.

16
00:00:54.591 --> 00:00:57.560
Do you ever notice when somebody dies then you somehow,
immediately,

17
00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.920
no emotionally exactly what you wished you have,

18
00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.400
you would have said to the person,
it's really weird,

19
00:01:04.401 --> 00:01:08.180
but I kind of get it because that's a heavy thing to do to somebody.
Like,

20
00:01:08.181 --> 00:01:10.670
what would I say to this person if I knew they were going to die tomorrow?

21
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.350
If you just fucking hit them with that,

22
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.390
whether it's sitting there eating a fucking Cobb salad,

23
00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:16.820
they're going to be looking at you like,
whoa dude.
Hey,

24
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.720
let's try to keep it light here.
Okay.
Um,
but yeah,

25
00:01:21.721 --> 00:01:25.640
I just,
that fucking guy,
my God,
that fucking guy,

26
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.770
that guy made me laugh.

27
00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.860
Like I don't even know how to describe it.
TheW and,
and it was the way,

28
00:01:32.861 --> 00:01:37.060
like nobody ever made me laugh that hard.
The way he made me laugh,

29
00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.530
it was completely 100%.

30
00:01:41.531 --> 00:01:46.030
Just a unique,
unique,
unique sense of humor.
Um,

31
00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.600
just really,
you know what's funny is I've been,

32
00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:54.430
I've been talking to all of these comics of bottom over the last couple of days

33
00:01:54.431 --> 00:01:58.000
here and we're all like quoting his jokes and it's like,
if you don't know Brody,

34
00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:59.060
it's,

35
00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.530
it's kind of like he kind of have to know him and he kinda had to be familiar

36
00:02:02.531 --> 00:02:07.150
with this act to underst cause it was his fucking cadence half the time.

37
00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.200
Like,
um,
it's a good example.

38
00:02:11.201 --> 00:02:12.940
I remember one time I was down at the comedy store,

39
00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.370
we were in the main room and I was with my wife,

40
00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.820
Nia and Brody went on stage and I swear to God that fucking genius went on stage

41
00:02:21.881 --> 00:02:26.881
and for 10 minutes described his dream apartment and there was no set ups,

42
00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:31.660
no punchlines.

43
00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.130
He was just describing and in like this sort of,

44
00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.820
I can't even,

45
00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.820
it was like Zillow speak meets like this amazing comedic cadence.

46
00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.750
I,
I don't even,
I can't even remember what he said.
Me and Nia,

47
00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.430
we're just looking at each other and were just dying laughing and I just,

48
00:02:51.431 --> 00:02:54.700
it was like,
you know,
ceiling to floor windows,

49
00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.940
stepping down into the living room.

50
00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.510
And when he said that wife literally almost fell out of her chair.

51
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.780
I know this won't seem funny to a lot of you because you didn't know him and

52
00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.860
nobody can recreate what that the way that that guy did what he did.

53
00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.650
But when he said stepping down into the living room,

54
00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:16.330
like I just put my head down on the table and was crying,

55
00:03:16.331 --> 00:03:17.800
laughing at the same time.

56
00:03:17.801 --> 00:03:22.090
Also for the first time ever in my life noticing,

57
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.970
um,
how much reverence,
if that's the right word,
that I held anybody,
Eh,

58
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:32.140
like any room that you stepped down in,
into,

59
00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.070
in an apartment is unbelievably classy.

60
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.380
And I had no idea that I thought that.

61
00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.590
And I think the whole crowd along with me suddenly realized in that moment that

62
00:03:43.751 --> 00:03:48.751
like we all felt that and had never expressed it and Brody had just expressed it

63
00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.021
and,

64
00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:55.021
and he acted out stepping down and he sort of crouched into the living room and,

65
00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.010
uh,
it was just amazing,
you know?
And it wasn't,
and also to like,

66
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:05.440
probably behind all of that on the underneath was the sadness of,
of,
of,

67
00:04:05.441 --> 00:04:05.681
you know,

68
00:04:05.681 --> 00:04:08.860
like what he wanted and was he going to get it and all of that type of stuff

69
00:04:08.861 --> 00:04:13.630
that was just very relatable.
And um,
I don't know,

70
00:04:13.631 --> 00:04:15.250
man.
It's like,
I have this weird,

71
00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.840
this is a weird one where I'm really sad selfishly from myself,

72
00:04:19.841 --> 00:04:24.640
but I'm not like,
I don't know,
I'm not the most spiritual guy,
but I just,

73
00:04:24.641 --> 00:04:29.260
I feel like,
you know,
his,
his journey was like complete,

74
00:04:29.261 --> 00:04:33.370
I guess,
you know,
that's how I have to look at it or else it becomes too sad.

75
00:04:33.371 --> 00:04:37.990
And when I really look at how we affected everybody and just the fucking

76
00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.630
outpouring that was on,
um,

77
00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.140
Twitter and I'll cite t would have been that,
you know,
that he,

78
00:04:44.141 --> 00:04:48.160
that he was trending on Twitter for two days now.
Um,

79
00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.400
I dunno,
it was just,
it was really that,

80
00:04:51.401 --> 00:04:55.390
that part of it was like a cool thing to see.
And I,
I used to,

81
00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:59.950
I tried to sit down and watch that show that he did with,

82
00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.680
uh,
Zach Galifianakis,
by the way,
shout out to Zach for loaning his name,

83
00:05:05.681 --> 00:05:08.890
but that,
so Brody could do that show.
And um,

84
00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.160
it was just too soon to sit there and watch it and watch them struggle.

85
00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.700
I just can't imagine having them,
um,
a mental illness

86
00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:22.230
where you just literally just walking around fighting your own brain and the way

87
00:05:23.201 --> 00:05:27.730
that he was able to do that and not lash out at other people and just be so kind

88
00:05:27.731 --> 00:05:32.620
and so sweet to everybody and it just so fucking funny,
man.
It's like,

89
00:05:32.621 --> 00:05:37.540
it's really,
it's,
it's an end of an era in,

90
00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.153
um,

91
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.090
at the comedy store like this and there's really not going to be,

92
00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.360
there's not idea.
There's no,
there was nobody before after him that that was,

93
00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.500
that was like that guy.
And furthermore,
he truly,

94
00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:57.120
in the purest sense was a,
um,

95
00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:02.710
was it comic's comic where a lot of times that gets thrown around,

96
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:07.640
Oh,
this guy's a comic comic or she's comic's comic and it's somebody that's also

97
00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:13.640
selling a lot of tickets.
It's almost like,
it means it's a comedian that made it,

98
00:06:13.641 --> 00:06:18.641
but other comedians still like that person and don't resent their success is

99
00:06:20.811 --> 00:06:25.760
sort of the way a comic's comic is sort of the,
I guess definition of it,

100
00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:27.140
if the way I kind of see it.

101
00:06:27.141 --> 00:06:32.120
But Brody was he,
he was,

102
00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:36.590
he was a comic's comic in that he was really for us,

103
00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:42.350
like the wait staff and people that manage comics and people who had watched

104
00:06:42.351 --> 00:06:47.351
that amount of comedy to understand how unique he was and how different it was.

105
00:06:48.381 --> 00:06:51.380
And I love going on the Internet now and all these people were just discovering

106
00:06:51.381 --> 00:06:53.540
them and some people get numb,
but there's a lot of people being like,

107
00:06:53.541 --> 00:06:57.260
this guy is funny,
this guy sucks.
Um,
I'm sure you guys are sad but this guy,

108
00:06:57.261 --> 00:07:00.470
so that makes me feel even better.
It's like,
yeah,
you don't get it.

109
00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:04.850
You don't get it.
Cause you're not a fucking comedian and you just have like,

110
00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:09.130
you know where your comedic air is.
Tay.

111
00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:11.330
Two guys walk into a bar and the rabbi says like,

112
00:07:11.331 --> 00:07:12.800
you're not going to get this fucking guy.

113
00:07:12.801 --> 00:07:16.520
Like you have to watch a lot of comedy to see,
um,

114
00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:21.560
how funny this guy was.
And uh,
um,
I'm really gonna miss him in,
Oh man.

115
00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:25.400
I remember when I was doing a,
I was,
what was it,

116
00:07:25.401 --> 00:07:29.930
the odd ball,
the odd ball tour.
And,

117
00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:34.720
uh,
I had gone on,
the crowd was fucking,
you know,
it was like,
I don't know,

118
00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:35.301
fucking eight,

119
00:07:35.301 --> 00:07:39.620
9,000 people and it was shit and it's just a such a rush to be on in front of.

120
00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:44.270
And Brody was hosting and Chris Delea was going on next.

121
00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:48.860
And uh,
I've always loved Chris.
Like he just was like,
you know,

122
00:07:48.861 --> 00:07:53.861
he reminded me of like a Boston comic word as far as like he could get up in

123
00:07:54.081 --> 00:07:57.680
front of from early on,
get up in front of a big crowd and kill it.

124
00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:02.060
A level that was considering headlining the way I learned what it sounds like,

125
00:08:02.061 --> 00:08:06.080
what killing sounded like he was doing.
So,

126
00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:10.850
um,
you know,
he was on his way out and I was saying,
Oh,

127
00:08:10.851 --> 00:08:13.070
do you wait to go out there?
It's going to be fucking amazing.

128
00:08:13.071 --> 00:08:17.240
I sit and I asked him,
I was like,
you want me to take a picture?
Uh,

129
00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:18.580
or I didn't know if I asked him,
whatever.

130
00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:23.120
So he was walking out and I wanted to take a picture of Chris right when he got

131
00:08:23.121 --> 00:08:26.330
to the microphone because the lights were up and you could see how big the crowd

132
00:08:26.331 --> 00:08:30.080
was and I thought it'd be a cool thing for him to have and retweet or whatever.

133
00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:33.710
And I was just focused on Chris.
Right.

134
00:08:33.711 --> 00:08:38.711
And Brody it done the fucking intro and I didn't realize he was in frame when it

135
00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:40.790
,

136
00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:45.790
cause I was just looking at Chris to try and frame it and I like the picture and

137
00:08:47.361 --> 00:08:51.680
I was unaware that Steven did this,
you know with his baseball background,

138
00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:56.820
he has a pitcher and I forget what he,
Arizona,
Arizona State,

139
00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:59.820
I think it was Arizona State,
I'm not sure.
And He,
you don't,

140
00:08:59.821 --> 00:09:01.650
you know that warm up that pitchers do.

141
00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:04.680
Like when we see like spring training before the game where they're walking and

142
00:09:04.681 --> 00:09:09.330
they put their hand out like straight out in front of them and like above their

143
00:09:09.331 --> 00:09:13.350
head and then they just kick their leg up with their toe,
their Clita,

144
00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:16.530
their toe touches their hand.
I guess he used to do that.
I,

145
00:09:16.531 --> 00:09:19.680
that was the first time I ever saw him do it and when I click the photo,

146
00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:24.710
he was walking off stage doing that and he had literally kicked his foot.

147
00:09:24.811 --> 00:09:27.360
Was that the apex almost touching his hand with his,

148
00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:32.160
his head tucked down a little bit and I,

149
00:09:32.161 --> 00:09:36.060
it just,
I saw that and I just thought it just,
it was just so him,

150
00:09:36.061 --> 00:09:39.030
I just started fucking laughing and I was just as a comedian,

151
00:09:39.031 --> 00:09:43.410
like why did he do that?
Was was that for the crowd?

152
00:09:43.411 --> 00:09:44.460
Was that for him?

153
00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:49.500
What was the person in the crowd as they're watching Krista Leah walking on

154
00:09:49.501 --> 00:09:54.090
stage and then in the peripheral they just see this guy walking off kicking his

155
00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:57.090
head is fucking phone up to his head,

156
00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:00.060
like a spring training fucking picture and the,

157
00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:03.660
and the grapefruit league and for the rest of that fucking Tor,

158
00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:07.200
you know,
when you know,
you get lonely on the road,

159
00:10:07.201 --> 00:10:10.320
I would just look at that picture and I would just die laughing.

160
00:10:10.321 --> 00:10:14.370
And so many people that I showed who weren't in standup didn't understand why

161
00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:17.400
they would just sort of like,
wow,
that guy can kick his foot up high or whatever.

162
00:10:17.401 --> 00:10:20.880
They didn't get it or it wasn't hitting them the way it was hitting me,

163
00:10:20.881 --> 00:10:25.260
but I just,
um,
I don't know,
man.
Uh,

164
00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:29.370
I don't know what else to say.
I just,
I just,
uh,
it's just,

165
00:10:29.371 --> 00:10:33.690
it's really obviously really sad,
but he just was,
I don't know,

166
00:10:33.691 --> 00:10:37.200
the way that guy touched me by what he did.
I have this weird sort of,

167
00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:39.880
<v 2>mmm.</v>

168
00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:43.120
<v 1>I Dunno.
I can't yet,
definitely am really,
really sad,</v>

169
00:10:43.121 --> 00:10:47.170
but it's not that same kind of sadness.
I,
and I'm not the most spiritual guy,

170
00:10:47.171 --> 00:10:52.090
but if there's,
if there's anything,
he's there,
you know,
after this.
Cause,
uh,

171
00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:54.601
I dunno,
I,

172
00:10:54.601 --> 00:10:58.690
I never heard anybody say one bad fucking word about that guy who's always such

173
00:10:58.691 --> 00:11:02.800
a night and he's fucking hilarious and all that.
So anyways,

174
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.590
there goes another one,
so.

175
00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:08.160
<v 2>MMM.</v>

176
00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:12.390
<v 1>I Dunno,
I guess,
I don't know.
He would get frustrated.
I mean the whole fucking,</v>

177
00:11:12.391 --> 00:11:17.391
his whole thing is just like his whole life was like an Oscar winning movie as

178
00:11:18.551 --> 00:11:20.290
far as the way he battled,

179
00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:25.000
like what he battled and our positive.
He stayed

180
00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:32.960
and like I always wondered like what that what it was like for him to have all

181
00:11:32.961 --> 00:11:36.290
like the best comics being like,
dude,
you're like one of the funniest guys ever.

182
00:11:36.291 --> 00:11:40.970
And then not getting that from the mainstream in a while,

183
00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:44.210
you know,
battling all that other shit.
I mean,

184
00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:49.160
and then to not turn bitter and not be a fucking asshole.
It's unbelievable.

185
00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:50.750
It really is.
So

186
00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:56.410
I now that like his life is complete,
like kind of looking back on it,

187
00:11:57.310 --> 00:12:01.300
it was like,
it was weird.
Like,
yeah,
he was on his,

188
00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:06.100
what's that grateful dead song?
It reminded me of that,
you know,

189
00:12:06.101 --> 00:12:10.960
that that song ripple the way they say,
uh,

190
00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.720
what the fuck,
how does that lyric go?
Let me look this up here.

191
00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:17.350
It says there,
there's a road,

192
00:12:17.351 --> 00:12:21.340
no simple highway between the dawn and the dark at night.

193
00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:27.040
And if you go,
no one may follow.
That path is meant for your steps alone.

194
00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:32.210
Yeah.
I feel like if they ever do like a documentary,

195
00:12:32.211 --> 00:12:34.880
which I'm sure they're going to like,
that should be,

196
00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:39.380
that should be the tone because I don't know,

197
00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:41.920
I don't know if I'm saying this right,
but like,

198
00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:47.200
I dunno what that guy did was just so fucking unique in this.

199
00:12:47.201 --> 00:12:52.180
There's a loneliness to be in that fucking unique.
And the fact,

200
00:12:52.181 --> 00:12:52.691
like I said,

201
00:12:52.691 --> 00:12:55.930
that he didn't turn into a fucking asshole about it and was just so nice and

202
00:12:55.931 --> 00:13:00.130
supportive to everybody.
You know?
I don't know.

203
00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:04.540
I don't measure up to that,
put it that way.
So

204
00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:11.050
thank you to Brody Stevens and all of that.
Steven Brody,
Stevens,

205
00:13:11.051 --> 00:13:15.820
all those fucking times you made me laugh and everybody else.
And,

206
00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:20.770
uh,
I dunno.
I think for the rest of my life,
I'm going to be going to,

207
00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:25.630
yes,
you got it.
It just feels good to say it.

208
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.410
I,
I mean,
half of my conversations I think I had with him,

209
00:13:29.411 --> 00:13:34.280
sadly enough was just me imitating him.
It was,

210
00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:38.500
he was so fun.
I would just start talking,
talking like him.

211
00:13:38.501 --> 00:13:42.720
So anyways,
uh,
that's my 2 cents.
And,
um,

212
00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:46.420
there's a bunch of clips of them.
If this made you interested,
uh,

213
00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:50.770
definitely look them up.
And,
uh,
all right.

214
00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:54.070
I guess I don't know where the fuck do you go from there?
Jesus Christ,
Dude.
Like,

215
00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:56.110
<v 2>okay.</v>

216
00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:59.360
<v 1>Oh,
is this what being old is now?</v>

217
00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:01.210
I mean it's just fucking every bike

218
00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:06.550
to comics die more than other people because I,
I,
you know,

219
00:14:06.551 --> 00:14:09.760
I have a whole list of everybody that died cause I don't want to forget them and

220
00:14:09.761 --> 00:14:12.040
I'm up to like fucking 32 comedians.

221
00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:14.703
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

222
00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:18.230
<v 1>All guys to every single one of them.</v>

223
00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:21.560
I'll tell you for all the bitch in the women are doing and stand up,

224
00:14:21.561 --> 00:14:22.700
at least you're still alive.

225
00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:30.380
You can still do sets.
Um,

226
00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:33.710
I was actually talking to de Rosa and we would just,

227
00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:38.760
we would tell him Steven Brody Stevens fucking stories.

228
00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:44.590
Um,
it's the weirdest thing like on this,
cause all these people that have died,

229
00:14:44.591 --> 00:14:46.660
there's always been like a sadness of blah,
blah,
blah.

230
00:14:46.661 --> 00:14:50.830
And with everybody I've talked to about,

231
00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:56.060
it's like you end up crying,
laughing,
telling stories rather than crying,

232
00:14:56.061 --> 00:15:00.980
crying,
you know,
and we were trying to remember his,
another guy,

233
00:15:00.981 --> 00:15:04.340
you should look up as far as like,
just fucking hilarious.
Who Died?

234
00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:06.740
<v 2>MMM.</v>

235
00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:10.790
<v 1>Is it a comic?
Rasheed Thurmond,
t H.
U.
R m.
O.
N.
D.</v>

236
00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:15.350
And he died right when I went to La and I remember a young guy to like 36 37

237
00:15:15.351 --> 00:15:17.900
years old.
It was another,
another great one.

238
00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:22.370
So anyways,
where the fuck did you go from there?
Um,

239
00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:25.710
I've been running my set here in New York City,
New York City,

240
00:15:25.711 --> 00:15:29.010
one of the most caring comedy crowds.

241
00:15:29.011 --> 00:15:31.530
You're going to be in front of Jesus Christ.

242
00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:37.590
I swear.
I feel like a three year comic when I perform in New York City.

243
00:15:37.591 --> 00:15:42.270
Now I don't know what the fuck is going on.

244
00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:46.120
Um,
part of it's me because of this,

245
00:15:46.121 --> 00:15:48.880
the overly sensitive fucking horse shit that's going on.

246
00:15:48.881 --> 00:15:52.870
It's forcing me to go in the other direction.

247
00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:54.210
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

248
00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:57.510
<v 1>You know,
to just,
it's just,
it's still,
you know,</v>

249
00:15:57.630 --> 00:16:02.020
it's the balance of the universe.
It's like if,

250
00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:07.040
if you're going to fucking
try to push me in this,
this direction,

251
00:16:07.041 --> 00:16:10.630
I'm going to fucking go in the other one.
Like if you,

252
00:16:10.631 --> 00:16:13.690
if you back off then I'm not going to be as much of an asshole on stage,

253
00:16:13.691 --> 00:16:16.210
but if you're going to be fucking sitting there and getting in my grill every

254
00:16:16.211 --> 00:16:18.850
time I fucking say something,
it makes you,

255
00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:23.780
it makes sure go hopefully even further in the other direction because comics

256
00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:27.950
are telling me they're going on stage out here and see other comedians in front

257
00:16:27.951 --> 00:16:30.640
of just a regular crowd.
It's not a benefit.
Like again,

258
00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:33.710
if you're doing a cancer benefit,
they go,
hey,
just don't do any cancer jokes.

259
00:16:33.711 --> 00:16:36.980
I get that,
but it's just a comedy show.
And they go and don't talk about this.

260
00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:39.710
Don't talk about that.
They'll talk about get these fucking,

261
00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:42.523
<v 2>these</v>

262
00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:47.650
<v 1>people are going to undo everything that Lenny Carlin and prior these guys went</v>

263
00:16:48.621 --> 00:16:53.390
to jail.
They went to jail.
So,
you know,

264
00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:56.180
and because they did that,
believe it or not,

265
00:16:56.210 --> 00:16:59.720
a lot of these female comics that are onstage now talking about their fucking

266
00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:04.040
vaginas for 45 minutes,
you wouldn't be able to do that if it wasn't for them.

267
00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:08.870
And now it's becoming this fucking thing where,
I don't know,
I don't,

268
00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:12.920
I really just am baffled and every time I think like,
okay,

269
00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:18.050
well we're going to come out of this ridiculously childish time and stand up

270
00:17:18.671 --> 00:17:22.720
where,
where everybody is acting like comedians of all of a sudden presenting

271
00:17:22.721 --> 00:17:27.721
legislation that is going to be turned into law rather than,

272
00:17:27.971 --> 00:17:30.580
it's just up this somebody just,
just being an idiot.

273
00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:32.443
<v 2>MMM.</v>

274
00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:37.390
<v 1>I Dunno,
I was doing this
some fucking club.</v>

275
00:17:37.391 --> 00:17:40.820
I'm not going to say the club was to the club and like,
uh,

276
00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:44.620
I was making fun of white women how they act like they're oppressed.

277
00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:47.260
You know what I mean?
When they're really just sitting in the Jacuzzi with me,

278
00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:48.123
you know,

279
00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:53.220
how they get sidestep their white privilege because they weren't allowed to vote

280
00:17:53.221 --> 00:17:56.970
90 years ago,
you know?
So,
um,
oh,

281
00:17:56.971 --> 00:17:59.730
just got the right to vote 90 years ago or whatever the fuck a hundred years
ago.

282
00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:01.920
Um,
you know,

283
00:18:01.921 --> 00:18:05.580
obviously just being a dick and this white woman in the crowd just goes,

284
00:18:05.581 --> 00:18:10.230
I just got,
yeah,
just like that.
Right.

285
00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:15.270
And uh,
I'm like that.
That's all you got is he's like what?

286
00:18:15.271 --> 00:18:20.070
I had to say it like she's literally patting yourself on the back for how brave

287
00:18:20.071 --> 00:18:21.330
she was.
The one is fucking hilarious.

288
00:18:21.331 --> 00:18:26.331
Who's just like the complete lack of passion and fire.

289
00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:29.310
The way she protested what I said just,

290
00:18:29.311 --> 00:18:33.960
it just really shows like how unaffected you are.
Bye Bye.
Bye.

291
00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:36.450
Whatever the fuck it is you're complaining about.
You know what I mean?

292
00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:39.990
Truly oppressed people when they heckle.
When you say you crossed the line,

293
00:18:39.991 --> 00:18:44.520
when they fucking heckle you,
you feel like,
oh fuck,
I went too far.
It isn't,

294
00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:47.130
you don't sound like I was saying she sound like she was down the bottom of a

295
00:18:47.131 --> 00:18:47.964
well.

296
00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:59.340
So anyways,
I dunno,

297
00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:03.540
I was not bringing these Steven Brody Stevens positive vibes to that show.

298
00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:07.050
I was a,
I was being a bit of a Dick.
So whatever I'll,
I'll take,

299
00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:11.790
I always take my 50% of it,
you know.
Um,
so anyways,

300
00:19:11.791 --> 00:19:15.420
I go on to London today.
Let's look up where old freckles is going to be.

301
00:19:15.421 --> 00:19:18.840
I don't even know.
I think I started Liverpool,
which I'm very excited about.

302
00:19:18.841 --> 00:19:23.730
She loves you.
Yay Liverpool.
Right?
That's where a the four fucking

303
00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:30.000
uh,
Marchetti cancer from the Beatles.
Let's see here.

304
00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:33.390
Let's go to my website.
[inaudible] dot com everybody,

305
00:19:33.391 --> 00:19:37.950
if you're following along in your program,
Bill bird.com I'm going to be,
yes,

306
00:19:37.951 --> 00:19:42.600
I'll be in Liverpool.
Oh,
would you look at that?
Not until the 26th.

307
00:19:42.601 --> 00:19:46.830
So I actually get an extra day here.
I fly today.
Today's the 24th.

308
00:19:46.831 --> 00:19:50.070
By the time I land will be the 25th.
That gives me a chance to fucking chill out.

309
00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:51.540
I'm there for two days.

310
00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:57.270
Rumor has it most salads coming to the show.
Kidding.

311
00:19:57.750 --> 00:20:02.610
I really fell out following the fucking soccer.
I tried.
I fucking tried.

312
00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:07.020
Um,
Jim Breuer has the funniest fucking bit about Americans trying to get into

313
00:20:07.021 --> 00:20:11.280
soccer.
Go once every four years.
You try to get into it,

314
00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:16.680
you buy the Jersey and he just starts imitating them flopping all over the
place.

315
00:20:16.681 --> 00:20:19.230
But I will say this,
I do really,

316
00:20:19.231 --> 00:20:22.740
really enjoy this sport now and I do see the beauty in the skill and all of that

317
00:20:22.741 --> 00:20:27.180
shit now.
Like,
you know,
I'm not 100% the stupid Yank,

318
00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:31.620
making fun of the world's most popular sport and uh,

319
00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:36.450
it is an all faking because I saw a moat sallow a couple of times on a

320
00:20:36.451 --> 00:20:38.070
breakaway.
That's what they call it,
the hockey,

321
00:20:38.071 --> 00:20:42.960
I don't know what the fuck they call it in,
uh,
in your football over there.

322
00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:46.980
But like he's,
you know,
in the clear in this guy just runs up behind him.

323
00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:50.350
He just sticks his leg out and dragged his clique down the back of his fucking

324
00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:53.500
calf.
But what was funny,
cause he was on the breakaway,

325
00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:57.340
most shook it off and then kick the [inaudible] kicked it in the net.

326
00:20:57.341 --> 00:21:01.240
But if he was anywhere else,
he would've collapsed on the field,
like he got shot.

327
00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:03.100
Although,
you know,
having said all that,

328
00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:06.930
I would not want somebody to do that to me.
So it's,
it's not all,
uh,

329
00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:12.290
it's not all faking.
So I'm in Liverpool and the 26th and the 27th,

330
00:21:12.291 --> 00:21:16.790
28th them in Glasgow,
uh,

331
00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:18.830
and then the 29th,
I'm off.

332
00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:23.890
And then the f the first and second I'm in Birmingham and then Manchester,

333
00:21:25.461 --> 00:21:29.240
legendary Manchester.
Uh,

334
00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:33.820
and then where it,
Yo,
and then I have two days off.

335
00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:37.690
What the fuck?
Then I get two days off and then I,
I,

336
00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:42.150
I'm at Royal Albert Hall on the fourth and fifth taping my neck stand up
special.

337
00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:47.250
And um,
you know what I was,

338
00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:48.300
uh,

339
00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:53.300
watching all these clips on Steven Brody Stevens and I came across,

340
00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:58.320
I went to his Instagram and all of that stuff and uh,

341
00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:01.220
I was watching,
I don't know,

342
00:22:01.221 --> 00:22:06.221
somehow I ended up coming across this quote that Zach Galifianakis had that I'm

343
00:22:06.321 --> 00:22:09.740
really going to take to heart because I've been just working my fucking ass off.

344
00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:15.410
And it was basically saying,
you know,
don't feel like you have to be,
you know,

345
00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:19.460
working all the fucking time.
I don't,
I can't paraphrase,

346
00:22:19.461 --> 00:22:22.370
he said it perfectly of course,
but I kind of took it to heart like,

347
00:22:22.371 --> 00:22:26.180
you know what if I just fucking chilled out for a couple of weeks?

348
00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:31.490
Um,

349
00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:35.370
I got that German Irish thing where you just go until one day you fucking like,

350
00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:36.840
oh,
what's that pain in my chest?

351
00:22:36.841 --> 00:22:39.830
And then you just fall forward into your fucking mushy peas and then that's it.

352
00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:44.880
MMM.
So I'm going to try to,
uh,

353
00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:47.730
I'm going to try to be around for a few mean I don't know how long I could do it

354
00:22:47.731 --> 00:22:51.360
because there is a part of me that goes fucking nuts after four days of not

355
00:22:51.361 --> 00:22:53.250
doing stand up.
But,
uh,

356
00:22:53.251 --> 00:22:57.570
I think I'm going to go a little bit easy here over the next couple of months

357
00:22:57.660 --> 00:23:00.660
and rather than just run out,
because what I usually do is I immediately,

358
00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:03.930
I'll take like two days off after I do a special and I really immediately get

359
00:23:03.931 --> 00:23:08.630
right back to the club.
And I,
and I,
I tried to get it going again.
And,
um,

360
00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:13.660
I think this time when I'm going to do is actually take a little bit of time off

361
00:23:14.031 --> 00:23:17.570
from doing stand up and,
and rather than just trying to force a new hour,

362
00:23:18.170 --> 00:23:23.060
I'll go live a life that sort of writes the next hour.
Hopefully.

363
00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:27.680
Hopefully that'll happen.
They'll watch you guys later on this year.
You know,

364
00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:31.580
right off my special comes out.
I just saw him.
It's like half to save jokes.

365
00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:37.720
It's fucking freckled conch sucks.
Um,
all right,

366
00:23:37.721 --> 00:23:41.080
so there's 23 minutes.
I don't have the advertising reads yet,

367
00:23:41.081 --> 00:23:45.950
so I'm going to finish this one tomorrow when I'm overseas.
Uh,

368
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:50.840
once again,
I'm absolutely,
um,
heartbroken.

369
00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:55.910
That's such a special person.
Like Stephen is no longer with us,

370
00:23:55.911 --> 00:23:57.110
but I am like

371
00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:03.570
so inspired by the life that he lived and so happy to have known him only a

372
00:24:03.571 --> 00:24:07.530
little bit is this little as I knew him and uh,

373
00:24:07.531 --> 00:24:12.450
that I actually got to see him and I don't know,

374
00:24:12.451 --> 00:24:15.370
man.
It's,
I don't know.

375
00:24:15.371 --> 00:24:19.470
It's the weirdest feeling I've ever had after somebody had known that's died

376
00:24:19.471 --> 00:24:24.180
where it's just like he just,
that there's even a,
a like a happiness.

377
00:24:24.181 --> 00:24:27.480
I have just,
I,
I mean know what otherwise I think,

378
00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:31.530
cause I just looked at his life and saw the effect that he had on people,

379
00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:35.640
you know,
and he just kind of think like,
yeah man,
he got it.
He got it.
You know,

380
00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:38.793
<v 0>he</v>

381
00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:40.150
<v 1>was a,
yeah,
just a,</v>

382
00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:44.160
an unbelievably positive positive force.

383
00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:47.520
And the lesson I learned when Patrice died is that,
you know,

384
00:24:47.521 --> 00:24:48.720
you don't own these people,

385
00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:53.410
they're just gifts that you get and you don't get to decide when they go.

386
00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:57.880
And that's sort of the,
a cruel thing that you continue to learn.
Yeah.

387
00:24:57.920 --> 00:24:59.460
<v 0>But,
um,</v>

388
00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:03.250
<v 1>I dunno,
looking at his body of work,
you know,</v>

389
00:25:03.730 --> 00:25:06.190
I know personally I'm going to try to be a little bit less of a content,

390
00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:12.850
try to live up to the high standard that he set.
All right.
Okay.
And with that,

391
00:25:12.851 --> 00:25:17.740
I'll read some advertising here from London and with the magic of editing,

392
00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:21.400
this will only be a half a second delay.
Okay.

393
00:25:21.401 --> 00:25:25.600
And through the magic of editing.
I am now in Liverpool,
England.

394
00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:27.240
<v 0>Okay.</v>

395
00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:31.830
<v 1>That only took half a second through the wonderful world of editing.</v>

396
00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:33.433
<v 0>MMM.</v>

397
00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:37.340
<v 1>Jesus Christ.
Oh God.</v>

398
00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:39.513
<v 0>MMM.</v>

399
00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:42.170
<v 1>So I'm in Liverpool now.
The driver was going,
you know,</v>

400
00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:46.250
you can go see where the Beatles fucking did all their first shows,

401
00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:50.510
which I really think that's gotta be like the cheers of Liverpool.

402
00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:58.580
Just going to walk in there.
Yep.
Right over there.

403
00:25:58.670 --> 00:26:02.360
Right over there with where they're not right now.
That's where they were.

404
00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:05.803
<v 0>MMM.</v>

405
00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:08.560
<v 1>I Dunno,
I'm just,
I don't have a show tonight,</v>

406
00:26:08.561 --> 00:26:12.850
so I'm just sitting here trying to figure out the goddamn heating system here,

407
00:26:12.851 --> 00:26:16.060
which I can't figure out.
I don't know how to turn it on.

408
00:26:16.150 --> 00:26:18.040
It pressed every fucking button.
And you know,

409
00:26:18.041 --> 00:26:20.740
I brought a fucking adapter and whenever I bring a mixer,

410
00:26:20.741 --> 00:26:23.710
I always blow out my fucking mixer.
And Lo and behold,

411
00:26:23.711 --> 00:26:26.470
I plugged it in before I plugged it into the mixer.

412
00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:31.060
And I just heard that the plug just goes like [inaudible] was just like,
well,

413
00:26:31.061 --> 00:26:33.730
I just fried that fucking thing.
Even with the fucking adapter.

414
00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:34.840
I Dunno how it happens.

415
00:26:36.790 --> 00:26:37.623
<v 0>MMM.</v>

416
00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:41.040
<v 1>It didn't fry my computer,
but my computer has three prongs.</v>

417
00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:45.230
The mixer only has two.
Is that what problem is?
Somewhere in there?

418
00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:48.870
Was it not grounded?
Was there too much of a surge?

419
00:26:48.871 --> 00:26:53.790
Any electricians that can help me out?
I have no fucking idea.
Um,
but anyways,

420
00:26:53.791 --> 00:26:58.350
let's continue.
Let me read a little a advertising here.
Um,

421
00:26:58.890 --> 00:27:02.970

450

Um,
all right,
let's talk about some shit here.

451
00:28:58.100 --> 00:28:59.280
<v 2>Uh Huh.</v>

452
00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:02.950
<v 1>All right.
So I did some more sets in in New York head,</v>

453
00:29:02.951 --> 00:29:06.590
great sets Thursday night and then Friday and Saturday I had like those sort of

454
00:29:06.591 --> 00:29:11.000
typical New York sets where,
you know,
I dunno,

455
00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:15.860
it's just the,
I dunno what I don't,
I don't get it.

456
00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:16.993
I don't get it.

457
00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:21.410
I was updating making fun of women and then this woman in the crowd,

458
00:29:21.411 --> 00:29:26.180
white woman of course just goes back.
You right.

459
00:29:26.181 --> 00:29:30.950
So I just started making fun of her and she just goes,
what?
I had to do it,

460
00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:31.843
you know,

461
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.960
like what she did was unbelievable and brave and all of that type of shit.

462
00:29:35.961 --> 00:29:37.160
And it's just like,
you know,

463
00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:41.370
I dunno if you just heard it.

464
00:29:41.371 --> 00:29:44.260
It's just like these fucking white women who are acting like they're repressed.

465
00:29:44.261 --> 00:29:48.160
It's like you're white.
Okay.
That's my joke.
It's like you're in the,

466
00:29:48.170 --> 00:29:50.320
in the Jacuzzi with me.
Stop this.

467
00:29:50.321 --> 00:29:54.190
Stop it this fucking whining all the fucking time.
Like,

468
00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:57.910
like you really this oppressed minority,

469
00:29:58.840 --> 00:29:59.740
you know,
is this,

470
00:30:00.010 --> 00:30:03.550
you could tell how oppressed she was by the level of passion she had when she

471
00:30:03.551 --> 00:30:04.600
was yelling.
She's like,

472
00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:09.870
hey fuck you had to say like no passion,

473
00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:15.040
no fire,
no pain,
whatever.
Oh,

474
00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:18.730
I not only know and all it's doing is just caused me to say more ignorant shit

475
00:30:18.731 --> 00:30:22.660
that I wouldn't be saying if they weren't fucking act in that way.
So,

476
00:30:23.830 --> 00:30:28.000
um,
just had,
it's just a really weird,
I don't know,

477
00:30:28.001 --> 00:30:30.670
somebody actually wrote me a letter talking about the Caroline show,

478
00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:35.950
which I mean I had a good time,
but by no means was it a smooth show,
said,
hey,

479
00:30:35.951 --> 00:30:39.520
oh Billy,
thanks for coming out and putting on a great show at Caroline's.

480
00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:43.150
You were absolutely hilarious.
I listen to your podcast and after agree with you,

481
00:30:43.151 --> 00:30:45.340
the crowd wasn't typical New York.

482
00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:49.330
I'm born and raised New Yorker and noticed a ton of what I'm sure were hipster

483
00:30:49.331 --> 00:30:52.270
transplant.
I don't,
I think they're just younger people now

484
00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:56.500
and I just think it's a product of being on social media.

485
00:30:56.501 --> 00:30:58.090
And seeing everybody getting in trouble.

486
00:30:58.091 --> 00:31:02.260
Maybe that's what it is because one of the Times I was doing a show in this guy

487
00:31:02.530 --> 00:31:07.120
was like laughing but he wouldn't look at me and he was almost like looking down

488
00:31:07.121 --> 00:31:09.010
and then looking across at his friend like,

489
00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:13.990
like he wanted to laugh but he was afraid too.
I don't know.
It's strange.

490
00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:14.381
Then he goes,

491
00:31:14.381 --> 00:31:17.880
a couple of people even kept looking over at me for laughing so much.

492
00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:21.730
Just want you to know that US natives and longtime New Yorker is really

493
00:31:21.731 --> 00:31:24.280
appreciated and thoroughly enjoyed your show.

494
00:31:24.281 --> 00:31:27.940
I hope you weren't too put off because I look forward to seeing you perform here

495
00:31:27.941 --> 00:31:30.820
again soon.
Oh yeah.
I mean I'm not going to fucking quit coming to New York.

496
00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:31.773
I just,

497
00:31:31.810 --> 00:31:36.400
I'm having a difficult time trying to figure out what exactly it is that I'm

498
00:31:36.401 --> 00:31:40.390
doing.
I feel like a three year comic when I go to New York.
Um,

499
00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:41.820
<v 0>yeah,</v>

500
00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:46.230
<v 1>I dunno.
But it is what it is.
You know,
it's dictated by the young,
not the old.</v>

501
00:31:46.231 --> 00:31:51.231
So they are setting the tone and I guess I have to figure out how to adjust to

502
00:31:51.241 --> 00:31:54.940
it.
Um,
oh,

503
00:31:54.941 --> 00:31:59.920
and all Robert Kraft,
Robert Kraft getting all this shit for,

504
00:31:59.921 --> 00:32:01.420
I don't know what,
you know,

505
00:32:01.421 --> 00:32:06.421
the man simply was trying to buy a strip mall and he just went over there and he

506
00:32:06.791 --> 00:32:10.510
was checking out some of the stores.
What is the problem?

507
00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:15.070
I think it's such fucking bullshit.
That's just because he's famous.

508
00:32:15.370 --> 00:32:18.370
I was talking to this copy because anytime we bust a rub and tug,
he goes,

509
00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:21.040
you're trying to get the people that run it.
You don't get the Johns,

510
00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:24.460
you just scare them and you let them go.
But all of a sudden he's a famous guy.

511
00:32:24.461 --> 00:32:28.060
So now it's just like this big deal,
you know?
And everybody's just like,

512
00:32:28.061 --> 00:32:32.680
why if you Robert Crap,
do you need to go to a rub and tug?

513
00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:37.710
And I would say that's because that's how annoying it is to have a woman in your

514
00:32:38.171 --> 00:32:39.004
life.

515
00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:46.670
You can just get what you want without all the fucking bitch moaning and

516
00:32:46.671 --> 00:32:47.600
complaining.

517
00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:50.360
<v 0>MMM.</v>

518
00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:54.050
<v 1>Well,
I don't know why he went.
If he did to man,
it's all fucking alleged anyways.</v>

519
00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:56.900
You know,
it did happen to Florida.
So I mean,

520
00:32:56.901 --> 00:32:58.910
we've been beaten up on the dolphins for so long.

521
00:32:58.911 --> 00:33:02.450
I'm sure that's why they didn't fucking let them go.
But,
uh,

522
00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:05.570
it's great that it happens because it gives people,
you know,

523
00:33:05.630 --> 00:33:09.140
who hate Boston because they want all these fucking championships.

524
00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:12.073
Um,

525
00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:15.350
my favorite thing is when he talk about all the championships that they've won

526
00:33:15.351 --> 00:33:18.740
and like,
people bring up like the eagles or the giants,
that it's just like,
dude,

527
00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:21.830
they,
they went six and three.
I mean,
you're not gonna win all of them.

528
00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:26.420
I will take those three losses all day long to win six Superbowls.

529
00:33:27.610 --> 00:33:28.700
<v 0>Um,
yeah.</v>

530
00:33:29.230 --> 00:33:31.200
<v 1>All fucking day long.
All Day long.</v>

531
00:33:31.201 --> 00:33:35.050
I'll take the 86 year fucking curse of the bay.

532
00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:36.293
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

533
00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:40.920
<v 1>To come back down three games to none
and,</v>

534
00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:43.200
and do what they've been doing.
I mean,
it's like,
it's,
yeah,

535
00:33:43.290 --> 00:33:47.460
it's the pain that makes it great.
Um,
so anyways,

536
00:33:47.930 --> 00:33:50.940
any way to say it properly,

537
00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:55.920
let me read a few more of these podcasts might be a little bit short because I'm

538
00:33:55.921 --> 00:34:00.300
beyond jetlagged and uh,
thank God I don't have a show tonight,

539
00:34:00.301 --> 00:34:03.770
but now I'm like wide awake because I came here and,
uh,

540
00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:07.700
I couldn't sleep on the plane.
I watched two movies that I really enjoyed.

541
00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:13.370
I watched white boy Rick.
I got to give a shout out to that.
I mean,

542
00:34:13.371 --> 00:34:16.340
Matthew mcconaughey is always great.
He's always great.

543
00:34:16.341 --> 00:34:20.240
But the two people that played as kids,
um,

544
00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:24.320
white boy Rick movie.
Let's see here.

545
00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:25.800
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

546
00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:30.360
<v 1>I just thought the acting was superb in that movie.
Really,
really good movie.</v>

547
00:34:31.110 --> 00:34:35.700
And then I also saw a,
I'm not be able to figure it out.

548
00:34:35.701 --> 00:34:40.460
There's IMDP.
Um,
I also saw,
uh,
the,

549
00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:44.740
the Freddie Mercury movie
Bohemian rhapsody.

550
00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:50.500
All right,
Richie Merit fucking killed it.

551
00:34:50.501 --> 00:34:55.300
And then Bel Powley,
both of them were fucking amazing.

552
00:34:55.990 --> 00:35:00.730
A really good movie.
Well,
these are also airplane reviews,

553
00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:04.210
but I still think it was,
you know,
whenever you're in an airport,

554
00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:06.580
Judah Friedlander used to always say that when you run a movie,

555
00:35:06.581 --> 00:35:09.670
every fucking movie is good.
Um,

556
00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:13.930
but these are actually really good movies.
And then I also saw a,
yeah,

557
00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:17.950
that Bohemian rhapsody,
Bohemian rhapsody.
And you always,

558
00:35:17.951 --> 00:35:21.850
the funniest part of that movie for me when I saw the original reviews of

559
00:35:21.851 --> 00:35:25.000
Bohemian rhapsody,
it's how I feel about that song today.

560
00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:33.240
I don't know,
but it's just overplayed.
But that SOG drives me up the wall.

561
00:35:33.241 --> 00:35:37.850
I see a little silhouette of a man.
No,
no,

562
00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:42.390
no,
no.
My mom,
me and my mum,
it's just like,
oh my God,
I get it.

563
00:35:42.391 --> 00:35:46.830
You could sing Jesus Christ about a fucking through line of a thought here.

564
00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:53.310
Um,
but I,
I really liked,
uh,
I liked that movie,
but,
um,
and I was,

565
00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:58.440
I was in the air and missed all the,
uh,
all the Oscar stuff.

566
00:35:58.441 --> 00:35:59.760
But you know,

567
00:36:00.990 --> 00:36:03.780
I thought it was hilarious that spike Lee was upset.

568
00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:08.670
It's just funny to meet when adults get mad that they don't win a fucking
trophy.

569
00:36:09.810 --> 00:36:13.050
You know,
it's just like,
what,
why do you give a shit?

570
00:36:14.010 --> 00:36:16.890
Didn't you see how,
how they treated Martin Scorsese?

571
00:36:16.891 --> 00:36:19.380
How long did he have to wait before he fucking,

572
00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:24.370
before he did fucking,
uh,
if,
when he finally got best director,

573
00:36:24.371 --> 00:36:27.840
when they finally gave it for them,
it wasn't,
it wasn't even his best one.

574
00:36:27.841 --> 00:36:29.670
It should have been for the other ones.
It's like,

575
00:36:29.671 --> 00:36:32.310
that's what's going to happen to you.
You know,

576
00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:35.700
they fucked in Zelle on hurricane and then give him for the,

577
00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:40.080
for that fucking King Kong.
Hey God,
not that on me.
They were always like a movie.

578
00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:44.790
You're too late.
You know.
I don't,
I don't know why.
I don't know why.

579
00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:49.650
Why would you waste your time getting that fucking,
I dunno.

580
00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:53.700
Upset.
I did like that he was dressed like prince,
his grandfather though.

581
00:36:57.010 --> 00:36:57.843
<v 0>Okay.</v>

582
00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:02.510
<v 1>Um,
anyways,
anyway,
uh,
I,</v>

583
00:37:02.511 --> 00:37:07.040
and most of those other movies I didn't see,
uh,
I,
I didn't see,

584
00:37:07.041 --> 00:37:10.230
so I dunno.
What,
what,
what are you going to do?

585
00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:14.180
All right,
the next thing I got here,
somebody of course,

586
00:37:14.450 --> 00:37:18.140
giving me shit for a saint.
I felt bad for Jessie.

587
00:37:18.141 --> 00:37:20.900
Smollett I just felt bad as far as like,
oh my God,

588
00:37:20.901 --> 00:37:25.130
he's got to feel like the biggest fucking asshole lever in this guy.
Of course,

589
00:37:25.131 --> 00:37:29.360
gets all passionate about it because why would you get passionate about the

590
00:37:29.361 --> 00:37:32.060
corporations that dictate our foreign policy?

591
00:37:32.061 --> 00:37:34.310
And I've literally bankrupted this country.

592
00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:39.550
When you can get mad at an actor that got 100% busted for what he did and nobody

593
00:37:40.851 --> 00:37:43.370
got hurt other than him,

594
00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:47.870
you've totally destroyed his screen so they can feel safe,
bad.
You hope.

595
00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:49.330
Who's could we rebounds?

596
00:37:50.690 --> 00:37:54.500
The guy who was willing to let two innocent people rot in jail.

597
00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:59.030
I don't think he thought they were going to get caught considering he was acting

598
00:37:59.031 --> 00:38:00.580
like it was two white people.
I think what,

599
00:38:00.670 --> 00:38:03.770
what was supposed to happen was they were supposed to sort of semi beat him up.

600
00:38:04.070 --> 00:38:06.260
He was supposed to blame it on fucking raw,
uh,

601
00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:08.810
white people and like the two guys who did,
is that what you're saying?

602
00:38:09.350 --> 00:38:13.550
The Guy was trying to cause even more racial division and anger in this country.

603
00:38:14.610 --> 00:38:17.780
Uh,
he didn't increase it or decrease it.
It wouldn't have,

604
00:38:17.810 --> 00:38:21.380
it just would've just been another fucking story that lasted for three days.

605
00:38:21.890 --> 00:38:26.890
It is where it is and will remain that way until people grow the fuck up.

606
00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:27.740
Uh,

607
00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:32.180
the guy who terrorized his coworkers by sending fake hate mail with mysterious

608
00:38:32.181 --> 00:38:35.000
white power powder in it to his place.

609
00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:40.060
Work Paul your head out of your ass.
Bird.
All right.

610
00:38:40.090 --> 00:38:41.710
Maybe I was wrong about that.

611
00:38:42.490 --> 00:38:44.980
I thought it'd be more of a unique take other than to say,

612
00:38:45.010 --> 00:38:49.750
you just said what everybody else said.
Congratulations sir.
You,
no,

613
00:38:49.751 --> 00:38:53.230
I still feel sorry for is you who does not have an original fucking,

614
00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:57.250
I take what everybody else thinks.
Oh,
that's entertaining.
I mean,

615
00:38:57.251 --> 00:38:58.240
if I just did that,

616
00:38:58.241 --> 00:39:02.820
I could just be that big headed fucking lady who's that lady who does that show?

617
00:39:02.910 --> 00:39:07.060
And she turns her head to the side like Jim Rome,
you know,

618
00:39:07.390 --> 00:39:12.160
she gets all mad about cases about people who you've been just horrific things

619
00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:16.060
have happened to them,
but if horrific things didn't happen to them,

620
00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:17.890
then she wouldn't have a mansion.

621
00:39:17.891 --> 00:39:21.970
So the whole show is kind of a weird thing to watch.
Um,
yeah.

622
00:39:21.971 --> 00:39:26.670
Might as well be her.
She looks like the,
the,

623
00:39:26.690 --> 00:39:30.710
the cousin of that woman who had the slave themed wedding,

624
00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:34.400
who used to do the cooking show on the fucking food network,

625
00:39:35.610 --> 00:39:40.370
whatever fucking name is.
Um,
she's,
you guys think I'm in a bad mood.

626
00:39:40.371 --> 00:39:44.000
Watch that person show always with this scowl on their face.

627
00:39:44.420 --> 00:39:48.950
She looks like that fucking monster in uh,
the fuck is it?

628
00:39:48.951 --> 00:39:51.110
The bugs bunny.
You know,

629
00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:56.410
monsters have such interesting lives or whatever used to say,
uh,

630
00:39:56.730 --> 00:40:00.910
when bugs bunny was doing the things here,
that no arm fucking monster.
Right.

631
00:40:01.910 --> 00:40:05.960
Um,
anyways,
sorry.
This is all jet lag.
Fucking horse shit.

632
00:40:06.970 --> 00:40:11.630
Uh,
the fuck am I talking about here?
Yeah.
I,

633
00:40:11.631 --> 00:40:15.790
anytime I see somebody just completely fucked their life up on some level human

634
00:40:15.791 --> 00:40:20.530
being,
the human being,
I just,
I just feel bad.
I got God,
what did you do?

635
00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:22.210
You know,

636
00:40:22.210 --> 00:40:25.000
I don't condone it and think they should and I definitely think they should be

637
00:40:25.001 --> 00:40:27.520
punished.
I don't know why I was looking at that.

638
00:40:29.110 --> 00:40:33.940
Like we'll get that fucking Bernie Madoff guy.
I just can't imagine just sit.

639
00:40:33.941 --> 00:40:36.980
I guess I'm looking at it like the person actually has empathy for other people.

640
00:40:36.981 --> 00:40:37.790
Maybe they don't.

641
00:40:37.790 --> 00:40:41.930
I'm putting myself into that situation where I would be going like,
Ah God,

642
00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:45.800
okay.
Just every day everybody's smiling,
you're the greatest bill.

643
00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:49.010
Thanks and making me all this money and I going to be like,
thank you.

644
00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:53.640
Not to say that I haven't been a piece of shit in my life.

645
00:40:53.780 --> 00:40:57.230
Well maybe that's what of this cause I've bet a piece of shit so I don't know.

646
00:40:57.260 --> 00:40:57.411
Hey,

647
00:40:57.411 --> 00:41:02.330
excuse me for fucking feeling bad for an actor who made it and then fuck the

648
00:41:02.331 --> 00:41:03.290
whole thing up.

649
00:41:04.650 --> 00:41:08.610
That is going to be the most bizarre way ever to try and get a raise.

650
00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:10.830
But I still don't think that that's why he was doing it.

651
00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:14.850
I think he had like some sort of victim fantasy or something like that.

652
00:41:14.851 --> 00:41:19.180
I think it was more that I don't think that that's how you get a raise in and

653
00:41:19.390 --> 00:41:21.600
I'll see if he really thinks that that's the way it was.

654
00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:23.600
The was a way to get a raise.

655
00:41:23.770 --> 00:41:25.890
Like there was the whole fucking thing was so crazy.

656
00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:29.430
I feel like there's something about him that he's not all there and now he just

657
00:41:29.431 --> 00:41:34.080
making fun of somebody that has some sort of mental issue,
I dunno.
Or

658
00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:37.230
He's like the world's dumbest criminal.
Maybe that's what it is.
I don't know.

659
00:41:37.470 --> 00:41:41.420
But you know what sir,
I will try to pull my head out of my ass and,
and,

660
00:41:41.470 --> 00:41:42.630
and have your thoughts,

661
00:41:42.631 --> 00:41:46.320
which is what everybody else thinks and that'll be an entertaining podcast.

662
00:41:46.321 --> 00:41:50.250
Welcome to what everybody else thinks.
I'm your host Bill Burr,

663
00:41:52.250 --> 00:41:53.730
uh,
the new green deal.
Sir,

664
00:41:53.731 --> 00:41:58.080
did you get this mad that the first mammal went extinct due to human induced

665
00:41:58.081 --> 00:42:00.630
global warming?
Did you have that level of passion for it?

666
00:42:03.340 --> 00:42:07.390
All right.
The new green deal,
Yo Billy planet puts

667
00:42:09.430 --> 00:42:13.840
I'm into saving the environment and I've been abstaining from plastic bags and

668
00:42:13.841 --> 00:42:17.770
straws and buying the new iPhone every year for most of my life.

669
00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:21.460
But I'm starting to question the narrative of certain things.

670
00:42:22.630 --> 00:42:27.190
Okay.
Uh,
you talked about AOC,
I dunno what that is.

671
00:42:27.250 --> 00:42:32.140
The young Congress woman with big ambitions wasn't sure if you heard this,

672
00:42:32.141 --> 00:42:35.290
but in the New York green deal,
she's posting,

673
00:42:35.830 --> 00:42:40.830
there was a line item supporting those who are not able to work in those who are

674
00:42:43.061 --> 00:42:48.010
not willing.
Uh,
granted,
this isn't likely to happen.

675
00:42:48.610 --> 00:42:52.870
I think it's insane to suggest that someone should get a check for sitting

676
00:42:52.871 --> 00:42:54.910
around on their ass.
My question is,

677
00:42:55.180 --> 00:43:00.180
if the US government decided to do this in civil war was pending,

678
00:43:00.340 --> 00:43:03.460
would you leave the country or refuse to pay taxes?

679
00:43:04.850 --> 00:43:08.360
Jesus Christ,
dude,
that,
that you went fucking vertical on that last line.

680
00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:14.530
I mean,
if the US government decided to do it,
what the fuck?

681
00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:18.550
What could I do about it?
I mean,
I,
I guess I would,

682
00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:24.030
I essentially work for free.
MMM.

683
00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:30.700
I Dunno,
but it's,
what's killing me is,

684
00:43:31.570 --> 00:43:32.410
is we,

685
00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:37.330
we have the money to not with all the money that we pay in taxes.

686
00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:42.810
If we would get out of these fucking wars,
which are going nowhere,

687
00:43:42.811 --> 00:43:46.290
and I've just bankrupted us and made a very few amount of people in this
country,

688
00:43:46.300 --> 00:43:47.950
super fucking rich.
Okay.

689
00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:54.850
You wouldn't have to then in like this person is now coming along and going

690
00:43:54.851 --> 00:43:57.070
after people and she's not,

691
00:43:57.100 --> 00:44:00.580
she's not going to be able to get all of those super rich people do not have

692
00:44:00.581 --> 00:44:04.090
their money in this country.
I saw this fascinating thing,

693
00:44:04.091 --> 00:44:09.010
I talked about this before,
how they,
they,
they get it out of the country,

694
00:44:09.790 --> 00:44:13.090
you know their corporation is set up a in cooperation and one of these fucking

695
00:44:13.091 --> 00:44:15.250
islands and all the money goes there.

696
00:44:15.251 --> 00:44:18.220
And then there were an employee of that corporation and then they set up another

697
00:44:18.221 --> 00:44:20.710
corporation in a different Ireland,
different company.

698
00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:22.720
And then that debt cooperation bills,

699
00:44:22.721 --> 00:44:25.840
the first one and then there's another one in another country and that one

700
00:44:26.110 --> 00:44:29.200
builds this one and they just keep moving all of the money throughout these

701
00:44:29.201 --> 00:44:33.750
islands.
All these key is is it's different countries.
So with each country,

702
00:44:34.290 --> 00:44:35.041
the IRS,

703
00:44:35.041 --> 00:44:40.041
I guess the amount of red tape they have to go through and at each stop the

704
00:44:40.591 --> 00:44:44.580
corporation air quote corporation pays off somebody locally.

705
00:44:44.581 --> 00:44:46.200
So it does cost them money to do that,

706
00:44:46.201 --> 00:44:49.680
but not nearly as much as what they would pay in the United States.

707
00:44:49.681 --> 00:44:53.910
And then when I get to like the seventh or eighth fucking place,
that corporation

708
00:44:55.770 --> 00:45:00.390
then gives the person in the United States who doesn't want to pay taxes,

709
00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:04.140
gives them a alone yeah.

710
00:45:04.330 --> 00:45:07.560
Gives them the money back in the form of alone,
which isn't taxable.

711
00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:10.280
And then they just never pay it back.

712
00:45:10.380 --> 00:45:13.320
And the in the corporation quote forgives the loan.

713
00:45:14.370 --> 00:45:18.930
So the taxes that that person paid was paying off people in each one of those

714
00:45:18.931 --> 00:45:22.310
countries before it came back.
MMM.

715
00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:27.000
Which is very sophisticated and I don't know,

716
00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:30.840
that's how they fucking do it now.
This woman is not going to get those people.

717
00:45:30.841 --> 00:45:33.360
What she's going to do is get,
like I said,

718
00:45:33.361 --> 00:45:35.850
stand up comedians that are suddenly selling tickets.

719
00:45:36.090 --> 00:45:39.240
She's got to get kids out of college that,
you know,

720
00:45:39.241 --> 00:45:42.390
created movement watches or s or started an APP.

721
00:45:42.391 --> 00:45:47.391
She's going to basically be going after and taxing the shit out of what makes

722
00:45:47.941 --> 00:45:49.380
this country great.

723
00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:54.260
The fact that you can come from nothing and you can get to that,

724
00:45:54.261 --> 00:45:58.430
the absolute heights,
you know,
depending on how hard you work,

725
00:45:58.431 --> 00:46:03.110
your idea and your luck,
anyone can make it.
Um,

726
00:46:03.230 --> 00:46:06.770
she's going to be going after that and completely ignoring

727
00:46:09.220 --> 00:46:12.340
these corporations that have bankrupted this fucking country.

728
00:46:12.340 --> 00:46:15.160
Polluted the fucking drinking water.
Turned up our,
our,

729
00:46:15.490 --> 00:46:18.580
our food supply into poison had made money,

730
00:46:18.581 --> 00:46:21.910
millions and billions of dollars in pharmaceutical,
uh,

731
00:46:22.130 --> 00:46:23.670
the pharmaceutical industry and,
and,

732
00:46:23.950 --> 00:46:27.130
and with all these people overdosing and Ali's families that are ripped apart,

733
00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:29.140
then Jenny,
she's not gonna go after any of those fucking people.

734
00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:34.560
She's just going to get someone like me who's just a fucking individual.

735
00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:39.860
That's it.
You saw what happened when Trump tried to tip,

736
00:46:39.861 --> 00:46:41.780
pull the troops out of Syria.

737
00:46:41.930 --> 00:46:46.510
You saw how both fucking Democrats and Republicans are like,
whoa.
They would,

738
00:46:46.820 --> 00:46:51.820
that's where their bread is buttered by keeping those corporations making all

739
00:46:52.071 --> 00:46:56.870
that money on that fucking war,
on those fucking wars.
And then when they're done,

740
00:46:56.990 --> 00:47:00.380
they then get to go around and give speeches and that's how they wash their

741
00:47:00.381 --> 00:47:03.920
fucking bribe money.
And you watched this woman for all these big ideas she has.

742
00:47:04.100 --> 00:47:08.210
She's going to come out the other side.
She's going to be a multi,
multi,
multi,

743
00:47:08.211 --> 00:47:11.330
multi fucking millionaire.
She's going to have a fucking book deal.

744
00:47:11.450 --> 00:47:13.040
She's going to be on TV.

745
00:47:13.041 --> 00:47:16.400
She's going to go on the talk show circuit and everybody's going to just sit

746
00:47:16.401 --> 00:47:20.810
there and talk about what a fucking inspiration she is.
And um,

747
00:47:22.290 --> 00:47:26.200
you know,
it,
it's,
it's just,
it's all bullshit.
And then meanwhile,
you know,

748
00:47:27.370 --> 00:47:28.570
anybody who fucking,

749
00:47:29.290 --> 00:47:32.740
when I had the balls to go after a dream and sleep on a futon until they were

750
00:47:32.741 --> 00:47:36.970
like 38 and started making some money is going to be paying 70% taxes.

751
00:47:37.570 --> 00:47:40.990
I guess that that's,
that's the solution to it.
I don't know.
I,

752
00:47:41.100 --> 00:47:44.780
it doesn't seem like,
you know,

753
00:47:44.810 --> 00:47:48.410
I know a lot of fucking people that if you just gave them a check every month

754
00:47:48.411 --> 00:47:52.430
would just sit on their fucking ass and play video games.
Um,

755
00:47:52.490 --> 00:47:55.550
just because this changing technology,
you have to fucking join it.

756
00:47:55.551 --> 00:47:59.900
Learn how to fucking fix a robot's ACL or some shit.
You know what I mean?

757
00:48:00.470 --> 00:48:03.560
It's like,
I'm sure there's a bunch of mechanics out there right now.

758
00:48:03.740 --> 00:48:04.610
If you're smart,

759
00:48:04.730 --> 00:48:08.660
you start to learn how to fix a an electric vehicle rather than sticking with

760
00:48:08.661 --> 00:48:09.860
gas combustion engines.

761
00:48:09.861 --> 00:48:12.020
Kind of trying to keep yourself ahead of the fucking game.

762
00:48:12.021 --> 00:48:14.270
That's what you have to do.
You've got to fucking adjust.
Right?

763
00:48:15.230 --> 00:48:18.390
I don't think the solution is to turn around,
you know,
I,

764
00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:23.560
if I was running shit to take more than 50% income tax off of anybody,

765
00:48:24.950 --> 00:48:26.200
regardless of where that,

766
00:48:26.270 --> 00:48:28.880
how much money they're making should be fucking criminal.

767
00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:34.120
There's no way the person who did the job should make less money then the person

768
00:48:34.511 --> 00:48:38.920
taxing you.
Um,
I dunno,
that's just my,

769
00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:41.440
my fucking opinion.
What the hell do I know?

770
00:48:41.441 --> 00:48:43.750
I imagined some will tell me I needed to take my head out of my ass,

771
00:48:43.751 --> 00:48:46.180
but I would imagine if we,
you know,

772
00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:51.010
converted to fucking solar power and electric cars and all of that,

773
00:48:51.011 --> 00:48:52.510
we would take a massive,

774
00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:57.840
massive bite out of the Middle East and all of those people that fund these

775
00:48:58.031 --> 00:49:02.470
fucking terrorist groups and two things,
they wouldn't have the money.

776
00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:08.130
So to be any sort of a threat to us,
we wouldn't be fucking over there.

777
00:49:08.430 --> 00:49:11.340
And eventually they would just go back to fight in each other the same way they

778
00:49:11.341 --> 00:49:13.560
fucking did in eastern Europe.
When Russia pulled out,

779
00:49:13.890 --> 00:49:17.220
they went right back to picking up their fights.
They were like,
where,

780
00:49:17.221 --> 00:49:22.080
where are we?
And they went right back to fucking killing each other.
So I dunno,

781
00:49:22.110 --> 00:49:24.960
I know I'm oversimplifying all of this shit,
but um,

782
00:49:25.980 --> 00:49:29.850
I would think because we're their biggest customer that if we pulled out of

783
00:49:29.851 --> 00:49:30.001
there,

784
00:49:30.001 --> 00:49:35.001
that would massively hurt any sort of terrorist groups ability to try and go

785
00:49:37.201 --> 00:49:40.520
after us.
You know,
I don't know the fuck the one out.

786
00:49:40.650 --> 00:49:42.720
Why do you guys ask me such deep questions?
You know,

787
00:49:42.721 --> 00:49:46.860
I don't fucking read the paper.
Write a long time.
Ozzy lady listener,

788
00:49:47.190 --> 00:49:52.170
a good day bell long time listener here from Melbourne,
Australia.

789
00:49:52.170 --> 00:49:55.410
Who would love to hear your take on my situation?
All right,
well,

790
00:49:55.411 --> 00:49:58.530
did you realize you have to listen to my bed,
Aussie,
Aussie accent there?

791
00:49:58.980 --> 00:50:02.460
I'm in the second half of my twenties out here.
We call that your late twenties.

792
00:50:02.730 --> 00:50:05.400
I work in a TV job.
I love,
I'm independent,

793
00:50:05.410 --> 00:50:09.720
have great friends and enough hobbies slash personal interests to keep me busy

794
00:50:09.721 --> 00:50:13.950
and entertained in everyday life.
I've been told I'm a catch,

795
00:50:15.330 --> 00:50:19.440
but it ain't all rainbows and sunshine.
Uh,
not only am I single,

796
00:50:19.441 --> 00:50:21.360
but by my cynicism,

797
00:50:22.350 --> 00:50:26.460
by my citizen has become so powerful that it's compromising my ability to date

798
00:50:26.550 --> 00:50:29.000
or trust,
I think you want to say.
But my cynicism,

799
00:50:29.570 --> 00:50:31.370
a bit of a background here years ago,

800
00:50:31.371 --> 00:50:34.880
I was in a longterm relationship with ended in heartache for me.

801
00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:39.380
And since then I've been through a sequence of disappointing dating experiences,

802
00:50:39.381 --> 00:50:44.381
which has left me more lonely and unlovable each time people have named me good

803
00:50:44.571 --> 00:50:47.060
luck,
chuck,
because whenever I get involved with anybody,

804
00:50:47.061 --> 00:50:49.460
they settled down with the next person.
They come across.

805
00:50:49.790 --> 00:50:51.800
I fear and becoming an angry person.

806
00:50:51.801 --> 00:50:56.660
Men seem to think I'm more of a good time than along than a long time or a good

807
00:50:56.661 --> 00:50:58.270
answer for boredom.
Uh,

808
00:50:58.300 --> 00:51:02.510
I also need seem to attract men in relationships or worse,
married.

809
00:51:04.510 --> 00:51:05.330
<v 0>MMM.</v>

810
00:51:05.330 --> 00:51:07.760
<v 1>But how can I become less of a cynic?</v>

811
00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:11.630
The reality is that some people just don't end up finding someone.
Well,

812
00:51:11.631 --> 00:51:14.000
not with that attitude.
Uh,

813
00:51:14.001 --> 00:51:18.990
they go through life falling in love alone or not at all.
My mother has,

814
00:51:19.270 --> 00:51:23.360
has been single for 10 years and doesn't intend on changing that.
Uh,

815
00:51:23.361 --> 00:51:25.400
do you think some people are meant to be alone?

816
00:51:25.401 --> 00:51:29.090
Was there ever a point in your life where you thought you'd end up alone chairs

817
00:51:29.091 --> 00:51:30.740
and go fuck yourself?
Absolutely.
I did.

818
00:51:30.741 --> 00:51:35.220
And I went through the same shit that you're going through.
Yeah.
And I had,

819
00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:35.670
you know,

820
00:51:35.670 --> 00:51:39.120
women I dated and then I fucked it up and then they would go on the next guy.

821
00:51:39.121 --> 00:51:41.640
They'd marry him.
Yeah.
I had that happen a couple of times.

822
00:51:43.060 --> 00:51:43.893
<v 0>MMM.</v>

823
00:51:45.110 --> 00:51:47.380
<v 1>And then I dated,
you know,
thought went for awhile.</v>

824
00:51:47.420 --> 00:51:51.530
I thought women were psychos and then I just realized that what I was doing was

825
00:51:51.531 --> 00:51:53.900
I kept going after roughly the same kind of person.

826
00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:57.260
I kept fishing in the same poisoned pond,
if you will.

827
00:51:57.770 --> 00:52:02.770
I think you just need to get a little therapy and become a little more positive.

828
00:52:03.081 --> 00:52:06.770
And obviously if somebody is married or in a relationship,
you shouldn't,

829
00:52:07.900 --> 00:52:10.300
you know,
I think that should be one of your first fucking questions.

830
00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:13.360
<v 0>MMM.</v>

831
00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:17.520
<v 1>And there has to be something that you're doing.
And I'm saying this as,
as,
uh,</v>

832
00:52:18.370 --> 00:52:22.510
as a way as a positive thing that if that's what you're attracting,

833
00:52:22.511 --> 00:52:24.610
there has to be something that you're doing that,

834
00:52:24.611 --> 00:52:26.230
that can only happen so many times before.

835
00:52:26.360 --> 00:52:28.180
You got to be figuring out what the fuck am I doing?

836
00:52:29.090 --> 00:52:32.620
That's what I did was psycho women when I was just like,
you know,

837
00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:36.190
[inaudible] chicks is psychos.
And after a while,
once you date,
like the third,

838
00:52:36.191 --> 00:52:40.120
fourth,
fifth one in a row,
you're like,
all right,
what am I doing?
Oh,

839
00:52:40.210 --> 00:52:43.270
I'm deliberately going after these people cause I'm afraid to commit.

840
00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:44.950
And then when they break up with me,

841
00:52:44.951 --> 00:52:47.590
there's no fucking heartache because they're out of their fucking mind.

842
00:52:49.070 --> 00:52:50.540
<v 0>Um,
so</v>

843
00:52:52.090 --> 00:52:55.390
<v 1>I think some people were meant to be alone,
but it doesn't sound like you are.</v>

844
00:52:55.840 --> 00:53:00.010
If you are meant to be alone,
you would be way more okay with it than you are.

845
00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:03.310
And this doesn't just seem like you're looking at the herd and it's making you

846
00:53:03.311 --> 00:53:06.370
question yourself.
You sound like you want to find love.

847
00:53:06.371 --> 00:53:10.600
So what I would do is take some of your TV money and I would get a good

848
00:53:10.601 --> 00:53:15.220
therapist and I would do some work on yourself and

849
00:53:16.150 --> 00:53:16.983
<v 0>uh,</v>

850
00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:20.610
<v 1>start fishing in a different pond.
How about that?</v>

851
00:53:20.830 --> 00:53:23.430
Did I oversimplify what was going on?
I probably did.

852
00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:26.933
<v 0>MMM.</v>

853
00:53:27.830 --> 00:53:32.570
<v 1>Ways.
Any way.
I'm just gonna keep saying anyways,</v>

854
00:53:32.630 --> 00:53:35.490
I think it's one of one of my charms that I don't,

855
00:53:35.570 --> 00:53:40.400
I don't have command with my own language.
Um,
all right.
That is the,

856
00:53:40.610 --> 00:53:43.160
uh,
that is the podcast.
Geez,
we got fucking deep on this one.
Huh?

857
00:53:45.250 --> 00:53:49.780
Passing is Steven Brody Stevens,
my how to solve the fucking Middle East problem.

858
00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:54.700
The audacity to be doing that.
And uh,
I don't know what else.

859
00:53:54.910 --> 00:53:57.640
Look at it as Keith Robinson just texted me,
he's like,
ha ha.

860
00:53:58.750 --> 00:54:02.500
Looks like Robert Kraft won't be going to the White House this year.
Oh yeah,

861
00:54:02.501 --> 00:54:05.070
I guess so.
Go cry with his six fucking trophies.

862
00:54:06.390 --> 00:54:06.610
<v 0>Okay.</v>

863
00:54:06.610 --> 00:54:09.820
<v 1>Not to mention,
I,
you know,
I don't have,
is,
I don't know.</v>

864
00:54:09.821 --> 00:54:12.190
I've never had this experience before that my teams,

865
00:54:12.191 --> 00:54:15.190
the team that wins everything.
It was,
it always this fucking petty.

866
00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:18.940
That's all they do is just come up with petty shit.
Huh?

867
00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:23.590
I guess he won't be plugging
[inaudible] that's like,

868
00:54:23.591 --> 00:54:25.410
okay.
Yeah.

869
00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:30.440
I guess we'll just have to fucking cry on Mark Trophies and move on.

870
00:54:30.521 --> 00:54:35.140
It'd be they're not taking the team away.
Who gives a shit and not only that,

871
00:54:35.141 --> 00:54:38.170
it's fucking,
it's Donald Trump.

872
00:54:39.340 --> 00:54:39.450
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

873
00:54:39.450 --> 00:54:40.201
<v 1>he was probably,</v>

874
00:54:40.201 --> 00:54:43.440
he was probably the driver and the getaway car from the rub and tug.

875
00:54:45.080 --> 00:54:50.030
Did you grab them by the policies?
Um,
anyways.
All right.
Anyway,

876
00:54:50.060 --> 00:54:53.120
that is the,
uh,
that is the podcast.
Um,

877
00:54:54.410 --> 00:54:58.130
congratulations to everybody out there.
That one,
the shiny things,

878
00:54:58.390 --> 00:55:02.300
Mike condolences for those who didn't.
Um,

879
00:55:02.420 --> 00:55:06.860
I hope people who watch movies and were offended by them can somehow move past

880
00:55:06.861 --> 00:55:11.300
it and,
uh,
find a reason to get up in the morning tomorrow.

881
00:55:13.530 --> 00:55:14.363
<v 0>MMM.</v>

882
00:55:14.560 --> 00:55:16.210
<v 1>People sort of,
it's a fucking award show.</v>

883
00:55:17.460 --> 00:55:19.270
<v 0>I mean there</v>

884
00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:25.280
<v 1>don't,
don't they fuck it up in your business to top salesman.</v>

885
00:55:25.340 --> 00:55:29.120
And everybody's sitting is fucking Goddamn Brown.
Noser he's banging the fucking,

886
00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:32.300
his daughter was getting married to her.
That's why he fucking money.
You know,

887
00:55:32.440 --> 00:55:36.050
isn't there always that shit?
There's always going to be that shit.
You know.

888
00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:41.270
[inaudible] fucking crying.
So what's,

889
00:55:41.271 --> 00:55:43.490
what a fucking great country.
This is,

890
00:55:45.260 --> 00:55:46.093
<v 0>you know,</v>

891
00:55:46.820 --> 00:55:49.940
<v 1>it's such a great country.
People complain about the movies.</v>

892
00:55:51.230 --> 00:55:55.250
I didn't like the way it made people with red shirts.
Look.

893
00:55:56.360 --> 00:55:57.180
Ooh.

894
00:55:57.180 --> 00:55:58.013
<v 0>Okay.</v>

895
00:55:58.900 --> 00:56:03.020
<v 1>Well at least fucking polar bears too.
Fucking drowning.
Um,</v>

896
00:56:04.030 --> 00:56:06.200
add another flat screen to your fucking TVC.

897
00:56:06.670 --> 00:56:10.480
You fucking TV room so you can fucking watch the Oscars and cry about it.
Um,

898
00:56:10.660 --> 00:56:15.220
all right,
I'm off my fucking soapbox.
Uh,
here we go.
I'm in the bubble.

899
00:56:15.221 --> 00:56:18.760
Everybody.
I am in the bubble this time next week.
What is going to be Monday?

900
00:56:18.840 --> 00:56:21.730
And we'd be doing my first taping and then the next day I'll do my next taping

901
00:56:21.731 --> 00:56:26.080
and then now we will be putting this hour and 30 minutes to fucking bed.

902
00:56:27.410 --> 00:56:31.930
Uh,
I can't wait.
I'm very excited.
I miss my daughter and wife terribly.

903
00:56:33.130 --> 00:56:37.540
And uh,
I'm really gonna take it easy this year.
I really am.

904
00:56:37.541 --> 00:56:39.940
I'm talking to my agent.
I'm going to be the California kid.

905
00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:44.250
I'm doing gigs out in fucking Cali and it's going gonna stay in the southwest.

906
00:56:44.520 --> 00:56:48.400
I'm going to fluff.
I can't fly southwest of the Gig in under 50 minutes.

907
00:56:48.401 --> 00:56:51.280
I'm not fucking doing it and I'm just going to fucking chill.

908
00:56:51.940 --> 00:56:56.860
I got an acting Gig this summer.
Then I'm bringing my wife and kid along too,

909
00:56:56.890 --> 00:57:01.780
and uh,
I'm just going to slip some life and let this thing come together.

910
00:57:02.860 --> 00:57:03.371
Uh,
oh my God,

911
00:57:03.371 --> 00:57:08.371
my wife sent me this video of my kids singing the abcs and I do this thing.

912
00:57:08.981 --> 00:57:11.890
I don't know if I,
I probably already told you this shit.
So fucking jet lag.

913
00:57:11.891 --> 00:57:15.730
But I do this thing the way I sing,
the abcs.
I go a,
B,
c,

914
00:57:15.731 --> 00:57:20.220
d e f g,
H,
I,
J,
k l m n o,
p Gate,
you know,
bouncing up and down.

915
00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:22.450
She just laughs and all that stuff.

916
00:57:22.510 --> 00:57:27.470
So now she can do the abcs and she throws the haze in there.
She's like

917
00:57:29.320 --> 00:57:34.240
[inaudible],
Hey t u v,

918
00:57:35.500 --> 00:57:36.333
hey,

919
00:57:37.940 --> 00:57:42.940
it's the cutest fucking thing over and it's all that matters in life.

920
00:57:43.820 --> 00:57:48.680
And then you fucking put on the TV and you watch adults fucking whining because

921
00:57:48.681 --> 00:57:51.140
they didn't get this star on their forehead.
Who gives a fuck?

922
00:57:51.260 --> 00:57:56.120
You're making movies,
you're a millionaire,
you're bang and beautiful women.

923
00:57:57.020 --> 00:57:59.420
You know,
what the fuck else do you need?

924
00:57:59.660 --> 00:58:02.180
I wanted the shady thing.

925
00:58:05.970 --> 00:58:07.880
I'd like the
Faculty Academy

926
00:58:09.830 --> 00:58:12.470
fucking have to people in the world try and just get it fucking sandwich.

927
00:58:13.370 --> 00:58:15.950
Boohoo I didn't get a trophy.
I will never get,

928
00:58:15.951 --> 00:58:18.560
I will never fucking understand that.
But then again,

929
00:58:18.561 --> 00:58:22.670
I do watch sports and I get excited that my team wins trophies and I'm about

930
00:58:22.671 --> 00:58:26.960
ready to fucking trash.
Keith Robinson and his,
sorry ass fucking cowboys.

931
00:58:26.961 --> 00:58:30.560
Who the Patriots just passed for more super bowl titles.

932
00:58:32.180 --> 00:58:34.760
Um,
we one more super bowl titles.
What am I going to say to him?

933
00:58:34.870 --> 00:58:38.810
We one more super bowl titles and the last two decades than the cowboys have one

934
00:58:38.811 --> 00:58:40.280
in their entire fucking history.

935
00:58:40.640 --> 00:58:45.020
Tom Brady has more rings than all the Dallas Cowboy quarterbacks combined.

936
00:58:45.500 --> 00:58:48.830
Oh,
I,
I'll do,
I have some ammo and I have to take advantage of it now.

937
00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:52.790
Cause I know when Tom Leaves and bill Belicheck with tires,
you know,

938
00:58:52.820 --> 00:58:57.650
I have faith in like the fucking,
but also wait,
Robert Craft,

939
00:58:58.340 --> 00:59:02.780
right?
Simply trying to buy a strip mall and checking out the stores.

940
00:59:03.140 --> 00:59:08.030
That fucking guy,
arguably the greatest owner of all time.

941
00:59:08.031 --> 00:59:10.850
When you look at his coaching hires,
he's hired three coaches.

942
00:59:11.180 --> 00:59:15.480
Bill Parcells a fucking,
uh,
what's his name there?

943
00:59:17.650 --> 00:59:21.230
Woo.
Just totally foolish.
Forgot his fucking name.
Pete Carroll.

944
00:59:21.920 --> 00:59:26.660
Bill Belichick,
three for fucking three hall of famers.

945
00:59:26.690 --> 00:59:29.390
That's two Superbowl,
three Superbowl,

946
00:59:29.480 --> 00:59:33.440
nine Superbowls amongst all of them.
Amazing.

947
00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:37.490
All right,
that's it.
That's the podcast.
Go fuck yourselves.

948
00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:42.530
And I will talk to you.
Uh,
I'll check in on you in a couple of days.

949
00:59:42.531 --> 00:59:46.520
I don't know where I'm going to be,
but I got Liverpool the next couple of,
uh,

950
00:59:47.360 --> 00:59:51.050
the next couple of nights and uh,
very excited to be here.

951
00:59:51.051 --> 00:59:54.050
I've never been here and as much as I was making fun of all that Beetle Shit,

952
00:59:54.080 --> 00:59:58.460
I'm definitely going to go look at it.
You know,
I got it.
I go,

953
00:59:58.670 --> 01:00:00.550
I'm not going to go to the pub where they fucking started,

954
01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:04.080
and of course I'm going to go right,
and I'm going to,
you know,
I'm like,

955
01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:07.070
I don't think I'm going to go to all their fucking houses,
Roy.

956
01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:10.970
This is where Ringo was sleeping.
Was it?
How the fuck do I know that?
All right,

957
01:00:10.980 --> 01:00:11.420
I'll see you.
