00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.280
- [Mark] Let me share with you

00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:02.762
why I love oxtail so much.

00:00:02.762 --> 00:00:07.213
It is this. (exhales shakily )

00:00:07.213 --> 00:00:09.242
The meat just falls.

00:00:09.242 --> 00:00:11.909
It just pulls off. Look at that.

00:00:15.198 --> 00:00:18.281
(upbeat tempo music)

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.643
- Good morning everyone, it's Mark Wiens

00:00:21.643 --> 00:00:24.992
with migrationology.com in Rome, Italy.

00:00:24.992 --> 00:00:29.377
We are walking right now
through the Piazza di Spagna

00:00:29.377 --> 00:00:31.779
and on our way to the
Pantheon this morning

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:33.935
and we're gonna walk around
that area for the morning

00:00:33.935 --> 00:00:35.438
and just explore

00:00:35.438 --> 00:00:37.882
and then later on, early this afternoon,

00:00:37.882 --> 00:00:41.301
I already booked tickets online for 1:00pm

00:00:41.301 --> 00:00:43.537
and we are gonna to
visit the Vatican City.

00:00:43.537 --> 00:00:46.620
(upbeat tempo music)

00:00:51.177 --> 00:00:53.783
If you don't follow your
map, like on your cell phone

00:00:53.783 --> 00:00:56.756
or follow it, you will definitely get lost

00:00:56.756 --> 00:00:58.829
within these alleys and streets.

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.740
They're so confusing back here

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.979
but it's amazing. (exhales)

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:06.685
And just the view of the
Pantheon in front of me now.

00:01:06.685 --> 00:01:08.314
But I'm going to go have a coffee

00:01:08.314 --> 00:01:10.511
before I talk more about the Pantheon.

00:01:10.511 --> 00:01:14.789
There's a coffee spot that
is just a couple of meters

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:18.165
from the Pantheon and
it's a pretty fast affair.

00:01:18.165 --> 00:01:20.279
You can't really hang out and drink coffee

00:01:20.279 --> 00:01:22.757
but what you do, you stand
in there, you order a coffee

00:01:22.757 --> 00:01:25.114
and just at the bar you drink your coffee.

00:01:25.114 --> 00:01:27.145
So it's going to be
pretty fast and furious.

00:01:27.145 --> 00:01:29.305
I'm going to give Ying the camera

00:01:29.305 --> 00:01:30.886
because Ying doesn't drink coffee

00:01:30.886 --> 00:01:32.389
and she's going to follow me in there

00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:34.921
and then I'm going to have
a cup of coffee real fast.

00:01:34.921 --> 00:01:36.775
(people chatting in background)

00:01:36.775 --> 00:01:38.416
(dishes clinking)

00:01:38.416 --> 00:01:42.333
(speaking in foreign language)

00:01:46.847 --> 00:01:48.830
So what you do is you pay at the cashier

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:49.845
and you get a receipt

00:01:49.845 --> 00:01:51.998
and then you come over to the coffee bar

00:01:51.998 --> 00:01:54.672
and then they make your orders.

00:01:54.672 --> 00:01:57.505
(dishes clinking)

00:02:02.015 --> 00:02:03.373
My first cup.

00:02:03.373 --> 00:02:07.373
(people chatting in background)

00:02:08.304 --> 00:02:10.663
Oh that's an awesome cup of coffee.

00:02:10.663 --> 00:02:12.913
Oh yeah. That is fantastic.

00:02:14.248 --> 00:02:16.207
(dishes clinking)

00:02:16.207 --> 00:02:18.624
And I had ordered one more.

00:02:18.624 --> 00:02:22.624
(people chatting in background)

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:26.396
That's just absolutely stunning.

00:02:26.396 --> 00:02:28.223
It is like...

00:02:28.223 --> 00:02:31.223
It's strong, it's a little bit foamy

00:02:32.082 --> 00:02:34.499
and just extremely flavorful.

00:02:35.662 --> 00:02:36.719
I'm loving this.

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:38.431
Yes, so you've gotta
drink it kind of fast.

00:02:38.431 --> 00:02:39.884
You're just standing here, you drink it

00:02:39.884 --> 00:02:40.717
and then you leave.

00:02:40.717 --> 00:02:42.300
It's a fast affair.

00:02:44.097 --> 00:02:46.495
(dishes clinking)

00:02:46.495 --> 00:02:49.176
That was some incredibly
high quality Espesso.

00:02:49.176 --> 00:02:54.016
Absolutely delicious and that
was a very necessary stop.

00:02:54.016 --> 00:02:57.099
(upbeat tempo music)

00:03:01.265 --> 00:03:03.081
(water trickling)

00:03:03.081 --> 00:03:04.768
It's just incredible to think

00:03:04.768 --> 00:03:06.802
that it was built over 2,000 years ago

00:03:06.802 --> 00:03:08.672
and it's such a grand structure

00:03:08.672 --> 00:03:10.874
with the Corinthian columns in the front

00:03:10.874 --> 00:03:13.476
and the whole circular Pantheon

00:03:13.476 --> 00:03:14.777
and also what I was reading

00:03:14.777 --> 00:03:18.151
is that it is a concrete dome on the top.

00:03:18.151 --> 00:03:20.830
And it's un-reinforced and even today,

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.556
2,000 years after it was built,

00:03:23.556 --> 00:03:25.385
it remains the largest

00:03:25.385 --> 00:03:28.802
un-reinforced concrete dome in the world.

00:03:33.557 --> 00:03:37.012
And just, the entire circular structure.

00:03:37.012 --> 00:03:39.169
And then the dome which is covering it.

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:43.122
Plus the opening right at
the very top, the Oculus.

00:03:43.122 --> 00:03:47.386
This is absolutely an engineering
and construction marvel.

00:03:47.386 --> 00:03:50.469
(upbeat tempo music)

00:03:59.951 --> 00:04:02.388
And when you see people
come in for the first time

00:04:02.388 --> 00:04:03.973
you just see everyone
with their cameras out

00:04:03.973 --> 00:04:07.675
and just doing full 360s circling around.

00:04:07.675 --> 00:04:09.711
You can't help but do that

00:04:09.711 --> 00:04:13.210
because it's such an
awe-inspiring structure.

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:16.293
(upbeat tempo music)

00:04:19.962 --> 00:04:23.459
(water tricking)

00:04:23.459 --> 00:04:24.806
Since we happen to be in this area,

00:04:24.806 --> 00:04:27.201
there's a very famous Gelato shop

00:04:27.201 --> 00:04:29.784
that has 150 different flavors.

00:04:31.272 --> 00:04:33.863
Ying, are you ready for some Gelato?

00:04:33.863 --> 00:04:36.946
(upbeat tempo music)

00:04:42.216 --> 00:04:43.641
- [Server] And the flavors please.

00:04:43.641 --> 00:04:45.389
- [Mark] Can I have one of this.

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:47.177
The (mumbles)

00:04:47.177 --> 00:04:48.155
- [Server] Yeah, and the next?

00:04:48.155 --> 00:04:50.515
- [Mark] And the other one, pistachio.

00:04:50.515 --> 00:04:51.784
- [Server] Would you like
that with cream on top,

00:04:51.784 --> 00:04:53.048
the whip cream?

00:04:53.048 --> 00:04:56.131
- [Mark] Do you want anything on top?

00:04:59.277 --> 00:05:00.110
- Thank you.

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:01.068
- Thank you.

00:05:01.068 --> 00:05:01.901
- Have a good day.

00:05:01.901 --> 00:05:04.040
- [Mark] Thank you, have a good day.

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.373
Whoa. Whoa Ying.

00:05:06.353 --> 00:05:10.484
(speaks in foreign language)

00:05:10.484 --> 00:05:13.157
(Mark laughs)

00:05:13.157 --> 00:05:14.051
- [Ying] Mmmm.

00:05:14.051 --> 00:05:16.162
(Mark mumbles)

00:05:16.162 --> 00:05:17.013
- Ying got half.

00:05:17.013 --> 00:05:19.581
I think this is mixed
berry and then pistachio.

00:05:19.581 --> 00:05:23.748
This is a pretty good size.
This is the medium size.

00:05:27.181 --> 00:05:28.647
Wow.

00:05:28.647 --> 00:05:31.407
Okay, that is pretty awesome.

00:05:31.407 --> 00:05:34.210
The flavor is so well pronounced

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.853
and then again, it's so creamy.

00:05:36.853 --> 00:05:39.255
I think I probably have some on my chin.

00:05:39.255 --> 00:05:43.422
Okay next, (mumbles) for that berry.

00:05:46.375 --> 00:05:47.208
Wow. Yeah.

00:05:48.287 --> 00:05:49.120
That is amazing

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.786
And there's so much real...

00:05:50.786 --> 00:05:53.375
You can taste so much
real berries in there.

00:05:53.375 --> 00:05:55.004
The little raspberry seeds

00:05:55.004 --> 00:05:59.276
and the creaminess and
the sweetness and the...

00:05:59.276 --> 00:06:03.126
Yeah, that is some highly good Gelato.

00:06:03.126 --> 00:06:06.209
(upbeat tempo music)

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:11.666
Ying especially loved that Gelato.

00:06:11.666 --> 00:06:13.410
(laughing)

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:14.465
Was it the best Gelato Ying?

00:06:14.465 --> 00:06:15.565
- Yes.

00:06:15.565 --> 00:06:17.107
- There is another famous coffee shop

00:06:17.107 --> 00:06:19.223
on the opposite side of the Pantheon.

00:06:19.223 --> 00:06:21.018
That's where we are headed now.

00:06:21.018 --> 00:06:24.856
I could use another shot of Expresso.

00:06:24.856 --> 00:06:25.789
Same drill.

00:06:25.789 --> 00:06:28.430
I'm gonna go in there,
pay, take my receipt,

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:32.173
stand there at the bar,
slurp down my cup of coffee

00:06:32.173 --> 00:06:34.083
and that's the process.

00:06:34.083 --> 00:06:38.083
(people chatting in background)

00:06:39.157 --> 00:06:40.140
- [Server] Thank you.

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:41.723
- [Mark] Thank you.

00:06:45.258 --> 00:06:46.383
- A fresh cup of (mumbles).

00:06:46.383 --> 00:06:50.133
(speaks in foreign language)

00:06:53.291 --> 00:06:54.124
- Oh wow.

00:06:54.975 --> 00:06:56.480
There is no milk in here

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.800
but it's almost like foamy.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.550
Like ice cream foamy.

00:07:01.405 --> 00:07:04.570
Wow, that is impressively awesome.

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:08.570
(people chatting in background)

00:07:15.107 --> 00:07:16.977
I managed to slurp most of that foam

00:07:16.977 --> 00:07:19.256
but you gotta use your spoon
to grab the rest of it.

00:07:19.256 --> 00:07:22.839
You don't want any of
it to be left behind.

00:07:24.215 --> 00:07:25.519
Alright, that was awesome.

00:07:25.519 --> 00:07:29.090
That was one of those beverages
that I wish I had on an IV.

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:33.527
I just want a constant of
that Espresso in my system.

00:07:33.527 --> 00:07:36.610
(upbeat tempo music)

00:07:40.104 --> 00:07:42.937
That is an awesome one seater car.

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:46.164
We wound our way through
some of the alleys

00:07:46.164 --> 00:07:47.957
and we finally found it.

00:07:47.957 --> 00:07:49.661
Gonna have some pizza.

00:07:49.661 --> 00:07:50.674
- [Server] That side?

00:07:50.674 --> 00:07:52.436
- [Mark] Yeah. Yes please.

00:07:52.436 --> 00:07:53.269
Yeah sure.

00:07:53.269 --> 00:07:56.380
(knife blade thuds)

00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:57.842
- That is it?

00:07:57.842 --> 00:08:01.160
- [Mark] And, do you have
another one with more toppings

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:02.702
or not ready yet?

00:08:02.702 --> 00:08:03.535
- Just a minute

00:08:03.535 --> 00:08:04.368
- [Mark] Okay.

00:08:04.368 --> 00:08:05.201
- So you can begin with this one

00:08:05.201 --> 00:08:07.528
and in two minutes I'll
have more pizza, okay.

00:08:07.528 --> 00:08:08.528
[Mark] Okay.

00:08:13.543 --> 00:08:15.905
This place makes pizza but
it's also a full bakery

00:08:15.905 --> 00:08:17.211
and so you walk in here

00:08:17.211 --> 00:08:21.911
and the aroma of baking bread
just fills your nostrils.

00:08:21.911 --> 00:08:23.743
We're here a little bit early

00:08:23.743 --> 00:08:27.076
so not all of different
topping pizzas are ready yet

00:08:27.076 --> 00:08:30.289
but he said that we should
start with this pizza first

00:08:30.289 --> 00:08:32.891
and wait to see a few minutes
for some of the flavors

00:08:32.891 --> 00:08:34.478
that might come out of the oven.

00:08:34.478 --> 00:08:36.895
The tomato sauce, the cheese.

00:08:44.807 --> 00:08:45.807
Wow. Mm-hmm.

00:08:47.327 --> 00:08:48.630
The bread is absolutely perfect.

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:51.547
It's crusty and then kind of gummy.

00:08:52.578 --> 00:08:55.871
And then the tomato sauce
is a little bit tart

00:08:55.871 --> 00:08:58.755
but the vibrancy of those tomatoes.

00:08:58.755 --> 00:09:00.542
The cheese is not too salty

00:09:00.542 --> 00:09:02.811
and it's in slices so that

00:09:02.811 --> 00:09:05.864
an entire chunk of cheese
just came up on that bite.

00:09:05.864 --> 00:09:08.864
It's just a pure harmony of flavors.

00:09:15.431 --> 00:09:16.572
- [Server] Like this?

00:09:16.572 --> 00:09:17.919
- [Mark] Yes.

00:09:17.919 --> 00:09:18.752
- [Server] Okay.

00:09:18.752 --> 00:09:20.886
- [Mark] And maybe small slice of spinach.

00:09:20.886 --> 00:09:23.358
- [Server] Yes, right away.

00:09:23.358 --> 00:09:25.468
- [Mark] Can I have it to go?

00:09:25.468 --> 00:09:27.258
- [Server] Certainly.

00:09:27.258 --> 00:09:29.591
- [Mark] A little less. Yes.

00:09:36.684 --> 00:09:38.234
And so you just point out what you want.

00:09:38.234 --> 00:09:39.929
He'll chop a piece off

00:09:39.929 --> 00:09:42.089
and you can either eat it right inside

00:09:42.089 --> 00:09:44.816
like we had that first
warm up pizza for inside

00:09:44.816 --> 00:09:46.158
but then for our next pizza,

00:09:46.158 --> 00:09:47.663
I decided to get it for take away

00:09:47.663 --> 00:09:49.938
because we might walk while we eat

00:09:49.938 --> 00:09:53.277
and also I wanted to stand
outside and enjoy this ambiance.

00:09:53.277 --> 00:09:55.665
It's a shape of the pizza.

00:09:55.665 --> 00:09:59.856
It comes like this and
this one includes...

00:09:59.856 --> 00:10:01.523
Look at all those toppings.

00:10:01.523 --> 00:10:04.533
This one includes lots
of cheese, mushrooms

00:10:04.533 --> 00:10:07.700
and I'm not sure what that is.

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:08.533
Some kind of meat.

00:10:08.533 --> 00:10:10.837
But this one looks awesome

00:10:10.837 --> 00:10:11.900
and, actually,

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:12.918
I think what you do

00:10:12.918 --> 00:10:13.805
is that you kind of eat it sandwich style

00:10:13.805 --> 00:10:17.717
because all those toppings
are squished in the middle.

00:10:17.717 --> 00:10:18.860
(paper scrunching)

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:20.522
- So, yeah,

00:10:20.522 --> 00:10:22.771
I don't want to risk losing
any of those toppings

00:10:22.771 --> 00:10:25.700
so I'm just going to fold it up

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:28.733
but you just have to get a close up look

00:10:28.733 --> 00:10:31.215
at all those goodies inside of there.

00:10:31.215 --> 00:10:34.511
Just look how special that is.

00:10:34.511 --> 00:10:36.011
Look at that, wow.

00:10:37.681 --> 00:10:41.681
(people chatting in background)

00:10:44.897 --> 00:10:45.730
Wow.

00:10:47.633 --> 00:10:49.300
That is spectacular.

00:10:50.739 --> 00:10:53.739
The cheese is packed with mushrooms.

00:10:54.926 --> 00:10:57.983
That's some type of sausage type of meat

00:10:57.983 --> 00:10:59.566
with a little bit of sourness to it.

00:10:59.566 --> 00:11:01.649
The bread, it's so crisp,

00:11:03.162 --> 00:11:04.846
but then it's gummy

00:11:04.846 --> 00:11:07.263
where the cheese meets bread.

00:11:08.692 --> 00:11:09.734
Okay next one.

00:11:09.734 --> 00:11:12.651
(paper scrunching)

00:11:14.414 --> 00:11:16.367
And this next one,

00:11:16.367 --> 00:11:18.950
I believe it's the spinach one.

00:11:24.868 --> 00:11:26.697
Oh yeah, this is the spinach.

00:11:26.697 --> 00:11:31.303
That's just like a little
sandwich with spinach and cheese.

00:11:31.303 --> 00:11:33.138
Oh that's beautiful too.

00:11:33.138 --> 00:11:36.055
(paper scrunching)

00:11:40.503 --> 00:11:44.586
Oh yeah, if you love spinach,
you're gonna to love this.

00:11:44.586 --> 00:11:46.658
This is pure and just loaded

00:11:46.658 --> 00:11:50.243
with handfuls of spinach and cheese.

00:11:50.243 --> 00:11:53.125
The thing that stood out to
me the most was the bread.

00:11:53.125 --> 00:11:56.498
The bread, the crust, was incredible.

00:11:56.498 --> 00:12:00.118
I don't think you can go wrong
with anything at Roscioli.

00:12:00.118 --> 00:12:03.201
(upbeat tempo music)

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:08.377
We have just walked into Campo de' Fiori.

00:12:08.377 --> 00:12:10.208
This is another square.

00:12:10.208 --> 00:12:13.255
Another many of the plazas in Rome

00:12:13.255 --> 00:12:17.034
and this one is famous because
it is home to a fresh market.

00:12:17.034 --> 00:12:20.494
There are lots of fruits
and vegetables, spices.

00:12:20.494 --> 00:12:22.732
You can buy lots of things here

00:12:22.732 --> 00:12:24.486
and we are just actually,

00:12:24.486 --> 00:12:25.786
kind of just passing through though.

00:12:25.786 --> 00:12:28.869
(upbeat tempo music)

00:12:32.456 --> 00:12:33.963
We made it to the Tiber river.

00:12:33.963 --> 00:12:35.956
We are crossing the bridge now.

00:12:35.956 --> 00:12:38.011
We're getting very close
to the Vatican city.

00:12:38.011 --> 00:12:41.094
(upbeat tempo music)

00:12:43.464 --> 00:12:46.011
And the Vatican city is a city state,

00:12:46.011 --> 00:12:48.269
a walled in city state within Rome.

00:12:48.269 --> 00:12:51.646
And it is of course ruled
by the head bishop of Rome

00:12:51.646 --> 00:12:52.822
who is the Pope.

00:12:52.822 --> 00:12:56.688
And so we are walking with
the front main entrance view

00:12:56.688 --> 00:13:00.593
but I think the main
entrance is on the other side

00:13:00.593 --> 00:13:02.421
where all of the people are walking

00:13:02.421 --> 00:13:05.254
so that's where we're going to go.

00:13:07.864 --> 00:13:09.287
Okay, that was a little bit of a walk

00:13:09.287 --> 00:13:12.585
from the entrance to the
Vatican museum entrance.

00:13:12.585 --> 00:13:14.249
You have to go around the wall

00:13:14.249 --> 00:13:16.499
but we are approaching now.

00:13:19.047 --> 00:13:20.757
We got through security

00:13:20.757 --> 00:13:23.560
and then we transferred our e-ticket

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:25.675
into the little tickets.

00:13:25.675 --> 00:13:28.425
It kind of felt like immigration.

00:13:31.639 --> 00:13:33.673
(upbeat tempo music)

00:13:33.673 --> 00:13:34.936
This museum is huge.

00:13:34.936 --> 00:13:37.336
It's one of the largest
art gallery museums

00:13:37.336 --> 00:13:38.394
in the entire world.

00:13:38.394 --> 00:13:40.887
I don't know if we will
be able to see everything

00:13:40.887 --> 00:13:41.872
but I'm gonna kind of pick

00:13:41.872 --> 00:13:43.281
and choose some of the important things

00:13:43.281 --> 00:13:44.747
or things that I really want to see.

00:13:44.747 --> 00:13:47.830
(upbeat tempo music)

00:13:58.176 --> 00:14:01.226
We are passing through a
room called Sala Rotonda.

00:14:01.226 --> 00:14:02.818
And this room,

00:14:02.818 --> 00:14:05.258
it looks actually very
similar to the Pantheon

00:14:05.258 --> 00:14:06.437
but it's much smaller.

00:14:06.437 --> 00:14:10.015
There is a hole in the middle of the dome

00:14:10.015 --> 00:14:12.682
and then this gigantic sculpture

00:14:13.922 --> 00:14:17.505
that looks like a giant
bowl in the middle.

00:14:18.357 --> 00:14:22.716
It's also a collection of
Egyptian art and mummies.

00:14:22.716 --> 00:14:25.799
(smooth tempo music)

00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:30.328
We just moved through the Vatican museum.

00:14:30.328 --> 00:14:33.437
It's series of hallways and corridors

00:14:33.437 --> 00:14:37.573
and not only are there
just amazing sculptures

00:14:37.573 --> 00:14:41.447
on both sides as well as
different exhibits and galleries

00:14:41.447 --> 00:14:44.426
but if you look up, you
will notice paintings

00:14:44.426 --> 00:14:49.033
and decorations and it's just
a museum within a museum,

00:14:49.033 --> 00:14:50.033
of a museum.

00:14:52.353 --> 00:14:54.754
We have entered into the maps gallery

00:14:54.754 --> 00:14:57.271
and this is a long hall that includes maps

00:14:57.271 --> 00:14:58.818
which are painted on both sides.

00:14:58.818 --> 00:15:00.444
There are topographical maps

00:15:00.444 --> 00:15:03.548
which dates back to around 1580.

00:15:03.548 --> 00:15:06.465
(soft tempo music)

00:15:16.052 --> 00:15:17.843
I'm now walking through the Raphael Rooms

00:15:17.843 --> 00:15:20.081
which are a series of four rooms

00:15:20.081 --> 00:15:24.471
which contain just incredibly
beautiful and detailed Frescos

00:15:24.471 --> 00:15:26.267
which were painted by Raphael.

00:15:26.267 --> 00:15:28.738
One of the most famous paintings Frescos

00:15:28.738 --> 00:15:32.567
in the Raphael Rooms is
The School of Athens.

00:15:32.567 --> 00:15:36.756
It's right behind me and
it was painted in 1509

00:15:36.756 --> 00:15:39.399
and it's within the room of the Segnatura.

00:15:39.399 --> 00:15:42.482
(upbeat tempo music)

00:15:44.845 --> 00:15:47.453
We are about to enter the
place that nobody misses

00:15:47.453 --> 00:15:50.586
when they visit the
museums at the Vatican.

00:15:50.586 --> 00:15:54.586
(people chatting in background)

00:15:56.034 --> 00:15:57.535
I think that's the only
place in the whole museum

00:15:57.535 --> 00:15:59.810
where you're not allowed to video or photo

00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:00.977
but it is a...

00:16:02.818 --> 00:16:06.683
It's not a huge chapel but
the ceiling is extremely high

00:16:06.683 --> 00:16:10.056
and it can fit about 2,000
people from what I read

00:16:10.056 --> 00:16:13.719
but you look up and the
walls and on the ceiling

00:16:13.719 --> 00:16:15.587
and it is just...

00:16:15.587 --> 00:16:18.313
All of those paintings by Michelangelo,

00:16:18.313 --> 00:16:21.817
the Frescos that you have seen in photos,

00:16:21.817 --> 00:16:25.231
it's incredible to gaze
into those paintings

00:16:25.231 --> 00:16:26.124
and those Frescos.

00:16:26.124 --> 00:16:28.929
What struck me is how high the ceiling is

00:16:28.929 --> 00:16:30.432
and then just looking up

00:16:30.432 --> 00:16:33.813
and you can just almost fall into a dream

00:16:33.813 --> 00:16:36.458
looking at the Sistine Chapel ceiling.

00:16:36.458 --> 00:16:40.067
(upbeat tempo music)

00:16:40.067 --> 00:16:41.820
We are on our way out of the museum

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:45.659
and going down the famous
spiral staircase now.

00:16:45.659 --> 00:16:48.256
It took us a little over two hours

00:16:48.256 --> 00:16:50.865
and I think we went pretty fast.

00:16:50.865 --> 00:16:53.671
You can definitely spend
a lot more time in there

00:16:53.671 --> 00:16:57.008
if you took more time to
look at all of the art work

00:16:57.008 --> 00:16:58.678
and the galleries and the paintings.

00:16:58.678 --> 00:17:01.936
We are now walking over
to St. Peter's Basilica.

00:17:01.936 --> 00:17:05.276
One of the things I want
to do is to climb the dome.

00:17:05.276 --> 00:17:06.594
Michelangelo's famous dome

00:17:06.594 --> 00:17:09.321
on the top of St. Peter's Basilica.

00:17:09.321 --> 00:17:12.049
So we got in the line for the dome

00:17:12.049 --> 00:17:14.284
and I think it is a separate line

00:17:14.284 --> 00:17:17.704
from entering into the
actual main Basilica.

00:17:17.704 --> 00:17:20.425
So that security point ended up getting us

00:17:20.425 --> 00:17:21.687
into the Basilica as well.

00:17:21.687 --> 00:17:23.840
I thought it was just
gonna get us into the dome.

00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:26.236
So we're going to enter the Basilica first

00:17:26.236 --> 00:17:27.986
and then go to the dome afterwards.

00:17:27.986 --> 00:17:31.403
(soft percussion music)

00:17:34.467 --> 00:17:36.825
It is massive in here

00:17:36.825 --> 00:17:38.942
and I can see the dome up ahead

00:17:38.942 --> 00:17:40.692
and I can see the rays of sunshine

00:17:40.692 --> 00:17:42.849
shinning down through the dome.

00:17:42.849 --> 00:17:45.861
St. Peter's Basilica
was designed by Bramante

00:17:45.861 --> 00:17:47.694
and also Michelangelo

00:17:47.694 --> 00:17:50.256
and it is one of the most impressive sites

00:17:50.256 --> 00:17:52.412
in the Vatican city.

00:17:52.412 --> 00:17:54.403
Especially notable for its dome.

00:17:54.403 --> 00:17:55.705
I'm gonna go climb the dome now

00:17:55.705 --> 00:17:59.872
and hopefully get some great
views of Rome from here.

00:18:01.045 --> 00:18:03.490
And the amount of marble and the carvings

00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:07.235
and sculptures that it took
to create this Basilica

00:18:07.235 --> 00:18:08.495
is mind blowing.

00:18:08.495 --> 00:18:11.578
(upbeat tempo music)

00:18:15.692 --> 00:18:17.680
I just got my ticket.

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:21.299
I am going to climb the
stairs to the top of the dome.

00:18:21.299 --> 00:18:24.794
It is a total of 551 steps to the top.

00:18:24.794 --> 00:18:27.971
So here we go. Here we start.

00:18:27.971 --> 00:18:31.054
(upbeat tempo music)

00:18:32.157 --> 00:18:35.248
As busy and packed as the Basilica is,

00:18:35.248 --> 00:18:36.202
I'm in the staircase now

00:18:36.202 --> 00:18:39.132
and it's completely quiet.

00:18:39.132 --> 00:18:41.209
There's nobody else here

00:18:41.209 --> 00:18:44.263
and I should also mention
that you can take the elevator

00:18:44.263 --> 00:18:46.591
at least part of the way up

00:18:46.591 --> 00:18:48.080
and then just climb a little bit.

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:48.978
I just took a few minutes

00:18:48.978 --> 00:18:52.811
and I've come to some
outdoor courtyard level.

00:18:57.475 --> 00:18:59.594
I didn't even know we
were going to have a view

00:18:59.594 --> 00:19:00.490
from the top of the dome

00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:03.733
but on the inside of the dome.

00:19:03.733 --> 00:19:06.176
Wow, this is awesome, you can see below.

00:19:06.176 --> 00:19:09.259
(upbeat tempo music)

00:19:11.786 --> 00:19:12.841
Made it to that first level

00:19:12.841 --> 00:19:17.358
and those are some amazing
views of the church from above

00:19:17.358 --> 00:19:22.284
but now climbing the circular
staircase to the cupola.

00:19:22.284 --> 00:19:24.784
It's a pretty tight staircase.

00:19:26.426 --> 00:19:27.767
I just made it to the top of the dome

00:19:27.767 --> 00:19:30.330
and that took exactly 13 minutes

00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:33.868
and there were some
amazing spiral staircases.

00:19:33.868 --> 00:19:36.951
(upbeat tempo music)

00:19:49.849 --> 00:19:52.856
From the top here, you have
a full 360 view of Rome

00:19:52.856 --> 00:19:54.974
so you could walk around the dome.

00:19:54.974 --> 00:19:57.948
You can see the edges of
the dome going downwards,

00:19:57.948 --> 00:19:59.455
sloping downwards.

00:19:59.455 --> 00:20:02.257
And of course you have a
whole view, an entire view,

00:20:02.257 --> 00:20:04.821
of St. Peters square from above.

00:20:04.821 --> 00:20:07.904
(upbeat tempo music)

00:20:10.355 --> 00:20:12.772
(bell rings)

00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:16.222
The 360 views of Rome were amazing

00:20:16.222 --> 00:20:19.768
and also just the hike up
the stairs to get to the top

00:20:19.768 --> 00:20:21.717
was also a lot of fun.

00:20:21.717 --> 00:20:24.447
I would highly recommend
fishing out the extra money

00:20:24.447 --> 00:20:27.047
when you come to St. Peters.

00:20:27.047 --> 00:20:27.978
We are walking to the bus stop

00:20:27.978 --> 00:20:30.012
and gonna try to take the
bus to the Jewish ghetto

00:20:30.012 --> 00:20:31.595
for dinner tonight.

00:20:34.895 --> 00:20:35.793
Oh and how convenient.

00:20:35.793 --> 00:20:37.879
The bus that we need to take

00:20:37.879 --> 00:20:39.319
pulled up right as we got here.

00:20:39.319 --> 00:20:42.402
(upbeat tempo music)

00:20:48.753 --> 00:20:51.231
And it should be just
a short walk from here

00:20:51.231 --> 00:20:52.613
to the Jewish area.

00:20:52.613 --> 00:20:55.696
(upbeat tempo music)

00:20:57.413 --> 00:20:59.492
I don't know too much about the influence

00:20:59.492 --> 00:21:01.480
and the history of Jews in Rome

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:04.527
but I do know that there
has been a Jewish influence

00:21:04.527 --> 00:21:06.316
for many years

00:21:06.316 --> 00:21:08.635
and this Jewish area of Rome

00:21:08.635 --> 00:21:11.766
was officially established back in 1555.

00:21:11.766 --> 00:21:14.082
There are a number of different
Jewish Italian restaurants

00:21:14.082 --> 00:21:15.137
in this area.

00:21:15.137 --> 00:21:17.617
I chose to come to one called Nonna Betta.

00:21:17.617 --> 00:21:20.150
- [Ying] Thank you.
- [Mark] Thank you.

00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:22.622
One of the most famous Roman Jewish dishes

00:21:22.622 --> 00:21:25.347
or it's kind of like a appetizer starter

00:21:25.347 --> 00:21:27.418
is a fried artichoke.

00:21:27.418 --> 00:21:30.226
They are deep fried so they're crispy.

00:21:30.226 --> 00:21:32.545
You can see that little
bit of salt on top.

00:21:32.545 --> 00:21:34.295
This looks fantastic.

00:21:35.246 --> 00:21:38.273
You can actually see how
the inside is gonna be nice

00:21:38.273 --> 00:21:40.917
and probable soft while the
outside is gonna be crispy

00:21:40.917 --> 00:21:41.917
and crunchy.

00:21:43.033 --> 00:21:46.783
Let me try to grab all
those layers together.

00:21:53.933 --> 00:21:57.316
Oh yeah, the inside is
creamy like cooked eggplant

00:21:57.316 --> 00:21:59.847
and then those outer layers are crispy

00:21:59.847 --> 00:22:01.999
and a little bit chewy

00:22:01.999 --> 00:22:03.709
and then it's just nicely salted.

00:22:03.709 --> 00:22:05.948
Actually, those outer
leaves are the artichoke.

00:22:05.948 --> 00:22:07.817
They were a little too chewy to chew

00:22:07.817 --> 00:22:09.449
so I probably ate it wrong

00:22:09.449 --> 00:22:10.384
because it's an artichoke

00:22:10.384 --> 00:22:12.801
so it has those really chewy,

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:17.049
outer leaf-like things of the artichoke

00:22:17.049 --> 00:22:19.635
so the inside is really soft

00:22:19.635 --> 00:22:22.439
and then you sort of eat all
that meat from those leaves.

00:22:22.439 --> 00:22:24.350
I think I approached the artichoke

00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:26.262
a little wrong in the first place

00:22:26.262 --> 00:22:27.847
because I was thinking that,

00:22:27.847 --> 00:22:30.171
because it's fried,
those would all be soft

00:22:30.171 --> 00:22:31.881
but they're still a little bit chewy

00:22:31.881 --> 00:22:35.776
but what you do so you can
just grab those crispy bits

00:22:35.776 --> 00:22:36.693
and then...

00:22:39.157 --> 00:22:40.784
Just like any artichoke,

00:22:40.784 --> 00:22:44.951
still bite off all of that
gooey soft bit from the bottom.

00:22:48.272 --> 00:22:52.670
And you can eat the crispy
piece of the artichoke as well

00:22:52.670 --> 00:22:55.886
but definitely don't make
the mistake like I did

00:22:55.886 --> 00:22:58.815
and take half that artichoke in one bite

00:22:58.815 --> 00:23:00.074
or you won't be able to chew it.

00:23:00.074 --> 00:23:00.970
That's for sure.

00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:03.366
And also to begin with
we got a cup of pasta.

00:23:03.366 --> 00:23:07.429
And this is, I think it's the
Nonna Betta special pasta.

00:23:07.429 --> 00:23:11.346
Let me try to work on my
pasta twirling skills.

00:23:12.432 --> 00:23:15.849
I think it's a type of minced meat sauce.

00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:25.310
Yeah, that's really nice too

00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:27.015
and it's mostly tomato based

00:23:27.015 --> 00:23:30.395
but it has a little bit
of a creaminess to it

00:23:30.395 --> 00:23:33.221
so I'm not sure what else is in there.

00:23:33.221 --> 00:23:34.426
Really good with those noodles

00:23:34.426 --> 00:23:37.236
and then just with little
bits of minced meat.

00:23:37.236 --> 00:23:38.253
Let me get one more bite of this.

00:23:38.253 --> 00:23:39.753
This is excellent.

00:23:43.341 --> 00:23:46.433
I think I'm getting
better at my pasta twirl.

00:23:46.433 --> 00:23:49.433
But I definitely need a lot of work.

00:23:53.022 --> 00:23:54.689
Main course has arrived.

00:23:54.689 --> 00:23:57.576
This is codfish prepared Nonna Betta style

00:23:57.576 --> 00:23:59.978
and it comes with pistachios and pine nuts

00:23:59.978 --> 00:24:01.769
and I'm not sure what all this sauce is

00:24:01.769 --> 00:24:03.155
but this looks delicious

00:24:03.155 --> 00:24:05.322
and it came bubbling over.

00:24:06.474 --> 00:24:08.965
Looks like a very rich sauce.

00:24:08.965 --> 00:24:11.770
It should still be very hot.

00:24:11.770 --> 00:24:14.353
As moments ago it was bubbling.

00:24:19.003 --> 00:24:20.895
Yeah, that taste very buttery

00:24:20.895 --> 00:24:23.989
and it has a nutty
flavor from the pine nuts

00:24:23.989 --> 00:24:25.489
and the pistachio.

00:24:26.844 --> 00:24:28.845
And I love those edges of the fish.

00:24:28.845 --> 00:24:33.012
They're slightly caramelized
within this pan as well.

00:24:34.208 --> 00:24:36.200
I saw oxtail on the menu

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:41.004
and I have a soft spot in my
heart for oxtail so I had to.

00:24:41.004 --> 00:24:45.171
This is a nice chunk of oxtail
submerged in a tomato sauce.

00:24:46.797 --> 00:24:50.534
Let me share with you why
I love oxtail so much.

00:24:50.534 --> 00:24:54.596
It is this. (exhales shakily)

00:24:54.596 --> 00:24:57.848
The meat just falls. It just pulls off.

00:24:57.848 --> 00:24:58.931
Look at that.

00:24:59.833 --> 00:25:03.666
Okay I'm gonna mix that
with the tomato sauce.

00:25:13.403 --> 00:25:15.765
It's such a wonderful piece.

00:25:15.765 --> 00:25:20.237
The meat is so flavorful
and so soft and tender.

00:25:20.237 --> 00:25:23.489
That's a very mild tomato sauce.

00:25:23.489 --> 00:25:25.920
It's not really tart. Not really sweet.

00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:27.219
It's very pleasant.

00:25:27.219 --> 00:25:30.552
It just goes well with that tender beef.

00:25:34.915 --> 00:25:35.854
That's really good.

00:25:35.854 --> 00:25:37.522
That was a wonderful meal.

00:25:37.522 --> 00:25:39.314
The artichoke was delicious.

00:25:39.314 --> 00:25:41.531
Oh, the pasta was also very good

00:25:41.531 --> 00:25:43.603
but I really loved that oxtail.

00:25:43.603 --> 00:25:45.715
That was the highlight of the meal for me.

00:25:45.715 --> 00:25:49.822
Nice to sit outside and
just relax after a...

00:25:49.822 --> 00:25:54.376
It was a good day but a very
tiring day with lots of crowds

00:25:54.376 --> 00:25:57.387
and it turned out to be a great day.

00:25:57.387 --> 00:25:59.130
I'm gonna to end the
video for today right now.

00:25:59.130 --> 00:26:00.793
