[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.590
JACLYN LONG: My
name is Jaclyn Long

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.130
and I'm a marriage and
family therapist and a parent

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:11.340
educator.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.310
And I'm also a certified
yoga and mindfulness

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:15.570
teacher and a mom.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.020
And I put all of those
together to create Mind Body

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.150
Moms, a company that
helps to promote

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.700
health and wellness and
effective communication

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.000
and leadership at home
and also at the workplace.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.510
And as a counselor,
I've had hundreds

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.330
of parents in my
office say, I really

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.360
want to parent differently
than I was parented.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.530
I have great parents.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.630
I love them.

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.250
But I'm trying to change.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.750
I'm trying to do
things differently.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:43.710
And it's really hard.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.710
Why can't I change?

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.170
To have this will.

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.330
I have this motivation.

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.370
I can achieve these
things in my workplace.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.312
How come I can't achieve
this thing that I'm

00:00:52.312 --> 00:00:53.520
trying to do so hard at home?

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.270
I have this goal.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.470
I'm writing down
what I want to do.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:56.430
And I can't achieve it.

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.750
I can't do it.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.990
So this is something that
I've explored in-depth.

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.090
And I've discovered
three things that

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.665
get in the way of transforming
the way we raise our kids.

00:01:06.665 --> 00:01:07.665
Are you guys interested?

00:01:07.665 --> 00:01:09.225
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:09.225 --> 00:01:10.440
All right.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:17.160
So number one, self-judgment--

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.760
when we make mistakes, we
tend to beat ourselves up.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.670
And we're harsh and critical
with ourselves inside.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.380
And that gets in
the way of learning.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.910
It's disintegrating.

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.790
Two, lack of community--

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.090
especially as
working parents, it's

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.940
hard to find the time to build
the kind of community that

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.000
can help us learn and grow.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.060
Three, outdated
parenting software--

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.760
outdated parenting software.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.700
So what kinds of things can help
us learn and grow as parents

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.770
and transform the way
we parent our kids?

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.762
Interested?

00:01:57.762 --> 00:01:58.730
OK.

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:04.110
One, mindfulness-- we
need to be engaging

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.270
in practices that
help us regularly

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.120
stay present and awake
and aware in the moment

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.140
so we can choose
something different.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.240
We need to be online in order
to choose something different.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.450
And also practices that
encourage self-compassion

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.730
and a caring attitude
towards ourselves,

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.470
so we can be gentle
with ourselves

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.110
when we make mistakes.

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.010
Anybody in here not make a
mistake as a parent ever?

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.084
So it's inevitable.

00:02:30.084 --> 00:02:31.500
We will continue
to make mistakes,

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.330
no matter how mindful we are.

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.120
And when we do, it's helpful
to be kind to ourselves.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.440
But I've been practicing
mindfulness for over 17 years

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.250
now.

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.380
And it's still sometimes hard
for me to be kind to myself.

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.690
So when I can't muster
self-compassion, what do I do?

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.530
That comes to number
two, community.

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.350
I need a strong,
robust community

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.450
to tap into when
self-judgment comes through.

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.510
And we can't find the caring
attitude towards ourselves.

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.660
And this self-compassion
is integrating.

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.400
It brings together
disparate parts

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:12.060
of ourselves for greater
learning and deeper integration

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.610
to promote learning
and growth and change.

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.830
And three, which Danielle
is here today to offer you--

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.610
updated parenting software--
because most of us

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.620
are operating on
parenting software

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:31.560
systems that were installed
in us about 30 years ago.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.860
They're ancient.

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.330
And in the last
30 years, there's

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.270
been so much discovery,
including Dan Siegel's work--

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.380
a whole new field
he's pioneered called

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.750
interpersonal
neurobiology, which

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.740
brings in lots of
neuroscience research.

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.800
We don't even have
MRIs way back when.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.420
So there's also
52 beautiful tools

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.600
that Jane Nelson has developed
for positive discipline,

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.270
and six elegant, simple,
soulful solutions

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:03.470
that Patty Wipfler with Hand in
Hand Parenting has developed.

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.580
That's just in
the last 30 years.

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.750
25 years of anecdotal evidence
shows that Patty Wipfler's work

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.280
is really helpful to
nurturing children and helping

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.970
them become more cooperative
and relaxed in their bodies.

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:19.620
So what we're
offering today, what

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.078
Danielle's going
to share with you,

00:04:21.078 --> 00:04:23.040
is an updated
parenting software.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.720
And we really want
to encourage you

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.990
to not just get this
downloaded into you,

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.600
but to be an active
participant in this downloading

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.710
process and this installation.

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:33.810
So ask great questions.

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.190
Use the Dory.

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.560
We will have a time at the
end for your questions.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.330
If some come up
in the middle, we

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.430
might put them on the
board for the end.

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.040
And also use a really
good filtering system.

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.190
So there is no substitute
for your own good thinking

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:48.370
as a parent.

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.190
So take what works for you.

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.530
And if there's something
that's still not sitting well

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:53.670
with you, just let it go.

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:54.900
No need to struggle with it.

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.470
Just let it go.

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:57.179
I hope you enjoy.

00:04:57.179 --> 00:04:58.720
DANIELLE SEYBOLD:
So right now you're

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.520
looking at slides,
which is fine.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.574
At some point later
when I talk, I'm

00:05:02.574 --> 00:05:04.240
going to be doing
something nonverbally.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.050
And I'll ask you
to follow along.

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:07.550
So we're going to
see what happens.

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.841
And I'll do my best to explain
that with language if we

00:05:09.841 --> 00:05:11.280
have to when we get there.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.340
Be flexible.

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.320
So I'll introduce
myself in a little bit.

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.040
But first I want to get
a sense of who's here.

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:22.480
And if we had you in
a day-long workshop,

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.970
we would ask what stage
of parenting you're in

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:27.170
and how old your kids are.

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:29.010
And I ask people just
to raise their hands

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:31.480
and take a look
around and see who

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.404
you might identify
with like, what's

00:05:33.404 --> 00:05:35.320
going on in their household
might be something

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:36.910
like what happens in mine.

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:38.860
And know that if we
had a day with you,

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.174
community is so important.

00:05:40.174 --> 00:05:41.590
We would give you
that opportunity

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:42.464
to find these people.

00:05:42.464 --> 00:05:44.590
And you'd do activities
together and have a chance

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:46.100
to talk more in-depth.

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.820
But just out of
curiosity, how many people

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:54.170
here are expecting in their
family their very first child?

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:57.210
You're not quite a parent yet.

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:58.750
And in case there's
anyone watching,

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:01.630
like welcome, welcome.

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:05.980
So if you have a child who
is an infant not yet walking,

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:08.470
raise a hand.

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:09.790
So far that's none here.

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:12.740
So if your children
are preschool-aged.

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:13.240
Let me see.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.156
Oh, we've got a lot of
preschool-aged parents.

00:06:15.156 --> 00:06:15.850
OK.

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:16.540
Hands down.

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:18.890
If you have two children.

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:20.530
Yeah, we have a couple with two.

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:21.030
Thank you.

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:23.440
How about elementary-age
children here?

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:24.420
Elementary school?

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:25.990
Yeah.

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:29.140
How about middle school?

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:29.790
No.

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:31.980
High school?

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.210
Launched children?

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:37.770
OK, no one with children
out of the house.

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:39.820
Now I'll ask, how many
of you-- raise a hand

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:42.700
if you are parenting in
a way that you notice

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.980
is different from the way
your parents parented you.

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:47.500
You just know that
from the get go.

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:48.130
OK.

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:50.610
A lot of people are doing
something a little different.

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:51.610
Thank you, mom and dads.

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:53.430
But we're going to
try something new.

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:55.721
And if you feel like you're
parenting with less support

00:06:55.721 --> 00:06:58.690
than you'd like in any capacity,
whether it's babysitting,

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:02.030
food, partner travel,
raise a hand--

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:03.280
you wish you had some support.

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:04.130
Thank you.

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:06.660
OK.

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:08.960
Next slide, please.

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:09.460
Great.

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:10.918
So I'll tell you
a bit about what--

00:07:10.918 --> 00:07:13.900
I love this word Flight Plan
that you guys use at Google.

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:15.540
And I'll mix that
with intentions.

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:17.020
So I'm supposed
to, as a presenter,

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:19.520
tell you what I'm going to do,
and then do it, and then tell

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:21.610
you what I did.

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:23.770
I may talk a lot.

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:25.301
I may offer a lot of things.

00:07:25.301 --> 00:07:27.550
But at the end of the day,
here's what I hope you get.

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:30.430
I hope you feel that I validated
some feelings and experiences

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:31.990
you have as parents.

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:34.480
OK?

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:37.609
I hope you feel that I
listened to needs that you

00:07:37.609 --> 00:07:38.275
have as parents.

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:44.184
I'm going to offer you
some direct experience.

00:07:44.184 --> 00:07:45.350
We'll give some information.

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:49.080
But I'm going to prioritize and
value your direct experience.

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.210
So I'll invite some mindfulness.

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:54.190
And I'll invite you
to take on some role

00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:57.140
plays, what it might be like to
be in the position of a child.

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:03.140
Yeah, and lastly,
two things I'll do--

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:05.180
this is a tremendous
integration for me

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:07.760
to bring together Design
Thinking and parenting

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:09.410
and mindfulness.

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:11.270
I'm going to give
you a map process

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:14.495
to take a Design Thinking model
and apply it to parenthood.

00:08:14.495 --> 00:08:18.207
And at the end, I'm gonna
encourage self-compassion.

00:08:18.207 --> 00:08:19.040
And I'll say it now.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.530
And I hope I remember
to say it at the end.

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:23.810
If I tell you anything
today, if there's

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:27.170
anything you hear and
you use it to beat up

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:32.270
on yourself as a parent, I
take it all back right now.

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:36.380
So we'll be doing
this kind of stuff

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:39.059
for about a little
less than an hour.

00:08:39.059 --> 00:08:41.210
And then we'll have
at least 20 minutes

00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:42.860
left for Q&amp;A at the end.

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:45.380
There's this Dory thing
which sounds awesome.

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:46.760
Send your questions.

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:49.020
And if there's something
just completely disruptive

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:50.750
and you've got no
idea, raise a hand.

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:53.630
And Jackie may be able to
come to you as we talk.

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:56.000
So we're going to be sharing
parenting challenges.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.521
And Jackie is going to be typing
these into a nice succinct

00:08:58.521 --> 00:08:59.020
list for us.

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:00.560
So it's popcorn style.

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:03.170
And since she's typing,
is it OK if we don't

00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:04.400
bring the microphone around?

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:05.858
Are you guys
comfortable with that?

00:09:05.858 --> 00:09:07.460
Because people will
be able to see.

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:08.060
OK.

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:10.910
So sharing kinds of parenting
challenges you have.

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:12.845
Anyone willing to be
brave and go first?

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:18.088
Yeah.

00:09:18.088 --> 00:09:20.960
AUDIENCE: Teaching the value of
time to a 6 and 1/2 year old.

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.510
DANIELLE SEYBOLD: Yeah,
so how does that show up

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:24.340
when they're not getting
the value of time?

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:27.282
AUDIENCE: Just busy,
spending 10 minutes,

00:09:27.282 --> 00:09:30.092

00:09:30.092 --> 00:09:32.316
and they'll be late
for the classroom.

00:09:32.316 --> 00:09:38.369
Or just more little things that
they don't [INAUDIBLE] getting

00:09:38.369 --> 00:09:40.019
to school in the morning.

00:09:40.019 --> 00:09:41.560
DANIELLE SEYBOLD:
Thank you, and I'll

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:44.660
rely on Jackie to paraphrase.

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:46.180
We have something
related to, they

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:49.870
operate at a different
time schedule than we do.

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:50.470
Who else?

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:51.440
Parenting challenge.

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:53.740
What are situations that
you find challenging?

Do I have anyone else potty
training going on for them?

00:10:09.629 --> 00:10:10.420
I'll raise my hand.

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:11.810
We have that in our house.

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:12.580

Got it.

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:27.400
Thank you.

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:28.680
What else do you have?

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:31.836

was effective discipline.

00:10:31.836 --> 00:10:33.460
DANIELLE SEYBOLD:
Effective discipline.

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:34.240
What happens?

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:36.130
What's the irritating thing
that happens because they

00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:37.255
don't have good discipline?

00:10:37.255 --> 00:10:40.530
AUDIENCE: Their behavior just
continues and sometimes gets

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:41.030
worse.

DANIELLE SEYBOLD: Oh, so the
behavior, you want to stop it.

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:44.398
And it keeps going
and it amplifies and--

00:10:44.398 --> 00:10:45.986
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it's
some way for them

00:10:45.986 --> 00:10:49.762
to learn, from
behavior that might not

00:10:49.762 --> 00:10:51.178
be what we want them to do.

00:10:51.178 --> 00:10:52.219

What's the problem that you

AUDIENCE: Trying out new things
that are beyond their raw skill

00:11:58.010 --> 00:12:01.930
set, but are very good important
skills to have in life.

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:07.340
For example, speaking
out, leadership, or being

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:09.740
more vocal to explain
what things [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:11.646
their feelings--
explain their feelings,

00:12:11.646 --> 00:12:13.777
what's going on in
their mind, and why they

00:12:13.777 --> 00:12:15.522
are behaving in certain ways.

You guys are so skillful

00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:21.689
into a solution framework.

00:12:21.689 --> 00:12:23.730
That's the next list we're
going to come up with.

00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:27.070
I'm like man, you have to go in
reverse to get the problem out.

00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:28.600
That's awesome.

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:29.985

JACLYN LONG: I'm going to
repeat some of these-- downtime,

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:41.950
trying to find time that's
not over-scheduled--

00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:44.285
just for the live stream
folks who can't hear this.

00:12:44.285 --> 00:12:44.670
DANIELLE SEYBOLD: Thank you.

00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:46.090
JACLYN LONG: Because
I can't type any more.

00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:46.770
DANIELLE SEYBOLD: Are
they saying the slides,

00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:47.894
the live stream people now?

00:12:47.894 --> 00:12:48.430
Oh, got it.

00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:49.690
JACLYN LONG: Yes, but
I'm done with the space.

00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:49.945
DANIELLE SEYBOLD: Got it.

00:12:49.945 --> 00:12:51.720
So we'll just consider
that place to be done.

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:53.053
And we'll move to the next list.

00:12:53.053 --> 00:12:56.140
And in light of the
over scheduling and some

00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:58.840
of the time/speed stuff,
and the manipulation--

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:01.340
I'll just mention
some common ones like,

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:06.220
how many people find getting out
the house is sometimes crazy,

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:13.030
or bedtime routines, brushing
teeth, putting on pajamas,

00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:16.105
getting in the car and
buckling the stuff.

00:13:16.105 --> 00:13:17.980
Yeah, I see a lot of

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:20.050
like you're all
in the same boat.

00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:22.530
So the next list, this is
where we are right now.

00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:23.780
Drop of mindfulness--

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:25.780
I had it when you mentioned
the over-scheduling.

00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:28.090
I could completely
feel it in my body.

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:32.480
Yeah.

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:34.290
And the next list is
where we want to go.

00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:37.100
So I invite you to imagine
your child or children

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:42.270
as a fully functional
person out in society.

00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:45.200
And what are the skills
and characteristics

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:48.573
you would hope for them to
have by their early 20s?

00:13:48.573 --> 00:13:51.350
You guys have already
mentioned some of them.

00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:52.096

Thank you.

00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:58.190
And since I'm not sure what's
happening in live stream.

00:13:58.190 --> 00:14:00.590
I'll be repeating back
what people are saying just

00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:02.084
to cover our bases.

00:14:02.084 --> 00:14:03.000
What else do you want?

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.280
What else do you
want them to have?

00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:05.540
You could plant seeds
that are going to grow.

00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:06.998
What do you want
them to grow into?

00:14:06.998 --> 00:14:08.006

00:14:08.006 --> 00:14:10.290

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:44.330
They're independent.

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:45.464
In the very, very back.

00:14:45.464 --> 00:14:46.904
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:46.904 --> 00:14:48.070
DANIELLE SEYBOLD: Thank you.

00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:50.182
So I'm going to
paraphrase and make

00:14:50.182 --> 00:14:52.640
a guess that means that they
would feel that there are lots

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:54.264
of ways of being that
are open to them,

00:14:54.264 --> 00:14:56.540
that they're not limited
by stereotypes based

00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:57.250
on their genders.

00:14:57.250 --> 00:14:57.920
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:58.878
DANIELLE SEYBOLD: Cool.

00:14:58.878 --> 00:15:00.290
Thank you.

00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:04.280
I'm going to coach you to
notice your reaction to I'm

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:05.150
about to say.

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:07.464
Notice thoughts
that might come up.

00:15:07.464 --> 00:15:09.380
Notice if there's a
feeling you have about it,

00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:11.870
or if there's a
reaction in your body.

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:16.160
What if I said that
it's the first list that

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:18.280
gets us to the second list?

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:21.710
That it's an experience of those
challenges and problems that

00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:24.950
helps develop those life
skills and character traits

00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:27.520
in your children.

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:30.016
Kind of a big reframe.

00:15:30.016 --> 00:15:31.640
It doesn't make them
any less annoying.

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:33.560
But they can be useful.

00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:36.360
We could use them for something.

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:38.360
There's another reframe
I'd like to add in there

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:40.400
related to growth mindset.

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:43.760
And we can start coaching
and modeling for our children

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:45.380
and use these words.

00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:50.240
And tell them that mistakes
are opportunities to learn.

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:53.030
And in our better
parenting moments

00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:56.060
when we have enough sleep,
and have had coffee,

00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:59.370
and we feel up to it, we can
take one of those challenges

00:15:59.370 --> 00:16:02.562
as it's happening and
think, this mistake,

00:16:02.562 --> 00:16:03.770
this thing that's happening--

00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:06.050
this is an opportunity
to learn and to teach

00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:09.260
by direct experience
my children how to be,

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:11.600
how to develop these
things on the second list.

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:13.880
And there's another point
I want to make there.

00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:18.680
And I usually say this when I
talk to teachers or parents who

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:23.870
want to share mindfulness with
their children or students.

00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:28.490
We're parenting and teaching
with a long perspective

00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:31.610
in mind, that we're
more concerned

00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:34.029
about the characteristics
and life traits

00:16:34.029 --> 00:16:35.570
that they'll have
by the time they're

00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:39.710
20 than making the
behavior right now stop.

00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:42.620
And so with mindfulness,
with children,

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:45.579
I say it's like planting
a seed for an apple tree.

00:16:45.579 --> 00:16:47.120
Has anybody here
gardened and planted

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:50.262
an apple tree from a
bare root or a seed?

00:16:50.262 --> 00:16:52.137
Yeah, how long did it
take you to get apples?

00:16:52.137 --> 00:16:53.330
AUDIENCE: Several years.

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:54.288
DANIELLE SEYBOLD: Yeah.

00:16:54.288 --> 00:16:55.204
It takes years.

00:16:55.204 --> 00:16:56.120
So you plant the seed.

00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:58.940
And you still have to
water it, the soil.

00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:04.190
And so having a patient,
long view of parenting--

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:05.596
and there's a phrase I'll offer.

00:17:05.596 --> 00:17:07.220
I'll try to mention
when I'm giving you

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:11.119
a positive discipline mantra.

00:17:11.119 --> 00:17:12.544
Beware what works.

00:17:12.544 --> 00:17:15.020
You'll get the experience
of this a little bit later.

00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:19.460
But sometimes, we can
get behavior change

00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:21.650
and get the behavior
we want in a moment,

00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:25.670
but it might be out of sync with
a character trait or life skill

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:27.730
we'd like to plant a seed for.

00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:30.410
And you'll just
experience that later.

00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:33.410
I'm going to do a
check-in on time

00:17:33.410 --> 00:17:36.860
and see what I'm going to
do next in our flight plan.

00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:42.290
In Positive Discipline,
it's the parenting training

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:44.480
that I have the most
direct experience with.

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.920
I also really love hand-in-hand.

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:49.280
We can have a whole long
talk about those two.

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:50.571
And there are others that work.

00:17:50.571 --> 00:17:53.180
But I'm going to give you some
Positive Discipline techniques

00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:54.260
here.

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:55.635
And in Positive
Discipline, there

00:17:55.635 --> 00:17:58.820
are these mental reframes,
like what we just did--

00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:00.710
ones related to mistakes
being opportunities

00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:05.060
to learn, cultivating growth
mindset, be aware of what

00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:07.340
works.

00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:09.890
We'll get to connection
before correction.

00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:11.970
We'll talk more
about that later.

00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:14.690
And we'll, if we have time,
get to this thing called

00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:16.670
the mistake and goals chart.

00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:19.610
So the reframe-- if my
child is acting out,

00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:23.390
a misbehaving child is
a discouraged child.

00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:25.340
So my goal in the
moment is to consider,

00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:27.080
how do I encourage them?

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:29.690
What is their unspoken
need right now?

00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:32.302
And then there
are so many tools.

00:18:32.302 --> 00:18:33.510
There's like a deck of cards.

00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:35.460
There's an app from
Positive Discipline.

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:38.130
So if you wanted to go on,
you can download that app.

00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:38.910
It's cheap.

00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:42.410
It's 52 ideas for what
to do with your kids.

00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:45.120
And there is a process
I will introduce

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:47.520
later about how you
might pick and choose

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:51.420
which of the many, many tools
to use in a specific situation,

00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:53.070
like which one
might be targeted.

00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:54.324
Next slide, please.

00:18:54.324 --> 00:18:56.490
Here's an example of some
of the positive discipline

00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:57.701
tools in a different format.

00:18:57.701 --> 00:18:58.950
Some of these are for parents.

00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:00.330
Some are for children.

00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:03.040
So you've got the positive
discipline tools on the left.

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:08.430
These are tools a parent might
choose to pick up and use.

00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:11.820
And on the right, you see some
tools for children and the idea

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:16.380
that they would come up with
their own options for choices--

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:18.240
what to do if they're angry.

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:20.490
And we'll say more about--

00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:23.700
the time when they are upset is
not the time to develop these.

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:26.640
I used to share just enough
information when I introduced

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:28.515
myself so that your
conscious mind would say,

00:19:28.515 --> 00:19:30.973
this lady maybe has some sense
of what she's talking about.

00:19:30.973 --> 00:19:32.370
I'm open to listening to her.

00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:34.350
And then I just went on.

00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:37.260
And I'm deciding to
open up a little more

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:41.280
and share my
challenges as a parent

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:43.080
from an open and
vulnerable place.

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:48.450
So I'm guessing that
many of you in here

00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:54.330
felt that academic and
professional success

00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:59.197
either came easily or with
planning and diligent effort.

00:19:59.197 --> 00:20:01.530
If that is you, if you feel
like it's you, raise a hand.

00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:03.362
If you did that school
thing super great,

00:20:03.362 --> 00:20:05.820
if you did the job thing well,
if there was something hard,

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:06.660
you made a plan.

00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:08.040
And you did it.

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:10.200
And that was me.

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:13.680
My husband is also an engineer.

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:15.660
My background is in
biomedical engineering.

00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:16.830
I did that very well.

00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:22.530
I went and I worked in startup
venture-funded medical device

00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:25.260
companies as an R&amp;D engineer.

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:26.180
And then I had kids.

00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:29.240
And I'm like, I suck at this.

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:32.100
And the worst thing is
I'd read the books--

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:35.660
the sleep method and
the soothing method.

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:38.146
And it was baffling.

00:20:38.146 --> 00:20:40.020
For every book I read,
there was another book

00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:41.250
that said the opposite.

00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:42.847
And I wanted things
to be consistent.

00:20:42.847 --> 00:20:44.430
And I wanted there
to be one solution.

00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:46.547
Like, what is the formula?

00:20:46.547 --> 00:20:47.130
I know myself.

00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:49.560
I can just make a plan
if I got the formula.

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:52.480
I'll do this thing.

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:54.420
And it's not like that.

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:56.460
It wasn't in my experience.

00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:58.410
My whole thesis was around--

00:20:58.410 --> 00:21:01.050
which I wrote many years
after I had children--

00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:03.810
how to use the difficulties
in adjusting to early

00:21:03.810 --> 00:21:05.805
parenthood for personal
growth and development.

00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:10.530
And it was about this time--

00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:13.480
I remember so clearly
having a conversation.

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:16.350
I was at a bigger company,
public medical device company,

00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:19.530
with production on
multiple continents.

00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:22.400
And our director of
operations shared with me

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:26.070
that the most stressful
part of his day

00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:30.410
happened before
he left his house.

00:21:30.410 --> 00:21:32.907
It was really validating
for me to hear that.

00:21:32.907 --> 00:21:34.490
It was weird to have
that conversation

00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:36.260
with a man at work.

00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:38.935
Because I think it's until this
year of working that I felt

00:21:38.935 --> 00:21:40.310
my parenthood was
something I had

00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:45.242
to hide in the
professional workplace.

00:21:45.242 --> 00:21:48.230
Let me get back to my point.

00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:50.180
It's different sharing
from a personal place

00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:52.596
instead of just giving you
enough information to trust me.

00:21:54.910 --> 00:21:57.100
So I'm here to
give you bad news.

00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:57.945
So I went out.

00:21:57.945 --> 00:21:59.320
I'm like, OK,
what's the formula?

00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:00.700
And I'll do it.

00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:04.070
Did parent training, I trained
to become a parent trainer

00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:05.710
in Positive Discipline.

00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:08.810
I went to graduate school in
marriage and family therapy.

00:22:08.810 --> 00:22:11.850
I did more training at
another parenting technique.

00:22:11.850 --> 00:22:13.960
I've got a lot of information.

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:16.990
And as I took that
process on, I'm

00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:20.300
looking for, what
do I need to do?

00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:24.160
And I kept learning that
there's not one thing to do

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:26.010
and that relationships
and people aren't

00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:29.320
as easy to put in
a formula as what I

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:30.794
had worked with professionally.

00:22:30.794 --> 00:22:31.585
It's kind of scary.

00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:36.525
And I've got worse news for you.

00:22:36.525 --> 00:22:37.900
The thing I have
learned is being

00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:41.680
consistent across
the board, is when

00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:46.810
my kids are hot and emotional,
when I am emotional--

00:22:46.810 --> 00:22:50.920
when my buttons are
pushed, nothing good

00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:53.136
can come of trying to be like--

00:22:53.136 --> 00:22:54.010
I can't do parenting.

00:22:54.010 --> 00:22:56.290
I can't teach all those
skills and characteristics

00:22:56.290 --> 00:22:57.790
in the moment.

00:22:57.790 --> 00:23:00.340
I might be able to
navigate that moment

00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:01.840
a little more skillfully.

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:03.910
But the parenting
stuff has to just come

00:23:03.910 --> 00:23:05.552
and be put on the shelf.

00:23:05.552 --> 00:23:07.510
There's actually a
structure of family meetings

00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:08.426
you can do every week.

00:23:08.426 --> 00:23:11.920
But that's really
frustrating because I wanted

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:14.550
to make that moment go better.

00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:16.960
So the bad news is,
there's no formula.

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:20.350
The worst news is, in the
moment when things are hard,

00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:23.180
is not the time to do that.

00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:25.780
But there is some hope.

00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:27.170
There's a process.

00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:30.190
And this is where Design
Thinking came to my rescue.

00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:34.560
There's a process of
being mindful to what's

00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:40.850
happening in the moment,
taking that information,

00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:44.310
bring a little bit of parent
training in considering,

00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:46.980
how might I redesign
that next time?

00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:49.920
Learning some skills to
talk to my children about,

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:53.430
what can we do
differently next time?

00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:55.860
If I'm fortunate to
be in a formal class

00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:57.750
with other parents,
I can role play that.

00:23:57.750 --> 00:24:00.099
I can ask to be in the
position of my child

00:24:00.099 --> 00:24:02.640
and tell someone like, could
you please say this thing to me?

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:03.690
And I'll hear it.

00:24:03.690 --> 00:24:05.460
And I'll see what that's like.

00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:08.460
So you can collect data on
what that would feel like.

00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:10.440
And go out and try
it in the real world.

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:13.410
And here's the saving grace.

00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:16.640
I don't expect that to work.

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:18.001
I'm running an experiment.

00:24:18.001 --> 00:24:19.250
And I'm going to collect data.

00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:21.500
And I'm going to
see how it went.

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:24.464
And then I don't have to
give up if it went poorly.

00:24:24.464 --> 00:24:26.630
I go back to the drawing
board and say, OK what data

00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:27.920
did I get?

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:29.120
Let me think about that.

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:30.510
And I'm going to try again.

00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:33.285
So it's this prototype
and iterate process.

00:24:33.285 --> 00:24:35.660
It's not this one book that
tells me what's going to work

00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:37.160
and what to do.

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:40.430
I'll talk more about this
Design Thinking applied

00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:42.954
to parenting a little later.

00:24:42.954 --> 00:24:44.120
We'll go through an example.

00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:49.470
And let's move to--

00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:51.090
So let me just pause a second.

00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:55.050
This is a formal
Stanford-designed thinking map.

00:24:55.050 --> 00:24:57.390
It fits very well.

00:24:57.390 --> 00:25:00.870
What I add-- so I'm coming
from the bottom up with my own

00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:03.780
engineering experience--

00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:05.190
I'll talk some about that.

00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:07.398
If you don't remember this
slide, remember prototype,

00:25:07.398 --> 00:25:09.360
prototype think.

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:11.970
And then put some
empathy and mindfulness.

00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:13.830
Prototype, prototype, think.

00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:16.640
That's the model I
learned in my profession.

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:20.430
And I'm giving you some Positive
Discipline skills dropped in.

00:25:20.430 --> 00:25:22.890
And everything's going to be
rooted in both mindfulness

00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:26.220
and attachment theory because
I can't put those lenses away

00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:28.120
no matter what I do.

00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:32.880
I'm going to go through this
map of Positive Discipline

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:35.550
explained by some
concepts from Dan Siegel

00:25:35.550 --> 00:25:38.880
a little more quickly so
that we can have more time

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:40.660
to have direct experience.

00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:44.780
But the four points I
want to make is that--

00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:46.260
oh, let's just go
do [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:47.460
I'll just do them as we go.

00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:50.280
So next slide.

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:53.010
So Name it to Tame it--

00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:55.710
that's the mantra
from Dan Siegel.

00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:58.980
Here's an example of Positive
Discipline tools we can--

00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:00.690
I was gonna say share
with our children.

00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:04.020
But it's actually
useful for yourself too.

00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:06.630
So if you're having an
emotion, you can map it.

00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:09.420
What is the word
for this emotion?

00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:11.880
And if you look at
the list of words,

00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:13.560
that's a fine-tuning
of-- the columns

00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:18.180
are glad, sad, mad, and scared.

00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:20.610
But there's tons of other
words that are little nuance

00:26:20.610 --> 00:26:22.380
flavors of those emotions.

00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:24.120
And so we can share
this with our kids.

00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:26.730
And I'll just say that since
this book was published,

00:26:26.730 --> 00:26:30.780
there is some FMRI research
that shows people when they're

00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:32.869
shown images that would
trigger an emotion,

00:26:32.869 --> 00:26:34.410
and their limbic
system is activated.

00:26:34.410 --> 00:26:37.650
They have a lot of
activity in the amygdala.

00:26:37.650 --> 00:26:40.770
Once they name the emotion
they're having, you can

00:26:40.770 --> 00:26:44.760
see a down regulation of
the activity in the amygdala

00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:45.910
and the limbic system.

00:26:45.910 --> 00:26:49.200
So I like to anecdotally, people
use the tools, and it works.

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:51.720
As a biomedical
engineer, I'm always

00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:54.810
curious if I can find
a mechanism of action.

00:26:54.810 --> 00:26:57.690
So it just feels good
that those are integrated.

00:26:57.690 --> 00:27:02.430
Curiosity questions--
in Positive Discipline,

00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:06.510
the mantra is "Ask, don't tell."

00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:10.740
And so it puts the child
in the driver's seat.

00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:13.860
It gives them responsibility.

00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:17.790
We assume that they're going
to be applying thinking to try

00:27:17.790 --> 00:27:19.890
to solve their own problems.

00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:24.480
And so you would ask them
instead of telling them,

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:28.950
go get your homework done,
or go brush your teeth--

00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:32.190
what support would you need
to get your homework done?

00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:34.590
You would maybe ask them
to come up with a plan

00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:37.290
and set a time to hear
their plan in the future.

00:27:37.290 --> 00:27:39.780
For the younger ones with the
teeth, this idea of letting

00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:42.770
routines be the
boss, like it's 7:30.

00:27:42.770 --> 00:27:43.980
What do we do at 7:30?

00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:48.060
What do we do to keep our
teeth clean and fresh?

00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:50.730
And so the way we
talk to our children

00:27:50.730 --> 00:27:54.060
encourages them to use
both logic and reasoning

00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:56.790
and verbal parts
of their brains,

00:27:56.790 --> 00:27:59.910
as well as to experience
the emotion they're having.

00:27:59.910 --> 00:28:01.760
So we start to
build integration.

00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:03.740
Next slide.

00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:05.060
Connection before correction.

00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:09.460
How many are you familiar with
the Still Face Experiment?

00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:09.960
OK.

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:13.560
So these pictures are from
a pretty famous experiment

00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:17.070
with parents and young
children, pre-verbal.

00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:22.050
And go home and Google
Still Face Experiment.

00:28:22.050 --> 00:28:24.720
It's the most uncomfortable
minute and a half of video

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:25.710
you'll see.

00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:27.730
So they ask a mom to
come into the lab.

00:28:27.730 --> 00:28:31.620
You have normal, nonverbal,
reciprocal interaction

00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:33.050
with a pre-verbal child.

00:28:33.050 --> 00:28:33.840
Mom's smiling.

00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:35.190
Baby's smiling and pointing.

00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:36.270
The mom looks.

00:28:36.270 --> 00:28:39.280
And then they ask
her to turn away.

00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:43.190
And she looks back still
face, not responsive.

00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:47.170
Oh, even thinking
about it now makes

00:28:47.170 --> 00:28:49.300
my body very uncomfortable.

00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:54.520
The child goes through multiple
stages of confusion, upset.

00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:56.530
They reach for the mom.

00:28:56.530 --> 00:28:59.860
They try to point and
use their usual, come on.

00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:01.300
You usually do this.

00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:05.020
And then just goes ballistic,
bawls, breaks eye contact

00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:06.790
and looks away.

00:29:06.790 --> 00:29:11.500
And it's the most
powerful imagery

00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:14.920
I've seen about the importance
of nonverbal communication.

00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:19.150
We hear that like 70% of all
communication is nonverbal.

00:29:19.150 --> 00:29:20.560
And my guess is--

00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:22.720
I don't know if there's
research around this--

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:24.880
the communication
with own children,

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:29.890
it's probably higher because
they're so tuned into us.

00:29:29.890 --> 00:29:33.730
And our reactions are so key
for their basic survival.

00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:34.987
They know us.

00:29:34.987 --> 00:29:36.820
And so I'm gonna invite
you to stand up now.

00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:38.860
And we're going to
a short activity

00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:40.855
around nonverbal communication.

00:29:46.946 --> 00:29:48.570
I'm going to find a
place where I think

00:29:48.570 --> 00:29:51.520
the most people can see me.

00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:54.310
And you're just going to mimic
what I'm doing with my body.

00:30:07.444 --> 00:30:08.610
OK, we're gonna do it again.

00:30:08.610 --> 00:30:10.200
And I'll add some words.

00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:11.780
Eye contact.

00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:12.280
You get it.

00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:12.990
Yeah, I like that.

00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:13.698
Say, eye contact.

00:30:13.698 --> 00:30:15.315
I like eye contact.

00:30:15.315 --> 00:30:16.065
Facial expression.

00:30:16.065 --> 00:30:17.324
AUDIENCE: Facial expression.

00:30:17.324 --> 00:30:18.615
DANIELLE SEYBOLD: Tone of voice

00:30:18.615 --> 00:30:20.290
AUDIENCE: Tone of voice.

00:30:20.290 --> 00:30:21.581
DANIELLE SEYBOLD: Body posture.

00:30:21.581 --> 00:30:22.810
AUDIENCE: Body posture.

00:30:22.810 --> 00:30:23.934
DANIELLE SEYBOLD: Gestures.

00:30:23.934 --> 00:30:24.900
AUDIENCE: Gestures.

00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:25.941
DANIELLE SEYBOLD: Timing.

00:30:25.941 --> 00:30:26.650
AUDIENCE: Timing.

00:30:26.650 --> 00:30:27.816
DANIELLE SEYBOLD: Intensity.

00:30:27.816 --> 00:30:28.740
AUDIENCE: Intensity.

00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:30.000
DANIELLE SEYBOLD: OK.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.170
I'll talk a little more.

00:30:31.170 --> 00:30:33.150
You can just do the
non-verbals if you want.

00:30:33.150 --> 00:30:35.790
So eye contact-- am I
looking at my child?

00:30:35.790 --> 00:30:37.590
If they're smaller,
am I on my knees

00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:39.360
so I'm making eye contact?

00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:41.070
Are my eyes rolling?

00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:44.430
Do I look like I'm thinking
about something else?

00:30:44.430 --> 00:30:48.000
Facial expression-- is
my face soft and open?

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.510
Is my jaw clenched?

00:30:50.510 --> 00:30:53.340
Did I walk into this interaction
holding the tension of my day,

00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:56.220
and you can see it on my face?

00:30:56.220 --> 00:31:01.180
Tone of voice-- do
I sound sarcastic?

00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:07.870
Or do I sound curious,
engaged, warm, inviting?

00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:13.240
Body posture-- is
my stress showing?

00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:15.120
Again, if they're
small, is my posture

00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:17.340
down and moving towards them?

00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:18.370
Am I held back?

00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:25.930
Gestures-- what are my gestures
communicating to my children?

00:31:25.930 --> 00:31:29.020
Timing-- it's about,
is this the right time

00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:31.660
to have this happening?

00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:34.810
Meaning, are people upset?

00:31:34.810 --> 00:31:37.090
And we'll do another
activity about that.

00:31:37.090 --> 00:31:39.490
Is there a better time to
do what I'm trying to do,

00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:41.500
when my child will be more open?

00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:44.440
And intensity-- do
I sound passionate?

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:45.910
Do I sound angry?

00:31:45.910 --> 00:31:50.371
Do I sound bored and like
I'd rather be somewhere else.

00:31:50.371 --> 00:31:52.120
And so we'll do it one
last time together.

00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:53.780
And we'll just repeat the words.

00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:54.280
Eye contact.

00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:55.640
AUDIENCE: Eye contact.

00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:56.155
DANIELLE SEYBOLD:
Facial expression.

00:31:56.155 --> 00:31:57.460
AUDIENCE: Facial expression.

00:31:57.460 --> 00:31:58.060
DANIELLE SEYBOLD: Tone of voice.

00:31:58.060 --> 00:31:59.420
AUDIENCE: Tone of voice.

00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:00.070
DANIELLE SEYBOLD: Body posture.

00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:01.029
AUDIENCE: Body posture.

00:32:01.029 --> 00:32:02.111
DANIELLE SEYBOLD: Gestures

00:32:02.111 --> 00:32:02.920
AUDIENCE: Gestures.

00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:03.430
AUDIENCE: Timing

00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:04.210
AUDIENCE: Timing.

00:32:04.210 --> 00:32:05.376
DANIELLE SEYBOLD: Intensity.

00:32:05.376 --> 00:32:06.520
AUDIENCE: Intensity.

00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:08.110
DANIELLE SEYBOLD: And so these
are skills that I would--

00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:09.609
if we had you for
a workshop, and we

00:32:09.609 --> 00:32:11.290
started to do more
role play, we'd

00:32:11.290 --> 00:32:13.480
bring more attention
to and more noticing

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:15.550
of your own non-verbal
communication

00:32:15.550 --> 00:32:18.190
and that of your fellow parents.

00:32:18.190 --> 00:32:19.510
Thank you.

00:32:19.510 --> 00:32:25.082
So timing-- Dan Siegel has
this awesome brain model.

00:32:25.082 --> 00:32:27.040
It's called the brain in
the palm of your hand.

00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:28.330
And we can do it together.

00:32:28.330 --> 00:32:30.070
So stick your hand up.

00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:32.290
And it's like your
wrist is the brain stem.

00:32:32.290 --> 00:32:34.210
So this keeps our
heart rate steady,

00:32:34.210 --> 00:32:35.860
keeps our breathing happening--

00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:37.150
basic survival.

00:32:37.150 --> 00:32:40.350
Take your thumb and
fold it into your palm.

00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:43.940
This is your limbic system
storing emotions, storing

00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:48.830
emotional memories,
triggering threat and alert,

00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:51.860
beginning the coordination of
a fight or flight response.

00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:55.230
Close your fingers down.

00:32:55.230 --> 00:32:57.937
Cortex and prefrontal cortex.

00:32:57.937 --> 00:32:59.520
And this part right
here in the middle

00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:03.330
is the most key for
higher order thinking.

00:33:03.330 --> 00:33:08.080
So making sense of emotions,
labeling them, using language,

00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:12.720
making good decisions, planning,
envisioning the future.

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:17.040
And notice how this part touches
the limbic system, touches

00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:19.410
your thumb, and it comes
back and touches the palm.

00:33:19.410 --> 00:33:22.020
It literally physically has
connections to these other two

00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:24.480
areas and helps regulate.

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:25.890
Now, there's
something Dan Siegel

00:33:25.890 --> 00:33:27.390
calls "flipping your lid."

00:33:27.390 --> 00:33:28.600
Take your fingers.

00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:29.984
Go like that.

00:33:29.984 --> 00:33:30.900
Then put it back down.

00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:33.400
So let's imagine--

00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:35.970
Can I put you on the spot
for giving a stressful child

00:33:35.970 --> 00:33:38.640
interaction moment, a common
one for parents, like--

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:39.552
AUDIENCE: When
you're late for work.

00:33:39.552 --> 00:33:40.920
And your kid's not
putting on your shoes.

00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:41.870
DANIELLE SEYBOLD: Yes.

00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:42.661
I am late for work.

00:33:42.661 --> 00:33:44.610
And my kid's not
putting on their shoes.

00:33:44.610 --> 00:33:46.380
That has happened this week.

00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:50.100
And so we try to apply
more pressure put on shoes.

00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:53.100
And they freak out.

00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:55.380
They've just done this.

00:33:55.380 --> 00:33:58.470
And depending on how late
we are in our state of mind,

00:33:58.470 --> 00:34:01.620
we may have also gone like this.

00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:05.040
And so if you see what's leading
right now, what's unregulated,

00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:07.020
are these parts of the
brain that you would not

00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:08.310
make good decisions with.

00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:11.370
You would not lead from this
in your professional lives.

00:34:11.370 --> 00:34:14.429
And so there's a concept called
"taking time to feel better."

00:34:14.429 --> 00:34:15.960
It's the opposite of time out.

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:18.239
It's also self-care.

00:34:18.239 --> 00:34:21.570
So in this moment,
is my child going

00:34:21.570 --> 00:34:23.940
to be open to any parent
training I have about being

00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:26.429
responsible or timely?

00:34:26.429 --> 00:34:29.489
Probably not.

00:34:29.489 --> 00:34:31.100
I'll just say for myself--

00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:33.929
is my tone of voice
going to be something

00:34:33.929 --> 00:34:36.389
warm and inviting and
safe and supportive?

00:34:36.389 --> 00:34:38.699
My voice is not in that moment.

00:34:38.699 --> 00:34:42.480
And so we all flip our lids.

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:45.457
Our children flip their lids.

00:34:45.457 --> 00:34:47.040
I love, there's this
bit of research--

00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:49.969
I'll step into this, as a
marriage and family therapist,

00:34:49.969 --> 00:34:52.739
I can tell you from
couples research

00:34:52.739 --> 00:34:56.139
that once the heart rate
exceeds 100 beats per minute,

00:34:56.139 --> 00:34:58.500
the advice is there's not
good communication happening.

00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:01.980
People need to step away
and take at least 20 minutes

00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:03.690
but no longer than an hour.

00:35:03.690 --> 00:35:06.405
There are practices about what
you might do to feel better.

00:35:06.405 --> 00:35:08.280
And then you come back
and you talk about it.

00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:11.130
They actually sell heart rate
monitors to do this at home.

00:35:11.130 --> 00:35:13.920
I kind of wish I would
do the same as a parent.

00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:16.560
So we flip our lids.

00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:21.420
If we have the ability to step
away and take maybe five, maybe

00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:24.920
10 minutes to take
care of ourselves.

00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:26.950
In a second, I'll have
you turn to a partner

00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:30.300
and maybe say one or two things
you could think of that you

00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:34.070
could do in five to 10 minutes
to feel a little better

00:35:34.070 --> 00:35:39.060
and down regulate
your physiology.

00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:40.890
And when your kids
are not upset,

00:35:40.890 --> 00:35:42.900
you can work with them
on a similar list.

00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:44.520
Wheel of choice.

00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:47.190
What are things you
can do to feel better.

00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:47.812
Yeah.

00:35:47.812 --> 00:35:49.464
AUDIENCE: Actually,
the moment where

00:35:49.464 --> 00:35:52.060
you don't have the five or ten
minutes when you get worked up.

00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:54.447
So--

00:35:54.447 --> 00:35:55.530
DANIELLE SEYBOLD: Survive.

00:35:55.530 --> 00:35:56.155
Get through it.

00:35:58.404 --> 00:35:59.320
I'll think about that.

00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:04.100
And Jackie probably has a
better response in the Q&amp;A.

00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:06.350
But yeah, it's not the
time to use the tools,

00:36:06.350 --> 00:36:10.460
unless you have use them
and you can reference them.

00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:12.480
And let me pause.

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:14.930
Here's what I do
in my household.

00:36:14.930 --> 00:36:17.840
There's a certain
threshold that I

00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:19.825
will tolerate my
kids being upset,

00:36:19.825 --> 00:36:21.200
and we still go
with the process.

00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:28.450
And once they peak in emotion,
I will say, you know what?

00:36:28.450 --> 00:36:30.090
We're no longer
trying to be on time.

00:36:30.090 --> 00:36:30.990
And I'll come.

00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:32.460
And I'll break.

00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:33.810
And I'll get down.

00:36:33.810 --> 00:36:36.180
And I'll give a hug.

00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:38.040
And instead of being--

00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:41.770
Jackie, could you come
be in front of me?

00:36:41.770 --> 00:36:42.270
Perfect.

00:36:42.270 --> 00:36:44.910
And you're a kid.

00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:48.700
Usually when I'm parenting,
I'm face-to-face right here.

00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:53.910
So my son is so sad that I see
this is what he needs right now

00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:55.789
is side-to-side.

00:36:55.789 --> 00:36:56.580
Or come from front.

00:36:59.370 --> 00:37:03.060
I just stop anything
related to the shoes.

00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:04.360
This is what's happening.

00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:06.800
This is the important
thing in the moment.

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:08.390
Yeah.

00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:10.600
Tough morning, huh?

00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:12.150
Yeah.

00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:13.095
It's OK.

00:37:13.095 --> 00:37:14.260
Let's take a break.

00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:16.060
And I have two kids.

00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:18.550
Anybody with two kids knows
there are sibling issues.

00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:20.461
So this is our thing.

00:37:20.461 --> 00:37:22.210
I won't do it because
people can't see us.

00:37:22.210 --> 00:37:24.632
We actually sit on the floor.

00:37:24.632 --> 00:37:27.090
It sucks having a mom who's a
therapist and parent trainer.

00:37:27.090 --> 00:37:29.717
Because I make us hold hands.

00:37:29.717 --> 00:37:30.550
We sit on the floor.

00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:31.425
I make us hold hands.

00:37:31.425 --> 00:37:32.950
We don't have to
talk about it yet.

00:37:32.950 --> 00:37:35.200
They may not be ready
to talk about it.

00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:38.500
But we're in physical contact.

00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:40.570
We're breathing again.

00:37:40.570 --> 00:37:43.500
And then, it almost sounds
like restorative justice.

00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:46.360
I'll let them each talk
about their experience.

00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:48.400
And they'll first
try to talk to me.

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:50.751
And I'll coach them, if you
have something say to him,

00:37:50.751 --> 00:37:51.250
you can say.

00:37:51.250 --> 00:37:53.220
Or just say, I feel.

00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:56.390
Because they want me to step
in and declare a winner.

00:37:56.390 --> 00:37:58.760
And I step out of that.

00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:01.840
So each person gets to talk
about how they're feeling.

00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:03.580
And often, we still
get there on time

00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:07.000
because that was faster than--

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.640
I have scooped the
little four-year-old body

00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:11.080
and we're going to the car.

00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:14.590
And I forgot to
mention my three lives.

00:38:14.590 --> 00:38:18.070
So I do work as a
professional project

00:38:18.070 --> 00:38:22.730
manager, an R&amp;D engineer doing
venture-funded medical design.

00:38:22.730 --> 00:38:24.700
I'm also a therapist.

00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:27.560
And I'm in the school system.

00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:29.860
I'm in preschool, and
I'm in third grade

00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:32.110
every week for about six hours.

00:38:32.110 --> 00:38:36.340
I also do work with students
and adults in groups.

00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:37.252
I teach mindfulness.

00:38:37.252 --> 00:38:37.960
I do one-on-one .

00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:40.240
Counseling and I have a
small private practice

00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:42.850
where I see adults,
couples, children.

00:38:42.850 --> 00:38:44.800
And then I am over here.

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:48.850
I am lead parent at a
parent participation school.

00:38:48.850 --> 00:38:51.070
And my husband is the vice
president of a startup.

00:38:51.070 --> 00:38:54.190
And he travels internationally
60% of the time.

00:38:54.190 --> 00:38:56.775
And I pick my kids
up most days by four.

00:38:59.350 --> 00:39:03.400
I say that not to be like--
no, I'm not Superwoman.

00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:05.260
Because I can relate.

00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:06.420
I am living that life.

00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:08.770
I know what it's like,
both in the parenting

00:39:08.770 --> 00:39:10.160
and the professional side.

00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:11.830
And I'll tell you,
I brought that up

00:39:11.830 --> 00:39:13.810
to mention I'm in
the school system.

00:39:13.810 --> 00:39:16.750
And I'm with students
in a class setting.

00:39:16.750 --> 00:39:19.150
And I love being with
the three-year-olds

00:39:19.150 --> 00:39:22.690
because their emotions
are so raw and so there.

00:39:22.690 --> 00:39:24.760
And this process
is very much what

00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:29.830
we'll coach the children in
school to deal with each other.

00:39:29.830 --> 00:39:31.940
I digress.

00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:34.570
JACLYN LONG: I just
want to add that if you

00:39:34.570 --> 00:39:37.240
go to mindbodymoms.com
on the home page,

00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:39.550
you can click a little button.

00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:41.950
And there's a free
video series that you

00:39:41.950 --> 00:39:46.750
can look at to explore how to
keep your cool with your kids.

00:39:46.750 --> 00:39:49.030
So instead of flipping my
lid in the moment, what can

00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:51.730
I do to keep my
cool with my kids?

00:39:51.730 --> 00:39:56.075
So that will be a free video
series that we offer you.

00:39:56.075 --> 00:39:58.200
DANIELLE SEYBOLD: And we're
going to that whole two

00:39:58.200 --> 00:39:59.320
minute with a partner.

00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:01.009
I'll ring the bell
at one minute--

00:40:01.009 --> 00:40:03.550
one or two things that you might
do to keep your cool instead

00:40:03.550 --> 00:40:05.710
of flipping your lid in
one of these moments.

00:40:08.029 --> 00:40:09.570
JACLYN LONG: Is the
timer still here?

00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:15.650
DANIELLE SEYBOLD: So share
with a partner, actually,

00:40:15.650 --> 00:40:18.920
one thing you might do to keep
your cool instead of flipping

00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:22.660
your lid-- an act of self-care.

00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:30.176
And I can't emphasize enough
the importance of modeling this.

00:40:30.176 --> 00:40:32.300
If you feel like it's hard
to take care of yourself

00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:33.890
instead of taking care of
your kids in the moment,

00:40:33.890 --> 00:40:34.890
raise a hand.

00:40:34.890 --> 00:40:37.160
Every single person
finds it difficult.

00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:40.400
Your inspiration is
that in that moment,

00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:44.420
you are now modeling what
you want your child to do.

00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:45.890
That's like your excuse.

00:40:45.890 --> 00:40:48.440
And you can be
direct about that.

00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:51.290
And think about how you
would put that in language

00:40:51.290 --> 00:40:52.970
and talk to your
children about it.

00:40:52.970 --> 00:40:56.930
And this hand model is something
you can teach even pretty

00:40:56.930 --> 00:40:57.950
young children.

00:40:57.950 --> 00:41:00.924
And they seem to get it.

00:41:00.924 --> 00:41:02.090
This is one of those tools--

00:41:02.090 --> 00:41:03.465
I'll point out a
couple of places

00:41:03.465 --> 00:41:06.140
where there's something
shareable with your children

00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:06.820
to prime you.

00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:08.240
Oh yeah, maybe I'll
do that with my kids.

00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:09.323
I'll tell them about that.

00:41:09.323 --> 00:41:11.130
Next one.

00:41:11.130 --> 00:41:13.460
So I'm not going to
talk about all this.

00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:14.840
This is just for you to look at.

00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:17.180
You read much more
quickly than you listen.

00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:20.210
These are the topics
we would cover and go

00:41:20.210 --> 00:41:23.870
more in-depth with if
I had you in a workshop

00:41:23.870 --> 00:41:25.414
or for parent training.

00:41:25.414 --> 00:41:27.080
If you see those
buzzwords on something,

00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:30.710
I'd recommend reading it
in your Facebook feed.

00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:33.260
And my preference is
to be experiential.

00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:36.396
So we try to give you a direct
experience of these concepts.

00:41:36.396 --> 00:41:37.520
A little bit of education--

00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:39.980
take the ideas, the
latest Facebook read--

00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:42.417
let's put that
into an experience.

00:41:42.417 --> 00:41:44.000
And then it's no
longer stored up here

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.370
with this data overload
and all the things

00:41:46.370 --> 00:41:48.920
you ought to remember
when you read once.

00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:52.280
I find for myself and
people I work with,

00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:54.110
once you've had the
experience, it's

00:41:54.110 --> 00:41:59.510
more accessible without having
to spend effort remembering it.

00:41:59.510 --> 00:42:02.960
And I'll highlight the top two
we're going to play with next--

00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:07.320
so role play and
using mindfulness.

00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:11.650
I teach mindfulness to
children and adults.

00:42:11.650 --> 00:42:13.970
And in the context
of parent training,

00:42:13.970 --> 00:42:16.670
mindfulness is both a
data collection tool--

00:42:16.670 --> 00:42:20.960
so interpersonal mindfulness
in this interaction while life

00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:22.250
is happening.

00:42:22.250 --> 00:42:23.090
What am I thinking?

00:42:23.090 --> 00:42:24.320
What am I feeling?

00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:26.430
What am I deciding?

00:42:26.430 --> 00:42:28.980
And it's also a
tool for self-care.

00:42:28.980 --> 00:42:30.720
And that's where some
of the mindfulness

00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:33.780
starts to verge more into
relaxation techniques,

00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:36.940
but building that trait
mindfulness as well.

00:42:36.940 --> 00:42:39.030
So I'll put these
questions on the board

00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:43.110
because I'll invite you to refer
to them as we do our next two

00:42:43.110 --> 00:42:44.774
activities.

00:42:44.774 --> 00:42:46.690
So as we're going to do
it, we're going to do,

00:42:46.690 --> 00:42:48.690
what am I thinking?

00:42:48.690 --> 00:42:50.460
What am I feeling?

00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:55.710
And that means my emotions and
also just raw body sensations.

00:42:55.710 --> 00:42:57.720
What am I deciding?

00:42:57.720 --> 00:43:00.800
What am I deciding about myself?

00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:02.715
What am I deciding
about other people?

00:43:02.715 --> 00:43:04.090
The other people's
probably going

00:43:04.090 --> 00:43:07.720
to be me because I'm going to
be giving you some commands.

00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:10.060
What am I deciding
about the world?

00:43:10.060 --> 00:43:11.440
Am I lovable?

00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:12.700
Am I good?

00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:13.480
Am I bad?

00:43:16.180 --> 00:43:16.990
Do they like me?

00:43:16.990 --> 00:43:18.250
Are they trustworthy?

00:43:18.250 --> 00:43:20.095
Or do they make any sense?

00:43:20.095 --> 00:43:21.220
How is the world out there?

00:43:21.220 --> 00:43:21.910
Is it safe?

00:43:21.910 --> 00:43:24.880
Are there a ton of
support and resources?

00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:26.910
Am I going to have
to fend for myself?

00:43:26.910 --> 00:43:30.640
And notice, you might even
be aware of a strategy

00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:32.150
you're coming up with.

00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:36.185
So here's what I'm going
to do so that I can thrive

00:43:36.185 --> 00:43:38.560
so that I can get through this
experience for kids that's

00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:39.830
often--

00:43:39.830 --> 00:43:42.160
here is what I'm thinking,
feeling, and deciding.

00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:45.670
Therefore, I must
do this to achieve

00:43:45.670 --> 00:43:47.640
significance and
belonging in the world

00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:49.370
or some sense of control.

00:43:49.370 --> 00:43:53.080
So if you are in
a remote room, I

00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:54.820
invite you to play
along just like you

00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:57.640
would be here in this room.

00:43:57.640 --> 00:44:04.772
And I'm going to
give you commands.

00:44:04.772 --> 00:44:06.254
Don't sit down.

00:44:09.218 --> 00:44:10.700
Don't sit down.

00:44:14.652 --> 00:44:16.134
Don't sit down.

00:44:19.100 --> 00:44:20.162
Don't look at me.

00:44:20.162 --> 00:44:20.870
Don't look at me.

00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:27.464
Don't put your
hands by your side.

00:44:30.922 --> 00:44:32.898
Don't close your mouth.

00:44:35.862 --> 00:44:37.344
Don't stand up.

00:44:40.810 --> 00:44:43.880
Don't open your mouth.

00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:44.600
OK.

00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:48.080
Find another very confused
partner and talk about this.

00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:50.060
What were you thinking,
feeling, and deciding?

00:44:50.060 --> 00:44:54.110
We'll give a minute, and
then we'll share as a group.

00:44:54.110 --> 00:44:57.530
And coming back to the
group, bring the pearls.

00:44:57.530 --> 00:45:00.980
Raise your hands to share
what you guys came up with.

00:45:00.980 --> 00:45:03.290
And here, if you're
open, is it OK

00:45:03.290 --> 00:45:06.600
if we bring a microphone
so that folks can hear you

00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:07.626
in the other rooms?

00:45:07.626 --> 00:45:08.250
Thanks, Jackie.

00:45:08.250 --> 00:45:09.130
So just raise a hand.

00:45:09.130 --> 00:45:10.130
And Jackie will come by.

00:45:10.130 --> 00:45:11.504
And you can share
what you guys--

00:45:14.620 --> 00:45:18.272
what was your
experience of that?

00:45:18.272 --> 00:45:22.050
AUDIENCE: The
expectations were unclear.

00:45:22.050 --> 00:45:23.720
That's just one point.

00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:24.380
DANIELLE SEYBOLD:
So in that moment,

00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:26.171
what were you thinking
or feeling about me?

00:45:30.130 --> 00:45:32.430
AUDIENCE: I didn't know what
you wanted us to do, so--

00:45:32.430 --> 00:45:33.680
DANIELLE SEYBOLD: Or yourself?

00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:35.279
Was there anything there?

00:45:35.279 --> 00:45:36.070
AUDIENCE: Confused.

00:45:36.070 --> 00:45:36.480
DANIELLE SEYBOLD: Confused.

00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:38.420
How many people were confused?

00:45:38.420 --> 00:45:39.130
Yeah.

00:45:39.130 --> 00:45:39.710
Yeah.

00:45:39.710 --> 00:45:43.310
Super common experience,
very human, common humanity.

00:45:43.310 --> 00:45:45.339
Other sharing, what
did you guys notice?

00:45:45.339 --> 00:45:46.380
We have one in the front.

00:45:46.380 --> 00:45:47.754
Oh, she'll come
back to you next.

00:45:49.977 --> 00:45:51.060
I need to receive support.

00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:54.100
Jackie's going to do
the microphone thing.

00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:56.107
AUDIENCE: I just had
a rebellious reaction.

00:45:56.107 --> 00:45:58.440
For some reason, when somebody
tells me to do something,

00:45:58.440 --> 00:46:00.400
I'm just like--

00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:02.990
and I felt neutral.

00:46:02.990 --> 00:46:04.990
I almost said, I'm not
going to do either thing.

00:46:04.990 --> 00:46:05.781
I have no interest.

00:46:05.781 --> 00:46:09.370
It was just almost like that
was the rebellion was just

00:46:09.370 --> 00:46:11.740
shut down and not allow the
other person to have power.

00:46:11.740 --> 00:46:14.300
DANIELLE SEYBOLD: How many
people notice rebellion?

00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:17.970
That is my go-to in this
exercise, happens to me.

00:46:17.970 --> 00:46:19.315
Yeah, thanks.

00:46:19.315 --> 00:46:21.424
In the red hat, we had one.

00:46:21.424 --> 00:46:22.840
AUDIENCE: It felt
like somebody is

00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:25.310
trying to boss me and tell
me exactly what to do,

00:46:25.310 --> 00:46:30.160
what not to do, and [INAUDIBLE]
like my little 3-year-old

00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:33.320
sometimes when she gets mad, she
just, Papa put me in your lap.

00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:34.420
Papa, stand up.

00:46:34.420 --> 00:46:35.650
Papa, walk like this, Papa.

00:46:35.650 --> 00:46:38.297
Hold me with one hand
and walk like this.

00:46:38.297 --> 00:46:39.880
DANIELLE SEYBOLD:
Oh, so she tell you.

00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:40.300
AUDIENCE: She does.

00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:40.890
She does that.

00:46:40.890 --> 00:46:43.510
And we'll tell her, you
can't boss Daddy like that.

00:46:43.510 --> 00:46:45.460
You can tell Daddy,
hug me, kiss me.

00:46:45.460 --> 00:46:46.470
But you can't say, walk.

00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:47.980
Stand on one foot.

00:46:47.980 --> 00:46:50.180
Hold me in your lap and run.

00:46:50.180 --> 00:46:51.610
DANIELLE SEYBOLD: Thank you.

00:46:51.610 --> 00:46:52.782
AUDIENCE: Bossed around.

00:46:52.782 --> 00:46:54.490
DANIELLE SEYBOLD: We
have another-- yeah,

00:46:54.490 --> 00:46:55.198
they felt bossed.

00:46:55.198 --> 00:46:57.030
Another Person ditto for that.

00:46:59.610 --> 00:47:01.030
OK so we're gonna do this again.

00:47:04.610 --> 00:47:05.280
Stand up.

00:47:10.350 --> 00:47:11.446
Look at another person.

00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:16.100
Raise your hand.

00:47:18.610 --> 00:47:20.824
Open your mouth.

00:47:20.824 --> 00:47:21.490
Clap your hands.

00:47:24.580 --> 00:47:27.270
Sit down.

00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:29.234
Same thing with a partner.

00:47:29.234 --> 00:47:30.650
Go ahead and share
with a partner.

00:47:30.650 --> 00:47:32.104
And then we'll
share as the group.

00:47:32.104 --> 00:47:33.770
So what was your
experience of that one?

00:47:37.470 --> 00:47:40.070
AUDIENCE: So we
felt less confused

00:47:40.070 --> 00:47:42.650
because the second
set of instructions

00:47:42.650 --> 00:47:45.530
were more positive, meaning
the previous ones were all

00:47:45.530 --> 00:47:46.200
don't do this.

00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:46.580
Don't do that.

00:47:46.580 --> 00:47:47.246
Don't look here.

00:47:47.246 --> 00:47:49.160
Don't lift your hand.

00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:50.210
These are all, do this.

00:47:50.210 --> 00:47:50.720
Do that.

00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:51.380
Look at me.

00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:52.850
Look at this one, et cetera.

00:47:52.850 --> 00:47:56.370
So the tone was more
positive, I think

00:47:56.370 --> 00:47:57.911
So it felt less confusing.

00:47:57.911 --> 00:47:59.660
DANIELLE SEYBOLD:
Positive and more clear.

00:48:05.470 --> 00:48:09.420
AUDIENCE: Yes, since I
knew what was coming,

00:48:09.420 --> 00:48:11.610
I didn't feel like
following the instructions.

00:48:11.610 --> 00:48:12.900
DANIELLE SEYBOLD: Oh, because
you knew it was happening,

00:48:12.900 --> 00:48:13.940
you were like, I
don't want to do this.

00:48:13.940 --> 00:48:15.815
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I said,
it didn't make sense.

00:48:15.815 --> 00:48:17.230
So why should I follow?

00:48:17.230 --> 00:48:18.960
I don't know why
I thought, but--

00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:20.126
DANIELLE SEYBOLD: Thank you.

00:48:27.718 --> 00:48:31.630
I hope you're not
bored with it yes.

00:48:31.630 --> 00:48:32.680
I invite you to stand up.

00:48:37.908 --> 00:48:39.532
I invite you to look
at another person.

00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:46.050
I invite you to raise your hand.

00:48:46.050 --> 00:48:49.023
I invite you to open your mouth.

00:48:49.023 --> 00:48:50.397
I invite you to
close your mouth.

00:48:54.380 --> 00:48:56.594
What do we need to do next
to share with a partner?

00:48:56.594 --> 00:48:59.340
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:59.340 --> 00:49:02.041
DANIELLE SEYBOLD: I
invite you to sit down.

00:49:02.041 --> 00:49:03.790
And I invite you to
share with our partner

00:49:03.790 --> 00:49:05.040
briefly about that experience.

00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:07.876
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:49:08.780 --> 00:49:10.905
DANIELLE SEYBOLD: And we
can start sharing now too.

00:49:10.905 --> 00:49:12.340
So let's do first
that experience.

00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:13.631
And then we'll put it together.

00:49:21.339 --> 00:49:23.880
AUDIENCE: Seemed that this was
even more positive because now

00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:25.046
you're inviting us to do it.

00:49:25.046 --> 00:49:28.570
And we actually felt
this was more fun almost.

00:49:28.570 --> 00:49:30.570
DANIELLE SEYBOLD: So I'll
ask by raise of hands.

00:49:30.570 --> 00:49:34.300
How many people found the
first one to be both confusing

00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:36.540
and they didn't want to do it--

00:49:36.540 --> 00:49:39.160
when I told you what not to do?

00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:39.840
So confusing--

00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:41.640
JACLYN LONG: Almost everyone
is saying their hands.

00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:43.139
DANIELLE SEYBOLD:
Thank you, Jackie.

00:49:43.139 --> 00:49:46.320
Second one, how many people felt
a little more open to doing it?

00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:49.110
It was more clear, and they felt
a little more willing to listen

00:49:49.110 --> 00:49:50.420
to what I was asking.

00:49:50.420 --> 00:49:51.560
JACLYN LONG: Most of
the hands are raised.

00:49:51.560 --> 00:49:52.893
DANIELLE SEYBOLD: Most of hands.

00:49:52.893 --> 00:49:55.050
And for the third
one, if you thought

00:49:55.050 --> 00:49:57.810
it was even better
than the middle one

00:49:57.810 --> 00:49:59.400
when you had an invitation.

00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:00.900
Yeah.

00:50:00.900 --> 00:50:01.590
Most hands.

00:50:01.590 --> 00:50:04.270
How many of you felt a
little more willing to do it?

00:50:04.270 --> 00:50:06.930
Yeah, I wish I could Dr.
Spock myself and remove

00:50:06.930 --> 00:50:09.510
all my non-verbals and
be 100% consistent.

00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:11.220
I'm aware that I'm
not perfect at that.

00:50:11.220 --> 00:50:14.590
So that probably
clouded your experience.

00:50:14.590 --> 00:50:16.954
So just a little bit
of insight as parents,

00:50:16.954 --> 00:50:18.870
what are you taking away
from this experience?

00:50:22.300 --> 00:50:25.337
And just again, because
we have people listening

00:50:25.337 --> 00:50:27.420
who won't hear you, we'll
bring you the microphone

00:50:27.420 --> 00:50:28.957
if you're willing to share.

00:50:28.957 --> 00:50:29.790
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:50:29.790 --> 00:50:32.050
At some point if you really
want them to do something,

00:50:32.050 --> 00:50:35.280
at least talk it in a positive
and respectful way so that

00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:38.920
at least they feel you aren't
just trying to boss them or--

00:50:41.193 --> 00:50:42.234
DANIELLE SEYBOLD: Thanks.

00:50:42.234 --> 00:50:43.192
JACLYN LONG: Thank you.

00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:49.400
AUDIENCE: So I think
it's important to make

00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:52.310
your expectations
clear about what

00:50:52.310 --> 00:50:53.750
it is that you want them to do.

00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:04.240
AUDIENCE: I felt like
the final way felt,

00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:07.810
it was more like you're
on the same level--

00:51:07.810 --> 00:51:09.850
like as a friend
would invite you

00:51:09.850 --> 00:51:12.130
as opposed to being on a
different level where you're

00:51:12.130 --> 00:51:13.870
commanding somebody.

00:51:13.870 --> 00:51:17.060
So I don't know.

00:51:17.060 --> 00:51:26.110
It made me feel more like
we're part of the same team

00:51:26.110 --> 00:51:27.000
or whatever.

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.946
And I'm trying to relate it to
a family member, like you're--

00:51:29.946 --> 00:51:30.904
DANIELLE SEYBOLD: Yeah.

00:51:30.904 --> 00:51:31.820
Thank you.

00:51:34.557 --> 00:51:36.140
AUDIENCE: I thought
it was interesting

00:51:36.140 --> 00:51:38.967
because the command was direct.

00:51:38.967 --> 00:51:40.800
And it was saying, you
don't have an option.

00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:43.186
And then you can say,
here's just a directive.

00:51:43.186 --> 00:51:45.560
And then the third one actually
takes more emotional risk

00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:48.140
because you're giving
the child agency.

00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:50.504
And you're inviting
them to say, yes or no.

00:51:50.504 --> 00:51:52.670
I thought it was interesting
that the reactions were

00:51:52.670 --> 00:51:54.680
opposite to your intention is--

00:51:54.680 --> 00:51:55.700
you have to do this.

00:51:55.700 --> 00:51:56.729
And my reaction is no.

00:51:56.729 --> 00:51:58.520
And you're saying, I
invite you to do this.

00:51:58.520 --> 00:52:00.950
I could say no, but
my reaction was yes.

00:52:00.950 --> 00:52:04.070
DANIELLE SEYBOLD: Did you notice
in that third less rebellion?

00:52:04.070 --> 00:52:05.240
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:07.160
Yes, absolutely,
which was interesting

00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:09.380
because I could have
battled if I wanted to.

00:52:09.380 --> 00:52:09.860
DANIELLE SEYBOLD: Absolutely

00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:11.840
AUDIENCE: But I didn't have that
agency, well, realistically.

00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:12.350
DANIELLE SEYBOLD:
We're just sitting.

00:52:12.350 --> 00:52:12.980
That's totally fine.

00:52:12.980 --> 00:52:14.229
You can just sit in the chair.

00:52:14.229 --> 00:52:16.250
AUDIENCE: Yeah, exactly.

00:52:16.250 --> 00:52:18.180
JACLYN LONG: So a little
transparency here.

00:52:18.180 --> 00:52:20.388
DANIELLE SEYBOLD: Thank you,
I was about to say that.

00:52:20.388 --> 00:52:22.010
JACLYN LONG: We
actually just were

00:52:22.010 --> 00:52:24.219
inspired to do a little
design thinking live.

00:52:24.219 --> 00:52:26.260
DANIELLE SEYBOLD: We just
made that last part up.

00:52:26.260 --> 00:52:27.020
JACLYN LONG: We
just threw that in,

00:52:27.020 --> 00:52:28.490
in part because of
your experience.

00:52:28.490 --> 00:52:30.115
When I heard that
rebelliousness, which

00:52:30.115 --> 00:52:32.840
I relate to, we
wanted to throw in,

00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:35.840
what would happen
if we invited them.

00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:41.830
So I also was thinking
about doing this because--

00:52:41.830 --> 00:52:45.470
it came to me just now because
in the therapist room when

00:52:45.470 --> 00:52:49.310
I work with couples, I sometimes
get a wave of something that

00:52:49.310 --> 00:52:51.080
could be helpful for
one of the partners

00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:52.860
to say or do with
the other partner.

00:52:52.860 --> 00:52:57.790
And if I say, please turn to
your partner and say this,

00:52:57.790 --> 00:52:59.810
they'll usually be
a little non-verbal

00:52:59.810 --> 00:53:01.650
like, I don't want to.

00:53:01.650 --> 00:53:04.130
But if I say, would you be
willing to turn to your partner

00:53:04.130 --> 00:53:05.360
and say this?

00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:07.880
Almost always, they're,
yes, I would be willing.

00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:11.090
So when we take a moment to
invite or ask for willingness,

00:53:11.090 --> 00:53:15.670
it really can help that
rebellious piece soften.

00:53:15.670 --> 00:53:18.650
And this actually comes from
nonviolent communication.

00:53:18.650 --> 00:53:22.190
So I invite you to look more
into that if you're interested.

00:53:22.190 --> 00:53:23.690
DANIELLE SEYBOLD:
Thank you, Jackie.

00:53:23.690 --> 00:53:24.960
You even had that with you.

00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:25.668
JACLYN LONG: Yes.

00:53:29.990 --> 00:53:32.400
DANIELLE SEYBOLD: Thank
you for playing along.

00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:35.180
To step into some
role play, I realize

00:53:35.180 --> 00:53:40.130
asking people to step a little
outside normal comfort zone.

00:53:40.130 --> 00:53:41.971
And if you're in
a separate room,

00:53:41.971 --> 00:53:43.220
I encourage you, please do it.

00:53:43.220 --> 00:53:46.520
If you didn't do the last
one, do this next one.

00:53:46.520 --> 00:53:50.990
We're giving you things on a
very shallow side of the pool

00:53:50.990 --> 00:53:53.780
of parenting experientials.

00:53:53.780 --> 00:53:55.430
What I'll describe
a little later where

00:53:55.430 --> 00:53:57.020
you start to like
take on role playing

00:53:57.020 --> 00:54:00.020
situations in your own
life, that's the deep end.

00:54:03.170 --> 00:54:05.550
I appreciate that
these experiences are,

00:54:05.550 --> 00:54:07.310
they're very light
and very brief.

00:54:07.310 --> 00:54:09.620
They evoke very real responses,
especially when you're

00:54:09.620 --> 00:54:11.330
paying mindful attention.

00:54:11.330 --> 00:54:14.120
You can be aware of a
really quick response

00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:17.660
in the body, or the thoughts,
or reaction tendency.

00:54:17.660 --> 00:54:21.200
So you're going to find
a partner and the person

00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:26.280
with the birthday that comes up
next is going to make a fist.

00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:28.160
And so find your partner.

00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:31.904
The person who has the
next birthday makes a fist.

00:54:31.904 --> 00:54:33.320
When I see people
with fists, I'll

00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:35.611
know that we're ready to go
with the next instructions.

00:54:35.611 --> 00:54:38.180
So people with the fists--

00:54:38.180 --> 00:54:40.970
your job, at least at the
beginning of this exercise,

00:54:40.970 --> 00:54:42.920
is to be a little resistant.

00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:44.990
And no matter what,
you are not going

00:54:44.990 --> 00:54:48.680
to open your fist in the first
10 seconds of this thing.

00:54:48.680 --> 00:54:51.890
And then after a while, you
can decide what you want to do.

00:54:51.890 --> 00:54:55.190
Other partner, your job,
without touching them,

00:54:55.190 --> 00:54:58.730
is to get them to
open their fist.

00:54:58.730 --> 00:55:00.117
And you're both being mindful.

00:55:00.117 --> 00:55:01.700
What am I thinking,
feeling, deciding?

00:55:01.700 --> 00:55:04.910
What do I really
want to do here?

00:55:04.910 --> 00:55:06.700
Any questions?

00:55:06.700 --> 00:55:08.640
Go.

00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:09.510
Get those open.

00:55:09.510 --> 00:55:13.140
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:55:13.140 --> 00:55:15.420
DANIELLE SEYBOLD: Do
not open your fist yet,

00:55:15.420 --> 00:55:18.040
not yet, no matter what.

00:55:18.040 --> 00:55:19.030
Get those fists open.

00:55:19.030 --> 00:55:22.467
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:55:30.881 --> 00:55:32.880
JACLYN LONG: You're
entering that choice period.

00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:36.667
If you feel inclined to
open your fist, you can.

00:55:36.667 --> 00:55:37.500
Still getting fists.

00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:38.916
Oh, I see a hand shake up here.

00:55:38.916 --> 00:55:40.040
I wonder what that's about.

00:55:40.040 --> 00:55:42.922
I'm very curious.

00:55:42.922 --> 00:55:45.510
I notice the volume is
getting a little louder.

00:55:45.510 --> 00:55:48.504
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:56.580
JACLYN LONG: And
thank your partner.

00:55:56.580 --> 00:55:59.520
And you are no longer
doing this exercise.

00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:01.980
You're now just talking to
your partner about how that was

00:56:01.980 --> 00:56:05.566
and what you noticed
for yourself.

00:56:05.566 --> 00:56:07.440
AUDIENCE: So I could
relate to the experience

00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:10.350
we had because we started
by trying to reason.

00:56:10.350 --> 00:56:12.300
And there was some
attempts at logic.

00:56:12.300 --> 00:56:15.970
And then it quickly went all the
way down to bribery at the end.

00:56:15.970 --> 00:56:18.735
And that's the thing that
worked in this situation.

00:56:18.735 --> 00:56:19.920
I don't know long-term.

00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:21.295
DANIELLE SEYBOLD:
How many people

00:56:21.295 --> 00:56:22.860
have used that
tactic as a parent--

00:56:22.860 --> 00:56:23.840
reasoning turned to bribery?

00:56:23.840 --> 00:56:24.340
Cool.

00:56:27.267 --> 00:56:28.850
AUDIENCE: I had an
interesting thought

00:56:28.850 --> 00:56:33.110
that you just taught us inviting
and asking for willingness.

00:56:33.110 --> 00:56:35.600
And I could've used it.

00:56:35.600 --> 00:56:38.030
But I said, no, I'll save
whatever I learned for later.

00:56:38.030 --> 00:56:39.830
Why should I save it for later?

00:56:39.830 --> 00:56:42.320
I could've use that right here.

00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:45.740
It's all because you
accumulate wealth or knowledge.

00:56:45.740 --> 00:56:47.300
You save everything for later.

00:56:47.300 --> 00:56:48.170
Let me use it later.

00:56:48.170 --> 00:56:51.090
Let me save this PDF
and read it later.

00:56:51.090 --> 00:56:52.880
You accumulate and
use it for later.

00:56:52.880 --> 00:56:54.050
Can't you use it right away?

00:56:54.050 --> 00:56:55.310
I mean, you have situations.

00:56:55.310 --> 00:56:57.560
But you don't realize that
you can use it right away.

00:56:57.560 --> 00:56:59.850
That's probably because
you're not mindful enough.

00:56:59.850 --> 00:57:01.310
That could be something.

00:57:01.310 --> 00:57:03.027
DANIELLE SEYBOLD:
Did he open his hand?

00:57:03.027 --> 00:57:03.860
AUDIENCE: Oh he did.

00:57:08.641 --> 00:57:10.790
I just said, could you drop it?

00:57:10.790 --> 00:57:11.870
So that's what--

00:57:11.870 --> 00:57:15.740
I could have used a better
tone and tenor to get it done.

00:57:15.740 --> 00:57:18.450
But I didn't do it as well.

00:57:18.450 --> 00:57:21.240
I guess that's something that I
have to use late in the evening

00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:23.570
and as I go home,
or in the upcoming

00:57:23.570 --> 00:57:26.330
meetings as well, that
we have in the afternoon.

00:57:26.330 --> 00:57:30.420
Use that phrase right away
instead of saving it for later.

00:57:30.420 --> 00:57:33.020
So that's something
that I realized just now

00:57:33.020 --> 00:57:34.180
through this exercise.

00:57:34.180 --> 00:57:35.490
DANIELLE SEYBOLD: Thank you.

00:57:35.490 --> 00:57:36.198
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:57:38.277 --> 00:57:39.860
AUDIENCE: I thought
it was interesting

00:57:39.860 --> 00:57:43.580
because as I was being
asked to unfold my hand,

00:57:43.580 --> 00:57:45.230
and it was more
and more of like,

00:57:45.230 --> 00:57:46.689
can you just try this tactic?

00:57:46.689 --> 00:57:48.980
I realized, I must have
something pretty valuable here,

00:57:48.980 --> 00:57:50.104
and its control.

00:57:50.104 --> 00:57:51.770
I just though it was
really interesting.

00:57:51.770 --> 00:57:52.790
I felt like I had power.

00:57:52.790 --> 00:57:55.324
And I was like, I'm not
letting this go in this moment.

00:57:55.324 --> 00:57:57.740
I mean, the kids don't have a
lot of power, realistically.

00:57:57.740 --> 00:58:00.260
And even little things,
you hold onto that.

00:58:00.260 --> 00:58:03.950
and I can remember
being like that myself.

00:58:03.950 --> 00:58:05.340
DANIELLE SEYBOLD: Thank you.

00:58:05.340 --> 00:58:07.790
So you can see just from
these two very quick role

00:58:07.790 --> 00:58:12.920
plays how much you can step
into the world of your children

00:58:12.920 --> 00:58:14.660
and how much you can
step into the world

00:58:14.660 --> 00:58:19.155
of a parent with a mindful
lens and gather some data

00:58:19.155 --> 00:58:19.655
and insight.

00:58:22.540 --> 00:58:23.150
Oh, thank you.

00:58:23.150 --> 00:58:25.025
Jackie already-- can we
switch to the slides?

00:58:25.025 --> 00:58:26.590
How do we do that?

00:58:26.590 --> 00:58:28.800
I think she's figured that out.

00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:33.395
So when we do role
play work as parents--

00:58:33.395 --> 00:58:35.494
so this is the OK,
so it's not all lost.

00:58:35.494 --> 00:58:36.410
There's not a formula.

00:58:36.410 --> 00:58:38.070
There's not one
right thing to do.

00:58:38.070 --> 00:58:41.470
But there's a
process of choosing--

00:58:41.470 --> 00:58:42.390
let's choose.

00:58:42.390 --> 00:58:44.900
In my therapy training,
cognitive behavioral work,

00:58:44.900 --> 00:58:49.840
it's called the one grain
of sand in the hourglass.

00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:52.190
And we pick one
instance in time.

00:58:52.190 --> 00:58:55.105
And I'm going to treat it like
a story, like a narrative.

00:58:55.105 --> 00:58:56.480
If a surgeon came
to me, and they

00:58:56.480 --> 00:58:58.850
want to design a new
medical product--

00:58:58.850 --> 00:59:00.440
walk me through
what's the procedure.

00:59:00.440 --> 00:59:01.940
Walk me through the
procedural step.

00:59:01.940 --> 00:59:04.490
Walk me through the
preparation, the use of it,

00:59:04.490 --> 00:59:06.680
and so you see what
the needs are clearly.

00:59:06.680 --> 00:59:08.720
And then as a parent,
if you're in a group

00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:10.790
with people who you
can role play with,

00:59:10.790 --> 00:59:12.110
I highly recommend it.

00:59:12.110 --> 00:59:14.450
If you're not,
you can go through

00:59:14.450 --> 00:59:16.700
and take an empathetic lens.

00:59:16.700 --> 00:59:19.310
What do I think my
child might be feeling?

00:59:19.310 --> 00:59:21.310
If I were in a
similar situation,

00:59:21.310 --> 00:59:23.690
what are the thoughts and
feelings I might have?

00:59:23.690 --> 00:59:27.030
And you can definitely
do it for yourself.

00:59:27.030 --> 00:59:29.540
And again, mindfulness is
your data collection tool.

00:59:29.540 --> 00:59:33.320
So what kinds of solutions
might be most helpful?

00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:36.110
How did that solution work out?

00:59:36.110 --> 00:59:37.760
In my engineering
world, I'm going

00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:39.060
to create my first prototype.

00:59:39.060 --> 00:59:40.040
I'm gonna do it very quickly.

00:59:40.040 --> 00:59:41.540
I'm not going to
overly think it.

00:59:41.540 --> 00:59:43.498
As soon as possible, I'm
going to get something

00:59:43.498 --> 00:59:44.600
into a physician's hands.

00:59:44.600 --> 00:59:45.433
And they can try it.

00:59:45.433 --> 00:59:46.940
And they can give me feedback.

00:59:46.940 --> 00:59:50.020
In a perfect world, I can
go, and I can watch it.

00:59:50.020 --> 00:59:52.580
And so I can even learn all
the things they didn't say.

00:59:52.580 --> 00:59:54.560
So it's important to
prototype and test.

00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:57.200
So you go home, and you're
testing it on your kids.

00:59:57.200 --> 00:59:58.820
And treat it like an experiment.

00:59:58.820 --> 01:00:00.980
You don't know exactly how
it's going to turn out.

01:00:00.980 --> 01:00:03.600
But you're going to stay awake.

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:08.780
Interpersonal mindfulness
with your children--

01:00:08.780 --> 01:00:13.970
holding both yourself and
them and their experience

01:00:13.970 --> 01:00:16.490
at the same time.

01:00:16.490 --> 01:00:19.384
And then when you're
with a group of parents,

01:00:19.384 --> 01:00:21.050
you get a chance to
role play before you

01:00:21.050 --> 01:00:21.966
go out and do it live.

01:00:21.966 --> 01:00:25.294
I call it bench testing before
you go do in vivo testing.

01:00:25.294 --> 01:00:27.210
I don't want to set a
prototype to a physician

01:00:27.210 --> 01:00:28.430
if I haven't even tried it.

01:00:28.430 --> 01:00:32.210
I try to mock up the
physiology the best I can,

01:00:32.210 --> 01:00:33.570
see how it works.

01:00:33.570 --> 01:00:35.360
It's what we do in
our parenting groups.

01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:37.910
You can decide to play
yourself or your child.

01:00:37.910 --> 01:00:40.880
And you can even assign
people to the other folks

01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:41.810
who are in the room--

01:00:41.810 --> 01:00:43.970
other children, a partner.

01:00:43.970 --> 01:00:47.420
And you go in and just the
same questions I asked you--

01:00:47.420 --> 01:00:48.920
what are you thinking?

01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:50.340
What are you feeling?

01:00:50.340 --> 01:00:51.620
What are you deciding?

01:00:51.620 --> 01:00:52.220
You go around.

01:00:52.220 --> 01:00:53.240
You get insight.

01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:55.080
You gather data
from each person.

01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:57.200
Then you go, OK.

01:00:57.200 --> 01:00:59.660
Let me jump into tools and
jump into brainstorming.

01:00:59.660 --> 01:01:01.280
And I put the
participant in what's

01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:04.280
called the "cone of
silence" because there's

01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:06.917
a way we have of supporting
parents and talking

01:01:06.917 --> 01:01:07.500
to each other.

01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:08.650
We want to figure it out.

01:01:08.650 --> 01:01:09.440
Well, have you tried this?

01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:10.773
What's going on with your child?

01:01:10.773 --> 01:01:13.900
So we'll literally
suggest the person turn

01:01:13.900 --> 01:01:15.730
and look where
I'm writing notes.

01:01:15.730 --> 01:01:18.260
And people are talking to
another person and just

01:01:18.260 --> 01:01:19.940
recording ideas to brainstorm.

01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:22.160
Every idea is valuable.

01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:23.439
Make a huge list.

01:01:23.439 --> 01:01:24.980
And we make sure
that we put a couple

01:01:24.980 --> 01:01:27.050
of the Positive
Discipline practices

01:01:27.050 --> 01:01:29.510
we just learned on there.

01:01:29.510 --> 01:01:32.660
And then the person gets to
choose one they'd like to try.

01:01:32.660 --> 01:01:35.300
They can play it again,
this time as themself,

01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:37.190
see how it went, and
then you take it out

01:01:37.190 --> 01:01:38.370
into the real world.

01:01:38.370 --> 01:01:41.300
And then the beautiful
thing is they'll report back

01:01:41.300 --> 01:01:42.317
on, how did that go?

01:01:42.317 --> 01:01:44.150
And everybody's curious
until the next week,

01:01:44.150 --> 01:01:45.350
like, I don't know.

01:01:45.350 --> 01:01:47.600
What was the response?

01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:49.970
And mindfulness--
we're not assuming it's

01:01:49.970 --> 01:01:51.140
going to be positive.

01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:52.850
We're going to notice what is.

01:01:52.850 --> 01:01:55.970
We're just going to
collect the data as it is.

01:01:55.970 --> 01:01:59.110
Anything else about--
let's go to the next slide.

01:01:59.110 --> 01:02:03.710
So you can see, I
mentioned there's a map.

01:02:03.710 --> 01:02:05.110
The mistaken goals chart?

01:02:05.110 --> 01:02:05.880
Cool.

01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:13.020
There's a map of ways to think
about your child's hidden needs

01:02:13.020 --> 01:02:15.800
and mistaken goals and what
tools might be helpful.

01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:19.462
And it starts with imagining
that one grain of sand

01:02:19.462 --> 01:02:20.170
in an hour glass.

01:02:20.170 --> 01:02:21.336
Let's think about one thing.

01:02:21.336 --> 01:02:23.670
Let me play it in my
mind like a movie.

01:02:23.670 --> 01:02:27.330
Or go out, and I'm
experiencing, what am I feeling?

01:02:27.330 --> 01:02:28.510
What's my feeling right now?

01:02:28.510 --> 01:02:29.880
So take a look at this chart.

01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:32.142
Start with the
Parent Feels column.

01:02:32.142 --> 01:02:33.600
It doesn't have to
be the perfect--

01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:38.310
just be any difficult
situation with your child.

01:02:38.310 --> 01:02:40.590
Maybe this morning, maybe
last night at bedtime--

01:02:40.590 --> 01:02:44.550
think if you could see which
row of feelings, which category?

01:02:44.550 --> 01:02:50.310
Did you feel more annoyed,
irritated, worried, or guilty?

01:02:50.310 --> 01:02:53.310
Did you feel angry, challenged?

01:02:53.310 --> 01:02:56.380
Did you feel hurt
or disappointed?

01:02:56.380 --> 01:02:59.290
Did you feel
despair or hopeless?

01:02:59.290 --> 01:03:01.552
For yourself, read
across that one row.

01:03:01.552 --> 01:03:03.010
We don't have time
to go into this.

01:03:03.010 --> 01:03:10.070
But read across that row and
take in that possibility.

01:03:10.070 --> 01:03:12.490
There's never any assumption
that this is right.

01:03:12.490 --> 01:03:16.260
Again, we'll apply that lens
and see what comes out of it.

01:03:19.660 --> 01:03:24.347
So I actually brought
with me this dove thing

01:03:24.347 --> 01:03:26.305
I did with first graders
a couple of weeks ago.

01:03:26.305 --> 01:03:31.000
It shows this idea
that mindfulness--

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.820
first, my definition that I
like is the Jon Kabat-Zinn

01:03:33.820 --> 01:03:34.540
definition.

01:03:34.540 --> 01:03:37.780
He founded the mindfulness-based
stress reduction.

01:03:37.780 --> 01:03:40.150
Mindfulness is just
paying attention

01:03:40.150 --> 01:03:46.102
to the present moment on
purpose nonjudgmentally.

01:03:46.102 --> 01:03:47.560
When I talk to
kids, nonjudgemental

01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:48.310
is a conceptual--

01:03:48.310 --> 01:03:50.040
I tell them being OK.

01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:52.345
You have an open mind and
a kind heart about it.

01:03:52.345 --> 01:03:54.220
And so there are these
two aspects we already

01:03:54.220 --> 01:03:55.750
talked about in the definition.

01:03:55.750 --> 01:03:57.040
But I like the visual imagery.

01:03:57.040 --> 01:03:58.230
And kids like to draw too.

01:03:58.230 --> 01:04:00.480
So think about two
wings of a bird.

01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:02.710
It won't fly unless it has both.

01:04:02.710 --> 01:04:05.610
On one side, you're
increasing awareness

01:04:05.610 --> 01:04:09.520
under a little magnifying
glass and a little leaf.

01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:11.320
And on the other side,
there's this feeling

01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:15.910
of heartfulness and this
nonjudgmental attitude

01:04:15.910 --> 01:04:19.160
towards what you're seeing.

01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:23.961
And I wish I could make this
visual happen right now.

01:04:23.961 --> 01:04:25.460
If you can imagine
this little heart

01:04:25.460 --> 01:04:30.110
I drew getting huge
right in front of me

01:04:30.110 --> 01:04:34.160
and put in that self-compassion
for yourself as a parent.

01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:36.140
So you're noticing the
experience of a parent

01:04:36.140 --> 01:04:37.460
can be tough.

01:04:37.460 --> 01:04:40.460
I will warn you, as you
become more mindful,

01:04:40.460 --> 01:04:43.010
you're more mindful of those
joyous moments that aren't

01:04:43.010 --> 01:04:44.780
the over-scheduled structure.

01:04:44.780 --> 01:04:48.050
But you increase your
awareness of the gaps

01:04:48.050 --> 01:04:50.420
and the unpleasant feelings too.

01:04:50.420 --> 01:04:52.890
And then, how do you hold that?

01:04:52.890 --> 01:04:56.040
What do you do with that?

01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:59.820
Kristin Neff-- I love her
model of self-compassion.

01:04:59.820 --> 01:05:01.940
One, experience what
it is and allow it.

01:05:01.940 --> 01:05:04.140
I'm gonna allow this experience.

01:05:04.140 --> 01:05:07.110
Recognize this common humanity.

01:05:07.110 --> 01:05:08.970
You know, another
reasonable person

01:05:08.970 --> 01:05:11.190
in this experience
as a parent, they

01:05:11.190 --> 01:05:12.540
might feel the same way too.

01:05:12.540 --> 01:05:14.940
I am not the first
person to feel this way.

01:05:14.940 --> 01:05:17.670
I hope you got an experience
of that in the room just--

01:05:17.670 --> 01:05:20.749
when people start laughing,
I think it's happening.

01:05:20.749 --> 01:05:22.290
And you have compassion
for yourself,

01:05:22.290 --> 01:05:23.540
and you treat yourself kindly.

01:05:26.750 --> 01:05:31.480
So shall we skip meditation
in favor of some Q&amp;A?

01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:32.230
JACLYN LONG: Sure.

01:05:32.230 --> 01:05:34.146
And I think that's
a nice place for me

01:05:34.146 --> 01:05:35.271
to just read a little poem.

01:05:35.271 --> 01:05:38.550
I really enjoy offering
poetry when I teach.

01:05:38.550 --> 01:05:41.600
So this feels like it
would come nicely off

01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:45.150
of Danielle's information
around mindfulness

01:05:45.150 --> 01:05:46.100
and self-compassion.

01:05:46.100 --> 01:05:48.980
And it's called "The Window."

01:05:48.980 --> 01:05:52.190
I was getting ready to go
to work to give a lecture.

01:05:52.190 --> 01:05:55.040
I was putting my notes in my
briefcase when the ball came

01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:56.330
through the window.

01:05:56.330 --> 01:05:58.850
And the glass went flying--

01:05:58.850 --> 01:06:02.150
a million tiny pieces
all over the living room.

01:06:02.150 --> 01:06:05.660
In that moment, I felt
my anger grow inside--

01:06:05.660 --> 01:06:07.370
my frustration at
the house never

01:06:07.370 --> 01:06:10.520
being organized enough; the
expense of the window getting

01:06:10.520 --> 01:06:12.800
repaired; and living, for
a while, with cardboard

01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:15.620
or plywood to replace the
glass; the thought of,

01:06:15.620 --> 01:06:18.830
how will we ever clean
up all the glass?

01:06:18.830 --> 01:06:21.200
And I became angrier
still as I now

01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:25.580
knew I would be late
for my presentation.

01:06:25.580 --> 01:06:30.790
I heard your small four-year-old
feet running up the steps.

01:06:30.790 --> 01:06:33.730
I saw your tiny arm
push open the door.

01:06:33.730 --> 01:06:36.490
Your eyes locked on mine--

01:06:36.490 --> 01:06:40.270
moist, searching.

01:06:40.270 --> 01:06:44.350
In that moment, history changed.

01:06:44.350 --> 01:06:46.210
I took you in my arms.

01:06:46.210 --> 01:06:47.680
Are you hurt?

01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:48.850
It's only a window.

01:06:48.850 --> 01:06:50.500
That can be replaced.

01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:53.560
That you are not hurt is
what's important to me.

01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:55.000
It's only glass.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:56.860
And you are my son.

01:06:56.860 --> 01:06:57.935
I love you.

01:06:57.935 --> 01:06:58.810
Let's get the broom--

01:07:01.690 --> 01:07:02.650
Bruce Linton.

01:07:07.930 --> 01:07:12.270
What I like about that is,
I'll just say real quickly,

01:07:12.270 --> 01:07:15.100
this recognition in the middle.

01:07:15.100 --> 01:07:17.980
He's aware of his anger.

01:07:17.980 --> 01:07:21.490
He's feeling my
frustration growing inside.

01:07:21.490 --> 01:07:24.370
So there's this idea that
this person, this dad,

01:07:24.370 --> 01:07:26.060
is aware of himself.

01:07:26.060 --> 01:07:28.570
He's noticing the anger growing.

01:07:28.570 --> 01:07:31.530
That capacity for witnessing
ourselves in the moment helps--

01:07:31.530 --> 01:07:33.580
helps with this
question of, what

01:07:33.580 --> 01:07:35.440
do you do if you're
about to flip your lid

01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:37.330
and you don't have five minutes?

01:07:37.330 --> 01:07:40.990
These moments of just noticing,
ah, naming frustration.

01:07:40.990 --> 01:07:43.390
Frustration can help.

01:07:43.390 --> 01:07:45.520
And then also not only
noticing what's in me,

01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:47.590
but noticing the size
of our little ones,

01:07:47.590 --> 01:07:51.310
noticing how little they
are, noticing their eyes,

01:07:51.310 --> 01:07:54.430
noticing how their body
responds to our bodies.

01:07:54.430 --> 01:07:55.840
That's helpful.

01:07:55.840 --> 01:07:59.440
And I also love this
experience of "in this moment,

01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:00.860
history changed."

01:08:00.860 --> 01:08:03.580
This is a moment of
updating our software,

01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:06.680
updating our internal software
by doing something different.

01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:07.780
OK, thanks.

01:08:07.780 --> 01:08:09.190
We'll take your questions.

01:08:09.190 --> 01:08:11.020
DANIELLE SEYBOLD:
There are a couple here

01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:14.800
that were voiced from
people watching remotely.

01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:17.050
The first one, how
do we educate a child

01:08:17.050 --> 01:08:19.029
that there are
sometimes failures

01:08:19.029 --> 01:08:20.648
and we should just
learn from it?

01:08:20.648 --> 01:08:22.689
They gave an example of
having a six-year-old who

01:08:22.689 --> 01:08:26.585
almost always cries if they
don't win on a card game.

01:08:26.585 --> 01:08:28.960
And this parent's OK allowing
the child to win every time

01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:32.740
but worries if they're
teaching he can always win.

01:08:32.740 --> 01:08:37.000
And so allowing the
experience, do not

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:41.350
make the feeling go away,
supporting through it,

01:08:41.350 --> 01:08:44.590
giving the language of mistakes
are opportunities to learn.

01:08:44.590 --> 01:08:46.887
And it's so powerful when
you bring in modeling.

01:08:46.887 --> 01:08:48.970
I know some people who go
around the dinner table.

01:08:48.970 --> 01:08:51.460
They'll go and share what
mistakes they made for the day.

01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:53.626
So you can model your
reaction to your own mistakes.

01:08:56.290 --> 01:08:58.180
How do you motivate
a young child

01:08:58.180 --> 01:09:03.250
to complete tasks like eating
and getting ready for school?

01:09:03.250 --> 01:09:04.399
Lots of ways to do it.

01:09:04.399 --> 01:09:06.220
I'll mention a
Positive Discipline

01:09:06.220 --> 01:09:10.729
tool would be to come up
with a routine together.

01:09:10.729 --> 01:09:13.319
And so, you can just,
what's next in your routine?

01:09:13.319 --> 01:09:16.540
And so you can point back to
the routine running the morning.

01:09:16.540 --> 01:09:19.240
So you're not this bossypants
telling the kid what to do.

01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:20.560
We have a sense of control.

01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:22.965
And as much as they can,
they come up with a routine.

01:09:22.965 --> 01:09:25.090
What do you need to do to
get ready in the morning?

01:09:25.090 --> 01:09:26.800
You don't top-down it.

01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:30.010
You support them
side-to-side in coming up

01:09:30.010 --> 01:09:32.380
with their own schedule.

01:09:32.380 --> 01:09:33.514
And

01:09:33.514 --> 01:09:34.930
At what age do you
suggest parents

01:09:34.930 --> 01:09:37.396
begin to try mindfulness
activities with children?

01:09:37.396 --> 01:09:38.979
What could you do
with a two-year-old,

01:09:38.979 --> 01:09:40.300
a five-year-old, a 10-year-old?

01:09:40.300 --> 01:09:41.800
I feel like that
gives me permission

01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:43.410
to do the mindfulness
practice we

01:09:43.410 --> 01:09:45.899
were going to do because
it's something I have--

01:09:45.899 --> 01:09:47.561
oh, this is David's.

01:09:47.561 --> 01:09:51.640
That's why Jackie's looking at
me with a strange expression.

01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:53.028
So these balls are wonderful.

01:09:53.028 --> 01:09:54.069
I forget what they call--

01:09:54.069 --> 01:09:54.569
Hoberman.

01:09:54.569 --> 01:09:57.220
Does that sound right?

01:09:57.220 --> 01:09:59.145
So this borders on relaxation.

01:09:59.145 --> 01:10:00.520
You're not just
noticing what is.

01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:02.010
You're making something happen.

01:10:02.010 --> 01:10:05.140
And this is going to
take charge of breathing.

01:10:05.140 --> 01:10:07.240
There's some
rationale behind this.

01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:10.480
As you start to
exhale more, you tend

01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:15.350
to have more
parasympathetic relaxation.

01:10:15.350 --> 01:10:17.170
And a kid doesn't have
to be able to count.

01:10:17.170 --> 01:10:21.230
They're going to inhale
as I open this and exhale

01:10:21.230 --> 01:10:24.085
as I close it.

01:10:24.085 --> 01:10:25.960
For those of you who
you want to count along,

01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:31.020
inhaling to one, two, three,
four; exhaling to one,

01:10:31.020 --> 01:10:35.140
two, three, four, five, six.

01:10:35.140 --> 01:10:38.080
And you can keep
looking up here.

01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:40.240
Jackie, can you time
us for one minute?

01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:41.860
Let me know when
a minute's over.

01:10:41.860 --> 01:10:46.160
My timer's over
here on this chair.

01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:51.714
Four, exhaling, one, two,
three, four, five, six.

01:10:51.714 --> 01:10:54.005
JACLYN LONG: Just do it more
time, just a whole minute.

01:10:54.005 --> 01:10:55.267
Is that OK with you?

01:10:55.267 --> 01:10:56.850
DANIELLE SEYBOLD:
Can I do three more?

01:10:56.850 --> 01:10:57.330
JACLYN LONG: Sure.

01:10:57.330 --> 01:10:58.205
DANIELLE SEYBOLD: OK.

01:11:01.390 --> 01:11:04.960
Just notice your own
body and if there's

01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:07.669
any effect of just doing a
very short little practice.

01:11:16.891 --> 01:11:18.890
And I mentioned there's
a new book that came out

01:11:18.890 --> 01:11:21.080
called "Mindful Games."

01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:22.880
It's got like 60
examples of games

01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:24.740
you can do with
very young children.

01:11:24.740 --> 01:11:26.510
You could check that
out for some ideas

01:11:26.510 --> 01:11:28.700
of how to share this
with a young audience.

01:11:28.700 --> 01:11:30.692
JACLYN LONG: And the
question was to what age?

01:11:30.692 --> 01:11:31.400
What's the best--

01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:33.358
DANIELLE SEYBOLD: So I
have done that literally

01:11:33.358 --> 01:11:35.340
with first graders,
and they loved it.

01:11:35.340 --> 01:11:37.400
It was much easier
than other techniques.

01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:39.200
I would do it with
my four-year-old too

01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:41.870
and to set the expectation
of what their practice will

01:11:41.870 --> 01:11:45.890
look like and give them the
permission to have whatever

01:11:45.890 --> 01:11:47.320
experience they have of that.

01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:48.912
JACLYN LONG: Right.

01:11:48.912 --> 01:11:50.120
DANIELLE SEYBOLD: It is 1:30.

01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:52.370
I tend to be very time-oriented.

01:11:52.370 --> 01:11:56.200
I'm OK if we extend to do
some more Q&amp;A for like 5

01:11:56.200 --> 01:11:57.640
to 10 minutes be OK, or?

01:11:57.640 --> 01:11:59.690
AUDIENCE: I just want to
take one minute before--

01:11:59.690 --> 01:12:01.370
JACLYN LONG: And also, those
of you who are in the room,

01:12:01.370 --> 01:12:02.869
if you want to write
down your email

01:12:02.869 --> 01:12:04.560
addresses if you
want to stay in touch

01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:07.880
so you can be informed of
other offerings that we have,

01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:10.670
Danielle is going to be offering
a couple's communication

01:12:10.670 --> 01:12:12.480
workshop in August.

01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:14.360
One day is on couples
communication.

01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:17.120
And the next day is on
Positive Discipline.

01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:20.480
So if you want to get into
the same page as your partner,

01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:22.470
this is a really great
opportunity to do that.

01:12:22.470 --> 01:12:26.420
We're also trying to ask
a dear friend of mine who

01:12:26.420 --> 01:12:28.400
does outdoor education
with kids to do

01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:30.380
a camp during the
day for the kiddos

01:12:30.380 --> 01:12:33.860
so that kids can be in camp,
and the parents can get support.

01:12:33.860 --> 01:12:35.520
Really excited about that.

01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:37.880
And if you want more
information about that,

01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:38.970
that's on mindbodymoms.com

01:12:38.970 --> 01:12:43.520
Thinking of other things
that might be relevant--

01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:48.650
in 2018, we just lead a yoga and
mindfulness and surfing retreat

01:12:48.650 --> 01:12:49.850
in Costa Rica.

01:12:49.850 --> 01:12:53.630
And before I had my son, I
used to lead family retreats

01:12:53.630 --> 01:12:54.830
internationally.

01:12:54.830 --> 01:12:57.230
And we're thinking of
doing that again in 2018

01:12:57.230 --> 01:13:00.950
to have a family retreat
abroad, so stay tuned if you

01:13:00.950 --> 01:13:02.304
want to stay connected to us.

01:13:02.304 --> 01:13:03.470
Or write your email address.

01:13:03.470 --> 01:13:05.109
We ask you to
actually read it twice

01:13:05.109 --> 01:13:07.400
because usually we get letters
or numbers that we don't

01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:09.029
know if it's a four or an h.

01:13:09.029 --> 01:13:10.570
So if you can write
your email twice,

01:13:10.570 --> 01:13:12.300
that will help us stay in touch.

01:13:12.300 --> 01:13:17.570
I want to go back to one of
the questions about competition

01:13:17.570 --> 01:13:21.530
and having a hard time
with losing a game.

01:13:21.530 --> 01:13:28.040
In my practice when I was just
beginning to work with kids,

01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:30.320
and kids would come in
and the parents would say,

01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:32.030
he can't deal with
not winning this game.

01:13:32.030 --> 01:13:32.654
He flips out.

01:13:32.654 --> 01:13:34.070
He has a major
tantrum every time.

01:13:34.070 --> 01:13:37.215
I would usually begin by
helping him, coach him.

01:13:37.215 --> 01:13:38.090
And we'd play a game.

01:13:38.090 --> 01:13:40.380
And I'd say, see this
is how you like--

01:13:40.380 --> 01:13:43.250
I was modeling
good sportsmanship.

01:13:43.250 --> 01:13:46.640
And it didn't really
have any effect.

01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:49.460
One of my mentors,
Larry Cohen, who

01:13:49.460 --> 01:13:53.330
wrote "The Art of Roughhousing
and Playful Parenting"

01:13:53.330 --> 01:13:57.310
said something that was like,
I would never do with a client.

01:13:57.310 --> 01:14:00.650
He said, OK, you're doing
positive role modeling, that's

01:14:00.650 --> 01:14:01.700
fine.

01:14:01.700 --> 01:14:02.700
Do the opposite.

01:14:02.700 --> 01:14:04.408
I say, what do you
mean, do the opposite?

01:14:04.408 --> 01:14:06.710
And he said, model
a really poor loser.

01:14:06.710 --> 01:14:09.440
I said, how would that help?

01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:12.140
How would modeling
poor losing help?

01:14:12.140 --> 01:14:13.410
So I thought about it.

01:14:13.410 --> 01:14:15.047
And I just gave it
a shot one time.

01:14:15.047 --> 01:14:16.130
And I modeled poor losing.

01:14:16.130 --> 01:14:19.340
And I modeled poor losing in
a really overly dramatic way.

01:14:19.340 --> 01:14:23.420
And the parent was like,
what did you do in that room?

01:14:23.420 --> 01:14:24.510
The next day he was fine.

01:14:24.510 --> 01:14:25.819
He could play a game.

01:14:25.819 --> 01:14:27.610
And he didn't even care
that he was losing.

01:14:27.610 --> 01:14:28.610
What did you do?

01:14:28.610 --> 01:14:30.560
So I started
exploring this more.

01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:35.136
And then that fast
forward taking work

01:14:35.136 --> 01:14:37.010
with Patty Wipfler in
Hand in Hand Parenting,

01:14:37.010 --> 01:14:39.410
she has a concept
called "Play Listening."

01:14:39.410 --> 01:14:43.580
And Play Listening means you
are the goofy, incompetent one.

01:14:43.580 --> 01:14:45.780
And you can't seem
to do their thing.

01:14:45.780 --> 01:14:50.222
So when my son was learning to
walk, I would walk over to him.

01:14:50.222 --> 01:14:51.680
And I'd fall and
trip on the floor.

01:14:51.680 --> 01:14:53.300
And he'd laugh and
laugh and laugh.

01:14:53.300 --> 01:14:56.160
And what it does, is
it offloads tension.

01:14:56.160 --> 01:14:58.670
This is the theory-- it offloads
tension and anxiety that's

01:14:58.670 --> 01:15:01.320
built up in the system by
not being able to do things.

01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:02.870
So in this case,
the thing that's

01:15:02.870 --> 01:15:05.930
not being able to
be done well is

01:15:05.930 --> 01:15:08.930
losing with good sportsmanship.

01:15:08.930 --> 01:15:14.330
So I am then modeling losing
with poor sportsmanship

01:15:14.330 --> 01:15:15.800
in an overly dramatic way.

01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:18.764
I can't figure out how to
lose and feel OK about it.

01:15:18.764 --> 01:15:19.430
I wanted to win.

01:15:19.430 --> 01:15:20.960
I wanted to win.

01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:22.550
So I'm throwing
this big tantrum.

01:15:22.550 --> 01:15:24.380
The other thing
that I'm doing that,

01:15:24.380 --> 01:15:26.730
as my therapist cap
comes on to explain,

01:15:26.730 --> 01:15:28.190
like why would this work--

01:15:28.190 --> 01:15:29.750
is externalization.

01:15:29.750 --> 01:15:31.310
So there's this
issue he's having

01:15:31.310 --> 01:15:34.610
inside of him of not being
able to handle losing well.

01:15:34.610 --> 01:15:37.250
And I'm propping it out of
him and putting it into me.

01:15:37.250 --> 01:15:41.270
It's like cinema therapy,
or like drama therapy.

01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:43.280
Now it's in me at a
distance from him.

01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:44.590
And he can see it.

01:15:44.590 --> 01:15:46.994
And he be like, oh my
god, that's so uncool.

01:15:46.994 --> 01:15:48.410
So usually what
will happen when I

01:15:48.410 --> 01:15:52.719
start having this big
tantrum around losing

01:15:52.719 --> 01:15:54.510
is the kid will come
up to me and say look,

01:15:54.510 --> 01:15:55.700
it's not that big of a deal.

01:15:55.700 --> 01:15:57.060
Why are you acting that way?

01:15:57.060 --> 01:15:57.560
Stop.

01:15:57.560 --> 01:15:58.100
Relax.

01:15:58.100 --> 01:15:58.599
It's fine.

01:15:58.599 --> 01:15:59.420
It's just a game.

01:15:59.420 --> 01:16:00.550
And they coach me.

01:16:00.550 --> 01:16:03.110
So it's out of them, and
they start coaching me.

01:16:03.110 --> 01:16:05.856
So I know this is highly
counter-intuitive.

01:16:05.856 --> 01:16:07.730
And like me, you probably
will be like, well,

01:16:07.730 --> 01:16:08.771
I'm not going to do that.

01:16:08.771 --> 01:16:09.810
That's just ridiculous.

01:16:09.810 --> 01:16:11.960
But if you give it
a shot, I encourage

01:16:11.960 --> 01:16:14.840
you to practice Design Thinking
and see if it might work.

01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:17.930
It's helped a lot of kids that
I've worked with really stuck

01:16:17.930 --> 01:16:21.820
with competition, really having
a hard time with losing well.

01:16:21.820 --> 01:16:26.060
I'll close with one
last inspiration here.

01:16:26.060 --> 01:16:29.790
So in the Boston Globe
probably over 20 years ago,

01:16:29.790 --> 01:16:33.230
there was this discussion on
egg banks and sperm banks.

01:16:33.230 --> 01:16:36.980
And so some Nobel Laureate
wrote in and said,

01:16:36.980 --> 01:16:39.410
we should gather sperm banks.

01:16:39.410 --> 01:16:42.800
And all of the people who
become Nobel Laureates,

01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:45.770
we should get sperm from them
and create these really smart

01:16:45.770 --> 01:16:46.610
people out of them.

01:16:46.610 --> 01:16:48.104
And a feminist
wrote in and said,

01:16:48.104 --> 01:16:49.520
well, if there's
sperm banks there

01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:51.680
should be egg banks, of course.

01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:53.390
And a Nobel Laureate
from Harvard

01:16:53.390 --> 01:16:57.890
wrote in and said, forget
sperm banks and egg banks.

01:16:57.890 --> 01:16:59.900
Just practice loving.

01:16:59.900 --> 01:17:03.210
How do you think one ends
up as a Nobel Laureate?

01:17:03.210 --> 01:17:06.290
By wanting love, that's how.

01:17:06.290 --> 01:17:09.230
By wanting it so badly,
one worked so hard,

01:17:09.230 --> 01:17:11.600
and ends up a Nobel Laureate.

01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:14.780
But it's a consolation prize.

01:17:14.780 --> 01:17:17.450
So instead of thinking about
sperm banks and egg banks,

01:17:17.450 --> 01:17:18.830
just practice loving.

01:17:18.830 --> 01:17:20.630
Love a Russian, a Jew--

01:17:20.630 --> 01:17:23.490
not just people
here, but everywhere.

01:17:23.490 --> 01:17:25.340
So we hope that
of all the things

01:17:25.340 --> 01:17:27.140
that you've learned
today, you'll

01:17:27.140 --> 01:17:30.110
learn that this
is all about love.

01:17:30.110 --> 01:17:32.270
This is about
practicing loving--

01:17:32.270 --> 01:17:34.670
loving, respectful
relationships with our kids

01:17:34.670 --> 01:17:36.410
that's mixed with firmness.

01:17:36.410 --> 01:17:40.329
So Danielle teaches about
kind and firm parenting.

01:17:40.329 --> 01:17:41.120
Both are important.

01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:47.150
AUDIENCE: I had so
much fun with you guys.

01:17:47.150 --> 01:17:48.941
I love being with a
group of people who are

01:17:48.941 --> 01:17:50.540
interested in the same things.

01:17:50.540 --> 01:17:55.981
And this is a great way to
spend a middle of the day.

01:17:55.981 --> 01:17:56.480
Yeah.

01:17:56.480 --> 01:17:58.910
Thank you for engaging
in and being here.

01:17:58.910 --> 01:17:59.810
Best of luck.

01:17:59.810 --> 01:18:02.860
[APPLAUSE]
