00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.720
You are listening to radiolab radio from w n y.

2
00:00:05.741 --> 00:00:07.450
S t. E.

3
00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:14.490
Let me tell you, there is nothing like the sheer elation of discovery.

4
00:00:14.491 --> 00:00:16.260
And I think you know this, this is the end of malaria.

5
00:00:16.261 --> 00:00:19.110
This is the end of everything else. Mosquitoes spread. Wait a minute, you know,

6
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.300
ticks spread Lyme disease. We can probably get rid of that too.

7
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.350
So in the morning you were like [inaudible] you're singing to the turtles in

8
00:00:25.351 --> 00:00:27.600
the, in the park. And pretty much,

9
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.540
and I get myself a full day of being who?

10
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.450
And then I started thinking but, but, but,

11
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.380
but what if something goes wrong?

12
00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:41.950
I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich.

13
00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.280
This is radio lab and the guy that you just heard is Kevin Esvelt.

14
00:00:45.281 --> 00:00:46.061
He's a scientist.

15
00:00:46.061 --> 00:00:50.740
He was talking to our producers store in wheeler and Molly Webster about CRISPR,

16
00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.870
which is a technology, actually it's a new,

17
00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.700
it's a gene editing technology that did, can we shape life actually?

18
00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:58.570
Yeah. And we uh,

19
00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.950
we ended up doing an entire show about this and we called it a antibody's part

20
00:01:02.951 --> 00:01:03.401
one.

21
00:01:03.401 --> 00:01:08.170
I do remember that if there was going to be a part to that name that it's like

22
00:01:08.171 --> 00:01:10.960
telling someone you got them a birthday present but you haven't yet.

23
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.460
[inaudible] they do. We should just own up Radiolab listeners.

24
00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.520
We did not blueprint their presence. Let's just listen.

25
00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:24.400
That teams mean no, we meant to, we meant to have a part two but you know,

26
00:01:24.401 --> 00:01:26.310
we were doing a story. It fell apart.

27
00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.410
We again always work out tape sucked frankly.

28
00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:30.790
And we thought it was going to be a story.

29
00:01:30.791 --> 00:01:33.430
It just turned and turn out to be a story. But now we have,

30
00:01:33.431 --> 00:01:36.820
what we're going to do is we're going to pay you what you're doing is the part

31
00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.440
two. Yeah, this is the part two,

32
00:01:38.441 --> 00:01:43.441
finally part two because CRISPR in the time that we did the thing till now has

33
00:01:44.081 --> 00:01:47.380
gone banana. Crazy. So much has happened. Really? Yeah.

34
00:01:47.381 --> 00:01:49.660
Like every day in the science section,

35
00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.280
which I know we all read religiously if there is a CRISPR thing. Yeah.

36
00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.040
So just to get us started, we're going to play you the original piece. Uh,

37
00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.330
for those of you who never heard it,

38
00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.570
just to sort of set the baseline and then we're gonna come back and tell you all

39
00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.380
the stuff that has happened since. Yeah. Yes, there is.

40
00:02:05.381 --> 00:02:07.560
Let me explain to you how I got, got started with this.

41
00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.730
You were at some kind of an affair. Yeah. A, I'll tell you how good.

42
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.740
I was at a party party. Uh, it was a, it was a,

43
00:02:13.741 --> 00:02:17.310
a conference where they have a lot of different people of different disciplines

44
00:02:17.311 --> 00:02:20.130
come together, you know, one of those. Um,

45
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.980
there are panel discussions of various things and so we were at one of the like

46
00:02:22.981 --> 00:02:25.170
functions and, uh,

47
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.220
it was a situation where like dinner hadn't yet been served and there was a lot

48
00:02:29.221 --> 00:02:32.100
of booze being served. Everybody was like drunk on an empty stomach.

49
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.360
So I was standing there with some biologists. Oh, they're the fun ones.

50
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.310
The junk biologists. Yes. My people fairly. And uh, they, uh, we were,

51
00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.980
they, they started to lose their shit,

52
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.510
like genuinely lose their shit about this thing called crisper. And like,

53
00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.210
I've never seen scientists this excited about anything. So I was like,

54
00:02:51.211 --> 00:02:52.980
what is this thing? Wait, what is CRISPR?

55
00:02:52.981 --> 00:02:54.300
And they were trying to explain it to me,

56
00:02:54.301 --> 00:02:56.700
but they couldn't slow down enough for me to get it.

57
00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.010
I gathered it had something to do with genetics. And then at one point, one of

58
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.380
<v 2>the biologists tournament, he was like, I'll tell you what it is.</v>

59
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.150
I can use CRISPR to take a little dog and Poof, make it into a big dog.

60
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.180
Give me a Chihuahua. I could turn it into the size of a great Dane.

61
00:03:10.181 --> 00:03:13.570
And I was like, no, you can't. He's like, yes I can. I could do it with CRISPR.

62
00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.870
I was like, what the hell is this thing? Do you want me to sit here as usual?

63
00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.820
If you sit here, I will get out, let me know, imply, and I know,

64
00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.770
no, no, no, no. You'd be sitting here together.

65
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.090
So what happened was I came back and I immediately called science writer Carl

66
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.350
Zimmer, because I just figured for this kind of thing. It's as a Karl thing.

67
00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.600
I got to talk to Carl. So I, uh,

68
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.610
I basically asked them the awake while the fuss,

69
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.020
maybe it was just the alcohol or,

70
00:03:38.021 --> 00:03:40.690
but maybe there's something really happening here. Oh,

71
00:03:40.691 --> 00:03:43.600
there's something totally happening here. I mean, it's big.

72
00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.600
He started at the beginning. So the, the,

73
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.280
you can actually find like the first reference to CRISPR in a 1987 paper from

74
00:03:53.111 --> 00:03:54.580
some Japanese scientists.

75
00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.200
They basically described something weird in Nikolai and they said,

76
00:03:59.201 --> 00:04:02.650
we don't know what this is. Ecolab are bacteria inside humans.

77
00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.600
And like all living things equalize made up of DNA, A's and t's and C's and g's.

78
00:04:07.601 --> 00:04:11.830
And what happened was that these scientists were reading a chunk of that genetic

79
00:04:11.831 --> 00:04:16.831
code when they found this really strange stretch of DNA,

80
00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.640
strange channel. Well, so basically what it was, um,

81
00:04:21.641 --> 00:04:23.650
was five identical sequences

82
00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:29.280
in a row.

83
00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.660
And then they were separated by very short sequences in between them that were

84
00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.230
all different from each other. These little blurbs, it'd be like,

85
00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:38.453
<v 3>okay,</v>

86
00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:42.553
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

87
00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.310
<v 2>and they looked at this and I'm like, well, what,</v>

88
00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.890
this is nothing like we've seen before.

89
00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:51.940
Repeated sequences in bacterial genomes are kind of unusual.

90
00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.120
Seems very strange. Some biologists felt that, you know,

91
00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.020
there must be a purpose for these among those purpose seekers. Jennifer Doudna,

92
00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.750
University of California Berkeley. She's a cell biologist. Yeah.

93
00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:05.780
So it's Doudna not dude. No, it's Doudna. I used to be called the dude, uh,

94
00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:07.330
sometimes in the, in school,

95
00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:11.860
but in the movie she will be played by Jeff Bridges. Right. Anyhow,

96
00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:13.780
same goes on.

97
00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:17.800
A scientist are seeing these little repeat blurb repeats everywhere. Yes.

98
00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.700
Releasing bacteria. Lots and lots of, lots of species of bacteria. They say,

99
00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.920
okay, wait a minute. That's kind of cool.

100
00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.770
They're finding it so often that they decided they had to give it a name.

101
00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:28.720
And this is where the name CRISPR comes from. Yes.

102
00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:32.260
The full official name is clustered regularly.

103
00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:37.120
Interspaced short palindromic repeats. Oh my God. Oh,

104
00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.610
I don't know why they called it CRISPR. It's kind of a good spirit.

105
00:05:39.611 --> 00:05:43.720
It's like a furniture manufacturer or something. It sounds like an app. Yeah.

106
00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:48.340
Yeah. CRISPR. CRISPR. But now scientists had this puzzle,

107
00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:53.460
if nature at this level preserve something intact here and here and here and

108
00:05:55.271 --> 00:05:58.530
here and here and here. And some of these heroes are,

109
00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.430
are creatures that have been around for a hundreds of millions of years.

110
00:06:01.431 --> 00:06:05.900
You figure, well, whatever this is, it's doing something, doing something,

111
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:10.730
but what it doesn't take very long before the first big clue comes up.

112
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.910
All right, fast forward 2005 now,

113
00:06:13.911 --> 00:06:18.260
scientists have these big searchable databases of DNA sequences,

114
00:06:18.261 --> 00:06:20.660
so some scientists think, well, let's do a search.

115
00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:24.590
Let's see if these repeating patterns. We keep finding match.

116
00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:29.620
Anything else that's out there in the world and the scientists are using

117
00:06:30.351 --> 00:06:34.460
computers to just line up these structures of DNA with thousands upon thousands

118
00:06:34.461 --> 00:06:37.280
of different species and then click.

119
00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:42.920
All of a sudden they discover that those bits of DNA between the repeats,

120
00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:49.910
the stuff in the middle, those blurps, these are matching virus DNA.

121
00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:55.840
Like you can find viruses with genes where these little,

122
00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:59.880
you know these little two, the bacteria had virus inside of them. Yup.

123
00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:03.590
Is that what that mean? That a virus brought it into these cells?

124
00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:08.000
The origin of it. The first recognition was this is virus DNA.

125
00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:13.660
Somehow all these bacteria have little snippets of virus DNA wedged in these

126
00:07:14.061 --> 00:07:16.520
particular places in their genome,

127
00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:18.410
which is a little weird if you think about it.

128
00:07:18.411 --> 00:07:20.270
I mean these are totally different creatures.

129
00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:23.930
It would be like inside a human finding, a little bit of mosquito DNA.

130
00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:28.250
You're one. How do we interpret this? Well, actually there was one scientist,

131
00:07:28.251 --> 00:07:32.600
his name is Eugene Koonin who looked at these results and just said, okay,

132
00:07:32.601 --> 00:07:36.740
I get it. It's a defense system. Why would he think that?

133
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:39.100
Because he's a brilliant man. What do you mean? I went to,

134
00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:44.390
if I went to a large sanitation dump and I found a teeny bit of human hair,

135
00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:48.530
why would I think, oh, I got it. It's a defense mechanism. I wouldn't know it.

136
00:07:48.531 --> 00:07:51.530
Just like a human, right. Well, you see I,

137
00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:56.930
that metaphor might sort of betray your lack of scale and microbiology.

138
00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:00.650
I'm just saying like this is not a dump. All right.

139
00:08:00.651 --> 00:08:05.651
This is bacteria are not gonna just let virus DNA get into their genes willy

140
00:08:06.141 --> 00:08:09.950
nilly. Okay. Remember, viruses are the big enemy, right?

141
00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:13.550
If your bacteria, viruses make your life a nightmare.

142
00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:16.850
Think about it in the ocean. Okay.

143
00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:21.940
The the ocean is full of viruses and viruses kill up to 40% of all of those

144
00:08:24.831 --> 00:08:28.270
bacteria every day. Really? Every day. Yeah,

145
00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:33.260
and we know that they have defenses. What Eugene Koonin said was,

146
00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:34.603
okay,

147
00:08:34.910 --> 00:08:39.910
I'm going to bet that these bacteria are somehow grabbing pieces of DNA from

148
00:08:41.241 --> 00:08:46.241
viruses and then they're storing it and now they have a way of recognizing those

149
00:08:47.091 --> 00:08:50.050
viruses if they come in later. Ah,

150
00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:54.830
like little Polaroid shots of the enemy, right? No, thy enemy. Yeah,

151
00:08:54.831 --> 00:08:55.860
like a most wanted

152
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.470
<v 5>poster. What do you call the Mugshot?</v>

153
00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:03.800
This is Eugene Koonin leader of the evolutionary genomics group at the National

154
00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:05.910
Center for Biotechnology Information.

155
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:09.750
He's the guy that Carl referenced who thunk up the whole idea that maybe these

156
00:09:09.751 --> 00:09:14.250
bits of virus DNA inside the bacteria is the bacteria trying to defend itself,

157
00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:19.470
but really if I, if I, if I couldn't eat myself with anything here,

158
00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:21.780
it was not so much guessing this because you know,

159
00:09:21.781 --> 00:09:25.770
then you see the identical sequence that gets pretty obvious. It is

160
00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:32.030
figuring out how the mechanism was likely to go.

161
00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:37.350
So can you walk us through how the mechanism is likely to work? All right.

162
00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:39.450
What happens

163
00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:41.700
<v 6>if you know, when a virus comes in</v>

164
00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:45.480
to a cell, I just kind of

165
00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:51.270
explodes and just kind of releases naked genes.

166
00:09:51.271 --> 00:09:53.130
Basically if you're this bacteria,

167
00:09:53.131 --> 00:09:55.440
these things might take over your cells so you've got to respond,

168
00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:59.760
move struck that guy, you should have mo tippo vap, arms of defense.

169
00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:01.440
If you've never seen this virus before,

170
00:10:01.441 --> 00:10:05.550
usually the first thing you do says Eugene is you send out these enzymes to

171
00:10:05.551 --> 00:10:06.750
attack the viruses.

172
00:10:06.751 --> 00:10:11.751
They're sort of like the ground troops and they fight really hard but much of

173
00:10:12.541 --> 00:10:13.374
the time

174
00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:21.290
<v 5>fail and then no one will Heuer hear about you again.</v>

175
00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:25.550
They're not terribly sophisticated fighters, so very often virus takes over,

176
00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:28.070
the bacteria dies,

177
00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:34.160
but but there is some non zero probability

178
00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:40.130
<v 6>that you actually survive that. If you do,</v>

179
00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:43.850
then what the bacterial do is send in some new enzymes to basically clean up,

180
00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:44.841
to go out,

181
00:10:44.841 --> 00:10:49.841
find any stray viruses and then caught the enemy DNA into futile smokes

182
00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:54.870
<v 5>Jesus. And here he says is where you get to the storage part.</v>

183
00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:59.370
Those enzymes will then take those little bits of virus and shove them into the

184
00:10:59.371 --> 00:11:01.410
bacteria, his own DNA,

185
00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:06.150
right in those little spaces between the repeats right there and nobody else.

186
00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:11.180
So I use those spaces in my own DNA as a storage facility.

187
00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:13.820
Yes. If your view is as a, as a, as a,

188
00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:19.490
you use it as a memory device because here's what happens next time that virus

189
00:11:19.981 --> 00:11:20.814
shows up,

190
00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:23.450
<v 6>sprays it, jeans everywhere.</v>

191
00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:28.050
Now you are prepared and this is where the CRISPR story really gets going

192
00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:31.260
because instead of sending out the ground troops,

193
00:11:31.261 --> 00:11:32.610
we're probably going to get their asses beat.

194
00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:35.120
Now you can actually send out the big gun

195
00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:39.590
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

196
00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:44.170
<v 6>and in fact what the cell does is it will manufacture these special molecular</v>

197
00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:46.620
assassins in.

198
00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:51.040
We'll give those assassins a copy of that little bit of virus DNA it has in

199
00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:52.780
stores, basically saying, here, take this.

200
00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:57.020
If you see anything that matches this pattern, kill it. Yeah.

201
00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:01.270
And these attackers, do we know what they let one of them looks like. Yup.

202
00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:04.540
So we know what the protein looks like. It it, um, it actually looks,

203
00:12:04.541 --> 00:12:09.250
I would describe it, um, a little bit like a clamshell sort of imagine pack man,

204
00:12:09.251 --> 00:12:12.340
but kind of misshapen and rough in each one of these guys.

205
00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:16.270
What it has is a copy of that virus DNA.

206
00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:18.580
It's got the mugshot that it's kind of waving around.

207
00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:23.470
What then happens is that whenever the PAC man bumps into some virus DNA,

208
00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:28.600
it pulls apart the DNA and zips. It reads it.

209
00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:30.820
If it's not the right one, it goes on.

210
00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:35.293
<v 4>Nope.</v>

211
00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:37.963
<v 6>Okay.</v>

212
00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:39.543
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

213
00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:45.330
<v 6>and if that RNA has the same sequence,</v>

214
00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:50.070
then click click. It just locks in. And if that happens,

215
00:12:50.071 --> 00:12:54.150
then the DNA is trapped and molecular blades

216
00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:55.143
<v 4>come out</v>

217
00:12:56.990 --> 00:13:00.580
<v 6>and chop got, you didn't get shared. Did a mighty blow. Yeah.</v>

218
00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:04.570
So this is smart scissors too. It's like, are you like the thing I got?

219
00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:08.270
Are you like, say I got your, like to think I got sniff snip. All right,

220
00:13:08.271 --> 00:13:09.210
now we're going to kill.

221
00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:12.410
<v 5>Oh, I see. And it has to be exact. It has to be an exact match.</v>

222
00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:16.760
When scientists first discovered this whole system, they were fascinated.

223
00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:19.700
They were like, they're working it out. They're like, oh, okay.

224
00:13:19.701 --> 00:13:22.070
Then this happens and this happens. This happens. Cool.

225
00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:25.310
But then in walks the dude,

226
00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:31.940
<v 6>Jennifer Doudna with a crazy idea, I don't know if it's crazy radical.</v>

227
00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:35.540
This could be an amazing technology. This is a tool.

228
00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:39.690
This is a tool. Yes, right?

229
00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:43.990
This is a tool that we can use to cut DNA where we want to cut.

230
00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:49.110
The basic thought was, why don't we turn this defense into offsets?

231
00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:49.801
Because these things,

232
00:13:49.801 --> 00:13:53.430
they seem to be really good at cutting and yet they only seem to cut the things

233
00:13:53.431 --> 00:13:54.670
that are on their mugshot.

234
00:13:54.671 --> 00:13:57.900
So maybe I could just replace what's on their mugshot.

235
00:13:57.901 --> 00:13:59.940
So instead of them going after viruses,

236
00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:05.490
maybe they could go after a gene that causes Huntington's disease or hemophilia,

237
00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:08.160
for example. And this is actually something that's been done.

238
00:14:08.161 --> 00:14:09.950
So you've got a mouse with something like

239
00:14:10.010 --> 00:14:13.400
<v 5>hemophilia. Okay? This is a diseases caused by one bad gene.</v>

240
00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:15.200
So what you do is you take these little surgeons,

241
00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:17.420
you give them the mugshot for the bad gene,

242
00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:20.120
then you stick the surgeon with the new mugshot and a mouse.

243
00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:24.530
Then you set it loose and just like it's program to it,

244
00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:26.420
we'll find that gene and

245
00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:29.410
<v 4>click, click chop</v>

246
00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:30.663
<v 5>the scissors.</v>

247
00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:35.530
We'll end up cutting exactly the gene you wanted to cut to,

248
00:14:35.531 --> 00:14:39.760
the bad genes gone. Now the question is how do you put in the good gene? Right,

249
00:14:39.761 --> 00:14:40.270
right.

250
00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:43.450
It turns out actually according to Jennifer Doudna that that's actually not as

251
00:14:43.451 --> 00:14:45.760
hard as you would think. Really. Yeah.

252
00:14:45.761 --> 00:14:50.761
Apparently what you do is just throw this new good gene kind of in the

253
00:14:51.201 --> 00:14:52.040
neighborhood

254
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:54.830
<v 0>of where the old genius to be just in the general vicinity.</v>

255
00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:58.070
You don't have to get super precise. I mean, it turns out that um, you know,

256
00:14:58.071 --> 00:15:03.071
there are repair enzymes that are probably continually surveying and checking

257
00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:06.020
for breaks. She says what will happen is that inside the cell,

258
00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:09.170
these repair crews come along. They'll see the break,

259
00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:11.900
they'll see the good gene just sitting there next to the break,

260
00:15:11.901 --> 00:15:12.734
there'll be like, all right,

261
00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:18.110
I'll just stick it in and put the pretty guy in this space. Exactly. So,

262
00:15:18.111 --> 00:15:22.670
so we take advantage of a natural repair pathway that cells have.

263
00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:25.900
<v 2>They tricked both the cutters and the fixers. Yeah.</v>

264
00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:30.340
Now we're not assassinating anymore. Now we're actually engineering.

265
00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:36.300
We've gone from killing to refashioning.

266
00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:44.630
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

267
00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:47.660
<v 0>well, haven't we been designing genes doing genetic,</v>

268
00:15:47.661 --> 00:15:52.610
a form of genetic engineering for, I don't know, like 30 years. Yes. But

269
00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:55.533
not like this.

270
00:15:58.120 --> 00:15:58.190
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

271
00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:00.890
<v 0>genome editing technologies have been around for a long time,</v>

272
00:16:00.891 --> 00:16:04.460
but none of them have been as powerful as CRISPR is.

273
00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:06.800
That's Beth Shapiro from UC Santa Cruz.

274
00:16:06.801 --> 00:16:10.670
She was actually one of the biologists that I drunkenly talk to at that thing,

275
00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:14.420
elicit a modern art museum. I can't even really remember. I remember either

276
00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:21.170
to have the setting be so vague and yeah, here's how she put it to us. Um,

277
00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:23.930
back in the day, this was just like two years ago,

278
00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:27.320
you'd have these gene editor things. You would take one, put it in a cell.

279
00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:31.520
And what happened before was you would give it an some instructions about where

280
00:16:31.521 --> 00:16:33.620
to go and it might go there,

281
00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:37.550
but it might go to somewhere that's kind of related to where that was.

282
00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:40.880
So it's like you just take it right at Staten Island, but it takes a left.

283
00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.520
And not only would it take a left at Staten Island and not find there,

284
00:16:43.521 --> 00:16:46.850
but it would've cost you a fortune and taken up six months of your time to get

285
00:16:46.851 --> 00:16:50.270
that thing. And now you know it's really easy.

286
00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:54.440
You just give it that mugshot and it goes, I'm going to find that guy. Exactly.

287
00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:57.050
So it seems to be pretty precise and it's cheap.

288
00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:00.890
Like the old tools would set you back about five grand just to use them once

289
00:17:00.891 --> 00:17:05.060
CRISPR but 75 bucks. And here's the kicker says Carl,

290
00:17:05.061 --> 00:17:08.390
it seems at the moment that you can take these things out of bacteria,

291
00:17:08.391 --> 00:17:10.730
stick them into almost any other creature

292
00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:15.460
<v 2>and it still works. You can use the same CRISPR system on anything.</v>

293
00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:16.900
Can you like do it?

294
00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:21.460
If corn is vulnerable [inaudible] past you can do in corn and corn do it in

295
00:17:21.461 --> 00:17:22.630
anything. I have not.

296
00:17:22.631 --> 00:17:27.370
I'm waiting for someone to say CRISPR doesn't work in species x and I have not

297
00:17:27.371 --> 00:17:28.204
heard of that.

298
00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:31.640
<v 0>So basically what you have for the first time in science is this gene editing</v>

299
00:17:31.641 --> 00:17:35.390
technology that is cheap, precise, and possibly universal.

300
00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:41.270
And Jennifer Doudna says the moment, the full impact of that landed on her.

301
00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:43.970
I really, I literally had, you know,

302
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.160
the hairs on the back of my neck were standing up

303
00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:51.200
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

304
00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:54.450
<v 7>processing the fact that this thing exists, you know,</v>

305
00:17:54.451 --> 00:17:59.451
and that you could actually program it to cut DNA and just like this molecular

306
00:18:00.541 --> 00:18:03.780
scissors and I can just program it and it cuts DNA Roeder I want

307
00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:16.180
<v 8>it is amazing unless you think about it further,</v>

308
00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:18.400
which we will do in just a moment.

309
00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:23.110
I feel a cloud coming in over their eyes and just over there. Do you see,

310
00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:26.410
I see it's getting sort of horizon park over there, but we'll be right back.

311
00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:27.630
<v 0>Okay.</v>

312

324

<v 0>this is Radiolab, mom, Jab and Ron. I'm Robert Krulwich. Okay, so, uh,</v>

325
00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:21.460
clearly the possibilities are there to use CRISPR to treat disease, right?

326
00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:26.480
Right. But what if you could get a little more fanciful, right?

327
00:19:26.481 --> 00:19:29.750
Like what if you could actually go back in time and resurrect long lost

328
00:19:29.751 --> 00:19:32.600
creatures? I mean, this is something the Best Shapiro is talked about a lot.

329
00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:37.610
We could reconstruct using a computer what the genome sequence of the ancestor

330
00:19:37.611 --> 00:19:41.300
of all birds was, and that would have been a kind of dinosaur.

331
00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:44.540
And then we could use crispers to turn a chicken into that thing.

332
00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:48.530
Or what if you could take an elephant and snip, snip, snip,

333
00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:53.560
gradually turn it in to its long lost relative the wooly mammoth?

334
00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:58.670
No, cause they're related. But if they're very similar over well,

335
00:19:58.671 --> 00:20:00.830
right. But if you know the wooly mammoth genome,

336
00:20:00.831 --> 00:20:03.740
which they do because they apparently got it off some bone or some hair. Yeah.

337
00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:06.860
Then you could compare the number of differences.

338
00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:10.700
You use CRISPR to CRISPR out the different parts of the elephant and put in

339
00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:11.773
wooly mammoth instead.

340
00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:15.770
<v 8>Have you been in effect, go backwards in time and make changes in,</v>

341
00:20:15.771 --> 00:20:18.370
obviously I think you can go the other way too, right? I mean,

342
00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:22.880
humans are good at design. We're designing animals.

343
00:20:22.881 --> 00:20:27.881
So if it doesn't seem to me to be a crazy notion to imagine parents all over the

344
00:20:27.891 --> 00:20:30.770
world wanting, I don't know, taller children.

345
00:20:30.771 --> 00:20:34.220
So silencing the short jeans and favoring the taller jeans,

346
00:20:34.670 --> 00:20:39.670
getting rid of weak muscles and going for stronger ones and on and on and on and

347
00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:42.620
on. I don't know where the designing stops.

348
00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:46.900
<v 0>We sort of got into all of this with, uh, Carl Zimmer, science writer. If,</v>

349
00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.340
if you can

350
00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:53.650
<v 8>be very, very gene specific and you learn more and more about genes over time,</v>

351
00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:58.810
why couldn't you invent a creature? Why couldn't you make a pig with wings? You,

352
00:20:58.811 --> 00:21:01.780
you might one day get sophisticated enough to do that.

353
00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:04.660
<v 2>There's no wing at pig lab. You know,</v>

354
00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:07.240
the best you're going to hope for right now is the woolly mammoth lab.

355
00:21:07.241 --> 00:21:11.890
And that's down the hall from where the, where the, the real action is,

356
00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:16.550
is now there's a hall and at the end of the fall, use a winded Piccolo. No,

357
00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:18.850
nope. Yeah, I did. It may be 20 years from now.

358
00:21:18.851 --> 00:21:22.940
But that's what you're looking at. Well, I think, but the thing is that

359
00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:26.620
<v 8>it shouldn't anyone meal as that, that's really what we're talking about.</v>

360
00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:30.850
<v 2>Well, because you can't make weight wing into pigs just because of sort of</v>

361
00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:35.370
evolutionary barriers. Okay. Well, there's no reason for about to fly gentlemen.

362
00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:39.350
Calm down. Calm down. I'm just not, I mean, okay.

363
00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:44.470
I don't think that we need a federal department of homeland pig with wings

364
00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:49.040
security. I think we're okay there. All right,

365
00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:52.190
well we do need is like a,

366
00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:55.940
we do need to like figure out what are we going to do about CRISPR and humans.

367
00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:59.430
I mean, they're going to be using CRISPR for cancer. Okay.

368
00:21:59.650 --> 00:22:02.390
They're going to take people's immune cells out of their body and they're going

369
00:22:02.391 --> 00:22:07.391
to use CRISPR to basically allow them to make proteins are going to be able to

370
00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:13.340
grab onto cancer cells and attack their own cancer. Yeah. That's to be for that.

371
00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:17.150
I mean you have to be, well, I don't know. I mean are you for that is your,

372
00:22:17.151 --> 00:22:21.560
your, your you, you are tink. You are tinkering with someone's own body.

373
00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:25.970
You are altering their own cells. You know,

374
00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:27.823
dude,

375
00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:32.290
<v 8>where do I, it's just, I tell you, this is me.</v>

376
00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:36.370
I don't know if it's a religious thought or just the thought of a conservative

377
00:22:36.371 --> 00:22:40.780
person, but I mean I've, I grew up in the, in the test to baby era.

378
00:22:40.781 --> 00:22:45.010
I now know many wonderful adult formerly test tube babies and I,

379
00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:49.300
I remember being astonished that no, so I can't,

380
00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:53.440
I don't know where the sacred begins and ends anymore on that particular turf.

381
00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:58.210
I guess what I'm instead on is I'm on, on um, uh,

382
00:22:58.211 --> 00:23:02.230
Hobbsy in view of human beings that there is something about human beings

383
00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:05.650
including scientist, human beings, all human beings. That is,

384
00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:08.230
there's a darkness and a light there, there, there,

385
00:23:08.231 --> 00:23:10.660
there's an angelic side to being human and there's a very,

386
00:23:10.661 --> 00:23:13.000
very difficult side of,

387
00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:18.160
as the human beings get more and more power to create and design and essentially

388
00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:19.810
create a future,

389
00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:25.140
that future will include the imaginations both light and dark of humans and that

390
00:23:25.781 --> 00:23:26.614
will be new in the world.

391
00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:29.690
<v 2>I don't think it is new because if you go back to the start of the scientific</v>

392
00:23:29.691 --> 00:23:30.524
revolution,

393
00:23:30.530 --> 00:23:35.530
someone like Francis Bacon would say explicitly like science is going to be both

394
00:23:37.251 --> 00:23:41.900
about learning about how the world works and using that knowledge to control it.

395
00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:44.600
You know, this has been discovered. This has been published.

396
00:23:44.810 --> 00:23:48.920
Everybody knows it exists. Hmm. Um, if you, if you're going to say like, okay,

397
00:23:48.921 --> 00:23:50.930
now we're going to all, we're going to outlaw this.

398
00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:53.630
I'm not saying festing that well, what are you suggesting?

399
00:23:53.631 --> 00:23:56.630
I think we should cringe level as opposed to just the big part. Right?

400
00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:58.820
That's all grains. Ready? One, two, three.

401
00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:05.000
[inaudible] what did we've cringed in that way? What do we do now? Well,

402
00:24:05.001 --> 00:24:08.780
who does, I don't know, but we all come in if that's what you're arguing.

403
00:24:10.170 --> 00:24:14.270
[inaudible] you cringed meanly and deep and you

404
00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:19.100
[inaudible] with attitude. I am cringing with, with, I would like,

405
00:24:19.101 --> 00:24:21.170
because you're afraid of like dragons.

406
00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:25.410
You're saying?

407
00:24:25.410 --> 00:24:29.360
<v 11>You're saying, oh my God, yes. I'm afraid of dragging them down. Okay.</v>

408
00:24:29.370 --> 00:24:32.780
So that conversation with Carl was four months ago and uh,

409
00:24:33.150 --> 00:24:36.780
a lot has happened in, in, in that time because to the question that you asked,

410
00:24:36.781 --> 00:24:38.630
like where does the sacred beginning end? Well,

411
00:24:38.631 --> 00:24:42.660
one of the lines that had been drawn by Jennifer Doudna and others was that we

412
00:24:42.661 --> 00:24:47.220
should not use this technology on humans who haven't been born yet,

413
00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:50.130
meaning not on sperm cells or egg cells.

414
00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:53.300
Because if you CRISPR say an embryo, that is a

415
00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:55.880
<v 6>permanent change, right?</v>

416
00:24:55.881 --> 00:24:59.120
That is a change to the DNA that will be passed on to their children and their

417
00:24:59.121 --> 00:25:01.760
children's children and their children's children's children.

418
00:25:01.790 --> 00:25:06.790
And you can't ask the person if that's okay because you're doing it before

419
00:25:08.031 --> 00:25:10.970
they're born. Consent becomes a real issue.

420
00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:15.320
And if you imagine making these changes and they cascade through generation

421
00:25:15.321 --> 00:25:19.640
after generation, you could affect the evolution of organisms. And it's,

422
00:25:19.670 --> 00:25:22.940
I don't want to say trivial, but it's, you know, it's fairly easy to do it. Wow.

423
00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:26.240
It's kind of profound. I feel it's really profound. Profound.

424
00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:27.800
But it was just an idea

425
00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:32.210
that is until for the first time in history,

426
00:25:32.211 --> 00:25:36.380
researchers in China have successfully edited the human genome and an embryo.

427
00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:40.020
Just two months ago, it was announced that a Chinese team from Estonia,

428
00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:45.050
Watson University use a technique called CRISPR to edit DNA in human embryos.

429
00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:47.840
It's a way of hacking evolution itself. Well,

430
00:25:47.841 --> 00:25:51.830
this is hugely controversial now these embryos, the Chinese team had edited,

431
00:25:51.831 --> 00:25:54.260
they were created through IVF and they were not viable,

432
00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:58.250
but these are embryos that are not going to actually develop into a person,

433
00:25:58.251 --> 00:26:01.020
so they're, they're going to be discarded anyway. It's still thinking,

434
00:26:01.050 --> 00:26:04.220
figuring it out with those embryos. What's to stop any of us from going further?

435
00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:07.070
I ologist and bioethicists are sounding an alarm.

436
00:26:07.071 --> 00:26:11.030
Scientists face accusations that they crossed an ethical line.

437
00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:13.850
That's the sort of thing could be sort of a slippery slope towards toward

438
00:26:13.851 --> 00:26:17.120
designer babies. Essentially genetically engineering the human race.

439
00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:22.370
<v 2>That's your chance to kind of test your levels. Okay.</v>

440
00:26:22.910 --> 00:26:26.090
Now that the cringe party had spread and Robert didn't seem like such a loon.

441
00:26:26.091 --> 00:26:29.000
Yeah, we called up Carl again. Well, we have to revisit.

442
00:26:29.001 --> 00:26:33.350
We have to revisit it because in our Iron Mageddon conversation in which I

443
00:26:33.351 --> 00:26:37.310
believe I was extremely alarmist and you were extremely down pudding,

444
00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:41.660
I feel that I should do a small little parade called the

445
00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:49.310
<v 8>the Alamo. It's like, and remember, remember China and you have to close.</v>

446
00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:50.850
You should just begin anytime you want.

447
00:26:50.851 --> 00:26:52.930
Like getting on your knees and saying how sorry you are. I don't,

448
00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:56.040
can you start from there? Um, I'm sorry.

449
00:26:56.041 --> 00:26:59.070
So are we actually surrounded by, uh,

450
00:26:59.130 --> 00:27:03.850
an army of clones with superpowers? Not yet. Not yet,

451
00:27:04.010 --> 00:27:05.850
but I think the dyke has been opened. I believe,

452
00:27:05.851 --> 00:27:10.530
I'm going to quote somebody who said, uh, maybe a few weeks ago,

453
00:27:10.531 --> 00:27:13.380
I think maybe it was last week, even writing for National Geographic.

454
00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:17.640
I think it was, maybe it was somebody named Carl who said that, uh,

455
00:27:17.641 --> 00:27:22.590
the news from China and that news was probably the beginning of an entire new

456
00:27:22.591 --> 00:27:27.030
era. I think I actually said it was a historical moment. Yes. Right? Yes, yes.

457
00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:29.330
And I, and I still stand by that. Do you feel

458
00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:32.660
<v 0>differently now than the first time we talked? Yeah, that's really the question.</v>

459
00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:36.960
<v 2>I don't feel different actually because, um,</v>

460
00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:40.260
there's really no scientific surprise here.

461
00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:40.921
<v 0>He says,</v>

462
00:27:40.921 --> 00:27:43.290
people have been doing all these CRISPR experiments and all these different

463
00:27:43.291 --> 00:27:45.720
mammals, we're mammals. This is bound to happen.

464
00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:47.880
And in fact it may be happening more than we think.

465
00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:51.960
One account in the journal Nature has said that four other Chinese labs are

466
00:27:51.961 --> 00:27:55.590
doing this kind of work as we speak. But Carl also told us,

467
00:27:55.770 --> 00:27:57.450
which he said was unsurprising too,

468
00:27:57.451 --> 00:28:00.220
but I actually find kind of surprising that the CRISPR work,

469
00:28:00.330 --> 00:28:03.150
this Chinese team did didn't work very well.

470
00:28:03.210 --> 00:28:05.400
It worked kind of.

471
00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:06.900
<v 2>I mean,</v>

472
00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:11.900
and only a few of the cases did they really get exactly what they wanted.

473
00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:13.140
<v 0>Um,</v>

474
00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:17.070
they tried using CRISPR and about 86 embryos and they only get up to work right

475
00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:19.860
in maybe 28 and then a lot of them,

476
00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:23.310
CRISPR made the wrong cuts and screwed up the cells and that led them to

477
00:28:23.311 --> 00:28:27.300
conclude that this is a technology that's not ready right now for application in

478
00:28:27.301 --> 00:28:31.390
the human germline. And, um, I, I agree. Hello?

479
00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:32.230
<v 2>We're starting of,</v>

480
00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:36.010
we still are in this kind of a fortunate position where we can say,

481
00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:41.070
oh well it's dangerous so we shouldn't use it on in human embryos.

482
00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:45.110
I just don't think that we're going to be able to sort of uh,

483
00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:48.670
find refuge there in like 10 or 20 years in 10 or 20 years. You know,

484
00:28:48.671 --> 00:28:53.260
CRISPR will be so sophisticated that people will be able to say,

485
00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:58.150
I can get you the change you want and I can do it safely.

486
00:28:58.330 --> 00:29:03.160
I can guarantee you that you will have human embryos that have the alteration in

487
00:29:03.161 --> 00:29:06.060
the particular gene you want. So then, yeah,

488
00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:10.150
<v 0>in fact Jennifer Doudna told us that this experiment or similar experiments have</v>

489
00:29:10.151 --> 00:29:14.170
been repeated in mice with more advanced CRISPR systems.

490
00:29:14.290 --> 00:29:16.930
Cause apparently there are many different kinds and they're,

491
00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:18.580
it was done with almost no errors.

492
00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:24.180
<v 2>I feel like we're sort of displacing all our ethical concerns on to something</v>

493
00:29:24.701 --> 00:29:25.870
that hasn't happened yet.

494
00:29:26.150 --> 00:29:30.430
We really are concerned about what we're doing to the human gene pool. You know,

495
00:29:30.431 --> 00:29:31.540
it's already here.

496
00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:33.270
<v 0>Take as an example,</v>

497
00:29:33.271 --> 00:29:37.800
in vitro fertilization bout 60,000 kids are born a year through IVF.

498
00:29:37.801 --> 00:29:42.220
And it's probable that some of those parents chose whether they wanted a boy

499
00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:46.090
<v 2>or a girl. And when people started doing IVF, there was a huge controversy.</v>

500
00:29:46.091 --> 00:29:48.970
People said this was dangerous. This was unnatural.

501
00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:53.650
I don't see people who are unable to sleep at night because of the existence of

502
00:29:53.651 --> 00:29:57.550
IVF. Yeah, yeah. Now I'm going to sound like I'm on Robert side of this. I mean,

503
00:29:57.610 --> 00:30:02.340
okay. So, so they won't, it won't. It will. Okay. All right.

504
00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:04.720
Here we go. So, okay, so,

505
00:30:06.550 --> 00:30:08.160
so you guys know about, uh,

506
00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:12.460
all the stuff going on Iceland where they're looking at people's DNA and they're

507
00:30:12.461 --> 00:30:14.680
looking for disease genes and so on.

508
00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:18.430
And when they were looking at these Icelandic people,

509
00:30:18.431 --> 00:30:23.350
they found that some people had a gene that, uh,

510
00:30:23.470 --> 00:30:28.330
protects them against Alzheimer's. It reduces their odds of getting Alzheimer's.

511
00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:33.190
Let's imagine your doctor said now if you'd like for an extra thousand dollars,

512
00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:38.460
we will take these IVF embryos and we will use CRISPR to give them the Alzheimer

513
00:30:39.971 --> 00:30:44.350
protecting variant. Would you like that?

514
00:30:44.410 --> 00:30:47.360
Do you want to add that to your, to your procedure? Sure.

515
00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:49.490
Or would you like your child to,

516
00:30:49.530 --> 00:30:53.860
to face a future of have Alzheimer's,

517
00:30:54.490 --> 00:30:55.323
your choice.

518
00:30:55.590 --> 00:30:57.840
<v 0>See, here's my, here's my thing. Here's my thing with this whole,</v>

519
00:30:57.841 --> 00:31:01.140
with this whole thing, I'm, I'm a little bit haunted by the thing you said,

520
00:31:01.141 --> 00:31:04.950
which is that when it's not dangerous anymore, what will we do?

521
00:31:04.951 --> 00:31:07.980
And I'm afraid we've already answered that question, that it's not,

522
00:31:07.981 --> 00:31:12.420
it's not a question that's open anymore because if we're already doing this kind

523
00:31:12.421 --> 00:31:17.000
of stuff and who's going to say no to that is going to say no to that we're

524
00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:19.980
demonstrating. Yeah, we've already answered the question.

525
00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:23.610
<v 4>Yeah. We may have.</v>

526
00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:32.270
<v 0>So that's how we ended our piece, which is now two years old,</v>

527
00:31:32.510 --> 00:31:33.650
roughly roughly.

528
00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:37.880
And the drunk biologists at Cheddar cocktail party couldn't have been more

529
00:31:37.881 --> 00:31:39.890
pressured. When you think about it, this is one of those,

530
00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:43.550
this is one of the strange cases where like you do a story usually like we just

531
00:31:43.630 --> 00:31:45.260
kind of leave it behind, we move on to other things.

532
00:31:45.261 --> 00:31:48.470
But in the last almost two years,

533
00:31:48.890 --> 00:31:52.910
so much has happened believable that we figured we need to update this thing.

534
00:31:53.210 --> 00:31:54.890
And so what we did is we asked a,

535
00:31:54.891 --> 00:31:58.490
our producer editors who on wheeler and our producer Molly Webster to sort of

536
00:31:58.491 --> 00:32:02.330
just go out, ask around and make some calls and tell us, you know,

537
00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:05.750
what's been going on. Well for one, uh, Molly,

538
00:32:05.751 --> 00:32:09.980
do you want to give him the big news and Jennifer Lopez is going to do a

539
00:32:09.981 --> 00:32:13.100
television show based on CRISPR? No,

540
00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:18.270
I mean it's fiction active role in the fictional narrative of the show. Oh.

541
00:32:18.450 --> 00:32:20.270
Like she's a, she's a cop or something and

542
00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:25.340
buy something and crisper's involved really

543
00:32:27.710 --> 00:32:31.700
headline. Let me show you the scissors. Wow. It's cross over to that extent.

544
00:32:31.730 --> 00:32:35.240
That's the thing is like it's, it's um, yeah cause I like the,

545
00:32:35.241 --> 00:32:39.020
I was like Jennifer Lopez knows about CRISPR and she was like this is such a

546
00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:43.790
button issue. We're doing a show. That's amazing. Yeah. Okay.

547
00:32:43.791 --> 00:32:47.000
So so moving Jay, putting Jay Lewis side. Yeah,

548
00:32:47.001 --> 00:32:49.040
let's do some science developments.

549
00:32:49.041 --> 00:32:50.730
They've kind of been quite a few of them are,

550
00:32:50.731 --> 00:32:52.400
we know there've been a few of those, right? Yeah.

551
00:32:52.401 --> 00:32:53.990
What did that with run us through those. I mean,

552
00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:56.450
I guess I would just say that it's being used everywhere now.

553
00:32:56.451 --> 00:32:58.760
So it's being used in crops. It's being used in medicine.

554
00:32:58.761 --> 00:33:03.080
It's being used in basic research. It's being used in humans, in humans.

555
00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:06.050
Really it's being used in eyeballs. Yeah.

556
00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:09.680
They want to start a clinical trial where they're actually injecting a syringe

557
00:33:09.681 --> 00:33:14.570
full of CRISPR carrying viruses into your eyeball to overcome a genetic

558
00:33:14.571 --> 00:33:17.270
condition that leads to blindness.

559
00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:20.600
So this would be like the viruses injecting the CRISPR that then goes and cuts

560
00:33:20.601 --> 00:33:22.460
out the bad genes. Yeah, exactly.

561
00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:23.870
<v 2>Take, you know,</v>

562
00:33:23.871 --> 00:33:26.900
a big syringe full of viruses and just stick it in people's eyes.

563
00:33:27.610 --> 00:33:32.170
<v 0>Yeah. So of course when we did the update, Soren and I called Carl Zimmer.</v>

564
00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:34.510
<v 2>Yeah. It's a, things are moving</v>

565
00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:37.290
<v 0>very fast and what kinds of things.</v>

566
00:33:37.350 --> 00:33:41.160
So they are doing things that look like curing diseases.

567
00:33:41.161 --> 00:33:46.161
So Carl told us about one study where it seems like they cured a certain type of

568
00:33:47.161 --> 00:33:52.080
muscular dystrophy and mice cured muscular, cured, muscular dystrophy and mice.

569
00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:55.770
Wow. Well then mice don't become normal mice, but they get much,

570
00:33:55.771 --> 00:33:57.840
much stronger than they would have been. Yeah.

571
00:33:57.841 --> 00:34:02.600
So in your body you have a gene that makes a protein that gives your muscle

572
00:34:02.601 --> 00:34:03.300
strength,

573
00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:08.300
but with muscular dystrophy there's like a typo in that gene and mutation.

574
00:34:08.701 --> 00:34:10.980
And so that proteins not made and

575
00:34:11.070 --> 00:34:13.920
<v 2>the result is that, uh, your muscles,</v>

576
00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:16.990
<v 0>we'll start to turn into sort of a fat like substance.</v>

577
00:34:17.110 --> 00:34:20.520
That's how it's been described. No power. Yeah. Okay.

578
00:34:20.530 --> 00:34:24.010
So your diaphragm gets weaker and weaker, your heart gets weaker.

579
00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:27.970
So in this case, they use CRISPR to fix that gene.

580
00:34:28.270 --> 00:34:33.270
So you get the protein in these mice and they actually saw like the heart gets

581
00:34:33.371 --> 00:34:38.371
stronger or the mouse was able to push with more force on a button.

582
00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:42.480
And so they said over weeks they just saw like strength building up. Really? Oh,

583
00:34:42.910 --> 00:34:45.190
are they going to do that in humans? Pretty first.

584
00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:47.020
Pretty first step at this point. But

585
00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:47.311
<v 2>yeah,</v>

586
00:34:47.311 --> 00:34:50.820
this is literally like one of the first experiments to show that this approach

587
00:34:50.850 --> 00:34:52.560
could work in muscular dystrophy.

588
00:34:52.670 --> 00:34:55.490
<v 0>But I mean that's not a disease with a cure.</v>

589
00:34:55.491 --> 00:34:59.840
Is that not until potentially in mice now? Yeah. Wow. Yeah.

590
00:35:00.070 --> 00:35:05.070
<v 2>And there are some human trials that have either started or are probably going</v>

591
00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:06.880
to start soon treating cancer

592
00:35:06.950 --> 00:35:09.500
<v 0>for example, people are talking about one in lung cancer.</v>

593
00:35:09.590 --> 00:35:13.620
They think they can what? Sure. Lung cancer,

594
00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:15.620
no.

595
00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:20.620
What they want to do though is they want to use CRISPR to go into immune cells

596
00:35:20.871 --> 00:35:24.620
where it would cut out the part of the DNA that kind of puts the brake on the

597
00:35:24.621 --> 00:35:25.454
immune cell.

598
00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:27.100
<v 2>And so you're,</v>

599
00:35:27.101 --> 00:35:31.860
you're taking your immune cell off the leash and it can attack,

600
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.490
uh, tumors more aggressively. I see.

601
00:35:35.730 --> 00:35:38.070
So the folks who invented then must

602
00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:41.550
<v 0>stand to earn a fortune. I mean, I think, oh billions.</v>

603
00:35:41.850 --> 00:35:46.260
There's actually a big patent dispute that's happening right now. So one of the,

604
00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:49.800
right now, this is the one thing that I have heard about, a lot of,

605
00:35:49.801 --> 00:35:53.310
you had been checking your CRISPR inbox. You might've seen last week,

606
00:35:53.850 --> 00:35:57.840
there were two teams, Jennifer Doudna, his team out at UC Berkeley.

607
00:35:58.410 --> 00:36:00.810
The one we just heard from. Yeah, sort of the west coast team.

608
00:36:00.811 --> 00:36:05.811
And then on the other side is this group of researchers at the Brode Institute,

609
00:36:06.270 --> 00:36:10.510
which is on the east coast. And so basically they both filed for um,

610
00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:14.940
a CRISPR patent. So there was sort of this like east coast,

611
00:36:14.941 --> 00:36:18.720
west coast for the last year showdown.

612
00:36:18.990 --> 00:36:20.820
And just last week, um,

613
00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:25.890
the US patent office decided that it would indeed go to brode.

614
00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:29.040
This is the, not doubt and a team, but not doubt and a team,

615
00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:33.030
but there are more patents to be awarded and there will probably be appeal.

616
00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:34.980
So I don't think anyone thinks it's settled yet.

617
00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:38.070
So in the civil war of,

618
00:36:38.490 --> 00:36:42.090
over over CRISPR patents, there has been a Gettysburg,

619
00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:44.940
but the war is not one that, there are many more battles,

620
00:36:44.941 --> 00:36:49.060
I think that will happen. Gotcha. Yeah. There, is there anything else on the,

621
00:36:49.061 --> 00:36:53.080
on the list of like what's happening now? Exciting stuff happening now? Oh yeah.

622
00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:56.320
Can I, oh, can I tell the guy? Can we do favorite store and can I do,

623
00:36:56.350 --> 00:37:00.500
can I do my favorite? And then you can do your favorite. Um, some my,

624
00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:01.990
my favorite came from Carl.

625
00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:06.100
<v 12>Yeah. Yeah. They're actually trying to use it, uh, as an alternative antibiotics</v>

626
00:37:07.130 --> 00:37:10.110
<v 0>w we had, I didn't even understand what that means.</v>

627
00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:15.660
I was like getting antibiotic to me, it's a pill that I take.

628
00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:20.640
So what would CRISPR Howard CRISPR replaced that your pill would have CRISPR in

629
00:37:20.641 --> 00:37:22.500
it? How would it work? You know,

630
00:37:22.501 --> 00:37:25.950
in the same way you would take your amoxicillin or your antibiotic pill,

631
00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:30.360
you would actually take a pill that was filled with CRISPR and then it would go

632
00:37:30.361 --> 00:37:34.170
out and it would fight bacteria that is attacking your body.

633
00:37:34.330 --> 00:37:35.930
<v 12>So you could pick out, you know,</v>

634
00:37:35.950 --> 00:37:40.950
some super essential gene that it has and chop it and that will kill the

635
00:37:41.771 --> 00:37:42.530
bacteria.

636
00:37:42.530 --> 00:37:46.700
<v 0>Oh, it would have turned the assassins on the bacteria. Exactly.</v>

637
00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:50.780
So there you go. Wow. Yeah. The antibiotic thing seems huge, right?

638
00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:52.730
Because everyone's at this moment where they're like,

639
00:37:52.731 --> 00:37:54.410
what happens with the next super bug?

640
00:37:54.650 --> 00:37:59.120
If you could actually just go in there and kamikaze the DNA of like staff or

641
00:37:59.121 --> 00:38:03.170
whatever, he'd be solving a lot of illnesses. Yeah. Well what's,

642
00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:06.220
what's is sore in your face with, with your face?

643
00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:10.190
The coolest thing I guess for me. Hello? Maybe the scariest too. Hi Kevin.

644
00:38:10.850 --> 00:38:12.290
How are you? I'm doing great. How are you?

645
00:38:12.291 --> 00:38:14.360
Came from a conversation that we had with this guy, Kevin.

646
00:38:14.450 --> 00:38:18.170
I'm Kevin Esvelt asphalt. It's very smelt. I'm at the MIT media lab.

647
00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:22.080
He was sort of on the early edge of thinking about CRISPR. I'm an,

648
00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:25.220
I think of myself as an evolutionary engineer before anything else got into

649
00:38:25.221 --> 00:38:28.250
biology because when he was a kid, you went to the Galapagos. Yeah.

650
00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:32.150
My parents took me there when I was 10 or so and I was just captivated,

651
00:38:32.151 --> 00:38:33.890
just looking at all of the creatures and I thought,

652
00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:36.130
I want to make organisms that are as beautiful as that.

653
00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:39.970
<v 5>You actually thought I wanna make organisms as beautiful as that. Yeah.</v>

654
00:38:41.050 --> 00:38:43.900
That's like the childhood vision and then it's so hard, right?

655
00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:48.430
It wasn't possible. And so you sort of forget it. But now with CRISPR,

656
00:38:48.431 --> 00:38:51.580
like almost like all things become possible. So anyway,

657
00:38:51.581 --> 00:38:54.550
to get to the crazy part, Kevin, couple of years back,

658
00:38:54.551 --> 00:38:58.540
he's working at the Harvard medical school and one day he's walking to work

659
00:38:58.570 --> 00:39:03.250
through this, um, this park, this park called the Emerald Necklace in Boston.

660
00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:03.490
It's,

661
00:39:03.490 --> 00:39:06.970
it's beautiful and there's a small river flowing through it and you have these

662
00:39:07.810 --> 00:39:10.630
ponds and there's turtles and whatever geese and, and you know,

663
00:39:10.631 --> 00:39:14.440
he's thinking about CRISPR and what it can do and all these different animals

664
00:39:14.441 --> 00:39:17.800
that are around him. And he has this, this thought,

665
00:39:18.010 --> 00:39:23.010
what if we could encode CRISPR in the genome?

666
00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:29.460
What if we programmed the genome to do genome editing on its own? Wait,

667
00:39:30.090 --> 00:39:32.980
what? What I'm, I'm, I'm not sure I follow that. What does he,

668
00:39:33.010 --> 00:39:36.120
what is he saying? Well, the first gene drive system here,

669
00:39:36.190 --> 00:39:37.390
maybe this is a way to think about it.

670
00:39:38.090 --> 00:39:42.850
Let's say that you want to tweak a mosquito and make it so that the little

671
00:39:42.851 --> 00:39:45.670
parasite that carries malaria, terrible, awful malaria,

672
00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:48.310
either can't get into the mosquito or can't live in it.

673
00:39:48.311 --> 00:39:51.430
And so that mosquito will no longer carry malaria. That would be great.

674
00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:53.560
That would be a great thing because malaria is a bad thing.

675
00:39:53.950 --> 00:39:55.480
So you could now take CRISPR,

676
00:39:56.110 --> 00:39:59.270
send it into the mosquito and change a gene inside the mosquito.

677
00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:04.000
So now that mosquito either doesn't let malaria parasite in or kills it or

678
00:40:04.001 --> 00:40:07.180
whatever, but basically doesn't carry it and, and that's great.

679
00:40:07.181 --> 00:40:11.410
But then I put it out into the wild and it's got us fend for itself amongst all

680
00:40:11.411 --> 00:40:14.170
the other mosquitoes. So my mosquito has a special gene,

681
00:40:14.171 --> 00:40:16.720
but it's going to mate with some mom, mosquito.

682
00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:20.430
And that mom mosquito is going to have the normal old gene and the baby's going

683
00:40:20.431 --> 00:40:23.770
to get my special gene, but it's also going to get the normal gene.

684
00:40:23.830 --> 00:40:28.630
And that means that your baby has like a 50% chance of having your special tree.

685
00:40:28.970 --> 00:40:32.410
Oh. Because only one of those two genes gets expressed in the baby.

686
00:40:32.411 --> 00:40:34.480
And then in the next generation, the grand baby,

687
00:40:34.481 --> 00:40:38.320
there's only a 25% chance and you know, on and on and on.

688
00:40:38.350 --> 00:40:41.530
So you're exponentially losing CRISPR powers.

689
00:40:41.531 --> 00:40:45.040
Your chances just each generation get less and less that this gene is going to

690
00:40:45.041 --> 00:40:47.830
stick around. That's right. Because regardless of what we do,

691
00:40:47.831 --> 00:40:52.120
natural selection wins in the end until Kevin is walking to work through the

692
00:40:52.121 --> 00:40:53.890
park and has his idea,

693
00:40:53.891 --> 00:40:58.690
which is to use CRISPR to create something called a gene drive.

694
00:40:59.290 --> 00:41:01.720
Gene drive change. Yeah.

695
00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:05.500
Instead of just snip the DNA and insert the gene that we want,

696
00:41:05.710 --> 00:41:09.940
we also insert the genes that encode the CRISPR system and tell it to make that

697
00:41:09.941 --> 00:41:12.250
particular change. Here's how it works.

698
00:41:12.580 --> 00:41:17.290
You go into the mosquito and give it the new gene that makes it resistant to

699
00:41:17.291 --> 00:41:22.291
malaria and then right next to that you put the genes for the CRISPR system.

700
00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:24.580
You just use to make that change.

701
00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:26.860
Like you're putting it like a spare scissors or something. Yeah.

702
00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:28.510
And here's how that plays out.

703
00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:32.550
Your first mosquito has this gene with the new change and it also has this

704
00:41:32.551 --> 00:41:34.730
scissors. Yeah. And then it meets some normal mosquito,

705
00:41:34.731 --> 00:41:38.360
which has the normal gene, the two end up side by side in the baby.

706
00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:41.360
And now the new mosquito gene makes the little scissors,

707
00:41:41.361 --> 00:41:46.361
which go over to the normal gene snippet and turn it into itself.

708
00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:51.080
So now there's two copies of the new gene in the offspring without any human

709
00:41:51.081 --> 00:41:51.914
assistance.

710
00:41:52.190 --> 00:41:57.190
CRISPR will cut the original version and copy over the change that gene does.

711
00:41:57.651 --> 00:42:02.600
The work that I used to do in the lab on its own inside the baby.

712
00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:06.930
Oh, interesting. So, okay, so the, so the, it's like I set it on autopilot.

713
00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:11.960
So you're basically allowing them the mosquito parent to pass the scissors to

714
00:42:12.421 --> 00:42:14.250
the baby, which then snip, snip, snip,

715
00:42:14.370 --> 00:42:17.580
and then that baby passes the scissors to the next baby snip, snip, snip. Yep.

716
00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:21.660
Yep. And it is literally like a chain reaction. Yeah. And so, you know,

717
00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:25.740
from baby to grand baby to great grandbaby now instead of letting that gene

718
00:42:25.741 --> 00:42:29.700
disappear, you're driving it into the next generation.

719
00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:31.850
And then that just keeps going

720
00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:34.530
<v 13>down the line, down the line, down the line. Yes.</v>

721
00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:38.220
This is something that spreads indefinitely.

722
00:42:38.730 --> 00:42:43.730
This gene is going to spread like wildfire through the entire wild populations

723
00:42:44.050 --> 00:42:46.500
that you don't change just one mosquito.

724
00:42:46.530 --> 00:42:50.430
You change all of those insects probably everywhere in the world.

725
00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:51.361
According to Kevin.

726
00:42:51.361 --> 00:42:56.361
This is the kind of change that could given enough time spread across an entire

727
00:42:57.120 --> 00:42:57.953
species.

728
00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:02.690
<v 5>So this,</v>

729
00:43:02.690 --> 00:43:06.410
this idea of the mosquitoes and watching it rampage through a population.

730
00:43:06.411 --> 00:43:09.920
Have they done this? Um, after we had first published the idea,

731
00:43:10.430 --> 00:43:13.550
we tried it in east, worked on the first dry, you know,

732
00:43:13.940 --> 00:43:18.110
they just plopped a little yeast loaded with the gene drive into a population to

733
00:43:18.111 --> 00:43:20.930
see if it would take over and one week later. Yup.

734
00:43:21.450 --> 00:43:24.170
And Kevin told us there are probably now I think it's 10 different groups who

735
00:43:24.171 --> 00:43:25.940
are working on gene drive system.

736
00:43:26.210 --> 00:43:26.660
<v 0>Yes.</v>

737
00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:31.660
They are doing it in mosquitoes and in parasitic worms and in rodents,

738
00:43:33.670 --> 00:43:35.960
uh, it's all happening in the lab, but still they are

739
00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:38.930
<v 5>trying out, you know, this,</v>

740
00:43:38.990 --> 00:43:42.980
this method for spreading genes through a population. Yeah.

741
00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:44.450
I just think that's awesome.

742
00:43:44.450 --> 00:43:47.810
<v 0>It's terrifying. Like, honestly, I just keep thinking of, it's like, oh we've,</v>

743
00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:52.700
we've just hit over a domino and then walked away and aren't watching where the

744
00:43:52.701 --> 00:43:54.140
rest of them are falling. Yeah.

745
00:43:54.270 --> 00:43:58.080
<v 5>I'm very glad you think that it took me one full day to reach that point.</v>

746
00:43:58.770 --> 00:44:01.110
Initially I was late at, Oh let me tell you,

747
00:44:01.111 --> 00:44:04.240
there is nothing like the sheer elation of discovery and I was thinking that,

748
00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:06.930
you know this, this is the end of malaria. This is the end of everything else.

749
00:44:06.931 --> 00:44:10.020
Mosquitoes spread. Wait a minute, you know, tick spread Lyme disease.

750
00:44:10.021 --> 00:44:13.480
We can probably get rid of that too. I thought in the morning you were like,

751
00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:16.950
you're singing to the turtles in the, in the park.

752
00:44:16.951 --> 00:44:21.951
And pretty much I give myself a full day of being who and then I started

753
00:44:22.861 --> 00:44:24.150
thinking but, but, but,

754
00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:28.140
but what if something goes wrong?

755
00:44:29.070 --> 00:44:33.150
And suppose let's go back to your case making the mosquitoes and malaria

756
00:44:33.151 --> 00:44:35.640
resistant. Well that seems pretty safe.

757
00:44:35.641 --> 00:44:40.641
I mean malaria is a human pathogen doesn't really affect other animals.

758
00:44:42.810 --> 00:44:47.520
But what if say the change you make to the mosquito makes it slightly more toxic

759
00:44:47.521 --> 00:44:50.370
to something that eats those mosquitoes, then you have to consider, okay,

760
00:44:50.371 --> 00:44:53.310
what eats those mosquitoes and what eats those things?

761
00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:53.671
<v 0>You know,</v>

762
00:44:53.671 --> 00:44:57.810
it could be that all the frogs or the fish or whatever start to die off and then

763
00:44:57.840 --> 00:45:00.210
that makes something else die off and something else die off.

764
00:45:00.270 --> 00:45:04.050
And that's an incredibly complex system and you just, you just don't know.

765
00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:09.080
Or it could be that making a mosquito malaria resistant also somehow makes it do

766
00:45:10.501 --> 00:45:11.840
better in some environment.

767
00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:15.600
Then the mosquito population blows up and then it turns out that it somehow

768
00:45:15.601 --> 00:45:19.050
makes it easier to carry some other disease. So,

769
00:45:19.490 --> 00:45:22.440
and you're likely to go wrong. Yeah. And you're no, yeah,

770
00:45:22.830 --> 00:45:27.570
but how do you know we should save this point that Kevin is really thinking

771
00:45:27.571 --> 00:45:28.321
about all this stuff?

772
00:45:28.321 --> 00:45:32.400
He brought together a group of scientists to come up with some safeguards for

773
00:45:32.401 --> 00:45:35.790
this type of research so it doesn't escape out of the lab.

774
00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:40.650
And his team is only working with this a version of gene drive that they,

775
00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:44.790
they sort of rigged it so that it only lasts for certain number of generations

776
00:45:44.791 --> 00:45:46.530
and it sort of runs out of steam.

777
00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:51.640
<v 5>But scientists can perfectly well start playing around with something in the lab</v>

778
00:45:52.730 --> 00:45:56.750
that could affect a whole lot of other people if it happened to escape.

779
00:45:57.380 --> 00:46:02.380
I think what this technology forces us to reckon with is that now it's at least

780
00:46:03.620 --> 00:46:05.330
theoretically, and again we don't know for sure,

781
00:46:05.331 --> 00:46:10.331
but it's theoretically possible for one person to decide to change the local or

782
00:46:12.981 --> 00:46:17.330
possibly the global environment. And that's,

783
00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:20.450
that's ethically problematic, right? Yeah.

784
00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:23.210
<v 2>I mean, you know, if, if,</v>

785
00:46:23.211 --> 00:46:27.440
and when somebody uses crisper, uh,

786
00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:30.290
on an embryo and that embryo goes up into a person,

787
00:46:30.530 --> 00:46:34.340
that will be a momentous thing. But if you were to gene drive somebody,

788
00:46:37.220 --> 00:46:40.570
think about that, you know, gene drive, like say a few people and,

789
00:46:40.571 --> 00:46:44.180
and not tell them and you know, they have kids and so on, like,

790
00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:48.380
and you'd be driving whatever gene it is that you are engineering.

791
00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:53.450
I'm into more and more people. Um, and uh, that's, that's different.

792
00:46:54.460 --> 00:46:58.360
<v 0>God, you know what I'm thinking about? The thing that Jennifer Doudna said,</v>

793
00:46:58.361 --> 00:47:01.840
I think it was her in our first piece about like if you make a change in say an

794
00:47:01.841 --> 00:47:03.340
embryo, like you looking, let me give this,

795
00:47:03.410 --> 00:47:07.700
let me snip snips and they have given this future child make it taller, right?

796
00:47:07.780 --> 00:47:12.490
Whatever. Like you're doing that without the consent of that unborn thing. Yes.

797
00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:13.241
But if, if you,

798
00:47:13.241 --> 00:47:16.150
if you now do what you guys are talking about using this gene drive thing,

799
00:47:16.390 --> 00:47:20.560
well now you're doing it without the consent of that unborn thing and all future

800
00:47:20.561 --> 00:47:24.610
generations of that unborn thing. And so the consent issues just become like,

801
00:47:24.790 --> 00:47:28.870
yeah, unfathomable. Exactly. You know, I guess we're all for taller,

802
00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:29.913
but we're

803
00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:31.510
<v 14>not all for taller.</v>

804
00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:35.260
So in the end it has something to do with democracy itself.

805
00:47:35.290 --> 00:47:40.290
Like you sit there with a tool of change in your hand and you choose it.

806
00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:46.930
But in the act we with this gene drive in the act of choosing it for yourself

807
00:47:46.990 --> 00:47:47.561
this way,

808
00:47:47.561 --> 00:47:51.490
you choose it for an uncountable number of others who do not have the choice.

809
00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:53.930
