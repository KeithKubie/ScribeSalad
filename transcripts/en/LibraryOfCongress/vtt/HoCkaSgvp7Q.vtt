00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.680
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:16.740
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Good afternoon.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.500
I hope all of you have enjoyed
meeting one another over lunch

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.710
and I've been reading about and
hearing about the great work

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.050
that you are all doing
and we are very grateful

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.200
that you are doing this work.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:35.020
And congratulations to our
outstanding 2017 award winners

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.080
and best practice honorees.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.300
When I think about the
impact of literacy I have

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.040
to quote the great statesman
Frederick Douglas who said,

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.880
"Once you learn to read
you will be forever free."

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.310
And your work is helping
millions of people free themselves

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.840
from the shackles of illiteracy

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.400
to achieve the success
that literacy can bring.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.700
And now it is my great
pleasure to introduce the man

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.090
who is most responsible
for today's event.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.410 position:56%
David Rubenstein created the Library

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:16.260
of Congress Literacy Awards
Program five years ago.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:21.190
And thanks to his generous ongoing
support and belief in the power

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.340
of literacy, the library
has awarded nearly one

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:32.460 position:56%
and a half million dollars in prizes
to 66 institutions in 30 countries.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.740
Please join me in welcoming
Mr. Rubenstein.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.030
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: The Library
of Congress Literacy Awards came

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.470
about because I had thought that
the Library of Congress in addition

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.300 position:56%
to doing all the wonderful things it
does should be promoting literacy.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.740
Literacy as we all know is a
terrible problem in our country.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.720
Illiteracy rate, depending on
how you look at it is somewhere

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.490
between 12 and 13 percent of
adults are functionally illiterate.

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.920
And that is a serious
problem, as you all know.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.270 position:56%
If you are functionally illiterate
your chance of earning a good income

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.780
and also having a happy
life is reduced.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.080
Your chance of being part

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.960
of our criminal justice
system is increased.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.780
So the idea is to try
to reward people

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.990
and acknowledge people
who have done sometime.

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.550
We're not going to change all the
illiteracy problems in this country

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.480
by having these awards, but
maybe some people will read

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.150
about what we're doing and some
people might be more motivated

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.390
to do some things to
help illiteracy problems.

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.720
I shouldn't say while we don't
address the other problem I'm

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.080
worried about which is aliteracy.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.290
It is something is also of concern.

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.350
About 30% of people who graduate

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.780
from college do not ever read
another book in their life,

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.710
which is not a good situation.

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.280
But it's sad that so many
people who can read choose not

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.830
to read and not to read a book.

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.810
And it's a sad situation.

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.030
So what we're trying to do today
is just really honor people

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.310
who have done great things with
their life in terms of helping

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.100
to reduce illiteracy in the
areas they are talking about.

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.330
We don't have enough money
to give everybody an award.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.780
We don't have as much money as
we should have to fight the cause

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.270
of illiteracy but we are trying
to do something to say the Library

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.480
of Congress cares about it
and it's something that all

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.340
of you should be proud
for what you're doing.

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.260
&gt;&gt; R. Sriram: To summarize,
there are not enough books

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.060
in enough languages
and not enough access.

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.750
Pratham Books was established in
2004 to address these problems

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:31.630 position:56%
in India where there are some 300
million children under the age of 14

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:39.390 position:56%
and where we have 22 official
languages and some 700 smaller ones.

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.560
We're one of the largest
children's publishers in India.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.150
And despite having achieved group
readership of some 50 million

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.930
in the last 14 years, we are
far from achieving our mission

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.630
of putting a book in
every child's hands.

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.160
We therefore started to explore
how technology could play a role

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.300
in proving access to books

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.480
and in creating more
books in more languages.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.770
And this has led us to
a very exciting journey

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:08.880
and has brought us here.

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:15.080
With regard to print books we have
developed over 350 original titles

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.990
in 2 0 languages for a
total of 2,500 titles.

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:24.380
We have printed and distributed
14 million books so far,

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.760
plus 16 million story cards.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.980
Our price points are
five cents to 60 cents

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.850 position:56%
for a high quality full color books,

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.070
a sample of which is available
in the room next door.

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:40.810
Our estimated readership
so far is 50 million and

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.080
yet 300 million children
to reach in India alone.

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.670
&gt;&gt; Sharon Darling:
So I started thinking

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:50.250
about a more holistic approach
to education and looking

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.390
at how do we bring parents
and children together?

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:55.720
How do we get them out of the
[inaudible] that they're in.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.740
And how do we help the parents
get the skills they need

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.480
to start feeling good
about themselves?

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.180
Because I had taught adults
to read in a church basement

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.720 position:56%
and I knew the stigma that they felt

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.420
and the fear of letting
anybody know.

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:08.860
And so how do we get
them to come out?

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.460
And how do we get their
children engaged

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.960
so that they get an early start
and they don't fall so far behind?

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.080
So the only thing I could think
of in the hills and hollers

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.420
of Kentucky was to bring them
on a school bus to a school.

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:21.830
And so the three and four year olds
came with their parents, the three

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.740 position:56%
and four year olds were right next
door, the parents go literacy skills

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.440
but they started feeling
like they could learn.

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.050
And the children were
getting good early childhood.

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:33.100
But they started coming together
as a group of parents to try

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.620
to solve problems together.

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.500
But what was the magic of it
was that the parents spent

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.540
at least an hour working with
their own children everyday.

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:43.050
So they had a chance to see the
early childhood teacher working

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:44.350
with their child.

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:46.850
They had a chance to know what
their child was doing through play

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:49.310
and how they were learning and
what they could do at home.

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:51.340
And most of all they
had a chance to know

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:53.590
that they were important
in their child's life.

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:55.570
Every parent cares
about their child.

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:58.360
So they had an opportunity to
get the skills and the knowledge

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.660
that they needed to play with
their children and have fun

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:03.900
with their children and at
the same time help them learn.

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:05.690
&gt;&gt; Joel Zarrow: We have
several design principles

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:09.040
that really provide the
foundation for the work we do.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:12.590
The first is that teachers
are the solution.

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:17.920
We are not going to increase early
literacy scores at the rate we need

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:22.140
to unless we provide teachers
with the support and expertise

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:27.000
and materials that they need in
order to do their job effectively.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.600
The second is let's focus

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:33.660
on research-based practices
not programs de jour.

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:37.470
So at CLI we take what's called
a balanced literacy approach.

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:41.110
We provide classrooms
with authentic text.

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:45.260
We help teachers learn the
strategies they need to learn

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:49.300
in order to be affective
early literacy instructors.

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:53.280
The third design principle
is partnership.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:57.930
We don't believe at CLI that what
we do in Chicago can be airlifted

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:00.610
and put down in Houston
and be expected

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:02.800
to have the same kind of impact.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:06.080
Rather we want to work with our
school or district colleagues.

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:10.200
Understand what their priorities
are, their areas of strengths are,

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.020
how they talk about the work,

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:17.550 position:56%
and support their efforts while
bringing our expertise to the table.

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:22.280
That way we're not this
outsourced early literacy solution.

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:25.030
Rather we're building
capacity within the district,

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:28.040
within the schools, or the
charter management organization

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.240
to get the work done.

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:34.100

of the Library of Congress.
