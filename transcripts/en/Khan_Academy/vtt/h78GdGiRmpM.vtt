00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.920
Welcome back.

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:06.530
I'm now going to introduce
you to a new tool for

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:08.370
solving derivatives.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.010
Really between this rule, which
is the product rule, and the

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:16.000
chain rule and just knowing a
lot of function derivatives,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.330
you'll be ready to tackle
almost any derivative problem.

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:20.420
Let's start with
the chain rule.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:31.810
Let's say that f of x is equal
to h of x times g of x.

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:32.780
This is the product rule.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.080
In the chain rule it was f of
x is equal to h of g of x.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.310
Right?

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:37.730
I don't know if you
remember that.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.980
In this case, f of x is equal
to h of x times g of x.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.570
If that's the case, then f
prime of x is equal to the

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.940
derivative of the first
function times a second

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:55.450
function plus the first
function times the derivative

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.030
of the second function.

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.990
Pretty straightforward.

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:59.350
Let's apply it.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.660
Let's say that-- I don't like
this brown color, let me pick

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.190
something more pleasant.

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.250
Maybe mauve.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:17.270
Let's say that f of x is equal
to 5x to the fifth minus x to

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:29.850
the seventh times 20x squared
plus 3x to them mine 7.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.610
So one way we could have
done it, we could just

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:32.520
multiply this out.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.310
This wouldn't be too bad, and
then take the derivative

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:37.200
like any polynomial.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.400
But let's use this product rule
that I've just shown you.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.470
So the product rules that says,
let me take the derivative of

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.890
the first expression, or h of x
if we wanted to map

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.240
it into this rule.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.360
The derivative of that is
pretty straightforward.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.470
5 times 5 is 25.

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.160
25x to the fourth, right?

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.480
Then minus 7, x to the sixth.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.780
We're just going to multiply it
times this second expression,

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.290
doing nothing different to it.

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.980
Maybe I'll just do it
in a different color.

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:18.920
Times 20x plus 3x minus 7.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.270
And then to that we will
add the derivative of

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.110
this second function.

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:35.000
The derivative of that second
function is 40x minus

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.590
21x to the minus eighth.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.570
And that times this
first function.

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:42.870
I guess I'll switch
back to mauve, I think

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.140
you get the point.

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:51.480
5x to the fifth minus
x to the seventh.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.660
All we did here was we said OK,
f of x is made of these two

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.730
expressions and they are
multiplied by each other.

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.930
If I want to take the
derivative of it, I take the

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.250
derivative of the first one and
multiply it by the second one.

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.530
And then I add that to the
derivative of the second

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.360
one and multiply it
by the first one.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.050
Let's do some more examples
and I think that will

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.860
hit the point home.

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.752
Clear image.

00:03:14.752 --> 00:03:18.850
Change the colors and
I'm back in business.

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.440
Let me think of a good problem.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.410
Let me do another one like
this, and then I'll actually

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.790
introduce ones and the product
rule and the chain rule.

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:40.630
So let's say that f of x is
equal to 10x to the third plus

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:53.180
5x squared minus 7 times
20x to the eighth minus 7.

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.970
Then we say f prime of x,
what's the derivative of

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.710
this first expression.

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:05.900
It's 30x squared plus 10x.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.290
And I just multiply it times
this expression, right?

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.570
20x to the eighth minus 7.

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:16.240
And I add that to the
derivative of this second

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:21.130
expression, this is all on one
line but I ran out of space,

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.600
160x to the seventh, right?

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.490
8 times 20 is 160.

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.520
And then the derivative
of 7 is zero.

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.440
So it's just 160x to
the seventh times this

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.060
first expression.

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:42.720
10x to the third plus 5x
squared minus seven.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:43.290
There we go.

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:44.300
And you could simplify it.

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.190
You could multiply this out
if you wanted or you could

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.590
distribute this out if you
wanted, maybe try to

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:49.730
condense the terms.

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:51.420
But that's really just algebra.

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.030
So this is using
the product rule.

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:55.880
I'm going to do one more
example where I'll show you,

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.140
I'm going to use the product
and the chain rule and

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:02.170
I think this will
optimally confuse you.

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:03.225
I want to make sure
I have some space.

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:09.260
Here I'm going to use a
slightly different notation.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.110
Instead of saying f of x and
then what's f prime of x, I'm

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:27.110
going to say y is equal to x
squared plus 2x to the fifth

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:40.200
times 3x to the minus three
plus x squared to the minus 7.

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:44.480
And I want to find the rate at
which y changes relative to x.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:48.130
So I want to find dy over dx.

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:49.950
This is just like, if this
was f of x, it's just

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:52.360
like saying f prime of x.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:53.290
This is just a [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:54.470
notation.

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:55.560
So what do I do in
the chain rule?

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.630
First I want the
derivative of this term.

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:02.460
Let me use colors to make
it not too confusing.

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.950
So what's the derivative
of this term?

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:08.540
We are going to use
the chain rule first.

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:15.990
So we take the derivative of
the inside which is 2x plus 2

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:18.790
and multiply times
the derivative of the

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:20.330
larger expression.

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:26.920
But we keep x squared plus 3x
there so it's times 5 times

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.470
something to the fourth.

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:33.320
And that something is
x squared plus 2x.

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.460
So there we took the derivative
of this first term right here

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:38.300
and then the product rules says
we take the derivative of the

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:40.740
first term, we just multiply
it by the second term.

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:49.120
So the second term is just 3x
to the minus 3 plus x squared

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.080
and all that to the minus 7.

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:57.240
We did that and then to that we
add plus the derivative of this

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.870
second term times
this first term.

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:01.280
We're going to use the
chain rule again.

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:02.750
What's the derivative
of the second term?

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:04.890
I'll switch back to
the light blue.

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:07.840
Light blue means the derivative
of one of the terms.

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:11.320
So we take the derivative of
the inside, the derivative of

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:18.710
inside is minus 3 times 3 is
minus 9, x go down one to

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:23.210
the minus 4, plus 2x.

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:26.180
And now we take the derivative
of the whole thing.

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:34.090
Times minus 7 times something
to the minus 8, and that

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:36.360
something is this inside.

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:40.280
3x to the minus 3
plus x squared.

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.770
And then we multiply this
thing, this whole thing which

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:44.870
is the derivative of the second
term times the first term.

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:53.010
Times, and I'm just going to
keep going, times x squared

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:57.190
plus 2x to the fifth.

00:07:57.190 --> 00:07:59.710
So this is a really, I
mean you might want to

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:00.730
simplify at this point.

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:02.480
You can take this minus
7 and multiply it

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:03.490
out and all of that.

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:05.350
But I think this
gives you the idea.

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:08.850
And if you have to multiply
this out and then do the

00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:10.220
derivative if it's just a
polynomial, this would

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:11.080
take you forever.

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:14.110
But using the chain rule,
you're actually able to, even

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:16.250
though we ended up with a
pretty complicated answer,

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:17.110
we got the right answer.

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:20.230
And now we could actually
evaluate the slope of this very

00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:22.990
complicated function at any
point just by substituting the

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:25.190
point into this fairly
complicated expression.

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:27.830
But at least we could do it.

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:29.970
I think you're going to find
that the chain and the product

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:33.230
rules become even more useful
once we start doing derivatives

00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:35.970
of expressions other
than polynomials.

00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:38.620
I'm going to teach you about
trigonometric functions and

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:42.710
natural log and logarithm
and exponential functions.

00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:44.460
Actually, I'll probably do that
in the next presentation.

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:47.240
So I will see you soon.
