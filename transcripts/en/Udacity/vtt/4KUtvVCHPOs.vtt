00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:01.950
Welcome to Unit Two.

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:03.790
Let's start with a question.

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:05.310
What is a fraction?

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.150
A fraction is just a part over a whole.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.410
A good example might be pizza.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:16.187
Let's say I order a pizza to share
between myself and my three friends,

00:00:16.187 --> 00:00:17.871
Andy, Bob, and Carol.

00:00:17.871 --> 00:00:19.032
So, here's the four of us.

00:00:19.032 --> 00:00:21.510
This is me and Andy, Bob, and Carol.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.490
There are four of us sharing this pizza.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.440
So what is the smallest number of pieces
that we can cut this pizza into so

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.370
that we all share it equally.

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:32.930
Enter your answer here.
