- [Tape Recorder] Welcome
to Synergizing You,

00:00:09.609 --> 00:00:12.178
an eight step program to self--

00:00:13.747 --> 00:00:15.648
Chance, you totally rule.

00:00:15.648 --> 00:00:18.685
Your hair rules,
your jacket rules.

00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:22.355
Theresa's a bitch, no
one can touch you man.

00:00:24.724 --> 00:00:25.992
- Suck it cops!

00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:30.497
- Come on Moses!

00:00:30.497 --> 00:00:31.731 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Just go.
- Come on, he's getting away!

00:00:31.731 --> 00:00:32.766 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Just go, I'll
catch up with you.

00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:34.601
- Seriously?
- Just go.

00:00:38.805 --> 00:00:40.040
Dehydrated.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.508
Leg cramp, cramp.

00:00:41.508 --> 00:00:42.776
Chance, leg out.

00:00:42.776 --> 00:00:43.977
Chance, I need you!

00:00:43.977 --> 00:00:46.212
(gunshots)

00:00:47.814 --> 00:00:48.982 align:start size:84% position:16%
- You know, I
really could've used

00:00:48.982 --> 00:00:50.683
your help back there, Moses.

00:00:50.683 --> 00:00:52.018
- No you did great.

00:00:52.018 --> 00:00:53.520
- You're right I did great.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.288
I jumped off a roof,
tackled him through

00:00:55.288 --> 00:00:57.290
the window of a guest
house, I'd have to say

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:58.558
that's better than great.

00:00:58.558 --> 00:01:00.226
That's pretty frickin'
awesome I'd have to say.

00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:02.162
- It was more like
a garden shed, dude.

00:01:02.162 --> 00:01:03.930
- There was a window
in it, you shut up.

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.332
My point is Moses, what's the
point of having a partner,

00:01:06.332 --> 00:01:08.902
if you're not gonna get my back?

00:01:08.902 --> 00:01:10.670
I mean what if he
had a gun, huh?

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.472 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I didn't have a gun,
I don't have a gun,

00:01:12.472 --> 00:01:14.874 align:start size:88% position:13%
because I traded it
for meth, ya'll, ha ha!

00:01:14.874 --> 00:01:16.876
- Shut your mouth, get in
there, watch your head.

00:01:16.876 --> 00:01:19.012
- Watch your head.

00:01:19.012 --> 00:01:21.381
Hey no offense guys,
if I did have a gun,

00:01:21.381 --> 00:01:22.615
woulda shot ya both.

00:01:22.615 --> 00:01:24.384
- Listen, you have the
right to remain silent,

00:01:24.384 --> 00:01:26.052
I suggest you use it,
we record everything

00:01:26.052 --> 00:01:27.187
that happens back there.

00:01:27.187 --> 00:01:28.788 align:start size:88% position:13%
- I'm just being
honest, for the record.

00:01:28.788 --> 00:01:30.390
Woulda shot ya both
through the teeth.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.258
- For the record,
shut your mouth.

00:01:32.258 --> 00:01:34.027
Moses, I gotta tell
ya this, alright.

00:01:34.027 --> 00:01:35.728
You need to lose weight.

00:01:35.728 --> 00:01:37.864 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Okay, I may have gained
a few extra pounds,

00:01:37.864 --> 00:01:39.466
but I still get the job done.

00:01:39.466 --> 00:01:41.601 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Wait, you literally just
didn't get the job done

00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:42.869
because you are fat.

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.571
- Hey, you were high on meth.

00:01:44.571 --> 00:01:46.639 align:start size:97% position:3%
He was high on meth so he
was probably running faster.

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:47.874
- That's not how it works.

00:01:47.874 --> 00:01:51.244
- I believe that is how
it works, I read a--

00:01:51.244 --> 00:01:52.345
- Well I do meth all the time,

00:01:52.345 --> 00:01:53.813
and that's not how it works.

00:01:53.813 --> 00:01:54.814
- Okay, well what if
you did have a gun,

00:01:54.814 --> 00:01:55.648
what if he had a gun?

00:01:55.648 --> 00:01:57.117
- I didn't have a gun.

00:01:57.117 --> 00:01:58.585 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Well what, hypothetically,
what if he had a gun?

00:01:58.585 --> 00:01:59.619 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Well hypothetically
anything could've happened.

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:00.620
- I could have had a chainsaw.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:01.855
- You didn't even have a gun.

00:02:01.855 --> 00:02:03.089
- Ooh, chainsaw's
pretty easy to get.

00:02:03.089 --> 00:02:04.090
I was just in a shed...

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.225
- Aw, forget about the chainsaw,

00:02:05.225 --> 00:02:06.392
that's not believable enough.

00:02:06.392 --> 00:02:07.460 align:start size:84% position:16%
Let's say you didn't
speak English.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:08.962
- Where ya going with that?

00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:10.430
- Let's say I tackle ya in
the dirt and I got your face

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.165
and I'm rubbing it and I
say "Don't get up, fucker,"

00:02:12.165 --> 00:02:13.433 align:start size:94% position:6%
and you didn't understand
the translation.

00:02:13.433 --> 00:02:14.701
- Okay, yeah yeah, I'm with ya.

00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:15.969
- And what if you
were running away

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:17.203
and you jumped over a
fence, I mean there's

00:02:17.203 --> 00:02:18.738
a lot of fences
in this town now.

00:02:18.738 --> 00:02:20.006
- So hypothetically let's
say my partner needed me,

00:02:20.006 --> 00:02:21.574 align:start size:84% position:16%
because there's a
non-English speaking,

00:02:21.574 --> 00:02:22.909
chainsaw-wielding maniac--

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:24.844
- Wait, wait, do I have
a chainsaw, or a gun?

00:02:24.844 --> 00:02:26.412 align:start size:97% position:3%
- You don't have a chainsaw,
you still have a gun,

00:02:26.412 --> 00:02:27.247
hypothetically.

00:02:27.247 --> 00:02:28.715
- Okay, whatever.

00:02:28.715 --> 00:02:33.019 align:start size:97% position:3%
Hypothetically, let's say your
partner was being, um, uh,

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:34.187
a jag off,
- Ooooh.

00:02:34.187 --> 00:02:36.489 align:start size:84% position:16%
jag off, about a
really sensitive issue

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.491
that you have, and you
couldn't do your job

00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:40.994 align:start size:88% position:13%
because he wasn't being
supportive enough.

00:02:40.994 --> 00:02:43.096
- Bullshit, there's no way you
could run down this asshole!

00:02:43.096 --> 00:02:45.532 align:start size:97% position:3%
- See, that's what I'm talking
about, he's so negative.

00:02:45.532 --> 00:02:47.167
- Yeah, don't call
me an asshole, man,

00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:48.535
I thought we were
on the same page.

00:02:48.535 --> 00:02:49.836
- I thought we were
on the same team.

00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:51.070
- We're on the same team.

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.605 align:start size:84% position:16%
I'm on the same page
with him though.

00:02:52.605 --> 00:02:54.674 align:start size:97% position:3%
- You're right, I haven't been
so supportive lately Moses,

00:02:54.674 --> 00:02:56.876
and I'm gonna change that
right now, you know why?

00:02:56.876 --> 00:02:59.512
Because I believe in you.

00:02:59.512 --> 00:03:00.380
- That's weird, stop it.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:01.614
- No it's not weird.

00:03:01.614 --> 00:03:03.917
I believe in you, I
believe you can catch

00:03:03.917 --> 00:03:06.586
this asshole, jag
off, meth head.

00:03:06.586 --> 00:03:08.421 align:start size:81% position:19%
- I can.
- I know you can.

00:03:08.421 --> 00:03:09.756
- You know I can.

00:03:09.756 --> 00:03:10.790 align:start size:97% position:3%
You know I can.
- I know you can catch him,

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.025
I know you can catch him,

00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:13.226
I think you should go
catch him right now.

00:03:13.226 --> 00:03:15.161
You believe you can run
down this meth head?

00:03:15.161 --> 00:03:16.462
Then run down this meth head,

00:03:16.462 --> 00:03:17.864
he's gonna run your butt down,

00:03:17.864 --> 00:03:19.132
he's gonna run your butt down,

00:03:19.132 --> 00:03:21.367
let's do this, come
on Moses, here we go.

00:03:21.367 --> 00:03:22.936
[Meth Head] Wait
what are we doing?

00:03:22.936 --> 00:03:25.605 align:start size:84% position:16%
No, let's not.
- Come on, get out.

00:03:25.605 --> 00:03:27.207
Come on, out ya go.

00:03:31.177 --> 00:03:32.412
Okay Moses, are you ready?

00:03:32.412 --> 00:03:33.780
- Yeah, are you ready
to be totally wrong?

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.215
- Okay, go.

00:03:35.215 --> 00:03:36.616 align:start position:0%
- Well wait, you guys said
you're recording all this right,

00:03:36.616 --> 00:03:37.850 align:start size:84% position:16%
because if I'm
gonna get a beating

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.053
I at least wanna have it
on my YouTube channel.

00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:41.154
- Seriously dude?

00:03:41.154 --> 00:03:42.822
Get the fuck out of here.

00:03:42.822 --> 00:03:46.025
- Three, two, one, got his ass!

00:03:46.025 --> 00:03:47.794
- Go Moses!

00:03:47.794 --> 00:03:49.295
Run, little trooper!

00:03:49.295 --> 00:03:52.031 align:start size:81% position:19%
Run like an eagle,
come on Moses!

00:03:53.633 --> 00:03:54.467
Moses?

00:03:59.472 --> 00:04:01.307
Come on man, seriously?

00:04:02.442 --> 00:04:04.544
(puking)

00:04:07.714 --> 00:04:10.383
(Moses sobbing)
