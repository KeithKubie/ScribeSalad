rights etc and as I looked at these
 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.469

solutions even climate change I found

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150
solutions even climate change I found
 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.270
solutions even climate change I found
that to solve them would take probably

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280
that to solve them would take probably
 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.480
that to solve them would take probably
only a trillion dollars a year which is

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490
only a trillion dollars a year which is
 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.910
only a trillion dollars a year which is
roughly three percent of world gdp and

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920
roughly three percent of world gdp and
 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.760
roughly three percent of world gdp and
therefore affordable and a small number

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770
therefore affordable and a small number
 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.010
therefore affordable and a small number
compared to the huge cost of not solving

other hand I found that these were
 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.340

30 40 50 years to solve them they had to

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659
30 40 50 years to solve them they had to
 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.050
30 40 50 years to solve them they had to
be solved yesterday or in five years ten

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060
be solved yesterday or in five years ten
 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.600
be solved yesterday or in five years ten
years maximum 20 years so there is a one

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610
years maximum 20 years so there is a one
 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.460
years maximum 20 years so there is a one
time window to solve them before they

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470
time window to solve them before they
 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.440
time window to solve them before they
get out of hand particularly the

get out of hand particularly the
 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.479
get out of hand particularly the
environmental issues of the first group

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489
environmental issues of the first group
 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:17.720
environmental issues of the first group
and the first thing I found is that none

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730
and the first thing I found is that none
 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.140
and the first thing I found is that none
of them with the exception of ozone

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150
of them with the exception of ozone
 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.430
of them with the exception of ozone
which is the exception that proves the

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440
which is the exception that proves the
 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.059
which is the exception that proves the
rule none of these 20 issues were

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069
rule none of these 20 issues were
 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:27.140
rule none of these 20 issues were
seriously being solved by the

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150
seriously being solved by the
 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:34.400
seriously being solved by the
international system I asked myself why

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410
international system I asked myself why
 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.430
international system I asked myself why
is that and I took the international

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440
is that and I took the international
 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.820
is that and I took the international
system apart into four pieces the first

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830
system apart into four pieces the first
 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.460
system apart into four pieces the first
piece is treaties and conventions which

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470
piece is treaties and conventions which
 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.949
piece is treaties and conventions which
is the normal way in which nation states

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959
is the normal way in which nation states
 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.009
is the normal way in which nation states
get together to solve global issues and

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019
get together to solve global issues and
 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:52.059
get together to solve global issues and
that is a very slow world and a very

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069
that is a very slow world and a very
 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:55.160
that is a very slow world and a very
ritualistic world and a very minimalist

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170
ritualistic world and a very minimalist
 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.160
ritualistic world and a very minimalist
world to give you an example there are

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170
world to give you an example there are
 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.280
world to give you an example there are
some 250 treaties in the environmental

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290
some 250 treaties in the environmental
 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.430
some 250 treaties in the environmental
area alone that have been put in motion

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440
area alone that have been put in motion
 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.770
area alone that have been put in motion
since the 60s and yet there's been no

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780
since the 60s and yet there's been no
 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.890
since the 60s and yet there's been no
progress on any front in the environment

progress on any front in the environment
 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.259
progress on any front in the environment
whatsoever and that is because treaties

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269
whatsoever and that is because treaties
 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:15.170
whatsoever and that is because treaties
are either very small like Kyoto Kyoto

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180
are either very small like Kyoto Kyoto
 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.110
are either very small like Kyoto Kyoto
is a tiny tiny fraction of what we ought

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120
is a tiny tiny fraction of what we ought
 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.420
is a tiny tiny fraction of what we ought
to be doing to stabilize carbon dioxide

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430
to be doing to stabilize carbon dioxide

concentrations all the treaties are not

concentrations all the treaties are not
 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.899
concentrations all the treaties are not
so small but they have a problem because

00:03:29.899 --> 00:03:29.909
so small but they have a problem because
 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:31.670
so small but they have a problem because
many important countries are missing in

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680
many important countries are missing in
 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.190
many important countries are missing in
them for instance the fisheries treaty

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200
them for instance the fisheries treaty
 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.430
them for instance the fisheries treaty
of december 2001 looks ok but then 15 of

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440
of december 2001 looks ok but then 15 of
 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.410
of december 2001 looks ok but then 15 of
the top 20 fishing nations are not in it

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420
the top 20 fishing nations are not in it
 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.020
the top 20 fishing nations are not in it
or you have a treaty that looks all

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030
or you have a treaty that looks all
 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.199
or you have a treaty that looks all
right but it has no enforcement powers

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209
right but it has no enforcement powers
 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:47.149
right but it has no enforcement powers
so the treaty system itself doesn't

00:03:47.149 --> 00:03:47.159
so the treaty system itself doesn't
 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:50.059
so the treaty system itself doesn't
produce the solutions to these big

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069
produce the solutions to these big
 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:53.089
produce the solutions to these big
global issues the second part are the

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:53.099
global issues the second part are the
 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:56.929
global issues the second part are the
big un summits which are not very good

big un summits which are not very good
 

00:03:56.939 --> 00:03:59.600
big un summits which are not very good
at coming out with crisp solutions to

at coming out with crisp solutions to
 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.789
at coming out with crisp solutions to
issues like global warming or drug

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799
issues like global warming or drug
 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:04.009
issues like global warming or drug
trading etc they're just good at

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019
trading etc they're just good at
 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:06.530
trading etc they're just good at
elevating awareness for a few weeks but

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540
elevating awareness for a few weeks but
 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.320
elevating awareness for a few weeks but
they're too shallow to be good at deep

they're too shallow to be good at deep
 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.500
they're too shallow to be good at deep
down problem solving the same goes for

down problem solving the same goes for
 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:13.580
down problem solving the same goes for
the third part of the international

the third part of the international
 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.249
the third part of the international
system which is groupings like the g8 or

government but they're very shallow is
 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.730
government but they're very shallow is
well they're much more interested in in
