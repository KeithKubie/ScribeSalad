  - Hi, I'm Ismael, I'm 29,
  I'm a penetration tester.

00:00:03.636 --> 00:00:06.139
- Whoa, I want to ask
you what pisses you off

00:00:06.172 --> 00:00:08.941
but I gotta know, what
is a penetration tester?

00:00:08.974 --> 00:00:11.444 align:start position:0%
 - I'm a professional hacker
 and criminal, basically.

00:00:11.477 --> 00:00:14.213
- A criminal, do you not
know how cameras work?

00:00:14.246 --> 00:00:15.982 size:88% position:44%
  - (clicks)

00:00:16.015 --> 00:00:19.318
 - (laughs) This is not the
 dark web, this is real life,

00:00:19.351 --> 00:00:21.020
 the camera is on you.

00:00:21.053 --> 00:00:22.855
 - Eh, the government pays me.

00:00:22.888 --> 00:00:25.158 size:88% position:44%
  Since you're a hacker, you
  know, you go deeper online

00:00:25.191 --> 00:00:27.493 size:88% position:44%
 than any of us, what is it
 online that pisses you off?

00:00:27.526 --> 00:00:28.928
The phrase "life hacks."

00:00:28.961 --> 00:00:31.164 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Aha, because it
disrespects what you do.

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:33.466
 - Yeah, I mean cutting an
 apple in half is not a hack,

00:00:33.499 --> 00:00:34.767 size:88% position:44%
 it's a thing people
 have done, right?

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.702
 - Right, cutting an
 apple is not a hack,

00:00:36.735 --> 00:00:38.104 align:start size:88% position:13%
 it disrespects
 what I do, which is

00:00:38.137 --> 00:00:40.506
robbing a family of all
their livelihood online.

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:42.275
 - Ah, no, they don't
 have enough money,

00:00:42.308 --> 00:00:44.444 size:88% position:44%
 I'm going after the
 biggies (laughs).

00:00:44.477 --> 00:00:46.079 align:start position:0%
  When a person is
  life-hacker, you're like,

00:00:46.112 --> 00:00:49.449 size:88% position:44%
  "Fuck off, poseur, I mean,
  I robbed Merrill Lynch."

00:00:49.482 --> 00:00:50.683
 - I did not.

00:00:50.716 --> 00:00:52.652 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - Oh yeah, he did not
 rob Merrill Lynch.

00:00:52.685 --> 00:00:54.787 align:start position:0%
Can you tell me what
government agency you work for?

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.122
- Nooo.

00:00:56.155 --> 00:01:00.093 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Whoa, Ismael is a
straight up, degenerate,

00:01:00.126 --> 00:01:03.029 align:start position:0%
 illegitimate hacker
 working for the government.

00:01:03.062 --> 00:01:04.831 align:start size:88% position:13%
 He got Jeff Sessions
 all over him.

00:01:04.864 --> 00:01:06.466 size:88% position:44%
 - That guy's weird.

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:09.235 align:start position:0%
- You think you could hack into
my stuff and take my money?

00:01:09.268 --> 00:01:10.269
 - Yes.

00:01:10.302 --> 00:01:11.604 size:84% position:42%
  - I don't have that much.

00:01:11.637 --> 00:01:12.738 size:88% position:44%
  - But you're cute.

00:01:12.771 --> 00:01:14.340 size:88% position:44%
 - I'm cute, Ismael.
