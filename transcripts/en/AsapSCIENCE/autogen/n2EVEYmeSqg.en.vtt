00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:06.080
 Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common psychiatric illnesses 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.610
 Between children and adolescents. But what happens inside minds and bodies 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.800
 Can it be considered an advantage? 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.150
 While some external factors such as drinking alcohol and smoking may affect pregnancy 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:24.589
 On brain development, hyperactivity is closely related to your genes. And more 

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:29.339
 These genes are directly related to the pathways of brain satisfaction. It turned out later 

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:34.879
 That those with attention deficit and hyperactivity have low levels of dopamine receptors (and dopamine is the hormone responsible for 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:39.510
 Satisfaction and happiness). This means they are less likely to feel rewarded, so they are more likely to be bored 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.339
 Or they are not affected by things that usually delight others. 

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:48.309
 We also observe clear differences when considering MRI scans of the brains of the injured. The brain usually appears to be in a state of stillness 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:52.850
 In the normal case area, and quickly changes to the active task area 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.320
 In case you need attention. But the brains of people with attention deficit and hyperactivity fail 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.640
 In automatic switching between the two regions, which means both areas remain active 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:09.280
 This results in a decrease in their ability to concentrate. Scientists also noted lightness in the frontal cortex of the brain in patients with the disease, 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.420
 He is responsible for controlling attention, regulating emotions and discouraging response. 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.280
 As a result of these differences, Ritalin is usually given to patients who are infected; 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.810
 The concentration of dopamine in neural connections increases the likelihood of its association with the few receptors 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.909
 However, there are conflicting studies on its effectiveness and concerns 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:34.579
 Of long-term side effects. Of course, many people without attention deficit and hyperactivity were known 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:39.930
 Abuse of medication as a means of increasing concentration during work or study, to study more efficiently 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.520
 Perhaps the most controversial is the dramatic rise in the diagnosis of the disease over the years. 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:51.229
 Whether justified or not, there is a registered increase of 5% every year from 2003-2011 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:56.829
 in the United States. The same pattern was followed in describing treatments with some reports showing 

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:02.359
 The increase in the disbursement of medicines by 35% between 2008 and 2012. 

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:07.890
 It later emerged that there may be a developed advantage for patients with attention deficit and hyperactivity. 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.290
 For fishermen in nomadic or migratory communities, being active and moving, this makes 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.150
 The chances of success of their hunting and returning home to food are stronger and greater, and increase caution and vigilance 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.010
 To protect their children. This means greater survival and survival opportunities for passing genes across generations 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.340
 A current study of Bedouin and urban individuals from the Arial tribe in Kenya is shown 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.610
 The Bedouin who have a greater frequency of genes associated with attention deficit and hyperactivity are better at getting food 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.330
 Moreover. Studies routinely show that patients have a greater sense of creativity 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.390
 Both in controlled tests and in real life, where they usually think randomly and out of the box 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.080
 Finally, the structure of the study environment is tight and unable to deal with the affected children 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:51.220
 With hypotension and hyperactivity, many adults thrive in appropriate work environments. Studies show 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.230
 That if their explosive energies were directed to the right professions, especially those that needed a high degree of skill 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.870
 And adaptation, those who are considered to be in need will become strong supporters. 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.780

 On audible.com/asap This week we wanted to nominate 'The ADHD Advantage' by Dale Archer 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.600
 As it highlights the most successful entrepreneurs, leaders, and artists 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:22.260
 They derived their strength from their illness. You can get a free 30-day period at audible.com/asap 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.350
 And choose from our big group! We love it because it's great when you review it. 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.340
 And participated in the channel for more scientific sections weekly.
