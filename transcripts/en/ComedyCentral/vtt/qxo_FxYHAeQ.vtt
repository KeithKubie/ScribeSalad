00:00:00.855 --> 00:00:03.879
- Can you picture, like a
really religious Jewish wigger?

00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:06.526
Like can you imagine what that looks like,

00:00:06.526 --> 00:00:09.346
just like black accent, but
also like playing a fiddle

00:00:09.346 --> 00:00:10.179
or whatever.

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:11.350
(audience laughing)

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:14.193
(hip hop music)

00:00:14.193 --> 00:00:16.749
(crashing)

00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:19.416
(hip hop music)

00:00:24.046 --> 00:00:26.379
(crunching)

00:00:28.612 --> 00:00:30.239
- Welcome to This is
Not Happening Presents

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:31.515
World of Blunder.

00:00:31.515 --> 00:00:32.776
If you've never been to the show before,

00:00:32.776 --> 00:00:34.984
it's just a bunch of
comics telling fun stories

00:00:34.984 --> 00:00:36.356
about real shit that happened.

00:00:36.356 --> 00:00:38.509
Ladies and gentlemen, my friend and yours,

00:00:38.509 --> 00:00:40.127
Mr. Moshe Kasher everybody.

00:00:40.127 --> 00:00:43.470
(audience applauding)

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:44.433
- Thank you everybody.

00:00:44.433 --> 00:00:45.516
Hi everybody.

00:00:48.162 --> 00:00:50.916
So I am a Jew, I'm a Jew.

00:00:50.916 --> 00:00:52.135
- [Audience Member] Yeah!

00:00:52.135 --> 00:00:53.684
- Makes that guy in particular very upset.

00:00:53.684 --> 00:00:57.338
Literally what the Nazis
were thinking about.

00:00:57.338 --> 00:00:59.938
(audience laughing)

00:00:59.938 --> 00:01:01.114
I couldn't be--

00:01:01.114 --> 00:01:02.523
please, not like this.

00:01:02.523 --> 00:01:03.616
(audience laughing)

00:01:03.616 --> 00:01:04.918
Just come from back here.

00:01:04.918 --> 00:01:07.537
I'm a Jew, and that pisses
some people off sometimes.

00:01:07.537 --> 00:01:09.281
So, look, listen.

00:01:09.281 --> 00:01:13.448
People sometimes can't separate
the Jew from the Israel.

00:01:14.315 --> 00:01:16.452
And like, I get it on a
certain level you know,

00:01:16.452 --> 00:01:19.689
Israel's a strange place and
it's got some strange policies.

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:21.834
There's problems in Israel way beyond

00:01:21.834 --> 00:01:23.562
the Palestinian conflict.

00:01:23.562 --> 00:01:25.610
There's problems because
everyone else in Israel

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.502
is a fucking Jew, can
you imagine what that

00:01:27.502 --> 00:01:29.783
society seems like?

00:01:29.783 --> 00:01:32.459
Just, I mean, okay, I'll
give you an example.

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:34.312
I went to Israel to do comedy.

00:01:34.312 --> 00:01:36.507
And there's a comedy
club in Jerusalem called

00:01:36.507 --> 00:01:38.545
the Off the Wall Comedy Club.

00:01:38.545 --> 00:01:39.934
Get it?

00:01:39.934 --> 00:01:41.455
Cause there's like a big
wall there or whatever.

00:01:41.455 --> 00:01:43.377
(audience laughing)

00:01:43.377 --> 00:01:45.077
And I went and here's the thing

00:01:45.077 --> 00:01:46.927
about the Off the Wall Comedy Club.

00:01:46.927 --> 00:01:49.077
It's run by a guy named David Klimnick

00:01:49.077 --> 00:01:51.561
who is the self-styled
king of English-speaking

00:01:51.561 --> 00:01:53.576
stand-up comedy in Jerusalem,

00:01:53.576 --> 00:01:56.975
which to be fair is an
incredibly small kingdom.

00:01:56.975 --> 00:01:57.923
(audience laughing)

00:01:57.923 --> 00:01:59.575
It's a very tiny little kingdom,

00:01:59.575 --> 00:02:03.947
and mostly his clientele
is like, American students

00:02:03.947 --> 00:02:07.452
who went to Israel, their
parents sent them to seminary

00:02:07.452 --> 00:02:09.265
to like get their shit together,

00:02:09.265 --> 00:02:13.095
cause they were into drugs but
also they're super religious.

00:02:13.095 --> 00:02:16.945
Can you picture like a really
religious Jewish wigger?

00:02:16.945 --> 00:02:19.173
Like can you imagine what that looks like?

00:02:19.173 --> 00:02:20.176
(audience laughing)

00:02:20.176 --> 00:02:22.416
Just like, black accent
but also playing a fiddle

00:02:22.416 --> 00:02:23.430
or whatever.

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:24.728
(audience laughing)

00:02:24.728 --> 00:02:26.722
So that's their main clientele

00:02:26.722 --> 00:02:28.965
at the Off the Wall
Comedy Club or whatever.

00:02:28.965 --> 00:02:31.252
And his rule is, because it's
all these religious people,

00:02:31.252 --> 00:02:33.007
is you can't swear at all.

00:02:33.007 --> 00:02:34.125
No swearing.

00:02:34.125 --> 00:02:36.082
And you can't do anything dirty.

00:02:36.082 --> 00:02:37.626
You gotta be super squeaky clean.

00:02:37.626 --> 00:02:39.684
So okay, at the time, my closer,

00:02:39.684 --> 00:02:40.938
I had one closer,

00:02:40.938 --> 00:02:45.430
and you need a closer as a
comedian, and my closer was this,

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.885
it was actually also a travel story.

00:02:47.885 --> 00:02:49.702
It was a story about
when I went to France.

00:02:49.702 --> 00:02:51.610
I went to France, and it goes like this.

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.156
I only knew two phrases in
the entire French language.

00:02:54.156 --> 00:02:56.714
The truth is I knew one
phrase, but I thought,

00:02:56.714 --> 00:02:58.372
at the time, that I knew two.

00:02:58.372 --> 00:03:01.643
Like the one I had down pat
was "Parlez-vous Anglais?"

00:03:01.643 --> 00:03:03.711
That's super important that means,

00:03:03.711 --> 00:03:04.833
"You speak English?"

00:03:04.833 --> 00:03:06.238
Which is how you should say it if you ever

00:03:06.238 --> 00:03:07.424
have a chance to go to France,

00:03:07.424 --> 00:03:08.696
it makes them feel very
loved and respected

00:03:08.696 --> 00:03:10.178
if you talk to em like that.

00:03:10.178 --> 00:03:11.336
"Hey, you speak English?

00:03:11.336 --> 00:03:12.446
"Hey!"

00:03:12.446 --> 00:03:13.817
They like it.

00:03:13.817 --> 00:03:15.750
But the other phrase I thought I knew,

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.563
but it turns out I
didn't know so well was,

00:03:17.563 --> 00:03:19.991
"Oh, no parlez-vous Francais."

00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:22.500
Which I thought meant, "Oh,
um, I don't speak French."

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.266
But that actually means, "Oh,
uh, you don't speak French."

00:03:26.266 --> 00:03:27.672
(audience laughing)

00:03:27.672 --> 00:03:31.619
And the French were like
super not into that at all.

00:03:31.619 --> 00:03:35.053
Be in a store like, "Jacques,
how much for this baguette,

00:03:35.053 --> 00:03:37.012
"brie beret thing you got over here?"

00:03:37.012 --> 00:03:40.139
(nonsense noises)

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:41.247
(audience laughing)

00:03:41.247 --> 00:03:42.956
You don't speak French.

00:03:42.956 --> 00:03:45.956
(audience laughing)

00:03:48.722 --> 00:03:50.950
"Excusez-moi Monsieur, parlez Francais."

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.296
(nonsense noises)

00:03:53.296 --> 00:03:56.546
Okay, WTF dude, you don't speak French.

00:03:58.787 --> 00:04:00.435
Fucking cut that shit out!

00:04:00.435 --> 00:04:02.458
"Sacre-bleu Monsieur, parlez Francais."

00:04:02.458 --> 00:04:06.268
You don't speak French, you French faggot!

00:04:06.268 --> 00:04:09.268
(audience laughing)

00:04:10.347 --> 00:04:12.108
But then I had to ask myself,

00:04:12.108 --> 00:04:15.608
Dude, why are you so angry and homophobic?

00:04:18.738 --> 00:04:20.379
You can't talk to people like that, man,

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:22.891
you can't call people faggot in France.

00:04:22.891 --> 00:04:25.003
It's pronounced fag-ette.

00:04:25.003 --> 00:04:26.438
(audience laughing)

00:04:26.438 --> 00:04:27.899
Alright, so that's the joke okay?

00:04:27.899 --> 00:04:29.225
That was my big closer at the time,

00:04:29.225 --> 00:04:30.983
but I couldn't tell it because
it's got that big f-bomb

00:04:30.983 --> 00:04:33.819
at the end of it, so I
had to think of a clean

00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:35.010
version of the joke.

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.554
So I came up with this,
which I was pretty proud of.

00:04:37.554 --> 00:04:39.579
I came up with, "You don't speak French,

00:04:39.579 --> 00:04:41.385
"you French piece of crap."

00:04:41.385 --> 00:04:43.362
But you can't say that, man.

00:04:43.362 --> 00:04:45.432
You can't call people
piece of crap in France.

00:04:45.432 --> 00:04:47.349
It's pronounced, crepe.

00:04:48.347 --> 00:04:49.381
(audience laughing)

00:04:49.381 --> 00:04:50.344
Which okay, it's a little softer,

00:04:50.344 --> 00:04:51.978
but fuck you for the judgment.

00:04:51.978 --> 00:04:53.837
(audience laughing)

00:04:53.837 --> 00:04:55.021
I was pretty proud of it.

00:04:55.021 --> 00:04:56.964
It's a bread to bread conversion,

00:04:56.964 --> 00:05:00.418
they're both carb based punchlines.

00:05:00.418 --> 00:05:01.882
Do you understand how sophisticated

00:05:01.882 --> 00:05:03.779
a substitution that is?

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:05.245
I was super proud of it.

00:05:05.245 --> 00:05:08.731
So I get out onstage at the
Off the Wall Comedy Club,

00:05:08.731 --> 00:05:11.307
you piece of crap, crepe, they laugh.

00:05:11.307 --> 00:05:13.489
David Klimnick comes up
to me after the show,

00:05:13.489 --> 00:05:15.362
people love it, you
know, I'm doing so well.

00:05:15.362 --> 00:05:17.133
People are throwing their
yarmulkes in the air,

00:05:17.133 --> 00:05:18.206
like everybody,

00:05:18.206 --> 00:05:19.303
(audience laughing)

00:05:19.303 --> 00:05:20.540
they're super into it.

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:22.080
Klimnick comes up to me after the show,

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.063
I was like, "What do you think, Buddy?"

00:05:23.063 --> 00:05:24.361
He's like, "Yeah, it
was good, it was good.

00:05:24.361 --> 00:05:27.322
"You can't say crap at my club."

00:05:27.322 --> 00:05:28.322
I go, "Crap?

00:05:29.224 --> 00:05:30.853
"You should have heard
the original punchline,

00:05:30.853 --> 00:05:31.967
"it was faggot!"

00:05:31.967 --> 00:05:35.108
And he goes, "Oh, no, no,
faggot's okay, faggot's okay."

00:05:35.108 --> 00:05:38.108
(audience laughing)

00:05:39.801 --> 00:05:41.865
I don't know, somewhere in
his weird religious mind,

00:05:41.865 --> 00:05:43.032
that was okay.

00:05:44.085 --> 00:05:46.110
So that's a thing about
Israel that has nothing to do

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:47.830
with the conflict, but
sometimes people can't help

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.976
but conflate Israel and the conflict.

00:05:49.976 --> 00:05:51.314
And I understand, but also, I'm not,

00:05:51.314 --> 00:05:54.221
okay, I went to Australia after that trip.

00:05:54.221 --> 00:05:55.652
I went to Australia to do comedy.

00:05:55.652 --> 00:05:58.263
I get off, the pick us up at the airport,

00:05:58.263 --> 00:06:00.508
and it's me and Hannibal Burress,

00:06:00.508 --> 00:06:02.410
who's a black comedian,
that's important only

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:04.019
for the punchline of this story.

00:06:04.019 --> 00:06:06.272
Which is, that the woman picks us up,

00:06:06.272 --> 00:06:08.845
and she's like, "Oh, blah."

00:06:08.845 --> 00:06:09.930
I don't do voices.

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:10.918
(audience laughing)

00:06:10.918 --> 00:06:13.591
But she's like, "Eh, g'day" or whatever.

00:06:13.591 --> 00:06:14.551
(audience laughing)

00:06:14.551 --> 00:06:17.136
And we're, me and Hannibal are like,

00:06:17.136 --> 00:06:18.252
"What's up with eating kangaroos,

00:06:18.252 --> 00:06:20.865
"that's what we're about, we're Americans,

00:06:20.865 --> 00:06:22.096
"we want to know about eating kangaroos,

00:06:22.096 --> 00:06:23.283
"that's all we need to know about."

00:06:23.283 --> 00:06:24.631
And she's like, "Oh it's great, mate.

00:06:24.631 --> 00:06:28.798
"You know, eat it, because
kangaroo is lean protein,

00:06:30.749 --> 00:06:32.746
"and also it's good for the environment

00:06:32.746 --> 00:06:34.315
"to eat the kangaroo
because we've wiped out

00:06:34.315 --> 00:06:35.572
"their natural predators."

00:06:35.572 --> 00:06:36.780
And me and Hannibal were like,

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:38.179
"Oh, really what's that?"

00:06:38.179 --> 00:06:40.957
She's like, "the Aborigines."

00:06:40.957 --> 00:06:45.195
(audience laughing and booing)

00:06:45.195 --> 00:06:47.528
- Oh, the human being group?

00:06:48.948 --> 00:06:50.909
The human-ass beings?

00:06:50.909 --> 00:06:53.447
Okay, yes, okay, fair enough.

00:06:53.447 --> 00:06:57.614
So I go do my shows, and I
do a lot of Jew references

00:06:58.734 --> 00:07:00.839
and this dude comes up to
me after one of the shows,

00:07:00.839 --> 00:07:05.360
and he's like, kind of like
a little hip-hop fella,

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.858
but Australian, you know
what I mean, so kinda like,

00:07:06.858 --> 00:07:08.802
"Get out of here, you don't
know what you're talking about."

00:07:08.802 --> 00:07:10.676
(audience laughing)

00:07:10.676 --> 00:07:13.044
And he's like, he walks
right up, and he's like,

00:07:13.044 --> 00:07:14.950
"So you're Jewish, huh?"

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:17.385
Which is already the
end of the conversation.

00:07:17.385 --> 00:07:19.965
Like when somebody approaches you with,

00:07:19.965 --> 00:07:22.466
"So you're Jewish, huh?" you're done.

00:07:22.466 --> 00:07:23.677
Either, there's two options.

00:07:23.677 --> 00:07:26.433
He's really into Jews, in which case,

00:07:26.433 --> 00:07:27.704
fucking why?

00:07:27.704 --> 00:07:29.154
(audience laughing)

00:07:29.154 --> 00:07:32.769
Or he's like really not into
Jews, which is what happened

00:07:32.769 --> 00:07:35.082
and is not a person that
I wanna have a chat with.

00:07:35.082 --> 00:07:37.656
And he's like, "Yeah, yeah,
you're all into Judaism,

00:07:37.656 --> 00:07:39.909
"you were like big-upping
it during your set."

00:07:39.909 --> 00:07:41.411
I go, "Big-upping it?

00:07:41.411 --> 00:07:42.554
(audience laughing)

00:07:42.554 --> 00:07:44.769
"Like as in reggae, is that
what you're talking about?"

00:07:44.769 --> 00:07:47.430
And he just keeps going, and I'm like,

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:48.492
"Dude, I don't want to talk to you."

00:07:48.492 --> 00:07:50.529
Finally he breaks, "What about Israel?"

00:07:50.529 --> 00:07:52.308
"And the policies with the Palestinians?"

00:07:52.308 --> 00:07:54.402
I'm like, "Buddy, they
never check in with me

00:07:54.402 --> 00:07:55.964
"about those at all."

00:07:55.964 --> 00:07:57.356
(audience laughing)

00:07:57.356 --> 00:07:59.788
"They almost never, I would
go a different direction

00:07:59.788 --> 00:08:02.210
"but they have not called yet."

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:03.290
(audience laughing)

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:04.384
And he just keeps yelling at me,

00:08:04.384 --> 00:08:05.935
and I'm just, of course, he's Australian,

00:08:05.935 --> 00:08:07.362
so mentally I'm far beyond him,

00:08:07.362 --> 00:08:08.377
(audience laughing)

00:08:08.377 --> 00:08:11.111
so I'm going, I'm able
to win the argument.

00:08:11.111 --> 00:08:12.089
Finally he just screams,

00:08:12.089 --> 00:08:13.262
"I hope there's a second Holocaust

00:08:13.262 --> 00:08:15.643
"and they kill all of
you, you greedy bastards!"

00:08:15.643 --> 00:08:17.897
At which case I feel like
I've won the argument,

00:08:17.897 --> 00:08:19.934
I'm not sure, but I feel strongly

00:08:19.934 --> 00:08:21.552
when someone screams
for a second Holocaust

00:08:21.552 --> 00:08:23.418
the Jew has won.

00:08:23.418 --> 00:08:25.260
(audience laughing)

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.468
He leaves, he storms off,
his girlfriend's like,

00:08:27.468 --> 00:08:28.525
"I'm so sorry."

00:08:28.525 --> 00:08:30.665
And I say something like,
"This is how I'll always

00:08:30.665 --> 00:08:32.228
"remember Australia" or whatever.

00:08:32.228 --> 00:08:33.204
(audience laughing)

00:08:33.204 --> 00:08:35.376
Like she's gonna take
that to her dusty grave

00:08:35.376 --> 00:08:36.572
with her or whatever.

00:08:36.572 --> 00:08:37.545
(audience laughing)

00:08:37.545 --> 00:08:38.495
In the outback.

00:08:38.495 --> 00:08:39.461
(audience laughing)

00:08:39.461 --> 00:08:42.165
So the next day, I come to the club,

00:08:42.165 --> 00:08:43.437
and the manager pulls me aside,

00:08:43.437 --> 00:08:44.860
the manager of the club.

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:46.974
And he's like, "Dude, I
got a story to tell you.

00:08:46.974 --> 00:08:49.578
"We got a phone call
today from a young man

00:08:49.578 --> 00:08:53.299
"who said that he lost his
wallet in the club last night

00:08:53.299 --> 00:08:55.338
"and he wanted to come down
to see if he could find it.

00:08:55.338 --> 00:08:59.088
"He comes down, it's the
fucking guy, it's little Hitler,

00:08:59.088 --> 00:09:00.324
"it's the guy!"

00:09:00.324 --> 00:09:01.279
(audience laughing)

00:09:01.279 --> 00:09:03.098
It's little hip hop Australian Hitler,

00:09:03.098 --> 00:09:06.703
he comes to the club, he's
searching, he's searching,

00:09:06.703 --> 00:09:09.458
Goes up to the manager and
says, "Dude, I can't find it."

00:09:09.458 --> 00:09:12.843
And the manager starts laughing at him.

00:09:12.843 --> 00:09:15.295
And the guy goes, "Why
are you laughing at me?"

00:09:15.295 --> 00:09:17.629
And he just smiles and
goes, "Karma's a bitch."

00:09:17.629 --> 00:09:21.433
So I say, "Give me his email address."

00:09:21.433 --> 00:09:23.775
Cause he left his email
address in case they found it,

00:09:23.775 --> 00:09:26.103
and I wrote him an email that said,

00:09:26.103 --> 00:09:28.554
"My dear sir, if there's anyone,"

00:09:28.554 --> 00:09:31.835
there was $400 in the wallet,
that's why he was so upset.

00:09:31.835 --> 00:09:34.103
I write, "My dear sir, if there's anyone

00:09:34.103 --> 00:09:38.361
"who so truly acutely
understands the deep loss

00:09:38.361 --> 00:09:42.528
"you must feel from losing
$400, it is me, the Jew."

00:09:43.799 --> 00:09:46.397
(audience laughing)

00:09:46.397 --> 00:09:47.377
Thank you guys a lot!

00:09:47.377 --> 00:09:48.340
(audience applauding)

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:51.007
(hip hop music)

00:09:53.239 --> 00:09:54.824
- Moshe Kasher everybody!

00:09:54.824 --> 00:09:56.108
Moshe Kasher!

00:09:56.108 --> 00:09:58.099
That's the story, thanks
Mosh for doing it,

00:09:58.099 --> 00:09:59.052
that was really cool.

00:09:59.052 --> 00:10:02.904
So last week I asked you
to post your best DJ names,

00:10:02.904 --> 00:10:04.620
from Braunohler's story.

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:06.942
And you did, and here's
some cool ones that I saw.

00:10:06.942 --> 00:10:08.300
Next week, I'm gonna ask you,

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:10.462
because Moshe wasn't
allowed to use the words

00:10:10.462 --> 00:10:11.881
fuck and shit, I want you
guys to give me the best

00:10:11.881 --> 00:10:15.685
non-curse words curse words,
or even new curse words

00:10:15.685 --> 00:10:18.107
that I don't even know about.

00:10:18.107 --> 00:10:19.529
Say what they mean, say
where they come from.

00:10:19.529 --> 00:10:20.883
And I'll read em all, and
I'll post the best ones

00:10:20.883 --> 00:10:22.938
