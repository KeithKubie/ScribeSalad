[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:16.230
ALI AFSHAR: Hi, everyone.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.510
Welcome to Google
Developers Live.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.710
We're going to be talking today
about the Google Drive

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.410
SDK and specifically how you can
use various parts of the

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.690
Google Drive user interface
to drive users to your

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:33.040
application and to make your
application more useful.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.950
So when we set about writing the
Google Drive SDK, our main

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.970
goal was to allow you, the
developer, to be able to write

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:46.680
applications that are as good
and as fully-featured as the

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.750
Google Docs applications.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.640
That's Google Docs spreadsheets
presentations.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.460
That's what we're
aiming to do.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.560
So one of the steps we recently
made was a huge step

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.990
towards this, and it's
the Create menu.

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.880
And I don't know if you've seen
on Google Drive, there's

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.860
a Create menu, and you click
it to create new documents.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.440
Well, we've added the ability
for your applications to

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:10.140
appear there.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.410
And I'm joined today with
Greg, who's going to go

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.230
through this and show us
some of the things.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.300
So Greg, if we could look at
Google Drive and look at the

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.250
Create menu.

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.160
GREG KNOKE: Yes, if we can
go to my computer.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.810
OK.

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.260
So here you'll see the
Create button.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.630
So if you click on the Create
button, on the left you have

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.110
the original Google
Drive docks types.

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.140
And you can see here I've
already got one app installed,

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.790
Lucidchart, which is a really
fantastic diagramming tool.

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.610
So if we click on Lucidchart,
you'll see that we

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.210
go to the app page.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.450
And while we wait
for it to load--

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:48.220
here we are.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.770
So it's loading.

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.130
You can see we've got
Lucidchart up.

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.630
Just make a new document, and
let's just add a couple little

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.100
things to it here.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.660
And now if I go back to Drive,
you'll see that the document

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.170
has already appeared
in my Google Drive.

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.420
ALI AFSHAR: OK.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.105
So that's really awesome.

00:02:08.105 --> 00:02:14.210
So with one click, the user is
being directed to Lucidchart.

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.890
You've created the file, and
then it's there in your Drive

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.920
for you to access from
all your machines.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:20.940
OK, fantastic.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.430
So if we could then look
at that Lucidchart

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:24.500
file in your Drive.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.040
If you right click on that--

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.090
GREG KNOKE: Right.

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.860
Then we have this Open With
feature, so we can open the

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.980
document with Lucidchart.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.560
Or if we had other apps that
could open this document type,

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.680
which this is a proprietary
document type, so there are

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:43.740
none in this case.

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.130
But say the PDFs, we could do.

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.930
You can see we might have a
couple more options for

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:50.730
opening this type.

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.610
And if I had some sort of PDF
viewer app installed, we would

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:55.860
see it there.

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.520
ALI AFSHAR: If you click on it
to Open With, can you show us

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.200
what happens there?

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:01.510
GREG KNOKE: Yeah.

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.840
So if we click on the Open With
Lucidchart, you'll see

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.730
that we, again, open this
document directly into

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:09.930
Lucidchart.

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:10.200
ALI AFSHAR: OK.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:10.970
So that's great.

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:17.980
So is there any way I can get
more apps or how would that

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:18.690
happen there?

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.500
GREG KNOKE: So also you'll see
here at the bottom of the

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.240
Create menu, we have
Connect More Apps.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:29.600
So let's just go find another
app to connect to Drive.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.780
There's one in particular
we were looking for.

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.670
ALI AFSHAR: So while you find
that-- so this looks a bit

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.270
like the Chrome Web Store, and
that's because it's leveraging

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.700
the same technology as
the Chrome Web Store.

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:40.580
GREG KNOKE: Right.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.690
So here we found Cacoo, another
diagramming app

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.340
because maybe I want
some other feature

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.540
that only Cacoo has.

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.490
So we'll install it,
and you'll see I

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:51.395
just clicked Install.

00:03:51.395 --> 00:03:57.450
I was prompted, and it's
still loading.

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:58.700
This'll take just a second.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.780
There we go.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.900
So it's connected now.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.460
And now, if you see, I click
in the Create menu

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:09.710
and Cacoo is here.

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:17.315
So let's go create
a Cacoo document.

00:04:17.315 --> 00:04:19.300
ALI AFSHAR: So obviously,
there's authorization.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:22.490
The app has to be granted
authorization by you, but that

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.300
only has to happen once.

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.530
GREG KNOKE: Right.

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:26.680
ALI AFSHAR: The first time?

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.770
GREG KNOKE: Oh, an error
has occurred.

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.570
OK.

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.010
So we'll try that again.

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.710
See if it works this time.

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:36.100
OK.

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.140
There we go.

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:41.430
So now you can see I had
previously installed this, but

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:47.300
we'll just make a
new document.

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:52.540
So we'll just start a new
Cacoo document here.

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:53.790
There we go.

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.420
ALI AFSHAR: This is another
diagramming app?

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.651
GREG KNOKE: Right.

00:04:59.651 --> 00:05:03.000
So here's another diagramming
app, Cacoo.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.710
You can see it's the same
idea as Lucidchart.

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.350
And let's just go ahead and save
this diagram, and so now

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:11.750
the diagram is saved.

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:19.765
And if I go back to Drive
and refresh here--

00:05:19.765 --> 00:05:24.560
well, this one hasn't
saved to Drive yet.

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:29.540
I'm not sure why that happened,
but eventually,

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:33.500
Cacoo's document will show
up here as well.

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:33.740
ALI AFSHAR: OK.

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:34.380
So that's awesome.

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:39.820
So you can create and open files
with these applications,

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.060
and you can install these
applications.

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:45.500
And great for your users as
they don't have to leave

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.200
Google Drive to actually
install this stuff.

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:51.020
It can all happen in there,
in Google Drive.

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.660
So now I've installed
these applications.

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:56.960
Really important is, how do
I remove them and how do I

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.260
manage them?

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.640
GREG KNOKE: So say you decide
you don't really need an

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:05.700
application anymore
for some reason.

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:07.880
Here, I'll go back
a step here.

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.280
You see the little gear here.

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.740
If you click on the Settings
gear and then go to Manage

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.600
Apps and bring up the
Application Manager.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:17.360
ALI AFSHAR: Could you show us?

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.740
Go through there and tell
us what's in there?

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:22.660
GREG KNOKE: So in here, you
have all the different

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:25.910
applications you've installed
to your Google Drive.

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:28.970
So you see I have a few, like
PicMonkey and Lucidchart, that

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:32.340
are already installed, and
Cacoo, which I just installed.

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:34.810
So then you have options.

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:36.490
You can view the product page.

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:40.205
You can view all the files that
the app is authorized to.

00:06:40.205 --> 00:06:42.740
You can look at the files
this app has created.

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:45.560
Or, if you decide you don't need
the app anymore, you can

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.660
just disconnect it from Drive.

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:49.810
And so, if we disconnect it
from Drive, you see it

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:52.820
disappears from the list of
available applications.

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:54.550
Click OK.

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:59.720
But this won't actually delete
the files that this

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.280
application has created
from your Drive.

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:02.580
ALI AFSHAR: So exactly.

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:03.560
You don't lose your data.

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.620
What it does is it removes
all the authorization.

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:10.040
It is equivalent to you revoking
the tokens, so the

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:12.280
app can't access those
files anymore.

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.910
But they're there if you ever
want to use them again.

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:19.660
You can just re-install the
application if you want to.

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:21.610
So that's really great.

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:23.630
Bring your application
in front of all the

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:24.750
Google Drive users.

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:27.720
Put it there, put the icon
there, and make it easy for

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:28.530
people to click.

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:32.110
Make it easy for people to
use your application.

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:33.240
How do you do it?

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:35.100
OK, that's kind of
really important

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:37.590
but also really easy.

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:39.740
A lot of these web applications
have a Chrome Web

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:40.490
Store listing.

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:43.950
If you don't have a Chrome Web
Store listing, I kind of want

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:46.390
to know why because it's the
perfect fit for your

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:48.220
applications that
create stuff.

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:52.110
All you have to do is add a
couple of values into your

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:53.460
Chrome Web Store manifest.

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:55.590
And those are the container
value, which has

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:57.540
to be Google Drive.

00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:58.960
So you add that container
value.

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:02.450
And then you need to link your
project ID as well, so we know

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:05.340
that the right project is
having the authorization

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:06.980
details and that
kind of thing.

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:07.050
OK?

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:09.210
So it's very, very easy.

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:11.380
If you go to Google
Developers--

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:17.060
sorry, developers.googl
e.com/drive/listing, that is

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:20.410
where you can find information
on this and

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:21.500
simple copy and paste.

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:24.250
But you just add a couple of
lines to your manifest, and

00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:26.630
magically, you'll appear
in this list.

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:29.550
I would think that
this is a really

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:30.870
advantageous thing to do.

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:32.950
It's not something you do at
the start when you're first

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:33.780
building your app.

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:36.664
But when it's good, when it
works, when it's polished, put

00:08:36.664 --> 00:08:40.330
it there, and people will be
able to find your app.

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:42.940
If you look back on some of our
previous videos, so like

00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:47.090
at Google I/O, they show that
there are a few case studies.

00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:50.090
My advice-- there was one in
particular who said that not

00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:53.910
only were they getting more
conversions coming from Google

00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:57.820
Drive, but these people were
more premium users.

00:08:57.820 --> 00:08:59.910
They were more likely to
pay for services and

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:00.670
that kind of thing.

00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:03.640
So I would think that it's a
really, really good thing for

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:08.440
you to do to promote your app
as a marketing exercise that

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:09.410
really works.

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:11.260
So that's mostly us.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:15.673
Let's see if we've got any
questions that asked.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:23.970
OK, great.

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:25.680
I see no questions,
so I assume that's

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:26.900
all perfectly clear.

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:28.720
It's kind of obvious, really.

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:31.180
Have you got anything
to add, Greg?

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:32.780
GREG KNOKE: I have nothing
to add right now.

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:34.170
I think you explained
it all very well.

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:35.370
ALI AFSHAR: OK, brilliant.

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:36.340
So thanks, everyone.

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:39.220
Get in touch with us on Stack
Overflow, on the Google Drive

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:41.810
Community, on Google+.

00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:43.820
We're always happy
to talk to you.

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:46.320
We're always willing to look at
your applications and see

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:49.750
if you want to improve the flow

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:52.000
because we're keen for the users
to be able to use this

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.170
stuff well.

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:53.450
OK?

00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:54.710
So thanks very much.

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:55.090
Take care.

00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:56.280
We'll see you next time.

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:57.530
GREG KNOKE: Thank you.
