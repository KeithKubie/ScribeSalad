00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.249
This episode of Crash Course is brought to
you by Squarespace.

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:10.980
So now we’ve come to the last of the naked
eye planets in the solar system: Saturn. It’s

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.539
the second largest planet, but ironically
the least dense. In fact, if you could find

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:17.899
a bathtub big enough, Saturn would float in
it!

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.100
But it would leave a ring.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:35.320
OK, that’s the oldest joke in astronomy,
but it’s true. Saturn is a gas giant, which

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.980
means it has a thick atmosphere. Like Jupiter,
it probably has a rocky core several times

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.750
the mass of Earth, surrounded by layers of
ice and weird, metallic hydrogen. On top of

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.440
all that is its atmosphere, hundreds of kilometers
deep, composed mostly of hydrogen, with a

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.160
smaller amount of helium and a whole bunch
of trace gases like methane and ammonia.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.190
Overall, its density is about 2/3rds that
of water. It wouldn’t really float, though;

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.530
its gravity would draw in all the water from
the giant bathtub… although, actually, come

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.960
to think of it, a bathtub filled with water
big enough to put Saturn in would have more

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.650
mass than the planet, so the water would pull
Saturn in.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.070
Astronomy is fun!

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.210
Saturn spins really quickly, completing a
day in just ten and a half hours. Its rapid

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.400
rotation and low density means it’s really
oblate, or squished; it’s 10% wider through

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.820
the Equator than through the poles! That’s
really noticeable through a telescope.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.260
When we look at Saturn, we only see its cloud
tops. Those clouds are mostly ammonia ices,

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.240
with water clouds lower down. The atmosphere
is banded, like Jupiter’s, but the pattern

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.830
is much fainter, probably due to Saturn being
farther from the Sun and therefore colder,

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.790
as well as the atmosphere being deeper than
Jupiter’s too.

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.570
That’s not to say Saturn doesn’t have
storms. Oval hurricanes pop up every now and

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.820
again, and in 2010 a huge storm erupted in
Saturn’s northern hemisphere. It was discovered

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.909
by an amateur astronomer, and Cassini spacecraft
pictures showed it getting so big it literally

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:01.680
wrapped around the planet, reaching a length of over
300,000 kilometers! Traces of it persisted for years.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.690
One of the most striking features on Saturn
is a huge, hexagonal vortex at its north pole.

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.629
Vortices like this are common on planets;
Earth and Venus have them too. That well-defined

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:15.840
six-sided shape is pretty freaky, but it’s
actually a natural outcome of a spinning fluid—the

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.090
air circulating Saturn’s atmosphere—which
itself is in a spinning system—in this case,

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.989
the planet itself. It’s not that different
than Earth’s jet stream, but it’s a lot

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:30.769
bigger, about 20,000 kilometers across…
wider than Earth. And right at its center,

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:36.269
over Saturn’s north pole, is a ridiculously
beautiful storm system about 2000 kilometers

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:40.609
across. Wind speeds there have been clocked
at 500 kilometers per hour.

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:46.159
Saturn as a planet is of course an amazing
place, but c’mon. When you think Saturn,

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:48.739
you think rings. As well you should.

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:52.709
Saturn’s rings were seen by Galileo, but
his telescope lacked the resolution to really

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.129
figure out what they were—he thought Saturn
might be three objects in close proximity.

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:01.349
Some decades later the Dutch scientist Christiaan
Huygens correctly interpreted their appearance

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:03.159
as a ring surrounding the planet.

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:07.230
They’re not solid. If they were they’d
get torn apart, since the inner edge would

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.049
orbit the planet way faster than the outer
edge. They’re actually made of countless

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:16.370
small chunks of very nearly pure water ice.
Each particle orbits the planet independently…

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.040
so I guess Saturn wins in the “which planet
has the most moons” category.

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.519
What really gets me about Saturn’s rings
is their scale. They’re 250,000 kilometers

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:31.620
across. If you put Saturn between the Earth
and Moon, the rings would cover ⅔ that distance.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:37.900
And yet, despite their size, they’re incredibly
thin: They average about ten meters thick.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.349
And no, I did not misspeak, I meant ten meters.
Ten meters.

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:47.840
That’s amazing. That’s thinner, to scale,
than a sheet of paper. Way thinner: If you

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.059
shrank Saturn down to the size of a piece
of paper, that paper would be ten thousand

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:53.569
times thicker than the rings.

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:56.449
So yeah, Saturn’s rings are flat. But why?

00:03:56.449 --> 00:04:00.319
Well that’s tied to their origin, though
the specifics of how they came to be aren’t

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:04.589
exactly known. One idea is that they were
originally an icy moon that got disrupted

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:09.079
by a huge collision. The shattered moon particles
would have spread around Saturn, and any of

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:13.069
them that were on a tilted orbit would quickly
collide with others, and in the end that would

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:15.790
average out all their orbits to form a flattened
ring.

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.500
Or maybe there was once a large moon near
Saturn, that was big enough to be differentiated;

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.770
that means the rocky bits fell to the moon’s
core, while the ice stayed near the surface.

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:29.620
As it plowed through the material around the
protoSaturn, the moon’s icy layer got stripped

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.560
off, forming the rings. And again, that would
form a very flat disk.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.400
However they formed, collisions would quickly
flatten the ring out. And remember, Saturn

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.340
is oblate, so as the rings formed they would’ve
felt a gravitational tug from Saturn’s equatorial

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.080
bulge, centering them right over the planet’s
midline.

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.789
Saturn has three main rings, give or take.
In classic imaginative astronomer fashion,

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:54.699
they’re given the names A, B, and C—in
order of their discovery. B is the broadest,

00:04:54.699 --> 00:05:00.639
roughly 26,000 kilometers wide. A is outside B,
while the C ring is fainter and inside the B ring.

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.600
When the rings were first observed, the A
and B rings were thought to be one ring. But

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:09.270
then the Italian astronomer Giovanni Domenico
Cassini discovered a gap between them, and

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:14.050
we now call that the Cassini Division. It’s
about 5000 kilometers across, but it’s not

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.449
empty! There are quite a few very narrow rings
inside of it.

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:21.220
The gap is due to one of Saturn’s moons,
Mimas. If you’re an ice particle in the

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:26.680
Cassini division, you orbit Saturn twice for
every one time Mimas goes around. This is

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.710
called a resonance, and it means that the
particles at that location get tugged repeatedly

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:35.479
by the gravity of Mimas, which in essence
yanks them out of their orbit.

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:41.349
There are quite a few gaps in the rings caused
by moons; in fact, there are hundreds of “ringlets”

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:46.470
in the main rings. Even weirder, the F ring
is outside the A ring, and is very narrow,

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:51.069
just a few hundred kilometers across. It’s
kept that way by two moons, Prometheus and

00:05:51.069 --> 00:05:54.879
Pandora, orbiting just inside and outside
the ring. They tug on the ring particles in

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.180
such a way that keeps them confined to very
strict orbits; if a particle wanders out,

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:00.939
the moons’ gravity drags it back in.

00:06:00.939 --> 00:06:05.650
As the moons and ring particles interact,
they can also create weird rippling waves

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:10.819
in the rings. And this is really cool: when
small moons orbit Saturn on slightly inclined

00:06:10.819 --> 00:06:15.460
orbits; it can create waves in the rings,
tremendous vertical excursions that can reach

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.280
several kilometers high.

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:18.030
Saturn is weird.

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:23.110
And so are its moons. I already mentioned
Mimas, an icy moon that carves out the Cassini

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:27.699
Division with its gravity. It also suffered
a massive impact long ago that created a single

00:06:27.699 --> 00:06:30.860
huge crater, making it look somehow familiar.

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:35.620
But Saturn has two moons specifically you
should know about. The first is Titan, a monster

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:40.189
satellite that’s actually bigger than Mercury,
not that much smaller than Mars, and second

00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:44.860
in moon size ranking only to Jupiter’s moon
Ganymede. Titan not only has a substantial

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:50.479
atmosphere—the only moon to have one—but
it’s thicker than our air on Earth! I wouldn’t

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:54.699
suggest breathing it, though: It’s mostly
nitrogen, with a smattering of methane and

00:06:54.699 --> 00:06:58.909
hydrogen. It’s also a hundred and eighty
below zero Celsius there. Definitely don’t

00:06:58.909 --> 00:07:00.870
stick your tongue on a flagpole on Titan.

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:04.449
Titan’s atmosphere has a thick layer of
haze that prevents us from seeing the surface

00:07:04.449 --> 00:07:09.060
using visible light. But using infrared and
radar, though, the Cassini spacecraft, which

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:13.560
has been orbiting Saturn since 2004, is able
to map the surface. It also deployed a probe

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:18.249
named Huygens to land on Titan’s surface,
the first time humanity had ever landed on

00:07:18.249 --> 00:07:19.810
an outer solar system moon.

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:25.810
What they saw was an odd world, Earth-like
in some ways, and very aien in many others.

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:30.780
Titan has wind-sculpted dunes, but they’re
made of hydrocarbon grains, not sand. There

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:36.139
are hints of volcanoes that spew liquid water
instead of lava. These are called cryovolcanoes,

00:07:36.139 --> 00:07:40.759
cold volcanoes, a term I love. This, together
with measurements of Titan’s gravitational

00:07:40.759 --> 00:07:46.219
field, have scientists thinking that Titan
may have an underground ocean of liquid water.

00:07:46.219 --> 00:07:50.879
Intriguingly, Titan also has long, winding
channels indicating flows of some kind of

00:07:50.879 --> 00:07:55.039
liquid on its surface. But it can’t be water;
it’s far too cold on the surface for that.

00:07:55.039 --> 00:07:59.729
So what kind of liquid could it be? Well,
Cassini also spotted quite a few flat regions

00:07:59.729 --> 00:08:04.819
near Titan’s north and south poles. These
have since been confirmed to be lakes of liquid

00:08:04.819 --> 00:08:08.539
methane—the first time any liquid has been
seen on the surface of another world. The

00:08:08.539 --> 00:08:13.759
shorelines of the lakes appear to change over
time, too, hinting very strongly that Titan

00:08:13.759 --> 00:08:18.300
has weather, driven by methane as opposed
to water here on Earth.

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:23.069
Weather, atmosphere, surface liquids, and
an abundance of organic, carbon-based molecules…

00:08:23.069 --> 00:08:27.819
could there be life on Titan? The conditions
there are…interesting. We obviously don’t

00:08:27.819 --> 00:08:29.669
know yet, but it’s an exciting possibility.

00:08:29.669 --> 00:08:34.900
And it’s not the only Saturnian moon scientists
are looking at for signs of life. Enceladus

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:40.090
is a smaller, icy moon about 500 km across:
About the size of my home state of Colorado

00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:44.710
or the southern part of England. Enceladus
is incredibly shiny, reflecting nearly all

00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:48.770
the light that hits it: a strong indicator
it’s covered in water ice.

00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:53.510
Parts of it are cratered, but other parts
are very smooth, indicating some event resurfaced

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:58.000
the moon. The surface also has an extensive
series of cracks in it, much like Jupiter’s

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.810
moon Europa. Scientists suspected cryovolcanism,
and that was confirmed quite dramatically

00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:09.130
in 2005 when Cassini spotted active geysers
of water spewing from the south pole of Enceladus!

00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:13.280
The water is erupting from a series of cracks
nicknamed “tiger stripes”, and is coming

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:18.100
from deep under the surface. Like Europa,
Enceladus has an undersurface ocean, kept

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:22.540
liquid by Saturn’s ferocious tides, which
squeeze the moon as it orbits the planet.

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:26.810
The plumes reach several hundred kilometers
from the moon’s surface, and Cassini even

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:30.990
flew directly through the plumes, and detected
organic molecules.

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:36.850
Could Enceladus be yet another harbor for
life in the solar system? Again, no one knows,

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:41.340
but I’d put it in the top three places to
look, including Europa and Titan. It’s weird,

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:46.250
isn’t it? We’ve always looked for planets
where conditions were like here on Earth,

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:51.340
but it turns out extremely cold moons may
be the best places to seek out new life.

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:55.970
Saturn has a huge retinue of other moons,
too, and they’re all pretty weird. Iapetus

00:09:55.970 --> 00:10:00.250
is shaped like a walnut, with a tall ridge
of mountains encircling its equator; no one’s

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:04.180
quite sure how that formed. Hyperion looks
like a huge piece of Styrofoam that’s been

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:07.980
hit repeatedly with a BB gun—and that’s
not a bad analogy, since it has such a low

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:13.070
density it’s likely to be extremely porous,
like a sponge. A lot of Saturn’s moons orbit

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:17.500
the planet backwards, retrograde; similar
to several moons of Jupiter. These may be

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:22.500
captured asteroids, or even Kuiper Belt Objects,
giant chunks of ice that we’ll learn about

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:27.480
very soon in a future episode. All in all, Saturn
has over 60 moons we’ve discovered so far.

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:32.540
I want to add a personal note. When you ask
astronomers or astronauts what got them started,

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:37.600
what was the very first thing that happened
to them to inspire them to do what they do,

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:41.490
overwhelmingly they will tell you: “I saw
Saturn through a telescope.”

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:45.690
It’s true. It’s true for me; I remember
my parents buying a cheap department store

00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:50.230
telescope when I was five or six, setting
it up in our driveway, and aiming it at Saturn.

00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:55.770
I still remember seeing Saturn in the eyepiece,
a perfect jewel, the rings small but vivid

00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:59.370
and sharp. It’s hard to believe it’s real
when you see it, and even after all these

00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:03.690
years, it’s my favorite target when I’m
stargazing. I’ll never get tired of watching

00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:08.230
peoples’ faces when they see it for the
first time. They gasp, they their eyes get

00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:12.850
wide, their mouths drops open—it’s honestly
one of the greatest joys of life.

00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:17.880
Saturn is the crown jewel of the solar system.
It’s the best kind of astronomical object:

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:23.440
Visually stunning, artistically gorgeous, and
filled to overflowing with incredible science.

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:28.530
Today you learned that Saturn is a gas giant,
and has a broad set of rings made of ice particles.

00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:33.910
Moons create gaps in the rings via their gravity.
Saturn has dozens of moons, including Titan,

00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:38.820
which is as big as Mercury and has a thick
atmosphere and lakes of methane; and Enceladus

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:43.380
which has an undersurface ocean and eruptions
of water geysers. And, though we don’t know

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:47.600
for sure, it’s possible either or both moons
may support life.
