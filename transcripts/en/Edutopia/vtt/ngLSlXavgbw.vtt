00:00:08.076 --> 00:00:09.656
&gt;&gt;Teacher: We're going to
do some practice, okay?

00:00:09.656 --> 00:00:11.796
Did you hear "e" in "feet"?

00:00:12.046 --> 00:00:12.976
Thumbs up!

00:00:13.106 --> 00:00:16.156
&gt;&gt;Dawn: Since we've implemented
our current Response

00:00:16.156 --> 00:00:20.186
to Intervention structure, we are
providing such intensive interventions

00:00:20.236 --> 00:00:25.146
that students are getting caught up and
are not ending up in special education.

00:00:25.716 --> 00:00:27.436
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Did we hear "e" in "fuss"?

00:00:27.726 --> 00:00:29.596
No. Good job.

00:00:32.586 --> 00:00:35.726
&gt;&gt;Dawn: We all believe that kids
can be a hundred percent successful

00:00:35.726 --> 00:00:37.326
if we give them what they need.

00:00:37.846 --> 00:00:39.816
The Response to Intervention
Program is built

00:00:39.816 --> 00:00:40.936
to have all students
meeting those standards.

00:00:41.346 --> 00:00:43.926
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Is that what everybody got?

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.669
&gt;&gt;Class: Yeah!

00:00:44.736 --> 00:00:44.976
&gt;&gt;Teacher: All right.

00:00:45.356 --> 00:00:48.926
&gt;&gt;Nicole: So Tier 1 at Drew is
just your typical instruction,

00:00:48.926 --> 00:00:52.596
what happens in every classroom,
and all students get that.

00:00:53.316 --> 00:00:56.236
What we do for Tier 2
Interventions, in the morning,

00:00:56.236 --> 00:00:58.436
we have an hour-long intervention block.

00:00:58.436 --> 00:01:03.226
And we do this K-2, so that by the time
they get to third grade we don't have

00:01:03.426 --> 00:01:07.536
such a large number of kids who
need really intensive interventions.

00:01:07.726 --> 00:01:10.816
And then, of course, those kids that
do are coming to the Literacy Center.

00:01:11.106 --> 00:01:13.676
&gt;&gt;Barbara: Tier 3 is where the
Literacy Center would come in.

00:01:13.676 --> 00:01:14.976
Not only the Literacy
Center, but the Math Lab, too.

00:01:16.226 --> 00:01:17.496
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Here you go.

00:01:19.096 --> 00:01:20.686
&gt;&gt;Barbara: We have created a
Literacy Center and a Math Lab.

00:01:20.686 --> 00:01:23.416
And we're taking those children
that need that added assistance,

00:01:23.696 --> 00:01:28.276
and they're getting targeted
interventions that are really specific

00:01:28.276 --> 00:01:29.796
to what their deficits are.

00:01:30.216 --> 00:01:33.826
&gt;&gt;Nicole: So the first year
of the Literacy Center,

00:01:33.826 --> 00:01:36.486
we realized what we were
currently doing wasn't working.

00:01:36.746 --> 00:01:42.376
Kids were getting pulled out in large
groups, out of grade level instruction,

00:01:42.756 --> 00:01:46.696
to try to catch them up, and
the gap was just not closing.

00:01:46.936 --> 00:01:50.196
So at Drew, the kids go
to two Enrichment Classes.

00:01:50.236 --> 00:01:52.256
So they'll go to PE, and Art.

00:01:52.526 --> 00:01:56.256
And we looked at how can we
use that time to provide some

00:01:56.256 --> 00:01:59.786
of the interventions rather than
pulling them out of their reading class?

00:02:00.206 --> 00:02:04.086
&gt;&gt;Dawn: Our goal is to make it a
different enrichment option for them,

00:02:04.086 --> 00:02:07.956
instead of going to Music, they
get to come to the Literacy Center.

00:02:07.956 --> 00:02:14.156
Or instead of going to Robotics,
they get to go to the Math Lab.

00:02:14.156 --> 00:02:16.886
&gt;&gt;India: We see about 20
percent of the school population.

00:02:17.236 --> 00:02:19.146
These are the students
with the greatest need.

00:02:19.146 --> 00:02:23.236
And we specialize in very
intense modified instruction.

00:02:23.236 --> 00:02:26.976
And this is to pinpoint their
exact areas of difficulty.

00:02:28.046 --> 00:02:29.336
&gt;&gt;India: Can you write
down your explanation?

00:02:29.656 --> 00:02:30.006
&gt;&gt;Student: Okay.

00:02:30.986 --> 00:02:31.566
&gt;&gt;India: Okay.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.316
&gt;&gt;India: The kids are
missing numeracy skills.

00:02:34.316 --> 00:02:36.586
If their framework in the numbers is
very weak, we know that we need to target

00:02:36.586 --> 00:02:38.636
those students and
start right away with them.

00:02:38.986 --> 00:02:41.206
&gt;&gt;Marlowe: If it's something you
don't understand, you just have to ask

00:02:41.376 --> 00:02:43.046
for help, and she'll break it down.

00:02:43.476 --> 00:02:45.936
But in the regular classroom,

00:02:45.936 --> 00:02:48.056
the teachers don't have
enough time to do that.

00:02:48.226 --> 00:02:50.736
&gt;&gt;Nicole: What we tried to do
is keep the groups very small,

00:02:50.776 --> 00:02:55.696
so we're really able to create groups
with kids that have a similar area

00:02:55.696 --> 00:02:57.656
of weakness, and really
push them through.

00:02:58.676 --> 00:03:01.826
&gt;&gt;Dawn: What they do in here
is always built around learning

00:03:01.826 --> 00:03:03.706
to decode, and read fluently.

00:03:04.196 --> 00:03:06.806
But it's also built around having fun.

00:03:07.016 --> 00:03:11.136
And they do have to burn some
energy, because it is their time away

00:03:11.136 --> 00:03:12.396
from the general classroom.

00:03:12.946 --> 00:03:15.296
So there has to be opportunities
for them to talk,

00:03:15.726 --> 00:03:19.566
to move, to get up and down.

00:03:19.566 --> 00:03:21.066
They might write in shaving cream.

00:03:21.066 --> 00:03:22.376
They might write in sand.

00:03:22.596 --> 00:03:24.256
We let them write on the tables.

00:03:24.596 --> 00:03:26.026
Things that are fun for them.

00:03:26.136 --> 00:03:28.416
Opportunities to get
lots and lots of praise.

00:03:28.866 --> 00:03:29.216
&gt;&gt;Dawn: Shout!

00:03:29.666 --> 00:03:32.306
Awesome! You're definitely getting
one of these awesome stickers.

00:03:32.586 --> 00:03:34.936
&gt;&gt;Dawn: You know, that's their
time to really feel safe,

00:03:35.496 --> 00:03:38.366
and to really feel secure,
and to, you know, be the best

00:03:38.506 --> 00:03:39.666
and be in charge of something.

00:03:39.666 --> 00:03:41.456
&gt;&gt;Melissa: And how many
sounds was it, Thomas?

00:03:41.616 --> 00:03:42.356
&gt;&gt;Thomas: Three!

00:03:42.736 --> 00:03:43.316
&gt;&gt;Melissa: Three!

00:03:43.566 --> 00:03:46.886
I think you guys are ready
to do this on your own.

00:03:46.956 --> 00:03:49.836
So we're going to get
out the dot-to-dot sheet.

00:03:50.076 --> 00:03:52.416
&gt;&gt;Nicole: Definitely something we had to
look at over the years was the programs

00:03:52.416 --> 00:03:54.596
that we were using in order
to provide the interventions.

00:03:54.716 --> 00:03:58.456
Now, we use a stand-alone
phonics program K-2.

00:03:58.456 --> 00:04:02.886
So it's the same program that
we're using in the Lit Center.

00:04:02.886 --> 00:04:06.286
So they get it from their
teachers in the classroom,

00:04:06.286 --> 00:04:08.536
and then they get a double dose
of it in the Literacy Center,

00:04:08.536 --> 00:04:12.366
and that has really impacted
students meeting their goals here.

00:04:12.736 --> 00:04:16.156
&gt;&gt;Nicole: Mr. Jocks,
is this one of yours?

00:04:16.156 --> 00:04:18.016
&gt;&gt;Jocks: Yes, that's one of my students.

00:04:18.016 --> 00:04:18.606
&gt;&gt;Nicole: All right, let's see here.

00:04:18.636 --> 00:04:20.336
&gt;&gt;Nicole: We do progress
monitoring weekly.

00:04:20.336 --> 00:04:23.446
As a team, we look at
that data and decide,

00:04:23.446 --> 00:04:25.706
"Is the intervention
working for these kids?"

00:04:25.906 --> 00:04:28.296
&gt;&gt;Nicole: She's right on that goal line.

00:04:28.296 --> 00:04:31.726
So let's just keep going with what
we're currently doing with her.

00:04:31.986 --> 00:04:34.096
&gt;&gt;India: We retest the
children in December.

00:04:34.676 --> 00:04:38.866
Students who have made substantial
gains, may exit the Math Lab

00:04:38.866 --> 00:04:40.766
or the Literacy Center if
they reach their goals.

00:04:41.116 --> 00:04:45.846
Typically about 30 to 40 percent of the
children exit out after the first year.

00:04:46.186 --> 00:04:48.326
&gt;&gt;India: If you have any
questions, let me know, okay?

00:04:48.326 --> 00:04:48.676
All right!

00:04:49.016 --> 00:04:49.666
Good job!

00:04:49.936 --> 00:04:55.656
&gt;&gt;Dawn: Since the Literacy Center has
come along, it's rare that you get kids

00:04:55.656 --> 00:04:58.596
in your classroom who
can't decode the words.

00:04:58.966 --> 00:05:02.446
Which is obviously a great
thing as a classroom teacher.

00:05:02.446 --> 00:05:07.586
&gt;&gt;Melissa: The RTI has had some
wonderful effects in my classroom.

00:05:07.646 --> 00:05:10.726
Sometimes it is hard
to juggle everything,

00:05:10.726 --> 00:05:14.556
and to know that we have colleagues
giving our students extra support

00:05:14.556 --> 00:05:18.416
in reading and math, it
lessens the burden a little bit.

00:05:18.416 --> 00:05:22.426
&gt;&gt;Nicole: Since we've implemented our
current Response to Intervention structure,

00:05:22.896 --> 00:05:25.846
our percent of students who
qualify for Special Ed has dropped

00:05:25.846 --> 00:05:27.416
from thirteen percent to eight percent.

00:05:28.046 --> 00:05:31.666
Almost all of our kids pass
the State test every year.

00:05:31.936 --> 00:05:32.926
And we even have some exceed.
