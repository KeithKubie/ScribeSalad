00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.950
One way we can actually fix this problem of the red circles and

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.710
not being able to know what they represent is by

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.170
a very simple addition of a legend to our chart.

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:16.640
The legend is useful to associate a label to each of the circles here.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:17.850
Let's see what that looks like in D3.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.770
A very simple but powerful way to add context to your visualization or

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:28.800
graphic is through the simple use of text to add labels or annotations.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.300
I wanted to go through and show you how to add a legend using text.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.330
But this process can be extended to adding any sorts of labels or

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.240
annotation to any point on your graphic.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.390
What we have here is pretty standard.

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.770
And we've seen it before with all the circles.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:51.900
Is we simply append to an SVG some group element, giving it a class of legend.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:57.890
We simply move that group to be x position 100 less than the width, so

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.920
it's going to correspond to the width minus 100 and a y position of 20.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.300
So again, y position of zero is the top of our chart.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.560
So, this is going to be 20 pixels down from the top.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.910
Again, this is one of the quarks with D3, so we've appended a group.

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.920
And then select that same group we've appended.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:25.620
We bind data to it, in this case simply the strings home team and others.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.660
And this is also to show you the flexibility, that your data doesn't have to

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.090
come from a file, doesn't have to have many rows in it.

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.820
In this case it's simply a JavaScript array with two strings in it.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.570
Since we don't already have a legend on our page

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.660
the .enter selection is going to return two group elements.

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.240
One for the home team and one for the others.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.020
Or rather placeholders.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.280
And then for each of those placeholders bound to Home Team and

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.060
Others we append a group element.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.870
And again if that seems confusing in words look back to what we

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:00.170
did with the circles.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.140
Or run each of these functions in a web console to see

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.310
what values are passed in and out at every step of the chain.

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.180
So now we have a legend with SVG group elements bound to some data.

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.880
But we don't have text yet.
