00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.060
So we're going back to
our little burger stand

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.344
where we had our demand curve
in terms of burgers per hour.

00:00:07.344 --> 00:00:09.010
And now, I want to
think about something

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:12.000
from the perspective
of our burger stand.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.640
And think about,
at any given point

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:18.290
on this demand curve, how much
revenue would we get per hour.

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:20.720
And when I talk about revenue,
for simplicity, let's just

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.710
think that's really just
how much total sales will

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:24.970
I get in a given hour.

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:26.845
So let me just write
over here total revenue.

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:32.830
Well, the total
revenue is going to be

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.790
how much I get per burger times
the number of burgers I get.

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.960
So the amount that I
get per burger is price.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.100
So it's going to
be equal to price.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.249
And then the total number
of burgers in that hour

00:00:44.249 --> 00:00:45.415
is going to be the quantity.

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:50.450
Pretty straightforward.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:55.130
If I sell 10 things
at $5, I am going

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:02.340
to get $50 of revenue,
$50 of sales in that hour.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.540
Now, let's think about
what the total revenue will

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.480
look like at different
points along this curve

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:08.150
right over here.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.010
And actually, let me just
make a table right over here.

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.820
So I'll make one column
price, one column quantity.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.125
And then let's make one
column total revenue.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.970
So let's look at a
couple scenarios here.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.136
Well, we could actually
look at some of these points

00:01:28.136 --> 00:01:29.400
that we already have defined.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.306
At point A over
here, price is 9.

00:01:33.306 --> 00:01:34.680
So I'll do it in
point A's color.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.060
Prices is 9.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.130
Quantity is 2. $9 times
2 burgers, $9 per burger

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.750
times 2 burgers per hour.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.330
Your total revenue
is going to be $18.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.460
And you can see it
visually right over here.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.700
This height right
over here is 9.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.112
And this width right
over here is 2.

00:01:53.112 --> 00:01:55.080
And your total
revenue is going to be

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.120
the area of this rectangle.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.830
Because the height is the price.

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.350
And the width is the quantity.

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.890
So that total revenue is
the area right over there.

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.747
Now, let's go to point--
let me do a couple of them

00:02:09.747 --> 00:02:11.970
just to really make
it clear for us.

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.590
Let's try to point
B. So at point B

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.440
when our price is 8 and our
quantity is 4, 4 per hour.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.250
Our total revenue is
going to be 8 times 4

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.311
which is $32 per hour.

00:02:24.311 --> 00:02:26.060
And once again, you
can see that visually.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.060
The height here is 8.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.910
And the width here-- so the
height of this rectangle is 8.

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.020
And the width is 4.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.680
The total revenue is
going to be the area.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.880
It's going to be the height
times the width just like that.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.940
Now, let's go to a point that I
haven't actually graphed here.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.620
Actually, let me
just-- actually,

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.190
I'll go through all the
points just for fun.

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.500
So now at point C, we have 5.50.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:54.590
5.50 is a price.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.640
The quantity is 9.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.050
9 times 5.50.

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.460
9 times 5 is $45.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:03.370
And you have another 4.50.

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.700
So that is 49.50.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.740
So once again, it's going to
be the area of this rectangle.

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.210
Area of that rectangle
right over there.

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:17.010
So you might already be
noticing something interesting.

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.240
As we lower the price, at least
in this part of our demand

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.190
curve, as we lower the
price, we are actually

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.450
increasing not just
the quantity were

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.150
increasing the total revenue.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.420
Let's see if this
keeps happening.

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:35.380
So if we go to point D, I'll
do it in that same color.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.150
We have 4.50.

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.440
And we are selling 11 units.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.730
So 11 times 4.50.

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.860
Let's see, this is going
to be 44 plus 5.50.

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.650
Once again, that is 49.50.

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.320
So that this rectangle is
going to have the same area

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.120
as that pink one that we
just did for scenario C.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.049
And I'll actually just
do one more down here,

00:03:57.049 --> 00:03:58.090
just to see what happens.

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.860
Because this is interesting.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:59.818
Now we lower the price.

00:03:59.818 --> 00:04:02.590
And it looks like things
didn't change much.

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.000
And now, let's go-- let's
just do one more point

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.262
actually for the sake of time.

00:04:07.262 --> 00:04:09.220
Point E. And I encourage
you to try other ones.

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:10.180
Try F on your own.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.810
Point E, my price
is $2 per burger.

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.339
My quantity is 16
burgers per hour.

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:20.137
I sell a total of 32 burgers.

00:04:20.137 --> 00:04:21.970
Now actually, let's
just do the last one, F,

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.930
just to feel a
sense of completion.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.160
So $1 per burger.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.160
I sell 18 burgers per hour.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.850
My total revenue, when you
multiply them, is $18 per hour.

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.700
And once again, that's the
area of this rectangle,

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.950
this short and fat
rectangle right over here.

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:42.590
And E was the area--
the total revenue in E

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.249
was the area of that
right over there.

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:46.790
And you could graph
these just to get

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.180
a sense of how total
revenue actually

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.570
changes with respect
to price or quantity.

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:56.250
Lets plot the total revenue
with respect to quantity.

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.560
So let's try it out.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.870
So if you-- let me plot it out.

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.990
So this is going to
be total revenue.

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.910
And this axis right over
here is going to be quantity.

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.240
And we're going to, once
again, go from-- let's see.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.650
This is 0.

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:14.800
This is 5.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.430
This is 10.

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.030
This is 15.

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:21.430
And this is 20 right over here.

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:22.990
And then total revenue.

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.950
Let's see, it gets as high--
it gets pretty close to 50.

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:26.450
So let's go.

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:31.880
This is 10 20, 30, 40, and 50.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:37.240
So that's 50, 40,
30, 20, and 10.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.670
So when our quantity is
2, and our price is 9.

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:42.260
Well, we don't have price on
this axis right over here.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.330
But when our quantity is
2, our total revenues 18.

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:50.070
So it's going to be
something like there.

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:53.895
Then, when our quantity is
4, our total revenue is 32.

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.540
Right about there.

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:04.020
Then, when our quantity is 9,
our total revenue is almost 50.

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:09.070
So right over there.

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:11.700
And then, when
it's 11, it's also

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:17.050
at that same point
right over there.

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:21.120
And then, when we are quantity
is 16, our total revenues 32.

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.310
16.

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:23.640
So 32.

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:24.700
Right there.

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:27.580
And then finally, when
our quantity is 18,

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:28.920
our total revenue is 18.

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:34.830
And what you see is
that it's plotting out

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:36.700
a curve that looks like this.

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:39.260
And if you remember
some of your algebra 2,

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:43.774
this is a concave downwards
parabola right over here.

00:06:43.774 --> 00:06:45.190
And you can see
there was actually

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:49.130
some point at which you could
maximize your total revenue.

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:51.010
And if you really tried
all the points here,

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:53.020
you would see that
maximum point is

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:57.300
if you tried this point
right over here, right

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.770
at price 5 and quantity 10.

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:04.250
At price 5 and quantity 10, in
that hour, you would sell $50.

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:08.254
So this is the maximum
point right over there $50.

00:07:08.254 --> 00:07:10.420
Now, the whole reason why
I'm talk think about this.

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:13.090
I could have talked about this
independently of any discussion

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:17.300
of elasticity just to see how
total revenue relates to price

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:20.130
and quantity at different
points on the demand curve.

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:22.360
But there is an
interesting relationship.

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.290
In that very first
video, and we actually

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:26.390
used this exact
demand curve for it.

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:29.150
When we explored
elasticity, we saw

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:31.140
that up here at this
part of the curve--

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:32.640
let me do this in
a different color.

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:38.560
At this point of the curve in
orange for any change-- when

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.730
you do a change in your price
since the prices are pretty

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:45.640
high, that is a much
lower percent change

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:48.800
in price than the impact
that you get on quantity.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:53.610
Because over here, although
they look like they're close.

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:55.310
Or I should say the absolute.

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:58.620
For every 1 that down
we move in price,

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:00.510
we're moving 2 up quantity.

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:04.200
But that 1 down in price is a
very small percentage of price

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:05.610
because our prices
are high here.

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:08.930
And it's a very large percentage
of quantity right over here.

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:11.740
So you get huge changes
in percent quantity

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:15.180
for very small changes in price
in this part of the curve.

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:17.255
So this part of the
curve is elastic.

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:25.140
Or you could say that its
price elasticity for demand

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:26.150
is greater than 1.

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:29.320
You get larger changes
in percent quantity

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:31.720
for a given change
in percent price.

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:38.200
Now, these parts of the
curve down here, we saw

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.860
is the opposite's happening.

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:42.760
You move 1 down, 1
unit down in price,

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:45.360
you move 2 units to
the right in quantity.

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.820
But over here, price
is a much lower.

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:51.850
So this is a much larger
percentage change in price.

00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:55.590
And this is a much smaller
percentage change in quantity.

00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:57.190
So you get large
percentage changes

00:08:57.190 --> 00:09:00.320
in price for small percentage
change in quantity.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:02.720
That means that here, you
are relatively inelastic.

00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:08.520
And then right over here,
right at this point,

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:10.130
right in this region,
right over here,

00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:12.910
we saw that we
had unit-- we were

00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:15.680
unit elastic right over there.

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:18.510
So there's an interesting
relationship going on.

00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:21.890
While we were, so
while we were elastic,

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:24.210
this part right over
here, when we lowered

00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:27.570
price in this region.

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:30.340
While we were elastic,
when we lowered price,

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:32.880
we got increases in revenue.

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:34.270
So let me write this down.

00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:35.728
And this is generally,
too, there's

00:09:35.728 --> 00:09:37.530
a couple of boundary
cases on the math that

00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:40.520
make it a little bit, you
can't make it absolutely true.

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:46.360
But while we are elastic, at
the elastic points of our demand

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:48.840
curve, a decrease in price.

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:50.500
Price goes down.

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:54.470
Total revenue was going up.

00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:56.950
You do a price cut on this
part of the demand curve,

00:09:56.950 --> 00:09:58.440
you get more revenue.

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:11.850
Then, when you are at unit
elasticity, what was happening?

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:14.180
At unit elasticity, you were
right at this point right

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:14.679
over here.

00:10:14.679 --> 00:10:16.270
Right at this point over here.

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:20.080
And roughly, when
you do a price cut--

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:22.010
and I'm going to say
this is roughly true--

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:27.040
your total revenue
stays constant.

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:28.520
But just right at
that point, right

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:31.350
when you're going through
that unit elasticity point.

00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:37.790
And then finally, when you are
inelastic when a large percent

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:41.000
changes in price result and
not so large percent change

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:51.190
is in quantity demanded, then
a price change going down

00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:53.910
resulted in lower total revenue.

00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:57.155
Resulted in total
revenue going down.

00:10:57.155 --> 00:10:59.030
And this should, hopefully,
make a little bit

00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:00.390
of intuitive sense.

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:04.450
Because over here, this
point, if given percent

00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:07.570
change in price, you were
getting a larger percent

00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:08.740
change in quantity.

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:11.050
So the percent in
price went down.

00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:13.710
Your percent in
quantity grew even more.

00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:16.280
So you made up any
decrease in height

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:17.990
with a increase in width.

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:19.680
So your area increased.

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:22.890
Down here, your decrease
in percent price

00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:27.140
wasn't made up for a
decrease in quantity.

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:31.100
So when you made your
rectangles little bit shorter,

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:33.360
you didn't, we weren't
able to compensate

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:35.270
by growing the width as much.

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:39.673
And so you actually had a lower
area, lower total revenue.
