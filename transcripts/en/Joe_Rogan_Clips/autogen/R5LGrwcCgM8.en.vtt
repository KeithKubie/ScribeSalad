through customs when I was coming in

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470
through customs when I was coming in
 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.490
through customs when I was coming in
from Britain it's a Victorian amputation

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500
from Britain it's a Victorian amputation
 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.640
from Britain it's a Victorian amputation
saw it's called the Clockwork saw and

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.650
saw it's called the Clockwork saw and
 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.659
saw it's called the Clockwork saw and
for people who are just listening it's

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669
for people who are just listening it's
 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.370
for people who are just listening it's
it's a circular saw and there would have

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380
it's a circular saw and there would have
 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.860
it's a circular saw and there would have
been a crank that you wound it with and

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870
been a crank that you wound it with and
 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.360
been a crank that you wound it with and
then you'd release it and it would spin

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370
then you'd release it and it would spin
 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.760
then you'd release it and it would spin
sort of automatically oh yeah and the

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770
sort of automatically oh yeah and the
 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.350
sort of automatically oh yeah and the
idea was that it would make it faster

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360
idea was that it would make it faster
 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.360
idea was that it would make it faster
but the reason why I love this saw so

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370
but the reason why I love this saw so
 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.420
but the reason why I love this saw so
much is that it was a massive failure

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430
much is that it was a massive failure
 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.650
much is that it was a massive failure
and um I don't think we talked about

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660
and um I don't think we talked about
 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.420
and um I don't think we talked about
failure enough in science and medicine

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430
failure enough in science and medicine
 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.400
failure enough in science and medicine
you know all the things that work

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410
you know all the things that work
 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.959
you know all the things that work
there's a lot of things that don't work

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969
there's a lot of things that don't work
 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.910
there's a lot of things that don't work
and so this guy who invented this saw

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920
and so this guy who invented this saw
 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.880
and so this guy who invented this saw
when he tried it out it was spinning so

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890
when he tried it out it was spinning so
 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.529
when he tried it out it was spinning so
fast that he took off his assistants

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539
fast that he took off his assistants
 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.510

heaven oops it never got out of
 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.440
heaven oops it never got out of
prototype phase so I had to recreate it

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450
prototype phase so I had to recreate it
 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.730
prototype phase so I had to recreate it
for my youtube channel

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740
for my youtube channel
 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.120
for my youtube channel
now when you in those old days when they

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130
now when you in those old days when they
 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.990
now when you in those old days when they
didn't have antibiotics and antiseptic

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000
didn't have antibiotics and antiseptic
 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.450
didn't have antibiotics and antiseptic
and right yeah when they saw someone's

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460
and right yeah when they saw someone's
 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.120
and right yeah when they saw someone's
leg off or something like that how many

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130
leg off or something like that how many
 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.480
leg off or something like that how many
times those people live well you could

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490
times those people live well you could
 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.280
times those people live well you could
pull through the operation that was one

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290
pull through the operation that was one
 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.719
pull through the operation that was one
part of it but then of course you could

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729
part of it but then of course you could
 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.969
part of it but then of course you could
die a post-operative infection yeah so

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979
die a post-operative infection yeah so
 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.100
die a post-operative infection yeah so

watch now right you know we could say
you know and when I sent you my book I I

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250
you know and when I sent you my book I I
 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.189
you know and when I sent you my book I I
signed it and I said I thought that

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:24.199
signed it and I said I thought that

00:13:23.879 --> 00:13:23.889
shows that the knife he's gonna use and
 

00:13:23.889 --> 00:13:26.699
shows that the knife he's gonna use and
he says to prepare her soul for death

00:13:26.699 --> 00:13:26.709
he says to prepare her soul for death
 

00:13:26.709 --> 00:13:28.949
he says to prepare her soul for death
but this isn't very confidence inspired

00:13:28.949 --> 00:13:28.959
but this isn't very confidence inspired
 

00:13:28.959 --> 00:13:30.600
but this isn't very confidence inspired
any doctors listening don't tell your

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:30.610
any doctors listening don't tell your
 

00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:32.100
any doctors listening don't tell your
patients to prepare their soul for death

00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:32.110
patients to prepare their soul for death
 

00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:35.939
patients to prepare their soul for death
and and she does survive and she talks

00:13:35.939 --> 00:13:35.949
and and she does survive and she talks
 

00:13:35.949 --> 00:13:38.519
and and she does survive and she talks
about how it's so vascular that the

00:13:38.519 --> 00:13:38.529
about how it's so vascular that the
 

00:13:38.529 --> 00:13:40.979
about how it's so vascular that the
blood blinds him at one point and so

00:13:40.979 --> 00:13:40.989
blood blinds him at one point and so
 

00:13:40.989 --> 00:13:42.600
blood blinds him at one point and so
what do you think I can't get worse he

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:42.610
what do you think I can't get worse he
 

00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:45.720
what do you think I can't get worse he
can't see and he's under on she is under

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:45.730
can't see and he's under on she is under
 

00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:47.549
can't see and he's under on she is under
his hand for an hour and a half oh my

00:13:47.549 --> 00:13:47.559
his hand for an hour and a half oh my
 

00:13:47.559 --> 00:13:50.309
his hand for an hour and a half oh my
god away and she survives she ends up

00:13:50.309 --> 00:13:50.319
god away and she survives she ends up
 

00:13:50.319 --> 00:13:52.799
god away and she survives she ends up
living a long and somewhat happy life

00:13:52.799 --> 00:13:52.809
living a long and somewhat happy life
 

00:13:52.809 --> 00:13:53.850
living a long and somewhat happy life
I'm sure she had a lot of nightmares

00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:53.860
I'm sure she had a lot of nightmares
 

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:55.919
I'm sure she had a lot of nightmares
yeah there we see so do they tie this

00:13:55.919 --> 00:13:55.929
yeah there we see so do they tie this
 

00:13:55.929 --> 00:13:57.569
yeah there we see so do they tie this
woman down like how did they oh yeah

00:13:57.569 --> 00:13:57.579
woman down like how did they oh yeah
 

00:13:57.579 --> 00:13:58.650
woman down like how did they oh yeah
they would have definitely had to

00:13:58.650 --> 00:13:58.660
they would have definitely had to
 

00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:00.989
they would have definitely had to
restrain her I mean oh people were

00:14:00.989 --> 00:14:00.999
restrain her I mean oh people were
 

00:14:00.999 --> 00:14:03.629
restrain her I mean oh people were
probably a little bit stronger or more

00:14:03.629 --> 00:14:03.639
probably a little bit stronger or more
 

00:14:03.639 --> 00:14:05.729
probably a little bit stronger or more
able to adapt to pain than we are but

00:14:05.729 --> 00:14:05.739
able to adapt to pain than we are but
 

00:14:05.739 --> 00:14:07.559
able to adapt to pain than we are but
nonetheless there would have been some

00:14:07.559 --> 00:14:07.569
nonetheless there would have been some
 

00:14:07.569 --> 00:14:10.350
nonetheless there would have been some
pretty heavy what year was this that was

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:10.360
pretty heavy what year was this that was
 

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:13.139
pretty heavy what year was this that was
in the 1840s do we know when cancer

00:14:13.139 --> 00:14:13.149
in the 1840s do we know when cancer
 

00:14:13.149 --> 00:14:16.109
in the 1840s do we know when cancer
became common or was it always common in

00:14:16.109 --> 00:14:16.119
became common or was it always common in
 

00:14:16.119 --> 00:14:17.220
became common or was it always common in
humans yeah that's that's a good

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:17.230
humans yeah that's that's a good
 

00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:19.139
humans yeah that's that's a good
question the oldest archaeological

00:14:19.139 --> 00:14:19.149
question the oldest archaeological
 

00:14:19.149 --> 00:14:22.259
question the oldest archaeological
record I believe is 2,000 years old of

00:14:22.259 --> 00:14:22.269
record I believe is 2,000 years old of
 

00:14:22.269 --> 00:14:25.199
record I believe is 2,000 years old of
metastatic cancers so it's older than

00:14:25.199 --> 00:14:25.209
metastatic cancers so it's older than
 

00:14:25.209 --> 00:14:28.799
metastatic cancers so it's older than
you think they're diagnosing it for for

00:14:28.799 --> 00:14:28.809
you think they're diagnosing it for for
 

00:14:28.809 --> 00:14:30.449
you think they're diagnosing it for for
centuries and centuries I'm not really

00:14:30.449 --> 00:14:30.459
centuries and centuries I'm not really
 

00:14:30.459 --> 00:14:32.789
centuries and centuries I'm not really
an expert in history of cancer but it is

00:14:32.789 --> 00:14:32.799
an expert in history of cancer but it is
 

00:14:32.799 --> 00:14:36.600
an expert in history of cancer but it is
around and so with breast cancer you

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:36.610
around and so with breast cancer you
 

00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:38.069
around and so with breast cancer you
know probably by the time it got to the

00:14:38.069 --> 00:14:38.079
know probably by the time it got to the
 

00:14:38.079 --> 00:14:39.689
know probably by the time it got to the
stage of mastectomy it probably would

00:14:39.689 --> 00:14:39.699
stage of mastectomy it probably would
 

00:14:39.699 --> 00:14:41.789
stage of mastectomy it probably would
have spread if you think about like you

00:14:41.789 --> 00:14:41.799
have spread if you think about like you
 

00:14:41.799 --> 00:14:43.650
have spread if you think about like you
know it being visible to the naked eye

00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:43.660
know it being visible to the naked eye
 

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:46.230
know it being visible to the naked eye
but yet she survived she did survive and

00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:46.240
but yet she survived she did survive and
 

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:47.850
but yet she survived she did survive and
so then you have to question whether she

00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:47.860
so then you have to question whether she
 

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:49.530
so then you have to question whether she
had breast cancer or maybe it was some

00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:49.540
had breast cancer or maybe it was some
 

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:51.749
had breast cancer or maybe it was some
kind of like yeah maybe a cyst and she

00:14:51.749 --> 00:14:51.759
kind of like yeah maybe a cyst and she
 

00:14:51.759 --> 00:14:54.150
kind of like yeah maybe a cyst and she
went through that for that yeah and

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:54.160
went through that for that yeah and
 

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:56.879
went through that for that yeah and
again before antiseptics before Lister

00:14:56.879 --> 00:14:56.889
again before antiseptics before Lister
 

00:14:56.889 --> 00:14:59.280
again before antiseptics before Lister
comes on on and comes up with germ

00:14:59.280 --> 00:14:59.290
comes on on and comes up with germ
 

00:14:59.290 --> 00:15:00.600
comes on on and comes up with germ
fighting techniques this would have been

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:00.610
fighting techniques this would have been
 

00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:02.639
fighting techniques this would have been
so dangerous because you have this open

00:15:02.639 --> 00:15:02.649
so dangerous because you have this open
 

00:15:02.649 --> 00:15:05.340
so dangerous because you have this open
cavity in windows and so Joseph Lister

00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:05.350
cavity in windows and so Joseph Lister
 

00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:07.289
cavity in windows and so Joseph Lister
when he comes up with his antiseptic

00:15:07.289 --> 00:15:07.299
when he comes up with his antiseptic
 

00:15:07.299 --> 00:15:08.850
when he comes up with his antiseptic
techniques he actually performs a

00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:08.860
techniques he actually performs a
 

00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:10.889
techniques he actually performs a
mastectomy on his sister on his dining

00:15:10.889 --> 00:15:10.899
mastectomy on his sister on his dining
 

00:15:10.899 --> 00:15:14.129
mastectomy on his sister on his dining
room table Oh which and she survives and

00:15:14.129 --> 00:15:14.139
room table Oh which and she survives and
 

00:15:14.139 --> 00:15:15.479
room table Oh which and she survives and
that's in the book see this this would

00:15:15.479 --> 00:15:15.489
that's in the book see this this would
 

00:15:15.489 --> 00:15:17.100
that's in the book see this this would
be a great movie don't you think yeah I

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:17.110
be a great movie don't you think yeah I
 

00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:18.970
be a great movie don't you think yeah I
do think it would be a great movie

00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:18.980
do think it would be a great movie
 

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:21.009
do think it would be a great movie
it's like it would be a great movie for

00:15:21.009 --> 00:15:21.019
it's like it would be a great movie for
 

00:15:21.019 --> 00:15:23.530
it's like it would be a great movie for
the Coen brothers yeah you know because

00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:23.540
the Coen brothers yeah you know because
 

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:26.019
the Coen brothers yeah you know because
it's so chaos Ville you know and all

00:15:26.019 --> 00:15:26.029
it's so chaos Ville you know and all
 

00:15:26.029 --> 00:15:29.470
it's so chaos Ville you know and all
that kind of readiness yeah I do good

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:29.480
that kind of readiness yeah I do good
 

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:31.569
that kind of readiness yeah I do good
period pieces too yeah cuz they could

00:15:31.569 --> 00:15:31.579
period pieces too yeah cuz they could
 

00:15:31.579 --> 00:15:38.319
period pieces too yeah cuz they could
make it more entertaining that world but

00:15:38.319 --> 00:15:38.329
make it more entertaining that world but
 

00:15:38.329 --> 00:15:40.509
make it more entertaining that world but
this guy with the face where they cut

00:15:40.509 --> 00:15:40.519
this guy with the face where they cut
 

00:15:40.519 --> 00:15:42.129
this guy with the face where they cut
that tumor out of it say so for twenty

00:15:42.129 --> 00:15:42.139
that tumor out of it say so for twenty
 

00:15:42.139 --> 00:15:43.960
that tumor out of it say so for twenty
four minutes that's all it took to cut

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:43.970
four minutes that's all it took to cut
 

00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:45.789
four minutes that's all it took to cut
that thing out of his face in that that

00:15:45.789 --> 00:15:45.799
that thing out of his face in that that
 

00:15:45.799 --> 00:15:47.530
that thing out of his face in that that
case yeah and remember a course it

00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:47.540
case yeah and remember a course it
 

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:49.329
case yeah and remember a course it
depended on the skill of your surgeon so

00:15:49.329 --> 00:15:49.339
depended on the skill of your surgeon so
 

00:15:49.339 --> 00:15:51.549
depended on the skill of your surgeon so
he goes to a very good surgeon named

00:15:51.549 --> 00:15:51.559
he goes to a very good surgeon named
 

00:15:51.559 --> 00:15:53.979
he goes to a very good surgeon named
James Syme but there are there's a story

00:15:53.979 --> 00:15:53.989
James Syme but there are there's a story
 

00:15:53.989 --> 00:15:57.309
James Syme but there are there's a story
so going back to penises there's

00:15:57.309 --> 00:15:57.319
so going back to penises there's
 

00:15:57.319 --> 00:15:59.379
so going back to penises there's
lithotomy is the removal of the stone

00:15:59.379 --> 00:15:59.389
lithotomy is the removal of the stone
 

00:15:59.389 --> 00:16:01.989
lithotomy is the removal of the stone
which you saw kind of a demonstration

00:16:01.989 --> 00:16:01.999
which you saw kind of a demonstration
 

00:16:01.999 --> 00:16:04.659
which you saw kind of a demonstration
there um and it was incredibly painful

00:16:04.659 --> 00:16:04.669
there um and it was incredibly painful
 

00:16:04.669 --> 00:16:06.309
there um and it was incredibly painful
so if they stuck a rod on the penis and

00:16:06.309 --> 00:16:06.319
so if they stuck a rod on the penis and
 

00:16:06.319 --> 00:16:07.359
so if they stuck a rod on the penis and
they caught through the scrotum they

00:16:07.359 --> 00:16:07.369
they caught through the scrotum they
 

00:16:07.369 --> 00:16:09.220
they caught through the scrotum they
removed the stone and of course there

00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:09.230
removed the stone and of course there
 

00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:10.749
removed the stone and of course there
was no pain medication and it was just

00:16:10.749 --> 00:16:10.759
was no pain medication and it was just
 

00:16:10.759 --> 00:16:14.019
was no pain medication and it was just
awful did they drink you know it's kind

00:16:14.019 --> 00:16:14.029
awful did they drink you know it's kind
 

00:16:14.029 --> 00:16:15.669
awful did they drink you know it's kind
of a myth because of course drinking

00:16:15.669 --> 00:16:15.679
of a myth because of course drinking
 

00:16:15.679 --> 00:16:18.369
of a myth because of course drinking
within your blood hmm but someone asked

00:16:18.369 --> 00:16:18.379
within your blood hmm but someone asked
 

00:16:18.379 --> 00:16:20.979
within your blood hmm but someone asked
me they said I heard that surgeons would

00:16:20.979 --> 00:16:20.989
me they said I heard that surgeons would
 

00:16:20.989 --> 00:16:23.139
me they said I heard that surgeons would
punch the patient out and I was like

00:16:23.139 --> 00:16:23.149
punch the patient out and I was like
 

00:16:23.149 --> 00:16:26.439
punch the patient out and I was like
well you'd be really good to knock

00:16:26.439 --> 00:16:26.449
well you'd be really good to knock
 

00:16:26.449 --> 00:16:28.059
well you'd be really good to knock
someone out on a first punch and of

00:16:28.059 --> 00:16:28.069
someone out on a first punch and of
 

00:16:28.069 --> 00:16:29.710
someone out on a first punch and of
course he'd do more damage you could do

00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:29.720
course he'd do more damage you could do
 

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:30.879
course he'd do more damage you could do
a lot of damage to the head that's

00:16:30.879 --> 00:16:30.889
a lot of damage to the head that's
 

00:16:30.889 --> 00:16:33.009
a lot of damage to the head that's
definitely didn't happen unless someone

00:16:33.009 --> 00:16:33.019
definitely didn't happen unless someone
 

00:16:33.019 --> 00:16:34.569
definitely didn't happen unless someone
can prove me wrong maybe there's like a

00:16:34.569 --> 00:16:34.579
can prove me wrong maybe there's like a
 

00:16:34.579 --> 00:16:36.879
can prove me wrong maybe there's like a
weird example but I've never come across

00:16:36.879 --> 00:16:36.889
weird example but I've never come across
 

00:16:36.889 --> 00:16:40.210
weird example but I've never come across
that um so so it was kind of it was you

00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:40.220
that um so so it was kind of it was you
 

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:43.600
that um so so it was kind of it was you
and the surgeon and with the lithotomy

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:43.610
and the surgeon and with the lithotomy
 

00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:45.729
and the surgeon and with the lithotomy
it takes about a good surgeon it took
