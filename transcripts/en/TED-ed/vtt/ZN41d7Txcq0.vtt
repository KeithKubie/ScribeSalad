00:00:06.104 --> 00:00:07.858
When we watch a film or a play,

00:00:07.882 --> 00:00:09.000
we know that the actors

00:00:09.024 --> 00:00:11.032
probably learned
their lines from a script,

00:00:11.056 --> 00:00:14.326
which essentially tells them
what to say and when to say it.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.232
A piece of written music
operates on exactly the same principle.

00:00:18.755 --> 00:00:20.091
In a very basic sense,

00:00:20.115 --> 00:00:23.179
it tells a performer what to play
and when to play it.

00:00:23.901 --> 00:00:26.425
Aesthetically speaking,
there's a world of difference

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:29.379
between, say, Beethoven and Justin Bieber,

00:00:29.403 --> 00:00:30.642
but both artists have used

00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:33.148
the same building blocks
to create their music:

00:00:33.172 --> 00:00:34.226
notes.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.877
And although the end result
can sound quite complicated,

00:00:36.901 --> 00:00:40.415
the logic behind musical notes
is actually pretty straightforward.

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:41.447
Let's take a look

00:00:41.471 --> 00:00:43.662
at the foundational
elements to music notation

00:00:43.686 --> 00:00:46.628
and how they interact
to create a work of art.

00:00:47.684 --> 00:00:51.345
Music is written on five parallel lines
that go across the page.

00:00:51.822 --> 00:00:53.901
These five lines are called a staff,

00:00:53.925 --> 00:00:56.194
and a staff operates on two axes:

00:00:56.218 --> 00:00:57.493
up and down

00:00:57.517 --> 00:00:58.721
and left to right.

00:00:59.258 --> 00:01:01.179
The up-and-down axis tells the performer

00:01:01.203 --> 00:01:03.912
the pitch of the note
or what note to play,

00:01:03.936 --> 00:01:05.437
and the left-to-right axis

00:01:05.461 --> 00:01:07.531
tells the performer the rhythm of the note

00:01:07.555 --> 00:01:08.936
or when to play it.

00:01:09.436 --> 00:01:10.989
Let's start with pitch.

00:01:11.013 --> 00:01:13.037
To help us out,
we're going to use a piano,

00:01:13.061 --> 00:01:16.388
but this system works for pretty much
any instrument you can think of.

00:01:17.186 --> 00:01:18.805
In the Western music tradition,

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:22.226
pitches are named after
the first seven letters of the alphabet,

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:23.693
A, B, C,

00:01:23.717 --> 00:01:25.678
D, E, F, and G.

00:01:26.446 --> 00:01:28.595
After that, the cycle repeats itself:

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.634
A, B, C, D, E, F, G,

00:01:30.658 --> 00:01:31.992
A, B, C, D, E, F, G,

00:01:32.016 --> 00:01:33.079
and so on.

00:01:33.564 --> 00:01:35.660
But how do these pitches get their names?

00:01:36.199 --> 00:01:38.269
Well, for example, if you played an F

00:01:38.293 --> 00:01:39.484
and then played another F

00:01:39.508 --> 00:01:41.192
higher or lower on the piano,

00:01:41.216 --> 00:01:43.264
you'd notice that they sound
pretty similar

00:01:43.288 --> 00:01:45.064
compared to, say, a B.

00:01:45.738 --> 00:01:46.955
Going back to the staff,

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.649
every line and every space
between two lines

00:01:49.673 --> 00:01:51.325
represents a separate pitch.

00:01:52.051 --> 00:01:55.107
If we put a note on one of these lines
or one of these spaces,

00:01:55.131 --> 00:01:57.658
we're telling a performer
to play that pitch.

00:01:57.682 --> 00:02:00.009
The higher up on the staff
a note is placed,

00:02:00.033 --> 00:02:01.412
the higher the pitch.

00:02:01.436 --> 00:02:03.913
But there are obviously
many, many more pitches

00:02:03.937 --> 00:02:06.587
than the nine that these
lines and spaces gives us.

00:02:06.611 --> 00:02:08.140
A grand piano, for example,

00:02:08.164 --> 00:02:09.818
can play 88 separate notes.

00:02:10.281 --> 00:02:13.281
So how do we condense
88 notes onto a single staff?

00:02:13.774 --> 00:02:15.981
We use something called a clef,

00:02:16.005 --> 00:02:18.974
a weird-looking figure
placed at the beginning of the staff,

00:02:18.998 --> 00:02:20.678
which acts like a reference point,

00:02:20.702 --> 00:02:22.804
telling you that a particular
line or space

00:02:22.828 --> 00:02:25.582
corresponds to a specific note
on your instrument.

00:02:25.606 --> 00:02:27.964
If we want to play notes
that aren't on the staff,

00:02:27.988 --> 00:02:30.111
we kind of cheat and draw
extra little lines

00:02:30.135 --> 00:02:31.354
called ledger lines

00:02:31.378 --> 00:02:33.076
and place the notes on them.

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.449
If we have to draw so many ledger lines
that it gets confusing,

00:02:36.473 --> 00:02:38.748
then we need to change
to a different clef.

00:02:39.872 --> 00:02:42.206
As for telling a performer
when to play the notes,

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.101
two main elements control this:

00:02:44.125 --> 00:02:46.043
the beat and the rhythm.

00:02:46.473 --> 00:02:48.053
The beat of a piece of music is,

00:02:48.077 --> 00:02:50.000
by itself, kind of boring.

00:02:50.024 --> 00:02:51.713
It sounds like this.

00:02:52.348 --> 00:02:53.577
(Ticking)

00:02:54.173 --> 00:02:55.649
Notice that it doesn't change,

00:02:55.673 --> 00:02:57.961
it just plugs along quite happily.

00:02:57.985 --> 00:02:59.030
It can go slow

00:03:00.546 --> 00:03:01.625
or fast

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:03.910
or whatever you like, really.

00:03:03.934 --> 00:03:06.604
The point is that just
like the second hand on a clock

00:03:06.628 --> 00:03:09.172
divides one minute into sixty seconds,

00:03:09.196 --> 00:03:12.185
with each second just as long
as every other second,

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:13.974
the beat divides a piece of music

00:03:13.998 --> 00:03:17.092
into little fragments of time
that are all the same length:

00:03:17.116 --> 00:03:18.138
beats.

00:03:18.826 --> 00:03:20.550
With a steady beat as a foundation,

00:03:20.574 --> 00:03:22.190
we can add rhythm to our pitches,

00:03:22.214 --> 00:03:24.366
and that's when music
really starts to happen.

00:03:25.413 --> 00:03:27.032
This is a quarter note.

00:03:27.056 --> 00:03:28.769
It's the most basic unit of rhythm,

00:03:28.793 --> 00:03:30.271
and it's worth one beat.

00:03:30.749 --> 00:03:33.292
This is a half note,
and it's worth two beats.

00:03:33.316 --> 00:03:35.413
This whole note here is worth four beats,

00:03:35.437 --> 00:03:37.354
and these little guys are eighth notes,

00:03:37.378 --> 00:03:38.713
worth half a beat each.

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:41.829
"Great," you say, "what does that mean?"

00:03:41.853 --> 00:03:44.527
You might have noticed
that across the length of a staff,

00:03:44.551 --> 00:03:47.215
there are little lines dividing it
into small sections.

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:48.926
These are bar lines

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.355
and we refer to each section as a bar.

00:03:51.955 --> 00:03:53.718
At the beginning of a piece of music,

00:03:53.742 --> 00:03:54.843
just after the clef,

00:03:54.867 --> 00:03:56.939
is something called the time signature,

00:03:56.963 --> 00:03:59.985
which tells a performer
how many beats are in each bar.

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:02.154
This says there are two beats in each bar,

00:04:02.178 --> 00:04:03.500
this says there are three,

00:04:03.524 --> 00:04:05.572
this one four, and so on.

00:04:05.596 --> 00:04:07.861
The bottom number tells
us what kind of note

00:04:07.885 --> 00:04:10.332
is to be used as the basic
unit for the beat.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.488
One corresponds to a whole note,

00:04:12.512 --> 00:04:13.618
two to a half note,

00:04:13.642 --> 00:04:15.546
four to a quarter note,

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:17.527
and eight to an eighth note, and so on.

00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.305
So this time signature here

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:22.101
tells us that there are four
quarter notes in each bar,

00:04:22.125 --> 00:04:24.053
one, two, three, four;

00:04:24.077 --> 00:04:25.617
one, two, three, four,

00:04:25.641 --> 00:04:26.697
and so on.

00:04:27.173 --> 00:04:28.337
But like I said before,

00:04:28.361 --> 00:04:29.800
if we just stick to the beat,

00:04:29.824 --> 00:04:31.355
it gets kind of boring,

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:34.242
so we'll replace some quarter notes
with different rhythms.

00:04:34.913 --> 00:04:36.913
Notice that even though
the number of notes

00:04:36.937 --> 00:04:38.402
in each bar has changed,

00:04:38.426 --> 00:04:40.998
the total number of beats
in each bar hasn't.

00:04:42.112 --> 00:04:45.350
So, what does our musical
creation sound like?

00:04:45.374 --> 00:04:47.736
(Music)

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.052
Eh, sounds okay, but maybe
a bit thin, right?

00:04:51.076 --> 00:04:53.969
Let's add another instrument
with its own pitch and rhythm.

00:04:54.435 --> 00:04:56.611
Now it's sounding like music.

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:00.766
Sure, it takes some practice
to get used to reading it quickly

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:02.798
and playing what we see on our instrument,

00:05:02.822 --> 00:05:04.584
but, with a bit of time and patience,

00:05:04.608 --> 00:05:06.355
you could be the next Beethoven

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:08.484
or Justin Bieber.
