00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.588
We're done working with exponents for now, but we'll come back to them later.

00:00:03.676 --> 00:00:07.786
Let's look at some other ways that we can use decimals. We're going to look at

00:00:07.798 --> 00:00:11.502
decimals and percents. Decimals and percents are often used in currency and in

00:00:11.514 --> 00:00:15.344
commercial business. We can buy shoes, sweaters, or electronics on sale. And we

00:00:15.356 --> 00:00:18.906
often want to know how much does something actually cost. By the end of this

00:00:18.918 --> 00:00:23.225
segment, you'll be able to find out how much an item cost, like a new pair of

00:00:23.237 --> 00:00:27.630
shoes. So, here's the problem that we're going to have you answer and come back

00:00:27.642 --> 00:00:32.030
to later. A pair of shoes costs $80 and is on sale for 44% off, what will you

00:00:32.042 --> 00:00:36.485
pay for the shoes? The first thing we need to recognize is this problem has a

00:00:36.497 --> 00:00:41.144
percent in it. Percent literally means per 100 or out of a 100. I can write

00:00:41.144 --> 00:00:42.677
44 percent another way.

00:00:41.144 --> 00:00:50.253
I know it's 44 out of 100 or 44 divided by 100. 44 divided by 100 is the same

00:00:50.265 --> 00:00:57.782
thing as 0.44. Here's a grid of a 100 squares, or I have 1 block. Of these 100

00:00:57.794 --> 00:01:05.814
pieces, I'm going to have 44 of them. So, I'd have 10, 20, 30, 40, 44 blocks out

00:01:05.826 --> 00:01:15.136
of a 100 or 0.44 and that's this written as a decimal, 0.44. Okay, here are some

00:01:15.148 --> 00:01:19.518
other percents. I can have 23%, 6%, or 200%.

00:01:19.524 --> 00:01:24.997
I'm going to convert these percents to decimals. Sometimes, we need to convert

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:30.478
percents to decimals in order to use them in problems or to multiply. Okay, so

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.905
let's use these 100 blocks to help us out. Here, I have 23 squares shaded out of

00:01:35.917 --> 00:01:42.530
100. So, 23 divided by 100. As a decimal, that's 0.23. For 6%, I'm going to have

00:01:42.542 --> 00:01:47.512
6 blocks out of a 100. So, I have 6 blocks out of a 100 or 6 hundredths, 0.06

00:01:47.632 --> 00:01:53.515
Notice that 6 has to be in the hundredths spot. For 200%, I know that I have to

00:01:53.527 --> 00:01:59.407
do something different. I can color in 100 of the squares in this 1 block. So, I

00:01:59.419 --> 00:02:05.624
have a 100 blocks shaded, but I need 200%. This is only a hundred out of a

00:02:05.636 --> 00:02:11.618
hundred, that's a 100%. 200 percent means 200 out of 100. I know one of these

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:18.379
squares represents a hundredth, so I have 200 hundred hundredths, or I just have

00:02:18.391 --> 00:02:24.300
2 or 2 blocks. Okay. There's actually a pattern here that we want to notice.

00:02:24.423 --> 00:02:30.340
Let's look closely at the decimal places. Here in 23%, the decimal is here and

00:02:30.352 --> 00:02:36.279
then it ended up here. For 6%, the decimal started here and ended up here. For

00:02:36.279 --> 00:02:40.316
200%, the decimal started here and ended up there.

00:02:40.316 --> 00:02:45.120
Let's have a quiz behind what's going on with this pattern. What do you notice?
