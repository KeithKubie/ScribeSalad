00:00:04.067 --> 00:00:05.567
Radtke: Hi.
My name's Autumn.

00:00:05.567 --> 00:00:07.167
And I want to take
a quick second

00:00:07.167 --> 00:00:09.367
to talk to you
about our Android application

00:00:09.367 --> 00:00:10.834
Geodelic.

00:00:10.834 --> 00:00:14.300
Geodelic is a location-based
discovery platform

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.634
that allows users quickly
and easily discover

00:00:16.634 --> 00:00:20.133
the most relevant information
wherever they are.

00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:23.434
Um, I want to give you
a quick demo of the application.

00:00:23.434 --> 00:00:25.234
This is the user interface.

00:00:25.234 --> 00:00:27.701
When you launch the app,
you don't have to do anything.

00:00:27.701 --> 00:00:31.534
It immediately works
and discovers your surroundings.

00:00:31.534 --> 00:00:34.133
Um, you can easily
and quickly filter

00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:35.734
based on what
you're looking for.

00:00:35.734 --> 00:00:38.734
So maybe--sorry--
maybe you're hungry.

00:00:38.734 --> 00:00:42.234
Maybe you need a caffeine fix
or you're looking for your bank.

00:00:42.234 --> 00:00:44.100
You can filter based
on any of the amenities

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.968
you're currently looking for.

00:00:45.968 --> 00:00:48.033
So here we have
Bank of America.

00:00:48.033 --> 00:00:49.167
Because it's a bank,

00:00:49.167 --> 00:00:51.467
maybe you want to connect
to CNN.

00:00:51.467 --> 00:00:52.934
Maybe you want to get
stock reviews

00:00:52.934 --> 00:00:54.434
about that location.

00:00:54.434 --> 00:00:56.033
And so whatever
would be relevant

00:00:56.033 --> 00:00:57.534
about that point of interest,

00:00:57.534 --> 00:01:01.300
we want to deliver to you
in one or two clicks.

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.334
The carousel interface
helps us in a lot of ways

00:01:08.334 --> 00:01:12.000
because the GPS technology
is not always super accurate.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.334
So the carousel,

00:01:13.334 --> 00:01:15.334
if we're not spot on--
if we can't always find

00:01:15.334 --> 00:01:18.534
exactly where you are--
you're just a swipe away

00:01:18.534 --> 00:01:21.033
from finding the place
that you're interested in.

00:01:21.033 --> 00:01:24.400
And it also represents
what someone does in real life

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.100
if they're looking around
at the things around them.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.000
So we find that the carousel
really helps the user interact

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.701
in a way that's interesting.

00:01:31.701 --> 00:01:34.467
We also have several views
of that information.

00:01:34.467 --> 00:01:36.868
We have a map view

00:01:36.868 --> 00:01:40.200
so that you can see
where these places are located

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.901
on an actual map.

00:01:41.901 --> 00:01:44.667
We also have a list view.

00:01:44.667 --> 00:01:47.367
For some people,
it's easier to filter that way.

00:01:47.367 --> 00:01:49.501
And then you can get
"click to call,"

00:01:49.501 --> 00:01:52.501
"click to route"
about any of these places.

00:01:55.968 --> 00:01:58.400
And so I can easily
just make a call

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.434
to those people.

00:01:59.434 --> 00:02:04.234
Maybe I want to make
a reservation.

00:02:04.234 --> 00:02:06.968
And we also have these widgets
down here, which you can see.

00:02:06.968 --> 00:02:10.234
Menus. OpenTable.
Nutritional information.

00:02:10.234 --> 00:02:12.033
So we dynamically
assemble widgets

00:02:12.033 --> 00:02:15.267
that we think will be relevant
to the place you are.

00:02:15.267 --> 00:02:16.734
Like I said,
if it's a restaurant,

00:02:16.734 --> 00:02:18.133
maybe you want to get
what's on the menu

00:02:18.133 --> 00:02:19.267
or make a reservation.

00:02:19.267 --> 00:02:20.701
If you're at
the grocery store,

00:02:20.701 --> 00:02:22.200
we'll give you recipes,

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.300
we'll give you
a calorie counter.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.667
Maybe you need to make
a vegan dish.

00:02:26.667 --> 00:02:30.267
So we reorganize information
based on your context.

00:02:30.267 --> 00:02:32.601
We get your context
from where you are.

00:02:32.601 --> 00:02:34.467
And we think that that's the--
that's the pillar

00:02:34.467 --> 00:02:36.801
of--of what your circumstances
might be.

00:02:36.801 --> 00:02:39.167
If you're at a cafe,
we immediately direct you

00:02:39.167 --> 00:02:41.767
to &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; content,
Perez Hilton,

00:02:41.767 --> 00:02:43.434
'cause we think
you might have some time.

00:02:43.434 --> 00:02:45.167
You might want to do
some reading.

00:02:45.167 --> 00:02:47.667
And so the idea here
is to make it quick and easy

00:02:47.667 --> 00:02:49.901
for the user
to access information

00:02:49.901 --> 00:02:51.934
based on their context.

00:02:51.934 --> 00:02:53.701
Where in other location-based
services,

00:02:53.701 --> 00:02:55.367
they're really focused
on the map

00:02:55.367 --> 00:02:57.367
and navigating
from place to place,

00:02:57.367 --> 00:02:59.734
we're really about navigating
the information

00:02:59.734 --> 00:03:01.968
that's relevant to a place.

00:03:01.968 --> 00:03:04.434
And we think Android
is--is the best platform

00:03:04.434 --> 00:03:07.701
to begin doing this on,
uh, for a lot of reasons.

00:03:07.701 --> 00:03:10.067
Um, open development
and in Java

00:03:10.067 --> 00:03:11.868
makes it easy
to get great talent

00:03:11.868 --> 00:03:14.000
to make great applications
like this.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Um, from a distribution
perspective,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.634
you've got the opportunity work
on multiple devices.

00:03:19.634 --> 00:03:22.501
Um, it's easy for the consumer
to get the application.

00:03:22.501 --> 00:03:24.934
They don't have to sync it
to another device.

00:03:24.934 --> 00:03:27.000
It also--from a developer's
perspective--

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.200
is easy for us to push
new updates,

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.567
um, as new builds come out.

00:03:31.567 --> 00:03:35.133
The opportunity to be able
to run multiple applications,

00:03:35.133 --> 00:03:36.801
um, cuts out
the start-up time.

00:03:36.801 --> 00:03:38.934
So when you go back
into the environment,

00:03:38.934 --> 00:03:41.133
it's much quicker
and much more receptive,

00:03:41.133 --> 00:03:43.033
which is what you really want
as an application.

00:03:43.033 --> 00:03:45.000
You want the people
to keep coming back

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.334
so that you can provide them
this utility.

00:03:47.334 --> 00:03:49.234
And so we think Geodelic
is going to be part

00:03:49.234 --> 00:03:52.300
of the next wave
of location-based services

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.501
on the mobile platforms.

00:03:54.501 --> 00:03:57.067
So a little bit about Geodelic
as a company.

00:03:57.067 --> 00:03:59.400
Uh, we were founded
over a year ago

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.734
by a guy by the name
of Rahul Sonnad,

00:04:01.734 --> 00:04:03.868
who's been in the business
for a long time.

00:04:03.868 --> 00:04:05.467
We have, uh,
we're venture backed

00:04:05.467 --> 00:04:07.467
and we're now over 20 people.

00:04:07.467 --> 00:04:10.167
Uh, so we've got some really
great talent involved.

00:04:10.167 --> 00:04:12.667
Um, our CTO
was the chief scientist

00:04:12.667 --> 00:04:15.467
at Shopzilla
for the past six years.

00:04:15.467 --> 00:04:17.300
Um, so we're really confident
that we'll be able

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:20.334
to provide great technology
to the consumer.

00:04:20.334 --> 00:04:23.133
And as far as, uh, potentially
monetizing this,

00:04:23.133 --> 00:04:24.834
um, the application
will be free.

00:04:24.834 --> 00:04:26.067
So we want to get it
in the hands

00:04:26.067 --> 00:04:27.434
of as many users as possible

00:04:27.434 --> 00:04:29.767
and not give them any barriers
to entry.

00:04:29.767 --> 00:04:33.968
And also, we're using partners
like coupons.com, for instance,

00:04:33.968 --> 00:04:37.000
who will distribute timely,
contextual coupons

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.133
into the application

00:04:38.133 --> 00:04:40.467
so that users can take advantage
of that.

00:04:40.467 --> 00:04:43.267
And that's also a monetization
opportunity for us

00:04:43.267 --> 00:04:46.601
as well as content providers
who will share revenue with us

00:04:46.601 --> 00:04:50.300
to distribute their application
in a contextual manner.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.367
So as the application
will be free,

00:04:52.367 --> 00:04:54.667
we will have ads
in the application.

00:04:54.667 --> 00:04:57.367
And our aim is to provide
the ads that don't degrade

00:04:57.367 --> 00:04:58.868
from the experience,

00:04:58.868 --> 00:05:01.968
but are contextually relevant
and add to the user's experience

00:05:01.968 --> 00:05:04.834
so that maybe they can get
a dollar off their sub

00:05:04.834 --> 00:05:06.334
when they're close
to SUBWAY.

00:05:06.334 --> 00:05:07.968
And so that's the advantage
we have

00:05:07.968 --> 00:05:10.067
of knowing where the user is
and being able

00:05:10.067 --> 00:05:12.834
to provide them
with the most utility

00:05:12.834 --> 00:05:15.601
and even be able to provide them
with material value

00:05:15.601 --> 00:05:18.033
while they're using
the application.

00:05:18.033 --> 00:05:19.968
So that's it
for Geodelic for now.

00:05:19.968 --> 00:05:21.868
We're having a great time
at Google I/O

00:05:21.868 --> 00:05:24.167
and can't wait to see you guys
again next year.
