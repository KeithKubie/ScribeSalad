- Jordan Klepper here.

00:00:05.171 --> 00:00:06.439
It's almost Thanksgiving,

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:08.742
our most peaceful
American holiday,

00:00:08.742 --> 00:00:10.276
but in our current
political climate,

00:00:10.276 --> 00:00:12.912 align:start size:88% position:13%
Thanksgiving with family
can be a bit tough.

00:00:12.912 --> 00:00:15.181
Thanksgiving is by far
the most appropriate time

00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:18.184
to change another person's
deeply held core beliefs.

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:19.953
This is the time to pounce,

00:00:19.953 --> 00:00:21.221
find the weakness that lies

00:00:21.221 --> 00:00:23.123
in familial bonds
and tryptophan,

00:00:23.123 --> 00:00:25.125
and finally, win the day.

00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:26.659
Here's some tips.

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:27.961
- [Football Player] Hut! Hut!

00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:29.329
(whistle blows)

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:31.331
- Put the big game
on every channel.

00:00:31.331 --> 00:00:33.099 align:start size:84% position:16%
Make sure everyone
stands for the Anthem,

00:00:33.099 --> 00:00:35.235
regardless of age
or joint health.

00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:36.736 align:start size:84% position:16%
If you trigger them
early and often

00:00:36.736 --> 00:00:37.570
they'll weaken over time.

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.306
(gentle piano music)

00:00:40.306 --> 00:00:41.975
Take every opportunity,

00:00:41.975 --> 00:00:44.044
and inject their small
talk with your big talk.

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:47.280
Hey Cousin Sheila, fuck
your baby's first steps.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.114
Chem trails are real.

00:00:48.114 --> 00:00:50.717
(gentle piano music)

00:00:50.717 --> 00:00:52.018
You'll know they are weakening

00:00:52.018 --> 00:00:54.054
if they say they don't
want to talk politics.

00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:55.922
Let's just enjoy the meal.

00:00:55.922 --> 00:00:58.058
This, this is your moment.

00:00:58.058 --> 00:00:59.025
Throw the entire pumpkin
pie at the wall and shout,

00:00:59.025 --> 00:01:02.395
(pie hits, pie hits again)

00:01:03.563 --> 00:01:04.798
"Politics are the meal!"

Politics are the meal.

00:01:06.699 --> 00:01:08.134

- Every family has that uncle
who ruins every holiday.

00:01:11.271 --> 00:01:13.406 line:0%
I am that holiday uncle.

00:01:13.406 --> 00:01:15.341 line:0%
You, and that holiday uncle.

00:01:15.341 --> 00:01:17.844 line:0%
We, and that holiday uncle.

00:01:17.844 --> 00:01:19.312 line:0%
Happy Thanksgiving.

00:01:19.312 --> 00:01:21.548
(gentle piano music)

00:01:21.548 --> 00:01:22.949
