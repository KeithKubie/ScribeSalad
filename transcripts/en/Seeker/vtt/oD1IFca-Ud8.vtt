00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:05.130
What do catastrophic floods, extratropical
cyclones, debilitating drought, and a massive

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.390
oyster die-off have in common?

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:08.910
Rivers in the sky.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:09.910
No, really.

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:12.869
Rivers in the sky.

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:18.119
Hey waterbabies, it’s Natalia for DNews!

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.109
California is currently in the middle of a
relentless drought, but it might be alleviated

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.480
with a super interesting weather phenomena
called atmospheric rivers -- those rivers

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.900
in the sky I was telling you about.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.270
Atmospheric rivers, or ARs, deliver the bulk
of the precipitation to the state -- on average,

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.310
each one delivers at least one Mississippi
river’s worth of rain -- and they actually

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.580
occur around the the world.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:43.910
ARs form in the tropics when winds from a
cyclone draw moisture into long, narrow bands

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.110
that move ahead of a cold front.

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.820
In their wake, they often bring winds that
can rival hurricane speeds.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:55.330
ARs usually arrive in 4-5 separate plumes
of moisture that are, on average, 2000 kilometers

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.280
in length and up to 1000 kilometers in width.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.360
Because they can bring such monumental amounts
of precipitation, they can cause devastating

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.960
floods, landslides, and even snowstorms when
they reach the mountains.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.470
In California, this rain and snowfall is actually
vital to the state.

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.550
A whopping 30-50% of California’s annual
precipitation is made up of just a few of

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.990
these atmospheric rivers.

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.830
And all 7 floods in the state’s Russian
River from 1997 to 2006 were caused by atmospheric

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:22.830
rivers.

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.140
They are truly a blessing and a curse!

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.390
In fact, California has suffered through many
AR floods.

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.520
In 1861, a flood hit the state that killed
thousands of people and drowned 800,000 cattle.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.950
In 2005 the small coastal town of La Conchita
was in the path of an AR that caused a massive

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.920
landslide that killed 10 people.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.990
And these events and floods are not new developments.

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.070
Research of geologic cores show that the region
has been hit by megastorms causing catastrophic

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.720
floods every 200 years.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:55.030
But it wasn’t until the 1990s, with the
advent of new satellite technology, that scientists

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.450
could truly understand and track these ‘sky
rivers’.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.060
Sidebar -- ARs are also called “the Pineapple
Express,” a term that was coined by newscasters

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.830
in the 1960s after they noticed these recurring,
excessively wet weather events coming from

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:08.850
Hawaii.

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:09.979
Just so you know.

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.110
New research shows that climate change could
make these ARs even more dangerous, as there

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.829
will be increased evaporation of water due
to higher temperatures, leading to larger

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:18.849
ARs.

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:23.400
Some scientists say they may even cause cataclysmic,
extinction level floods.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.189
But ARs are not exclusive to California.

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:28.629
There are 7 to 12 ARs present around the world
at any given time!

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:32.760
There are instances of ARs in the middle of
the United States, North Africa, and Western

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:33.760
Europe.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.890
In fact, in 2015, a monster AR spanning over
8,000 kilometers accompanied Storm Desmond

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.799
that caused flooding in the United Kingdom,
Ireland, and Norway.

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:45.900
And according to scientists, they have been
increasing in frequency in Western Europe

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.219
in recent years.

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:52.279
Aside from crazy weather, ARs can also have
secondary consequences, like killing off oysters.

00:02:52.279 --> 00:02:57.730
In 2011, there was a massive wild Olympia
oyster die-off in Northern California.

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.219
Scientists found that these oysters were sensitive
to low salinity levels caused by excess freshwater

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:08.069
from the 20 ARs that passed through the region
between October 2010 and September 2011.

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:11.780
Although our research couldn’t find any
immediate implications for other sea life,

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.999
it will be interesting to see what other marine
animals may be affected by an increased frequency

00:03:15.999 --> 00:03:17.430
of ARs.

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.910

So, California is still in a drought -- and
that drought is affecting the rest of the

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:34.079
world.

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:35.469
