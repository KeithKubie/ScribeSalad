00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.540
Developed to help protect artwork from the
damages of dust and inspired by gecko feet,

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.860
researchers from Yale developed a non-sticky
plastic sheet that produces enough electrostatic

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:15.210
charge to remove dust from a surface by attaching
it to Micropillar structures.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.590
And an arachnid preserved in iron carbonate
for 305 million years was recently analyzed

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.869
using computed tomography and it turns out
it’s a previously unknown creature that’s

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.750
a lot like a spider.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:27.750
Vsauce!

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:28.750
Kevin here.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.210
This is Mind Blow.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:36.970
The way your brain thinks could be your new
password.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.670
Researchers at Binghamton University have
developed a new brain biometric that uses

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.410
the brain’s response to a series of images.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.379
To identify you with 100 percent accuracy.

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.090
So while wearing an EEG system, a specific
change in voltage at the scalp is recorded

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.440
reacting to images of certain celebrities
or uncommon words and then used as a passcode.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.690
And the images can be changed - which unlike
your fingerprints or retinas - allows you

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.129
to change your brain password.

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.400
The major challenge is translating system
this to a consumer product.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.240
One of the most advanced wind tunnels in the
world is being used to learn the flight secrets

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.270
of birds.

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.540
Drones currently have a hard time stabilizing
in turbulent conditions - so the new wind

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.979
tunnel allows researchers from Stanford University
to analyze how birds react to different turbulence

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:26.979
patterns.

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.149
Bearing in mind the safety of the birds - they
don’t crank up the speed to uncomfortable

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:32.149
levels.

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:36.880
And in the future, more advanced aerial robot
designs will undergo testing in this wind

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:37.880
tunnel.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.899
The Stanford Robotics Lab has created a robotic
mermaid for exploring the ocean.

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:49.070
OceanOne is an underwater humanoid with stereoscopic
vision and force sensors on its hands that

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.540
provide haptic feedback to the pilot - giving
the human a feel for the objects.

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.299
Providing a physical avatar for humans to
dive and study areas of the ocean too dangerous

00:01:58.299 --> 00:01:59.299
for people.

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:03.880
It’s already been used to explore the wreck
of King Louis XIV’s flagship, previously

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.970
out of reach for humans, and has recovered
artifacts.

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.720
AiCure hopes to monitor, track and make sure
patients are taking their medication.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.750
They claim half of all patients don’t take
medication as prescribed - so this app visually

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.110
confirms the proper medication, confirms the
proper user ingests it and does so at the

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.110
proper time.

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.890
It’s customizable and adapts to patient
behavior.

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:32.170
The data can be accessed by medical providers
and can recognize improper or suspicious use.

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:38.410
And they hope this can reduce the reported
$198 billion dollars spent on hospitalizations

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.070
resulting from improper medication use each
year.

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.080
Researchers at the University of California,
Berkeley have charted subregions of the brain

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.770
that respond to different words.

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:54.070
The “semantic system” map displays the
organization of words based on meanings like

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.100
people, time, number, tactile, outdoor or
place.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:03.530
This single brain combines and visualizes
six different people’s word meaning brain

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:04.530
activity.

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.870
Hopefully they can study more subjects from
different cultural upbringing and education

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.810
to see how consistent this brain map really
is.

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:17.230
Ultimately it could help understand language
impairments in diseases such as Alzheimer’s.

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:23.000
Mind Blow #82, uploaded in May 2014, featured
SCiO - a handheld spectrometer that detects

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.880
the chemical makeup of objects - by scanning
them, analyzing the data in the cloud and

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.670
reporting results on a smartphone.

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.710
Well, the sensors and development toolkits
are now rolling out and can analyze carbs,

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:40.810
fat and water in dairy, meat and vegetables
and also the contents of pain relieving pills.

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.160
The prospects for mobile spectrometer technology
include not only eventually building this

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.520
into a smartphone itself - but using it to
detect counterfeit products, compare generic

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.760
and name brand products and also the purity
and differences in drugs.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:00.640
Finally, Eeulume, a company in Norway is developing
a swimming snake robot for subsea maintenance

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.030
and inspection.

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:17.500
I’m gonna leave you with the champion of
real robot battle and as always - thanks for

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.610
watching.

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:32.270
We're all set for auto control.

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:38.600
Roger, Firebird 2.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:45.740
Move to electronic control strip in center
lane.

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.490
You're now under automatic control.

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.380
Hands off steering.

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.230
Ah, this is the life.

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:55.560
Safe, cool, comfortable.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.460
Mind if I smoke a cigar?

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.120
Oh, not with this wonderful air conditioning.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:09.110
Hey, you want some ice cream or a cool drink?

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.030
Orange juice, please.

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:13.970
Me too!

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:18.250
I'm gonna go for the ice cream.

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:26.290
There's automatic sleep control in every bed
and our predigested food is cooked by infrared.
