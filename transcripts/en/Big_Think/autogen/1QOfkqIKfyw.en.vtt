00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:01.550
 
one of the most fascinating things about

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:01.560
one of the most fascinating things about
 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.570
one of the most fascinating things about
creativity is that the most recent

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580
creativity is that the most recent
 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.160
creativity is that the most recent
studies are showing that it's not just

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170
studies are showing that it's not just
 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.650
studies are showing that it's not just
one side of the brain or the other side

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660
one side of the brain or the other side
 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.180
one side of the brain or the other side
of the brain that everybody will tell

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190
of the brain that everybody will tell
 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.370
of the brain that everybody will tell
you it really is the most creative

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380
you it really is the most creative
 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.609
you it really is the most creative
people are using both sides of the brain

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619
people are using both sides of the brain
 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.279
people are using both sides of the brain
together so this is important concept

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289
together so this is important concept
 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.130
together so this is important concept
that the brain is subdivided into two

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140
that the brain is subdivided into two
 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.769
that the brain is subdivided into two
major hemispheres we have two of each

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779
major hemispheres we have two of each
 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.900
major hemispheres we have two of each
structure almost all the structures of

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910
structure almost all the structures of
 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.990
structure almost all the structures of
our brain are paired so the idea is well

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000
our brain are paired so the idea is well
 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.370
our brain are paired so the idea is well
one side of the brain is important for

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380
one side of the brain is important for
 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.720
one side of the brain is important for
certain things and the other side of the

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730
certain things and the other side of the
 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.190
certain things and the other side of the
brain is important for other things and

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200
brain is important for other things and
 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.930
brain is important for other things and
the one thing we can say for sure is yes

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940
the one thing we can say for sure is yes
 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.209
the one thing we can say for sure is yes
language is on the left side of the

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219
language is on the left side of the
 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.549
language is on the left side of the
brain but for creativity it actually

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559
brain but for creativity it actually
 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.220
brain but for creativity it actually
makes more sense to me that with a

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230
makes more sense to me that with a
 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.830
makes more sense to me that with a
function so broad as that you would

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840
function so broad as that you would
 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.380
function so broad as that you would
benefit from having the most crosstalk

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390
benefit from having the most crosstalk
 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.840
benefit from having the most crosstalk
possible between all parts of your brain

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850
possible between all parts of your brain
 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.400
possible between all parts of your brain
in fact that's exactly what the

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410
in fact that's exactly what the
 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.250
in fact that's exactly what the
neuroscience is showing so then once we

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260
neuroscience is showing so then once we
 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.600
neuroscience is showing so then once we
start to understand we're starting to

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610
start to understand we're starting to
 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.610
start to understand we're starting to
understand a little bit about about the

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620
understand a little bit about about the
 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.130
understand a little bit about about the
brain circuits involved in creativity it

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140
brain circuits involved in creativity it
 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.740
brain circuits involved in creativity it
involves a lot the prefrontal cortex as

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750
involves a lot the prefrontal cortex as
 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.050
involves a lot the prefrontal cortex as
you might as you might expect then the

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060
you might as you might expect then the
 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.090
you might as you might expect then the
question is well how do I up my

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100
question is well how do I up my
 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.649
question is well how do I up my
creativity that's what everybody is

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659
creativity that's what everybody is
 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.010
creativity that's what everybody is
interested in well there is exciting new

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020
interested in well there is exciting new
 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.440
interested in well there is exciting new
evidence that one of the functions of

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450
evidence that one of the functions of
 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.530
evidence that one of the functions of
the hippocampus a area that we know is

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540
the hippocampus a area that we know is
 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.690
the hippocampus a area that we know is
important for long-term memory is that

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700
important for long-term memory is that
 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.160
important for long-term memory is that
it's not only important for long-term

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170
it's not only important for long-term
 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.310
it's not only important for long-term
memory but it's critical for the

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320
memory but it's critical for the
 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.300
memory but it's critical for the
function of imagination so people have

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310
function of imagination so people have
 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.730
function of imagination so people have
been testing people with other people or

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740
been testing people with other people or
 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.530

past them and this led other researchers

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260
past them and this led other researchers
 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.330
past them and this led other researchers
to image the brains of subjects normal

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340
to image the brains of subjects normal
 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.760

subjects as they were remembering things
 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.080
subjects as they were remembering things
and when they remember things the

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090
and when they remember things the
 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.060
and when they remember things the
hippocampus lit out but then they asked

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070
hippocampus lit out but then they asked
 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.090
hippocampus lit out but then they asked
well imagine something new and in that

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100
well imagine something new and in that
 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.740
well imagine something new and in that
situation the hippocampus lit up again

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750
situation the hippocampus lit up again
 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.310
situation the hippocampus lit up again
so there's multiple modes of evidence

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320
so there's multiple modes of evidence
 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.770
so there's multiple modes of evidence
suggesting the hippocampus it's not only

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780
suggesting the hippocampus it's not only
 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.240
suggesting the hippocampus it's not only
involved in memory but it's also

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250
involved in memory but it's also
 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.850
involved in memory but it's also
important for imagination a key

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860
important for imagination a key
 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.190
important for imagination a key
component of creativity we know that

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200
component of creativity we know that
 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.220
component of creativity we know that
exercise stimulates what we call

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230
exercise stimulates what we call
 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.510
exercise stimulates what we call
neurogenesis or the birth of brand-new

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520
neurogenesis or the birth of brand-new
 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.150
neurogenesis or the birth of brand-new
brain cells in the hippocampus but

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160
brain cells in the hippocampus but
 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.770
brain cells in the hippocampus but
because of those brand new brain cells

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780
because of those brand new brain cells
 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.949
because of those brand new brain cells
in my hippocampus I'm also enhancing my

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959
in my hippocampus I'm also enhancing my
 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:11.310
in my hippocampus I'm also enhancing my
imagination abilities so hypothesis that

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320
imagination abilities so hypothesis that
 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.100
imagination abilities so hypothesis that
I'm working on in my lab is can exercise

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110
I'm working on in my lab is can exercise
 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:19.370
I'm working on in my lab is can exercise
actually enhance creativity
