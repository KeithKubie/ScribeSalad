Airbnb and providers such as that and is

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720
Airbnb and providers such as that and is
 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.660
Airbnb and providers such as that and is
is really for me what's so exciting is

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670
is really for me what's so exciting is
 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.540
is really for me what's so exciting is
the platform you know so I mean look at

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550
the platform you know so I mean look at
 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.090
the platform you know so I mean look at
the Airbnb example or the loop of the

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100
the Airbnb example or the loop of the
 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.910
the Airbnb example or the loop of the
uber platform again these you know these

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920
uber platform again these you know these
 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.790
uber platform again these you know these
these platforms don't own taxis they

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800
these platforms don't own taxis they
 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.250
these platforms don't own taxis they
don't own he'll tell rooms but what they

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.260
don't own he'll tell rooms but what they
 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.920
don't own he'll tell rooms but what they
do have is the platform and so think

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930
do have is the platform and so think
 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.260
do have is the platform and so think
about it from our platform and where

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270
about it from our platform and where
 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.270
about it from our platform and where
we're taking again tied directly to our

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280
we're taking again tied directly to our
 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.420
we're taking again tied directly to our
brand and that platform again would be

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430
brand and that platform again would be
 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:59.920
brand and that platform again would be
one that of course that would be digital

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930
one that of course that would be digital
 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.109
one that of course that would be digital
and it would manifest itself on a very

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119
and it would manifest itself on a very
 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:04.570
and it would manifest itself on a very
personal way I guess to you know

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580
personal way I guess to you know
 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.750
personal way I guess to you know

customer to to our service that we
provide them would you know they would

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830
provide them would you know they would
 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.830
provide them would you know they would
access it through their service that

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840
access it through their service that
 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.289
access it through their service that
they receive and you know that's how we

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:14.299
they receive and you know that's how we
 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:17.019
they receive and you know that's how we
can drive greater loyalty being able to

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:17.029
can drive greater loyalty being able to
 

00:02:17.029 --> 00:02:17.589
can drive greater loyalty being able to
do that

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599
do that
 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:20.890
do that

unit of one to have that all be self
 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:30.640
unit of one to have that all be self
accessible and then you know also

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650
accessible and then you know also
 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.589
accessible and then you know also

technology that's very exciting so again

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019
technology that's very exciting so again
 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:37.869
technology that's very exciting so again
the innovation that we're looking at

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:37.879
the innovation that we're looking at
 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:39.759
the innovation that we're looking at
particularly within of our guest rooms

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769
particularly within of our guest rooms
 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:42.039
particularly within of our guest rooms
is that you know this also would become

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:42.049
is that you know this also would become
 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:43.809
is that you know this also would become
your digital wallet this becomes

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819
your digital wallet this becomes
 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:44.979
your digital wallet this becomes
everything that you would control in

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989
everything that you would control in
 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:46.780
everything that you would control in
your guest room this becomes everything

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790
your guest room this becomes everything
 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.129
your guest room this becomes everything
that you would do with that you need to

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:48.139
that you would do with that you need to
 

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:51.280
that you would do with that you need to
do within the hotel and ultimately what

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290
do within the hotel and ultimately what
 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:52.780
do within the hotel and ultimately what
we're looking for is that how all of

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790
we're looking for is that how all of
 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.209
we're looking for is that how all of
that would be integrated together so

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:55.219
that would be integrated together so
 

00:02:55.219 --> 00:02:56.649
that would be integrated together so
that it would be seamless and

00:02:56.649 --> 00:02:56.659
that it would be seamless and
 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:58.990
that it would be seamless and
transparent to the guests experience as

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000
transparent to the guests experience as
 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.170
transparent to the guests experience as
they're moving from department to

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180
they're moving from department to
 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.020
they're moving from department to
department from leaving the hotel to

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030
department from leaving the hotel to
 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.360
department from leaving the hotel to
then checking in to go to their next

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370
then checking in to go to their next
 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.069
then checking in to go to their next
experience or to catch their next flight

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:09.079
experience or to catch their next flight
 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:11.110
experience or to catch their next flight
all of that becomes a very much an

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120
all of that becomes a very much an
 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.089
all of that becomes a very much an
integrated experience that they're doing

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:13.099
integrated experience that they're doing
 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:15.490
integrated experience that they're doing
and that has to do with the platforms

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500
and that has to do with the platforms
 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.550
and that has to do with the platforms
that are made available out there so the

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560
that are made available out there so the
 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.339
that are made available out there so the
the power of the platform I guess is

00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:21.349
the power of the platform I guess is
 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:24.159
the power of the platform I guess is
what would be my my greatest learning or

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:24.169
what would be my my greatest learning or
 

00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:26.110
what would be my my greatest learning or
you know admiration and how can we learn

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120
you know admiration and how can we learn
 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.170
you know admiration and how can we learn
about that platform and then customer

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180
about that platform and then customer
 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.270
about that platform and then customer
data which i think is really the the

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280
data which i think is really the the
 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.300
data which i think is really the the
real important back-end of this is all

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310
real important back-end of this is all
 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.219
real important back-end of this is all
of that customer data that we then are

00:03:36.219 --> 00:03:36.229
of that customer data that we then are
 

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:39.460
of that customer data that we then are
able to have in a very very positive way

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470
able to have in a very very positive way
 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.800
able to have in a very very positive way
again to customize our solutions for our

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810
again to customize our solutions for our

customers to better meet their needs and
 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.899
customers to better meet their needs and
then ultimately to be predictive so that

00:03:46.899 --> 00:03:46.909
then ultimately to be predictive so that
 

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:49.390
then ultimately to be predictive so that
the predictive analytics that those

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400
the predictive analytics that those
 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.360
the predictive analytics that those
platforms are then providing with the

of beauty so in addition to that you
 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:38.640
of beauty so in addition to that you
know so just think about that happening

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:38.650
know so just think about that happening

again your digital key would help you to
 

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:58.230
again your digital key would help you to
do that so again think of that from a

00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:58.240
do that so again think of that from a
 

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.170
do that so again think of that from a
guest perspective and then weird we're

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:01.180
guest perspective and then weird we're
 

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:04.020
guest perspective and then weird we're
doing you know simultaneously we're

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:04.030
doing you know simultaneously we're
 

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:06.570
doing you know simultaneously we're
creating that entire experience for our

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:06.580
creating that entire experience for our

creating that entire experience for our
team members so that they can learn on

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:09.100
team members so that they can learn on
 

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:12.270
team members so that they can learn on
their devices and in many cases we do

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:12.280
their devices and in many cases we do
 

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.880
their devices and in many cases we do
that in a game of five-way so using

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:14.890
that in a game of five-way so using
 

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:16.710
that in a game of five-way so using
gamification to make that fun and

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:16.720
gamification to make that fun and
 

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.900
gamification to make that fun and
engaging bite-size little chunks to be

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:18.910
engaging bite-size little chunks to be
 

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:21.210
engaging bite-size little chunks to be
able to do that and then we want to

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:21.220
able to do that and then we want to
 

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:22.860
able to do that and then we want to
ensure that they've done that so there

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:22.870
ensure that they've done that so there
 

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:26.130
ensure that they've done that so there
has to be a degree of success or a

know think about that from a compliance

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:30.040
know think about that from a compliance
 

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.159
know think about that from a compliance
