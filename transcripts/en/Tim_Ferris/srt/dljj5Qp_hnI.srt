1
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:13,523
[inaudible]

2
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:19,500
what would my advice be to a driven and
intelligent college student or young

3
00:00:19,661 --> 00:00:23,170
person about to enter
the real world? Well,

4
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,000
I would be very simple.

5
00:00:25,001 --> 00:00:29,650
It would be focus on
learning instead of earning,

6
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:32,110
and that sounds cliche,

7
00:00:32,111 --> 00:00:36,670
but I'll explain why because if you
want to make say $1 million a year,

8
00:00:36,671 --> 00:00:39,700
$10 million a year instead
of $100,000 a year,

9
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:44,440
I would argue you probably don't want to
take the a hundred thousand dollar per

10
00:00:44,441 --> 00:00:47,560
year job, even if it's offered
to you right out of the gate.

11
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:48,910
I know it sounds like a lot of money,

12
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:52,960
but what I'm going to recommend
is not limited to finances.

13
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,800
You want to focus on
projects, on companies,

14
00:00:56,801 --> 00:01:01,801
on environments where you can learn
lessons on someone else's bankroll.

15
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:02,950
All right?

16
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:07,950
So let them pay for it and view it
effectively as an apprenticeship.

17
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:14,041
So find a situation where you can be
in the room with masters of a craft and

18
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:21,310
that could just be dealmaking. It
could be joining a small company,

19
00:01:21,311 --> 00:01:22,840
say a fewer than 50 people,

20
00:01:22,841 --> 00:01:27,841
where you simply get to observe one of
the principals negotiating in an industry

21
00:01:28,031 --> 00:01:29,950
that you don't even care
anything about, right?

22
00:01:29,951 --> 00:01:32,680
It could be waste management and
you want to go into high tech,

23
00:01:32,681 --> 00:01:37,270
but if you sit in a room with someone
who's an absolute pro at crafting deals,

24
00:01:37,271 --> 00:01:41,800
negotiating, getting past no those skills,

25
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:46,220
and maybe those relationships
start to snowball. All right?

26
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,920
And this is what Scott Adams,

27
00:01:47,921 --> 00:01:50,380
the creator of Dilbert
would call systems thinking.

28
00:01:50,381 --> 00:01:54,640
So instead of being wedded to
the outcome of a given job,

29
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:00,120
you are accumulating skills and
relationships that transcend that job,

30
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:06,190
okay? And if you choose your environments,
well, because as I've said before,

31
00:02:06,191 --> 00:02:10,750
and as people like drew, the CEO
of Dropbox, as a friend have said,

32
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:13,930
you're the average of the five people
you associate with most, right?

33
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:18,780
So if you take just a few
years, have the patients,

34
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:23,960
the few years to really develop core
competencies that allow you to craft your

35
00:02:26,561 --> 00:02:31,510
own reality and life negotiation,
deal making, getting past know,

36
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,460
et Cetera, learning how to pitch,

37
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:37,390
how to get someone's attention in 30
seconds so that you can then create the

38
00:02:37,391 --> 00:02:42,190
desire and ultimately ask for some
type of action. Once you develop those,

39
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:47,700
then you can really just create the map
for the next decade and the next several

40
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,370
decades. So that would be it.

41
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:56,080
It would be learned before you earn
and it's never too late to do that.

42
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:58,840
So I don't care if you're coming out
of college, coming out of high school,

43
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:01,990
30 40 whatever it is, systems thinking,

44
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:07,020
focus on the skills and relationships
first and then you can just create a blank

45
00:03:10,031 --> 00:03:14,500
check for how much money you want to
make. If that is your goal. The guys,

46
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,280
if you're enjoying the tips and tactics
and how to on this channel or in the

47
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:22,570
podcast, the Tim Ferriss show, I
made this for you. Tribe of mentors,

48
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,950
short advice from the best in the world.
This is the book that I wanted to read.

49
00:03:26,951 --> 00:03:28,450
So I went out and I put it together,

50
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:33,640
created a dream list of 130
of the best at what they do.

51
00:03:33,641 --> 00:03:37,420
People who are icons, legends, and
ask them all the same questions.

52
00:03:37,421 --> 00:03:39,400
These are people in some cases
I wanted to reach out to.

53
00:03:39,401 --> 00:03:43,150
My whole life ranges from
many, many billionaires,

54
00:03:43,151 --> 00:03:45,910
cofounders of every company imaginable,

55
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:50,230
elite athletes ranging from surfing to
tennis to power lifting. Everything else,

56
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:55,390
country stars, actors, directors,
and you can spot the patterns.

57
00:03:55,391 --> 00:03:58,330
So some of my friends have said
this is the easiest to read,

58
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,300
most useful book that
I've put together yet.

59
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:05,800
So checking out tribal mentors.com
you can find sample chapters,

60
00:04:05,801 --> 00:04:08,980
the whole list of mentors,
everything, mentor, mentors.com.
