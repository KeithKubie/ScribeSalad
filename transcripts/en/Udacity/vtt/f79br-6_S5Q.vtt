00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.550
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Let's look at another case of a pretty common mistake people could make on

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:07.295
this problem. Let's say that you looked at this and though oh, 12 and 18 are

00:00:07.295 --> 00:00:11.150
both even numbers that means they are divisible by 2. And, if we factor out a 2

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.811
from both terms here, we're left with 6x plus 9. But remember I said that I

00:00:14.811 --> 00:00:18.982
didn't want to see any common factors between terms. Inside the parentheses

00:00:18.982 --> 00:00:23.447
aside from 1. And 6x and 9 are both divisible by 3. That's not super hard to

00:00:23.447 --> 00:00:28.158
fix, though. If I pull out a 3 from here, then my coefficient, or rather my term

00:00:28.158 --> 00:00:31.744
multiplying the things inside parentheses, is 2 times 3.
