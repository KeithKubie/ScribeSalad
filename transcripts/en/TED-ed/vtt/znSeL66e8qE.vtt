00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.840
Concrete is the most widely used

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.920
construction material in the world.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.470
It can be found in swathes of city pavements,

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:15.980
bridges that span vast rivers,

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.220
and the tallest skyscrapers on earth.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.770
But this sturdy substance

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.130
does have a weakness:

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:22.840
it’s prone to catastrophic cracking

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.540
that costs tens of billions of dollars

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.130
to repair each year.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.290
But what if we could avoid that problem,

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:31.310
by creating concrete that heals itself?

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:32.770
This idea isn’t as far-fetched

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:33.920
as it may seem.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.763
It boils down to an understanding

00:00:35.763 --> 00:00:37.453
of how concrete forms,

00:00:37.453 --> 00:00:39.243
and how to exploit that process

00:00:39.243 --> 00:00:40.633
to our benefit.

00:00:40.648 --> 00:00:42.798
Concrete is a combination of coarse stone

00:00:42.798 --> 00:00:45.146
and sand particles, called aggregates,

00:00:45.146 --> 00:00:47.576
that mix with cement, a powdered blend

00:00:47.576 --> 00:00:49.236
of clay and limestone.

00:00:49.245 --> 00:00:51.185
When water gets added to this mix,

00:00:51.185 --> 00:00:52.815
the cement forms a paste and

00:00:52.815 --> 00:00:55.045
coats the aggregates, quickly hardening

00:00:55.045 --> 00:00:56.275
through a chemical reaction

00:00:56.275 --> 00:00:58.075
called hydration.

00:00:58.077 --> 00:00:59.937
Eventually, the resulting material

00:00:59.937 --> 00:01:02.247
grows strong enough to prop up buildings

00:01:02.247 --> 00:01:03.697
that climb hundreds of meters

00:01:03.697 --> 00:01:05.137
into the sky.

00:01:05.137 --> 00:01:06.299
While people have been using

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.279
a variety of recipes to produce cement

00:01:08.283 --> 00:01:10.283
for over 4,000 years,

00:01:10.283 --> 00:01:11.279
concrete itself

00:01:11.279 --> 00:01:13.909
has a surprisingly short lifespan.

00:01:13.914 --> 00:01:15.624
After 20 to 30 years,

00:01:15.624 --> 00:01:18.574
natural processes like concrete shrinkage,

00:01:18.574 --> 00:01:20.334
excessive freezing and thawing,

00:01:20.334 --> 00:01:23.514
and heavy loads can trigger cracking.

00:01:23.514 --> 00:01:25.994
And it’s not just big breaks that count:

00:01:25.994 --> 00:01:28.394
tiny cracks can be just as dangerous.

00:01:28.404 --> 00:01:30.044
Concrete is often used

00:01:30.044 --> 00:01:31.464
as a secondary support

00:01:31.464 --> 00:01:33.644
around steel reinforcements.

00:01:33.644 --> 00:01:35.854
In this concrete, even small cracks

00:01:35.854 --> 00:01:37.944
can channel water, oxygen,

00:01:37.944 --> 00:01:40.794
and carbon dioxide that corrode the steel

00:01:40.794 --> 00:01:43.354
and lead to disastrous collapse.

00:01:43.354 --> 00:01:45.264
On structures like bridges and highways

00:01:45.264 --> 00:01:46.934
that are constantly in use,

00:01:46.934 --> 00:01:48.344
detecting these problems

00:01:48.344 --> 00:01:50.164
before they lead to catastrophe

00:01:50.164 --> 00:01:52.314
becomes a huge and costly challenge.

00:01:52.314 --> 00:01:53.794
But not doing so

00:01:53.794 --> 00:01:56.564
would also endanger thousands of lives.

00:01:56.564 --> 00:01:59.034
Fortunately, we’re already experimenting

00:01:59.034 --> 00:02:00.354
with ways this material

00:02:00.354 --> 00:02:02.124
could start fixing itself.

00:02:02.124 --> 00:02:03.374
And some of these solutions

00:02:03.374 --> 00:02:04.744
are inspired by concrete’s

00:02:04.744 --> 00:02:06.854
natural self-healing mechanism.

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:09.119
When water enters these tiny cracks,

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.109
it hydrates the concrete’s calcium oxide.

00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:13.979
The resulting calcium hydroxide

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:16.379
reacts with carbon dioxide in the air,

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:17.789
starting a process called

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:19.559
autogenous healing, where

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:21.819
microscopic calcium carbonate crystals

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.259
form and gradually fill the gap.

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:26.159
Unfortunately, these crystals

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:28.749
can only do so much, healing cracks

00:02:28.749 --> 00:02:31.729
that are less than 0.3mm wide.

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:33.589
Material scientists have figured out how

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:35.649
to heal cracks up to twice that size by

00:02:35.649 --> 00:02:38.179
adding hidden glue into the concrete mix.

00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:40.069
If we put adhesive-filled fibers

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:41.559
and tubes into the mixture,

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:44.079
they’ll snap open when a crack forms,

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:45.939
releasing their sticky contents

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:47.509
and sealing the gap.

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:49.469
But adhesive chemicals often behave

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:50.969
very differently from concrete,

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:52.709
and over time, these adhesives

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.209
can lead to even worse cracks.

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:56.899
So perhaps the best way to heal

00:02:56.899 --> 00:02:59.059
large cracks is to give concrete

00:02:59.059 --> 00:03:01.139
the tools to help itself.

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:02.289
Scientists have discovered that

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:03.869
some bacteria and fungi

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:05.459
can produce minerals,

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.429
including the calcium carbonate

00:03:07.429 --> 00:03:09.459
found in autogenous healing.

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.069
Experimental blends of concrete

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.429
include these bacterial or fungal spores

00:03:13.429 --> 00:03:15.979
alongside nutrients in their concrete mix,

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:17.249
where they could lie dormant

00:03:17.249 --> 00:03:18.999
for hundreds of years.

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:20.329
When cracks finally appear

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:22.099
and water trickles into the concrete,

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:25.209
the spores germinate, grow, and consume

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:27.429
the nutrient soup that surrounds them,

00:03:27.429 --> 00:03:29.029
modifying their local environment

00:03:29.029 --> 00:03:30.809
to create the perfect conditions

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:33.259
for calcium carbonate to grow.

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:35.329
These crystals gradually fill the gaps,

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:36.839
and after roughly three weeks,

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:38.219
the hard-working microbes

00:03:38.219 --> 00:03:39.919
can completely repair cracks

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:42.699
up to almost 1mm wide.

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:43.869
When the cracks seal,

00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:46.049
the bacteria or fungi will make spores

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:47.569
and go dormant once more—

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:49.849
ready to start a new cycle of self-healing

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:51.279
when cracks form again.

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:52.709
Although this technique

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.349
has been studied extensively,

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:55.689
we still have a ways to go

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:56.869
before incorporating it

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:58.909
in the global production of concrete.

00:03:58.963 --> 00:04:01.503
But, these spores have huge potential

00:04:01.503 --> 00:04:02.403
to make concrete

00:04:02.403 --> 00:04:04.683
more resilient and long-lasting—

00:04:04.683 --> 00:04:06.163
which could drastically reduce

00:04:06.163 --> 00:04:08.463
the financial and environmental cost

00:04:08.463 --> 00:04:09.783
of concrete production.

00:04:10.303 --> 00:04:12.773
Eventually, these microorganisms

00:04:12.773 --> 00:04:14.183
may force us to reconsider

00:04:14.183 --> 00:04:16.123
the way we think about our cities,

00:04:16.123 --> 00:04:18.133
bringing our inanimate concrete jungles

00:04:18.133 --> 00:04:19.243
to life.
