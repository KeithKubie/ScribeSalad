00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So the first one is, of course, rather obvious,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
before you even start a search tree algorithm,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
you should always apply pre-processing.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And the last one, of course, also doesn't make sense,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
because once the search tree is completed,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
then you already have your best possible solution

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
so why would you want to start pre-processing again.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The interesting part is this here,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
because it could be the case that the assignments that you create

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
during your search tree algorithm

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
actually allow you to do new pre-processing rules,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and you have already seen this.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
For example, for independent set and vertex cover

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
where we had said that during the search tree you come across cases

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
where for other vertices you can already decide if they are

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
going to be in an optimal solution or not, so it does make sense,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and there are the names of it misleading to apply

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
this pre-processing also during the search tree.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Now the question is, how often and when you should you should apply it.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
You should definitely apply it regularly,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
because you can regularly gain new

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
information during your search tree algorithm.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Doing it at each level, on the other hand, I think should not be  recommended,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and the reason for that is although pre-processing requires only polynomial time,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
it still requires time, so if you do the pre-processing too often

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
then on the one hand you waste a lot of time,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and on the other hand, these rules will not be very effective

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
because you need to have made a few more decisions each time in the search tree

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
until new pre-processing rules might become applicable.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
How often to apply it is almost more of an art than a science,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
but you should definitely not think about pre-processing

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
as something that you do only before you start a search tree algorithm

00:01:39.000 --> 99:59:59.000
but also something that can help you during a search tree.
