00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.246
Our answer is similar to the question before, we get plus or minus 5i. I'll show

00:00:04.246 --> 00:00:08.282
you the work that I did to get this. So again, I went through the same process

00:00:08.282 --> 00:00:12.438
as in the question before. Separating the factors under the radical, into the

00:00:12.438 --> 00:00:16.596
positive and negative parts, which then gave me a real factor, and an imaginary

00:00:16.596 --> 00:00:20.652
factor. And of course, we can't forget that plus or minus sign, since we're

00:00:20.652 --> 00:00:22.683
taking the square root of both sides.
