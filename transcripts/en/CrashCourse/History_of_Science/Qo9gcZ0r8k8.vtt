00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:09.990
As some scientists worked to control life
at the scale of global agriculture, others

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.269
worked in a different direction.

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:16.750
The mid-1900s was a period of reexamination
of one of our big questions: what, exactly,

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:17.830
is life?

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.320
Let's talk DNA and Biotech!!!

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:29.700
[Intro Music Plays]

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.600
Although the story is complex, it’s often
simplified to one big “discovery” of DNA

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.520
made in 1953 by two dudes who won Nobels.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.309
… There were other people involved.

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:44.780
By the 1940s, researchers knew that the cell
nucleus contained thread-shaped structures

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.090
called chromosomes that played a critical
role in cell division.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.850
Chromosomes seemed to be made of a mixture
of protein and other stuff.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.070
And this other key stuff was a molecule made
out of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and phosphorus.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.460
This was deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.370
Isolated, DNA looks kind of like white powder.

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.120
But no one knew DNA’s structure.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.331
A molecule’s structure—the way it fits
together—tells us about how it works, and

00:01:12.331 --> 00:01:14.520
maybe how to redesign it.

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.660
In 1944, Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger—the
cat guy—published a short book called What

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.580
is Life?, reviewing this deceptively simple
question.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.210
Scientists knew that there must be a unit
of heredity, the “gene,” that must be

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.170
part of the chromosomes.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.680
Schrödinger examined the laws of physics,
determining that the gene must be very small,

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.280
only a few thousand atoms in size.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.470
It must vary.

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.420
Yet it must be orderly and not give rise to
too many mutations.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.121
So Schrödinger threw down the challenge:
how does this “gene” physically encode

00:01:47.121 --> 00:01:49.810
the information that defines life?

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.770
He argued that this was among the most interesting
questions facing science.

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:59.480
And he suggested that one of the people best
poised to answer it was biophysicist Max Delbrück.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.080
Delbrück ran a loosely organized network
of researchers at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.010
Caltech, and elsewhere called the Phage Group.

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:12.190
The Group worked with viruses that parasite
bacteria, called bacteriophages.

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.990
Viruses are just nucleic acids in little protein
robot-bodies.

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:20.260
The Phage Group did important work on how
life works at a small scale, using radioactive

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.660
tracers inside viruses.

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.300
But even they couldn’t tell if it was the
DNA part or the protein part of the virus

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.720
that took over the bacterium.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.990
And no one could explain how either physically
encoded information.

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:38.290
So by 1950, the pressure to understand DNA
was on… even though not everyone was convinced

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.190
that DNA was the physical substrate of heredity
at all!

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.280
Despite this uncertainty, scientists set out
to win this race.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.569
The most famous was American chemist Linus
Pauling—who went on to join the short list

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.610
of people with two Nobel Prizes!

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.660
Pauling was an obvious choice because in 1951
he characterized the alpha helix structure

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.030
of common proteins.

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:04.120
He used an empirical approach, X-ray crystallography:
X-rays—which have wavelengths much smaller

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.950
than visible light—pierce molecules, then
scatter, making a diffraction pattern that

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.580
reveals information about the molecule’s
shape.

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.650
Crystallography is an incredibly finicky technique.

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.490
But Pauling correctly showed how common proteins
fold up into elegant little spirals.

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:24.780
He then decided to tackle DNA—guessing incorrectly
that it was made up of three helices.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.620
Also in the race was James Watson, a brilliant,
young, and brash American biochemist.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.480
“Brash” is the historian's euphemism for
“sexist jerk.”

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.560
He was a member of the Phage Group and a fan
of Schrödinger’s What is Life?

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.580
Watson traveled to the University of Cambridge’s
Cavendish Laboratory.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:45.550
There, he partnered with English biophysicist
Francis Crick, who became one of the great

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:47.720
theorists of modern biology.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:53.120
Watson and Crick’s approach was modeling
DNA—asking which atoms went where, based

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.940
on the laws of chemistry and physics.

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:00.060
Now, if you read Watson’s best-selling autobiography,
The Double Helix, you’d think he and Crick

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.270
did the heavy lifting in discovering the structure
of DNA.

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:07.780
You wouldn’t know that Harvard University
Press refused to publish his book because

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.610
of its potentially libelous characterization
of their collaborators!

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:13.660
ThoughtBubble, shows us another side of the
story:

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.400
Watson cast English chemist Rosalind Franklin

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.699
as the villain.

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:20.820
Franklin worked at King’s College London,
not the Cavendish.

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.150
And she was Jewish.

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:23.999
And she was… also… a woman.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.809
She also went to a talk by Watson and Crick
and tore apart their suggested model of DNA.

00:04:29.809 --> 00:04:33.740
The head of the Cavendish was humiliated, forbidding them from more DNA modeling.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.120
You see, Franklin was a leading expert in

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.460
X-ray crystallography.

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:42.439
Her photographs had shown that there were
two forms of DNA: A, which is dry and crystalline,

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:46.349
and B, which is wet—how DNA looks in living
cells.

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:49.340
This discovery was a fundamental step in understanding
DNA.

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.129
(We now know there is a third form, Z-DNA.)

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:58.539
Then in 1952, Franklin made one of the most
famous photographs in science: Photo 51.

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:03.449
It shows a clear “X” pattern—the signature
of a helix, or spiral-stair shape.

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:06.909
But Franklin didn’t know that the deputy
director of her lab,

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:11.939
Maurice Wilkins, was secretly passing her
notes and images to Watson and Crick.

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:15.409
The rest became history…

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:19.309
In 1953—working on their model, reviewing
facts about the four nucleic acids in DNA,

00:05:19.309 --> 00:05:25.999
or bases, and looking at Franklin’s images—Watson
and Crick realized DNA must be a double helix.

00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:31.360
And that the bases must be paired so that
the As equal the Ts and the Gs match the Cs.

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:36.089
The zipper shape of the double helix allows
DNA to transmit information from generation

00:05:36.089 --> 00:05:41.909
to generation with few copying errors: a cellular
machine “unzips” the staircase down the

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:45.710
middle, and figures out one half of a base
pair by looking at the other.

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:49.319
If one base is an A, it must connect to a
T. Simple!

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:52.880
Watson and Crick invited Franklin to Cambridge
to review their work.

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.400
She immediately acknowledged that it was correct.

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.009
She just didn’t know how much they had relied
on her own work!

00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:01.379
Thanks Thoughtbubble,
After publishing their model and the data

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:05.020
backing it up, Watson and Crick became scientific
celebrities.

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:09.589
Franklin, however, died prematurely of cancer,
likely due to her work with X-rays.

00:06:09.589 --> 00:06:12.259
And the Nobel Prize is not awarded posthumously.

00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:17.960
So in 1962, Watson, Crick, and Wilkins shared
the Nobel without acknowledging the debt they

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:18.960
owed to Franklin.

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:24.389
But, in part because Watson described Franklin
so horribly in his book—he called Franklin

00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:29.259
“Wilkins’s assistant!”—historians
went back and researched her life, writing

00:06:29.259 --> 00:06:33.099
her back into the role of protagonist in the
story of DNA.

00:06:33.099 --> 00:06:39.099
So a scientific object like DNA is assembled
out of other scientific objects such as X-ray

00:06:39.099 --> 00:06:44.219
images, textbooks, and three-dimensional models
of tin and cardboard—but also erroneous

00:06:44.219 --> 00:06:49.259
ideas such as Pauling’s triple helix, as
well as relationships and competitive drives

00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:50.259
for fame.

00:06:50.259 --> 00:06:56.410
With DNA revealed, life itself could theoretically
now be not only “read” but “programmed.”

00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:59.050
Remember, this was around the same time as
the birth of computing!

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:05.129
So DNA became a machine-language “program”
to make RNA, which became an assembly-language

00:07:05.129 --> 00:07:08.690
“program” for making proteins, which are
what life is made out of.

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:13.150
This process was thought to be quite computer-like,
moving only in one direction—from DNA to

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:15.129
RNA to proteins.

00:07:15.129 --> 00:07:19.380
This rule, first expressed by Crick, is the
Central Dogma of Genetics.

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:23.909
We now know it’s more complicated, but the
essential idea is useful.

00:07:23.909 --> 00:07:27.990
The question after 1953 was another how—the
genetic code.

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:34.279
DNA has four nucleic acid “letters”—A,
T, G, and C, with a U instead of a T in RNA.

00:07:34.279 --> 00:07:39.439
But how do these code for the twenty amino-acid
“letters” of the proteins that we’re

00:07:39.439 --> 00:07:40.439
made out of?

00:07:40.439 --> 00:07:43.599
Some of the DNA discoverers went back to the
theoretical drawing board.

00:07:43.599 --> 00:07:49.439
In 1954, Watson and Soviet-American physicist
George Gamow founded the “RNA

00:07:49.439 --> 00:07:51.490
tie club” to figure it out.

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:54.610
And Gamow, Crick, and others did important
theoretical work.

00:07:54.610 --> 00:08:00.029
But in 1961, biochemists Marshall Nirenberg
and Heinrich Matthaei cracked

00:08:00.029 --> 00:08:01.639
the first piece of the code.

00:08:01.639 --> 00:08:08.449
And, over the 1960s, other biochemists figured
out the rest, including how RNA works.

00:08:08.449 --> 00:08:13.550
Also in 1953, University of Chicago chemist
Stanley Miller and his advisor Harold Urey

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:18.740
produced amino acids, the building
blocks of life, out of an electrified broth

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:20.779
of not-living nutrients.

00:08:20.779 --> 00:08:25.689
The Miller–Urey experiment supported the
idea that all life on earth arose in a primordial

00:08:25.689 --> 00:08:28.990
soup of basic nutrients, billions of years
ago.

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:33.649
Some scientists, though—including Crick!—found
this unlikely, and thought life on earth probably

00:08:33.649 --> 00:08:35.250
came from outer space.

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:36.690
An idea called panspermia.

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:41.169
The discoveries of 1953 marked a new era in
biology.

00:08:41.169 --> 00:08:46.480
Evolution now had a molecular basis: mutations
are copy errors in DNA.

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:48.640
Rare, but inevitable.

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:52.380
Mutations give rise to the variation that
Darwin and Wallace described.

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:55.399
Molecular techniques revolutionized the study
of evolution.

00:08:55.399 --> 00:09:00.450
Species were regrouped by the similarity of
their DNA, not their visible physical structures.

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:04.130
Crabs, for example, evolved several times,
millions of years apart.

00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:09.540
It turns out that having armor-skin and claw
hands, and being able to digest literal trash

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:13.180
is super useful in different watery environments!

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:16.110
Another use of the newly deciphered genetic
code was industrial.

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:18.730
Arguably, biotechnology had been around for
a while.

00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:22.380
Beer, after all, is made using engineered
strains of brewers’ yeast.

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:27.560
But this process takes a long time and involves
strain selection, or picking types of yeast

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:31.350
with useful properties—not molecular-scale
editing.

00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:36.490
After 1953, scientists started looking for
genes connected to traits of interest.

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:41.449
The problem was, knowing what genes code for
what traits wasn’t useful without having

00:09:41.449 --> 00:09:43.389
a way to move those genes around.

00:09:43.389 --> 00:09:49.630
So biotech took off in the early 1970s in
San Francisco, after Paul Berg, Stanley Cohen,

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:56.190
and Herbert Boyer published the results of
experiments with recombinant DNA or rDNA—new,

00:09:56.190 --> 00:10:01.680
synthetic sections of DNA made by cloning
sections from one organism’s genome into

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:02.680
another.

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:05.850
With rDNA, scientists could splice sequences
of DNA.

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:11.500
Berg became the first person to join DNA from
two different species in one microbe.

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:16.199
rDNA allowed scientists to copy the genes
involved in the creation of the important

00:10:16.199 --> 00:10:21.170
hormone insulin, which regulates how much
sugar the body has in its bloodstream, into

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:22.730
bacteria and yeast.

00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:28.300
Before rDNA, people with diabetes had to get
insulin from pigs or other animals, but synthetic

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:30.000
insulin is more pure.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.550
Industrial genetic engineering exploded.

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:38.220
In 1980, the Supreme Court of the United States
heard a landmark case called Diamond v. Chakrabarty

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:43.500
The question was whether or not a company
could patent a bioengineered lifeform—a

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:46.990
microbe designed to eat up spilled oil.

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:52.550
SCOTUS said yes: if you engineer an organism’s
genome, then it becomes a technology.

00:10:52.550 --> 00:11:00.810
And, by 1980, the biotech industry also had
its first initial public offerings, or IPOs.

00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:03.639
Several companies launched with massive valuations.

00:11:03.639 --> 00:11:08.390
And universities—especially around San Francisco
and Boston—began to view their scientific

00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:11.370
discoveries as major sources of money.

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:15.379
They set up offices of technology transfer
or licensing.

00:11:15.379 --> 00:11:19.449
Scientific knowledge—and life itself—became
potential technologies.

00:11:19.449 --> 00:11:24.170
Next time—we’ll look at how biological
technologies changed medicine and agriculture.

00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:29.810
It’s time for the birth of Big Pharma, GMOs,
and IVF.

00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:33.040
Crash Course History of Science is filmed
in the Dr. Cheryl C. Kinney studio in Missoula,

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:36.920
Montana and it’s made with the help of all
this nice people and our animation team is

Crash Course is a Complexly production.

00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:43.290
If you wanna keep imagining the world complexly
with us, you can check out some of our other

00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:47.300
channels like Nature League, Sexplanations, and Scishow.

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:52.250
And, if you’d like to keep Crash Course
free for everybody, forever, you can support

00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:56.490
the series at Patreon; a crowdfunding platform
that allows you to support the content you

00:11:56.490 --> 00:11:57.490
love.

00:11:57.490 --> 00:12:01.040
Thank you to all of our patrons for making
Crash Course possible with their continued

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:01.880
support.
