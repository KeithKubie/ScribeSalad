[inaudible]

2
00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.870
<v 1>joining me today as a sociologist,
a physician,
a professor at Yale University,</v>

3
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.970
and author of the new book blueprint,

4
00:00:10.971 --> 00:00:14.930
the evolutionary origins of a good society.
Nick Christakis,

5
00:00:14.931 --> 00:00:17.150
welcome to the Rubin report.
Thank you for having me,
dude.

6
00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.370
I am happy to have you here sir.

7
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.380
But I'm depressed that I have to start the show the way I sort of have to start

8
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.380
the show and I suspect,
you know how I have to start the show.
Yeah.

9
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:30.920
So do you want to set it up for me?

10
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.350
<v 2>Well,
I mean we do just have to get this out of,
I know,
I know.
I mean,</v>

11
00:00:35.351 --> 00:00:37.210
I knew when the book was published.
I mean,

12
00:00:37.211 --> 00:00:39.970
I've been working in the book for nine years and I knew when it was published

13
00:00:39.971 --> 00:00:44.830
that I would have to revisit those events from 2015 which,
you know,

14
00:00:44.831 --> 00:00:49.240
we're just a challenging period of my life.
Um,
thankfully in the past.

15
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.600
I'm really glad to have it behind me.
Yeah.
But I recognize that.

16
00:00:52.601 --> 00:00:54.610
So you tell whatever part of it you want to tell.

17
00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.800
<v 1>Okay.
So you are and were a professor at Yale?
Yes.
This is,</v>

18
00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.710
this is in I think the fall of 2015.
Yes,
it fall of 2015.

19
00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.810
And your wife Erica,
who's also a professor,
uh,
childhood development.

20
00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.060
She was an instructor but yes.
Yes.
So uh,

21
00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:15.150
she basically wrote a piece that said it was a defensive free speech and it was

22
00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.440
sort of worked around the Halloween costume idea that you know,

23
00:01:20.441 --> 00:01:23.680
you should wear what you want but you can try to be respectful of people but you

24
00:01:23.681 --> 00:01:27.430
know,
we shouldn't have some sort of top down version where people,
you know,

25
00:01:27.431 --> 00:01:30.700
administrators or professors are telling students what were,

26
00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.100
you offered her a bit of a defense on that and now I'll throw it in the clip.

27
00:01:36.101 --> 00:01:39.160
Is that fair?
Fair.
Okay.
Let's throw it to the clip.

28
00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.620
<v 3>Don't need to bend down.
I'm not bending.
What's your name?
I don't want this.</v>

29
00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.500
I do not want you to take care.
I do not want,
I do not respect you.

30
00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.470
I'm going to hear that.
I'm looking at this rec in your face like I'm disgusting.

31
00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.730
Okay.
I am off and I'm sick watching them argue with you.

32
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.780
I believe we've been standing on stage literally for at least five to six hours

33
00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.220
between you and Halloween,
which we last night to now,

34
00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.520
we've been arguing with people who are not willing to be listened to for a long

35
00:02:05.521 --> 00:02:09.720
time.
And all I see from you is arrogance and ego.

36
00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.590
I am sick looking at you.
I am disgusted watching,
argue with you.

37
00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.970
You are not listening.
You are disgusting.

38
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.430
I don't think you understand that.
And before I wasn't I before,

39
00:02:26.431 --> 00:02:29.280
I was not angry per say,
I was disappointed.

40
00:02:29.281 --> 00:02:32.250
Maybe I thought maybe there was room for it before an apology.

41
00:02:32.251 --> 00:02:36.420
You've clearly told us that you did not plant.
Offer an apology for your words.

42
00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.500
You left the meeting last night to go home and vent.
Tweak.

43
00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.420
Do not interrupt me to tweet from your Twitter and then the filaments.

44
00:02:45.421 --> 00:02:47.070
Twitter,
you showed no remorse.

45
00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.520
You tried to let your wife leave that conversation without having answered for

46
00:02:50.521 --> 00:02:55.140
herself.
That is disgusting.
That is sick.
And now I wasn't angry before.

47
00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.680
I was not angry before,
but now I am actually angry sir.

48
00:02:58.681 --> 00:03:01.480
I really do not interrupt me.
I was not angry.

49
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.400
And now I want your job to be taken from you.
I don't want you to have this job.

50
00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.360
I am disgusted knowing that you work at Yale University where I will get my

51
00:03:10.361 --> 00:03:14.610
degree.
Well,
I will look back and think I have to argue with you.
All right?

52
00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.980
Don't Miss Sarah.
Don't do it.
Don't do it.
Third,

53
00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.960
to not do it.

54
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.140
This is not the day you do not want to play this game with meters out of thing.

55
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.050
You don't wanna play this game with me.
Okay?
Understand that.

56
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.920
Look me in my face first of all and understand that you are such a

57
00:03:29.921 --> 00:03:33.310
disappointment to this university,
to your students,
to yourself.

58
00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.080
Do the things that you do claim to agree with you are you want free dialogue.

59
00:03:38.081 --> 00:03:41.860
You want free speech.
This is how it works.
Someone speaks,
you listen,

60
00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.700
you're not cut them off.
You did not do these,
these condescending gestures.

61
00:03:45.701 --> 00:03:48.550
You do not smirk.
You look them in the face and you wait.

62
00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.770
You wait until it's your turn.

63
00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:55.170
<v 2>Okay?
So before we even dive into that,
the second we played the clip,</v>

64
00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.520
you let out a big exhale.

65
00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.070
You just not was interested in this anymore or it's depressing to look back at.

66
00:04:02.071 --> 00:04:05.040
Both are true.
It's,
you know,
it's,
um,

67
00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.190
I was in the courtyard for two hours and 15 minutes from four to six,

68
00:04:08.191 --> 00:04:13.191
15 about an hour of footage has been released of from five or six different

69
00:04:13.201 --> 00:04:16.980
vantage points.
You showed one clip that's typically not the clip that's shown.

70
00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:21.450
Um,
so many people put stuff online you can read,

71
00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.540
you can piece together the whole hour between five and six.

72
00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.640
For the first hour that I was out in the courtyard,

73
00:04:26.641 --> 00:04:30.690
I listened quietly to the students.
Um,
you know,

74
00:04:30.691 --> 00:04:33.960
there's a lot of stuff that,
that young woman said that's just factually wrong.

75
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.860
Um,

76
00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.860
she's alluding to an event that occurred the night before at the Afro Afro

77
00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.260
American Cultural House at Yale where there was a huge event with hundreds of

78
00:04:43.261 --> 00:04:46.750
students.
Um,
it had been announced at the beginning that,

79
00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.040
that we would have to leave that event at the conclusion it was,

80
00:04:50.041 --> 00:04:51.390
I can't remember the precise timing,

81
00:04:51.391 --> 00:04:53.280
but I think it was scheduled from six to eight.

82
00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.640
My wife had to teach a class from seven to nine,
so she deals in the evening.

83
00:04:57.641 --> 00:05:01.080
So she told her students she'd be late and we'd stay from six to eight.

84
00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.920
She did in fact speak to the crowd.
She,
um,

85
00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:06.630
had to leave to teach an eye.

86
00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.350
We had a student in the hospital actually that evening that I was responsible

87
00:05:10.351 --> 00:05:14.010
for and that also was known.
So,

88
00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.730
so when she said that we tried to leave,
that's not,
that's false.
Um,

89
00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.760
you know,
I think that um,

90
00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.960
many of the students were swept up in a kind of a mob fervor.

91
00:05:24.961 --> 00:05:29.400
I think they behave badly.
Um,

92
00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:34.170
they should have known better.
I think they were trying to assert power.

93
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:39.240
If I had a tool when I was that age that could get grownups into trouble.
Right.

94
00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.040
Uh,
you know,
probably I would just get doing it nonstop,
you know,

95
00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:47.820
and they have found a tool often are doing it.
Yes.
Yes.
And so,

96
00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.840
but so I think what distressed me is I think at some point in the background of

97
00:05:51.841 --> 00:05:54.450
that footage that one of the administrators,
actually the author,

98
00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.830
what happened is,
is a man by the name of Howard.

99
00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:03.460
I had moved from north western university to Yale and had assumed a new position

100
00:06:03.951 --> 00:06:08.330
there.
And he had written an email.
He had written a memo while at Northwestern,

101
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:12.650
uh,
admonishing students not to wear a offensive costumes.

102
00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.860
And I should say for the record that many of the students that many of the

103
00:06:15.861 --> 00:06:19.730
costumes that he or anyone else would find offensive,
I too would find offensive.

104
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:22.100
I wouldn't like these costumes.
I,

105
00:06:22.101 --> 00:06:26.180
I'm well aware of the long history of racism in our society.

106
00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:29.500
I am well aware of the ways in which,
uh,

107
00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:33.320
there's trafficking and certain cultural tropes that put down other groups.

108
00:06:33.321 --> 00:06:37.520
I reject.
I am of,
I've a very pro immigrant policy.

109
00:06:37.521 --> 00:06:41.930
I believe system.
I,
I think that anyone can be an American.

110
00:06:41.931 --> 00:06:43.940
I love the idea that we have open borders,
you know,

111
00:06:43.941 --> 00:06:48.750
I mean I have all set of beliefs that are around openness and welcoming or

112
00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:52.200
lefty.
Yeah.
I am quite lot.
I am a lefty.
I'm left of center plate.

113
00:06:52.201 --> 00:06:54.650
I mean I have some conservative ideas,
some libertarian,

114
00:06:54.651 --> 00:06:58.460
I think of myself as a classical liberal and I think of myself as very pragmatic

115
00:06:58.461 --> 00:07:00.260
and policymaking.
So I like,

116
00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:04.370
I like markets to address most allocation of goods,

117
00:07:04.371 --> 00:07:07.310
but I also very concerned about market failures and then I want government

118
00:07:07.311 --> 00:07:11.940
intervention.
Anyway,
so,
um,
so,
uh,
so that,
anyway,

119
00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.190
that man who was,

120
00:07:13.191 --> 00:07:17.060
I then had moved to Yale and then he took out of mothballs this email that he

121
00:07:17.061 --> 00:07:19.460
had sent at Northwestern five or 10 years earlier,

122
00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:22.990
got a bunch of Yale administrators to sign it and then send it off.

123
00:07:22.991 --> 00:07:27.500
And in it he had links to approved and non-approved costumes are very costumes

124
00:07:27.501 --> 00:07:29.900
which were deemed to be offensive in his email.

125
00:07:29.901 --> 00:07:34.190
There were links to lots of those ostensibly offensive costumes and the
students,

126
00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:36.770
there had been a lot of conversation at the time.

127
00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:41.840
The New York Times had a big piece like the previous month about the growing use

128
00:07:41.841 --> 00:07:44.960
of Halloween costume advice at American colleges.
So it was in his,
like guys,

129
00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:46.160
this was the third,

130
00:07:46.161 --> 00:07:49.040
his email was the third email that had been sent out telling students,

131
00:07:49.041 --> 00:07:51.680
giving them advice.
So in my wife's class,

132
00:07:51.681 --> 00:07:54.890
many of the students in the class and other students in the college where we,

133
00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.910
the subpart of Yale that we were responsible for had told her that they felt

134
00:07:58.911 --> 00:08:02.810
this was very infantilizing and they didn't really need advice on what to wear.

135
00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:07.460
And so my wife from a developmental perspective wrote a response to this email,

136
00:08:07.461 --> 00:08:11.360
which itself had been,
was signed by 13 administrators.
It,
it didn't,

137
00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:15.490
it was framed as guidance,
but it sort of had the color of law.
And um,

138
00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:17.870
so she wrote a response saying,

139
00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:22.610
and her intellectual point was not wear whatever you want.

140
00:08:22.611 --> 00:08:24.650
Right.
Her intellectual point was,

141
00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:28.760
do you students at Yale in your twenties early twenties late teens,

142
00:08:28.761 --> 00:08:33.650
early twenties really need older adults to tell you what to wear,

143
00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:37.520
provide you guidance.
You should think about that and decide whether you really,

144
00:08:37.521 --> 00:08:41.090
and apparently many students did want such guidance.

145
00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:44.810
And so then I was then thereafter,
then all hell broke loose.

146
00:08:44.811 --> 00:08:48.620
And I was in the court courtyard and did the best I could.
Yeah.

147
00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:52.310
What do you make of the reason we chose that cliff was because there is the

148
00:08:52.311 --> 00:08:55.800
other more famous clip of,
of the growth,
really liberating with,
there were many,

149
00:08:55.801 --> 00:08:57.490
many,
they were hired on you that,

150
00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:59.070
that was the one that I think we should note here.

151
00:08:59.071 --> 00:09:00.380
And I think that's the most of our little bubble.

152
00:09:00.381 --> 00:09:03.420
I thought that one was interesting because the angle was a little different and

153
00:09:03.421 --> 00:09:06.150
you could see some of the other kids and the,
and the,
you know,

154
00:09:06.151 --> 00:09:08.090
the either tears or the look of horror,

155
00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:13.170
all of these things when you actually didn't do anything.

156
00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:19.320
Well that's another whole topic.
I think that,
um,

157
00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:23.130
I mean many people have analyzed those events and honestly,
I don't,

158
00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:25.590
I don't know if I have anything to add to those analyses.

159
00:09:25.591 --> 00:09:29.080
I think that the thing that was very interesting to mean,

160
00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:34.470
so,
so one of the ideas that I've been thinking about for a long time is this

161
00:09:34.471 --> 00:09:37.500
tension between our individuality and our group of shyness.

162
00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:41.850
And we have evolved to,
first of all,
it's a very interesting idea.

163
00:09:41.851 --> 00:09:46.260
We've evolved to be individuals,
so we humans have unique identities.

164
00:09:46.261 --> 00:09:47.730
So we have unique faces.

165
00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:50.880
So you can look out at a sea of people and can tell who's who.

166
00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:53.790
And not only do we have the ability to signal our uniqueness,

167
00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:55.230
we use our faces for that,

168
00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:58.530
but we have the cognitive apparatus to detect that uniqueness.

169
00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:01.590
So you can have a lot of brainpower you haven't done,

170
00:10:01.591 --> 00:10:03.000
you allocate to tell who's who.

171
00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:07.920
So this ability to be individuals is crucial for our ability to function in

172
00:10:07.921 --> 00:10:08.191
groups.

173
00:10:08.191 --> 00:10:12.900
It's very paradoxical because you need the capacity to tell who's my offspring,

174
00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:17.340
who's my friend?
Who do I reciprocate?
Kindness to,
who do I cooperate with?

175
00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:19.440
Who's my enemy?
All of these things.

176
00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:24.840
So all of these capacities of individuality are crucial to our collective

177
00:10:24.841 --> 00:10:29.550
expression,
our ability to live together.
But equally we,

178
00:10:29.551 --> 00:10:33.420
um,
we have this desire to surrender ourselves to the group,

179
00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:35.820
to do something called two d individually,

180
00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:39.660
to form a part of a collectivity to suppress our individual desires,

181
00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:41.370
which also allows us to work together.

182
00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:46.110
But the irony is when you'd get too much of that,
you get mobs,

183
00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:49.570
you get panics,
you get,
you know,
uh,
uh,

184
00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:53.310
all kinds of collective phenomena that are destructive rather than constructive.

185
00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:57.720
So when I was in the crowd,
when I was in that mob,
I,
I knew what was happening,

186
00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:58.620
I could tell.

187
00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:02.700
So one of the things I started doing was as I started asking people,

188
00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:07.200
what's your name?
And I was trying to connect to them person to person saying,

189
00:11:07.201 --> 00:11:11.580
you know,
hi,
I'm Nicholas.
Who are you?
So you're a person and I'm a person.

190
00:11:11.581 --> 00:11:15.480
You're not a part of this,
a mob.
You're a human being.
And I am a human being.

191
00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:17.820
And in fact,
the,

192
00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:21.390
the one thing that happened that that isn't as an intellectual idea,

193
00:11:21.391 --> 00:11:23.460
that's part of this book that I've been working on for 10 years.

194
00:11:23.461 --> 00:11:27.540
But that also I made in the heat of the moment is in the moment I said to the

195
00:11:27.541 --> 00:11:31.050
students,
I said that I believe in our common humanity.

196
00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:35.220
I believe that even though this person and this person is superficially

197
00:11:35.221 --> 00:11:38.550
different than me,
nevertheless,
we can talk to each other.

198
00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:43.080
We all have life experiences where human beings and ended.
And then if you,

199
00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:46.260
if you don't believe that,
if you don't believe we have a common humanity,

200
00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:50.700
which I see as a wonderful thing.
Yes,
yes.
Cause I'm an optimist.

201
00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:53.980
I'm an optimist.
If you don't believe our common humanity,

202
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:58.840
why are you even trying to talk to me and the students geared to,
yeah,

203
00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:02.770
they jeered it's on film.
They jeered and I honestly,

204
00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:07.000
I think that's one of the most depressing things that's happened that I've ever

205
00:12:07.001 --> 00:12:12.001
seen actually said the yields students in the 21st century would jeer at what I

206
00:12:12.701 --> 00:12:16.720
regard to be a fundamental,
humane,

207
00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:20.260
wonderful claim about human beings is that we have a common humanity.

208
00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:23.980
<v 1>So,
all right.
So I know you don't want to spend the whole time,
but I do.</v>

209
00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:27.220
But I think a lot of this does segue to your book for reasons that you just laid

210
00:12:27.221 --> 00:12:30.730
out.
So those trying to do that.
Yeah,
I know you're a very clever,

211
00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:33.910
you're tid bits.
You can,
I'll watch what,
I'm going to go back in there.

212
00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:37.630
How did they get us there then?
Okay.
All right.
On his back.
Um,

213
00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:40.270
but that look that you're talking about when,
when you say that,

214
00:12:40.271 --> 00:12:44.200
like we have to be able to share a common humanity.
I've been there too.
I mean,

215
00:12:44.201 --> 00:12:48.820
I face these mobs to do and what I find is there's an actual look they have in

216
00:12:48.821 --> 00:12:52.770
their heads where the individual that you just spoke about is gone.

217
00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:57.880
Um,
did you think there was anything,
so I guess there's really,

218
00:12:57.881 --> 00:13:00.100
in that case,
for the people that are watching this,

219
00:13:00.101 --> 00:13:02.170
that think that one day they are going to go against the mob,

220
00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:05.620
is there any other advice you would have for them on how to,
how to do it?

221
00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:09.220
Because that doesn't always work.
I mean,
saying I've done that where I've said,

222
00:13:09.221 --> 00:13:10.960
I'm standing right in front of you.
I'm listening to you.

223
00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:14.580
My name's Dave and it doesn't work that

224
00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:20.490
<v 2>I think that,
um,
I,</v>

225
00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:25.390
I don't know.
I,
I don't know.

226
00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:27.190
You know,
there's that,

227
00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:31.750
there's that scene in Lord of the rings where Aragorn rushes the gates,

228
00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:34.780
you know,
um,
and have more door.

229
00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:39.370
And I of course love those movies.
And,
uh,
you know,

230
00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:42.010
I don't know if I would have,
I don't think,

231
00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:45.520
I don't know if I would be capable of such bravery,
but,
um,

232
00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:50.680
intellectually I definitely am.
That is to say I'm not easily cowed.
Um,

233
00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:52.040
and I,

234
00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:57.270
I have spent my life training myself to think as clearly as I can to look at

235
00:13:57.911 --> 00:14:02.680
evidence to collect evidence.
I'm an if scientist,
I'm an empiricist.
So,
um,

236
00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:04.360
so in the,
in the case of a mob,

237
00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:08.560
I don't think I would yield to a mob intellectually.
Now,
physically,
you know,

238
00:14:08.561 --> 00:14:12.010
if they're,
if they're throwing bricks at you as a different thing,
but I think

239
00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:14.650
<v 1>you too often that threat is always there.</v>

240
00:14:14.651 --> 00:14:17.140
Even if they're not holding a weapon that threads,
right.

241
00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:21.120
<v 2>It's a dangerous situation.
I would agree.
But mass,
you know,</v>

242
00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:24.780
[inaudible] are always dangerous.
But my point is that I think that if you,

243
00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:29.340
if you can keep your calm,
you can think clearly about what you're saying.
Also,

244
00:14:29.341 --> 00:14:32.130
if you've thought about these ideas before in the cool of the day,

245
00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:34.920
so it's not the heat of the moment said,
look,
I really thought about these ideas.

246
00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:37.290
This is not just a sudden heat of passion.
Like I've,

247
00:14:37.291 --> 00:14:39.630
I've thought about this topic or this point,
whatever it is.

248
00:14:39.631 --> 00:14:42.570
It doesn't have to be a political point.
It can be scientific point or something.

249
00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:46.770
Then when you're pressed,
you know,
you can say,
you know,
I'm listening to you.

250
00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:50.910
Here's what I think.
Okay.
What do you think?
I think you can,

251
00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:55.430
I think you can,
you can,
I won't say you can win the battle of ideas,

252
00:14:55.431 --> 00:14:57.450
but you can at least fight it.
Well.
Yeah.

253
00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:01.220
What was the administration's response after this older,
well,

254
00:15:01.221 --> 00:15:05.240
I think the administration faced a difficult challenge in deciding what to do.

255
00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:07.550
Many people have commented on what they did or didn't do.

256
00:15:07.551 --> 00:15:12.140
I'm not sure I want to go into it.
Um,
it took them quite awhile to come to,

257
00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:17.150
to release any kind of public statement in support of us.
Um,
so,

258
00:15:17.151 --> 00:15:18.950
and you know,
many members of the administration,

259
00:15:18.951 --> 00:15:22.160
junior members were actually involved in,
so in the crowd that day,

260
00:15:22.161 --> 00:15:27.080
they were four,
four administrators actually,
uh,
who,
um,
you know,

261
00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:31.100
who's others have since identified.
But,
um,
you know,
I think,

262
00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:34.100
I don't think it was Yale at its best and um,

263
00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:38.510
and I don't in the students were not at their best and I was not at my best.

264
00:15:38.511 --> 00:15:41.270
I did my best,
but you know,
I think I could've done even better.

265
00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:44.330
So as someone that then has lived through it,

266
00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:49.040
where did this go wrong on college campuses because for the past couple of
years,

267
00:15:49.041 --> 00:15:52.850
every time I see one of these stories I think either,
well,
I used to think,

268
00:15:52.851 --> 00:15:55.910
oh this,
this is the end of it now people will really get it.

269
00:15:55.911 --> 00:15:59.450
Like I remember you're the one with you from the other video clip that we didn't

270
00:15:59.451 --> 00:16:02.990
show that people had seen.
It was like,
this is so patently absurd.

271
00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.570
Maybe this will finally be the wake up call.

272
00:16:05.571 --> 00:16:08.420
I've now come to believe that the wake up call,
these can come at anytime soon,

273
00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:13.100
sadly.
Um,
but what,
when do you think as well,

274
00:16:13.101 --> 00:16:16.550
I think this is a complicated topic.
I see.
You know,
this is not,

275
00:16:16.551 --> 00:16:20.720
it was not my area of expertise.
I am a natural and social scientist.

276
00:16:20.721 --> 00:16:25.721
I run a lab with computer scientists and molecular biologists and sociologists

277
00:16:25.881 --> 00:16:26.930
and evolutionary biologists,

278
00:16:26.931 --> 00:16:30.770
and we work around the world who do all kinds of stuff.
So I was,

279
00:16:30.771 --> 00:16:34.150
I have always been committed to liberal principles including to free speech
when,

280
00:16:34.151 --> 00:16:38.750
when I was at Harvard,
before I moved to Yale in 2013,
uh,

281
00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:42.200
my wife and I came to the defense of minority students who were being,
um,

282
00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:45.560
having their right or speech rights squelched on campus.

283
00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:50.510
So I'm committed to these ideas,
but it wasn't the most central part of my life.

284
00:16:50.511 --> 00:16:54.500
And I'm not an expert like John Height or,
or Greg Lukey off look Kiana far,

285
00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:57.890
however,
so,
so I see conflicting evidence.

286
00:16:57.891 --> 00:17:02.390
I agree with you that there are a lot of these salient cases which,

287
00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:04.640
which they weren't before.

288
00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:08.630
And Jonathan feels that they're still rising and they have their own theories.

289
00:17:08.631 --> 00:17:13.550
Jonathan and Greg about why I see other evidence that looks at surveys of

290
00:17:13.551 --> 00:17:16.910
college students and finds that they are no more or less likely to want to

291
00:17:16.911 --> 00:17:20.060
suppress the speech of others than adults and older adults.

292
00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:23.000
It's very tempting to silence people who don't agree with,
right?
I mean,

293
00:17:23.001 --> 00:17:25.940
everyone wants to do that,
but I don't,

294
00:17:25.941 --> 00:17:29.180
I want to talk to them and persuade them like it would be,
it would be,

295
00:17:29.181 --> 00:17:33.230
it's very tempting to like,
you know,
shut the anti-vaxxer is up,
you know,

296
00:17:33.231 --> 00:17:36.770
prevent them from speaking.
But that doesn't win,
right?
That that's not a victory.

297
00:17:36.771 --> 00:17:40.970
What we need to do is persuade them.
Why do you believe,
think this?
So,

298
00:17:40.971 --> 00:17:42.600
so if you compare college students to adults,

299
00:17:42.601 --> 00:17:45.200
some evidence suggests they're not more sanctimonious.

300
00:17:45.201 --> 00:17:48.050
Some evidence suggests there are some polls,
uh,

301
00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:52.980
if you look a disadvantage there clearly rising,
but they're still small.

302
00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:57.030
So,
so the critics say there's a rising level of [inaudible],

303
00:17:57.031 --> 00:18:01.200
which I deplore let me just,
can I go on a degression?
Yeah.
Yes.
So I have no,

304
00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:04.080
let me be very clear because there's a lot of sloppy thinking about this.

305
00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:06.450
Nobody has a right to speak on a college campus.

306
00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:09.480
So I'm not claiming that anyone has the right.

307
00:18:09.481 --> 00:18:12.450
But once a group on campus invites you to speak,

308
00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:16.140
you cannot yield to the mob Verdis invitation.

309
00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:18.540
It totally destroys the university.
It's,

310
00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:20.790
it's the antithesis of what a university should be like.

311
00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:25.170
So you can protest that person,
but you cannot have dissertations.

312
00:18:25.171 --> 00:18:28.950
That's just ridiculous.
So,
so they're,
so those have been rising,

313
00:18:28.951 --> 00:18:31.050
but so the critics say,
look,
this invitation had been rising,

314
00:18:31.051 --> 00:18:35.220
but the defendant saying yes,
but millions of Tok state place and nobody objects.

315
00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:39.630
So it's a tiny minority.
So to answer your question,
I don't,

316
00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:44.040
I don't think we're beyond the hump,
but I'm not the expert to tell you.

317
00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:45.030
How bad is it?

318
00:18:45.370 --> 00:18:49.660
<v 1>Does it say something about the state of liberalism or in a way that,</v>

319
00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:54.940
that this was sort of the end conclusion of liberalism?
I hate to say it,

320
00:18:54.970 --> 00:18:59.380
that it would get sort of usurped by progressivism or whatever the new

321
00:18:59.381 --> 00:19:03.520
collectivist idea was.
In other words,
liberals are tolerant,

322
00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:05.800
liberals generally are live and let live.

323
00:19:06.010 --> 00:19:10.670
So it was sort of fertile ground for people with bad ideas to Russian and kind

324
00:19:10.671 --> 00:19:14.530
of take over where perhaps conservatives are a little harder to get in at

325
00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:18.650
<v 2>they derivatives.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But conservatives have their own political failings.</v>

326
00:19:18.651 --> 00:19:21.470
Right.
But I have no doubt.
Yeah,
they'll move in lock step.

327
00:19:21.471 --> 00:19:25.050
So you can get them to like,
you know,
you two to mark to get,

328
00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:29.640
to get to organize an inquisition.
Right.
So,
you know,
it's not like,
right.

329
00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:32.180
We can conserve.
I'm Larry,
I'm not comparing either one.

330
00:19:32.181 --> 00:19:36.380
I'm just saying that there is a weakness of liberalism,

331
00:19:36.381 --> 00:19:41.150
which is very sad for me to say.
The openness is exactly what invites,
yeah.

332
00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:45.290
So this is the radicalism within.
So I mean I think this is,
I mean I think,

333
00:19:45.291 --> 00:19:49.790
you know,
the open society and its,
and its enemies.
Um,
you know,

334
00:19:49.791 --> 00:19:53.160
I think there is a sense in which you can use the,

335
00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:57.200
the tools to destroy the foundation.
Um,

336
00:19:57.710 --> 00:19:58.580
but I also think,

337
00:19:58.581 --> 00:20:01.490
and this is one of the arguments that I made and I actually believe politically,

338
00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:06.520
which is that these very core commitments to freedom of assembly,

339
00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:10.850
freedom of expression,
which the students were using right now.

340
00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:13.970
Then we're also engaging in harassment,
which is a different topic.

341
00:20:13.971 --> 00:20:16.700
And because I was an actor in those events,
I was,

342
00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:20.270
I didn't feel at liberty to help the students see the difference between freedom

343
00:20:20.271 --> 00:20:21.950
of expression and harassment.
Right.

344
00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:24.140
<v 1>Yeah.
Somehow I don't think they would've been like,
oh,</v>

345
00:20:24.141 --> 00:20:25.560
let's sit down and listen to him as you

346
00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:30.020
<v 2>explains why,
you know,
so you can,
so the classic example is the,
you know,
is that,</v>

347
00:20:30.021 --> 00:20:33.560
you know,
you can,
you can march through the streets of Skokie,
Illinois,

348
00:20:33.561 --> 00:20:38.240
but you can't stop in front of my house.
Right.
Because,
you know,
that is a threat,

349
00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:43.460
uh,
the political expression and a public places not so,
so,

350
00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:48.400
uh,
so the students,
so the,
so,
uh,
um,
I lost my train of thought.

351
00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:53.240
Where was I going?
Uh,
well,
basically the idea that the liberalism and uh,
yeah,

352
00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:55.840
so,
so the,
so the,
so,
so these are chord,

353
00:20:55.841 --> 00:20:59.590
that sort of non-corrupt judiciary sort impartial separation of powers,

354
00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:01.360
freedom of assembly,
freedom of speech.

355
00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:04.300
I regard these as like foundational principles of our democracy,

356
00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:07.720
which are essential liberal principles.
We wrote principles.
Yes,
yes.

357
00:21:07.721 --> 00:21:11.830
Liberal Bristles,
which the students in some ways we're using,
right.
Um,

358
00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:16.210
except to call for people to be fired for expressing their ideas in a collared

359
00:21:16.211 --> 00:21:19.270
campus is using these principles,
but to a liberal ends.

360
00:21:19.271 --> 00:21:21.070
And this is what you're asking,
I think,

361
00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:25.150
which is what you're saying is can these tools be used to like degrade the,

362
00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:29.140
and the answer is yes,
there is a kind of threat from within,

363
00:21:29.141 --> 00:21:32.560
but I still wouldn't abandon the principles and I don't want to abandon the

364
00:21:32.561 --> 00:21:34.000
peanut goes either.
Okay.
There we go.
