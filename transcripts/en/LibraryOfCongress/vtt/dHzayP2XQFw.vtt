00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.420
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:08.250
&gt;&gt; Scott Simon: Really, it
is an honor to talk to you.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.550
It's wonderful.

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:10.850
I'm glad we could do this.

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:12.150
&gt;&gt; Juan Gabriel Vasquez: Thank you.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.450
&gt;&gt; Scott Simon: Let me try to
set the story a little bit.

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.660
Javier Mallarino, your protagonist,

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.330
is the best-known political
cartoonist

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.360
in a political environment
that can be lethal.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.660
&gt;&gt; Juan Gabriel Vasquez: Yes.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.530 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Scott Simon: I think it's fair to
say, Columbia of a generation ago.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:33.030
Describe that territory
to us, if you could.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.340
&gt;&gt; Juan Gabriel Vasquez: First
of all, I'd like to thank you

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.140
and thank you all for coming, to
thank Mr. Ambassador for his words.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.360
I always have the impression that
ambassadors are always trying

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.620
to redress what we
novelists mess up.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:48.920
[Laughter].

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.980
To thank you very much.

00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:05.530
Yeah, this novel was written in
2012-2013 at a point in which I had

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.790
to explain to readers
outside of my country the fact

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.200 position:56%
that this story the novel tells us
is actually plausible in my country.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.590
It is the story of
a cartoonist who is

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.620
so powerful that he is threatened.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.570
He is feared.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.620
He is very well respected.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.230
He is able to change the climate

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.690
of political opinion
in very direct ways.

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.370
In 2013, this was not
easily understandable

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.540
in countries other than mine.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.760 position:56%
We have a strong tradition of
cartoonists who are actually this --

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.130
very powerful people whose
opinions are respected.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:58.080
Coming from the 19th century, and
in particular, a cartoonist working

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:08.560
in the 20s who was a tremendous
symbol of what the relationship

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.800
between political opinion and the
political world was in my country.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.740
His name was Ricardo
Rendon [phonetic].

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.400
This is the character but
also tries to put in place.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:30.930 position:56%
This person who, through drying
politicians in a national newspaper,

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.060
is able to achieve real
political influence

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:43.600
and to model the political
discussion in my country.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:49.130 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Scott Simon: Even the
politicians whom he savages are kind

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.610
of flattered by it,
because it means they count.

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.880
&gt;&gt; Juan Gabriel Vasquez:
Well, they exist, yes.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.040
They have figured out
that being destroyed

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.350
by Javier Mallarino is
effectively to exist

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.330
in the political world in Columbia.

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:12.830
But the thing is, that
kind of power in the hands

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.750
of a political cartoonist is
not something that my readers

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.090
in translation were
used to five years ago.

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.700
And this has been a
very interesting,

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.840
a very dramatic thing
for me to witness.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:33.040
Within four years, since the novel
was published in 2013 in Spanish,

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.620
the world has changed so much, that
actually is more understandable

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:47.550 position:56%
that political cartoonists are
influential, because they have been.

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:54.470
In terms of international news,
everybody knows what has happened

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.100
with political cartoonists
such as those

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:03.000
in the Charlie Hebdo
magazine in France.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.820
&gt;&gt; Scott Simon: I know you spent
some years living in Paris,

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:11.580
but you wrote this novel
before Charlie Hebdo.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.260
&gt;&gt; Juan Gabriel Vasquez: Yes.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.970
&gt;&gt; Scott Simon: Before
the terrible crime.

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:17.270 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Juan Gabriel Vasquez: Yeah, yeah.

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:20.550
Before that horrible thing.

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:26.460
That happened, I think,
maybe a couple of years

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.450
after my novel was published.

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:33.120
It was a couple of years later

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.420
because the French translation
had already appeared.

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:40.930
So yeah, it had this weird
coincidence in time for me.

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.820
The fact that the novel
was becoming reality

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.790
in so many countries in the world.

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:48.890
&gt;&gt; Scott Simon: As the story
opens, the cartoonist is

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:53.260
about to be given the honor of
having his self caricature put

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.200
on a national postage stamp.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:01.320
He comes in contact with a young
woman who he doesn't remember.

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:06.210
She's posing as a reporter, which
by the way, is astonishingly easy.

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:13.800
Takes no knowledge whatsoever --
I'm in some position to tell you.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.580
Let me put it this way, he
comes to terms with the fact

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.670
that what he does, does not
always have positive consequences.

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:21.970 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Juan Gabriel Vasquez: That's more

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:23.300
of the situation explored
in the novel.

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.420
Yes. This young lady, we're
not going to reveal too much

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:32.040
of the plot -- don't worry.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:38.250
Petition lady comes to him
to ask him to remember,

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:45.310
to remember the past, to remember a
night that happened 28 years before

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:53.650
in which something may or may not
have happened at Mallarino's house.

00:05:53.650 --> 00:06:04.120
That event, of that night,
caused Mallarino to draw one

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:09.710
of his most famous cartoons.

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:14.050
And this girl, who 28 years
later, she is asking him

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:17.130
to remember what he
saw during that night.

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:23.480
And he realizes that he may not
have seen what he thinks he saw.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:30.150
That his cartoon, after
all, may be groundless.

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:34.570
This is the situation
explored in the novel.

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:40.840
It was very strange for me to begin
a novel in which my main subject,

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:49.120
my main idea, was the discussion
of the vulnerability of our image

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:53.360
in the hands of people who have
an influence on public opinion.

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:58.060
But as the novel progressed,
I realized I was writing

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:01.160
about something else also.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.500
I was writing about
the vulnerability

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.800
of our private memories, the fact

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.260
that we are never sure
of what we remember.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:12.600
This difficult relationship
we have with memory became one

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:16.230
of the main themes in the novel.

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:17.690
&gt;&gt; Scott Simon: There are
lots I could read from.

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:21.910
It's beautifully written
and beautifully translated.

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:23.910 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Juan Gabriel Vasquez: Beautifully
translated by Ann McLean.

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:27.230
&gt;&gt; Scott Simon: I have to ask,
why didn't you do the translation?

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:31.820
&gt;&gt; Juan Gabriel Vasquez: Because
Ann McLean would be out of a job.

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:33.930
[Laughter].

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:36.070
She is a friend of mine.

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:38.110
I don't want to do that.

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:41.530
&gt;&gt; Scott Simon: You have
done some translation.

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:45.590
&gt;&gt; Juan Gabriel Vasquez:
No, the real reason is

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:55.890
that literature is too difficult
to -- Let's put it this way,

00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:58.260
you should always have
done some translation.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.160
I've earned a living
as a translator.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.970
But you translate towards
your own language,

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:09.180
because this is the language
in which you are close to 100%.

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:15.580 position:56%
I'm not close to 100% in English and
that's something I prefer to leave

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:17.430
in the hands of somebody who is.

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:26.260
And I have this great luck of
having one of the best translators

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.090
of Spanish-language
literature in the world.

00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:36.390
That doesn't mean I don't
dig in as soon as I can.

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:38.680
We work closely together.

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:44.210
I try to bother her
as much as I can.

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:48.500
But I never lose sight of the
fact that for me as a translator,

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:50.680
one of the worst things
in the world was a writer

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:54.170
who thought they knew my language.

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:57.710
So I try never to be that
writer -- so Ann McLean.

00:08:57.710 --> 00:09:03.240
&gt;&gt; Scott Simon: I want to read
a section and ask you about it.

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:04.850
I love this section.

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:07.580
"Life is the best caricature.

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:11.370
Life turns us into
caricatures of ourselves.

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:14.700
We all have the obligation to
make the best caricature possible,

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:20.230
to camouflage what we don't like,
and exalt what we like best.

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:22.720
You will understand, says the
cartoonist, I'm just not talking

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:27.380
about physical attributes, but the
mysterious life traces life leads

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:31.140
on our features, the moral
landscape, if you will.

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:35.030 position:56%
That moral landscape that gets
drawn onto our face as life goes by,

00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:40.530
as we go along making mistakes
or getting things right."

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:47.300
It reminded me, there's a
story of Abraham Lincoln,

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:50.100
who used to be a model for
presidential disposition,

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:51.950
but of course has recently
been replaced.

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:56.210
I'm sorry, I just have to
avoid these cheap jokes.

00:09:56.210 --> 00:10:01.510
But Lincoln notably was resisting
the urging of some of his aides

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:04.440
to appoint someone as the
local postmaster somewhere.

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:05.990
And they said why,
and he said, "Well,

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:07.290
because I don't like his face."

00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:10.170
And they said, "Mr. President,
you can't refuse to appoint a man

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:11.470
because you don't like his face."

00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:14.080
And he said, "Nonsense,
after the age of 40,

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:16.610
every man is responsible
for his own face."

00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:17.910
&gt;&gt; Juan Gabriel Vasquez: Very good.

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:19.210
Very good.

00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:23.160
I wish you had told me that before.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.460
[Cross-talk].

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:28.610
&gt;&gt; Scott Simon: But help
us understand a caricature

00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:31.980
at how the cartoonist sees his art.

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:38.080
Because that has something to do
with literature too, doesn't it?

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:39.380
&gt;&gt; Juan Gabriel Vasquez:
Yes in a way.

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:45.650
For me to have something to do
with journalism and the terms

00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:49.300
that I understood journalism at the
time when I was writing the book.

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:53.810
I used to be a weekly political
columnist in my country.

00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:55.520
I did that for seven years.

00:10:55.520 --> 00:11:00.010
I wrote political columns
weekly for seven years.

00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:06.600 position:56%
Then I stopped because I was writing
a very long, very difficult novel

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:13.990
that I will inflict
on you all next year.

00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:18.210
To have both things at the
same time, it became difficult.

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:20.710
So I quit political
commentary for a while.

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:23.990
I still do it once in a while,
every time something pops

00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:31.340 position:56%
up that makes me angry or indignant,
which is most of the time.

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:39.970
But this idea of -- this particular
relationship we have as columnists

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:48.480
with readers, these
distortions of relationships

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:54.290
that I began witnessing the way
it's very easy to create tensions

00:11:54.290 --> 00:11:56.880
in a room just by walking in.

00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:03.090
The way I lost friends, the
way I had fights with family.

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:07.580
All my neurosis went into the
character of Javier Mallarino.

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:13.520
So discussing Colombian
political reality

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:19.360
in print was what led directly
to the character and the way

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:23.230
and the position he has, or
rather the relationship he has

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:28.930
with his readers in Columbia.

00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:31.120
&gt;&gt; Scott Simon: Is that what
we do with our memories?

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:34.350
Do we caricature our
life experience?

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:39.240
&gt;&gt; Juan Gabriel Vasquez: I
think we streamline them, yes.

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:43.670
I mean, nobody knows
really how memory works.

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:50.070
This is one of the ideas
at the center of the book.

00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:57.670
This immense talent memory has
to manipulate us the way --

00:12:57.670 --> 00:13:03.570
our memories are obviously
the only window we have

00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:06.530
into our past experiences.

00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:08.680
There's nothing else.

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:11.670
Obviously, there are
other people's memories,

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:15.010
and this is why we read books.

00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:21.430
But this window so fragile,
so easily distorted,

00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:26.100
so tainted by subjectivity,
by prejudice,

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:30.560
by whatever we would
have liked to happen.

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:33.480
This is more or less
what we remember.

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:36.700
Or rather, we are very,
very good at suppressing.

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:39.510
Obviously, this is commonplace.

00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:44.740
We are very good at
suppressing what we don't like.

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:51.660
So this relationship with memory
became very interesting for me.

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:53.290
How it manipulates us.

00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:56.370
How we are never sure
really that we experienced

00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:59.740
or witnessed what we think
we witnessed or experienced.

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:03.310
And this is what happens
to the character,

00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:06.500
who thinks he sees something

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:12.650
and then draws a very
controversial cartoon

00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:16.460
which has a strong impact
on somebody else's life.

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:21.080
And so, years later he doesn't
really know what was there.

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:24.130
&gt;&gt; Scott Simon: I think a lot of
Americans who read about the life

00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:28.040
of Richard Nixon might be
reminded it's sometimes hard

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:34.460
to enlist a sympathetic memory for
Richard Nixon for many Americans.

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:38.320
But there was perhaps the great
political cartoonist of his time,

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:46.400
Herb Block of Washington Post,
did a very noteworthy caricature,

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:50.060
day after day obviously in the
news of this very swarthy, bearded,

00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:53.890
sort of 5 o'clock shadow Nixon.

00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:59.100
And he told interviewer
a number of years ago

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:03.250 position:56%
that he would bring the Post in
when it was delivered in the morning

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:06.080
so his daughters wouldn't see it,

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:08.650
because he didn't want
his daughters --

00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:09.950
&gt;&gt; Juan Gabriel Vasquez: Yes.

00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:11.860
I got the story, or
variations of that story,

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:15.790
quite often while I was
researching for the novel.

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:20.810
Perhaps the greatest
cartoonist of his generation

00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:24.500
in Columbia is called
Vlado [phonetic].

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:27.980
His pen name is Vlado.

00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:31.150
He has become a friend of mine
since the writing of the novel

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:34.330
because he was a source
of information for me,

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:37.010 position:56%
an invaluable source of information.

00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:39.660
And one of the stories
he told me was

00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:44.650
that once he had started
making cartoons

00:15:44.650 --> 00:15:52.390
of this very powerful military
man in Columbia, who at the time,

00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:59.350
used these dark glasses,
sort of Pinochet style.

00:15:59.350 --> 00:16:07.550
And he had very crooked teeth,
extremely crooked smile.

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:10.910
And this is the way he was drawn.

00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:16.570 position:56%
So one day my friend the
cartoonist gets this message from --

00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:23.190
I think he was a general --
asking him for a meeting.

00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:26.500
So when the general
asks the cartoonist

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:29.020
for a meeting, you understand --

00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:31.560
&gt;&gt; Scott Simon: Did he drive
a tank up to his office?

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:33.560
&gt;&gt; Juan Gabriel Vasquez: I
think there was nowhere to park.

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:43.500
In the meeting he said, "Look,
I have change my glasses.

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:48.630
I have gone to the dentist.

00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:52.070
And you still draw
me as I was before.

00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:53.370
Please don't do that.

00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:55.700
My children hate the drawings.

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:57.000
They make fun of me.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.010
My wife is sad, etc, etc."

00:16:59.010 --> 00:17:03.000
My friend said, "General,
that money is down the drain,

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.810
because I will join you as I wish.

00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:11.790 position:56%
This is your cartoon persona and
this is what you will be in the eyes

00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:13.190
of the Colombian public."

00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:16.360
So this is the power they have,
which is sometimes unfair.

00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:19.340
But you know, who cares.

00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:21.980
[Laughter]

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:24.380
&gt;&gt; Scott Simon: Your work has
been described as a reaction

00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:28.770
to magic realism, of which
we've read so much coming

00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:30.500
from great Latin American authors.

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:35.050
How you feel about that?

00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:37.700
&gt;&gt; Juan Gabriel Vasquez: I think
that has always, even with the best

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:40.180
of intentions, has always
been oversimplified.

00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:48.520
What I feel is gratitude
towards Garcia Marquez.

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:54.320 position:56%
One of the great advantages --
Garcia Marquez doesn't need any kind

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:58.840
of presentation, but he is of
course credited with having

00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:05.960
in a way invented this new lens
-- it was new in the 60's --

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:09.170
to examine Latin American
reality which is magical realism,

00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:14.800
which was taken up by
writers all over the world.

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:25.580
So nobody ever asks Salman Rushdie
or Mo Yan in China or Ben Okri

00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:32.380 position:56%
in Nigeria or [Inaudible] in the
French Caribbean, how did they write

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:34.530
under the influence
of Garcia Marquez?

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:38.780
But I get that question
all the time.

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:40.080
[Laughter]

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:41.850
&gt;&gt; Scott Simon: Do you notice
how artfully I actually left

00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:43.150
out his name?

00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:44.450
&gt;&gt; Juan Gabriel Vasquez:
Yes, very good.

00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:45.750
&gt;&gt; Scott Simon: I was trying

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:47.050
to avoid asking you
for the umpteenth time.

00:18:47.050 --> 00:18:49.350
Sorry.

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:57.810
&gt;&gt; Juan Gabriel Vasquez:
So the thing with this is

00:18:57.810 --> 00:19:07.070
that this question that you
have so artfully not asked,

00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:11.790
it presupposes there is a sort
of territorial relationship

00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:19.810
and influence, that
influence is territorial.

00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:25.850
It's justifiable, but it's
almost never true in literature.

00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:31.240
The fact that I'm Colombian in
no way means that the influence

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:35.750
of the great Colombian writer
immediately falls on my shoulders,

00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:40.630
like it's not influenced by
influenza, like you're going

00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:42.300
through the streets
and somebody sneezes,

00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:48.240
and you get magical
realism all of a sudden.

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:52.440 position:56%
[Laughter] Writers, and Garcia
Marquez is the best example of this,

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:54.590
when he started writing novels,

00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:57.980
there was no Columbia
novelistic traditions to speak of.

00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:03.090 position:56%
We had a couple of great novels, but
there was not a tradition as such.

00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:08.830
And so, he decided his master
would be Faulkner because he wrote

00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:12.260
about a world very similar to
the world of Garcia Marquez.

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:17.590
And then he got tired of Faulkner,
and, in a way, hired Hemingway.

00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:22.850
Come, teach me how
to write short novels

00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:25.640
with spare dialogues
and economic prose.

00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:28.840
And so, Hemingway did
the trick for one book.

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:34.050
And so, this mixture of
influences, Faulkner, Hemingway,

00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:40.680
Kafka -- a little bit of Kafka.

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:45.370
For his second novel,
"An Evil Hour,"

00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:47.950
he copied Albert Camus, in a way.

00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:52.040
And that cocktail -- none of
these writers were Colombian --

00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:56.400
and that cocktail allowed
him to discover his voice,

00:20:56.400 --> 00:21:00.950
the voice in which he wrote
"One Hundred Years of Solitude."

00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:04.010
That is more or less the
way it worked for me.

00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:06.880
I grew up with Garcia
Marquez as a reader.

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:11.010
I have always admired Garcia
Marquez as a novelist.

00:21:11.010 --> 00:21:12.310
I think he is one of the two

00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:17.890
or three great stylists
in the Spanish language.

00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:23.100
But these images, these
characters that I had

00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:25.930
in my head needed a different shape

00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:29.480
than magical realism
was able to provide.

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:35.150 position:56%
I found that in other Latin American
writers, such as Mario [Inaudible]

00:21:35.150 --> 00:21:39.650 position:56%
or Juan Carlos Zanetti from Uruguay.

00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:42.920
I found that in American writers

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:47.690
like Philip Roth, in
European writers.

00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:51.170
You don't want to know
the list of them.

00:21:51.170 --> 00:21:57.390
But this is how influence,
in a way, happens.

00:21:57.390 --> 00:22:02.240
You have this image in your
head, and you choose the writers

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:06.980
who have the tools you need to
make that become literature.

00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:11.530
In my case, it wasn't
Garcia Marquez.

00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:15.750
There is one advantage I have
over Garcia Marquez is the fact

00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:19.760
that I write in a world in which
Garcia Marquez already exists.

00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:21.300
He didn't.

00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:25.530
He didn't write in a world in which
Garcia Marquez had already written

00:22:25.530 --> 00:22:26.830
his wonderful novels.

00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:33.040
So my tradition is better for
that fact and I'm lucky here.

00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:34.340
So this is what happens.

00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:35.640
&gt;&gt; Scott Simon: Yeah.

00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:36.940
We want to invite your questions.

00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:38.470
There are a couple of
microphones up here.

00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:42.210
We'll tell you that this event
is being recorded for posterity,

00:22:42.210 --> 00:22:46.530
so if you're wearing a T-shirt with
some kind of indiscreet slogan,

00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:49.460
you might want to strip
to your waist.

00:22:51.090 --> 00:22:54.280
[Laughter] Just do it
anyway -- we're all friends.

00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:58.580
As people advance on the mic,
let me work in one more question.

00:22:58.580 --> 00:23:02.030
You spent years living in
Europe, Paris, Barcelona.

00:23:02.030 --> 00:23:05.640
Easier or harder to
write about Columbia

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:08.400 position:56%
in Columbia than it was from Europe?

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:09.700
&gt;&gt; Juan Gabriel Vasquez: Both.

00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:18.250
It was definitely easier in
the sense that that cliché,

00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:22.500 position:56%
that unique perspective to talk
about your own country that you need

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:29.600
to get out of the woods in
order to have a better look

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:32.900
at the whole thing,
that's really true.

00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:37.610
But on the other hand, I
started writing novels in a world

00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:42.320
in which the Internet was not
as all- pervading as it is now.

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:49.130
So for my first real novel,
which is called "the Informers,"

00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:52.490
I didn't have a strong relationship
with the Internet at that time.

00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:59.890
I wrote that novel in 2002,
so I remember perfectly having

00:23:59.890 --> 00:24:04.760
to call my father and ask him
to go to such-and-such corner.

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:07.290
Tell me what you see there.

00:24:07.290 --> 00:24:10.550
Are you able to see the door

00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:15.250
where Jorge Eliécer Gaitán left the
building before he was murdered?

00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:21.560
And so I had these informers that
allowed me to write my books.

00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:22.860
&gt;&gt; Scott Simon: Yeah.

00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:24.900
And now of course,
that's on Google maps.

00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:26.200
&gt;&gt; Juan Gabriel Vasquez: Exactly.

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:27.800
&gt;&gt; Scott Simon: Has anyone
advanced on the microphones?

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:30.990
I don't hear.

00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:33.050
Yes, by all means.

00:24:33.050 --> 00:24:35.040
You first, sir.

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:37.790
&gt;&gt; Questioner: I'm curious.

00:24:37.790 --> 00:24:41.920
Having seen the popular depictions
of things like narcos and whatnot

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:48.930
in popular culture, are there any
that you're particularly interested

00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:50.890
in and would want to react to?

00:24:50.890 --> 00:24:55.940
Say, for instance, from the
pervasiveness of Escobar

00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:57.820
and thoughts about Columbia?

00:24:57.820 --> 00:25:02.720 position:56%
What are the things you mentioned
earlier that provoke you to respond?

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:08.380
&gt;&gt; Juan Gabriel Vasquez: I
don't think we have enough time

00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:12.850
to let's talk about one
of those things that are

00:25:12.850 --> 00:25:20.750
in direct relationship with the
other part of your question.

00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:29.750
I have always felt angry
and sad and disappointed

00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:32.090
at this thing we have
called the war on drugs.

00:25:32.090 --> 00:25:34.470
But I think it's a huge mistake.

00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:37.100 position:56%
It has been a huge mistake 30 years.

00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:43.100
I think it has damaged and
destroyed people's lives

00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:47.220
in a way that is not justifiable.

00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:51.090
Because drugs are essentially --
this is the situation in my country

00:25:51.090 --> 00:25:57.350 position:56%
and this is the situation in America
too -- drugs are a twofold problem.

00:25:57.350 --> 00:26:03.420
They are a public health issue in
that drug consumption is a problem.

00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:07.350
And they are a public order
issue, in that the fact

00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:15.270
that they are criminalized needs
to criminality, corruption,

00:26:15.270 --> 00:26:18.850
enormous wealth in the wrong hands,

00:26:18.850 --> 00:26:22.530
in the hands of the Mafia,
of criminal structures.

00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:28.890
And that destabilizes
democracies, kills innocent people.

00:26:28.890 --> 00:26:34.620
And I have always defended the
idea that decriminalization

00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:36.800
of drugs would lead us
with only one problem.

00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:41.950
The problem, how to solve the
fact that people take drugs

00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:46.560
and that damages their health.

00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:51.390
The enormous amount of
money we spend on the war

00:26:51.390 --> 00:26:54.680
on drugs could be spent
on prevention,

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:57.510
treatment, education, etc.

00:26:57.510 --> 00:27:04.000
[ Applause ]

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.380
&gt;&gt; Juan Gabriel Vasquez: Thank you.

00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:06.680
So yeah, that's it.

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:08.880
As for narcos, I haven't
seen that show.

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:11.470
[Laughter]

00:27:11.470 --> 00:27:12.770
&gt;&gt; Scott Simon: Yes, sir?

00:27:12.770 --> 00:27:15.600
&gt;&gt; Questioner: First of all, thank
you for a wonderful interview,

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:18.730 position:56%
both Mr. Vasquez and to Scott Simon.

00:27:18.730 --> 00:27:21.870
Every Saturday for me begins
with Scott Simon on NPR.

00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:24.160
This is been wonderful to see.

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:25.460
&gt;&gt; Scott Simon: Thank you.

00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:28.910 position:56%
That's very kind of you to say that.

00:27:28.910 --> 00:27:31.360
It's a great privilege to be
able to talk to so many people.

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:32.660
Thank you.

00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:34.690 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Questioner: I have two questions.

00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:40.080
One is -- how are the
libel laws in Columbia

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:42.700
and do they protect
political cartoons?

00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:45.360
You mentioned the general
and the journalist.

00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:48.060
Was there any corrective
action taken

00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:50.240
against the journalist
by the general?

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:51.540
That's number one.

00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:55.540
And number two, since you mentioned
that you are a political columnist,

00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:58.330
and I hope I'm getting
my facts right,

00:27:58.330 --> 00:27:59.940
a year ago there was an
agreement [inaudible].

00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:06.160
I just want your commentary
on how does all that progress,

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:09.610
because we heard there
was an agreement

00:28:09.610 --> 00:28:18.810
and the agreement fell apart and
then something else was going on.

00:28:18.810 --> 00:28:20.110
&gt;&gt; Juan Gabriel Vasquez: Yeah.

00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:26.980
That's kind of a long answer
too, one that I'm glad to give.

00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:31.830
About the peace process, yes, there
was a successful peace process.

00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:36.400
The first successful peace process
in the history of my country,

00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:41.570
a country that has
been at war with itself

00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:45.630
for the best part of
the 20th century.

00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:52.050 position:56%
This kind of violence began in 1948.

00:28:52.050 --> 00:29:00.550
The FARC, the Marxist
guerrilla, was born in 1964.

00:29:00.550 --> 00:29:06.760
The peace negotiations effectively
ended that war, a 52-year-old war

00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:12.040
that had caused almost 7 million
victims, counting the dead,

00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:14.770
the wounded, the displaced
population.

00:29:14.770 --> 00:29:24.300
And that agreement sadly was
defeated in a referendum,

00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:29.300
which to my mind was part of
the same international movement

00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:38.540
of populism fueled with lies,
misrepresentations, and calamities

00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:43.970
that caused Brexit and
a certain president.

00:29:45.910 --> 00:29:51.640
[Laughter] That was a sad
day for Colombians who think

00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:59.630
that the peace process, the
negotiation, was the way to go.

00:29:59.630 --> 00:30:09.940
But after that, the agreements
were passed by Congress.

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:14.750
So they are being implemented
right now.

00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:21.240
The parties modified the agreements
in almost every way that was asked

00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:27.040
by the opposition, and they
are now being implemented.

00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:36.000
There was a picture of the
paper six or seven months ago

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:42.530
in which the biggest room in
the military hospital in Bogotá,

00:30:42.530 --> 00:30:49.150
a room that used to be
filled with wounded soldiers,

00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:52.970
was empty for the first
time in 50 years.

00:30:52.970 --> 00:30:59.880
[Applause] That was a good moment.

00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:05.930
That's the situation.

00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:08.700
And your other question was?

00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:10.000
&gt;&gt; Questioner: The libel laws.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.300
&gt;&gt; Juan Gabriel Vasquez: Yeah.

00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:18.660
Freedom of expression is
protected in very effective ways

00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:23.970
in my country from what I can see.

00:31:23.970 --> 00:31:33.580
That doesn't prevent the most
radical politicians to circumvent

00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:37.390
that kind of thing
and attack journalists

00:31:37.390 --> 00:31:44.050
through the social media
using lies, using calamities

00:31:44.050 --> 00:31:51.520 position:56%
to intimidate cartoonists, political
commentators, political journalists.

00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:54.720
So it's a difficult situation.

00:31:54.720 --> 00:32:06.110 position:56%
I think social media has changed all
this relationship, all this world,

00:32:06.110 --> 00:32:10.280
so dramatically that we are still
grasping with the consequences

00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:12.370
of that in terms of the law.

00:32:12.370 --> 00:32:17.320
We don't really know how that
works in this brave new world.

00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:22.420 position:56%
But I'm afraid that's all I can say.

00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:23.720
Thank you.

00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:25.940
&gt;&gt; Scott Simon: I'm going
to try and be respectful

00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:27.240
of everybody's time here.

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:30.020
I know there's a lot to see
at this wonderful event.

00:32:30.020 --> 00:32:35.230
That's get to as many questions
as we can, kind of make it

00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:39.760
like the last round of
Jeopardy or something.

00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:41.060
&gt;&gt; Questioner: Hello.

00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:43.130
Have you ever thought
about modeling any

00:32:43.130 --> 00:32:48.640
of your characters on
Father Camilo Torres?

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:52.070
&gt;&gt; Juan Gabriel Vasquez:
I didn't hear that.

00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:55.510
&gt;&gt; Questioner: Camilo
Torres Restrepo?

00:32:55.510 --> 00:32:56.810
&gt;&gt; Juan Gabriel Vasquez:
Camilo Torres?

00:32:56.810 --> 00:32:58.110
&gt;&gt; Questioner: Yeah.

00:32:58.110 --> 00:32:59.410
&gt;&gt; Juan Gabriel Vasquez:
Have I thought

00:32:59.410 --> 00:33:03.700
of making him a character
in one of my books?

00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:07.360
Well, no, but that's an
extremely good idea, my think.

00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:11.250
Thank you very much.

00:33:11.250 --> 00:33:16.450
&gt;&gt; Scott Simon: Do
you have an agent?

00:33:16.450 --> 00:33:18.510
&gt;&gt; Questioner: Do you say
anything about [Inaudible]?

00:33:18.510 --> 00:33:20.330
&gt;&gt; Juan Gabriel Vasquez: What
do you think about [Inaudible]?

00:33:20.330 --> 00:33:25.000
[Inaudible], in case he
is not familiar to you,

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:28.570 position:56%
is the other great Colombian writer
in the generation of Garcia Marquez.

00:33:28.570 --> 00:33:37.240
He was Garcia Marquez's friend in
many ways, a kind of accomplice,

00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:40.590
I think, and mentor in a way.

00:33:40.590 --> 00:33:42.960
He was an extremely generous
person, a wonderful writer,

00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:46.250
although I prefer his
poetry to his prose.

00:33:46.250 --> 00:33:50.800
But I think if his work
is translated English,

00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:57.490
which I'm not sure about, I really
encourage you to read his work.

00:33:57.490 --> 00:34:00.240
I share something with
him, and it's a fascination

00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:03.550
for the work of Joseph Conrad.

00:34:03.550 --> 00:34:06.350
So this is one thing
we have in common.

00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:07.650
He is a great writer.

00:34:07.650 --> 00:34:09.340 position:56%
Thank you for bringing that name up.

00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:10.640
&gt;&gt; Scott Simon: Yes ma'am?

00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:14.100
&gt;&gt; Questioner: It's an
honor to meet you finally.

00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:18.890
Your book "El Ruido de las Cosas al
Caer" is one of my favorite books.

00:34:18.890 --> 00:34:22.270
My question for you is, what do you
consider is the role of literature

00:34:22.270 --> 00:34:26.370
to heal the collective
grief of Columbia?

00:34:26.370 --> 00:34:28.960
&gt;&gt; Juan Gabriel Vasquez: Wow!

00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:33.680
We should get two hours
more for this conversation.

00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:39.360
Let me put it this way; this is
the most succinct way I can find

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:40.660
of answering this question.

00:34:40.660 --> 00:34:49.900
I think one of the things
we should be able to do --

00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:53.810
ask Colombians right now with
this peace process going on,

00:34:53.810 --> 00:34:58.890
is find a common narrative.

00:34:58.890 --> 00:35:06.920
That is to say, this last 52 years
that the war lasted in Columbia,

00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:11.350 position:56%
that created so much suffering on so
many levels, so many different types

00:35:11.350 --> 00:35:18.020
of violence on so many levels.

00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:22.990
One story is told by a
victim of the guerrilla.

00:35:22.990 --> 00:35:25.450
There are different stories
that are told by the victims

00:35:25.450 --> 00:35:27.010
of the extreme right
wing [inaudible].

00:35:27.010 --> 00:35:35.530
Different stories are told by
an inhabitant of the cities.

00:35:35.530 --> 00:35:40.160
And a different story if
it's being told by a peasant.

00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:42.070
So what do we do with this?

00:35:42.070 --> 00:35:45.740
I think this where
literature can step in and try

00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:52.810
to reconcile all the different
versions of our last 50 years,

00:35:52.810 --> 00:35:57.480
or try to communicate the idea

00:35:57.480 --> 00:36:01.230 position:56%
that having all these very different
versions is not a handicap.

00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:02.590
It's good.

00:36:02.590 --> 00:36:06.710
This is what democracy is
about, telling different stories

00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:13.810 position:56%
about the same thing and having them
all be part of the Colombian story.

00:36:13.810 --> 00:36:17.340
So this is, I think,
what we should try to do.

00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:20.240
This is the reason I
write novels in a way,

00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:26.850 position:56%
to try to validate a certain version
of history of our common past,

00:36:26.850 --> 00:36:28.180
keeping in mind that it's different

00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:32.770
from other versions,
and that's good.

00:36:32.770 --> 00:36:34.370
So, yeah.

00:36:34.370 --> 00:36:35.680
&gt;&gt; Scott Simon: Yes, ma'am?

00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:38.400
&gt;&gt; Questioner: That sort
of leads into my question.

00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:39.850
&gt;&gt; Juan Gabriel Vasquez: Good.

00:36:39.850 --> 00:36:44.480
&gt;&gt; Questioner: Do you think
novelists are esteemed

00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:50.650
or valued differently in Columbia
and they are in this country?

00:36:50.650 --> 00:36:51.950
&gt;&gt; Juan Gabriel Vasquez: Yes.

00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:55.780
Yes, I didn't really do.

00:36:55.780 --> 00:37:00.990
I think for reasons that
would be too long to explain

00:37:00.990 --> 00:37:09.020 position:56%
and that I don't really understand
completely, the position of a writer

00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:11.280
in the American tradition is
different from the position

00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:14.080
of a writer in the Latin
American tradition.

00:37:15.910 --> 00:37:20.030
Maybe because, as Latin Americans,

00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:25.570
we come from the French
ideal of the intellectual.

00:37:25.570 --> 00:37:32.090 position:56%
So novelists are expected to
participate in the political debate,

00:37:32.090 --> 00:37:39.840
to participate in the social
debates of their time.

00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:45.540
In that changes the
situation of writers.

00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:52.610
I don't think an American novelist
would be expected immediately

00:37:52.610 --> 00:37:57.260
to have all the answers ready
as to the political situation

00:37:57.260 --> 00:38:00.830
of their country at
any public event.

00:38:00.830 --> 00:38:06.660
As Latin Americans, we know
we are, and it's not easy.

00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:12.570
And we always have to keep in mind
that ours is the tradition also

00:38:12.570 --> 00:38:19.250
of such great writers that
shapes 20th century literature

00:38:19.250 --> 00:38:23.110
as Jorge Luis Borges, who is not

00:38:23.110 --> 00:38:27.220
in any recognizable
way a political writer.

00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:29.800
He was not a political writer
in the sense that Garcia Marquez

00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:31.420
or Mario Vargas Llosa were.

00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:33.900
So we have both worlds
in Latin America,

00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:42.880
but there is this expectation that
novelists should fulfill that idea.

00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:45.680
It's not always fair.

00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:56.050 position:56%
Garcia Marquez himself said the
writer's only task is to write well.

00:38:56.050 --> 00:38:57.660
Some days I agree with him.

00:38:57.660 --> 00:38:59.980
Some days I don't.

00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:05.850
I think that's the
main difference, yes.

00:39:05.850 --> 00:39:10.460
&gt;&gt; Scott Simon: Juan Gabriel
Vasquez, it's been a great honor

00:39:10.460 --> 00:39:12.120
for me to be his interlocutor here.

00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:13.420
Thank you very much.

00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:17.000
The book we spoke about
is "Reputations."

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:20.000
You'll be available to sign
the odd copy if someone asks?

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.580
&gt;&gt; Juan Gabriel Vasquez:
Yes, as many as you want.

00:39:23.580 --> 00:39:25.470
&gt;&gt; Scott Simon: I believe, as
we say in the United States,

00:39:25.470 --> 00:39:26.990
you'll sign until the
cows come home.

00:39:26.990 --> 00:39:28.820
Thank you very much for joining us.

00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:30.230
It's been great.

00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:32.030
&gt;&gt; Juan Gabriel Vasquez:
Yes, thank you.

00:39:32.030 --> 00:39:35.850
[Applause]

00:39:35.850 --> 00:39:39.720
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
