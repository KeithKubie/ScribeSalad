00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:01.033
- [Voiceover] What I want to do with

00:00:01.033 --> 00:00:04.433
this video is come up with
the formula for the arc

00:00:04.433 --> 00:00:08.433
length of a curve that's
defined in polar coordinates.

00:00:08.433 --> 00:00:10.433
So, if this curve right over here is r

00:00:10.433 --> 00:00:12.900
is equal to F of theta, how do we figure

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.833
out the length of this curve between two

00:00:16.833 --> 00:00:19.300
thetas, say between theta is equal to,

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.433
well let's say, in this case, it looks

00:00:20.433 --> 00:00:22.567
like between theta zero radius and say, pi

00:00:22.567 --> 00:00:27.466
over two radius, but between
any two bounds for r theta.

00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:29.233
So the way we're going to do this, an if

00:00:29.233 --> 00:00:30.833
at any point you get excited or

00:00:30.833 --> 00:00:32.567
inspired, you definitely should pause

00:00:32.567 --> 00:00:34.633
the video and see if you can run with the

00:00:34.633 --> 00:00:36.100
formula for arc length when you're

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.933
dealing with something in polar form.

00:00:38.301 --> 00:00:39.433
But the way that we're going to tackle

00:00:39.433 --> 00:00:41.166
it is the exact same way that we tackled

00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:42.900
arc length when we were dealing with

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.800
standard rectangular coordinates.

00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:48.100
So, let's take a little, small section of

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.966
the arc length, let's take a little small

00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:52.600
section, I'm going to blow it up.

00:00:52.833 --> 00:00:55.367
So, let's call this right over here,

00:00:55.367 --> 00:00:58.366
this is our infinitesitely, this is our

00:00:58.366 --> 00:01:02.500
infinitely smaller, infinitesimal sized,

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.000
our piece of our arc length,
I'm going to call it DS.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.135
And obviously, this is
a lot bigger than maybe

00:01:08.135 --> 00:01:09.766
you would imagine when you think of

00:01:09.766 --> 00:01:11.700
infinitesimal, but then if you integrate

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.766
together all of the DSes, if you

00:01:13.766 --> 00:01:16.367
integrate together all of the DSes, then

00:01:16.367 --> 00:01:18.500
you're going to have, you're going to have

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.866
the length of the actual
curve that you care about.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.033
So we can say that the length is going

00:01:24.033 --> 00:01:26.433
to be all of the DSes integrated, all of

00:01:26.433 --> 00:01:28.767
the infinitely, the infinite sum of all

00:01:28.767 --> 00:01:33.733
these infinitely small, all of
these infinitely small DSes.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.100
Now, to actually put this in terms we

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.033
can relate to in terms of Rs and thetas,

00:01:39.033 --> 00:01:41.300
I'm first going to relate this to Xs and

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.586
Ys and then relate the Rs and thetas to

00:01:43.586 --> 00:01:45.500
Xs and Ys, which we have seen before when

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.800
we have converted between polar
form and rectangular form.

00:01:49.166 --> 00:01:52.966
So we know that this DS is going to be

00:01:52.966 --> 00:01:57.868
equal to our infinitely
small change in X squared.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.566
So if this is our,
going from this point to

00:02:00.566 --> 00:02:02.734
that point, that's our
change in our arc length.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.766
But this distance, right over here would

00:02:04.766 --> 00:02:08.500
be our change in our X, I'll write that

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.366
as DX and I'm writing everything as

00:02:10.366 --> 00:02:11.566
differentials, which is a little bit

00:02:11.566 --> 00:02:13.900
mathematically, I guess we could say,

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.633
hand-wavy or loosey
goosey, but it gives you

00:02:15.633 --> 00:02:18.266
a good conceptual understanding
of where this comes from.

00:02:18.366 --> 00:02:19.766
You could, if we were a little bit more

00:02:19.766 --> 00:02:21.501
precise, we could take DX, we could do

00:02:21.501 --> 00:02:23.438
delta Xs and then eventually take limits

00:02:23.438 --> 00:02:24.900
and all the rest, but I'll just go with

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.366
this because it makes a little bit, at

00:02:26.366 --> 00:02:28.800
least for my brain, more conceptual sense.

00:02:29.233 --> 00:02:30.900
So that's, that's our change in X when we

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.800
go from that point to that point.

00:02:32.985 --> 00:02:36.833
Then this is our change in Y when we go

00:02:36.833 --> 00:02:39.400
from this point to this point, DY.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.433
And we've seen this before when we got

00:02:41.433 --> 00:02:43.166
our justification for the arc length

00:02:43.166 --> 00:02:44.967
formula rectangular coordinates, we

00:02:44.967 --> 00:02:47.633
could say that DS is going to be equal

00:02:47.633 --> 00:02:52.633
to the square root of DX squared, DX

00:02:53.766 --> 00:02:55.833
squared, plus DY squared and this just

00:02:55.833 --> 00:02:57.666
comes straight out of
the Pythagorean Theorum.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.233
Plus DY squared, and then if we can

00:03:01.233 --> 00:03:04.266
integrate these, then we're
kind of in the same place.

00:03:04.566 --> 00:03:09.000
But how do we get these
in terms of Rs and thetas?

00:03:09.166 --> 00:03:11.166
Well, to do that, we just have to remind

00:03:11.166 --> 00:03:13.833
ourselves what X is in terms of r and

00:03:13.833 --> 00:03:16.466
theta, what Y is in terms of r and theta.

00:03:16.566 --> 00:03:20.766
So X, we know, is going to be equal to r

00:03:20.766 --> 00:03:24.233
cosine of theta and we first saw this when

00:03:24.233 --> 00:03:26.700
we just first were going back and forth

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.666
between polar and rectangular coordinates.

00:03:28.767 --> 00:03:33.767
And Y is going to be r sine of theta.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.766
And now we can use this to say what

00:03:37.766 --> 00:03:40.066
DX and what DY are going to be.

00:03:40.367 --> 00:03:43.566
DX is then going to be equal to, and we

00:03:43.566 --> 00:03:45.900
have to remember that r is going to be a

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.233
function of theta, so actually, let me

00:03:48.233 --> 00:03:49.566
write it this way, let me just rewrite it.

00:03:49.566 --> 00:03:53.766
So X, we could also
write it as, F of theta

00:03:53.766 --> 00:03:58.766
times cosine theta and Y is equal to

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.200
F of theta times sine of theta.

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.700
So now, what's a DX? DX is going to be,

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:08.834
this is just, we're just going

00:04:08.834 --> 00:04:10.633
to apply the product rule here.

00:04:10.633 --> 00:04:12.434
It's going to be F prime of theta,

00:04:12.434 --> 00:04:14.033
derivative of the first expression times

00:04:14.033 --> 00:04:17.234
the second one, times cosine to theta plus

00:04:17.234 --> 00:04:18.566
the derivative of the second one.

00:04:18.566 --> 00:04:19.833
Well, the derivative of cosine of theta is

00:04:19.833 --> 00:04:24.200
negative sine of theta, so
we'll say minus sine theta.

00:04:25.166 --> 00:04:26.833
Minus sine theta times the first

00:04:26.833 --> 00:04:29.366
expressions, so F of theta, that was just

00:04:29.366 --> 00:04:31.333
the product rule, that's our DX.

00:04:31.816 --> 00:04:35.100
And then, of course, D theta, D theta.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.633
Another way you could have said if you

00:04:36.633 --> 00:04:37.833
treated these differentials like

00:04:37.833 --> 00:04:39.500
numbers, you could divide both sides by

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:40.766
D theta, you would have the derivative of

00:04:40.766 --> 00:04:42.633
X with respect to theta is this business

00:04:42.633 --> 00:04:45.798
right over here, so those
are equivalent statements.

00:04:45.798 --> 00:04:47.800
And also do the same thing for DY.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.433
So DY, same again, by the product rule

00:04:51.433 --> 00:04:56.433
is going to be F prime, F prime of theta

00:04:58.033 --> 00:05:03.033
times sine of theta plus F of theta times

00:05:04.566 --> 00:05:07.200
the derivative of sine of
theta, which is cosine of theta.

00:05:08.367 --> 00:05:11.566
Cosine of theta, and now if we want to

00:05:11.566 --> 00:05:12.766
figure out what DS is,
we're going to have to

00:05:12.766 --> 00:05:15.867
take the sum of DX squared and
DY squared, so let's do that.

00:05:16.233 --> 00:05:21.233
So, DX, DX squared is going to be equal

00:05:23.433 --> 00:05:24.766
to, we just need to square all of this

00:05:24.766 --> 00:05:26.433
business, so I'm just going to square

00:05:26.433 --> 00:05:28.233
this and then multiply that times D theta

00:05:28.233 --> 00:05:30.800
squared, so that's going to be equal to,

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:35.466
this is going to be F prime of theta

00:05:36.033 --> 00:05:40.100
squared, cosine squared theta, minus 2

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:44.900
times the product of
these, minus 2 times F

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:49.900
prime of theta, F of theta, cosine theta,

00:05:51.766 --> 00:05:55.900
sine theta, and then this one squared, so

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.367
negative times negative is a positive, so

00:05:57.367 --> 00:06:02.367
plus F of theta squared, sine
squared, sine squared theta.

00:06:05.166 --> 00:06:07.433
So that's DX squared, and then, of

00:06:07.433 --> 00:06:09.233
course, we have the D theta, well not done

00:06:09.233 --> 00:06:12.500
yet, then we have the D theta squared and

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.600
now let's figure out what DY squared is.

00:06:15.233 --> 00:06:20.233
So, DY squared is going to be equal to...

00:06:20.767 --> 00:06:23.033
Well, this term, squared, oh I have to

00:06:23.033 --> 00:06:26.033
forget, this DY is going to have a D theta

00:06:26.033 --> 00:06:27.866
at the end, don't want to forget that.

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.300
And so over here, this is going to be F

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:36.300
prime of theta squared, sine squared,

00:06:38.566 --> 00:06:41.033
sine squared theta, and then two times

00:06:41.033 --> 00:06:45.067
the products of these, so plus two times

00:06:45.166 --> 00:06:50.166
F prime of, let me, F prime of theta, F of

00:06:50.367 --> 00:06:51.633
theta, it's a little bit hairy, but we'll

00:06:51.633 --> 00:06:54.533
see in a few it's going
to clean up nicely.

00:06:54.556 --> 00:06:59.066
F of theta, cosine sine, cosine theta,

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.566
sine theta and then we just want to square

00:07:01.566 --> 00:07:06.566
this plus F of theta
squared cosine, cosine

00:07:09.033 --> 00:07:13.666
squared theta, and then D theta squared.

00:07:14.166 --> 00:07:17.666
D theta squared, now let's
add these two together.

00:07:18.366 --> 00:07:21.200
So let's add them together,
and what are we going to get?

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:25.833
So, if we add DX squared and DY squared,

00:07:25.833 --> 00:07:30.100
we're going to get, so DX squared plus DY

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:35.000
squared plus DY squared is equal to.

00:07:35.433 --> 00:07:38.033
So over here we have cosine squared

00:07:38.033 --> 00:07:41.833
theta times F prime of theta squared and

00:07:41.833 --> 00:07:45.533
then sine squared there times
F prime of theta squared.

00:07:45.966 --> 00:07:48.300
So we can factor out an F prime of theta

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:49.972
squared, so it's going to be equal to,

00:07:49.972 --> 00:07:52.900
so if we factor these characters out,

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:57.900
it's going to be F prime of theta squared

00:07:58.433 --> 00:08:03.433
times, times cosine squared theta, cosine

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:06.400
squared theta plus sine squared theta.

00:08:07.233 --> 00:08:10.969
Plus sine squared theta and we see that

00:08:10.969 --> 00:08:12.566
that's going to simplify nicely, that this

00:08:12.566 --> 00:08:15.766
is just going to be equal to one,

00:08:15.766 --> 00:08:18.333
that's just one basic trig identity.

00:08:18.433 --> 00:08:19.833
And then, these middle two terms

00:08:19.833 --> 00:08:21.900
actually cancel out, this is negative of

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:26.033
this, so these two
cancel out and then over

00:08:26.033 --> 00:08:29.733
here, we can factor out
an F of theta squared.

00:08:30.366 --> 00:08:33.500
So, we could factor out an F of theta

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:38.500
squared, so it becomes plus F of theta

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:43.900
squared times sine squared theta, sine

00:08:44.966 --> 00:08:47.233
squared theta plus cosine squared

00:08:47.233 --> 00:08:51.334
theta, plus cosine squared theta.

00:08:51.442 --> 00:08:53.300
Well, that simplifies nicely.

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:55.866
This is just going to be equal to one.

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:59.900
And then, we have these and then this D, D

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:03.200
theta squared is multiplied
times everything.

00:09:03.567 --> 00:09:07.033
So, so everything right over here is going

00:09:07.033 --> 00:09:11.100
to be, so times D theta, D theta squared.

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:12.566
You can almost view these as the

00:09:12.566 --> 00:09:14.100
coefficients on D theta squared and

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:15.666
we added those two coefficients.

00:09:15.966 --> 00:09:17.634
So, this is going to clean up nicely now,

00:09:17.634 --> 00:09:22.634
so this simplifies as DX squared plus DY

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:28.300
squared plus DY squared is equal to, is

00:09:29.633 --> 00:09:34.633
equal to F prime of
theta squared plus F of

00:09:37.567 --> 00:09:42.567
theta plus F of theta squared.

00:09:44.633 --> 00:09:46.858
And then all of that
times, I'm going to do

00:09:46.858 --> 00:09:48.634
this in a new color, actually.

00:09:48.634 --> 00:09:50.730
All of that times D theta squared.

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:52.500
Actually, that, I've
already used that color.

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:54.325
I'll use the magenta.

00:09:54.325 --> 00:09:59.236
All of that times D theta
squared, D theta squared.

00:10:00.151 --> 00:10:01.900
Now we know that DS is going to be the

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:03.633
square root of this, so let's write that,

00:10:03.633 --> 00:10:08.633
so DS is equal to the square root of this,

00:10:08.766 --> 00:10:11.666
which is equal to the square root of this.

00:10:12.233 --> 00:10:14.633
Which is going to be equal to, well we

00:10:14.633 --> 00:10:17.946
can factor out a, the square root of D

00:10:17.946 --> 00:10:19.248
theta squared is just going to be D

00:10:19.248 --> 00:10:20.866
theta, so we can just take that out.

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:25.566
And we are left with, we are left with F

00:10:25.566 --> 00:10:30.566
prime of theta squared. F prime of theta

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:37.500
squared plus F of theta squared,
plus F of theta squared.

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:41.566
And now we take a D theta out of the

00:10:41.566 --> 00:10:43.207
radical, if you put it
in as D theta squared,

00:10:43.207 --> 00:10:47.600
you take it out, it's going
to be D theta, D theta.

00:10:48.033 --> 00:10:49.233
So this is interesting, so if we wanted

00:10:49.233 --> 00:10:51.033
to integrate them, so if you wanted to

00:10:51.033 --> 00:10:52.833
integrate this, if you want to integrate

00:10:52.833 --> 00:10:55.300
this, if you want to integrate this, you

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:58.467
just want to integrate
this right over here.

00:10:58.766 --> 00:11:00.100
And you would integrate it from your

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:01.700
starting theta, maybe we could call that

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:04.333
alpha, to your ending theta, beta.

00:11:04.433 --> 00:11:05.766
And just like that, we have given

00:11:05.766 --> 00:11:08.366
ourselves a reasonable justification, or

00:11:08.366 --> 00:11:11.033
hopefully a conceptual understanding, for

00:11:11.033 --> 00:11:12.900
the formula for arc length when we're

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:15.200
dealing with something in polar form.

00:11:15.366 --> 00:11:19.033
If you have r is equal to F of theta,

00:11:19.033 --> 00:11:21.100
you find what F prime of theta is, or

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:22.633
you could think of it as the derivative

00:11:22.633 --> 00:11:25.033
of r with respect to theta, square that,

00:11:25.033 --> 00:11:26.966
add that to F of theta squared, take the

00:11:26.966 --> 00:11:28.766
square root and then integrate with

00:11:28.766 --> 00:11:32.600
respect to theta from alpha to beta.

00:11:32.833 --> 00:11:36.566
And so this right over
here, our arc length,

00:11:36.566 --> 00:11:41.033
is going to be equal to
this right over here.

00:11:41.033 --> 00:11:44.600
And the next few videos, we
will actually apply this.
