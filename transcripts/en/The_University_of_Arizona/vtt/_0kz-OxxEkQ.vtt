00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.451
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.180
Well, welcome to tonight's last
lecture in the cosmic origins.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.804
Thank you so much for
being here with us.

00:00:22.804 --> 00:00:25.648
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.700
After tonight's
lecture, in six lectures

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.100
you will know as much as
our cosmologist, which

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.320
means that about 5%
of what's going on.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.260
Today, I really felt like an
impresario in a nightmare.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.580
Yesterday, we got a call from
our speaker, Carolyn Porco

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.020
saying that she
had had an accident

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.160
and that she was not
going to be here.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.160
In fact, she's not here.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.920
She's OK, but she
wasn't able to travel.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.390
So then we went into panic mode.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.390
And we figured out,
well, what can we do?

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.620
And we said, well,
maybe we could

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.610
have Peter Smith come and
talk to us about water on Mars

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.370
and talk about life on Mars.

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.010
And then we said,
well, maybe we can

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.910
have Jonathan Lunine
talk about his book,

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.020
How Do You Make A
Habitable Planet?"

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.400
Or we can go on to Roy
Parker and say, well,

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.310
how do we go from chemistry
to self-replicating chemistry?

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.170
Well, the timeline is
that we have a big bench.

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.300
And we decided,
though, in the end

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.820
that perhaps we should end the
talks with our star speaker

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.130
and that's with Chris Impey.

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:49.630
And Chris is going to give us
a lecture tonight-- [APPLAUSE]

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.000
and he'll tell us that
we know 5% of what's

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.910
out there about life.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.630
Today, in particular,
I want to thank--

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.110
I hope you bear with me a
bit being the last lecture.

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.580
I want to thank
our underwriters,

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:11.390
those that make this possible,
the Arizona Daily Star, Cox

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.740
Communication, Bob Davis and
Innovation Park, Innovation

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.770
Park Place Stantic DPR,
those friends of the college,

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.720
the Galileo circle
members, Godat Design-- all

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.020
these beautiful things
are from Godat-- Raytheon.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.360
Research Corporation
is special in this

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.560
as well because
they give us money

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.340
so that we can have the
funds to pay teachers

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.390
from middle and high school to
come and take credit for these

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.480
and take back to the classes.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.190
So thank you for that.
[APPLAUSE] Unisource Energy

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.850
and Ventana Medical Systems.

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.920
And again, thank you all
for attending this as well.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.872
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.580
Speaking of the teachers,
I just want to point--

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.180
and maybe they can stand
up-- but John Pollard who

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.870
is a faculty member
in chemistry,

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:18.300
and Margaret Wilch-- where's
Margaret-- from Tucson High

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.510
are the ones that have
actually got it all together.

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.718
But those are all the teachers
that are here with us.

00:03:22.718 --> 00:03:23.970
Thank you so much.

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.470
And don't tell your students
that we don't know anything.

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:29.550
Actually, do tell them.

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.910
They have to figure it out.

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.480
We have a small lecture
series committee

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.060
that puts these things together
and tries to think them out.

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.040
And last year we
asked all of you

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.950
for your comments of what you
would like to hear from us.

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.030
And the great majority
of answer to us

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.390
were because of cosmology.

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.290
So we urge you to
let us know again

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.760
what topics you're interested in
and see if we can package them

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.140
together.

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.360
Carl Philabaum, who was
the person that actually

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.290
did that filling
of Centennial Hall,

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.540
and he's the one that also
has the funky pictures that

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:07.123
come out here.

00:04:07.123 --> 00:04:10.160
He's a friend of the college,
and we thank him for that.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.870
The Arizona Public Media
for filming these lectures.

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.529
They now have been highlighted
in YouTube, not YouTube, iTunes

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:20.450
as something worthy to look at.

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:25.570
And Stuart Glogoff, who
actually posts the podcast.

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.300
I do encourage you all to look
for these and past lectures

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.730
in the College of
Science website.

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.880
Starizona for making
a contribution

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.950
towards a telescope drawing.

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:39.660
And everybody from the College
of Science has to not drawn.

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.440
So only you folks
can actually get it.

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.350
And Centennial Hall staff
has made it possible

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:48.060
for us to do this as
well as been working.

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.430
So thanks to all.

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.738
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.090
And for those of you that
cannot get enough astronomy,

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.550
there is actually
a lecture series.

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.500
Stuart is offering it.

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.410
You have to go to the website
and see when that starts.

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.030
It starts actually
beginning March 28

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:12.980
and it runs throughout
the semester.

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:17.670
So between the telescope
in Mount Lemmon

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:20.340
and the lecture series
of Stuart Observatory

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.520
you can continue learning
about our cosmos.

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.300
And I just want to do one
special thing right now.

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:33.710
There are, amazingly
enough, young kids

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.860
from middle school and some
even from elementary school

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.430
that are coming here to listen
to these lecture series.

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.880
And I've met a few of
them here and there.

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.300
And of course, since I'm old,
I don't remember their names.

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.510
But I did remember two of them.

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:50.700
And I'd like to ask
them to come up here.

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:53.410
It's Alfredo and Alex
Diaz, come up here--

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:55.170
are you around by any chance?

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:56.700
Come up here.

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.075
I want to give
you a certificate.

00:06:04.769 --> 00:06:07.727
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.630
And the rest of you that
I didn't get to meet,

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:18.540
if you just let me
know who you are,

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:20.580
I'll give you a
certificate later on.

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:21.800
But thank you so much.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.506
And Chris--

00:06:24.506 --> 00:06:27.950
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:35.990
It's great to be
back, although not

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:39.240
under these circumstances
necessarily, but sometimes

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.920
life throws you a curve.

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:42.570
I talk to Carolyn.

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:44.760
And she's fine.

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:49.360
She has the penalty of living
in a place where there's ice.

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:54.060
I try and-- [LAUGHTER] I try
and rule ice out of my life.

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:56.260
That's why I live here.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.040
And you just have to go with
the flow in these things.

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.790
Things don't always go
exactly as you want.

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:03.290
And they change.

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:07.610
And you have to be willing to
adapt to the circumstances.

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:11.720
My caveat, as I start, is
that I'm not an astrobiologist

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.220
and I'm not a
planetary scientist.

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:16.390
I have a hobby, side
interest, in that.

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:19.730
The research I do is if
it's closer than a billion

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:20.814
light years, I don't care.

00:07:20.814 --> 00:07:23.313
So that includes everything I'm
going to talk about tonight.

00:07:23.313 --> 00:07:25.200
But I really care a
lot about everything

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:27.720
I'm going to talk about tonight.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:30.620
So I and we all, I'm
sure, wish Carolyn well.

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:31.390
She's fine.

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:33.140
But she did take a nasty fall.

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:35.250
So she's not able to be here.

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:38.260
Now since it's not my subject
matter, that's the big caveat.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.380
And I'll follow this very
well understood process

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:44.360
in the upper
echelons of academia,

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.860
where you say basically
any [NO AUDIO]

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:49.110
want and people won't know.

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:55.810
And before I start, I want
to make one public service

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:57.000
announcement.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.020
There should be no guns in here.

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:02.380
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:12.160
Now as you know,
that may not last.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:16.210
I'm just telling you that if I
come back here in a future date

00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:19.130
and you are packing heat,
I am going to pack heat.

00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:20.990
I'm going to pack
more heat than you.

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:22.630
I'm going to pack so much heat.

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:23.820
I'll scare you, OK?

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:26.330
So just let's have that clear,
because there's a lot of you,

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:27.600
OK?

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.780
Thank you.

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:34.710
So the subject matter tonight is
in Carolyn's title, "The Oldest

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:36.980
Question," the oldest and
perhaps one of the most

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:40.740
profound questions about
the universe we live in,

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:43.980
which is whether this
extraordinary experiment

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:46.530
in biology that took
place in this one little

00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:49.960
remote cubby hole, this
little corner of the universe,

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.600
starting four billion
years ago, is unique.

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:57.310
That's an extraordinarily
profound and simple question.

00:08:57.310 --> 00:08:59.710
The architect and visionary
Buckminster Fuller

00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:03.350
put it very nicely, that
dichotomy, either we are alone

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:05.070
in the universe or we're not.

00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:07.295
Either way the implications
are staggering.

00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:11.690
And they really are.

00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:14.710
And so what you see is the
end of a long progression

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:16.610
that is the Copernican
revolution, which

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:18.160
continues to this day.

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.550
And as we see,
it's a progression

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:23.010
of ignominy, where
we find ourselves

00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:25.540
to be an exceptional
in our position

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:29.710
relative to an average star
within an average galaxy in one

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:31.700
region of the universe
filled with galaxies.

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:34.520
We also find we're not
even made of the that

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:37.240
the universe is
overwhelmingly made of.

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:40.980
And perhaps the final steps
in the Copernican revolution,

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:44.680
this progression of displacement
of us in importance,

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:47.520
would be one that I
alluded to in my talk,

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:49.220
the possibility
of other universes

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:51.920
beyond our view
and the possibility

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:55.320
that there are other habited,
inhabited, not just habitable,

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:58.117
but habited planets
elsewhere in the universe.

00:09:58.117 --> 00:09:59.450
So that's a subject for tonight.

00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:02.670
And of course, you
know already this

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:06.360
is a talk with lousy tension
because you know the answer.

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:08.450
I'm not going to break
the news to you tonight.

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:10.510
We are still the
only living planet

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:12.590
we know of in the universe.

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:14.110
So I'll just leave
a little while

00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:16.700
for you to leave if you
want, because I just gave you

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:17.250
the answer.

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:18.110
That's the answer.

00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:18.610
We're it.

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:21.890
So we'll just be staring
at our navels this evening

00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:24.840
and just being very happy that
we're alive, because we don't

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:27.100
know of anywhere else that is.

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:28.680
But the game is
getting interesting.

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:30.750
And I hope I can
persuade you that not

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:34.370
just in distant future.

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:37.020
But in the proximate
future in our lifetimes,

00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:38.940
we may learn the answer
to this question,

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:41.170
an extraordinary
question to answer.

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:46.170
But first let me reiterate that
it is a subject in its infancy.

00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:48.260
And the amount we
know vastly exceeds

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:51.870
what we don't in a similar
way to the universe contents.

00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:53.900
For example, the
biosphere, the thing

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:56.750
that we should know the best,
we don't fully understand.

00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:59.780
Most of the microbial
diversity of the biosphere

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:01.880
is unexplored, untapped.

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:04.140
Those microbes are
uncultured in the lab.

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:07.030
We really don't
understand them very well.

00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:09.310
We've only poked
around the solar system

00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:11.050
with our robotic
and remote sensing

00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:13.210
probes in a few locations.

00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:16.630
We have explored or even
diagnosed in the simplest way

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:20.280
a tiny fraction of the habitable
real estate in the Milky Way

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:21.400
galaxy.

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:23.900
And the activity of
SETI, the abbreviation

00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:26.630
for the Search for
Extraterrestrial Intelligence,

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:29.800
is in its infancy, and
as they would admit,

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:31.720
have only searched
a tiny fraction

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:34.480
of all the possible
stars that could have

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:36.810
planets sending signals to us.

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:40.660
So this is a subject where we're
just starting to get going.

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:43.410
The context for life in the
universe is fairly simple,

00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:47.450
and you've heard it built up
in stages in previous talks,

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:51.644
the first part is, of course,
chemistry and also the fact

00:11:51.644 --> 00:11:53.435
that there are places
where life can exist.

00:11:56.040 --> 00:12:00.490
So we understand that as a
natural by product of star

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:02.720
formation planets will form.

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:05.660
It's an unexceptional
physical process.

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:09.310
Collapsing clouds of gas
and dust form a disk.

00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:11.336
Most of the mass
goes into the star.

00:12:11.336 --> 00:12:15.430
A small fraction is left
over and forms rocky objects

00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:18.820
that glom together by accretion.

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:21.790
Radiation from the young star
drives out the residual gas.

00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:23.710
And so you end up with
small rocky objects

00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:27.130
near the star and
larger, cooler objects,

00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:29.846
which can accrete gassy
envelopes further out.

00:12:29.846 --> 00:12:32.180
Those are the gas giants.

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:34.510
Turns out that's maybe a
little bit of a just so

00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:36.260
story to explain
our solar system,

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.010
because the planets we've
started to find elsewhere

00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:41.200
do not follow this
simple picture.

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:43.490
But certainly we expect
planets to form naturally

00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:44.650
wherever stars form.

00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:47.020
And that's what
we've been finding.

00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:49.920
We also know that the
ingredients for life

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:51.410
are widespread.

00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:54.060
So you might worry in the
business of astrobiology

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:55.640
whether the
requirement that life

00:12:55.640 --> 00:13:00.180
be made with carbon and use
water is overly restrictive.

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:01.330
And I would say, no.

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:03.500
I would say we should
open our minds to life

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:06.340
that doesn't have that basis.

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:08.390
But there's no need
to look beyond that,

00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:10.110
because as you
can see, carbon is

00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:12.380
one of the most abundant
elements in the universe.

00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:13.560
Made in stars.

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:16.290
Distributed into the
space between stars.

00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:20.220
The long journey of all the
carbon atoms in our bodies

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:22.240
probably encompasses
dozens or even

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:25.470
hundreds of generations
of stars over cosmic time,

00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:26.850
an extraordinary story.

00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:30.270
Each carbon atom has a
different story in fact.

00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:31.780
But the ingredient is there.

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:33.890
And water is one of the
most abundant molecules

00:13:33.890 --> 00:13:34.990
in the universe.

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:37.610
So even if we say that
life needs those things,

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:40.350
that is not restrictive
in a cosmic sense.

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:42.950
Also, the universe has been
getting more fit for life

00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:46.980
as cosmic time passes, because
stars have been progressively

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:48.890
been making more carbon.

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:51.940
And so the fact that we
live in an ancient universe

00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:55.520
should not surprise us because
we couldn't exist in a universe

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:57.630
100 million years
after it formed,

00:13:57.630 --> 00:13:59.440
even though there
were stars then.

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:02.450
They were pristine stars made
only of hydrogen and helium

00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:04.070
with no planets around them.

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:06.690
There was no grit
to grow the pearl.

00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:08.810
And so back in
the early universe

00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:11.720
there probably was no life.

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:13.190
So the ingredients
are widespread.

00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:16.176
And the ingredients
are put out there

00:14:16.176 --> 00:14:19.200
by cycles of star
birth and death.

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:22.410
And you've heard some about
that in previous lecture.

00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:25.850
So these heavy elements are
cooked inside stars by fusion,

00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:28.270
are ejected into
interstellar space,

00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:31.280
where they become part of
a new generation of stars.

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:34.230
And this cyclic process
of star birth and death,

00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:38.240
the creation of heavy elements
by fusion deep inside stars.

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:40.990
Of course, all of
these fusion events

00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:43.460
happened at least 4 and
1/2 billion years ago

00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:45.030
because they preceded
the formation

00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:46.690
of the Earth and the sun.

00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:48.690
So this is a life
story of stars.

00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:50.630
But it's also our life story.

00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:53.530
It's the story of our
life, of our biology.

00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:54.680
And they couldn't exist.

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:57.270
If stars were selfish and
hoarded their heavy elements

00:14:57.270 --> 00:14:59.920
in their cores and just
shrunk into stellar corpses

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:02.887
with no return of heavy elements
to the universe at large,

00:15:02.887 --> 00:15:03.970
there would be no biology.

00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:08.070
Now we have an
immediate problem,

00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:10.730
and as a non-biologist,
it's easy for me

00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:12.560
to point to it very strongly.

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:14.502
Biologists know what they study.

00:15:14.502 --> 00:15:16.460
But if we're talking
about life in the universe

00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:19.160
we're worrying about the
general case of something

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:20.570
where we know one instance.

00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:22.750
And that's a difficult
position to be in.

00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:24.904
And defining life
is just difficult.

00:15:24.904 --> 00:15:26.820
For the professional
biologist it's difficult.

00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:29.620
For astrobiologist,
perhaps even more so.

00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:32.440
Because if you ask that life
have organizing principles

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:34.995
and complex and interesting
behavior, you might imagine

00:15:34.995 --> 00:15:37.880
you know what biology
would look like sight

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:40.590
unseen in another world,
but it's not obvious

00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:42.564
what it would look like.

00:15:42.564 --> 00:15:46.043
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:16:57.611 --> 00:17:00.093
[RUMBLING SOUND]

00:17:00.593 --> 00:17:04.310
So if we saw that happening on
the surface of an alien planet,

00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:06.230
we'd probably get quite excited.

00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:07.569
But there's no biology there.

00:17:07.569 --> 00:17:09.250
There's not even chemistry.

00:17:09.250 --> 00:17:10.869
That's just physics.

00:17:10.869 --> 00:17:15.530
That's just flour, water, a
pie tray, and a bass speaker.

00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:19.440
So we're trying to broaden
the envelope of biology.

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:21.970
We don't yet know
whether, even where

00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:24.440
they're at the micro
level of the genetic code

00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:26.710
or at the macro level
of natural selection,

00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:29.420
biology operates anywhere
other than the Earth.

00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:31.830
We suppose and
hope that it might,

00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:33.620
because it will add
to our understanding

00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:35.380
when we discover
something interesting.

00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:39.130
But the truth is we have to be
open for other possibilities.

00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:41.040
And we have to play
this interesting game

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:43.680
of asking about hypotheticals,
because those hypotheticals

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:45.290
might exist in the universe.

00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:49.120
We have to ask what might be
and doesn't violate any laws

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:52.160
of physics or chemistry or
even our knowledge of biology,

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:52.740
but isn't.

00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:55.500
Things that could happen
but don't here but

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:56.800
might happen elsewhere.

00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:59.480
That's a difficult thing to do.

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:02.020
When we're starting with talking
about life in the universe,

00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:04.970
we have to be very clear
about what life on Earth is

00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:05.600
and isn't.

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:08.970
Probably to non-biologist,
the most striking thing

00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:16.090
is that everything from a fungus
to a great whale to a butterfly

00:18:16.090 --> 00:18:17.070
is all one thing.

00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:19.000
Life on Earth is one thing.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.080
And that one thing has
the same genetic code,

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:23.420
the same biochemical basis.

00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:25.590
And it's basis of course is DNA.

00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:28.480
The tree of life used to be
defined in terms of species.

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:32.380
The diversity of species dating,
of course, back before Darwin.

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:35.220
But the modern tree of life is
based on the genetic material.

00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:37.580
It's based on the
gradual divergence

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:41.760
from a hypothetical last common
ancestor, perhaps 4 billion

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:44.770
years ago on the Earth,
where time moves forward

00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:48.670
in the upward
direction, and where

00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:52.370
genetic diversity is represented
by distance along this tree.

00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:55.400
This is very different from a
tree of life based on species,

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:58.680
because humans, if we
could put humans on this,

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:03.720
we are smaller than the dot
on the eye of the animals.

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:06.910
So we are the tiniest little
twiglet on the tree of life.

00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:09.890
And most of the real estate
of biological and genetic

00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:13.270
diversity and metabolic
diversity is in microorganisms.

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:15.110
This is a microbial
world, and we

00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:18.630
our little outriggers, maybe
small, unlikely contingent

00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:19.950
outcomes of evolution.

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:20.970
We don't know.

00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:23.300
But that's the way
the world looks.

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:25.650
And so that's the context
for understanding life

00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:27.040
in the universe.

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:29.250
This is quite surprising
at some level.

00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:33.020
We share this
percentage-- or these

00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:34.820
are the number of
deviant nucleic acid,

00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:37.270
so the amount of genetic
material overlap.

00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:39.320
And you may drink
your beer and think

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:41.580
that it's just a nice beverage
and something that you

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:42.490
relax with.

00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:46.460
But it actually has kinship with
you at almost the 50% level.

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:49.430
So you are not that
different from your beer.

00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:52.720
And so it's striking that such
a small amount of difference

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:55.130
in genetic material--
it's no good

00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:57.290
playing the Guinness
Book of Records game.

00:19:57.290 --> 00:20:00.060
If you want to make us best
because we have more base pairs

00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:01.720
or more genes, it's not true.

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:04.250
So you have to look somewhere
else for why we're special.

00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:06.580
So this becomes a context
for life in the universe

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:09.930
too if what happened on
the Earth was not unusual.

00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:11.640
Now the very difficult
question of can

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:13.870
we tell the story of how
life on Earth started?

00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:16.800
That, of course, would
be a whole lecture.

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:17.810
It's not clear.

00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:20.760
We cannot connect all the
dots between the simple small

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:23.960
molecules that were abundantly
available in interstellar space

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:27.810
and on the primordial Earth to
the first cell or proto cell.

00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:28.760
We cannot.

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:31.090
But in different
lab experiments,

00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:33.250
pieces of this story
have been told,

00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:37.110
even to the level of
self-catalyzing fragments

00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:40.670
of RNA to the spontaneous
formation of vessels that

00:20:40.670 --> 00:20:43.560
have some of the properties
of very small cells

00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:46.860
and to the creation of
small concentrated chemical

00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:48.736
reactors, which is
at some level what

00:20:48.736 --> 00:20:51.340
a cell is before it gets going.

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:54.750
But none of these produce
replicating molecules that

00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:56.280
would hold the genetic code.

00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:59.710
None of these produce anything
recognizable as a modern cell.

00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:02.300
So this is a story, this
is historical science.

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:05.050
And we may never be able to
tell fully the story of how

00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:07.050
life on Earth started uniquely.

00:21:07.050 --> 00:21:10.220
And we may have
to just face that.

00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:12.570
Life on Earth is telling us
something else about what

00:21:12.570 --> 00:21:13.910
to expect in the universe.

00:21:13.910 --> 00:21:16.880
And that's by looking at the
boundaries of life on Earth.

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:18.550
So we kind of are
proud of ourselves

00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:20.120
because we can live most places.

00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:21.030
We live in Alaska.

00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:23.690
We live in the desert
here and so on.

00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:26.700
But basically, we're
ridiculously frail wusses.

00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:28.430
We're just pathetic.

00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:31.110
Life on Earth is much
more hardy than we are.

00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:33.970
And the hardiness is
all in microbial hands.

00:21:33.970 --> 00:21:36.050
So there are small
microorganisms

00:21:36.050 --> 00:21:38.410
that live-- you may
say life needs water,

00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:40.280
but life lives in
places where it

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:43.810
hasn't rained for 100 years,
the high Atacama Desert.

00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:45.650
We imagine that
life needs water.

00:21:45.650 --> 00:21:48.750
But life can actually invent
its own kind of antifreeze

00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:51.460
and so exists quite happily
below the freezing point

00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:52.710
of water.

00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:55.750
Life can exist above the
boiling point of water too.

00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:58.850
And entire ecosystems were
found near hydrothermal vents

00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:01.900
in the 1970s in total
darkness at pressures

00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:05.590
of hundreds of atmospheres,
super heated water

00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:07.870
and at some level
independent of sunlight.

00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:10.800
So saying that life needs
a star is clearly wrong,

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:13.280
because all it needs is an
energy source, in this case,

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:15.490
geothermal energy.

00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:18.570
Life can handle incredible
radiation doses.

00:22:18.570 --> 00:22:21.530
This is deinococcus
radiodurans, which could happily

00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:25.690
absorb 1,000 times the radiation
dose that would drop us dead,

00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:28.160
stone dead, in
about five seconds.

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:32.130
And it does so by keeping
stacked copies of its DNA

00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:35.700
to repair its DNA at a rate
hundreds or thousands of times

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:37.480
faster than we can.

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:39.400
So these are all
adaptations of life,

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:43.490
which is permeated almost every
conceivable ecological niche

00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:46.920
on the Earth, and maybe
some that are inconceivable.

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:49.880
Life has been found--
rich, diverse,

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:52.660
microbial cultures have
been found in mines

00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:55.030
that were closed by the EPA.

00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:58.230
They have toxic run-off,
cadmium, mercury, silver,

00:22:58.230 --> 00:23:01.120
very, very toxic
heavy elements to us.

00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:03.100
But microbes can
metabolize these.

00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:04.880
They can gain their
energy from them.

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:06.630
And they exist
quite happily, also

00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:09.040
with other extreme
conditions of high salinity

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:12.880
or acidity, super
heated water, and so on.

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:17.620
And then surprises continue, a
few years ago, a small microbe

00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:19.970
was found deep in a
mine in South Africa.

00:23:19.970 --> 00:23:22.210
It appears to be
an ecosystem of one

00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:26.080
living in the bathe radiation
glow of a totally dark mine

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:27.290
shaft.

00:23:27.290 --> 00:23:28.670
And there are some
estimates that

00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:32.390
say that 90% of the
biomass of this planet

00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:35.600
is indeed below the Earth's
surface in microbial forms,

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:37.605
perhaps like this.

00:23:37.605 --> 00:23:39.480
So that's a context for
life in the universe.

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:41.970
And not all of these are
tiny and may be a little

00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:43.480
uninteresting to us, microbes.

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:45.680
Here's an extremophile,
as they're called,

00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:46.650
which is visible.

00:23:46.650 --> 00:23:47.609
It's pretty small.

00:23:47.609 --> 00:23:50.150
It's about the size of the head
of a pin or a little smaller.

00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:53.210
It's a tardigrade, known
to children as water bear.

00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:55.730
And there are 700
different species of it.

00:23:55.730 --> 00:23:57.100
It has its own phylum.

00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:59.580
And it's quite a
complex organism.

00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:02.170
It has this amazing
trick of cryptobiosis,

00:24:02.170 --> 00:24:05.620
going into a freeze dried state
and rolling into a little ball

00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:08.310
where it can be carried on
the wind or an animal fur.

00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:11.080
And the chemistry, the
biochemistry, of this process

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:14.860
is being studied in labs as
a way of learning perhaps

00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:17.750
how we might get suspended
animation as something that we

00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:20.270
can do to ourselves.

00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:22.420
So pulling some of
these things together,

00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:24.590
what is the
expectation in advance

00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:27.650
of finding life anywhere
else-- remember,

00:24:27.650 --> 00:24:30.090
it hasn't been found--
that life will be common?

00:24:30.090 --> 00:24:33.280
We'd have to have some reason
for that level of confidence

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:35.920
without any evidence whatsoever.

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:37.560
And the reasons are here.

00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:39.866
First, that life appeared
very early in the history

00:24:39.866 --> 00:24:41.490
of the Earth, when
the earth was really

00:24:41.490 --> 00:24:44.210
a very inhospitable place
with impact [? SEAM ?]

00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:46.460
rates thousands of
times what they are now,

00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:49.440
intense vulcanism, an
unbreathable atmosphere,

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:50.350
life began.

00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:54.030
The motor of life ticked
over very, very early indeed.

00:24:54.030 --> 00:24:55.840
We know that the
basic ingredients

00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:58.560
can combine to form the
next level of ingredients,

00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:01.140
even if we can't
tell all that story.

00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:03.040
And then the
extremophiles tell us

00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:05.460
that given the
physical boundaries,

00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:07.850
the physical conditions
that bound life on Earth,

00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:10.920
it is expanded to fill almost
all of those conditions.

00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:12.740
It doesn't just go
for the happy middle

00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:15.240
or the comfortable
place, not like us.

00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:17.940
We want a nice beach
house in Hawaii.

00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:18.920
And then we're happy.

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:20.810
We don't want to go
to those hard places.

00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:23.590
Well, life goes to the
hard places and does fine.

00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:25.360
We know the ingredients
are everywhere.

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:28.220
And as I'll talk about,
there are abundant sights

00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:29.870
where life might form.

00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:30.840
So everything's there.

00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:33.780
It's like the table is set
in the universe for life.

00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:37.547
And now we want to know
if anyone's at the dinner.

00:25:37.547 --> 00:25:39.380
Let's start in the solar
system, the nearest

00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:42.080
place we can look in
some level of detail.

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:44.090
And of course, we start
with the place we've

00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:46.220
looked most closely, Mars.

00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:49.650
[MEDLEY OF SONGS FEATURING MARS
 PLAYING]

00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:07.230
The basic story of Mars
is told in this picture

00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:09.460
from the highrise camera,
which is operated out

00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:12.672
of the Lunar and Planetary
Lab, or just down the mall,

00:26:12.672 --> 00:26:14.650
by the University of Arizona.

00:26:14.650 --> 00:26:16.610
It's a dry desert,
for the most part.

00:26:16.610 --> 00:26:18.770
Water cannot exist on
the surface of Mars.

00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:20.900
If you put a cup of
water there right now,

00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:24.970
it would evaporate and boil
away in a fraction of a second.

00:26:24.970 --> 00:26:26.600
So there is no water on Mars.

00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:28.840
But Mars has done more
than tantalize us.

00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:31.120
It's told us that it
is an interesting place

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:32.320
to look harder.

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:34.820
And of course, we've done more
than do it with the orbiters.

00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:36.257
We've done it with rovers.

00:26:36.257 --> 00:26:38.840
Although for the life of me, I
don't know why they didn't just

00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:42.180
turn left a little
bit here, why they

00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:43.910
got stuck behind that boulder.

00:26:43.910 --> 00:26:44.460
I don't know.

00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:45.420
It's NASA.

00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:48.550
Don't ask, OK.

00:26:48.550 --> 00:26:52.340
But not to mock NASA at
all, we were recently

00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:55.780
celebrating both a bittersweet
celebration, six and seven

00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:58.180
years for the Mars rovers,
Spirit and Opportunity.

00:26:58.180 --> 00:27:00.660
Spirit almost certainly
is trapped forever.

00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:05.190
I was at JPL a week ago, and
they have this sad mock-up

00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:07.970
of Spirit full sized
with its wheels

00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:11.000
completely covered in sand that
it's never going to get out.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.240
So Spirit, I think,
is truly dead.

00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:14.970
Opportunity rolls on.

00:27:14.970 --> 00:27:17.290
So we can just take
a moment to celebrate

00:27:17.290 --> 00:27:21.468
Spirit and an incredible amount
that it's told us about Mars.

00:27:21.468 --> 00:27:24.462
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:24.100
Spirit and Opportunity
between them

00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:26.660
have provided abundant
geochemical evidence

00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:29.480
that water existed on
the surface of Mars.

00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:31.400
We've had some of this
evidence for decades.

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:33.440
The first orbiters
produced pictures

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:37.440
that even to the untutored are
just reminiscent of running

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:41.840
water, river deltas, shallow
basins where water once sat.

00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:44.150
But the models of Mars
suggest that Mars could not

00:28:44.150 --> 00:28:46.680
have held liquid
water for a long time,

00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:49.104
perhaps two to three
billion years ago.

00:28:49.104 --> 00:28:50.520
And that's a little
disappointing.

00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:53.320
So finding life there
would be perhaps fossilized

00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:56.200
microbial life, very difficult
to do with the rovers

00:28:56.200 --> 00:29:00.330
that we have currently there
or even the ones planned.

00:29:00.330 --> 00:29:02.170
As I said, Mars tantalizes us.

00:29:02.170 --> 00:29:05.350
This pair of pictures taken
less than four years apart

00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:07.880
show that it's not just
ancient water on Mars.

00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:09.600
Mars has water now.

00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:12.310
Episodically and in
very small locations,

00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:15.490
water erupts under the
surface, as we speak.

00:29:15.490 --> 00:29:18.721
Somewhere on Mars water is
probably erupting right now.

00:29:18.721 --> 00:29:20.345
You're seeing the
edge of an escarpment

00:29:20.345 --> 00:29:22.690

00:29:22.690 --> 00:29:26.400
And before the second picture,
in the best models of this,

00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:28.990
about 300 swimming
pools worth of water

00:29:28.990 --> 00:29:30.865
erupted from a
subsurface aquifer

00:29:30.865 --> 00:29:32.800
through to the edge
of an escarpment

00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:35.750
and then ran down
the sandy hillside,

00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:39.990
carving out this channel, and
then evaporated into space.

00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:41.950
So the best modeling
suggests that there

00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:47.060
is liquid water right now under
Mars, 10, 50, 100 meters down.

00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:48.820
We don't know how far down.

00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:51.285
And of course, where there
is water, kept liquid,

00:29:51.285 --> 00:29:55.440
in this case, by pressure from
above and radioactive heating

00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:58.670
from below, there is, of
course, the possibility of life.

00:29:58.670 --> 00:30:01.400
So while Mars is mostly
dead on its surface,

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:03.200
underground there could be life.

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:05.070
Unfortunately, the
current generation

00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:07.880
of instruments and rovers
is incapable of digging

00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:10.500
more than scratching the surface
more than a few centimeters

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:11.200
down.

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:13.033
So we're going to have
to use some ingenuity

00:30:13.033 --> 00:30:15.940
to get to these places.

00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:17.360
And in fact, there
enough missions

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:18.630
planned for Mars
that it's actually

00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:19.930
going to get pretty crowded.

00:31:42.598 --> 00:31:45.120
Planets are
interesting for life.

00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:47.230
But what we've learned
in the last few decades

00:31:47.230 --> 00:31:49.522
is that the moons of the
giant planets, not the giant

00:31:49.522 --> 00:31:51.230
planets themselves
because they're mostly

00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:52.950
hydrogen and helium.

00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:54.760
They're made of what
the sun is made of.

00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:55.935
They may have rocky cores.

00:31:55.935 --> 00:31:58.910
But those rocky cores are
probably very inhospitable.

00:31:58.910 --> 00:32:01.700
But some of the moons of the
giant planets are equal in size

00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:04.270
to the small planets of
the inner solar system.

00:32:04.270 --> 00:32:07.290
They have separate sources
of heating from tidal flexing

00:32:07.290 --> 00:32:08.950
caused by their parent planet.

00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:11.900
And so satellites or moons
have become just as exciting

00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:15.618
to look for life in the solar
system as terrestrial planets.

00:32:15.618 --> 00:32:18.600
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:32:35.010 --> 00:32:38.070
What you're looking at is the
fractured ice floe surface

00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:41.000
of Europa, one of the
Galilean moons of Jupiter.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.510
The smallest features seen
here, about 100 meters across.

00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:46.290
So this is a
torturous landscape,

00:32:46.290 --> 00:32:49.080
which sequence the imaging
indicates it is moving.

00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:50.850
It's flexing like
an ice floe would

00:32:50.850 --> 00:32:52.850
that has liquid beneath it.

00:32:52.850 --> 00:32:55.350
And the best models
for Europa suggest

00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:59.450
that it has a 500 meter
to kilometer thick ice

00:32:59.450 --> 00:33:03.120
crust on top of a tens
of kilometer deep ocean.

00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:07.040
So this is a water world, fully
covered water world under ice.

00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:08.570
And although it's
extremely cold,

00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:11.370
there is a tepid heating
source from the moon itself,

00:33:11.370 --> 00:33:12.840
from geological heating.

00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:15.420
And so this is a
cryogenic biosphere issue.

00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:18.770
There are many places we're
finding in the universe

00:33:18.770 --> 00:33:20.540
where it's pretty cold.

00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:23.700
But it's not so cold that we
couldn't imagine low levels

00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:26.920
of biological activity.

00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:28.610
In fact, there are
missions planned

00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:32.570
to go under, to go under
by landing on the ice pack,

00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:35.000
using heating from a
nuclear power plant

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.970
to melt through and release
a hydro bot to look for life.

00:33:37.970 --> 00:33:40.030
This mission is
currently unfunded.

00:33:40.030 --> 00:33:43.200
But NASA's had the
design for a decade.

00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:45.410
Another fascinating
place to go--

00:33:45.410 --> 00:33:49.260
we've got a taste of
in 2005-- is Titan.

00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:50.990
And you look at the
surface of Titan,

00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:53.340
and it is terrestrial
in appearance.

00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:57.729
There are not just dry or
arid river deltas as on Mars,

00:33:57.729 --> 00:33:59.520
there are river deltas
with liquid in them.

00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:00.680
There are shallow seas.

00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:01.790
There are clouds.

00:34:01.790 --> 00:34:03.120
There's cryovolcanism.

00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:04.690
It's an active moon.

00:34:04.690 --> 00:34:06.650
It's a moon with an
atmosphere thicker

00:34:06.650 --> 00:34:08.580
than the air your
breathing, made of mostly

00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:11.480
the same stuff, nitrogen.

00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:13.139
Here's what the
lakes of Titan look

00:34:13.139 --> 00:34:15.006
like from the radar imaging.

00:34:15.006 --> 00:34:17.982
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:21.940
Titan is the only planetary
body besides Earth

00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:23.639
that we know has lakes.

00:34:23.639 --> 00:34:26.360
At 290 degrees
Fahrenheit below zero,

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:28.980
the only liquid that makes
sense there is a combination

00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:31.360
of methane and ethane.

00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:34.650
This lake is Ontario Lacus on
Titan's southern hemisphere.

00:34:34.650 --> 00:34:36.743
It's a little smaller
than Lake Michigan.

00:34:36.743 --> 00:34:38.409
We've colored the
lake black, because we

00:34:38.409 --> 00:34:40.992
think that's probably its real
color, although we don't really

00:34:40.992 --> 00:34:42.090
know for sure.

00:34:42.090 --> 00:34:44.420
We've exaggerated the heights
of the shoreline features

00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:46.150
to make them easier to see.

00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:48.960
Notice these hills,
probably made of water ice.

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:51.870
See how the liquid has
flooded up the valleys.

00:34:51.870 --> 00:34:53.790
Further north is a
long smoother beach

00:34:53.790 --> 00:34:55.610
that looks like it's
been shaped by waves.

00:34:55.610 --> 00:34:57.210
You can see some
lines along the beach

00:34:57.210 --> 00:34:59.910
that might be old shorelines,
like bathtub rings.

00:34:59.910 --> 00:35:03.460
So we know the level of
the lake has changed.

00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:06.110
Now we're turning east to
a very obvious bay that

00:35:06.110 --> 00:35:07.100
cuts into the beach.

00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:10.620
So it's likely to be younger.

00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:12.090
We'll cross over the lake.

00:35:12.090 --> 00:35:13.900
You'll see some flooded valleys.

00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:17.080
And in the background is a
large river that makes a delta,

00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:18.590
like the Mississippi River.

00:35:18.590 --> 00:35:22.624
It's shape means the lake is
shallow and the river is slow.

00:35:22.624 --> 00:35:25.969
Ontario's shore is surprisingly
like Earthly lake shores,

00:35:25.969 --> 00:35:27.760
pretty amazing to find
something this Earth

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:31.140
like 800 million miles.

00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:33.290
[END PLAYBACK]

00:35:33.290 --> 00:35:35.780
Another place we'd
love to go back to,

00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:39.010
NASA has a mission planned
for this too, also unfunded

00:35:39.010 --> 00:35:40.880
and at least a decade away.

00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:43.465
Planetary scientists, my
colleagues over at LPL

00:35:43.465 --> 00:35:45.910
are somewhat frustrated
by the long timelines

00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:47.320
of doing these missions.

00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:48.740
But you are going
a good fraction

00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:51.350
of a billion miles, high
degree of difficulty,

00:35:51.350 --> 00:35:54.090
expensive, always
a risk of failure.

00:35:54.090 --> 00:35:56.280
But some people think,
although we don't know,

00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:58.970
that ethane, methane, plus
some water in ammonia,

00:35:58.970 --> 00:36:02.160
especially below the
surface, is a plausible basis

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:06.100
for a very strange and
unusual kind of biochemistry.

00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:08.770
If there was life 2.0,
this might be the place

00:36:08.770 --> 00:36:11.300
we find it in the solar system.

00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:13.280
And then we've been
surprised by the fact

00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:16.310
that there's water in
places we never anticipated.

00:36:16.310 --> 00:36:19.060
Tiny little Enceladus,
500 kilometers across,

00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:21.850
no bigger than Rhode
Island, a far too small moon

00:36:21.850 --> 00:36:24.260
to be interesting to most
planetary scientists,

00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:27.760
turns out to have geysers that
are sprouting to the surface

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:30.400
and then ejecting ice particles
into space, where they've

00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:32.300
been sampled from
Cassini and shown

00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:35.390
to contain salt and other
interesting chemicals.

00:36:35.390 --> 00:36:38.660
And if you do a full census
of all of the small bodies

00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:41.020
in the outer solar system
that might have the three

00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:45.120
ingredients for life, the bare
minimum, organic material,

00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:47.460
liquid water, and
available energy,

00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:48.910
the number is about a dozen.

00:36:48.910 --> 00:36:52.420
Most of them are unexceptional
moons of the giant planets.

00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:55.040
And the liquid water, of
course, is under the surface

00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:56.630
in these cases.

00:36:56.630 --> 00:36:58.380
But that's a pretty
interesting inventory.

00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:01.220
So it's certainly not just
Mars that's a potential place

00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:03.550
for microbial life
in the solar system.

00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:05.800
But in the last 15
years, we've started

00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:07.440
to discover planets elsewhere.

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:09.840
So rather than just
looking in our backyard,

00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:12.190
we have a whole vast
amount of new real estate

00:37:12.190 --> 00:37:13.800
to inspect for life.

00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:15.140
Now this is very early days.

00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:18.080
We only started to find planets
beyond the solar system,

00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:19.490
as I said, 15 years ago.

00:37:19.490 --> 00:37:21.000
And they came in a dribble.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.540
Now they're becoming a flood.

00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:25.680
And they're starting to get
what I would call interesting

00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:26.983
in their nature.

00:37:26.983 --> 00:37:30.434
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:37:57.550 --> 00:37:59.760
These planets, when we
started to find them,

00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:01.810
surprised us, because
they were usually

00:38:01.810 --> 00:38:05.740
large massive, more massive than
Jupiter, ON incredibly tight

00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:07.680
orbits of their parent stars.

00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:09.650
So we started to look
around Sun-like stars,

00:38:09.650 --> 00:38:12.420
hoping to find proxies
for the solar system.

00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:15.120
And what we found was
really quite different.

00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:16.500
Here's an example.

00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:19.810
This is a system, actually
the first solar system found,

00:38:19.810 --> 00:38:22.330
a system of four
gas giant planets,

00:38:22.330 --> 00:38:24.110
and a little
visualization of where

00:38:24.110 --> 00:38:27.220
it exists in the
constellation of cancer,

00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:29.710
looking out in that direction
to the 55th brightest

00:38:29.710 --> 00:38:32.330
star in the constellation.

00:38:32.330 --> 00:38:36.140
If you visualize
leaving our solar system

00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:37.870
and then doing a
little warp speed

00:38:37.870 --> 00:38:42.480
thing about 40 light years, you
end up in another star system.

00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:46.110
And there four planets
sit, going around

00:38:46.110 --> 00:38:47.700
their sun-like star.

00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:52.840
They're all between the
masses of Neptune and Saturn.

00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:55.695
The record holder now is a
system with seven planets.

00:38:55.695 --> 00:38:58.510
And given that Pluto
has been demoted,

00:38:58.510 --> 00:39:00.780
that's almost as many
planets as our solar system.

00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:02.990
So this is becoming
very mature science.

00:39:02.990 --> 00:39:05.780
We're finding systems
of planets, mostly still

00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:07.510
large planets.

00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:09.540
This is the story so far.

00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:13.710
530, I looked it up last
night, 531 exoplanets.

00:39:13.710 --> 00:39:15.810
In 1995, none.

00:39:15.810 --> 00:39:17.880
All in the last 15 years.

00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:19.360
And you can see several things.

00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:21.350
First, you can see that
most of these planets

00:39:21.350 --> 00:39:22.200
are still massive.

00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:24.860
They're still Jupiter-like
or even more massive.

00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:27.470
But the detection
limit, the threshold

00:39:27.470 --> 00:39:29.120
of the smallest
thing we can detect

00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:32.630
has marched steadily downward
and is reaching Earth mass,

00:39:32.630 --> 00:39:33.990
just last year essentially.

00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:36.150
The game is just getting
really interesting.

00:39:36.150 --> 00:39:39.440
The record holder,
Gliese 581e, is just

00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:41.360
under twice the
mass of the Earth.

00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:44.500
So we're starting to go from
gas giants, which we would never

00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:47.880
expect to be habitable, although
their moons might be-- we just

00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:50.340
don't have a way of
finding their moons-- down

00:39:50.340 --> 00:39:53.350
towards terrestrial planets,
things that are Earth-like.

00:39:53.350 --> 00:39:56.430
And I'll come back to
that space in a minute.

00:39:56.430 --> 00:39:58.380
The method has been
indirect detection.

00:39:58.380 --> 00:40:02.860
A planet around a nearby star
reflects about 100 millionth

00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:05.530
of the light, if it's an earth,
a billionth of the light.

00:40:05.530 --> 00:40:07.240
And it sits so
close to the star,

00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:10.200
it's like trying to see a
firefly next to the floodlights

00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:11.900
of Arizona Stadium.

00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:14.330
So the method that was used
was an indirect method,

00:40:14.330 --> 00:40:16.810
where we look for the
wobble induced on a star

00:40:16.810 --> 00:40:18.980
by the orbiting massive planet.

00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:21.740
In the case where that happens
in the equatorial plane,

00:40:21.740 --> 00:40:24.020
we get an extra way
of detecting it.

00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:27.040
We get the Doppler shift
from the wobble of the star.

00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:29.800
And we also get a
periodic eclipse,

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:32.090
where the light from
the star dims according

00:40:32.090 --> 00:40:34.180
to the size of the planet.

00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:35.410
And that works like this.

00:40:35.410 --> 00:40:38.280
For Jupiter crossing
a sun-like star,

00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:41.510
the brightness will dip
for about five hours,

00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:45.420
in fact, once every
12 years by about 1%.

00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:47.010
That's easy to detect.

00:40:47.010 --> 00:40:50.070
Earth will make a signal
100 times smaller, so

00:40:50.070 --> 00:40:51.320
a hundredth of a percent.

00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:53.190
And that sounds hard,
but that can be done.

00:40:53.190 --> 00:40:55.510
And that's what the Kepler
satellite was designed for.

00:40:55.510 --> 00:40:57.550
And I'll show you the
results from that.

00:40:57.550 --> 00:40:59.930
So this has become a
very powerful technique

00:40:59.930 --> 00:41:02.597
for not only measuring planets
and finding their mass,

00:41:02.597 --> 00:41:04.680
but also the size of the
planet, because the depth

00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:07.490
of the eclipse tells you
the size of the planet.

00:41:07.490 --> 00:41:10.720
And size plus a mass
gives you a density.

00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:13.209
So you learn something extra.

00:41:13.209 --> 00:41:14.750
And what we've
learned is that nature

00:41:14.750 --> 00:41:16.960
makes an extraordinary
variety of planets.

00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:19.860
Almost everything that
theorists could hypothesize

00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:21.430
has been found at this point.

00:41:21.430 --> 00:41:24.000
We've not really found
pure water planets.

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:27.050
But we've found planets
that are probably 50% or 60%

00:41:27.050 --> 00:41:29.040
water ice and the rest rocks.

00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:32.310
We found planets that
are 80% or 85% metal,

00:41:32.310 --> 00:41:33.860
mixed in with little rock.

00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:37.010
So extraordinary composition
variations of planets.

00:41:37.010 --> 00:41:39.120
And indeed many are
just like the sun

00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:41.400
and are mostly
hydrogen and helium.

00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:43.440
So it's a kind of a
wild world out there.

00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:45.510
And the level of
information is not always

00:41:45.510 --> 00:41:47.200
what we might want
to discriminate

00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:49.510
between these possibilities.

00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:51.330
The goal, of course,
is to detect earths.

00:41:51.330 --> 00:41:52.770
That's when it gets interesting.

00:41:52.770 --> 00:41:55.280
So let me give you the
state of that game.

00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:57.170
Here's what simulations tell us.

00:41:57.170 --> 00:41:59.250
This is a simulation
where things

00:41:59.250 --> 00:42:00.740
that are hundredth
the Earth mass,

00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:03.310
planetesimals, are
gradually glomming together

00:42:03.310 --> 00:42:05.690
by gravity, just by simple
accretion of running

00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:07.890
into each other and
sticking by gravity,

00:42:07.890 --> 00:42:10.930
into a small number
of large things.

00:42:10.930 --> 00:42:14.560
And so this is a simulation,
a full gravity simulation.

00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:17.770
And you can see how quickly,
starting from small chunks,

00:42:17.770 --> 00:42:20.350
you build up the
Earth-like planets.

00:42:20.350 --> 00:42:22.510
This is a simulation,
of course, and it's not

00:42:22.510 --> 00:42:25.450
expected that you generate
the inner solar system.

00:42:25.450 --> 00:42:28.360
But you can run this simulation
hundreds or thousands of times

00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:30.600
and see the diversity
of terrestrial planets.

00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:33.850
And what you find when you
run all these simulations is

00:42:33.850 --> 00:42:35.570
pretty much what you see here.

00:42:35.570 --> 00:42:38.100
That in general you
get between 2 and 5

00:42:38.100 --> 00:42:39.980
rocky terrestrial planets.

00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:43.780
And typically 10% to 20% of
them are in the habitable zones

00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:45.370
of their stars.

00:42:45.370 --> 00:42:47.990
So simulation, pure
theory, is telling

00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:52.270
you should expect essentially
all sun-like stars to have

00:42:52.270 --> 00:42:55.590
a couple of rocky
planets and 10% roughly

00:42:55.590 --> 00:42:57.350
of them to be in
the habitable zone

00:42:57.350 --> 00:42:59.700
and therefore potentially
have liquid water.

00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:00.890
So a very exciting number.

00:43:00.890 --> 00:43:01.800
But that's theory.

00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:03.450
What does the data say?

00:43:03.450 --> 00:43:06.230
Here's the data from just
a month ago from the Kepler

00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:08.700
satellite finally releasing
Earth-like planets

00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:10.010
for the first time.

00:43:10.010 --> 00:43:12.500
So you saw the 15-year
history of this object

00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:14.260
until a month ago.

00:43:14.260 --> 00:43:16.890
Here's the data that NASA
released in a press conference

00:43:16.890 --> 00:43:18.400
quite recently.

00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:20.620
Kepler is looking for
these small eclipses.

00:43:20.620 --> 00:43:22.980
And because it can detect
a very subtle eclipse,

00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:23.970
it can find earths.

00:43:23.970 --> 00:43:25.940
And the proof is right here.

00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:29.110
But Kepler has only been
working for a few months.

00:43:29.110 --> 00:43:32.300
And so these Earth-like
planets are, of course,

00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:35.850
in orbital periods of a
month, maybe two months.

00:43:35.850 --> 00:43:38.490
So they're going around their
stars faster than mercury.

00:43:38.490 --> 00:43:40.660
And so they're
hotter than Mercury.

00:43:40.660 --> 00:43:41.950
So we have to be patient.

00:43:41.950 --> 00:43:44.860
We have to wait until Kepler
has worked for a couple of years

00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:47.650
before it can find an Earth
in an Earth-like orbit.

00:43:47.650 --> 00:43:50.310
But this tells you that
they're there to be found.

00:43:50.310 --> 00:43:53.980
We just have to be patient for
the satellite to bring them in.

00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:56.260
And the other exciting
thing from these results

00:43:56.260 --> 00:43:58.930
is that the number of
planets increases rapidly

00:43:58.930 --> 00:44:00.600
towards the detection limit.

00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:03.200
So for every Jupiter
or Saturn-like planet,

00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:06.270
you actually expect
many Earth-like planets.

00:44:06.270 --> 00:44:08.330
Rocky, terrestrial
planets are abundant.

00:44:08.330 --> 00:44:10.790
They're not rare at all.

00:44:10.790 --> 00:44:12.800
Going back to simulations,
the simulations

00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:15.280
allow us to follow the
water in a simulation.

00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:18.600
So we can see where these rocky
planets what water content they

00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:19.450
have.

00:44:19.450 --> 00:44:21.810
And you might think the
Earth is a water planet.

00:44:21.810 --> 00:44:23.150
We think the Earth is special.

00:44:23.150 --> 00:44:24.900
We talk about it
as the water world

00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:26.880
and think that it's
special for that reason.

00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:29.990
And certainly Mars is
dry and Venus baked dry.

00:44:29.990 --> 00:44:32.760
But these simulations
tell us that, in general,

00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:35.490
terrestrial planets will
have as much as the inventory

00:44:35.490 --> 00:44:37.820
of the Earth's oceans,
maybe even 10 times as much,

00:44:37.820 --> 00:44:39.730
maybe 100 times as much.

00:44:39.730 --> 00:44:42.320
Remember, water is not
of rare ingredient.

00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:43.910
So we have everything we need.

00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:46.050
We have abundant,
rocky planets beginning

00:44:46.050 --> 00:44:47.630
to be found by Kepler.

00:44:47.630 --> 00:44:50.840
We have some fraction of
them, a significant fraction,

00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:54.290
in a habitable zone where liquid
water can be on the surface.

00:44:54.290 --> 00:44:56.990
And models tell us that that
liquid water will be there.

00:44:56.990 --> 00:44:59.420
It will be part of the
composition of the planet.

00:44:59.420 --> 00:45:00.490
It's very exciting.

00:45:00.490 --> 00:45:04.386
It's just a matter of time
before we pull in an Earth.

00:45:04.386 --> 00:45:05.760
What's the next
step of the game?

00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:07.426
The next step of the
game is, of course,

00:45:07.426 --> 00:45:09.100
to look for signs for life.

00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:11.590
These planets are dozens
of light years away.

00:45:11.590 --> 00:45:15.160
They're impossibly faint to
observe with our telescopes.

00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:20.120
The best we can do is take that
feeble light a billion times

00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:24.170
fainter than the star it orbits
and spread it into a spectrum

00:45:24.170 --> 00:45:26.600
and try and look for what
are called biomarkers.

00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:29.090
That is the signatures
and spectroscopy

00:45:29.090 --> 00:45:32.120
of elements we think are
connected with biology.

00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:35.340
So you can see from the
comparison with Mars and Venus,

00:45:35.340 --> 00:45:37.900
where the major imprint in
their atmosphere in the infrared

00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:40.490
is carbon dioxide
from the atmosphere.

00:45:40.490 --> 00:45:42.230
Earth has that imprint too.

00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:44.860
But it has the extra
signature of ozone.

00:45:44.860 --> 00:45:47.562
It's a stronger
signal than water

00:45:47.562 --> 00:45:48.770
it turns out in the infrared.

00:45:48.770 --> 00:45:50.380
That's what you look for.

00:45:50.380 --> 00:45:52.190
And, of course, it has water.

00:45:52.190 --> 00:45:53.890
And ozone is a biomarker.

00:45:53.890 --> 00:45:55.290
Oxygen is a biomarker.

00:45:55.290 --> 00:45:58.540
Methane, much of which is
produced by biology on Earth

00:45:58.540 --> 00:46:01.620
in our atmosphere at a
trace level, is a biomarker.

00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:03.740
This is the next
stage of the game,

00:46:03.740 --> 00:46:07.050
to take the best of those
Earths and use our very biggest

00:46:07.050 --> 00:46:09.030
telescopes on the
ground and in space--

00:46:09.030 --> 00:46:11.320
this is very light
hungry, this kind of work.

00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:14.030
It's why we're building
the GMT down in Chile.

00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:17.100
It's why we built the
LBT interferometer here

00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:19.360
on Mount Graham is to
do this kind of work.

00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:21.520
It's why the James
Webb Space Telescope

00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:24.339
is being planned to succeed
the Hubble Space Telescope.

00:46:24.339 --> 00:46:25.880
All of these big
facilities are going

00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:28.000
to do this kind of science.

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:29.590
And that's going to
be the next step.

00:46:29.590 --> 00:46:32.410
And that may be indeed in
the next five to 10 years

00:46:32.410 --> 00:46:36.030
how we learn that we think
we found a terrestrial planet

00:46:36.030 --> 00:46:38.200
with the signature of biology.

00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:40.720
Remember, on the Earth, if
life disappeared overnight,

00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:43.450
if biosphere went
dead overnight,

00:46:43.450 --> 00:46:46.450
the 20% of the air you're
breathing that's oxygen

00:46:46.450 --> 00:46:48.665
would disappear in a
million years, which

00:46:48.665 --> 00:46:52.330
is geologically a blink of an
eye, because oxygen, of course,

00:46:52.330 --> 00:46:53.590
is very reactive.

00:46:53.590 --> 00:46:56.350
It will just rust everything
and go into seawater and so on.

00:46:56.350 --> 00:47:00.440
And so oxygen is only maintained
on a planetary time scale

00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:02.450
by biology, in our experience.

00:47:02.450 --> 00:47:05.670
And that's why we think
it's a good biomarker.

00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:08.010
Just to put a little
sobering thought on this.

00:47:08.010 --> 00:47:10.080
We might think, oh, great
we'll have an Earth.

00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:13.470
That will be a place where
can go in case things

00:47:13.470 --> 00:47:14.510
go south here.

00:47:14.510 --> 00:47:16.220
No, I don't think so.

00:47:16.220 --> 00:47:19.199
Well, Earth 2.0 is not going
to be exactly like Earth.

00:47:19.199 --> 00:47:20.990
When we talk about
Earth clones, of course,

00:47:20.990 --> 00:47:25.170
we're talking about
similar, not identical.

00:47:25.170 --> 00:47:27.140
And I don't think
any of it relieves us

00:47:27.140 --> 00:47:28.840
of the need to take
care of our planet,

00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:32.780
because these nearest Earth-like
planets are likely from Kepler

00:47:32.780 --> 00:47:35.870
to be actually dozens of light,
maybe even hundreds or 200

00:47:35.870 --> 00:47:36.950
light years away.

00:47:36.950 --> 00:47:39.390
There is no way we
are ever going there

00:47:39.390 --> 00:47:41.070
in any conceivable time scale.

00:47:41.070 --> 00:47:43.410
They're beyond our
reach for travel,

00:47:43.410 --> 00:47:48.420
for colonization, for voyaging,
even for joyrides in the future

00:47:48.420 --> 00:47:49.950
that any of us can see.

00:47:49.950 --> 00:47:52.840
So we've got to look
after this planet.

00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:55.390
So that's the state of
the game for microbes.

00:47:55.390 --> 00:47:57.635
That's where we think
we'll look for--

00:47:57.635 --> 00:48:00.750
[SNORING]

00:48:00.750 --> 00:48:02.690
Oh, OK, microbes, who cares?

00:48:02.690 --> 00:48:05.430
Now come on, it's pond scum.

00:48:05.430 --> 00:48:07.720
It's the stuff you scrape
off your shower curtain.

00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:09.030
It's yeast.

00:48:09.030 --> 00:48:10.600
Please.

00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:12.105
Why am I boring you with this?

00:48:12.105 --> 00:48:14.230
This is not what life in
the universe is about.

00:48:14.230 --> 00:48:16.350
Life in the universe
is about companionship.

00:48:16.350 --> 00:48:17.450
It's about, are we alone?

00:48:17.450 --> 00:48:18.390
Let's get real here.

00:48:18.390 --> 00:48:20.250
OK, now I'm going to get real.

00:48:20.250 --> 00:48:22.410
Where are the aliens?

00:48:22.410 --> 00:48:24.590
OK, let's get to the real thing.

00:48:24.590 --> 00:48:27.190
I've done that crappy
boring science stuff.

00:48:27.190 --> 00:48:29.110
You know, OK, this is
how we find microbes.

00:48:29.110 --> 00:48:30.980
But we really are
going to do it.

00:48:30.980 --> 00:48:32.929
Now let's go up the chain a bit.

00:48:32.929 --> 00:48:35.220
But I'm still going to stay
with microbes a little bit,

00:48:35.220 --> 00:48:37.010
because microbes should
get dissed a lot.

00:48:37.010 --> 00:48:39.760
You know, microbes are kind
of interesting, even for me

00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:41.700
as a kind of physical scientist.

00:48:41.700 --> 00:48:44.970
So we tend to underestimate--
we think we're very smart

00:48:44.970 --> 00:48:46.720
and we have technology
and all that stuff.

00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:49.390
But if we're starting to
look for intelligent life

00:48:49.390 --> 00:48:50.890
in the universe,
high functioning,

00:48:50.890 --> 00:48:53.817
technological life,
life with brains,

00:48:53.817 --> 00:48:55.400
we've got to get our
reference points.

00:48:55.400 --> 00:48:58.270
And once again, the Earth
is our reference point.

00:48:58.270 --> 00:49:00.300
And I'll just make
the obvious comment

00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:03.470
that microbes have figured
out some pretty clever things,

00:49:03.470 --> 00:49:05.310
like they figured out
how to make nanowires

00:49:05.310 --> 00:49:06.770
before we ever did in a lab.

00:49:06.770 --> 00:49:08.100
They can sense magnetic fields.

00:49:08.100 --> 00:49:11.690
They can operate commensally
and in cooperation.

00:49:11.690 --> 00:49:14.435
They can exchange signals
with reasonable bit

00:49:14.435 --> 00:49:17.600
rates, some forms of
chemical communication.

00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:19.130
That's pretty clever.

00:49:19.130 --> 00:49:21.200
If you go up the
chain a bit to things

00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:24.390
that are beneath your
contempt, for the most part,

00:49:24.390 --> 00:49:27.019
you might notice that
termites build mounds

00:49:27.019 --> 00:49:28.560
that scale to
[? SEAM ?] the organism

00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:30.960
are bigger than our
tallest skyscrapers.

00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:33.630
And they have five different
temperature control mechanisms

00:49:33.630 --> 00:49:36.490
built into the composites
of natural substances

00:49:36.490 --> 00:49:39.550
that they put together
to make these things.

00:49:39.550 --> 00:49:40.880
That's pretty cool.

00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:42.960
And social insects,
obviously, you

00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:45.166
can just say they're all
hardwired by evolution

00:49:45.166 --> 00:49:47.040
and they don't have any
choice in the matter.

00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:49.080
But viewed from afar,
again, if you're

00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:51.170
trying to distinguish
intelligence

00:49:51.170 --> 00:49:54.490
and non-intelligence,
it's not an easy call,

00:49:54.490 --> 00:49:58.120
because they do have
stratification of communication

00:49:58.120 --> 00:49:59.840
and highly organized
functioning that

00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:03.270
is adaptive to their
situation, their environment.

00:50:03.270 --> 00:50:07.240
And I think the point is
not whether ants or termites

00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:08.860
or social insects are smart.

00:50:08.860 --> 00:50:11.190
The question is that evolution
does not stand still.

00:50:11.190 --> 00:50:14.670
We view the natural
world and the organisms

00:50:14.670 --> 00:50:16.880
we share the planet with
at a snapshot of time,

00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:18.640
where we happen to
be king of the hill

00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:20.264
and we are able to
look down on them

00:50:20.264 --> 00:50:22.930
and say, well, yeah that's fine,
but you don't have cell phones.

00:50:22.930 --> 00:50:24.810
Come on, please.

00:50:24.810 --> 00:50:27.020
Please come back when you
have wireless internet

00:50:27.020 --> 00:50:28.270
and then we'll talk.

00:50:28.270 --> 00:50:30.830
You are not
sophisticated, please.

00:50:30.830 --> 00:50:32.830
So that's what we think about.

00:50:32.830 --> 00:50:35.810
But the truth is evolution
doesn't stand still.

00:50:35.810 --> 00:50:37.800
If we screw up
this planet, which

00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:39.790
we're sort of doing
in the margins

00:50:39.790 --> 00:50:42.690
and we're not here in a
million years, fair bet,

00:50:42.690 --> 00:50:45.610
I want to see what insects
have done in 100 million years.

00:50:45.610 --> 00:50:48.480
Remember, there's many, many
millions of species of them.

00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:50.760
There's more of them
than there are of us.

00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:54.810
And they're doing their thing
quite happily and quite nicely.

00:50:54.810 --> 00:50:56.600
And, of course, you
talk about technology.

00:50:56.600 --> 00:50:58.650
Let me just diminish that
envelope a little bit.

00:50:58.650 --> 00:51:00.191
Technology, yeah,
we have technology.

00:51:00.191 --> 00:51:03.100
And sure we have the
technology I just alluded to.

00:51:03.100 --> 00:51:05.730
But if you're talking about
technology as life's solution

00:51:05.730 --> 00:51:07.840
to problems, then that's
pretty impressive.

00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:10.860
You make a list of things that
animals and sometimes very

00:51:10.860 --> 00:51:14.070
small animals, 100 million years
ago, invented before we did,

00:51:14.070 --> 00:51:16.910
it includes flight,
sonar, magnetic sensing,

00:51:16.910 --> 00:51:18.996
infrared sensing, batteries,
polarization sense,

00:51:18.996 --> 00:51:21.240
fiber optics, holography.

00:51:21.240 --> 00:51:22.676
I could make an
even longer list.

00:51:22.676 --> 00:51:24.300
And you might say,
well, yeah, but they

00:51:24.300 --> 00:51:27.270
weren't doing it in
labs and with inventions

00:51:27.270 --> 00:51:30.230
and wearing white
coats and stuff.

00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:31.380
But that's OK.

00:51:31.380 --> 00:51:33.860
They just did it.

00:51:33.860 --> 00:51:35.786
And then you work
up the chain a bit

00:51:35.786 --> 00:51:37.660
and you get maybe the
things that we actually

00:51:37.660 --> 00:51:39.340
consider as pets.

00:51:39.340 --> 00:51:41.480
You know, so they're
creatures that can talk.

00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:43.800
Creatures that have behaviors
that look interesting.

00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:46.710
Alex the parrot, connection
to the U of A there,

00:51:46.710 --> 00:51:49.860
talkative and playful able to
understand the concept of zero,

00:51:49.860 --> 00:51:54.690
which not all humans can do.

00:51:54.690 --> 00:51:58.340
Rats, ticklish and curious,
personality traits.

00:51:58.340 --> 00:52:01.200
Rats can anticipate sex and
some very beautiful experiments

00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:04.220
a decade ago show that they can
reflect on their own thinking.

00:52:04.220 --> 00:52:06.330
Metacognition is
quite a high skill.

00:52:06.330 --> 00:52:10.310
So maybe we shouldn't
rodents completely.

00:52:10.310 --> 00:52:11.845
But you've probably seen this.

00:52:11.845 --> 00:52:14.570
This is a crow, never been
in this situation before,

00:52:14.570 --> 00:52:16.320
Caledonian crow called Betty.

00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:17.140
They like meat.

00:52:17.140 --> 00:52:18.870
And there's meat in a basket.

00:52:18.870 --> 00:52:19.960
She has a wire.

00:52:19.960 --> 00:52:21.740
But it's a straight wire.

00:52:21.740 --> 00:52:23.620
There happens to be a
notch cut in the base

00:52:23.620 --> 00:52:25.750
of the thing holding the tube.

00:52:25.750 --> 00:52:29.734
Again, never been in this
situation, first time.

00:52:29.734 --> 00:52:33.750
They use stick in the
wild, but not wire.

00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:35.630
She figures she can
turn that into a lever.

00:52:40.710 --> 00:52:45.820
That's a real time experiment
and quite impressive.

00:52:45.820 --> 00:52:49.310
So that maybe the adjective
birdbrain is a perjorative.

00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:56.360
And then we have creatures
that separated us

00:52:56.360 --> 00:52:58.440
from the tree of life
in the tree of life

00:52:58.440 --> 00:53:00.760
hundreds of millions
of years ago

00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:02.740
and that have
extraordinary capabilities.

00:53:02.740 --> 00:53:06.450
Cephalopods are shape
shifting creatures

00:53:06.450 --> 00:53:08.250
with distributed
brains, where there's

00:53:08.250 --> 00:53:11.080
a central brain and a
brain located on each arm.

00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:14.940
If the arm is
severed, the arm will

00:53:14.940 --> 00:53:20.670
continue to move and camouflage
to distract the predator.

00:53:20.670 --> 00:53:22.550
We just don't know how
smart these creatures.

00:53:22.550 --> 00:53:25.840
I've talked to divers who have
been led on wild goose chases

00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:28.810
through the complex three
dimensional topology of a coral

00:53:28.810 --> 00:53:31.440
reef basically
getting the diver lost

00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:33.800
and then coming and
retrieving the diver again.

00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:35.550
We can't communicate
with these creatures.

00:53:35.550 --> 00:53:36.050
That's all.

00:53:36.050 --> 00:53:39.100
So these are the aliens that
we co-exist with on the planet.

00:53:39.100 --> 00:53:40.810
Maybe we should try
and understand them

00:53:40.810 --> 00:53:44.420
first before we see
what we get out there.

00:53:44.420 --> 00:53:46.750
And in terms of the ratio
of brain mass to body mass,

00:53:46.750 --> 00:53:47.500
we're special.

00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:49.420
But we're not like
off the chart.

00:53:49.420 --> 00:53:52.170
And some of these small
brains are very, very well

00:53:52.170 --> 00:53:54.930
put together packages.

00:53:54.930 --> 00:53:56.810
So you go up to
something like an orca,

00:53:56.810 --> 00:53:58.860
and it's a pretty close call.

00:53:58.860 --> 00:54:00.060
No natural enemies.

00:54:00.060 --> 00:54:02.040
We're their only enemy.

00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:04.700
Large brains, complex
brains, languages.

00:54:04.700 --> 00:54:07.000
The orca pods in
the Puget Sound have

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:10.380
dialects not only at the level
of different pods and sub-pods,

00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:12.470
but of family members,
individual family

00:54:12.470 --> 00:54:14.960
members or familial groupings.

00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:17.715
They are social animals
that raise their young

00:54:17.715 --> 00:54:20.330
in the similar proportion
of their total lifespan

00:54:20.330 --> 00:54:22.000
to humans raising their young.

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:23.950
And then it starts
to get less clear.

00:54:23.950 --> 00:54:25.020
Orcas mate for life.

00:54:25.020 --> 00:54:26.840
Statistically we don't.

00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:29.850
And I think the
problem with them

00:54:29.850 --> 00:54:31.550
is they don't have
opposable thumbs

00:54:31.550 --> 00:54:34.817
and so they've never done
this wireless internet stuff.

00:54:34.817 --> 00:54:35.900
And they don't have bombs.

00:54:35.900 --> 00:54:36.900
And they don't have cars.

00:54:36.900 --> 00:54:38.108
That's not really their loss.

00:54:38.108 --> 00:54:40.500
They're supremely adapted
to their environment.

00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:43.290
But I'll make another point
about evolution and time.

00:54:43.290 --> 00:54:46.700
On the left you see the rise
in brain mass corresponding

00:54:46.700 --> 00:54:49.820
to the evolutionary surge that
took us to the top of the pile.

00:54:49.820 --> 00:54:52.260
Notice that happened over
the last two million years

00:54:52.260 --> 00:54:55.520
and in a real surge in
the last 100,000 years.

00:54:55.520 --> 00:54:59.000
That brain mass increase is now
plotted in terms of the ratio

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:02.360
to body mass on the right
and the track of the apes

00:55:02.360 --> 00:55:04.850
our ancestors and
that recent surge

00:55:04.850 --> 00:55:07.940
taking us to encephalization
quotient of 7

00:55:07.940 --> 00:55:10.350
on the right edge shown.

00:55:10.350 --> 00:55:12.180
And the point is
that an alien coming

00:55:12.180 --> 00:55:14.690
to this planet at almost
any time in the last 50

00:55:14.690 --> 00:55:18.230
million years and saying, take
me to the brainy creatures,

00:55:18.230 --> 00:55:20.820
would have gone to the
whales and the dolphins

00:55:20.820 --> 00:55:21.860
and their ancestors.

00:55:21.860 --> 00:55:24.020
It's a very recent
thing that we've

00:55:24.020 --> 00:55:27.560
become the most encephalized
creatures on Earth.

00:55:27.560 --> 00:55:30.160
So it doesn't stand still.

00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:32.890
It's a snapshot.

00:55:32.890 --> 00:55:35.700
And we don't know how this
plays out in the future.

00:55:35.700 --> 00:55:38.560
We have no idea how
evolution how will take us.

00:55:38.560 --> 00:55:40.040
Life on earth is already weird.

00:55:40.040 --> 00:55:42.660
There's some very weird life
that we've already discussed.

00:55:42.660 --> 00:55:45.510
I think in general we could
have levels of weirdness.

00:55:45.510 --> 00:55:47.520
At the macroscopic
level, we could really

00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:50.380
have different cell
types than we have now.

00:55:50.380 --> 00:55:53.440
We could have much more
rapid rates of evolution

00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:56.640
based on something that does
happen in life on Earth, which

00:55:56.640 --> 00:56:01.270
is swapping of genetic material
in packages, either organisms

00:56:01.270 --> 00:56:03.500
co-opting each other
or genetic swamping.

00:56:03.500 --> 00:56:07.480
It doesn't have to be the
slow march of mutation and DNA

00:56:07.480 --> 00:56:08.670
variation.

00:56:08.670 --> 00:56:10.150
And then I think
there's no reason

00:56:10.150 --> 00:56:11.566
the universe
couldn't have created

00:56:11.566 --> 00:56:12.960
something other than a cell.

00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:14.610
You don't need a cell
to have something

00:56:14.610 --> 00:56:16.280
that you might call
biology, except you

00:56:16.280 --> 00:56:17.482
won't call it biology.

00:56:17.482 --> 00:56:18.940
You could have a
network as opposed

00:56:18.940 --> 00:56:21.590
to a container that did
everything fundamentally

00:56:21.590 --> 00:56:23.040
that biology does.

00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:25.530
And then some of these
things could clearly scale up

00:56:25.530 --> 00:56:26.800
to the level of a planet.

00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:28.770
And you could have
geoengineering of a planet

00:56:28.770 --> 00:56:31.480
by creatures that might be
individually at the organism

00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:33.454
level quite small.

00:56:33.454 --> 00:56:35.120
If you're talking
about the micro level,

00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:36.453
there's also possible weirdness.

00:56:36.453 --> 00:56:39.820
A variation, a small variation
would be just changing

00:56:39.820 --> 00:56:41.370
the genetic code a little bit.

00:56:41.370 --> 00:56:42.570
But that's very mild.

00:56:42.570 --> 00:56:43.280
That's modest.

00:56:43.280 --> 00:56:44.540
Let's go beyond that.

00:56:44.540 --> 00:56:48.240
You could go away from the
central dogma of biology,

00:56:48.240 --> 00:56:50.850
the triad of DNA,
RNA, and proteins.

00:56:50.850 --> 00:56:53.160
Or you could go to
non-carbon based

00:56:53.160 --> 00:56:57.836
biology or not using water as
your solvent, as your medium.

00:56:57.836 --> 00:57:00.210
And then you could actually--
there's room at the bottom.

00:57:00.210 --> 00:57:03.480
Although a human
has a DVD's worth

00:57:03.480 --> 00:57:06.790
of information in it the genetic
code, that's pretty impressive.

00:57:06.790 --> 00:57:08.760
That's not the
limit of compactness

00:57:08.760 --> 00:57:11.350
biochemistry could
attain, in principle.

00:57:11.350 --> 00:57:13.430
Now, whether it happens
in practice, who knows?

00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:15.710
And so you could have even
higher density and perhaps

00:57:15.710 --> 00:57:18.810
a vastly speeded
up scale evolution

00:57:18.810 --> 00:57:20.570
with a totally different basis.

00:57:20.570 --> 00:57:24.100
So I'm obviously getting
wildly speculating here.

00:57:24.100 --> 00:57:27.680
But the point is for exobiology,
we don't know what to expect.

00:57:27.680 --> 00:57:30.070
And some of these
forms of life, we

00:57:30.070 --> 00:57:31.620
look at the conjunct
of things that

00:57:31.620 --> 00:57:34.420
use planets, that
use carbon, that use

00:57:34.420 --> 00:57:36.660
DNA as their genetic material.

00:57:36.660 --> 00:57:39.740
But the conjunct of those
might be unrecognizable

00:57:39.740 --> 00:57:43.850
if one of those things doesn't
apply or none of them apply.

00:57:43.850 --> 00:57:45.890
So let's just look a
little into the future

00:57:45.890 --> 00:57:47.770
because it's a
snapshot right now.

00:57:47.770 --> 00:57:50.897
So what might change?

00:57:50.897 --> 00:57:52.480
The singularity, as
you probably know,

00:57:52.480 --> 00:57:54.950
is a term invented by Ray
Kurzweil, actually not.

00:57:54.950 --> 00:57:55.750
He popularized it.

00:57:55.750 --> 00:57:57.840
It was invented before him.

00:57:57.840 --> 00:58:00.890
But it's a reference to the fact
that at our stage of evolution,

00:58:00.890 --> 00:58:02.610
we may pass through
a membrane where

00:58:02.610 --> 00:58:04.770
we become post biological.

00:58:04.770 --> 00:58:06.540
And once again, if
we're not special,

00:58:06.540 --> 00:58:08.500
if the Copernican
principle applies,

00:58:08.500 --> 00:58:10.750
that could have happened
elsewhere in the universe.

00:58:10.750 --> 00:58:14.160
And given the time available,
it may well have happened.

00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:17.140
And looking at
this, the increase

00:58:17.140 --> 00:58:19.930
of information in the
genetic form of evolution

00:58:19.930 --> 00:58:23.240
has been dwarfed by cultural
evolution, when we invented

00:58:23.240 --> 00:58:26.690
civilization and books,
and then dwarfed yet again

00:58:26.690 --> 00:58:30.160
by digital evolution,
our modern technology.

00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:34.050
So the rate of information,
encoding, transmittal,

00:58:34.050 --> 00:58:37.470
and growth is now 10
to 18 times higher

00:58:37.470 --> 00:58:40.050
than it is with biology
alone acting over time.

00:58:40.050 --> 00:58:42.390
That's an incredible
acceleration.

00:58:42.390 --> 00:58:46.540
If you project Moore's law and
its equivalence in networking,

00:58:46.540 --> 00:58:48.470
you actually get
to a position where

00:58:48.470 --> 00:58:50.314
you could approximate
the capacity

00:58:50.314 --> 00:58:54.350
in the human brain in terms of
network connections in about

00:58:54.350 --> 00:58:56.230
20 years.

00:58:56.230 --> 00:58:58.550
And remember, this was ENIAC.

00:58:58.550 --> 00:59:01.880
And this was a computer
a long time ago

00:59:01.880 --> 00:59:04.560
that was in the size of a
family home, took about a third

00:59:04.560 --> 00:59:06.230
of the power of
Philadelphia to run it,

00:59:06.230 --> 00:59:09.150
had five technicians
full-time changing valves.

00:59:09.150 --> 00:59:12.250
And this is 50 times
worse than whatever

00:59:12.250 --> 00:59:15.320
cell phone, smartphone
you have in your pocket.

00:59:15.320 --> 00:59:16.790
So things don't stand still.

00:59:16.790 --> 00:59:19.520
And what matters really is the
capacity of the total package,

00:59:19.520 --> 00:59:21.500
not just the processor.

00:59:21.500 --> 00:59:24.000
And so people with
robots have shown

00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:28.710
how connecting simple machines
that have sensing capability

00:59:28.710 --> 00:59:30.390
and linking them
with a neural net,

00:59:30.390 --> 00:59:32.780
so it has the capacity
to self-program

00:59:32.780 --> 00:59:34.235
and to learn from
its environment,

00:59:34.235 --> 00:59:37.880
it's not intelligent, the
intelligence is not put in.

00:59:37.880 --> 00:59:40.083
It emerges from the base level.

00:59:40.083 --> 00:59:43.950
This creates some
interesting possibilities.

00:59:43.950 --> 00:59:45.890
It's machine intelligence,
but of course it's

00:59:45.890 --> 00:59:47.542
facilitated by humans.

00:59:51.190 --> 00:59:53.460
So after iterations
of this, again,

00:59:53.460 --> 00:59:55.010
these behaviors
are not programmed

00:59:55.010 --> 00:59:57.950
into the little robots at all.

00:59:57.950 --> 01:00:01.422
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:00:14.350 --> 01:00:15.310
So here's the point.

01:00:15.310 --> 01:00:17.460
We make this prediction
or projection

01:00:17.460 --> 01:00:18.610
based on Moore's Law.

01:00:18.610 --> 01:00:22.430
This is the history of
computers over almost a century.

01:00:22.430 --> 01:00:25.920
And it projects to
a capacity to equal

01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:29.980
our capability in robotic
form in about 20 or 30 years.

01:00:29.980 --> 01:00:31.871
It depends how you
do the projection.

01:00:31.871 --> 01:00:33.370
And, of course,
that could either be

01:00:33.370 --> 01:00:35.700
a computer that
can do what we do

01:00:35.700 --> 01:00:37.700
or a machine that can
generate the ability

01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:40.590
to travel between stars
and colonize the galaxy.

01:00:40.590 --> 01:00:44.290
Both of those possibilities
are projected by our capability

01:00:44.290 --> 01:00:47.500
within a couple of decades.

01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:49.520
And the most important
point is that we don't

01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:52.500
have to go there ourselves.

01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:55.740
We can send the
machines instead of us.

01:00:55.740 --> 01:00:58.340
So a simple model of
tenth light speed travel--

01:00:58.340 --> 01:01:00.090
you're not violating
relativity--

01:01:00.090 --> 01:01:02.390
can have us colonizing
the galaxies.

01:01:02.390 --> 01:01:05.780
And this colonization will
be done by our progeny.

01:01:05.780 --> 01:01:07.270
And our progeny
will be machines.

01:01:07.270 --> 01:01:08.080
They won't be us.

01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:08.840
We're too frail.

01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:10.020
We won't go.

01:01:10.020 --> 01:01:12.720
So let me just talk about
contemplating the aliens

01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:15.110
and what we actually do.

01:01:15.110 --> 01:01:18.150
What's the scientific
experiment to do this?

01:01:18.150 --> 01:01:20.240
The question, the
central question

01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:22.700
in this subject in advance
of finding intelligent life

01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:25.960
elsewhere and with such an
expectation of habitable worlds

01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:27.570
is, where are they?

01:01:27.570 --> 01:01:30.900
And Enrico Fermi asked this
very well posed question back

01:01:30.900 --> 01:01:35.140
in 1950, because he knew that
our civilization is so young.

01:01:35.140 --> 01:01:37.740
And a very small extrapolation
of what we can do

01:01:37.740 --> 01:01:39.510
would have us
traveling the galaxy.

01:01:39.510 --> 01:01:40.710
That's simply the fact.

01:01:40.710 --> 01:01:42.730
No new technologies
are required.

01:01:42.730 --> 01:01:45.660
He also knew that there
were incredibly large number

01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:48.651
of sites for life and
an incredibly long time.

01:01:48.651 --> 01:01:50.400
There could have been
an Earth-like planet

01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:54.220
with an absolute Earth clone,
as close as you could get,

01:01:54.220 --> 01:01:57.840
that formed 6 billion years
before the Earth formed

01:01:57.840 --> 01:02:00.360
and have that much
of a head start on us

01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:01.530
in terms of evolution.

01:02:01.530 --> 01:02:03.210
What would that have spawned?

01:02:03.210 --> 01:02:04.900
There could be
creatures out there

01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:08.690
that are to us as we are
to anaerobic bacteria.

01:02:08.690 --> 01:02:09.840
What would that look like?

01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:12.390
These are the questions
that we expect.

01:02:12.390 --> 01:02:13.580
Nature may have provided.

01:02:13.580 --> 01:02:15.524
And we can't answer
these questions.

01:02:15.524 --> 01:02:17.690
And so the possible answers
to Fermi are, of course,

01:02:17.690 --> 01:02:19.220
diverse, because we
don't know the answer.

01:02:19.220 --> 01:02:20.740
But it's possible
they don't exist

01:02:20.740 --> 01:02:24.280
and we are a unique accident
as a technological, intelligent

01:02:24.280 --> 01:02:25.517
species.

01:02:25.517 --> 01:02:27.850
It's possible they're rare
enough that in time and space

01:02:27.850 --> 01:02:28.660
we're isolated.

01:02:28.660 --> 01:02:30.270
The universe is a big place.

01:02:30.270 --> 01:02:32.040
The galaxy is a big place.

01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:35.320
It's quite possible they're
either unrecognizable or

01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:36.450
inscrutable.

01:02:36.450 --> 01:02:37.650
That we don't they're there.

01:02:37.650 --> 01:02:39.500
We don't know how
to recognize them.

01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:42.470
Their communications, we don't
know how to recognize even

01:02:42.470 --> 01:02:44.400
as communications.

01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:47.580
And another possibility
is that they don't care.

01:02:47.580 --> 01:02:51.790
If we went to a distant
planet and found some lichen

01:02:51.790 --> 01:02:54.360
on the surface of a rock and
wrote it in their tricorder,

01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:56.270
lichen, not very interesting.

01:02:56.270 --> 01:02:58.587
They may be as advanced
to us as we are to lichen.

01:02:58.587 --> 01:03:00.920
And so they've already visited
the Earth and just wrote,

01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:04.030
hm, humans,
uninteresting, move on.

01:03:04.030 --> 01:03:06.920
You know, I mean that's not
the science fiction trope.

01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:08.830
But that's possibly
what happened.

01:03:08.830 --> 01:03:12.270
And then another possibility is
that they actually created us.

01:03:12.270 --> 01:03:15.230
And I'm not going to-- I'm
going to skip ahead a little

01:03:15.230 --> 01:03:17.700
here because I'm getting behind.

01:03:17.700 --> 01:03:20.280
So let me talk about how
we might make contact.

01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:22.860
So this is the scientific
experiment of SETI.

01:03:22.860 --> 01:03:24.990
This is not how it's
going to happen.

01:03:24.990 --> 01:03:29.980
We're not going to tempt them
with groceries or candy or beer

01:03:29.980 --> 01:03:33.230
or anything like that.

01:03:33.230 --> 01:03:37.050
It is possible that
they're among us,

01:03:37.050 --> 01:03:41.960
which I guess logically
also means among you, or me.

01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:44.370
So that's a possibility that
we don't need to look far

01:03:44.370 --> 01:03:46.190
because they're already here.

01:03:46.190 --> 01:03:48.120
But let me just discount
that for a minute

01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:51.440
and say that with what we
know at the moment, the way

01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:54.970
we approach the issue of
technological civilizations

01:03:54.970 --> 01:03:57.140
and communication with
intelligent aliens

01:03:57.140 --> 01:04:00.680
is by looking at the way the
real estate of the Milky Way

01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:03.540
reduces when you ask
that it have planets,

01:04:03.540 --> 01:04:06.870
that the planets be habitable,
that life actually happens

01:04:06.870 --> 01:04:08.600
on those planets
that are habitable,

01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:10.940
that there's sufficient
time, and that the occurrence

01:04:10.940 --> 01:04:13.590
of intelligence that
intelligence gets technology.

01:04:13.590 --> 01:04:16.890
And you can see it's a
diminishing set of terms, which

01:04:16.890 --> 01:04:18.550
turns into the Drake equation.

01:04:18.550 --> 01:04:21.730
And so the Drake equation
is a simple formula

01:04:21.730 --> 01:04:24.280
to calculate the number of
intelligent communicable

01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:26.480
civilizations.

01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:30.500
And what you'll recognize
is that the first three

01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:33.279
terms are astronomical.

01:04:33.279 --> 01:04:34.820
The first three
terms are essentially

01:04:34.820 --> 01:04:37.790
measured by information
I've given you this evening.

01:04:37.790 --> 01:04:41.620
The third, the fourth, fifth,
and sixth and seventh terms

01:04:41.620 --> 01:04:43.100
are indeterminate.

01:04:43.100 --> 01:04:44.430
We have no idea what they are.

01:04:44.430 --> 01:04:46.020
And so you can get
any N you want.

01:04:46.020 --> 01:04:48.780
And that's just the state
we're in at the moment.

01:04:48.780 --> 01:04:49.720
What have we done?

01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:51.510
We've sent little
messages in a bottle.

01:04:51.510 --> 01:04:54.350
This was attached to the
Pioneer 10 spacecraft, now left

01:04:54.350 --> 01:04:55.620
the solar system.

01:04:55.620 --> 01:04:57.970
This was attached to
the Voyager spacecraft,

01:04:57.970 --> 01:04:59.630
now left the solar system.

01:04:59.630 --> 01:05:01.622
And you could critique
it because we don't even

01:05:01.622 --> 01:05:04.080
use that technology on Earth
that we're really showing them

01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:06.660
how clever we are, aren't we.

01:05:06.660 --> 01:05:08.340
Well, OK, I know
there are audiofiles

01:05:08.340 --> 01:05:11.200
that do-- the scientists
involved actually

01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:13.210
defended this because
they said it's actually

01:05:13.210 --> 01:05:15.180
very robust, analog technology.

01:05:15.180 --> 01:05:17.580
We don't know the
longevity of DVDs or CDs.

01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:19.140
There's already
signs they degrade.

01:05:19.140 --> 01:05:23.110
So this will last 100,000
years, not a bad idea.

01:05:23.110 --> 01:05:25.500
So here's the real
state of the experiment.

01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:27.150
If you know anything
about the search

01:05:27.150 --> 01:05:28.800
for extraterrestrial
intelligence,

01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:32.010
mostly using radio signals
and more recently using

01:05:32.010 --> 01:05:35.010
optical pulsed lasers,
you'll know that we've

01:05:35.010 --> 01:05:36.570
had 50 years of silence.

01:05:36.570 --> 01:05:39.954
But the people who do this work
are an indomitable species,

01:05:39.954 --> 01:05:41.370
because they don't
get discouraged

01:05:41.370 --> 01:05:43.030
by 50 years of failure.

01:05:43.030 --> 01:05:45.990
I think I would go away
with my tail between my legs

01:05:45.990 --> 01:05:47.200
after probably a decade.

01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:49.200
But they're some of them
have been plugging away

01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:52.430
for 50 years, like
Frank Drake himself.

01:05:52.430 --> 01:05:55.320
But it's getting interesting
because they are projecting

01:05:55.320 --> 01:06:00.530
that within a decade or so
we will have the capacity

01:06:00.530 --> 01:06:03.820
to listen to our analog
technology of radio

01:06:03.820 --> 01:06:08.840
transmitters or pulse lasers
on any of 100 million stars

01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:11.800
at distances of up
to 3,000 light years.

01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:13.230
That's pretty impressive.

01:06:13.230 --> 01:06:16.200
That means if any
civilization on planets

01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:20.510
around any of 100 million stars
are transmitting information

01:06:20.510 --> 01:06:22.800
by those two methods,
we could detect it.

01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:24.460
And they could detect us.

01:06:24.460 --> 01:06:26.600
And I do think that makes
an interesting scientific

01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:27.100
experiment.

01:06:27.100 --> 01:06:28.849
And they'll just point
out that we've only

01:06:28.849 --> 01:06:32.440
just got into the regime
where we have this capability.

01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:33.590
So it's a transient thing.

01:06:33.590 --> 01:06:36.000
You know, you're only going
detect civilizations that

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
are somewhere near your
stage of development,

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:42.070
because in 50 years we'll
be making baby universes

01:06:42.070 --> 01:06:44.110
and slinging gravity
waves at each other.

01:06:44.110 --> 01:06:45.650
And we'll be doing other things.

01:06:45.650 --> 01:06:48.170
We're not going to be using
lasers and radio transmitters.

01:06:48.170 --> 01:06:50.710
We'll do something else.

01:06:50.710 --> 01:06:53.220
A less comfortable
possibility is

01:06:53.220 --> 01:06:54.990
that there are very advanced.

01:06:54.990 --> 01:06:56.680
And I have mentioned
one possibility

01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:59.560
of them being very advanced
is that they don't care.

01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:04.210
Another one sort of brings
down our sense of ourselves

01:07:04.210 --> 01:07:08.390
because they might view us
a slightly different way.

01:07:08.390 --> 01:07:10.420
And that's sort of the
Stephen Hawking scenario

01:07:10.420 --> 01:07:12.670
where we sort of don't want
to make contact because we

01:07:12.670 --> 01:07:15.280
don't want to know the answer.

01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:18.530
So to conclude, let me give you
the census of habitable worlds.

01:07:18.530 --> 01:07:20.990
Let me give you the full
real estate that's out there.

01:07:20.990 --> 01:07:23.210
And you can do the
math in your head

01:07:23.210 --> 01:07:25.830
of what you think the likelihood
of life on those planets

01:07:25.830 --> 01:07:27.010
is, because we don't know.

01:07:27.010 --> 01:07:29.840
So you can put in
the number you like.

01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:31.176
So here's an analogy.

01:07:31.176 --> 01:07:33.050
Let's use grains of
sand, because at least we

01:07:33.050 --> 01:07:34.080
can visualize this.

01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:36.460
The numbers are too
large otherwise.

01:07:36.460 --> 01:07:39.030
The number of grains of sand
you could put on your finger

01:07:39.030 --> 01:07:41.680
if you wet your
fingertip may be 500.

01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:43.530
That's how many
exoplanets we found.

01:07:43.530 --> 01:07:46.370
That's how many
stars nearby, really

01:07:46.370 --> 01:07:48.350
nearby, within
tens of light years

01:07:48.350 --> 01:07:50.840
we've looked at since 1995.

01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:52.310
These are mostly
the giant planets,

01:07:52.310 --> 01:07:56.170
the terrestrial planets are
motes, too small to see.

01:07:56.170 --> 01:07:57.960
We expect, based
on the numbers I've

01:07:57.960 --> 01:08:01.040
given you in the Kepler results,
a billion habitable worlds

01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:03.200
in the Milky Way galaxy alone.

01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:06.760
Probably 10% of those will be
terrestrial Earth-like planets,

01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:09.800
not total Earth clones, but
pretty close, spitting distance

01:08:09.800 --> 01:08:12.100
from Earth, 100 million.

01:08:12.100 --> 01:08:15.770
Then remember, previous
lectures, 100 billion galaxies

01:08:15.770 --> 01:08:17.450
in the observable universe.

01:08:17.450 --> 01:08:19.660
That means the number
of habitable planets

01:08:19.660 --> 01:08:23.950
in the universe is the grains of
sand on the entire arc of beach

01:08:23.950 --> 01:08:26.040
miles long.

01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:29.210
That is a conservative,
traditional habitable zone

01:08:29.210 --> 01:08:30.689
with liquid water
on the surface,

01:08:30.689 --> 01:08:32.080
using current statistics.

01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:34.510
That's what the
universe has provided.

01:08:34.510 --> 01:08:38.640
Do you prefer that those
billion billion habitable worlds

01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:39.524
are all sterile?

01:08:39.524 --> 01:08:42.090
That life happened
on none of them?

01:08:42.090 --> 01:08:44.569
What fraction do you
think it happened on?

01:08:44.569 --> 01:08:46.569
And assuming it happens
on some fraction,

01:08:46.569 --> 01:08:49.420
what fraction of those do you
think the experiment persists

01:08:49.420 --> 01:08:52.200
long enough for something
interesting like this

01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:53.479
to happen?

01:08:53.479 --> 01:08:54.700
It's an interesting question.

01:08:54.700 --> 01:08:56.620
And it's well motivated,
well conceived.

01:08:56.620 --> 01:09:00.950
And we may actually
start to get the answer.

01:09:00.950 --> 01:09:04.529
This travelogue is a
snapshot of how difficult

01:09:04.529 --> 01:09:06.270
this experiment is.

01:09:06.270 --> 01:09:10.160
You're seeing an exoplanet,
an imagined distant world,

01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:11.967
every five seconds.

01:09:11.967 --> 01:09:13.550
And we don't know
what they look like.

01:09:13.550 --> 01:09:14.899
Most of them will be sterile.

01:09:14.899 --> 01:09:16.357
Most of them will
be uninteresting.

01:09:16.357 --> 01:09:18.729
Most of them will be dead.

01:09:18.729 --> 01:09:22.585
In this travelogue where
one exoplanet is every five

01:09:22.585 --> 01:09:24.450
seconds, to just
do a snapshot view

01:09:24.450 --> 01:09:28.810
of the truly Earth-like
habitable worlds in the Milky

01:09:28.810 --> 01:09:31.310
Way alone would
take 5,000 years.

01:09:31.310 --> 01:09:33.810
That's how much real
estate there is.

01:09:33.810 --> 01:09:35.569
To do it in the
universe, forget it.

01:09:35.569 --> 01:09:39.053
There's not enough
geological time to do it.

01:09:39.053 --> 01:09:40.802
So this is the experiment
that's underway.

01:09:40.802 --> 01:09:43.520
It's at the limit
of our technologies.

01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:44.850
It's really hard to do.

01:09:44.850 --> 01:09:48.065
Finding Earth is going to be the
challenge of the next decade.

01:09:48.065 --> 01:09:50.005
And we will find Earths.

01:09:50.005 --> 01:09:50.975
They won't be close.

01:09:50.975 --> 01:09:52.915
They won't be easy to follow up.

01:09:52.915 --> 01:09:55.340
Those traces of life
will be hard to find.

01:09:55.340 --> 01:09:58.250
But I think the game is now on.

01:09:58.250 --> 01:10:00.190
And that's very exciting.

01:10:00.190 --> 01:10:03.818
In my last video clip, I want to
pay homage to is a hero of mine

01:10:03.818 --> 01:10:05.430
and a hero of many
of my colleagues

01:10:05.430 --> 01:10:09.320
actually, who conceived of most
of these ideas, who laid out

01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:11.000
the landscape of
astrobiology decades

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:14.500
before planets around other
stars were discovered,

[MUSIC - CARL SAGAN, "A GLORIOUS
 DAWN"]

01:10:18.456 --> 01:10:21.052
I'm not very good
at singing songs.

01:10:21.052 --> 01:10:24.034
But here's a try.

01:10:24.034 --> 01:10:27.513
This is him updated a little.

01:10:27.513 --> 01:10:30.992
Ah, whoop.

01:10:30.992 --> 01:10:32.980
Ah, whoop.

01:10:32.980 --> 01:10:35.465
Ah, ah. whoop.

01:10:35.465 --> 01:10:41.429
If you wish to make an
apple pie from scratch,

01:10:41.429 --> 01:10:45.902
you must first
invent the universe.

01:10:45.902 --> 01:10:51.410
Space is filled with a
network of wormholes.

01:10:51.410 --> 01:10:54.512
You find yourself
somewhere else in space,

01:10:54.512 --> 01:10:56.360
some-when else in time.

01:10:56.360 --> 01:10:59.110
The sky calls to us.

01:10:59.110 --> 01:11:04.100
If we do not destroy
ourselves, we well one day

01:11:04.100 --> 01:11:05.690
venture to the stars.

01:11:05.690 --> 01:11:09.918
A still more glorious dawn
awaits, not a sunrise,

01:11:09.918 --> 01:11:12.210
but a galaxy rise.

01:11:12.210 --> 01:11:16.460
A wormhole filled 400
billion suns and the rising

01:11:16.460 --> 01:11:18.284
of the Milky Way.

01:11:18.284 --> 01:11:20.744
The cosmos is full
beyond measure.

01:11:20.744 --> 01:11:24.744
Elegant truths, exquisite
interrelationships,

01:11:24.744 --> 01:11:27.204
the awesome machinery of nature.

01:11:27.204 --> 01:11:30.156
I believe our future
depends powerfully

01:11:30.156 --> 01:11:33.120
on how we understand
this cosmos, which

01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:38.170
we float like a mote of
dust on the morning sky.

01:11:38.170 --> 01:11:41.320
The brain does more
than recollect.

01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:42.790
It inter-compares.

01:11:42.790 --> 01:11:43.770
It synthesizes.

01:11:43.770 --> 01:11:44.750
It analyzes.

01:11:44.750 --> 01:11:48.110
It generates abstractions.

01:11:48.110 --> 01:11:50.840
The simplest thought, like
the concept of the number one,

01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:53.300
has a logical underpinning.

01:11:53.300 --> 01:11:56.250
The brain has its own language,
for testing the structure

01:11:56.250 --> 01:11:58.480
and consistency of the world.

01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:01.995
A single, glorious dawn
awaits, not a sunrise,

01:12:01.995 --> 01:12:03.850
but a galaxy rise.

01:12:03.850 --> 01:12:08.850
A morning filled with 400
billion suns and the rising

01:12:08.850 --> 01:12:10.490
of the Milky Way.

01:12:13.780 --> 01:12:16.156
The sky calls to us.

01:12:16.156 --> 01:12:19.734
If we do not destroy
ourself, we will one day

01:12:19.734 --> 01:12:21.698
venture to the stars.

01:12:34.470 --> 01:12:38.719
For 1,000 some years, people
have about the universe.

01:12:38.719 --> 01:12:44.515
Did it stretch out forever
or was there a limit?

01:12:44.515 --> 01:12:48.561
From the Big Bang to black
holes, from dark matter

01:12:48.561 --> 01:12:52.359
to a possible big crunch, our
image of the universe today

01:12:52.359 --> 01:12:55.140
is full strange sounding ideas.

01:12:55.140 --> 01:12:58.077
How lucky we are to
live in this time.

01:12:58.077 --> 01:13:00.000
The first moment
in human history

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:04.860
we are in fact
visiting other worlds.

01:13:04.860 --> 01:13:09.260
A still more glorious dawn
awaits, not a sunrise,

01:13:09.260 --> 01:13:10.720
but a galaxy rise.

01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:16.430
A morning to 400 billion suns,
the rising of the Milky Way.

01:13:16.430 --> 01:13:21.040
A still more dawn awaits. not
a sunrise, but a galaxy rise.

01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:24.110
A morning filled
400 billion suns,

01:13:24.110 --> 01:13:27.610
with the rising
of the Milky Way.

01:13:31.334 --> 01:13:36.680
The surface from the Earth is
the shore of the cosmic ocean.

01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:39.376
Recently, we waded
out a little way out

01:13:39.376 --> 01:13:40.710
and the water seems inviting.

01:13:44.134 --> 01:13:45.577
[END PLAYBACK]

01:13:45.577 --> 01:13:47.900
Well, we thank you
very much for coming.

01:13:47.900 --> 01:13:50.070
A big round of applause
for Chris Impey.

01:13:50.070 --> 01:13:51.870
[APPLAUSE]

01:14:00.870 --> 01:14:04.220
