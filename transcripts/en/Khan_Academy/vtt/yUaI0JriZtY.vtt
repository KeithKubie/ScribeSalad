00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.680
Find the probability of pulling
a yellow marble from a bag

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.900
with 3 yellow, 2 red,
2 green, and 1 blue--

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.000
I'm assuming-- marbles.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.830
So they say the
probability-- I'll just

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.460
say p for probability.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:17.340
The probability of
picking a yellow marble.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.720
And so this is sometimes
the event in question,

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.880
right over here, is
picking the yellow marble.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.004
I'll even write down
the word "picking."

00:00:24.004 --> 00:00:25.420
And when you say
probability, it's

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.650
really just a way of
measuring the likelihood

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.570
that something is
going to happen.

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.729
And the way we're going to
think about it is how many

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:36.640
of the outcomes from this trial,
from this picking a marble out

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.050
of a bag, how many
meet our constraints,

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.600
satisfy this event?

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.700
And how many possible
outcomes are there?

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.280
So let me write the possible
outcomes right over here,

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:52.280
so possible outcomes.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.680
And you'll see it's actually
a very straightforward idea.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.013
But I'll just make sure that
we understand all the words

00:00:57.013 --> 00:00:58.570
that people might
say, so the set

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.552
of all the possible outcomes.

00:01:00.552 --> 00:01:02.010
Well, there's three
yellow marbles.

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.379
So I could pick that yellow
marble, that yellow marble,

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.400
or that yellow marble,
that yellow marble.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.020
These are clearly all yellow.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.840
There's two red
marbles in the bag.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.380
So I could pick that red
marble or that red marble.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.020
There's two green
marbles in the bag.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.140
So I could pick that green
marble or that green marble.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.720
And then there's one
blue marble in the bag.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.750
There's one blue marble.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.020
So this is all the
possible outcomes.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.370
And sometimes this is referred
to as the sample space,

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.820
the set of all the
possible outcomes.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.880
Fancy word for
just a simple idea,

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.960
that the sample space, when I
pick something out of the bag,

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.540
and that picking out of
the bag is called a trial,

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.549
there's 8 possible
things I can do.

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:48.090
So when I think
about the probability

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.840
of picking a yellow marble,
I want to think about, well,

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.560
what are all of
the possibilities?

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.030
Well, there's 8 possibilities,
8 possibilities for my trial.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.790
So the number of outcomes,
number of possible outcomes,

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.896
you could view it as the size
of the sample space, number

00:02:04.896 --> 00:02:07.020
of possible outcomes, And
it's as simple as saying,

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.362
look, I have 8 marbles.

00:02:08.362 --> 00:02:10.070
And then you say,
well, how many of those

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.500
marbles meet my constraint,
that satisfy this event here?

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.930
Well, there's 3 marbles
that satisfy my event.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.262
There's 3 outcomes that will
allow this event to occur,

00:02:22.262 --> 00:02:23.470
I guess is one way to say it.

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.100
So there's 3 right over
here, so number that

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:34.970
satisfy the event or the
constraint right over here.

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.750
So it's very simple ideas.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.550
Many times the
words make them more

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.250
complicated than they need to.

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.010
If I say, what's the probability
of picking a yellow marble?

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.690
Well, how many different
types of marbles can I pick?

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.230
Well, there's 8 different
marbles I could pick.

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.560
And then how many
of them are yellow?

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.809
Well, there's 3 of them
that are actually yellow.
