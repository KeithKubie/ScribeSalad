00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.430
You finished your App,

00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:05.970
you swear you tested it thoroughly, and
now you're ready to publish, but how?

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.500
There are the obvious basics,

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.790
cleaning up the code, double checking
your servers, and building a final APK.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.021
Once you have your final build,
you can distribute your APK through

00:00:15.021 --> 00:00:18.375
a marketplace, like the Google Play
store, email, or on a website.

00:00:18.375 --> 00:00:22.843
But even knowing all of this, it's
not quite clear how to get that APK.

00:00:22.843 --> 00:00:25.240
The biggest thing here is
figuring out the difference,

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.586
between when you run your
App from Android Studio, and

00:00:27.586 --> 00:00:30.950
when it comes from something
like the Google Play Store.

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.320
Android Studio does a good job of
hiding some of the little details

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.250
that aren't relevant to development.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.380
For example, it automatically signs your
APK with a debug key during development.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.850
However, you can't
publish with a debug key.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.435
You need a separate private key,
to sign your App with,

00:00:46.435 --> 00:00:48.534
before you can distribute
it on Google Play.

00:00:48.534 --> 00:00:52.963
For this lesson, we've created a written
set of instructions on how to build and

00:00:52.963 --> 00:00:53.690
sign an APK.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.247
But, as always,
you can check the documentation link,

00:00:56.247 --> 00:00:59.670
in the instructor notes, for more
information and details on these steps.
