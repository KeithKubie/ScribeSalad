00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:02.170
- [Voiceover] Which
expression is equivalent

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:04.250
to the above difference?

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:06.250
All right, this is going to be fun.

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:08.370
So we're adding these two,

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.530
I guess we could say rational expressions.

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.511
And whenever you add any
expressions like this,

00:00:12.511 --> 00:00:14.190
if you add any fractions,

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.610
you would have to have
a common denominator

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:16.920
and the same thing is true over here.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.730
And so one thing we can do is

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:20.850
let me actually see if I can, can I,

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.470
actually, let me re-write the whole thing.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.430
So three over X squared

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.670
plus five X minus 24

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:31.491
minus seven over X minus three.

00:00:31.491 --> 00:00:33.830
now instead of you know, what,

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.070
I guess the brute force way

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.350
is to just multiply the denominators

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.710
and say okay, that's going
to be a common multiple

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.850
but there might be a
cleaner way of doing that,

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.450
especially if X minus three

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:45.850
is one of the factors of this.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.470
So let's see if this is.

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.910
So let's see, negative
three times positive eight

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:53.770
is going to be negative 24

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.630
and the negtive three plus positive eight

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.550
is positive five so this actually can

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.390
be factored into X plus eight times,

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.330
X plus eight times X minus three.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.170
this is what this thing is

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.431
and if this step looks unfamiliar to you,

00:01:10.431 --> 00:01:11.790
I encourage you to watch the video

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.890
on factoring quadratic expressions.

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.330
But what's neat about this is

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:17.410
now we say okay, look,

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.190
to have the same denominator here,

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.330
we just have to take this fraction

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.470
and multiply the numerator

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.410
and denominator by X plus eight

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.010
so if you multiply the denominator

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.790
by X plus eight,

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.530
then these two denominators are equivalent

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.610
but I can't just multiply the denominator

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:32.330
by X plus eight,

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.490
I also have to multiply the numerator

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:35.770
times X plus eight.

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.350
And so what does this simplify to?

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.270
This is going to be equal to

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.590
three over X plus eight

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.470
times X minus three, times X minus three.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.610
And then, minus, minus,

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.210
and actually, let me distribute the seven.

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.650
Minus, remember, we have
this negative sign out front

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.170
so it's going to be minus seven,

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.610
actually, let me just
write it this way first.

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.810
Minus seven X plus 56

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.850
over, over X plus eight

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:11.610
times X minus three.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.390
If I was really under
time pressure on the SAT,

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.850
I wouldn't probably do all of these steps.

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:16.950
I would try to get to the chase,

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.330
cut to the chase a little bit faster

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.490
but this is hopefully so it
helps us understand things.

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.710
And so this is going to be equal to,

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.350
we have our common denominator.

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.251
X plus eight times X minus three,

00:02:29.251 --> 00:02:31.250
so it's going to be three

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.450
and we can distribute this negative sign,

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.150
minus seven X, minus, minus 56.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.870
So it's going to be equal to,

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.751
let's see, we can write negative seven X

00:02:42.751 --> 00:02:46.410
and then 3 minus 56 is minus 53,

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:47.910
or negative 53

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.750
and X plus eight times X minus three,

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.510
we already established is the same thing

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.270
as X squared plus five X minus 24.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.810
And that is exactly,

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.640
that's exactly this
choice right over there.
