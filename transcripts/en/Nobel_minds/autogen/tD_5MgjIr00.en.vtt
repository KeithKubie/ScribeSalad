so I've I've been interested in

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:06.840
so I've I've been interested in
 

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:16.740
so I've I've been interested in
gravitational waves for a long tono so I

00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:16.750

I began this inquiry really with a

00:18:21.539 --> 00:18:21.549
I began this inquiry really with a
 

00:18:21.549 --> 00:18:27.029
I began this inquiry really with a
series of stories stories and thought

00:18:27.029 --> 00:18:27.039
series of stories stories and thought
 

00:18:27.039 --> 00:18:29.940
series of stories stories and thought
experiments and I thought what I would

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:29.950
experiments and I thought what I would
 

00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:32.970
experiments and I thought what I would
do in the lecture today is give you a

00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:32.980
do in the lecture today is give you a
 

00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:35.789
do in the lecture today is give you a
sense of the path of behavioral

00:18:35.789 --> 00:18:35.799
sense of the path of behavioral
 

00:18:35.799 --> 00:18:38.430

economics how it started from these

00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:38.440
economics how it started from these
 

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:42.930
economics how it started from these
stories and thought experiments and we

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:42.940
stories and thought experiments and we
 

00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:46.590
stories and thought experiments and we
will end up with the Swedish social

00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:46.600
will end up with the Swedish social
 

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:51.080
will end up with the Swedish social
security system which is another

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:51.090

so maybe my most famous story involves a

00:18:59.789 --> 00:18:59.799
so maybe my most famous story involves a
 

00:18:59.799 --> 00:19:02.870
so maybe my most famous story involves a
dinner party and a bowl of cashew nuts

00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:02.880
dinner party and a bowl of cashew nuts
 

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:05.399
dinner party and a bowl of cashew nuts
this was back when I was in graduate

00:19:05.399 --> 00:19:05.409
this was back when I was in graduate
 

00:19:05.409 --> 00:19:09.210
this was back when I was in graduate
school a bunch of economists were coming

00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:09.220
school a bunch of economists were coming
 

00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:13.110
school a bunch of economists were coming
over for dinner we put out a bowl of

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:13.120
over for dinner we put out a bowl of
 

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:15.210
over for dinner we put out a bowl of
cashews and served drinks

00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:15.220
cashews and served drinks
 

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:18.570
cashews and served drinks
and after a while about half the bowl

00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:18.580
and after a while about half the bowl
 

00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:21.240
and after a while about half the bowl
had been consumed we were worried about

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:21.250
had been consumed we were worried about
 

00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:24.659
had been consumed we were worried about
our appetites and so I took the bowl and

00:19:24.659 --> 00:19:24.669
our appetites and so I took the bowl and
 

00:19:24.669 --> 00:19:29.100
our appetites and so I took the bowl and
hid it in the kitchen and I think came

00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:29.110
hid it in the kitchen and I think came
 

00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:33.750
hid it in the kitchen and I think came
back and first of all everybody thanked

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:33.760
back and first of all everybody thanked
 

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:36.860
back and first of all everybody thanked
me thank God you got rid of those nuts

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:36.870
me thank God you got rid of those nuts
 

00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:39.509
me thank God you got rid of those nuts
and then since it was a group of

00:19:39.509 --> 00:19:39.519
and then since it was a group of
 

00:19:39.519 --> 00:19:43.590
and then since it was a group of
economics graduate students we began to

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:43.600
economics graduate students we began to
 

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:47.399

going to a dinner party with a group of
 

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:54.000
going to a dinner party with a group of
economists and so the the analysis was a

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:54.010
economists and so the the analysis was a
 

00:19:54.010 --> 00:19:56.279

we're gonna say he bought a bottle for

00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:11.540
we're gonna say he bought a bottle for
 

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:17.810
we're gonna say he bought a bottle for
$4.95 and later was able to sell it for

00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:17.820
$4.95 and later was able to sell it for
 

00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:23.870
$4.95 and later was able to sell it for
$100 and he had a rule that he wasn't

drink one of his old bottles well that's

00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:34.800
drink one of his old bottles well that's
 

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:38.480
drink one of his old bottles well that's
a puzzle if you're an economist he won't

a friend and I were given tickets to a

a friend and I were given tickets to a
 

00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:19.000
a friend and I were given tickets to a
basketball game in Buffalo we were

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:19.010
basketball game in Buffalo we were
 

00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:21.370
basketball game in Buffalo we were
living in Rochester there was a big

00:22:21.370 --> 00:22:21.380
living in Rochester there was a big
 

00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:24.940
living in Rochester there was a big
snowstorm and we wisely decided not to

00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:24.950
snowstorm and we wisely decided not to
 

00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:28.570
snowstorm and we wisely decided not to
go to the game but my friend said had we

00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:28.580
go to the game but my friend said had we
 

00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:31.000
go to the game but my friend said had we
bought those tickets we would have been

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:31.010
bought those tickets we would have been
 

00:22:31.010 --> 00:22:33.180
bought those tickets we would have been
we would go to that game

00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:33.190
we would go to that game
 

00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:35.590
we would go to that game
now of course economists call this the

00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:35.600
now of course economists call this the
 

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:39.790
now of course economists call this the
sunk cost fallacy and the the question

00:22:39.790 --> 00:22:39.800
sunk cost fallacy and the the question
 

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:43.240
sunk cost fallacy and the the question
is why would anybody think going to the

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:43.250
is why would anybody think going to the
 

00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:48.490
is why would anybody think going to the
game helps so yes in that hypothetical

00:22:48.490 --> 00:22:48.500
game helps so yes in that hypothetical
 

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:50.049
game helps so yes in that hypothetical
where we had paid a lot of money for

00:22:50.049 --> 00:22:50.059
where we had paid a lot of money for
 

00:22:50.059 --> 00:22:53.919
where we had paid a lot of money for
these tickets there would be that wasted

00:22:53.919 --> 00:22:53.929
these tickets there would be that wasted
 

00:22:53.929 --> 00:22:56.080
these tickets there would be that wasted
money but going to the game wasn't gonna

00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:56.090
money but going to the game wasn't gonna
 

00:22:56.090 --> 00:22:59.200
money but going to the game wasn't gonna
get that money back so why is it that

00:22:59.200 --> 00:22:59.210
get that money back so why is it that
 

00:22:59.210 --> 00:23:02.110
get that money back so why is it that
there was this temptation to feel like

00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:02.120
there was this temptation to feel like
 

00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:05.140
there was this temptation to feel like
we should go to the game if we had paid

00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:05.150
we should go to the game if we had paid
 

00:23:05.150 --> 00:23:09.970
we should go to the game if we had paid
for the tickets and this and many other

research so one lesson from these
 

00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:10.370
research so one lesson from these
stories is that there's a bunch of

00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:10.380
stories is that there's a bunch of
 

00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:14.390
stories is that there's a bunch of
things that economic theory tells us we

00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:14.400
things that economic theory tells us we
 

00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:17.330
things that economic theory tells us we
can leave out and in fact makes the

can leave out and in fact makes the
 

00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:20.000
can leave out and in fact makes the
strong prediction that they simply will

not matter I call these supposedly
 

00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:27.440
not matter I call these supposedly
irrelevant factors and really my

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:27.450
irrelevant factors and really my
 

00:25:27.450 --> 00:25:30.230

research can be summarized as there are

00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:30.240
research can be summarized as there are
 

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:32.480
research can be summarized as there are
a lot of these supposedly irrelevant

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:32.490
a lot of these supposedly irrelevant
 

00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:35.240
a lot of these supposedly irrelevant
factors that are not irrelevant they

factors that are not irrelevant they
 

00:25:35.250 --> 00:25:39.530
factors that are not irrelevant they
matter so I call these ifs supposedly

00:25:39.530 --> 00:25:39.540
matter so I call these ifs supposedly
 

00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:43.580
matter so I call these ifs supposedly
irrelevant factors so my three little

00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:43.590
irrelevant factors so my three little
 

00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:46.460

vernon smith's technique we assign
 

00:28:04.210 --> 00:28:08.640
vernon smith's technique we assign
values to people so we do that by saying

reason for that was that the people who

reason for that was that the people who
 

00:31:26.490 --> 00:31:30.170
reason for that was that the people who

00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:39.680
need to do and they don't have any
 

00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:43.289

now this is a new problem that humans

00:36:47.530 --> 00:36:47.540
now this is a new problem that humans

00:47:47.270 --> 00:47:47.280
week
 

00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:51.950
week
certainly maybe after the new year

00:47:51.950 --> 00:47:51.960
certainly maybe after the new year
 

00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:55.190
certainly maybe after the new year
the second is loss aversion that I've

00:47:55.190 --> 00:47:55.200
the second is loss aversion that I've
 

00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:57.320
the second is loss aversion that I've
previously mentioned people don't like

00:47:57.320 --> 00:47:57.330
previously mentioned people don't like
 

00:47:57.330 --> 00:48:01.550
previously mentioned people don't like
to see their income go down so we wanted

00:48:01.550 --> 00:48:01.560
to see their income go down so we wanted
 

00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:03.670
to see their income go down so we wanted
to take that into consideration and then

00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:03.680
to take that into consideration and then
 

00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:07.810
to take that into consideration and then
inertia people are good at doing nothing

00:48:07.810 --> 00:48:07.820
inertia people are good at doing nothing
 

00:48:07.820 --> 00:48:12.230
inertia people are good at doing nothing
so our idea was we know these things are

00:48:12.230 --> 00:48:12.240
so our idea was we know these things are
 

00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:15.230
so our idea was we know these things are
preventing people from saving let's flip

00:48:15.230 --> 00:48:15.240
preventing people from saving let's flip
 

00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:18.170
preventing people from saving let's flip
the problem around and use those to

00:48:18.170 --> 00:48:18.180
the problem around and use those to
 

00:48:18.180 --> 00:48:23.920
the problem around and use those to
create a plan that will take those

00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:23.930
create a plan that will take those
 

00:48:23.930 --> 00:48:26.240
create a plan that will take those
weaknesses if you want to call it that

00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:26.250
weaknesses if you want to call it that
 

00:48:26.250 --> 00:48:35.510
weaknesses if you want to call it that
and use them to help so the plan we

00:48:35.510 --> 00:48:35.520
and use them to help so the plan we
 

00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:38.950
and use them to help so the plan we
created we called save more tomorrow and

00:48:38.950 --> 00:48:38.960
created we called save more tomorrow and
 

00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:42.800
created we called save more tomorrow and
the basic idea was to invite people now

00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:42.810
the basic idea was to invite people now
 

00:48:42.810 --> 00:48:47.380
the basic idea was to invite people now
to save more later because

00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:47.390
to save more later because
 

00:48:47.390 --> 00:48:49.720
to save more later because
self-control is easier for later it's

00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:49.730
self-control is easier for later it's
 

00:48:49.730 --> 00:48:51.730
self-control is easier for later it's
like the our diet plan that will start

00:48:51.730 --> 00:48:51.740
like the our diet plan that will start
 

00:48:51.740 --> 00:48:57.069
like the our diet plan that will start
in January and particularly to invite

00:48:57.069 --> 00:48:57.079
in January and particularly to invite
 

00:48:57.079 --> 00:48:59.710
in January and particularly to invite
them to save more when they get their

00:48:59.710 --> 00:48:59.720
them to save more when they get their
 

00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:02.289
them to save more when they get their
next raise so they won't see their

00:49:02.289 --> 00:49:02.299
next raise so they won't see their
 

00:49:02.299 --> 00:49:05.109
next raise so they won't see their
income go down that will eliminate the

00:49:05.109 --> 00:49:05.119
income go down that will eliminate the
 

00:49:05.119 --> 00:49:08.319
income go down that will eliminate the
loss aversion and then we're gonna keep

00:49:08.319 --> 00:49:08.329
loss aversion and then we're gonna keep
 

00:49:08.329 --> 00:49:13.240
loss aversion and then we're gonna keep
that up until they hit some goal so

00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:13.250
that up until they hit some goal so
 

00:49:13.250 --> 00:49:18.579
that up until they hit some goal so
we'll get inertia working for us so we

00:49:18.579 --> 00:49:18.589
we'll get inertia working for us so we
 

00:49:18.589 --> 00:49:21.250
we'll get inertia working for us so we
spent years trying to get any company to

00:49:21.250 --> 00:49:21.260
spent years trying to get any company to
 

00:49:21.260 --> 00:49:23.980
spent years trying to get any company to
try this and we finally found one in

00:49:23.980 --> 00:49:23.990
try this and we finally found one in
 

00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:27.130
try this and we finally found one in
Chicago and in this particular

00:49:27.130 --> 00:49:27.140
Chicago and in this particular
 

00:49:27.140 --> 00:49:30.339
Chicago and in this particular
implementation the company was a small

00:49:30.339 --> 00:49:30.349
implementation the company was a small
 

00:49:30.349 --> 00:49:32.829
implementation the company was a small
company they hired a financial advisor

00:49:32.829 --> 00:49:32.839
company they hired a financial advisor
 

00:49:32.839 --> 00:49:36.579
company they hired a financial advisor
and offered his services to any employee

00:49:36.579 --> 00:49:36.589
and offered his services to any employee
 

00:49:36.589 --> 00:49:42.400
and offered his services to any employee
it was about 300 employees and for most

00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:42.410
it was about 300 employees and for most
 

00:49:42.410 --> 00:49:47.349
it was about 300 employees and for most
of them he the advisor said we think you

00:49:47.349 --> 00:49:47.359
of them he the advisor said we think you
 

00:49:47.359 --> 00:49:50.019
of them he the advisor said we think you
should save at least five percentage

00:49:50.019 --> 00:49:50.029
should save at least five percentage
 

00:49:50.029 --> 00:49:52.749
should save at least five percentage
points more and most of the employees

00:49:52.749 --> 00:49:52.759
points more and most of the employees
 

00:49:52.759 --> 00:49:55.329
points more and most of the employees
said that you're nuts I can't afford

00:49:55.329 --> 00:49:55.339
said that you're nuts I can't afford
 

00:49:55.339 --> 00:49:59.589
said that you're nuts I can't afford
that so then and only then were they

00:49:59.589 --> 00:49:59.599
that so then and only then were they
 

00:49:59.599 --> 00:50:04.210
that so then and only then were they
offered the same or tomorrow plan and it

00:50:04.210 --> 00:50:04.220
offered the same or tomorrow plan and it
 

00:50:04.220 --> 00:50:08.019
offered the same or tomorrow plan and it
was a quite an aggressive one they're

00:50:08.019 --> 00:50:08.029
was a quite an aggressive one they're
 

00:50:08.029 --> 00:50:11.349
was a quite an aggressive one they're
saving was increased by three percentage

00:50:11.349 --> 00:50:11.359
saving was increased by three percentage
 

00:50:11.359 --> 00:50:15.599
saving was increased by three percentage
points every time they got a raise so

00:50:15.599 --> 00:50:15.609
points every time they got a raise so
 

00:50:15.609 --> 00:50:20.980
points every time they got a raise so
notice this is all a SIF right with life

00:50:20.980 --> 00:50:20.990
notice this is all a SIF right with life
 

00:50:20.990 --> 00:50:23.680
notice this is all a SIF right with life
cycle savers a they would have no

00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:23.690
cycle savers a they would have no
 

00:50:23.690 --> 00:50:25.870

interest in joining save more tomorrow

00:50:25.870 --> 00:50:25.880
interest in joining save more tomorrow
 

00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:27.849
interest in joining save more tomorrow
because they're already saving the right

00:50:27.849 --> 00:50:27.859
because they're already saving the right
 

00:50:27.859 --> 00:50:31.870
because they're already saving the right
amount and if it was put in they would

00:50:31.870 --> 00:50:31.880
amount and if it was put in they would
 

00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:35.740
amount and if it was put in they would
undo it because they are already saving

00:50:35.740 --> 00:50:35.750
undo it because they are already saving
 

00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:40.390
undo it because they are already saving
the right amount so so it shouldn't work

00:50:40.390 --> 00:50:40.400
the right amount so so it shouldn't work
 

00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:44.079
the right amount so so it shouldn't work
a no one should join and be their

advisor and you can see
 

00:50:58.850 --> 00:51:02.260
advisor and you can see
the inertia in this system these numbers

00:51:02.260 --> 00:51:02.270
the inertia in this system these numbers
 

00:51:02.270 --> 00:51:05.140
the inertia in this system these numbers
fluctuate a little it's not that anyone

00:51:05.140 --> 00:51:05.150
fluctuate a little it's not that anyone

the advice to go up by five percentage
 

00:51:21.050 --> 00:51:24.700
the advice to go up by five percentage
points you can see they did that and

00:51:24.700 --> 00:51:24.710
points you can see they did that and
 

00:51:24.710 --> 00:51:30.210
points you can see they did that and
then stopped then here are our guys and

00:51:30.210 --> 00:51:30.220
then stopped then here are our guys and
 

00:51:30.220 --> 00:51:35.230
then stopped then here are our guys and
you can see we almost quadrupled saving

00:51:35.230 --> 00:51:35.240
you can see we almost quadrupled saving
 

00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:38.980

we were asked at hundreds of workshops

we were asked at hundreds of workshops

yes but maybe you get them to save more

00:51:54.670 --> 00:51:54.680
yes but maybe you get them to save more
 

00:51:54.680 --> 00:51:58.150
yes but maybe you get them to save more
over here but then they're undoing it

for thirty years or so I was trying to

00:52:06.550 --> 00:52:06.560
for thirty years or so I was trying to
 

00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:11.710
for thirty years or so I was trying to
figure out how to test and possibly

00:52:11.710 --> 00:52:11.720
figure out how to test and possibly
 

00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:16.450
figure out how to test and possibly
reject this alternative hypothesis I

00:52:16.450 --> 00:52:16.460
reject this alternative hypothesis I
 

00:52:16.460 --> 00:52:18.640
reject this alternative hypothesis I
never could find the data that would

00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:18.650
never could find the data that would
 

00:52:18.650 --> 00:52:20.820
never could find the data that would
allow me to do that

00:52:20.820 --> 00:52:20.830
allow me to do that
 

00:52:20.830 --> 00:52:25.390
allow me to do that
fortunately in Scandinavia there are no

and so the great young economist

00:52:31.390 --> 00:52:31.400
and so the great young economist
 

00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:34.600

rush Shetty and some colleagues were

00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:34.610
rush Shetty and some colleagues were
 

00:52:34.610 --> 00:52:37.150
rush Shetty and some colleagues were
able to test this hypothesis in nearby

00:52:37.150 --> 00:52:37.160
able to test this hypothesis in nearby
 

00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:42.490
able to test this hypothesis in nearby
Denmark and here's essentially what they

00:52:42.490 --> 00:52:42.500
Denmark and here's essentially what they
 

00:52:42.500 --> 00:52:44.980
Denmark and here's essentially what they
did they looked at people who switched

00:52:44.980 --> 00:52:44.990
did they looked at people who switched
 

00:52:44.990 --> 00:52:49.300
did they looked at people who switched
jobs where their pension contributions

00:52:49.300 --> 00:52:49.310
jobs where their pension contributions
 

00:52:49.310 --> 00:52:52.330
jobs where their pension contributions
went up by at least three percentage

00:52:52.330 --> 00:52:52.340
went up by at least three percentage
 

00:52:52.340 --> 00:52:55.540
went up by at least three percentage
points and you can see what happens to

00:52:55.540 --> 00:52:55.550
points and you can see what happens to
 

00:52:55.550 --> 00:52:58.360
points and you can see what happens to
their pension saving it goes up and they

00:52:58.360 --> 00:52:58.370
their pension saving it goes up and they
 

00:52:58.370 --> 00:53:02.130
their pension saving it goes up and they
write so this is people being passive

00:53:02.130 --> 00:53:02.140
write so this is people being passive
 

00:53:02.140 --> 00:53:05.530
write so this is people being passive
the way we've seen in the other things

00:53:05.530 --> 00:53:05.540
the way we've seen in the other things
 

00:53:05.540 --> 00:53:09.070
the way we've seen in the other things
I've shown you so far but what are they

00:53:09.070 --> 00:53:09.080
I've shown you so far but what are they
 

00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:11.970
I've shown you so far but what are they
doing in their other behavior

00:53:11.970 --> 00:53:11.980
doing in their other behavior
 

00:53:11.980 --> 00:53:15.640
doing in their other behavior
here's their company pensions nothing

00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:15.650
here's their company pensions nothing
 

00:53:15.650 --> 00:53:22.120
here's their company pensions nothing
here's their other saving nothing so no

here's their other saving nothing so no
 

00:53:22.130 --> 00:53:25.980
here's their other saving nothing so no
we're not stealing from some other pot

00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:25.990
we're not stealing from some other pot
 

00:53:25.990 --> 00:53:32.430

allowed to take it later until 2008 then
they changed that rule but so one of the

01:00:20.050 --> 01:00:20.060
they changed that rule but so one of the
 

01:00:20.060 --> 01:00:22.750
they changed that rule but so one of the
question is those guys who were nudged

01:00:22.750 --> 01:00:22.760
question is those guys who were nudged
 

01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:27.400
question is those guys who were nudged
to be individualistic did they stay that

01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:27.410
to be individualistic did they stay that
 

01:00:27.410 --> 01:00:30.730
to be individualistic did they stay that
way and if so that would be interesting

01:00:30.730 --> 01:00:30.740
way and if so that would be interesting
 

01:00:30.740 --> 01:00:33.640
way and if so that would be interesting
because almost no one has chosen to do

01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:33.650
because almost no one has chosen to do
 

01:00:33.650 --> 01:00:40.930
because almost no one has chosen to do
that since so 27 percent of the people

01:00:40.930 --> 01:00:40.940
that since so 27 percent of the people
 

01:00:40.940 --> 01:00:44.050
that since so 27 percent of the people
in the default fund have left and

01:00:44.050 --> 01:00:44.060
in the default fund have left and
 

01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:48.490
in the default fund have left and
decided to become do-it-yourselfers but

01:00:48.490 --> 01:00:48.500
decided to become do-it-yourselfers but
 

01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:53.800
decided to become do-it-yourselfers but
essentially no one that started as into

01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:53.810
essentially no one that started as into
 

01:00:53.810 --> 01:00:57.550
essentially no one that started as into
it yourselfer has switched their so this

01:00:57.550 --> 01:00:57.560
it yourselfer has switched their so this
 

01:00:57.560 --> 01:01:02.790
it yourselfer has switched their so this
nudge has lasted more or less forever

01:01:02.790 --> 01:01:02.800
nudge has lasted more or less forever
 

01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:06.370
nudge has lasted more or less forever
and that's in spite of the fact that the

01:01:06.370 --> 01:01:06.380
and that's in spite of the fact that the
 

01:01:06.380 --> 01:01:11.950
and that's in spite of the fact that the
default fund has had drastic changes so

01:01:11.950 --> 01:01:11.960
default fund has had drastic changes so
 

01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:19.000
default fund has had drastic changes so
in 2010 the managers of the fund decided

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:19.010
in 2010 the managers of the fund decided
 

01:01:19.010 --> 01:01:24.280
in 2010 the managers of the fund decided
they wanted to juice the returns well

01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:24.290
they wanted to juice the returns well
 

01:01:24.290 --> 01:01:27.670
they wanted to juice the returns well
hopefully so they decided to add

01:01:27.670 --> 01:01:27.680
hopefully so they decided to add
 

01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:30.270
hopefully so they decided to add
leverage you know what does that mean

01:01:30.270 --> 01:01:30.280
leverage you know what does that mean
 

01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:32.860
leverage you know what does that mean
technically they were borrowing and

01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:32.870
technically they were borrowing and
 

01:01:32.870 --> 01:01:38.410
technically they were borrowing and
buying options but the details of that

01:01:38.410 --> 01:01:38.420
buying options but the details of that
 

01:01:38.420 --> 01:01:42.700
buying options but the details of that
are not important you they initially had

01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:42.710
are not important you they initially had
 

01:01:42.710 --> 01:01:44.200
are not important you they initially had
a hundred and twenty five percent

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:44.210
a hundred and twenty five percent
 

01:01:44.210 --> 01:01:45.910
a hundred and twenty five percent
leverage meaning

01:01:45.910 --> 01:01:45.920
leverage meaning
 

01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:50.890
leverage meaning
that if the market went up 10% the fund

01:01:50.890 --> 01:01:50.900
that if the market went up 10% the fund
 

01:01:50.900 --> 01:01:54.370
that if the market went up 10% the fund
would go up 12 then they switched a 50%

01:01:54.370 --> 01:01:54.380
would go up 12 then they switched a 50%
 

01:01:54.380 --> 01:01:59.829
would go up 12 then they switched a 50%
leverage so 50% leveraged means that if

01:01:59.829 --> 01:01:59.839
leverage so 50% leveraged means that if
 

01:01:59.839 --> 01:02:03.339
leverage so 50% leveraged means that if
the market goes up 10% you go up 15% but

01:02:03.339 --> 01:02:03.349
the market goes up 10% you go up 15% but
 

01:02:03.349 --> 01:02:07.480
the market goes up 10% you go up 15% but
if the market Falls 10% of the fund

01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:07.490
if the market Falls 10% of the fund
 

01:02:07.490 --> 01:02:12.309
if the market Falls 10% of the fund
Falls 15% now in hindsight these guys

01:02:12.309 --> 01:02:12.319
Falls 15% now in hindsight these guys
 

01:02:12.319 --> 01:02:15.730
Falls 15% now in hindsight these guys
look like geniuses since the market has

01:02:15.730 --> 01:02:15.740
look like geniuses since the market has
 

01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:17.890
look like geniuses since the market has
pretty much steadily gone up since they

01:02:17.890 --> 01:02:17.900
pretty much steadily gone up since they
 

01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:22.480
pretty much steadily gone up since they
took these but we can ask what would

01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:22.490
took these but we can ask what would
 

01:02:22.490 --> 01:02:24.160
took these but we can ask what would
happen if we had another financial

01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:24.170
happen if we had another financial
 

01:02:24.170 --> 01:02:29.349
happen if we had another financial
crisis so what would this fund have done

01:02:29.349 --> 01:02:29.359
crisis so what would this fund have done
 

01:02:29.359 --> 01:02:34.690
crisis so what would this fund have done
in the period 2006 to 2008 the answer is

01:02:34.690 --> 01:02:34.700
in the period 2006 to 2008 the answer is
 

01:02:34.700 --> 01:02:42.130
in the period 2006 to 2008 the answer is
down 82% so you know this is a pretty

01:02:42.130 --> 01:02:42.140
down 82% so you know this is a pretty
 

01:02:42.140 --> 01:02:46.630
down 82% so you know this is a pretty
big change and so a question that Frank

01:02:46.630 --> 01:02:46.640
big change and so a question that Frank
 

01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:52.829
big change and so a question that Frank
and Henrik and I have been exploring is

01:02:52.829 --> 01:02:52.839
 

01:02:52.839 --> 01:03:00.910
did anybody notice this so by the way

01:03:00.910 --> 01:03:00.920
did anybody notice this so by the way
 

01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:04.750
did anybody notice this so by the way
there are now 900 funds because 450

01:03:04.750 --> 01:03:04.760
there are now 900 funds because 450
 

01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:11.760
there are now 900 funds because 450
really wouldn't do so and one of those

01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:11.770
really wouldn't do so and one of those
 

01:03:11.770 --> 01:03:17.650
really wouldn't do so and one of those
900 funds is identical to the default

01:03:17.650 --> 01:03:17.660
900 funds is identical to the default
 

01:03:17.660 --> 01:03:21.789
900 funds is identical to the default
fund but has no leverage so it was

01:03:21.789 --> 01:03:21.799
fund but has no leverage so it was
 

01:03:21.799 --> 01:03:25.150
fund but has no leverage so it was
possible if you liked the thing you were

01:03:25.150 --> 01:03:25.160
possible if you liked the thing you were
 

01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:30.520
possible if you liked the thing you were
in and these guys in the room and I know

01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:30.530
in and these guys in the room and I know
 

01:03:30.530 --> 01:03:33.670
in and these guys in the room and I know
who you are who claim they picked the

01:03:33.670 --> 01:03:33.680
who you are who claim they picked the
 

01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:36.660
who you are who claim they picked the
default fund by choice in their wisdom

01:03:36.660 --> 01:03:36.670
default fund by choice in their wisdom
 

01:03:36.670 --> 01:03:42.730
default fund by choice in their wisdom
I'm looking at you pear presumably they

01:03:42.730 --> 01:03:42.740
I'm looking at you pear presumably they
 

01:03:42.740 --> 01:03:47.470
I'm looking at you pear presumably they
were picking an unlevered fund and you

01:03:47.470 --> 01:03:47.480
were picking an unlevered fund and you
 

01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:51.549
were picking an unlevered fund and you
know might have noticed that Jesus thing

01:03:51.549 --> 01:03:51.559
know might have noticed that Jesus thing
 

01:03:51.559 --> 01:03:55.390
know might have noticed that Jesus thing
has gotten a lot of risk maybe I should

01:03:55.390 --> 01:03:55.400
has gotten a lot of risk maybe I should
 

01:03:55.400 --> 01:03:58.120
has gotten a lot of risk maybe I should
switch into this other fund that's just

01:03:58.120 --> 01:03:58.130
switch into this other fund that's just
 

01:03:58.130 --> 01:03:59.259
switch into this other fund that's just
like the one I

01:03:59.259 --> 01:03:59.269
like the one I
 

01:03:59.269 --> 01:04:06.159
like the one I
allegedly actively picked so did anyone

01:04:06.159 --> 01:04:06.169
allegedly actively picked so did anyone
 

01:04:06.169 --> 01:04:10.269
allegedly actively picked so did anyone
notice so here's a plot of the leverage

01:04:10.269 --> 01:04:10.279
notice so here's a plot of the leverage
 

01:04:10.279 --> 01:04:17.679
notice so here's a plot of the leverage
over time this is the number of people

01:04:17.679 --> 01:04:17.689
over time this is the number of people
 

01:04:17.689 --> 01:04:23.349
over time this is the number of people
that were leaving the default fund I

01:04:23.349 --> 01:04:23.359
that were leaving the default fund I
 

01:04:23.359 --> 01:04:25.389
that were leaving the default fund I
don't know whether you can read those

01:04:25.389 --> 01:04:25.399
don't know whether you can read those
 

01:04:25.399 --> 01:04:30.959
don't know whether you can read those
numbers the the scale goes from 0 to 400

01:04:30.959 --> 01:04:30.969
numbers the the scale goes from 0 to 400
 

01:04:30.969 --> 01:04:34.979
numbers the the scale goes from 0 to 400
maybe up to 600 there are 3 million

01:04:34.979 --> 01:04:34.989
maybe up to 600 there are 3 million
 

01:04:34.989 --> 01:04:39.699
maybe up to 600 there are 3 million
investors in this fund so our conclusion

01:04:39.699 --> 01:04:39.709
investors in this fund so our conclusion
 

01:04:39.709 --> 01:04:43.809
investors in this fund so our conclusion
is we cannot reject the hypothesis that

01:04:43.809 --> 01:04:43.819
is we cannot reject the hypothesis that
 

01:04:43.819 --> 01:04:48.389
is we cannot reject the hypothesis that
3 million Swedish investors are asleep

01:04:48.389 --> 01:04:48.399
3 million Swedish investors are asleep
 

01:04:48.399 --> 01:04:51.880
3 million Swedish investors are asleep
they may be asleep we cannot rule that

01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:51.890
they may be asleep we cannot rule that
 

01:04:51.890 --> 01:04:56.979
they may be asleep we cannot rule that
out they certainly are not deserting the

01:04:56.979 --> 01:04:56.989
out they certainly are not deserting the
 

01:04:56.989 --> 01:05:02.829
out they certainly are not deserting the
fund in droves so what can we conclude

01:05:02.829 --> 01:05:02.839
fund in droves so what can we conclude
 

01:05:02.839 --> 01:05:05.259
fund in droves so what can we conclude
from this

01:05:05.259 --> 01:05:05.269
from this
 

01:05:05.269 --> 01:05:07.959
from this
the first is nudges can be quite

01:05:07.959 --> 01:05:07.969
the first is nudges can be quite
 

01:05:07.969 --> 01:05:08.859
the first is nudges can be quite
powerful

01:05:08.859 --> 01:05:08.869
powerful
 

01:05:08.869 --> 01:05:12.549
powerful
both the nudge of creating a default

01:05:12.549 --> 01:05:12.559
both the nudge of creating a default
 

01:05:12.559 --> 01:05:15.519
both the nudge of creating a default
which has recently been all powerful and

01:05:15.519 --> 01:05:15.529
which has recently been all powerful and
 

01:05:15.529 --> 01:05:19.239
which has recently been all powerful and
the earlier nudge saying please don't

01:05:19.239 --> 01:05:19.249
the earlier nudge saying please don't
 

01:05:19.249 --> 01:05:22.299
the earlier nudge saying please don't
take the default that was also very

01:05:22.299 --> 01:05:22.309
take the default that was also very
 

01:05:22.309 --> 01:05:26.259
take the default that was also very
powerful second and this we've never

01:05:26.259 --> 01:05:26.269
powerful second and this we've never
 

01:05:26.269 --> 01:05:28.359
powerful second and this we've never
been able to test before Thank You

01:05:28.359 --> 01:05:28.369
been able to test before Thank You
 

01:05:28.369 --> 01:05:32.349
been able to test before Thank You
Sweden for giving us this opportunity we

01:05:32.349 --> 01:05:32.359
Sweden for giving us this opportunity we
 

01:05:32.359 --> 01:05:35.889
Sweden for giving us this opportunity we
now know nudges can last at least 17

01:05:35.889 --> 01:05:35.899
now know nudges can last at least 17
 

01:05:35.899 --> 01:05:41.439
now know nudges can last at least 17
years possibly longer and it's

01:05:41.439 --> 01:05:41.449
years possibly longer and it's
 

01:05:41.449 --> 01:05:43.749
years possibly longer and it's
suggesting a new marketing campaign for

01:05:43.749 --> 01:05:43.759
suggesting a new marketing campaign for
 

01:05:43.759 --> 01:05:52.170
suggesting a new marketing campaign for
our nudging efforts

01:05:52.170 --> 01:05:52.180
 

01:05:52.180 --> 01:06:00.220
so let me conclude it is possible many

01:06:00.220 --> 01:06:00.230
so let me conclude it is possible many
 

01:06:00.230 --> 01:06:02.710
so let me conclude it is possible many
people told me early on it's just not

01:06:02.710 --> 01:06:02.720
people told me early on it's just not
 

01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:04.930
people told me early on it's just not
possible to do economics any other way

01:06:04.930 --> 01:06:04.940
possible to do economics any other way
 

01:06:04.940 --> 01:06:07.390
possible to do economics any other way
it wouldn't be economics so that's not

01:06:07.390 --> 01:06:07.400
it wouldn't be economics so that's not
 

01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:12.450
it wouldn't be economics so that's not
true it's possible to do economics

01:06:12.450 --> 01:06:12.460
 

01:06:12.460 --> 01:06:21.190
without homo economics sorry second if

01:06:21.190 --> 01:06:21.200
without homo economics sorry second if
 

01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:27.390
without homo economics sorry second if
we learn from other social scientists we

01:06:27.390 --> 01:06:27.400
we learn from other social scientists we
 

01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:33.130
we learn from other social scientists we
can improve economics we can increase

01:06:33.130 --> 01:06:33.140
can improve economics we can increase
 

01:06:33.140 --> 01:06:37.240
can improve economics we can increase
its explanatory power and it can give us

01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:37.250
its explanatory power and it can give us
 

01:06:37.250 --> 01:06:40.750
its explanatory power and it can give us
all kinds of new tools that we can use

01:06:40.750 --> 01:06:40.760
all kinds of new tools that we can use
 

01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:50.170
all kinds of new tools that we can use
to improve people's outcomes so in short

01:06:50.170 --> 01:06:50.180
to improve people's outcomes so in short
 

01:06:50.180 --> 01:07:01.210
