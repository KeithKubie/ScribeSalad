00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.320
So, we've transported you into an MDP,
or

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:04.800
actually we didn't transport
you into anything.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.020
We're giving you the ability to interact
with an MDP, and here's the MDP.

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:12.510
Now, remember I said the MDP,
the environment has states and actions.

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.240
Now, the states in this case, are
going to be visualized to you in terms

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.040
of this sort of Mondrian looking
picture in the middle of the screen.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.470
&gt;&gt; Mondrian?

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:21.480
I'm going to go with that.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.640
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; And it's like colors and

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:24.820
squares and things.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.340
And the actions are the numbers
one through six.

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.780
And unlike in a regular video game,
you don't know the rules.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.260
You don't really know how things work.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.450
You don't even know what it is you're
trying to do, but what you can do is

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.820
start playing and use that experience
to start figuring out how things work.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:41.978
&gt;&gt; Okay, so it's just like grad school.

00:00:41.978 --> 00:00:44.727
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Maybe.

00:00:44.727 --> 00:00:49.750
All right, so you have to now choose
actions, and I'll enter them into

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.650
the MDP and we'll see what happens and
then you can see if you can win or not.

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:54.890
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Get my reward.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.760
&gt;&gt; Three.

00:00:58.928 --> 00:01:01.646
Three.

00:01:01.646 --> 00:01:03.920
&gt;&gt; I did it.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:04.560
Just nothing changed.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.010
&gt;&gt; Five.
&gt;&gt; I did it.

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.660
Nothing changed.

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:09.230
&gt;&gt; Six?

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:12.810
I'm back where I was.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.090
&gt;&gt; That's true.

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.798
&gt;&gt; One.

00:01:14.798 --> 00:01:16.320
&gt;&gt; Nothing changed.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.298
&gt;&gt; Two.

00:01:19.836 --> 00:01:20.790
&gt;&gt; Three.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:21.710
&gt;&gt; That's a new state.

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:22.400
&gt;&gt; It is a new state.

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.150
&gt;&gt; Three.
&gt;&gt; Oh, so I figured something out then.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.770
&gt;&gt; Do you want to tell me what it is?

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.760
&gt;&gt; No, because I forgot what I
did [LAUGH] three steps back.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:32.260
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.810
&gt;&gt; I've decided that three
means move to the right.

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:35.340
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.030
&gt;&gt; And something moves down, but
I can't remember what I said.

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.450
I want to say it was two, but
I guess I could try that.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:42.430
Two.

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.100
Yes.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.007
Now I need to figure out
how to go back up again.

00:01:46.007 --> 00:01:46.842
One?

00:01:46.842 --> 00:01:47.813
&gt;&gt; Nothing happened.

00:01:47.813 --> 00:01:48.516
&gt;&gt; Four?

00:01:50.443 --> 00:01:51.344
Four?

00:01:52.475 --> 00:01:56.054
Four, Five.

00:01:56.054 --> 00:01:56.679
&gt;&gt; Nothing happened.

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:58.490
&gt;&gt; Six.

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.460
So I think that's
visually very attractive.

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.520
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.110
&gt;&gt; Yeah, cool.

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.014
So I think my actions mostly
moved the orange square around.

00:02:08.014 --> 00:02:11.042
And now I just need to know what
[LAUGH] it's trying to accomplish.

00:02:11.042 --> 00:02:15.319
How about two, two,

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.123
two, two, five.

00:02:19.123 --> 00:02:19.961
&gt;&gt; Nothing happened.

00:02:19.961 --> 00:02:20.799
&gt;&gt; Six.

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:21.366
&gt;&gt; Nothing happened.

00:02:21.366 --> 00:02:26.898
&gt;&gt; Four, four, three,

00:02:26.898 --> 00:02:32.429
three, three, two,

00:02:32.429 --> 00:02:37.388
two, three, one.

00:02:37.388 --> 00:02:38.798
Nothing happened.

00:02:38.798 --> 00:02:40.756
&gt;&gt; Four.

00:02:40.756 --> 00:02:42.437
Four.

00:02:42.437 --> 00:02:43.932
Four.

00:02:43.932 --> 00:02:45.040
Four.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.030
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.630
So you seem to have at
least gotten the feel for

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.230
the idea that there's four directional
actions for the orange square.

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.730
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.410
&gt;&gt; In fact maybe we should actually
notate them just to make it a little bit

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:57.610
easier to hold in your head.

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:58.590
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.540
&gt;&gt; But you do notice that there are some
actions that you haven't quite gotten to

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:02.820
do anything yet.

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.853
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and now that I don't
have to remember what they are.

00:03:05.853 --> 00:03:07.449
I mean sure two, three, four and

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:11.540
six math exactly as you would expect
them two, two, down, right, up and left.

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.660
But I was having a hard time
keeping them in my head.

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.212
So let's try six.

00:03:17.212 --> 00:03:21.796
Six, two, two,

00:03:21.796 --> 00:03:26.685
six, six, four,

00:03:26.685 --> 00:03:30.052
four, one.

00:03:30.052 --> 00:03:31.734
&gt;&gt; Nothing happened.

00:03:31.734 --> 00:03:36.740
&gt;&gt; Three, six, five.

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.120
The little yellow circle thing.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.394
&gt;&gt; Or green.
Green is good.

00:03:43.394 --> 00:03:46.855
&gt;&gt; Okay,
the green little circle thing shrunk.

00:03:46.855 --> 00:03:49.843
Oh, three.

00:03:49.843 --> 00:03:51.097
Oh, that's interesting.

00:03:51.097 --> 00:03:56.602
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Two, two, three,

00:03:56.602 --> 00:04:04.194
three, three, four, four.

00:04:04.194 --> 00:04:05.840
I should do something now.

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:06.340
One.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.250
&gt;&gt; Success.

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:10.330
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:11.300
I get it.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.480
I think I even understand
what the game is.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.029
&gt;&gt; Okay, let's show you the game
again and maybe you can explain it.
