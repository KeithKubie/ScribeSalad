00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.910
There may be two ways
to receive your grades.

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:03.840
On the Assignments page,

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.620
once you have received your grade, this
column will be updated to say, Returned.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.180
Click the assignment name and
you will see your grade at the top.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.239
Then scroll down to see your feedback.

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:18.800
Depending on the assignment,

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.150
you might receive some attachments
associated with your feedback.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.260
Some classes might have
the Gradebook function,

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.490
where you will see all of
your grades for the class.

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.800
Not every class uses this Gradebook.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.810
Different classes return
grades in different ways.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.110
Make sure to pay attention,

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.480
specifically, to how your class
will return grades to you.
