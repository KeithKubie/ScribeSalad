1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,590
It's so populated and it's
also like, so, um, it's so la,

2
00:00:04,591 --> 00:00:05,670
it's so Beverly hills.

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,110
I lived there for 13 years of generic.
Yeah.

4
00:00:08,111 --> 00:00:11,380
There was a wave there that Laird was
having a love affair with for many years.

5
00:00:11,381 --> 00:00:13,450
So we lived there, uh, with, you know,

6
00:00:13,451 --> 00:00:16,240
so he could be close to his
girlfriend for sure. It was strange.

7
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:19,870
It didn't know every boy
needs their girlfriend. Every
boy needs a wave. They do.

8
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:21,670
Well girl, you know, just something,

9
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:26,970
that's what I always think is kind of
natural is at least for my experience is

10
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:29,711
like,

11
00:00:29,711 --> 00:00:33,730
I don't know if he ever go through this
when you go home I'll let it all go out

12
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:35,800
and surf for many hours,

13
00:00:35,801 --> 00:00:39,430
like kicking off for five hours at a
time and if their surf and he comes home

14
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:44,200
and I see how happy he is, like to see
us, he loves us. He's like, oh my girls,

15
00:00:44,201 --> 00:00:48,040
you know. And then about, I dunno,
seven and a half, eight minutes in,

16
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:52,300
he starts to get this look
on his face like, oh yeah,

17
00:00:52,301 --> 00:00:55,660
I'm in the house with the family.
You know,

18
00:00:56,020 --> 00:01:00,280
I wanted to do a book years ago called
death by domestication because it's like

19
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:05,350
how does, how do, how does he manage
both of those sides? Like I need to go,

20
00:01:05,351 --> 00:01:08,470
I need to be free, I need to,
you know, chase things in,

21
00:01:08,471 --> 00:01:12,550
like scare myself and do all
this stuff and then, you know,

22
00:01:12,551 --> 00:01:16,630
comes home and it's like, you know,
on the floor laying, you know,

23
00:01:16,631 --> 00:01:17,860
with one of my daughters and,

24
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:20,680
and being attentive and a great
husband and all these things.

25
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:24,250
But I always get amused a little
bit by the push pole. Yeah.

26
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:26,250
Well especially I think with the

27
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:29,990
big wave surfer mindset,
like a type of person,

28
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:33,640
those are like some of the freest,
wildest humans on the planet.

29
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:38,670
It's a very unusual group of people that
rides giant waves of water on the top

30
00:01:39,881 --> 00:01:41,110
of the ocean.
I mean that's a,

31
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:45,850
that's a crazy thing to delta here
time to really stop and think about it.

32
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,510
Try not to think too much
about it cause I did marry him.

33
00:01:48,511 --> 00:01:53,280
But there is some stuff,
I mean, and, and weirdly,

34
00:01:53,281 --> 00:01:56,430
you know, he's been doing this
so long that you realize hit,

35
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:01,290
he's actually even more different than
some of the other guys because if you

36
00:02:01,291 --> 00:02:06,210
think about it, he sustained doing
this for right now, 40 years. Wow.

37
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,130
So he's a guy who
he has both.

38
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:14,430
So what he wants to do is write a huge
wave during the day and then be with his

39
00:02:14,431 --> 00:02:17,140
family at night. And sometimes, you
know, we'd take going, you know,

40
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,900
halfway around the globe or whatever.

41
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:24,410
And so I think the pursuit
and they have to wait a lot.

42
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:29,850
That's the other thing. These things don't
come around that often. Right. Um, it's,

43
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,080
it's very interesting to
live with because, um,

44
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:35,340
there's a,

45
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,490
there's a little bit of suffering that
goes on and sometimes later they'll say

46
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:41,040
to me, cause he's aware of
time going by, he'll be like,

47
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,680
you don't have a lot more waves. I
need to ride. And I'm like, I know,

48
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,660
like it's a pretty deep,
uh, calling. And now that,

49
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,490
I mean he's been boiling for 25 years,

50
00:02:50,491 --> 00:02:52,950
but now that they are getting
that equipment better,

51
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:56,790
it's sort of like now we can ride
places that we couldn't ride,

52
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:01,000
that we're not really attractive for
riding top of the surface of the water,

53
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:05,770
even if you towed it. So now it's
opened up a whole other pursuit for him.

54
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:10,090
Um, yeah, it's very, I don't know
why you would go towards that.

55
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:11,493
No,

56
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,290
like Laird has put me on a ski in front
of a way that's like 60 feet. Right.

57
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:19,070
And like being on the back
of a ski with him driving.

58
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,010
There's a moment where
you go, okay, I actually,

59
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,300
and I'm sure you've experienced
this with other friends that take,

60
00:03:24,301 --> 00:03:28,790
you may be on up flying or something.
He is, this is what he does, right?

61
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:33,500
So I'm like, okay, I trust him
more than I'm afraid. That's fine.

62
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:35,750
I can do that and I'm
going to surrender to that.

63
00:03:35,751 --> 00:03:38,690
I'm not going to torture myself the
whole time. I'm just going to trust him.

64
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,200
And you turn and there's a six story
building behind you moving and you just

65
00:03:44,551 --> 00:03:45,384
think

66
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,240
who would,

67
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:51,240
who like how has that fun y'all like
how is saying like I'm going to actively

68
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:57,410
ride that.
Um,

69
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:58,760
but now with the foils,

70
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:01,530
because they're actually catching the
energy below the surface of the water.

71
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:05,370
So foils, I'm not familiar. They
have these things called hydrofoils.

72
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,360
So originally there was a guy named Mike
Murphy who created something called the

73
00:04:09,361 --> 00:04:12,560
air chair and they were,
they'd been putting foils on skis,

74
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:15,120
water skis and different funky ways.

75
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:18,720
Like even in the 50s so Laird in
his friend's got an air chair,

76
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:23,750
cut the chair off and put
us snowboard boots bindings,

77
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:27,870
quick release. So you'd stand on
it. You're booted in and below.

78
00:04:27,871 --> 00:04:32,700
Is this basically a mini airplane
with a Strut? So for example,

79
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:36,090
yeah, there's a shot of one and
this is a smaller one. Jamie,

80
00:04:36,091 --> 00:04:38,750
do you have any ones of the big
with the boots? Yeah, I think this

81
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:44,010
people are using the old time memories.
Did you know what brothers? I seen him.

82
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:47,630
Wow. He knows about everything. What
are you talking about? He's plugged in,

83
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:50,960
plugged in, look at him.
Do you have a girlfriend?

84
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:55,010
Well, what happened to
this dude's head? Oh yeah.

85
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:57,270
So there's Laird on the left obviously.

86
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:00,830
So you see how either in
the boots and also he,

87
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:05,220
the reason he looks so puffy as he
has flotation underneath his wet suit.

88
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,110
So if you hit your head or what have you,

89
00:05:07,111 --> 00:05:12,000
but it's basically a miniature
airplane underneath the surface.

90
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:16,530
And if he gets into trouble, if they
wiped out, um, they have a quick release,

91
00:05:16,531 --> 00:05:20,280
but now they've gotten this
developed so that he can do it,

92
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:26,040
uh, without the boots because that adds
an element of danger that cause you're

93
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:31,020
strapped in, you're strapped in and
your strut is, you know, four feet long.

94
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:35,130
Uh, you know, that's so
strange looking. Yeah.

95
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:38,670
But it's what's going on below the
surface. So there's a miniature airplane.

96
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:41,190
Do you have, Jamie, do you have
any pictures of it flipped up?

97
00:05:41,191 --> 00:05:43,380
I'm sure if you look on Laird stuff,
you can see the bottom,

98
00:05:43,381 --> 00:05:46,800
it's like a miniature airplane
because water is denser than air.

99
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,310
So it sort of like a miniature plane.

100
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:54,120
And it is like the oracle guys that
do those boats do have made foils for

101
00:05:54,121 --> 00:05:56,470
layered. Um, it's, so that's
what it looks like. Yeah.

102
00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:00,860
So those are kind of more
a low performance ones.

103
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:05,300
When you see the high performance,
they, I mean, you know,

104
00:06:05,301 --> 00:06:08,360
it's aerodynamics,
hydrodynamics, it's all of that.

105
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:13,460
So now what you're doing is because
there's energy below the surface moving.

106
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:16,040
So we think of a wave
like pushing and dropping,

107
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:19,220
but there's actually the
energy circular energy below.

108
00:06:19,221 --> 00:06:21,590
So now you've got the foil that
can ride that, but you're not,

109
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,650
you don't have drag.
So like they can go,

110
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:29,630
there's a wave on Kauai
where they're going over, you
know, 50, they go about 50,

111
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:31,700
they can go up,
get up to 52 miles an hour.

112
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:37,670
So imagine if you did something, we'll,
you've dedicated yourself to martial arts.

113
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:41,360
It's like,
but then there's like a new way to do it.

114
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:44,780
And so he's been doing the
big stuff for 25 years,

115
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:48,300
but now they're getting any equipment,
right? That he can ride waves.

116
00:06:48,301 --> 00:06:52,970
That actually wouldn't be that great.
But now they're super fun. Oh Wow.

117
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,740
So he gets it, makes them excited and
he's still pursues it. And, uh, that's,

118
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:59,030
that's on Kauai right there.

119
00:06:59,031 --> 00:07:04,031
And see how it's not even breaking
where he rides it so it can correct.

120
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:08,900
And it's, it's actually riding the
energy below the surface, which,

121
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:14,060
you know, for him, he's just interested
in what's the most efficient way. I mean,

122
00:07:14,061 --> 00:07:18,140
look at that. You'd never
intrude in, um, regular surfing.

123
00:07:18,141 --> 00:07:19,560
Be able to,
um,

124
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:24,530
ride that so it enables them so much fun.

125
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:29,090
You're flying, that's what they say.
That's, it's the difference. Right?

126
00:07:29,091 --> 00:07:33,950
So they're flying. So that's, I think
keep kept him interested. But you know,

127
00:07:33,951 --> 00:07:37,460
his, his pursuit of this is, it's pretty,

128
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:42,680
it's pretty, it's a pretty
interesting relationship to watch.

129
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:46,970
I think it's important. I
mean, as a female, for me,

130
00:07:46,971 --> 00:07:51,350
I think playing volleyball
helped me understand like,
having a pursuit, you know,

131
00:07:51,351 --> 00:07:54,170
like something like I got to go do that.

132
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:58,340
And I think it's something about living
with a person who has a pursuit other

133
00:07:58,341 --> 00:08:03,200
than, um, like I need a
bigger war chest or whatever.

134
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,330
Right.
That's can be really cool.
