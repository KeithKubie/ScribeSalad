00:00:05.796 --> 00:00:07.420
DAVE GEFFON: Hi, everyone.

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:08.720
I'm Dave Geffon.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.820
Welcome to the
Google Developer Day

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.400
here at the Games
Developer Conference.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.560
Just a minute ago,
if you were here,

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.550
you saw Adam give a really great
talk with some great panelists

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.830
on the importance of launching
and the tools and tech

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.920
that Google Play gives to you
to actually launch successfully

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.427
on the platform.

00:00:26.427 --> 00:00:28.760
If you're a new developer,
you're an existing developer,

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.230
you know that launch
is really critical.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.530
And I think one of the
things that I always

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.390
hear from developers
from all walks of life

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.030
is, well, I've
nailed that launch.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.250
I've got all these installs.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.083
These people are playing
and loving my game.

00:00:41.083 --> 00:00:44.520
And I just really don't
quite know what to do next.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.900
And today I've actually
got a great panel here

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.960
of some really great
games industry leaders who

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.950
are doing some truly--

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:52.925
it's true.

00:00:52.925 --> 00:00:55.260
Don't be so-- these guys.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.310
They're doing some really
great, innovative things

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.220
in terms of building and growing
their communities in some kind

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.520
of nonconventional ways.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.721
So before we get
started, I'm not sure

00:01:04.721 --> 00:01:06.470
that everyone here
knows who you guys are.

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.387
So why don't we start
here with Christian.

00:01:08.387 --> 00:01:10.470
Tell us a little bit about
yourself, your company,

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.645
and what you guys are doing.

00:01:11.645 --> 00:01:12.200
KRISTIAN SEGERSTRALE: Sure.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.658
So my name is
Kristian Segerstrale.

00:01:13.658 --> 00:01:17.540
I'm the chief executive
of Super Evil Megacorp.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.280
I nearly said cheese there
instead of too, that too.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.960
But anyway, we are makers of
"Vainglory," the number one

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.600
mobile eSport today.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.830
So as a company, what we're
really focused on doing

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.663
is creating, for the
touchscreen generation,

00:01:29.663 --> 00:01:31.580
the kind of real
time, deep competitive

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.460
experiences that we grew
up with on PC ourselves.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.590
And that style of
gaming lends itself

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.119
very much to working with
the community as opposed

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.910
to focusing very much
on an upfront launch.

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.357
So we spend 90% of our
efforts really trying

00:01:43.357 --> 00:01:45.440
to figure out how to be a
better company everyday,

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.410
to how to make the
community happier everyday,

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.532
and can share some
learnings from that.

00:01:50.532 --> 00:01:52.760
ANDREW STALBOW: Hey,
I'm Andrew Stalbow.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.560
I'm a co-founder and
CEO at Seriously.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.870
We believe that
the next generation

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.700
of entertainment brands
get built on mobile first.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.260
And we're working
really hard to build out

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.320
our first property
called "Best Fiends"

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.540
into a big franchise that
feels like a Hollywood property

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.144
but starts its life
as a mobile app.

00:02:18.144 --> 00:02:19.300
ANDRES BOU: Hi everyone.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.340
I'm Andres Bou.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.160
I'm CEO and founder
of Social Point.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.580
We are a game developer
based in Barcelona,

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.980
so in the sunny Spain.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.440
And we are mainly known
by "Dragon City," "Monster

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.460
Legends."

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.620
Both titles were
launched in mobile

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.186
more than three years ago.

00:02:36.186 --> 00:02:37.560
And that's why we
are here today,

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.470
now to talk about how to make
that games can sustain there

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:44.995
for a long period of time.

00:02:44.995 --> 00:02:45.870
DAVE GEFFON: Awesome.

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.020
So you guys are clearly
running and developing

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.810
games that are very
successful on Google Play.

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.020
What was that moment where
you're leading this business

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.270
and you realize, hey,
we need to do something

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.160
different to resonate
with our audience

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.810
and to grow our audience?

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.659
What was that moment
for you, Kristian?

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:04.200
KRISTIAN SEGERSTRALE:
Yeah, so for us

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.480
it was actually very much
right at the very beginning

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.360
because we went out with
a gaming proposition that

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.240
was fundamentally different to
anything that was out there.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.370
Instead of aiming for
that proverbial bus stop

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.260
moment of two or three
minutes of fun, which

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.090
was very much the
market a few years ago,

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.810
we went out wanting to create a
gaming experience where people

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.240
could play all night
long with their friends,

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.970
just like we did
growing up on PC.

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.790
So by coming up with a
gaming experience that

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.370
is where the file size
is sort of 700 megabytes

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.632
plus in terms of the shared
commitment to the download,

00:03:35.632 --> 00:03:37.590
as well as the fact that
when you start a game,

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.350
you're expected to play that
game for 20 to 25 minutes,

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.012
or in fact if you
get out early, we

00:03:42.012 --> 00:03:43.470
will have to punish
you because you

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.011
ruin the experience
for everyone else

00:03:45.011 --> 00:03:48.630
in that match, that to us was a
very clear fundamental starting

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.080
point that there's no way that
we can go ahead and try to run

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.580
a big campaign,
get lots of people

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.380
into this, because
it fundamentally

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.130
requires a different mindset.

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.240
It is almost like growing a
different type of culture.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.230
This style of long
form gaming has had,

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.579
like if you think about
it, if you take a game like

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:06.870
"Counter-Strike," and first
person shooters in general,

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.750
they were around in
early 2000s, right?

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.440
They're still growing because
they created a gaming culture

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.700
around real time gaming.

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.707
And that hasn't yet
happened, or rather we're

00:04:16.707 --> 00:04:17.790
very early days in mobile.

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.620
So for us it was
that realization

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.380
that you need to come into this
game with a different mindset.

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.720
So there's no way that we
can go out and market it

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:25.770
like a traditional game.

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.960
We need to do something
different in how we bring it

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.440
up.

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.890
ANDREW STALBOW: So we
started three years ago.

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:36.550
And we basically felt
like the opportunity

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.440
was to challenge
the way things were

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.430
being done, both on the product
side and marketing side.

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.380
And for us, I'd say
right the beginning

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:45.880
we knew we had to
do it differently,

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.160
otherwise there
was just no way we

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.310
were going to cut through
against very, very big

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:53.420
incumbents in the mobile space.

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:56.980
So for us, what we
saw as the opportunity

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:01.540
was try and find
ways to build a story

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.970
and introduce a
world and characters,

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.040
and really come up
with a beautiful brand

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.360
on the front end.

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.540
And whereas a lot
of game companies

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.540
tended to add that
layer on quite late,

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.180
we built the story
first and then designed

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.330
a game that would
really bring that out

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.800
in a really special way.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.660
And then on the
marketing side, we

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:25.990
knew that we would
not be able to compete

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.860
with the big companies
on Facebook and Twitter

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.480
and performance
marketing acquisition,

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.860
which was ultimately
very expensive, and said,

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.690
well, hey, can we be super
creative about the way we

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:40.990
market and try and find ways
to bring installs in and bring

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.510
players in a much more
cost effective way than

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:45.880
through performance
marketing platforms,

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.060
and also at the same time,
differentiate ourselves

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.820
with a nice creative
marketing experience that

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.170
helps kind of build our brand.

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:55.959
Because ultimately our
mission is build a great brand

00:05:55.959 --> 00:05:56.500
in the world.

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:00.230
So like Kristian,
right at the beginning.

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:02.440
ANDRES BOU: For us, we do
it on our gaming basis.

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:07.010
So every game we have to make
sure that in two years from now

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:09.860
we'll have all the
meaningful things.

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:11.830
We challenge ourselves
to think, OK,

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:15.170
how are going to be the
games in two years, in three

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:18.470
years from now, and make sure
that all the new games that we

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:20.890
have in development have
all those ingredients.

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:23.710
Because if not, they will
not be trending at that time.

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:28.360
And to be honest with
you, when we launched

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.860
"Dragon City" and
"Monster Legends,"

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:31.820
we didn't believe that
they could last so long.

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:34.694
Initially we thought maybe
two years, maybe three years.

00:06:34.694 --> 00:06:36.610
Now we are approaching
the games that they can

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:38.280
sustain 10 years or even more.

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:41.735
So it's taking a lot of
effort in the community,

00:06:41.735 --> 00:06:44.390
in the users, in
the relative users,

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:47.660
making sure that we listen
to them, that we launch

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:50.270
and we develop what
they are aiming for,

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:53.510
and making sure that everything
evolves on the right path.

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:55.010
DAVE GEFFON: Yeah,
I think the thing

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:56.720
I keep hearing is that
this is like a very

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.261
deliberate in the
way you're thinking

00:06:58.261 --> 00:07:01.130
and the way you're approaching
your strategy for your games.

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:04.664
Clearly you're thinking
years are out, years ahead.

00:07:04.664 --> 00:07:06.080
There's a lot of
new kind and kind

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.030
of emergent trends
in games right now.

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:10.160
So I mean obviously VR's big.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.420
AR is just around the corner.

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:12.590
Is there anything
that you're seeing

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:15.440
that's making you either kind of
question your current strategy

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:18.050
or think about, is it
time to pivot or kind of

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:19.460
add to what we're doing?

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:20.960
KRISTIAN SEGERSTRALE:
Well one thing

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:23.600
that I think is really,
really clear that we've just

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.090
been delighted to see
throughout has been,

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:28.790
as a game that focuses on
the competitive experience

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:31.630
and focuses on the spectated
experience just as much

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:34.130
as the actual play experience,
and having millions of people

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:38.300
playing and watching every
month already, is the growth,

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:41.990
and the growth rate of people
watching other people play.

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:43.910
That's happening obviously
very quickly on PC,

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:46.700
but it's happening even
faster on mobile right now.

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:49.440
If you saw the presentation
from this morning,

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:51.500
spectation in mobile
games on YouTube

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:53.300
as well as on other
platforms is really

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:55.040
growing much faster
than PC gaming

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:57.140
right now, which
makes a lot of sense.

00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:59.420
But that interaction between--

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:01.910
because it creates so many
more dynamics between you

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:04.100
and your community when
people enjoy watching people

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:05.180
play your game.

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:07.790
It enables you to
work much more closely

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:10.160
with a video format as
a way of communicating

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.290
with your users
and your players.

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:14.540
It enables you to,
frankly, bring some

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:18.080
of that back into the
game, the video created

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:19.257
by your competitors.

00:08:19.257 --> 00:08:20.840
And of course it
enables you to set up

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:23.016
live events where people
compete with each other

00:08:23.016 --> 00:08:24.890
and a lot of people will
come and watch them.

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:27.950
That dynamic and the speed at
which it is growing right now

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:28.880
is amazing.

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:30.380
It took PC gaming
probably, what,

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:33.360
10 years to go from the very
first streamed, spectated

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.312
experiences to where
we are at right now

00:08:35.312 --> 00:08:36.770
with literally
hundreds of millions

00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:38.780
watching in any given month.

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:40.970
Mobile is catching up
very, very rapidly.

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:43.159
That to me is a really
encouraging trend.

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:47.210
It really makes us double down
even further on ensuring things

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:49.460
like that you can stream
directly from device,

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:52.490
you can record video
directly from device,

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:53.930
and there are
meaningful ways and

00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:55.969
meaningful online
communities for the game

00:08:55.969 --> 00:08:57.260
to share what you have created.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.051
Because that level of
community interaction

00:08:59.051 --> 00:09:01.860
is really unique and
growing very rapidly.

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:04.820
ANDREW STALBOW: I think what's
super exciting about mobile is

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:07.490
we're all creating
portraits that are actually

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:08.330
live services.

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:10.480
And I'm sure like
us, most of you

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:13.010
are updating your apps
every three or four weeks

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:14.750
and you're adding new features.

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:18.380
And I think what that gives
us all an amazing opportunity

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:21.890
to do is for the first time,
really small developers--

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:24.800
I mean, we're a tiny
team of 50 people.

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:27.800
But we're connected to 2 million
people playing every day,

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:31.070
spending around an hour
a day in our products.

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:34.040
And we get to learn from
that data, iterate on it.

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:36.810
And every time there's
a new opportunity,

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:39.050
whether it be integrating
video into your app

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:41.060
or whether it be
integrating replay

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:44.360
or whether it be kind of
designing and updating

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:47.150
new features because
you've seen something that

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:49.370
seems like a great
opportunity for your product,

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:50.870
the amazing thing
about the platform

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:53.450
is we all get to be able to
kind of update very quickly

00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:55.380
and iterate on
changes that we see.

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:58.250
So I definitely think that's
one of the most amazing things

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:01.020
about mobile is we do get the
chance to react and iterate

00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:02.910
on that.

00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:06.250
ANDRES BOU: For me, I'm not
a big fan or believer of VR,

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:08.550
not yet.

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:10.290
I totally agree with Kristian.

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:14.610
eSports, it's going to be
super huge and super big.

00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:17.550
I think the future is
also about competition,

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:19.800
peer to peer real time.

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:21.330
And social and
building communities,

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:24.480
it's also a key element.

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:26.430
DAVE GEFFON: So eSports,
competitive gaming

00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:29.510
seems to be like a kind of
forefront of your thinking.

00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:32.670
What is it about eSports other
than the obvious that it's

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:34.500
great to watch people
play games when

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:36.490
you're passionate about them.

00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:38.490
What do you think just
keeps these people coming

00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:39.957
back for more and more?

00:10:39.957 --> 00:10:41.790
KRISTIAN SEGERSTRALE:
Well you were formerly

00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:44.315
a competitive player so you
may know more about this than--

00:10:44.315 --> 00:10:46.440
DAVE GEFFON: I love games
and have no self-control.

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:47.712
That's why.

00:10:47.712 --> 00:10:49.170
KRISTIAN SEGERSTRALE:
That's great.

00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:51.330
Well I guess the way
we think about it is,

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:54.330
I think there's so much
hype and talk about eSports

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:57.522
right now that sometimes is
kind of worth just sort of maybe

00:10:57.522 --> 00:10:58.980
bringing it back
to kind of putting

00:10:58.980 --> 00:10:59.980
your feet on the ground.

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:02.370
At the end of the day, we
are excited about building

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:05.280
that experience that
made us when we grew up

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:07.710
spend nights on end
at friends' houses

00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:11.310
with our PC playing together as
a team against some strangers

00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:13.770
over some kind of dial
up connection somewhere.

00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:17.430
And I think it is that
fundamental thing of creating

00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:20.370
an experience that people
want to play as a team,

00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:23.250
if it is fun enough, people
end up rewarding you,

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:25.080
if you're a
developer, by wanting

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:26.310
to play a competitive game.

00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:28.560
That's what really
blew our mind last year

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:31.060
was we thought we had so much
work to do and product still.

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:33.750
I mean at the end of the
day, a real time multiplayer

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:36.960
game on mobile which pushes
1.3 million polygons on screen

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:39.035
at any one time at 60
FPS is like, we just

00:11:39.035 --> 00:11:40.410
felt like there
was a lot of work

00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:41.868
here to do before
we get to a point

00:11:41.868 --> 00:11:43.877
where we would even
begin to think about

00:11:43.877 --> 00:11:46.210
how would we encourage a
competitive scene for the game.

00:11:46.210 --> 00:11:48.300
But the community ran away
with it, to be honest.

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:50.490
Really early on their
first ask was, hey,

00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:51.930
can we have a spectator mode?

00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:53.638
When is the first
tournament going to be?

00:11:53.638 --> 00:11:56.760
People started organizing
tournaments inside

00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:58.440
of the community.

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.480
I think last year we had
over 6,000 registered

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:03.492
teams kind of various
community tournaments

00:12:03.492 --> 00:12:05.700
with some prize pools and
things and then all the way

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:07.241
leading up to the
world championships

00:12:07.241 --> 00:12:09.530
with more than 25,000 people
watching at the same time

00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:12.010
back in December,
which is pretty cool.

00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:16.200
But I think ultimately,
we think that the success

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:19.590
of the competitive community
is a product of listening

00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:20.820
to the community throughout.

00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:23.430
We try to think of ourselves
first and foremost as players,

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:26.220
ourselves, but then also
inviting the player base

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:29.160
in to come and be co-creators
of the experience.

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.110
We just released
yesterday as part

00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:32.820
of an invitational
tournament where

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:34.903
we're celebrating some of
the big new teams coming

00:12:34.903 --> 00:12:36.690
into "Vainglory," like
Miami Heat acquired

00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:40.920
a "Vainglory" team, as
well as some others.

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:46.080
And we released a video
about our 2017 plans,

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:47.580
about what we are
thinking of making

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:49.496
and what we're thinking
of creating and asking

00:12:49.496 --> 00:12:50.940
for community feedback.

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:53.119
And it's amazing how just
that level of transparency

00:12:53.119 --> 00:12:54.660
with communication
with the community

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:58.140
really lights up what
the community's passions.

00:12:58.140 --> 00:12:59.310
And they frankly help us.

00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:00.450
They are sort of
a North Star of,

00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:02.408
are we taking this game
in the right direction?

00:13:02.408 --> 00:13:04.410
So competitive play is
simply the community

00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:08.190
at its very highest
level showing you,

00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:10.410
in some ways as
the developer, what

00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:13.440
the game can be if you take
it in the correct direction.

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:16.230
So we're always amazed
at how many people play

00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:20.499
and how many people are part
of the competitive scene.

00:13:20.499 --> 00:13:22.290
And frankly now I think
there's approaching

00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:25.277
50 people in the world who
play "Vainglory" as a living,

00:13:25.277 --> 00:13:26.860
like that is their
main job right now.

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:28.318
And that obviously,
as a developer,

00:13:28.318 --> 00:13:30.840
gives you even more reason
to do a good job to make sure

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:32.840
that the scene keeps on
growing and that you're

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:34.627
a better game every day.

00:13:34.627 --> 00:13:36.460
ANDREW STALBOW: I think
that's the real key.

00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:39.550
We all get to react to
the data, in our games,

00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:42.610
but we also get to react to
the community, whether it

00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:45.940
be comments in the
stores or whether it

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:48.990
be in your social
communities as well.

00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:51.844
And what we're seeing
across the board is,

00:13:51.844 --> 00:13:54.260
obviously, everyone's playing
because they're competitive.

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.459
And now you've got the
tools and the ability

00:13:56.459 --> 00:13:58.000
to kind of get even
more competitive.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.490
And I think what you're
going to start seeing on,

00:14:00.490 --> 00:14:03.370
like the definition of eSports
right now feels a little bit

00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:05.559
more kind of midcore or core.

00:14:05.559 --> 00:14:07.600
But I think it's going to
feel very, very-- well,

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:09.975
it's going to feel very, very
casual over the next couple

00:14:09.975 --> 00:14:13.030
of years as more and
more products come out

00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:17.490
and as the audience gets
more and more used to it.

00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:21.500
ANDRES BOU: We don't have
pure eSports games, not yet.

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:25.630
But we have a lot of social
and competition in our games.

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:29.020
And I think human being, it's
quite competitive by itself.

00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:33.240
And so at the end, making sure
that games are also competitive

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:36.330
and bringing those experience
into the digital world,

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:37.380
it makes total sense.

00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:40.320
And we have launched
many, many, many features

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:43.800
in "Monster Legends" about
social, about competition.

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:47.070
And we saw-- we know
from saying today

00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:51.330
that we launched that
feature, engagement going up,

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:53.700
people going back
and fighting more,

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:55.480
and even also paying more.

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:58.500
So it's, people
love that experience

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:00.475
and they are aiming for more.

00:15:00.475 --> 00:15:01.850
DAVE GEFFON: So
one thing I think

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:04.040
that I've kind of
heard all of you

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:07.520
touch on, which is the
community aspect of sharing

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:10.610
and watching and being
passionate about a game,

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:11.640
your particular games.

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:15.680
How are you using your biggest
fans, influencers, the people

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:18.050
who are the biggest
advocates for your game

00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:21.260
to either extend your
message, extend your brand,

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.895
and just kind of help grow
your community organically?

00:15:23.895 --> 00:15:25.520
KRISTIAN SEGERSTRALE:
Well we certainly

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:28.140
try to work with the community
as much as humanly possible.

00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:30.139
I don't know that we use
the commutative per se.

00:15:30.139 --> 00:15:31.910
I think sometimes I
feel like they use us,

00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:33.380
in terms of just the
sheer amount of hours

00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:35.600
that we put into trying to
do things that they want.

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:39.440
But the way that
we think about it

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:42.532
is, firstly, we, of course,
have a vision of what

00:15:42.532 --> 00:15:44.240
we want to build over
the next five to 10

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:46.730
to 15 years, which
is all about bringing

00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:49.730
that competitive experience that
we've seen really blossom on PC

00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:51.460
and console, that
real time experience,

00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:54.740
but that hasn't really yet
come to mobile, that culture

00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:56.865
of playing together real time.

00:15:56.865 --> 00:15:58.490
We believe that that
community, whoever

00:15:58.490 --> 00:16:01.610
does as good a job with
that on mobile as a Blizzard

00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:03.950
or a Riot or a
Valve has done on PC

00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:07.160
will ultimately be an
incredibly successful game

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:08.840
over the next five to 10 years.

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:11.240
And that's what we are
committed to building everyday.

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:13.670
And we feel like
the best way to get

00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:15.800
there is to try and
find as many people

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:19.449
like us who love this style
of gaming on these devices

00:16:19.449 --> 00:16:20.240
and work with them.

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:22.580
So it starts all
the way from a--

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:26.670
we have a private
closed beta group.

00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:29.490
We release the next release
three or four weeks earlier

00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:33.620
for, in the order of hundreds of
players, in order to help test

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:36.830
and think about the very detail
of what's about to come next.

00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:38.330
We have a much,
much larger group

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:40.670
of folks who hang
out on our forums

00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:44.524
and who we frequently invite
in and just ask about, hey,

00:16:44.524 --> 00:16:46.190
what do they think
about this direction?

00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:47.815
And then there's the
entire player base

00:16:47.815 --> 00:16:53.090
where we take some of them,
we solicit opinion a lot.

00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:53.842
We ask questions.

00:16:53.842 --> 00:16:55.550
We do everything from
surveys all the way

00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:56.966
to literally just
run competitions

00:16:56.966 --> 00:16:58.100
for ideas and whatnot.

00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:00.470
But then on top of that
if the community goes

00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:02.420
through the effort of
creating something,

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:04.430
like creating a video
or creating a poem

00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:07.010
or like a great piece of
fan art or whatever it is,

00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:09.530
we really try to go out of our
way to feature that in game,

00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:12.380
wherever possible, to sort of
give back to the community,

00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:14.270
show back to the community
our appreciation.

00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:16.880
Because ultimately that
helps these content creators

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:20.180
get discovered, by a
player base of millions.

00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:22.160
And if they do a good
job and repeatedly put

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:23.480
out good videos and
good things, they

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:24.950
end up growing
their follower base.

00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:28.950
So we just try to work
together in all different ways.

00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:32.721
And again, we obviously want to
push the game in the direction

00:17:32.721 --> 00:17:34.470
that we believe is
right in the long term.

00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:36.050
But a lot of the
time the community

00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:38.480
is there way before us in
terms of spotting problems

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:40.790
with potential
directions of the game,

00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:42.710
as well as just being
very loud with feedback,

00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:43.880
which is amazing.

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:46.296
ANDREW STALBOW: Well we have
a slightly different approach

00:17:46.296 --> 00:17:47.720
to community to Kristian's.

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:50.840
So we've got about 7 million
people connected to us

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:54.410
across the social media
channels, email newsletters.

00:17:54.410 --> 00:17:57.200
And we've now got to a point
where we're providing content

00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:00.920
to them two or three
times a day through each

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:02.660
of those connections.

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:06.290
The thing that I think
is ultimately interesting

00:18:06.290 --> 00:18:07.979
is, you need to
address community

00:18:07.979 --> 00:18:09.020
right from the beginning.

00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:10.644
If you think the
first point of contact

00:18:10.644 --> 00:18:13.400
when you start marketing to
people about your product

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:18.890
and your game and the world
that you're offering--

00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:20.630
a good example of
that for us is we

00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:22.850
work really closely with
a lot of different YouTube

00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:24.020
influencers.

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:28.070
And we found that the most
amazing way to bring people

00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:31.580
into our experience
is find ways for them

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:34.430
to not just market the game but
kind of come inside our product

00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:35.150
too.

00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:37.220
And we've run
competitions where people

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:39.620
can choose to join different
influencers' teams.

00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:41.150
And it gets people
in the mindset

00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:43.100
that this content
is really a kind

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:45.230
of engaging two way experience.

00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:46.820
And it's something
kind of really,

00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:51.277
really fun for people to be able
to try and compete or support

00:18:51.277 --> 00:18:52.110
their biggest stars.

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:54.326
So I'd say to you,
thing when you're

00:18:54.326 --> 00:18:55.700
thinking about
building community

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:58.490
is also integrate all community
thinking in your marketing

00:18:58.490 --> 00:19:01.400
strategies too.

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:04.100
ANDRES BOU: We try to
consider communities

00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:06.496
as part of the team.

00:19:06.496 --> 00:19:07.870
I mean it's very
hard to do that,

00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:10.550
but we try to work with them.

00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:12.270
So we have weekly
calls with them.

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:16.280
We have even early access of
some features just for them,

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:19.070
to listen the feedback.

00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:21.170
Sometimes we don't agree
with what they say,

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:25.640
but we will listen to them and
we decide what's reasonable

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:29.260
and what we should change
or include in our games.

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:32.210
And for building
communities, I totally agree.

00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:38.780
Using influencers or YouTubers,
it's a huge weapon to do that.

00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:41.690
My only advice to
that, it's you have

00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:45.260
to make sure that the
influencers' audience matches

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:47.450
perfectly with
your game audience.

00:19:47.450 --> 00:19:51.770
Because we have run many,
many campaigns with YouTubers,

00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:55.640
many of them very successful,
some of them also big failures.

00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:57.680
And the number one
lesson that they learn

00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:01.366
is make sure that the
audience has a perfect fit.

00:20:01.366 --> 00:20:02.740
DAVE GEFFON: So
one last question

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:06.010
before we open it
up to Q&amp;A. Obviously

00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:08.410
there's developers in this
room from all walks of life,

00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:12.102
small one, two man studios
to maybe 30 people plus.

00:20:12.102 --> 00:20:14.560
What's one thing everyone in
this room, regardless of size,

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:17.635
can do today to better
serve their community?

00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:22.460
KRISTIAN SEGERSTRALE: I
think everyone was once

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:24.000
a one or two person studio.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.510
Just that's the way game
companies grow, right?

00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:29.540
And I think community
is a mindset.

00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:31.310
There's nothing you
can do today that will

00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:32.685
double the size
of your community

00:20:32.685 --> 00:20:34.730
or triple it or
suddenly set you up

00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:36.506
to be super successful
in the future.

00:20:36.506 --> 00:20:37.880
It's just a mindset,
and you just

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:39.410
have to trust that it will come.

00:20:39.410 --> 00:20:41.550
If you treat your
players the way

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:43.560
that you would want to
be treated as a player,

00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:48.340
if you invite them along, you're
honest, transparent, patient,

00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:52.270
and you build the game in a
way that you would want to be--

00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:53.687
and you communicate
out in the way

00:20:53.687 --> 00:20:55.936
that you would want to be
communicated to as a player,

00:20:55.936 --> 00:20:56.710
good things come.

00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:58.310
It just simply takes time.

00:20:58.310 --> 00:21:00.060
We live in this
world where people--

00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:02.080
certainly over the past
few years there's been,

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:03.430
we've built this
expectation that you've

00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:04.810
got to be successful overnight.

00:21:04.810 --> 00:21:08.020
And if you're not in the top
10 grossing in your first two

00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:10.600
weeks, you should kill the
game and move on and rapid,

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:12.130
fail fast, and all that stuff.

00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:13.060
Not so with community.

00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:15.010
You can't fail fast
with community.

00:21:15.010 --> 00:21:20.320
You've got to simply grow
it and be brave enough

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:22.030
to truly be transparent
and if you like,

00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:24.280
be naked in front
of your community,

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:25.540
for the good and bad.

00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:27.070
When you make a
mistake, admit it.

00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:29.276
When you do something well,
listen to the community

00:21:29.276 --> 00:21:31.150
and see if you can help
celebrate it together

00:21:31.150 --> 00:21:31.650
with them.

00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:33.257
So to treat them as
part of the team,

00:21:33.257 --> 00:21:35.090
I actually quite liked
that comment earlier.

00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:37.390
ANDREW STALBOW: Yeah, I
double down on that one.

00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:39.160
I'd say show that you care.

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:41.020
And ultimately if
you're creating

00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:45.460
an authentic experience that is
something you care passionately

00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:49.140
about that isn't
about money first

00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:51.260
but it's actually about
kind of engagement

00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:53.260
and a really
beautiful experience

00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:56.050
that everybody
can enjoy, I think

00:21:56.050 --> 00:21:57.280
that sets you up brilliantly.

00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:01.270
And it's amazing
how suddenly you

00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:03.700
get all these communities
built around what you're

00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:06.970
doing because they've seen the
effect you've made on your art

00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:11.470
or on your design or on
the music that, you know,

00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:14.350
80% of people put on mute but
you've made the effort on.

00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:16.970
And I think that the
minute you show you care,

00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:20.041
it's unbelievable what happens.

00:22:20.041 --> 00:22:22.290
ANDRES BOU: I wouldn't focus
on growing the community.

00:22:22.290 --> 00:22:26.330
So I think everyone should
focus on improving the game

00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:28.310
and improving the product.

00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:31.250
Get the community
and listen to them

00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:33.440
to try to make your
product better.

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:36.080
That's what I would
focus on 100%.

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:38.080
ANDREW STALBOW: You know,
I'll just add to that.

00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:40.079
We have a little saying
inside the company which

00:22:40.079 --> 00:22:41.240
is like do the right thing.

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:44.630
So any time you're
in any doubt, invest

00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:46.190
into these things
over the long term

00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:47.360
and do the right
thing because that's

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:49.230
going to come back
and help your brand.

00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:51.740
It's like Andre
said, these people

00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:54.579
are now building apps that
I think a couple of years

00:22:54.579 --> 00:22:56.120
ago maybe you thought
they might have

00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:58.340
a life cycle of 12, 18 months.

00:22:58.340 --> 00:22:59.990
But now I think most
of us are thinking

00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:02.520
they could be significantly
longer than that.

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:04.342
It's a really good opportunity.

00:23:04.342 --> 00:23:05.300
DAVE GEFFON: Excellent.

00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:07.700
So we're going to open
it up to questions.

00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:09.480
There's two mics on either side.

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:11.780
So feel free to
come up if you want

00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:15.980
to ask any of these fantastic
members of our panel

00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:16.940
a specific question.

00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:19.620
KRISTIAN SEGERSTRALE: Or this
fantastic moderator right here.

00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:21.480
DAVE GEFFON: Thank you.

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:22.845
I'll just start over here.

00:23:22.845 --> 00:23:24.030
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:23:24.030 --> 00:23:25.550
I'm a game developer.

00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:27.970
I have two questions.

00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:30.020
First question is
for all of you.

00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:32.240
What kind of genre
do you think it's

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:37.280
worth to build communities,
because we're really small.

00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:38.850
We only have 10 people.

00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:40.850
We are working on a
single player game.

00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:42.260
It's a tower defense game.

00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:45.950
It's already out,
but we're not quite

00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:49.550
sure how much effort
we should invest

00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:51.270
in building the community.

00:23:51.270 --> 00:23:54.010
Second question is for Kristian.

00:23:54.010 --> 00:23:56.060
It's my personal question.

00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:58.354
What's your answer
to "Mobile Legends"?

00:23:58.354 --> 00:24:00.520
DAVE GEFFON: What's your
answer to "Mobile Legends"?

00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:01.561
KRISTIAN SEGERSTRALE: OK.

00:24:01.561 --> 00:24:03.330
I'll take the first
question first.

00:24:03.330 --> 00:24:05.060
ANDRES BOU: So on
the first question,

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:07.340
I would focus on everything
that is competitive.

00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:10.970
So I would go for RPGs,
strategy kind of games.

00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:14.180
I think that the kind of
gameplays and mechanics

00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:20.540
that those games have makes the
creation of communities quite

00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:23.600
easier compared to other ones
that are more single player

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:25.785
modes or this kind of.

00:24:25.785 --> 00:24:27.160
ANDREW STALBOW:
I think if you've

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:29.170
got a product that
other people love,

00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:31.090
it's worth spending the time on.

00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:35.470
I think that the best
marketing you can ever do

00:24:35.470 --> 00:24:36.880
is word of mouth.

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:38.732
And if you build a
platform that people

00:24:38.732 --> 00:24:40.690
are excited to talk about,
you should give them

00:24:40.690 --> 00:24:43.810
the tools and the ability
to invest into that.

00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:46.810
So I'd say community
building is probably the best

00:24:46.810 --> 00:24:48.700
marketing you'll ever do.

00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:52.081
KRISTIAN SEGERSTRALE:
Yeah, overall, today, and I

00:24:52.081 --> 00:24:53.830
think somebody said
in the previous panel,

00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:57.619
just acquiring users just
purely through thinking

00:24:57.619 --> 00:24:59.410
of running video ads
on Facebook or Twitter

00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:01.576
or something like that is
just incredibly expensive.

00:25:01.576 --> 00:25:04.361
So I'd be surprised
if a distribution

00:25:04.361 --> 00:25:06.610
strategy, especially for an
early stage startup today,

00:25:06.610 --> 00:25:09.710
would not have community as
a pretty large part of it

00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:11.130
one way or the other.

00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:12.775
As far as your
second question, you

00:25:12.775 --> 00:25:14.920
were asking what's
my answer, what's

00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:16.600
our answer to "Mobile Legends."

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:21.670
I think, look, we don't have a
patent on real time multiplayer

00:25:21.670 --> 00:25:22.360
gaming, right?

00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:23.890
I mean, this is a
phenomenon that's

00:25:23.890 --> 00:25:26.140
grown on PC over
the past 20 years.

00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:29.500
And we're frankly just excited
that there are more and more

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:33.460
products that help drive the
culture of online real time

00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:35.874
play on the mobile platform.

00:25:35.874 --> 00:25:37.540
And there will be
many products that are

00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:38.560
going to come out this year.

00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:39.690
There were some
already last year.

00:25:39.690 --> 00:25:41.500
We were super happy
when "Clash Royale"

00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:44.110
came out as a
first 1v1 real time

00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:46.240
experience, and more
team-based experiences

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:49.480
coming out this year in the form
of shooters, mobiles, RTSes.

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:51.970
All of that stuff is
like where PC gaming

00:25:51.970 --> 00:25:53.240
was literally 20 years ago.

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:54.940
And that to us is exciting.

00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:57.460
And frankly we can learn
a lot from other products

00:25:57.460 --> 00:25:58.460
that are out there.

00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:02.620
And the thing I will say is that
there is no company out there

00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:05.720
that is as committed
to this experience,

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:08.320
both in terms of technology,
in terms of design,

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:09.870
in terms of approach
to community,

00:26:09.870 --> 00:26:12.842
and approach to competitive
play today than we are.

00:26:12.842 --> 00:26:15.300
And we're just excited to be
part of that broader community

00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:18.490
and part of that broader change,
if you like, in the industry

00:26:18.490 --> 00:26:21.450
toward far more real time play.

00:26:21.450 --> 00:26:23.824
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:26:23.824 --> 00:26:24.490
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:26:24.490 --> 00:26:27.940
We've found that building
community within the game,

00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:31.630
having players be able to
interact with each other

00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:35.290
and form emotional relationships
who meet in the game, who don't

00:26:35.290 --> 00:26:38.680
know each other previously, is
an incredibly strong motivator

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:39.280
of retention.

00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:42.250
But we've noticed that
mobile games don't

00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:46.840
tend to have very serious
ways to interact emotionally

00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:49.870
with other players you don't
have preexisting relationships.

00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:52.060
Is that a direction you
are looking to move into?

00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:53.590
And do you have
any insight on why

00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:54.885
it's so difficult on mobile?

00:26:57.389 --> 00:26:59.180
KRISTIAN SEGERSTRALE:
From our perspective,

00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:00.380
I completely agree with you.

00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:02.600
If you look at the
retention patterns of people

00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:05.510
who are friends or who
are part of, in our case,

00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:07.370
guilds or teams
inside of the game

00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:09.620
and who communicate
with each other a lot,

00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:12.080
it's very different from the
retention pattern of somebody

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:13.940
who plays purely on their own.

00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:15.320
So that is clearly right.

00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:18.840
I think a lot of
when you deal with,

00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:21.200
especially smaller
screen real estate,

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:23.960
it's sometimes just design-wise
harder to think about,

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:25.880
how do you put a
chat box everywhere

00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:28.790
when the screen is kind of small
and when the keyboard obscures

00:27:28.790 --> 00:27:30.590
half of the action?

00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:34.250
How do you, in that context, do
that in the best possible way?

00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:36.620
So we think a lot
about different ways

00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:38.330
of improving
communication in the game

00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:41.300
and enabling the formation
of those relationships.

00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:43.239
We have, certainly as a
company and as a game,

00:27:43.239 --> 00:27:45.780
we have a lot to learn from many
other products in that area.

00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:47.817
But I think what you're
saying is exactly right.

00:27:47.817 --> 00:27:48.525
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:27:51.267 --> 00:27:53.600
AUDIENCE: Hello, and this
question is about "Vainglory,"

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:57.050
so I guess it's for Kristian.

00:27:57.050 --> 00:27:59.270
Before "Vainglory"
was a success,

00:27:59.270 --> 00:28:03.750
before it was known
for its quality and all

00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:07.600
that stuff, the first contact
with the community, how was it?

00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:11.240
How did you communicate
to the community?

00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:13.370
Where do you start it?

00:28:13.370 --> 00:28:16.960
And how did you convince
them to take their word

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:21.440
to download a game that
takes a lot of effort

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:23.674
from you to start playing?

00:28:23.674 --> 00:28:25.840
KRISTIAN SEGERSTRALE: Yeah,
that's a great question,

00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:27.200
so how did we start?

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:29.510
We just started super
humbly because we

00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:32.780
knew that, one, the product
was pretty janky when we first

00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:33.660
released it.

00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:35.076
We literally put
it live, I think,

00:28:35.076 --> 00:28:37.790
it was in Singapore and in
the Philippines initially.

00:28:37.790 --> 00:28:39.512
And we literally
put a letter up.

00:28:39.512 --> 00:28:40.970
The first experience
you would have

00:28:40.970 --> 00:28:42.650
when you loaded up
the game was a letter

00:28:42.650 --> 00:28:45.710
from our chief creative officer
saying, hey, we're just getting

00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:46.460
started.

00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:47.990
We know this is not perfect.

00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:48.892
Please bear with us.

00:28:48.892 --> 00:28:51.350
We're a team of folks are super
passionate about this style

00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:51.800
of gaming.

00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:53.330
Please join us on
the forums to come

00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:55.247
and chat about what you
think about this game.

00:28:55.247 --> 00:28:56.830
And that was literally
the first thing

00:28:56.830 --> 00:28:58.400
that you would see
when you started.

00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:00.710
And literally the first
downloads that we got,

00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:01.820
we were in the office.

00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:04.779
We had an alert in the office
going when somebody is online,

00:29:04.779 --> 00:29:06.570
because this is clearly
a multiplayer game.

00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:08.444
So many people need to
play at the same time.

00:29:08.444 --> 00:29:11.690
We would all jump into the game
so that that one guy would have

00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:13.810
five other people to play with.

00:29:13.810 --> 00:29:14.930
But it's true.

00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:17.180
You have to approach it with
that level of dedication.

00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:18.860
You have to earn every player.

00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:20.990
Especially in our
case, we had so much

00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:23.450
work to do on designs and just
learning about what it means

00:29:23.450 --> 00:29:24.680
to play this type of game.

00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:26.200
And we still have
a long way to go.

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:27.950
But if you approach
it with, you know

00:29:27.950 --> 00:29:30.120
what, we're going to
do, first and foremost,

00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:32.720
be there for the player and be
very transparent about the fact

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:34.310
that we know that a lot
of things suck still

00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:35.935
and we're trying to
work on it with us,

00:29:35.935 --> 00:29:38.510
but please come and work with
us, there's a lot of people

00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:41.090
who, ultimately, if you
take the right tone,

00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:42.800
want to help you succeed.

00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:44.960
And that's an amazing
thing that really

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:47.337
teaches you so much about
your game and your company.

00:29:47.337 --> 00:29:48.170
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:52.370
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:29:52.370 --> 00:29:55.040
I'm fascinated about this
topic of community building

00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:57.630
in the sense that
I feel like myself

00:29:57.630 --> 00:29:59.284
and a lot of other
indie developers

00:29:59.284 --> 00:30:00.950
understand that it's
important, but fall

00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:03.050
into the trap of
saying that we're too

00:30:03.050 --> 00:30:05.780
busy building the game, right?

00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:08.226
And the sort of solution for
this in other areas of life

00:30:08.226 --> 00:30:09.620
is, for instance, with exercise.

00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:13.140
If you don't have time for
exercise, build a habit.

00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:16.060
Do 10 squats and 10
push-ups in the morning,

00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:17.366
and that'll build up over time.

00:30:17.366 --> 00:30:19.740
And eventually you'll feel
more interested in this habit,

00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:20.640
so on and so forth.

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:22.970
So what's the 10 squats
and 10 push-ups version

00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:24.057
of community building?

00:30:24.057 --> 00:30:25.640
What do you do from
day one as a habit

00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:30.281
that's small but potentially
painful but will build up?

00:30:30.281 --> 00:30:32.030
ANDREW STALBOW: Set
up a Facebook channel,

00:30:32.030 --> 00:30:35.130
Instagram channel, Twitter
channel, YouTube channel.

00:30:35.130 --> 00:30:38.600
Promote it in the app and
publish content on there

00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:40.580
about what you're
building every day.

00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:45.110
Yeah, one piece
of content today.

00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:46.270
Doesn't need to be a lot.

00:30:46.270 --> 00:30:49.010
And I think the minute you
start doing that, you'll just

00:30:49.010 --> 00:30:50.270
start getting into the groove.

00:30:50.270 --> 00:30:51.650
And then you also
start realizing

00:30:51.650 --> 00:30:55.550
your app's a great way to
promote each of those channels

00:30:55.550 --> 00:30:56.210
too.

00:30:56.210 --> 00:30:57.980
And suddenly it becomes
a bit of a circular thing

00:30:57.980 --> 00:30:59.646
where people going
into one, coming back

00:30:59.646 --> 00:31:01.550
into your experience.

00:31:01.550 --> 00:31:03.845
And I think it's a great
way to get started.

00:31:03.845 --> 00:31:05.630
AUDIENCE: Can I ask
a follow up quickly?

00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:09.860
ANDRES BOU: And find some
time to talk with them also.

00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:12.200
AUDIENCE: Can I quickly
ask a follow up?

00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:17.120
So as I understand it, there's
sort of these two areas

00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:19.250
in which you focus on
with community building.

00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:21.020
There's acquisition
and there's retention.

00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:23.000
And the sort of posts
seems like a great way

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.790
to build an emotional
investment with the following

00:31:25.790 --> 00:31:26.970
that you already have.

00:31:26.970 --> 00:31:29.450
So what's the 10
squats and 10 push-ups

00:31:29.450 --> 00:31:33.800
of acquisition, if I can't
afford the Facebook ads?

00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:35.384
I'm not going to
wake up every morning

00:31:35.384 --> 00:31:36.924
and pay for some
Facebook ads, right?

00:31:36.924 --> 00:31:38.030
But what would I do?

00:31:40.512 --> 00:31:42.720
KRISTIAN SEGERSTRALE: You're
the kind of this, right?

00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:48.320
ANDREW STALBOW: I'd
say go find people

00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:51.230
that love your
experience and are

00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:56.120
willing to shout about it for
free to very little money.

00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:57.720
And go challenge yourself.

00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:59.420
You know at the
end of the day, I

00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:02.220
think there's some massive
platforms out there,

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:05.300
whether it's Twitch or
YouTube or whatever it may be,

00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:07.310
where there's huge
audiences that

00:32:07.310 --> 00:32:09.620
are always looking to learn
about new kind of gaming

00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:10.790
experiences.

00:32:10.790 --> 00:32:13.550
And I'd say go hustle
your way to figure out,

00:32:13.550 --> 00:32:16.800
how do you get people to
start talking and sharing it

00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:17.750
in your videos?

00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:21.920
And get started with no budget
and challenge yourself on that.

00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:23.552
Because that's
very, very doable.

00:32:23.552 --> 00:32:25.760
KRISTIAN SEGERSTRALE: Yeah,
the one thing I would say

00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:29.480
is that there's an awful lot of
incredibly passionate content

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:31.020
creators out there.

00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:34.520
And just by being kind,
actually responding to them,

00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:37.850
respecting their work, you
will get an awful long way,

00:32:37.850 --> 00:32:40.440
if you can work out ways
of helping promote them.

00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:42.940
Because their business problem
is, how do I get players--

00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:45.422
or users rather,
viewers of my content?

00:32:45.422 --> 00:32:47.630
Your business problem might
be how do I get new ones,

00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:49.070
but theirs is just
like, how can I even

00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:50.819
connect to a community
in the first place?

00:32:50.819 --> 00:32:53.040
So by respecting that and
treating them as equals

00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:55.460
and trying to figure out how
do we do this together as

00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:57.293
opposed to figuring out
how do I throw money

00:32:57.293 --> 00:33:00.350
at this sort of anonymous
group of influencers

00:33:00.350 --> 00:33:02.060
who will bring me
millions of players,

00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:03.430
that would be maybe my--

00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:06.110
ANDREW STALBOW: One
other interesting way

00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:09.170
to potentially approach it
as well is, go figure out

00:33:09.170 --> 00:33:14.750
if there is a partnership with
another company that is looking

00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:17.914
to kind of raise awareness
of what they're doing

00:33:17.914 --> 00:33:19.580
in your product and
you can do some kind

00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:22.042
of reciprocal arrangement.

00:33:22.042 --> 00:33:24.500
When we started, we've done
that with a couple of other app

00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:27.530
companies where we've both kind
of cross-promoted each other.

00:33:27.530 --> 00:33:29.870
And that worked
out really nicely.

00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:31.580
Another thing we
did was-- you know,

00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:33.430
"Best Fiends" is all
about a whole load

00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:35.090
of different
creatures in the game.

00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:37.520
And one of them is
a mosquito called

00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:40.160
Edward who gave up
his blood sucking ways

00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:43.670
and he drinks coconut water
from a scuba tank on his back.

00:33:43.670 --> 00:33:45.980
And we designed this character
and we did a partnership

00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:47.390
with Malaria No More.

00:33:47.390 --> 00:33:49.970
And straight away we
do a pop up in the game

00:33:49.970 --> 00:33:53.930
and we cross-promote to a
co-branded Malaria No More

00:33:53.930 --> 00:33:55.430
"Best Fiends" page.

00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:58.190
And it's great for us because,
again it shows our audience

00:33:58.190 --> 00:34:00.110
that we care and think
a bit differently

00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:01.382
about our experience.

00:34:01.382 --> 00:34:03.590
But they've also got a really
big community of people

00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:05.974
as well that they were
excited to say, hey, here's

00:34:05.974 --> 00:34:06.890
something we're doing.

00:34:06.890 --> 00:34:08.806
And I think that was a
really nice kind of way

00:34:08.806 --> 00:34:09.620
as well to start.

00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:12.560
So just think a bit differently
about those kind of ideas.

00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:13.310
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:14.565
Thanks so much.

00:34:14.565 --> 00:34:16.565
DAVE GEFFON: So it's time
for one last question.

00:34:16.565 --> 00:34:18.530
And we'll take it over here.

00:34:18.530 --> 00:34:20.120
AUDIENCE: My
question for you all

00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:24.320
is, how do you manage
a community that

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:27.560
looks to see your game grow
in a certain direction that

00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:30.739
may be either
different or opposite

00:34:30.739 --> 00:34:34.309
of where you're actually
looking to take the game?

00:34:34.309 --> 00:34:36.100
ANDREW STALBOW: I would
say get used to it,

00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:37.739
because your community
is always going

00:34:37.739 --> 00:34:40.679
to have different
ideas about things

00:34:40.679 --> 00:34:42.480
that you should or shouldn't do.

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:47.159
And ultimately your kind of
ability to work well with them

00:34:47.159 --> 00:34:49.199
is to have somebody that can--

00:34:49.199 --> 00:34:52.380
whether it's a
social media manager,

00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:54.690
to be able to kind of
correspond with people

00:34:54.690 --> 00:34:57.539
who always expect you to be
doing something different.

00:34:57.539 --> 00:34:59.330
KRISTIAN SEGERSTRALE:
Yeah, I'd add to that

00:34:59.330 --> 00:35:03.570
that listening to
your full player base

00:35:03.570 --> 00:35:06.780
doesn't just mean listening
to the really loud ones.

00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:09.510
So trying to figure
out, and also

00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:11.770
being really transparent
about your own planning

00:35:11.770 --> 00:35:15.930
and how you think about things
and why you think about things.

00:35:15.930 --> 00:35:17.430
At the end of the
day, the community

00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:19.500
is really great at
reacting to what they hear

00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:21.210
or reacting to what they see.

00:35:21.210 --> 00:35:23.310
The more they hear
or see from you,

00:35:23.310 --> 00:35:26.070
the more refined their
ultimate reaction will be.

00:35:26.070 --> 00:35:29.760
And if you really truly
try to please everyone,

00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:32.730
you're not going to
please anyone in the end.

00:35:32.730 --> 00:35:36.120
We're huge believers of
taking a stance as a game.

00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:38.100
We know what we stand for.

00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:40.230
Literally "Vainglory"
is all about

00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:42.957
if you got Quentin Tarantino
to direct a manga movie,

00:35:42.957 --> 00:35:44.040
you would get "Vainglory."

00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:45.390
That is what we are.

00:35:45.390 --> 00:35:47.910
We have snow
leopards with rocket

00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:51.280
powered jet axes, right,
as opposed to just

00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:53.910
your random Viking
brute, for example.

00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:55.680
And we stand for that
style of gameplay.

00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:57.570
We stand for a certain
amount of irreverence.

00:35:57.570 --> 00:35:59.910
We stand for being
unapologetically core.

00:35:59.910 --> 00:36:02.040
If somebody comes
in and says, hey, I

00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:06.640
wish this game was much simpler
to play, that is, yes, we

00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:07.140
hear you.

00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:08.890
We want to understand how
to make it easier to learn.

00:36:08.890 --> 00:36:10.515
We want to make sure
that we understand

00:36:10.515 --> 00:36:13.200
how to create more meaningful
shorter sessions in the game,

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:14.099
all of those things.

00:36:14.099 --> 00:36:15.390
But we will not make it simple.

00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:17.680
That is not what we
are trying to do.

00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:20.280
So I think its trying
to listen to the player

00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:22.860
base with the thing in
mind that you want to make.

00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:26.220
Because if you don't
stand for anything--

00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:29.160
if you don't stand for anything
as a company and as a product,

00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:31.590
I think you will have a very
hard time building a truly

00:36:31.590 --> 00:36:33.780
passionate following over time.

00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:35.070
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:36:35.070 --> 00:36:37.980
ANDRES BOU: Just to add, I
think that happens every day.

00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:40.470
I mean not only on gaming
with the communities,

00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:43.630
also in real life with your
partner, with your employees,

00:36:43.630 --> 00:36:45.150
with your peers.

00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:47.190
I mean at the end,
we agree to disagree.

00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:50.214
And there will be some
topics and some features that

00:36:50.214 --> 00:36:51.630
will be suggested
by the community

00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:53.171
and just, you have
to explain to them

00:36:53.171 --> 00:36:54.500
why you took another direction.

00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:57.830
And that's all you have to do.

00:36:57.830 --> 00:36:59.172
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:36:59.172 --> 00:37:00.130
DAVE GEFFON: Excellent.

00:37:00.130 --> 00:37:02.260
So thanks everyone for
attending the panel.

00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:04.480
Coming up next, Sarah
Thomson is going

00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:06.767
to lead a panel on
true indie stories.

00:37:06.767 --> 00:37:08.850
So you'll want to stick
around and check that out.

00:37:08.850 --> 00:37:11.680
But first let's give it up for
Kristian, Andrew, and Andres.

00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:12.880
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:16.230
[MUSIC PLAYING]
