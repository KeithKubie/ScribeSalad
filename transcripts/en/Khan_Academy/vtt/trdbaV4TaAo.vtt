00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:02.660
I don't think it's
any secret that if one

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:04.285
were to do any kind
of science, they're

00:00:04.285 --> 00:00:06.035
going to be dealing
with a lot of numbers.

00:00:06.035 --> 00:00:08.340
It doesn't matter whether
you do biology, or chemistry,

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.490
or physics, numbers
are involved.

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.420
And in many cases, the
numbers are very large.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.760
They are very,
very large numbers.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.036
Very large numbers.

00:00:22.036 --> 00:00:26.220
Or, they're very, small,
very small numbers.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.000
Very small numbers.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.990
You could imagine some
very large numbers.

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.770
If I were to ask
you, how many atoms

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:33.990
are there in the human body?

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.400
Or how cells are
in the human body?

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.180
Or the mass of the
Earth, in kilograms,

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.440
those are very large numbers.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.010
If I were to ask you
the mass of an electron,

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.777
that would be a very,
very small number.

00:00:47.777 --> 00:00:50.360
So any kind of science, you're
going to be dealing with these.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.670
And just as an example,
let me show you

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.794
one of the most common
numbers you're going to see,

00:00:53.794 --> 00:00:54.870
in especially chemistry.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.450
It's called Avogadro's number.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.840
Avogadro's number.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.110
And if I were write it in just
the standard way of writing

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.090
a number, it would
literally be written

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.380
as-- do it in a new color.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.880
It would be 6022-- and
then another 20 zeroes.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:21.222
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,

00:01:21.222 --> 00:01:23.290
18, 19, 20.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.320
And even I were to throw
some commas in here,

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.111
it's not going to really
help the situation

00:01:27.111 --> 00:01:29.260
to make it more readable.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.990
Let me throw some
commas in here.

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.860
This is still a huge number.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.940
If I have to write this
on a piece of paper

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.582
or if I were to publish some
paper on using Avogadro's

00:01:38.582 --> 00:01:40.540
number, it would take me
forever to write this.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.400
And even more, it's hard to
tell if I forgot to write a zero

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.420
or if I maybe wrote
too many zeroes.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:47.840
So there's a problem here.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.220
Is there a better
way to write this?

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.680
So is there a better
way to write this

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.490
than to write it
all out like this?

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.220
To write literally the 6
followed by the 23 digits,

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.190
or the 6022 followed
by the 20 zeroes there?

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.122
And to answer that
question-- and in case

00:02:07.122 --> 00:02:08.830
you're curious,
Avogadro's number, if you

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.230
had 12 grams of
carbon, especially

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.312
12 grams of carbon-12,
this is how many atoms

00:02:14.312 --> 00:02:15.270
you would have in that.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.110
And just so you know, 12 grams
is like a 50th of a pound.

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.110
So that just gives you
an idea of how many atoms

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.330
are laying around at
any point in time.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:23.864
This is a huge number.

00:02:23.864 --> 00:02:26.030
The point of here isn't to
teach you some chemistry.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.360
The point of here is to
talk about an easier way

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.470
to write this.

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.960
And the easier way to write this
we call scientific notation.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:40.820
Scientific notation.

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.517
And take my word
for it, although it

00:02:42.517 --> 00:02:44.600
might be a little unnatural
for you at this video.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.360
It really is an easier
way to write things

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.170
like things like that.

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.020
Before I show you
how to do it, let

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.650
me show you the
underlying theory

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.700
behind scientific notation.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.470
If I were to tell you,
what is 10 to the 0 power?

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.070
We know that's equal to 1.

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.040
What is 10 to the 1 power?

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.380
That's equal to 10.

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.220
What's 10 squared?

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.440
That's 10 times 10.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.130
That's 100.

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.270
What is 10 to the third?

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:14.750
10 to the third is
10 times 10 times 10,

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.940
which is equal to 1,000.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.950
I think you see a
general pattern here.

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.810
10 to the 0 has no 0's.

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.900
No 0's in it.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.800
10 to the 1 has one 0.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.330
10 to the second power-- I was
going to say the two-th power.

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.360
10 to the second
power has two 0's.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.309
Finally, 10 to the
third has three 0's.

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:40.850
Don't want to beat
a dead horse here,

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:42.058
but I think you get the idea.

00:03:42.058 --> 00:03:44.750
Three 0's.

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.790
If I were to do 10
to the 100th power,

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.341
what would that look like?

00:03:50.341 --> 00:03:52.090
I don't feel like
writing it all out here,

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.970
but it would be 1 followed
by-- you could guess it--

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:56.960
a hundred 0's.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.190
So it would just
be a bunch of 0's.

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.060
And if we were to count
up all of those 0's, you

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.170
would have one hundred
0's right there.

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.580
And actually, this might be
interesting, just as an aside.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.810
You may or may not know
what this number is called.

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.210
This is called a googol.

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:17.660
A googol.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.646
In the early '90s if someone
said, hey, that's a googol,

00:04:21.646 --> 00:04:23.520
you wouldn't have thought
of a search engine.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.530
You would have thought
of the number 10

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:30.630
to the 100th power,
which is a huge number.

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.590
It's more than the
number of atoms,

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.590
or the estimated number of
atoms, in the known universe.

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:38.940
In the known universe.

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.260
It raises the question of
what else is there out there.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.500
But I was reading up on
this not too long ago.

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.820
And if I remember correctly,
the known universe

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:53.381
has the order of 10 to the
79th to 10 to the 81 atoms.

00:04:53.381 --> 00:04:54.630
And this is, of course, rough.

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:55.680
No one can really count this.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.090
People are just kind
of estimating it.

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:58.548
Or even better,
guesstimating this.

00:04:58.548 --> 00:05:00.044
But this is a huge number.

00:05:00.044 --> 00:05:01.710
What may be even more
interesting to you

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.540
is this number was the
motivation behind the naming

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.685
a very popular search
engine-- Google.

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.160
Google is essentially
just a misspelling

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.399
of the word "googol"
with the O-L.

00:05:15.399 --> 00:05:17.190
And I don't know why
they called it Google.

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:18.790
Maybe they got the domain name.

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:22.070
Maybe they want to hold
this much information.

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.000
Maybe that many
bytes of information.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.700
Or, it's just a cool word.

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.450
Whatever it is-- maybe it was
the founder's favorite number.

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:29.700
But it's a cool thing to know.

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.320
But anyway, I'm digressing.

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:32.060
This is a googol.

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:33.500
It's just 1 with a hundred 0's.

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.060
But I could equivalently have
just written that as 10 to 100,

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.200
which is clearly an easier way.

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.160
This is an easier
way to write this.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.094
This is easier.

00:05:44.094 --> 00:05:46.260
In fact, this is so hard
to write that I didn't even

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:47.190
take the trouble to write it.

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:48.481
It would have taken me forever.

00:05:48.481 --> 00:05:50.210
This was just twenty
0's right here.

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:53.320
A hundred 0's I would
have filled up this screen

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.610
and you have found it boring.

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:55.693
So I didn't even write it.

00:05:55.693 --> 00:05:57.560
So clearly, this
is easier to write.

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:03.710
This is just good
for powers of 10.

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:05.800
But how can we
write something that

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.490
isn't a direct power of 10?

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.400
How can we use the power
of this simplicity?

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.510
How can we use the power
of the simplicity somehow?

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:18.140
And to do that, you just
need to make the realization.

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:20.610
This number, we
can write it as--

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:22.220
so this has how
many digits in it?

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:26.430
It has 1, 2, 3, and
then twenty 0's.

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:30.880
So it has 23 digits after the 6.

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.430
23 digits after the 6.

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:37.150
So what happens if I use this--
if I try to get close to it

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:39.020
with a power of 10?

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:41.420
So what if I were
to say 10 to the 23?

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:43.170
Do it in this magenta.

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:44.775
10 to the 23rd power.

00:06:44.775 --> 00:06:45.650
That's equal to what?

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:48.450
That equals 1 with 23 0's.

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:57.142
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,

00:06:57.142 --> 00:06:59.480
18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.280
You get the idea,
that's 10 to the 23rd.

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:04.920
Now, can we somehow
write this guy

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:08.080
as some multiple of this guy?

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:08.690
Well, we can.

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:13.931
Because if we multiplied
this guy by 6--

00:07:13.931 --> 00:07:18.410
if we multiply 6 times 10
to the 23rd, what do we get?

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:21.000
Well, we're just going to have
a 6 with twenty three 0's.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.020
We're going to have a 6, and
then you're going to have

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:25.090
twenty three 0's.

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:25.840
Let me write that.

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.947
You're going to have
twenty three 0's like that.

00:07:27.947 --> 00:07:29.780
Because all I did, if
you take 6 times this.

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:30.821
You know how to multiply.

00:07:30.821 --> 00:07:32.240
You'd have the 6 times this 1.

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:32.960
You'd get a 6.

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.920
And then all the 6 times
the 0's will all be 0.

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:37.650
So you'll have 6 followed
by twenty three 0's.

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:38.960
So that's pretty useful.

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:41.190
But still, we're not getting
quite to this number.

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:43.600
I mean, this had
some 2's in there.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.350
So how could we do it
a little bit better?

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:46.975
Well, what if we
wrote it as a decimal?

00:07:46.975 --> 00:07:51.240
This number right here is
identical to this number

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:52.920
if these 2's were 0's.

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:55.690
But if we want to put those
2's there, what can we do?

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:57.600
We could put some decimals here.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:02.570
We could say that this is the
same thing as 6.022 times 10

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:03.770
to the 23rd.

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:06.860
And now, this number is
identical to this number,

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:08.920
but it's a much easier
way to write it.

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:10.542
And you could verify
it, if you like.

00:08:10.542 --> 00:08:11.750
It will take you a long time.

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:13.870
Maybe we should do it with
a smaller number first.

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:18.080
But if you multiply 6.022
times 10 to the 23rd,

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.870
and you write it all out,
you will get this number

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:21.390
right there.

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:23.403
You will get Avogadro's number.

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:29.516
Avogadro's number.

00:08:29.516 --> 00:08:31.890
And although this is complicated
or it looks a little bit

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:34.350
unintuitive to you at first,
this was just a number

00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:35.220
written out.

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:37.542
This has a multiplication
and then a 10 to a power.

00:08:37.542 --> 00:08:39.250
You might say, hey,
that's not so simple.

00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:40.390
But it really is.

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:43.690
Because you immediately
know how many 0's there are.

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:46.755
And it's obviously
a much shorter way

00:08:46.755 --> 00:08:47.630
to write this number.

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:49.110
Let's do a couple of more.

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:51.230
I started with Avogadro's
number because it really

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:54.759
shows you the need for
a scientific notation.

00:08:54.759 --> 00:08:56.550
So you don't have to
write things like that

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:57.530
over and over again.

00:08:57.530 --> 00:08:59.113
So let's do a couple
of other numbers.

00:08:59.113 --> 00:09:01.940
And we'll just write them
in scientific notation.

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:09.130
So let's say I have
the number 7,345.

00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:11.910
And I wanted to write it
in scientific notation.

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:18.030
So I guess the best way to
think about it is, it's 7,345.

00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:20.470
So how can I
represent a thousand?

00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:23.530
Well, I wrote it over here,
10 to the third is 1,000.

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:28.480
So we know that 10 to the
third is equal to 1,000.

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.870
So that's essentially
the largest power of 10

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:32.070
that I can fit into this.

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:33.600
This is seven 1,000's.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.880
So if this is seven 1,000's,
and then it's 0.3 1,00's, then

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:39.790
it's 0.4 1,000's-- I don't
know if that helps you,

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:45.950
we can write this as 7.345
times 10 to the third

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:49.460
because it's going to be seven
1,000's plus 0.3 1,000's.

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:51.640
What's 0.3 times 1,000?

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:53.270
0.3 times 1,000 is 300.

00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:55.550
What's 0.04 times 1,000?

00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:56.150
That's 40.

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:58.420
What's 0.05 times 1,000?

00:09:58.420 --> 00:09:59.170
That's a 5.

00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:05.870
So 7.345 times 1,000
is equal to 7,345.

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:09.450
Let me multiply it out
just to make it clear.

00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:15.190
So if I took 7.345 times 1,000.

00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:17.420
The way I do it is
I ignore the 0's.

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:21.130
I essentially multiply 1
times that guy up there.

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:24.890
So I get 7, 3, 4, 5.

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:28.090
Then I had three 0's here,
so I put those on the end.

00:10:28.090 --> 00:10:30.000
And then I have
three decimal places.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:30.890
1, 2, 3.

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:31.890
So 1, 2, 3.

00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:33.470
Put the decimal right there.

00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:40.270
And there you have it, 7.345
times 1,000 is indeed 7,345.

00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:41.354
Let's do a couple of them.

00:10:41.354 --> 00:10:42.978
Let's say we wanted
to write the number

00:10:42.978 --> 00:10:44.360
6 in scientific notation.

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:46.818
Obviously, there's no need to
write in scientific notation.

00:10:46.818 --> 00:10:47.950
But how would you do it?

00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:51.390
Well, what's the largest
power of 10 that fits into 6?

00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:54.540
Well, the largest power of 10
that fits into 6 is just 1.

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:59.180
So we could write it as
something times 10 to the 0.

00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:00.670
This is just 1, right?

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:01.910
That's just 1.

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:03.640
So 6 is what times 1?

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:04.940
Well, it's just 6.

00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:07.180
So 6 is equal to 6
times 10 to the 0.

00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:10.360
You wouldn't actually
have to write it this way.

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:12.023
This is much simpler,
but it shows you

00:11:12.023 --> 00:11:17.270
that you really can express any
number in scientific notation.

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:20.370
Now, what if we wanted to
represent something like this?

00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:22.850
I had started off the
video saying in science

00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:26.630
you deal with very large
and very small numbers.

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:29.940
So let's say you had the
number-- do it in this color.

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:33.280
And you had 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:35.660
And then, let's say five 0's.

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:38.760
And then you have
followed by a 7.

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:41.210
Well, once again, this is not
an easy number to deal with.

00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:44.050
But how can we deal with
it as a power of 10?

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:45.450
As a power of 10?

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:48.605
So what's the largest power of
10 that fits into this number,

00:11:48.605 --> 00:11:50.850
that this number
is divisible by?

00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:51.850
So let's think about it.

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:54.870
All the powers of 10 we did
before were going to positive

00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:57.790
or going to-- well, yeah,
positive powers of 10.

00:11:57.790 --> 00:11:59.890
We could also do
negative powers of 10.

00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:01.730
We know that 10 to the 0 is 1.

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:02.940
Let's start there.

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:08.985
10 to the minus 1 is equal to
1/10, which is equal to 0.1.

00:12:08.985 --> 00:12:09.860
Let me switch colors.

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:11.030
I'll do pink.

00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:15.430
10 to the minus 2 is equal
to 1 over 10 squared, which

00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:20.610
is equal to 1/100,
which is equal to 0.01.

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:23.639
And you I think you get the
idea that the--, well, let

00:12:23.639 --> 00:12:25.680
me just do one more so
that you can get the idea.

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:27.266
10 to the minus 3.

00:12:27.266 --> 00:12:31.880
10 to the minus 3 is equal
to 1 over 10 to the third,

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:37.300
which is equal to 1/1,000,
which is equal to the 0.001.

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:39.640
So the general pattern
here is 10 to the whatever

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:42.780
negative power is however
many places you're

00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:44.430
going to have behind
the decimal point.

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:46.440
So here, it's not
the number of 0's.

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:48.390
In here, 10 to the
minus 3, you only

00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:50.390
have two 0's but you
have three places

00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:52.290
behind the decimal point.

00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:56.150
So what is the largest power
of 10 that goes into this?

00:12:56.150 --> 00:13:00.032
Well, how many places behind
the decimal point do I have?

00:13:00.032 --> 00:13:04.460
I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:09.100
So 10 to the minus 6 is
going to be equal to 0.--

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:10.619
and we're going
to have six places

00:13:10.619 --> 00:13:11.660
behind the decimal point.

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:14.580
And the last place
is going to be a 1.

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:17.220
So you're going to
have Five 0's and a 1.

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:19.790
That's 10 to the minus 6.

00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:23.290
Now, this number right here
is 7 times this number.

00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:29.120
If we multiply this times
7, we get 7 times 1.

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:31.959
And then we have 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6 numbers

00:13:31.959 --> 00:13:33.000
behind the decimal point.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.710
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:40.950
So this number times 7 is
clearly equal to the number

00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:42.490
that we started off with.

00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:46.280
So we can rewrite this number.

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:48.570
Instead of writing
this number every time,

00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:51.410
we can write it as being
equal to this number.

00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:53.090
Or, we could write it as 7.

00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:55.604
This is equal to 7
times this number.

00:13:55.604 --> 00:13:57.520
But this number is no
better than that number.

00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:00.320
But this number is the same
thing as 10 to the minus 6.

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:03.640
7 times 10 to the minus 6.

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:07.170
So now you can imagine
numbers like-- imagine

00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:10.570
the number-- what
if we had a 7-- let

00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:12.700
me think of it this way.

00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:16.630
Let's say we had
a 7, 3 over there.

00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:17.830
So what would we do?

00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:19.850
Well, we'd want to
go to the first digit

00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:23.730
right here because this is
kind of the largest power of 10

00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:25.714
that could go into
this thing right here.

00:14:25.714 --> 00:14:27.380
So if we wanted to
represent that thing,

00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:30.330
let me do another decimal
that's like that one.

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:35.990
So let's say I did 0.0000516
and I wanted to represent this

00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:38.010
in scientific notation.

00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:40.370
I'd go to the
first non-digit 0--

00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:45.970
the first non-zero digit, not
non-digit 0, which is there.

00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:47.970
And I'm like, OK, what's
the largest power of 10

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:48.970
that will fit into that?

00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:52.770
So I'll go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:57.230
So it's going to
be equal to 5.16.

00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:59.400
So I take 5 there,
then everything else

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:01.180
is going to be behind
the decimal point.

00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:02.505
Times 10.

00:15:02.505 --> 00:15:04.630
So this is going to be the
largest power of 10 that

00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:07.500
fits into this first
non-zero number.

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:09.740
So it's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:12.790
So 10 to the minus 5 power.

00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:13.950
Let me do another example.

00:15:13.950 --> 00:15:17.260
So the point I wanted to make
is you just go to the first--

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.930
if you're starting at the left,
the first non-zero number.

00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:22.040
That's what you get
your power from.

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:23.700
That's where i got
my 10 to the minus 5

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:25.740
because I counted 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:28.380
You got to count that number
just like we did over here.

00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:31.040
And then, everything else
will be behind the decimal.

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:33.210
Let me do another example.

00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:35.370
Let's say I had 0.-- and
my wife always point out

00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:37.620
that I have to write a 0 in
front of my decimal points

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:38.580
because she's a doctor.

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:40.330
And if people don't
see the decimal point,

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:42.420
someone might overdose
on some medication.

00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:52.350
So let's write it her
way, 0.0000000008192.

00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:54.800
Clearly, this is a super
cumbersome number to write.

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:56.850
And you might forget
about a 0 or add too

00:15:56.850 --> 00:15:59.310
many 0's, which could
be costly if you're

00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:01.260
doing some important
scientific research.

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.605
Or, maybe doing-- well, you
wouldn't prescribe medicine

00:16:03.605 --> 00:16:04.480
at this small a dose.

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:06.563
Or maybe you would, I don't
want to get into that.

00:16:06.563 --> 00:16:09.200
But how would I write this
in scientific notation?

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:12.220
So I start off with the
first non-zero number,

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:13.690
if I'm starting from the left.

00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:16.550
So it's going to be 8.192.

00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:21.310
I just put a decimal and write
0.192 times-- times 10 to what?

00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:23.040
Well, I just count.

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:28.600
Times 10 to the 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:32.110
I have to include that
number, 10 to the minus 10.

00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:35.080
And I think you'll find
it reasonably satisfactory

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:37.890
that this number
is easier to write

00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:40.030
than that number over there.

00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:42.180
Now, and this is
another powerful thing

00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:44.430
about scientific notation.

00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:45.934
Let's say I have
these two numbers

00:16:45.934 --> 00:16:47.100
and I want to multiply them.

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:53.810
Let's say I want to multiply the
number 0.005 times the number

00:16:53.810 --> 00:16:58.540
0.0008.

00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:01.630
This is actually a fairly
straightforward one to do,

00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:04.155
but sometimes it can
get quite cumbersome.

00:17:04.155 --> 00:17:06.500
And especially if you're
dealing with twenty or thirty

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:08.849
0's on either sides
of the decimal point.

00:17:08.849 --> 00:17:10.740
Put a 0 here to
make my wife happy.

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:12.490
But when you do it in
scientific notation,

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:14.069
it will actually simplify it.

00:17:14.069 --> 00:17:18.420
This guy can be rewritten
as 5 times 10 to the what?

00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:20.690
I have 1, 2, 3 spaces
behind the decimal.

00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:21.960
10 to the third.

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:25.560
And then this is 8, so
this is times 8 times

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:29.704
10 to the-- sorry, this is
5 times 10 to the minus 3.

00:17:29.704 --> 00:17:30.620
That's very important.

00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:33.380
5 times 10 to the 3
would have been 5,000.

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:34.909
Be very careful about that.

00:17:34.909 --> 00:17:36.200
Now, what is this guy equal to?

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:39.740
This is 1, 2, 3, 4 places
behind the decimal.

00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:44.567
So it's 8 times
10 to the minus 4.

00:17:44.567 --> 00:17:46.150
If we're multiplying
these two things,

00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:49.870
this is the same thing as
5 times 10 to the minus 3

00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:52.950
times 8 times 10 to the minus 4.

00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:55.200
There's nothing special about
the scientific notation.

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:56.820
It literally means
what it's saying.

00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:59.070
So for multiplying, you
could write it out like this.

00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:01.610
And multiplication,
order doesn't matter.

00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:05.460
So I could rewrite
this as 5 times 8 times

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:09.200
10 to the minus 3 times
10 to the minus 4.

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:11.860
And then, what is 5 times 8?

00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:15.900
5 times 8 we know is 40.

00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:20.830
So it's 40 times 10 to the
minus 3 times 10 to the minus 4.

00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:22.330
And if you know
your exponent rules,

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:24.620
you know that when you
multiply two numbers that

00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:27.400
have the same base, you can
just add their exponents.

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:29.820
So you just add the
minus 3 and the minus 4.

00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:35.080
So it's equal to 40
times 10 to the minus 7.

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:36.160
Let's do another example.

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:39.580
Let's say we were to
multiply Avogadro's number.

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:44.230
So we know that's 6.022
times 10 to the 23rd.

00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:47.740
Now, let's say we multiply that
times some really small number.

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:57.900
So times, say, 7.23
times 10 to the minus 22.

00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:59.530
So this is some
really small number.

00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:02.071
You're going to have a decimal,
and then you're going to have

00:19:02.071 --> 00:19:02.980
twenty one 0's.

00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:05.180
Then you're going ti
have a 7 and a 2 and a 3.

00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:07.260
So this is a really
small number.

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:09.990
But the multiplication, when you
do it in scientific notation,

00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:12.050
is actually fairly
straightforward.

00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:16.490
This is going to be equal to
6.0-- let me write it properly.

00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:24.920
6.022 times 10 to the 23rd times
7.23 times 10 to the minus 22.

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:32.570
We can change the order, so
it's equal to 6.022 times 7.23.

00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:33.430
That's that part.

00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:35.400
So you can view it
as these first parts

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:42.540
of our scientific notation
times 10 to the 23rd times 10

00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:44.680
to the minus 22.

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:46.534
And now, this is--
you're going to do

00:19:46.534 --> 00:19:48.450
some little decimal
multiplication right here.

00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:52.600
It's going to be-- some
number-- 40 something, I think.

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:54.140
I can't do this one in my head.

00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:56.040
But this part is pretty
easy to calculate.

00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:58.620
I'll just leave
this the way it is.

00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:00.990
But this part right
here, this will be times.

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:02.820
10 to the 23rd times
10 to the minus 22.

00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:03.944
You just add the exponents.

00:20:03.944 --> 00:20:07.125
You get times 10
to the first power.

00:20:07.125 --> 00:20:09.250
And then this number,
whatever it's going to equal,

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:10.708
I'll just leave it
out here since I

00:20:10.708 --> 00:20:12.140
don't have a calculator.

00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:13.370
0.23.

00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:15.490
Let's see, it will be 7.2.

00:20:15.490 --> 00:20:17.820
Let's see, 0.2 times--
it's like a fifth.

00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:19.400
It'll be like 41-something.

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:25.170
So this is approximately
41 times 10 to the 1.

00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:27.020
Or, another way
is approximately--

00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:29.430
it's going to be 410-something.

00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:31.220
And to get it
right, you just have

00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:33.310
to actually perform
this multiplication.

00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:36.210
So hopefully you see that
scientific notation is, one,

00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:39.940
really useful for super large
and super small numbers.

00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:42.400
And not only is it more
useful to kind of understand

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:43.950
the numbers and to
write the numbers,

00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:46.875
but it also simplifies
operating on the numbers.
