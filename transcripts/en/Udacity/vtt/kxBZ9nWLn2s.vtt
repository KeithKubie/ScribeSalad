00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.520
What do you think, David?

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:04.440
&gt;&gt; So I said that four of them
could represent a 3D object.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:05.640
This could be a cylinder.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.210
This is some kind of trapezoidal prism,

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.480
and this kind of looks like a pyramid
from above with the top blocked off.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.000
We gotta see this as looking
down at some kind of pyramid or

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.120
we might also see this
as looking into a box.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.740
This one is a bit of
an interesting example.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.380
It doesn't as naturally lend itself
to interpretation as a 3D figure.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.970
But at the same time, we can imagine
that that's what you would get if you

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.750
looked at this figure directly down.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.120
&gt;&gt; David, it is interesting that you did
not pick this as an answer, as well.

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.240
I guess I would have picked that one.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.070
I see this as an x-axis,
the y-axis, and the z-axis.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.523
And because all three axis
can be identified here,

00:00:40.523 --> 00:00:44.500
I would have thought of this, too,
as an example of a 3D object.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.260
&gt;&gt; That's interesting, Ashok.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.080
Now that you mention it,
I can't stop seeing it as a 3D object.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.040
Now I see it as kind of a folded
piece of paper that just has a line

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.770
drawn at the center.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.980
Initially, I don't think I
looked at that as a 3D object,

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.580
because I saw the lines as having to
represent places where the figure

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.800
folded or where different planes met.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.840
But if we look at the line at the middle
as just kind of something drawn

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.460
on the figure, it immediately
pops out as a 3D object for me.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.760
&gt;&gt; And this brings us to
the point of this exercise.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.920
The point of the exercise is that
clearly some kind of processing is

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.920
agreeing in our visual system.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.470
That allows us to group these lines and
these surfaces in ways.

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.360
So that we can identify which
one of them is a 3D object, and

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.760
which one of them is not a 3D object.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.205
Clearly, this processing is
not completely definitive,

00:01:28.205 --> 00:01:31.190
in that sometimes it is ambiguity.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.060
You might come up with one answer to
this, and someone else may come up with

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.720
a slightly different to this because the
processing leaves room for ambiguity.
