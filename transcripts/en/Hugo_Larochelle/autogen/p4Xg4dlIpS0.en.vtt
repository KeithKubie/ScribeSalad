00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.850
 in this capsule we will look at the 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.259
 different types of environments that 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.320
 can meet in intelligence 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.650
 artificial 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.940
 so how do we live in the model near 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.670
 among other things is the notion 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.660
 of environment we have distinguished where we have 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.279
 rather a meryl 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.900
 what are the elements that can 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.600
 belong the environment in the 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.189
 context a given application what 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.570
 will be particularly practical 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.150
 when come the time to identify 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.720
 what intelligence algorithms 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.489
 artificial 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.520
 we will want to use for a 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.649
 given application it's going to be from 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.540
 distinguish which types of environment 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.600
 and specifically what are the 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.879
 properties of the environment to which one 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.809
 faces then what are these properties 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:51.860
 lake we will look in this capsule 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:54.899
 we will distinguish among others six 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:57.329
 properties or type of environment one 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.969
 going to talk about environment completely 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.100
 observed observable forgiveness versus 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.229
 partially observable environment 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.720
 deterministic versus stochastic 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.119
 the episodic environment versus 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.970
 sequential static environment 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.189
 versus discrete environment dynamics 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.439
 versus continuous and finally 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.409
 of single agent versus 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.930
 multi-agents let's look at these different 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:27.450
 types or properties in the environment 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:28.500
 so both as the property we are going 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.110
 say that an environment is 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.630
 completely observable 6 thanks to its 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.360
 sensors the agent access to the complete state 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.810
 of the environment at every moment everything 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.250
 throughout his life for example 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.649
 the environment associated with a game 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.770
 chess is completely observable 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:50.549
 since the position of all the parts 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:53.250
 of the game is constantly known to age in 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:57.840
 has none that are hidden is observable 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:02:00.659
 by the opposite player in the code of 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.979
 poker game ben it's an environment 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.310
 partially observable because between 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:08.369
 other one of the players does not know the 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.679
 cards in the hands of his opponent 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.690
 so according to information that is not 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.170
 accessible to the agent so 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:19.840
 the environment is partially 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:22.840
 observable then we have 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.390
 deterministic environments that these are 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.510
 environments where the following rates 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.820
 of the environment is entirely 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.280
 determined by the state runners and 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.980
 the action that is performed by the 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.860
 agents so an example not yet a 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.270
 times with the chess game it's a 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.610
 environment that is going to be deterministic 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:45.130
 if a determined player who wants to move 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.000
 a room that will necessarily give the 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.660
 same result 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.620
 there will not be a random aspect the 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.290
 moving the piece will be able to the 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:56.620
 move exactly where he wants noting 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:03:00.160
 that it respects the rules of the game is to 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.720
 the opposite in a poker game like a 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.520
 once we're going to talk about an environment 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.200
 which stochastic among others because 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.910
 distribution of cards to players 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.820
 is done randomly what makes 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.590
 that given the configuration of the game 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.850
 the cards that I slept even well in 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.710
 two different parts I'm going 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.860
 possibly obtain as a card 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:19.560
 next two cards that are going to be 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.060
 different 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.010
 an important note to identify on 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.710
 the environment and deterministic or not 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.050
 we consider that the renault 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:30.880
 stochastic 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:32.530
 if the phenomena can not be 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:36.130
 predicted perfectly so is so a 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:38.890
 aspect finally in the environment 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:41.290
 however, we do not take into account 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.940
 actions of other agents for 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.080
 determine whether deterministic or not so 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.460
 among other things in the game code 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.830
 chess even if we are not able 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:50.170
 to predict exactly what the other 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:52.510
 opponent the other agent could do 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:55.180
 like action we do not consider that 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:58.600
 as part of the environment 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.710
 the arranged one aspect is paris and the 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.590
 we can not predict 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:05.080
 his strategy is not that 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:07.030
 the environment him and stochastic so 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.950
 we do not want to finally consider our 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.350
 ability to predict what the opponent 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.970
 will do to the port as a factor 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:17.200
 to determine whether the environment and 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:20.620
 deterministic or not even 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.000
 episodic environments versus 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.470
 sequential so in the camp 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.030
 episodic operations the 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.610
 money behaviors are divided 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.870
 is 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:31.789
 it's among others every episode goes 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:35.379
 match to observe the environment 

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:38.300
 then did a single action and 

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:41.659
 crucially this action is not going 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:46.069
 influence the environment that is going to be 

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:47.870
 observed in the next episode so a 

00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:49.669
 example would be a context of 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.860
 character recognition where we 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:53.889
 hostage to the image of a 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.680
 character then this one has to determine 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:59.479
 what character does it correspond to 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.460
 its actually character detection 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:05.449
 the traits to which letter of the alphabet 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:07.159
 corresponds the image that corresponds to 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:09.529
 the image of a character drawn by 

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:12.349
 someone so in this case also the 

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:14.389
 system prediction will not influence 

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:16.159
 what is the next character that the 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:18.080
 system must be to recognize 

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:20.120
 so we are in the code of a 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.750
 episode during an environment 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:25.159
 episodic 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:26.509
 on the other hand in the case of poker and 

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:29.629
 would also be true in the code of 

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:32.240
 chess game but our actions he will come 

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:33.770
 obviously an impact on in what 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.889
 environment will end up that layton 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:39.500
 have really found in the next step 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:43.219
 among others to continue to a day 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:44.960
 why you have to put a bet if not 

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:46.759
 part or at least this round does 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.370
 stop for us who so clearly 

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:51.979
 a notion of dependency of states of 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:54.370
 the environment between different in one 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:54.370
 given time 

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:02.420
 we will also talk about an environment 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:06.600
 static if the environment does not change 

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:09.240
 when the agent (s) therefore do not act 

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:11.400
 an example is the game of chess game 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:14.850
 chess and static ie 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:16.170
 the game state the game configuration does not 

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:18.690
 change yet so long that 

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:20.880
 no one played the reverse in the 

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:24.540
 play of the ball the ball she continues to 

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:25.800
 move even if the player moves him 

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:27.230
 not his palette on it to try to 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:30.300
 block the ball 

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:33.030
 he notes important again we do not 

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:34.950
 will not take into account the actions of 

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:36.210
 other rage to determine if a 

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:38.130
 static environment or not it's up to 

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:39.960
 to say that it is correct 

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:42.840
 we are still in an environment 

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:43.680
 static if the other agent can change 

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:46.440
 the environment 

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:48.060
 so we're really interested in this case 

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.770
 also to identify static or not 

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:52.560
 is the environment changing 

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:58.230
 when none of the agents move you 

00:06:52.560 --> 00:07:00.540
 do anything we will then say 

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:03.570
 that the environment is unobtrusive if the 

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:07.500
 number of sensory data and 

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:10.530
 action is limited and buried râble 

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:13.020
 so distinct from a chess gift 

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:14.880
 we actually have an environment that 

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:17.070
 is discreet that is to say that all 

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:19.080
 possible actions and states of the game 

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:21.360
 can be listed there is one 

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:22.980
 very very serious exponential number 

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:25.590
 but we could list them as a result 

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:27.990
 others while if we're in the 

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:29.970
 context of a taxi robot driving 

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:31.350
 automatically car but we would 

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:35.100
 rather in a continuous environment 

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:37.730
 because between the angle of not knowing how to fly 

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:42.000
 here it's flying here 

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:44.670
 and as for the number and for example the 

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.050
 game pong also we could say that 

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:47.700
 it's the continuous environment because 

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:51.210
 the position of the ball is finally a 

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:54.530
 position xy mutzig rection would count 

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:54.530
 to many continues 

00:07:57.729 --> 00:08:02.270
 then we will distinguish 

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:04.220
 Single Agent Versus 

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:06.770
 multi-agents in the case of an agent 

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:08.600
 unique is that we have one agent who 

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:09.229
 operates so is there alone in 

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:12.490
 the environment 

00:08:09.229 --> 00:08:15.289
 an agent who solves sudokus would 

00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:17.479
 act and in an agent environment 

00:08:15.289 --> 00:08:20.419
 unique since no opponent while 

00:08:17.479 --> 00:08:23.240
 that chess game and multi agenda this 

00:08:20.419 --> 00:08:30.800
 that if two deputies two agents pardon 

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:34.250
 there is the player and his opponent there is 

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:36.560
 some cases where the border between a 

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:37.419
 property and its inverse is difficult to 

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:41.650
 identify 

00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:44.029
 so for example for the game pogne 

00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:46.190
 conceptually the position of the ball 

00:08:44.029 --> 00:08:47.930
 thought himself simple to have it as 

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:52.850
 a pair of real numbers but 

00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:54.620
 obviously in a day number in 

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:55.910
 a table we have a finite number of pixels 

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:58.160
 so technically we could list 

00:08:55.910 --> 00:09:00.770
 all positions of the bad 

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:02.750
 however since conceptually that 

00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:05.060
 is more like a number and we're going 

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:06.650
 still say in a general way that a 

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:09.410
 game like the game the pen is a player 

00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:12.589
 environment continues same thing 

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:16.070
 then for the code of moving a 

00:09:12.589 --> 00:09:18.910
 robot if the robot is alone in his 

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:22.540
 environment we can perfectly 

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:25.279
 determined is it's displacement 

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:27.459
 perfect whether alone or not 

00:09:25.279 --> 00:09:29.600
 general since the physical mechanics 

00:09:27.459 --> 00:09:32.209
 or physics that mechanics yes 

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:35.930
 deterministic there is no aspect 

00:09:32.209 --> 00:09:38.300
 stochastic however model a 

00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:41.810
 physical environment we move you 

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:43.850
 something so complex that we 

00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:46.550
 may not possibly simulate a 

00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:47.870
 perfect environment and the 

00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:49.459
 way of doing it is going to be rather of 

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:52.880
 consider that some uncertainty 

00:09:49.459 --> 00:09:55.010
 the in relation the result of the action 

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:58.310
 robots in a physical environment 

00:09:55.010 --> 00:10:00.200
 and there will normally be an aspect 

00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:03.160
 stochastic so the generation named to 

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:06.250
 thouars in a simulator of a robot 

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:09.100
 in a physical environment so in 

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:10.870
 often does a way to bring 

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:12.250
 to identify the characteristics or 

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:13.779
 properties of an environment that's 

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:16.000
 think about commenting on what 

00:10:13.779 --> 00:10:18.399
 would program or simulate this 

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.870
 environment again the robot because 

00:10:18.399 --> 00:10:21.839
 that we would not be able to do everything 

00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:23.379
 model the expectations of 

00:10:21.839 --> 00:10:26.199
 the environment in which they are 

00:10:23.379 --> 00:10:28.209
 move over to have a system based 

00:10:26.199 --> 00:10:31.779
 on equations of mechanical physics 

00:10:28.209 --> 00:10:34.240
 well determined we will rather simplify 

00:10:31.779 --> 00:10:36.310
 things with a model that is 

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:38.019
 relatively stochastic where we are going 

00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:40.480
 ask that I have some probability 

00:10:38.019 --> 00:10:41.529
 that the movement of a robot to certain 

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:44.019
 mistakes because they do not control 

00:10:41.529 --> 00:10:46.480
 perfectly these movements so so 

00:10:44.019 --> 00:10:50.160
 really when we start thinking about 

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:52.689
 comment on what characterizes a 

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:54.519
 environment but in fact we think 

00:10:52.689 --> 00:10:56.800
 to comment on this sad supplement this 

00:10:54.519 --> 00:11:00.459
 environment the machine if we equate 

00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:02.949
 ray or as part of a robot too 

00:11:00.459 --> 00:11:05.649
 is really it was a software agent 

00:11:02.949 --> 00:11:08.949
 who is actually in a in a 

00:11:05.649 --> 00:11:10.269
 simulated environment so think about 

00:11:08.949 --> 00:11:11.800
 how do we say we will implement 

00:11:10.269 --> 00:11:15.420
 identify which are the 

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:15.420
 properties of the environment
