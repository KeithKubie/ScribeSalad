of ways i think the aspect of technology
 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:18.839
of ways i think the aspect of technology
that is going to revolutionize the way

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:18.849
that is going to revolutionize the way

that is going to revolutionize the way
we deliver care and it's not just that

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539
we deliver care and it's not just that
 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.929
we deliver care and it's not just that
we will be able to collect information

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:24.939
we will be able to collect information
 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:28.950
we will be able to collect information
it's that everyone involved in the

healthcare enterprise will be able to
 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:33.020
healthcare enterprise will be able to
use that information more effectively

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030
use that information more effectively
 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.260
use that information more effectively
the patient will be able to manage their

actually improve the quality of care by
 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:31.260
actually improve the quality of care by
focusing on outcomes focusing on the

focusing on outcomes focusing on the
 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.539
focusing on outcomes focusing on the
things that they can do as healthcare

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549
things that they can do as healthcare
 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:36.569
things that they can do as healthcare
providers to improve the probability of

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:36.579
providers to improve the probability of
 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:38.849
providers to improve the probability of
those positive outcomes occurring

00:01:38.849 --> 00:01:38.859
those positive outcomes occurring
 

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:41.969
those positive outcomes occurring
increasingly we know that we're going to

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979
increasingly we know that we're going to
 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.029
increasingly we know that we're going to
have multiple medical conditions and the

00:01:45.029 --> 00:01:45.039
have multiple medical conditions and the
 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:48.629
have multiple medical conditions and the
person who's got the greatest incentive

00:01:48.629 --> 00:01:48.639
person who's got the greatest incentive
 

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:51.989
person who's got the greatest incentive
to manage those conditions is the

00:01:51.989 --> 00:01:51.999
to manage those conditions is the
 

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:54.749
to manage those conditions is the
patient him or herself the personalized

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:54.759
patient him or herself the personalized
 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:57.659
patient him or herself the personalized
medical record will provide an critical

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:57.669
medical record will provide an critical
 

00:01:57.669 --> 00:01:59.789
medical record will provide an critical
tool to be able to do that much more

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799
tool to be able to do that much more
 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:01.559
tool to be able to do that much more
effectively than we've been able to do

00:02:01.559 --> 00:02:01.569
effectively than we've been able to do
 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:05.129
effectively than we've been able to do
it in the past in several cities where

00:02:05.129 --> 00:02:05.139
it in the past in several cities where
 

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:08.969
it in the past in several cities where
we have investments in the form of

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979
we have investments in the form of
 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.850
we have investments in the form of
grants we're beginning to see that all

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860
grants we're beginning to see that all
 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.970
grants we're beginning to see that all
of the major healthcare providers in

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980
of the major healthcare providers in
 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.170
of the major healthcare providers in
that region are using a common platform

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180
that region are using a common platform
 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.430
that region are using a common platform
for sharing medical and

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440
for sharing medical and
 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.910
for sharing medical and
mation so what that means is that if a

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920
mation so what that means is that if a
 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.850
mation so what that means is that if a
patient goes into the emergency room the

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860
patient goes into the emergency room the
 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.940
patient goes into the emergency room the
people in the emergency room can

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950
people in the emergency room can
 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.660
people in the emergency room can
immediately call up onto a screen the

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670
immediately call up onto a screen the
 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.220
immediately call up onto a screen the
results of the x-ray or the

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230
results of the x-ray or the
 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.370
results of the x-ray or the
electrocardiogram or the laboratory

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380
electrocardiogram or the laboratory
 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.680
electrocardiogram or the laboratory
tests that that patient got in the

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690
tests that that patient got in the
 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.540
tests that that patient got in the
hospital or in the doctor's office a

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550
hospital or in the doctor's office a
 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.420
hospital or in the doctor's office a
week ago what that does is it gives the

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430
week ago what that does is it gives the
 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.420
week ago what that does is it gives the
ability to manage that person's illness

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430
ability to manage that person's illness
 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.240
ability to manage that person's illness
in real time in a much more effective

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250
in real time in a much more effective
 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.790
in real time in a much more effective
way and to do it in a much more

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800
way and to do it in a much more
 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.020
way and to do it in a much more
cost-efficient way because you're not

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030
cost-efficient way because you're not
 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.600
cost-efficient way because you're not
duplicating tests that don't need to be

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610
duplicating tests that don't need to be
 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.090
duplicating tests that don't need to be
duplicated and you know the results of

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100
duplicated and you know the results of
 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.580
duplicated and you know the results of
those tests that that will greatly

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590
those tests that that will greatly
 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.590
those tests that that will greatly
influence the care that needs to be

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600
influence the care that needs to be
 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.500
influence the care that needs to be
delivered at that moment
