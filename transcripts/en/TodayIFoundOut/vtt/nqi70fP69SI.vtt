00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:01.360
"Swing Carcass" and 7 Other Language Facts

00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:08.440
1) The term “Swiss Army Knife” was coined
by United States soldiers after WWII.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.900
The soldiers had trouble pronouncing the original
name of “Schweizer Offiziersmesser” (Swiss

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.020
Officer’s Knife) and thus began calling
the multi-tool a “Swiss Army Knife”.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.300
The company that makes Swiss Army Knives is
Victorinox, named after the founder, Karl

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.039
Elsener’s, deceased mother, Victoria.

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.360
The “nox” part comes from the fact that
stainless steel is also known as “inox”,

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.880
which is short for the French term “inoxydable”.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.880
Karl Elsener himself was originally the owner
of a surgical equipment company.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.220
He later took over production of the original
Modell 1890 knives, which were previously

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:40.370
made in Germany.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.830
He moved the production to Switzerland and
greatly improved the design of the original

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:44.830
multi-tool.

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:48.281
His big breakthrough came when he figured
out a way to put blades on both sides of the

00:00:48.281 --> 00:00:51.620
handle using the same spring to hold both
sides in place.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.450
This allowed him to put twice as many features
into the multi-tool as was previously possible.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:01.680
2) Miss Piggy’s full name is “Pigathia
Lee”, as revealed on episode 106 and 116

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.079
of The Muppet Show.

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:08.060
‘Pigathia’ is derived from ‘Piganthius’,
which is Greek for “river of passion”.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:14.850
3) The USDA defines “bacon” as “the
cured belly of a swine carcass”… mmm swine

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:15.850
carcass…

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.119
And if you’re wondering, the difference
between bacon and salted pork or ham is primarily

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:23.450
just the composition of the brine that is
used to cure it.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.920
Brine for bacon often includes sodium nitrite,
sodium nitrate, and saltpeter (for curing

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.389
the meat); sodium ascorbate (for setting the
color, as well as speeding up the curing process);

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:35.310
and brown or maple sugar (for flavor), among
other ingredients.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.209
Brine for ham tends to have a significantly
higher concentration of sugar.

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:44.310
4) The term “latrine” comes from the Latin
“lavare”, which means “to wash”.

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.999
The earliest references to this word being
used in English goes all the way back to the

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:49.619
mid-17th century.

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.299
5) The term “toilet” comes from the French
“toilette”, meaning “dressing room”.

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.149
“Toilette” in turn derives from the French
“toile”, meaning “cloth”.

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:02.399
During the 17th century, the toilet was simply
the process of getting dressed, fixing your

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.509
hair, applying make-up and the like.

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:08.270
This gradually began to refer to the items
around where someone was groomed, such as

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:09.630
the table and powder bottles.

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.280
In the 19th century in America, this term
began referring to both the room where people

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.720
got dressed and ready for the day, as well
as the device now most commonly known as the

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:19.720
toilet.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.810
6) The standard responses to “ahoy”, when
used in nautical terms, vary depending on

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.700
who’s on the boat being hailed.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.430
If you have a commissioned officer aboard,
“aye aye” is the correct response.

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.880
If no officer is aboard, “no no” is the
correct response.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.550
If a captain of a different ship is on board,
the name of the ship is the proper response.

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.860
Finally, if an admiral is aboard the vessel,
the proper response is “flag”.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.620
7) The first known reference of the term “Pop”,
as referring to a beverage, was in 1812 in

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.610
a letter written by English poet Robert Southey.

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.850
In this letter, he also explains the term’s
origin: “Called on A. Harrison and found

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.450
he was at Carlisle, but that we were expected
to supper; excused ourselves on the necessity

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.140
of eating at the inn; supped there upon trout
and roast foul, drank some most admirable

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.760
cyder, and a new manufactory of a nectar,
between soda-water and ginger-beer, and called

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.670
pop, because ‘pop goes the cork’ when
it is drawn, and pop you would go off too,

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:28.130
if you drank too much of it.”
