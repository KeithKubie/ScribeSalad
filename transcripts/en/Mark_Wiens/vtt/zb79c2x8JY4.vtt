00:00:00.238 --> 00:00:02.055
- Good morning everyone, it's Mark Wiens.

00:00:02.055 --> 00:00:04.241
I'm in Manila, Philippines.

00:00:04.241 --> 00:00:07.052
And this is just completely random,

00:00:07.052 --> 00:00:09.705
but we are going over to
a friend's house today

00:00:09.705 --> 00:00:11.454
to eat some home-cooked...

00:00:11.454 --> 00:00:13.404
She's invited us over
to eat some home-cooked

00:00:13.404 --> 00:00:14.611
Filipino food.

00:00:14.611 --> 00:00:16.858
My mouth is watering, I'm ready to eat,

00:00:16.858 --> 00:00:19.203
and I can't wait to try some of the dishes

00:00:19.203 --> 00:00:22.536
that her mom is gonna cook for us today.

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:30.125
We are in a taxi now, on our
way to my friend's house.

00:00:30.125 --> 00:00:31.487
And her name is Edzen.

00:00:31.487 --> 00:00:33.403
This is just a completely random story.

00:00:33.403 --> 00:00:35.834
Just earlier, about one
hour earlier this morning,

00:00:35.834 --> 00:00:38.210
she wrote me a message and said,

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.507
"If you can come over to my
house, that would be great.

00:00:40.507 --> 00:00:41.869
"My mom is cooking."

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:43.840
And so, since we didn't
have anything to do today,

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:44.773
we're just...

00:00:44.773 --> 00:00:46.713
We jumped in a taxi,
we are on our way now.

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:49.203
She just sent me a photo on my phone

00:00:49.203 --> 00:00:51.194
and her mom is already cooking.

00:00:51.194 --> 00:00:52.694
Ooh, I can't wait.

00:01:13.169 --> 00:01:15.085
We are almost to her house,

00:01:15.085 --> 00:01:19.252
and her house is located in an
area of Manila called Tondo.

00:01:20.107 --> 00:01:21.785
- [Driver] Small talipapa.

00:01:21.785 --> 00:01:24.578
- [Mark] Small talipapa?
- [Driver] Small market.

00:01:24.578 --> 00:01:26.296
- [Mark] Talipapa.

00:01:26.296 --> 00:01:29.538
- I'm so happy to see you.
- [Mark] Hi.

00:01:29.538 --> 00:01:31.418
- Every morning, she goes just there.

00:01:31.418 --> 00:01:33.256
This is Mark, and Ying.
- [Ying] Hi.

00:01:33.256 --> 00:01:34.689
- But we're gonna go to our house.

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:36.302
- [Mark] Hi.

00:01:36.302 --> 00:01:37.624
Nice to meet you.

00:01:37.624 --> 00:01:38.558
That's okay.

00:01:38.558 --> 00:01:40.741
Thank you so much.

00:01:40.741 --> 00:01:41.961
(laughs)

00:01:41.961 --> 00:01:44.309
Well, thank you so much for inviting us.

00:01:44.309 --> 00:01:45.548
- I am so happy.
- [Mark] This is amazing.

00:01:45.548 --> 00:01:47.708
- It's been like what, since 2009.

00:01:47.708 --> 00:01:49.376
- Was it in 2009 or 2010?

00:01:49.376 --> 00:01:50.364
- 2009.

00:01:50.364 --> 00:01:53.674
- 2009, whoa, that's a long time ago.

00:01:53.674 --> 00:01:54.984
And we haven't seen each other since.

00:01:54.984 --> 00:01:55.858
- Yes.

00:01:55.858 --> 00:01:57.452
- And we met in Sagada.
- In Sagada, yeah.

00:01:57.452 --> 00:01:58.673
- I was traveling by myself.

00:01:58.673 --> 00:02:00.206
- Yeah, and you were eating cabbage,

00:02:00.206 --> 00:02:03.228
or some fresh fruits or vegetables.

00:02:03.228 --> 00:02:04.853
- And you were traveling with your friend.

00:02:04.853 --> 00:02:06.580
- Yeah, my best friend.

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.273
- Did we meet in the cave?

00:02:08.273 --> 00:02:09.476
I think we met in a cave, right?

00:02:09.476 --> 00:02:10.842
Or did we go together--
- Yeah, we were on our way

00:02:10.842 --> 00:02:13.468
to the cave, and we have
to pay a tour guide.

00:02:13.468 --> 00:02:15.797
And because we wanted
to share, it was like,

00:02:15.797 --> 00:02:16.862
"Hey, do you wanna go with us

00:02:16.862 --> 00:02:18.506
and we're gonna save some money?"

00:02:18.506 --> 00:02:20.255
So, it's for like 500,

00:02:20.255 --> 00:02:22.701
and three of us shared
the 500 fee for the tour.

00:02:22.701 --> 00:02:26.591
- Oh yeah, so we shared a guide
to go into a cave in Sagada.

00:02:26.591 --> 00:02:28.927
- [Edzen] She also
cooked this this morning.

00:02:28.927 --> 00:02:30.857
- [Mother] Tulingan, fish tulingan.

00:02:30.857 --> 00:02:32.169
- [Mark] Fish tulingan.

00:02:32.169 --> 00:02:35.377
- [Mother] With papis.
- [Mark] Okay.

00:02:35.377 --> 00:02:37.721
- [Mother] And dried kamias.

00:02:37.721 --> 00:02:39.670
- [Mark] Oh, it's the whole fish in there.

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.048
- [Edzen] She doesn't wanna stop cooking.

00:02:41.048 --> 00:02:42.163
- [Mark] She loves to cook.

00:02:42.163 --> 00:02:45.111
- [Edzen] She wakes up
at two in the morning

00:02:45.111 --> 00:02:46.226
and prepares the food.

00:02:46.226 --> 00:02:49.865
And then breakfast of this
whole community, actually,

00:02:49.865 --> 00:02:51.166
she cooks it, yeah.
- [Mark] She cooks for

00:02:51.166 --> 00:02:52.169
the whole community?

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:53.827
- [Edzen] Yeah, sort of this area.

00:02:53.827 --> 00:02:56.511
All the kids going to school,
people going to the office.

00:02:56.511 --> 00:02:57.933
- You're gonna cook dinuguan?

00:02:57.933 --> 00:02:58.850
- Yes.
- Oh!

00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:02.791
Dinuguan is a Filipino blood stew.

00:03:03.841 --> 00:03:04.924
- Like adobo.

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.390
- It's one of my favorite Filipino dishes.

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.807
- Adobo?
- Dinuguan, dinuguan.

00:03:11.722 --> 00:03:13.704
I love to eat dinuguan.

00:03:13.704 --> 00:03:16.437
And then she's also already
prepared some other dishes.

00:03:16.437 --> 00:03:18.437
A fish in a banana leaf.

00:03:19.601 --> 00:03:21.215
Oh, I can't wait.

00:03:21.215 --> 00:03:24.567
- Spicy.
- [Mark] Oh, spicy is good.

00:03:24.567 --> 00:03:25.650
I love spicy.

00:03:27.484 --> 00:03:28.793
In order to make dinuguan,

00:03:28.793 --> 00:03:31.759
she first sauteed some chopped
onions and garlic in a pan

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:33.364
with a little bit of oil.

00:03:33.364 --> 00:03:36.493
Next, she had precooked some
pork which was already cut

00:03:36.493 --> 00:03:38.098
into bite-sized pieces

00:03:38.098 --> 00:03:41.349
and already incredibly
tender that she added.

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:43.271
She's just been simmering
that pork with those onions

00:03:43.271 --> 00:03:44.673
and now, vinegar.

00:03:44.673 --> 00:03:46.609
A lot of vinegar.

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:50.036
Finally, it wouldn't be
dinuguan without blood.

00:03:50.036 --> 00:03:53.937
And I'm talking like an entire
pot full of raw pig's blood.

00:03:53.937 --> 00:03:56.667
The blood is what gives
dinuguan its uniqueness

00:03:56.667 --> 00:03:58.773
and is the base of the sauce.

00:03:58.773 --> 00:04:00.123
Lastly, in order to season,

00:04:00.123 --> 00:04:02.479
she added in some ground
black pepper and salt

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:04.685
and a few sliced up green chiles.

00:04:04.685 --> 00:04:06.602
And then, green chiles.

00:04:08.017 --> 00:04:10.358
And then, she said that
you don't wanna stir it.

00:04:10.358 --> 00:04:11.431
You just leave it...

00:04:11.431 --> 00:04:13.666
You just let it sit and
simmer for 30 minutes,

00:04:13.666 --> 00:04:14.803
with no stirring?

00:04:14.803 --> 00:04:17.030
When it's finished cooking, it's gonna be

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.224
like a thick, curdled blood sauce.

00:04:19.224 --> 00:04:20.686
Don't let the blood throw you off

00:04:20.686 --> 00:04:24.027
because it's such a wonderful,
rich, and delicious dish.

00:04:24.027 --> 00:04:25.389
I love it so much.

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:28.660
Edzen's mom, she's legendary
in this neighborhood

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.649
for cooking, so I just want
to say that it is a huge honor

00:04:31.649 --> 00:04:33.957
to be invited to Edzen's house,

00:04:33.957 --> 00:04:37.329
and thank you very much to her
whole family for having me.

00:04:37.329 --> 00:04:38.995
It's really a...

00:04:38.995 --> 00:04:40.386
This is really special.

00:04:40.386 --> 00:04:42.834
This is the dinuguan.

00:04:42.834 --> 00:04:46.215
So Edzen's mom, I'm gonna
call her Aling Zeni.

00:04:46.215 --> 00:04:47.346
And she...

00:04:47.346 --> 00:04:48.770
This is the dish that I saw her cook.

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.594
This is the dinuguan,
the Filipino blood stew.

00:04:51.594 --> 00:04:53.852
There's pork in here,
there are chiles in here,

00:04:53.852 --> 00:04:56.631
and she added like, a
half a bottle of vinegar

00:04:56.631 --> 00:05:00.037
plus a good like, liter of raw blood.

00:05:00.037 --> 00:05:01.593
And then it cooked down, simmered down

00:05:01.593 --> 00:05:04.629
into this like rich, look at that sauce.

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:05.594
Oh, it's just...

00:05:05.594 --> 00:05:10.127
It's just black and rich
and chocolatey-looking.

00:05:10.127 --> 00:05:13.627
Onto my rice with some more of that sauce.

00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:21.986
Okay, I gotta just get
some of the chile in there.

00:05:25.204 --> 00:05:27.409
Oh, that is delicious.

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:29.512
I love the sour flavor of that vinegar.

00:05:29.512 --> 00:05:31.918
And the blood has been simmered
down and reduced so much

00:05:31.918 --> 00:05:35.179
that it's almost, it's
like a thick, rich gravy.

00:05:35.179 --> 00:05:36.994
- [Mother] Ginataang kuhol.

00:05:36.994 --> 00:05:39.026
- [Mark] Ginataang kuhol.

00:05:39.026 --> 00:05:41.800
This is the dish that
Edzen sent me a photo of

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.446
earlier in the morning,
a couple hours ago.

00:05:43.446 --> 00:05:45.873
She sent me a photo, said her
mom was cooking this dish.

00:05:45.873 --> 00:05:48.819
I knew we had to come here immediately.

00:05:48.819 --> 00:05:51.187
There are whole chiles in here again, too.

00:05:51.187 --> 00:05:53.930
And look at that coconut
milk that's just kinda

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:58.097
slightly thickened and you
can see all that rich flavor.

00:05:59.973 --> 00:06:02.890
So you can sort of just hit it out?

00:06:05.267 --> 00:06:06.820
(laughs)

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:08.396
Falls out of your hands.
- [Edzen] Yeah, you have

00:06:08.396 --> 00:06:09.229
to do that.

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:10.579
- [Mark] Oh, you have to
go like this to get it out?

00:06:10.579 --> 00:06:11.412
- [Edzen] Yes.

00:06:11.412 --> 00:06:13.784
- [Mark] Oh actually, I
can see him right there.

00:06:13.784 --> 00:06:15.409
Maybe I can just grab him.

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:18.051
(laughs)

00:06:18.051 --> 00:06:18.953
Oh, yeah.

00:06:18.953 --> 00:06:20.286
- [Edzen] Bit more power.
- [Mark] More power?

00:06:20.286 --> 00:06:21.536
- [Edzen] Yeah.

00:06:22.987 --> 00:06:24.674
- [Mark] Oh, there he goes.

00:06:24.674 --> 00:06:26.604
There he goes, okay.

00:06:26.604 --> 00:06:27.803
Here he is.

00:06:27.803 --> 00:06:29.672
And with some of that...

00:06:29.672 --> 00:06:30.911
Oh, I want some of that
piece of that chile

00:06:30.911 --> 00:06:32.779
as well in this bite.

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:34.874
That bite of snail.

00:06:34.874 --> 00:06:37.041
Oh, that's nice and meaty.

00:06:39.901 --> 00:06:40.774
Hey what's up, man?

00:06:40.774 --> 00:06:42.005
No, no, no, you can come.

00:06:42.005 --> 00:06:43.108
- [Edzen] Come here and join us.

00:06:43.108 --> 00:06:44.652
- [Mark] You can come, you can come.

00:06:44.652 --> 00:06:49.340
The snail is tender, and
then just a slightly like,

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:52.529
gelatinous taste to it, or texture to it.

00:06:52.529 --> 00:06:54.224
But then it's wrapped up in coconut milk.

00:06:54.224 --> 00:06:57.469
It is a little bit sour-tasting.

00:06:57.469 --> 00:07:00.720
You can taste the onions in
there, the garlic in there.

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.199
And also, you can taste the kinda sourness

00:07:03.199 --> 00:07:05.196
from those green chiles as well.

00:07:05.196 --> 00:07:07.996
So this is one of her mom's
specialties that she cooked.

00:07:07.996 --> 00:07:12.088
Fish with spices and then wrapped in a...

00:07:12.088 --> 00:07:13.664
She said it was boiled, I think, right?

00:07:13.664 --> 00:07:14.814
Boiled, it's boiled?
- [Edzen] Yeah.

00:07:14.814 --> 00:07:16.593
- [Mark] Okay, and then
boiled in a banana leaf.

00:07:16.593 --> 00:07:17.844
I can already smell the aroma

00:07:17.844 --> 00:07:19.710
of those banana leaves, especially.

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:23.543
They have like, an
embedded banana leaf aroma.

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:25.343
Oh, wow.

00:07:26.488 --> 00:07:29.905
It kind of has a very firm texture to it.

00:07:31.407 --> 00:07:32.942
It has a very salty taste to it.

00:07:32.942 --> 00:07:35.116
It almost tastes like the
fish are kinda salted,

00:07:35.116 --> 00:07:36.823
preserved a little bit.

00:07:36.823 --> 00:07:37.949
But very...

00:07:37.949 --> 00:07:41.055
Maybe they've been boiled in
saltwater for a very long time,

00:07:41.055 --> 00:07:42.663
like a brine taste to it.

00:07:42.663 --> 00:07:46.361
It's salty, and yeah, very flavorful.

00:07:46.361 --> 00:07:47.315
I love it.

00:07:47.315 --> 00:07:48.323
And you can--
- [Edzen] This adds flavor

00:07:48.323 --> 00:07:49.356
to it.
- [Mark] Oh, what is that?

00:07:49.356 --> 00:07:50.923
- [Edzen] It's called kamias.

00:07:50.923 --> 00:07:52.711
- [Mark] This is one of the
ingredients in the fish,

00:07:52.711 --> 00:07:54.497
and that's what's giving
it some of the flavor.

00:07:54.497 --> 00:07:58.664
So maybe I'll taste it with
some more of that fish.

00:08:00.005 --> 00:08:02.005
Try this, tree cucumber.

00:08:04.638 --> 00:08:06.127
Oh!

00:08:06.127 --> 00:08:07.482
Kinda slimy.

00:08:07.482 --> 00:08:09.676
And then it's kinda salty.

00:08:09.676 --> 00:08:12.154
That tastes like a pickle, actually.

00:08:12.154 --> 00:08:13.627
It's like a pickle.

00:08:13.627 --> 00:08:15.313
I guess that's a cucumber.

00:08:15.313 --> 00:08:19.153
I think that dinuguan,
though, and the snails,

00:08:19.153 --> 00:08:21.730
those are just spectacular.

00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:24.088
But nothing beats home-cooking.

00:08:24.088 --> 00:08:26.072
Micah--
- Lola.

00:08:26.072 --> 00:08:28.822
- [Mark] Lola, say hello to Lola.

00:08:29.871 --> 00:08:31.924
(laughs)

00:08:31.924 --> 00:08:33.956
- [Mark] And then for
dessert, we have biko.

00:08:33.956 --> 00:08:36.560
And this is sticky rice with coconut,

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:37.881
I think coconut milk and sugar

00:08:37.881 --> 00:08:41.881
and then also toasted,
or fried coconut as well.

00:08:44.431 --> 00:08:45.406
Oh, wow.

00:08:45.406 --> 00:08:47.756
You can feel the grains of the
rice, but at the same time,

00:08:47.756 --> 00:08:50.255
it has kind of a pudding texture to it.

00:08:50.255 --> 00:08:51.331
Very coconutty.

00:08:51.331 --> 00:08:52.731
Sweet, but not overly sweet.

00:08:52.731 --> 00:08:56.478
And you can also really taste that fried,

00:08:56.478 --> 00:09:00.561
or really, kinda like
caramelized coconut on top.

00:09:10.603 --> 00:09:11.486
Is this turon?

00:09:11.486 --> 00:09:13.021
- [Edzen] Turon, yes.

00:09:13.021 --> 00:09:15.155
- [Mark] You just grab it?
- [Edzen] Uh-huh.

00:09:15.155 --> 00:09:17.446
- [Mark] This is called banana Q.

00:09:17.446 --> 00:09:18.279
Salamat.

00:09:19.699 --> 00:09:21.446
Caramelized with sugar, banana Q.

00:09:21.446 --> 00:09:25.851
This is a popular Filipino
street food snack.

00:09:25.851 --> 00:09:26.934
Oh, it's hot.

00:09:32.943 --> 00:09:34.974
I wasn't expecting it to be so hot.

00:09:34.974 --> 00:09:36.234
It's like, really fresh.

00:09:36.234 --> 00:09:40.034
The banana is very, very
gooey, soft on the inside.

00:09:40.034 --> 00:09:41.731
And then that is like caramelized...

00:09:41.731 --> 00:09:42.930
I think it's like caramelized sugar

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:45.347
on the outside of the banana.

00:09:56.755 --> 00:09:59.505
(people talking)

00:10:13.069 --> 00:10:15.549
(speaking Filipino)

00:10:15.549 --> 00:10:18.221
- [Mark] We just stopped
to eat some ginataang.

00:10:18.221 --> 00:10:19.956
Oh, ginataang halo-halo.

00:10:19.956 --> 00:10:22.570
And there's tapioca in here,
there's bananas in here,

00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:23.768
there's sticky rice.

00:10:23.768 --> 00:10:25.455
Actually, I'm just gonna...

00:10:25.455 --> 00:10:27.050
I'm just gonna pick it up.

00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:28.524
It's like a pudding-like consistency.

00:10:28.524 --> 00:10:31.459
You can see the tapioca,
you can see pieces of banana

00:10:31.459 --> 00:10:34.944
and then she added in some
kinda crusty sticky rice.

00:10:34.944 --> 00:10:37.127
So I'll try to get...

00:10:37.127 --> 00:10:38.358
I'll try to get a little bit of everything

00:10:38.358 --> 00:10:39.191
in one bite.

00:10:39.191 --> 00:10:41.858
I think this is a sweet dessert.

00:10:47.885 --> 00:10:48.718
Oh, yeah.

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:51.310
It is sweet,

00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:52.560
but it has a...

00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:55.730
It's like a tapioca pudding.

00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:58.067
You can taste the coconut
milk in there as well.

00:10:58.067 --> 00:11:00.107
The banana is sour,

00:11:00.107 --> 00:11:02.667
and then the rice is kinda crunchy.

00:11:02.667 --> 00:11:04.160
Also, there's some Karo in here as well,

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:07.837
which also gives it a starchy texture.

00:11:07.837 --> 00:11:11.278
Tondo is known throughout
Manila for being--

00:11:11.278 --> 00:11:12.539
- [Edzen] Dangerous.
- It's a little bit

00:11:12.539 --> 00:11:13.536
dangerous?
- Yeah.

00:11:13.536 --> 00:11:14.766
- And kind of a,

00:11:14.766 --> 00:11:18.188
pretty poor area, right?
- [Edzen] Yeah.

00:11:18.188 --> 00:11:22.310
- [Mark] But at the same
time, it's really...

00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:24.120
It really has an amazing
community feel to it.

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:26.164
Everyone around here knows each other.

00:11:26.164 --> 00:11:30.331
Everyone, I mean the majority
of people are very friendly

00:11:31.365 --> 00:11:33.173
and very kind.

00:11:33.173 --> 00:11:36.677
What I like about an area
like, a place like this,

00:11:36.677 --> 00:11:39.771
is that you see so many creative people,

00:11:39.771 --> 00:11:43.634
so many people doing
things making a living

00:11:43.634 --> 00:11:46.467
from all sorts of creative methods

00:11:47.796 --> 00:11:51.099
and doing what they can
to live and survive.

00:11:51.099 --> 00:11:52.196
And so this is a...

00:11:52.196 --> 00:11:54.279
It's also a place of hope

00:11:56.028 --> 00:11:57.370
and amazing people.

00:11:57.370 --> 00:11:59.787
And lots and lots of stories.

00:12:03.952 --> 00:12:05.407
Hello.

00:12:05.407 --> 00:12:06.490
- Hello.
- Hi.

00:12:07.387 --> 00:12:08.942
- [Mark] Hi, how are you?
- Hello.

00:12:08.942 --> 00:12:10.363
- [Mark] Hi, what's your name?

00:12:10.363 --> 00:12:11.205
- Jadim.

00:12:11.205 --> 00:12:12.925
- [Mark] Jaden.
- Jadim.

00:12:12.925 --> 00:12:14.193
- [Mark] Jaben.

00:12:14.193 --> 00:12:16.907
Nice to meet you, what's up man?

00:12:16.907 --> 00:12:19.813
Nice to meet you, nice to meet you.

00:12:19.813 --> 00:12:22.480
(kids giggling)

00:12:23.734 --> 00:12:24.596
- [Mark] Bye-bye.

00:12:24.596 --> 00:12:26.538
- (in unison) Bye-bye.

00:12:26.538 --> 00:12:28.447
- [Edzen] Open, want have a picture it.

00:12:28.447 --> 00:12:30.886
- [Mark] Oh, thank you.

00:12:30.886 --> 00:12:32.633
Oh, cool, okay, all right.

00:12:32.633 --> 00:12:35.100
- [Edzen] He's gonna
put some salt, I think.

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:37.933
(speaks Filipino)

00:12:39.155 --> 00:12:40.905
- [Mark] And coconut.

00:12:44.577 --> 00:12:45.970
Is that salt or sugar?

00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:46.925
- [Edzen] A little.

00:12:46.925 --> 00:12:49.403
It's salt.
- [Mark] Okay.

00:12:49.403 --> 00:12:50.570
Okay, salamat.

00:12:51.494 --> 00:12:54.738
(bell dings)

00:12:54.738 --> 00:12:57.908
It's corn, and I saw he cooked
it with lemongrass as well.

00:12:57.908 --> 00:13:01.564
And then he just piled on some
coconut, shredded coconut.

00:13:01.564 --> 00:13:03.118
It's okay.

00:13:03.118 --> 00:13:05.025
He piled on some shredded coconut.

00:13:05.025 --> 00:13:07.405
Thank you Edzen, for holding the corn.

00:13:07.405 --> 00:13:08.812
And I'll try.

00:13:08.812 --> 00:13:12.293
It's almost like creamy
corn down below there.

00:13:12.293 --> 00:13:14.214
Oh, with all that coconut,
I want all that coconut.

00:13:14.214 --> 00:13:15.383
- [Edzen] It's hot.
- [Mark] It's hot?

00:13:15.383 --> 00:13:16.521
Okay.

00:13:16.521 --> 00:13:17.604
Look at that.

00:13:18.512 --> 00:13:20.646
Oh, I lost my coconut.

00:13:20.646 --> 00:13:21.563
Here we go.

00:13:24.985 --> 00:13:26.538
Oh, yeah.

00:13:26.538 --> 00:13:28.221
I think it's salt.

00:13:28.221 --> 00:13:30.054
It's not sweet at all.

00:13:30.945 --> 00:13:35.112
It's like cream corn with just
pure shredded coconut on top.

00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:37.554
I like that a lot.

00:13:37.554 --> 00:13:40.045
Kinda starchy, and kinda filling.

00:13:40.045 --> 00:13:42.767
Every few minutes, somebody
comes around selling something.

00:13:42.767 --> 00:13:45.166
This is an amazing area.

00:13:45.166 --> 00:13:49.607
And so this is an amazing
auntie who sells fish.

00:13:49.607 --> 00:13:53.774
She has smoked fish, she
has bangus, which has been,

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:56.852
I think it's marinated in vinegar.

00:13:56.852 --> 00:14:00.083
(speaks Filipino)

00:14:00.083 --> 00:14:02.125
And then she's been selling...

00:14:02.125 --> 00:14:03.366
How long has she been selling this,

00:14:03.366 --> 00:14:05.734
coming around?
- Since 1978.

00:14:05.734 --> 00:14:09.817
- Since 1978, she has been
coming around selling,

00:14:11.186 --> 00:14:13.603
selling here in the neighborhood.

00:14:13.603 --> 00:14:16.041
Amazing, she's a legend.

00:14:16.041 --> 00:14:18.605
(laughs)

00:14:18.605 --> 00:14:19.569
- [Mark] Salamat.

00:14:19.569 --> 00:14:20.402
- [Edzen] In English, I don't know.

00:14:20.402 --> 00:14:21.947
But it's called kutsinta.

00:14:21.947 --> 00:14:23.998
- [Mark] Kutsinta.

00:14:23.998 --> 00:14:25.532
(speaks Filipino)

00:14:25.532 --> 00:14:27.782
- [Edzen] This one's sweet.

00:14:29.421 --> 00:14:30.504
This is yema.

00:14:32.132 --> 00:14:33.549
It's like a milk.

00:14:36.521 --> 00:14:39.354
(speaks Filipino)

00:14:41.835 --> 00:14:43.521
- [Mark] Wow.
- [Edzen] Kutsinta with yema.

00:14:43.521 --> 00:14:45.025
- [Mark] Is it like dulce de leche?

00:14:45.025 --> 00:14:46.041
No.
- [Edzen] Yeah, this one is

00:14:46.041 --> 00:14:48.335
made of milk.
- [Mark] Okay, salamat.

00:14:48.335 --> 00:14:50.075
- [Man] Salamat.
- [Mark] Salamat.

00:14:50.075 --> 00:14:51.587
- [Edzen] Kutsinta with yema.

00:14:51.587 --> 00:14:53.101
- Kutsinta--
- With yema.

00:14:53.101 --> 00:14:54.972
- And the brown stuff is yema.

00:14:54.972 --> 00:14:58.385
You cannot sit in Edzen's
house for very long

00:14:58.385 --> 00:15:00.202
without another street food coming.

00:15:00.202 --> 00:15:01.421
Literally, that was just like,

00:15:01.421 --> 00:15:02.834
a minute between the last street food.

00:15:02.834 --> 00:15:06.087
And then the brown topping
that he put on is called--

00:15:06.087 --> 00:15:08.504
- [Edzen] Yema.
- [Mark] Yema.

00:15:12.885 --> 00:15:13.718
Oh!

00:15:14.827 --> 00:15:15.744
Yeah, okay.

00:15:17.297 --> 00:15:19.921
I was thinking that tastes
like dulce de leche,

00:15:19.921 --> 00:15:22.623
which is popular throughout
South America, I think.

00:15:22.623 --> 00:15:23.540
It's like a

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:26.403
reduced sweet cream

00:15:27.407 --> 00:15:29.738
that's kinda, has a caramel taste to it.

00:15:29.738 --> 00:15:31.900
The base of this, the handheld part of it

00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:33.821
is kind of gelatinous, kind of like a,

00:15:33.821 --> 00:15:36.821
kind of like a gelatinous rice cake.

00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:43.704
Hello.

00:15:43.704 --> 00:15:46.287
(kids talking)

00:15:48.601 --> 00:15:51.037
- [Mark] I think isaw, which
are grilled intestines,

00:15:51.037 --> 00:15:53.285
chicken intestines, which
are on the grill right now

00:15:53.285 --> 00:15:55.398
and they are hissing away.

00:15:55.398 --> 00:15:57.186
But I think they are one of the best

00:15:57.186 --> 00:15:59.897
Filipino street food snacks
you can possibly eat.

00:15:59.897 --> 00:16:04.064
Oh, they're just sizzling and
popping away like popcorn.

00:16:06.622 --> 00:16:10.789
Can I grab an adidas?
- [Woman] Yeah, help yourself.

00:16:17.278 --> 00:16:19.260
Got mostly isaw, which are
the chicken intestines,

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:22.194
which I think are some of
the most superior skewers

00:16:22.194 --> 00:16:23.913
you can get at a stall like this.

00:16:23.913 --> 00:16:26.847
And then also got
something called a helmet,

00:16:26.847 --> 00:16:29.459
which, it might be kinda self-explanatory,

00:16:29.459 --> 00:16:31.215
but I'll show it to you when it's ready.

00:16:31.215 --> 00:16:33.035
And then also adidas,

00:16:33.035 --> 00:16:35.035
what's known locally as adidas.

00:16:35.035 --> 00:16:36.489
And we got it in a little to-go sack

00:16:36.489 --> 00:16:38.462
and we're gonna bring it
back to the house to eat.

00:16:38.462 --> 00:16:41.058
But I asked her to save one,

00:16:41.058 --> 00:16:45.141
one skewer of the isaw, which
are the chicken intestines,

00:16:45.141 --> 00:16:47.472
this is one of the
greatest grilled skewers

00:16:47.472 --> 00:16:49.531
on the streets here in the Philippines.

00:16:49.531 --> 00:16:51.980
And I'm just gonna stand here and eat it.

00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:54.349
And you can dip it, oh yes.

00:16:54.349 --> 00:16:56.659
This is vinegar with chiles and onions.

00:16:56.659 --> 00:16:58.670
And you can just dip it once.

00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:00.914
And no double-dipping, just dip it once

00:17:00.914 --> 00:17:01.991
and get as much of the...

00:17:01.991 --> 00:17:04.658
Scoop up some onions and chiles.

00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:11.694
It's literally right off
the grill, so it's crispy.

00:17:11.694 --> 00:17:14.619
It's kinda like, soft on the inside.

00:17:14.619 --> 00:17:17.674
And with that vinegar, those
chiles on top, those onions.

00:17:17.674 --> 00:17:20.924
This is the grilled snack of champions.

00:17:24.479 --> 00:17:26.812
They just go down so easily.

00:17:29.634 --> 00:17:30.731
Hello, hello.

00:17:30.731 --> 00:17:33.369
(kids talking and laughing)

00:17:33.369 --> 00:17:35.702
- [Mark] Bye-bye, thank you.

00:17:36.672 --> 00:17:39.002
Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

00:17:39.002 --> 00:17:41.585
(kids talking)

00:17:42.475 --> 00:17:45.594
- [Mark] Okay, I'm going for the helmet.

00:17:45.594 --> 00:17:47.454
And this is not only a helmet,

00:17:47.454 --> 00:17:49.445
but the whole neck is attached too.

00:17:49.445 --> 00:17:50.737
They also had just straight helmets.

00:17:50.737 --> 00:17:52.220
And if you didn't know by now,

00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:56.101
a helmet in the Philippines
refers to the chicken heads.

00:17:56.101 --> 00:17:58.254
Now, along with eating all the neck meat,

00:17:58.254 --> 00:17:59.643
chicken neck meat is delicious.

00:17:59.643 --> 00:18:01.315
And then you also eat the head.

00:18:01.315 --> 00:18:04.494
And Edzen is explaining to
me that one of the best parts

00:18:04.494 --> 00:18:06.995
of eating helmets is the
brain of the chicken.

00:18:06.995 --> 00:18:09.058
So, may as well start off with that.

00:18:09.058 --> 00:18:11.225
All right, chicken brains.

00:18:12.816 --> 00:18:14.858
Oh, yeah, it's quite soft.

00:18:14.858 --> 00:18:17.224
But then you wanna take off...

00:18:17.224 --> 00:18:18.343
Oh, some juices.

00:18:18.343 --> 00:18:19.905
Oh, there it is.

00:18:19.905 --> 00:18:21.654
The creamy brain on the inside there.

00:18:21.654 --> 00:18:23.904
You can see that whiteness.

00:18:26.693 --> 00:18:27.526
Oh, wow.

00:18:28.461 --> 00:18:29.465
Oh, that's creamy.

00:18:29.465 --> 00:18:31.382
It's like cream cheese.

00:18:33.683 --> 00:18:34.516
Oh, yeah.

00:18:34.516 --> 00:18:37.933
That's what eating a helmet is all about.

00:18:40.781 --> 00:18:42.419
That just exploded with juices.

00:18:42.419 --> 00:18:45.069
Next up, I'll try the adidas.

00:18:45.069 --> 00:18:45.902
And

00:18:47.821 --> 00:18:50.154
that refers to chicken feet.

00:18:51.693 --> 00:18:55.526
They always kinda remind
me of baseball mitts.

00:18:57.989 --> 00:19:02.035
Yeah, chicken feet have
never been my favorite.

00:19:02.035 --> 00:19:03.030
They are...

00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:04.917
They do taste good, gnawing on the bones.

00:19:04.917 --> 00:19:07.141
But there's just not a
whole lot to eat on them.

00:19:07.141 --> 00:19:08.862
These are both okay,

00:19:08.862 --> 00:19:10.618
but I'm really all
about that isaw, though.

00:19:10.618 --> 00:19:13.177
The chicken intestines,
that's where it's at.

00:19:13.177 --> 00:19:14.486
Let me have a chicken intestine.

00:19:14.486 --> 00:19:15.790
Oh, and that vinegar.

00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:18.623
That vinegar makes it really good.

00:19:21.108 --> 00:19:22.176
Oh, yeah.

00:19:22.176 --> 00:19:24.926
This reigns supreme on the grill.

00:19:29.655 --> 00:19:32.853
We just caught a taxi,
we're heading out of Tondo.

00:19:32.853 --> 00:19:36.319
And that was one of the
most amazing experiences

00:19:36.319 --> 00:19:37.872
I've had so far in Manila.

00:19:37.872 --> 00:19:39.285
It was...

00:19:39.285 --> 00:19:43.722
Not only was the home-cooked
food just incredible,

00:19:43.722 --> 00:19:45.491
and I wanna say a huge
thank you, by the way,

00:19:45.491 --> 00:19:48.263
to Edzen, Edzen's mom,
and her whole family

00:19:48.263 --> 00:19:51.545
for warmly and generously
inviting us to their home.

00:19:51.545 --> 00:19:53.423
That was fantastic.

00:19:53.423 --> 00:19:56.670
But it was also just an
amazing eye-opening experience

00:19:56.670 --> 00:20:00.357
and to just come into this neighborhood,

00:20:00.357 --> 00:20:02.357
and Tondo is known as...

00:20:03.425 --> 00:20:07.753
It doesn't have a good
reputation in Manila.

00:20:07.753 --> 00:20:10.420
But it's also, at the same time,

00:20:11.445 --> 00:20:13.428
what's really disappointing is that

00:20:13.428 --> 00:20:16.299
the majority of the people
are just amazing and friendly

00:20:16.299 --> 00:20:17.918
and really welcoming.

00:20:17.918 --> 00:20:19.198
But it's just a couple of people

00:20:19.198 --> 00:20:23.261
that have to give the entire
area a bad reputation.

00:20:23.261 --> 00:20:26.797
But met some amazing people,
had some delicious food,

00:20:26.797 --> 00:20:28.289
and that was just a completely random day

00:20:28.289 --> 00:20:31.876
but it turned into a
fascinating experience.

00:20:31.876 --> 00:20:34.091
