00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:02.516
(interviewer) Imagine 
ourselves 400 years ago.

00:00:02.516 --> 00:00:04.746
They had about a 15% literacy rate.

00:00:04.746 --> 00:00:08.653
And I suspect that if you were to talk 
to someone who could read back then

00:00:08.653 --> 00:00:12.405
and ask them, "What percentage of the 
population do you think is capable of

00:00:12.405 --> 00:00:15.872
reading?" They might have said, " Well, 
maybe 20%, 25%."

00:00:15.948 --> 00:00:19.358
Now you fast forward 400 years,
we know that's a wildly pessimistic

00:00:19.371 --> 00:00:24.751
prediction or assumption. But 
it's actually 99.99% of the population

00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:28.096
is capable of reading. Well, what
similar blinders do we have on today?

00:00:30.347 --> 00:00:33.728
So, I'm excited to have Carol Dweck 
here, one of my personal heroes and

00:00:33.728 --> 00:00:37.190
who strongly influenced a lot of the 
work at Kahn Academy.

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:38.847
Carol, great to have you here.

00:00:38.847 --> 00:00:40.997
(Carol) Pleasure to be here Sal.

00:00:40.997 --> 00:00:43.217
(Sal) So, so, what I like

00:00:43.227 --> 00:00:45.407
to start off with this word:
growth mindset.

00:00:45.407 --> 00:00:46.940
Which I believe you
came up with.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.040
(Carol) Mmhm. 
(Sal) Um, when did you come up

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.546
with that? What was the 
motivation and what is it?

00:00:51.546 --> 00:00:53.816
(Carol) A growth mindset is when

00:00:53.816 --> 00:01:01.279
students believe that their abilities 
can be developed. A fixed mindset is

00:01:01.324 --> 00:01:04.288
when they think, "I just have a certain 
amount and that's it."

00:01:05.058 --> 00:01:07.198
(Sal) This isn't just kind of 
feel good talk,

00:01:07.198 --> 00:01:09.789
this is actually based
in science, that you actually,

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:13.890
the brain actually does grow stronger, 
neural connections actually do form

00:01:13.894 --> 00:01:14.894
when you struggle.

00:01:14.894 --> 00:01:16.832
(Carol) In study after

00:01:16.832 --> 00:01:18.592
study we have shown that kids

00:01:18.592 --> 00:01:24.078
who have a growth mindset get 
higher grades. It's not a choice

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:33.456
between the outcome and the mindset. 
It shows that, if kids engage deeply and

00:01:33.506 --> 00:01:38.764
effectively in a learning process, their 
grades and test scores are a natural

00:01:38.764 --> 00:01:45.415
byproduct. Kids who are praised for 
their intelligence, our research shows,

00:01:45.442 --> 00:01:51.530
don't want a challenge afterwards, they 
don't want to work hard on something, and

00:01:51.562 --> 00:01:59.114
if they had difficulty, that's it. We find
that when we praise or parents praise

00:01:59.181 --> 00:02:05.695
the process the child engages in, their
hard work, but not just hard work, their

00:02:05.764 --> 00:02:13.895
strategies, their ideas, their focus, 
their perseverance, then the student

00:02:13.961 --> 00:02:18.175
learns these are the ingredients 
of success. If it gets harder,

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:22.022
I'll just do these things. 
We've already done work

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:28.081
with you, uh, inserting growth 
mindset statements before a math

00:02:28.094 --> 00:02:32.900
problems, and we found together 
that kids did better.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.900
(Sal) So one thing 
that I hope is,

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.553
the folks listening to these 
videos, go out there and tell

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.710
their parents, tell their children, tell 
their peers, tell their teachers, tell

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.271
their students about growth mindset.
Tell them that their brain grows when

00:02:46.271 --> 00:02:48.121
they get a question 
wrong, when they

00:02:48.121 --> 00:02:50.287
struggle, when they 
look at their errors and

00:02:50.287 --> 00:02:53.274
they say, "Hey, that's an 
interesting!" That you shouldn't be

00:02:53.274 --> 00:02:56.352
ashamed of your mistake, that 
you should view that as something

00:02:56.352 --> 00:02:59.671
that is interesting; something to 
explore. When you do that, you will

00:02:59.671 --> 00:03:02.691
actually, physically, form neural 
connections. Your brain will

00:03:02.691 --> 00:03:03.530
actually grow.
