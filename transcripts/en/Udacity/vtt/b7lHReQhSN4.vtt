00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.110
Here are four networking apps
that we've built this course.

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.100
But there's a glaring
problem with each of these.

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.050
For each of these apps we've assumed
near perfect network conditions.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.930
Or we've at least assumed that
the network conditions were equivalent

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.010
to the machines we were testing on.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:17.600
In the real world this
is hardly the case.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.320
While networks are always
getting better,

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.580
connections are still unreliable.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.640
And as we build apps we need
to keep these things in mind.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.140
To get us thinking about apps that
address these kinds of network problems,

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.940
we'll take a look at Apple Maps next.
