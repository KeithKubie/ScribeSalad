1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.540
The Joe Rogan experience.
Yeah.
It's weird.

2
00:00:03.541 --> 00:00:06.570
How would you feel bad for killing an elephant but other animals is like a rat.

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.070
You kind of deserve it.
Yeah.
Rack gets hit by a car,
you cheer,
you like,
Oh yeah,

4
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.120
you're fucking loser.
I hit it myself.
Right.
Yeah.
It's,
we're,

5
00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.030
we're totally w you know,

6
00:00:15.031 --> 00:00:19.680
bias towards certain types of animals and for sure it's like why we uh,

7
00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.640
how do they say it while we feed pigeons,
but we'll be like,
we shoot bald eagles.

8
00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.530
Just majestic.
Yeah,
no,
you want it.

9
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.870
Do you see that Beluga whale that they caught that had a,
a net?

10
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.590
It had a harness on it and they think that the Russians were writers and you

11
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.550
know,
they think it was,
they were using it as a bio weapon.

12
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.430
Like they would strap a missile to this thing.
Oh.

13
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.070
And then tell the whale to go to boats.
How do you,

14
00:00:41.071 --> 00:00:42.730
tell me a little about this way.

15
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.600
I was trained to go towards boats hold and it had this harness on it and they,

16
00:00:46.601 --> 00:00:51.601
they think that what they did was they trained this thing to go towards boat,

17
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.500
the choking the shit out of that thing.
Well it,

18
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.330
you could use something like that to hold a bomb.

19
00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.350
So you train it to go towards the boat and then when it would hit the boat it

20
00:01:01.351 --> 00:01:02.910
would detonate the bomb and explode.

21
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.590
So they must have given this way or some sort of food reward for banging into

22
00:01:07.591 --> 00:01:11.090
the boat.
Cause it,
yeah.
So they,

23
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.750
they cut it free of this uh,
this harness,
I mean this is total speculation.

24
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.370
They don't know where the harness came from,

25
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.000
but I'm hoping someone was trying to ride it and they weren't as probably a bomb

26
00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.520
though.
I'm pretty sure.
Pretty sure it's a bomb.

27
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.520
I'm pretty sure look at this whale found off Norway coast believed to be spine

28
00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.250
[inaudible] bunch of cameras and stuff too.

29
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.610
I might just be click baity bullshit too.
Right.
Who wrote this article?

30
00:01:32.611 --> 00:01:34.620
Are they an expert?
Are they a security expert?

31
00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.330
Do they just have a whale with a harness?
We don't really know what the,

32
00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.100
how often do whales and harnesses show up?

33
00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.280
The fact that you're an expert can speak intelligently about it.

34
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.400
I think that the US government owed it's red equipment of Saint Petersburg on

35
00:01:47.641 --> 00:01:49.590
the strap.
Oh Shit.
Yeah.

36
00:01:49.591 --> 00:01:52.470
But if I wanted to trick people into thinking that the Russians were involved,

37
00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.530
I would make it super obvious.
Right.
That too.
Yeah.
Why would they write that?

38
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.660
We've got a fake train.
I'll whale and incentive Zach liquids.

39
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.880
You got to look into.
Exactly.
Made in Russia by Russia.
Exactly.
Um,

40
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.290
I would write maiden rush on it is all in English to Chinese Russian letters to

41
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.310
property of mother Russia.
I love Russia.

42
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.650
I think the government did that with dolphins sea.

43
00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.780
See if that's true that the government trained dolphins for weapons,
20 of them,

44
00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.480
something like that.
Yeah.
I think US government did that.

45
00:02:21.481 --> 00:02:25.970
Find out what they trained dolphins to blow up boats.
Damn Dude.
What a,

46
00:02:25.971 --> 00:02:26.804
what a place.

47
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.350
What a place we live in now basically trained dolphins to BG hottest.

48
00:02:31.351 --> 00:02:34.310
But they didn't know it.
They didn't know they were g.
At least the jihad,

49
00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.340
his nose mean you tricked him into going 72 virgins and blowing up.

50
00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.690
You trick them,
God,
but the Dolphin doesn't even know is going to die.
Yeah,

51
00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.260
probably would be like,
what?
Wait a minute while I get fish.
I love fish.

52
00:02:46.261 --> 00:02:48.130
He just thinks he's going to get fish.
If he bumps into the boat.

53
00:02:48.131 --> 00:02:51.270
What's this thing on my back?
Oh,
whatever.
I'll do.
Oh my God.
Yeah,
that's it.

54
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:56.130
Four things now coming.
Yeah.
This says it's a myth.
Oh,

55
00:02:56.131 --> 00:03:00.220
it's a math.
What's a myth that wouldn't be high spread dealt this information.

56
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.230
Yeah.
Well who says that?
The navy.
It's a place.

57
00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.280
Stories are coming up with Joe's second guesses.
Everything.
That's true.

58
00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:07.840
Is that true?
Who wrote them?

59
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.860
But then in 2015 it says that the US Navy's combat dolphin is our serious

60
00:03:11.861 --> 00:03:16.200
military assets.
So yeah,
started,
stopped and started back up.

61
00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.580
Did it go?
So why don't they,

62
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.070
why are they sending dog one of these build robots to do it?

63
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.360
Because the robots aren't as advanced as her wild dolphin.

64
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.050
They can't go through the water the way a dolphin can and it would look like a

65
00:03:29.051 --> 00:03:32.790
robot.
Oh,
Dolphin.
The Dunkin to do shit.
They're always in the water.
Oh right.

66
00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.320
And get something that's an organic part of the environment.

67
00:03:35.321 --> 00:03:37.960
They're not going to kill every dolphin that comes near the boat,
you know?

68
00:03:37.961 --> 00:03:41.700
So they see a dolphin.
The thing it's just a dolphin,
right?
Bunk.
Why don't they,

69
00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:44.050
why don't they have a missile painted like a dolphin?

70
00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:46.360
And by the time they get it,
it's like,
oh shit.

71
00:03:46.361 --> 00:03:50.770
Going too fast and creating killer dolphins escape naval training base in search

72
00:03:50.771 --> 00:03:53.620
of love.
Yeah,
it's accurate.
For some reason.

73
00:03:53.621 --> 00:03:55.840
I don't know why I escaped during Hurricane Katrina.

74
00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.980
They've escaped multiple times.
It's like an arm,
a Howard for just training more.

75
00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.870
These dolphins keep escaping everything out.
We are tailored off,
off.

76
00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.710
It's smarter than us.
They keep escaping.
How do we,
not super smart.

77
00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:08.830
How do we not keep a hold of these dolphins?
Not on the loose.
I don't know.

78
00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.190
It's very confusing when you look it up.
So Ukrainian military dolphins,

79
00:04:12.191 --> 00:04:16.120
not actually on the loose.
Who says that?
That's the G.
Dot Gov

80
00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:19.450
hey,
you know what?
You're going to dolphins.

81
00:04:19.451 --> 00:04:22.510
My Fun Dolphin fact that dolphins are one of the few animals that have sex for

82
00:04:22.511 --> 00:04:27.430
pleasure.
Yeah.
One of the few chimps.
Dolphins,
people.
Yep.
And uh,
dogs.

83
00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.750
Wild dogs are tracks for fun.
No,
I guess I want to fuck your leg.

84
00:04:31.751 --> 00:04:34.260
What are they trying to do?
Are you sure?
Right.
That's all

85
00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:38.910
we trying to get to the point.
It's a good point.
What are they trying to prove?

86
00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.980
Yeah.
