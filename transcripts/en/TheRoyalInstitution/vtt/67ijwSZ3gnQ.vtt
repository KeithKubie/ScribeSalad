00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.380
What we've got in here is liquid nitrogen.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.560
Nitrogen from the air, normally gaseous

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.340
at this temperature and pressure,

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.940
but here it's been condensed,
and for it to remain condensed

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.840
it has to be very very cold,

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.900
so the liquid inside here
is an astonishing

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.360
minus 196 degrees Celsius
or cooler.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.880
So, that cold, no-one in their right mind

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.340
would pour this on their hand...

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.800
So what's happening here
is the Leidenfrost effect,

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.820
named Johann Leidenfrost,
who wrote the paper in 1756

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.160
describing how when liquids boil,
a gaseous barrier

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.040
between the liquid and the surface that
they're boiling on

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.820
can act as a thermal barrier,
protecting, if you like,

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.340
my hand from the
extreme cold of the liquid.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.860
So the key thing is that there's
a big temperature difference

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.520
between the liquid
and the surface that it's on.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.260
Here we've got a very very cold liquid
on a room-temperature surface.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.580
We can also do
the same sort of demonstration

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.240
with a room temperature liquid
on a very very hot surface,

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.640
like a hot plate.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.920
So the surface right now
is measuring about 37 or 38 degrees.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.479
if we squeeze some water onto it,
well nothing much happens

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.260
because it hasn't reached its boiling point.

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.280
And now we are at 100 degrees Celsius and clearly the water is boiling

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.060
on the surface.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.860
Now it's reading 200 I'm going to pour the liquid on, the water on.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.800
We can see droplets of water elevated

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.740
It's getting a bit steamy in here!

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.660
So we now have the Leidenfrost effect and what's happening

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.020
is that the second that the water touches the hot plate

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.540
it boils instantly and the gas coming out at the bottom elevates the droplet.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.540
and is acting as a thermal barrier

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:24.060
preventing any further transfer of heat from the plate onto the liquid.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.100
So it just seems to hover there and go on indefinitely.

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.040
Or it would if it just didn't roll off like that.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.560
Similarly the surface of this desk is so much hotter than this nitrogen

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.760
exactly the same thing happens here.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.620
Who cares?

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.980
Designers of boilers and kettles.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.200
In the 1800s, of course steam was king

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.930
And even today the Leidenfrost effect

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.360
can be a bit of a curse when you're designing these kettles

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.560
which contain a heating element and if you heat the

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.860
water and the steam gathers around the element that will act as a

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.659
thermal insulator and if you're just heating the

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.320
steam around the element that's inefficient.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.580
You might think we people are doing demonstrations with liquid nitrogen

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:19.880
they would be wearing these

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.860
sort of gloves all the time to protect themselves.

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.500
But actually the Leidenfrost effect protects you pretty well.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.900
As long as you're not holding something for a long period of time that's very cold.

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.180
And you can imagine the situation where the nitrogen gets stuck down here.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.400
Held against your skin and that would lead to the severe frostbite situation.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.600
So goodbye gloves, hello leidenfrost.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.220
