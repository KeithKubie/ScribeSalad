00:00:00.321 --> 00:00:01.450
You know..

00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:03.883
There's such a negative connotation

00:00:03.883 --> 00:00:05.270
about being alone.

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:06.479
Hey, loner!

00:00:06.479 --> 00:00:08.344
Or should we say LOSER~?

00:00:08.344 --> 00:00:10.319
Or should we say both?

00:00:10.319 --> 00:00:11.541
(syncronized giggle)

00:00:11.541 --> 00:00:13.602
And yet, spending time by yourself

00:00:13.602 --> 00:00:15.464
is how we figure out who we are

00:00:15.464 --> 00:00:17.419
and what we really love.

00:00:17.419 --> 00:00:18.843
Lately..

00:00:18.843 --> 00:00:21.935
I've been feeling really shitty
about being alone.

00:00:21.935 --> 00:00:24.848
Like, should I be surrounded
by people?

00:00:24.848 --> 00:00:26.821
Is there something wrong with me?

00:00:26.821 --> 00:00:29.755
Is it weird that I don't have a lot
of friends?

00:00:29.755 --> 00:00:31.815
But, I've come to the conclusion

00:00:31.815 --> 00:00:34.163
that it's the idea of being alone

00:00:34.163 --> 00:00:35.719
that bugs me a lot more than

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:37.918
ACTUALLY being alone.

00:00:37.918 --> 00:00:42.188
Because, taking yourself to
the movies, is amazing.

00:00:42.188 --> 00:00:46.771
And have you ever gone to dinner solo?
It's a whole new experience!

00:00:46.771 --> 00:00:50.256
I actually used to take myself out
on a date every week,

00:00:50.256 --> 00:00:52.163
whether it was to Barnes and Nobles,

00:00:52.163 --> 00:00:53.464
or a thrift store,

00:00:53.464 --> 00:00:55.947
or even just window shopping for cats.

00:00:55.947 --> 00:00:57.633
Hanging out by yourself

00:00:57.633 --> 00:00:59.785
can be so much fun.

00:00:59.785 --> 00:01:01.918
And yet, it's looked down upon.

00:01:01.918 --> 00:01:03.101
You see someone who's alone,

00:01:03.101 --> 00:01:05.602
and you're like, "Oh, you're so lonely."

00:01:05.602 --> 00:01:08.029
You know what I mean?
It's thought of as like, sad.

00:01:08.029 --> 00:01:12.041
When it doesn't have to be, and in fact
it's probably really healthy for you!

00:01:12.041 --> 00:01:15.542
When I was a teenager, I always
used to fantasize about the day I

00:01:15.542 --> 00:01:17.194
met my significant other.

00:01:17.194 --> 00:01:20.281
I was like, "Oh, we're gonna be best
friends and partners in crime and

00:01:20.281 --> 00:01:21.633
we're gonna have a ball!"

00:01:21.633 --> 00:01:26.133
And then as I grew up, and experienced
relationships, I would always stumble.

00:01:26.133 --> 00:01:28.949
Because I failed to realize that..

00:01:28.949 --> 00:01:32.514
if I don't like hanging out with myself,

00:01:32.514 --> 00:01:35.040
why would anyone else?

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.373
So, I encourage you to give it a try.

00:01:37.373 --> 00:01:39.419
Take yourself out on a date this week.

00:01:39.419 --> 00:01:41.450
Challenge accepted, accepted.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:42.978
I mean, it can be scary.

00:01:42.978 --> 00:01:44.720
And weird, and you might feel lonely,

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.602
but, I think in the end, you'll be really
proud of yourself for at least giving it a shot.

00:01:49.602 --> 00:01:51.133
Who knows?

00:01:51.133 --> 00:01:53.285
You might get lucky.

00:01:53.285 --> 00:01:55.780
No, I don't think masturbation counts.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.602
Although it is technically healthy.

00:01:58.602 --> 00:02:01.843
So, the other day, I walked in on THIS:

00:02:01.843 --> 00:02:05.602
Are those my first edition Watchmen
comics out of the plastic?!

00:02:05.602 --> 00:02:07.484
You said I could read them..

00:02:07.484 --> 00:02:11.081
That's what the $20 compilation booklet is for!
What the fu--!
