[APPLAUSE]

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:03.310
JERRY: Hi, everybody.

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:03.810
How are you?

00:00:05.917 --> 00:00:06.750
BRIAN: Hi, everyone.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:07.550
I'm Brian.

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:08.250
JERRY: I'm Jerry Harvey.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.125
BRIAN: This is Jerry.

00:00:09.125 --> 00:00:10.660
JERRY: Nice to meet you.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.096
BRIAN: So, I figured that we'd
talk, just a Q &amp; A with me

00:00:13.096 --> 00:00:14.970
and Jerry for a bit,
but feel free to jump in

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:16.369
with questions anytime you want.

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:18.410
And we'll talk for maybe
about a half hour or so,

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.390
and then we can do some
questions at the end.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.100
You can talk
about-- ask anything

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.690
you want about Ultimate
Ears, about JH audio,

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:27.900
about audio technology,
anything like that.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.160
So we'll cover it all,
from the beginning to now.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.820
JERRY: Yup.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:31.320
Ready to go.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:31.580
BRIAN: That cool?

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.840
Are you ready?

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:32.009
JERRY: Yeah.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.210
And also make sure everyone
gets a raffle ticket.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.660
We're giving away a set
of Roxannes, so make sure

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.222
you get your ticket in
there for that, at the end.

00:00:39.222 --> 00:00:41.430
BRIAN: Yeah, and afterwards,
also, for the whole day,

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.780
we'll be demoing--
or Dr. Glick, who's

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.957
in the back there-- will be
demoing all the models of JH,

00:00:44.957 --> 00:00:47.207
so you can listen to them,
and they all sound amazing,

00:00:47.207 --> 00:00:48.720
even if you're not a rock star.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.150
So, please enjoy.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.544
So I thought we'd
start by just talking

00:00:53.544 --> 00:00:54.710
about how this story begins.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.790
So you're a guy who
wasn't a musician,

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.670
and had no connections
to this business,

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.410
and somehow got wrapped
up with a bunch of guys

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.209
from Van Halen, and Sammy Hagar,
and sort of got you, sort of,

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:06.250
mixed into this business.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.041
And maybe just talk
about how that started,

00:01:08.041 --> 00:01:10.440
and how you went from a
guy who just likes music

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.610
to a guy who became
indispensable to these guys.

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.580
JERRY: Yeah, when I was a kid,
I met a guy named Roger Moore,

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.500
and he had a little local band.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.000
I was teaching karate to
him, right, as a side thing,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.340
so I could have my free lessons.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.770
But anyway, he had
this band, and I

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.030
wanted to get into the
bar-- I was under age,

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.710
so I thought if I
could move gear in,

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.168
that I could get into the bar
without having to have an ID.

00:01:35.168 --> 00:01:37.740
So that's kind of
how it started.

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.910
And then-- I had learned to
mix, kind of by trial and error.

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:44.930
I was really bad for
the first few years,

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.150
and people were not
shy to tell me that.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.270
So anyway, I was mixing,
and I had a couple mentors,

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:58.080
and I started to get fairly--
get pretty good at it.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.650
And I was driving down the
road, and it's kind of weird

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.090
that Van Halen just kind of
intertwined into my life,

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.305
just out of the blue.

00:02:05.305 --> 00:02:08.680
I was driving down the
road, I had a red Trans Am,

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.250
it was, like, 1980, right?

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.770
And I get pulled
over, and this guy

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.930
was a promoter rep for
Contemporary Productions.

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.060
He says, hey, Sammy Hagar
is playing Busch Stadium

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.470
on Saturday, and we need him to
drive your car out on to stage,

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.170
because he's got a song
called "Trans Am," right?

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.050
So, I was, like,
all right, whatever.

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.860
I want to get into the show,
so I'll go down there, so--

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:28.340
BRIAN: Sounds legit.

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.610
JERRY: Yeah.

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.193
So, he showed me his card, so I
was, like, yeah, I'll show up.

00:02:31.193 --> 00:02:33.930
So I showed up, they let
me in, and they go, well,

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.650
we're gonna introduce
you to Sammy Hagar.

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.750
I was, like, all right, great.

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.420
So I walk up, and I
go, hi, I'm Jerry,

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.240
he goes, hi, I'm Sammy, and
basically kind of dismissed

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.948
me a little bit-- hey,
thanks for letting

00:02:44.948 --> 00:02:47.174
me use your car, now
get out of here, kid.

00:02:47.174 --> 00:02:49.090
So he drives it out onto
stage, and it kind of

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.464
became like a little bit of
an urban legend in St. Louis,

00:02:51.464 --> 00:02:53.070
right?

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.830
So that was kind of
my first introduction.

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.510
And I saw the big
rock show, and I

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.860
saw-- I realized that if I
got really good at mixing,

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.640
maybe I could get to
that level someday.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:08.042
So fast forward to, like, 1984.

00:03:08.042 --> 00:03:10.900
I kind of got discouraged--
I'll keep this short,

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.010
if I can-- and I was going to
just start doing a normal day

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.112
gig, because the bands
weren't paying any money,

00:03:16.112 --> 00:03:17.570
I was starving to
death, and I went

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.212
and saw the Van
Halen "1984" show.

00:03:20.212 --> 00:03:21.170
They played two nights.

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.640
So at the end of the show,
I was just blown away.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.884
I was, like, I think I want
to do sound engineering again.

00:03:26.884 --> 00:03:28.550
So I'm sitting at
this little bar called

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.569
Bogart's on the Landing
on the river front,

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:32.360
and I looked to my
left, and David Lee Roth

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.240
sits down right
next to me, right?

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.240
And I was, like, wow.

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:40.780
So we sit down, and I start
talking to him about martial

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.646
arts, and stretching-- I never
even said a word to him about

00:03:43.646 --> 00:03:44.270
rock and roll--

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:45.410
BRIAN: Well, you knew he
was David Lee Roth, though.

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:46.820
JERRY: Yeah, I knew who
he was, absolutely, I just

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:47.560
saw him on stage.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.080
I actually wanted to ask him
for a job, but I didn't, right?

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.400
So 18 months later, I'm
actually working for him,

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.210
because I met a gentleman
that was a drum tech for him.

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:03.330
And he was with the Beach Boys,
and when Dave left Van Halen,

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.140
he introduced me
to the Dave camp,

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.910
and I ended up 18 months
later working for Dave,

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.060
so it's kind of a
weird thing, right.

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.860
So this is, like, 1986 or so.

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:19.029
The "Eat 'em and Smile"
tour, and "Skyscraper."

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:21.579
And then in '95, I started
working for Van Halen.

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:23.997
So I'm working for Dave,
I'm working for Van Halen,

00:04:23.997 --> 00:04:25.830
neither know that I'm
working for the other,

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.990
because I didn't
want to get fired,

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.870
so that's kind of how it
kind of just intertwined.

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.910
And then, in '95, when I
was working for Van Halen,

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.540
we decided to put
Alex on in-ears,

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.180
and that's kind of how
Ultimate Ears started.

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.759
BRIAN: So I hear the story is
that Alex and Eddie came to you

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:42.300
and said, we're
basically going deaf.

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.080
What do we do, right?

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.870
JERRY: Yeah, well--

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:44.710
BRIAN: This is what happens.

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:45.510
Right?

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:50.260
JERRY: Well, Alex was going deaf
because he had Eddie's guitar

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.670
cabinet blaring behind him,
he had these two big PA

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:55.670
systems behind
him, so he's had--

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:57.950
he was just getting
killed with volume.

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:59.450
And it sounded
really bad out front,

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:02.650
because all this stuff is
going through the drum mics.

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.070
So in-ear monitors
was in its infancy,

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:09.590
and people were focusing more on
the transmitters and receivers

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:12.280
than they were the
earphone side of it.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.790
They wanted to save the
rest of Alex's hearing,

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:17.500
so we decided to try to
put him on in-ear monitors.

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.420
Well, it didn't go so well,
because even though he

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:24.152
had had some-- he'd
been around loud music--

00:05:24.152 --> 00:05:25.652
the guy's got an
amazing ear, and he

00:05:25.652 --> 00:05:27.860
can hear tonality
and everything else.

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.100
There was two companies back
then that, in the beginning,

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.940
had started putting,
basically, either a balanced

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.560
armature in a silicone
mold, or, basically,

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:42.010
a Sony diaphragm in a mold, and
called them in-ear monitors.

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:45.920
So we get him a set of each,
and he listens to the first set,

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:49.140
plays about four beats, takes
them out, throws them down,

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:50.390
puts the second set in.

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:51.890
Plays about four
beats, and he goes,

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:53.056
these things sound horrible.

00:05:53.056 --> 00:05:54.927
He goes, I suggest we
find something better.

00:05:54.927 --> 00:05:57.010
And I said, well, they
don't make anything better.

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:58.740
And he goes, well, maybe
you should figure out

00:05:58.740 --> 00:05:59.840
how to make something
better, then.

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.715
And he gets up and walks
off to his drum kit,

00:06:01.715 --> 00:06:03.857
so that's kind of how I
started down the path.

00:06:03.857 --> 00:06:05.940
BRIAN: It all comes back
to Van Halen, every time.

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:07.815
JERRY: Yeah, I didn't
want to build anything.

00:06:07.815 --> 00:06:09.710
I never thought about
it, but I was kind of

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:12.600
instructed to do it, and
I wanted to keep my gig,

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.800
so I decided I
was going to build

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.552
something that sounded better.

00:06:17.552 --> 00:06:20.010
BRIAN: So I think the story is
that, there was nothing that

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:21.900
was better, so you had to figure
out how to make something.

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.475
So you used parts
from-- well, you

00:06:23.475 --> 00:06:25.526
can describe it-- you used
parts from a pacemaker and parts

00:06:25.526 --> 00:06:27.900
from a hearing aid, and somehow
jury-rigged this stuff up

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:28.590
to work.

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:29.670
It was somehow better
than everything else

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:30.836
out there, which is amazing.

00:06:30.836 --> 00:06:33.880
JERRY: Well, I realized,
by starting to experiment

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:36.810
with the components, that
one component couldn't

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:39.560
do the complete frequency
response from lows to high.

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.475
You could have-- with
the balanced armature,

00:06:41.475 --> 00:06:44.030
it was kind of a hearing
aid driver, basically,

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:47.340
a hot-rodded
hearing aid speaker.

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:50.320
You could get good lows--
not lows, but low mids, mids,

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.550
and highs, but no real sub bass.

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:55.460
And then, with the diaphragm
speaker that's in a Sony bud,

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.040
you get nice lows,
but you couldn't

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.210
get any top-end extension.

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:02.320
So I realized that, looking
up at the PA system,

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:03.490
it wasn't rocket science.

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:07.080
I was like, well, we've been
putting multiple lows, mids,

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.979
and highs, with crossovers,
in big speakers.

00:07:09.979 --> 00:07:11.770
Why can't we do it in
a miniature earphone?

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:14.920
So I started just
researching, and trying

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:18.250
to find miniature
components, and landed--

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:20.180
a gentleman named Rick
Cenardo, at a company

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:22.700
called [? Knowles, ?]
became my liaison,

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:24.215
and he was sending me samples.

00:07:24.215 --> 00:07:25.590
I would put them
on the analyzer,

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:28.354
with-- it was modeling
clay, and an analyzer mic--

00:07:28.354 --> 00:07:30.020
and shoot pink noise
through it, and see

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:31.353
what the frequency response was.

00:07:31.353 --> 00:07:34.220
So I found a driver that was
suitable for mids and highs,

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:36.480
but I couldn't
find a driver that

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:38.790
had the capacity,
for live performance,

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:42.817
for low frequency reproduction.

00:07:42.817 --> 00:07:43.900
So I get a call from Rick.

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:48.590
He goes, hey, I found this
thing in the armature cemetery.

00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:51.830
He goes, it's a
pacemaker speaker.

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:55.790
He goes, what it's for is,
if someone has a pacemaker,

00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:59.090
it has to emit 140 dB
tone, or 130 dB tone,

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:01.840
through their chest, to let them
know that they're going to get

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:03.760
zapped, so they might
want to sit down, right?

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:05.259
So I was, like,
cool, send it to me.

00:08:05.259 --> 00:08:07.864
So I shoot pink noise through
it, I'd all of a sudden

00:08:07.864 --> 00:08:10.030
it's like, wow, this thing
is a perfect bass driver.

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:11.870
So then I made a
little crossover,

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:14.030
and pop them into Alex's ears,
he smiled, and I was like, wow,

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:14.530
you know?

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:17.390
So that's kind of how
all that just-- it

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:20.897
was just trial and error,
and a lucky call from Rick,

00:08:20.897 --> 00:08:22.730
and that's kind of how
it all came together.

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:27.532
And that was the first UE 5, the
first two-way in-ear monitor.

00:08:27.532 --> 00:08:29.740
BRIAN: So I guess the next
question is, so how do you

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:31.823
go from a guy who has sort
of thrown this together

00:08:31.823 --> 00:08:34.739
from the graveyard of hearing
aid parts to someone who

00:08:34.739 --> 00:08:37.030
all the rock stars are coming
and begging for products?

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:39.530
So they say that Sebastian Bach
came, begging you with cash,

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:40.789
he said, give me
as many as you can,

00:08:40.789 --> 00:08:43.240
and Engelbert Humperdinck, and
everyone's coming and begging.

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:43.990
So what do you do?

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:44.950
You have to mass produce these.

00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:45.680
What happens?

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:48.390
JERRY: Well, it
was kind of funny.

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:50.020
Skid Row was opening
for Van Halen,

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:51.201
and they saw Alex was happy.

00:08:51.201 --> 00:08:53.450
And they had the other models,
and they weren't happy.

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:57.515
So I built them six
sets of in-ear monitors.

00:08:57.515 --> 00:08:58.890
They asked me if
I could do it, I

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:00.170
go, yeah, I'll
build you six sets.

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:01.390
And I'd never sold anything.

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:02.860
It wasn't a company.

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:05.350
And I walk into the
production office,

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:07.720
and the tour manager goes,
well, how much do I owe you?

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.354
I was like, well, $500 a pair.

00:09:09.354 --> 00:09:10.770
So he hands me
three grand, right?

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:13.247
And I was like, this
is three weeks' work.

00:09:13.247 --> 00:09:15.330
This is a lot more profitable
than actually mixing

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:18.270
for a living, so that's when
I decided to do Ultimate Ears.

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:22.370
But what happened was,
Westone was the company

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:25.060
that did the shells for me,
because I had no concept of how

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:29.510
to mold it, but I did
all the audio circuits.

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:31.829
So there's a couple
good guys at Westone

00:09:31.829 --> 00:09:33.370
that I became very
good friends with,

00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:37.532
Karl and Kris Cartwright,
and so I told them,

00:09:37.532 --> 00:09:38.740
I'm going to start a company.

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:40.030
Will you guys be my OEM?

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:42.071
And they're like, yeah,
we'll build them for you.

00:09:42.071 --> 00:09:46.940
So I basically became the
design and the marketing side

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:49.616
of Ultimate Ears, and
then they were my OEM.

00:09:49.616 --> 00:09:51.240
They would do the
manufacturing for me.

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:53.430
So that's how we kept
up with production.

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:57.070
I had to outsource it, because
I didn't have the capability

00:09:57.070 --> 00:09:59.126
to do any of the
molding or anything.

00:09:59.126 --> 00:10:00.750
BRIAN: And so, at
some point, then, you

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:02.999
decided to split with Westone,
and start manufacturing

00:10:02.999 --> 00:10:03.689
on your own.

00:10:03.689 --> 00:10:05.230
So again, when you're
in a situation,

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:14.235
as a small business owner,
where all of a sudden, you--

00:10:14.235 --> 00:10:16.610
Where all of a sudden, you
can't interrupt your business,

00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:18.470
but you just start doing
things you haven't done before.

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:20.040
So how do you just,
out of nowhere,

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:22.230
learn to manufacture
the shells as well?

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:23.688
Without interrupting
your business?

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:28.280
JERRY: We were having a
kind of a little divorce

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:30.390
situation going on between
Westone and myself,

00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:34.640
and the president told me,
we can't really divorce,

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:36.640
because you don't know
how to build the product.

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:39.800
So you're going to just
kind of have to toe the line

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:40.470
and do this.

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:42.900
So I decided to go
to Florida, and learn

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:44.360
how to build hearing aids.

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:46.656
And I went to a place
called Electone.

00:10:46.656 --> 00:10:48.030
And I stayed there
for two weeks,

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:49.730
trying to learn how
to build shells,

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:52.610
and to do hearing
aid fabrication.

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:54.851
And realized that
I was not going

00:10:54.851 --> 00:10:56.850
to be able to get the
skill set within two weeks

00:10:56.850 --> 00:10:59.970
to start my own lab, so
I hired the instructor.

00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:02.282
And I said, hey, if
I double your salary,

00:11:02.282 --> 00:11:04.240
will you come to Vegas
and start a lab with me?

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:05.489
And he said, yeah, no problem.

00:11:05.489 --> 00:11:07.380
So he shows up.

00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:10.210
I had bought all this
equipment, and he's,

00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:12.241
like, you bought all
the stuff that's wrong.

00:11:12.241 --> 00:11:12.740
You know?

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:14.424
So I was, like, great.

00:11:14.424 --> 00:11:16.090
And I had a little
light to make shells,

00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:17.990
it was about six
inches by six inches,

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:19.656
and he called it the
Barbie tanning bed.

00:11:19.656 --> 00:11:22.450
He goes, I can't make your
pieces with Barbie tanning bed.

00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:26.360
So we revamped, and we continued
to let Westone manufacture,

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:29.750
and then we basically
developed the process that

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:33.090
now is kind of what
all of the companies

00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:35.580
are doing, as far as the
ultraviolet cure shells,

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:38.940
so, we figured it out.

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:40.580
We decided, OK, now
we're ready to go,

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:43.300
so started building
all the stuff in house.

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:48.070
So the first 100 pair I built,
I rebuilt them maybe four times.

00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:50.147
And my customers
were really cool,

00:11:50.147 --> 00:11:51.522
because I was
telling them, well,

00:11:51.522 --> 00:11:52.680
I trying to learn
how to build this.

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:54.471
They would fail, and
they'd send them back,

00:11:54.471 --> 00:11:57.380
but within about 90 days
we had the process down,

00:11:57.380 --> 00:12:00.373
and everybody supported
us out in the pro market.

00:12:00.373 --> 00:12:04.860
So that's how
Ultimate Ears-- that's

00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:07.217
how my manufacturing
side got started.

00:12:07.217 --> 00:12:07.925
Out of necessity.

00:12:10.311 --> 00:12:11.810
BRIAN: So during
this whole process,

00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:13.690
you're still mixing for bands.

00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:16.154
You were mixing for Kiss,
and for all these bands,

00:12:16.154 --> 00:12:17.820
and I've heard some
interesting stories.

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:19.290
One of them that I
read was about how

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:20.790
you had some interesting
shouting matches

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:22.410
with Gene Simmons, where he
thought he was shouting at you,

00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:24.875
but it turns out you
may not have been there.

00:12:24.875 --> 00:12:27.500
JERRY: Yeah, in Gene's defense,
the equipment back then was not

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:29.791
really good, and maybe I
didn't have the chops, either,

00:12:29.791 --> 00:12:35.550
but we had some monumental,
historic squabbles

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:37.550
back and forth, kind of
like a husband and wife.

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:42.450
We were in a truck stop
one night, and I look over,

00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:45.220
and there's this cardboard
cut-out, full size,

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:46.560
of "Big Daddy" Don Garlits.

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:49.687
He's holding a Kendall
oil can, right?

00:12:49.687 --> 00:12:51.020
I said, I'm going to steal that.

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:51.603
So I stole it.

00:12:51.603 --> 00:12:54.890
I took it, I put it on the
bus, and from that point on--

00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:57.944
I put a Kiss t-shirt on it, and
then I put a bunch of scruff

00:12:57.944 --> 00:12:59.860
on it, because I was so
miserable on that tour

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:00.776
that I wouldn't shave.

00:13:00.776 --> 00:13:02.240
So I kind of made
it look like me.

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:04.120
I put a Kiss hat on it.

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:06.470
And we always had this
scrim in front of us.

00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:08.340
It was like a black
mesh scrim, but I

00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:11.250
had to have a light on my
face, so Gene could see my face

00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:17.290
when he was, as you could
say, maybe, talking to me.

00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:19.990
So every time I would
get upset with Gene,

00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:22.234
I would tell my third
man, give me "Big Daddy."

00:13:22.234 --> 00:13:24.650
So what I would do is, I would
take the cardboard cut-out,

00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:26.358
and I'd put it behind
the mixing console,

00:13:26.358 --> 00:13:28.080
and I'd walk off
and take a breather,

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:29.090
and not be mad anymore.

00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:30.673
And when I'd cool
down, I'd come back.

00:13:30.673 --> 00:13:32.340
Well, that might be
four or five songs.

00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:33.660
And then Gene would
come over, and start

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:35.035
yelling at the
cardboard cut-out.

00:13:35.035 --> 00:13:37.676
And everybody on stage knew
about it, but he didn't, right?

00:13:37.676 --> 00:13:39.300
So it got to be kind
of a running joke,

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:41.110
and we had to put him up
there more than-- actually, I

00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:43.660
think the cardboard cut-out
probably made more money than I

00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:45.270
did on that tour after that.

00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:47.870
So that's kind of the
"Big Daddy" story.

00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:49.650
BRIAN: Cool.

00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:53.460
So I want to talk
a bit about JH,

00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:56.654
but before that, I want to
talk about how you realized,

00:13:56.654 --> 00:13:58.820
OK, well, you're selling
these really high-end units

00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:00.444
to rock stars that
cost a lot of money,

00:14:00.444 --> 00:14:01.870
they're very highly customized.

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:03.620
At some point, you
realize that everyone's

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:05.710
running around listening
to really bad earphones,

00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:07.930
and there's an opportunity
there for consumer, too.

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:10.420
So I want to talk about what
it takes for someone who's

00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:13.044
used to making $1,000
units, $2,000 units, what

00:14:13.044 --> 00:14:15.210
do you do when you decide,
OK, I want to make things

00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:17.501
for a market that can't afford
to spend more than $100,

00:14:17.501 --> 00:14:19.220
or $200, and how that happens?

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:22.264
How you become a kind of
split between pro and sort

00:14:22.264 --> 00:14:24.736
of the lower end consumer?

00:14:24.736 --> 00:14:27.650
JERRY: Obviously, that change
came about with the iPod.

00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:32.000
Because before the iPod, people
would buy $60, $100 CD players,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.800
and no one wanted to
spend more than $50

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:36.160
for a set of Sony buds.

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:40.272
2003, I was mixing
the Linkin Park guys,

00:14:40.272 --> 00:14:42.730
and the production assistant
walks up and hands me an iPod.

00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:44.274
I was like, what is this thing?

00:14:44.274 --> 00:14:46.440
So she explains that there's
a bunch of songs on it,

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:48.430
and I put my earpieces
in, and I listen.

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:50.820
I go, it's a pretty good fit.

00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:52.730
The earpieces sound
good with the player.

00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:56.320
So I quit the tour, came
back, because the lab's going,

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:58.070
so I'm still touring
with bands and stuff,

00:14:58.070 --> 00:15:00.860
so I quit the tour to come back
and start, like, a consumer

00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:02.080
division.

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:04.960
And it was an
interesting experience,

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:08.250
because these forums had just
started, like Head-Fi and all

00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:11.751
of that, and went
out and spoke Apple

00:15:11.751 --> 00:15:13.250
at the time, because
they were iPod,

00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:15.360
and they gave us some support.

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:20.130
But we actually grew--
I think in three years,

00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:22.850
we grew 1,000%, just
off of the consumers.

00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:25.040
So I ended up having
to build a lower cost

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:27.950
unit that the
consumers would buy.

00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:30.106
And what's kind of crazy
now is, it's shifted.

00:15:30.106 --> 00:15:31.480
The consumers are
more interested

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:34.530
in the high-end stuff,
especially Southeast Asian,

00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:38.425
people that really
appreciate the audio quality.

00:15:38.425 --> 00:15:40.550
In the beginning, we thought
we had to really build

00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:44.640
these low cost earpieces,
and now, today, everybody's

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:50.260
used to buying more top shelf
stuff than the more reasonably

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:50.914
priced stuff.

00:15:50.914 --> 00:15:52.580
BRIAN: And is the
technology moving down

00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:53.710
from the really high-end?

00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:54.970
Is it getting cheaper
to manufacture,

00:15:54.970 --> 00:15:56.760
so you can put really
high-end equipment?

00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:58.220
Or did the cost pretty
much stay the same?

00:15:58.220 --> 00:15:59.970
JERRY: No, the costs
are staying the same,

00:15:59.970 --> 00:16:03.850
because the companies
that build the components,

00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:05.520
they know they have a monopoly.

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:09.754
Even though I design them and
I have them build to my specs,

00:16:09.754 --> 00:16:11.670
they still know they're
the only game in town.

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:13.360
There's only a
couple-- two companies

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:14.660
that build the components.

00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:16.534
They've kept the cost
of the components high,

00:16:16.534 --> 00:16:20.530
so it's really kind of hard
to get anything really,

00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:21.505
really cheap.

00:16:21.505 --> 00:16:24.300
I don't think you'll
ever see a $100 multi

00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:26.150
driver earpiece,
until they decide

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:28.719
they want to increase volume,
versus the profit margin.

00:16:28.719 --> 00:16:30.760
BRIAN: And so that was
sort of the next question.

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:33.600
So how is it that the two
companies that you founded,

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:35.384
JH and Ultimate Ears,
are the companies

00:16:35.384 --> 00:16:36.300
that everyone goes to?

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:38.383
Why is nobody else able
to break into this market?

00:16:38.383 --> 00:16:39.275
Is it because of you?

00:16:39.275 --> 00:16:40.650
Because the
components are just--

00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:42.990
you've locked up the market,
or-- why can no one else

00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:43.590
compete here?

00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:47.210
JERRY: Well, I'd like to say it
was me, but-- but no, it's not.

00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:49.890
Ultimate Ears is just a brand
that's been around since 1995,

00:16:49.890 --> 00:16:52.210
so people know the brand.

00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:55.550
All of the components that
I use inside my earphones

00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:58.070
are built to my
specs, so they're not

00:16:58.070 --> 00:16:59.310
off the shelf components.

00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:02.220
They may have the same
can sizes-- what anybody

00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:04.290
can buy and put into a
shell-- but they're all

00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:06.200
to my spec, my impedance curves.

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:09.890
So I think that Ultimate
Ears, when I was there,

00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:12.440
and Jerry Harvey Audio
now, I think it's

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:17.770
more of the audio signature
and performance that

00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:20.400
keeps people coming back to us.

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:23.000
It's really easy now to
learn how to build a mold

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.900
and put a bunch of
components in it, but it's

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:28.560
getting those components
tuned, and in phase,

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:30.240
and to play correctly
with each other,

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:34.596
that actually-- the
end result is better

00:17:34.596 --> 00:17:35.845
if you know what you're doing.

00:17:35.845 --> 00:17:38.610
I'm not saying that I'm the
only person who knows that,

00:17:38.610 --> 00:17:43.030
but I think the end user,
when they compare A,

00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:46.786
B, C, and D, when they listen,
they can actually hear,

00:17:46.786 --> 00:17:49.330
kind of, the audio
signature that I think

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:51.695
is pleasing to most people.

00:17:51.695 --> 00:17:55.084
BRIAN: So let's then talk
about JH Audio, then.

00:17:55.084 --> 00:17:56.500
So you sell Ultimate
Ears, and you

00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:58.083
decide to start out
on your own again.

00:17:58.083 --> 00:17:59.710
And so, what's
different this time?

00:17:59.710 --> 00:18:01.980
You're again starting
out from zero,

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:04.565
and you have this
big user base, and--

00:18:04.565 --> 00:18:06.700
JERRY: Look, I didn't
sell Ultimate Ears.

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:10.680
I kind of was on the
backside of that.

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:13.420
Watch venture capital,
and I'll leave it at that.

00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:16.532
So we started Jerry
Harvey Audio, JH Audio,

00:18:16.532 --> 00:18:18.240
and I had a little
bit of a break period,

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:20.340
because I had a non-compete.

00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:23.820
But I wasn't done
designing the earphones.

00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:26.494
I had designs I'd been working
on for that two-year period

00:18:26.494 --> 00:18:28.410
that I wanted to get out
into the marketplace.

00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:33.680
So for me, JH Audio is just a
continuation of Ultimate Ears,

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:35.540
and just gives me
a platform to keep

00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:38.365
designing products and trying
to push the technology forward.

00:18:38.365 --> 00:18:40.530
BRIAN: And so what are
you doing differently now?

00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:42.160
You've been in this
business for a long time,

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:43.440
and so you're releasing
things like Roxanne,

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:44.850
which no one's ever seen before.

00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:46.180
So what's everyone else doing?

00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:48.159
Are they seeing this,
and-- what's happening?

00:18:48.159 --> 00:18:50.200
JERRY: I'm not sure what
the competition's doing,

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:54.260
but I just keep finding new
ways to improve the technology.

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:58.570
Like things that
are very obvious,

00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:00.810
that I overlooked for 15 years.

00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:01.795
Time and phase.

00:19:01.795 --> 00:19:04.170
You have to make sure that
everything's in time and phase

00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:06.290
in order to have a
proper phase curve.

00:19:08.704 --> 00:19:10.120
When I was working
on the Roxanne,

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:12.795
I discovered that if
I could put everything

00:19:12.795 --> 00:19:14.170
in time, the low,
mid, and highs,

00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:15.830
within a hundredth
of a millisecond,

00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:17.950
that I had a perfectly
flat phase response.

00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:22.480
Which is what gives
you the imaging.

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:25.210
Especially in the center image,
where there's no interaction.

00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:27.980
Any phase cancellation's
going to take place

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:29.930
where the center image works.

00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:32.170
So I think the biggest
thing-- there's

00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:35.740
two things that I believe
that have set Jerry Harvey

00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:37.890
Audio apart from everyone else.

00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:39.960
Time phase-- making
sure everything's

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:42.460
in correct time and
phase-- and then

00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:44.570
figuring out how to get
the top-end extension out

00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:47.640
of a balanced armature earpiece.

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:49.620
It's really easy
to get lows, mids.

00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:52.890
Getting any top-end
extension above 10 k

00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:56.144
is the difficult part, because
of how balanced armatures work.

00:19:56.144 --> 00:19:58.310
BRIAN: All right, so that's
a good lead in, I guess,

00:19:58.310 --> 00:19:59.559
for the next set of questions.

00:19:59.559 --> 00:20:03.560
I'm curious about your thoughts
on modern audio engineering.

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:05.680
Lots of people here listen
to Spotify, or Google,

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:07.432
Google Music, things like this.

00:20:07.432 --> 00:20:08.640
And these are all compressed.

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:10.872
So what does this do for
you, as a designer, when

00:20:10.872 --> 00:20:12.830
you have to make products
that people are using

00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:17.310
to listen to compressed-- that
may be very different from what

00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:19.249
the pros are listening to.

00:20:19.249 --> 00:20:21.540
JERRY: I would never design
a product that sounded good

00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:23.030
with low quality audio.

00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:27.500
So my basic concept for
designing an audio product

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:29.664
is to make it
straight-through plumbing.

00:20:29.664 --> 00:20:31.580
That you should get out
of it exactly what you

00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:34.200
put into it, with varying
degrees of bass response,

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:36.980
because bass is like spice--
some people like bland food,

00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:38.180
some people like spicy food.

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:40.012
So no one ever
tells me, you know,

00:20:40.012 --> 00:20:43.580
I really don't want-- I don't
want an accurate frequency

00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:45.510
response, but they
always ask me how much

00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:48.920
bass does an
earpiece have in it.

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:51.510
So my concept is
to make an earpiece

00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:56.060
that, every time you make
the audio signal better

00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:59.340
that the ear piece
reproduces, will ramp up

00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:02.160
with a higher
quality audio signal.

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:05.070
Nowadays you have these
high resolution players,

00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:08.900
like the Astell Kern players
that are doing 192 files,

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:12.600
they're doing DSD with dual
DACs and killer headphone amps,

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:17.230
so those players really shine
with a good set of headphones,

00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:19.050
or a good set of earpieces.

00:21:19.050 --> 00:21:20.890
And I will say that,
when you do have

00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:23.900
a really good set of
headphones, or earphones,

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:27.830
when you play a low res file,
you hear a low res file.

00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:32.572
So I would never design anything
to try to polish that up.

00:21:32.572 --> 00:21:34.780
BRIAN: It sort of reminds
me when CDs first came out,

00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:36.040
when they said there was
a warning on the CD that

00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:37.790
says, warning-- this
may reveal weaknesses

00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:39.060
in the original recording.

00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:41.476
Because this is digital, and
it was recorded really poorly

00:21:41.476 --> 00:21:42.917
10 years ago.

00:21:42.917 --> 00:21:45.250
JERRY: I think that that's
the beauty of the recordings,

00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:45.420
though.

00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:47.130
Some of those old
analog recordings,

00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:50.580
even when you hear
them remastered,

00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:53.122
they still sound--
they sound analog.

00:21:53.122 --> 00:21:54.580
And they sound
amazing, and I think

00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:57.340
listening to an old recording
that's been remastered

00:21:57.340 --> 00:22:00.180
is still pretty cool.

00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:03.530
Listen to some of the
songs in the '60s.

00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:06.300
They had such good melodies,
and such good hooks.

00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:09.010
You were listening to
it on an AM radio that

00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:13.030
had limited frequency response,
but the song still rocked.

00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:16.820
Either it was a good
song, or it wasn't.

00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:18.680
I appreciate the old
recordings, and I

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:21.740
think that hearing it the
way it was recorded back

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:25.040
then, but in high
res, is really cool.

00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:26.680
BRIAN: So I guess
the last one is,

00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:29.620
so JH traditionally is
making professional IEMs.

00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:31.290
But the consumer
market is enormous.

00:22:31.290 --> 00:22:32.885
So how do you market
into that market?

00:22:32.885 --> 00:22:34.010
How do you break into that?

00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:37.460
How do you convince people who
think that the iPod earphones

00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:39.290
that they get-- how
do you convince people

00:22:39.290 --> 00:22:40.760
there's something better?

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:44.820
JERRY: Well, I think, because of
Google, and because of the way

00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:47.610
that the world works now,
especially the internet,

00:22:47.610 --> 00:22:50.430
anybody that just puts
in "a better headphone"

00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:52.600
is going to end up at
one of the chat rooms,

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:55.532
the head-fi dot-- I
don't know-- dot org,

00:22:55.532 --> 00:22:56.490
or something like that.

00:22:56.490 --> 00:22:59.150
So I think that people
do their research,

00:22:59.150 --> 00:23:02.330
and by doing their research,
they kind of stumble upon me.

00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:04.370
Or Ultimate Ears, or
one of our companies.

00:23:04.370 --> 00:23:05.920
BRIAN: And so
also, you mentioned

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:09.959
that all the high-end
products that JH makes

00:23:09.959 --> 00:23:12.000
are all custom fit, except
for the Roxanne, which

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.960
you mentioned has a
universal fit as well.

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:17.715
So is the movement for
consumer towards universal fit,

00:23:17.715 --> 00:23:19.340
I assume, because it
is easier to sell?

00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:20.152
Right?

00:23:20.152 --> 00:23:21.860
JERRY: People want
instant gratification,

00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:24.980
but I think they also want
higher quality audio out

00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:27.240
of the one size fits all.

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:29.630
The trend in Southeast
Asia, which hasn't quite

00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:33.370
hit America yet, is that,
there's a few companies that

00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:37.200
were building high-end,
one size fits all.

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:39.590
They were also custom companies.

00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:41.500
So the audio quality
was increasing.

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:46.430
It wasn't the $200 to
$300 mass produced out

00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:47.990
of China earphones.

00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:49.639
They're selling
things for-- Shure

00:23:49.639 --> 00:23:52.180
just put out a new product, the
846, which is a good product,

00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:53.710
for $1,200.

00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:55.710
And a company called
FitEar, a Japanese company,

00:23:55.710 --> 00:23:57.190
has a product that's $1,500.

00:23:57.190 --> 00:24:00.230
That's one size fits all--
it's not even custom.

00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:02.784
So when I saw that
trend, for me,

00:24:02.784 --> 00:24:04.950
I always want to one-up
everyone in the marketplace,

00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:07.414
so I took my new
product, Roxanne,

00:24:07.414 --> 00:24:09.080
and just made a
universal fit out of it,

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:13.570
so I could kind of, like, one-up
everyone, and it's amazing.

00:24:13.570 --> 00:24:15.570
It's an expensive product,
but we can't build it

00:24:15.570 --> 00:24:18.950
fast enough in the
one size fits all.

00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:23.780
I think that anybody
that appreciates audio,

00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:26.940
and if they get
what they pay for,

00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:29.110
if they want a good
product, it's available now.

00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:31.667
Before, that option
wasn't available.

00:24:31.667 --> 00:24:34.000
BRIAN: And are you selling
the universal fits in stores,

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.210
or are they still
only sold directly?

00:24:36.210 --> 00:24:38.710
JERRY: The universal fits are
only sold through our dealers.

00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:40.785
So Julie is one of our
dealers in New York.

00:24:40.785 --> 00:24:41.410
She sells them.

00:24:41.410 --> 00:24:45.930
And then we have dealers
all across the country.

00:24:45.930 --> 00:24:48.600
We'll have, I think,
Earphone Solutions.

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:50.430
There's a couple other
companies out there

00:24:50.430 --> 00:24:53.430
that'll start selling
them here pretty soon.

00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:55.430
So those aren't sold
direct at the present time.

00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:56.980
They're all sold
through our dealers,

00:24:56.980 --> 00:24:58.875
and they'll be listed
on the website shortly.

00:24:58.875 --> 00:24:59.740
We just launched it.

00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:01.323
BRIAN: Does anyone
have any questions?

00:25:01.323 --> 00:25:04.710
About audio engineering, about
rock stars, about anything?

00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:07.764
So please come to the
mic if you want to talk.

00:25:07.764 --> 00:25:09.180
AUDIENCE: Thanks
for coming today.

00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:10.950
I have a set of
Triple Fi 10's there.

00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:12.780
JERRY: Oh, cool.

00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:15.610
AUDIENCE: But I was just curious
about the trend that music

00:25:15.610 --> 00:25:18.950
is taking now, with, I guess,
recorded music becoming

00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:21.110
more compressed in general?

00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:23.890
And how you're taking
that into account

00:25:23.890 --> 00:25:26.205
with how you design
headphones, where you have

00:25:26.205 --> 00:25:30.180
an even response in your
earpieces, but the music

00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:32.675
itself may not be
up to par for that--

00:25:32.675 --> 00:25:34.540
for what people are
starting to listen to.

00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:36.930
So I was just curious
how you're handling that.

00:25:36.930 --> 00:25:40.030
JERRY: Well, I'll touch on it.

00:25:40.030 --> 00:25:42.660
I don't change the way I build
a product, or tune a product,

00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:45.340
for the lower compressed files.

00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:47.200
But I do think that
what's happening

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:51.700
is that people are becoming more
aware of the high resolution

00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:52.850
files out on the internet.

00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:54.900
Like you have hdtracks.net.

00:25:54.900 --> 00:26:00.070
You have about a half
dozen websites out

00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:02.920
there that you can actually
download pretty much any album

00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:06.690
that you've ever loved in 192,
that's been remastered-- or not

00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:09.580
remastered, but at least 96 k.

00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:12.920
So I think the
trend-- obviously,

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:17.080
anybody that's listening
to very compressed music

00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:18.340
is not an audiophile.

00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:21.784
They probably will be OK with
a normal set of headphones.

00:26:21.784 --> 00:26:24.034
AUDIENCE: My question is
more how the bands themselves

00:26:24.034 --> 00:26:25.254
are recording [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:28.627 --> 00:26:29.960
JERRY: Yeah, it's kind of crazy.

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:33.360
You listen to some of these
records that are mastered,

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:36.350
they're mastered so
they sound really loud.

00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:41.990
That's just a preference of
whoever the mix engineer is.

00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:43.580
Whoever's doing the mastering.

00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:46.940
But I hope that that trend
of making things compressed

00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:51.100
and sounding really kind of
loud, kind of like the-- well,

00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:57.060
I won't mention any bands-- that
that trend actually reverses,

00:26:57.060 --> 00:27:00.090
and people are trying to
get a more analog sound out

00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:04.250
of it, instead that
highly compressed sound.

00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:06.670
I'm not recording engineer,
I'm a live sound engineer,

00:27:06.670 --> 00:27:10.110
so I'm not really in tune
with the recording process

00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:12.430
of what they're doing in
the studios these days.

00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:14.679
BRIAN: That's actually an
interesting follow up I had.

00:27:16.765 --> 00:27:18.890
So you're mixing what the
band is hearing on stage,

00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:19.860
and there's a guy in
the audience who's

00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:21.359
mixing what the
audience is hearing.

00:27:21.359 --> 00:27:22.982
So what are the differences?

00:27:22.982 --> 00:27:24.440
What are the
differences in how you

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:26.560
mix for the band versus how
they mix for the audience?

00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:28.351
JERRY: Well, I have to
make the band happy.

00:27:28.351 --> 00:27:30.847
So it's kind of like Burger
King "have it your way."

00:27:30.847 --> 00:27:32.055
It's like a service industry.

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:38.680
There's a lot of people I
work for that I would never

00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:40.380
get that sound on my
own that they like

00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:42.000
to listen to while
they're performing.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.330
So I basically interact with
the band, and I please the band.

00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:48.280
And the front house engineer has
to please the guitar player's

00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:50.370
girlfriend, he has to
please the manager,

00:27:50.370 --> 00:27:52.560
so it's a totally different
concept out front.

00:27:56.030 --> 00:27:57.840
You're judged by a
lot of other people,

00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:01.461
and reviews in the
newspaper, and-- for me, I

00:28:01.461 --> 00:28:02.960
get an instant
review from the band.

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:03.980
Either they like
it or they don't.

00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:06.510
So it's kind of less pressure
than being the guy out front

00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:08.116
that's totally under
the microscope.

00:28:08.116 --> 00:28:09.740
BRIAN: Well, is it
common for the bands

00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:11.480
to want to listen, though, to
what the audience is hearing,

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:13.710
so they know what
they're experiencing?

00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:15.090
JERRY: Well, it's really funny.

00:28:15.090 --> 00:28:16.650
What they do-- they
always get a board tape

00:28:16.650 --> 00:28:17.320
at the end of the night.

00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:18.990
Now they have,
basically, pro tools,

00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:21.700
so they can kind
of do a quick mix.

00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:25.240
But the funny thing is, is
now that-- the last Van Halen

00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:30.010
tour I did, Alex would come in
with a cellphone and a YouTube

00:28:30.010 --> 00:28:32.440
clip, and go, listen to
what this sounds like.

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:34.780
And we're, like,
well, we don't even

00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:39.336
know what part of the building
that guy was sitting in, right?

00:28:39.336 --> 00:28:42.150
So some people want to
listen to the YouTube stuff,

00:28:42.150 --> 00:28:44.870
and try to make it sound-- like,
Alex wants it to sound good,

00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:49.820
and translate to that AM
radio-sounding cellphone.

00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:53.190
And then other bands who just
want to hear a full mix down

00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:56.910
of multi track that's
gone down to a CD

00:28:56.910 --> 00:28:59.160
at the end of the night, so
they can review if they're

00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:00.940
performing right, or
what it sounds like.

00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:03.170
But the only thing
that you hear if you're

00:29:03.170 --> 00:29:05.790
a musician, unless you're
going out in front of the PA,

00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:09.020
all you're hearing is a bunch
of slap off the back wall,

00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:11.970
and low-end coming off
the PA, so you really

00:29:11.970 --> 00:29:14.710
have no idea what it sounds
like in the front of the house.

00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:16.627
You just have to trust
the people that are out

00:29:16.627 --> 00:29:18.418
in front, that are your
people, to give you

00:29:18.418 --> 00:29:20.430
a straight story of what
it sounds like, right?

00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:22.970
BRIAN: Yep.

00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:25.340
AUDIENCE: Thanks for coming
in and talking to us.

00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:26.870
I'm sure there's a lot
of engineers in the room.

00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:28.440
I was wondering if you
could talk through some

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:30.190
of the technical
considerations you make,

00:29:30.190 --> 00:29:32.400
in terms of designing
your headphones?

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:35.110
So I'm thinking about how
you choose your crossovers?

00:29:35.110 --> 00:29:38.770
Is a flat frequency
response the ideal response?

00:29:38.770 --> 00:29:42.150
How you deal with phase issues,
if you have two bass drivers,

00:29:42.150 --> 00:29:43.012
for example?

00:29:43.012 --> 00:29:45.220
So if you could just talk
through those a little bit.

00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:46.910
JERRY: Sure.

00:29:46.910 --> 00:29:48.900
First of all, I would
never tune anything flat.

00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:50.674
I think flat's boring.

00:29:50.674 --> 00:29:53.090
Kick drums shouldn't sound
like a baseball hitting a mitt,

00:29:53.090 --> 00:29:54.859
right?

00:29:54.859 --> 00:29:56.275
But that's my
personal preference,

00:29:56.275 --> 00:29:58.780
so I always tune things a
little bit more bottom end.

00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:04.450
But as far as-- I'll just
speak to the phase first.

00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:06.560
When you're using multi
driver components,

00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:08.820
they all have different
time signatures.

00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:10.390
Just like a PA system.

00:30:10.390 --> 00:30:12.550
The low frequencies
are longer sound waves,

00:30:12.550 --> 00:30:14.440
and high frequencies
are much shorter.

00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:19.040
So in a PA system, if you
look at it without any time

00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:21.027
correction, the highs
are going to be early,

00:30:21.027 --> 00:30:22.860
the mids are going to
be a little bit later,

00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:24.568
and the lows are going
to be really slow.

00:30:24.568 --> 00:30:27.796
So what you do, and nowadays
you don't have to do it,

00:30:27.796 --> 00:30:29.860
but what the DSP's done
is they've basically

00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:31.360
delayed the mids,
delayed the highs,

00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:33.282
so everything arrives
at the same time, right?

00:30:33.282 --> 00:30:34.990
And then you put it
in time with the sub.

00:30:34.990 --> 00:30:37.590
So that's kind of what
I've done in the earpiece,

00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:39.640
but I've done a
physical wave guide.

00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:43.479
So I discovered that-- we've
got better software now,

00:30:43.479 --> 00:30:44.770
because of the power of the PC.

00:30:44.770 --> 00:30:47.440
I can test phase
curves, and I can

00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:49.896
get within hundredth of a
millisecond on the impulse

00:30:49.896 --> 00:30:51.520
time of those little
miniature drivers.

00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:54.060
So I found that
as soon as I went

00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:55.970
within a hundredth
of a millisecond,

00:30:55.970 --> 00:30:59.200
that the crossover points
became perfect, where I actually

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:01.360
had to change my
crossover shapes

00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:04.150
because they became so efficient
at the crossover points,

00:31:04.150 --> 00:31:07.400
and that the phase
response basically became,

00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:10.720
not perfectly flat, but no more
than 10 degrees off of zero,

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:12.780
which is unheard of
in an in-ear monitor,

00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:16.250
because they're pretty
much-- up until that point,

00:31:16.250 --> 00:31:18.340
were all out of phase.

00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:21.200
Either at the crossover point,
or some of the old drivers

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:24.290
were just out of phase across
the bandwidth just internally,

00:31:24.290 --> 00:31:26.260
right?

00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:28.230
So that's the phase side of it.

00:31:28.230 --> 00:31:31.490
The other big obstacle,
as I mentioned earlier,

00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:32.770
is high frequency response.

00:31:32.770 --> 00:31:35.445
So when I design-- like
this new piece, the Roxanne.

00:31:37.970 --> 00:31:41.560
The first in-ear
monitor I designed?

00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:43.740
The high frequency
extension rolled off at 8 k,

00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:47.450
and there was no way that
we could get it to go out

00:31:47.450 --> 00:31:49.870
any further, and
that's because the way

00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:52.250
that a balanced armature
impedance curve works.

00:31:52.250 --> 00:31:56.150
So what happens is, as
it goes up in frequency,

00:31:56.150 --> 00:31:57.630
the impedance rises.

00:31:57.630 --> 00:32:01.940
So you may have
10 ohms in a 1 k,

00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:04.329
and you'll have
100 ohms at 20 k.

00:32:04.329 --> 00:32:05.870
So what happens is,
the headphone amp

00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:09.880
doesn't see a load, and
the high end roll off

00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:12.810
is inverse to the rise
in the impedance curve.

00:32:12.810 --> 00:32:16.050
So it looks like a hockey stick,
and it does the same thing.

00:32:16.050 --> 00:32:17.650
What I found is,
that if I can change

00:32:17.650 --> 00:32:19.380
the shape of the
impedance curve,

00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:24.190
that I can actually get more
high frequency extension.

00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:26.850
The reason I use four
drivers on the Roxanne

00:32:26.850 --> 00:32:30.945
is because I could
actually tune those coils.

00:32:30.945 --> 00:32:34.900
If you do DC, from
10 Hertz to 20 k,

00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:36.840
the thing will measure 1/2 ohm.

00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:39.930
But as soon as you
high pass it out to 4k,

00:32:39.930 --> 00:32:43.680
it measures 20 ohms, right?

00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:44.180
Right there.

00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:47.450
So what I ended up doing was,
by having four components,

00:32:47.450 --> 00:32:49.300
I could wire them
all in parallel,

00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:52.335
high pass them, and have
the headphone amp see a load

00:32:52.335 --> 00:32:54.622
at 20 k, which is
why the Roxanne is

00:32:54.622 --> 00:32:57.080
the first earpiece I've ever
got that will go out past 20 k

00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:59.800
before, and still have
usable information.

00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:02.300
Not down 12 or 14 dB,
or something like that.

00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:06.120
So that's the biggest time.

00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:09.020
And then, as far as
the audio response,

00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:10.640
I never tune anything flat.

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:11.930
I tune it accurate.

00:33:11.930 --> 00:33:14.080
So if you were to see
it on an FFT analyzer,

00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:16.330
you would get out of it
exactly what you put into it.

00:33:16.330 --> 00:33:17.980
I kind of shape the
top end roll off

00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:19.510
where I think it's pleasing.

00:33:19.510 --> 00:33:21.000
And then I set
the bass response.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.972
Like the new piece.

00:33:23.972 --> 00:33:25.680
Every day I answer
the question, how much

00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:27.700
base does a
particular model have?

00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:29.760
So with the new
piece I designed,

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:31.520
I put attenuators
on the bass driver,

00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:33.260
so you can set it
zero to plus 15.

00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:35.630
So you can basically set
the bass where you like it,

00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:39.022
so it kind of preempted
the conversation there.

00:33:39.022 --> 00:33:40.730
So did that answer
any of your questions?

00:33:40.730 --> 00:33:41.646
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:41.646 --> 00:33:43.350
JERRY: OK.

00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:43.920
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:45.370
I'm actually a live
engineer, so I've

00:33:45.370 --> 00:33:46.970
got a question sort of from
that side of the fence.

00:33:46.970 --> 00:33:47.990
JERRY: OK.

00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:50.620
AUDIENCE: In terms of modern
front of house systems,

00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:54.090
and even dynamic driver
monitor systems these days,

00:33:54.090 --> 00:33:57.070
DSP, like you sort of mentioned,
is a really big thing.

00:33:57.070 --> 00:34:01.510
So do you see that, sort of,
coming to the in-ear market?

00:34:01.510 --> 00:34:03.570
In terms of things
like customizability?

00:34:03.570 --> 00:34:06.300
So the bass response, the
high response, whatever,

00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:08.300
change against, sort
of, that person's taste?

00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:09.716
Even in the consumer
market, where

00:34:09.716 --> 00:34:12.620
you don't have a monitor guide
to sort of boost your top end,

00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:14.620
or whatever?

00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:17.210
JERRY: I see that coming
in the near future.

00:34:17.210 --> 00:34:21.159
I built a three-way
amplifier a couple years ago,

00:34:21.159 --> 00:34:24.870
called the 3A, so it didn't give
the user the interface that I

00:34:24.870 --> 00:34:28.850
wanted it to, because it
was three amps in there.

00:34:28.850 --> 00:34:33.550
But I do believe that DSP,
equalization, and control

00:34:33.550 --> 00:34:37.080
of the circuit, for an
end user, is really close.

00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:42.040
I think the bottom end
control on the Roxanne

00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:43.340
is just the starting point.

00:34:45.714 --> 00:34:47.380
If you look at that
earpiece, I actually

00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:49.520
took the passive
crossover circuit--

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:51.170
there's four pins
at the earpiece,

00:34:51.170 --> 00:34:53.520
so you have ground,
low, mid, and high.

00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:55.429
So my idea is that
you could actually

00:34:55.429 --> 00:34:58.752
put an attenuator on any band,
and just do a broad low, mid,

00:34:58.752 --> 00:35:00.390
and high adjustment,
if you liked.

00:35:00.390 --> 00:35:03.360
I'm kind of doing an open market
to the cable manufacturers'

00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:05.150
aftermarket.

00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:06.896
And also, I think
that the only way

00:35:06.896 --> 00:35:09.270
that we're going to get any
more out of an in-ear monitor

00:35:09.270 --> 00:35:11.830
with the current technology
is going to be control-based.

00:35:11.830 --> 00:35:15.757
So that's been on my road
map for quite a while.

00:35:15.757 --> 00:35:17.590
But what I think that
really needs to happen

00:35:17.590 --> 00:35:21.620
is, I think that giving the
end user the control over being

00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:26.860
able to set the shape, the
equalization, to kind of mess

00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:29.840
around with the crossover--
that's what I would like.

00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:32.449
So to some people, that may
be above their skill set.

00:35:32.449 --> 00:35:33.990
It might need to be
a little simpler.

00:35:33.990 --> 00:35:36.020
But I think, at
the end of the day,

00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:38.027
that that's not too far off.

00:35:38.027 --> 00:35:38.860
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:39.760
That's all.

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:40.880
BRIAN: Is that control the
kind of thing you think

00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:41.900
will move into
your other models?

00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:43.775
So you think that other,
besides the Roxanne,

00:35:43.775 --> 00:35:45.580
will let you adjust
the bass, and so on?

00:35:45.580 --> 00:35:46.080
JERRY: Yeah.

00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:50.240
I think that that's going
to be an ongoing trend.

00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:52.160
And just giving the
end user more control

00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:55.625
over the audio signature.

00:35:55.625 --> 00:35:58.250
BRIAN: I guess it's interesting,
also, for the consumer market.

00:35:58.250 --> 00:35:59.390
Some people like
listening to rap,

00:35:59.390 --> 00:36:02.000
some people listen to rock, and
they have different opinions

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.375
of how much bass
there should be,

00:36:03.375 --> 00:36:05.460
and how much treble
there should be.

00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:08.420
JERRY: That's why I kind of
set the Roxanne that way.

00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:11.860
So if you want heavy bass,
it'll shake your fillings out.

00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:13.212
If you want flat, it's flat.

00:36:13.212 --> 00:36:14.295
BRIAN: Who needs fillings?

00:36:14.295 --> 00:36:14.794
JERRY: Yeah.

00:36:14.794 --> 00:36:15.896
Who needs fillings?

00:36:15.896 --> 00:36:18.680
BRIAN: Any other questions?

00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:19.180
Cool.

00:36:19.180 --> 00:36:19.780
JERRY: Thanks, guys.

00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:21.280
[APPLAUSE] Appreciate
your coming.

00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:21.880
Thank you.

00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:23.730
Thanks for coming.
