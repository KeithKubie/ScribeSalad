00:00:11.077 --> 00:00:12.345
- Hey, Lyle!

00:00:12.345 --> 00:00:13.980
What are you doing up there?

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.016
- This world is just too much.

00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:17.250
- Jupiter's way bigger.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.651
- Huh?

00:00:18.651 --> 00:00:21.721 align:start size:97% position:3%
- My favorite's planet
Melmac, it's where ALF's from.

00:00:21.721 --> 00:00:23.256
- I'm going to end it, Elmer.

00:00:23.256 --> 00:00:25.492
- Are you talking about
our FarmVille co-op?

00:00:25.492 --> 00:00:27.861
Who's gonna take care of
Sunflower Meadows with me?

00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:29.062
- Not FarmVille, me.

00:00:29.062 --> 00:00:30.296
I'm going to end me.

00:00:30.296 --> 00:00:32.232
Are you even listening?

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:36.436
- My favorite episode
was when ALF met Elvis.

00:00:36.436 --> 00:00:38.505
No cat's safe around ALF.

00:00:39.672 --> 00:00:41.207
- Shoulda just done
this in the tub.

- Come on, Lyle.

00:00:59.025 --> 00:01:01.061 align:start size:94% position:6%
You've got tons of reasons
not to kill yourself.

00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:04.831 align:start size:97% position:3%
Like your hair looked really
great a couple days ago

00:01:04.831 --> 00:01:09.002
and you like drinking water,
can't do that if you're dead.

00:01:09.903 --> 00:01:10.737
And

00:01:13.073 --> 00:01:15.241 align:start size:81% position:19%
I mentioned the
hair thing, right?

00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:18.078 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Lyle, I dunno if you're
a Christian or not,

00:01:18.078 --> 00:01:20.246
but let me put this delicately.

00:01:20.246 --> 00:01:23.950 align:start size:97% position:3%
If you kill yourself, you
goin' to motherfuckin' hell.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.185
- That's very delicate, Anita.

00:01:25.185 --> 00:01:26.686
- Hell is hot and shit!

00:01:26.686 --> 00:01:28.755
They gonna turn your butt
hole into fresh direct.

00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:30.023
- He's Buddhist.

00:01:30.023 --> 00:01:33.259
- That big boobied White
Castle Montel Williams?

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:35.495
Jesus could beat his ass, nigga.

00:01:35.495 --> 00:01:37.564
He could take out any nigga.

00:01:37.564 --> 00:01:38.598
- Not RoboCop.

00:01:38.598 --> 00:01:40.133
- Bullshit!

00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:43.269
That motherfucker looks like
an air conditioner's dick.

00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:45.705
- At that time in history,
Jesus could not properly

00:01:45.705 --> 00:01:48.141 align:start size:97% position:3%
train to combat a
cybernetic police officer--

00:01:48.141 --> 00:01:49.676
- I'm sick of this shit!

00:01:49.676 --> 00:01:52.979 align:start size:97% position:3%
First off, we all know that
RoboCop could kick Jesus' ass.

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.982 align:start size:88% position:13%
Second off, you're gonna
kill yourself, Lyle?

00:01:55.982 --> 00:01:57.217
You're gonna end it?

00:01:57.217 --> 00:01:59.953
Well, guess what, Lyle,
we're all miserable,

00:01:59.953 --> 00:02:02.956 align:start size:84% position:16%
but we come here every
day and do our job

00:02:02.956 --> 00:02:04.524
and do you know why that is?

00:02:04.524 --> 00:02:05.492
- No, not really.

00:02:05.492 --> 00:02:07.393
- Well, it's because...

00:02:08.995 --> 00:02:12.632 align:start size:84% position:16%
Wait, we have reasons
to live, right?

00:02:12.632 --> 00:02:13.933
- Of course we do.

00:02:13.933 --> 00:02:14.767
We...

00:02:17.403 --> 00:02:19.772
- Switching gears, Lyle,
if you don't kill yourself,

00:02:19.772 --> 00:02:21.875 align:start size:84% position:16%
you can break any
piece of art you want.

00:02:21.875 --> 00:02:23.042
- I like the art.

00:02:23.042 --> 00:02:24.310
- Don't be a hero!

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.012
Doesn't this stuff piss you off?

00:02:26.012 --> 00:02:28.181
(clay shattering)

00:02:28.181 --> 00:02:29.983
This one's even more retarded!

00:02:29.983 --> 00:02:33.653 align:start position:0%
It's got a lady holding an
umbrella but the sun's shining!

00:02:33.653 --> 00:02:35.421
Am I not gettin' somethin' here?

00:02:35.421 --> 00:02:37.590
You're not smarter than me!

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.125
(clay shattering)

00:02:39.125 --> 00:02:41.794
For the sake of your
friends, your family,

00:02:41.794 --> 00:02:44.664 align:start size:88% position:13%
the Kennedys, Martin
Luther King, the troops,

00:02:44.664 --> 00:02:47.767
Brittany Murphy, the
guy Radio was based on,

00:02:47.767 --> 00:02:49.235
don't kill yourself!

00:02:49.235 --> 00:02:52.672 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Lyle, I genuinely
don't wanna see you hurt.

00:02:52.672 --> 00:02:53.573
- Really?

00:02:53.573 --> 00:02:54.407
- Really.

00:02:54.407 --> 00:02:55.942
You're a nice guy.

00:02:55.942 --> 00:02:58.511
There's no reason for any
of us to kill ourselves.

00:02:58.511 --> 00:03:00.046
(clay shattering)

00:03:00.046 --> 00:03:03.082
There's no reason for most
of us to kill ourselves.

00:03:03.082 --> 00:03:05.552
- Okay, okay, I won't jump.

00:03:05.552 --> 00:03:06.953
(fan clunks on)

00:03:06.953 --> 00:03:07.787
Ahh!

00:03:07.787 --> 00:03:08.621
Ghost!

00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:09.455
(screaming)

00:03:09.455 --> 00:03:11.057
- Lyle!

00:03:11.057 --> 00:03:11.925
(thud)

00:03:11.925 --> 00:03:13.660
(Lyle grunting)

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.396
- Still alive.

00:03:16.396 --> 00:03:18.198 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Well, I'm glad
everything's back to normal.

00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:19.432
(Lyle gagging)

00:03:19.432 --> 00:03:21.534
(Elmer chuckling)

00:03:21.534 --> 00:03:23.469
- Same old Lyle.

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:27.440 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I don't even know what
you're going to do about this.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.274
- Taxi!

00:03:28.274 --> 00:03:29.475
(tires screech)

00:03:29.475 --> 00:03:30.443
- [Taxi Driver] Hey!

00:03:30.443 --> 00:03:31.311
