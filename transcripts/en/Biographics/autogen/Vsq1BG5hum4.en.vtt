00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.200
The leading generals of World War Two carried
a huge weight on their shoulders.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.810
Their decisions could mean the difference
between life and death for thousands of men;

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:11.640
their actions helped to shape the fate of
nations.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:16.309
History has judged some of them as fools,
others as butchers, and a handful as military

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:17.309
geniuses...

00:00:17.309 --> 00:00:22.539
Few, at least on the Allied side, have generated
as much controversy in life and death in as

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:24.079
George S Patton.

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:29.220
The flamboyant American commander never lost
a major battle, but his explosive temper almost

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.789
cost him his career.

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:35.941
He survived two World Wars, often placing
himself in considerable danger, only to die

00:00:35.941 --> 00:00:40.190
in unlikely circumstances within months of
Germany’s defeat.

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.640
The unconventional general was a devout Christian,
yet he believed he was just the latest incarnation

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:52.170
of a warrior spirit who’d once fought alongside
the likes of Julius Caesar and Napoleon Bonaparte.

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.260
He was the epitome of the rough, tough warrior
who reveled in his macho image and seemingly

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.219
lived only for war.

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.710
But he could be a surprisingly sensitive individual
who cried at funerals and penned poetry1 throughout

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.360
much of his life.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.330
In this Biographics video we are going to
dive right into the details of this mans life.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:29.640
“The object of war is not to die for your
country but to make the other bastard die

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.679
for his.”

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:32.679
- George S Patton
Early Life

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:36.320
George S Patton was in born in California
on November 11, 1885.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.229
Twenty years earlier the Patton family had
lost much of their wealth when they found

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.299
themselves on the losing side of America’s
civil war.

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.439
However, by the time of George’s birth the
Patton’s were prosperous and influential

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:47.549
once again.

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.079
The young George knew from an early age that
he wanted to be a soldier.

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.649
His main obstacles were his weaknesses in
maths and English.

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.070
This was not a result of any lack of natural
ability, but rather because his father’s

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.759
mistrust of formal education meant that George
hadn’t attended school until he reached

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:05.109
twelve years of age.

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:10.070
He caught up quickly but only narrowly passed
the entrance exam for West Point, America’s

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.319
most prestigious military academy.

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.450
While Patton would regularly clash with his
superiors during World War II, his conduct

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.510
at West Point was exemplary.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.349
He was particularly successful at sports such
as polo and football, playing with such relentless

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:25.650
aggression that he broke several bones.

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:31.819
He would later bring this aggression to his
method of waging war.

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:41.970
Olympic Games
Patton’s considerable sporting ability did

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.030
not go unnoticed, and he was selected to represent
2 the United States of America in the Modern

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.750
Pentathlon at the 1912 Stockholm Olympic Games.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.450
He would compete at riding, shooting, fencing,
running and swimming, all things that Patton

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:56.450
excelled at.

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.180
Interestingly, in the event it was Patton’s
shooting that may have let him down.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.670
He fired twenty bullets, but the judges ruled
that three of them had missed the target.

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.280
Patton remained adamant that his aim had actually
been too good and his shots had passed through

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.710
the hole he had already made in the bullseye.

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.409
It’s possible he was correct, but the judges
ruled against him.

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:21.170
At the end of the first day Patton was placed
in a slightly disappointing 21st from 41 competitors.

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.010
Strong performances in each of the remaining
events saw him climb all the way to fifth

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.010
place.

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.989
It was the first and last time he competed
in the Olympic Games, but he didn’t have

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:35.400
to wait long to test the accuracy of his shooting
in a combat situation…

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:46.480
Bandit Hunting
By 1916 most of the world’s great powers

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.709
were locked together in seemingly interminable
combat.

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:54.860
Only the United States had thus far succeeded
in avoiding being drawn into the slaughter.

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:00.060
However, America did suffer a surprise attack
from the direction of Mexico.

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:06.010
On 9 March 1916 four-hundred heavily-armed
bandits led by the notorious Francisco “Pancho”

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.879
Villa stormed across the border.

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:13.340
For two hours they ransacked and looted the
border town of Columbus, before finally being

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:14.740
chased away by the cavalry.

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:20.010
If Villa believed he could hide out safely
back in Mexico, he was sorely mistaken.

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.540
President Woodrow Wilson ordered the US Army
to cross the border and put an end to the

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:25.540
threat posed by Villa and his bandits.

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:30.320
John Pershing 3 was given command of the expeditionary
force, and he chose Patton to serve as his

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:31.320
aide.

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.910
Patton would go on to become famous for his
skill at commanding fast-moving motorized

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.730
forces, so it’s perhaps fitting that while
in Mexico he took part in the first motorized

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:42.100
action in the history of warfare 4.

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:47.360
Travelling in three Dodge Touring cars, Patton
and his men launched a raid on Villa’s henchmen.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.410
When the smoke cleared at the end of a brief
firefight, three of Villa’s bodyguards lay

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:52.410
dead.

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.080
Patton ordered their bodies to be strapped
to the cars for the drive back to headquarters.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:01.500
Pershing was apparently impressed, reportedly
saying: “This Patton boy, he’s a real

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.310
fighter!”

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:15.230
World War I
On 6 April 1917 the United States of America

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:18.850
declared war on Germany and entered World
War One.

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:23.260
Pershing was given command of the American
Expeditionary Force, and once again he took

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:24.480
George Patton at his side.

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:25.480
Not content to serve as an aide for long,
Patton pushed to be given a command of his

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:26.480
own.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:29.720
Pershing offered him an infantry battalion
but by that time Patton had become fascinated

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:35.590
by tanks - powerful yet unreliable weapons
still in their infancy since being unleashed

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:38.610
by the British at the Somme in September of
1916.

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:44.280
Patton became the first officer assigned to
the American Expeditionary Force Tank Corps,

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.850
was one of the first Americans to learn how
to operate a tank, and personally taught the

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:51.010
first crews to be assigned to the Tank Corps.

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:56.180
The American Expeditionary Force Tank Corps
finally went into action in September 1918,

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:00.660
with Patton riding into battle clinging onto
the outside of one of the machines.

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:05.450
Later that same month he would be badly injured
in an act of near-suicidal bravery.

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:12.230
World War I tanks were seriously underpowered,
unreliable, and vulnerable without infantry

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:13.230
support.

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:16.620
So when his tanks became isolated during the
Meuse-Argonne Offensive 5, Patton called for

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:19.800
volunteers to help him storm the German lines.

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.050
Only five men stepped forward.

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:25.060
They were quickly cut down by a hail of German
bullets.

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:29.600
Patton himself was badly injured by a piece
of shrapnel which hit him in the thigh.

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:34.410
He continued to direct the battle from a shell
hole, he later refused medical treatment until

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:36.970
he had completed and submitted his report.

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:40.600
Patton’s injuries weren’t life threatening,
but they were serious.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:44.680
By the time he had recovered sufficiently
to return to combat the armistice had been

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:52.850
signed and the guns 
fallen silent.

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:55.950
While Patton’s time at the frontlines had
been brief, he had done more than enough to

00:06:55.950 --> 00:07:01.240
demonstrate that he possessed the kind of
raw courage he expected and demanded of those

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:05.030
who served under him.

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:14.410
Between the Wars
With the Great War at an end Patton returned

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:17.960
to the United States of America where he found
a good deal to keep him busy.

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:22.540
He learned to fly, drove the latest automobiles,
sailed his yacht, mixed with high society,

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:27.410
kept a stable of horses, and won hundreds
of trophies and ribbons in numerous sporting

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:28.410
events.

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:33.540
Such an extravagant lifestyle would ordinarily
be well out of reach on a major’s salary.

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:38.650
However, in 1910 Patton had married Beatrice
Ayer, the extremely wealthy heiress of a Boston

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:39.650
industrialist.

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:42.980
The Pattons had more than enough money to
do almost anything they wanted, but George

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:47.590
had never wavered from his belief that he
was destined to be a great soldier.

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:52.210
He maintained a special interest in armored
warfare, and some visionaries were proclaiming

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:56.730
that tanks would become the decisive weapon
in any future conflict.

00:07:56.730 --> 00:08:01.330
Heinz Guderian in Germany and Charles de Gaulle
in France argued that tanks would return mobility

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:06.400
to the battlefield, punching through enemy
positions to create havoc in the rear.

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.860
Patton was thinking along similar lines, and
he got the chance to test out some of his

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:17.010
ideas in 1941 when the US Army held vast wargames
6 across the states of Louisiana and Carolina.

00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:23.810
More than 400,000 soldiers and 1,000 aircraft
took part in mock battles held over 30,000

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:25.000
square miles.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.490
With Germany once again at war with Britain
and Russia, and no guarantees that America

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:34.590
would be able to remain neutral, it was a
much needed opportunity to test out tactics

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:35.710
and equipment.

00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:39.840
It also served as a test of the men who would
lead America’s armies into battle.

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:44.680
The battles weren’t real, but they were
a close enough approximation for sixty-one

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:46.880
men to lose their lives.

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:51.360
However, despite these losses, the US Army
gained valuable experience, and Patton staked

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:59.910
his claim to be arguably the US Army’s finest
exponent of armored warfare.

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:09.310
Africa
On 7 December 1941 Japan attacked the United

00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:11.770
States of America at Pearl Harbor.

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:14.460
Four days later Germany declared war on America.

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:18.250
And with that World War II became a truly
global war.

00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:23.240
With plans for a 1942 Allied invasion of Western
Europe having been shelved, the Allied High

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:28.140
Command instead chose to strike at Hitler’s
Vichy French allies in North Africa.

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:32.370
Three separate task forces were launched,
with General George Patton taking command

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:37.690
of 35,000 men of the Western Task Force, sailing
for Casablanca from Virginia.

00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:43.540
If Patton had any fears or doubts, he certainly
wasn’t showing them, and he wrote in his

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:45.880
diary:
“When I realize what I am, I am amazed,

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:49.010
but on reflection, who is as good as I am?

00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:51.650
I know of no one 7.”

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:52.650
Modest too…

00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:57.340
The amphibious landings of 8 November were
largely unopposed, and despite some fierce

00:09:57.340 --> 00:10:01.860
resistance as Patton’s men pushed inland,
the Vichy French signed an armistice later

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:02.860
that day.

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:07.650
Far more formidable than the French, however,
was Germany’s Erwin Rommel and his Afrika

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:08.650
Korps.

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:14.360
On 14 February 1943 they attacked in force,
striking at US forces in Tunisia’s Atlas

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:15.360
Mountains.

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:19.650
By the 20th February the immediate crisis
was over, but the Americans had been pushed

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:21.420
back 50 miles.

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:25.870
Huge amounts of equipment had been abandoned,
and 4,000 Americans, including Patton’s

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:28.880
own son-in-law, had been captured by the Germans.

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:32.670
With morale on the floor, Eisenhower sacked
the commander he held responsible and placed

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:36.280
all American troops in Tunisia under Patton’s
command.

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:41.330
Patton immediately subjected his men to an
intensive drill routine and a strict disciplinary

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:42.330
code.

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:47.200
His methods were far from universally popular,
but they got results and within a month Patton

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:51.551
was on the offensive defeating the formidable
German 10th Panzer Division at the Battle

00:10:51.551 --> 00:10:52.930
of El Guettar 8.

00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:57.070
Patton rapidly built a reputation for himself
in North Africa, but it was here that he began

00:10:57.070 --> 00:11:01.930
his rivalry with Bernard Montgomery, the commander
of the British Eighth Army.

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:06.810
While Patton was bold, aggressive, and often
acted on gut instinct, Montgomery was by nature

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:10.960
a far more cautious man who put great stock
in meticulous planning.

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:16.420
Patton believed Eisenhower deferred to Montgomery
far too often, a feeling that was only strengthened

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:20.481
when the British commander was given the go-ahead
to plan the invasion of Sicily...

00:11:20.481 --> 00:11:33.430
Sicily and Scandal
The invasion of Sicily was to be a joint operation

00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:38.930
conducted by the British Eighth Army led by
Montgomery and the Seventh US Army commanded

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:40.590
by George Patton.

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:45.380
Much to Patton’s disgust, Montgomery’s
plan placed the main emphasis on the British

00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:48.980
contingent and cast the Americans in the supporting
role.

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:53.540
“This is what you get,” fumed Patton,
“when your commander-in-chief (Eisenhower)

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:56.350
ceases to be an American and becomes an ally.”

00:11:56.350 --> 00:12:00.160
The invasion force landed on the beaches of
Sicily on 10 July 1943.

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:05.340
By nightfall the Allies had put 80,000 men
and 300 tanks ashore.

00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:10.000
The next day Patton himself came to inspect
the beachhead, wading in through the surf

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.110
even as artillery shells exploded around the
beach.

00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:16.760
While it soon became clear that the Germans
would not be able to hold Sicily, they fought

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:21.840
a fierce rear-guard action as they began to
evacuate their army to the Italian mainland.

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:26.590
As Montgomery’s army became bogged down,
Patton decided to take a loose interpretation

00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:27.590
of his orders.

00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:31.490
He was expected to support the British, but
surely the best way to do so would be to hit

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:32.960
the Germans hard.

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:37.410
Patton drove the Seventh Army on, his goal
now was to beat Montgomery to the city of

00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:39.690
Messina in the north of the island.

00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:45.740
He was driven not just by personal ambition,
but by a desire to prove the American soldier

00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:47.220
was the best in the world...

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:52.770
The Sicily campaign 9 was fought at a blistering
pace in blazing heat; casualties were inevitable…

00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:56.940
On 3 August 1943 Patton visited the wounded
at a field hospital.

00:12:56.940 --> 00:13:01.290
When he discovered that one of the patients
was physically unhurt but suffering from shellshock,

00:13:01.290 --> 00:13:03.350
he exploded with rage.

00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:07.790
Patton slapped the unfortunate man, dragged
him from the tent, kicked him in the backside,

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:09.760
and threatened to shoot him for cowardice.

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:13.550
Unfortunately for Patton, this extraordinary
display had been conducted under the noses

00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:15.020
of a number of journalists.

00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:19.230
Patton didn’t seem to realize he’d done
anything wrong, but striking a subordinate

00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:21.030
was a court martial offence.

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:25.810
Eisenhower ordered Patton to apologise, begged
the witnesses not to report on the incident,

00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:29.820
and hoped that would be enough to protect
his most dangerous weapon in the war against

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:30.820
the Nazis.

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:35.150
While Patton won his race to Messina and threw
the Nazis out of Sicily, his vicious temper

00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:38.480
came back to bite him as word of his assault
leaked out in the press.

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:40.240
There was little more that Eisenhower could
do.

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:48.540
Patton was removed from his command; and with
that it seemed as if his career might be over…

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:57.050
Operation Overlord
The invasion of Italy followed on almost as

00:13:57.050 --> 00:13:59.820
a natural consequence of the conquest of Sicily.

00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:04.320
Patton, who was ill-suited to inactivity,
could only watch on in frustration.

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:09.470
Of even greater importance than the campaign
in Italy was the long-awaited invasion of

00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:10.770
Western Europe.

00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:13.500
This would take place in June of 1944.

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:18.380
It was one of the most difficult operations
of the war, but Patton would have no direct

00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:20.460
role to play in the invasion...

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:24.980
Instead he was used as a decoy, given command
of an entirely fictitious army 10 intended

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:29.270
to fool the Germans into believing that a
second invasion force was preparing to strike.

00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:30.960
The ruse totally worked.

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:34.839
The Germans never imagined that the Allies
would leave their best offensive general back

00:14:34.839 --> 00:14:41.690
in Britain while such a vital offensive was
being fought in France…

00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:50.680
Breakout
Patton’s greatest fear was that the war

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:52.970
would be over before he could get back into
it.

00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:54.400
He needn’t have worried though...

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:59.300
While the success of the initial Allied invasion
exceeded expectations, the British and Americans

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:02.770
made slow progress as they attempted to push
inland.

00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:07.310
It wasn’t until the end of July that the
Americans finally punched a small hole through

00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:08.310
German lines.

00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:13.350
Omar Bradley, commander of the US ground forces,
knew that this was the moment to get Patton

00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:14.779
back in the fray.

00:15:14.779 --> 00:15:19.810
Bradley regarded Patton as difficult to control,
unpredictable, and vulgar, but he recognized

00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:20.850
his talents.

00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:25.660
Patton was given command of the newly formed
Third Army, a highly mobile force equipped

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:26.830
with plenty of armor.

00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:30.460
He was ordered to go and break through the
German lines…

00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:34.220
Patton quickly got to work, squeezed his armored
divisions through the narrowest of gaps in

00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:39.330
the German lines, reformed them on the other
side, and within a matter of days his Third

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:42.560
Army was tearing through open country into
Brittany.

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:46.810
The speed of Patton’s advances often worried
his superiors, since he was a risk taker who

00:15:46.810 --> 00:15:49.850
rarely worried about the danger of an attack
to his flanks.

00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:54.610
Hitler himself thought he had sniffed out
an opportunity to exploit the Allied breakout,

00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:58.720
launch a counterattack, and cut off Patton’s
armored spearheads.

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:03.100
Now this idea did have its merits in theory,
but the German Army lacked the strength to

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:04.820
execute the operation in practice...

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:08.960
It was instead the Germans who found themselves
in danger of being completely encircled at

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:09.960
Falaise 11.

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:13.779
Patton believed he was in a position to slam
the jaws of the trap shut.

00:16:13.779 --> 00:16:18.210
Bradley, a far more cautious commander than
Patton, ordered the Third Army to halt at

00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:19.210
Argentan.

00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:23.360
Patton was furious but complied with the order,
even though he suspected Bradley had been

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:24.790
influenced by Montgomery...

00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:37.640
Race to the Rhine and the Battle of the Bulge
Hitler’s failed counterattack led to the

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:40.210
near collapse of the German Army in France.

00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:43.700
With that, Patton was free to launch his blitzkrieg
assault.

00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:49.300
His philosophy was relentless attack and unrelenting
pressure that kept the enemy constantly off

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:52.360
balance and minimized the Third Army’s casualties.

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:56.030
Patton argued that if he was properly backed
he could be across the River Rhine in a matter

00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:57.030
of weeks.

00:16:57.030 --> 00:17:02.000
But he once again found himself in competition
with Montgomery as each man attempted to secure

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.750
enough supplies to keep their army moving.

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:09.600
As Patton complained, “My men can eat their
belts, but my tanks have gotta have gas.”

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:13.990
Although there were still disagreements amongst
the leading Allied generals, they were united

00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:16.930
in the belief that Hitler’s armies were
all but beaten.

00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:20.829
Germany’s Fuhrer, however, had one last
surprise in store.

00:17:20.829 --> 00:17:26.760
On 16 December 1944 the Germans launched a
vast counterattack aimed at a thinly held

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:29.330
section of the American lines at the Ardennes.

00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:34.500
This was the beginning of the battle that
would become famous as the Battle of the Bulge.

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:39.110
The sudden, furious assault badly rattled
most Allied commanders, but Patton recognized

00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:42.150
at once that Hitler had made a serious strategic
error.

00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:46.430
“Let the sons of bitches go all the way
to Paris if they like,” he joked, “then

00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:48.600
we can really cut them off and chew them up.”

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:52.250
Eisenhower summoned his senior commanders
to an emergency conference, where he asked

00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:56.630
how long it would take Patton to divert his
Third Army to the Ardennes.

00:17:56.630 --> 00:18:00.370
Patton told him he could have three divisions
there within 48 hours.

00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:05.090
This seemingly fantastical claim was met with
a mixture of laughter and disbelieving stares,

00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:07.460
but Patton was entirely serious.

00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:11.930
He’d anticipated Eisenhower’s request
and his staff were already making preparations

00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:17.620
to disengage the part of the Third Army, wheel
it around, and race to the rescue 12 along

00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:18.710
narrow icy roads.

00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:23.360
The Battle of the Bulge gave the Allied High
Command a shock, but as Patton had predicted

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:27.030
it accomplished nothing and cost Hitler his
last reserves.

00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:31.630
Now the River Rhine was the last significant
obstacle the Western Allies had to tackle.

00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:36.150
The main crossing was to be launched by Montgomery,
and he spent two months planning every last

00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:41.270
detail of the operation, which called for
an airborne assault, a huge artillery bombardment,

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:44.660
and even the assistance of specialized US
Navy vessels.

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:49.020
Montgomery’s crossing was launched on 23rd
March, by which time Patton had already stolen

00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:53.930
his thunder by quietly sneaking a division
across under cover of darkness and establishing

00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:55.540
a bridgehead on the other side.

00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:59.760
He phoned Bradley to let him know what he’d
done: “But don’t tell anyone because the

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:06.270
krauts haven’t realized yet.”

00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:14.340
Controversial in Life and Death
With the defeat of Germany, Patton tried and

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:19.520
failed to secure a posting to the Far East
to play a part in the war against Japan.

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:24.050
Instead he was appointed as Governor of Bavaria,
a political post to which he was not well

00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:25.050
suited.

00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:28.670
He fell out with the Russians, refused to
remove Nazi personnel from key administrative

00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:32.860
positions on the basis that there was nobody
else qualified to do the job, and got tricked

00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:38.420
by a reporter into agreeing Nazis joined their
party in more-or-less the same way as Americans

00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:40.340
became Democrats or Republicans.

00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:44.880
Patton’s military abilities were not matched
by his political instincts, and he had once

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:47.410
again succeeded in outraging the press.

00:19:47.410 --> 00:19:51.490
His subsequent apology was deemed insufficient
and he was removed from his post for the second

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:52.490
time.

00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:56.900
But at this point, although he didn’t know
it, he only had a few months left to live…

00:19:56.900 --> 00:20:02.300
On 9 December 1945 Patton was being driven
towards a hunting expedition when the vehicle

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:06.140
he was travelling in was struck by a truck
travelling in the opposite direction.

00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:09.740
Nobody else was hurt, but Patton was paralyzed
from the neck down.

00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:13.420
The injured general was rushed to hospital
where he died eleven days later.

00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:17.970
He was buried in Europe alongside the fallen
soldiers of his beloved Third Army.

00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:22.150
Patton had always wanted to die in battle,
instead he’d lost his life as a result of

00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:28.179
a low speed collision in peacetime.

00:20:28.179 --> 00:20:33.300
Not everybody accepts the official version
of Patton’s demise.

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:38.200
It has been suggested that Patton may have
been assassinated 13 by the Russians, possibly

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:43.010
even in collusion with the US Government,
as a result of his outspoken opposition to

00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:44.120
the Soviet Union.

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:58.920
He was 60 years old.
