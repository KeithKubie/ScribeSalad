Speaker 1:          00:00          Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad, I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab, our topic today, choice and human destinies. Yeah. With the way we are is that the way we're going to stay are very nicely put in the last section we were talking about baboons and their propensity to serious change, which is a maybe or maybe not. We don't really know. Yeah. We'll known a thousand years. Well let's switch our ape. We'll go to Oregonians or just a rare subset of human beings to set it up. We were thinking a lot about um, small groups on this show. You know, cause that's what we are. We are a small group primates. That's the phrase that sometimes you use to describe as humans and it's a phrase that can carry some negative connotations. As in we evolved in these small groups that we are predisposed to be small minded. No small is not always a bad thing.

Speaker 1:          00:48          I'm gonna tell you a story now that's a small group story. It's a, just as a warning contains a moment or two that's a tiny bit graphic, but we hope you'll stick with it because it's a really cool story. Takes place in a small town, like really small, the kind of town where you can dial the wrong number and still have a conversation cause you know everybody. So tell me where we are and, and uh, downtown Silverton. Essentially our downtown has not changed since the late forties, early fifties. Oh yes it has. But we'll get to that. This is Stu Rasmussen. He is our main character. And a little while back stu gave myself and producer Aaron Scott a tour, the theater on the corner of the old hardware store on this corner, this tour of his favorite place on earth. Silverton, Oregon roots is about 40 miles from Portland.

Speaker 1:          01:36          It's about 40 years from Portland actually, you know, it's the town I grew up in and this is my image for what I want silver to be. You know, I rode my bicycle down the street and came to the hardware store to get going. We're doing good. Vince, is that happened to you? A lot of people just honk and wave all the time. Oh yeah. It's a small town. Everybody knows, man, if it were up to to this town would never change. It would stay frozen in that quaint Norman Rockwell candy coated image from his boyhood. The weird thing though is that that image in his head would probably be [inaudible] never have included a guy like stu, at least do as he is now and if this is a show about change, here is a story money pretty radical, but it changed where you wouldn't expect to find.

Speaker 1:          02:19          Speaking of which, can you describe where we are and what we're looking at while we're standing in front of the palace theater on the corner of Oak and water street, this is one of those gun with the wind theaters with the big marquee and the bulb lights and everything built in 1935 and then continuous operation ever since steeples out some keys and opens it up, but starting to get really cold. He suggested that we do the interview here in the towns only theater. Even smells like a gilded age theater, which at 1:00 PM still smelled like popcorn from the previous night and was filled with nothing but 200 empty red velvet seats. Not what you expected in a small town theater. Oh, this is beautiful. Yeah. Okay. See you later. Okay, thank you. You've left ourselves. Sit right here. What do you think? [inaudible] seats in the house right in the middle. Sit and pretend we're watching the movie of your life while there is a dull movement. Hardly. So the movie of Stu begins in 1975 he's 27 and he's in a theater just like the Seminole moment in my life was when the rocky horror picture showcase

Speaker 2:          03:21          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          03:24          stu is in the projectionist booth cause that's his job. He's changing the rails and at some point during one of the musical members, he glances at the screen and it was like, oh, what was the, what was the, Oh here was this movie with a guy drag on screwed justice. Triam is the best guy who is the sweet trends fest. State suction friends, sexual Transylvania. Those are words that I've never heard.

Speaker 2:          03:54          Watch that again and again.

Speaker 1:          03:58          Fast forward 10 years. Do you now owns the theater? Just like his dad had beforehand. He's an upstanding member of the town. He's on the Silverton city council. Then on the library board, and then he starts to transform and everyone will tell you it began with the nails. I think I probably started having my nails done in 94 95 and it started out with very masculine nails without Polish and square ends and then slowly grew them out. And then I went into what I considered a masculine nail color of blue. And then he says he gradually started to paint them red and then he put acrylic tips, which got longer and longer. This was the first test. Did the community, Hello Laurie? Who Do you mean sir? How are you? I could be at the theater taking tickets, be dressed as usual and his plaid shirt and jeans, his hand would come out for their tickets.

Speaker 1:          04:46          And what is the healer? Oh are those, you can't miss it. And you know he had a long fingernail. Hello, that's Dennis Bean. Long Time Silver Tonia. One time when I had to give him my ticket and Megan to salvo, she's 17. And he rips it and like his nails like went down the palm of my hand and just gave me the chills. Yeah. For I think probably his nails were the first thing most people notice. Cal Palmer veterinarian and city councilman born and raised here and SilverTech was their talk was oh, people sitting, oh, definitely talk. But it happens so gradually, which is something you hear again and again. It happened gradually, you know, first it was the nails and, and then, uh, at some point in time he changed the focus of the movie theater and was really making a game attempt to get new releases and down in the theater. And frequently, you know, when there was a theme kind of movie, he would get into costume. My name is Ken Hector, former mayor of short in Oregon. And very often the costume would be female attire. This is step two of Steve's very careful transition according to everyone we spoke with for years after the nails. He would quote, promote that week's movie by dressing up or one of the new star wars movies was out and it a coincidence he

Speaker 3:          05:58          was dressed as queen on the dollar. I love you. Whatever name is from the movie. Years ago you remember, uh, some years ago there was a movie called my big Fat Greek wedding. That's John Bach, also a lifelong silver Tony. And that whole day he wandered around town in a wedding dress. The complete with the veil. That of course got everybody talking. You know, a lot of people laughed about it. I don't think people put it together with um, this is the, the web.

Speaker 1:          06:26          She's a registered nurse, sexuality, transgender or any of those things. I think we thought he was just dressing up to go along with this. Uh, yeah, with his movies. There was clearly a, let's go by the movie theater tonight cause we've got to know what Stew's wearing for stu. This was just the beginning of something. He was, he wasn't just clowning around. When did your gender complexities begin? In probably 14 or 15. I think I was a shy young man and interfacing with girls. My mother was a bit strange on on that in the girls who are evil and they would, no girl was good enough for her son and Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah Dah. So did you date at all? Not until I was out of high school. So girls were kind of scary. It sounds like girls were scary. Yeah, well everybody else went on dates.

Speaker 1:          07:11          He says he would build computers from scratch and even today in his basement you'll find an entire electrical shop like God, fun stuff, RF generators, spectrum analyzer, logic analyzer or the logic, analyze it. In any case do says the best that he can explain himself gender wise. It's just to say that when he looks in the mirror, he likes himself better when he's dressed as a woman. I don't know how to describe it. It's just, um, I can't understand it. I mean, some people like to dress up and look like a cowboy or a lumberjack, whatever, you know, it's your mental image of yourself that you look in the mirror and you like. So after the nails, after dozens of episodes of socially acceptable cross-dressing, Stu took the next step. He began to perform some experiments, like he would go to the lumber yard just to get some stuff, a couple of pounds in nails or something. All the while he would be wearing a padded bra. There is flannel shirt just to see what would happen. So this for you, it was like a test. It was like a calculated test to absolutely age. If it was possible, if I could survive with breasts. Okay.

Speaker 1:          08:22          So when he was 52 he drove into Portland, visited a doctor, put him to sleep and the doctors made two small incisions, one under each breast, about an inch and a half or two inches long. And they pulled back the skin on each side, slid in an uninflated balloon and then pumped it up with water until the skin was stretched to the point that it was almost transparent. Hmm. That sounds very painful. Was it? Well, I was asleep at the time, but when he woke up he was a different man because he now had several pounds of new stuff hanging off his chest. What were you thinking at that moment? I was thinking what I done, it was like, there's no going back. I can remember being in a Max place downtown at a table and uh, he was coming across the street with his breasts prominently showing, and it was the first time any of us realized that he had actually had surgery and one lady was going, Oh look, look.

Speaker 1:          09:15          And the other lady was going to look across the street and Oh my God, look, it's too, my God, what is he doing? It just sort of shocking. There was a buzz around town. This is a situation where he'd walked by and then heads would turn, hushed voices would ensue. Yes. Basically, this is Victoria sage Stew's longtime girlfriend. They've been together for 36 years. So we would be walking in our local goodwill and we'd be a few miles away from each other. And I would hear that used to be [inaudible] Rasmussen, like he had changed somehow [inaudible] trying to fulfill that body image. He's gotten his head but he's also going to in way asked you to adjust to your body image of your mate. Has that been difficult? Hmm. No. Okay. No, I'm sorry. If you, if want to get kinky about it, a man would is kind of cool,

Speaker 4:          10:15          Huh?

Speaker 1:          10:16          Okay. Did, uh, was there ever any concern there was for me? Um, not so much for Stu. I think partly because he didn't hear as many whispers as I felt I did, but I was concerned for the theater business. Not without reason. A lot of kids in the town stop coming to the theater cause their parents wouldn't let them. Ticket sales took a hit and it wasn't long before pickup trucks full of teenage boys would drive by the theater yelling slurs. Oh I don't know that I go so far as well. Yeah, I guess I guess

Speaker 4:          10:49          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          10:50          in fact it is a slur I guess. And so you get to this point in the sped up movie narrative of Stu. This point right here where even though he took it so slowly and was so careful, it's still easy to imagine things turning ugly. I don't know. What was that movie about? The boy that was a, you know, drug and beat to death because he was gay in a small town in the Midwest. You know what a waste of your shepard. Yeah. Might be a little extreme. But according to Linda Web Silverton's not so different from Laramie, Wyoming. We are Matthew Shepard lift. It's a small town, very traditional, very conservative. You know, you got a lot of rednecks in silver and so Dennis beam puts it so it's not crazy to expect the worst. But here's the surprise.

Speaker 4:          11:33          [inaudible] call. Right. And the whole reason we came here to Silverado my page, January 5th, 2009 the worst did not happen. [inaudible] there was no redneck rebellion. In fact, the opposite happened right the right hand. Something historic it after me. Hi. Hi. On January 5th thousand and nine the town

Speaker 1:          11:54          of Silverton elected stu mayor.

Speaker 2:          11:57          How did the city of Silverton Marion County for congratulate has elected the nation's first openly transgender mayor nation's first openly transgender mayor. This is a real turn off here. This election take, do revenues slide as openly transgendered as he runs his hometown in heels.

Speaker 1:          12:26          Speaking of heels, this is in fact the sound of stews. Four inch heels pounding on linoleum as he goes to a city council meeting. Hello Harold. Couldn't be better. How are you? Good. Yeah, no. Call Us, you know, city elitist or whatever. But a mayor in a plunging v-neck sweater and a black miniskirt. Not what you would expect. Any tiny conservative Republican town. So we wanted to know, you know, why did this happen here? Wow. So producer Aaron Scott and I walked around town for a couple of days and we interviewed dozens of people, including gentleman, guy named Ken Hector, who stu beat out for mayor. He's a conservative Republican. Definitely not one of Steve's big fans. It was just a difference in philosophy about, I don't want to sound pretentious, but you know, as a mayor, I think there's certain expectations about professionalism that you should exhibit. He would come in with a tight clinging top with cleavage down to here that you're almost pointing at your belly button there a little bit higher.

Speaker 1:          13:23          Come on. You know when you're at the council meeting, show some dignity here and just dress in the appropriate attire for the occasion. Can't even try to get the city council to impose a dress code on Stu. But when we asked them, you know, are you surprised that the town has embraced stu and even gone so far as to elect a mayor? He said, uh, no, not in this case. You know, is a rarity in that. You know, there's a lot of people in this town who are extremely religious, very conservative people were at a stranger who came into town suddenly, I'm sure that the support and perception might've been different. But you're talking about a native son who grew up here and he said, still runs the only theater in town. So he's out there every weekend standing out in front of the palace or taking tickets. Everybody knows him. Not only that anymore, back in the day he used to be the cable guys. So he's literally been in everybody's homes. He's still the guy you call if you have trouble with your computer. So it might sound strange to you, but it's really not. And that is when it hit me actually under the right circumstances. A small town can be like the most progressive place on earth.

Speaker 5:          14:33          Oh. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          14:37          and it's exactly because everyone's all up in your grill. You were forced to know people. Like for instance, how long have you known sue? Oh my goodness. I grew up with Stu. I mean we, um, I read, everyone's do is like an alter boy. The church is my brother. This is Suzy. Seamless retired t-shirts. Yeah, his parents and my parents were friends. Like a lot of folks in Silverton, she has known stu for so long and, and in so many different contexts that you can't do that New York thing with him. Where are you? Like you see someone on the sidewalk and you size them up instantly and think freak no to her. He's way too complicated for that, you know, to her he's do the alter boys do the computer games? Yeah, I probably would call McGee to do the city council man is do the mayor or he's just do just do, just, just do whatever.

Speaker 1:          15:25          That's him. You know, go on about your business. You have to be clear. A lot of the people we talk to these facts, some of the same folks who said yes dues just to, are still not happy about the situation. No. I mean, I don't think that's across dresser. They either felt it was morally wrong. As in the case of this minister Tom Smith and Genesis one 27 says, so God created man in his own image. In the more, some folks like Linda Webb's husband John just felt like he takes it way too far. It's right there. It's in your face. He dresses Kinda like a streetwalker. You feel that that's confrontational? I do, but most of the people who had objections, it was a little more nuanced and it went something like [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          16:05          Yes. Well, I, my personally did not vote for him for mayor because I didn't feel it was a good idea to have someone that looked like that representing us. But on the other hand, he is a good man and he's got this town at heart. In other words, according to John Bach, the problem really isn't stu or the town or the way he gets the outside. All those people out there who are going to hear about stu

Speaker 1:          16:28          and then judge them, which is what makes November 25th, 2008 such an interesting day. Steve had just been elected mayor, he'd squeaked it out by about 400 votes but he hadn't yet been sworn in when a group of Christian extremists from Kansas showed up in town and started marching up and down main street yelling at people and at one point they even unfurled and American flag put it on the ground and stepped on it just to show how offensive

Speaker 4:          16:57          they found students. It's our duty to not here and preach to everyone. Man is disgusting. These folks hate stu cause they will not by any means warn him about to send this, taking him to hell closet and then bringing up signs and key things like a god hates overtake. God hates your mayor. God hates fags. Your pastor, it's an abomination for a man put on a woman's clothes and to be the opposite sex. If he folks from the town decided it's to start a counter protest, we stood across the street from these people by and large, just a few guys. At first, no earlier, someone had suggest all the guys ought to dress up as girls and all the girls. I did dress up these guys. Jase Davidson said, isn't this a reaction? Was here, right there? He was in a dress every time. You Bet. Impressed. [inaudible] but that really actually was the first time he says it. At first, he and the two or three other guys who had on women's clothing,

Speaker 2:          17:57          it felt a little weird, but then people just started coming. It was just amazing. Of a couple of hundred people. I mean men dressed like women, women dressed like men. Some of the people that I sat down there were surprising because I had labeled them in my head as conservative and people drive by people signs God loves. So to God's love, Stu costumes, the town was really alive when the crowd just kept getting bigger and bigger. Who were you? What were you thinking at that moment? From what I understand, you were standing off to the side just watching what was going through your mind. Yeah, well honestly I tried to discourage people from even giving them the time of day saying, don't give them any attention. I couldn't get that to happen. They were so angry and they came out 200 people, men in dresses, grandmothers, babies. That's, it's just amazing that that was the town. That wasn't me. Sorry, I get a little emotional.

Speaker 1:          19:23          That must've been a turning point for you.

Speaker 2:          19:27          The biggest one? Yeah. [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          19:36          perhaps to Aaron Scott who did a huge chunk of the reporting for that piece in co-produced it with me. We'll be right back.

Speaker 1:          19:44          Okay. So that story with, we did that about six, maybe seven years ago and it just feels like the world is different now. Like with regards to transgender issues, even the language we use, I mean has changed it. Back then we said transgendered and now we would just say transgender, but with Caitlyn Jenner in the news and all this stuff, we just thought wondered like how things changed for stew in these last six, seven years.

Speaker 2:          20:12          So hello all the time on time

Speaker 1:          20:18          we decided to send producer, reporter Aaron Scott back to Silverton, sit down with stu and with students, partner Victoria, the headset just to catch up.

Speaker 4:          20:27          I mean it's been seven years since our, we'll be going on seven years, six years since we ran the story the first time. What has been going on in your world?

Speaker 2:          20:37          Well, since the election that's been about it. So

Speaker 1:          20:40          the first thing you told me was that he got reelected after two years and then he was reelected again. And then after years is mayor, he's,

Speaker 6:          20:48          he's no out of the game.

Speaker 7:          20:49          Hallelujah. I am truly enjoying my vacation.

Speaker 6:          20:54          And he did tell me that back when the story first aired, things did get kind of nutty.

Speaker 8:          20:59          Well, you know, it's probably the most unusual phone call we've ever received. Worst Victoria and I were sitting at home, the phone rang and it was as a fellow from New York City who said, I was bicycling on Manhattan listening to the original radio lab piece, and you thought it would be really fun to do my life story as a musical. I don't know what I feel, but I know it's a big deal. Then they reveal

Speaker 6:          21:24          and he did. That fellow is Andrew Russell. He put on a big production up in Seattle. It got standing ovation.

Speaker 8:          21:30          It's the most surreal and bizarre experience in my life. Sitting in an auditorium with 400 strangers watching as in song and dance. My life goes by.

Speaker 9:          21:40          He can call me, she and she can call me. He and he can call me. She and she can call me. He and he can call me. He and she can call me. She when you

Speaker 6:          21:53          refer to me by Jan. So there was this musical which seemed to do pretty well. And then a movie producer called him up and said that he, he wanted to option Stew's life for a movie and now Victoria says those whispers that they used to get those have turned into people wanting autographs or stopping them in the shoe store and saying, aren't you stew? Aren't you that bear? Can I get a picture with you? Sure, there's Israeli, no, what's the big deal? God Woo. But one of the most interesting things for me was that a lot of that attention was at the beginning these days to says that, you know, his transgender issues have grown in, in the national news and on TV shows. Stu says that back in Silverton, the fact that he's transgender, it's become pretty much passe.

Speaker 8:          22:42          So here we are,

Speaker 10:         22:46          Woo.

Speaker 6:          22:46          He says it's just kind of routine now for him and everyone else, except he did say there's this one thing every time the story airs or re, which it does from time to time

Speaker 7:          22:58          when it, when it goes, the phone starts ringing and we can tell where it's from.

Speaker 6:          23:02          He says he gets these calls from people who are struggling with their own gender issues or trying to figure out how to come out to their families and people actually call your home phone.

Speaker 7:          23:11          Yeah. Usually anonymously. They won't identify themselves necessarily because they're still either closeted or not really ready to come out, but they're saying, thank you so much for being yourself and for telling your story to others so that I can, you know, I can validate my life from that. Thank you. Does that ever get old? Hm. No. Um, for somebody who was in the position that I was in, made the change and then to have other people either following along or, you know, emulating it in one way or another, it's very gratifying because it validates life and it says why you weren't a complete waste of time. A lot more than a lot of people get. Yeah.

Speaker 11:         24:21          [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          24:21          special thanks to producer Annie Mcewen for helping us on all the tough day parts of this year.
