00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.060
This cow has an illusion face.
See the people about to kiss?

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:06.910
And oh my gosh, what's this?
Nice.

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.570
It's episode 44 of IMG!

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.740
If you eat too many Pringles you'll feel like

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.710
this.
And if you look like this, your kids will

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.890
too.
Now, if you look at this right in the middle

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.529
and move your head towards and away, the stars
will appear to rotate.

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:29.320
And speaking of rings of things, these are
4 perfectly round circles.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.079
Give yourself a new face in the sand or, if
you're lucky, find a sweeter face in some

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.290
ice cream.
Now if this one dot represents all the fire

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:45.360
power used by all sides during World War II,
one Poseidon submarine contains the raw explosive

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.149
fire power of 3 world wars.
Oh and the rest of these dots?

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:55.780
They represent the total fire power of all
man made nuclear weapons currently on Earth.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.949
Vertical comic time.
Okay, alright, cool.

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:00.690
Zoom in.
Yep, that's what I thought.

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.290
Now, let's be serious.
Animated GIFs.

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.630
Of course, when the format was first created
its developers pronounced it "jif," which

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.630
is reflected in their parody phrase "Choosy
developers choose .g[j]if."

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.890
But the Oxford English Dictionary says that
both "gif" and "jif" are correct.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.930
The music playing right now, by the way, was
designed by sound therapists.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:29.020
It's called weightless and it was constructed
to biologically be the most relaxing noise

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.090
possible.
It causes your brain waves and your heart

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.880
rate to synchronise.
According to the researchers, the next most

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:45.880
relaxing songs ever made in order are these.
And now a company that makes custom-stuffed

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.880
animals based on your children's drawings.
Enjoy.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.760
Ah, come on, cheer up.
Here's a cleaning cart with a big grin.

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.430
Which these girls don't have.
I mean, come on, he'd rather touch a koala

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.080
butt.
Let's get infographic-y.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.650
This interactive site shows when Mosaic started,
what all of its versions looked like and moves

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:21.200
through Netscape to Opera, IE, and beyond.
And this flowchart lets you choose the perfect

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.060
book off of NPR's list of the top 100 sci-fi
and fantasy books.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.040
Finally, here's a great infographic about
our solar system that shows distances from

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.450
the Sun to scale.
We've got the Earth, Saturn, all the way out

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:42.250
to dwarf planet Pluto and beyond.
Hey Vsauce! Michael Here!

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.080
That's right.
You just witnessed our first tweet ever.

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.540
You can find it @tweetsauce.
The first 1,000 people to follow us will be

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.599
the ones I truly love.
This will be a place where we put cool mind-blowing

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:01.659
stuff that doesn't make it to the videos.
So check it out...

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:02.419
And as always,

00:03:02.419 --> 00:03:03.799
thanks for watching.
