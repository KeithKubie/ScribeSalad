you see gaps in logic when you say
 

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:28.720 align:start position:0%
you see gaps in logic when you say
something<00:16:25.250><c> out</c><00:16:25.519><c> loud</c><00:16:25.550><c> that</c><00:16:26.089><c> before</c><00:16:26.889><c> you</c><00:16:27.889><c> you</c>

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:28.730 align:start position:0%
something out loud that before you you

something out loud that before you you

00:16:30.759 --> 00:16:30.769 align:start position:0%
never really voiced and so one of the
 

00:16:30.769 --> 00:16:33.280 align:start position:0%
never really voiced and so one of the

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:33.290 align:start position:0%
ways that can do that is if you think
 

00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:35.230 align:start position:0%
ways that can do that is if you think
that<00:16:33.470><c> you</c><00:16:33.589><c> know</c><00:16:33.860><c> what</c><00:16:34.069><c> you're</c><00:16:34.250><c> doing</c><00:16:34.639><c> actually</c>

someone else and explain it
 

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:41.199 align:start position:0%
someone else and explain it
yeah<00:16:39.740><c> out</c><00:16:40.009><c> loud</c><00:16:40.279><c> or</c><00:16:40.550><c> you</c><00:16:40.639><c> can</c><00:16:40.790><c> even</c><00:16:40.910><c> write</c><00:16:41.089><c> it</c>

00:16:41.199 --> 00:16:41.209 align:start position:0%
yeah out loud or you can even write it
 

00:16:41.209 --> 00:16:43.679 align:start position:0%
yeah out loud or you can even write it
out<00:16:41.480><c> so</c><00:16:41.779><c> writing</c><00:16:42.199><c> is</c><00:16:42.500><c> it</c><00:16:42.740><c> is</c><00:16:42.889><c> a</c><00:16:42.920><c> good</c><00:16:43.160><c> exercise</c>

out so writing is it is a good exercise
to<00:16:44.689><c> what</c><00:16:44.810><c> you</c><00:16:44.930><c> can</c><00:16:45.050><c> say</c><00:16:45.259><c> hey</c><00:16:45.560><c> did</c><00:16:45.740><c> I</c><00:16:45.829><c> really</c>

00:16:46.179 --> 00:16:46.189 align:start position:0%

to what you can say hey did I really
understand<00:16:46.699><c> this</c><00:16:46.910><c> because</c><00:16:47.509><c> writing</c><00:16:48.439><c> shows</c>

00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:48.740 align:start position:0%

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:52.790 align:start position:0%
