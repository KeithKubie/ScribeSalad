00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.640
 
I'm sure there's a lot of materials out

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:07.650
I'm sure there's a lot of materials out
 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:11.180
I'm sure there's a lot of materials out
there smart materials materials that at

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190
there smart materials materials that at
 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.880
there smart materials materials that at
the nano level are being developed in

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:13.890
the nano level are being developed in
 

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:17.839

fact these come to the to the discipline

fact these come to the to the discipline
 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:21.499

quite late so I'm probably not the right

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:21.509
quite late so I'm probably not the right
 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:24.710
quite late so I'm probably not the right
person to ask that question but one of

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720
person to ask that question but one of
 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.710
person to ask that question but one of
the reasons that I went to MIT was in as

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720
the reasons that I went to MIT was in as
 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.499
the reasons that I went to MIT was in as
a way of being able to collaborate with

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:30.509
a way of being able to collaborate with
 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:32.889
a way of being able to collaborate with
material scientists and begin to imagine

00:00:32.889 --> 00:00:32.899
material scientists and begin to imagine
 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:35.960
material scientists and begin to imagine
ways in which some of their work and our

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:35.970
ways in which some of their work and our
 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.439
ways in which some of their work and our
work can become relevant to each other

00:00:38.439 --> 00:00:38.449
work can become relevant to each other
 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:41.209
work can become relevant to each other
but at another level I think it has not

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219
but at another level I think it has not
 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.619
but at another level I think it has not
to do so much with a material that's

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629
to do so much with a material that's
 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.840
to do so much with a material that's
going to revolutionize all of the

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850
going to revolutionize all of the
 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.099

that and certainly the role of

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960
that and certainly the role of
 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.189
that and certainly the role of
composites has had a vast impact on the

composites has had a vast impact on the
 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.759
composites has had a vast impact on the
way that we think about skins structural

00:00:58.759 --> 00:00:58.769
way that we think about skins structural
 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:02.720
way that we think about skins structural
skins the strength of skins and the way

that the boat building enterprise

airplane building has had an impact on

airplane building has had an impact on
 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.520
airplane building has had an impact on
the way that we've in fact built

materials and furniture and skins in our
own firm has had the kind of

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330
own firm has had the kind of
 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.300
own firm has had the kind of
consequences that you're asking but I

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310
consequences that you're asking but I
 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.890
consequences that you're asking but I
think of them as very small steps

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900
think of them as very small steps
 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.870
think of them as very small steps
actually and and i think that there's a

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880
actually and and i think that there's a
 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.700
actually and and i think that there's a
there's a huge leap forward that we

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710
there's a huge leap forward that we
 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.649
there's a huge leap forward that we
still await

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659
 
 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:34.870
 
that was possible let's say until

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880
that was possible let's say until
 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:41.940
that was possible let's say until
several decades ago where education and

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950
several decades ago where education and
 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.730
several decades ago where education and
the advent of specialization had not

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740
the advent of specialization had not
 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:52.209
the advent of specialization had not
been so in a way stratified to the

been so in a way stratified to the
 

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:57.370
been so in a way stratified to the
degree that now knowledge has been put

degree that now knowledge has been put

on a rocket booster if you like the idea

00:01:59.589 --> 00:01:59.599
on a rocket booster if you like the idea

that different disciplines are occupying

that different disciplines are occupying
 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:06.850
that different disciplines are occupying
their own very distinct set of research

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860
their own very distinct set of research

more and more difficult to create great

more and more difficult to create great

generalists so part of our challenge I

generalists so part of our challenge I

think right now is how not to lose sight

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819
think right now is how not to lose sight

of those very disciplinary traits that

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470
of those very disciplinary traits that
 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.710
of those very disciplinary traits that
characterize the core of your field on

the one hand while remaining agile and
able to engage the other disciplines in

able to engage the other disciplines in

able to engage the other disciplines in
such a way that you can give

such a way that you can give

such a way that you can give
architectural substance to their

knowledge the problem with these other
 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:52.000
knowledge the problem with these other
discipline groups is that they're

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010
discipline groups is that they're
 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.610
discipline groups is that they're
brilliant in what they do but they don't

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620
brilliant in what they do but they don't
 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.860

necessarily understand their
architectural potential nor do they

architectural potential nor do they
understand their ability to synthesize

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280
understand their ability to synthesize

and only the architect is trained to
 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.440
and only the architect is trained to

think in a way to take incompatible
 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.750
think in a way to take incompatible
elements and put them together into some

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760
elements and put them together into some
 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.270
elements and put them together into some
kind of synthesis whether it's a

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280
kind of synthesis whether it's a
 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.120
kind of synthesis whether it's a
difficult synthesis or a happy one is a

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130
difficult synthesis or a happy one is a
 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.220
difficult synthesis or a happy one is a
different question but the idea that the

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230
different question but the idea that the
 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.319
different question but the idea that the
architect is at a thinker and a great

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:23.329
architect is at a thinker and a great
 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:29.020
architect is at a thinker and a great
improviser somebody who is able to pick

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030
improviser somebody who is able to pick
 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.539
improviser somebody who is able to pick
up the pieces and that's sort of what I

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549
up the pieces and that's sort of what I
 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:34.629
up the pieces and that's sort of what I
see is the next big challenge
