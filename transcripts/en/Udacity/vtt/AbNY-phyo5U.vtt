00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.040
So let's start with the dependency example. A dependency,

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.720
as we said, expresses the relationship between a supplier

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.290
and a client that relies on it. There is

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.490
a dependency because changes in the supplier can affect the

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:14.770
client. Here in this example I am showing that

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:18.510
a dependency example involving the registration manager and the

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.590
scheduling algorithm. As you can see the, the dependency

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.710
is indicated with a dashed line pointing from the client

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.520
to the supplier. And here it's pretty clear why

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.820
the RegistrationManager is dependent on the Scheduling Algorithm. It's

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.710
because the RegistrationManager uses this Scheduling Algorithm. And therefore,

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.130
if the Scheduling Algorithm changes, the RegistrationManager might be

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.210
affected by that change. Another less obvious example is

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.600
the dependency between the Registration Manager and the Student.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.040
In this case, because the Registration Manager gets a

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.620
Student object as a parameter here there is a dependency

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.740
between the two. Again, if the Student class were to change the Registration

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:00.270
Manager might be affected because it's relying on the Student for it's behavior.
