00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:02.940
Let's review what happened in
the last video because, in

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.310
general, it's just kind of
confusing and it's always good

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:06.730
to see it a second time.

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:10.500
And then we can think a little
bit about how these market

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.230
dynamics could be manipulated
so that you don't have the

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.910
Chinese currency getting
more expensive.

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.370
So the last video, we started
off with an exchange rate of

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.900
CNY 10 per dollar.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.300
We saw that this manufacturer
over here in China had to sell

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.460
his goods for the equivalent of
CNY 10 in order for him to

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.220
make a profit and that this guy
in United States had to

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.160
sell his goods abroad-- or we'll
say in China-- for the

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.400
equivalent of $1.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:44.280
Now it's this exchange rate,
this price was $1 and at this

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.210
exchange rate, this guy had to
sell his cola for CNY 10 so

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.770
that he could get his dollar.

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.820
So we kind of just
drew it out.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.310
And we said at that price, so
for CNY 10 which was $1, at $1

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.620
there was demand for 100 dolls
in the United States.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:03.780
So we saw this dynamic,.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.770
He would ship 100 dolls to the
United States and then the

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.000
United States would ship
him back $100.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.860
He would sell those dolls for
essentially $1 each, he would

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.360
get back $100.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.700
On the other side of the
equation, the cola

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.680
manufacturer, if he were to sell
it for CNY 10 in China,

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.840
there's demand for
50 cans of soda.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.540
So he would send 50 cans of soda
to China and they would

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.280
send them CNY 10 for
each can, CNY 500.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.070
Now, what happened in that
situation is that the Chinese

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.930
manufacturer had CNY 1,000 that
he needs to convert into

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.260
dollars, into $100 preferably,
if that

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:45.920
exchange rate were fixed.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.280
The American manufacturer, and
let's say that these are the

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:54.165
only two actors in our scenario,
has CNY 500 that he

00:01:54.165 --> 00:01:55.060
needs to convert into $50.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.870
So if we just look over here,
here's someone who wants to

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.650
convert CNY 1,000.

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.270
Or he wants to convert
into CNY 1,000,

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.280
let me be very careful.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:11.460
He wants to convert his $100
into CNY 1,000 if the currency

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.010
were to be held constant.

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.660
But there's only CNY 500 being
offered in the market.

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.770
So he was going to have to offer
more dollars per Yuan

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.010
then he would if there was
more Yuan in the market.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.730
Now you can look at it
from the other side.

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.810
This American manufacturer
has CNY 500 from

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.850
his sales in China.

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.360
He wants to convert it if the
currency was pegged into $50,

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.770
but maybe he could do better
than $50 here.

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.440
And as we can see, there's more
demand to convert the

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.610
Yuan than there is to
convert the dollars.

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.320
He wants to buy $50
using Yuan.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:56.790
This guy wants to sell
$100 into Yuan.

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:03.970
So if you look over here, the
supply of dollars is much

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:11.020
greater than the demand
for dollars.

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.630
And you know in anything, if
the supply of apples is

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.410
greater than the demand for
apples, then the price of

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.300
apples would go down.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.360
And the opposite is happening
here with the Yuan.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:28.480
The demand for Yuan-- this is
the demand-- is much greater

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.770
then the supply of Yuan.

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.210
And we know that when the demand
is greater than the

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:38.440
supply, the price
needs to go up.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.410
And so we saw a scenario where
the price of the dollar will

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.110
go down in terms of Yuan.

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.630
Now all that means is if you
have to give CNY 10 per

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:48.800
dollar, now you're going
to have to give

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.400
fewer Yuan per dollar.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.460
The price of Yuan
would go down.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:56.980
If the price of apples in Yuan
goes down, instead of offering

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.670
CNY 10 per apple,
you'd probably

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.060
offer CNY 8 per apple.

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.060
So we see the exact same thing
for the price of the dollar.

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.930
But that's equivalent
to saying the price

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.300
of a Yuan goes up.

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.460
Now we said eventually, and I'm
just making this number

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:11.440
up, it's hard to predict what
the actual settling price

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.339
would be, we eventually get
to CNY 8 per dollar.

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:19.204
And then we said, at that
exchange-- and actually I'm

00:04:19.204 --> 00:04:20.910
going to change the numbers a
little bit just to make it a

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.520
little bi cleaner-- at that
exchange rate, at CNY 8 per

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:33.240
dollar, these 10-Yuan dolls
would now cost $1.25.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.820
And let's say that at $1.25, in
the United States, there is

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.680
a demand for 60 dolls.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.990
I'm changing the numbers a
little bit from the last video

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.840
just to make the numbers work
out a little bit better.

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.400
So you can just ignore the
numbers from the last video.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.290
And remember, the older demand
when the 10-Yuan dolls were

00:04:53.290 --> 00:05:04.630
only $1, so the old demand
was 100 dolls.

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:05.720
So it makes sense.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:10.280
If dolls are $1, people are
going to have more of them.

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.300
If dolls go up to $1.25, the
demand will go down and say

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.150
they'll go down to 60 dolls.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.580
Now on the other side of the
equation, the $1 can of soda

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.540
at CNY 8 per dollar will now
sell in China for CNY 8.

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.020
And remember what the
old price was.

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:32.550
The old price in China where the
currency rate was 10 to 1

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.100
was CNY 10.

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:40.100
So the price-- let me write it
here-- the price the cola went

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:46.440
from CNY 10 down to CNY 8.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.360
So the demand, now that the cola
is cheaper in China, the

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.720
demand went up.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.900
And I'll change this number too,
so don't do the 80 cans.

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:59.070
We'll say that the demand in
China went from 50 cans, we

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:02.970
saw that up here-- he had to
ship 50 cans when it cost CNY

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:08.570
10 per can-- So it went from 50
cans up to-- maybe I make

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:12.260
it go up-- the demand
went from 50 up to,

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:18.240
let's say, 75 cans.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.250
I'm using these numbers because
it's going to lead to

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:21.300
cleaner numbers.

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.130
So now what is the
actual scenario?

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:25.330
In the last video I said work it
out yourself, but I realize

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:28.840
the more concrete examples of
this, the more it will kind of

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.610
sink into your brain.

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:32.960
So now what is the trade
balance going on?

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:43.150
So going from China, and then
you have the U.S. Over here

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:52.290
we're going to be shipping
60 dolls.

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:58.670
And then the U.S. is going to
ship back 60 times $1.25, that

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:02.880
is $75, right? $1.25 for
60 dolls means you're

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.850
going to get $75.

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:08.800
So $75 is going to
go back to China.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.260
So that's due to the dolls,
and now let's think about

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.310
what's going to happen
due to the soda.

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:24.700
We are going to have 75 cans
of soda are going to be

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:31.010
shipped to China and then China
is going to send back 75

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:34.575
cans at CNY 8 per can.

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:44.090
75 times 8, 600.

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:53.440
So for the 75 cans, he is going
to get back CNY 600.

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:54.740
So now what's happening?

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:59.260
The Chinese manufacturer over
here on the left wants to

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:19.630
convert $75 into-- if we assume
that the currency is

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:22.440
now eight, and he says, well,
I'll just it get at the market

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:26.770
rate-- into roughly CNY 600.

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:30.570
75 times 8 is 600.

00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:32.080
CNY 8 per dollar.

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:41.390
And then the U.S. manufacturer
wants to convert-- He's got

00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:46.850
CNY 600 from his sale of soda
and, if he assumes he can get

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:52.750
kind of the last market rate,
600 divided by 8 is into $75.

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:54.310
So what just happened here?

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:59.730
Now the supply of dollars
is equal to

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:01.440
the demand for dollars.

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:08.790
And also, the supply of Yuan
right over here is equal to

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:10.450
the demand for Yuan.

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:14.610
So now, depending on how you
view it, we're sending the

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:18.010
same dollar value to the U.S.
as we're sending back to

00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:20.780
China, or we're sending the same
Yuan value to the U.S. as

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:22.130
we're sending back to China.

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:25.890
And the currency is
now in balance.

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:27.290
It really shouldn't shift.

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:30.020
So I really wanted to go through
this example again to

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:33.890
show you that when you have
freely floating currencies,

00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:40.130
eventually one currency should
get more-- if there is a trade

00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:45.430
imbalance-- expensive than the
other until the demand

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:48.400
equalizes in both countries so
that you eventually do have a

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:49.000
trade balance.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.210
Hopefully that doesn't confuse
you too much, and in the next

00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:55.060
video, we'll talk about how a
government-- and we'll talk

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:57.360
about the Chinese Central Bank
in particular-- could

00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:00.110
intervene so that this doesn't
happen, so that they can

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:04.950
always ship more to the U.S.
than the U.S. ships to China.
