00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.720
The next major upgrade came
with Android 4.4 KitKat.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.990
Which introduced the scenes and
transitions API.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:12.390
To see what's going on behind the
scenes, let's look at a small example.

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.990
When I tap this button the OS
executes a transition and

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.060
needs to do a couple of things.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.100
First, it needs to
capture the starting and

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.490
end state for every view in the scene.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.810
And create an animator that will
interpolate between the starting

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:26.950
and end states.

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:30.060
So in this case the end state
is that the image is gone.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.000
The starting state is that
the image is visible.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.575
So here's the code to slide
a view off the top of the screen,

00:00:36.575 --> 00:00:40.075
beginDelayedTransition takes a view
group and a transition type.

00:00:40.075 --> 00:00:44.565
In this case it's the root view and
the slide transition.

00:00:44.565 --> 00:00:47.785
Immediately after the call
to beginDelayedTransition,

00:00:47.785 --> 00:00:51.322
transition calls capture start states.

00:00:51.322 --> 00:00:54.232
Which indicated captures
the start save for

00:00:54.232 --> 00:00:57.582
all views in the view group
before we've modified them.

00:00:57.582 --> 00:01:02.320
After that's done we modify the elements
we want to change or transition.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.030
When the frame is done, transition
manager calls capture end states,

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.350
which does, you guessed it,

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.960
stores the end states of all of
the views in the view group.

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.200
The transition calles creat animator
with the state and animator set and

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.680
executes it.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.810
The STK comes with a bunch of
fabricated transitions listed here.

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.650
Be mindful that all of them aren't
supported on all versions of Android, so

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.710
if you require them you might
be excluding some users.
