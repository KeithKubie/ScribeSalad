00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the library of
congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:19.670
&gt;&gt; Karen Lloyd: Good afternoon.

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.630
What a panel of experts
we have here today?

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.370
So I think everybody's
in for a real treat.

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:27.090
I'm Karen Lloyd, Director of
the Veterans History Project

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.070
and it's my pleasure to welcome
you to the most beautiful building

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.970
in Washington, D.C. On the wall

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.430 position:56%
in the Veterans History Project
Information Center, which is located

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.250
across the street in the Madison
building is a Maya Angelou quote,

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.560
which perhaps you've heard
before, "There is no greater agony

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.780
than bearing an untold
story inside you."

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.310
Monday is Memorial
Day, a day I hope,

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.450
before everyone starts their
festivities, they take a minute

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.030
to remember those who gave
their lives in service

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.630
to our country, the
ultimate sacrifice.

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.550
We should also be mindful that
many who returned home from war

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.220
and military service did
not come back unscathed

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.700
and that's why we are
gathered here today.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.760
Post-traumatic stress disorder,
PTSD, the invisible wound

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.060
that affects hundreds of veterans.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.090
Over 30% of Vietnam
veterans and 10% of Iraq

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.770
and Afghanistan veterans
experience PTSD.

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.050
But it's not just the
combat vets who are at risk.

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:31.450
Sexual assault and trauma can also
produce this debilitating disorder.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.650
PTSD can impact a veteran's ability
to work, to interact with friends

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.580
and family, just to live.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.510
While it's a -- while
it's a major factor

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.210
in veterans becoming involved --

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:44.680
and it's also a major factor

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.650
with veterans becoming involved
with our justice system.

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:49.950
While we are participating

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.330
in the Veterans History Project
cannot cure veterans of PTSD,

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.190
we hear from veterans
and experts alike

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.440
that say unburdening the weight of
their story provides some relief.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.430 position:56%
At the Veterans History Project we
make veterans' experiences available

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.360
to researchers so they
can be better understood.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.560
We hold events like this to let
veterans know they are not alone,

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.250
to raise awareness of programs such
as the Veterans Treatment Court,

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.880
that positive creative
outcomes for veterans with PTSD.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.890
Today you are -- you will hear
plenty of ideas and experiences

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.180
about PTSD and Veterans
Treatment Courts,

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.810
but those ideas will be useless
if they stay in this room.

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.430 position:56%
I hope you will learn something
from this panel and take it with you

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.730
and use it to make a difference

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.380
in someone's life,
even if in a small way.

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.820
June is National PTSD
Awareness Month, a perfect time

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.080
to get involved whether
it's volunteering

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.170
with a veteran's service
organization

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.700
or interviewing the veteran
in your life for VHP.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.590
Again, we appreciate you choosing
to be here today to learn more

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.210
about PTSD and how we
can support our veterans.

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:03.350
It is now my pleasure to
introduce our keynote speaker,

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:08.510
CNN's very own Chief Washington
Correspondent, Mr. Jake Tapper.

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:15.390
[ Applause ]

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.290
&gt;&gt; Jake Tapper: Thank you so much
for innovating me to speak before

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.540
such an important group of people
having such a crucial conversation.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:28.010
Um, I did not serve, but I
cover people who did and who do.

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.610
Uh, it is -- uh -- the honor
and responsibility of --

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.520
of what I do to tell these stories.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.250
Uh, and it is the honor
of a lifetime to do so.

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:42.470
Um, I thought that, uh, the best
thing I could contribute, um,

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:43.960
to this event would be to tell you

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:49.300
about a young man named Private
Ed Faulkner Jr. Um, that maybe,

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.430 position:56%
through his story, people could come
to understand some of the struggles

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.700
and some of the reasons why PTSD,
uh, exacts the toll that it does

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:04.150 position:56%
and why people have such a difficult
time figuring out how to fix it.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.830
Um, Ed Faulkner Jr. Was
from North Carolina.

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:10.120
He served with 3-61
Cav and he was one

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.120
of the many heroes
during the October 3rd,

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.500
2009 attack on Combat
Outpost Keating.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.800
Um, I wrote a book
about the outpost.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:24.940
Um, and the book focuses
quite a bit on, uh,

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.530 position:56%
the heroes who did not make it home.

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.810
Um, but Ed, uh, is a hero who
made it home, um, but was not able

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.950
to leave the battle behind him.

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.020
And I thought just
sharing his story might --

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.260
might help illuminate the
conversation in some small degree.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.790
Uh, after the battle where
Ed was wounded, um --

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.990
he was actually bummed out -- he
had a Purple Heart from serving

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:52.700 position:56%
in Iraq and, during the, uh, intense
battle of Combat Outpost Keating,

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.500
he was wounded again in the
same spot and he was bummed

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:56.800
because he was, um, going

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.760
to have two Purple
Hearts, but only one scar.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.710
Uh, which he thought was not fair.

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:06.580
Um, but after the battle, he was
sent to recuperate at Fort Carson

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.090
in Colorado where his wounds were
treated -- his physical wounds.

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.120
He was promoted to, um,
Private Second Class

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.880
and he was initially encouraged
to rejoin his team in Afghanistan.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.420 position:56%
Um, an officer asked him, "Don't
you want to be a real man and return

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:21.820
to Afghanistan with your unit?"

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.760
But Faulkner, um, said
something that a lot

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.910
of his fellow soldiers
didn't think was brave, but,

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:28.760
in retrospect, was very brave.

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.730
Um, he admitted that he
didn't think he was capable

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:32.440
of going back into war.

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.420
Um, he had too much going
on in his head, he said,

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:39.360
too many voices, uh,
intense nightmares.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.080
An Army physician told him that he
had post-traumatic stress disorder.

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.490
He was all ready to be fair
to the Army and had come

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:50.820
into the Army all ready,
um, something, uh -- uh --

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:54.250
in something of a precarious -- uh
-- an unstable place emotionally.

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:58.670
Um, but the battle at Combat
Outpost Keating had tipped him

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:00.770
into a chiasm chasm of sorts.

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:04.560
He lost two of his best friends,
Michael Scuuza and Chris Griffin,

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.940
um, during an attempt, uh, to
save, uh, five men who were trapped

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:10.860
in a Humvee during the battle.

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:16.070
Um, he, Griffin, another guy
named Sergeant Joshua Hart, uh,

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:19.790
had tried to rescue them stuck
in a Humvee and another Humvee.

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:22.830
At the end of the day, of the
three men in the rescue truck

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:26.720
and the five men in the
Humvee that was trapped, um,

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.180
only three of them survived.

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:30.440
Um, and Faulkner was one of them.

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:35.760
And he had, as a lot of people
have, um, survivor's guilt.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.730
Faulkner's commander
at Fort Carson, um,

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:41.280
had already suspected
he was self-medicating,

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.260
um, with illegal drugs.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.000
Um, which he thought
was contributing

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.770
to what he was going through.

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:51.360
He decided it would be better
to discharge Faulkner, um,

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.880
before he got in so much
trouble that he was, um,

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:57.380
dishonorably discharged
or even court-martialed.

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:03.750
Um, the decision upset Ed's
father, Ed Faulkner Sr., um,

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:05.880
who reached out to his congressman.

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.290
Um, his son needed
psychological therapy,

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:11.270
not humiliation, the dad said.

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:15.050
But the Army thought that they were
doing Ed Faulkner Jr. a favor, um,

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:18.660 position:56%
by kicking him out in a way that he
would be able to preserve his access

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:21.230
to the VA and his benefits.

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:28.240 position:56%
So, April 1st, 2010, Ed Faulkner Jr.
and Ed Faulkner Sr. boarded a plane,

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:31.480
um, back home to North Carolina.

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:34.190
As soon as Ed Faulkner Jr. got
back to Burlington, North Carolina,

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:36.960
he retreated into his own head.

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:40.180
Um, he did keep in touch with some
of his friends through Facebook,

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:43.850 position:56%
but he described himself as haunted.

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:47.390 position:56%
He dreamt about Iraqis coming to his
family's door, ringing the doorbell,

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:50.140
bringing their dead babies to him.

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:52.730
He lamented to his father that
he could have done something

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:57.140
to save his friend Chris Griffin's
life, but was not able to.

00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:59.650
When the son was out, he
would have flashbacks.

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:03.760
When the moon was out, he was
scared awake by nightmares.

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:06.720
Michael Scuuza, his
friend, had once been able

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:09.280
to comfort Faulkner whenever he
was having a tough time saying,

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:10.580
"It's all good, man.

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:11.920
It's all good," but
Scuuza was now gone

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:14.800 position:56%
and wasn't able to say that anymore.

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:18.340
In April, 2010, Faulkner
started in a carpet cleaning job.

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:19.960 position:56%
He would get up at 6:00am every day.

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:23.530
His boss showed him how to use
the cleaning system on his van.

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:26.040
When Faulkner stepped into a
bucket of scalding hot water,

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:28.940
he said the blisters hurt
worse than his bullet wound,

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:32.570
but he was trying -- he was
trying to make a life for himself.

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:35.960 position:56%
But the outpost always never left Ed
Faulkner Jr. He would stay up late

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:37.890
at night watching the videos

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:40.770
that the insurgents
had posted on YouTube.

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:44.260
Uh, he told a friend from
3-61 that he heard gunfire

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.790
and saw Taliban every day.

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:49.720
His father took him to a Greensboro
Grasshoppers minor league baseball

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:51.640
game on the 4th of July.

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:54.630
When the fireworks started,
Faulkner hit the ground

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:56.920
as if he was under attack.

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:59.490
Once in the middle of the night
Faulkner's mom could not find him.

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:01.310
He wasn't in his bed.

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:03.210
His truck was still in
the driveway, though.

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:04.910
He didn't answer his cell phone.

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:06.210
She got in her car in
the middle of the night,

00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:07.510
drove around the neighborhood
looking for him.

00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:09.050
He wasn't anywhere.

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:11.990
When she returned, as she pulled
into the driveway, she saw a shadow

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:13.610 position:56%
in the bushes in front of the house.

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:16.160
She walked over and she found
her son crouched down acting

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:19.530
as if he had a rifle and as if
he were looking through its scope

00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:21.820
as an enemy -- at an
enemy across the street.

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:23.850
He picked up an invisible
radio and started talking

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:25.810
to it -- into it as if in combat.

00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:27.430
She guided him to his bed.

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:30.030
The next morning, he
remembered none of it.

00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:33.200
At the end of July 2010
Ed Faulkner Jr. ran naked

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:36.000
into the street yelling that
the end of the world was coming.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.780
He stopped cars and asked
drivers if they had been saved,

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:41.870
if they had accepted Jesus
Christ as their lord and savior.

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:43.170
He was picked up by local police

00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:45.450
who called his sister,
Sara Faulkner Minor.

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:47.460
She told them that her brother
had recently been discharged

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:49.990
from the Army, had two
Purple Hearts, one from Iraq,

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:52.030
one from Afghanistan, he
had shrapnel injuries,

00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:53.330
and he was suffering from PTSD.

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:56.760
"I knew it," said the police
officer, "When we detained him,

00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:00.270
he was talking on the radio to
fellow soldiers who weren't there."

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:03.530
Both were imaginary, of course,
the soldiers and the radio.

00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:06.960
The officer said that the police
did not want to arrest Faulkner.

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:08.310
They would commit him.

00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:09.610
Sara agreed.

00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:10.930
She didn't want him to hurt
himself or anyone else.

00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:13.310
So she visited him at
the psychiatric wing

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:15.680
of Alamance Medical
Center in North Carolina.

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:19.120 position:56%
At first, she walked right past his
room because his mattress was thrown

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.860
to the floor, the occupant
inside was covered

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:23.910
from head to toe by a sheet.

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:26.030
The room clearly belonged
to somebody else,

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:28.230
not her brother, somebody unhinged.

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:29.530
"Whoever that is, bless his heart,"

00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:32.660
she said to herself
before realizing it was Ed.

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:33.960
And she walked in.

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:35.260
She tried to make conversation.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:36.560
It didn't sound like
his voice when he spoke.

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:38.090
Something had taken him over.

00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:39.390
He scared her.

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:42.750
He said to her, "I can't
sit in this nuthouse."

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:44.570
The realization knocked
the wind out of her.

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:46.500
She said, "My brother
is very ill right now."

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:48.650
He said, "This is the end for me.

00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:49.950
You have no idea how I feel.

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:51.250
I'm so stressed out.

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:52.550
I don't know why I did what I did.

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:54.260
I don't know why it happened."

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.320
She tried to tell him to
give his life over to God,

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:59.710
that only God could
save him, not drugs.

00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:02.970
But, to her, her brother
seemed beyond saving.

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:05.920
"There's all this noise in my
mind," he told her, "It won't stop.

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:07.550
It won't quiet down."

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:10.330
Faulkner was transferred to
a local veteran's hospital

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:11.630
for a couple of days.

00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:14.090
He was assigned a social worker
and then he was discharged.

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:16.220
His parents were not
impressed by the quality

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:17.730
of care their son received.

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:19.030
It all seemed very casual.

00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:20.330
It all seemed very oblivious.

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:23.320 position:56%
He clearly needed some serious help.

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:26.280
His father would say, "If you're
out in a storm, you seek shelter.

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:28.820
Ed has a storm going
on in his brain."

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:33.050
But his government, his
country provided his son

00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:35.230
with no such shelter.

00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:39.360
Faulkner soon met a woman
named Sharleen in August.

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:42.510
She told him that she was bipolar,
she suffered from manic depression.

00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:45.150
For the first time in a long
time, Faulkner did not feel alone.

00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:46.690
He had Sharleen.

00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:48.220
She knew how he felt.

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:49.720
She had a young daughter.

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:53.860
He helped her with her homework,
a normal life, or almost.

00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:55.520
He moved into her two
bedroom apartment

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:57.180
within weeks of meeting her.

00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:58.480
She was on government assistance.

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.040
She lived in subsidized
housing provided

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:02.130
through the Burlington
Housing Authority.

00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:04.480
She was prescribed asserted
medications including Methadone

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:05.780
and Xanax.

00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:07.440
She'd been investigated a
few times by local police

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:11.000
for selling the narcotics
that she had been prescribed.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.360
To Ed's family, all of this
seemed cause for alarm,

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:15.210
but he was unyielding,
"I don't have to live

00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:16.510
in the biggest house," he said.

00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:17.810
"I don't need life's finest.

00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:19.110
So what if she's on welfare?

00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:20.410
So what if she's in
government housing?

00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:23.470
These people are closest to God."

00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:25.830
Sharleen got on the phone
one time with Ed's sister.

00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:28.290
"I love your brother,"
she told Sara.

00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:30.650
She seemed space out -- spaced out.

00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:32.250
Her voice was rambling.

00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:34.240
"I can tell you're on
drugs," Sara replied.

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.570
"Lock them up.

00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:37.190
My brother was once
addicted to pain pills.

00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:38.990
Keep them out of his reach."

00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:40.290
Sharleen promised that she would.

00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:41.590
After all, she had a little girl.

00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:43.240
She had to keep her medications
out of her hands as well.

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:46.960
On the night of September
15th, 2010,

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:49.220
Sharleen found Ed Faulkner
Jr. drifting off to sleep

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:51.740
in his parked truck
behind the steering wheel.

00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:53.790
When she asked him what was
wrong, he didn't answer.

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:56.430
She helped him stumble out of
the vehicle and into her bed.

00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:57.730
The next morning, Sharleen woke up

00:12:57.730 --> 00:12:59.400
and got her daughter
ready for school.

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:00.970
She took her to the bus stop.

00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:02.550
When she came back, she
was surprised to see

00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:04.830
that Ed hadn't moved an inch.

00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:06.730
She realized he wasn't breathing.

00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:08.030
She called 9-1-1.

00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:09.330
She tried to revive him.

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:12.670
The fire department
arrived, took over the CPR.

00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:15.050
The first responders noticed
that there were several buckets

00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:16.750
of murky water in the hallway.

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:18.520
It wasn't clear whether the
apartment had functioning

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:20.530
electricity or plumbing.

00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:22.770
The mattress on which Ed
Faulkner Jr. was lying was riddled

00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:24.460
with cigarette burns.

00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:27.750
The apartment was packed with
piles of clothing and trash.

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:30.170
The bathroom was coated in filth.

00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:31.950
The police and ambulance
got there at the same time.

00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:33.580
The emergency medical
technicians ran in

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:35.630
and confirmed what the
firefighters already ascertained.

00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:37.850
Ed Faulkner Jr. Was dead.

00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:39.150
They put him on a stretcher.

00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:40.450
They wheeled him out.

00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:41.750
They placed in the
back of the ambulance

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:43.050
and they sped off to
the emergency room.

00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:46.860
An autopsy indicated his cause of
death was acute methadone toxicity.

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:50.870
A few days later, a Veterans
Administration Office worker called

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:53.940
Ed Faulkner Sr. "Would you please
let your son know he's late

00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:55.240
for his appointment?"

00:13:55.240 --> 00:14:00.620
he asked. As word of Ed
Faulkner Jr.'s death spread,

00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:04.250
his former sergeant, Jonathon
Hill, called Tye Carter,

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:08.790 position:56%
another fellow soldier from 3-61 Cav
to discuss how thoroughly the Army

00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:13.500
and then the VA had turned
their backs on their friend.

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:16.110
Tye Carter, who would later be
awarded the Medal of Honor said,

00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:19.690
"I kind of think Ed was the
9th victim of COP Keating

00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:22.730
and I honestly don't
think he'll be the last."

00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:25.430
There needs to be a
place in American society

00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:27.240
for the Ed Faulkner
Jr.'s of the world.

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:29.280
I don't have the solutions.

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:30.580
I'm a reporter.

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:32.100
I'm not a policy maker.

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:37.270
But whether it's in the Army or in
the VA or in our local communities,

00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:40.080
they are not somebody
else's problem.

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:44.240
They are not somebody in the street
just blocking you from getting

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:46.710
to work when you want
to get to work.

00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:49.450
They are our problem.

00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:51.250
That we are not doing
enough to save men

00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:55.560
like Ed Faulkner Jr.
is a national disgrace.

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:58.280
I'm going to now introduce
Major General Clyde Tate

00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:00.110
and Melissa Fitzgerald.

00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:03.600 position:56%
Returned Major General Butch Tate is
Former Deputy Judge Advocate General

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.240
for the United States
Army and now Chief Council

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:06.540
for the National Association

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:09.130
of Drug Court Professionals
and Justice for Vets.

00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:11.220
He currently service as
Special Advisor for Military

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:14.940 position:56%
and Veteran Affairs to the president
of the American Bar Association.

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:17.630
Melissa Fitzgerald was an
actor best known for her role

00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:19.440
in the TV series The West Wing.

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:21.860
She left Hollywood to
lead Justice for Vets,

00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:23.330
a division of the National
Association

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:26.760
of Drug Court Professionals where
she will not be expanding her role

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:29.700
to head up a new initiative
called Advancing Justice.

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:32.780
I want to thank you for taking
the time for listening to my story

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:34.350
about Ed Faulkner Jr. and I hope

00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:37.240
that this meeting today helps
prevent future tragedies

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:38.540
from happening.

00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:39.840
It's been my honor.

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:41.640
Thank you.

00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:54.330
[ Applause ]

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:55.630
&gt;&gt; Melissa Fitzgerald:
Well, thank you, Jake,

00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:57.210
for all that you do
on behalf of veterans.

00:15:57.210 --> 00:15:59.510
You really -- do incredible work.

00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:02.520
[ Applause ]

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:05.600
And I'd also like to
thank Greg Crawford, um,

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:09.080
who is here on the panel, uh, from
National Institute of Corrections

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:11.560
for inviting us to
join in today's event.

00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:14.590
And I appreciate your
efforts and National Institute

00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:17.970
of Corrections' support of
veterans who are involved

00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:20.550
in the criminal justice system.

00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:25.250 position:56%
It has been the greatest honor of my
life to be part of Justice for Vets,

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:30.550
an organization that is having a
profound impact and real impact

00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:33.310
on the lives of veterans
and their families.

00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:35.930
I'm excited to expand
my role, um, and --

00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:38.770
and launch the new initiatives
of Advancing Justice.

00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:44.910
I think we all know that our
veterans are among our nation's

00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:48.910
greatest and most valuable
civic assets.

00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:52.980
They are the backbone of American
society instilled with the --

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:56.760
the values that most
of us aspire to, honor,

00:16:56.760 --> 00:17:01.620
duty, leadership, respect.

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:06.040
We know that the vast majority of
our nation's veterans return home

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:11.290
as leaders, part of their
communities, and valued members

00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:15.930
of our communities
leading exemplary lives.

00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:20.820
We also know that everyone's
journey home is not the same

00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:23.170
and some will struggle.

00:17:23.170 --> 00:17:26.980
We cannot ignore the fact that one
in five returning veterans suffers

00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:32.100
from PTSD and one and six suffers
from a substance use disorder.

00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:35.770
We cannot ignore the debilitating
effect of traumatic brain injuries

00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:40.900
and other trauma related injuries
on the lives of military families.

00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:44.980
We cannot ignore that these
issues often lead to homelessness,

00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:48.910
unemployment, arrest, or worse.

00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:52.140
If we do not intercept
these vulnerable veterans

00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:56.820
at the key moments of crisis, we
may not have another opportunity.

00:17:57.950 --> 00:18:00.650
Instead of sending
our veterans to jail,

00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:04.070
Veterans Treatment Courts ensure
that the veterans who struggle

00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:07.290
with the transition home become
involved in the justice system

00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:10.700
with a substance use disorder
and/or mental health condition

00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:14.480
or trauma receive the structured
treatment and mentoring they need

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:17.240
to get their lives back on track.

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:19.530
Veterans Treatment
Courts give our veterans

00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:22.750
who defended our freedoms
the opportunities to fight

00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:25.740
for their own freedoms,
freedoms from addiction,

00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:28.390
freedoms from mental anguish,
freedom from unemployment,

00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:33.060
freedom from homelessness,
and freedom from isolation.

00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:36.560
Veterans Treatment Courts recognize
that restoring our veterans

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:40.170
to healthy citizens not
only honors their sacrifice,

00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:43.590
but it makes our communities
stronger.

00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:46.290
And Veterans Treatment Courts work.

00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:48.100
They work by reducing crime.

00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:51.430
They work by saving the taxpayer
a tremendous amount of money.

00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:55.680
And they work by returning health
veterans to our communities

00:18:55.680 --> 00:19:00.260
where we greatly need it -- they
are needed and where they belong.

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:02.790
At Justice for Vets
it is our mission

00:19:02.790 --> 00:19:05.020
to put a veteran's
treatment court within reach

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:07.750
of every veteran in need.

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:11.020
Justice for Vets is the only
national organization committed

00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:14.500
and dedicated to the expansion
of veteran's treatment courts.

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:19.850
And I am happy to say that
today there are 15,000 veterans

00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:21.460
who would otherwise be incarcerated

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:23.970
who are receiving life-saving
treatment in the

00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:28.660
over 330 veteran's treatment
courts across the country.

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:33.440
And, with that, I will
turn it over to you, Butch.

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:35.740
&gt;&gt; Clyde Tate: Thanks, Melissa.

00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:41.000
Let me just briefly add my
thanks for the opportunity to be

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.840
with you today and to offer
my thanks to all of you

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:47.560
for joining this conversation,
a conversation

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:52.300
that our nation must have about
providing a holistic solution

00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:57.010
to the challenges facing
some of our veterans.

00:19:57.010 --> 00:20:00.670
When a veteran and his or her
conduct brings them into contact

00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:04.390
with law enforcement and eventually
our criminal justice system,

00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:10.530
our nation, we, have a choice,
a choice between placing them

00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:14.860
in a criminal justice system
that may not have the capacity

00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:20.670
or the capability to consider their
unique experiences and challenges

00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:24.200
and a system where we are
likely to see them again,

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:27.600
or we can make the
choice that because

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:32.760 position:56%
of their service we are placing them
in a criminal justice environment

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:36.480
where the unique background
and experiences are understood,

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:41.360 position:56%
where the system melds treatment
with intensive supervision all aimed

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:44.330
at improving outcomes, in
other words placing them

00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:47.540
in a veterans treatment court.

00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:51.570 position:56%
Veterans Treatment Courts, if
you're not familiar with that model,

00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:56.470
are a form of problem solving
courts akin to drug courts,

00:20:56.470 --> 00:21:00.750
which number in excess of 3,500,
and really have been a part

00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:04.470
of our jurisprudence since 1989.

00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:07.460
Problem solving courts like DUI
courts, women's drug courts,

00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:11.340
domestic violence and mental
health courts, to name but a few,

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:14.260
all of which were created to
address the specific needs

00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:19.240
and appreciate the unique
experiences of their population.

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:23.730
But it wasn't until 2008 when a
courageous judge and his staff

00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:28.250
in Buffalo, New York
recognized more could be done

00:21:28.250 --> 00:21:31.750
to improve the outcomes of veterans

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:35.550
in their criminal justice
system and a movement began.

00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:37.860
They chose, again,
a matter of choice,

00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:42.290 position:56%
they chose to do something different
and started the conversation,

00:21:42.290 --> 00:21:46.870
a conversation today, which all
of us are privileged to continue.

00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:49.270 position:56%
Now I've been a part of these courts
since I retired from the Army three

00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:52.130
and a half years ago and
the Army taught me to kind

00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:54.780
of be a bottom line,
up front person.

00:21:54.780 --> 00:22:00.040
I have, however, spared you
the use of PowerPoint today.

00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:02.830 position:56%
But my bottom line up front is this,

00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:07.240
I believe that veterans
treatment courts, our government,

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:13.720
the judiciary, and the community
at their very, very finest moment.

00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:17.830
In trying times, if you want
to believe in something,

00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:20.610
I urge you to choose
to believe in the value

00:22:20.610 --> 00:22:22.640
of the veteran's treatment courts.

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:24.520
Now, there are a couple
of distinguishing features

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:27.110
of these courts that
I'll highlight for you,

00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:29.320
special ingredients if you will.

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:33.930
The use of volunteer
veteran mentors who choose

00:22:33.930 --> 00:22:36.360
to be a part of these courts.

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:40.980
Trust me, no one responds
to a veteran like a veteran.

00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:44.530
No one cares for a veteran
like another veteran.

00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:46.550
They become their battle buddies.

00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:51.560 position:56%
The other special ingredient,
veteran's justice outreach officers.

00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:54.910
A great new story for the
Department of Veteran Affairs.

00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:57.450
These VJOs, as they're
called, sit in court

00:22:57.450 --> 00:23:03.810 position:56%
and almost instantly connect the
justice involved veteran to benefits

00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:08.590
and services that they
may not otherwise pursue.

00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:12.980
But why do I urge you
to choose these courts?

00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:16.250
As my colleague, my battle buddy,

00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:21.410
my teammate Melissa
said, because they work.

00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:25.550 position:56%
The data is now showing what we have
known anecdotally for some time,

00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:30.540
that trauma focused treatment
combined with the support

00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:34.030
of veteran mentors improves
outcomes dramatically

00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:37.120
for our justice involved veterans.

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:41.760
And, importantly, these
courts restore home.

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:44.220
They unlock potential.

00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:47.560
And they promote a
lifestyle of recovery.

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:49.610
And as a nation are we really going

00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:54.130
to choose anything
less for our veterans?

00:23:54.130 --> 00:23:55.460
I hope not.

00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:59.230
I'm grateful for our panels
today and the information you're

00:23:59.230 --> 00:24:01.940
about to get from them who will
give up their time and expertise

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:04.010
to help us better understand
and, thus,

00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:07.200
treat one of the unique
challenges facing some

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:09.530
of our veterans and that is PTSD.

00:24:09.530 --> 00:24:12.540
The more we know and
the more we understand,

00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:16.520
the more lives we can change,
the more lives we can save.

00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:18.510

&gt;&gt; Melissa Fitzgerald: Now,
before we share a video

00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:29.800
from the National Institute
of Collections' live broadcast

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:33.870
on veterans treatment courts,
um, you know, I'd like to say

00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:36.460
that this video will
highlight the struggles

00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:39.240
that some of our veterans face.

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:42.980
I think it is very important
for all of us to remember,

00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:47.290
as we watch the video and
throughout today's conversation,

00:24:47.290 --> 00:24:49.600
as I said before, that
the vast majority

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:53.510
of our veterans are strengthened
by their military service

00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:57.250
and they are returning
home truly as civic assets.

00:24:57.250 --> 00:25:02.720
And one characteristic that
all of our veterans share,

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:08.290
including the ones who are
struggling, is one of resilience.

00:25:08.290 --> 00:25:11.680
When given the structure, the
treatment, and the mentoring

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:15.300
in veteran's treatment courts,
the veterans who are participating

00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:19.110
in these programs thrive.

00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:24.800 position:56%
They too return home to our
communities where they are valuable,

00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:31.450 position:56%
valuable members of our communities,
leaders, and civic assets.

00:25:31.450 --> 00:25:35.160
And what has been remarkable to see
in the past three and a half years

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:39.160
of traveling around the country and
getting to know the men and women

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:43.940
who participate in these veterans'
treatment court programs is

00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:48.310
that they are of the finest men
and women I have ever encountered.

00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:50.150
And I am humbled to know them.

00:25:50.150 --> 00:25:52.890
I am honored to work
on their behalf.

they are for the second chance

00:25:55.740 --> 00:26:00.130
and how committed they are
to giving back proves to all

00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:04.640

programs are so greatly needed.

spiraled out of control.

the hardest part about going

My experience with veterans, I've
worked with them for over a decade.

00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:40.070
And it started about 12 years ago

00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:42.330
when I started a program called
the Welcome Home Project.

00:29:42.330 --> 00:29:44.970
It was a simple thing and in my
mind I just thought it was one

00:29:44.970 --> 00:29:46.270
of those things I wanted to do.

00:29:46.270 --> 00:29:49.200
I just wanted to give a handshake
and a hug to veterans coming home

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:51.480
who had received a Purple
Heart just to tell them,

00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:52.780
"It's good to have you home.

00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:54.080
We love you.

00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:55.380
You're valued."

00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:56.680
And, you know, you hear about PTSD.

00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:58.870
I was a history student in college
and so I'd studied World War II

00:29:58.870 --> 00:30:00.880
and they didn't call
it PTSD at that time.

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:03.280
They just called it people who
were remote or maybe they drank,

00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:05.420
whatever it was they
-- they were escapists.

00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:07.730
But I'll never forget
the first ceremony I had

00:30:07.730 --> 00:30:10.450
where we had these baskets and we
had a couple hundred people show

00:30:10.450 --> 00:30:11.750
up to give them hugs and handshakes

00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:13.410
and it was a young,
good looking corpsman.

00:30:13.410 --> 00:30:15.390
And he just walked up to me.

00:30:15.390 --> 00:30:18.030
He was as normal as could be and
he said, "Why are you doing this?"

00:30:18.030 --> 00:30:19.520
And I said, "Well, it's
the right thing to do."

00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:21.980
And all of a sudden he started
to shake and he gave me a hug

00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:24.210
and he started to sob in my arms.

00:30:24.210 --> 00:30:28.220
And that was my first real brush
with PTSD of understanding that,

00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:31.720
you know, here I am celebrating
these spirits that had seemed

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:33.700 position:56%
to be untouched and unbroken by war,

00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:37.130
and yet these spirits not only were
touched, they were being shattered.

00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:40.680
In some. And, again, it has
to be emphasized it is some.

00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:43.160
And I knew from that day on that
there's more that needs to be done.

00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:44.670
There's a story that
needs to be told.

00:30:44.670 --> 00:30:46.480
And it is our problem to fix.

00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:48.630
These are our warriors
we're sending off to protect

00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:50.100
and preserve our freedoms.

00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:52.620
The least we can do is
try and figure it out.

00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:55.490
The best I can tell is -- and from
talking to a number of veterans,

00:30:55.490 --> 00:30:59.380
if you've never been in combat, if
you've never experienced combat,

00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:02.030
then it's impossible for
you to truly understand it.

00:31:02.030 --> 00:31:03.990
And one veteran who's put
it as plainly as he could,

00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:07.340
he was with the unit in infantry,
he said, "in a five minute period

00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:09.500
in my lifetime I walked
into a situation

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:12.850
and all I remember smelling
was gun smoke and gun powder

00:31:12.850 --> 00:31:15.460
and hearing mortars going off, and
seeing three of my friends dead

00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:17.240
on the ground, or at
least pieces of them."

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:19.830
I don't know how you
translate that to people

00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:23.030
who have never experienced combat
and then expect them to come home

00:31:23.030 --> 00:31:25.450
and then obey a traffic light

00:31:25.450 --> 00:31:28.370
and have baseball games
playing on the background.

00:31:28.370 --> 00:31:31.330 position:56%
Those are the kinds of things that
are very difficult if not impossible

00:31:31.330 --> 00:31:33.560
to transition, but that
really is the goal.

00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:36.900
And having resources and experts
like you see here in front of you,

00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:39.200
that is -- at least to get
the conversation going --

00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:42.030 position:56%
they've been having the conversation
a long time, but perhaps some

00:31:42.030 --> 00:31:44.600
of the audience who are
policy makers or have access

00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:47.640
to do something about this, perhaps
then we've done something today

00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:48.940 position:56%
or we'll accomplish something today.

00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:50.910
So, let's start with
introducing the panel.

00:31:50.910 --> 00:31:52.790 position:56%
I'll have them introduce themselves.

00:31:52.790 --> 00:31:54.090
They'll tell you their name.

00:31:54.090 --> 00:31:55.390
They'll tell you what
they've been doing.

00:31:55.390 --> 00:31:56.690
Give it a couple minutes each.

00:31:56.690 --> 00:31:57.990
Greg, let's start with you.

00:31:57.990 --> 00:31:59.290
&gt;&gt; Greg Crawford: Thanks, John.

00:31:59.290 --> 00:32:00.590
Hi, I'm Greg Crawford.

00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:01.890
I'm a veteran US Air Force.

00:32:01.890 --> 00:32:04.630
I'm also currently a
correctional program specialist

00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:06.570
at the National Institute
of Corrections.

00:32:06.570 --> 00:32:09.970
And, first, I want to thank those
that have served our country and,

00:32:09.970 --> 00:32:13.650
more importantly, some of those who
have continued to serve by serving

00:32:13.650 --> 00:32:15.520
as volunteer veteran peer mentors

00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:17.090
in veteran's treatment
courts across the country.

00:32:17.090 --> 00:32:18.390
We appreciate your service.

00:32:18.390 --> 00:32:22.410
I also want to thank John -- Andrew
Huber and the Library of Congress

00:32:22.410 --> 00:32:26.990
for giving us this opportunity,
Jake Tapper for taking time

00:32:26.990 --> 00:32:29.290
out of his day to come see us,
and especially our colleagues

00:32:29.290 --> 00:32:32.100
over there, Melissa
Fitzgerald and Butch Tate,

00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:34.470
very much appreciate both of you.

00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:37.880
Um -- uh -- and Jonathon, thank
you for serving as moderator today

00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:40.370
and for the work that you do
on the Welcome Home Project.

00:32:40.370 --> 00:32:42.170
And, uh, as a runner,
I also appreciate

00:32:42.170 --> 00:32:44.680
that you were the only reporter
sitting on the finish line

00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:47.100
at the Boston Marathon bombing.

00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:49.610
Um, after my service,
I was able to go

00:32:49.610 --> 00:32:52.600
on to complete my bachelor's degree
at Washington State University

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:55.240
and my master's degree
at Chapman University.

00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:57.990
I started my professional
career in mental health.

00:32:57.990 --> 00:33:01.910
I went on to serve 11 years in
Pierce County District Court, um,

00:33:01.910 --> 00:33:04.000
as a probation officer
and supervisor, director,

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.080 position:56%
and manager of alternative programs.

00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:09.980
Came to NIC in 2012 and,
shortly after my arrival,

00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:13.730
my former supervisor and
former director of the agency,

00:33:13.730 --> 00:33:16.520
Jim Cosby walked by my office
one day and he says, "Greg,

00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:18.970
I want you to do something
about veterans," and he sent me

00:33:18.970 --> 00:33:20.660
to the Executive Health
Council meeting

00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:22.470
that was chaired by Dr. Tom Berger.

00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:25.710
I attended that meeting and I --
in between presentations, I came up

00:33:25.710 --> 00:33:27.390
and introduced myself
and we got to talking.

00:33:27.390 --> 00:33:29.660
He says, "You know, you
got to meet Bernie Edelman.

00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:33.440
And the three of us met at Union
Station in Washington, D.C. here

00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:35.840
and we started scribbling
down ideas on napkins.

00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:40.250
And, uh, four site visits, three
national conferences to Justice

00:33:40.250 --> 00:33:41.550
for Vets National Conference,

00:33:41.550 --> 00:33:44.520
and lots of interviews later we
produced Veterans Treatment Courts

00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:46.170
as a second chance for vets
who have lost their way.

00:33:46.170 --> 00:33:50.110
And this publication, um, some
of you may have gotten a copy of,

00:33:50.110 --> 00:33:51.690
really served as the
platform for a lot

00:33:51.690 --> 00:33:53.870 position:56%
of our veteran's initiatives at NIC.

00:33:53.870 --> 00:33:55.680
And we'll get into that
a little bit today.

00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:58.410
Um, I'd be remiss if I didn't
thank the National Institute

00:33:58.410 --> 00:34:00.820
of Corrections leadership for their
support of veterans initiatives

00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:04.400
and also to, uh, our editor
at NIC, Donna Leadbetter,

00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:06.480
who has taken up an interest
in veterans initiatives

00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:09.770
and was responsible for
connecting us to Andrew Huber.

00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:12.450
So, um, we're looking forward
to discussing what we're working

00:34:12.450 --> 00:34:15.500
on at NIC and I'll
pass it over to Bernie.

00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:17.270
&gt;&gt; Bernie Edelman: Good handoff.

00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:19.560
I'm Bernie Edelman.

00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:22.360
I'm assent Brooklyn, New York.

00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:28.110
I grew up in a public
housing project in Canarsie.

00:34:28.110 --> 00:34:34.360
Uh, which politely is called
the armpit of the borough.

00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:42.170
Uh, if my housing projects of about
10,000 souls was its own little

00:34:42.170 --> 00:34:45.190
city, uh, we would have
been mourning the deaths

00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:50.180
of about 10 guys in Southeast Asia.

00:34:50.180 --> 00:34:58.080
Um, I got drafted, conscripted,
right after I got out of college.

00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:05.530 position:56%
I spent most of 1970 halfway around
the world in a place called Vietnam,

00:35:05.530 --> 00:35:08.260
which keeps coming
back to me and one

00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:10.740
of the reasons I'm
doing what I'm doing.

00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:15.960
Um, I participated in the
first veterans art show

00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:19.260
in Saint Paul, Minnesota.

00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:22.850
Brought the show to New York City.

00:35:22.850 --> 00:35:29.810
Did a piece for the Daily News
Sunday Magazine I didn't bill

00:35:29.810 --> 00:35:31.110
them for.

00:35:31.110 --> 00:35:33.810
We had 1,500 people
on opening night,

00:35:33.810 --> 00:35:37.590
650 a day coming in
to see this stuff.

00:35:37.590 --> 00:35:45.370 position:56%
Uh, and about 15% of the work sold,
which helped the artists themselves.

00:35:45.370 --> 00:35:48.880
Uh, that led to my
appointment by Mayor Ed Koch

00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:54.130
who was the first public official,
elected official to put his money

00:35:54.130 --> 00:35:58.060
where his mouth was and
actually help Vietnam veterans.

00:35:58.060 --> 00:36:01.610
I think -- I know I owe
him a debt of gratitude.

00:36:01.610 --> 00:36:06.130
And, um, on the New York Vietnam
Veterans Memorial Commission,

00:36:06.130 --> 00:36:11.170
I served on a committee that
chose the design for the memorial.

00:36:11.170 --> 00:36:18.210
And that was the basis for
this book, Dear America:

00:36:18.210 --> 00:36:22.280
Letters Home from Vietnam, which I
did in about 10 weeks with seven,

00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:24.250
eight weeks of fine tuning.

00:36:24.250 --> 00:36:26.620
Did it for the commission.

00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:31.610
Uh, HBO did a film
based on this book.

00:36:31.610 --> 00:36:39.130
Um, won them two of their
first three Emmys ever.

00:36:39.130 --> 00:36:46.060 position:56%
We then did a documentary short that
was nominated for an Academy Award.

00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:53.020
Uh, meanwhile I was named the first
Director of the Mayor's Office

00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:55.740
of Veterans Affairs for
the city of New York.

00:36:55.740 --> 00:37:01.960
Did that until Ed left his
job and Bernie left his.

00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:07.920
Uh, I did some other things,
but Vietnam keeps coming back.

00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:11.340
I'm a writer, a photographer,
an editor.

00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:17.650
Um, I've done a couple of
other books and I consider, uh,

00:37:17.650 --> 00:37:20.760
the second chance to
be one of the books.

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:25.360
When I met Greg and he
asked me to do something,

00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:28.720
I think he was thinking of,
you know, a 16 page brochure,

00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:33.400
short booklet, about how to
do a veterans treatment court.

00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:38.900
I told him I would do something
unlike any government publication

00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:40.390
and I think we succeeded on that.

00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:44.890
I gave him 40,000 words, uh,
and a lot of it in the words

00:37:44.890 --> 00:37:53.020
of the folks we spoke with, uh,
together, Doc Berger, myself, Greg.

00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:56.540
It was, you know, a
hell of an experience.

00:37:56.540 --> 00:38:03.100
Uh, I was so impressed, so taken
by the sense of commitment,

00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:10.090 position:56%
the eloquence, of the folks we spoke
with whether they were graduates

00:38:10.090 --> 00:38:12.410
of the veteran's treatment
court, whether they worked

00:38:12.410 --> 00:38:14.510
in a veterans treatment court.

00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:19.150
Uh, and they told their
stories beautifully.

00:38:19.150 --> 00:38:23.060
And this is something
that has stuck with me

00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:30.900 position:56%
and I see deserves all the credit in
the world for doing a lot of stuff

00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:34.180
to help justice involved veterans.

00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:38.770
They formed the Justice Involved
Veterans Network, folks who were

00:38:38.770 --> 00:38:46.150
in the field and myself serve
on it, and we hope to do things

00:38:46.150 --> 00:38:53.220
that will effect policy not only
on a national level, but from state

00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:59.930
to state to state because
veterans today choose

00:38:59.930 --> 00:39:02.590
to serve in the military.

00:39:02.590 --> 00:39:06.580 position:56%
Uh, no longer is anyone conscripted.

00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:12.700
Uh, it's not an accident of birth
that you serve in the military.

00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:16.450 position:56%
We owe something to those who serve.

00:39:16.450 --> 00:39:20.190
And if they get in trouble
with the law and get caught

00:39:20.190 --> 00:39:24.840
up in the great maw of the
criminal justice system,

00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:32.790
we have to do everything we can to
help them divert from imprisonment,

00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:36.610 position:56%
help them get their lives
together, or if they are imprisoned,

00:39:36.610 --> 00:39:41.910
help them when they get out with
mentors, help them re-acclimate

00:39:41.910 --> 00:39:47.120
to the society that a lot of
folks feel has abandoned them.

00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:49.550
With that, Doc.

00:39:49.550 --> 00:39:50.850
&gt;&gt; Judge.

00:39:50.850 --> 00:39:52.150
&gt;&gt; Bernie Edelman: Oh, judge.

00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:53.450
&gt;&gt; Vance Peterson: OK [laughing].

00:39:53.450 --> 00:39:54.750
Thank you.

00:39:54.750 --> 00:39:56.050
I'm Vance Peterson.

00:39:56.050 --> 00:39:57.350
I'm a District Court
Judge in Spokane.

00:39:57.350 --> 00:40:00.190
I've been on the bench for 26
years and during the course of most

00:40:00.190 --> 00:40:04.480
of that time I also served 29
years active reserve and guard.

00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:07.000
Unlike Bernie I was not in
the projects of New York.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.040
I grew up on a small ranch
about five miles south

00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:11.460
of Canada in Washington State.

00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:14.820
And when I was 18 the
choice was, at that time --

00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:16.740
I wanted an education badly --

00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:21.010
our high school at that time had
lost five individuals in Vietnam.

00:40:21.010 --> 00:40:23.290
That was not a consideration,
of course, when you're 18.

00:40:23.290 --> 00:40:27.040
So the choice for me was to follow
a long standing family tradition

00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:29.350
of enlisting in the
Marine Corps, uh,

00:40:29.350 --> 00:40:31.320
which everybody in my family was.

00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:33.710
Or -- and one day I got an
envelope from the Army saying,

00:40:33.710 --> 00:40:36.140
"congratulations, you have
a four year ROTC scholarship

00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:40.290
to Gonzaga University, home of
the Gonzaga Bulldogs," and I took

00:40:40.290 --> 00:40:43.520
that opportunity and went to
-- to -- to school at Gonzaga.

00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:46.000
After that I served four
years on active duty.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:49.860
I had four years -- about two and a
half to three years in the infantry

00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:52.780
and was lucky enough to get
involved in special forces,

00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:55.160
went to the special
forces qualification course

00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:59.870 position:56%
after ranger school, and ended up at
28 years of service at the age of --

00:40:59.870 --> 00:41:03.980
in 2003, at the age of 50 being
told by the reserve and guard,

00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:05.280
"Well, you're too old now.

00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:07.470
You didn't make full
colonel so you're out."

00:41:07.470 --> 00:41:09.640
So I kind of just went
back to being a judge,

00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:12.190
which is what I was doing
for a living anyway.

00:41:12.190 --> 00:41:18.190
About 2000 -- I think it was the
fall of 2009, we started seeing,

00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:23.030 position:56%
on our bench, an influx of primarily
young males, but some young females,

00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:27.170
who were coming in with really no
criminal history and no background

00:41:27.170 --> 00:41:29.430
that was no more or less
like we normally saw

00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:32.160
with the quote normal
criminals coming in.

00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:35.240
The common thread for these
folks coming in with DUIs,

00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:39.980 position:56%
reckless driving, assaults, domestic
violence cases was military service.

00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:41.950
And we -- I noticed that
they were all veterans.

00:41:41.950 --> 00:41:45.040
At that time I was running
a domestic violence court

00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:49.940
and I researched and I checked out
and I found Judge Robert Russel

00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:51.580
and -- an incredible man.

00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:54.640
And, for the most part, we
modeled everything we did

00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:57.490
after him in Spokane County.

00:41:57.490 --> 00:42:00.800
With that we put together
a veteran's court.

00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:04.320
Um, and after the first year, we're
getting ready to go to graduation.

00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:05.790
We're going to graduation
with our first guy.

00:42:05.790 --> 00:42:07.280
We're very, very excited.

00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:11.270 position:56%
Our first guy, I won't give you his
last name, but he had served four --

00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:14.100
two tours with the
ranger battalion in Iraq.

00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:17.850
And then he did two National
Guard tours over the course

00:42:17.850 --> 00:42:21.420
of this period with
the 1-61 infantry.

00:42:21.420 --> 00:42:25.270
And he was a psychology
student at WSU.

00:42:25.270 --> 00:42:28.780 position:56%
Spokane Washington's about 60 north.

00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:32.110
His beloved girlfriend in Spokane
called him up one day and said,

00:42:32.110 --> 00:42:33.820
"Hey, I think we're
going to break up,"

00:42:33.820 --> 00:42:36.490
and did what any good Ranger
Battalion guy would have done

00:42:36.490 --> 00:42:38.760
at that time, probably drink
about a half a fifth of whiskey,

00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:40.520
hopped in his car, drove
all the way to Spokane.

00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:44.070
And as he was professing his
love gently rapping on the door

00:42:44.070 --> 00:42:48.150
to his girlfriend who was at 9-1-1,
two law enforcement officers came

00:42:48.150 --> 00:42:50.800
up behind him and he turned
a perfectly good misdemeanor

00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:52.440
into three felonies.

00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:54.600
He had two assaults on an officer.

00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:58.470
He had the breaking and
entering into the apartment.

00:42:58.470 --> 00:43:03.050
And when they brought us before
him that year earlier, that time,

00:43:03.050 --> 00:43:05.080
they reduced the felonies
to misdemeanors,

00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:08.370
carried them for dismissal
if he completed this program.

00:43:08.370 --> 00:43:10.340
And he did complete the program.

00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:13.850
As a matter of fact, he requested
to get out early by about two weeks

00:43:13.850 --> 00:43:17.920
because he had to go
on his 5th deployment.

00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:22.970 position:56%
And he definitely had PTSD, but at
that time he just went ahead anyway.

00:43:22.970 --> 00:43:24.270
We graduated him early.

00:43:24.270 --> 00:43:25.650
About that time my phone rang.

00:43:25.650 --> 00:43:30.650
I had a friend of mine in DC
who said, "Hey, you're retired.

00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:33.530
You're 58.

00:43:33.530 --> 00:43:36.300
How would you like to go
to Afghanistan for a year?"

00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:39.680
And I said, "I'd like
to go to Costa Rica.

00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:43.610 position:56%
I'd like to go to Hawaii," but I had
a Special Forces MOS and it would be

00:43:43.610 --> 00:43:46.110
as a combat advisor
to an Afghan unit.

00:43:46.110 --> 00:43:47.410
And I -- I said, "I got a year.

00:43:47.410 --> 00:43:48.710
I can give you a year."

00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:50.010
And I gave them a year.

00:43:50.010 --> 00:43:53.030
I learned more in that
year about PTSD

00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:57.430
and the young people fighting
this war, it was incredible to me.

00:43:57.430 --> 00:43:59.450
The best experience I had
over there was working

00:43:59.450 --> 00:44:03.230
with these young infantry troops,
32 man platoon supporting us,

00:44:03.230 --> 00:44:07.480
average age of about 26, all
National Guardsman with an average

00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:09.620
of about two years of combat tours.

00:44:09.620 --> 00:44:12.120
That's how they made their living.

00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:14.560
Oddly enough and coincidentally,
when I got assigned

00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:18.140
to the advisory unit, one of
the individuals was the guy

00:44:18.140 --> 00:44:19.900 position:56%
that first graduated from our class.

00:44:19.900 --> 00:44:22.080
And I'm proud to say he
was my guardian angel

00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:24.790
for the last two months
in Afghanistan.

00:44:24.790 --> 00:44:27.870
With that, our program's
graduated 140 people.

00:44:27.870 --> 00:44:31.400
The most important statistic we
have, however, everyone's required

00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:35.420
to read a letter to the court at
the end of their, uh, graduation.

00:44:35.420 --> 00:44:36.820
Twenty of them indicated

00:44:36.820 --> 00:44:39.220
on the record they would
have committed suicide

00:44:39.220 --> 00:44:41.320
but for this program.

00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:43.210
So it's been an incredible
event for me,

00:44:43.210 --> 00:44:45.840
an incredible honor
to be with this panel.

00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:47.140
And I'm being sandwiched

00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:52.310
between these two Vietnam
vets, I feel somewhat small.

00:44:52.310 --> 00:44:53.750
&gt;&gt; Tom Berger: Thank you, Judge.

00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:56.280
Um, I'm Tom Berger.

00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:57.580
Um --

00:44:57.580 --> 00:44:58.920
&gt;&gt; Dr. Tom Berger.

00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:04.620
&gt;&gt; Tom Berger: I am the, uh,
son of two World War II vets.

00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:09.000
My father was with Carlson's
Raiders, a Marine battalion,

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:10.300
who was wounded on Tarawa.

00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:14.560
And by the time he got to the
states, the Marines, at that time,

00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:18.220
sent their wounded in the
Pacific to Balboa Hospital

00:45:18.220 --> 00:45:20.780
where he met this red-headed nurse.

00:45:20.780 --> 00:45:22.440
And so here I am.

00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:24.800
[ Laughter ]

00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:26.860
In any case, I grew up in a family

00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:30.270
that was very attuned
to military service.

00:45:30.270 --> 00:45:35.840 position:56%
Not only my parents, my grandparents
on both sides served in World War I.

00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:42.550 position:56%
In fact, my paternal grandfather was
a tanker in World War I with Patton

00:45:42.550 --> 00:45:48.260
and I grew up with a picture of
him standing outside this vehicle

00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:50.870
that looked like the
Millennium Falcon.

00:45:50.870 --> 00:45:52.170
All right?

00:45:52.170 --> 00:45:55.800
That probably ran three
miles and then it broke down.

00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:58.380
But, anyway.

00:45:58.380 --> 00:46:07.560
So in 1965 I got a letter
from the Army that said,

00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:10.730
"We request your presence."

00:46:10.730 --> 00:46:15.940
So not knowing what to
do, I called my dad.

00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:19.940
And I said, "Pop, what do I do?"

00:46:19.940 --> 00:46:23.570
He said, "I don't want
you in the Army."

00:46:23.570 --> 00:46:30.420
Um, and um -- "I don't want you in
the Marines because they're already

00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:33.330
over there and they're
getting their ass kicked."

00:46:33.330 --> 00:46:36.620
Um -- so he said, "Why
don't you try the Navy?"

00:46:36.620 --> 00:46:43.070
So I, uh, found out where the local
-- the nearest Navy recruiter was

00:46:43.070 --> 00:46:45.140
and ran over there and joined.

00:46:45.140 --> 00:46:48.390
And just after I'd raised my hand,

00:46:48.390 --> 00:46:52.600
I ran into a high school
classmate in his uniform.

00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:54.810
He really looked sharp.

00:46:54.810 --> 00:46:59.540
He said, "Tom," he said, "Are
you still going to school?"

00:46:59.540 --> 00:47:00.840
I said, "Yeah.

00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:04.810
But I'm not taking enough hours
so I got drafted and here I am."

00:47:04.810 --> 00:47:06.760
He said, "What was your major?"

00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:08.510
I said, "Premed."

00:47:08.510 --> 00:47:12.650
He said, "Well, you ought to
sign up to be a corpsman."

00:47:12.650 --> 00:47:16.550
He said, "I just did two years
at Memphis Naval Air Station.

00:47:16.550 --> 00:47:18.250
There was women.

00:47:18.250 --> 00:47:19.700
Skills I learned.

00:47:19.700 --> 00:47:22.590
I had to wear a uniform,
but it was cool."

00:47:22.590 --> 00:47:25.600
So I ran right in and signed
up to go to corpsman school

00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:29.380
and whenever -- when I got home,
I thought my father was going

00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:31.270
to beat the crap out of me.

00:47:31.270 --> 00:47:33.260
He said, "You know
what corpsman do?"

00:47:33.260 --> 00:47:34.560
I said, "No, pop."

00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:38.630
He said, "They serve
with the Marines."

00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:46.310
So, um, I served with the
Marines in Vietnam off and on,

00:47:46.310 --> 00:47:49.860
3rd Mar Division, 3rd
Battalion, 3rd Recon.

00:47:49.860 --> 00:47:55.590
Um, got the magic wound in the
spring of 1968 at Khe Sanh.

00:47:55.590 --> 00:48:00.790
Um, when I came home
the country was nuts.

00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:05.090
I tried to be an EMT or
what they call EMTs now,

00:48:05.090 --> 00:48:08.530
but there was no coordination
amongst police, fire,

00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:12.060
or emergency medical people.

00:48:12.060 --> 00:48:15.410
So we, um, went into a situation.

00:48:15.410 --> 00:48:16.710
I went to Roxbury.

00:48:16.710 --> 00:48:18.010
I was in Roxbury, Massachusetts.

00:48:18.010 --> 00:48:22.440
I went back to Boston for the love
of a woman, which didn't work out.

00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:27.780
Um, and got called down
to the projects for, um,

00:48:27.780 --> 00:48:30.480
gunshot wound on the 7th floor.

00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:35.650
Well, the elevators weren't working
and we had to, uh, take a door off

00:48:35.650 --> 00:48:43.690
and put this -- large person
on the door and take her

00:48:43.690 --> 00:48:47.610
down seven floors while
people were shooting.

00:48:47.610 --> 00:48:52.000
And I thought, "You just came
back from two years of this stuff.

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:54.490
You didn't know why you were there.

00:48:54.490 --> 00:48:58.110
Now you're here in the
country of origin, OK,

00:48:58.110 --> 00:49:01.420
and you don't know
what's going on here."

00:49:01.420 --> 00:49:08.150 position:56%
So I fooled around a little bit
with anti-war groups, VVAW, uh, SDS,

00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:11.110
couple of other groups, and
decided the only way I could deal

00:49:11.110 --> 00:49:15.800
with things was to throw myself
into school, which I did.

00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:19.790
Um, that's how I dealt
with my stuff.

00:49:19.790 --> 00:49:28.220 position:56%
Um, participating in what we called
rap groups, we met in the libraries,

00:49:28.220 --> 00:49:30.420 position:56%
meeting rooms, we met in churches --

00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:34.960
church basements, at bars in
the back rooms where we talked

00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:37.370
about our common experiences

00:49:37.370 --> 00:49:39.890
because there were no
vet centers at the time.

00:49:39.890 --> 00:49:44.480
And, in fact, the current vet
center system as we know it came

00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:49.740
out of vets rap groups
started by Vietnam vets.

00:49:49.740 --> 00:49:54.600
In any case -- so I went -- I just
went threw myself into school and,

00:49:54.600 --> 00:49:58.190
um, got to the point I've got
more degrees than a thermometer.

00:49:58.190 --> 00:50:03.640
The point being that's how I
dealt with it and got interested

00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:10.260
in veterans issues as I thought
of them via my academic work.

00:50:10.260 --> 00:50:16.530
My last academic position,
I ran a little, um, center,

00:50:16.530 --> 00:50:20.800
a research center, and we studied
high risk behaviors including

00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:25.360
suicide and violence.

00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:30.980
Um, so that's how I
got from there to here.

00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:39.030
I think the courts are a
phenomenal -- phenomenal happening.

00:50:39.030 --> 00:50:41.930
And the word needs to be spread.

00:50:41.930 --> 00:50:48.140
I -- as some of my colleagues have
already said via their experience,

00:50:48.140 --> 00:50:51.230
um, it's incredible.

00:50:51.230 --> 00:50:55.370
One -- one story and then I'll
-- I'll shorten things up here.

00:50:55.370 --> 00:51:01.550
Uh, as part of them, um, white
book procedures, I spent some time

00:51:01.550 --> 00:51:07.030
out on the west coast in a veterans
court out there in Santa Ana,

00:51:07.030 --> 00:51:09.490
and so Santa Ana where
the courts located,

00:51:09.490 --> 00:51:12.710
it's not in a very
nice neighborhood.

00:51:12.710 --> 00:51:15.450
In fact, when I got there
and stuff they wanted know

00:51:15.450 --> 00:51:21.180
if I wanted an escort, um,
because I'd come in at like 7:30

00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:23.170
in the morning and
not leave until 7:30

00:51:23.170 --> 00:51:25.930
in the evening doing my
interviews and stuff.

00:51:25.930 --> 00:51:31.360 position:56%
But the most impressive things about
it was that a new judge had taken

00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:37.830
over in the vet court there, uh,
and he was trying to fill the shoes

00:51:37.830 --> 00:51:41.810
of someone who had big
shoes to fill in the vet --

00:51:41.810 --> 00:51:44.430
vet court treatment business.

00:51:44.430 --> 00:51:49.110
Um, and so when I walked
into his chambers,

00:51:49.110 --> 00:51:53.130 position:56%
here were all these books written by
veterans about veterans et cetera.

00:51:53.130 --> 00:51:54.430 position:56%
I thought, "Hey, that's pretty cool.

00:51:54.430 --> 00:51:55.730
He's trying to learn.

00:51:55.730 --> 00:51:57.030
He's not a veteran."

00:51:57.030 --> 00:52:01.780
But he had surrounded himself
with veterans as part of the --

00:52:01.780 --> 00:52:07.980
of the veteran treatment
court in Santa Ana.

00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:11.440
And then the most amazing
thing happened.

00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:12.770
They were talking about the docket.

00:52:12.770 --> 00:52:15.260
People on the docket for the day.

00:52:15.260 --> 00:52:19.720
And the judge looked at
me and he said, "Doc,

00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:21.890
would you mind staying around.

00:52:21.890 --> 00:52:24.900
I think maybe we'd like
your professional opinion."

00:52:24.900 --> 00:52:29.370
Now, I have some degrees
in mental health.

00:52:29.370 --> 00:52:31.090
So I said, "Sure."

00:52:31.090 --> 00:52:36.300
So I did. Now this was a very,
very, very, very serious case.

00:52:36.300 --> 00:52:39.240
We are talking pyromania here.

00:52:39.240 --> 00:52:43.930
Not only the individual,
but anything around him.

00:52:43.930 --> 00:52:48.360
OK? So the person really
needed help.

00:52:48.360 --> 00:52:54.570
So the discussion focused on how
can we best help this person,

00:52:54.570 --> 00:52:59.840
help this person who has this
really serious problem caused

00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:01.250
by his military service.

00:53:01.250 --> 00:53:06.940
He had TBI among -- very
serious TBI amongst other things.

00:53:06.940 --> 00:53:11.840
And I think, in my --
in my humble opinion,

00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:17.250
they did the best thing they
could and that is they put him

00:53:17.250 --> 00:53:21.190
in a supervised condition,
conditions --

00:53:21.190 --> 00:53:24.260
living conditions --
where he was monitored.

00:53:24.260 --> 00:53:25.960
Because if he would have
been on the outside --

00:53:25.960 --> 00:53:29.330 position:56%
he did want to live with his sister.

00:53:29.330 --> 00:53:32.060
But if he'd lived with his sister,
he'd've burned her house down

00:53:32.060 --> 00:53:36.080
and perhaps killed her
and her family as well.

00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:39.500
And I thought, "Wow.

00:53:39.500 --> 00:53:43.490
Wow." but it was thoroughly
discussed

00:53:43.490 --> 00:53:44.850
by all the members of the court.

00:53:44.850 --> 00:53:47.600
There was no acrimony involved,
"Well this guy did this.

00:53:47.600 --> 00:53:50.470
He's burned down houses
and this kind of thing and,

00:53:50.470 --> 00:53:53.240
you know, we need to lock him up."

00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:57.900
It was amazing -- an amazing,
um, event for me to --

00:53:57.900 --> 00:54:03.020
so I think the vet courts, as I
said earlier a few minutes ago,

00:54:03.020 --> 00:54:09.010
are the best thing that's happened
and I really appreciate, um --

00:54:09.010 --> 00:54:12.080
what some folks are doing now
is looking at when folks get

00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:18.160
out of the system and how we
get them back, um, into life.

00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:22.030
Because prison is a different life.

00:54:22.030 --> 00:54:26.160
Uh, but, in any case, it's the best
thing that's happened to veterans,

00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:30.410
um, since the VA was started
and we all know about the VA.

00:54:30.410 --> 00:54:34.650
But in any case, I'll turn it
over to this marine over here.

00:54:34.650 --> 00:54:35.950
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Elias: Bernie, thanks.

00:54:35.950 --> 00:54:37.660
Timothy Wynn is a veteran's
treatment court graduate.

00:54:37.660 --> 00:54:38.960
Welcome.

00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:40.260
&gt;&gt; Timothy Wynn: Thank you.

00:54:40.260 --> 00:54:41.560
Thanks, Doc.

00:54:41.560 --> 00:54:42.860
My name's Timothy Wynn.

00:54:42.860 --> 00:54:44.160
I'm from Philadelphia.

00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:46.700
I served in the greatest
fighting force known to mankind,

00:54:46.700 --> 00:54:48.000
the United States Marine Corps.

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:50.340
Um, I'm a little biased
I guess, right?

00:54:50.340 --> 00:54:51.640
&gt;&gt; Bernie Edelman: It's all right.

00:54:51.640 --> 00:54:53.380
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Elias: So all the Navy,
Army, Coasties, everybody else,

00:54:53.380 --> 00:54:56.710
Army, they're just -- they're
just going to take that.

00:54:56.710 --> 00:54:58.010
Right?

00:54:58.010 --> 00:54:59.310
&gt;&gt; Timothy Wynn: Yeah.

00:54:59.310 --> 00:55:02.900
Oorah. So -- no, but I, uh
-- I haven't written a book,

00:55:02.900 --> 00:55:05.530
but after today, I think
I may be looking to do

00:55:05.530 --> 00:55:08.850
that because I do have a story to
tell and I'm lucky enough to kind

00:55:08.850 --> 00:55:10.560
of go around and tell my story.

00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:14.360
Um, I graduated from the
Philadelphia Veterans Court

00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:16.160
and now I am the mentor coordinator

00:55:16.160 --> 00:55:18.380
in the same court that
I graduated from.

00:55:18.380 --> 00:55:21.120
I stick around there because
there's always a younger version

00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:23.340
of me coming through
the door every week.

00:55:23.340 --> 00:55:25.020
So I try to help them.

00:55:25.020 --> 00:55:26.490
I like to call it borrowed hope.

00:55:26.490 --> 00:55:28.600
I remember walking through the
door and not having any hope.

00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:30.790
And, um, you know,
people lend it to me.

00:55:30.790 --> 00:55:34.710
So I'm there to lend hope to the
veterans that are coming through.

00:55:34.710 --> 00:55:38.580
Um, I had seven arrests
before I ended

00:55:38.580 --> 00:55:40.480
up in the Philadelphia
Veterans Court.

00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:43.060
When I got into the
Philadelphia Veterans Court,

00:55:43.060 --> 00:55:44.360
that was my last arrest.

00:55:44.360 --> 00:55:45.660
I haven't been arrested since.

00:55:45.660 --> 00:55:48.610
I'm working on seven
years clean and sober.

00:55:48.610 --> 00:55:52.970
Um, it has absolutely changed
my life around to say the least.

00:55:52.970 --> 00:55:57.560
Um, I was housed in the
Philadelphia County Jail for a year

00:55:57.560 --> 00:56:01.060
of my life during, um,
several years of arrests

00:56:01.060 --> 00:56:03.830
and addiction and everything else.

00:56:03.830 --> 00:56:06.820
And, um, I am now in
that prison on Mondays

00:56:06.820 --> 00:56:10.070
and Fridays facilitating
trauma groups with the inmates

00:56:10.070 --> 00:56:12.340
who are locked up in
that same prison.

00:56:12.340 --> 00:56:15.900
Um, when I was in that
prison, there was nobody there.

00:56:15.900 --> 00:56:17.200
I was kind of by myself.

00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:20.200
Society really wasn't ready for
the veterans that were coming back

00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:22.140
from Iraq and Afghanistan.

00:56:22.140 --> 00:56:24.540
So it was a lonely time in my life.

00:56:24.540 --> 00:56:27.030
So I just make sure that I'm there
every week for those veterans

00:56:27.030 --> 00:56:29.170
that are behind a wall today.

00:56:29.170 --> 00:56:31.620
Um, and it's been a
rewarding process.

00:56:31.620 --> 00:56:34.620
Um, I just try to continue
to do this every single day

00:56:34.620 --> 00:56:35.920
and I'm lucky to be here.

00:56:35.920 --> 00:56:38.490
I'm lucky that I have
friends at Justice for Vets.

00:56:38.490 --> 00:56:40.480
That organization, I can't
say enough about them,

00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:43.790
what they do in this country
for veterans every single day.

00:56:43.790 --> 00:56:45.090
It's absolutely amazing.

00:56:45.090 --> 00:56:46.390
So, um, that's all I got.

00:56:46.390 --> 00:56:47.690
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Elias: All right.

00:56:47.690 --> 00:56:48.990
Good to have all of you here.

00:56:48.990 --> 00:56:52.220 position:56%
So it's important to point out, too,
if you're just new to the term PTSD

00:56:52.220 --> 00:56:54.460
or perhaps you don't really
understand how it works,

00:56:54.460 --> 00:56:57.700
if you have a common cold,
the symptoms are easy.

00:56:57.700 --> 00:56:59.000
You got fevers.

00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:00.300
You got chills.

00:57:00.300 --> 00:57:01.600
You stay in bed.

00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:02.900
You're weak.

00:57:02.900 --> 00:57:04.200
PTSD isn't so simple.

00:57:04.200 --> 00:57:06.060 position:56%
It doesn't have any kind of symptoms
that you necessarily can point to.

00:57:06.060 --> 00:57:08.750
In one individual it could be
severe, it could be chronic,

00:57:08.750 --> 00:57:10.300
it could be debilitating
to the point

00:57:10.300 --> 00:57:11.840
where they can't get out of bed.

00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:13.480
And in another, he'll
be fully functioning

00:57:13.480 --> 00:57:14.780
or she'll be fully functioning,

00:57:14.780 --> 00:57:16.610
but just in an instant
something happens.

00:57:16.610 --> 00:57:19.640
So you can't have a blanket
approach to treat PTSD.

00:57:19.640 --> 00:57:22.080
I'm sure all of you on stage
would agree with that as well.

00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:24.020
Judge, I wanted to
start with you, though.

00:57:24.020 --> 00:57:26.690
You talked about it a little
bit in your introduction.

00:57:26.690 --> 00:57:29.480
In most of the cases, what
percentage would you attach?

00:57:29.480 --> 00:57:32.530
For the folks that come before
your bench who are veterans,

00:57:32.530 --> 00:57:35.810
how many would you suspect would
not be before you had they not

00:57:35.810 --> 00:57:38.360
experienced what they
did in service?

00:57:38.360 --> 00:57:40.190
&gt;&gt; Vance Peterson: I'd
say as much as 80%.

00:57:40.190 --> 00:57:44.280
Again, these folks, the
patterns that we normally see,

00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:47.520
there's a progression after
somebody passes out of juvenile,

00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:49.750
goes into a young adulthood.

00:57:49.750 --> 00:57:53.260
And you can see a certain number
of criminal events that may occur.

00:57:53.260 --> 00:57:54.560 position:56%
And they may be light weight things.

00:57:54.560 --> 00:57:56.480
It could be just a driving
while license suspended.

00:57:56.480 --> 00:57:59.220
It could be a series of speeding
tickets or reckless driving,

00:57:59.220 --> 00:58:01.840
maybe a minor assault of some kind.

00:58:01.840 --> 00:58:06.150
But the pattern that we saw,
it wasn't like that at all.

00:58:06.150 --> 00:58:11.160
The instances generally occurred
after their tours of duty.

00:58:11.160 --> 00:58:13.600
And so I would easily
say it's probably 80%

00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:17.240
of them wouldn't have been in front
of us but for whatever happened

00:58:17.240 --> 00:58:18.700
to them during their deployments.

00:58:18.700 --> 00:58:20.550
&gt;&gt; Jonathon Elias: And
the courts or corrections,

00:58:20.550 --> 00:58:23.200
they always had one fit --
one size fits all approach

00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:24.920
to dealing with veterans.

00:58:24.920 --> 00:58:26.220
That's changed, though?

00:58:26.220 --> 00:58:27.520
&gt;&gt; Vance Peterson: That's
changed substantially.

00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:29.060
We've developed a number
of therapeutic courts.

00:58:29.060 --> 00:58:33.690
I was surprised to hear there's
3,000 some, um, mental --

00:58:33.690 --> 00:58:36.770
excuse me -- drug courts
in the nation today.

00:58:36.770 --> 00:58:39.350 position:56%
I know there's 330 veterans' courts.

00:58:39.350 --> 00:58:42.370 position:56%
And my push is that we should
probably have 3,000 veterans' courts

00:58:42.370 --> 00:58:45.150
because that's about
what we're going to need.

00:58:45.150 --> 00:58:47.040
The change, it's substantial.

00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:50.780
The veterans are given, I don't
want to say preferential treatment

00:58:50.780 --> 00:58:53.400 position:56%
because often times the probationary
requirements we put them

00:58:53.400 --> 00:58:55.810
on the veterans court is greater
than what they're going to have

00:58:55.810 --> 00:58:58.760 position:56%
to do if they just went to what I
call, or what we call, alpha courts,

00:58:58.760 --> 00:59:00.560
the straight criminal courts.

00:59:00.560 --> 00:59:04.410
Um, each individual defendant that
comes before us we normally spend

00:59:04.410 --> 00:59:06.490
about three times as much time

00:59:06.490 --> 00:59:08.720
on each individual
defendant just engaging them

00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:10.880
because that's important
to the process.

00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:15.170
But the idea throughout the staff
with the mentors that we have,

00:59:15.170 --> 00:59:18.630
with the mentor coordinator, the
-- the probation department folks,

00:59:18.630 --> 00:59:21.350
the idea is to get them
through the program,

00:59:21.350 --> 00:59:23.790
the make them succeed,
to -- to salvage them.

00:59:23.790 --> 00:59:26.880
We initially started it, we called
it a human salvage operation.

00:59:26.880 --> 00:59:30.650
Unlike the traditional alpha
courts where it's more process.

00:59:30.650 --> 00:59:33.280
You might have three
cases set for trial.

00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:34.580
They're all going to settle.

00:59:34.580 --> 00:59:37.680
Everybody has an agreement in terms
of recommendation of the sentence.

00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:39.410 position:56%
And you're done in about two minutes

00:59:39.410 --> 00:59:41.440
and you got two minutes
more for the next one.

00:59:41.440 --> 00:59:44.600 position:56%
Well, you spend a lot more time with
the veterans and it's important.

00:59:44.600 --> 00:59:45.980
&gt;&gt; Jonathon Elias: And by the
time they get to you, Greg,

00:59:45.980 --> 00:59:47.370
some would argue maybe
it's too late.

00:59:47.370 --> 00:59:49.920
When they end up in the correction
system, but that's not the case.

00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:51.650
And a lot of times when
you're dealing with PTSD --

00:59:51.650 --> 00:59:52.950
and as we just pointed
out -- it's --

00:59:52.950 --> 00:59:56.560
it's an individual by
individual case basis.

00:59:56.560 --> 00:59:59.960
Is there a switch inside every
single one of these people

00:59:59.960 --> 01:00:03.610 position:56%
that at some point you can get to or
hopefully get to, flick the switch

01:00:03.610 --> 01:00:07.330
and things will at least be maybe
put them on a more productive plan?

01:00:07.330 --> 01:00:08.630
&gt;&gt; Greg Crawford: I
think so, Jonathon.

01:00:08.630 --> 01:00:09.930
Um, if I could just
come back a second.

01:00:09.930 --> 01:00:12.980
When I was a probation
officer just after 9-11,

01:00:12.980 --> 01:00:15.230
I started in Pierce County,
which is just up the straight

01:00:15.230 --> 01:00:17.380
from Joint Base Lewis-McChord.

01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:20.670
We didn't have veteran's treatment
courts and, um, there wasn't a lot

01:00:20.670 --> 01:00:23.180
of veteran specific programming
in the justice system.

01:00:23.180 --> 01:00:26.470
And so, um, as you can imagine,
after the wars in Afghanistan

01:00:26.470 --> 01:00:28.410
and Iraq started and
folks started coming home,

01:00:28.410 --> 01:00:31.380
soldiers started coming home,
we started to see a large influx

01:00:31.380 --> 01:00:34.330
like you all did of veterans
in our justice system.

01:00:34.330 --> 01:00:36.620
And we didn't have
veteran's treatment courts.

01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:39.740
And so I was the domestic violence
officer and so they were there

01:00:39.740 --> 01:00:41.970
for a domestic violence charge
and that's what we supervised.

01:00:41.970 --> 01:00:44.520
We didn't touch the
underlying issues of, um,

01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:46.560
PTSD or TBI or anything like that.

01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:47.920
&gt;&gt; Jonathon Elias: And that's
the vast majority of the cases

01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:49.220
that come back when
you see them enter

01:00:49.220 --> 01:00:50.530
into the system as
domestic violence?

01:00:50.530 --> 01:00:52.030
&gt;&gt; Greg Crawford: At
least on my workload.

01:00:52.030 --> 01:00:57.100
Um, but -- but they
sit before me broken.

01:00:57.100 --> 01:01:00.340
Um, you know, essentially
their careers are ruined

01:01:00.340 --> 01:01:02.850
or they're either, you know,
a dishonorable or other

01:01:02.850 --> 01:01:04.970
than honorable or awaiting
discharge.

01:01:04.970 --> 01:01:06.430
Um, families wrecked.

01:01:06.430 --> 01:01:08.940
Um, they're just a shell
of their former self.

01:01:08.940 --> 01:01:12.080
And so that was before veteran's
treatment courts and now,

01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:16.360
since 2008, we -- we've got a
330 with, I would say, you know,

01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:18.840
nearly 100 in various stages
of planning and implementation.

01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:21.120
They're catching fire
across the country.

01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:22.460 position:56%
And what they're doing is they're --

01:01:22.460 --> 01:01:25.740
they're digging deep besides
the charge at hand and Judge --

01:01:25.740 --> 01:01:29.140
General Tate talked about
that holistic approach, um,

01:01:29.140 --> 01:01:30.660
to -- to treating veterans.

01:01:30.660 --> 01:01:32.250
And, um, that -- that works.

01:01:32.250 --> 01:01:34.250
Um, and I have -- I have a
colleague -- I won't name --

01:01:34.250 --> 01:01:37.930
say his name, but he said
after a couple of months he was

01:01:37.930 --> 01:01:40.300
in with denial about, you know,

01:01:40.300 --> 01:01:41.750
committing to a veterans
treatment court.

01:01:41.750 --> 01:01:44.260
And after a while it just
clicked and he just felt

01:01:44.260 --> 01:01:46.460 position:56%
like he had a sense of purpose back.

01:01:46.460 --> 01:01:49.160
Um, so, to me, I think these
veterans treatment courts are

01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:51.990
getting at those underlying
issues and, at some point,

01:01:51.990 --> 01:01:54.320
especially the value of
the veteran peer mentor,

01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:55.970
and kind of helping
walk them -- you know --

01:01:55.970 --> 01:01:58.460
walking them through the system
and providing that support,

01:01:58.460 --> 01:02:00.720
at some point, they get it.

01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:02.680 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Elias: Tim, you'd be the
best one to answer this question too

01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:04.310
because you came through
the program.

01:02:04.310 --> 01:02:07.870
At what point did that switch go
off for you where you realized,

01:02:07.870 --> 01:02:10.130
you know what, that's not
the life I want to lead

01:02:10.130 --> 01:02:12.800
and you know the path
where it leads to?

01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:14.100
When did the switch go off?

01:02:14.100 --> 01:02:15.830
What resource was made
available to you

01:02:15.830 --> 01:02:18.700
to enable you to flick that switch?

01:02:18.700 --> 01:02:20.510
&gt;&gt; Timothy Wynn: I think the
changing moment for me was

01:02:20.510 --> 01:02:23.020
when I was in the mental health
unit in the bowels of the prison.

01:02:23.020 --> 01:02:28.530
And, um, they kept giving me
medication and I was just done

01:02:28.530 --> 01:02:29.830
with medication at this point.

01:02:29.830 --> 01:02:32.990
I had gotten so much
medication from the VA and I --

01:02:32.990 --> 01:02:36.530
I'd abused them and I just was
tired of feeling like that.

01:02:36.530 --> 01:02:38.050
I felt vulnerable in population

01:02:38.050 --> 01:02:40.130
and I didn't want to
take any more pills.

01:02:40.130 --> 01:02:43.920 position:56%
And I was arguing with a lady in the
bowels of the prison who was going

01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:46.150
to give me more of these pills.

01:02:46.150 --> 01:02:50.720
And the door slowly slid
open and in walks a man

01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:53.000
who I had no idea who he was.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:54.700
Um, and he says to
the lady, he says, um,

01:02:54.700 --> 01:02:58.450
"Can I just have a
couple minutes with him?"

01:02:58.450 --> 01:03:03.440
And she got up, left, and
he sat down and, you know,

01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:05.170
he wasn't a therapist,
he wasn't, you know,

01:03:05.170 --> 01:03:07.800
licensed to treat PTSD
or nothing like that.

01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:10.640
But what he was a Vietnam veteran.

01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:14.530
And that's the first time I was
introduced to peer-to-peer support.

01:03:14.530 --> 01:03:16.160
And I'll never forget
what he said to me.

01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:22.060
He said, "That person you were
before you left is gone forever.

01:03:22.060 --> 01:03:23.960
That person is gone.

01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:25.260
He's never coming back.

01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:26.560 position:56%
You're a changed person and you need

01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:28.860
to find different ways
to combat this."

01:03:28.860 --> 01:03:34.270
And I think the first time I heard
that was the first time I realized

01:03:34.270 --> 01:03:36.160
that I had to surrender to win.

01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:40.330
See, because surrender
is not in our vocabulary.

01:03:40.330 --> 01:03:43.160
You know? But it's a very
hard thing to accept.

01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:44.930
And, um, from that
point on I started

01:03:44.930 --> 01:03:46.640
to kind of turn my life around.

01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:49.320
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Elias: Is there any
part of you before you went off

01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:51.770
to combat that's still alive?

01:03:51.770 --> 01:03:53.200
Like when you go home and
you see an old friend?

01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:55.440
Because I -- I saw that video
and the guy said, you know,

01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:57.980
"All my friends had changed,"
and, you know, we're all sitting

01:03:57.980 --> 01:03:59.980
in this room as educated
folks and we're saying, "No.

01:03:59.980 --> 01:04:01.280
No. No. No.

01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:02.580
You changed.

01:04:02.580 --> 01:04:03.880
They're all exactly the same."

01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:05.180
&gt;&gt; Timothy Wynn: Yeah.

01:04:05.180 --> 01:04:06.480
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Elias: That's why they
say you can never go home again

01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:07.780
because those who leave are
the ones who evolve or change

01:04:07.780 --> 01:04:09.860
or become different and then
they go back expecting everything

01:04:09.860 --> 01:04:12.480
to be the same and it's
not because they're not.

01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:13.780
&gt;&gt; Timothy Wynn: Yeah.

01:04:13.780 --> 01:04:15.080
It's definitely not the same.

01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:17.240 position:56%
I remember coming home and not being
able to really talk to anybody.

01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:20.080
Um, you know, I can't talk
to, you know, my mother.

01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:22.030
My own mother, I can't talk
to my next-door neighbor.

01:04:22.030 --> 01:04:23.330
Um --

01:04:23.330 --> 01:04:24.880
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Elias: Because
they just wouldn't understand?

01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:26.180
&gt;&gt; Timothy Wynn: Yeah.

01:04:26.180 --> 01:04:27.480
And it's not their fault.

01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:28.780
You know? They wouldn't
understand because they --

01:04:28.780 --> 01:04:30.080
they didn't go through it.

01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:31.380
And that's OK.

01:04:31.380 --> 01:04:33.550
Um, that's why I think peer-to-peer
support is so important,

01:04:33.550 --> 01:04:34.850
um, when it comes to this.

01:04:34.850 --> 01:04:38.070
You know how Doc talked about, you
know, sitting in those rap groups.

01:04:38.070 --> 01:04:41.060
You know, myself and my friend,
Robert Shipper, who's here today,

01:04:41.060 --> 01:04:44.740
you know, we have our own rap
groups every Monday night, um,

01:04:44.740 --> 01:04:46.040
in our community with veterans.

01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:48.820
So that's the most important thing
to me is peer-to-peer support

01:04:48.820 --> 01:04:50.120
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Elias: And
it's interesting too.

01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:54.140
You came back from a war where
you have a civilian population

01:04:54.140 --> 01:04:55.970
that embraces our veterans.

01:04:55.970 --> 01:04:57.270
You know, they have parades.

01:04:57.270 --> 01:04:59.090
They don't -- they
get a treatment --

01:04:59.090 --> 01:05:00.640
the red carpet treatment,
if you will.

01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:01.940
&gt;&gt; Timothy Wynn: Mm-hmm.

01:05:01.940 --> 01:05:03.240
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Elias: But, I
mean, let's just face it,

01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:04.540
the military does a
lot of things right.

01:05:04.540 --> 01:05:06.480
What they're not very good
at is transitioning warriors

01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:10.460 position:56%
from a warrior mentality or ethos
into a civilian based ethos because,

01:05:10.460 --> 01:05:11.760
again, that's an impossible --

01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:15.070
that's like going from a NASCAR
doing 210 in the fast lane to jump

01:05:15.070 --> 01:05:16.700 position:56%
into a Prius going 20 miles an hour.

01:05:16.700 --> 01:05:18.710
It's an impossible transition.

01:05:18.710 --> 01:05:20.420
And that -- and, Doc , I
wanted to bring you guys

01:05:20.420 --> 01:05:24.150 position:56%
in because you came back from a very
unpopular war where you either had

01:05:24.150 --> 01:05:26.940
to bury the fact that you
served or at least kind

01:05:26.940 --> 01:05:28.990 position:56%
of protect the fact of what you did.

01:05:28.990 --> 01:05:30.290
&gt;&gt; Tom Berger: Right.

01:05:30.290 --> 01:05:38.120 position:56%
The story, I came back, uh, I was
in, um, St. Louis airport and I'm --

01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:40.840
I'm honored as a Navy corpsman.

01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:44.450
I wear the Marine -- I can
wear the Marine green uniform.

01:05:44.450 --> 01:05:46.930
OK? There's a special
band on the sleeve

01:05:46.930 --> 01:05:50.790 position:56%
that distinguishes me as a corpsman.

01:05:50.790 --> 01:05:56.430 position:56%
So I had my medals on and stuff, or
ribbons on, and walked up to the bar

01:05:56.430 --> 01:05:59.630
in the airport and ordered a drink.

01:05:59.630 --> 01:06:03.240
Uh, had a few anyway
on the airplane.

01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:06.560
Uh, in any case, there was a guy
at the bar looks at my uniform

01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:09.480
and he said, "How many
babies did you kill?"

01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:13.890
And before I could hit him
with the beer bottle, OK?

01:06:13.890 --> 01:06:17.490
The bartender grabbed this guy
and threw him out of the bar.

01:06:17.490 --> 01:06:20.150
That's my first experience
coming back.

01:06:20.150 --> 01:06:22.960
Now the guy was probably sloshed
and -- and the whole business,

01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:25.550
but that was my reaction.

01:06:25.550 --> 01:06:26.850
All right?

01:06:26.850 --> 01:06:31.000
And then not being able
to go places in uniform

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:36.820
because people would really --
let's just say really rude to you.

01:06:36.820 --> 01:06:40.280
OK? With language we didn't
even use in the Corps.

01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:45.670
OK? Um, but Tim's exactly right.

01:06:45.670 --> 01:06:49.590
When you come back,
it's so different.

01:06:49.590 --> 01:06:50.890
It's so different.

01:06:50.890 --> 01:06:55.230
And nobody knows how to
deal with you because of it.

01:06:55.230 --> 01:06:59.550
I appreciate -- I appreciate
what the country --

01:06:59.550 --> 01:07:02.220
how it values it's veterans,

01:07:02.220 --> 01:07:07.150
but they need to understand
war changes people.

01:07:07.150 --> 01:07:09.330
It changes people.

01:07:09.330 --> 01:07:14.140
And so it's not just, "Thank
you for your service."

01:07:14.140 --> 01:07:15.640
It's, "Welcome home."

01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:19.970
And there's a big difference
between those two phrases.

01:07:22.490 --> 01:07:24.790
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Elias: Your experience?

01:07:27.450 --> 01:07:32.260
&gt;&gt; Bernie Edelman: Well, two years
ago I went to the first reunion

01:07:32.260 --> 01:07:36.430
of my college fraternity
of more than 30 years.

01:07:36.430 --> 01:07:42.190
There were about 50 of us in this
really nice Italian restaurant

01:07:42.190 --> 01:07:44.720
in New York City, in Manhattan.

01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:51.970
Uh, and these are good guys,
guys I was friends with.

01:07:51.970 --> 01:07:54.010
They're lawyers.

01:07:54.010 --> 01:07:58.280
They're doctors, dentists,
college professors.

01:07:58.280 --> 01:08:03.940
And of the 50 there were four of
us who served in some capacity

01:08:03.940 --> 01:08:05.780
or other in the military.

01:08:05.780 --> 01:08:10.080
One, a lawyer friend of mine,
was in the National Guard.

01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:14.620
Another guy, he was
an 11 Bravo, a grunt,

01:08:14.620 --> 01:08:16.290 position:56%
but they didn't send him to Vietnam.

01:08:16.290 --> 01:08:18.600
They sent him to Germany.

01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:23.220
Third guy did not want to get
drafted so he thought he was smart.

01:08:23.220 --> 01:08:27.600
He joined the Air Force
and wound up in Thailand

01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:32.310
where he lost his best friend
and lost a lot of other guys.

01:08:32.310 --> 01:08:40.590
And it -- there was, to me,
a kind of barrier, in a way,

01:08:40.590 --> 01:08:44.230
between me and these other fellows.

01:08:44.230 --> 01:08:45.530
Good guys.

01:08:45.530 --> 01:08:47.680
You know? Successful guys.

01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:52.540
The people I'm most
comfortable around are veterans.

01:08:52.540 --> 01:08:58.590
Uh, and I know when I came home --

01:08:59.660 --> 01:09:05.620 position:56%
it's something that you didn't
necessarily talk about, but I was --

01:09:05.620 --> 01:09:10.700
like Doc -- I was a little bit
angry at what had been going on.

01:09:10.700 --> 01:09:12.870
I was there in 1970.

01:09:12.870 --> 01:09:16.790
We were doing the so-called
phased withdrawal.

01:09:16.790 --> 01:09:21.740
I couldn't see logically why
American troops were still going

01:09:21.740 --> 01:09:24.340
out on combat missions and dying.

01:09:24.340 --> 01:09:28.560
Um, so I protested the war.

01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:32.960
Came down here in the big
anti-war demonstration called Dewey

01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:35.150
Canyon III.

01:09:35.150 --> 01:09:42.290
And it was the first time since
the bonus marches in 1932,

01:09:42.290 --> 01:09:47.810
I believe it was, who came to
Washington to say, "Look at us.

01:09:47.810 --> 01:09:52.410
Get out of Vietnam, uh, now."

01:09:52.410 --> 01:09:55.120
Um, and I think it had an effect.

01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:57.330
I certainly hope it had an effect.

01:09:57.330 --> 01:10:02.220
But there was certainly
in me and I know in a lot

01:10:02.220 --> 01:10:06.930
of other folks the sense of
alienation, uh, in coming home.

01:10:06.930 --> 01:10:09.030
And I was not a combatant.

01:10:09.030 --> 01:10:11.770
Uh, when I was there, I
had top secret clearance.

01:10:11.770 --> 01:10:13.130
I could travel around.

01:10:13.130 --> 01:10:17.220
I spent a lot of time with
the 91st Evacuation Hospital

01:10:17.220 --> 01:10:20.930
up in a place called Chu Lai,
uh, with the docs and the nurses.

01:10:20.930 --> 01:10:28.070 position:56%
Saw as much as of the, uh,
debasement and the debris of war as,

01:10:28.070 --> 01:10:30.330
you know, most grunts did.

01:10:30.330 --> 01:10:35.490
And, you know -- and, as
Doc said, it changes you

01:10:35.490 --> 01:10:40.080
and unless you're there, you
really can't understand even

01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:44.130
if you watch the best war
movies that were ever made.

01:10:44.130 --> 01:10:46.090 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Elias: Let's talk about,
for a second, identifying some

01:10:46.090 --> 01:10:47.640
of the telltale signs of PTSD.

01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:50.080
It's always helpful if you're
going to try and tackle a problem

01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:52.260
to at least understand the
problem you're up against.

01:10:52.260 --> 01:10:55.720 position:56%
From my understand, from my
experience from talking to veterans,

01:10:55.720 --> 01:10:58.650
alcohol, drug use, those
are about as common

01:10:58.650 --> 01:11:01.310
across the board telltale
signs you're going to have

01:11:01.310 --> 01:11:03.960
because of either withdrawal
or escapism.

01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:07.170
Um, maybe not being
able to socialize.

01:11:07.170 --> 01:11:09.500
They'll be in a social setting
that, back when they were perhaps

01:11:09.500 --> 01:11:11.750
in their home town maybe
with some high school buddies

01:11:11.750 --> 01:11:13.980
and they just start yacking
about a football game,

01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:16.810
they feel out of place,
they don't contribute.

01:11:16.810 --> 01:11:20.350
Give me some other strong telltale
songs for anybody perhaps watching

01:11:20.350 --> 01:11:21.650
or anybody in the audience

01:11:21.650 --> 01:11:23.210
that maybe they have a loved
one that's going through this

01:11:23.210 --> 01:11:24.510
and they want to make
sure that they can

01:11:24.510 --> 01:11:27.040
at least identify what
it is they're up against?

01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:30.270
&gt;&gt; Tom Berger: Hyperarousal
certainly is one of

01:11:30.270 --> 01:11:31.780
and I'll bet every combat vet

01:11:31.780 --> 01:11:35.100
in this room knows exactly
what I'm talking about.

01:11:35.100 --> 01:11:36.540
It happened to me this morning.

01:11:36.540 --> 01:11:43.250
A colleague -- now I place
my desk so it faces the door.

01:11:43.250 --> 01:11:48.410
Now most, you know, um, office
management things says, "Well,

01:11:48.410 --> 01:11:51.370
that's kind of -- put it
to the side or whatever."

01:11:51.370 --> 01:11:55.720
I can't do that because even
with my desk facing the doorway,

01:11:55.720 --> 01:11:59.550
if I'm focused on reading something
or whatever and somebody just says,

01:11:59.550 --> 01:12:02.790
"Hi, Doc," it scares the
you know what out of me.

01:12:02.790 --> 01:12:06.070
And that can happen anywhere.

01:12:06.070 --> 01:12:10.150
If I'm focused on something
and people call my name

01:12:10.150 --> 01:12:13.440
or I hear a loud noise,
something like that,

01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:15.250
that's certainly a problem.

01:12:15.250 --> 01:12:20.770
The other thing has been mentioned
earlier in the conversation, uh,

01:12:20.770 --> 01:12:23.470
nightmares and flashbacks.

01:12:23.470 --> 01:12:26.940
And those are two different things.

01:12:26.940 --> 01:12:29.440
OK, you have nightmares
when you sleep at night.

01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:32.820
And they may be the same nightmare.

01:12:32.820 --> 01:12:40.660
Flashbacks happen any time and you
are back there because trauma is --

01:12:40.660 --> 01:12:42.430
and particularly severe trauma --

01:12:42.430 --> 01:12:46.710
can change the circuitry of
the brain so that certain --

01:12:46.710 --> 01:12:53.130
want to call them, uh -- uh --
triggers, will put you right back

01:12:53.130 --> 01:12:58.440
where a particular
traumatic event occurred.

01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:00.210
So those are a couple of other --

01:13:00.210 --> 01:13:01.510
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Elias: Does --
let me ask you this too.

01:13:01.510 --> 01:13:03.510
It's 42 years since
the end of the war.

01:13:03.510 --> 01:13:04.810
Have -- has in subsided?

01:13:04.810 --> 01:13:06.110
Has it gotten easier?

01:13:06.110 --> 01:13:08.640
Has it -- has it kind of freed
you a little bit, or is it right

01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:10.720
at the forefront as
it's always been?

01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:12.660
&gt;&gt; Tom Berger: Um,
there are a couple of --

01:13:12.660 --> 01:13:17.770
I don't want to go back to
Vietnam despite all the, uh,

01:13:17.770 --> 01:13:22.610
overtures in friendship and
Vietnam Veterans of America,

01:13:22.610 --> 01:13:24.780
where I work, has led the way.

01:13:24.780 --> 01:13:28.210
We have, um, a veteran's
initiative, which we can talk

01:13:28.210 --> 01:13:29.560
about another time another place.

01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:33.710
Uh, I don't want to go back
there because I am afraid

01:13:33.710 --> 01:13:38.800
that it will bring back stuff
that I've had to deal with, uh,

01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:41.760
through therapy and
through rap groups and stuff

01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:44.230 position:56%
and I don't want through that again.

01:13:44.230 --> 01:13:49.890
But I do have a couple of recurring
nightmares that I can't seem

01:13:49.890 --> 01:13:54.590
to get rid of and they were
pretty traumatic situations.

01:13:54.590 --> 01:13:56.510
So -- but they come
back and it's usually

01:13:56.510 --> 01:13:58.860
when I'm -- I'm stressed out.

01:13:58.860 --> 01:14:00.160
OK?

01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:01.460
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Elias: Tim?

01:14:01.460 --> 01:14:03.670
&gt;&gt; Timothy Wynn: I think anger is,
uh, a main one speaking for myself.

01:14:03.670 --> 01:14:04.970
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Elias:
You explode quickly?

01:14:04.970 --> 01:14:06.270
&gt;&gt; Timothy Wynn: Absolutely.

01:14:06.270 --> 01:14:10.360
You know, I've obviously found ways
to, uh, you know, combat that, um,

01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:12.950
you know, through group
therapy and stuff like that.

01:14:12.950 --> 01:14:14.250
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Elias: Now
let me ask you this.

01:14:14.250 --> 01:14:16.550 position:56%
The loved ones around you before
they knew what they were up against,

01:14:16.550 --> 01:14:18.730
were they just saying, "You know
what, he's got a hairpin trigger.

01:14:18.730 --> 01:14:20.030
That's just how he's always been?"

01:14:20.030 --> 01:14:23.390 position:56%
They try and rationalize away the
behavior not to try to cope with it?

01:14:23.390 --> 01:14:24.690
&gt;&gt; Timothy Wynn: Yeah.

01:14:24.690 --> 01:14:25.990
I mean, they didn't really
understand it, like I said earlier.

01:14:25.990 --> 01:14:28.650
They just kind of thought,
like, uh, you know --

01:14:28.650 --> 01:14:30.160
they knew something
was wrong, but, again,

01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:31.460
they didn't know what was wrong.

01:14:31.460 --> 01:14:32.760
They didn't know what
they were looking at.

01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:34.580
They didn't know what
they were facing.

01:14:34.580 --> 01:14:37.870
And, you know, anger, I think
it stems from, you know,

01:14:37.870 --> 01:14:40.540
when you come back you have these
-- this sort of -- like I --

01:14:40.540 --> 01:14:42.960
I call it like your standing
in the shallows of the ocean

01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:44.790
and that wave just
keeps hitting you.

01:14:44.790 --> 01:14:47.680
And it's a wave of these
emotions that keeps coming.

01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:50.230
You you've never felt this
stuff before so you get angry.

01:14:50.230 --> 01:14:52.320
You get angry because you can't
navigate through your day.

01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:54.150
You can't be that social person.

01:14:54.150 --> 01:14:57.160
You can't go hang out with the guys
and talk about the football game.

01:14:57.160 --> 01:15:01.740
You know? You would rather isolate
-- at least this is what I did.

01:15:01.740 --> 01:15:03.040
I isolated.

01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:05.530
I used drugs and alcohol because
they're 100% effective every time.

01:15:05.530 --> 01:15:08.110
They numb all those emotions.

01:15:08.110 --> 01:15:09.410
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Elias:
You know, we've --

01:15:09.410 --> 01:15:11.630
as a nation, we've been at it
for 240 years and we've been

01:15:11.630 --> 01:15:13.360
at war a lot of that time.

01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:15.670
And, you know, all throughout the
generations from the Civil War

01:15:15.670 --> 01:15:17.920
to World War II, they would call it
shell shock or they just call it,

01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:19.220
"Oh, he's being quiet," whatever.

01:15:19.220 --> 01:15:22.020
I mean, now we call it PTSD because
we've identified it as a problem.

01:15:22.020 --> 01:15:25.000
But this is a problem that has
plagued our returning warriors

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.210
since we've been at
it in the battlefield.

01:15:27.210 --> 01:15:29.240
And, you know, Judge, I'm just
curious, some of the things

01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:30.790
that you have seen, because
I'm sure you had a lot

01:15:30.790 --> 01:15:33.330
of cases come before you
where you have telltale signs

01:15:33.330 --> 01:15:35.250
that run from A to Z on this one.

01:15:35.250 --> 01:15:38.440
&gt;&gt; Greg Crawford: All -- all of the
substance abuse issues are there,

01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:40.830 position:56%
of course, and a lot of times
that's just a reaction to the anger.

01:15:40.830 --> 01:15:43.780
I think that the -- really
the underlying current

01:15:43.780 --> 01:15:47.270
that affects the most is
-- is just plain anger.

01:15:47.270 --> 01:15:50.490
You know, I remember as we're
getting ready to climb on a C-17

01:15:50.490 --> 01:15:54.980 position:56%
to leave Afghanistan after that time
some of the younger folks, again,

01:15:54.980 --> 01:15:59.740
these young 11-B infantry
troopers, you know, "Gosh, we --

01:15:59.740 --> 01:16:03.000
we went to Afghanistan and the rest
of the country went to Walmart."

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:04.990
It's almost a resentment
that -- that --

01:16:04.990 --> 01:16:07.880
that when you get back you kind of
resent the fact that you get there.

01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:12.000 position:56%
And, of course, on the return of
the Iraq and the Afghan guys that --

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.100
it's much different
from the Vietnam era.

01:16:14.100 --> 01:16:17.860
You -- you hear, you know,
"Thank you for your service," um,

01:16:17.860 --> 01:16:21.420
an awful lot and I have to admit,
yeah, I was angry when I got back.

01:16:21.420 --> 01:16:24.310
I -- the Army was still pretty bad

01:16:24.310 --> 01:16:26.190
about how they handled
you when you came back.

01:16:26.190 --> 01:16:28.490 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Elias: But -- let me ask
you -- all of you -- do you think --

01:16:28.490 --> 01:16:32.490
because the military spends
gazillions of dollars on everything

01:16:32.490 --> 01:16:35.960
from perfecting the ways
of killing people to trying

01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:38.990
to understand the warriors
to artificial intelligence.

01:16:38.990 --> 01:16:42.090
I'm just curious, is there
any kind of mechanism

01:16:42.090 --> 01:16:44.880
that anyone could provide
to ready them

01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:46.180
for what they're really
going to experience?

01:16:46.180 --> 01:16:49.030
I know they train them for combat,
but training somebody for combat

01:16:49.030 --> 01:16:52.220
and experiencing and living through
combat, totally different things.

01:16:52.220 --> 01:16:54.680
&gt;&gt; Tom Berger: Well, one of
the things is -- and it's --

01:16:54.680 --> 01:16:57.500
it's spot on what you just said.

01:16:57.500 --> 01:17:01.410
They train you for
situations that threaten you,

01:17:01.410 --> 01:17:06.320
that put you in a sense
of danger and you react.

01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:10.460
And if you follow that training,
chances are you're going

01:17:10.460 --> 01:17:13.100
to make it through that situation.

01:17:13.100 --> 01:17:18.940
When you come home, OK, you have to
go back to the old way of thinking,

01:17:18.940 --> 01:17:24.510
which is just because
Fido pooped on the floor,

01:17:24.510 --> 01:17:27.880
that is not a life
threatening situation.

01:17:27.880 --> 01:17:32.290
But, OK, you react that way.

01:17:32.290 --> 01:17:37.600 position:56%
And is one of the things they should
consider, in my humble opinion,

01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:41.480
and Canada did it for a while
and the UK did it for a while,

01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:47.360
is they put their troops in
sort of a -- a decompression.

01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:50.850
I believe it was the UK --
or was it the Canadians --

01:17:50.850 --> 01:17:53.090
had a place on Cypress.

01:17:53.090 --> 01:17:56.890
OK? And some cases there were,
you know, married couples

01:17:56.890 --> 01:18:02.280
and stuff could -- and they
helped them decompress, um,

01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:05.380
as sort of like a post-service
boot camp.

01:18:05.380 --> 01:18:10.620 position:56%
Now whether that would get a lot of
support down the street, um, or not,

01:18:10.620 --> 01:18:12.980
you know, that's -- that's
neither here nor there.

01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:19.310
But we could do something better
on the end of it to get us back

01:18:19.310 --> 01:18:21.920
in terms of the transition system.

01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:23.220
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Elias: Please.

01:18:23.220 --> 01:18:26.060
&gt;&gt; Greg Crawford: So, you know, I
work for [inaudible] and my job is

01:18:26.060 --> 01:18:28.990
to really identify gaps, you
know, and throughout the continuum

01:18:28.990 --> 01:18:32.530
of criminal justice to improve
outcomes for veterans and one

01:18:32.530 --> 01:18:35.970
of the interviews I was conducting,
uh, with a veteran, um --

01:18:35.970 --> 01:18:38.990 position:56%
you know, he said, "They trained me,
you know, to go to basic training.

01:18:38.990 --> 01:18:40.310
They trained me to
go to my first duty.

01:18:40.310 --> 01:18:43.300 position:56%
They trained me to go to combat, but
they didn't train me to come home."

01:18:43.300 --> 01:18:45.650
And I think that that's
a real gap in our system.

01:18:45.650 --> 01:18:48.200
I always, um -- couple
-- couple points.

01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:53.240 position:56%
One, um, we need to reduce the
stigma for soldiers to ask for help.

01:18:53.240 --> 01:18:55.620
We need to do a better
job of helping them.

01:18:55.620 --> 01:18:59.140
And I think that why does the
first opportunity to intervene

01:18:59.140 --> 01:19:01.440
in their life have to be
the criminal justice system?

01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:04.620
I think that if we can do, uh --
I think there's specific funding

01:19:04.620 --> 01:19:08.810
with DOD to, um, you know, to
train people, to pay for uniforms,

01:19:08.810 --> 01:19:10.610
to, um, you know, travel.

01:19:10.610 --> 01:19:13.820
But there's no specific
funding to come home

01:19:13.820 --> 01:19:15.770
and to help them acclimate home.

01:19:15.770 --> 01:19:19.290
And I think that that's a real
gap, um, that we need to address.

01:19:19.290 --> 01:19:20.590
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Elias: Let
me just -- go ahead.

01:19:20.590 --> 01:19:22.530
&gt;&gt; Tom Berger: And I think
there's a real problem also.

01:19:22.530 --> 01:19:26.650
The military has changed, although,
it's still defect in a lot of ways

01:19:26.650 --> 01:19:29.590
like it was in World War II.

01:19:29.590 --> 01:19:31.760
I say this because I've
done some clinical work

01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:35.930
with Delta Force people
and -- and SEALs.

01:19:35.930 --> 01:19:37.540
Some said it earlier.

01:19:37.540 --> 01:19:41.620
Most Americans don't appreciate
the tempo of operations,

01:19:41.620 --> 01:19:44.820
um, over in the big sandbox.

01:19:44.820 --> 01:19:48.110
It's -- I mean, heavy duty intense.

01:19:48.110 --> 01:19:52.540
The general -- the general and, uh,
my colleague sitting next to me,

01:19:52.540 --> 01:19:54.700
the judge, will tell
you what it's like.

01:19:54.700 --> 01:19:59.250
But the fact of the matter
is that these folks are

01:19:59.250 --> 01:20:02.670
under such intense --
particularly in our --

01:20:02.670 --> 01:20:04.730
in our special ops groups --

01:20:04.730 --> 01:20:11.140 position:56%
are under such intense pressure that
life back here is not very realistic

01:20:11.140 --> 01:20:13.260
to them when they come home.

01:20:13.260 --> 01:20:15.410
They try and adjust.

01:20:15.410 --> 01:20:20.010
OK? But why do so many of
our special ops people feel

01:20:20.010 --> 01:20:22.350
that they're more at
home back there?

01:20:22.350 --> 01:20:25.320
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Elias: Let me
ask this question, too,

01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:28.310
because I know we live in an ADD
society and I don't mean to use

01:20:28.310 --> 01:20:31.870 position:56%
that term pejoratively, but I think
it's true that you walk around today

01:20:31.870 --> 01:20:34.430 position:56%
and you'll see nine out of 10 people
walking around with their phones.

01:20:34.430 --> 01:20:35.750
They're connected to
I don't know what.

01:20:35.750 --> 01:20:38.000
I mean, maybe there's a
text they can't go without

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:41.500
or a headline they can't go
without, but folks who are warriors

01:20:41.500 --> 01:20:44.830
who have been in combat -- and
I've heard this probably 99%

01:20:44.830 --> 01:20:47.210
of the time -- for
them time stands still.

01:20:47.210 --> 01:20:48.510
Time slows down.

01:20:48.510 --> 01:20:51.530
The continuum just absolutely
comes to a grinding halt.

01:20:51.530 --> 01:20:54.070
And when they come home they feel
as though the world is running

01:20:54.070 --> 01:20:57.140
by them 1,000 miles an hour
and they're stuck in a spot

01:20:57.140 --> 01:21:00.050
where they just need
somebody to talk to.

01:21:00.050 --> 01:21:02.960
So now let's get into the resources
because we have the veterans court,

01:21:02.960 --> 01:21:05.930
which is a system that
has started to spread,

01:21:05.930 --> 01:21:07.500 position:56%
but certainly could grow a lot more.

01:21:07.500 --> 01:21:12.170 position:56%
But what are the resources available
to people especially with PTSD

01:21:12.170 --> 01:21:14.950
and TBIs coming home that
they could reach out to

01:21:14.950 --> 01:21:16.250
that would help their experience?

01:21:16.250 --> 01:21:18.460
Because we have folks that,
you know, are watching on TV

01:21:18.460 --> 01:21:20.920
and perhaps they're sitting there
saying, "I didn't get out of bed

01:21:20.920 --> 01:21:22.400
until 11 O'clock this morning.

01:21:22.400 --> 01:21:24.740
I don't know why I'd
want to get out of bed."

01:21:24.740 --> 01:21:26.480 position:56%
What resource can they reach out to?

01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:27.840
Because there's a lot of them.

01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:29.270
&gt;&gt; Tom Berger: There are a lot.

01:21:29.270 --> 01:21:32.110
Um, lots of good community.

01:21:32.110 --> 01:21:35.200
I would, uh, say for those --

01:21:35.200 --> 01:21:40.600
and we know that because of
all the media surrounding a lot

01:21:40.600 --> 01:21:41.900
of the problems with the VA,

01:21:41.900 --> 01:21:45.840
they don't trust the VA
hospitals for whatever reason.

01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:47.440
The Vet Centers.

01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:49.210
Try the Vet Centers!

01:21:49.210 --> 01:21:56.170
Because they are the most cost
efficient mental health operation

01:21:56.170 --> 01:21:57.470
in the VA system.

01:21:57.470 --> 01:21:59.200
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Elias: And they -- and
all they have to do is just walk in

01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:00.820
and say, "I just need
someone to talk to."

01:22:00.820 --> 01:22:02.120
They don't have to
fill out the paperwork

01:22:02.120 --> 01:22:03.420
and go through the red tape.

01:22:03.420 --> 01:22:04.720
&gt;&gt; Tom Berger: Right.

01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:07.430
Your mental health information
that you choose to share

01:22:07.430 --> 01:22:09.680
at a Vet Center doesn't go

01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:13.550
to the mothership unless
you sign a consent.

01:22:13.550 --> 01:22:17.840
OK? And, for those vet centers
that have the resources,

01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:21.450
meaning the money and the people,
they also can work with families.

01:22:21.450 --> 01:22:26.050
And that's a big deal
because the big hospitals

01:22:26.050 --> 01:22:27.840 position:56%
and stuff aren't allowed to do that.

01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:30.640
There are some programs and
kinds of -- but the vet centers,

01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:32.380
I highly recommend the vet centers.

01:22:32.380 --> 01:22:35.670
And a lot of the team leaders,
what they call the director

01:22:35.670 --> 01:22:39.170
at vet centers, are
combat veterans themselves.

01:22:39.170 --> 01:22:43.650
And that's what made it such
a success that 10 years ago,

01:22:43.650 --> 01:22:48.100
15 years ago I guess now because
we've been in this latest morass

01:22:48.100 --> 01:22:52.080
for that long, most of the
team leaders were combat

01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:54.010
Vietnam veterans.

01:22:54.010 --> 01:22:55.350
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Elias: Bernie?

01:22:55.350 --> 01:23:00.320 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Bernie Edelman: There are 330 or
so VTCs, veteran's treatment courts.

01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:05.260
There are exactly 300 Vet
Centers, but they're located mostly

01:23:05.260 --> 01:23:10.340 position:56%
in cities, uh, in strip malls, uh --

01:23:10.340 --> 01:23:12.900
there should be twice
that number at least.

01:23:12.900 --> 01:23:16.400
That's where resources need to go.

01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:24.220
Uh, but it's also -- we depend upon
the VA to -- and the government --

01:23:24.220 --> 01:23:28.630
to help those who are
several combat wounded, uh,

01:23:28.630 --> 01:23:33.660
to help them fiscally,
physically, mentally.

01:23:33.660 --> 01:23:39.750
Spiritually, you have to depend
on the community that you live in.

01:23:39.750 --> 01:23:45.150
And a lot of Americans
prefer not to deal with that.

01:23:45.150 --> 01:23:46.920
Stop and think about this.

01:23:46.920 --> 01:23:51.120
In the Second World War when the
population of this country was

01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:55.930
about 130,000,000 or so,
16,000,000 Americans,

01:23:55.930 --> 01:23:59.080
men and women, were in uniform.

01:23:59.080 --> 01:24:02.230
Just about everyone in the
country was somehow involved

01:24:02.230 --> 01:24:03.530
in the war effort.

01:24:03.530 --> 01:24:05.940
I don't know what the
numbers were for Korea.

01:24:05.940 --> 01:24:08.740
In Vietnam it had shrunk
to something

01:24:08.740 --> 01:24:12.530
like 9%, some people said 4%.

01:24:12.530 --> 01:24:19.000
Right now less than 1/5
of 1% of Americans --

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:22.100
now we're not talking about
5 year old children --

01:24:22.100 --> 01:24:28.620
but of Americans I guess 18 or
above serve in the military.

01:24:28.620 --> 01:24:32.420
This is a tiny number.

01:24:32.420 --> 01:24:33.800
People go through college.

01:24:33.800 --> 01:24:36.700
They don't have to worry about
being drafted or anything.

01:24:36.700 --> 01:24:40.500
When we were in school, that
was, you know, one of the things

01:24:40.500 --> 01:24:45.390
that kept us in school as
long as we had the grades.

01:24:45.390 --> 01:24:48.580
But people come home and a lot

01:24:48.580 --> 01:24:53.060
of times there's something
missing in community.

01:24:53.060 --> 01:24:58.690
Uh, which is tragic and it
leads to more [inaudible].

01:24:58.690 --> 01:25:03.110
People aren't welcomed home into
the bosom of a grateful nation

01:25:03.110 --> 01:25:08.110
because too often the nation is
not grateful for a war without end.

01:25:08.110 --> 01:25:10.330
And that's what we had in Vietnam.

01:25:10.330 --> 01:25:11.680
That's what we have now.

01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:12.980
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Elias: Is it a --

01:25:12.980 --> 01:25:15.150
&gt;&gt; Melissa Fitzgerald:
There's a veterans crisis line

01:25:15.150 --> 01:25:16.450
if you wouldn't mind
giving out that number.

01:25:16.450 --> 01:25:17.750
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Elias: Sure.

01:25:17.750 --> 01:25:21.360
Um, the Veterans Crisis Line is
another resource you can turn to.

01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:25.230
It's 1-800-273-8255.

01:25:25.230 --> 01:25:27.690
And then when you call that
number you can just press 1.

01:25:27.690 --> 01:25:28.990
&gt;&gt; Tom Berger: Press 1.

01:25:28.990 --> 01:25:30.290
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Elias:
Tim, let me go to you

01:25:30.290 --> 01:25:32.490 position:56%
because you came back from this war.

01:25:32.490 --> 01:25:35.700
And you had said -- "Hope"
was the word you used.

01:25:35.700 --> 01:25:38.740
Um, the veterans that I talked
to coming back from this war,

01:25:38.740 --> 01:25:42.290 position:56%
they seemed to think that the people
at home, while they're grateful

01:25:42.290 --> 01:25:45.160
for their service, they don't
understand what their service

01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:46.460
was for.

01:25:46.460 --> 01:25:49.130
And then the translation to you is
then, "What the hell was I doing?"

01:25:49.130 --> 01:25:51.850
Is that a part of what you
processed or are still processing?

01:25:51.850 --> 01:25:55.660 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Timothy Wynn: I think for a short
period of time I went through that.

01:25:55.660 --> 01:25:57.300
Not so much now.

01:25:57.300 --> 01:26:02.840
Um, to me, what I did over there
was standing shoulder-to-shoulder

01:26:02.840 --> 01:26:05.990
with my brothers and
sisters in arms.

01:26:05.990 --> 01:26:07.970
You know, we -- we did
what we had to do to get

01:26:07.970 --> 01:26:10.370
through every single day
to protect one another.

01:26:10.370 --> 01:26:13.310
And, you know, I don't get to
far into it as far as, you know,

01:26:13.310 --> 01:26:15.180
political why we did what we did.

01:26:15.180 --> 01:26:16.480
Um, that's not my concern.

01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:20.080
My concern then was protecting the
people to the right and the left

01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:22.000
of me and that still stands today.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:23.680
That's what I do here
in my community.

01:26:23.680 --> 01:26:26.030
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Elias: Did you have
a clearly defined objective

01:26:26.030 --> 01:26:28.730
as a warrior in battle?

01:26:28.730 --> 01:26:31.010
Did you understand day-to-day
what it is you were trying

01:26:31.010 --> 01:26:32.810
to do or accomplish?

01:26:32.810 --> 01:26:34.110
&gt;&gt; Timothy Wynn: Yes.

01:26:34.110 --> 01:26:35.990
You know, I, uh -- I had --

01:26:35.990 --> 01:26:40.700
I was a sergeant and my job was to
protect the people underneath me.

01:26:40.700 --> 01:26:43.840
And that was my main
objective every single day.

01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:46.460
Um, I ran convoys over there.

01:26:46.460 --> 01:26:48.730
I was a 50 Cal gunner
on top of a Humvee.

01:26:48.730 --> 01:26:51.500
My objective was to get the
people in that convoy from point A

01:26:51.500 --> 01:26:55.410
to point B -- point A to point
B. That was my projective.

01:26:55.410 --> 01:26:59.070
Um, there are also good
people in the country

01:26:59.070 --> 01:27:01.830
of Iraq who need protection.

01:27:01.830 --> 01:27:04.130
And we protected them as well.

01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:09.750
&gt;&gt; Bernie Edelman: Bob Birdnow
[assumed spelling] is here

01:27:09.750 --> 01:27:11.600
in the audience.

01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:14.590
Bob comes from Quincy,
Massachusetts.

01:27:14.590 --> 01:27:22.100
Um, for the past several
years he and I, his wife,

01:27:22.100 --> 01:27:26.800
couple of other folks, have gone
up to Quincy at the end of April

01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:31.790
for a ceremony, United
Combat Veterans of Quincy,

01:27:31.790 --> 01:27:35.210
95% of whom served
in the Marine Corps.

01:27:35.210 --> 01:27:36.510
Talk about brotherhood.

01:27:36.510 --> 01:27:37.820
There you have it.

01:27:37.820 --> 01:27:44.380
Uh, it used to be a handful of guys
would go down to this clock tower,

01:27:44.380 --> 01:27:50.320
uh, which had the names inscribed
on it of 45 of Quincy's --

01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:53.590
the sons of Quincy who died
during the Vietnam War.

01:27:53.590 --> 01:27:56.490
They'd read the names
and then they would go

01:27:56.490 --> 01:28:00.320
to this fairly awful
Chinese restaurant, uh,

01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:04.160
but there was a certain
loyalty there.

01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:12.660 position:56%
When they added Bob's brother's name
to the -- the roster of the dead,

01:28:12.660 --> 01:28:16.410
uh, things I think
started to change.

01:28:16.410 --> 01:28:20.800
You had a situation where more
and more people started, uh --

01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:26.310
resident -- a son of Quincy, rather
-- came to give you keynote speech.

01:28:26.310 --> 01:28:32.190
Here you have a situation where the
community embraces those who served

01:28:32.190 --> 01:28:34.670
and tries to help them heal.

01:28:34.670 --> 01:28:39.440
It's a small part of the community,
but it's always, it seems,

01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:42.630
veterans helping veterans.

01:28:42.630 --> 01:28:46.920
Those who didn't serve, you
don't get it the same way.

01:28:46.920 --> 01:28:48.290
A lot of veterans -- a lot

01:28:48.290 --> 01:28:50.960
of non-veterans will
say, "Welcome home."

01:28:50.960 --> 01:28:52.260
That's nice.

01:28:52.260 --> 01:28:53.560
"Thank you for your service."

01:28:53.560 --> 01:28:54.860
That's nice.

01:28:54.860 --> 01:28:57.270
But they don't understand it.

01:28:57.270 --> 01:29:01.430
When a veteran says that to
someone who's come back, it has --

01:29:01.430 --> 01:29:03.350
it's a different context almost.

01:29:03.350 --> 01:29:10.210
And in Quincy, it's an
example of what I think a lot

01:29:10.210 --> 01:29:14.520
of other communities can
do and should do not only

01:29:14.520 --> 01:29:17.920
for the younger guys,
but for all veterans.

01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:19.830
You know, a lot of the
veteran's treatment courts,

01:29:19.830 --> 01:29:24.360
there are more Vietnam era
veterans than there are Iraq

01:29:24.360 --> 01:29:25.810
and Afghanistan veterans.

01:29:25.810 --> 01:29:27.110
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Elias: Right.

01:29:27.110 --> 01:29:28.410
&gt;&gt; Bernie Edelman: When
you were mentioning, uh --

01:29:28.410 --> 01:29:34.210
uh, or in the film clip we saw, 22
veterans commit suicide every day.

01:29:34.210 --> 01:29:35.510
&gt;&gt; Tom Berger: Twenty.

01:29:35.510 --> 01:29:36.810 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Bernie Edelman: It said 22 there.

01:29:36.810 --> 01:29:38.110
But --

01:29:38.110 --> 01:29:39.410
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Elias: Even
one a day is too much.

01:29:39.410 --> 01:29:40.710
&gt;&gt; Tom Berger: Correct!

01:29:40.710 --> 01:29:44.890
&gt;&gt; Bernie Edelman: Something like
70% of those veterans are age 55 --

01:29:44.890 --> 01:29:46.190
&gt;&gt; Tom Berger: And older.

01:29:46.190 --> 01:29:47.490
&gt;&gt; Bernie Edelman: Or older.

01:29:47.490 --> 01:29:49.800
They're not the young
people who came back.

01:29:49.800 --> 01:29:51.770
The connotation was, "Here,

01:29:51.770 --> 01:29:55.500
look at these damaged people
who've -- who are coming home."

01:29:55.500 --> 01:29:57.480
A lot of the people
who are among that --

01:29:57.480 --> 01:29:58.780
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Elias: Well, one

01:29:58.780 --> 01:30:01.370 position:56%
of the largest homeless
populations right now in our country

01:30:01.370 --> 01:30:03.540
of veterans is the Vietnam War.

01:30:03.540 --> 01:30:04.840
&gt;&gt; Bernie Edelman: Oh, yeah.

01:30:04.840 --> 01:30:07.690
&gt;&gt; Tom Berger: And -- and --
excuse me -- I would argue --

01:30:07.690 --> 01:30:11.370
here's a discussion point,
OK, because not all of you are

01:30:11.370 --> 01:30:14.020
in the audience and are veterans.

01:30:14.020 --> 01:30:19.530 position:56%
What Bernie said about the
veterans in the community is fine --

01:30:19.530 --> 01:30:23.270
to draw veterans together.

01:30:23.270 --> 01:30:27.880
What I would say is instead
of having veterans night

01:30:27.880 --> 01:30:34.130
at the ballpark, take the
resources that are used to do that,

01:30:34.130 --> 01:30:39.930 position:56%
make sure that your community mental
health office is not only open 24/7

01:30:39.930 --> 01:30:43.050
several days a week, but
is staffed with somebody

01:30:43.050 --> 01:30:48.910
that can handle military
PTSD , or MST .

01:30:48.910 --> 01:30:53.820 position:56%
That is something that the community
can do to help our veterans.

01:30:53.820 --> 01:30:55.120
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Elias: Greg,
let me ask you this.

01:30:55.120 --> 01:30:57.690 position:56%
Especially now we're talking about
resources that may be tightening up.

01:30:57.690 --> 01:31:00.320
Budgets may be changing and
there may not be as much money

01:31:00.320 --> 01:31:02.300
to help fund some of the
programs that are currently there.

01:31:02.300 --> 01:31:03.600
What can people do?

01:31:03.600 --> 01:31:05.680
And I especially want to
deal with folks in rural --

01:31:05.680 --> 01:31:07.870
I'm from a small town
outside of California.

01:31:07.870 --> 01:31:11.880
I know in those communities a lot
of our population ended up going

01:31:11.880 --> 01:31:13.440
in enlisting into the militaries.

01:31:13.440 --> 01:31:15.680
So what do folks in
rural communities do?

01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:18.990 position:56%
How do they deal with returning
warriors who are having these issues

01:31:18.990 --> 01:31:21.450
who become somewhat isolated,
who perhaps maybe turn

01:31:21.450 --> 01:31:23.120
to drugs or alcohol as an escape?

01:31:23.120 --> 01:31:24.420
What do you do for them?

01:31:24.420 --> 01:31:26.840 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Greg Crawford: Well, I think, um,
number one, the National Institute

01:31:26.840 --> 01:31:29.180
of Corrections provides training
and technical assistance.

01:31:29.180 --> 01:31:30.940
So if your jurisdictional
out there is looking

01:31:30.940 --> 01:31:33.540
to implement a veterans
treatment court program, um,

01:31:33.540 --> 01:31:38.350
they can contact NIC, uh,
at NICIC.gov and, you know,

01:31:38.350 --> 01:31:40.680 position:56%
give us a call and we can talk about
what your issues are and whether

01:31:40.680 --> 01:31:42.550
or not you want to start
a veterans treatment court

01:31:42.550 --> 01:31:45.870
or some other specific programming
either in a jail or a prison.

01:31:45.870 --> 01:31:50.110
Um -- or they can contact
Justice for Vets, uh,

01:31:50.110 --> 01:31:53.700
or there's grants available, um,
through the Federal Government.

01:31:53.700 --> 01:31:57.870
Um, but what I would say is you
have to understand your population.

01:31:57.870 --> 01:31:59.770
And I think data drives
a lot of decisions

01:31:59.770 --> 01:32:01.340
in our jurisdictions
across the country.

01:32:01.340 --> 01:32:05.050
So if you can figure out how many
veterans you have in your jail

01:32:05.050 --> 01:32:08.640
or on your probation caseloads,
I think that that could help lead

01:32:08.640 --> 01:32:12.090
to -- you know -- warranting a
program in your jurisdiction.

01:32:12.090 --> 01:32:13.940
Then don't just ask,
"Are you a veteran?"

01:32:13.940 --> 01:32:16.260
because sometimes they
think you are only a veteran

01:32:16.260 --> 01:32:17.560
if you serve in combat.

01:32:17.560 --> 01:32:18.950
You have to say, "Have you
served in the military?"

01:32:18.950 --> 01:32:20.900
That's the key question to ask.

01:32:20.900 --> 01:32:23.770
And so once you've justified your
programming, a lot of times --

01:32:23.770 --> 01:32:25.600
and Judge Peterson, I think
you can speak to this --

01:32:25.600 --> 01:32:28.600
you can create something
with the exciting resources.

01:32:28.600 --> 01:32:30.130
Um, I don't know if you want to --

01:32:30.130 --> 01:32:31.430
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Elias: Yeah.

01:32:31.430 --> 01:32:34.110
I -- I -- I'm dying to know like
right now if we had 5,000 judges

01:32:34.110 --> 01:32:36.250
from across the country that are
just sitting here watching this,

01:32:36.250 --> 01:32:40.280
what would you tell them about how
things should at least be modified

01:32:40.280 --> 01:32:42.840
in order to deal with the growing
population of returning vets

01:32:42.840 --> 01:32:44.920
who may be dealing with
some of these issues?

01:32:44.920 --> 01:32:46.250
&gt;&gt; Vance Peterson: Well,
I'd tell them first,

01:32:46.250 --> 01:32:48.360
"You're going to prosecute
these guys anyway.

01:32:48.360 --> 01:32:50.280
You're -- you're going
to prosecute them.

01:32:50.280 --> 01:32:51.580
You're going to defend them.

01:32:51.580 --> 01:32:52.880
They're going to be charged.

01:32:52.880 --> 01:32:54.180
They're going to have a
probation officer involved.

01:32:54.180 --> 01:32:56.960
You're going to have a court
-- court clerk pull the file.

01:32:56.960 --> 01:32:59.230
Why don't you put them
all on the same docket?

01:32:59.230 --> 01:33:02.400
It doesn't cost you
any more to do that.

01:33:02.400 --> 01:33:06.210
And, from that, then you can
develop a veteran's court docket.

01:33:06.210 --> 01:33:08.940
And then you can start
looking into local resources."

01:33:08.940 --> 01:33:11.510
At one point in time I
remember talking to Judge Russel

01:33:11.510 --> 01:33:15.030
and there was a -- a concern
about making cookie cutter courts,

01:33:15.030 --> 01:33:16.930
all the veterans courts
would look alike.

01:33:16.930 --> 01:33:19.970
The reality was that every
jurisdiction is different.

01:33:19.970 --> 01:33:21.620
Everybody has a different
group of veterans.

01:33:21.620 --> 01:33:24.480
In Lewiston, Idaho,
90% of their veterans

01:33:24.480 --> 01:33:26.240
in veteran's courts are marines.

01:33:26.240 --> 01:33:29.420
In our jurisdiction
it's about 60% Army,

01:33:29.420 --> 01:33:31.560
although we have an Air Force base.

01:33:31.560 --> 01:33:34.320
Some courts will handle
felony level events.

01:33:34.320 --> 01:33:36.280
Some courts will only
handle misdemeanor events.

01:33:36.280 --> 01:33:38.520
Some folks do a combination.

01:33:38.520 --> 01:33:42.090
But you can do this -- you can put
these programs together and set

01:33:42.090 --> 01:33:44.160
up a docket and it
doesn't cost you anything.

01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:45.890
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Elias: You're talking
about making resources available

01:33:45.890 --> 01:33:48.030
so that they're going to be charged
with their crime and they're going

01:33:48.030 --> 01:33:50.580
through the judicial system,
but, at the same time,

01:33:50.580 --> 01:33:52.530
you're going to have
a peer one-on-one

01:33:52.530 --> 01:33:53.970
with a vet talking to these folks?

01:33:53.970 --> 01:33:57.420 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Vance Peterson: And each one of
the courts has a mentor type system.

01:33:57.420 --> 01:34:00.410
Each one of the courts has
developed their own particularized

01:34:00.410 --> 01:34:01.710
mentor system.

01:34:01.710 --> 01:34:04.600
We developed a forum and the
forum meets once a month.

01:34:04.600 --> 01:34:09.470 position:56%
Every veteran is basically sentenced
to attend 12 -- or six forums.

01:34:09.470 --> 01:34:11.690
They're given 24 months
of probation,

01:34:11.690 --> 01:34:14.070
you attend six forums,
it's only 18 months.

01:34:14.070 --> 01:34:16.550
You lose a month of probation
every time you attend a forum.

01:34:16.550 --> 01:34:18.780
If you attend 12 forums,
you're done.

01:34:18.780 --> 01:34:20.370
So the incentive is
to come to the forum.

01:34:20.370 --> 01:34:22.490
At the forum we feed them.

01:34:22.490 --> 01:34:23.940
We give them a dinner.

01:34:23.940 --> 01:34:28.360
Then we have them -- there are set
up a bunch of different resources,

01:34:28.360 --> 01:34:31.340
community resources for child
support, department of licensing

01:34:31.340 --> 01:34:34.610
for driver's licenses,
landlord tenant attorneys.

01:34:34.610 --> 01:34:38.040
We put every resource available
to a veteran in one room.

01:34:38.040 --> 01:34:39.950
After they're done going
through the resource portion,

01:34:39.950 --> 01:34:42.820
they go through two, one
hour group therapy sessions.

01:34:42.820 --> 01:34:47.290
And with that, um, they then get
through the program in 12 months --

01:34:47.290 --> 01:34:48.590
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Elias:
And let me stop you.

01:34:48.590 --> 01:34:49.910
And a lot of these resources
you're talking about,

01:34:49.910 --> 01:34:52.080
in most cases it's a phone
call because they'd be willing

01:34:52.080 --> 01:34:54.810
to volunteer their time and service
because of who we're talking about,

01:34:54.810 --> 01:34:56.110
the population we're talking about?

01:34:56.110 --> 01:34:57.410
&gt;&gt; Vance Peterson: Yes.

01:34:57.410 --> 01:34:58.710
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Elias:
Greg, you had something?

01:34:58.710 --> 01:35:00.010
&gt;&gt; Greg Crawford: Yeah.

01:35:00.010 --> 01:35:01.310
I want to -- I want to say
a couple different things.

01:35:01.310 --> 01:35:02.610
Number one, um, you can look
at Veteran Treatment Courts,

01:35:02.610 --> 01:35:03.910
A Second Chance for Vets.

01:35:03.910 --> 01:35:05.480
There's a lot of information
about how to start a court

01:35:05.480 --> 01:35:07.690
or the right questions
to ask your jurisdiction.

01:35:07.690 --> 01:35:09.920
Um, but also you can
contact Justice for Vets.

01:35:09.920 --> 01:35:11.560
They have four mentor courts.

01:35:11.560 --> 01:35:14.070
You can make a request to
actually take a team onsite

01:35:14.070 --> 01:35:18.080
and go see what's going on
and -- and view that court.

01:35:18.080 --> 01:35:19.380
&gt;&gt; Melissa Fitzgerald: Yeah.

01:35:19.380 --> 01:35:20.690
If you're a jurisdiction and you're
interested in any way setting

01:35:20.690 --> 01:35:23.630
up a veteran's treatment court,
please go to our website.

01:35:23.630 --> 01:35:27.790
There's a tremendous amount of
information at JusticeforVets.org.

01:35:27.790 --> 01:35:29.090
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Elias:
Let me -- hold on.

01:35:29.090 --> 01:35:30.390
Let me do this real quick.

01:35:30.390 --> 01:35:34.210
Tim, when you came back -- the goal
with PTSD is first diagnosis it,

01:35:34.210 --> 01:35:37.020 position:56%
figuring out what you're up against,
and then intervening as quickly

01:35:37.020 --> 01:35:39.710
as possible so that you can
intercept that from turning

01:35:39.710 --> 01:35:43.840
into really bad decisions and
ultimately trying to determine

01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:45.910
if somebody's going to
go out there and act out,

01:35:45.910 --> 01:35:47.780
which could be committing crimes.

01:35:47.780 --> 01:35:49.160
What would have been in one thing

01:35:49.160 --> 01:35:52.300
that could have intercepted you
immediately coming back from combat

01:35:52.300 --> 01:35:54.940
that would have helped immensely?

01:35:54.940 --> 01:35:56.240
&gt;&gt; Timothy Wynn: A veteran's court.

01:35:56.240 --> 01:35:57.540
No doubt.

01:35:57.540 --> 01:35:58.840
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Elias:
A veteran's court?

01:35:58.840 --> 01:36:00.140
&gt;&gt; Timothy Wynn: No
doubt in my mind.

01:36:00.140 --> 01:36:01.440
If I were to land in veteran's
court with my first arrest,

01:36:01.440 --> 01:36:02.740
I wouldn't have had seven arrests,

01:36:02.740 --> 01:36:04.210
I wouldn't have spent a
year of my life in prison.

01:36:04.210 --> 01:36:05.960
I wouldn't have not be
in my daughter's life

01:36:05.960 --> 01:36:07.260
for the first four
years of her life.

01:36:07.260 --> 01:36:09.550
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Elias: You needed
a vet to look you in the eye

01:36:09.550 --> 01:36:11.870
and tell you you're a changed man
and you need to get over that,

01:36:11.870 --> 01:36:13.170
you need to figure this out?

01:36:13.170 --> 01:36:14.470
&gt;&gt; Timothy Wynn: Absolutely.

01:36:14.470 --> 01:36:15.770
And I need a room where
I can walk into

01:36:15.770 --> 01:36:17.600
and all the resources
are right there.

01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:21.500
A lot of people are perplexed at
veteran's courts, you know, work.

01:36:21.500 --> 01:36:23.520
They say, you know, "How
is this even possible

01:36:23.520 --> 01:36:25.360 position:56%
and doesn't it cost a ton of money?"

01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:27.240
And in reality it's one day a week.

01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:28.900
It's one judge.

01:36:28.900 --> 01:36:30.310
It's one courtroom.

01:36:30.310 --> 01:36:35.450 position:56%
It's one staff for one day per week,
but the impact is unbelievable.

01:36:35.450 --> 01:36:37.000
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Elias: And
they're speaking your language?

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:38.300
&gt;&gt; Timothy Wynn: They're
speaking my language.

01:36:38.300 --> 01:36:39.890
I walk into that room,
I can get everything

01:36:39.890 --> 01:36:41.850
that I need all in one room.

01:36:41.850 --> 01:36:44.790
And that's something that
you can't get anywhere else.

01:36:44.790 --> 01:36:47.580
&gt;&gt; Bernie Edelman: There's
something even before all that.

01:36:47.580 --> 01:36:53.030
If somebody commits a
crime, the first people

01:36:53.030 --> 01:36:55.370
in the criminal justice
system that they're going

01:36:55.370 --> 01:36:59.020
to come across are the police.

01:36:59.020 --> 01:37:03.110
On the Justice Involved Veterans
Network, there's one gentleman,

01:37:03.110 --> 01:37:06.510
Captain Blair Myhand of
Apex, North Carolina.

01:37:06.510 --> 01:37:07.810
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Elias: Now Chief.

01:37:07.810 --> 01:37:09.110
&gt;&gt; Bernie Edelman: Now -- OK.

01:37:09.110 --> 01:37:10.410
That I didn't know.

01:37:10.410 --> 01:37:15.310
And what he does is he takes
a couple of vets who are

01:37:15.310 --> 01:37:22.920
on the police force and trains
them in how to deal with a crisis

01:37:22.920 --> 01:37:24.790
if somebody is a veteran.

01:37:24.790 --> 01:37:29.680
And if they know the person's a
veteran because the spouse tells,

01:37:29.680 --> 01:37:35.530
uh, the first officers, these guys
come and they know what to say,

01:37:35.530 --> 01:37:40.970 position:56%
they know how to bring somebody down
from the crisis she's in or he's in.

01:37:40.970 --> 01:37:46.160 position:56%
He also does this training for other
police departments I think twice

01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:47.460
a year.

01:37:47.460 --> 01:37:52.350
But the police have a greater
role that they can play

01:37:52.350 --> 01:37:56.950
and it's not going on as -- nearly
as much as I think it ought to.

01:37:56.950 --> 01:37:58.740
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Elias: Is it fair
to say that a barrier right now

01:37:58.740 --> 01:38:01.230
that exists is -- especially
with law enforcement,

01:38:01.230 --> 01:38:03.810
because I know a lot of my
friends who are police officers

01:38:03.810 --> 01:38:06.190
and they tend to give the benefit
of the doubt to a returning vet

01:38:06.190 --> 01:38:07.490
if they're caught up in something.

01:38:07.490 --> 01:38:09.140
They kind of will pat
them on the back and go,

01:38:09.140 --> 01:38:10.640
"Come on, man, don't do this."

01:38:10.640 --> 01:38:14.650
Is that doing them a favor
or is that hurting them?

01:38:14.650 --> 01:38:16.290
Because you're basically in denial.

01:38:16.290 --> 01:38:17.590
You're just saying, "You're a vet,

01:38:17.590 --> 01:38:19.330
I'm going to cut you
some slack here."

01:38:19.330 --> 01:38:20.630
&gt;&gt; Timothy Wynn: Yeah.

01:38:20.630 --> 01:38:21.930
It's -- in my opinion, it's
definitely hurting them.

01:38:21.930 --> 01:38:23.230
And I've been cut breaks.

01:38:23.230 --> 01:38:24.530
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Elias: It's
just kicking the can.

01:38:24.530 --> 01:38:25.830
&gt;&gt; Timothy Wynn: Yeah.

01:38:25.830 --> 01:38:27.130
Basically.

01:38:27.130 --> 01:38:28.450
Um, but one of the most
important things at my job now is

01:38:28.450 --> 01:38:31.260
to do crisis intervention training
with the local police department.

01:38:31.260 --> 01:38:33.020
I go up to the Philadelphia
Police Department.

01:38:33.020 --> 01:38:36.100
I go over to Camden, New
Jersey, and I tell my story.

01:38:36.100 --> 01:38:39.460
And I tell them flat out, you
know, the best thing to happen

01:38:39.460 --> 01:38:44.190
to me was getting that final arrest
and not getting let go that day

01:38:44.190 --> 01:38:46.650
and actually getting put
in a veteran's court.

01:38:46.650 --> 01:38:48.330
It absolutely changed my life.

01:38:48.330 --> 01:38:54.640
I educate the police on PTSD, uh,
TBI, you know, domestic violence,

01:38:54.640 --> 01:38:56.650 position:56%
which is very high amongst veterans.

01:38:56.650 --> 01:38:58.670
Um, and I tell my story.

01:38:58.670 --> 01:39:01.930 position:56%
And it really strikes home with
them because, at the end of the day,

01:39:01.930 --> 01:39:04.130
they're the first responders,
they're the ones out on the streets

01:39:04.130 --> 01:39:06.760
that are coming in contact
with these veterans.

01:39:06.760 --> 01:39:10.150
The ones that are out there buying
heroin, getting in bar fights,

01:39:10.150 --> 01:39:12.740
stuff like that, they're the
ones showing up on the scene

01:39:12.740 --> 01:39:14.780
and the decision that they make

01:39:14.780 --> 01:39:19.940
that day could absolutely change
their life, um, for the better.

01:39:19.940 --> 01:39:23.220
Getting arrested is not the worst
thing that can happen to a vet.

01:39:23.220 --> 01:39:24.520
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Elias: Go ahead, Greg.

01:39:24.520 --> 01:39:26.050
&gt;&gt; Greg Crawford: It can be kicking
the can down the road, but it --

01:39:26.050 --> 01:39:27.620
unless you know, you know,
what -- what you're doing.

01:39:27.620 --> 01:39:29.380
You have to understand your
resources in the community

01:39:29.380 --> 01:39:31.120
and you have to be
willing to make a referral.

01:39:31.120 --> 01:39:34.220
Um, I think some of the things
that we're working on at NIC

01:39:34.220 --> 01:39:35.870
and in our partnership
with some of the folks

01:39:35.870 --> 01:39:37.610
up here are a couple things.

01:39:37.610 --> 01:39:41.540
Real quick is increasing what they
call the responsivity issues have

01:39:41.540 --> 01:39:46.640
veterans, looking at developing
training around military culture,

01:39:46.640 --> 01:39:49.440
um, issues transitioning from
military to civilian life,

01:39:49.440 --> 01:39:51.080
the underlying issues
of PTSD, and TBI.

01:39:51.080 --> 01:39:53.240
NIC is working on this curriculum

01:39:53.240 --> 01:39:54.540
with the Center for
Court Innovation.

01:39:54.540 --> 01:39:56.300
We hope to pilot test this in FY-18

01:39:56.300 --> 01:39:57.640
and make this available
to the field.

01:39:57.640 --> 01:40:01.070 position:56%
But in addition to that the National
Institute of Corrections partnered

01:40:01.070 --> 01:40:04.220
with the Bureau of Justice
Assistance, um, and the Center

01:40:04.220 --> 01:40:07.750
for Court Innovation to develop
the first set of screening tools

01:40:07.750 --> 01:40:10.050
that factors in the
complexities of war trauma.

01:40:10.050 --> 01:40:12.740
So there's a comprehensive tool
and a case planning protocol

01:40:12.740 --> 01:40:14.560
that will help guide veterans
treatment courts on how

01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:17.040
to best serve the veterans
in their justice system.

01:40:17.040 --> 01:40:18.340
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Elias: OK.

01:40:18.340 --> 01:40:20.040
Well, we just have a few
minutes left for the panel.

01:40:20.040 --> 01:40:22.250
What I wanted to do was just
get some closing remarks,

01:40:22.250 --> 01:40:24.650
if you can keep them brief though,
if we can just go down the line.

01:40:24.650 --> 01:40:26.810
And I -- I guess for me, what I
want to kind of hear at the end,

01:40:26.810 --> 01:40:29.370 position:56%
and I'm sure maybe some of the folks
in the audience here too, is --

01:40:29.370 --> 01:40:31.340
is there a hopeful
message to pass on?

01:40:31.340 --> 01:40:34.810
What is it that you hope will
happen in the years to come as --

01:40:34.810 --> 01:40:36.320
and we've already identified
the problem?

01:40:36.320 --> 01:40:38.450
Obviously we're a nation
of liking to fix problems.

01:40:38.450 --> 01:40:39.750
So what's your hope?

01:40:39.750 --> 01:40:41.090
We'll start with you
Tim, from the end.

01:40:41.090 --> 01:40:42.980
&gt;&gt; Timothy Wynn: Oh, I hope that
all the work that's been done

01:40:42.980 --> 01:40:44.950
up to this point doesn't
go to waste.

01:40:44.950 --> 01:40:48.630
I hope people keep the fire lit,
and you know, keep their pedal --

01:40:48.630 --> 01:40:52.270
their foot to the pedal and stay on
the gas and keep this thing going

01:40:52.270 --> 01:40:54.250
because it's not going to
clear up any time soon.

01:40:54.250 --> 01:40:59.080
Um, you know, we have Vietnam vets
who are coming into our courts

01:40:59.080 --> 01:41:01.560
who have never dealt with anything
for years and years and years

01:41:01.560 --> 01:41:02.860
and they're coming into the court

01:41:02.860 --> 01:41:04.160
and they're finally
changing their lives around.

01:41:04.160 --> 01:41:05.460
So it's never too late.

01:41:05.460 --> 01:41:08.140
This is not just about
Iraq and Afghanistan.

01:41:08.140 --> 01:41:09.440
It's about Vietnam vets.

01:41:09.440 --> 01:41:12.140
It's about a ton of veterans
out there that are going

01:41:12.140 --> 01:41:14.310
through certain things
in their lives.

01:41:14.310 --> 01:41:16.640
We need to keep coming
together as a community,

01:41:16.640 --> 01:41:19.910
as a nation, um to combat this.

01:41:19.910 --> 01:41:21.210
We need to stick together.

01:41:21.210 --> 01:41:22.510
We need to educate ourselves.

01:41:22.510 --> 01:41:25.840
Everybody needs to be educated
in this area, in -- in --

01:41:25.840 --> 01:41:28.920
in veterans' issues,
if we want to succeed.

01:41:28.920 --> 01:41:30.220
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Elias: Tom?

01:41:30.220 --> 01:41:33.040
&gt;&gt; Tom Berger: Um, I'd
just echo what Tim said.

01:41:33.040 --> 01:41:34.340
Keep up the good work.

01:41:34.340 --> 01:41:36.660
For those of you who
learned something today,

01:41:36.660 --> 01:41:42.240
take it back to your community
and push it as far as you can.

01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:43.540
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Elias: Judge?

01:41:43.540 --> 01:41:46.500
&gt;&gt; Vance Peterson: One of the
most important therapeutic factors

01:41:46.500 --> 01:41:49.390
for any veteran is simply
talking to another veteran.

01:41:49.390 --> 01:41:51.120
We'd like to see that happen prior

01:41:51.120 --> 01:41:54.630
to their criminal justice
involvement,

01:41:54.630 --> 01:41:58.020
but certainly veterans
talking to veterans is one

01:41:58.020 --> 01:41:59.930
of the best therapies
available out there.

01:41:59.930 --> 01:42:02.060
The communities need
to get involved.

01:42:02.060 --> 01:42:04.500
The communities need to
get deeper into the --

01:42:04.500 --> 01:42:07.260
into the veterans system and
understand what's going on we them

01:42:07.260 --> 01:42:10.950
and do as much preemptive
things as they can possibly do.

01:42:10.950 --> 01:42:14.420
And it doesn't really cost an
awful lot of money to do it.

01:42:14.420 --> 01:42:16.640
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Elias: Bernie?

01:42:16.640 --> 01:42:20.850
&gt;&gt; Bernie Edelman: Next time
our government makes a decision

01:42:20.850 --> 01:42:26.090
to send men and women,
mostly young, off to war,

01:42:26.090 --> 01:42:33.350
they need to also plan fiscally
for when these folks come back

01:42:33.350 --> 01:42:37.180 position:56%
so that there are programs for them.

01:42:37.180 --> 01:42:40.000
That does not go on.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:44.760
Uh, once you're used up,
too often the military wants

01:42:44.760 --> 01:42:46.530
to say, "bye bye," to you.

01:42:46.530 --> 01:42:48.760
Uh, and people come back.

01:42:48.760 --> 01:42:51.410
They are -- they haven't
re-acclimated.

01:42:51.410 --> 01:42:52.710
They are drifting.

01:42:52.710 --> 01:42:54.590
And they are hurting.

01:42:54.590 --> 01:42:59.310
And then they get in -- too
many of them get in trouble.

01:42:59.310 --> 01:43:05.290
We need to -- if you're going to
spend billions of dollars on war,

01:43:05.290 --> 01:43:09.670
spend a couple of billion, put
it away, to build up your --

01:43:09.670 --> 01:43:13.120
your resources here -- we've talked
about a lot of the resources --

01:43:13.120 --> 01:43:17.540 position:56%
for when the troops come back and
you know damn well that you're going

01:43:17.540 --> 01:43:21.970
to have a lot of them who are
suffering from TBI, from PTSD,

01:43:21.970 --> 01:43:24.890
from anxiety, from depression.

01:43:24.890 --> 01:43:28.010
You got to help these guys
and be proactive in doing it.

01:43:28.010 --> 01:43:29.350
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Elias: Greg?

01:43:29.350 --> 01:43:30.650
&gt;&gt; Greg Crawford: Well,
first of all,

01:43:30.650 --> 01:43:32.070
I want to thank you again Jonathon
for -- for being here today.

01:43:32.070 --> 01:43:34.900
And I also want to point out
-- Bernie, you touched on it --

01:43:34.900 --> 01:43:38.020
veterans typically will want to
help veterans and every single one

01:43:38.020 --> 01:43:40.910
of these panel members I called
and there wasn't even a hesitation

01:43:40.910 --> 01:43:42.210
that they wanted to help.

01:43:42.210 --> 01:43:44.030
There wasn't a hesitation
from Melissa or Butch.

01:43:44.030 --> 01:43:45.360
They wanted to be here.

01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:49.230 position:56%
And so what I would say to you is if
you're in a jurisdiction somewhere,

01:43:49.230 --> 01:43:51.510
you got to find a champion and
don't take, "No," for an answer.

01:43:51.510 --> 01:43:54.170
And there's a lot of help out
there for, um, folks that want

01:43:54.170 --> 01:43:57.300
to implement some sort
of veterans programming.

01:43:57.300 --> 01:43:59.000
There's a lot of resources
at your fingertips.

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:00.570
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Elias: I want
to thank the entire panel.

01:44:00.570 --> 01:44:01.870
Thank you very much.

01:44:01.870 --> 01:44:04.050
And just one parting thought
is, while you've heard a lot

01:44:04.050 --> 01:44:07.060
of conversation about how it's
veterans talking to veterans,

01:44:07.060 --> 01:44:09.690
I would implore folks,
especially in rural communities,

01:44:09.690 --> 01:44:11.410
if you've got the gumption
and you're a civilian

01:44:11.410 --> 01:44:13.800
and you care deeply about this
subject, these are our warriors

01:44:13.800 --> 01:44:15.290
that we sent off to protect and --

01:44:15.290 --> 01:44:17.590
and serve and sacrifice,
in many cases.

01:44:17.590 --> 01:44:19.950
Then if you want open up
some sort of center like this

01:44:19.950 --> 01:44:22.220
and help facilitate it, then,
by all means, please do.

01:44:22.220 --> 01:44:25.230
You can call the numbers that
we've made available to you.

01:44:25.230 --> 01:44:26.530
Go to the websites.

01:44:26.530 --> 01:44:27.830
Look it up.

01:44:27.830 --> 01:44:29.130
Put it together yourself.

01:44:29.130 --> 01:44:30.430
It will make a huge difference.

01:44:30.430 --> 01:44:31.730
You -- you actually
could save a life.

01:44:31.730 --> 01:44:34.510
So, thank you very much for being
here and thank you for joining us.

01:44:34.510 --> 01:44:39.710
[ Applause ]

01:44:39.710 --> 01:44:41.010 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Elias: Thank you, buddy.

01:44:41.010 --> 01:44:42.310
Thank you.

01:44:42.310 --> 01:44:43.610
Thank you, Bernie.

01:44:43.610 --> 01:44:44.910
&gt;&gt; Tom Berger: Good job, Tim.

01:44:44.910 --> 01:44:46.210
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Elias:
Thank you very much.

01:44:46.210 --> 01:44:47.510
Questions of the panel, please,

01:44:47.510 --> 01:44:48.810
you can stay for a few minutes,
ask whatever you'd like.

01:44:48.810 --> 01:44:50.740
&gt;&gt; I'm a Vietnam veteran and I'm --

01:44:50.740 --> 01:44:55.860
I'm a mentor at the Fairfax
Virginia Veterans Court docket.

01:44:55.860 --> 01:45:02.140 position:56%
Um, I want to make one comment and
then maybe ask the judge a question.

01:45:02.140 --> 01:45:06.830
The comment is, uh, our particular
veterans court docket was the first

01:45:06.830 --> 01:45:09.240
in Virginia to get started.

01:45:09.240 --> 01:45:11.660
Uh, it's been a slow process.

01:45:11.660 --> 01:45:16.140
We've gotten a few people
through to graduate.

01:45:16.140 --> 01:45:22.750
Um, one of the problems is
whether we have enough incentives

01:45:22.750 --> 01:45:26.000
to offer troubled veterans
going through the program.

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:33.880 position:56%
For example, there may be a few that
have multiple DUIs and some of them,

01:45:33.880 --> 01:45:36.340
when they're presented with
the choice of whether to go

01:45:36.340 --> 01:45:41.640
into the program or to serve
time, they decide to serve time

01:45:41.640 --> 01:45:47.080
because their charges are
not expunged from the record

01:45:47.080 --> 01:45:48.740
in the state of Virginia.

01:45:48.740 --> 01:45:52.360
And that, I understand, in some of
the other veterans court dockets

01:45:52.360 --> 01:45:57.310
in the country, expungement is a
possibility and is an incentive

01:45:57.310 --> 01:46:01.170
to get troubled veterans
through the program.

01:46:01.170 --> 01:46:07.110
The second issue, um, that I'd
like to hear you address, we've --

01:46:07.110 --> 01:46:09.780
being the first veterans
court docket in Virginia,

01:46:09.780 --> 01:46:14.710
we've gone to Richmond
to lobby politically

01:46:14.710 --> 01:46:19.870
to expand the veterans court docket
program in the state and we run

01:46:19.870 --> 01:46:24.770
into problems politically with
some of the committee chairmen,

01:46:24.770 --> 01:46:28.620
many of them conservative,
who don't see the value

01:46:28.620 --> 01:46:31.680
of the veterans court
docket programs.

01:46:31.680 --> 01:46:36.680
They think, "Why give veterans
special treatment compared

01:46:36.680 --> 01:46:39.020
to the rest of the population?"

01:46:39.020 --> 01:46:40.910
And it's a major problem.

01:46:40.910 --> 01:46:44.090
We'd love to see this program
expand throughout the state.

01:46:44.090 --> 01:46:45.390
How do you deal with that?

01:46:45.390 --> 01:46:48.790
How can we change some of
those political attitudes

01:46:48.790 --> 01:46:50.400
in the state capitals?

01:46:50.400 --> 01:46:51.760
&gt;&gt; Vance Peterson: It's -- it's --

01:46:51.760 --> 01:46:53.760
I keep running into
that on a daily basis.

01:46:53.760 --> 01:46:56.340
It's very difficult for me
to go to Olympia and ask

01:46:56.340 --> 01:46:57.640
for any additional funding.

01:46:57.640 --> 01:47:00.380
We fund most of our stuff locally.

01:47:00.380 --> 01:47:02.690
But the question, you
know, why veterans courts?

01:47:02.690 --> 01:47:06.380
I had a, oddly enough, public
defender come up to me and say,

01:47:06.380 --> 01:47:08.490
you know, "Why do you want
to have a veterans court?

01:47:08.490 --> 01:47:09.790
I mean, the next thing you know,

01:47:09.790 --> 01:47:12.310
you're going to have a
special create for police

01:47:12.310 --> 01:47:14.800
and a special court for
firemen, and, you know,

01:47:14.800 --> 01:47:16.630
we already have a mental
health court.

01:47:16.630 --> 01:47:17.930
We already have a drug court.

01:47:17.930 --> 01:47:19.230
Why -- why do this?"

01:47:19.230 --> 01:47:24.400
And, you know, it's --
veterans don't necessarily fit

01:47:24.400 --> 01:47:26.060
into those systems.

01:47:26.060 --> 01:47:29.070
And I -- one of my examples
I just used was, "OK.

01:47:29.070 --> 01:47:34.270 position:56%
In no other job in the world will
you have a 21 year old sergeant tell

01:47:34.270 --> 01:47:37.590
a 20 year old private,
'There's gunfire over there.

01:47:37.590 --> 01:47:39.970
Check it out.'" There's
no other job.

01:47:39.970 --> 01:47:42.830
And after you have experienced
that, after you have gone

01:47:42.830 --> 01:47:45.370
through that whole process,
you will never come back

01:47:45.370 --> 01:47:47.060
and be a civilian again.

01:47:47.060 --> 01:47:48.840
You will always be a veteran.

01:47:48.840 --> 01:47:50.160
You might have a drug problem.

01:47:50.160 --> 01:47:52.270
You might have a mental
health issue.

01:47:52.270 --> 01:47:56.290
You might have TBI, PTSD,
they need that other court

01:47:56.290 --> 01:47:57.870
because that other court --

01:47:57.870 --> 01:47:59.520
that other court will
make them successful.

01:47:59.520 --> 01:48:03.890 position:56%
That recidivism rate in most
veteran's courts is like 11% to 13%.

01:48:03.890 --> 01:48:06.600
The average recidivism
rate is over 40%.

01:48:06.600 --> 01:48:08.190
These courts are successful.

01:48:08.190 --> 01:48:12.860
These defendants, these mentees,
these veterans don't come back

01:48:12.860 --> 01:48:15.630
after they've gone through
this program for the most part.

01:48:15.630 --> 01:48:17.770
I mean, it's a hard push when
you're dealing with the guys

01:48:17.770 --> 01:48:21.520
who hold the money, but they are
the ones that have to be convinced.

01:48:21.520 --> 01:48:25.070
But if you can -- if you can
do it -- without that money,

01:48:25.070 --> 01:48:29.890
if you started out on your own,
you can make them eat their words.

01:48:29.890 --> 01:48:31.660
&gt;&gt; Greg Crawford: And I'd like
to reiterate that you've got

01:48:31.660 --> 01:48:32.980
to find out your numbers.

01:48:32.980 --> 01:48:34.960
You know, find out how many
veterans are in your system.

01:48:34.960 --> 01:48:36.260
&gt;&gt; Vance Peterson: Yeah.

01:48:36.260 --> 01:48:37.560
Yeah.

01:48:37.560 --> 01:48:38.860
&gt;&gt; Greg Crawford: Throughout
the state.

01:48:38.860 --> 01:48:40.160
&gt;&gt; Tom Berger: Yeah.

01:48:40.160 --> 01:48:41.460
We've had -- we've had, uh,

01:48:41.460 --> 01:48:42.760
situations -- one state
in particular.

01:48:42.760 --> 01:48:44.550
There have been a couple of, uh,

01:48:44.550 --> 01:48:46.790
veterans treatment
courts been established

01:48:46.790 --> 01:48:49.420
in several counties in Arizona.

01:48:49.420 --> 01:48:51.670
And there are some where
they refuse to do it

01:48:51.670 --> 01:48:56.350
because there aren't many
veterans living out in the desert

01:48:56.350 --> 01:48:57.760
in those particular counties.

01:48:57.760 --> 01:48:59.530
They can't justify it.

01:48:59.530 --> 01:49:00.830
&gt;&gt; Vance Peterson: What we
do, though, I would note,

01:49:00.830 --> 01:49:02.860
we set up the veterans
forums Spokane.

01:49:02.860 --> 01:49:04.840
It's a 501(c)(3) and, again,

01:49:04.840 --> 01:49:08.110
most veterans courts
have a 501(c)(3) set up,

01:49:08.110 --> 01:49:11.470
a charitable organization so that
we can help fund some of the things

01:49:11.470 --> 01:49:13.290
that the mentors do,
fund the mentor training.

01:49:13.290 --> 01:49:17.010
Our court, our little court
in Spokane, Washington,

01:49:17.010 --> 01:49:21.230
actually has seven other county
courts that feed into our forum.

01:49:21.230 --> 01:49:23.840
So they're -- they're getting
that therapy through the --

01:49:23.840 --> 01:49:26.630
the 501(c)(3) from
seven different courts.

01:49:26.630 --> 01:49:29.670
Although, they may not even say
they have a veteran's court,

01:49:29.670 --> 01:49:31.820
because they're a small
rural county,

01:49:31.820 --> 01:49:33.930
they may have a guy who's
a veteran who's on a docket

01:49:33.930 --> 01:49:36.650
that they will send into
that particular program.

01:49:36.650 --> 01:49:40.190
&gt;&gt; What about the issue
of expungement?

01:49:40.190 --> 01:49:42.110
&gt;&gt; Vance Peterson: Uh, DUIs became
a very big issue in my county

01:49:42.110 --> 01:49:45.180
and when I tried to set this thing
up, the prosecutor was adamant

01:49:45.180 --> 01:49:47.300
that we will not dismiss DUIs.

01:49:47.300 --> 01:49:50.410
You -- if you get a DUI and
it's reduced, it will still stay

01:49:50.410 --> 01:49:52.490
at a reduced level,
perhaps a negligent driving

01:49:52.490 --> 01:49:56.350
or inattentive driving, but it was
a very hot bed political issue.

01:49:56.350 --> 01:49:59.270
The prosecutor is generally
the gatekeeper.

01:49:59.270 --> 01:50:02.460
The elected prosecutor is generally
the guy who's going to lose his job

01:50:02.460 --> 01:50:03.760
if he looks soft on crime.

01:50:03.760 --> 01:50:06.710
So you really kind of have to
do a delicate waltz with them.

01:50:06.710 --> 01:50:08.520
Fortunately, the prosecutor
in my county

01:50:08.520 --> 01:50:12.420 position:56%
at the time was an Air Force
veteran and he was willing to, uh --

01:50:12.420 --> 01:50:16.050
to offer the deals
and offer the -- uh --

01:50:16.050 --> 01:50:19.290
op his prosecutor to spend that
time in the veteran's court.

01:50:19.290 --> 01:50:21.190 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Unfortunately, we're out of time.

01:50:21.190 --> 01:50:23.000
Thank you all very
much for attending.

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:24.300
Um, I hope you learned something

01:50:24.300 --> 01:50:26.060
and I hope you take something
back to your communities.

01:50:26.060 --> 01:50:28.470
Um, thank you to all of our
panelists, to our hosts,

01:50:28.470 --> 01:50:30.640
to our speakers, to our moderator.
