like you know come up with a name and
 

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:18.550 align:start position:0%
like you know come up with a name and

print a card it could be the starting
 

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.980 align:start position:0%
print a card it could be the starting

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:20.990 align:start position:0%
point but then the pushing is where I
 

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:22.659 align:start position:0%
point but then the pushing is where I

00:07:22.659 --> 00:07:22.669 align:start position:0%
think the real learning happens so what
 

00:07:22.669 --> 00:07:25.150 align:start position:0%
think the real learning happens so what
do<00:07:22.789><c> you</c><00:07:22.940><c> do</c><00:07:23.120><c> next</c><00:07:23.479><c> I</c><00:07:23.930><c> think</c><00:07:24.500><c> is</c><00:07:24.590><c> the</c><00:07:24.740><c> essence</c><00:07:25.070><c> of</c>

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:25.160 align:start position:0%
