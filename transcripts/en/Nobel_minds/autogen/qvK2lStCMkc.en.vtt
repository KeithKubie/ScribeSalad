and got very interested in some of the

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689
and got very interested in some of the
 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.450
and got very interested in some of the
ideas of the alternative food movement

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460
ideas of the alternative food movement
 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.969

and at the same time I also got really

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640
and at the same time I also got really
 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.190
and at the same time I also got really
interested in climate change which was

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200
interested in climate change which was
 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.370
interested in climate change which was
becoming more and more topical and

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380
becoming more and more topical and
 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.140
becoming more and more topical and
the environmental movement was talking a

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150
the environmental movement was talking a
 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.540
the environmental movement was talking a
lot about food miles seeing them as the

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550
lot about food miles seeing them as the
 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.510
lot about food miles seeing them as the
arteries of evil globalization with its

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520
arteries of evil globalization with its
 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.190
arteries of evil globalization with its
attendant ills including carbon

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200
attendant ills including carbon
 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.500
attendant ills including carbon
emissions and I wanted to think more

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510
emissions and I wanted to think more
 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.210
emissions and I wanted to think more
about this so I moved to another NGO

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220
about this so I moved to another NGO
 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.800
about this so I moved to another NGO
where I set up a project which was

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810
where I set up a project which was
 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.920
where I set up a project which was
started ostensibly to look at at food

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930
started ostensibly to look at at food
 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.630
started ostensibly to look at at food
miles and to campaign for more local

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640
miles and to campaign for more local
 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.210
miles and to campaign for more local
food but then I started talking to lots

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220
food but then I started talking to lots
 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.490
food but then I started talking to lots
of people and and I started to think

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500
of people and and I started to think
 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.150
of people and and I started to think
hang on is shorter fewer less distance

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160
hang on is shorter fewer less distance
 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.520
hang on is shorter fewer less distance
actually better what happens when you

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530
actually better what happens when you
 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.520
actually better what happens when you
think about the mode of transport air vs

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530
think about the mode of transport air vs
 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.010
think about the mode of transport air vs
shipping and what if something is local

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020
shipping and what if something is local
 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.380
shipping and what if something is local

but kept for ages in energy using cold
 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.380

storage so and around this time I came

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390
storage so and around this time I came
 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.330
storage so and around this time I came
across some quite early studies a lot of

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340
across some quite early studies a lot of
 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.520
across some quite early studies a lot of
them by Swedish researchers that were

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530
them by Swedish researchers that were
 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.920
them by Swedish researchers that were
looking at impacts carbon in pattern on

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930
looking at impacts carbon in pattern on
 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.200

the whole food chain agriculture

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:02.210
the whole food chain agriculture

processing refrigeration cooking waste

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030
processing refrigeration cooking waste
 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.210
processing refrigeration cooking waste
and and that these could have bigger

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220
and and that these could have bigger
 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.790
and and that these could have bigger
impacts and transport and that could be

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800
impacts and transport and that could be
 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.130
impacts and transport and that could be
trade-offs between one stage and another

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140
trade-offs between one stage and another
 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.200
trade-offs between one stage and another
and I realized it was tremendously

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:14.210
and I realized it was tremendously
 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:17.410
and I realized it was tremendously
complicated but also really important

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420
complicated but also really important
 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.330
complicated but also really important
because it seemed that the food system

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340
because it seemed that the food system
 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.200
because it seemed that the food system
had these massive impacts on climate but

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:23.210
had these massive impacts on climate but
 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:24.850
had these massive impacts on climate but
there didn't seem to be an organization

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860
there didn't seem to be an organization
 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.010
there didn't seem to be an organization
that was set up to look at these issues

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:27.020
that was set up to look at these issues
 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.080
that was set up to look at these issues
in the round how does food contribute to

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090
in the round how does food contribute to
 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:30.730
in the round how does food contribute to
climate change and what can we do to

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:30.740
climate change and what can we do to
 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.740
climate change and what can we do to
reduce them so I thought well wouldn't

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750
reduce them so I thought well wouldn't
 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.420
reduce them so I thought well wouldn't
it be a good idea if I set up a network

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430
it be a good idea if I set up a network
 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.210
it be a good idea if I set up a network
to do just that so that's what I did I

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220
to do just that so that's what I did I
 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:38.860
to do just that so that's what I did I
set up the food climate research Network

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870
set up the food climate research Network
 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.990

about that and and I think what's for me

about that and and I think what's for me
 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.160
about that and and I think what's for me

climate research network in many ways

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209
climate research network in many ways
 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:02.320
climate research network in many ways
mirrors the changing preoccupations and

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330
mirrors the changing preoccupations and
 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:03.790

insights of the many different
stakeholders within the food movement so

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200
stakeholders within the food movement so
 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.070
stakeholders within the food movement so
we've moved on from just asking how does

we've moved on from just asking how does

we've moved on from just asking how does
food contribute to greenhouse gas

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450
food contribute to greenhouse gas
 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.530
food contribute to greenhouse gas
emissions and how can we reduce them to

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540
emissions and how can we reduce them to

emissions and how can we reduce them to
recognizing the importance of what we

recognizing the importance of what we
 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.370
recognizing the importance of what we
eat as much as how we produce on these

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380
eat as much as how we produce on these
 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.890

impacts with rising understanding of the

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.440

importance of meat and realizing that

different ways of producing and

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130
different ways of producing and
 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:26.200
different ways of producing and
distributing and

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210

foods reflect health environment jobs

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150
foods reflect health environment jobs
 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.260

animal welfare power relations in very

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270
animal welfare power relations in very
 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.059
animal welfare power relations in very
different and often conflicting

00:04:34.059 --> 00:04:34.069
different and often conflicting
 

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:36.909
different and often conflicting
contradictory ways and we've shifted

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:36.919
contradictory ways and we've shifted
 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:39.279
contradictory ways and we've shifted
from talking about a food chain to a

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:39.289
from talking about a food chain to a
 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:42.040
from talking about a food chain to a
food system that brings in people and

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050
food system that brings in people and
 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.430
food system that brings in people and
institutions and power relations so I

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440
institutions and power relations so I
 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.589
institutions and power relations so I
think where we are today is that we all

00:04:47.589 --> 00:04:47.599
think where we are today is that we all
 

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:49.570
think where we are today is that we all
agree we have massive problems that we

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580
agree we have massive problems that we
 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.059
agree we have massive problems that we
need to solve but people prioritize

00:04:52.059 --> 00:04:52.069
need to solve but people prioritize
 

00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:54.790
need to solve but people prioritize
these problems differently and they

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800
these problems differently and they
 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.249
these problems differently and they
disagree about what we ought to do and

00:04:57.249 --> 00:04:57.259
disagree about what we ought to do and
 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:00.820
disagree about what we ought to do and
so I think that's where we are we all

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830
so I think that's where we are we all
 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:04.390
so I think that's where we are we all
want a greener fairer healthier food

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400
want a greener fairer healthier food
 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.150

can differ quite wildly because I think

can differ quite wildly because I think
 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.680
can differ quite wildly because I think
