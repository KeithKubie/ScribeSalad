00:00:05.945 --> 00:00:07.570
MATTHEW KAM: Good
afternoon, everybody.

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:10.950
So thank you very much
for coming to this session

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.650
today, where we have
the pleasure of having

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.560
Tomer Sharon to give us a
presentation on the death

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.380
of the research reports.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.860
So as we get started, please
remember to turn off your cell

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.160
phones and all buzzing devices.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.420
So for many of you guys here
who already know Tomer well,

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.009
welcome back to Google.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.230
For those of you guys who
don't know Tomer well,

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.870
he used to be a senior
user experience researcher

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.560
here at Google, working on the
fourth floor of this building.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.620
That's when I got to know him.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.510
So Tomer today is
a thought leader

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.840
in the field of user
experience design and research,

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.260
working as vice president
and head of user experience

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.370
at WeWork, which is this
start-up that has thousands

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.510
of locations worldwide in which
Tomer leads this team that

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.900
designs work and living spaces,
communities, and services

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.020
around the world at WeWork.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.500
So there is also a desk
at the back of the room

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.480
where copies of the most
recent book written by Tomer

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.820
is on sale.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.370
So he's the author of
two books, "Validating

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.870
Product Ideas Through Lean User
Research," that is on sale.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:23.820
Also the author of
a less recent book,

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.540
"It's Our Research," which
I've read and enjoyed a lot.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.760
And both books have
so-called actually

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.300
helped to increase the adoption
of user experience research

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.950
among products teams worldwide.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.050
So this is how we're going
to do today's session.

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.410
So first we would have
Tomer up here giving

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.990
a presentation for
about 20 minutes,

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.120
and then we would transition
to a [? FileChat ?] discussion

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.940
format between me and him.

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.630
I have some prepared
questions for him

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.046
that I hope would be the same
questions that you guys have

00:01:56.046 --> 00:01:57.360
for his presentation.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.780
And then after that, we
will open up the session

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.100
to Q&amp;A from the audience.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.170
Is that OK?

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.740
OK, great.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.660
And then when we
get to audience Q&amp;A,

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.639
I would just request
that everybody step up

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:11.640
to the mics on both
sides of the room

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.890
so that the questions
that you raise

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.690
can be heard by the
rest of the room.

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:16.760
It can also be recorded.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.020
And we'll leave enough time
so that you guys can check out

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.830
copies of his books at the
desk later, which comes

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.241
with a Google-subsidized price.

00:02:28.241 --> 00:02:28.740
OK.

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.600
So with that, well,
welcome, Tomer.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.528
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:35.820
TOMER SHARON: Thank you, Matt.

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.653
It's great to be back,
and it's great to see

00:02:37.653 --> 00:02:39.910
some familiar faces.

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.500
So when I joined WeWork
about close to two years

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.420
ago, I asked this question, how
do you decide what to work on?

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.510
And the answer to the
question, the answer that I got

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.970
is pretty much on our walls
and our people's T-shirts--

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.440
do what you love.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.150
What we're trying to do right
from the get-go at WeWork

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.800
is try and come
up with something

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.570
that helps people understand
that passion, do what you love,

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:15.260
is not necessarily the only
way to decide what to work on.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.080
So we added-- we
created this diagram,

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.140
and we added human
needs and ability.

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.160
So let me explain.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.810
Passion is do what you love.

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.020
You think a product, a
feature, is really cool,

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.500
you're really passionate about
doing that, so you just do it.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.790
That's how many companies
decide what to work on.

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.400
We also added ability.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.580
Can you even do that, that
thing that you want to do?

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.481
And let's say that
passion and ability,

00:03:43.481 --> 00:03:44.980
sometimes you see
a lot of companies

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.750
decide based on
ability, as well.

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.700
And then what we wanted to add
that was completely missing

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.250
at WeWork was
considering human needs.

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.992
Do people actually need that
thing that you're thinking of?

00:03:59.992 --> 00:04:01.450
And it has to be
what you see here.

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.220
It has to be a
combination of all three.

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.320
Because if it's only a
combination between passion

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.211
and need, then it's fantasy.

00:04:08.211 --> 00:04:09.460
You can't-- it's a flying car.

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.660
You can't really-- you
can't really do it.

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.530
If it's a combination
between need and ability,

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.070
then it's just work 9:00 to
5:00, there's no passion there.

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.740
And forgive me, art
lovers, but if it's

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:24.520
a combination between ability
and passion, then it's art.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.900
It's not really needed, but it's
there, we're doing that anyway.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.410
So this is how we started.

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.240
A couple of words about WeWork.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.006
WeWork is a company
on a mission.

00:04:36.006 --> 00:04:37.630
This is the company
mission, "To create

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.390
a world where people work
to make a life, not just

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.520
a living."

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.150
These are current WeWork cities.

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:52.210
I think we are in 50 cities
at the moment with over 160

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.420
locations, and we're growing.

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.720
We're opening about
10-- between 10

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.870
and 20 buildings
once every month.

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:06.810
WeWork is selling
its customers--

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.280
we call them members--

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.130
space, community, and services.

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:16.120
So our spaces are known to
be really, really beautiful,

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.860
a really warm environment that
invites people to collaborate.

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:26.230
We have a lot of events that
are going on throughout the day

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:28.000
and over weekends, sometimes.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.340
And we also provide
our members with a lot

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.860
of services, a lot
of digital products

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.840
to support meaningful
connections

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:41.320
between our members, and also
apps and so on and so forth

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.160
to connect them.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.640
Services include health
insurance, if they want,

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:50.800
and probably hundreds of
other different services.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.650
This is my group's mission--
design delightful experiences

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:55.750
for our members through
data-informed human

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:58.080
understanding.

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.840
And here's the
challenge with WeWork.

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:04.990
So think about, let's say,
I don't know, Steve Jobs.

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:07.420
He had a relatively easy job.

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:10.960
If he wanted to understand
the user experience of Apple

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.450
products, he could have
said, for most of them,

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:16.980
bring me all of Apple's products
to the table in front of me.

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:19.000
I want to touch them,
I want to feel them,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.400
I want to give you feedback.

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.160
This guy-- this is our
co-founder and CEO,

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.330
Adam Neumann--

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:26.650
he can't do that.

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:29.350
Because our buildings
are everywhere.

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:32.410
We're opening in more and
more faraway locations.

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:35.026
And it's really, really
hard to understand

00:06:35.026 --> 00:06:36.400
what is the user
experience, what

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.610
is our member's experience?

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:44.200
So from here I jump to
the research that we do.

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.410
And here are three
problems that we

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:51.550
see with research in companies.

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:52.660
Happens here, too.

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:56.080
Happens in probably every
company that does research.

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.810
So first is bad memory.

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:02.875
We have bad research memory.

00:07:02.875 --> 00:07:04.750
Let me know if this
scenario sounds familiar.

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:06.070
Are there researchers here?

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:07.420
I know there are some.

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:09.250
So, researchers, you
don't have to say yes,

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:10.450
but smile if it's true.

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:16.870
You want to do a research
activity, some kind of a study,

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:18.647
and then you-- just
before you start

00:07:18.647 --> 00:07:20.230
planning, you're
thinking to yourself,

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:24.410
hmm, maybe somebody else did
it already, so let me ask.

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:28.390
So you send an email to all of
the researchers in your group,

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:32.200
maybe in your
product area, maybe

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:34.090
all researchers at Google.

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:37.030
And then you ask,
did somebody do

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:40.810
research about x, whatever it
is that you're interested in.

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:45.250
And sure enough, by the end
of the day, you get responses.

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:47.080
I remember back in the
day, it could go up

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:50.470
to 10 responses from
people who say, yes, we

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:53.920
worked on something exactly
like that a couple years ago.

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:55.780
You don't get 10
responses from people

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:59.150
who completely forgot they
did it maybe five years ago.

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:04.330
And then you're a nice person,
so you summarize everything

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:05.040
you read.

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:06.280
You send back to everybody--

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:10.900
I see some smiles, so I
know it's true, still true.

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:13.000
And then you decide to
do the study anyway.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.870
Because yours is a
little bit different

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:17.161
and you want to learn something
a little bit different.

00:08:17.161 --> 00:08:18.910
So you decide to do that anyway.

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:23.230
So we have bad
research memories.

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:27.130
The second problem is silos.

00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:28.930
Researchers are
not the only ones

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:31.510
who are doing
research in a company.

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:33.789
Marketing is doing research.

00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:36.970
Product managers, whether
they call it research or not,

00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:39.100
they are talking
with a lot of users

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:43.299
all the time, and
so on and so forth.

00:08:43.299 --> 00:08:46.150
If you have a call center,
they don't do research,

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:49.900
but sometimes they issue reports
about the top 10 problems

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:53.830
that they're facing, that
people are calling them about.

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:58.930
This is also a silo
where this data is saved.

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:02.170
So a lot of departments
are doing research.

00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:05.830
Everybody's happy to share,
but there's no one place

00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:10.560
to make sense out
of all of that.

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:14.070
And my pet peeve, reports.

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:17.670
I'm pretty sure, although
I remember some exceptions

00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:20.730
here at Google, I'm pretty
sure that there's not

00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:23.160
one person on the face
of this earth that

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.470
wakes up in the
morning saying, I'm

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:28.590
going to read a report today.

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:30.940
And being a researcher
for many years,

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:32.520
I don't even like to write them.

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:39.270
And I think reports are not
what I call the atomic unit

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:40.800
of a research insight.

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.470
Again, researchers
would tell you

00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:47.220
that you go into
a research study

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:49.950
and you have a short list of
questions you want to answer.

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:52.020
Those are the
research questions.

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:54.300
And then research is life.

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:58.530
You look at life, and life
looks at you back and say,

00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:00.850
I have more answers
than your questions.

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:04.500
So you find out more than
what you intended to find.

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:05.790
And then there's the report.

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:08.940
So you are-- as a researcher,
you have a dilemma.

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:12.450
Should I report answers
to the research questions

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:15.060
that we were interested
in, or should I

00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:19.650
report that plus a lot of
other information that I found?

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:21.090
There's no rule about that.

00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:24.330
So any researcher does
whatever they think is right.

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:28.110
In any case, reports
are not really atomic.

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:32.190
There's a report that might
include a piece of information

00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:33.990
that has nothing to
do with the reason

00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:37.080
for running this
specific research study,

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:39.480
and yet it's an
important insight that

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:41.070
might serve people
in the future,

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:43.410
but it's buried in the report.

00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:50.580
So I'm aware of these
problems for many years.

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:54.270
And as soon as I joined
WeWork and was asked

00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:56.160
to start a group from scratch--

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:59.850
there was not a lot of research
going on there at the time--

00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:02.890
I thought this is an
opportunity to maybe solve

00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:07.500
all of these problems with this
system that we called Polaris.

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:14.030
So Polaris is a way for--

00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:17.930
I call it democratize
the user experience.

00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:20.360
I published a Medium post
about that and somebody

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:23.400
responded saying, you're
not really democratizing.

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:25.780
Why do you call it
democratizing user experience?

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:27.720
It's just a research archive.

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:31.370
So, yes, it is a
research archive.

00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:37.580
But this research
archive is the output.

00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:40.500
Democracy for user
experience is the outcome.

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:41.850
And that's really important.

00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:46.010
What's happening with
Polaris is very interesting.

00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:47.450
First of all,
Polaris is a system

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:53.750
that gathers all of the research
that is being done at WeWork,

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:57.410
and it gathers that in a
very different atomic unit

00:11:57.410 --> 00:11:58.370
than a report.

00:11:58.370 --> 00:12:00.050
I'll get to that in a second.

00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:03.620
In any case, Polaris
is helping anyone

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:05.540
at WeWork who is
designing anything,

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:07.760
who is building anything,
who is affecting the member

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:10.820
experience, to
prioritize their work--

00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:14.180
and I'll give you an example
for that very shortly--

00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:16.670
to educate themselves.

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:22.730
I know that teams at
WeWork, as teams here--

00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:25.850
and again, researchers would
know what I'm talking about--

00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:27.290
are not waiting for anyone.

00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:31.100
They're not waiting for a
researcher or for a report

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:34.430
or for a study to end to
decide what to do or to decide

00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:36.080
what to work on.

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:39.350
That said, they are happy to
learn and educate themselves

00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:41.600
about what they
decided to do already.

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:45.440
So Polaris is a system that
helps educate these teams

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:48.000
about what they're working on.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.540
And lastly, if by
any chance there's

00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:52.780
a team who's looking
for a project,

00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:56.455
Polaris can help
allocate or assign teams

00:12:56.455 --> 00:12:57.455
with different projects.

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:01.740
All right.

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:05.190
When I talked about the atomic
unit of a research insight,

00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:06.810
this is it.

00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:08.820
We call it a research nugget.

00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:12.830
And we just celebrated,
a little while ago,

00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:16.290
5,000 nuggets entered to
Polaris, in a chicken nugget

00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:18.180
meal.

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:19.090
So what's a nugget?

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:23.970
A nugget is a tagged observation
supported by evidence.

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:27.315
Tagged observation
supported by evidence.

00:13:27.315 --> 00:13:28.650
I'll explain.

00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:29.690
Observation.

00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:34.890
So observation is something
that we learned during a study.

00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:38.130
We saw something, we
understood something,

00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:40.230
we understood why it happened.

00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:41.740
This is an observation.

00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:43.170
So we just type it down--

00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:47.570
this is what we found, and
this is what explains it.

00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:48.140
Evidence.

00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:50.330
There has to be--
there's no nugget--

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:54.060
nothing enters Polaris
without evidence.

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:56.270
It's not about the
opinion of anyone.

00:13:56.270 --> 00:14:01.100
There has to be evidence, proof
that the observation is true.

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:04.790
That could be a
short video clip.

00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:05.790
Could be 10 seconds.

00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:07.700
It could be a minute,
something like that.

00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:10.400
It could be a photo.

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:12.740
It could be a
screenshot of an email.

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:13.880
It could be a document.

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:16.000
It could be whatever
it is, whatever media,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:21.620
but proof and evidence that
what we said in the observation

00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:24.440
is actually what happened.

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:29.650
And lastly-- and that's
what makes Polaris useful

00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:30.700
and special--

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:32.150
is a series of tags.

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:35.570
The first thing we did when
we designed Polaris was

00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:39.350
create a long taxonomy of
tags-- how we tag things,

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:42.720
how we tag nuggets
within that system.

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:48.140
So these could be tags that
are pretty much demographic,

00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:52.760
so which city, a
name of the location,

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:55.210
the size of the
company, and so on,

00:14:55.210 --> 00:14:58.380
that the person is representing
and so on and so forth.

00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:01.640
But there are also tags that
relate to the experience.

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:06.000
So is this observation
a positive one, neutral,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:06.920
or negative?

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:10.760
Is this-- what is the
magnitude of that?

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:12.170
What is the frequency?

00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:15.810
And so on and so forth.

00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:18.290
I call them the three
Cs, three things

00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:22.850
that people can do in Polaris
when they go into the system.

00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:25.490
They can create nuggets.

00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:29.510
They can search for different
nuggets under different topics

00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:34.400
and create playlists
from these nuggets.

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:36.660
They can-- and this
is how it looks like--

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:39.560
so you see an interview here.

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:44.030
So we just decide on the
clip, what is the length,

00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:47.490
and the second that
it starts and ends,

00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:50.900
and that would be the evidence,
if that's an interview.

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:55.610
You see-- middle left you see
an empty box for typing down

00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:57.390
the observation.

00:15:57.390 --> 00:16:02.060
And on the right and bottom
left, you see some of the tags

00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:04.160
that we're using.

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:05.480
We tag by journey.

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:09.890
We tag by emotions, objects,
and the experience metrics

00:16:09.890 --> 00:16:12.450
that I just described.

00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:14.420
And then you can also curate.

00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:19.600
You can add and create
nuggets to playlists,

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:23.610
and you can share these
with other people at WeWork.

00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:29.770
This is how a
playlist looks like.

00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:32.860
You might suspect I
worked here for a while.

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:35.740
So what you see--

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:39.100
obviously the video
is the evidence.

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:40.780
Just below it you
see other members

00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:42.250
squatting, blah, blah, blah.

00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:44.590
That's the observation.

00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:46.750
And some of the tags
on the right-hand side,

00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:49.090
on the bottom right-hand side.

00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:52.660
And on the right is the playlist
itself, the different nuggets

00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:55.810
that compile and
create the playlist.

00:16:55.810 --> 00:16:58.240
You can see that you
have nine nuggets there.

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:01.720
It will take you about five
minutes to watch, and so on.

00:17:04.849 --> 00:17:10.760
People can consume these
nuggets and playlists.

00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:13.170
I compare that to healthy food.

00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:16.560
At first, they don't
really like it.

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:19.760
But it's good for
them, so they have to.

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:22.670
And in time, they understand
that this is useful,

00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:24.380
and they use it more and more.

00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:28.700
We see very interesting
usage scenarios,

00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:31.760
tracking what's happening
behind the scenes.

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:34.010
We see people who are--

00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:36.800
let's say there's a
designer, interior designer,

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:41.360
that designed a
conference room at WeWork.

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:44.720
So that person is looking for
feedback about the conference

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:45.620
room.

00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:47.950
We see people in a building.

00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:51.020
We saw somebody in a
building in Chicago watching

00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:55.530
all 200 nuggets related to
that building in Chicago,

00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:56.580
and so on and so forth.

00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:58.670
We've seen teams
making decisions,

00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:00.860
roadmap decisions
about their products

00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:03.500
based on what they
find in Polaris.

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:07.160
I want to give an
example for that.

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:12.404
So to become a WeWork member,
you usually take a tour.

00:18:12.404 --> 00:18:13.070
You take a tour.

00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:15.500
You go through the building
you're interested in.

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:17.510
They show you different things.

00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:20.690
And then you decide if
you want to join or not.

00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:23.280
We also serve coffee at WeWork.

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:29.930
So let's say you are the general
manager of WeWork in Europe.

00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:32.990
And you want to see--

00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:35.121
you want to get
feedback about tours--

00:18:35.121 --> 00:18:36.620
you want to understand
the situation

00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:38.270
about tours and coffee.

00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:39.830
What's more important?

00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:45.230
You search for negative tours
in Amsterdam-- or sorry,

00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:46.840
in Europe.

00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:49.460
And then you might
get this result,

00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:51.980
72 nuggets in the playlist.

00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:55.700
And when you search for
coffee negative in Europe,

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:58.010
you get three nuggets.

00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:00.680
That alone, without even
watching the playlist,

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:03.680
that alone tells
you that there might

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:08.270
be a bigger challenge there
with tours rather than coffee.

00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:12.594
So your focus should
be on understanding

00:19:12.594 --> 00:19:13.760
what's happening with tours.

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:20.520
I want to show you
a quick video of how

00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:23.580
it looks like and sounds like.

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:27.180
So we also serve beer.

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:31.092
So here's some
feedback about beer.

00:19:31.092 --> 00:19:31.592
Whoops.

00:19:34.903 --> 00:19:37.270
OK.

00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:43.280
So you first-- this is
how you start the search.

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:45.710
You search-- these are,
we call them props.

00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:49.190
So beer is a prop.

00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:50.270
You select the location.

00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:58.220
If you're interested in some
other filters, you apply them.

00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:03.070
If not, you move on and you
get the results as a playlist.

00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:03.970
You can save it.

00:20:07.762 --> 00:20:11.150
I have a very creative
name for this,

00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:12.650
very creative description.

00:20:18.290 --> 00:20:26.068
And let's listen to
a couple of nuggets.

00:20:26.068 --> 00:20:28.340
[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:31.540
- I love having it as an
available option when you are

00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:33.697
doing crazy [INAUDIBLE]
and you go for a beer.

00:20:33.697 --> 00:20:35.780
You sit down and have a
beer and talk crazy stuff.

00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:38.890
And that, to me, I think
that's a phenomenal part.

00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:40.260
But--

00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:42.740
[END PLAYBACK]

00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:45.320
TOMER SHARON: Not everybody
likes beer, though.

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:47.757
Or the fact of having
beer in an office.

00:20:47.757 --> 00:20:50.192
[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:20:50.192 --> 00:20:52.200
- And it was noisy.

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:55.330
And then I think
not everybody's 20.

00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:57.995
So if I'm having people
come up and, yeah,

00:20:57.995 --> 00:20:59.370
it's a cool space
and everything.

00:20:59.370 --> 00:21:02.960
But you know, having kids
drink beer and all that crap,

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:05.410
it's fine, but I think
there's a whole 'nother

00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:09.730
niche for a little bit more
sophisticated opportunities

00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:11.741
for people in that
sector of the business.

00:21:11.741 --> 00:21:12.695
- Right.

00:21:12.695 --> 00:21:13.532
[END PLAYBACK]

00:21:13.532 --> 00:21:15.990
TOMER SHARON: So this is how
it looks like and sounds like.

00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:19.500
I obviously picked
audio not to expose

00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:22.500
the identity of those people.

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:26.130
You can also watch a list,
a playlist as a list,

00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:30.040
not just as videos or photos.

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:31.665
And-- argh.

00:21:31.665 --> 00:21:32.220
Of course.

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:38.642
No, no, no.

00:21:41.606 --> 00:21:43.088
Sorry about that.

00:21:46.046 --> 00:21:46.546
OK.

00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:51.940
All right.

00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:54.050
And to sum it up, this is
the vision for Polaris.

00:21:54.050 --> 00:21:55.520
Because this is not the end.

00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:57.950
What Polaris-- before
I show you that--

00:21:57.950 --> 00:22:00.970
what Polaris is
doing is tell you--

00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:06.850
tell us, WeWork employees,
why things are happening.

00:22:06.850 --> 00:22:09.280
Our vision is also to provide
a system that tells us--

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:11.330
that explains what is happening.

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:14.970
So we want to provide
a score for everything

00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:19.690
at WeWork, a quantitative score,
and then from that score lead

00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:21.290
to a Polaris playlist.

00:22:21.290 --> 00:22:24.250
So for example, beer.

00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:26.410
Let's say beer is scoring--

00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:31.240
worldwide the score
is 44% out of 100.

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:33.760
And you want to understand,
as the person who's

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:35.290
responsible for
beer at WeWork, you

00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:39.630
want to understand why
the score is so low.

00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:43.920
Then you can get to
Polaris and see a playlist

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:47.970
of people talking about beer.

00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:51.120
The way we do that is by
collecting, for example,

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:55.020
satisfaction feedback
through these little devices

00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:57.540
that we created,
on the top left,

00:22:57.540 --> 00:23:01.500
and we put them everywhere
in the building,

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:03.720
through surveys,
and through an app--

00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:05.760
we call this the Yay app--

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:09.750
through an app that our
teams in the buildings

00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:13.530
pull out and ask people
to rate different things

00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:16.540
that are happening around them.

00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:19.320
So this is how
people can understand

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:25.680
both what is happening and then
understand why it's happening.

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:27.970
I couldn't help it, but
if you're interested,

00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:33.190
this is another research project
that we completed at WeWork.

00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:35.350
We found that a lot of
people don't show up

00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:41.270
to tours because they can't find
the entrance to the building.

00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:43.280
So this is how we solved it.

00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:45.160
So you can read about it there.

00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:48.820
And I think we are done.

00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:49.730
Yeah, slides.

00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:51.560
Blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah.

00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:54.490
Bottom, this deck,
if you're interested.

00:23:54.490 --> 00:23:57.910
And second to last, if you
want to start it on your own,

00:23:57.910 --> 00:24:00.094
just check it out and
see if this is something

00:24:00.094 --> 00:24:00.760
that you can do.

00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:05.020
We created an Airtable
template for Polaris,

00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:07.180
for designing your own Polaris.

00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:12.490
So feel free to use it.

00:24:12.490 --> 00:24:14.050
I think that's it.

00:24:14.050 --> 00:24:15.404
Thank you.

00:24:15.404 --> 00:24:17.764
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:20.130 --> 00:24:21.260
MATTHEW KAM: OK, great.

00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:23.509
Thank you so much for taking
the time to explain this.

00:24:23.509 --> 00:24:26.590
And I was not expecting
to have templates

00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:29.560
that we could use to
start putting together

00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:32.105
something like this together.

00:24:32.105 --> 00:24:34.220
Well, so some questions for you.

00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:38.000
So if we have to think about
Polaris and all these processes

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.200
from the producers
and false starts,

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:44.140
it seems to me that there's
a bit of this symmetry where

00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:45.670
the people who are
trying to put all

00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:48.086
these nuggets into the system
are the guys who are putting

00:24:48.086 --> 00:24:50.740
in all the hard work so that
the consumers could actually

00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:53.760
benefit from this.

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:55.720
So I mean, so in
your experience,

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:59.440
what have been some of the
so-called more successful ways

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:02.230
to actually incentivize more
people in your organization

00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:05.595
to create and archive
these nuggets?

00:25:05.595 --> 00:25:06.970
TOMER SHARON: So
at this point, I

00:25:06.970 --> 00:25:11.560
would say we are kind of
control freaks about what

00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:14.380
goes in Polaris.

00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:17.720
Outside the UX team,
not a lot of people

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:21.010
can add nuggets to Polaris.

00:25:21.010 --> 00:25:22.240
There are exceptions, though.

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:25.900
The exceptions are a team
that asked us specifically

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:27.530
to train them on--

00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:30.100
it's actually-- it's
kind of a hidden way

00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:33.012
of training teams on how
to do their own research.

00:25:33.012 --> 00:25:34.970
They want to add things
to Polaris, and we say,

00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:37.655
you know what, let's train
you on how to do research,

00:25:37.655 --> 00:25:39.280
you'll do research,
and then we'll also

00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:42.714
train you on how to add
nuggets to the system.

00:25:42.714 --> 00:25:43.630
And then they do that.

00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:46.990
So we've so far trained
two different teams.

00:25:46.990 --> 00:25:49.165
Sometimes there's
a person that is

00:25:49.165 --> 00:25:52.240
an individual that's interested
personally in doing that.

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:54.180
We train them, as well.

00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:58.062
But not everyone has
access to do that.

00:25:58.062 --> 00:25:59.020
MATTHEW KAM: OK, great.

00:25:59.020 --> 00:25:59.811
That's interesting.

00:25:59.811 --> 00:26:01.862
And that actually leads
me to the next question.

00:26:01.862 --> 00:26:03.820
Because you were talking
about all these things

00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:07.102
about observations
versus evidence.

00:26:07.102 --> 00:26:08.560
Well, I mean, what
does it actually

00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:12.645
take to train someone to
actually so-called frame

00:26:12.645 --> 00:26:15.190
and enter something that
is acceptable as a piece

00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:17.209
of evidence?

00:26:17.209 --> 00:26:19.250
TOMER SHARON: We have
conversations within the UX

00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:22.540
team about many things related
to Polaris, specifically

00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:24.940
about that, as well.

00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:25.690
It really depends.

00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:27.580
If you don't say
anything, some people

00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:31.630
would write down an observation
and then choose as evidence

00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:34.030
the exact same words that
the person in the interview

00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:36.580
is saying, for example.

00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:40.030
So we ask them and train them
to kind of add some more context

00:26:40.030 --> 00:26:45.410
by extending the time that
they include as evidence.

00:26:45.410 --> 00:26:48.080
Sometimes it's not
just a recording.

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:49.150
Sometimes it's a photo.

00:26:49.150 --> 00:26:50.950
And support that
with a photo that

00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:52.750
better explains or
provides evidence

00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:56.050
to what you were just saying.

00:26:56.050 --> 00:26:58.100
It's not easy.

00:26:58.100 --> 00:27:00.670
We have a lot of conversations
about the quality, what

00:27:00.670 --> 00:27:03.170
qualifies as a great
nugget, and so on.

00:27:03.170 --> 00:27:05.620
We also have a term,
kind of internal term--

00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:09.470
you don't see it in the system--
we call it the golden nugget.

00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:14.680
A golden nugget is a
nugget that is so special

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:17.830
that you learn something
really important from it.

00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:19.030
It's really actionable.

00:27:19.030 --> 00:27:21.110
It's something-- it's
like a headbanger.

00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:24.245
It's like, oh, man, we have
to do something about that.

00:27:24.245 --> 00:27:26.120
MATTHEW KAM: How many
percent of your nuggets

00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:27.032
are golden nuggets?

00:27:27.032 --> 00:27:27.990
TOMER SHARON: Very few.

00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:29.864
Very, very few.

00:27:29.864 --> 00:27:30.530
MATTHEW KAM: OK.

00:27:30.530 --> 00:27:32.730
So I was wondering,
because yeah, there

00:27:32.730 --> 00:27:35.590
is a certain threshold
that a piece of evidence

00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:36.640
needs to meet.

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:39.600
So when there are
situations when

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:42.670
there might be employees
who actually disagree

00:27:42.670 --> 00:27:46.090
about the evidence
that go into a nugget,

00:27:46.090 --> 00:27:49.120
or sometimes the fact that the
evidence might be OK in itself,

00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:51.387
but it's not relevant
to the observation--

00:27:51.387 --> 00:27:52.720
so how do you guys resolve that?

00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:54.969
TOMER SHARON: What I'm going
to say didn't happen yet.

00:27:54.969 --> 00:27:56.030
We didn't implement this.

00:27:56.030 --> 00:27:59.680
But this is something
that we're working on.

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:04.210
As we train new people on
adding nuggets and evidence

00:28:04.210 --> 00:28:08.620
to Polaris, we want to create
different roles of people.

00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:12.970
And then if you are kind of a
newbie nuggetizer, we call it,

00:28:12.970 --> 00:28:18.100
then somebody will have
to review and approve your

00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:20.530
maybe first 100 nuggets.

00:28:20.530 --> 00:28:23.410
So there's another eye
that looks at things.

00:28:23.410 --> 00:28:24.400
It's not just you.

00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:28.240
So we hope to somehow
compensate for things that don't

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:29.800
count as evidence, for example.

00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:30.760
MATTHEW KAM: OK.

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:32.850
And then, well,
as you mentioned,

00:28:32.850 --> 00:28:36.070
the nugget is the most atomic
unit of research findings.

00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:38.230
But sometimes
consumers don't really

00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:43.330
want to get a finding at
that level of granularity.

00:28:43.330 --> 00:28:45.340
They want something like
a higher-level theme

00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:48.541
that integrates and synthesizes
many different nuggets.

00:28:48.541 --> 00:28:50.790
So do you guys provide any
support for that right now?

00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:52.750
TOMER SHARON: Yes.

00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:55.810
We also create and
curate playlists.

00:28:55.810 --> 00:28:58.570
So these are
UX-curated playlists,

00:28:58.570 --> 00:29:00.370
and we share them with teams.

00:29:00.370 --> 00:29:02.030
So we can do their work.

00:29:02.030 --> 00:29:03.977
We have a way to--

00:29:03.977 --> 00:29:05.560
in a way, it's like
a report, but it's

00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:09.370
a playlist with maybe a
few more words about it,

00:29:09.370 --> 00:29:12.400
some analysis into what
is it that you're seeing

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:13.960
in the playlist and so on.

00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:17.110
So we do that.

00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:20.030
And sometimes we train
others to do that, as well.

00:29:20.030 --> 00:29:20.780
MATTHEW KAM: Yeah.

00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:21.280
OK.

00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:25.069
So now switching over to
the consumer side of things,

00:29:25.069 --> 00:29:26.860
so what have you guys
found to be the types

00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:29.020
and characteristics
of research nuggets

00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:31.910
that were more
useful to consumers?

00:29:31.910 --> 00:29:34.690
TOMER SHARON: So I touched
a little bit earlier.

00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:37.930
Sometimes nuggets-- and these
are, it's not the nuggets,

00:29:37.930 --> 00:29:40.550
it's the people who enter them--

00:29:40.550 --> 00:29:44.350
in an observation, they
just describe what happened.

00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:47.180
That's not really useful.

00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:53.500
So the person said that
having beer in an office

00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:56.030
is not a good idea.

00:29:56.030 --> 00:29:58.390
That's not enough as a nugget.

00:29:58.390 --> 00:30:00.160
We want to understand why.

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:02.440
Or they held-- let
me maybe describe

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:05.800
something more meaningful.

00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:09.160
The members said that
they're taking meetings

00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:13.060
in a coffee shop rather than
in our conference rooms.

00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:13.565
Interesting.

00:30:13.565 --> 00:30:15.190
But still, it's not
a nugget because we

00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:18.230
don't understand why.

00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:20.510
And if they add the
why-- for example,

00:30:20.510 --> 00:30:23.740
they do that because
WeWork is too noisy--

00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:26.110
then we have something that
we can do something about.

00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:28.490
So this is meaningful.

00:30:28.490 --> 00:30:32.037
This is something that hints
that there's a problem there

00:30:32.037 --> 00:30:33.370
and we know what the problem is.

00:30:33.370 --> 00:30:35.830
And if we search for
noise, and if it's

00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:38.712
tagged by noise in
conference rooms,

00:30:38.712 --> 00:30:41.170
and if we search for that, for
a list like that in Polaris,

00:30:41.170 --> 00:30:44.136
and see, I don't
know, 120 nuggets,

00:30:44.136 --> 00:30:45.760
we know we have a
problem there that we

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:48.010
need to do something about.

00:30:48.010 --> 00:30:52.820
So these nuggets must be
a unit, an atomic unit.

00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:56.554
And it's not an atomic unit
if it doesn't have that why.

00:30:56.554 --> 00:30:57.220
MATTHEW KAM: OK.

00:30:57.220 --> 00:30:58.420
Got it.

00:30:58.420 --> 00:30:59.740
So some broader questions now.

00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:03.446
Because my understanding
and impression about

00:31:03.446 --> 00:31:05.770
Polaris when watching
our presentation

00:31:05.770 --> 00:31:08.320
is that there's always
a tension in computing

00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:11.330
systems between pull
and push mechanisms.

00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:13.630
Polaris seems to be something
that's more pull driven.

00:31:13.630 --> 00:31:14.379
TOMER SHARON: Yep.

00:31:14.379 --> 00:31:17.920
MATTHEW KAM: And well, what
might be some opportunities

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:20.900
to think about supporting
more push mechanisms?

00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:24.300
TOMER SHARON: So currently we
have a manual push mechanism.

00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:26.800
We push playlists to people.

00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:30.950
We heard you've been working
on ordering beer for WeWork.

00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:33.820
Here's a playlist
of people, members

00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:36.760
from all over the world,
talking about beer.

00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:39.130
That's very manual.

00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:44.860
One other thing that's
a feature on our roadmap

00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:49.450
is updating you as
somebody who either

00:31:49.450 --> 00:31:51.370
showed some kind of
interest in a playlist.

00:31:51.370 --> 00:31:56.110
Either you created it or
it was shared with you.

00:31:56.110 --> 00:31:58.540
Each time there's
a new nugget that

00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:00.400
is being added to the list--

00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:01.930
and it's being
added automatically

00:32:01.930 --> 00:32:03.580
because of the tags--

00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:05.380
you'll get a
notification about that.

00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:08.830
And then we hope that this will
encourage people to try it out

00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:09.375
more.

00:32:09.375 --> 00:32:10.750
MATTHEW KAM: That's
a great idea.

00:32:10.750 --> 00:32:13.450
And since you're talking about
tagging, I was wondering,

00:32:13.450 --> 00:32:15.790
when you guys were
designing Polaris,

00:32:15.790 --> 00:32:17.620
besides the tagging
approach, were there

00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:21.100
any other considerations
that you guys considered

00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:25.330
for other approaches to
organizing the nuggets?

00:32:25.330 --> 00:32:28.690
TOMER SHARON: No, not really.

00:32:28.690 --> 00:32:31.270
The only thing we
were not sure of--

00:32:31.270 --> 00:32:34.250
it was very clear for us
that this was an investment.

00:32:34.250 --> 00:32:37.390
So we wanted to be sure
that this is working

00:32:37.390 --> 00:32:40.440
before we make that investment.

00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:42.190
So we created that
template that I shared.

00:32:42.190 --> 00:32:47.590
We created everything with
Airtable, stored everything

00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:48.710
on--

00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:52.090
the video recordings on
YouTube, stored audio recordings

00:32:52.090 --> 00:32:56.380
on SoundCloud, and
that was our system.

00:32:56.380 --> 00:33:00.440
As soon as we saw the
reaction to it, we decided,

00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:01.960
OK, this is worthwhile.

00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:06.670
And then we invested the
time in changing all of that

00:33:06.670 --> 00:33:09.214
to a system that we
can control and access.

00:33:09.214 --> 00:33:09.880
MATTHEW KAM: OK.

00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:12.020
It makes total sense to me.

00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:13.810
Well, what are some
of the challenges

00:33:13.810 --> 00:33:16.180
to scaling something
like Polaris,

00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:18.924
and what are you guys
doing about that?

00:33:18.924 --> 00:33:21.340
TOMER SHARON: So I would say
there are two challenges that

00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:23.050
are kind of related.

00:33:23.050 --> 00:33:28.060
One is that it needs to be
something that people at WeWork

00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:29.140
are aware of.

00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:30.840
Because if they're
not aware of it,

00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:32.830
obviously they're
not going to use it.

00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:35.230
And the other challenge
is, once they're aware

00:33:35.230 --> 00:33:37.686
and they search for
something, they have to see--

00:33:37.686 --> 00:33:39.310
I don't know if you
noticed the dates--

00:33:39.310 --> 00:33:42.730
they have to see nuggets
that are relatively new.

00:33:42.730 --> 00:33:47.440
Otherwise, they think it's an
old database of information,

00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:50.230
and they're not going
to do anything about it.

00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:53.944
Although we all
know that sometimes,

00:33:53.944 --> 00:33:55.360
even if you found
something a year

00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:57.109
or two ago, it doesn't
mean that it's old,

00:33:57.109 --> 00:33:58.570
it doesn't mean
that it's not true.

00:33:58.570 --> 00:34:00.070
But that's how people treat it.

00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:02.230
So our challenge is
to keep it fresh.

00:34:04.990 --> 00:34:07.444
And these are big challenges.

00:34:07.444 --> 00:34:08.860
Because to keep
it fresh, it means

00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:12.550
that more people need to
do research and nuggetize

00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:15.230
that more and more.

00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:19.030
And that's something that we
don't always have time to do.

00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:22.219
And awareness is, again,
always a challenge.

00:34:22.219 --> 00:34:24.239
We need to push
and talk about it

00:34:24.239 --> 00:34:26.110
and mention it in every meeting.

00:34:26.110 --> 00:34:28.090
When somebody asks
us a question,

00:34:28.090 --> 00:34:29.960
we shouldn't just
answer, we should say--

00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:32.612
and that's what we try and do
and remember ourselves to do--

00:34:32.612 --> 00:34:33.820
have you checked out Polaris?

00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:35.170
Do you know what Polaris is?

00:34:35.170 --> 00:34:37.960
Maybe show them, and then they
start using it on their own.

00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:38.710
MATTHEW KAM: Yeah.

00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:39.850
I mean, do you guys have--

00:34:39.850 --> 00:34:42.429
I mean, at a system
level, do you actually

00:34:42.429 --> 00:34:44.710
have a way to designate
certain of those nuggets

00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:47.500
as golden nuggets so
that they surface?

00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:49.250
TOMER SHARON: It's
just jargon between us.

00:34:49.250 --> 00:34:50.560
MATTHEW KAM: OK.

00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:51.406
Yeah.

00:34:51.406 --> 00:34:52.989
So what are some of
the considerations

00:34:52.989 --> 00:34:55.840
around personally-identifiable
information?

00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:59.672
I mean, I saw that you guys had
to just black out the faces.

00:34:59.672 --> 00:35:01.630
TOMER SHARON: That's only
for the presentation.

00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:04.720
But that's a challenge.

00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:08.500
I mean, we cover the identity
of the person itself.

00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:12.600
So the member, the
company name is not--

00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:16.720
it's kind of encrypted
throughout a code.

00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:19.030
And the same for
the person's name.

00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:22.570
We don't even add
it to the system.

00:35:22.570 --> 00:35:26.110
That said, if you are-- our
people in the buildings are

00:35:26.110 --> 00:35:29.340
called community teams-- if
you're a community manager,

00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:32.020
and you see a video of a
member from your building,

00:35:32.020 --> 00:35:33.340
you would know them.

00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:36.760
Even though you have a thousand
members, you would know them.

00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:40.190
So we are always concerned with
people taking it the wrong way,

00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:42.205
especially if the
feedback or the nugget

00:35:42.205 --> 00:35:45.580
is talking about you,
the community manager.

00:35:45.580 --> 00:35:50.110
So we ask the people we talk
with not to mention names.

00:35:50.110 --> 00:35:52.370
So just say, so we
say, for example,

00:35:52.370 --> 00:35:57.040
if you have feedback about
your community manager,

00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:01.960
use that term, my community
manager, don't use a name.

00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:04.044
They don't always follow
instructions, but we try.

00:36:04.044 --> 00:36:06.334
MATTHEW KAM: What do you guys
do about evidence if they

00:36:06.334 --> 00:36:07.900
don't follow instructions?

00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:13.090
TOMER SHARON: So it's something
we have to cut and not include.

00:36:13.090 --> 00:36:16.390
Because we don't want
people to use it as,

00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:18.640
I saw you saying
something bad about me.

00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:20.677
Why are you doing that?

00:36:20.677 --> 00:36:21.760
That's always a challenge.

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:24.620
But at least the name
and the company name,

00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:26.740
they're not included in Polaris.

00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:27.670
They can't see that.

00:36:27.670 --> 00:36:28.840
MATTHEW KAM: OK.

00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:31.260
So going, I think,
to more broader

00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:32.810
organizational-wide
issues, what do

00:36:32.810 --> 00:36:34.810
you see as some of the
necessary conditions that

00:36:34.810 --> 00:36:37.300
need to be in place
for organizations

00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:42.520
to actually adopt your ideas
around Polaris effectively?

00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:49.530
TOMER SHARON: Honestly,
I couldn't care less.

00:36:49.530 --> 00:36:52.860
I mean, it's really honestly.

00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:55.620
I'll tell you that
when I describe Polaris

00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:58.770
to important people at WeWork,
I was asked not to do it,

00:36:58.770 --> 00:37:01.020
before we did it.

00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:05.100
This is something that I'm
sure all the researchers here

00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:10.290
are not foreign to the
problems that I describe.

00:37:10.290 --> 00:37:12.480
These are problems
that are happening

00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:14.640
for many years in
many companies.

00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:17.580
And it was very clear to
us that this is something

00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:19.470
that WeWork would benefit from.

00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:22.860
So if the company
is doing research,

00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:25.860
or is beginning to do
research, it's relevant.

00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:29.260
Other considerations, I
think everything is solvable.

00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:31.500
We have challenges with
making people aware of it,

00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:33.399
but that's something
we need to deal with.

00:37:33.399 --> 00:37:34.690
This is what the company needs.

00:37:34.690 --> 00:37:36.090
This is the healthy food.

00:37:36.090 --> 00:37:39.014
They need it, although
it's not tasty at first.

00:37:39.014 --> 00:37:39.680
MATTHEW KAM: OK.

00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:40.620
Wow.

00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:42.750
So do you know of any
other organizations

00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:46.106
that have already adopted
your ideas around Polaris?

00:37:46.106 --> 00:37:48.480
TOMER SHARON: Since we made
it public, a lot of companies

00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:50.220
contacted us.

00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:52.020
I don't really know if
they implemented it.

00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:58.590
But all of Google's
competitors kept in touch.

00:37:58.590 --> 00:38:01.090
I have no idea if they
did something about it.

00:38:01.090 --> 00:38:02.040
But there is interest.

00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:03.064
I don't really know.

00:38:03.064 --> 00:38:03.730
MATTHEW KAM: OK.

00:38:03.730 --> 00:38:06.021
And are you saying that as
a way to encourage us to try

00:38:06.021 --> 00:38:07.252
to adopt some of these ideas?

00:38:07.252 --> 00:38:08.460
TOMER SHARON: I'll be honest.

00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:13.440
I tried here but didn't
get a lot of traction.

00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:16.130
I think what you see here is--

00:38:16.130 --> 00:38:17.620
and we talked about it earlier--

00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:19.290
you see research archives.

00:38:19.290 --> 00:38:20.790
And these research
archives that you

00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:25.110
see here are archives that you
can just upload your report

00:38:25.110 --> 00:38:27.360
and maybe tagging,
I can't remember.

00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:28.110
MATTHEW KAM: Sure.

00:38:28.110 --> 00:38:31.350
We have tags.

00:38:31.350 --> 00:38:32.960
TOMER SHARON: I think
it's not enough.

00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:34.610
It's not atomic enough.

00:38:34.610 --> 00:38:37.445
And when you're
tagging, you're thinking

00:38:37.445 --> 00:38:39.070
about the entire
study, you're thinking

00:38:39.070 --> 00:38:40.080
about the entire report.

00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:42.550
The reports are long,
include many things,

00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:44.730
many insights, as I
described earlier, and so on.

00:38:44.730 --> 00:38:48.790
So I would say, no,
you don't have it.

00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:51.790
And maybe it's an opportunity.

00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:52.980
MATTHEW KAM: OK.

00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:54.775
Well, so we have
15 minutes left.

00:38:54.775 --> 00:38:57.150
And I just want to make sure
that members of the audience

00:38:57.150 --> 00:38:59.580
get to ask any questions
that you guys have.

00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:02.200
So we have mics on the
two ends of the room.

00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:04.190
Feel free to just step
out and ask a question

00:39:04.190 --> 00:39:08.133
so that the rest of the room
can hear your questions.

00:39:08.133 --> 00:39:09.486
OK.

00:39:09.486 --> 00:39:13.032
AUDIENCE: I'm in an organization
that loves research reports.

00:39:13.032 --> 00:39:14.550
And I'd love to
know a little bit,

00:39:14.550 --> 00:39:18.250
besides just developing a
tool, how you weaned people off

00:39:18.250 --> 00:39:20.570
of their dependency on reports?

00:39:20.570 --> 00:39:22.362
TOMER SHARON: Why do
they love the reports?

00:39:22.362 --> 00:39:23.736
I'm sure they
don't love reports.

00:39:23.736 --> 00:39:24.722
They love the research.

00:39:24.722 --> 00:39:25.930
AUDIENCE: Because it's known.

00:39:25.930 --> 00:39:28.320
It's the familiar way that
they're used to digesting--

00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:30.403
TOMER SHARON: You're talking
about the researchers

00:39:30.403 --> 00:39:32.330
or the consumers of research?

00:39:32.330 --> 00:39:36.969
AUDIENCE: Consumers of research,
internal clients of research.

00:39:36.969 --> 00:39:39.260
TOMER SHARON: To me, the
biggest insult as a researcher

00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:43.830
is when people read a report
and they say, mm, interesting.

00:39:43.830 --> 00:39:45.580
I want it to be actionable.

00:39:45.580 --> 00:39:50.000
And I think that if
you track and see--

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:55.130
I'm not going to grill you here,
but are they doing anything

00:39:55.130 --> 00:39:56.870
with these research reports?

00:39:56.870 --> 00:39:59.630
If the answer is no
or not really or not

00:39:59.630 --> 00:40:03.710
what you expected,
then I would say

00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:05.660
don't listen to what
they say about reports.

00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:09.590
Look at their behavior, as you
know, and treat them as users,

00:40:09.590 --> 00:40:11.840
treat this as a
design challenge,

00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:13.660
and see what you
can do about it.

00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:16.200
Polaris is not the
only answer, I'm sure.

00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:18.590
It's just one possible answer.

00:40:18.590 --> 00:40:21.980
If reports work for them and
you're happy and they're happy,

00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:25.450
don't wind them off of that.

00:40:25.450 --> 00:40:26.930
MATTHEW KAM: OK.

00:40:26.930 --> 00:40:27.430
Thanks.

00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:29.388
AUDIENCE: Thanks, Tomer,
for your presentation.

00:40:29.388 --> 00:40:30.690
I think it's super interesting.

00:40:30.690 --> 00:40:33.420
And of course, as
researcher, I'm

00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:38.440
always looking for any tool that
can help us not only capture

00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:42.130
feedback, but also communicate
it with my stakeholders.

00:40:42.130 --> 00:40:44.820
I noticed one of the
images that you had,

00:40:44.820 --> 00:40:47.570
that you have a device,
a physical device in one

00:40:47.570 --> 00:40:48.715
of the phone rooms.

00:40:48.715 --> 00:40:49.465
TOMER SHARON: Yes.

00:40:49.465 --> 00:40:51.100
AUDIENCE: So two questions.

00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:54.980
One is, how does it work?

00:40:54.980 --> 00:40:57.340
How is this
connected to Polaris?

00:40:57.340 --> 00:41:00.520
And second, why using
a physical device

00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:04.850
instead of sending a
survey to the consumers?

00:41:04.850 --> 00:41:06.740
TOMER SHARON: Very,
very, very good question.

00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:13.420
So the product that is WeWork
has many, many details,

00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:16.150
many, many things
that create it.

00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:18.980
We think it's
hundreds of things.

00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:21.220
It's the beer and
it's the chairs

00:41:21.220 --> 00:41:24.490
and it's the wallpaper
and the events

00:41:24.490 --> 00:41:27.820
and the community team
and so many other things.

00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:32.980
It doesn't make any sense to ask
about 500 things in a survey.

00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:35.380
Nobody would complete it.

00:41:35.380 --> 00:41:38.200
That's one reason
we don't solely

00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:43.390
use surveys for these
quantitative measurements.

00:41:43.390 --> 00:41:47.830
We also know that, especially
for physical things and objects

00:41:47.830 --> 00:41:51.130
and spaces, the best
way to collect feedback

00:41:51.130 --> 00:41:54.310
is there, in context.

00:41:54.310 --> 00:41:57.200
So imagine a conference room.

00:41:57.200 --> 00:41:58.800
So you booked a conference room.

00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:00.990
Let's say the next time
you book a conference room,

00:42:00.990 --> 00:42:04.510
you have a pop-up question
on your screen that asks you,

00:42:04.510 --> 00:42:07.180
how was your recent experience
with the conference room you

00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:12.280
just used, maybe five days ago?

00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:13.400
We have that.

00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:17.690
But we learned from members
that, in many cases, first,

00:42:17.690 --> 00:42:22.090
they don't remember
how was the experience.

00:42:22.090 --> 00:42:26.590
And two, the person
who is booking the room

00:42:26.590 --> 00:42:29.630
is not necessarily the
person who is using it.

00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:31.510
So the feedback is very biased.

00:42:31.510 --> 00:42:33.460
So in context is the best.

00:42:33.460 --> 00:42:35.470
Because we know
you're there, we know

00:42:35.470 --> 00:42:38.980
you just used the room, give us
your feedback, and that's it.

00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:41.260
That said, it's not
connected to Polaris.

00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:44.890
This is a different system
that gathers all this data

00:42:44.890 --> 00:42:48.260
about scoring different
spaces and other things.

00:42:48.260 --> 00:42:51.070
And then you get a score for
different things and locations

00:42:51.070 --> 00:42:52.570
and regions and so on.

00:42:52.570 --> 00:42:55.300
From there, we take
that and we link

00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:58.510
that with a relevant
Polaris, or we would--

00:42:58.510 --> 00:43:00.580
that's not connected
yet, that's the vision--

00:43:00.580 --> 00:43:03.600
connect that to a Polaris
playlist, as I said.

00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:07.060
So if you see the
data about beer

00:43:07.060 --> 00:43:11.350
is flowing to and creating
that score in the dashboard

00:43:11.350 --> 00:43:12.900
somewhere.

00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:15.790
And then that score, you'll
have a link next to it

00:43:15.790 --> 00:43:20.800
that will connect you to a
playlist about beer in Polaris.

00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:24.000
And these devices are
based on-- we created them.

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.890
These are Amazon Dash
buttons, and the casing

00:43:26.890 --> 00:43:28.384
is something we designed.

00:43:28.384 --> 00:43:30.130
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:43:30.130 --> 00:43:32.034
MATTHEW KAM: OK.

00:43:32.034 --> 00:43:35.930
AUDIENCE: So one of the things
that reports sometimes will do

00:43:35.930 --> 00:43:38.280
is give you the background
of the research that happens

00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:40.810
and action items that
happen afterwards.

00:43:40.810 --> 00:43:43.640
How do you see your
tool taking into account

00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:46.766
when significant change
or impact has already come

00:43:46.766 --> 00:43:48.196
from the nuggets that exist?

00:43:48.196 --> 00:43:50.570
TOMER SHARON: So that's this
democracy I'm talking about.

00:43:50.570 --> 00:43:52.921
I'm almost eliminating the
researcher from the equation

00:43:52.921 --> 00:43:53.420
here.

00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:56.820
I want the person
who is watching--

00:43:56.820 --> 00:43:59.810
creating the
playlist, watching it,

00:43:59.810 --> 00:44:02.160
and deciding what to do next--

00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:05.330
I want them to create
that for themselves.

00:44:05.330 --> 00:44:08.600
They decide-- they know
what happened before, they

00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:10.160
know about the background.

00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:13.160
And they know what they can
learn from what they just saw.

00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:15.790
The researcher is
there to help them.

00:44:15.790 --> 00:44:19.160
My idea is that
everyone's a researcher.

00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:20.570
I want everyone to do that.

00:44:20.570 --> 00:44:22.910
Currently, we're kind
of in a transition mode

00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:26.060
where researchers
and other UX people

00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:29.630
are contributing or
adding nuggets to Polaris.

00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:33.416
But as the consumer
of it, let's say--

00:44:33.416 --> 00:44:35.540
let's equate it to what's
happening here, a product

00:44:35.540 --> 00:44:38.000
manager or an engineering
team or whoever

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:41.660
is deciding something
about a product,

00:44:41.660 --> 00:44:44.900
I see them as the
ones that almost

00:44:44.900 --> 00:44:46.160
write these for themselves.

00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:47.990
It doesn't have
to be in writing,

00:44:47.990 --> 00:44:51.260
has to be an understanding
that they have, what they know,

00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:54.380
what this can help
them with, what

00:44:54.380 --> 00:44:57.680
decisions they can take
based on that, and so on.

00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:02.150
That's exactly the
democracy I talked about.

00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:06.290
At least when we use Polaris
the way I'm describing it,

00:45:06.290 --> 00:45:11.870
those decisions are not in
the hands of researchers

00:45:11.870 --> 00:45:13.640
to write and report.

00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:16.970
This is in the
hands of consumers,

00:45:16.970 --> 00:45:20.760
people who are actually deciding
what to do with the products.

00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:22.010
AUDIENCE: One quick follow-up.

00:45:22.010 --> 00:45:24.830
I guess how do you
prevent duplicate research

00:45:24.830 --> 00:45:28.930
from happening around
or at the same time?

00:45:28.930 --> 00:45:31.850
So say if a community
manager in Chicago

00:45:31.850 --> 00:45:36.600
goes through some nuggets
on beer and decides to take

00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:39.540
action based on those nuggets,
and then a community manager

00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:43.550
here does the same thing,
does it duplicate the work?

00:45:43.550 --> 00:45:47.430
Or do you think they're just
building on top of each other?

00:45:47.430 --> 00:45:50.500
TOMER SHARON: So when it comes
to what we call consumables--

00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:52.970
beer, coffee, and so on--

00:45:52.970 --> 00:45:55.480
it's not that every building
is deciding-- not always

00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:58.210
every building is
deciding what to buy.

00:45:58.210 --> 00:46:01.510
It's being centralized, so
it's not really about them.

00:46:01.510 --> 00:46:03.910
But if two different
people decide

00:46:03.910 --> 00:46:06.167
to improve the
member experience,

00:46:06.167 --> 00:46:07.000
that's a good thing.

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.320
That didn't happen before,
so that's a good thing.

00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:10.840
I don't see that as a problem.

00:46:10.840 --> 00:46:15.150
Consistency is not
necessarily a must, always.

00:46:15.150 --> 00:46:15.870
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:46:15.870 --> 00:46:17.090
I actually have a
similar question.

00:46:17.090 --> 00:46:18.006
And just to follow up.

00:46:18.006 --> 00:46:21.140
So I'm curious, can those
community managers actually

00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:25.190
track that so they're aware of
what's happening and what's--

00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:26.366
TOMER SHARON: Track what?

00:46:26.366 --> 00:46:27.740
AUDIENCE: The
outcomes or actions

00:46:27.740 --> 00:46:30.372
taken based on the nuggets.

00:46:30.372 --> 00:46:31.814
TOMER SHARON: Not
in Polaris, no.

00:46:31.814 --> 00:46:33.230
AUDIENCE: So you
can't necessarily

00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:35.739
see how someone else--

00:46:35.739 --> 00:46:36.238
OK.

00:46:36.238 --> 00:46:36.946
TOMER SHARON: No.

00:46:36.946 --> 00:46:39.580
AUDIENCE: Do you think
that's important, or no?

00:46:39.580 --> 00:46:42.070
TOMER SHARON: I think
WeWork has a lot of systems

00:46:42.070 --> 00:46:43.810
in place for doing that.

00:46:43.810 --> 00:46:45.560
We're not trying-- I
think it's important.

00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:48.142
We're not trying to
solve that with Polaris.

00:46:48.142 --> 00:46:48.850
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:46:48.850 --> 00:46:53.170
TOMER SHARON: We thought
about adding a feature, which

00:46:53.170 --> 00:46:56.530
was there for maybe two
minutes and then we removed it,

00:46:56.530 --> 00:47:00.340
of allowing people who use a
certain playlist that indicates

00:47:00.340 --> 00:47:04.420
a certain problem to raise their
hand digitally in the system,

00:47:04.420 --> 00:47:09.100
as people want to be a part of
a team that solves the problem.

00:47:09.100 --> 00:47:10.660
But then we were
afraid that Polaris

00:47:10.660 --> 00:47:13.519
is going to become instead
of a research tool,

00:47:13.519 --> 00:47:15.310
it's going to be a
project management tool,

00:47:15.310 --> 00:47:19.222
so we stopped there.

00:47:19.222 --> 00:47:20.085
MATTHEW KAM: OK.

00:47:20.085 --> 00:47:20.626
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:47:20.626 --> 00:47:22.030
TOMER SHARON: Hey.

00:47:22.030 --> 00:47:26.510
AUDIENCE: So any evidence
on how this has changed

00:47:26.510 --> 00:47:28.440
research reports at WeWork?

00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:29.320
Is it dead?

00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:30.490
TOMER SHARON: It
changed research reports

00:47:30.490 --> 00:47:31.950
because we just
don't write them.

00:47:31.950 --> 00:47:33.760
AUDIENCE: So yeah,
I'm curi-- how

00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:36.980
has that changed the culture?

00:47:36.980 --> 00:47:39.340
TOMER SHARON: For anything
that happens in my group,

00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:41.650
we don't write research report.

00:47:41.650 --> 00:47:43.450
It's really, really
hard for some people.

00:47:43.450 --> 00:47:46.090
But we're overcoming that.

00:47:46.090 --> 00:47:48.870
And instead of writing
a research report,

00:47:48.870 --> 00:47:53.140
if we really have the urge,
we just create a playlist.

00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:56.230
And then if we
want to add things

00:47:56.230 --> 00:47:58.720
that we would have
added to our report,

00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:02.050
we add it as a feature
request for Polaris,

00:48:02.050 --> 00:48:06.460
and we make that happen, if
it's really, really needed.

00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:10.660
That makes us-- we ask ourselves
very hard questions sometimes.

00:48:10.660 --> 00:48:12.220
What is evidence, for example.

00:48:12.220 --> 00:48:16.300
Do we really need-- so
there was one request to add

00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:19.000
multiple files as evidence.

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:22.360
Do we really need three photos
that show the same thing

00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:23.950
from different angles?

00:48:23.950 --> 00:48:25.510
Not always.

00:48:25.510 --> 00:48:28.990
Do we need a photo combined
with an audio file?

00:48:28.990 --> 00:48:30.690
Maybe.

00:48:30.690 --> 00:48:31.510
And so on.

00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:36.080
But yeah, for anything
related to my group,

00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:38.450
we don't write research reports.

00:48:38.450 --> 00:48:40.340
The hardest thing,
by the way, is

00:48:40.340 --> 00:48:45.050
when we share that
with executives

00:48:45.050 --> 00:48:47.770
that are used to
reading reports,

00:48:47.770 --> 00:48:50.180
it's sometimes a
process and education

00:48:50.180 --> 00:48:53.660
is involved in communicating
that this is the report.

00:48:53.660 --> 00:48:55.500
This playlist,
this is the report.

00:48:55.500 --> 00:48:56.000
That's it.

00:48:58.911 --> 00:49:00.410
AUDIENCE: Just a
follow-up question.

00:49:00.410 --> 00:49:01.201
TOMER SHARON: Yeah.

00:49:01.201 --> 00:49:04.440
AUDIENCE: So in terms
of decision making,

00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:11.230
how do you prevent product
managers or decision makers

00:49:11.230 --> 00:49:17.350
to take what users said,
what the community says

00:49:17.350 --> 00:49:21.350
at face value without
further analysis,

00:49:21.350 --> 00:49:23.971
or maybe without checking
the golden nuggets you

00:49:23.971 --> 00:49:26.410
were mentioning?

00:49:26.410 --> 00:49:28.210
TOMER SHARON: So
I'm sure you know

00:49:28.210 --> 00:49:34.000
that what users say that is
the solution to their problem

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:36.970
is, in many cases, not the
solution to the problem.

00:49:36.970 --> 00:49:40.420
So we UX-ers know
that, so we don't even

00:49:40.420 --> 00:49:46.900
include that in the nuggets,
so they won't see that.

00:49:46.900 --> 00:49:47.990
It is a process.

00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:49.900
This is why we work
with these teams.

00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:53.650
It is a process to
teach people and mentor

00:49:53.650 --> 00:49:57.130
people on how to make
sense out of a playlist.

00:49:57.130 --> 00:50:04.420
And I should say, even for
a very basic usability test,

00:50:04.420 --> 00:50:07.710
if you put people in a
room or watch videos,

00:50:07.710 --> 00:50:10.480
whatever, who are not
researchers, not UX-ers,

00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:14.050
never seen a usability test,
they see videos of people using

00:50:14.050 --> 00:50:18.690
their product, after an
hour of watching these,

00:50:18.690 --> 00:50:22.110
they will have
enough information

00:50:22.110 --> 00:50:25.390
to come up with decisions on
what to change in the product.

00:50:25.390 --> 00:50:29.560
And these will be very good
decisions in 99% of the cases.

00:50:29.560 --> 00:50:31.920
So I'm not concerned
about that at all.

00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:33.480
MATTHEW KAM: OK,
one last question.

00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:36.030
AUDIENCE: How do you have
researchers make-- or do

00:50:36.030 --> 00:50:39.000
you have researchers
making editorial decisions

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:40.250
about what's worth putting in?

00:50:40.250 --> 00:50:42.500
So if you have a study,
three out of five, four out

00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:46.470
of five, or one out
of five run into this,

00:50:46.470 --> 00:50:48.280
do you pick one
that's representative

00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:50.315
and put that in as a
problem and flag it?

00:50:50.315 --> 00:50:51.920
Do you put all
three in combined?

00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:54.120
What does that look like?

00:50:54.120 --> 00:50:56.670
TOMER SHARON: Most of the
nuggets that go into Polaris

00:50:56.670 --> 00:50:59.650
are not coming from studies.

00:50:59.650 --> 00:51:02.550
They're coming with ongoing
conversations and interviews

00:51:02.550 --> 00:51:05.360
we have with members,
mostly with--

00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:07.290
we call them graduating
members, with members

00:51:07.290 --> 00:51:10.120
who've decided to leave us.

00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:12.900
We think not because they're
pissed at us, necessarily.

00:51:12.900 --> 00:51:15.480
We think this is
a good time for us

00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:17.310
to talk with them
because they understand

00:51:17.310 --> 00:51:19.050
what worked well
at WeWork and what

00:51:19.050 --> 00:51:21.310
worked not so well at WeWork.

00:51:21.310 --> 00:51:22.770
So this is not a study.

00:51:22.770 --> 00:51:25.450
This is something
we do all the time.

00:51:25.450 --> 00:51:29.640
And it's almost never a one
out of five, two out of five,

00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:30.900
three out of five thing.

00:51:30.900 --> 00:51:35.040
That comes to play when
you search for nuggets

00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:36.570
and create playlists.

00:51:36.570 --> 00:51:41.890
So that's the example I gave
with the tours and coffee.

00:51:41.890 --> 00:51:44.190
You see three nuggets,
that's your three.

00:51:44.190 --> 00:51:44.760
That's it.

00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:47.324
That's evidence that the only
three nuggets about bad coffee,

00:51:47.324 --> 00:51:47.865
I don't know.

00:51:47.865 --> 00:51:51.180
Then probably it's
not a problem.

00:51:51.180 --> 00:51:54.510
And it's very rarely that we--

00:51:54.510 --> 00:51:58.300
I mean, not rarely-- but we
sometimes do these studies

00:51:58.300 --> 00:52:00.940
and then we just don't take it
as one out of five, three out

00:52:00.940 --> 00:52:01.440
of five.

00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:05.520
We just look at, let's say,
an interview or observation

00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:08.867
or whatever it is, and we
just derive these nuggets,

00:52:08.867 --> 00:52:09.450
and that's it.

00:52:09.450 --> 00:52:12.480
And then they go into
Polaris into the ether,

00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:14.430
and then anyone can
search and create

00:52:14.430 --> 00:52:16.744
whatever they want with them.

00:52:16.744 --> 00:52:17.410
MATTHEW KAM: OK.

00:52:17.410 --> 00:52:20.120
Yeah, I just want to end about
three minutes before the hour

00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:22.190
so that there's enough
time for interested folks

00:52:22.190 --> 00:52:25.190
to check out copies
of his book behind.

00:52:25.190 --> 00:52:27.800
So with that, please join me
in thanking Tomer once again

00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:28.760
for joining us today.

00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:30.228
TOMER SHARON: Thanks, Matt.

00:52:30.228 --> 00:52:30.728
Thank you.

00:52:30.728 --> 00:52:31.852
MATTHEW KAM: Thanks, Tomer.

00:52:31.852 --> 00:52:33.470
[APPLAUSE]
