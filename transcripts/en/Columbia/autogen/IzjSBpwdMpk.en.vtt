how we would spend our time this evening

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920
how we would spend our time this evening
 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.550
how we would spend our time this evening
that is to say how I'd spend my part of

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560
that is to say how I'd spend my part of
 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.110
that is to say how I'd spend my part of
the time and then you could ask what you

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120
the time and then you could ask what you
 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.890
the time and then you could ask what you
want to ask and I thought of focusing on

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900
want to ask and I thought of focusing on
 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.810
want to ask and I thought of focusing on
one case like the North Korean case or

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820
one case like the North Korean case or
 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.770
one case like the North Korean case or
the Pakistan case or the Iran case the

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780
the Pakistan case or the Iran case the
 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.850
the Pakistan case or the Iran case the
rock case but I thought I'd try

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860
rock case but I thought I'd try
 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.390
rock case but I thought I'd try
something different which is to offer a

something different which is to offer a
sort of framework for how I think you

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580
sort of framework for how I think you
 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.660
sort of framework for how I think you
might think about the proliferation of

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670
might think about the proliferation of
 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.009
might think about the proliferation of
nuclear weapons it isn't particularly

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019

rigorous but it it it seems to me that

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190
rigorous but it it it seems to me that
 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.430
rigorous but it it it seems to me that
there were three ways of approaching

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440
there were three ways of approaching
 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.290
there were three ways of approaching
proliferation and I recollect there were

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300
proliferation and I recollect there were
 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.470
proliferation and I recollect there were
three policy responses over years now

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480
three policy responses over years now
 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.870
three policy responses over years now

then this is not causal I didn't cause

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769
then this is not causal I didn't cause
 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:48.130
then this is not causal I didn't cause
this nothing to do with it but the

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140
this nothing to do with it but the

three different approaches to the
 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.430
three different approaches to the
proliferation issue and I want to

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440
proliferation issue and I want to
 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.680
proliferation issue and I want to
describe those to you and and so

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690
describe those to you and and so
 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.600
describe those to you and and so
intellectually where we word how we have

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610
intellectually where we word how we have
 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.069
intellectually where we word how we have
thought about this over the years and

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079
thought about this over the years and
 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.360
thought about this over the years and
then place us now in that context and

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370
then place us now in that context and
 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.310
then place us now in that context and
then we can have a discussion about the

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320
then we can have a discussion about the
 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.830
then we can have a discussion about the
now stuff for the historical stuff if

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840
now stuff for the historical stuff if
 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.190
now stuff for the historical stuff if

first approach to the proliferation
issue seems to me the inevitably the

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010
issue seems to me the inevitably the
 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.170
issue seems to me the inevitably the
systemic approach it is one that

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180
systemic approach it is one that
 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.280
systemic approach it is one that
proceeds from the proposition that

well what happens is that there is a
core of fissile material and then a

00:26:13.270 --> 00:26:13.280
core of fissile material and then a
 

00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:14.799

00:26:14.809 --> 00:26:17.860

than was around 30 years ago but we're

25 years ago so i think that the threat

01:05:26.620 --> 01:05:26.630
25 years ago so i think that the threat
 

01:05:26.630 --> 01:05:31.650

get the best price on uranium and the

01:07:20.779 --> 01:07:20.789
get the best price on uranium and the
 

01:07:20.789 --> 01:07:23.359
get the best price on uranium and the
best price on enrichment services for

01:07:23.359 --> 01:07:23.369
best price on enrichment services for
 

01:07:23.369 --> 01:07:25.279
best price on enrichment services for
reprocessing the argument goes that

01:07:25.279 --> 01:07:25.289
reprocessing the argument goes that
 

01:07:25.289 --> 01:07:28.670
reprocessing the argument goes that
there is no economic argument right now

01:07:28.670 --> 01:07:28.680
there is no economic argument right now
 

01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:31.430
there is no economic argument right now
for reprocessing there might be one

01:07:31.430 --> 01:07:31.440
for reprocessing there might be one
 

01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:33.650
for reprocessing there might be one
eventually depending on the price of

eventually depending on the price of
uranium I what I didn't explain here is

01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:35.970
uranium I what I didn't explain here is
 

01:07:35.970 --> 01:07:38.960
uranium I what I didn't explain here is
that they're the reason why countries

01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:38.970
that they're the reason why countries
 

01:07:38.970 --> 01:07:40.999
that they're the reason why countries
might want to recover the plutonium is

01:07:40.999 --> 01:07:41.009
might want to recover the plutonium is
 

01:07:41.009 --> 01:07:43.670
might want to recover the plutonium is
the plutonium is a fissile material

01:07:43.670 --> 01:07:43.680
the plutonium is a fissile material
 

01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:45.859
the plutonium is a fissile material
which means it visions with fast or slow

01:07:45.859 --> 01:07:45.869
which means it visions with fast or slow
 

01:07:45.869 --> 01:07:50.120
which means it visions with fast or slow
neutrons like uranium-235 the fissile

01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:50.130
neutrons like uranium-235 the fissile
 

01:07:50.130 --> 01:07:53.269
neutrons like uranium-235 the fissile
isotope of natural uranium and so when

01:07:53.269 --> 01:07:53.279
isotope of natural uranium and so when
 

01:07:53.279 --> 01:07:58.989
isotope of natural uranium and so when
you have plutonium you can replace the

01:07:58.989 --> 01:07:58.999
you have plutonium you can replace the
 

01:07:58.999 --> 01:08:01.690
you have plutonium you can replace the
uranium-235 that you would have

01:08:01.690 --> 01:08:01.700
uranium-235 that you would have
 

01:08:01.700 --> 01:08:05.989
uranium-235 that you would have
increased in content in proportion in in

01:08:05.989 --> 01:08:05.999
increased in content in proportion in in
 

01:08:05.999 --> 01:08:07.880
increased in content in proportion in in
the uranium for the fuel of a low and

01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:07.890
the uranium for the fuel of a low and
 

01:08:07.890 --> 01:08:09.799
the uranium for the fuel of a low and
rich director with plutonium and

01:08:09.799 --> 01:08:09.809
rich director with plutonium and
 

01:08:09.809 --> 01:08:12.109
rich director with plutonium and
therefore you would need less uranium

01:08:12.109 --> 01:08:12.119
therefore you would need less uranium
 

01:08:12.119 --> 01:08:14.720
therefore you would need less uranium
and you wouldn't need as much in a way

01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:14.730
and you wouldn't need as much in a way
 

01:08:14.730 --> 01:08:17.059
and you wouldn't need as much in a way
of enrichment services so there's fuel

01:08:17.059 --> 01:08:17.069
of enrichment services so there's fuel
 

01:08:17.069 --> 01:08:19.849
of enrichment services so there's fuel
value in the plutonium but it's very

01:08:19.849 --> 01:08:19.859
value in the plutonium but it's very
 

01:08:19.859 --> 01:08:22.519
value in the plutonium but it's very
hard to make a economic case then it

01:08:22.519 --> 01:08:22.529
hard to make a economic case then it
 

01:08:22.529 --> 01:08:25.490
hard to make a economic case then it
makes sense these days until the price

01:08:25.490 --> 01:08:25.500
makes sense these days until the price
 

01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:27.320
makes sense these days until the price
of uranium enrichment services change

01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:27.330
of uranium enrichment services change
 

01:08:27.330 --> 01:08:29.599
of uranium enrichment services change
that's very contentious and people will

01:16:33.100 --> 01:16:35.280
model 1 2 and 3 so it has some component
of that but the issue you brought up

01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:35.290
of that but the issue you brought up
 

01:16:35.290 --> 01:16:37.890
of that but the issue you brought up
with the non-state actors that's today's

issue of HEU controlling that is one of
 

01:16:42.370 --> 01:16:44.760
issue of HEU controlling that is one of
the ways to to win that war but I was

01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:44.770
the ways to to win that war but I was
 

01:16:44.770 --> 01:16:45.570
the ways to to win that war but I was
wondering if there were other things

01:16:45.570 --> 01:16:45.580
wondering if there were other things
 

01:16:45.580 --> 01:16:48.270
wondering if there were other things
that you haven't that you like that you

that you haven't that you like that you
 

01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:49.980
that you haven't that you like that you
could address of other ways to control

the fissile material we might want to do
 

01:17:30.820 --> 01:17:32.840
the fissile material we might want to do
that because if we could do that we

that because if we could do that we
could announce that we could do that and

could announce that we could do that and
 

01:17:35.530 --> 01:17:38.490
could announce that we could do that and
we could in fact issue a sort of well
