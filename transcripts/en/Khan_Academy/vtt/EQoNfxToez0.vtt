00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.250
- [Voiceover] Slope is
defined as your change

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:05.880
in the vertical direction, and I could use

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.080
the Greek letter delta,
this little triangle here

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.650
is the Greek letter
delta, it means change in.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.020
Change in the vertical
direction divided by

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.490
change in the horizontal direction.

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.690
That is the standard definition of slope

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:22.490
and it's a reasonable way for measuring

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:24.250
how steep something is.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.290
So for example, if we're
looking at the xy plane here,

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:28.550
our change in the vertical direction

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.850
is gonna be a change in the y variable

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:33.120
divided by change in horizontal direction,

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.690
is gonna be a change in the x variable.

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.180
So let's see why that is a
good definition for slope.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.210
Well I could draw something
with a slope of one.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.640
A slope of one might
look something like...

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.620
so a slope of one, as x increases by one,

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.040
y increases by one, so a slope of one...

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:07.420
is going to look like this.

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.550
Notice, however much my change in x is,

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.810
so for example here, my
change in x is positive two,

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.480
I'm gonna have the same change in y.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.750
My change in y is going to be plus two.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.150
So my change in y divided by change in x

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.120
is two divided by two is one.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.680
So for this line I have
slope is equal to one.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.120
But what would a slope of two look like?

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.650
Well, a slope of two should be
steeper and we can draw that.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.120
Let me start at a different point,

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.670
so if I start over here a
slope of two would look like...

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.610
for every one that I
increase in the x direction

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.350
I'm gonna increase two in the y direction,

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.440
so it's going to look like...

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.550
that.

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.450
This line right over here, you see it.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.870
If my change in x is equal to one,

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.250
my change in y is two.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.110
So change in y over
change in x is gonna be

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.620
two over one, the slope here is two.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.290
And now, hopefully, you're appreciating

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.410
why this definition of
slope is a good one.

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.420
The higher the slope, the
steeper it is, the faster

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.420
it increases, the faster
we increase in the vertical

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.920
direction as we increase in
the horizontal direction.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.090
Now what would a negative slope be?

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.390
So let's just think about what a line

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.290
with a negative slope would mean.

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.150
A negative slope would mean,
well we could take an example.

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.150
If we have our change
in y over change in x

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.690
was equal to a negative one.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.110
That means that if we
have a change in x of one,

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.890
then in order to get
negative one here, that means

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.820
that our change in y would have
to be equal to negative one.

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.500
So a line with a negative
one slope would look like...

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.520
would look like this.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.520
Notice, as x increases
by a certain amount,

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.150
so our delta x here is one,

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.250
y decreases by that same
amount instead of increasing.

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.279
So now this is what we consider
a downward sloping line.

00:03:32.279 --> 00:03:35.619
So change in y is equal to negative one.

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:39.919
So our change in y over our change in x

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:42.159
is equal to negative one over one

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:43.789
which is equal to negative one.

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:45.989
So the slope of this line is negative one.

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.019
Now if you had a slope with negative two,

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:50.009
it would decrease even faster.

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:51.659
So a line with a slope of negative two

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:54.059
could look something like this.

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:00.089
So as x increases by one,
y would decrease by two.

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:04.609
So it would look something like...

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:11.019
it would look like that.

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:15.119
Notice, as our x increases
by a certain amount,

00:04:15.119 --> 00:04:20.019
our y decreases by twice as much.

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:24.259
So this right over here has a slope

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:26.549
of negative two.

00:04:26.549 --> 00:04:27.759
So hopefully this gives you a little bit

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:30.179
more intuition for what slope represents

00:04:30.179 --> 00:04:33.689
and how the number that
we use to represent slope,

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:36.089
how you can use that to
visualize how steep a line is.

00:04:36.089 --> 00:04:38.479
A very high positive
slope, as x increases,

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:41.789
y is going to increase
fairly dramatically.

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:43.769
If you have a negative slope...

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:49.259
as x increases, your y is
actually going to decrease.

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:50.859
And then the higher
the slope, the steeper,

00:04:53.109 --> 00:04:55.589
the more you increase as x increases,

00:04:55.589 --> 00:04:57.179
and the more negative the slope,

00:04:57.179 --> 00:05:00.669
the more you decrease as x increases.
