00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.891
- [Instructor] Nth derivative
of g at x equals zero is given

00:00:03.891 --> 00:00:08.075
by, so the nth derivative
of g evaluated x equals zero

00:00:08.075 --> 00:00:10.194
is equal to square root of n
plus seven over n to the third

00:00:10.194 --> 00:00:12.699
for n is greater than or equal to one.

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:15.890
What is the coefficient for
the term containing x squared

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.307
in the Maclaurin series of g?

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.450
Let's just think about the
Maclaurin series for g.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.729
If I were to have my function g of x.

00:00:26.729 --> 00:00:29.583
The Maclaurin series, I could
say approximately equal to

00:00:29.583 --> 00:00:31.938
especially if I'm not gonna
list out all of the terms,

00:00:31.938 --> 00:00:35.630
is going to be equal to,
well it's going to be equal

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.047
to g of zero plus g prime of zero times x

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:46.956
plus g prime prime of zero divided by,

00:00:48.854 --> 00:00:51.489
I could say two factorial
but that's just two,

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:54.416
times x squared, and that's
about as far as we go.

00:00:54.416 --> 00:00:56.259
Because we just have to think
about what is the coefficient

00:00:56.259 --> 00:00:57.972
for the term containing x squared.

00:00:57.972 --> 00:00:59.680
If they said what's the coefficient

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.865
for the term containing x to
the third, I would keep going.

00:01:01.865 --> 00:01:02.934
I'd go g prime.

00:01:02.934 --> 00:01:05.512
I would take the third
derivative evaluated at zero

00:01:05.512 --> 00:01:07.151
over three factorial.

00:01:07.151 --> 00:01:08.504
I could do this as a factorial too,

00:01:08.504 --> 00:01:10.027
but that just evaluates to two.

00:01:10.027 --> 00:01:12.042
I could do this as one factorial.

00:01:12.042 --> 00:01:14.849
I could do this as zero
factorial just so you see

00:01:14.849 --> 00:01:17.101
it's a consistent idea here.

00:01:17.101 --> 00:01:20.831
I could, of course, keep on
going, but we just care about,

00:01:20.831 --> 00:01:22.491
they're just asking us
what is the coefficient

00:01:22.491 --> 00:01:25.436
for the term containing x squared?

00:01:25.436 --> 00:01:27.831
They just want us to figure out this.

00:01:27.831 --> 00:01:29.845
What is this thing right over here?

00:01:29.845 --> 00:01:31.217
To know that, we need to figure out

00:01:31.217 --> 00:01:35.408
what is the second derivative
of g evaluated x equals zero?

00:01:35.408 --> 00:01:36.539
Well they tell us that over here.

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:38.474
It's a little bit unconventional

00:01:38.474 --> 00:01:41.814
where they give us a
formula, a general formula

00:01:41.814 --> 00:01:44.586
for any derivative
evaluated x equals zero,

00:01:44.586 --> 00:01:45.674
but that's what they're telling us here.

00:01:45.674 --> 00:01:48.596
So in this case, the n isn't zero.

00:01:48.596 --> 00:01:50.717
The n is the derivative we're
taking, and that's going

00:01:50.717 --> 00:01:54.166
to be our second derivative, so this is,

00:01:54.166 --> 00:01:56.749
so if I wanted to figure out g.

00:01:57.645 --> 00:02:01.896
If I am figuring out
the second derivative,

00:02:01.896 --> 00:02:04.462
and I could write it
like that evaluated zero,

00:02:04.462 --> 00:02:06.304
or I could write it like this

00:02:06.304 --> 00:02:08.582
just so the notation is consistent.

00:02:08.582 --> 00:02:10.549
I could write it like that.

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:14.383
The second derivative evaluated
x equals zero is going

00:02:14.383 --> 00:02:16.984
to be equal to, well our n is two,

00:02:16.984 --> 00:02:18.868
so this is going to be the square root

00:02:18.868 --> 00:02:22.701
of two plus seven over
two to the third power.

00:02:24.217 --> 00:02:27.668
Two plus seven is nine, take
the principle root of that.

00:02:27.668 --> 00:02:30.505
It's gonna give us positive
three over two to the third

00:02:30.505 --> 00:02:34.477
which is eight, so this
part right over here is 3/8,

00:02:34.477 --> 00:02:38.339
so the whole coefficient
is going to be 3/8,

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:42.901
that's this numerator,
divided by, divided by two.

00:02:42.901 --> 00:02:47.420
Which of course is equal
to 3/16, and we're done.

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.052
They didn't want us to
figure out a couple of terms

00:02:50.052 --> 00:02:52.810
of this which we could call
the Maclaurin polynomial

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.427
and nth degree Maclaurin polynomial.

00:02:54.427 --> 00:02:55.973
They didn't want us to
find the entire, you know,

00:02:55.973 --> 00:02:57.769
keep going with this series.

00:02:57.769 --> 00:02:59.771
They just wanted to find
one coefficient right here.

00:02:59.771 --> 00:03:02.276
The coefficient on the second degree term

00:03:02.276 --> 00:03:04.873
which we just figured out is 3/16.
