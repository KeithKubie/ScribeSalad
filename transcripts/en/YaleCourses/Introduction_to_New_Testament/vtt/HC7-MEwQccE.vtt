1
00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:02.190
Okay.

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.790
Last time I talked about the letter to the Hebrews and I used it mainly as an

3
00:00:08.581 --> 00:00:12.800
example of early Christian interpretation of scripture.
And if you'll recall,

4
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.610
I was talking about Hebrews seven where there's the story,

5
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.650
the interpretation of the Melk Kisa deck story from Genesis to review briefly.

6
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.370
Abraham comes back from a raid.
Uh,
he has a lot of booty.

7
00:00:26.371 --> 00:00:30.240
He has his relatives from defeating some kings.
He comes to milk Kisa deck,

8
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.350
who's not,
uh,
of course,
uh,
just in,
in a vapor ham.

9
00:00:34.351 --> 00:00:38.340
Therefore he's not a Jew.
He's not part of the people of Israel.
Uh,

10
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.810
but he is a priest,
high priest of Yahweh.
According to the text.

11
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.720
Mel Kizza deck gives him a 10th of the spoils.

12
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.250
And then this writer interprets that as being that since Levi,

13
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:51.421
the head of the,

14
00:00:51.421 --> 00:00:56.421
the progenitor of the priestly tribe in among the Jews is within the body of

15
00:00:58.081 --> 00:01:02.400
Abraham that needs,
that Levi himself is giving tithes to milk is a deck.

16
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.380
So the entire priesthood of the,
of the,
of Israel,

17
00:01:07.381 --> 00:01:12.381
of the Jews recognizes the superiority according to this interpretation of the

18
00:01:12.511 --> 00:01:15.600
priesthood of Melchizedek.
And then the writer takes them out.

19
00:01:15.601 --> 00:01:19.320
Kiradech to be a type a sign of Jesus and his priesthood.

20
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.500
And this makes perfect sense of course,
because as the text says,

21
00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.680
[inaudible] had no father or mother or the tech.
He doesn't give a,

22
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.010
it does give a father,
mother and no one know genealogy.

23
00:01:29.011 --> 00:01:30.380
No lineage came out of north.

24
00:01:30.381 --> 00:01:34.020
So the same way happens with Christ as the priesthood.
Christ is not.

25
00:01:34.021 --> 00:01:36.930
Jesus' of course,
was not of the tribe of Levi according.

26
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.770
So Jesus couldn't be a tribe in the norm.
Um,
uh,

27
00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.910
a priest in the normal sense of the Jewish priesthood.

28
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.820
So the writer takes Jesus to be a priest,

29
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.410
not of the represent the line of Levi or Aaron,

30
00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.200
but of the line of milk is a deck.
Now,

31
00:01:55.201 --> 00:01:59.790
this obviously is not the way any of us in the modern world who had read genesis

32
00:01:59.791 --> 00:02:03.240
and its historical setting that's precisely to the way this reader does it.

33
00:02:03.241 --> 00:02:05.400
And it's all part of a synchronous,

34
00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.640
a comparison of the led toward Ghia,

35
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:13.450
the liturgy of Christ with the inferior let tore Ghia,

36
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.910
our liturgy of the Jews.
So,
and it's done.

37
00:02:17.911 --> 00:02:22.050
So to convince this congregation that you don't need to go back to that you've

38
00:02:22.051 --> 00:02:25.910
got something superior.
So Hebrews ends with this kind of,
um,

39
00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.170
admonition in a chapter 13

40
00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.560
a chapter 13 verse eight.

41
00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.720
Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever.
Now remember,

42
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.650
this writer believes that Jesus Christ has existed all the way back.

43
00:02:43.651 --> 00:02:47.340
So that's why he can read the psalms,
which a historian would be,

44
00:02:47.341 --> 00:02:51.660
would read his address to a Davidic king as being addressed actually to Jesus.

45
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.190
So Jesus crosses back in history to do not be carried away by all kinds of

46
00:02:56.191 --> 00:02:59.800
strange teachings for it as well.
For the heart to be strengthened by grace,

47
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.270
not by regulations about food are,
you don't need to keep kosher,

48
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.240
which have not benefited those who observe them.

49
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.220
We have an altar from which those who officiate in the tent.

50
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:16.870
See that's referring to that tabernacle,
the tent of Tabernacle in an exodus,

51
00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.340
which has been comparing all the way through.

52
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.360
We have an alter from which those who officiate in the tent,
that is the Levi.

53
00:03:22.361 --> 00:03:27.250
It's have no right to eat for the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought

54
00:03:27.251 --> 00:03:32.251
into the sanctuary by the high priest as a sacrifice for sin are burned outside

55
00:03:32.351 --> 00:03:37.240
the camp.
When you sacrifice an animal according to the exodus instructions,

56
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:42.270
you don't burn them the materials of the sacrifice inside the camp.

57
00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:43.630
You do it outside the camp.

58
00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.170
So he's going to do something like that to therefore Jesus also suffered,

59
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.180
were outside the gates of Jerusalem.

60
00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.880
So now Jerusalem has become like the Israelite camp,
talked about an exodus,

61
00:03:57.881 --> 00:04:02.881
and Jesus is the sacrifice who has sacrificed on the cross outside the walls of

62
00:04:03.371 --> 00:04:06.830
Jerusalem.
Um,

63
00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.160
Jesus suffered outside the city gates in order to sanctify the people by his own

64
00:04:12.161 --> 00:04:14.350
blood.
Let us then,

65
00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.180
now this is really a really big period on this whole speech.

66
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:23.770
Let us then go to him outside the camp.

67
00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.550
Basically,
he is symbolically saying,

68
00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.520
let us follow Jesus out of Jerusalem,

69
00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.250
out of the camp of the Israelites.

70
00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.020
Now this is much more radically,
uh,

71
00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.040
supersessionism than we've seen in Paul.

72
00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.270
I've taught that Paul never saw himself as a Christian.

73
00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:49.450
He never saw himself as starting something new.
In fact,

74
00:04:49.451 --> 00:04:53.020
he saw himself as as bringing the gentiles into Israel.

75
00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.470
And so he never,
uh,
although they didn't have to keep the law,

76
00:04:56.471 --> 00:04:58.600
they didn't have to keep Torah.
They didn't have to be circumcised.
In fact,

77
00:04:58.601 --> 00:05:02.410
they weren't supposed to at all be circumcised.
Paul never thought,

78
00:05:02.411 --> 00:05:07.411
he never talks in this way about the super session of a new kind of liturgy from

79
00:05:08.471 --> 00:05:12.130
an old kind of liturgy.
But so when you talk about Christian,

80
00:05:12.131 --> 00:05:16.300
super session is kind of language and that the term just means the Christian

81
00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.780
traditional Christian teachings that you've seen throughout 2000 years of

82
00:05:19.781 --> 00:05:22.540
Christianity,
that Christianity is superior to Judaism.

83
00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:27.070
When you see that kind of super session is kind of language in the New
Testament,

84
00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:31.300
it's not impulsive much.
It is here in Hebrews because that's the way it works.

85
00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.650
But what's interesting from our point of view is that he actually uses Jewish

86
00:05:35.651 --> 00:05:40.651
scripture to teach this now in order to use Jewish scripture to teach the super

87
00:05:41.051 --> 00:05:44.830
session of Judaism by Christianity,
you know,

88
00:05:44.831 --> 00:05:46.390
that he's going to have to interpret it.

89
00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.030
And what we would consider very creative ways.

90
00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:54.070
And that's what that we can use that to contrast the way I've been teaching you

91
00:05:54.071 --> 00:05:56.140
to interpret these texts in this course,

92
00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:00.530
which is through historical critical Exige Jesus from the way that Christians

93
00:06:00.531 --> 00:06:05.210
have interpreted this text for all the way through,
uh,
history.

94
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:06.920
And this is not just Christians,

95
00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:11.930
Jewish interpretation of scripture is just as creative as Christian

96
00:06:11.931 --> 00:06:14.030
interpretation of scripture before the modern period.

97
00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.460
So what,
what then is historical criticism,

98
00:06:19.461 --> 00:06:21.620
and I'm going to review some things that you've been learning all the way

99
00:06:21.621 --> 00:06:22.454
through the semester,

100
00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.280
but I'm going to line up some things so that get them really clear in your mind.

101
00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.700
What is it you've been learning in this class,
the method you've been learning.

102
00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:32.330
And then we're gonna go back to the pre modern stuff today and look at the

103
00:06:32.331 --> 00:06:36.440
examples that you read about in the reading from the pedagogy of the Bible book.

104
00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:42.670
The meaning of a text according to historical criticism is what the ancient

105
00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:47.150
human author intended it to mean.
So for example,

106
00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.720
in Jeremiah three six it says,

107
00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:55.130
the Lord said to me in the days of King Josiah.

108
00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:59.990
Now,
if I wanted to be creative in my interpretation,

109
00:06:59.991 --> 00:07:02.300
I might say that the Lord said to me,

110
00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:05.300
they all Basil Martin in the days of King Josiah.

111
00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:08.960
But that would of course not be a historical critical interpretation.

112
00:07:08.961 --> 00:07:12.860
It has to be me,
meaning Jeremiah.
So the Lord says to Jeremiah,

113
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:15.740
that's who the author clearly must be referring to.

114
00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:20.810
And we have to take the King Josiah to be the king who actually sat on the

115
00:07:20.811 --> 00:07:25.730
throne of David in Jerusalem,
the ancient king,
Josiah Nott,
Josiah Bumbershoot,

116
00:07:25.731 --> 00:07:27.980
who happens to own a liquor store down the street from me.

117
00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:30.800
The text is not referring to that Josiah.

118
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:34.520
He's referring to the ancient Josiah basis of historical criticism.

119
00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.680
The expansion of this,

120
00:07:36.681 --> 00:07:39.940
that it's the author's intention comes to be in a lot of studies,
even in the Ma,

121
00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:41.450
even within historical criticism,

122
00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:44.900
that another way to think about the meaning of the text is that the meaning of

123
00:07:44.901 --> 00:07:48.560
the text is what the original readers probably would have thought it meant.

124
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:52.390
Because of course even we can't get to the intensity of the author that's lost.

125
00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:53.233
So it's completely,

126
00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:57.110
we have no idea what's going on inside the mind of these ancient authors.

127
00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:59.570
But by practicing historic graphical research,

128
00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:03.650
we can guess at what probably an ancient writer would have taken the text to

129
00:08:03.651 --> 00:08:04.130
mean.

130
00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:08.390
And so that's been added on as another meaning that that historical criticism

131
00:08:08.391 --> 00:08:09.224
looks for.

132
00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:14.140
The third point about historical consciousness I want to make here is that about

133
00:08:14.141 --> 00:08:18.140
his historical criticism is that it assumes a sort of modern historical

134
00:08:18.141 --> 00:08:19.760
consciousness.
By what?

135
00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:24.290
By this we mean modern people just have the notion that really premodern people

136
00:08:24.291 --> 00:08:27.590
didn't so much that the world was radically different in the ancient world.

137
00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:29.420
The ancient world is just not like our world.

138
00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:32.510
They thought about the world as being in levels like stories.

139
00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:36.410
While we think about the cosmos being bunch of different spheres and an infinite

140
00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:37.753
space.

141
00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:42.230
So we read ancient text and we see not only were they different kinds of people,

142
00:08:42.231 --> 00:08:44.120
they had different ethics,
but their whole cosmos,

143
00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:47.690
their whole universe that they inhabited was different for them.

144
00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:51.950
So what that means when with historical criticism in the 20th century,

145
00:08:51.951 --> 00:08:56.130
you have theological students being taught a little bit about ancient near

146
00:08:56.131 --> 00:08:58.530
eastern society and culture.
In fact,

147
00:08:58.531 --> 00:09:02.430
you have entire departments of ancient near eastern studies arise in modern

148
00:09:02.431 --> 00:09:05.640
universities and they don't arise just because people are automatically

149
00:09:05.641 --> 00:09:07.440
interested in ancient near eastern cultures.

150
00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:12.420
They arise as a support for biblical studies.
That's where they come from.

151
00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:15.270
The idea that if you want to read the Old Testament of the Hebrew Bible

152
00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:16.650
responsibly in the modern world,

153
00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:20.190
you must know something about ancient Assyria and ancient Egypt cause that's

154
00:09:20.191 --> 00:09:23.700
where it came from.
And also then you learn something about the Greek world.

155
00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:27.450
Why I gave an entire lecture at the beginning of this semester on the Greek

156
00:09:27.451 --> 00:09:31.020
world and the Roman world and Second Temple Judaism.

157
00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:35.640
We have the idea that uh,
Judaism before the rabbis,

158
00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:37.500
which is the time Judy,
you were talking about,

159
00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:42.120
was a different kind of Judaism than Rabbinic Judaism that you might see now in

160
00:09:42.121 --> 00:09:43.680
the modern world or in the Middle Ages.

161
00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:47.760
This reflects the idea that if you want to get into back into these texts in

162
00:09:47.761 --> 00:09:51.300
their ancient period,
you have to develop knowledge of that period.
Why?

163
00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:55.920
Because we've developed a historical consciousness.
We see ourselves in a place,

164
00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:59.310
in a timeline of history,
and the history is different in those different times.

165
00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:04.110
This also means that we teach people you need to read these texts if possible in

166
00:10:04.111 --> 00:10:05.220
the original languages.

167
00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:10.460
How many times in this class have I told you what the original Greek word,

168
00:10:10.741 --> 00:10:13.320
if some particular,
where are we?
The English translation was,

169
00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:16.800
this is not a Greek class.
Most of you haven't studied Greek,

170
00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:21.180
but I'll often scribble on the board some Greek term.
Why am I doing that?

171
00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:25.260
The text that Christians read all over the world today is not in Greek.

172
00:10:25.261 --> 00:10:27.750
It's an English,
so why is it important for us?

173
00:10:27.751 --> 00:10:29.370
Why do you accept that that's important?

174
00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:34.140
Why does it seem natural to you that I write the Greek text up here and explain

175
00:10:34.141 --> 00:10:36.150
what it's Greek meaning means in the ancient world?

176
00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:38.760
Because you have his historical consciousness too.

177
00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:43.830
You have the assumption that this ancient meaning of the original languages is

178
00:10:43.831 --> 00:10:48.390
important for the interpretation of this text.
Fourth,
we,

179
00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:53.130
historical criticism teaches you we don't interpret the Bible canonically

180
00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:56.040
and that means a couple of different things.

181
00:10:56.310 --> 00:11:01.020
We don't take the whole can in the Bible and interpret it all by reference to

182
00:11:01.021 --> 00:11:04.470
other parts of the Canon.
Remember,
how many times have we said,
well,

183
00:11:04.471 --> 00:11:07.350
that thing you're talking about maybe in the gospel of John,

184
00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:10.500
but it's not in the gospel of Matthew and right now we're talking about the

185
00:11:10.501 --> 00:11:11.311
gospel of Matthew.

186
00:11:11.311 --> 00:11:15.270
You can't use the gospel of John to interpret the Gospel of Matthew.
Well,

187
00:11:15.271 --> 00:11:18.090
why not?
Christians have been doing it for 2000 years.

188
00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:19.620
Historical criticism though,

189
00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:24.120
takes the canon apart and says each individual document must be studied in its

190
00:11:24.121 --> 00:11:27.690
own right and for its own content.
So this also,

191
00:11:27.691 --> 00:11:31.590
so that's one thing it means is that we don't study the whole Bible as one book.

192
00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:34.800
We studied the Bible as a series,
as a library of books,

193
00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:36.180
each one individually studied.

194
00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:40.440
The other aspect of this is that we in art in the modern period don't limit

195
00:11:40.441 --> 00:11:44.010
ourselves to the study of the Canon.
What did we talk about last week?

196
00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:47.730
The acts of Paul and Thecla that's not in the Bible.

197
00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:53.060
Why did I as a crazy mixed up professor that I am think that it was for you to

198
00:11:53.831 --> 00:11:58.831
read I non-canonical second century document in a class called introduction to

199
00:11:59.231 --> 00:12:02.650
New Testament history and literature.
I'll tell you why.

200
00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:08.130
I've been brainwashed by the modern historical critical method to believe that

201
00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:12.820
putting the pastoral epistles and those other canonical texts into a historical

202
00:12:12.821 --> 00:12:15.610
context that included non-canonical materials.

203
00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:19.690
Is that a good way to teach you how to think about this new testament thing

204
00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:23.950
that's part of the historical critical method also fifth,

205
00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:28.720
in spite of the fact that we don't study the Bible canonically in modern

206
00:12:28.721 --> 00:12:33.460
historical criticism,
we actually do look for source analysis.
So,
for example,

207
00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:37.960
we take the idea that these ancient authors actually did use sources.

208
00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:40.340
And since,
for example,
we,

209
00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:44.020
we've taught you that Matthew and Luke probably used mark as one of their

210
00:12:44.021 --> 00:12:44.854
sources.

211
00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:49.120
And so that's actually doing an intro canonical comparison.

212
00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:53.350
We compare the shape of this parable in mark to the shape of the same parable in

213
00:12:53.351 --> 00:12:57.190
Matthew and Luke.
Isn't that kind of canonic inter canonical comparison?

214
00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:58.121
Yes it is.

215
00:12:58.121 --> 00:13:01.180
But the reason we're doing is we're trying to get behind the text of the Canon

216
00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:04.270
into the prehistory of the text.
The form these,

217
00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:07.720
these texts assumed in a pre canonical shape.

218
00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:12.940
So famously historical criticism in the 19th century when it was really
invented,

219
00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:17.980
came up with the idea that the five books of Moses are not written by Moses.

220
00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:19.450
They're written by different people.

221
00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:24.130
And they were an addition of originally four separate strains of tradition in

222
00:13:24.131 --> 00:13:28.300
four separate documents.
This was called the j e p d theory.

223
00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:32.950
The J stands for Yahweh east and it's those parts of the Hebrew Bible use the

224
00:13:32.951 --> 00:13:35.800
name of God as Y'all way because this came from Germany,
right?

225
00:13:35.801 --> 00:13:40.600
So they pronounced a j like,
yeah,
so [inaudible],
uh,

226
00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:44.590
the Los [inaudible] is a strain that uses the term Elohim for God.

227
00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:47.530
So scholars said these are two originally,
two different things.

228
00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:52.390
The p stands for the priestly documents written by some kind of priestly class

229
00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:55.150
and the Deuce,
the d stands for Deuteronomy.

230
00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:57.190
So Deuteronomy and some other things now.

231
00:13:57.191 --> 00:14:01.540
And the idea was the deuteronomist was an editor who wrote some of this stuff

232
00:14:01.541 --> 00:14:03.580
and then edited the five books,
uh,

233
00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:07.150
or at least a good bit of the Pinta took so that it resembled a certain shape.

234
00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:08.950
So scholars called,

235
00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:12.520
they set up these four different traditions and if you took a course in Hebrew

236
00:14:12.521 --> 00:14:16.900
Bible and introduction to Hebrew Bible or even in a seminary introduction to Old

237
00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:17.110
Testament,

238
00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:21.040
you're going to get this theory crammed down your throat because it's one of the

239
00:14:21.041 --> 00:14:24.490
most dominant theories of modern historical criticism of the Hebrew Bible.

240
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.220
It's source analysis.
That's part of what we're doing.

241
00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:29.620
I taught also the second Peter,

242
00:14:29.621 --> 00:14:33.790
the letter of second Peter used Jude as one of his sources.
Again,

243
00:14:33.791 --> 00:14:38.470
that kind of source analysis as part of the method.
The next one.
I think I'm,

244
00:14:38.471 --> 00:14:43.270
I think I'm up to six in spite of the fact of talking about authorship of all

245
00:14:43.271 --> 00:14:46.480
these documents,
part of modern historical criticism questions,

246
00:14:46.481 --> 00:14:49.030
the authenticity of authorship all the time.

247
00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:52.360
How many times in this course of I said,
well,

248
00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:54.470
the Gospel say they're written by Matthew,
mark,
Luke,
and John,

249
00:14:54.471 --> 00:14:55.550
but weed out they were,

250
00:14:55.551 --> 00:14:59.060
they're anonymous so that I've taught you what it means to call a document

251
00:14:59.061 --> 00:15:01.070
anonymous.
We don't know who the author is.

252
00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:03.310
I've taught you what it means to call a document sue,

253
00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:05.540
to pick a pseudo [inaudible] or pseudonymous,

254
00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:09.200
which means it gives the false name.
Oh,
somebody for what it is.

255
00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:11.960
These are basic aspects of modern historical criticism.

256
00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:16.820
Now if you went to a very his,
if you went to a very conservative seminary,

257
00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:20.030
you might not get as much emphasis on this,
but even there,

258
00:15:20.031 --> 00:15:22.610
they'll probably tell you something like,
well,

259
00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:27.140
those liberals at Yale or Princeton theological seminary,

260
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:31.490
they'll tell you that Paul didn't write first and second Timothy and Titus,

261
00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:33.860
but they're wrong.
And here's why they're wrong.

262
00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:38.390
But you can tell you in the modern period because they feel the need to explain

263
00:15:38.391 --> 00:15:41.180
the theory to you anyway.
Even if they don't buy it,

264
00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:45.110
they'll teach it to you because it's part of this modern way of approaching the

265
00:15:45.111 --> 00:15:49.340
Bible.
Next,
the avoidance of anachronism.

266
00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:53.570
This is the big bad thing in modern historical criticism.

267
00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:58.880
Don't be anachronistic.
Don't think back into the ancient text,

268
00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:01.670
something that actually arose later.
So for example,

269
00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:03.650
most historical critics of the Bible would say,

270
00:16:03.651 --> 00:16:08.651
it's certainly wrong to read the doctrine of the trinity into Genesis.

271
00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:11.930
Now,
you already read in the Chapter I gave you that.

272
00:16:11.931 --> 00:16:15.140
That's exactly what Augustine does,
right?
Agustine sees,

273
00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:19.370
read the first chapter of Genesis.
And when the text says in,
um,

274
00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:23.060
in the beginning he says,
that refers to Jesus the way the sun,

275
00:16:23.061 --> 00:16:24.530
the wisdom through whom all things were made,

276
00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:28.790
the spirit that hovers over the chaos in genesis one that refers to the Holy

277
00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:31.010
Spirit.
So you got the trinity,
the God,
Father,
son,
and Holy Spirit,

278
00:16:31.011 --> 00:16:34.040
right in genesis,
modern historical criticism rejects that and says,

279
00:16:34.041 --> 00:16:35.390
that's wildly anachronistic.

280
00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:39.410
The doctrine of the trinity was only developed centuries after the writing of

281
00:16:39.411 --> 00:16:43.550
genesis.
You can't read it back in there.
It's an anachronism.
And the last big,

282
00:16:43.551 --> 00:16:48.551
big boogie man of a historical criticism is [inaudible] Jesus.

283
00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:55.370
If you go to any kind of seminary,
they'll warn you against ICIJ Jesus,

284
00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:01.030
right?
Cause this is reading into the text,

285
00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:04.750
something that's not in the text and they're playing off the word.
Of course,

286
00:17:04.751 --> 00:17:06.700
I've used this before.
Exit Jesus.

287
00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:11.460
Do you just mean simply as you've already learned in this course,

288
00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:12.780
interpreting a text?

289
00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:15.960
Some people think it only refers to historical critical interpretation,

290
00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:18.090
and that's often what it's come to mean in schools.

291
00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:20.250
But originally just means interpreting a text.

292
00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:23.040
Any kind of interpretation of a text.
[inaudible] Jesus,

293
00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:27.660
but it's come to mean historical critical interpretation of the text because

294
00:17:27.661 --> 00:17:32.070
this is what's really in the text and what is Icij?
Jesus is just some modern,

295
00:17:32.071 --> 00:17:36.030
pious person picking up the Bible and seeing it in anything they want to see in

296
00:17:36.031 --> 00:17:38.130
it.
It's reading into,
because this,

297
00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:42.480
this means out of in this Greek word means into,
so I see Jesus,

298
00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:44.970
you're taught to avoid that.
And then finally,

299
00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:48.300
one of the last major presuppositions that relates to the historical

300
00:17:48.301 --> 00:17:48.841
consciousness.

301
00:17:48.841 --> 00:17:53.841
I about the idea that there's a gap between the world of the Bible and our

302
00:17:54.481 --> 00:17:59.010
world.
If you go into most churches in the United States,

303
00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:01.770
they're very,
very few that might do this.
But if you go into most churches,

304
00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:04.590
I don't care how liberal or how conservative they are,

305
00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:07.860
I don't care if there are radical leftist are fundamentalists.

306
00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:10.320
Most of the women will not be wearing veils.

307
00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:12.193
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

308
00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:16.150
<v 0>If they're really conservative,
they might have a hat on,
but not a full veil.</v>

309
00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:20.050
And we say what you are,
you want to be true to the Bible.

310
00:18:20.051 --> 00:18:23.650
And right there in First Corinthians 11 you've read it.
You know,
it's their gut.

311
00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:26.990
Paul's telling women you have to wear veils and church when you pray and

312
00:18:26.991 --> 00:18:28.450
prophesied,
why aren't your women veiled?

313
00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:31.840
And it doesn't matter whether these Christians are liberal or Conservative,

314
00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:34.300
they'll have some way of saying something like,
well,

315
00:18:34.301 --> 00:18:37.480
that was their culture and it's not our culture.

316
00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:41.090
So it was important in the ancient world for women to wear a belt because it's

317
00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:45.110
pressed,
uh,
humility expressed control.
If they didn't wear veils,

318
00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:47.650
they might be thought of as a loose woman.
Well,

319
00:18:47.651 --> 00:18:49.690
veils don't mean that in our culture,

320
00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:53.410
so we don't have to obey that text.

321
00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:58.180
Like it's a rule they will talk about and they might not use the term gap,

322
00:18:58.390 --> 00:18:59.850
but that's what I'd call it.

323
00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:04.000
What they're doing is saying there's a gap between their culture and their world

324
00:19:04.001 --> 00:19:04.834
and ours.

325
00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:10.110
That consciousness of that gap is a major aspect of modern historical criticism.

326
00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:13.840
Now.
So those are several principles.

327
00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:18.460
You're not going to probably find those listed in a textbook introduction to the

328
00:19:18.461 --> 00:19:22.020
Bible.
Uh,
I actually do list them and my pedagogy,

329
00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:23.410
the Bible book in the first chapter.

330
00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:26.110
But those are a list of things that I just backed in and said,

331
00:19:26.111 --> 00:19:31.111
these are basic principles of historical criticism that set it apart from the

332
00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:33.700
centuries of interpretation of the Bible that have existed beforehand.

333
00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:36.040
So I'm going to stop from it and just say,
is that clear?

334
00:19:36.041 --> 00:19:37.170
Do you have any questions yet?

335
00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:39.970
This is all familiar to you because you've been practicing this now all year,

336
00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:42.820
but it should have been a little,
it's true.
Struck some of you as the east.

337
00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:46.690
A little odd in the beginning of why we were asking this text what we were
doing,

338
00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:50.140
why we were pushing you to do the,
the,
the xds of Everest in a certain way.

339
00:19:50.141 --> 00:19:50.800
We're doing,

340
00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:54.160
why is it wrong to read these texts and just write a sermon on them and turn it

341
00:19:54.161 --> 00:19:57.490
in as an ex Jesus paper?
No,
a sermon is different from an exit Jesus paper.

342
00:19:57.670 --> 00:20:01.120
We were teaching you this method with all these principles and presuppositions

343
00:20:01.210 --> 00:20:03.910
all semester long.
So is there any question about that?

344
00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:09.453
Okay,
good.

345
00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:11.400
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

346
00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:15.240
<v 0>but this historical criticism visit didn't just spring out of the Bible itself.</v>

347
00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:19.140
So where did it come from?
Why do we have it and where did it come from?
Well,

348
00:20:19.141 --> 00:20:21.600
as you know,
before the reformation,

349
00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:26.010
basically the Bible scripture was supposed to mean what the Catholic Church
said.

350
00:20:26.011 --> 00:20:28.470
It meant what the pope said it.
Wait,
what the what the bishop sediment.

351
00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:32.730
So the authority structure of the church was taken to be the way that you

352
00:20:32.731 --> 00:20:34.620
controlled wild interpretations.

353
00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:37.710
And people in the ancient world knew you can interpret a text anyway you want
to.

354
00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:42.950
So what keeps Harrison heretics from interpreting this text and false ways,

355
00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:47.290
the institution of the church.
So we'll see later,
um,

356
00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:49.930
Ignatius when read his letters,
he says,

357
00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:52.110
you can't just interpret scripture any way you want to.

358
00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:53.920
You must be in agreement with your bishop.

359
00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:58.450
So that the rule of the bishop and the role of the church was the way to keep

360
00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:01.990
control over the interpretation of the text.
And of course,

361
00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:03.730
in the pre reformation time,

362
00:21:03.731 --> 00:21:06.190
you did have the rise of humanism and the renaissance,

363
00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:08.680
which started questioning that a bit.
And they started,

364
00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:12.190
they started going back and looking at their original Hebrew,
the original Greek,

365
00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:15.100
insisting that you should read these texts in their original languages and not

366
00:21:15.101 --> 00:21:17.920
just in Latin.
So that was before the reformation.

367
00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:21.940
You already had this move toward history and reading the texts and historical

368
00:21:21.941 --> 00:21:26.920
context and the humanist movement and the renaissance with the reformation

369
00:21:26.921 --> 00:21:30.760
though,
of course,
you really get it in the 16th century with Martin Luther,

370
00:21:30.761 --> 00:21:35.080
John Calvin,
Melanchthon,
different,
uh,
writers saying,
well,

371
00:21:35.081 --> 00:21:38.470
we're going to throw out this Catholic authority on the text.

372
00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:40.300
We're going to get back to the text itself.

373
00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:45.760
So the only authority for the radical reformers,

374
00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:50.470
what scripture,
and so you know this as Sola Scriptura,

375
00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:59.390
scripture only scripture only will be the guide for authority for Protestants.

376
00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:04.710
But of course then they start realizing that different people can interpret

377
00:22:04.711 --> 00:22:05.700
scripture differently.

378
00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:09.180
They're very familiar with medieval Christian ways of interpreting scripture to

379
00:22:09.181 --> 00:22:13.290
have several different meanings and layers of meanings.
And so they say,
well,

380
00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:16.650
the predominant guide of scripture isn't going to be just scripture.

381
00:22:16.651 --> 00:22:19.170
It's going to be how one particular meaning of scripture,

382
00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:21.120
and that's census litter Alice.

383
00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:26.543
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

384
00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:31.270
<v 0>The literal sense of scripture is what will be now the guide for the rep</v>

385
00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:34.300
reformation,
not the pope,
not the bishops.

386
00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:38.830
Even the bishop must submit to the literal sense of scripture.

387
00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:42.550
Now it's rather debatable what they meant by the literal sense,

388
00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:47.140
because some of these reformers said that the literal sense of scripture could

389
00:22:47.141 --> 00:22:48.730
even be a prophetic sense.

390
00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:52.380
So they was still said that the literal sense of scripture could be in a psalm.

391
00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:57.100
The Psalm says,
the Lord said to my Lord,
sit at my right hand.
Well,

392
00:22:57.101 --> 00:23:00.860
they knew that the profit,
you know the,

393
00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:03.550
the text if you're going to sit in an ancient text would be referring to the

394
00:23:03.551 --> 00:23:04.301
diabetic king.

395
00:23:04.301 --> 00:23:09.301
But they also said that som also could refer to Jesus even in its literal sense.

396
00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:13.810
So the literal sense that they were talking about in the reformation was not

397
00:23:13.811 --> 00:23:16.900
necessarily what we would call the historical critical sense.

398
00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:20.950
It was what they took it to be the most fundamental plain sense meaning of the

399
00:23:20.951 --> 00:23:24.070
text.
So that was the literal sense.
But then again,

400
00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:25.660
they realize the more they did this,

401
00:23:25.661 --> 00:23:28.360
that Protestant churches started splitting all over the place.

402
00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:32.020
Presbyterians and Calvinist split off from the,
the little,
the Lutherans,

403
00:23:32.170 --> 00:23:35.050
the Anabaptist put off from the reformation.
You have,

404
00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:37.540
then you have a rise of so many Protestant movements.

405
00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:42.160
The idea that scripture alone could settle debates and give you a foundation

406
00:23:42.250 --> 00:23:45.930
started becoming questionable.
And in the 19th beginning,

407
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:47.270
somewhat in the 18th century,

408
00:23:47.271 --> 00:23:50.870
but mainly in the 19th century and mainly in Germany or German speaking lands,

409
00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:55.580
scholars started pushing the historical reading of the text.
They said,
okay,

410
00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:57.380
we've got to get down to what the author meant.

411
00:23:57.530 --> 00:24:01.460
What did the historical Paul mean?
And we had to,
we discover that.

412
00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:04.910
And so that's when you have the rise in the 19th century of the dominance of the

413
00:24:04.911 --> 00:24:08.030
historical critical method with all these presuppositions,

414
00:24:08.270 --> 00:24:11.510
it was elaborated and invented in the 19th century.

415
00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:15.410
And in some places it was precisely invented in order to try to make some the

416
00:24:15.411 --> 00:24:19.940
text of the New Testament and the Bible Affirm Foundation for doctrine and

417
00:24:19.941 --> 00:24:23.990
ethics and within Protestantism and within the wide varieties of different kinds

418
00:24:23.991 --> 00:24:27.170
of Protestantism.
And then the last thing that,
the last part of this,

419
00:24:27.171 --> 00:24:29.640
this is a big sweep of history I'm giving you,
you know,

420
00:24:29.641 --> 00:24:34.280
in five seconds what happens in the lab last part of the 20th century,

421
00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:36.350
just in the last say 30 years,

422
00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:41.300
is that people like me come along and say,
you know,

423
00:24:41.330 --> 00:24:42.170
it hasn't worked.

424
00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:47.540
This attempt to use historical criticism to settle disputes about the meaning of

425
00:24:47.541 --> 00:24:51.680
the text doesn't work because even the historical critical method can render

426
00:24:51.681 --> 00:24:54.500
wildly varying interpretations of these texts.

427
00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:58.790
So you got some people reading Romans one as a condemnation of modern

428
00:24:58.791 --> 00:25:03.260
homosexuality and thinking they're doing a good historical reading of this text.

429
00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:07.880
You got other people who read the same text using the same methods of historical

430
00:25:07.881 --> 00:25:11.540
criticism and say,
are you crazy?
It's not talking about homosexuality.

431
00:25:11.541 --> 00:25:13.220
There's not,
it's not.
It's not as concerned.

432
00:25:13.221 --> 00:25:15.020
It's talking about idolatry or something else.

433
00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:19.040
So even scholars using the same method of historical criticism,

434
00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:22.970
trained in the same schools,
getting degrees from the same places,

435
00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:26.390
come up with different interpretations of these texts,

436
00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:28.190
even using historical critical method.

437
00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:33.370
And that's why you have right now a lot of questioning of this method as not

438
00:25:34.761 --> 00:25:39.761
supplying the from foundations that Protestants originally thought it might.

439
00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:44.510
So you have new methods now being brought back into seminary education like

440
00:25:44.511 --> 00:25:47.090
feminist analysis are literary criticism.

441
00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:50.140
Our Liberation Theology or African American,
uh,

442
00:25:50.170 --> 00:25:54.380
approaches are Latino approaches.
You have all kinds or queer readings,

443
00:25:54.410 --> 00:25:55.910
gay lesbian readings and queer readings.

444
00:25:56.090 --> 00:25:59.000
You have all of these different kinds of ways of approaching the text being

445
00:25:59.001 --> 00:26:02.480
brought back as ways to,
if not displaced,

446
00:26:02.481 --> 00:26:06.590
then at least to supplement historical criticism that was dominant for the 20th

447
00:26:06.591 --> 00:26:11.330
century.
Now the question is why?
Why do all this weight and stuff anyway,

448
00:26:11.331 --> 00:26:15.080
why have I first been teaching you the historical critical method?
Well,

449
00:26:15.081 --> 00:26:19.400
I can answer that is because that's the dominant way that the Bible is taught in

450
00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:21.020
modern American universities.

451
00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:24.860
It's sort of like how do you learn Shakespeare?

452
00:26:24.861 --> 00:26:26.870
How do you learn these kinds of things?
There are methods,

453
00:26:26.930 --> 00:26:29.870
and it's not necessarily the historical method and English departments anymore,

454
00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:35.110
but there are different dominant methods that academics use to construct their

455
00:26:35.931 --> 00:26:36.764
disciplines.

456
00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:41.360
And the main way still that biblical studies as constructed as an academic

457
00:26:41.361 --> 00:26:45.890
discipline as opposed to a discipline of faith in a church is through the,

458
00:26:45.891 --> 00:26:50.850
at least learning about the historical critical method.
So I make that the basic,

459
00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:53.970
basic part of this when I'm introducing you to this discipline,

460
00:26:53.971 --> 00:26:55.830
because I'm not just introducing to the text,

461
00:26:56.250 --> 00:27:00.510
I'm introducing you to a modern scholarly discipline practices,

462
00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:01.673
assumptions.

463
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.620
But I also believe that we should study other ways of studying the Bible also at

464
00:27:07.621 --> 00:27:11.490
least to be introduced to them.
That's why for the later this week,

465
00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:15.220
you're supposed to go to the art museum.
None of us who are struggled,

466
00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:17.760
critics who are working in this class.
I'm not a,
I'm not,
I mean not.

467
00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:20.220
None of us are art critics.
None of us are historians of art.

468
00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:22.170
I know nothing about art history.

469
00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:25.410
The teaching fellows know very little about art history.

470
00:27:25.411 --> 00:27:30.411
Also some of you in this class we'll note be much better at going through the

471
00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:34.650
Yale Art Gallery and analyzing the artwork there because you will have taken art

472
00:27:34.651 --> 00:27:39.640
history classes like I never did.
The purpose of this visit is not to do it.

473
00:27:39.641 --> 00:27:44.580
A typical art historical kind of move it so that you can contrast the stuff

474
00:27:44.581 --> 00:27:49.581
you've been learning in this course with especially early Christian and medieval

475
00:27:50.701 --> 00:27:55.530
representations of the Bible.
Why did they portray in painting and an artwork?

476
00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:57.480
These stories,
the way they portray it,

477
00:27:57.630 --> 00:27:59.580
what does it tell us about their mentality?

478
00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:03.810
What does it tell us about their world and and to get you to see this is what

479
00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:09.320
interpretations of the Bible look like without historical criticism before the

480
00:28:09.421 --> 00:28:10.710
dominance of historical criticism.

481
00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:15.240
So it's to show you there are other quite legitimate ways to interpret this
text.

482
00:28:16.290 --> 00:28:19.440
We could have done this sort of literary interpretation where we take these

483
00:28:19.441 --> 00:28:23.700
texts and we'd talk about things like character developmental plot.

484
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.230
We could read the gospel of mark.

485
00:28:25.231 --> 00:28:28.530
A lot of people read the gospel of mark as almost like a modern short story.

486
00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:33.210
It has its full of puzzles.
It has its full of ways that it leads the reader.
Oh,

487
00:28:33.211 --> 00:28:35.400
stray.
Remember how the gospel of Mark Ends?

488
00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:37.380
You don't even see the resurrected Jesus.

489
00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:39.240
The women are told to go announce these,

490
00:28:39.241 --> 00:28:41.460
raised to the disciples and they don't even do it.

491
00:28:41.490 --> 00:28:43.050
They run off and that's the end.

492
00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:46.810
That doesn't end like a normal ancient text would end it.

493
00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:50.100
But it does end like kind of modernist sort of literature,

494
00:28:50.101 --> 00:28:54.360
which poses is up mini questions to the reader often as it does give answers.

495
00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:56.580
So we could have read the gospel of Mark,

496
00:28:56.970 --> 00:28:59.970
like we would read a modern short story by Flannery O'connor.

497
00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:04.940
You can do that and there's nothing wrong with that.
And I,
and I,

498
00:29:05.010 --> 00:29:06.150
why is all that important?

499
00:29:06.210 --> 00:29:10.710
I think is important to realize that because the vast majority of Christians

500
00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:15.420
throughout human history have not read the Bible the way you're learning to read

501
00:29:15.421 --> 00:29:19.770
it in this class,
and the vast majority of Christians,

502
00:29:19.890 --> 00:29:21.630
even now throughout the world,

503
00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:25.200
don't read the Bible as you're learning to read it in this class.

504
00:29:25.770 --> 00:29:28.230
And in spite of the fact that I'm teaching you this method,

505
00:29:28.290 --> 00:29:30.870
I still want to drum it into your heads at least this week,

506
00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:33.030
that this is just one way of doing it.

507
00:29:33.031 --> 00:29:35.940
And you need to be aware of the other ways of doing it because in some ways they

508
00:29:35.941 --> 00:29:40.941
are culturally more important as far as the impact of the Bible on Western

509
00:29:42.671 --> 00:29:43.504
civilization.

510
00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:45.000
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

511
00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.440
<v 0>So what I'm saying is that historical criticism is important to learn because</v>

512
00:29:49.441 --> 00:29:50.970
it's part of our environment too.

513
00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:56.340
But I would say it is even as an important way to approach the Bible,

514
00:29:56.430 --> 00:29:59.160
it's not a sufficient way to approach the Bible.

515
00:29:59.670 --> 00:30:03.310
It's certainly not sufficient when it comes to the importance of scripture in

516
00:30:03.311 --> 00:30:05.430
the Bible for Western civilization and culture.

517
00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:11.240
It'd be much better to keep in mind how Milton read the Bible for Paradise lost,

518
00:30:11.701 --> 00:30:15.000
how,
how,
how,
uh,
Dante read the Bible,

519
00:30:16.050 --> 00:30:20.220
how Flannery O'connor uses the Bible in our literature and how artists use the

520
00:30:20.221 --> 00:30:22.110
Bible.
That's also very important.

521
00:30:23.010 --> 00:30:26.100
And it certainly historical who doesn't is not sufficient for the Christian

522
00:30:26.101 --> 00:30:29.970
theological reading of the Bible because the historical meaning of the text I

523
00:30:29.971 --> 00:30:33.480
think is people are beginning to realize in churches cannot provide you with

524
00:30:33.481 --> 00:30:38.481
enough to use this text theologically and ethically.

525
00:30:39.090 --> 00:30:43.320
You've got to do something else with the text besides just history,

526
00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:45.390
if you still want to use it as scripture.

527
00:30:47.790 --> 00:30:51.690
So that's why I'm today I'm mixing these things up and trying to get you to see

528
00:30:51.691 --> 00:30:55.980
things differently.
So now let's look at what you were reading for today,

529
00:30:56.490 --> 00:31:00.000
the different medieval interpretations at Ancient Christian and medieval

530
00:31:00.001 --> 00:31:02.370
interpretations of text.
First,

531
00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:05.610
you should know that before the modern period,

532
00:31:05.970 --> 00:31:09.960
there were these different readings of the meanings of the text and in fact they

533
00:31:09.961 --> 00:31:11.550
would even talk about it as different levels.

534
00:31:11.910 --> 00:31:15.630
The two most important were the ones that I've already talked about basically as

535
00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:20.280
the literal sense.
And then the other one is the allegorical sense.

536
00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:23.870
And you've seen this sort of thing.
So these

537
00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:30.500
eventually textbooks would be written that say medieval interpretation of the

538
00:31:30.841 --> 00:31:33.270
Bible have four different levels of meaning.

539
00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:38.700
But the most important throughout history has been basically the a two part

540
00:31:38.701 --> 00:31:42.630
division,
this literal sense,
which sometimes can be called the body sense,

541
00:31:42.631 --> 00:31:45.390
the bodily sense or the physical sense.

542
00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:50.940
And then the spiritual sense or the allegorical sense or the higher meaning are

543
00:31:50.941 --> 00:31:53.370
the elevated meaning.
So over and over again,

544
00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:58.410
those two levels of interpretation will be stressed and pre modern

545
00:31:58.440 --> 00:31:59.730
interpretation of the Bible.

546
00:32:00.390 --> 00:32:04.500
And then you will often see other names and other terms attached to other
things.

547
00:32:04.501 --> 00:32:05.220
For example,

548
00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:09.250
sometimes you'll come across the term and a goggle sense of the text and

549
00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:11.820
anagogical is not exactly the literal,

550
00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:15.870
but it's also not exactly the allegorical because the ANA gods anagogical means

551
00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:17.310
leading up in Greek.

552
00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:20.670
So the idea was that this is a reading the text that will help you be a better

553
00:32:20.671 --> 00:32:23.340
Christian.
It'll help you be a more ethical person.

554
00:32:23.670 --> 00:32:27.270
So on anagogical reading would lead you to something else.

555
00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:29.850
And the variety of the different ways of reading the texts.

556
00:32:29.970 --> 00:32:32.790
So medieval theologians,
we'll talk about this,
don't use the term literal.

557
00:32:32.910 --> 00:32:34.380
They'll use the term allegorical.

558
00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:36.990
They're used the term anagogical and they'll mean by that.

559
00:32:36.991 --> 00:32:40.850
Three different meanings and notice they don't necessarily just mean these are

560
00:32:40.851 --> 00:32:43.160
three different ways to interpret the text.
I'll that.

561
00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:45.920
That's the way I've been talking about them cause that's the way I hear that.

562
00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:49.760
They actually believe that these are three different meanings that are in the

563
00:32:49.761 --> 00:32:53.780
text itself.
The anagogical meaning the allegorical,

564
00:32:53.781 --> 00:32:56.660
meaning the literal meaning and then sometimes you'll hear them talking about

565
00:32:56.661 --> 00:32:59.690
maybe the ethical meaning which is sometimes it looks a lot like the anagogical

566
00:32:59.691 --> 00:33:02.870
meaning and then sometimes you'll even hear them talk about the historical

567
00:33:02.871 --> 00:33:03.704
meaning.

568
00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:07.370
But what's funny here is that when they use that word Historia for the meaning

569
00:33:07.371 --> 00:33:08.540
of a text and they sometimes us bring,

570
00:33:08.541 --> 00:33:12.680
it's a Greek word originally they'll bring it into Latin also that don't get

571
00:33:12.681 --> 00:33:14.450
confused and you see that especially if you're,

572
00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:17.450
if you're reading something on medieval interpretation of the Bible cause it

573
00:33:17.451 --> 00:33:20.900
doesn't mean what I've been telling you means is our sense of the term

574
00:33:20.901 --> 00:33:23.360
historical meaning of the text by Historia.

575
00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:26.900
In this sense they usually mean the narrative reading.

576
00:33:27.290 --> 00:33:29.570
Like if you were read this text as a story,

577
00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:31.520
regardless of whether it ever happened.

578
00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:34.460
So they don't mean historical in the sense of this is what really happened.

579
00:33:34.790 --> 00:33:39.790
They mean the word Historia and this is a narrative sort of shape as it's

580
00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:41.990
reading the text as if it's telling a story.

581
00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:46.670
And so sometimes they'll call that the historical meaning of the text and add

582
00:33:46.671 --> 00:33:47.900
that onto some of these other ones.

583
00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:53.920
So the Minnieville notion that there are four senses of the text literally is

584
00:33:54.861 --> 00:33:55.460
always one.

585
00:33:55.460 --> 00:33:58.520
Allegorical is always one and what counts as the other two varies among

586
00:33:58.521 --> 00:33:59.354
different authors,

587
00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:03.410
but that that is definitely there in medieval theorizing about scriptural

588
00:34:03.411 --> 00:34:04.244
interpretation.

589
00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:08.420
But it shouldn't be exaggerated because you don't see it quite that rigidly as

590
00:34:08.421 --> 00:34:10.970
always for and the same four levels of meaning.

591
00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.810
But you will come across that if you do any literary study of the Bible in

592
00:34:14.811 --> 00:34:18.650
English literature and a European context in that sort of thing.

593
00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:22.880
So the people I gave you to read illustrate these things.

594
00:34:23.090 --> 00:34:25.370
The first part about origin,
if you brought your readings,

595
00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:27.170
turn to the part about origin,

596
00:34:27.171 --> 00:34:32.171
like around page 56 what origin is doing is he's giving an example of what he

597
00:34:32.961 --> 00:34:35.960
takes to be the literal meaning of this text.

598
00:34:36.590 --> 00:34:41.000
The story is from first Samuel 28 and in case you don't remember the story,

599
00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:42.471
Saul,

600
00:34:42.471 --> 00:34:47.180
who's the king is fighting a battle and he wants to know whether he's going to

601
00:34:47.181 --> 00:34:50.810
win the battle the next day,
whether he and Jonathan,
his son are gonna win.
Oh,

602
00:34:50.811 --> 00:34:51.644
they'll lose.

603
00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:56.900
So he goes and he finds a witch and of course he's already outlawed all the

604
00:34:56.901 --> 00:35:00.110
witches in in the country.
So he's not supposed to find one at all.

605
00:35:00.530 --> 00:35:03.620
So it goes and find this woman.
She's actually called a belly myther,

606
00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:07.670
a person who speaks fabulous stories from the belly cause I guess they would

607
00:35:07.671 --> 00:35:11.360
kind of do like this [inaudible] and all sounded like it was coming out of their

608
00:35:11.361 --> 00:35:14.750
gut so that they were sort of sound like you've been toilets gross or something

609
00:35:14.751 --> 00:35:17.600
and they're speaking hidden messages.
So he goes and finds this woman.

610
00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:20.120
It's translated off in an English,
the which of indoor,

611
00:35:20.450 --> 00:35:23.090
that's the popular name for the story.
And he says,

612
00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:27.890
call up the spirit of Samuel the dead profit.
And he's going to ask the spirit,

613
00:35:27.891 --> 00:35:30.320
of course in,
you know,
in these kinds of cultures,

614
00:35:30.350 --> 00:35:33.920
the idea is that dead people can see the future because they're dead.

615
00:35:33.921 --> 00:35:37.920
They live in the realm that they're not limited by,
uh,
our kinds of site.

616
00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:41.160
So the idea is that the woman's supposed to call up the dead Samuel,

617
00:35:41.161 --> 00:35:42.030
the spirit of Samuel.

618
00:35:42.090 --> 00:35:45.240
So he comes out of the ground like all the debt are under the ground in this

619
00:35:45.241 --> 00:35:49.320
kind of cosmology.
And he's asked,
well,
are we going to win the battle?

620
00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:53.850
And Samuel is all angry being called up and he curses Saul and all this kind of

621
00:35:53.851 --> 00:35:56.490
stuff.
So the story doesn't end too well for Saul.
And sure enough,

622
00:35:56.491 --> 00:35:59.070
the next day Saul and Jonathan Die,
they lose the battle.

623
00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:04.530
So origin has a problem because Christians all know that it's wrong to use

624
00:36:04.531 --> 00:36:08.610
witches.
And here's the king saw using a witch.
And they also know.

625
00:36:08.730 --> 00:36:10.590
But wait a minute,
Samuel obeyed the woman,

626
00:36:10.591 --> 00:36:12.120
she calls him to come out of the ground and he'll Beta,

627
00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:16.140
why would a great Prophet,
Oh Bay,
a witch.

628
00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:19.560
So early Christians reading this text had a lot of problems.

629
00:36:19.770 --> 00:36:21.690
And so sometimes they would allegorize it and they say,

630
00:36:21.691 --> 00:36:23.730
well it doesn't mean that it means this.

631
00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:26.720
And it doesn't say the woman actually saw Samuel,
she saw,

632
00:36:26.850 --> 00:36:29.730
she thought she saw Samuel and then other people would say,

633
00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.720
but a good of good profit like Samuel couldn't have been in hell.

634
00:36:34.410 --> 00:36:38.190
How could he have been in hell?
Great profits can't be in hell.
So they say,
oh,

635
00:36:38.191 --> 00:36:38.940
it's just,

636
00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:42.250
it's an allegory and said say it doesn't mean really mean he was in hell and man

637
00:36:42.251 --> 00:36:45.840
he was in something else.
And origin comes along and says,

638
00:36:45.841 --> 00:36:50.010
no you can't allegorize this text.
It means exactly what it says.

639
00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:53.990
So he says,
you have to read it literally.
And so he,
August we're at,

640
00:36:53.991 --> 00:36:57.780
and this is very funny because origin is famous throughout history for being a

641
00:36:57.781 --> 00:37:00.240
great allegorizing reader of scripture.
In fact,

642
00:37:00.241 --> 00:37:03.580
a lot of historians don't like him cause he reader tends to read scripture out

643
00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:06.840
allegorically in different places.
But in this case,
origin,

644
00:37:06.841 --> 00:37:09.540
this great allegorize sir is insisting on the literal reading.

645
00:37:09.810 --> 00:37:12.180
But now notice what he means by literal.
First he says,

646
00:37:12.330 --> 00:37:15.540
the woman really did see Samuel.
Samuel really was in hell,

647
00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:18.900
and if you can't accept that,
it's your problem.
So then he explains it.

648
00:37:18.901 --> 00:37:19.890
He gives some answers for it,

649
00:37:20.490 --> 00:37:23.580
but then he says the literal meaning of the text is not just a story,

650
00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:25.380
but this is what he says to the literal sense.

651
00:37:25.381 --> 00:37:27.330
It's on page 56 and the Chapter I gave you,

652
00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:33.030
even the literal sense of the story is to teach that Christians will enjoy an

653
00:37:33.031 --> 00:37:35.310
afterlife existence.
Now I ask you,

654
00:37:35.370 --> 00:37:38.340
is there anything about Christians in this story?
No.

655
00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:42.750
We would not call that the literal historical sense of this story.

656
00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:46.320
So it shows that origin,
when he uses this term literal meaning of the story,

657
00:37:46.350 --> 00:37:49.260
he's not still referring to what we call the historical critical meaning.

658
00:37:49.530 --> 00:37:50.363
But for him,

659
00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:53.070
the literal meaning of the story is to teach Christians about their own

660
00:37:53.071 --> 00:37:54.150
afterlife existence.

661
00:37:54.330 --> 00:37:59.330
And then he has an elevated our higher sense of the story which he takes to be

662
00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:02.190
that righteous Christians,

663
00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:07.050
unlike even righteous prophets before the coming of Jesus won't have to spend

664
00:38:07.110 --> 00:38:11.820
any time in hades or hell or purgatory.

665
00:38:12.210 --> 00:38:14.940
If you're a good Christian,
when you die,
you'll go straight to heaven.

666
00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:18.570
And that's something that even the Old Testament prophets didn't do because they

667
00:38:18.571 --> 00:38:22.200
had to go to hell first according to origin,
to wait until Christ came.

668
00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:25.530
So Christ could open up paradise in heaven for everybody.

669
00:38:26.190 --> 00:38:29.460
So origin has an elevated spiritual meaning of this text,

670
00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:31.860
but it's not a particularly allegorical,

671
00:38:31.861 --> 00:38:34.050
meaning it's just that if you're a righteous Christian,

672
00:38:34.051 --> 00:38:38.200
the story teaches that you will get to go straight to heaven without passing

673
00:38:38.201 --> 00:38:40.330
through hell when you die.

674
00:38:40.810 --> 00:38:43.960
So notice how origin is still playing with these notions of a literal reading

675
00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:46.240
and a higher elevated spiritual reading.

676
00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:50.740
But the literal reading doesn't particularly look like what we would call the

677
00:38:50.741 --> 00:38:55.030
literal reading of the text and the higher elevated spiritual reading doesn't

678
00:38:55.031 --> 00:38:58.240
look all that allegorical.
It looks almost like a moral lesson to us.

679
00:38:58.570 --> 00:39:03.220
So that's one example though about how origin thinks it's perfectly fine to get

680
00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:05.920
at least two readings out of this same text.

681
00:39:06.610 --> 00:39:08.350
Then you move to Augustan.

682
00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:13.120
Now Augusta is a great example because he's an example I use because of a pre

683
00:39:13.170 --> 00:39:17.290
modern practice of not just reading scripture for the answers that gives you

684
00:39:17.410 --> 00:39:18.610
about ethics or doctrine.

685
00:39:18.850 --> 00:39:22.360
Remember that section in the readings where Augustine praise with scripture,

686
00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:26.410
he's praised the psalms.
So he says things like,
then I read,

687
00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:28.390
let your anger deter me from sin,

688
00:39:28.391 --> 00:39:33.070
which is a quotation from psalm 44 and how these words mood me,
my God.

689
00:39:33.310 --> 00:39:36.400
I had already learned to feel from my past sins and anger with myself.

690
00:39:36.610 --> 00:39:38.440
That would hold me back from sending.
Again,

691
00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:43.630
this is from confessions nine 10 and it's on page 57 of my chapter.

692
00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:45.570
So notice what Augustans doing.

693
00:39:45.610 --> 00:39:50.260
He feels like it's okay for him to get into the song and put himself in this

694
00:39:50.261 --> 00:39:54.370
world of the speaker.
And so what God is saying to the Somme,
Augustan says,

695
00:39:54.371 --> 00:39:55.930
he was saying to me personally,

696
00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:59.500
Augustan and then Augustan answers back with the words of the Psalm.

697
00:39:59.830 --> 00:40:02.920
This is actually a reading of scripture that's becoming popular more in certain

698
00:40:02.921 --> 00:40:06.670
modern Christian context,
especially monastic communities and churches.

699
00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:09.670
And it's called sometimes lectio Divina.

700
00:40:14.070 --> 00:40:14.380
<v 1>Okay.</v>

701
00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:16.840
<v 0>This just means divine reading in Latin,</v>

702
00:40:17.110 --> 00:40:22.110
but it refers to a practice that some modern Christians are trying to resurrect

703
00:40:22.301 --> 00:40:26.410
from the premodern Christian practices of praying,
whisk,
letting,

704
00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:28.360
reading scripture,
memorizing scripture,

705
00:40:28.361 --> 00:40:31.840
and then using the words of scripture as your own prayer to God so that God

706
00:40:31.841 --> 00:40:32.674
talks to you and he talked about,

707
00:40:32.770 --> 00:40:35.740
so people are getting this stuff straight from pre modern practices,

708
00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:40.990
but Augustan is also a wonderful example of the multiplicity of meanings that

709
00:40:40.991 --> 00:40:45.010
are contained in the text all at the same time.
So,
for example,
on page 58,

710
00:40:45.250 --> 00:40:48.340
this is where he sees the trinity in Genesis one

711
00:40:50.650 --> 00:40:54.070
in the beginning because of John One,
three through 10,

712
00:40:54.130 --> 00:40:55.510
you've read the gospel of John.

713
00:40:55.990 --> 00:40:59.500
The first part of John One cites this in the beginning,

714
00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:04.030
but then goes on to say is that God created everything through Jesus,
the logos.

715
00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:08.050
So a gun Augustan looks at that in the beginning and says,
oh,

716
00:41:08.051 --> 00:41:10.060
that's a reference to John,
the gospel of John,

717
00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:13.330
which means that he's talking about Jesus here is also being there and in the

718
00:41:13.331 --> 00:41:15.430
spirit that moves over the waters is the Holy Spirit.

719
00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:19.540
And then one of the most fascinating things is his,
the way he uses,

720
00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:24.660
he reads the six days of creation in genesis and uh,

721
00:41:25.210 --> 00:41:29.800
allegorically,
uh,
on page 59 and around then he says,

722
00:41:29.801 --> 00:41:33.800
on the first day,
the vault,
the heavens,
God created the heavens and the earth,

723
00:41:33.801 --> 00:41:38.710
right?
The word heaven,
they're translated,
uh,
doesn't mean what we think as space.

724
00:41:38.711 --> 00:41:43.610
In this guy,
he referred to an actual,
um,
from kind of vault,

725
00:41:43.611 --> 00:41:47.540
like a dome,
a ceiling.
And that's why an older translations,

726
00:41:47.550 --> 00:41:52.220
it's called the firmament.
Because it is from,
it's not air,
it's firm.

727
00:41:52.580 --> 00:41:55.340
And so Augustine says the sky,
when you look up at the sky,

728
00:41:55.350 --> 00:41:58.070
you see that blue thing,
that big blue dome that's above you.

729
00:41:58.430 --> 00:42:01.730
We think of that as seeing space,
but ancient people didn't.

730
00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:05.750
They thought they were actually seeing like a big canvas spread over the sky.

731
00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:10.250
The reason it's blue is because water's behind it.
It's holding back the water.

732
00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:15.590
It's in the sky and the sky refers to the word heaven refers to that thing.

733
00:42:15.620 --> 00:42:19.370
And so Augustan says it's like vellum is like the skin,

734
00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:21.530
the leather that you make tech set of.

735
00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:24.140
And so he interprets it allegorically to say scripture,

736
00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:29.420
the making of the firmament.
And genesis refers to God's giving us scripture.

737
00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:32.780
And that's why angels were to angels if they live on the other side of
scripture.

738
00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:35.570
Why?
Because they don't have to see what's written because they know everything

739
00:42:35.571 --> 00:42:36.950
already.
But we humans,

740
00:42:36.951 --> 00:42:39.890
we live on this side of scripture and we look up and we read the writings of
God.

741
00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:42.350
And so we need scripture to read things.

742
00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:45.710
So he goes to this elaborate allegorical reading day.

743
00:42:45.711 --> 00:42:49.160
To the waters that lit the preside over the vault.

744
00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:53.480
They represent angelic peoples.
He says the angels on Day three,

745
00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:55.070
the gathered together.
See,

746
00:42:55.071 --> 00:42:59.510
this is when genesis says God separated the sea from the dry land.
This,
you know,

747
00:42:59.540 --> 00:43:02.800
and separate the water from the dryland that what he called see the driving

748
00:43:02.810 --> 00:43:05.150
called Earth.
And Augustan says,
okay,

749
00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:07.940
the sea represents the bitter part of humanity.

750
00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:12.560
The dry land represents those who thirst after righteousness and God.

751
00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:18.260
So God separates out on day three good humanity from bad humanity by Augustans

752
00:43:18.261 --> 00:43:19.490
allegorical interpretation.

753
00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:23.600
So all of these just are illustrations of how Augustan knew how to read this

754
00:43:23.601 --> 00:43:27.170
text literally.
But he shows you how he also reads allegorically.

755
00:43:27.260 --> 00:43:30.140
He thinks that the text is full of all these meetings and it's perfectly

756
00:43:30.141 --> 00:43:32.060
legitimate to get all of these meetings of the texts.

757
00:43:32.510 --> 00:43:35.090
And then one of the most fascinating is want to get you from Bernard of

758
00:43:35.090 --> 00:43:35.840
Clairvaux.

759
00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:40.580
And I'm going to this I think is so interesting because Bernard is preaching on

760
00:43:40.581 --> 00:43:44.780
the song of songs that you know,
erotic part of the Hebrew Bible,

761
00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:47.360
which is actually to us,
moderns just looks like a love poem,

762
00:43:48.110 --> 00:43:51.710
but it was red allegorically throughout the church and even in Rabbinic Judaism

763
00:43:51.950 --> 00:43:54.860
read the song of songs as being about God and people.
Israel,

764
00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:58.130
the bridegroom is God.
The bride is the people of Israel.

765
00:43:58.370 --> 00:44:01.310
Christian fathers read that it'd be about Jesus and the church.

766
00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:03.020
So Bernard is doing that,

767
00:44:03.170 --> 00:44:08.000
but now notice this is a sermon being delivered to monks in a monastery.

768
00:44:08.001 --> 00:44:09.590
These are men.
They're all men there.

769
00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:12.230
And if you realize that's the social setting of this text,

770
00:44:12.231 --> 00:44:14.060
it makes it read very differently.

771
00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:19.030
Like this one big paragraph I quoted quoted again,
now he,

772
00:44:19.050 --> 00:44:22.520
this is the young woman in the song of songs speaking in his sermon.

773
00:44:23.570 --> 00:44:26.540
I cannot rest until he kisses me with a kiss of his mouth.

774
00:44:26.570 --> 00:44:30.590
I thank Kim for the kiss of the feet.
I thank him too for the kiss of the hand,

775
00:44:30.770 --> 00:44:34.530
but if he has genuine regard for me,
let him kiss me with the kiss of his mouth.

776
00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:38.250
There is no question of in gratitude on my part.
It's simply that I am in love.

777
00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:40.860
It is desire that drives me on not reason.

778
00:44:41.070 --> 00:44:44.940
Please do not accuse me of presumption if I yield to this impulse of love.

779
00:44:45.090 --> 00:44:49.950
My shame indeed rebukes me,
but love is stronger than all I ask.
I crave,

780
00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:53.460
I implore,
let him kiss me with the kiss of his mouth.

781
00:44:53.490 --> 00:44:56.700
Don't you see that by his grace.
I have been for many years now.

782
00:44:56.701 --> 00:45:01.170
Careful to lead a chaste and sober life.
I concentrate on spiritual studies.

783
00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:04.620
Resist vices.
Pray often,
Huh?

784
00:45:05.730 --> 00:45:07.590
I am watchful against temptations.

785
00:45:07.740 --> 00:45:11.670
I recount all my years in the bitterness of my soul as far as I can judge.

786
00:45:11.671 --> 00:45:15.570
I have lived among the brethren without coral lived among the brethren.

787
00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:21.490
Wait,
who are we talking about now?
Are we still talking about the young girl?

788
00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:29.230
I had been submissive to authority responding to the beckon call of my superior

789
00:45:29.500 --> 00:45:34.300
in the monastery.
Is this the girl?
I do not covet goods,

790
00:45:34.301 --> 00:45:35.101
not mind.
Rather,

791
00:45:35.101 --> 00:45:38.710
do I put myself and my goods at the service of others with sweat on my brow,

792
00:45:38.711 --> 00:45:40.780
I eat my bread.
Yet in all of these practices,

793
00:45:40.781 --> 00:45:43.570
there is evidence only of my fidelity.
Nothing of enjoyment.

794
00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:46.690
I obey the commandments to the best of my ability,
I hope,
but in doing so,

795
00:45:46.691 --> 00:45:48.880
my third,
my soul thirsts like a parched land.

796
00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:53.080
If therefore he is to find my holocaust acceptable,
let him kiss me.

797
00:45:53.081 --> 00:45:54.760
I entreat with a kiss of his mouth.

798
00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:58.090
Halfway through this remarkable quotation,

799
00:45:58.480 --> 00:46:02.380
the girl morphs into the monk,
the last part,

800
00:46:02.381 --> 00:46:07.381
it's a monk talking not a virgin girl and yet this is a male monk yearning for

801
00:46:09.251 --> 00:46:13.420
this male figure and he's doing this in a monastery.

802
00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:16.060
Isn't this kind of odd?

803
00:46:17.110 --> 00:46:22.110
He uses the eroticism of the song of songs not to get rid of eroticism?

804
00:46:22.781 --> 00:46:23.740
I don't.
He's not.

805
00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:26.770
I don't think he's telling the monk you're going to have sex with Jesus,

806
00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:30.280
but he certainly doesn't get rid of the erotic at all.

807
00:46:30.281 --> 00:46:33.820
He doesn't explain it away or try to get rid of it like origin would have done

808
00:46:33.821 --> 00:46:37.300
previously or some of the,
you know,
the early Christian writers.
In fact,

809
00:46:37.301 --> 00:46:41.410
he capitalizes on the erotic and even turns it into the home or erotic because

810
00:46:41.411 --> 00:46:46.411
he's asking the monk to identify with the body of the girl and to yearn for this

811
00:46:46.991 --> 00:46:47.980
male bridegroom.

812
00:46:48.460 --> 00:46:53.460
So Bernard reads this text not only at a gala [inaudible] way so that the girl

813
00:46:53.561 --> 00:46:56.740
represents the monk in a monastery who's trying to do the office.

814
00:46:56.741 --> 00:46:57.700
He prays every night.

815
00:46:57.701 --> 00:47:00.340
He does all the right things and he doesn't feel anything about it.

816
00:47:00.370 --> 00:47:02.110
He feels dry and barren.

817
00:47:02.111 --> 00:47:07.111
And so Bernard's using the erotic of the song of songs to enliven the daily

818
00:47:08.651 --> 00:47:12.580
office of the monastery for the monks.
And then this other quotation,

819
00:47:13.180 --> 00:47:15.010
this is where Bernard says,
oh,

820
00:47:15.011 --> 00:47:18.040
everybody who's lived in monastic life knows that there are times when you go to

821
00:47:18.041 --> 00:47:18.940
the church and you'd go to the,

822
00:47:19.090 --> 00:47:21.730
and you pray in the altar and you don't feel anything.
You just feel,

823
00:47:21.790 --> 00:47:25.030
you feel depressed,
you feel alone.
So he says,

824
00:47:25.210 --> 00:47:28.420
men with an urge to frequent prayer will have experience with what I say.

825
00:47:28.780 --> 00:47:31.390
Often enough,
when we approached the alter to pray,

826
00:47:31.450 --> 00:47:34.660
you might not enrich initially.
Feel all excited about it.

827
00:47:34.900 --> 00:47:38.710
Our hearts are dry and Luke warm,
but if we persevere,

828
00:47:38.830 --> 00:47:41.800
there comes an unexpected infusion of grace.

829
00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:46.570
Our breast expands the breasts of the monks.

830
00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:50.620
Yeah,
our breast expands as it were.

831
00:47:50.770 --> 00:47:54.640
Our interior is filled with an overflowing of love and if somebody should press

832
00:47:54.641 --> 00:47:55.090
on them,

833
00:47:55.090 --> 00:47:59.080
then this milk of sweet fecundity would gush forth in streaming richness.

834
00:47:59.560 --> 00:48:04.540
He's talking about orgasm folks,
he,
you know,
he's describing orgasm,

835
00:48:04.900 --> 00:48:09.460
the orgasm of a woman,
the breast filling up swelling,

836
00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:12.130
and then experiencing this explosion.

837
00:48:12.910 --> 00:48:17.910
Bernard is using orgasmic language taken from the song of songs to talk to a

838
00:48:20.081 --> 00:48:25.081
bunch of monks in the middle of the night to get them to continue praying and to

839
00:48:25.421 --> 00:48:29.110
get them more excited about giving themselves to Jesus the bridegroom.

840
00:48:30.100 --> 00:48:35.100
This is part of the remarkable you reading of the text of the Bible that you get

841
00:48:35.441 --> 00:48:40.441
in a premodern world where they seem to feel remarkably free to read these texts

842
00:48:40.871 --> 00:48:44.980
as containing a lot more meanings than a historian like me would see them

843
00:48:44.981 --> 00:48:48.580
containing.
Now,
I could go on and talk about the Thomas Aquinas step,

844
00:48:48.581 --> 00:48:49.810
but it's just there as examples.

845
00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:54.400
Aquinas is a wonderful example of how he quotes one interpretation of John Chris

846
00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:58.150
System and then quotes another interpretation of Augustan and he doesn't decide.

847
00:48:58.151 --> 00:49:00.010
He just says,
okay,
they're both there.
They're both valid.

848
00:49:01.210 --> 00:49:05.530
He doesn't have any desire to narrow down the meaning of the text to one
meaning.

849
00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:09.400
So I want you to,
uh,
think about this also.

850
00:49:09.401 --> 00:49:12.610
These are legitimate ways to interpret this text.

851
00:49:12.611 --> 00:49:15.130
At least they have been for much of the history of Christianity.

852
00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:17.380
The modern world tended to reject them,

853
00:49:18.100 --> 00:49:20.080
but if you look anywhere before the modern period,

854
00:49:20.170 --> 00:49:24.040
you'll find them all over the place.
So experienced some of this stuff too.

855
00:49:24.041 --> 00:49:26.950
When you go then to the Yale Art Gallery later this week.
