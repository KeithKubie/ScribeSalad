the following is an irrational number I

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:26.869
the following is an irrational number I
 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:29.330
the following is an irrational number I
didn't know numbers were irrational it's

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340
didn't know numbers were irrational it's
 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.269
didn't know numbers were irrational it's
not 4.5 102 that's look that's a number

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279
not 4.5 102 that's look that's a number
 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.639
not 4.5 102 that's look that's a number
does anyone know what a rational number

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649
does anyone know what a rational number
 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.190
does anyone know what a rational number
is I'm gonna go with B I don't even know

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200
is I'm gonna go with B I don't even know
 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.130

what to call the check mark symbol I'm

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140
what to call the check mark symbol I'm
 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.479
what to call the check mark symbol I'm
gonna say that that makes no sense to me

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489
gonna say that that makes no sense to me
 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.340
gonna say that that makes no sense to me
so I hope it's the irrational one oh boy

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350
so I hope it's the irrational one oh boy
 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.529

why are you driving 13 miles now or what

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460
why are you driving 13 miles now or what
 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.880
why are you driving 13 miles now or what
is wrong with your car Express distance

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890
is wrong with your car Express distance

as a function of time so I'm circling B

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190
as a function of time so I'm circling B
 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.770
as a function of time so I'm circling B
and I'm getting a little concerned

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780
and I'm getting a little concerned
 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.540
and I'm getting a little concerned
because I think B has been my answer for

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:34.550
because I think B has been my answer for
 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.490
because I think B has been my answer for
the last like four or five answers time

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500
the last like four or five answers time
 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.889
the last like four or five answers time
is pretty sure the answer is the speed

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:41.899
is pretty sure the answer is the speed
 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:46.950
is pretty sure the answer is the speed
of light 39 divided by 13 which is 313 x

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960
of light 39 divided by 13 which is 313 x

equals y a boat starts from a port and

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770
equals y a boat starts from a port and
 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.010
equals y a boat starts from a port and
moves 12 miles north and then moves five

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020
moves 12 miles north and then moves five
 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.380
moves 12 miles north and then moves five
miles east what is the present distance

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390
miles east what is the present distance
 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.949
miles east what is the present distance
of the boat from the port so there's a

00:01:59.949 --> 00:01:59.959
of the boat from the port so there's a
 

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:01.960
of the boat from the port so there's a
triangle involved and I call a friend

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970
triangle involved and I call a friend
 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.449
triangle involved and I call a friend
all right this is that classic a squared

00:02:04.449 --> 00:02:04.459
all right this is that classic a squared
 

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:06.069
all right this is that classic a squared
plus B squared equals C squared I have

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:06.079
plus B squared equals C squared I have
 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:07.870
plus B squared equals C squared I have
to find the hypotenuse so we're just

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880
to find the hypotenuse so we're just
 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.789
to find the hypotenuse so we're just
gonna guess on this one 12 times so

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:09.799
gonna guess on this one 12 times so
 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:13.120
gonna guess on this one 12 times so
let's take the square root of 169 I

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130
let's take the square root of 169 I
 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.979
let's take the square root of 169 I
believe that is liq to what volume of

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989
believe that is liq to what volume of
 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:21.340
believe that is liq to what volume of
ice creams contain in a 10 centimeter

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350

high ice-cream cone with a base radius

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170
high ice-cream cone with a base radius
 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.400
high ice-cream cone with a base radius
of 4 I don't remember the volume of a

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410
of 4 I don't remember the volume of a
 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:28.240
of 4 I don't remember the volume of a
cone

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250
cone
 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.869

this is asking me

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879
 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:37.220
okay so this is like V equals 1/2 of B

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230
okay so this is like V equals 1/2 of B
 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.099
okay so this is like V equals 1/2 of B
and H or something like that I think

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:40.109
and H or something like that I think
 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:42.770
and H or something like that I think
it's time for a B can you go number it

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780
it's time for a B can you go number it
 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.360
it's time for a B can you go number it
number a I felt good about it but C

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370
number a I felt good about it but C
 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.089
number a I felt good about it but C
