best not to mention in in public not to
 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.830
best not to mention in in public not to
give too much credence to but I think

give too much credence to but I think
 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.950
give too much credence to but I think
that we can give credence to that even

that we can give credence to that even
 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.020
that we can give credence to that even
if we don't want to admit it necessarily

probably would think twice about

probably would think twice about
 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.810
probably would think twice about
associating with us if they knew that we

associating with us if they knew that we
 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.420
associating with us if they knew that we
were as naive as we really are

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430
were as naive as we really are
 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.810
were as naive as we really are
but we can still for our own sake the

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820
but we can still for our own sake the
 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.759
but we can still for our own sake the
back of our mind ask those sorts of

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769
back of our mind ask those sorts of
 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.910
back of our mind ask those sorts of
questions and let them play out we can

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920
questions and let them play out we can
 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.210
questions and let them play out we can
fully develop them and even if it's only

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220
fully develop them and even if it's only
 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.710
fully develop them and even if it's only
in our own mind that we are fully

in our own mind that we are fully
 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.980
in our own mind that we are fully
developing them that process can take us

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990
developing them that process can take us
 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.760
developing them that process can take us
to something that is more concrete

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770
to something that is more concrete
 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.960
to something that is more concrete
something that is more actionable in a

something that is more actionable in a
 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.969
something that is more actionable in a
an adult responsible world that we don't

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979
an adult responsible world that we don't
 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.240
an adult responsible world that we don't
really need to say we came to it through

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250
really need to say we came to it through
 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.289
really need to say we came to it through
that naive question we only have to then

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299
that naive question we only have to then
 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.830
that naive question we only have to then
take up where it got us and make use of

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840
take up where it got us and make use of
 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.550
take up where it got us and make use of
that in terms of solving the problems

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560
that in terms of solving the problems
 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.240
that in terms of solving the problems
within our lives whether they be

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250
within our lives whether they be
 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.420
within our lives whether they be
personal or whether they be at the level

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430
personal or whether they be at the level
 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.440
personal or whether they be at the level
of making the most of the world in which

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450
of making the most of the world in which
 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.730
of making the most of the world in which
we work several years ago I got to be

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740
we work several years ago I got to be
 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.109
we work several years ago I got to be
very interested in honeybees and the

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119
very interested in honeybees and the
 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.999
very interested in honeybees and the
extraordinary talent they have for

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009
extraordinary talent they have for
 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.429
extraordinary talent they have for
dancing they're better dancers than us

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439
dancing they're better dancers than us
 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:08.960
dancing they're better dancers than us
they've been doing it a lot longer and

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970
they've been doing it a lot longer and
 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.589
they've been doing it a lot longer and
they certainly seem to have dance as

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599
they certainly seem to have dance as
 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.700
they certainly seem to have dance as
their culture

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710
their culture
 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.220
their culture
to a greater extent than probably any

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230
to a greater extent than probably any
 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.250
to a greater extent than probably any
other species so I got to thinking about

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260
other species so I got to thinking about
 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.440
other species so I got to thinking about
whether there was a way to work with

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450
whether there was a way to work with
 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.040
whether there was a way to work with
honeybees collaboratively making use of

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050
honeybees collaboratively making use of
 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.170
honeybees collaboratively making use of
their dance in a way that would

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180
their dance in a way that would
 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.860
their dance in a way that would
choreograph it as we do amongst

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870
choreograph it as we do amongst
 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.340
choreograph it as we do amongst
ourselves for human audiences the way in

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350
ourselves for human audiences the way in
 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.760
ourselves for human audiences the way in
which they dance is determined by where

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770
which they dance is determined by where
 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.310
which they dance is determined by where
flowers are to be found and that

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320
flowers are to be found and that
 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.560
flowers are to be found and that
information can be used as a way of

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570
information can be used as a way of
 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.420
information can be used as a way of
marking a dance that they might be able

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430
marking a dance that they might be able
 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.290
marking a dance that they might be able
to perform so what I did was I studied

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300
to perform so what I did was I studied
 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.130
to perform so what I did was I studied
extensively the language of bees the

extensively the language of bees the
 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.930
extensively the language of bees the
language by which they indicate to

so that others can then to go and find
those flowers and in the process of

those flowers and in the process of
 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.050

pollinating them bring back more nectar

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060

might plant flowers and then mapped out

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650
might plant flowers and then mapped out
 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.720
might plant flowers and then mapped out
specifically where the flowers should be

working with some collaborators went and

working with some collaborators went and
 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.820
working with some collaborators went and
planted the flowers and I made a map

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:16.830
planted the flowers and I made a map
