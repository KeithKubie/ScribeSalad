00:00:01.133 --> 00:00:03.302
Immigration.
It's a scary word.

00:00:03.335 --> 00:00:05.505
And scarier when I say
it like this:

00:00:05.538 --> 00:00:07.907
-(softly): Immigration.
-(laughter)

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:10.343
But libs want to take anyone in.

00:00:10.376 --> 00:00:13.413
Your tired, your poor,
your huddled masses.

00:00:13.446 --> 00:00:14.914
It's completely un-American.

00:00:14.947 --> 00:00:19.085
Luckily, General John Kelly,
Trump's chief of staff, gets it.

00:00:37.203 --> 00:00:38.771
Kind of the norm. Yeah. Yeah.

00:00:38.804 --> 00:00:40.406
Immigrants need to be educated.

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:44.010
Skilled workers who know English
and have a rockin' bod.

00:00:44.043 --> 00:00:46.412
Okay, he didn't say
the last one,

00:00:46.445 --> 00:00:48.581
but I think it was implied.

00:00:48.614 --> 00:00:50.450
But of course,
the libs were ready

00:00:50.483 --> 00:00:54.954
to jump on Kelly's
so-called "hypocrisy." Look.

00:00:54.987 --> 00:00:56.856 line:0%
General Kelly's own family,

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:58.691 line:0%
from the Brighton section
of Boston,

00:00:58.724 --> 00:01:02.061 line:0%
uh, his father was Irish,
his mother was Italian,

00:01:02.094 --> 00:01:04.630 line:0%
his great-grandfather
was a wagon driver

00:01:04.663 --> 00:01:06.899 line:0%
who was reportedly
a illiterate Italian,

00:01:06.932 --> 00:01:08.167 line:0%
didn't speak English.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.704 line:0%
His maternal, um, grandmother
had a fruit cart.

00:01:11.737 --> 00:01:14.841
See? John Kelly's ancestors
were exactly the kind

00:01:14.874 --> 00:01:18.177
of high achievers
he wants in America.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.580
In those days,
wagon driver and fruit peddler

00:01:20.613 --> 00:01:23.583
were basically CEO
and iPhone inventor.

00:01:23.616 --> 00:01:24.917
(laughter)

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.221
The point is, back then
immigrants had merit.

00:01:28.254 --> 00:01:31.757
And here to agree with me is
citizen-journalist Kobi Libii.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.094
-Now, Kobi...
-(cheering, applause)

00:01:36.795 --> 00:01:39.565
Now, Kobi, you are
an expert in history.

00:01:39.598 --> 00:01:41.734
Correct, Jordan.
I'm histrionic.

00:01:41.767 --> 00:01:44.237 line:0%
And John Kelly's right--

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.206 line:0%
America has a longstanding
immigration policy

00:01:47.239 --> 00:01:49.041 line:0%
called "no scrubs."

00:01:49.074 --> 00:01:52.011
We only let in
highly skilled people.

00:01:52.044 --> 00:01:54.780
The first Thanksgiving
was actually just the Pilgrims

00:01:54.813 --> 00:01:57.717
partying after they finished
their PhD dissertation.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.053
Wow. Those Native Americans
must have learned so much

00:02:01.086 --> 00:02:04.056
from them about farming corn
and not freezing in winter.

00:02:04.089 --> 00:02:07.293
Big-time. And the Irish who came
over during the potato famine

00:02:07.326 --> 00:02:08.928
were all doctors.

00:02:08.961 --> 00:02:12.131
In their careful study
of nutrition and the human body,

00:02:12.164 --> 00:02:15.701
they discovered that not eating
is bad for you.

00:02:15.734 --> 00:02:17.436
Wow. Incredible research.

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:19.605
Now, groups this well-educated

00:02:19.638 --> 00:02:22.642
must have been immediately
accepted into American life.

00:02:22.675 --> 00:02:25.411
Absolutely! That's why
you'll never hear a mean joke

00:02:25.444 --> 00:02:27.747
-about a Polish person.
-Never heard one.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.650
So, these immigrants
had something to offer

00:02:30.683 --> 00:02:32.585
and achieved the American dream.

00:02:32.618 --> 00:02:34.620
Without a doubt,
because the American dream

00:02:34.653 --> 00:02:36.255
is coming over
with established wealth

00:02:36.288 --> 00:02:37.557
and a marketable trade,

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.926
and then pretty much staying
exactly where you are.

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.995
Otherwise, you're a scrub.

00:02:43.028 --> 00:02:46.232
And you can't get no love
from me.

00:02:46.265 --> 00:02:49.302
You see, America is exclusive.

00:02:49.335 --> 00:02:51.337
We're like the Harvard
of countries.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.673
-There's a quota on Asians.
-Uh, well, yes,

00:02:53.706 --> 00:02:57.643
but also,
not everyone can get in.

00:02:57.676 --> 00:02:59.645
You might get waitlisted,

00:02:59.678 --> 00:03:01.781
or you might have to go
to your safety country,

00:03:01.814 --> 00:03:04.617
which, funnily enough
for asylum seekers,

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.953
is much less safe.

00:03:06.986 --> 00:03:10.022
So, if you want
to get out of a war zone

00:03:10.055 --> 00:03:11.123
and get into America,

00:03:11.156 --> 00:03:12.992
first you just need
to get a masters

00:03:13.025 --> 00:03:15.361
from your war zone university
in math or science

00:03:15.394 --> 00:03:17.730
or the politics
of surviving a genocide,

00:03:17.763 --> 00:03:20.333
and then you can immigrate
to America

00:03:20.366 --> 00:03:22.301
once you have skills,
real skills.

00:03:22.334 --> 00:03:25.438
-Valuable skills. -Not too many
skills, though, Jordan.

00:03:25.471 --> 00:03:27.673
Then they'll take our jobs.

00:03:27.706 --> 00:03:29.642
Okay. So, okay, so...

00:03:29.675 --> 00:03:31.644
(cheering and applause)

00:03:31.677 --> 00:03:33.913
Let me get this...
So, okay, yeah.

00:03:33.946 --> 00:03:36.415
So we want just the right level
of skills--

00:03:36.448 --> 00:03:39.552
-not too many, not too few.
-Like Goldilocks.

00:03:39.585 --> 00:03:41.053
Okay, now, that's...

00:03:41.086 --> 00:03:42.555
that's an immigrant
I can get behind.

00:03:42.588 --> 00:03:45.091
Cute, sweet, hates nature.

00:03:45.124 --> 00:03:46.692
And something
about her blonde hair

00:03:46.725 --> 00:03:48.761
just fits with my idea
of America.

00:03:48.794 --> 00:03:51.597
Yeah, well, well, that's
the ultimate skill, Jordan:

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.165
looking like you fit in.

00:03:53.198 --> 00:03:56.435
Just ask John Kelly's
great-grandparents.

00:03:56.468 --> 00:03:58.437
But make sure
you do it in Italian,

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:59.772
'cause they don't speak a word
of English.

00:03:59.805 --> 00:04:00.673
Yes. Thanks, Kobi.

00:04:00.706 --> 00:04:01.908
The fight continues.
