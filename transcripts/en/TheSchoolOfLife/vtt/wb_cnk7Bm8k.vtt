00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:06.630
Like many things that help our relationships,
couples therapy has a habit of sounding appallingly

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:14.099
unromantic, involving patience, gruelling
work and a host of embarrassing conversations

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.830
about matters it would be much nicer never
to have to think about – let alone discuss

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:25.330
with a partner and a trained stranger. Our
culture teaches us to trust and follow our

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:32.340
feelings. But couples therapy knows this is
to be a disaster, for our feelings are for

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:40.030
the most part errant and encoded with primitive
responses from a troubled past. So instead,

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:48.149
it encourages a far wiser response: standing
well back from our first impulses, neutralising

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:54.030
them through understanding and where possible
rerouting them in less self-punishing and

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.510
more trusting directions. Related image Living
alongside another person is obviously one

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:05.680
of the hardest things we ever attempt; we
should expect to get it wrong unaided and

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:12.450
feel unashamed about the need for in-depth
training. There are a number of vital things

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.780
we might learn in couples therapy: – For
a start, in a quiet room, we finally have

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.759
the chance to define what we feel the problems
in the relationship really are – without

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:31.469
things immediately degenerating into shouting,
sulking or cynical avoidance. We’re normally

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:37.990
far too cross with, or upset by, our partner
to be able to share with them, in a way they’d

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:44.700
understand, what we’re so angry and upset
about. It helps to be in front of a stranger

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.679
we’re both a little intimidated by and have
to behave ourselves with. It is highly unusual

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:58.200
to be able to put things so starkly but also
so reasonably: ‘That you never touch me

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.100
and behave so limply and unenthusiastically
when I touch you is slowly killing me – and

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.479
though I love you, I don’t know how much
longer I can take it…’ How much better

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:16.390
than a decade of low level sniping and repressed
fury. – Secondly, therapists are skilled

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:23.440
at teasing out from us why what bothers us
bother us. Normally, left to our own devices,

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.940
we don’t unearth the emotional meaning behind
our positions. We squabble about where to

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:35.080
go on the weekend, rather than explaining
what exactly going out or staying in represents

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:42.269
for us internally. And as a result, the other
finds us merely stubborn and mean; and all

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:49.459
that is interesting and poignant in our position
is lost. – Thirdly, therapists break up

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:56.740
unseen repeated patterns of upset and retaliation.
A classic therapeutic game is to ask both

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:07.360
parties to fill in the blanks: When you ….., I
feel ….. – and I respond by …. So when

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:13.030
you disregard the children, I feel rejected
and then respond by trying to control who

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:19.680
you see in the evenings. Or when you don’t
touch me in bed, I feel invisible and respond

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:26.110
by being ungrateful about your money. – With
the therapist acting as an honest broker,

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:33.010
new contracts can be drawn up, along the lines
of: If you do x, I will do y… Once we get

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:38.480
a little bit of what we really want (but usually
haven’t properly asked for), the other’s

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:45.310
needs feel a lot less onerous and hateful.
– Sometimes the advice is almost beautifully

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:52.019
pedantic. Name three things you resent about
your partner. And, next, three things you

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:58.519
deeply appreciate. Also, keep the criticism
specific: not ‘you’re cold and ungrateful’

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:03.890
but ‘if you can call me when you’re running
late, then…’ Families can be kept intact

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.900
with little more than this. Image result for
matisse paintings love – Through therapy,

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:13.470
we are challenged to abandon some of our grimmer
ideas about how people can be and what will

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:19.830
happen to us in love: If I am vulnerable,
I am not necessarily going to be hurt… I

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:25.820
might try to explain, and the other could
listen… We are given the security to throw

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:32.570
out some of the scripts we grew up with about
the futility of ever trying to be understood.

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:38.000
– We can start to be moved by one another’s
pain. What does it feel like, a good therapist

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.000
will ask, to hear your partner explain how
it is for them when you… We can start to

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.600
take care of each other. A remarkable idea
comes to the fore; that this isn’t really

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:56.540
our enemy, that they – like us – have
some very bad ways of getting across what

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:04.420
are, at heart, some very understandable and
touching needs. Couples therapy is a classroom

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:10.250
where we can learn how to love. We’re normally
so embarrassed at not having the first clue

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:15.530
how to do so, we leave things until we are
too angry or despairing to do anything but

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:22.250
hate. The most hopeful and therefore romantic
thing we can ever do in love is sometimes

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:28.120
to declare that we haven’t yet learned how
to love – but, with a little help, are very

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.280
keen to learn one day.

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:39.040
