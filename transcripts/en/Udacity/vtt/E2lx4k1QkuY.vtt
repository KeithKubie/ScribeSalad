00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now let's go ahead and redefine bridge problem in terms of lowest cost search,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
thereby generalizing it.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
In the initialization code you might need here a single call to lowest&lt;u&gt;cost&lt;u&gt;search.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;

00:00:11.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Any other functions you need to define here.
