00:00:03.437 --> 00:00:04.771
AT COLUMBIA RECORDS,

00:00:04.771 --> 00:00:08.041
AND THEN HIS MOTHER WRITES HIM
A LETTER--

00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:12.980
YOUR HERO, JOHNNY CASH,
IS A DRUG ADDICT,

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.748
AND OF COURSE HE SINGS
AT SAN QUENTIN

00:00:14.748 --> 00:00:15.883
AND FOLSOM RIGHT NOW,

00:00:15.883 --> 00:00:18.051
BECAUSE A JAILBIRD
SINGS WITH JAILBIRDS,

00:00:18.051 --> 00:00:20.287
SO WE HAVE NOW OFFICIALLY
DISOWNED YOU.

00:00:20.287 --> 00:00:21.822
I HOPE SOMEHOW YOU COME
TO YOUR SENSES,

00:00:21.822 --> 00:00:23.290
'CAUSE YOU'RE NOT
A SONGWRITER.

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:25.492
SORRY, KRIS.
YOU'RE DONE.

00:00:28.161 --> 00:00:29.730
AND HE FELT LIKE
A GIANT FAILURE.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.665
HE'S A [bleep] JANITOR.

00:00:31.665 --> 00:00:34.268
AND THEN ONE DAY
JOHNNY CASH COMES IN.

00:00:34.268 --> 00:00:37.404
HE'S LIKE, WHO IN THE WORLD
IS IN THERE RIGHT NOW

00:00:37.404 --> 00:00:39.573
CHANGING THE ASHTRAYS
WITH THOSE BROWN--

00:00:39.573 --> 00:00:42.176
WITH THE INCREDIBLE
BLUE EYES?

00:00:42.176 --> 00:00:44.178
WELL, IT'S KRIS.
WHO IS HE?

00:00:44.178 --> 00:00:48.482
HIS MOM JUST DISOWNED HIM
BECAUSE YOU'RE HIS HERO.

00:00:48.482 --> 00:00:52.319
AND KRIS WAS IN THERE
CHANGING THE ASHTRAYS,

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:54.555
AND JOHNNY CASH COMES IN
AND SAYS,

00:00:54.555 --> 00:00:58.125
WELL, IT'S ALWAYS NICE TO GET
A LETTER FROM HOME, AIN'T IT?

00:00:58.125 --> 00:00:59.693
AND KRIS CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

00:00:59.693 --> 00:01:00.794
HE'S LIKE, YEAH.

00:01:00.794 --> 00:01:02.095
BUT THEY BONDED OVER IT,

00:01:02.095 --> 00:01:04.698
BECAUSE HE WAS PASSIONATE
AND HE HAD HIS DREAM.

00:01:04.698 --> 00:01:06.567
I'M GONNA QUIT ALL THIS,

00:01:06.567 --> 00:01:09.069
AND I WANT TO PURSUE
AN ARTIST'S LIFE.

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:10.904
SO HE QUIT.

00:01:10.904 --> 00:01:14.474
KRIS IS STARVING.
HE HAS NO MONEY.

00:01:14.474 --> 00:01:16.610
HE'S NOW WRITING
THESE SONGS.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.981
AND THEN KRIS, SO FRUSTRATED,
AND HE HAS ONE SONG.

00:01:20.981 --> 00:01:23.183
IT'S ABOUT THAT FEELING
TO BE ON A SUNDAY

00:01:23.183 --> 00:01:25.085
WHEN THE BARS DON'T OPEN,

00:01:25.085 --> 00:01:27.454
AND IT'S CALLED
<i>SUNDAY MORNING COMING DOWN.</i>

00:01:27.454 --> 00:01:28.922
IT'S A THAT FEELING,
LONELINESS

00:01:28.922 --> 00:01:31.725
AND NOBODY BELIEVING IN YOU
BUT YOU

00:01:31.725 --> 00:01:34.995
AND WISHING,
LORD, THAT I WAS STONED,

00:01:34.995 --> 00:01:36.797
'CAUSE THERE AIN'T NOTHING
IN A SUNDAY

00:01:36.797 --> 00:01:38.732
THAT MAKES A BODY
FEEL ALONE.

00:01:38.732 --> 00:01:41.268
<i>SUNDAY MORNING COMING DOWN</i>
WAS THE SONG KRIS KNEW

00:01:41.268 --> 00:01:43.804
WAS SOMETHING SPECIAL.

00:01:43.804 --> 00:01:45.739
HOW CAN I GET MY SONG
TO JOHNNY CASH

00:01:45.739 --> 00:01:47.941
AND MAKE AN IMPACT?

00:01:51.378 --> 00:01:53.380
SO, FOR JOHNNY,

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.118
KRIS LANDED A HELICOPTER
IN HIS LAWN

00:01:58.118 --> 00:02:00.854
TO GIVE HIM THIS SONG.

00:02:00.854 --> 00:02:04.658
SOME FOOL'S LANDING
IN OUR YARD WITH A HELICOPTER

00:02:04.658 --> 00:02:08.495
RIGHT OUT OF THE SKY.

00:02:08.495 --> 00:02:09.763
HE REALLY LISTENED TO THE SONG,

00:02:09.763 --> 00:02:12.366
AND THE SONG WENT
TO THE NEXT LEVEL FOR JOHNNY,

00:02:12.366 --> 00:02:13.600
BECAUSE HE UNDERSTOOD IT.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.403
HE UNDERSTOOD THE ISOLATION
AND THE LONELINESS

00:02:16.403 --> 00:02:19.473
AND WISHING,
LORD, THAT HE WAS STONED.

00:02:21.708 --> 00:02:24.545
EXCUSE ME.
- YOU'RE FINE.

00:02:24.545 --> 00:02:27.748
- [burps]
