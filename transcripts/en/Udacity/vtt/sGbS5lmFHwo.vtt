00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.733
So now that we are finished designing our project, here

00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:05.710
is your assignment. We want you to show the program

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:09.240
we've written together to a friend or a colleague. Now,

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.180
you can continue to use the Profanity Editor website which

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.309
is wdyl.com, or you can use some sort of a

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.190
different internet service like Pirate Speech. By the way, the

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.310
link to this is available in the instructor notes. While

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.530
you are doing that we want you to use your smart

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.100
phone to record a video of the conversation with your

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.440
friend or colleague. And then we want you to share your

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.520
YouTube video with us on the discussion forum. Make sure

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.150
you check this box after submitting your responses on the forum.
