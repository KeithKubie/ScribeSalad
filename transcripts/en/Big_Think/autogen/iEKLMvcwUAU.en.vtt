with a great idea one is that you're

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120
with a great idea one is that you're
 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.850

probably the wrong person implemented
 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.829
probably the wrong person implemented
and the other is that you're not done

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839
and the other is that you're not done

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730
you learn to be better at coming up with
 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.580
you learn to be better at coming up with
ideas and what can you do with your

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590
ideas and what can you do with your
 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.259
ideas and what can you do with your
great ideas you don't know what to do

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269
great ideas you don't know what to do
 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.650
great ideas you don't know what to do
with one example I like the idea of

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660
with one example I like the idea of
 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.900

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.740
on your food but if I did that brought
to market in the end I think I would be

that's where they're going because they
 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.840
that's where they're going because they
take the foot off the gas really quickly

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850
take the foot off the gas really quickly
 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.749

the brake light on by ms extra times it
 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.039
the brake light on by ms extra times it
doesn't really matter and so you might

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049
doesn't really matter and so you might
 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.810
doesn't really matter and so you might
get that brake light going on a tenth of

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820
get that brake light going on a tenth of
 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.789
get that brake light going on a tenth of
a second quicker and that could prevent

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799
a second quicker and that could prevent
 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.160
a second quicker and that could prevent
an accident so somebody starts off with

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170
an accident so somebody starts off with
 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.109
an accident so somebody starts off with
a really good idea brake lights that

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119
