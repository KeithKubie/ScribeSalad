00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.400
For all the action, mistakes, easter eggs
and cameos in blockbuster movies, the drama

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.000
and comedy behind the scenes can be just as
awesome.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.710
We're changing things up, and giving you a
rapid fire dose of movie trivia you never

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:18.939
thought to look for.

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:23.360
Screen Rant presents: Know Your Movies: 20
Amazing Movie Secrets That Will Blow Your

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:24.360
Mind!

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.360
Jurassic World

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.689
The product placement in the Jurassic Park
sequel stuck out like a sore thumb - but it

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:29.849
wasn't the studio's work.

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.710
The director actually requested the sponsors,
claiming that if the park were opened today,

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.090
every part of it would be branded.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:36.540
The Avengers: Age of Ultron

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.220
The final battle is set in Sokovia, but it
was filmed at a London police training college.

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.060
The statue in the town square was given a
fake beard, since it's a well-known monument

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.720
to Robert Peel, the inventor of the modern
police force, and the reason British cops

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.080
are still called "bobbies."

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.750
Furious Seven (NOT "7")

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.350
The director James Wan ("Juan") confused everyone
when he said that the seven in the title was

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.220
the WORD, not the movie's place in the series.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.220
Why?

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.040
Apparently the movie's title is actually a
tribute to the classic Japanese movie Seven

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.220
Samurai, with Wan seeing Dominic Toretto and
his team as Hollywood's modern - horsepowered

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.220
- Samurai.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.220
The Martian

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.780
The secret NASA mission to save a stranded
astronaut is given the title "Project Elrond,"

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.189
a reference to a secret meeting in The Lord
of the Rings.

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:16.110
When Ridley Scott realized Sean Bean was actually
IN that movie scene, and would also explain

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.130
the name in this film, he wanted to change
it.

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.890
But the crew demanded it stay, since the joke
was actually a hilarious coincidence.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.880
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation
Tom Cruise is famous for doing his own massive

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.490
stunts, climbing skyscrapers or hanging onto
an airplane.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.609
But the actor's training even covers the stunt
driving in Rogue Nation.

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:34.789
It wasn't to meet the star's demands, either
- the stunt coordinator claimed he didn't

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:37.270
have a stunt driver who was better than Cruise.

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.649
Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:42.109
Back in 1983, when interviewed about Return
Of The Jedi, Mark Hamill gave an interview

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:46.979
to TV-AM in the UK and told reporters George
Lucas spoke of bringing Luke Skywalker back

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.289
as an Obi-Wan type character training a new
generation of Jedi in Episode VII.

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:54.719
He also said Episode VII wouldn’t happen
until 2011…

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:55.719
Ant-Man

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:58.500
Any superhero actor has to hit the gym before
shooting their scenes, but apparently, Paul

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.249
Rudd was more committed to getting into shape
than Marvel expected.

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:05.060
When they started shooting, the Ant-Man costume
had to be altered to compensate for Rudd's

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.319
added muscle and lost fat.

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:09.140
And an unscripted shirtless scene was added
shortly after.

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.300
Mad Max: Fury Road

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.440
The villain of Fury Road is larger than life
in every way - except for the weapon he seems

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.540
to be praying to.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.210
That's an authentic Australian waddy, a weapon
used as recently as World War I.

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:22.720
When the actor's mother-in-law left it to
him, he asked the director to work it into

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:42.610
the movie, and the rest is history.

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:43.690
Guardians of the Galaxy

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.110
Marvel may be churning out blockbusters, but
they don't spend money if they don't have

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.110
to.

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.390
The massive set constructed for the Kyln prison
in Guardians of the Galaxy was so expensive

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.530
to build, the studio only agreed to foot the
bill after planning to melt down all the steel

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.840
after filming, and sell it back to the supplier.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.700
Captain America: The Winter Soldier

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.490
The Nick Fury chase scene through city streets
was a hit with fans because it actually seemed

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:03.510
realistic - but they didn't know just how
realistic it was.

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.400
The sequence was based on a 2010 Brazilian
police chase that looks exactly the same,

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.860
and the directors even played the police video
as part of their original pitch to Marvel.

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:11.860
The LEGO Movie

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.670
A major highlight of the movie is Liam Neeson's
role as both Good Cop and Bad Cop.

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.230
The directors wanted to record them separately,
but Neeson thought it would be better to rapidly

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.470
switch from one to the other.

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.780
The result was a crazed, manic split-personality
filled with improvisation - and fans loved

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:25.810
every second.

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.230
X-Men: Days of Future Past

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.940
The movie that rebooted the X-Men movie universe
had it all: new mutants, returning favorites...

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.030
even a romance between Wolverine and Storm.

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.700
The future scene was deleted, but it showed
the movie versions of the heroes finally gave

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.140
in to their attraction like they had multiple
times in the comics.

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.140
Maybe the second time is the charm.

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.270
Dawn of the Planet of The Apes

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.230
The movie's original ending saw the apes watching
as battleships approached in San Francisco

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.030
Bay, promising an imminent war.

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.040
Director Matt Reeves decided to go with a
more emotional ending between the movie's

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.290
ape and human leads.

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.300
It's a incredible ending scene, even though
it was filmed weeks before release, Reeves

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.540
directing via Skype, and a stand-in for Andy
Serkis' actually on set.

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.310
The Amazing Spider-Man 2

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.540
It may have killed Sony's solo Spider-Man
series, but the original ending would have

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.290
had fans talking for years.

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.080
Peter's father Richard Parker coming back
from the dead is one thing, but showing Venom

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.330
in OsCorp's basement - along with the frozen
head of Norman Osborn - leaves every fan with

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.570
unanswered questions of what would have come
next.

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:17.570
Gone Girl

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.850
In all the suspense and twists and turns of
this story, audiences probably missed some

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.590
time-consuming CG effects.

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.290
According to director David Fincher, with
the number and variety of wigs that star Rosamund

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.981
Pike had to wear, there isn't a single shot
of her in the movie that didn't require a

00:04:29.981 --> 00:04:31.490
special effects team to retouch her hairline.

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:32.490
Who knew to even look?

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:33.490
Man of Steel

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.160
When Henry Cavill showed up for his Superman
screen test, the prototype costume wasn't

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.150
available - so they used the classic Christopher
Reeve version instead.

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.060
When Cavill stepped out of wardrobe in the
brightly coloured, outdated suit with bright

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.600
red underwear, and everyone on set grew quiet,
he knew he had found the man for the job.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:46.600
Interstellar

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.080
The sprawling corn field used in just a few
scenes required 500 acres to be planted and

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.080
grown.

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.910
It might sound like insanity on Christopher
Nolan's part, but when shooting wrapped, the

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.480
corn was sold - for a hefty profit.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.480
Frozen

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.610
Most fans know this Disney hit is based on
"The Snow Queen" by Hans Christian Andersen.

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.820
But the main characters' names are no coincidence.

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:08.020
Say them out loud fast enough, and "Hans,
Kristoff, Anna, Sven" is clearly a play on

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.150
the author's name that few will catch on their
own.

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:11.150
Jurassic Park

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:15.540
Director Steven Spielberg had young actresses
record blood-curdling screams to see how they'd

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.360
handle the movie's terrifying twists.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.810
When he played actress Ariana Richards' tape,
and it was the only recorded Scream to raise

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:24.440
his wife from bed in a panic, he realized
he had found his Lex.

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.580

movie facts, but let us know which ones we
