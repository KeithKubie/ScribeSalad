00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
One of the pioneers in computing was Admiral Grace Hopper.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
She was famous for walking around with nanosticks,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
which were pieces of wire that were the length light would travel in a nanosecond--

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
30 cm long.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Grace Hopper wrote one of the first languages,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and the language COBOL, which she is seen holding here next to UNIVAC,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
was for a long time the most widely-used computer language.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
She was one of the first people to think about writing languages this way,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
["Nobody believed that I had a running compiler and nobody would touch it.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
They told me computers could only do arithmetic." Grace Hopper]

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and you have this quote when she talked about writing compiler,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and a compiler is a program that produces other programs, like Python.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
The difference between a compiler and an interpreter like Python

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
is the compiler does all the work at once and then runs the new program

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
whereas with an interpreter like Python you're doing this work at the same time.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
But she had this great quote talking about no one believing that she could do such a thing,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and they told her that computers could only do arithmetic.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
So far we've only seen computers do arithmetic.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
We're going to see lots more interesting things in our Python program soon.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
There's a link on the website to a video of Grace Hopper's appearance

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
on the David Letterman Show where she gives him a nanostick.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I hope you'll enjoy watching that.
