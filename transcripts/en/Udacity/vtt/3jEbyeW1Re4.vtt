00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:03.110
When creating axis in d3,

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:08.760
I would say the hard part is finding out the proper scales for both your axes.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:15.080
Once you have them, as we do here, creating a d3 axis object is quite simple.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.870
Since our code's getting slightly more verbose.

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:20.992
At least compared to the Dimple JS code we had earlier.

00:00:20.992 --> 00:00:24.020
I've added comments to each section of the d3 code,

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.220
to describe what functions performed with N.

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.320
I've also moved the debugger down from the top of the file to right before we

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.980
create our axes.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:40.970
In this case, the axis function.axis is in d3's svg module.

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.510
To create an svg axis, and we need to specify a scale

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.400
using .scale to tell d3, what the range of the axis represents.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.900
In this case passing in time_scale for our x axis.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:54.860
And since d3's so

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:00.940
flexible, we can chain other functions to our axis, to customize its appearance.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.200
In this case, we want our ticks to be, every two years.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:10.850
In this case to specify years we go into the d3 time module and specify years.

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:16.200
If we wanted a finer grain we could specify a different time object.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.390
For example, let's say days.

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.000
But in our case, since the World Cup happens only every four years,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.240
specifying every tick mark every two years, should be more than enough.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.460
And here we do the same thing for our y axis.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.590
Passing the scale of count_scale,

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.590
which represents our attendance range and domain, and

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.080
since this is the y axis, we specified that we want to orient it on the left.

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.980
So we now have our d3 axis objects, but

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.660
what we don't have, is the axis in svg on our page.
