00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.850
- [Voiceover] Let's say that
you have a cholesterol test,

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.090
and you know, you somehow magically know

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:08.050
that the probability that it is accurate,

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:13.050
that it gives the correct
results is 99, 99%.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.720
You have a 99 out of
100 chance that any time

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.320
you apply this test, that
it is going to be accurate.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.650
Now let's say that you, and
you just magically know that,

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:25.350
we're just assuming that.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.390
Now let's just say that you
get 100 folks into this room

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.320
and you apply this test
to all 100 of them.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.320
So apply, apply test 100 times.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.450
So what are some of the
possible outcomes here?

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.990
Is it for sure that 99,
exactly 99 out of the 100

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.950
are going to be accurate
and that 1 out of the 100

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.420
is gonna be inaccurate?

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.850
Well that's definitely
a likely possibility,

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.550
but it's also possible
you get a little lucky

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.450
and all 100 are accurate,
or you get a little unlucky

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.190
and that 98 are accurate
and that two are inaccurate.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.580
And actually, I calculated the
probabilities ahead of time,

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:03.650
and the goal of this video isn't to go

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.090
into the probability
and combinatorics of it,

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.050
but if you're curious about it,

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:08.490
there's a lot of good
videos on probability

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.290
and combinatorics on Khan Academy,

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.120
but I calculated ahead of time,

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.450
and the probability, if you have something

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.650
that has a 99% chance of being accurate,

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.520
and you apply it 100 times,

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.100
the probability that it is accurate,

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.950
that it is accurate 100
out of the 100 times,

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.320
is approximately equal to,

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.720
approximately equal to 36.6%.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.020
I rounded to the nearest
tenth of a percent.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.220
So it's a little better
than a third chance

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.990
that you'll actually
get, all of the people

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.150
are going to get an accurate result,

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.390
even though for any one of them

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.990
there's a 99% chance that it is accurate.

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.050
Now we could keep going,

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:48.750
the probability that it is accurate,

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.050
I'm just gonna put these quotes here

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:51.950
so I don't have to rewrite
accurate over and over again,

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.690
the probability that it is
accurate 99 out of 100 times,

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.690
I calculated it ahead of time,
it is approximately 37.0%.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:03.520
So this is what you would expect,

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.750
getting 100 out of 100
doesn't seem that unlikely

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.290
if each of the times you apply it

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.590
has a 99% chance of being accurate,

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.790
but it makes sense that
you would expect 99 out 100

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.510
to be even more likely,
slightly more likely.

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.720
And we can of course keep going,

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.020
the probability that it is accurate

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:25.020
98 out of 100 times is
approximately 18.5%.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.350
And I'm just gonna do a few more.

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.090
The probability that it is accurate

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.620
97 out of 100 times, and once again

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.810
I calculated all of these ahead of time,

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.150
is 6%, so it's definitely
in the realm of possibility,

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.190
but it's, the probability is much lower

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.950
than having 99 out of 100 or
100 out of 100 being accurate,

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.790
and then the probability, let
me put the double quotes here,

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:52.920
the probability that it is accurate

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.920
96 out of 100 times is approximately 1.5%,

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.080
and then the probability,
and I'll just do one more,

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.450
I could keep going, the probability,

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:04.420
you know, there's some probability

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.550
that even though each
test has a 99% chance

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.020
you just get super unlucky
and that, you know,

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.650
very few of them are
accurate, well I'll just,

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:11.990
and you see, you see what's happening

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:14.760
to the probabilities as we have

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.950
fewer and fewer of them being accurate,

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.650
it becomes less and less probable.

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.520
So the probability that 95 out of the 100

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.520
are accurate is, is approximately 0.3%.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.520
So this was just kind of a,

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.790
I guess you could say
a thought experiment.

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.620
If we had a test that we know for sure

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:37.750
that every time you administer it,

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.790
the probability that
it is accurate is 99%,

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:41.850
then these are the probabilities

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.520
that if you administered it 100 times,

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.810
that you get 100 out 100 accurate,

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.380
the probability that you
get 99 out of 100 accurate,

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.210
and so on and so forth.

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:51.450
So let's just keep that in mind,

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.950
and then think a little bit
about hypothesis testing,

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.050
and how we can use this framework.

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:58.950
So let's put all that in
the back of our minds,

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.410
and let's say that you
have devised a new test,

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.820
you have a new test, and you
don't know how accurate it is.

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.120
You have a new cholesterol test,

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.510
you don't know how accurate it is,

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.920
you know that in order
for it to be approved

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.330
by whatever governing body
it has to be accurate 99,

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:21.090
the probability of it being
accurate has to be 99%.

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:26.090
So needs to have probability of accurate,

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.220
accurate equal to 99%.

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:33.150
You don't know if this is true,

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.520
you just know that that's
what it needs to be.

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:36.490
And so you have your test,

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.020
and let's you set up a hypothesis,

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.450
and your hypothesis
could be a lot of things,

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:42.520
and once you get deeper into
statistics, there's, you know,

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.690
null hypothesis and alternate hypotheses,

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.650
but let's just start with
just a simple hypothesis,

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.650
you're hopeful, your hypothesis
is that the probability

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:57.590
that your new test is accurate is,

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.290
this is your hypothesis,
because you want that

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:04.520
to be your hypothesis cause
if you feel good about it,

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.350
then you're like, okay,
yeah, maybe I'll get approved

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:08.150
by the appropriate governing body.

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.390
So you say, "Hey, my hypothesis is that

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:13.650
"my new test is accurate
99, the probability

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.580
"of it being accurate is 99%."

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.850
So then you go off and
you apply it 100 times.

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:22.590
So you apply your new test,

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:25.120
you don't know the actual
probability of it being accurate,

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:30.120
you apply the test 100 times.

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:33.360
And let's say out of those 100 times

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.220
you get that they are accurate,

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.950
you get that it is
accurate, and you're able

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:40.650
to use some other test that you, you know,

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.320
some for-sure test, some
super accurate test,

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.520
to verify your own test results,

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:50.050
and you see that it is accurate
95 out of the 100 times.

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:51.920
So the question you have is, well,

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.020
does the hypothesis make sense to you?

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.520
Will you accept this hypothesis?

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.750
Well what you say is, well,
"If my hypothesis was true,

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:03.520
"if my test were accurate 99,

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:07.990
"if the probability of my
test being accurate is 99%,

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:11.590
"what's the probability of
me getting this outcome?"

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:12.650
Well, we figured that out.

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:16.520
If it really was accurate 99% of the time,

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:21.520
then the probability of getting
this outcome is only 0.3%.

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:27.590
So if you assume true,
if you assume hypothesis,

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:32.010
hypothesis, I'll just write "hyp,"

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:34.590
if you assume the hypothesis is true,

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:37.190
the probability of the outcome you got,

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:42.190
probability of observed
outcome is approximately 0.3%.

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:50.420
And so you say, "Look, you know,

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:52.650
"maybe, it's definitely possible

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:55.750
"that I just got very,
very, very, very unlikely,

00:06:55.750 --> 00:07:00.050
"but based on this, I probably
should reject my hypothesis,

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:04.250
"because the probability
of me getting this outcome,

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:05.210
"if the hypothesis was true,

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:07.120
"is very, very, very, very low."

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.850
And as we go deeper into statistics,

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:11.720
you'll see that there are
thresholds that people often set,

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.250
for, you know, if the probability
of something happening

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:16.920
or not happening is above
or below some threshold,

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:19.550
then we might reject a certain hypothesis.

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:21.750
But in this world, you
could see that, look,

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:24.190
if my test really was
accurate 99% of the time,

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:26.750
for me to get, when I
apply it to 100 people,

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:28.820
it's only accurate 95 out of 100,

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:31.390
if my hypothesis is true,
that would have only,

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:34.090
there's only a 0.3% chance

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:36.090
that I would have seen this observation.

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:38.650
So based on that, it might be
completely reasonable to say,

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:41.820
"You know what, I might
reject my hypothesis,

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:44.020
"look for a new test, I don't feel good

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:47.370
"about this new cholesterol
test that I constructed."
