00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.166
ALISTAIR POTT: Hi, everyone.

00:00:01.166 --> 00:00:03.740
So I am Alistair.

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.781
I lead the commerce
team in Google Play.

00:00:06.781 --> 00:00:09.030
And I'm going to talk a bit
about commerce in general,

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.980
and subscriptions in
particular, something

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.260
that we're very,
very excited about.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:14.040
What is commerce?

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.330
What is our vision?

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.662
So this sentence is
kind of a mouthful.

00:00:18.662 --> 00:00:20.370
The way we think about
this is like, Play

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:23.340
is this gigantic, gigantic
digital marketplace, so

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.720
over a billion users out there,
like millions of developers

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.130
or millions of apps out there.

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.840
[INAUDIBLE] those people.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.749
And a marketplace is
about transactions.

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:35.040
It's about linking those
buyers, linking those sellers,

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.840
making those
transactions happen.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.280
That's what our team is about.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.800
Our aim is to build
energy in that flywheel.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.150
More buyers equals more sellers.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.850
More sellers equals more buyers.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.720
And so when we wake
up in the morning,

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.820
we're thinking about building
energy in that ecosystem.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.600
That's what commerce is
about in Google Play.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.420
We love to have strategic
pillars or tenets.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.511
And Larissa briefly
touched on these, the ways

00:00:57.511 --> 00:00:59.260
that we think about
the commerce platform.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:00.577
So number one is reach.

00:01:00.577 --> 00:01:02.910
In that previous slide, we
had the the word "ubiquitous"

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.449
and the word "global."

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:06.510
Our business is built,
Android is built,

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.240
on massive, massive reach-- well
over a billion users out there.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.850
We aim to make it possible
for every one of those users

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:12.975
to transact on Google Play.

00:01:12.975 --> 00:01:14.766
And I'm going to tell
you a little bit more

00:01:14.766 --> 00:01:16.690
about the things that
we do in that space.

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.240
The second is conversion.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.840
Once you've built an app
or built an experience that

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.140
is causing the user to
enter a transaction flow,

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.910
our team makes
sure that the user

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:28.890
comes out the end of
that transaction flow

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:29.860
having made a purchase.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.830
So conversion is
a huge, huge deal.

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.180
We have a whole team of people.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.920
Again, when they're brushing
their teeth in the morning,

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.961
they're thinking about
how to increase conversion

00:01:36.961 --> 00:01:38.277
in your apps.

00:01:38.277 --> 00:01:39.360
We also think about trust.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.110
Actually, David, who
leads the trust team,

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.670
is going to be giving a talk on
what he calls fair play later

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:45.630
on today.

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.640
This ecosystem is built
on repeat transactions.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.100
Our users make tens,
hundreds, sometimes thousands

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.150
of transactions
in the ecosystem.

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:53.050
This is real money.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.390
These are real experiences.

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.070
We are like a retail platform.

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.320
We have to build and
maintain trust for our users.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.150
And so we focus a lot on that.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.872
And then the last
tenet is growth.

00:02:01.872 --> 00:02:04.080
We believe that there are
things that Google Play can

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.839
do to drive energy
in this ecosystem.

00:02:05.839 --> 00:02:08.130
We can put the right offers
in front of the right users

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.989
at the right times.

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:10.530
And so we've got a
growth team that's

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.229
also focusing on building
energy in that flywheel.

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:16.270
So we talked about reach.

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.300
So we have huge,
huge, huge reach.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.470
This stuff is hard.

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.390
So we have transactions
enabled in over 130 countries.

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.870
And we have lots and lots
of local forms of payments.

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.120
So credit cards are great.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.745
That's awesome.

00:02:27.745 --> 00:02:29.495
But the fact of the
matter is that there's

00:02:29.495 --> 00:02:31.500
a huge number of users
out there who do not

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.052
have access to a credit card.

00:02:33.052 --> 00:02:35.010
And we need to make it
possible for those users

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.180
to transact on our platform.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.724
I always talk to the team about
some farmer in rural Indonesia

00:02:40.724 --> 00:02:43.140
who doesn't have access to a
credit card, who doesn't even

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.860
have a bank account.

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.026
How are we going to make
it possible for that person

00:02:46.026 --> 00:02:48.040
to make a transaction
on the platform?

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.456
So one of the things we've
done is direct carrier billing,

00:02:50.456 --> 00:02:51.570
or DCB.

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.080
At I/O, we announced that we've
crossed over 100 carriers.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.790
Just a few months
later, we're actually

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.730
a bit over 115 carriers
around the world who have

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.052
direct carrier billing enabled.

00:03:01.052 --> 00:03:03.510
What this means is that a user
who doesn't have that credit

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.540
card, who doesn't have access to
a traditional form of payment,

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.689
can make transactions
in your apps.

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:09.480
This stuff is hard.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.860
I'll be honest with you.

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.930
Just recently, I
was having my brain

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.480
melted by the requirements
for direct carrier billing

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.384
in Kuwait.

00:03:16.384 --> 00:03:18.550
But it's worth it, because
once we figured that out,

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.580
and once we launched direct
carrier billing in Kuwait,

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:21.960
buyer growth suddenly took off.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:22.890
Conversion took off.

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.625
Everything took off in Kuwait.

00:03:24.625 --> 00:03:27.000
So we have a big team that
wakes up and thinks about this

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.541
all the time.

00:03:27.541 --> 00:03:30.564
And now we have more
than 600 million devices

00:03:30.564 --> 00:03:31.980
around the world
which have access

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.530
to direct carrier billing.

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.250
So you'll have access to
those to sell to those users.

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.370
Subscriptions-- so
subscriptions is a huge deal.

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.170
We think this is the
next big business

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:44.850
model for in-app billing.

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.530
So over the last
few years, we've

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.614
seen massive, massive growth
in the subscriptions ecosystem.

00:03:49.614 --> 00:03:51.030
And the fact of
the matter is this

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.050
is a great way for you
to monetize your apps.

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:56.730
If you're selling a service
or ongoing access to content,

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.520
it's much better to build
it as a recurring service

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.650
than to sell it one time
and support it forever.

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.410
So we're seeing a lot of
adoption of the subscriptions

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:05.340
business model.

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:06.840
Many developers
are getting bored.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.240
And as a result, we're
seeing massive growth.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.620
We think this can
easily continue

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.900
in the future, this
enormous growth.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.540
So we focus extremely,
extremely hard on subscriptions.

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.880
We're seeing a lot of
developers getting on board.

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.180
Many of you in the room are
subscriptions business models,

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.740
and so we love working with you.

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.302
As you can tell, we're
focusing on this.

00:04:25.302 --> 00:04:26.760
You'll see more
and more developers

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.400
on this slide in years going
forwards across a million

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.260
different business models.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.240
So again, you can tell I
love strategic pillars.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.849
The subscriptions team
also has strategic pillars.

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:38.640
And we're going to talk
about each of these

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.330
in a little more detail.

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:41.580
So the first is integration.

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.130
We want to make it easy
for developers or sellers

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.380
such as yourselves to integrate
with our subscriptions

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:47.720
platform.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:48.970
We've made some good progress.

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.095
We've got a long way to go.

00:04:50.095 --> 00:04:51.660
We'll talk about that.

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.936
We also want to make sure
that sign-up really, really,

00:04:53.936 --> 00:04:54.810
really works for you.

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.370
This is our strongest area,
largely to do with that reach.

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.650
And we'll talk about
that in more detail.

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.650
Subscriptions are the
gift that keeps on giving,

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.550
but only if you can
retain those subscribers.

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:05.700
So retention is a
huge, huge deal for us.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.040
This stuff is tricky, and
we have a big team focused

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.350
entirely on driving retention.

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.870
And then lastly, running
or managing a subscriptions

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:13.620
business is tough.

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.200
It's a lot of
data-based information.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.300
You need to really be
looking at your cohorts.

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.460
And we want to make that
easy for you as well.

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.890
So I mentioned
briefly integration.

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:27.799
If you're a simple developer
or a mobile-first developer,

00:05:27.799 --> 00:05:29.590
integrating with our
subscriptions platform

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:30.890
is extremely, extremely easy.

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:32.780
It's like any other
in-app billing.

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.440
But we're aware that many
of you are multi-platform.

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.050
You have a very sophisticated
order management system

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:39.280
behind what you're doing.

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.170
And so sometimes, integrating
with us can be a bit of a pain.

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:43.870
And so the integration
team is working

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:45.610
on making that easier--
building features

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:47.200
for you to make
it easier for you

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:48.908
to integrate with our
platform and to run

00:05:48.908 --> 00:05:50.515
your business on our platform.

00:05:50.515 --> 00:05:53.140
And we'll talk a bit about some
of the features that are coming

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:56.300
up in this space as well.

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.630
Sign-up-- this is the big one.

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:00.870
Sign-up is a huge,
huge deal for us.

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:02.740
The conversion team is
thinking about this.

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:04.760
And this is also where the
reach team comes into account.

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:05.759
So there are two things.

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:08.650
The one is, do we have
access to a form of payment

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:10.060
that the user also
has access to?

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:11.140
And that's where
this direct carrier

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:12.340
billing comes into account.

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:15.130
We have gift cards
in over 30 countries.

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:17.080
We have PayPal in
many countries.

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.330
We have local forms of
payment in other countries.

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:21.247
So does the user
have access to a form

00:06:21.247 --> 00:06:22.330
of payment is a huge deal.

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:24.637
Otherwise, they just cannot
convert in your experience.

00:06:24.637 --> 00:06:27.220
And then the second thing is we
actually have a lot of buyers.

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.620
We have huge numbers of
people who have already

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.356
added a form of payment to
the Google Play ecosystem who

00:06:32.356 --> 00:06:33.730
are already
accustomed to walking

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:34.729
through this experience.

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:37.812
And those users also convert
at much, much higher rates.

00:06:37.812 --> 00:06:39.520
So we see a lot of
success in this space.

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.270
And a good example of this
is our friends at CBS.

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:44.710
After integrating with the
Google Play subscriptions

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:47.610
platform, their sign-up
conversion went up enormously.

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:51.160
They saw far more users
entering on their platform

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.130
as a result of the reach and
as a result of the conversion.

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:56.733
There's a whole conversion
team in Google Play just making

00:06:56.733 --> 00:06:58.941
this purchase flow work
better and better and better.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.120
Another example is
Coffee Meets Bagel.

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:07.120
They started off using the
subscriptions business model.

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:10.450
And now 20% of their
revenue is on subscriptions.

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:12.276
So this is another
good example of success

00:07:12.276 --> 00:07:13.900
building a
subscriptions-based business

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:17.950
and using the Google Play
subscriptions platform.

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:20.885
Coming soon is a feature
that many, many of you

00:07:20.885 --> 00:07:21.760
have been asking for.

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:24.160
This is a good way to
drive down the friction

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:25.390
in that sign-up flow.

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:26.682
So we already have free trials.

00:07:26.682 --> 00:07:28.556
But a lot of the time,
what you actually want

00:07:28.556 --> 00:07:29.770
is a highly-qualified user.

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:31.478
So you don't want it
to be entirely free,

00:07:31.478 --> 00:07:35.740
but you do want a very low price
for that first few-- [? 1n ?]

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:36.610
subscription period.

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:40.077
So introductory pricing is very,
very, very close to launching.

00:07:40.077 --> 00:07:41.410
It's being tested at the moment.

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:43.870
And you'll be able to
use this to convert

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:46.330
more people into subscribers
at a lower price.

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:49.080
And then they'll automatically
revert to the full price

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:52.720
after as many
periods as you like.

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.490
So retention-- this
is a big, big deal.

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:57.609
Ultimately, you are providing
the value to the users.

00:07:57.609 --> 00:07:58.900
You're building the motivation.

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:00.910
The user wants to
subscribe in order

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:04.750
to retain access to your
service or to your content.

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:06.880
So you're building
that motivation.

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:08.890
Some of the time, however,
something goes wrong.

00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:12.730
The user's credit card expires
or the payment network is down,

00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:15.010
and we suffer what's
called involuntary churn.

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:15.929
This is bad.

00:08:15.929 --> 00:08:16.720
This is really bad.

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.490
We do not want this
to happen ever.

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:22.214
And so we have an entire team
focused on involuntary churn.

00:08:22.214 --> 00:08:23.380
We think about all of churn.

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:26.311
We want to partner with you
to prevent voluntary churn.

00:08:26.311 --> 00:08:28.060
But the thing that
these guys are thinking

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:29.770
about when I see
them in the morning

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:32.409
is involuntary churn and
fighting involuntary churn.

00:08:32.409 --> 00:08:34.750
There are two main things
that you can do in this space.

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:36.107
So the one is retries.

00:08:36.107 --> 00:08:37.690
And so we've got a
retries team that's

00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:40.820
figuring out the right
ways to retry the charges.

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:43.139
Now because we have so many
different forms of payment

00:08:43.139 --> 00:08:45.430
in so many different countries,
the regulations change,

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:46.630
the rules change.

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:50.035
And frankly, the interactions
with those forms of payment

00:08:50.035 --> 00:08:50.660
change as well.

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:53.620
So this team is figuring
out exactly the right time

00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:55.960
to retry a charge, when
to retry it, how often

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:58.780
to retry it to get
the highest recovery

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:00.586
rate possible through retries.

00:09:00.586 --> 00:09:01.960
And then the second
thing that we

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:04.090
do to fight involuntary
churn is we actually

00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:05.365
reach out to the users.

00:09:05.365 --> 00:09:07.240
Sometimes, a retry is
just not going to work.

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:08.904
That form of payment is broken.

00:09:08.904 --> 00:09:11.320
And so we need to reach out
to the user and tell the user,

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:12.310
listen, there's been a problem.

00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:13.643
We need you to take some action.

00:09:13.643 --> 00:09:15.490
And so very, very
recently, we actually

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:18.160
launched push notifications
from the Play Store

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.491
to users to tell them that
their subscription is broken

00:09:20.491 --> 00:09:22.240
and that they should
come and take action.

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:24.567
And again, we've
seen improvements.

00:09:24.567 --> 00:09:26.650
So I'm very excited about
the progress we've made.

00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:29.020
But frankly, this team keeps
on coming up with ideas.

00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:31.147
They keep on eking out
more and more recoveries.

00:09:31.147 --> 00:09:32.980
And so I think that
there's even more upside

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:34.146
in the future in this space.

00:09:34.146 --> 00:09:37.010
So we're going to
continue focusing on it.

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:39.319
Management-- ultimately,
we want to make it easy

00:09:39.319 --> 00:09:41.110
for you to run your
subscriptions business.

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:42.068
We want to build tools.

00:09:42.068 --> 00:09:43.570
We have a lot of
internal analytics

00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:45.789
on the subscriptions
products and businesses,

00:09:45.789 --> 00:09:47.330
and we want to start
surfacing those.

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:49.245
And so you should see
that coming very soon.

00:09:49.245 --> 00:09:50.620
And the developer
console will be

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:53.590
releasing additional
subscriptions-focused reporting

00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:56.050
and management tools.

00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:58.420
So that was a very
brief overview.

00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:00.310
As I say, I'm going
to be around all day.

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:02.770
We have an engineering lead
and other product managers

00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:04.600
on the subscriptions team today.

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:05.350
Look out for them.

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:07.150
I can introduce you to them.

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:09.340
We think about integration,
so we've got new APIs

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:10.614
coming out all the time.

00:10:10.614 --> 00:10:13.030
We want to make it much easier
to manage your subscription

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:13.810
SKUs.

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:15.490
And in particular,
we know that it's

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:17.770
difficult to manage the
pricing of these SKUs.

00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:20.860
So we're working very hard
on things like price changes

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:25.210
and on dynamic pricing
of subscription products.

00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:26.770
Sign-up is a big deal for us.

00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:29.372
Obviously, we've got the reach
team who just continually

00:10:29.372 --> 00:10:30.830
is working on new
forms of payment.

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:32.705
We've got some very
exciting forms of payment

00:10:32.705 --> 00:10:34.187
in Europe and in
India coming up.

00:10:34.187 --> 00:10:36.520
We've got the DCB team, the
Direct Carrier Billing team,

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:38.094
always working on this stuff.

00:10:38.094 --> 00:10:39.010
We've got free trials.

00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:40.510
We've got local pricing.

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:42.430
We've got very low
prices in some countries.

00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:45.500
And coming extremely soon,
we've got introductory pricing

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:46.000
launching.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.460
So I encourage you
to test that out.

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:50.445
On retention, we've got
that retention team.

00:10:50.445 --> 00:10:51.820
Honestly, these
guys are the guys

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:52.944
I go and see every morning.

00:10:52.944 --> 00:10:55.520
We've got to drive up the
retention rates for all of you.

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:59.920
Then subscriptions become the
gift that keeps on giving.

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:02.850
We have been testing
our promotion codes.

00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:04.600
So you'll be hearing
from your BD managers

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.940
about working with us on
subscription promotions.

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:08.320
We want to be able to do that.

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:10.580
We have been working
with intelligent retries.

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:12.430
There's some very
interesting work there.

00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:14.170
We've got grace
periods, which have

00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:16.750
been shown to make a huge
difference to retention,

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:19.390
mostly because it gives us
more time to do those retries.

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:23.501
We've seen huge improvements
when grace period is enabled.

00:11:23.501 --> 00:11:25.750
And as I said, we've just
launched push notifications,

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:26.708
the very first version.

00:11:26.708 --> 00:11:28.900
We're going to iterate
on this to drive the user

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:30.850
to fix more subscriptions.

00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:34.000
And then finally, we've got
teams working on the management

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.160
tools-- in particular,
those churn metrics.

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.204
As you can tell, I'm
pretty obsessed with churn.

00:11:38.204 --> 00:11:40.120
So we've got a lot of
reporting in that space,

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:42.328
and we're going to be
releasing that in the developer

00:11:42.328 --> 00:11:44.470
console coming soon as well.

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:46.230
Thank you.
