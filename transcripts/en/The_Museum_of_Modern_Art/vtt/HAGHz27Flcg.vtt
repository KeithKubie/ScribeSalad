00:00:02.836 --> 00:00:04.088
There was a man here,

00:00:04.546 --> 00:00:06.631
but he’s disappeared as you look.

00:00:07.175 --> 00:00:11.095
There was a dog here,
but he’s vanished, as you watch.

00:00:11.763 --> 00:00:13.138
There was a street here.

00:00:13.806 --> 00:00:14.723
It’s not here,

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.100
you keep looking.

00:00:16.976 --> 00:00:17.976
There was a notice–

00:00:18.853 --> 00:00:19.811
there’s one now–

00:00:20.355 --> 00:00:21.438
of bouncing away.

00:00:22.356 --> 00:00:23.566
There is information

00:00:24.108 --> 00:00:26.568
about the vanishing point
of a street.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.736
One.

00:00:29.655 --> 00:00:32.283
I had invited Vito and Maria

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.120
on the occasion
of MoMA PS1 turning forty.

00:00:35.411 --> 00:00:36.536
And I thought, who is an artist

00:00:36.746 --> 00:00:40.166
who really galvanizes
the artistic energy and innovation

00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:43.293
and groundbreaking nature
of going into the city

00:00:43.503 --> 00:00:45.505
and dealing very early on

00:00:45.671 --> 00:00:48.716
with new media
and new approaches.

00:00:49.008 --> 00:00:50.260
So who would that artist be,

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.220
who is like groundbreaking,
experimental and is challenging

00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:56.223
like this institution is
and still is forty years later?

00:00:57.225 --> 00:00:59.060
Vito, do you recognize the street?

00:00:59.935 --> 00:01:03.230
– I do, I mean but it’s different now.
– Yeah.

00:01:04.023 --> 00:01:05.733
Forty or fifty years later.

00:01:07.818 --> 00:01:09.278
I hope we’re going to open.

00:01:09.486 --> 00:01:14.825
And I hope we’re going to open
with a project all of us want to do.

00:01:15.118 --> 00:01:18.245
What can our crew
most effectively do today

00:01:18.411 --> 00:01:19.830
so we’re moving forward?

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:22.916
– Finishing this.
– Yeah. Great.

00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:26.086
Yeah, we’re still far away
from being finished, great.

00:01:26.253 --> 00:01:29.923
I still don’t understand
why some things were white on black

00:01:30.133 --> 00:01:31.383
and some things weren’t.

00:01:31.716 --> 00:01:33.636
From where we’re standing

00:01:35.263 --> 00:01:36.013
why?

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.015
Why wouldn’t somebody call you?

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.976
He was very hesitant to do the show,

00:01:41.143 --> 00:01:44.896
because Vito does not like
to go back to his past.

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.526
I was adamant that we had
to incorporate architecture, design

00:01:49.693 --> 00:01:52.530
to say, look,
this is what Vito is doing now.

00:01:52.905 --> 00:01:54.990
Everything is very calculated

00:01:55.158 --> 00:01:58.285
because Vito and I
are both very meticulous.

00:01:58.953 --> 00:02:01.163
I wanted to make
some kind of statement

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.041
that comes from me.
So “Where We Are Now,”

00:02:04.291 --> 00:02:08.838
whereas, “Where Are We Now,”
is too flimsy.

00:02:09.046 --> 00:02:13.133
We can trick it,
because then in the parentheses is

00:02:13.341 --> 00:02:14.676
“Who Are We Anyway?”

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.221
This whole text is thirty six pages.

00:02:17.513 --> 00:02:19.556
There’s no way
we’re going to fit thirty six pages.

00:02:19.765 --> 00:02:21.475
– Not at all.
– So I think we just fit,

00:02:22.226 --> 00:02:24.520
– what fits in that space basically.
– Exactly.

00:02:24.686 --> 00:02:29.525
It’s hard for me
not to say something else.

00:02:29.691 --> 00:02:31.401
I would like to get it done by Friday.

00:02:31.568 --> 00:02:33.070
Yeah, yeah. No, we need to
start writing tomorrow

00:02:33.236 --> 00:02:34.821
if we’ve got
any chance of getting it done.

00:02:34.988 --> 00:02:38.241
He’s very particular about
the spaces in between paragraphs

00:02:38.408 --> 00:02:42.163
and the width of some columns
being wider and some being thinner.

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.456
One, two, three, four, five.

00:02:44.623 --> 00:02:46.208
You think you’ll get it done in time?

00:02:46.375 --> 00:02:47.876
He’s going to come by Sunday.

00:02:48.085 --> 00:02:50.255
I guess we’ll see what
happens at that point.

00:02:50.421 --> 00:02:53.298
But we have until
one o’clock tonight.

00:02:54.133 --> 00:02:58.805
It is the day in as much as we...

00:02:58.971 --> 00:02:59.805
It’s a moment of truth

00:02:59.971 --> 00:03:02.183
and we will see
if the show actually opens.

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:03.768
We have worked
for three-and-a-half months

00:03:03.935 --> 00:03:04.893
in the exhibition space

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.271
and all of a sudden
we have constructed something.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.858
So architecture
has been realized and produced.

00:03:11.191 --> 00:03:16.238
I’m about to press
the send button on the invite.

00:03:16.948 --> 00:03:18.866
– Shall I really do that?
– Yes.

00:03:19.241 --> 00:03:21.201
– Good. Vito?
– Yes.

00:03:21.451 --> 00:03:23.328
I sent it to three-and-a-half
thousand people

00:03:23.495 --> 00:03:26.665
who are showing up here on Sunday.
We have to do that. Now it’s out.

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:28.125
– Is that really true?
– Yes.

00:03:28.291 --> 00:03:29.168
Three-and-a-half.

00:03:29.335 --> 00:03:30.586
We better have something.

00:03:31.711 --> 00:03:36.466
“Seedbed,” for me,
was such a historical piece.

00:03:36.675 --> 00:03:39.845
It really grounded you,
no pun intended,

00:03:40.011 --> 00:03:44.016
but it grounded you
as an artist in everybody’s eyes.

00:03:44.433 --> 00:03:45.851
You changed the art world.

00:03:46.018 --> 00:03:48.646
Maybe I made a mistake
in grounding myself with that.

00:03:49.063 --> 00:03:52.191
A big mistake
was everything came from one point.

00:03:52.816 --> 00:03:54.818
I really screwed up the piece.

00:03:54.985 --> 00:03:57.571
You screwed up the piece,
still you made art history.

00:03:58.656 --> 00:04:00.283
–Are you a perfectionist, Vito?

00:04:00.783 --> 00:04:03.201
I try to be, but I fail.

00:04:04.203 --> 00:04:07.081
I really felt like
I had nothing to do with art.

00:04:07.248 --> 00:04:08.373
Art to me was,

00:04:09.166 --> 00:04:10.000
kind of fakery.

00:04:10.626 --> 00:04:16.173
I despised calling what I did art.
I thought of them as activities.

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:20.845
I think many
of his early instruction pieces

00:04:21.011 --> 00:04:23.806
and early investigations

00:04:23.973 --> 00:04:27.976
are literally a premonition
and anticipation of social media.

00:04:28.435 --> 00:04:31.146
Of documenting
every single moment of your life.

00:04:31.313 --> 00:04:33.858
But then you see Vito
more than forty years earlier

00:04:34.108 --> 00:04:37.236
creating a selfie or a self portrait.

00:04:37.403 --> 00:04:40.990
I think Vito Acconci very often
is about seducing the camera

00:04:41.156 --> 00:04:44.618
and that is what Snapchat or
Instagram or YouTube very often are.

00:04:44.785 --> 00:04:46.996
From seeing Vito,
you kind of get the sense

00:04:47.163 --> 00:04:49.331
wait a second,
I can be alone in my bedroom

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.668
and film myself
doing whatever I want to do.

00:04:52.835 --> 00:04:53.543
You need me!

00:04:53.711 --> 00:04:55.796
I think Vito made it more comfortable

00:04:55.963 --> 00:04:58.966
and he made it
not a big deal in a sense.

00:04:59.425 --> 00:05:01.676
I only know
there’s got to be somebody.

00:05:02.803 --> 00:05:04.721
There’s got to be somebody
watching me,

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.725
somebody who wants
to come in close to me.

00:05:08.183 --> 00:05:11.436
I hope that people
will be able to experience Vito

00:05:11.686 --> 00:05:14.106
from the past and into the future.

00:05:14.273 --> 00:05:18.485
I think he is sort of...
I don’t want to say shell shocked,

00:05:18.651 --> 00:05:19.820
but maybe that’s the right word.

00:05:19.986 --> 00:05:25.368
He has sort of a PTSD
of 1968 to 1973.

00:05:25.576 --> 00:05:28.495
The people have kept him in a prison.

00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:31.540
He feels like he hasn’t
been able to expand

00:05:31.706 --> 00:05:33.625
into what he wants to be right now.

00:05:33.793 --> 00:05:37.838
I can’t imagine what it would be like
to always be associated with that

00:05:38.005 --> 00:05:41.258
when actually you’ve moved on
from that a little bit

00:05:41.425 --> 00:05:44.011
and you’re interested
in doing something else perhaps.

00:05:44.428 --> 00:05:46.638
So that’s why maybe
this has been quite an interesting

00:05:46.971 --> 00:05:50.350
or difficult process for him
because he is trying to somehow

00:05:50.518 --> 00:05:53.813
put that back into something
that is relevant maybe for him now.

00:05:54.563 --> 00:05:56.231
It always bothers me though that,

00:05:56.398 --> 00:06:02.071
I don’t think as many people
think of me as doing architecture.

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:06.491
And that kind of saddens me.

00:06:06.658 --> 00:06:10.120
I wonder with you Vito,
if you ever in the evenings sit down

00:06:10.286 --> 00:06:11.621
and are a little proud

00:06:11.788 --> 00:06:14.750
of all the amazing
achievements you’ve made.

00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:17.043
I’m always trying to do something new.

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:20.005
I always hoped that
I never do something

00:06:20.171 --> 00:06:24.468
that is a second attempt at a project
that I’ve already done.

00:06:24.635 --> 00:06:26.678
And I would think
if this doesn’t mean anything,

00:06:26.845 --> 00:06:27.888
I wouldn’t do it.

00:06:28.221 --> 00:06:30.181
I think you’re too hard on yourself.

00:06:31.391 --> 00:06:32.435
I don’t know.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.438
I’d rather be hard on myself.

00:06:37.648 --> 00:06:42.068
I have made my point.
I make it again.

00:06:42.486 --> 00:06:45.781
It.
Now you get the point.

00:06:46.198 --> 00:06:47.616
– It’s beautiful.
– Wow!

00:06:47.783 --> 00:06:50.326
– I think it’s really amazing.
– Oh my God.

00:06:52.036 --> 00:06:54.706
Yeah, it fills the walls.
It’s so nice.

00:06:54.873 --> 00:06:56.250
Thank you so much.

00:06:58.961 --> 00:07:00.546
– Are you happy?
– Yes.

00:07:01.255 --> 00:07:04.008
– I’m mighty proud.
– Really?

00:07:04.216 --> 00:07:06.343
Because it’s I,
who should be proud of you.

00:07:06.593 --> 00:07:09.888
I think if you look at the poetry
and you look at the reading,

00:07:10.221 --> 00:07:14.226
the focus is very much more
on not stopping than on detail.

00:07:14.393 --> 00:07:18.355
And by declaring
certain details to be worked out,

00:07:18.521 --> 00:07:20.398
it’s guaranteed
that the process goes on.

00:07:20.608 --> 00:07:21.816
I think that’s very important.

00:07:22.066 --> 00:07:25.028
The process for Vito
is like a Möbius strip.

00:07:25.195 --> 00:07:28.908
Something that’s continuous,
and that keeps on going.

00:07:29.075 --> 00:07:31.160
It’s never ending. That’s Vito.

00:07:31.868 --> 00:07:34.538
It’s almost like he wants
to make it better last time he did it.

00:07:35.121 --> 00:07:36.915
It didn’t exist before
in this sort of way,

00:07:37.081 --> 00:07:39.251
so I think he’s being
quite particular about it

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:42.128
and wanting to translate
what he did before.

00:07:42.713 --> 00:07:44.965
But when you’re making something,
it can change.

00:07:45.131 --> 00:07:46.383
When it’s finished and it’s made,

00:07:46.633 --> 00:07:48.301
then it is what it is.

00:07:48.593 --> 00:07:51.096
Something changing means it’s alive.

00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:53.975
I am here.

00:07:54.516 --> 00:07:55.518
Again.

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:56.810
Again.

00:07:57.228 --> 00:07:58.311
Again.

00:08:02.106 --> 00:08:04.235
Three days and three nights.

00:08:05.945 --> 00:08:08.488
And then we got,
until last night we got there.

00:08:08.865 --> 00:08:12.951
So it will take two more days
and that will take three more nights.

00:08:14.411 --> 00:08:15.621
It’s beautiful, right?

00:08:22.628 --> 00:08:25.505
I looked up at it,
and then it was down,

00:08:25.923 --> 00:08:27.131
when I looked there,

00:08:28.091 --> 00:08:29.176
every which way

00:08:29.926 --> 00:08:31.803
until I had asked, “What?”

00:08:33.055 --> 00:08:34.473
After it disappeared,

00:08:34.765 --> 00:08:35.725
it did.

00:08:37.476 --> 00:08:40.771
Vito, Maria, your show is incredible!

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:42.773
Aren’t you very happy?

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:46.943
He loves it.

00:08:47.903 --> 00:08:49.196
– Don’t you love it?
– Yes.

00:08:59.873 --> 00:09:02.751
It makes me feel hopeful
that the way the show ends

00:09:02.918 --> 00:09:05.045
with this diving board,
but doesn’t really.

00:09:05.461 --> 00:09:07.923
This is a diving off
point for the future.

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:12.386
That’s an interesting point
to learn about Vito –

00:09:12.761 --> 00:09:16.640
how much of Vito’s work
is a self-portrait.

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:21.520
I think the exhibition is a portrait
of Vito Acconci 1976,

00:09:21.686 --> 00:09:25.816
and it’s a portrait of Vito Acconci,
2016, forty years later.

00:09:25.983 --> 00:09:27.360
It’s a double portrait.

00:09:28.276 --> 00:09:30.320
I congratulate all three of you!

00:09:34.283 --> 00:09:37.286
– That monitor should be down.
– Yes, I saw that.

00:09:37.453 --> 00:09:40.246
You are right.
I saw that too, you are right.

00:09:41.581 --> 00:09:43.960
I appreciate
that a whole new audience

00:09:44.126 --> 00:09:45.501
is getting to know Vito.

00:09:45.711 --> 00:09:48.671
He is getting the attention
that he has always deserved.

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:51.841
Big toast to Vito and Maria.

00:10:00.768 --> 00:10:02.811
Do you have any positive feedback?

00:10:03.103 --> 00:10:05.731
Well it’s hard to tell now

00:10:06.065 --> 00:10:09.235
because they had to
really change things

00:10:09.526 --> 00:10:11.778
and the way
they wanted to change things

00:10:11.945 --> 00:10:15.365
was to have black print
on white paper.

00:10:15.783 --> 00:10:19.203
And I think
that was kind of a mistake.

00:10:19.453 --> 00:10:21.538
Was there anything
you liked about the show?

00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:23.665
The things I liked were...

00:10:24.375 --> 00:10:27.168
I think where we tried
to do some things too fast.

00:10:27.336 --> 00:10:29.505
And when you’re trying
to do something too fast,

00:10:29.671 --> 00:10:32.966
there’s always a kind of problem
and they just ran out of time.

00:10:33.133 --> 00:10:35.343
Right, so that’s something
you didn’t like.

00:10:35.803 --> 00:10:38.221
But what about,
is there anything that you did like?

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:42.685
Say one positive thing. Say it.

00:10:43.143 --> 00:10:45.353
– Well no... I mean...
– Shhhh

00:10:45.603 --> 00:10:47.898
– I already said that...
– No you didn’t.

00:10:48.065 --> 00:10:50.693
I kind of can’t because
I can’t see it.

00:10:52.318 --> 00:10:55.363
I am here as I go by.

00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:57.491
Again.

00:10:57.866 --> 00:10:59.035
Again.

00:10:59.368 --> 00:11:00.535
Again.

00:11:03.205 --> 00:11:04.706
He’s constantly growing.

00:11:04.873 --> 00:11:06.708
He’s constantly changing.

00:11:07.376 --> 00:11:09.670
Because nothing
is ever good enough for Vito.

00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:14.133
I don’t know
what I’m going to do next.

00:11:14.716 --> 00:11:19.346
Ideally I’d like to do a project
that goes on forever.
