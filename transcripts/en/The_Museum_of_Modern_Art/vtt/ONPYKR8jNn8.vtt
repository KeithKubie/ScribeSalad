00:00:06.283 --> 00:00:08.245
- Hi, I'm Lisa Mazzola,
and I'm an educator

00:00:08.245 --> 00:00:09.824
at the Museum of Modern Art.

00:00:09.824 --> 00:00:11.403
And we are here in MoMA's galleries

00:00:11.403 --> 00:00:13.676
where I spend lots of time
with students and teachers

00:00:13.676 --> 00:00:15.873
talking about works of
art in our collection.

00:00:15.873 --> 00:00:17.963
I'm here to share with
you my five top tips

00:00:17.963 --> 00:00:20.782
for engaging students with works of art.

00:00:21.697 --> 00:00:23.604
One of the biggest challenges
the teachers tell me

00:00:23.604 --> 00:00:25.096
they have with their students,

00:00:25.096 --> 00:00:26.460
is getting them to slow down

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.607
and really look at a work of art.

00:00:28.607 --> 00:00:30.001
The way that we focus students' attention

00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:33.067
here at MoMA is by asking
open-ended questions.

00:00:33.067 --> 00:00:34.902
What I mean by open-ended questions

00:00:34.902 --> 00:00:38.239
are questions that don't
require a yes or no answer.

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:40.625
So what else do you notice,
the overall size right?

00:00:40.625 --> 00:00:42.122
So now you're looking at this painting,

00:00:42.122 --> 00:00:43.951
the actual painting and it's much larger.

00:00:43.951 --> 00:00:45.060
Yeah, what else do you notice?

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.301
- That's so flat.

00:00:46.301 --> 00:00:47.874
- [Lisa] Yeah, can you
tell me more about that?

00:00:47.874 --> 00:00:49.629
What does that mean, it's so flat?

00:00:50.982 --> 00:00:53.072
These types of questions
get the students comfortable

00:00:53.072 --> 00:00:56.276
generating their own ideas
and making observations,

00:00:56.276 --> 00:00:58.468
and even interpretations
about what they see

00:00:58.468 --> 00:01:01.392
without needing any prior
knowledge about the work of art.

00:01:02.846 --> 00:01:04.843
So once you get a lively discussion going

00:01:04.843 --> 00:01:06.898
using open-ended questions, make sure to

00:01:06.898 --> 00:01:09.958
validate your students'
responses and keep them focused

00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:12.619
by restating their responses to the group.

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:14.317
It's really important to not give them

00:01:14.317 --> 00:01:16.499
all the information up front, but slowly

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:19.182
start to layer the information in.

00:01:19.182 --> 00:01:20.571
This will leave room for the students'

00:01:20.571 --> 00:01:23.578
interpretations and ideas
in the conversation.

00:01:23.578 --> 00:01:25.834
The original kind of seed of the idea was

00:01:25.834 --> 00:01:27.587
this depicting this community,

00:01:27.587 --> 00:01:29.190
this village, this place that he grew up.

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.242
But it's not exactly the
way that it was, right?

00:01:32.242 --> 00:01:36.249
So he added some of these sort
of unrealistic things to it.

00:01:37.699 --> 00:01:40.555
Not all students feel comfortable
talking in a large group.

00:01:40.555 --> 00:01:42.272
Some of them might feel uncomfortable

00:01:42.272 --> 00:01:44.019
sharing their thoughts or their ideas

00:01:44.019 --> 00:01:45.780
with their fellow students.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.637
To address the needs of those students,

00:01:47.637 --> 00:01:49.599
I like to develop activities that engage

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:53.232
other learning styles,
like writing or drawing,

00:01:53.232 --> 00:01:55.474
or even incorporate physical exercises

00:01:55.474 --> 00:01:57.667
like taking on the pose or the gesture

00:01:57.667 --> 00:01:59.969
of a particular figure in an artwork.

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.738
So someone asked the question about

00:02:02.738 --> 00:02:05.048
does it have to be real or
does it have to be imaginary?

00:02:05.048 --> 00:02:06.936
And it can be both, right?

00:02:06.936 --> 00:02:10.079
This is just about you
playing with line and shape.

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.725
When you engage students
in other types of learning

00:02:12.725 --> 00:02:15.116
in addition to dialogue,
you're now making room

00:02:15.116 --> 00:02:18.799
for responses you might not
get through conversation alone.

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.049
If you can get your
students thinking about

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:25.996
personal experiences that
relate to the work of art,

00:02:25.996 --> 00:02:28.026
that's a connection you're making.

00:02:28.026 --> 00:02:29.595
And the more connections you can make,

00:02:29.595 --> 00:02:31.515
the more engaged the students will be,

00:02:31.515 --> 00:02:33.946
and the more information they're
ultimately going to learn.

00:02:33.946 --> 00:02:36.493
It's this connection between
information and ideas

00:02:36.493 --> 00:02:38.255
that really activates the students,

00:02:38.255 --> 00:02:39.614
and oftentimes makes them want to

00:02:39.614 --> 00:02:41.747
explore works of art on their own.

00:02:43.113 --> 00:02:44.606
So you've asked questions, and you've

00:02:44.606 --> 00:02:46.568
layered in information,
and you're engaged in

00:02:46.568 --> 00:02:48.043
different types of activities,

00:02:48.043 --> 00:02:49.819
and you're making connections.

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:52.537
So my last tip for you is reflection.

00:02:52.537 --> 00:02:54.116
It's really important to take the time

00:02:54.116 --> 00:02:57.765
to reflect and synthesize what
the students have learned.

00:02:57.765 --> 00:02:59.747
There are a variety of ways to do this.

00:02:59.747 --> 00:03:01.938
You can simply ask them
an open-ended question

00:03:01.938 --> 00:03:04.651
about big ideas, or you
can ask them to consider

00:03:04.651 --> 00:03:05.850
what they learned about the work of art

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.718
that they didn't know before.

00:03:08.472 --> 00:03:09.731
You can also have them do some type

00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:12.039
of drawing or writing activity.

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:13.783
Whatever you do, it's really important

00:03:13.783 --> 00:03:17.579
to take the time to reflect
and synthesize their ideas.

00:03:18.006 --> 00:03:19.283
- [Voiceover] Amazed.

00:03:19.283 --> 00:03:19.923
- [Voiceover] I see a chair.

00:03:19.923 --> 00:03:21.038
- [Voiceover] It looks like traffic.

00:03:21.038 --> 00:03:24.965
(children murmuring)

00:03:24.965 --> 00:03:26.901
- [Voiceover] It looks
like a road with cars.

00:03:26.978 --> 00:03:29.798
- [Voiceover] It looks like
lights flashing on a screen.

00:03:29.798 --> 00:03:33.075
- [Voiceover] A road with cars
and those boxes are schools.

00:03:33.075 --> 00:03:34.967
- [Lisa] See how it's
got quiet for a second,

00:03:34.967 --> 00:03:38.353
and when we got quiet, your
eyes really got in there

00:03:38.353 --> 00:03:39.603
and then all of a sudden these things,

00:03:39.603 --> 00:03:41.777
it looks like traffic,

00:03:41.777 --> 00:03:44.183
it looks like a maze,
I see all the colors.

00:03:44.183 --> 00:03:46.411
It looks like a board game, right?

00:03:46.411 --> 00:03:48.639
Incorporating these five
tips into your teaching

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:50.505
will help you facilitate
deeper engagements

00:03:50.505 --> 00:03:53.111
with your students and works of art.
