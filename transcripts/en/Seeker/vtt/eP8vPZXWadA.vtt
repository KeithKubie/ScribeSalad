00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:03.040
DRUNKENESS IS ONLY A PLASTIC POUCH OF POWDER
AWAY!

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.040
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.559
THE FUTURE IS HERE EVERYBODY.

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:12.980
Hey everyone, Laci Green here for DNews!

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.840
Back in my day, if we wanted to get drunk
we had to carry a bottle of booze through

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.670
the snow, uphill...BOTH WAYS.

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:20.820
But now, kids have "Palcohol".

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.240
It's a new and improved way to get drunk that
could hit the shelves later this year.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.920
Scientists behind the product have turned
liquid alcohol into a powder that you can

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.070
mix with water to make your drink.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.610
Their website reports that they have 6 varieties:
rum, vodka, and 4 types of cocktails.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.550
Last week, the news spread that Palcohol received
its federal approval, causing a mad frenzy....as

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:42.550
you might imagine.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.000
Then a few days later the feds were like OWAIT
JK.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.160
That was a mistake.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.300
Palcohol's parent company said the mistake
was related to how much powder comes in the

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.309
bag and that they're going to resubmit them
for approval.

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.030
It's worth noting that other countries like
Japan, The Netherlands (of course), and Germany

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.130
already have similar products on the market.

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.600
But how exactly is liquid alcohol turned into
a powder?

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:08.160
An old patent from the 1970s lets the public
in on Palcohol's boozy little secrets.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.990
First, they dehydrate a vapor-sorbable carbohydrate
base down to a moisture content of less than

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.990
1%.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.530
Ideally, this carbohydrate powder is one that
is easily dissolved in water and perhaps has

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:19.780
a little bit of sweetness.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.000
Once it's been dehydrated to the extreme,
the carbohydrate powder is ready to absorb

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.170
the ethanol.

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.750
Combine in the proper proportions and VOILA!

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.119
You have alcohol in powder form.

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.470
In order to stay fresh, the powder has to
stay in a sealed container, otherwise the

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.700
ethanol vapors will seep out.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.310
Palcohol says that their powders are 58% alcohol
by weight -- which is why it's also highly

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:41.310
flammable.

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.850
When you mix it with water, the percentage
is reduced to 12%.

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.600
And, FYI, each pouch contains about 80 calories.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.910
Is powdered alcohol the great idea we've all
been hoping for?

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.960
Well, it depends who you ask.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.140
I think for most people, regular liquid booze
is probably fine...but it is a solution for

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.520
people who want to take it on the go without
carrying heavy bottles.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.140
Think hikers, backpackers, and people who
want to slip it in their drink at lunch.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.069
And speaking of slipping things in drinks:
that's one of my concerns with a powdered

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:11.349
alcohol - it's actually a little easier to
abuse.

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:17.270
In fact, the original Palcohol website MIGHT
be described as WILDLY irresponsible, and

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.120
COMPLETELY out of control.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.040
Originally, they openly highlighting the fact
that you can sneak it into concerts or that

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.900
-- even though you shouldn't because that's
dangerous kids! -- it CAN be snorted.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.400
And that it'll get you drunk superfast.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.400
Wink wink.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.109
Since the news broke via public records of
the approval, Palcohol added a shiny and professional

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:36.299
new face to their website.

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:37.299
Smart move there.

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:40.459
So folks, is this something you might try
if it regains its approval?

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.690
