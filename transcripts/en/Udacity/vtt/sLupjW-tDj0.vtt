00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Let's plug in a β of 0, so when not moving, the two frames we're discussing aren't moving at all,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
the train is at rest, well we've have 1/√1-0, which is 1/1.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
It turns out that that's the lowest possible value that gamma can ever take, so that's gamma min.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
For gamma max, as we get closer and closer to 1, as β gets closer and closer to 1,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
well 1 minus that number squared does get smaller and smaller,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and as we divide by a smaller and smaller number, we get bigger and bigger,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and it turns out that the maximum value is as high as we would like.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And so actually if we want to plot this value gamma versus β, well we defined that for a very long time

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
gamma is very close to 1, but then it quickly rises and gets bigger and bigger and bigger

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
as β approaches 1 or as we approach the speed of light.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
What is that mean? It means that this number gets bigger.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
It means that the time measured on the stationary observer's clock

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
gets longer and longer when compared to the moving observer.

00:00:59.000 --> 99:59:59.000
This is why we call it time dilation. Let's look at an example to see if we can make some sense in this.
