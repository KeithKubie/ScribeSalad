00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.469
Congratulations to solving the first challenge. That's really, really great. Now

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:06.430
it's going to get a little bit more difficult. This time

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:08.960
we're going to introduce noise in your measurements, which means you

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.830
can't really see the X Y coordinates exactly anymore. You see

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.200
them approximately. Now this is a challenging problem, and the reason

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.090
is, everything in class that we've talked about so far was

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.360
linear, but here the motion model is non linear. So when

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.400
you apply a thing like a common filter or a particle

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.700
filter, you will be in for a surprise. So give it a try. It

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.910
might take longer than you think, but I hope you can solve this challenge.
