00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:07.250
Give me a head with hair, long beautiful hair,
shining gleaming steaming flaxen waxen.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:09.559
HAIR!

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:18.380
It's Monday, so we're answering viewer questions
today, and on our Why Do We Have Warts video,

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.340
Saihan, Elyse, and TheGamingWookiee all had
questions about hair!

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.350
Different types, why do some have more than
others, and why do we even need it!

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:29.740
Firstly, hair is a natural part of being human.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.129
We tend to associate it with our head, face,
armpits, pubic regions, and legs; but it's

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:36.030
actually everywhere.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.629
We like to think of ourselves as a naked ape,
but we have the same number of hairs on our

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:44.940
body as a chimpanzee; or around five million
hairs.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.649
Before you ask, hair and fur are the same
thing.

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:51.730
You and your fuzzy dog or cat all have hair
made of the same stuff: keratin.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.390
Your skin is made of layers -- the epidermis,
then the dermis underneath.

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.879
In the dermis, cells are constantly dividing,
and the older cells are pushed out of follicles

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.969
creating hair all the time.

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:05.900
On chimpanzees, hair protects skin from the
sun, and provides warmth.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:11.910
When you take into account thermoregulation,
hair was a way to keep that body warmth in

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:13.250
naturally!

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.330
Though, in modern humans it still protects
our head from the sun's rays, and allows sweat

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.250
to travel along hair shafts and evaporate,
cooling us down, but it doesn't keep our bodies

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.250
warm anymore.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.950
There are many different TYPES of hair.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.790
Fetuses in the womb grow hair called lanugo;
though it usually recedes from the body before

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.110
birth, it doesn’t always.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.930
A comforting reminder of our primate history,
perhaps?

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:44.240
After birth, we humans grow soft, fine, unpigmented
vellus hair all over our bodies, though thicker,

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.280
pigmented hair on the head, eyebrows, eyelashes,
and so on, is called terminal hair.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.050
During puberty, some of vellus hair transitions
to terminal hair or androgen hair -- named

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:55.870
for the sex hormones that cause them.

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:00.140
On the face, and chest for men and in the
armpits and pubic regions for both men and

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.320
women.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.940
What hair you get depends a lot on your genes.

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:11.220
A 2009 Cambridge study found the genes for
hair were 85 to 95 percent inherited, though

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.530
some can be affected by the environment.

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.140
Hair curls for two reasons.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.350
First, an asymmetrical, or oval-shaped, follicle
will force a curvy hair to emerge; circular

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.660
follicles produce straight hair; but a specific
cellular receptor called epidermal growth

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.920
factor receptor regulates the growth of hair.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.290
If the EGFR puts too much keratin on one side
of the hair shaft as it grows, it will come

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.380
out curly!

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.900
Hair is a holdover from our ancient ancestors.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.611
As we evolved, our genes mutated, and hair
thinned on some parts of the body, but the

00:02:42.611 --> 00:02:47.180
why in some places and not others is an evolutionary
mystery!

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.710
Perhaps hair lessened for social interaction,
to better see the eyes and face; or as we

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:56.890
became more upright and mobile evolution favored
those with just enough to reduce skin-on-skin

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.270
friction in pubic regions and armpits; or
perhaps ancient humans spent more time in

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:05.480
the water, and hair wasn't as useful there
except on the exposed parts of the head.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.770
Perhaps, hair remains in the pubic regions
similar to eye, head, nose, and ear hair -- to

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:16.250
block dirt and other deuterium from the genitalia
or to keep UV rays away from the sex organs?

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.900
Or maybe it allows pheromones to spread from
the body for mating!

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.700
The Economist writes that perhaps mature women
are more visibly hairless, on average, than

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.110
men because, at some point, hairlessness was
selected by men as a sexually attractive trait;

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:32.080
a similar theory as to why human males have
the largest average penis size of all primates.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.220
Again, we don't exactly know.

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.430
What we DO know, is maintaining SOME, but
not ALL body hair, may be due to parasite

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:41.430
detection.

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.180
A study from England's University of Sheffield
found people with more body hair could detect

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.700
bed bugs more quickly than those with less.

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.290
Though by tracing the evolution of lice alongside
humans, scientists determined we started trying

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.470
clothing on more than 170,000 years ago.

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.709
This was great for the cooler temperatures
of the coming ice age; and when we started

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.900
to move from Africa into Europe.

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:23.430
More clothing, like thicker hair, means 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:32.910
more parasites… which is bad…

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:38.689
damn, this is a hairy topic.
