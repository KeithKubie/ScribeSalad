00:00:03.046 --> 00:00:05.916
&gt;&gt;James: Digital media,
video games in particular,

00:00:05.916 --> 00:00:07.996
work just like we know books work.

00:00:07.996 --> 00:00:10.746
You know, it's all the
stuff that you know

00:00:10.746 --> 00:00:21.086
about literacy is true
of digital media.

00:00:21.086 --> 00:00:23.686
&gt;&gt;One thing that a lotta people who
are not into games are not aware

00:00:23.686 --> 00:00:27.936
of is that today, in the way
that people game socially is,

00:00:28.026 --> 00:00:32.586
the game is not the only
thing at stake, right?

00:00:32.636 --> 00:00:36.616
And if you're gonna contemplate
the possible use of games

00:00:36.616 --> 00:00:40.106
or digital media for learning about
learning, you really have to say,

00:00:40.106 --> 00:00:42.426
"Wait a minute, don't
just look at the game.

00:00:43.226 --> 00:00:44.536
There's more going on."

00:00:44.536 --> 00:00:45.826
Now, so I'm gonna show
you what it is.

00:00:46.006 --> 00:00:49.156
&gt;&gt;All right, this is World of
Warcraft, 15 million people.

00:00:49.416 --> 00:00:52.436
This is the most played
multiplayer game now in the world.

00:00:52.846 --> 00:00:55.466
It's a role playing game that
has some interesting properties.

00:00:55.796 --> 00:00:58.866
Role playing means you have to
play this with other people.

00:00:58.866 --> 00:01:01.116
You don't have to, but you do
play this with other people.

00:01:01.226 --> 00:01:03.246
The basic unit is five people.

00:01:03.636 --> 00:01:08.806
Now in each of the five people, each
one has to have a deep skill set,

00:01:08.806 --> 00:01:11.236
which they've chosen to
specialize in those skills,

00:01:11.626 --> 00:01:13.446
and it has to be different
than the other four.

00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:17.166
So you cannot bring in to the
so called dungeons, that is,

00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:19.066
where you're going to go play
and do challenges and fight--

00:01:19.346 --> 00:01:21.596
you can't bring in five people
with the same skill set.

00:01:21.816 --> 00:01:24.006
The problems are designed
that they're hard,

00:01:24.266 --> 00:01:28.106
and they can only be solved if you
integrate five different skill sets.

00:01:28.926 --> 00:01:30.586
See, so I was a priest, a healer.

00:01:30.586 --> 00:01:32.666
You bring in five priests
to a dungeon

00:01:33.406 --> 00:01:37.916
and you die in two seconds, right?

00:01:37.956 --> 00:01:42.526
So the idea, first of all, is
each person must be deeply skilled

00:01:42.716 --> 00:01:46.156
in one skill set, but has to
understand the big picture,

00:01:46.326 --> 00:01:48.486
so they can integrate their skill set

00:01:48.486 --> 00:01:51.166
with the very different skill
sets of the other people.

00:01:52.286 --> 00:01:53.486
Now why is this interesting?

00:01:53.486 --> 00:01:55.526
Because in the world
of high tech work,

00:01:55.606 --> 00:01:57.346
this is called a cross
functional team.

00:01:57.816 --> 00:02:01.166
If you go look at the new
capitalism and high tech workplaces,

00:02:01.166 --> 00:02:05.136
they're almost all organized
in cross functional teams,

00:02:05.136 --> 00:02:08.786
which means every member of the
team has to be an absolute expert,

00:02:09.136 --> 00:02:12.696
but able to understand everybody
else's role so they can integrate

00:02:12.696 --> 00:02:14.606
with it, and even replace
them if they're gone.

00:02:15.066 --> 00:02:17.946
Now in work, this is
considered extremely high stress.

00:02:19.456 --> 00:02:21.586
Then you go home to play World
of Warcraft to do it again.

00:02:22.606 --> 00:02:25.996
&gt;&gt;Portal is a game where
you use a portal gun

00:02:25.996 --> 00:02:28.236
to make an orange or blue portal.

00:02:28.586 --> 00:02:30.616
And if you go in one,
you come out the other,

00:02:30.616 --> 00:02:33.176
and they obey a whole bunch
of the laws of physics,

00:02:33.176 --> 00:02:35.666
for this world, its
own physical laws.

00:02:35.826 --> 00:02:38.716
&gt;&gt;So this is a game that
is essentially playing

00:02:38.716 --> 00:02:42.026
with a certain physics,
and it's very interesting,

00:02:42.026 --> 00:02:44.606
problem solving, and
it's a lot of fun.

00:02:44.606 --> 00:02:49.306
&gt;&gt;And people could say, "Well, surely
this is good for tacit understanding,

00:02:49.306 --> 00:02:50.636
kind of an embodied understanding,"

00:02:50.636 --> 00:02:53.466
but it doesn't mean you
can say any physics, right?

00:02:54.406 --> 00:02:55.886
And you know, as educators,
say, "Well,

00:02:55.886 --> 00:02:58.836
you can't articulate your
physics, so what good is it?"

00:02:59.156 --> 00:03:00.926
What those people are missing is

00:03:00.926 --> 00:03:04.996
that games today are only half
the picture, because what happens

00:03:04.996 --> 00:03:07.726
in any game that people
get passionate

00:03:07.726 --> 00:03:11.356
about is they play the game and
then they get interested in going

00:03:11.616 --> 00:03:15.856
on an internet site, which I
will call an affinity space,

00:03:16.026 --> 00:03:20.946
I'll tell you why, and discussing
that game, modifying the game,

00:03:21.136 --> 00:03:25.506
researching it, and explicating
everything about it, right?

00:03:25.506 --> 00:03:28.956
&gt;&gt;And so, you get stuff,
the first portal, like this.

00:03:29.246 --> 00:03:32.526
This is a group of people who play
Portal who decided to make a Wiki

00:03:32.526 --> 00:03:34.086
to explicate all the physics in it.

00:03:34.536 --> 00:03:38.126
There are links, like in momentum,
to actual physical definitions

00:03:38.126 --> 00:03:40.056
and physics textbooks
and physics articles.

00:03:40.336 --> 00:03:46.466
&gt;&gt;So now you see, whoa, far
from there being no articulation

00:03:46.466 --> 00:03:49.376
and language of the knowledge
being developed in the game,

00:03:49.606 --> 00:03:52.156
there's a whole community
devoted to doing just that.

00:03:52.836 --> 00:03:56.216
&gt;&gt;These games give rise to these
people that get on the internet

00:03:56.216 --> 00:04:00.006
and begin to use quite
technical, specialist language,

00:04:00.206 --> 00:04:01.316
like you just saw, right?

00:04:01.676 --> 00:04:03.896
&gt;&gt;That is not vernacular
English, right?

00:04:03.896 --> 00:04:05.876
You wouldn't talk that
way at the dinner table.

00:04:06.116 --> 00:04:08.126
It's what people call
academic language,

00:04:08.126 --> 00:04:09.666
or what I will call
specialist language.

00:04:09.666 --> 00:04:14.036
Now this is the only piece of true
gobbledygook I have in this talk

00:04:14.626 --> 00:04:17.526
and it's sad, but this is
the way psychologists write.

00:04:17.526 --> 00:04:19.006
It's why they don't have friends.

00:04:19.586 --> 00:04:23.516
But yet the point is
just really crucial.

00:04:24.196 --> 00:04:28.006
This is from a body of research
that's now about twenty years old

00:04:28.006 --> 00:04:32.336
that shows that when human
beings understand anything,

00:04:32.336 --> 00:04:36.376
whether it's a text or the
world, they understand it not

00:04:36.506 --> 00:04:41.246
by abstract generalities, but
by literally being able to run

00:04:41.246 --> 00:04:45.876
in their head a simulation
of images and actions

00:04:45.966 --> 00:04:48.406
and experiences that
the words refer to.

00:04:49.336 --> 00:04:52.326
And it turns out, and every
teacher here is gonna say,

00:04:52.326 --> 00:04:56.246
"I could have told you that," when
a human being is doing that is

00:04:56.246 --> 00:04:59.926
when they are thinking, because they
have to get ready to take an action

00:05:00.416 --> 00:05:02.216
that they want to take,
and they want that action

00:05:02.216 --> 00:05:04.646
to succeed, they think really well.

00:05:05.316 --> 00:05:07.236
But when you ask them
to think about stuff,

00:05:07.736 --> 00:05:09.356
but there's no action
they're gonna take,

00:05:10.256 --> 00:05:13.576
and they don't really care what the
outcome is, they think very poorly.

00:05:14.516 --> 00:05:18.566
&gt;&gt;You see, in American law, there's
a very interesting legal principle

00:05:18.566 --> 00:05:21.126
that is completely wrong,
called opportunity to learn.

00:05:21.526 --> 00:05:24.526
Courts have ruled, two kids had
the same opportunity to learn

00:05:24.976 --> 00:05:26.116
if they got the same book.

00:05:27.296 --> 00:05:32.286
But in fact, I'm saying that if
one kid has ten thousand hours

00:05:32.286 --> 00:05:36.806
of experience with the stuff the
book's about, like ten thousand hours

00:05:36.806 --> 00:05:39.376
of playing Portal-- that's
what the language is about--

00:05:39.836 --> 00:05:42.616
that kid has a much better
opportunity to learn than the kid

00:05:42.616 --> 00:05:45.736
that has fourteen minutes
or seconds, right?

00:05:46.006 --> 00:05:47.886
That opportunity to
learn is not the book.

00:05:48.226 --> 00:05:50.846
It's whether you can bring
experience to the book.

00:05:51.756 --> 00:05:54.366
&gt;&gt;When I first started to play
video games, I was brand new,

00:05:54.366 --> 00:05:58.126
I was in my fifties and I was
shocked at how hard they were.

00:05:58.706 --> 00:06:02.316
And like any good baby boomer, I
said, "Okay, I can handle this.

00:06:02.316 --> 00:06:04.806
I'll read the manual
first," and I sat

00:06:04.806 --> 00:06:06.226
down to read this little
twenty page book.

00:06:06.226 --> 00:06:09.346
And the twenty page
book had one hundred

00:06:09.346 --> 00:06:13.966
and ninety-nine bolded headings, each
cross referenced to the other hundred

00:06:13.966 --> 00:06:16.446
and ninety-eight that were
technical definitions.

00:06:16.946 --> 00:06:18.386
But I did what every kid would do,

00:06:18.556 --> 00:06:20.816
I went and played the
game for hours, terribly.

00:06:21.496 --> 00:06:23.566
And then the weirdest
thing happened to me.

00:06:23.566 --> 00:06:27.206
I picked this book up right there
and I could no longer recover why

00:06:27.206 --> 00:06:28.216
that wasn't crystal clear.

00:06:28.786 --> 00:06:33.406
I couldn't even recover it anymore,
because I have seen in the game,

00:06:34.156 --> 00:06:40.466
an image, an action, an experience, a
goal, a dialog, that fit those words.

00:06:40.746 --> 00:06:46.056
See, these words are about a
world, and if you haven't lived

00:06:46.056 --> 00:06:50.636
in that world, and you can't see it
in your mind, these are just words.

00:06:51.726 --> 00:06:54.996
You can look them up in a dictionary,
which is completely useless.

00:06:55.356 --> 00:06:58.726
&gt;&gt;And it struck me at that day that
the key problem of our schools,

00:06:58.726 --> 00:07:00.406
more now with No Child Left Behind,

00:07:00.406 --> 00:07:03.186
is it's full of manuals
without the games.

00:07:03.186 --> 00:07:06.746
We have handed kids all the
manuals without the games.

00:07:06.776 --> 00:07:10.226
And imagine, now if you did that
to gamers, there'd be a revolution.

00:07:11.466 --> 00:07:14.116
&gt;&gt;There isn't any such thing
as technical, hard language.

00:07:14.826 --> 00:07:17.806
There's only language you don't know
because you didn't live in its world,

00:07:17.806 --> 00:07:18.626
you didn't play its game.

00:07:19.366 --> 00:07:24.746
Therefore, in theory, we could level
the playing field for the first time

00:07:24.746 --> 00:07:28.796
in American education if we
brought the games to the manuals,

00:07:29.336 --> 00:07:30.466
and I don't mean a video game.

00:07:30.636 --> 00:07:33.686
If we brought the activities,
the problem solving,

00:07:34.236 --> 00:07:36.936
the living in the worlds
of chemistry and algebra,

00:07:37.126 --> 00:07:40.146
with making kids want
to do things with them.

00:07:40.826 --> 00:07:42.706
That is, to see them as tools,

00:07:42.706 --> 00:07:45.426
to surmise new possibilities,
that's the game.

00:07:46.006 --> 00:07:49.976
And if we brought those to school,
they'd like it as well as Portal.
