RACHEL: Identify limiting
patterns, beliefs, and habits.

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:11.620
Communicate more authentically
and powerfully.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.570
And then, ignite purpose and
vision in anything you do,

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.079
including work.

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:18.570
So please join me in welcoming
Steve Sisgold.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.030
Thank you.

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:20.720
STEVE SISGOLD: Thank you.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.930
Thank

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.850
you, Rachel [APPLAUSE]

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.340
STEVE SISGOLD: I thought I
would start today off by

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.150
letting you know a little bit
about what we're going to do.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.980
First of all-- everybody
can hear me?

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:32.470
It's all good?

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.810
OK, first of all, we're going to
do some self-reflection to

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:41.860
take a look at our own
awareness, our own--

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.890
just things that we're not
aware of sometimes.

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.810
We can be driving to work like
this, holding our wheel, and

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.980
have no idea because we're
thinking about what happened

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.180
at the breakfast table.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.310
We're thinking about what's
going to happen later.

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:54.350
And then, we get to work.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:55.755
And we say, ah, my shoulders
are tight.

00:00:55.755 --> 00:00:57.170
And we have no idea.

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:58.740
I constantly am--

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.870
I also write quite a bit, as
Rachel said-- my book.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.690
And sometimes, I'll be slumping
over my computer.

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.650
And I have no idea
I'm doing it.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.610
And my sweetie will walk
by and say, you're in

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.060
slump-asanas, if
you know yoga.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.030
And I'll go, oh, god, I didn't
even realize it.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.040
So there's a lot of
self-awareness that's going to

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.090
help us have more energy
and feel better

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.470
throughout the day.

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.950
We're also going to look into
things like, what are some

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.730
beliefs that I might be carrying
in my body that could

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.100
impact performance,
my relationships?

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.350
And we're going to be looking at
just the whole idea of how

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.280
I communicate, what
my billboard--

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.100
I call your body your
billboard--

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.000
is perhaps communicating,
micro-messages.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.730
We'll do a self-assessment.

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:40.960
And I'll teach you my rebuilding
technique.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.420
And then, we'll have some
fun-- interactive.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.720
So since my book is called
"What's Your Body Telling

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.830
You?," I thought I'd tell you
why I came up with that title

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.440
and how that came about.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.580
First, it started with
the fact that I was

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:53.770
working with people.

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:54.560
I was in sales.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.285
And I did really
well in sales.

00:01:56.285 --> 00:01:59.340
I was the number 1 out
of 500 salespeople.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.410
And that was exciting.

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.240
And at the same time,
I noticed something.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.110
I noticed-- this is going
to sound strange.

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.580
But I noticed people weren't
breathing, literally.

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.250
I'd say, wow, that person's
making a presentation.

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:10.180
[GASP]

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:11.330
STEVE SISGOLD: They're holding
their breath the whole time.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.770
So I became curious about that,
why we hold our breath,

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.770
why we're not breathing.

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.770
And then, secondly, I noticed,
especially when I was coaching

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.810
and training, that people would
say one thing, and their

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.830
body would be saying
something else.

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.840
That incongruence was giving
an incongruent message.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.500
And I noticed that for
myself and others.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.050
When what I said and my body
said the same thing, I got a

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.140
better response.

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.420
Anybody relate to that?

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.795
Because you're talking
to somebody, and they

00:02:40.795 --> 00:02:41.750
say, how you doing?

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:42.550
Oh, I'm doing great.

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.920
Oh, OK, doesn't look like it.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.660
So we do that all day long.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.570
It's amazing how many
micro-messages

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.320
we're sending out daily.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.110
So I just became really
curious about it.

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.430
And I started studying somatic
intelligence, which is

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.970
basically "soma" is Greek
for the body.

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.440
I started learning about, what
does that really mean?

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.760
And then, I got into more
depth of beliefs.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.910
And I'll go into that today.

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.660
I wanted to share a short story
with you where I believe

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.870
it started, where I started
listening to my body more and

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:14.850
listening to those instincts.

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.830
First of all, do you ever have
a gut instinct, but you

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.410
don't follow it?

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:21.880
It happens, right?

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.740
Do you ever have an instinct
like you want to say

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.300
something, but you, for some
reason or another [GASPS]

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:27.575
you hold it back?

00:03:27.575 --> 00:03:29.600
Yeah, that's what we do.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.160
And there's a lot of
reasons for that.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.740
And I'll cover those today.

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.910
But for me, it really started
when I was a young boy sitting

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.350
at my daily dinner table.

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.810
And my father came
home one night.

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.520
And when he came home, usually,
he would come home

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.470
kind of like this.

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.262
If you watch animals-- if you
watch a bird when they're

00:03:50.262 --> 00:03:52.110
happy, they're like this.

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.960
If you watch a bird after an oil
spill, they're like this.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.270
It's a very distinct
message, right?

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.350
There's even been studies
with blind people that

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:00.190
when they're excited--

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.970
yeah!

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.160
They jump up, just like
a football player

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.180
or any one of us.

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.140
It's an instinct to be open.

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.230
But often, we'll
be contracted.

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.000
And we'll go inward.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.795
So my dad often came home
from work like this.

00:04:12.795 --> 00:04:15.655
But one day, he came
home like this.

00:04:15.655 --> 00:04:17.610
And I was like, wow,
what's going on?

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:19.260
What's going on with Dad?

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.339
So I said, Dad, what's up?

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:23.200
And he said something I had
never heard before.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.647
And I don't know if you
have ever heard

00:04:24.647 --> 00:04:25.540
this from your parents.

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:26.840
My dad said, I have a dream.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.370
I'm like, whoa.

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.740
Have you ever--

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.990
I never heard my parents
say, I have a dream.

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.130
My dad, said, hey,
I have a dream.

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:34.320
I was like, wow,
that's amazing.

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.860
So he started to tell us his
dream at the dinner table.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.590
He was up.

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.617
I always look at that energy,
that ascending--

00:04:42.617 --> 00:04:44.200
I'm going to write a book!

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.790
Oh, there's no need
for another book.

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:47.530
And then, we drop down.

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:48.630
I watched that.

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.720
My dad said, I have a dream.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.030
I saw a little food market.

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:53.630
I'm tired of working
as a manager.

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:55.660
I want to buy my own store.

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:56.710
And then, he looked
to the right.

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.370
And there was my mom.

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.570
And my mom was like,
I don't think so.

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:01.980
We've got two kids growing up.

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:03.660
We need a check.

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.980
And my dad went like
this to this.

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:06.800
And I watched it.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.730
He was totally self-defeated.

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:12.170
How many times have you had an
idea, and you went and told

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:15.230
one person, and they didn't like
it, and you just dropped

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:16.160
down and forgot about it?

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.780
Is there anybody who
can relate to that?

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:20.160
Absolutely.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.260
I don't know what happened.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.100
But I watched my dad's
dream go away.

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.540
Here I am.

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:26.090
I was like eight years
old, if that.

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:28.860
And I felt something in my body,
which I kept trying to

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:33.330
push down because I didn't want
to have my mom upset.

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.710
And I'm just a little kid.

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.640
But something happened
that kind of

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:39.940
surged through my body.

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:41.880
And I couldn't hold it back.

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.940
And I just wound up screaming at
the dinner table, why can't

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:46.902
Daddy have his dream?

00:05:46.902 --> 00:05:48.210
And I looked at my mom.

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:51.820
And she was-- my sister looked
at me like, man, you're crazy.

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:54.640
And I saw my dad go back
up a little bit.

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.010
And my mom said, well,
jeesh, I guess we

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:58.680
could go look at it.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:59.780
So they went next-door.

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:01.270
And they looked at this
little food market.

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:02.660
And they bought it.

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.330
And three days later--

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:05.210
no kidding--

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:07.270
there was a Maryland
food strike.

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:10.980
Every Giant, Safeway,
A&amp;P closed.

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:13.440
And we had lines, and
lines, and lines

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:14.650
around my dad's store.

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:16.010
Of course, my dad did it.

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:16.810
It was his dream.

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:19.130
And he executed the business.

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:22.260
But it always reminded me, like,
what might have happened

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.570
if I didn't follow what
I felt in my body?

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:28.450
What didn't happen-- what
would've happened if I didn't

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:29.840
let that instinct out?

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:30.760
And you have my book.

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.550
So you'll read lots of stories
in there around people,

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:36.520
including myself, I've worked
with where when we followed

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.680
that instinct, when we listened
to our gut, when we

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.210
listened to our whole body,
not just our mind,

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:42.680
the result we got.

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:43.690
So just take a moment.

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:46.330
I call it the "loop of
awareness." Already, from what

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:50.200
I've said, just think in terms
of, huh, how often do I keep

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.470
my instincts in?

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:53.950
How often does my body say,
don't do that, but I do it

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:55.740
anyway to please people?

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:58.810
How often do I feel something,
but I'm not really

00:06:58.810 --> 00:06:59.750
listening to it?

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:02.880
And in my work, I have
found that--

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.170
I know this is going to
sound funny to you.

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:06.240
But I tell people, when I go out
and talk, I say, it's your

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:07.290
personal Google.

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:08.330
I use that.

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:10.020
I say, your body's like
your personal Google.

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:11.830
You can get information.

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:13.620
It's the library
of your flesh.

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:15.420
Your body was there
from day one.

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:18.270
Your body will explain to you,
if you take the time and

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:20.900
listen, oh, that's why I'm
afraid to say that.

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:23.360
That's why I cringe up when
I hear something.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.660
And we'll be doing exercises
around that today.

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:29.270
So you'll have an experience
with it, OK?

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:31.310
So the first thing, we've got
a PowerPoint back here.

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:32.180
I'm going to walk to it.

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:36.500
And if you can't see, let me
know, because of the light.

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:39.040
But basically, what I went
through is that we're going to

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.210
stay present, engage.

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:42.890
We're going to learn how to
lower our stress, improve our

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:46.300
skills, and change nonproductive
beliefs.

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:49.800
And I just wanted to show you,
just because sometimes it's

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:53.270
important to people, I had this
rebooting technique I'm

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:54.580
going to teach you today.

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:57.560
I took it into a medical
clinic where three MD's

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:58.700
requested it.

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:00.460
And they hooked people
up with all of

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:02.330
these wires and machines.

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:04.120
And they found that
rebooting--

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.530
now, you know, when a computer
goes down, when there's a

00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:08.300
problem, what do we do?

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:09.570
We reboot.

00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:12.620
But often, as humans,
we don't reboot.

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:15.450
So I've been working in
corporations, and as Rachel

00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:17.950
said, the workplace, where
I've been helping people

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:19.630
reboot twice a day.

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:22.510
And they have more energy at
the end of the day, more

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:23.750
creative ideas.

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:26.380
And then, with this study,
basically, it showed that

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:28.930
there was a 55% reduction
in stress.

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:30.690
We can all have less stress.

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:33.500
And that the autonomic nervous
system changed,

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:34.360
and the heart changed.

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:36.360
And here's why.

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:37.159
You may know this.

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:39.150
But I'm going to just go through
the sympathetic and

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:40.710
the parasympathetic.

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:44.610
Right now, take a moment, just
where you're sitting, and just

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:47.870
ask yourself, with no judgment,
just observing, are

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:51.050
you breathing from down here
in your lower diaphragm?

00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:52.825
Or are you breathing up here?

00:08:52.825 --> 00:08:55.930
Or are you basically holding
your breath a lot?

00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:59.810
No judgment, just notice,
just notice.

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:02.270
It's the first of what I call
the integrative conversation

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:03.540
between the mind and the body.

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:04.560
[BREATHES IN DEEPLY]

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:05.790
STEVE SISGOLD: I observe
my breath several

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:06.720
times during the day.

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:08.430
I don't walk around thinking
about it a lot.

00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:10.770
But just as I'm driving, I'm
leaving here to pick up some

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:12.320

driving just--

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:13.120

down in my belly and

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:15.160
noticing I'm breathing.

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:16.690
And here's why.

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:20.680
We were made, biologically, that
if we're in a jungle, and

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:24.950
there's a tiger chasing us, we
can get up that tree very

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:28.010
quickly because we go into our
sympathetic nervous system,

00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:29.000
which is breathing up here.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.710
[SHALLOW GASPS]

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:32.650
STEVE SISGOLD: And as a result,
here's what happens.

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:35.590
Digestive system starts to
slow down, almost shut.

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:37.630
So a lot of times, if you're
having digestive problems,

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:38.600
it's because you're--

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:38.800
[SHALLOW GASP]

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:39.950
STEVE SISGOLD: --breathing
up here.

00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:42.800
And the biology is telling
your digestive

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:43.880
system, shut down.

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:45.630
I've got to get up that tree.

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:47.030
Does that make sense?

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:49.680
Secondly, your heartbeat
starts to really race.

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:51.830
So you're pumping a lot of blood
to get up that tree.

00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:53.875
And your muscles tighten
and tense so you

00:09:53.875 --> 00:09:54.540
can get up that tree.

00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:56.750
Now, just imagine that choice.

00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:58.200
I want to give that
to you right now.

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:01.840
Every one of you, and myself,
have a choice.

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:05.810
Choice point-- am I breathing in
my lower abdomen, like yoga

00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:07.290
teachers and martial artists?

00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:09.910
You'll notice they're all
breathing down here.

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:11.120
Or am I breathing up here?

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.860
When I'm breathing up
here, I'm in my

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:14.580
sympathetic nervous system.

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:17.060
And that means my digestive
system's shutting down.

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:18.350
My heart's beating fast.

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:19.880
And my muscles are tense.

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:22.270
And often, that will correct
just the idea of having

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:25.160
tension, being exhausted
at the end of the day.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:29.080
So just notice that that's a
choice between my breathing.

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:32.590
So right now, just notice, what
did you learn, anybody,

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:33.650
just about your breathing?

00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:36.620
Like, is it easy to breathe
in or breathe out?

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:37.760
Are you breathing--

or up in your chest?

Are you not even aware,
usually, of

00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:44.710
where your breath is?

Does anybody want to just
say anything you

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:47.410
noticed, just for--

AUDIENCE: So right when I
started paying attention to

00:10:51.349 --> 00:10:52.991
it, I think I took
a deeper breath,

00:10:52.991 --> 00:10:53.929
probably from lower down.

00:10:53.929 --> 00:10:56.280
But if I'm not paying attention
to it, [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:58.990
STEVE SISGOLD: OK, so
basically-- thank you so much

00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:00.360
because that's exactly it.

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:03.520
By paying attention to it, I
was taking in more oxygen,

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:05.410
which is going to oxygenate
my body.

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:08.610
I'm going to have better
circulation.

00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:11.000
Cold hands, cold feet,
that comes from

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.670
breathing up in the chest.

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:14.610
And I'm going to take in more.

[BREATHES IN DEEPLY]

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:17.270
STEVE SISGOLD: So I'm going to
have more energy, more oxygen.

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:21.180
And I'm going to be in my
parasympathetic nervous system

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:22.260
where I can be relaxed.

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:23.460
I can make better decisions.

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:26.490
It's kind of like a wider view
than when we're tense.

00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:29.100
So I just wanted to start with
that and show you this.

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:39.630
And here's two guys, if you
can see it, who are

00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:44.030
absolutely, the title of the
speech, staying resilient and

00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:44.940
engaged in one purpose.

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:46.870
Now, the reason I show you
that-- if you can't see it,

00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:48.210
they're two cavemen.

00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:50.210
I tell you what, they're not
thinking about anything that's

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:51.450
happening before.

00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:52.475
They're not thinking about
what happened at

00:11:52.475 --> 00:11:53.520
the breakfast table.

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:54.670
They're not thinking
about later.

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:56.300
They're totally engaged.

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:59.820
And they're what's called
"intrasomatic." We used to be

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:01.020
intrasomatic.

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:03.950
We used to-- everything was
like smell, taste, touch.

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:05.190
I have a little granddaughter.

00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:07.240
Everything's feel, right?

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:08.560
But then, we forget.

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:11.310
So I just want to show you
the two kinds of ways.

00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:15.140
I think it's great that we're
more than just cognitive, and

00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:17.960
not just intrasomatic and
touching, and that we have

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:19.600
such great technologies.

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:23.140
But at the same time, that
imbalance of where we're

00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:28.290
always outside and not feeling
can take us into stress, and

00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:30.580
can lower our immunity
system, and can get

00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:31.680
us to be less creative.

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:33.340
So just take that in
for a minute that

00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:34.490
there's always two choices.

00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:39.840
One is intrasomatic, where
you're using your senses.

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:43.190
Somebody gives you a problem
or a question, you can go

00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:44.000
right to your mind.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:44.963
Or you can take a moment--

[BREATHES IN DEEPLY]

00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:47.190
STEVE SISGOLD: --take that
deep breath, and start to

00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:48.220
really listen.

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:50.580
And I guarantee you'll get
better answers, even more

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:52.900
answers, more solutions,
more options.

00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:54.950
Then, we became extrasomatic.

00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:56.090
We started to write.

00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:57.660
And we started to go external.

00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:00.550
So basically, that's a fortune
cookie saying, I can't give

00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:02.870
you any information.

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:07.230
And then, we became really
extrasomatic, where, pretty

00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:10.360
much, we were looking outside
for everything, OK?

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:15.510
So we're going to be working,
today, on how to, pretty much,

00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:19.530
get more intrasomatic and
more into our body.

00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:22.930
And of course, on top of that,
many of us were told it is not

00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:24.500
OK to speak up.

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:26.980
It's not OK to say
what we need.

00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:29.400
And as a result, a lot
of us became more

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:31.210
shut down and inside.

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:33.650
So I'm going to take you through
a little internal

00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:35.230
assessment, if you would.

00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:38.730
I've got some sheets here
we can hand out.

00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:41.240
And we're just going to take a
little what I call a "BQ test"

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:43.100
together, OK?

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:48.020
And through that, my intention
is that each of you will have

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:50.260
a little more awareness.

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.580
And just ask these questions
with no judgment, just

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:54.380
observation.

00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:55.630
And we'll go through
them together.

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:01.300
And if it's OK, Rachel,
I'm going to need one.

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:02.760
I just realized that.

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:05.460
So I can go through it together
with everybody.

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:06.520
And you can share.

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:12.560
Or I'll be glad to make sure
that Rachel gives you whatever

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:13.950
I hand out today if
you don't get one.

00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:15.980
But we'll go through
it together.

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:19.810
So the first question to ask
yourself is, how often do I

00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:21.660
notice the quality
of my breathing?

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:25.070
Like, right now, in this moment,
just ask yourself--

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:28.660
again, connecting with your
body intelligence--

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:31.140
is it shallow, deep. relaxed,
short, choppy?

00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:33.810
Just aware.

00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:35.590
Is it easier to breathe
in or out?

00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:40.010
Sometimes, if people have
difficulty breathing in,

00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:41.630
they're not able to
receive, just a--

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:44.520
STEVE SISGOLD: Take it in,
really take it in.

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:46.390
So take a deep breath from
your lower belly.

00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:50.590
And just notice, with no
judgment, what's happening for

00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:51.250
me right now?

00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:54.045
Am I breathing easy?

00:14:54.045 --> 00:14:58.240
The second question is, how
often do you consciously pause

00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:01.440
from what you're doing just to
take a few deep breaths?

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:03.610
You'll notice a pitcher on the
pitcher's mound starting to

00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:06.440
get sweaty, starting to have a
bad game, what is the first

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:07.265
thing you usually notice?

[BREATHES IN DEEPLY]

00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:09.850
STEVE SISGOLD: They're trained
to take deep breaths.

00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:11.800
The same thing with somebody
at the foul line playing

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:12.830
basketball.

00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:13.630

00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:21.260
STEVE SISGOLD: --and come
back to that center.

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.720
This is just something that you
may or may not be doing.

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:25.800
But it's good to be aware of.

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:28.970
How often do you scan your
body to connect with how

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:29.660
you're feeling?

00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:34.095
So right now, with no judgment,
just take a moment.

00:15:34.095 --> 00:15:36.040
You can close your
eyes, or not.

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:39.025
And just take a scan of your
body, just to notice.

00:15:39.025 --> 00:15:43.230
See, I'm noticing, since I've
said that, several people have

00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:46.090
uncrossed their legs, sit up
straight, kind of make your

00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:46.930
shoulders--

00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:48.660
again, there's no judgment.

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:52.300
It's just an awareness that
throughout a whole workday,

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:54.990
how often am I taking a
moment to go, what's

00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:56.840
happening in my body?

00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:01.040
I could be giving a message
that's not getting across.

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:02.550
I could be slumping.

00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:05.790
I could be holding onto my
computer, just anything that

00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:06.480
we're aware of.

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:09.390
So just now, if you want--
you don't have to.

00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:12.580
What did you just observe that
you weren't aware of a moment

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:15.630
ago, anybody, in your breathing,
or your body, or

00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:17.920
scanning your body?

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:21.435
Does anybody want
to call it out?

00:16:21.435 --> 00:16:22.310
AUDIENCE: Slouching.

00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:22.710
STEVE SISGOLD: Thank you.

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:24.300
I was slouching, OK.

00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:25.900
And again, no judgment.

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:29.290
But notice, as you go along and
we do the reboot, you'll

00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:30.690
be able to correct that.

00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:32.880
You'll be able to say,
I'm slouching.

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:35.050
That means I'm cutting
off my circulation.

00:16:35.050 --> 00:16:36.780
I'm cutting off my energy.

00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:38.570
I'm stressing myself.

00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:41.550
I'm cutting off oxygen from
my innovative thinking.

STEVE SISGOLD: --just taking a
deep breath, and unslouching,

But we'll do more of that
in a little bit.

00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:56.460
When you feel an uncomfortable
sensation, pain, or emotion in

00:16:56.460 --> 00:17:03.000
your body, is your tendency to
tune into it or ignore it?

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.130
You don't have to
answer out loud.

00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:05.369
But just take that in.

00:17:05.369 --> 00:17:08.319
How often do I feel instinct,
I want to say something, I

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:11.250
have a good idea, that doesn't
feel right, I don't want to

00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:13.930
go, but I'm going to say yes to
please that person, but my

00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:15.000
whole body's screaming?

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.500
I have lots of stories
about that today.

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:19.960
Would you say you have a
body-friendly vocabulary?

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:22.839
This is very, very important.

00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:24.760
A lot of us got in the habit
of saying, that's

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:26.369
a pain in my neck.

00:17:26.369 --> 00:17:28.630
Oh, man, that's a real
pain in my--

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:32.870
and what happens is the message
is being sent down

00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:35.130
through your nervous system
into your body.

00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:41.090
So I had a client that had a
really tough ache from the top

00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:45.550
of his head down the back of
his neck for six years.

00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:47.740
And through breathing and some
awareness-- this is going to

00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:48.710
sound simple.

00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:51.510
But it is simple.

00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:53.400
I said, what happened
six years ago?

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:55.580
As he was tuning in to, well,
this happened in a

00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:58.530
relationship and different
things-- but you know, I

00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:00.630
stopped paying my taxes
six years ago.

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:05.930
OK, yeah, what do you do every
time the thought comes up,

00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:08.870
which is at least once a day,
that you're avoiding the IRS?

00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:10.700
He says, oh, I have
this saying.

00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:12.770
"I'm going to put it in
the back of my head."

00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:18.280
Ah, well, if you study biology
again, he's sending a message

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:22.940
to the back of his head that
says, avoidance and pain.

00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:24.800
And he's had pain
for six years.

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:26.140
Kind of a coincidence.

00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:27.960
I made a simple suggestion.

00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:30.010
Call the IRS.

00:18:30.010 --> 00:18:31.460
I had an audit recently.

00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:32.930
They're not going to bite.

00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:33.870
Call the IRS.

00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:34.910
Work out a plan with them.

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:36.070
He says, well, OK.

00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:40.860
He calls the IRS, works out
a plan with them, pain

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:42.870
goes away that day.

00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:46.510
So I just really want to invite
you to be aware of what

00:18:46.510 --> 00:18:47.420
you say to your body.

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:47.970
I'm fat.

00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:48.560
I'm ugly.

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:49.690
Oh, that person's a big pain.

00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:51.620
Oh, that makes me sick.

00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:55.390
Every time you do that, you're
sending a message into your

00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:57.760
body that's going to
impact your body.

00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:00.320
So I just really want to share
that because it's really

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:03.000
important to have a
body-friendly vocabulary and

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.910
not to let it out
on your body.

00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:07.530
Are you aware of how congruent
your words and your body

00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:08.640
language are?

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:11.380
I'm constantly looking at that,
being a speaker, that if

00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:12.600
I'm telling you--

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:13.850
a good example.

00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:18.390
I work with a chiropractor who
had a tremendous skill when

00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:21.450
you got on his table, had the
best location, had all the

00:19:21.450 --> 00:19:22.610
good stuff.

00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:23.870
But some reason--

00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:24.440
he came to me.

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:26.470
He said, I can't build
my business.

00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:28.600
Well, let me tell you, when you
meet this guy, this is how

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:30.110
he greets you.

00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:32.230
Now, who wants to go to a
chiropractor that's hunched

00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:33.690
over like that?

00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:36.980
So even though he's saying the
right things, his body

00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:38.960
language-- that's what
I noticed in sales.

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:42.690
The body language wasn't
expressing health.

00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:45.930
So I did something with him,
which we're going to do today.

00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:49.410
I had him say out loud what he
wanted, just say it out loud

00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:50.170
three times.

00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:52.650
And he says, OK, I want
to have a succ--

00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:53.930
[COUGH]

00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:56.520
STEVE SISGOLD: Oh, boy, mm,
something in my throat.

00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:57.310
I want to have a succ--

00:19:57.310 --> 00:19:57.930
[COUGH]

00:19:57.930 --> 00:20:00.300
STEVE SISGOLD: He could not get
the word "successful" out.

00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:03.210
He was trying to say, I want to
have a successful practice.

00:20:03.210 --> 00:20:06.370
But every time he said the word
"successful," something

00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:07.580
in his body was speaking.

00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:09.130
And he just ignored it.

00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:13.170
So I had him tune into it, feel
into it, and go into it.

00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:15.400
And I don't know if you ever
heard this term before, but he

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:17.160
had what's called a "cellular
memory." Have you

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:18.450
ever heard that term?

00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:20.450
Or a "somatic recall?"

00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:23.460
What that's saying is that
everything that ever happened

00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:26.490
to us, from the womb
until today, lives

00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:27.410
somewhere in ourselves.

00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:30.060
This is being proven
by biologists.

00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:32.640
Candace Pert, great book
on "Biology of

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:34.450
Belief," Bruce Lipton.

00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:36.870
These people are proving, under
the microscope, that in

00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:39.150
our body are memories.

00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:40.880
So I have this guy breathe.

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:42.500
And I've done this
with many people.

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:46.220
And I let his body go into the
posture it wanted to, versus

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:47.270
trying to get out of it.

00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:50.650
And as he said, I want to have a
successful practice, it kept

00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:52.420
shrinking down like this.

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:55.270
And the more he said it and let
it happen, he shrunk down

00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:57.840
to the point where he says,
god, I'm having a memory.

00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:00.200
But I don't know if it's
conscious or I'm making it up.

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:01.570
And I said, that's OK.

00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:02.420
What are you seeing?

00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:05.010
And he says, I'm looking
out the window.

00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:08.180
And I'm seeing every one of my
neighbors are getting new

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:11.200
bikes, and new toys, and new
skates for Christmas.

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:13.040
And I don't get anything.

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:15.990
OK, what do you think?

00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:18.590
He said, well, I remember going
to my dad and my dad

00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:20.690
saying, son, you don't
want any new things.

00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:23.070
Money will make you sick.

00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:24.700
You know how many
parents do that?

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:26.530
Inconvenient, it's a hassle.

00:21:26.530 --> 00:21:27.760
Mommy, I'm really hot.

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:28.680
You're not hot.

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:30.780
Yeah, I'm real--
no, you're not.

00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:32.722
What does that teach the kid?

00:21:32.722 --> 00:21:36.438
What does that teach
a kid, anybody?

00:21:36.438 --> 00:21:37.840
AUDIENCE: To hold back
their feelings?

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:39.790
STEVE SISGOLD: Suppress their
feelings, and, maybe I don't

00:21:39.790 --> 00:21:41.860
know what I feel.

00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:44.190
No kidding, two days ago, I
went to the hot springs.

00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:44.970
I was just relaxing.

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:46.040
And I was sitting there.

00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:47.020
And I watched--

00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:48.000
it's crazy.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.480
I watched a mother bring this
cucumber juice, which is great

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:55.250
for us at spas, to
the little girl.

00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:56.380
And she said, you'll
love this.

00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:58.960
It's like lemonade.

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:00.240
And the little girl drinks it.

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:00.970
And she says, eew, it's--

00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:01.600
I don't like it.

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:03.030
Yeah, it's like lemonade.

00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:04.200
I don't like it.

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:05.750
And I'm thinking
to myself, hey,

00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:08.300
lady, that's not lemonade.

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:09.040
I'm sorry.

00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:10.820
But that's cucumber water.

00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:12.580
So what happened?

00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:16.620
The kid had to drink it and make
up for the mom, oh, yeah,

00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:17.180
this is good.

00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:18.100
It's like lemonade.

00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:19.970
But two things came out
of that for me.

00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:25.220
One is, wow, she can't even
have her own sense because

00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:29.560
she's trained, like many of us,
that, no, this tastes like

00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:31.600
this, or, no, it's
not hot in here.

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:34.410
And then, we start to lose that
trust in our instincts.

00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:35.470
Does that make sense?

00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:36.450
Yeah.

00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:40.990
And then, the second thing was
she now has to lower--

00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:43.210
she has to now take lower
than what she deserves.

00:22:43.210 --> 00:22:46.240
Now, she's already being trained
that even though you

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:48.910
don't like it, and even though
it doesn't taste like sugary

00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:51.170
lemonade, I've got to
settle for this.

00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:52.310
Does that make sense?

00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:57.230
Those little messages that go
in that we teach each other.

00:22:57.230 --> 00:22:59.900
So let's go on to, when
you make a decision--

00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:01.570
and this is a big one--

00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:04.290
whether it's a small or a
large one, do you take a

00:23:04.290 --> 00:23:08.380
moment to consult how your body
feels before you decide?

00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:11.180
Or do you just use your mind?

00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:13.510
Because let me tell you, I have
made investments through

00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:15.600
my mind because I thought
I should.

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:17.270
And they don't always work.

00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:20.520
But then, there are times where
I would take a breath

00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:21.270
and listen.

00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:23.000
And I would feel something
in my body.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.210
And rather than ignoring
it, I would touch that

00:23:25.210 --> 00:23:26.210
spot and just listen.

00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:29.510
And I'd go, oh, yeah, there's
that memory living in my body

00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:31.010
that says this is not good.

00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:34.110
Or there's something in
my instinct that says,

00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:35.510
don't go with that.

00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:36.700
And I'll promise you--

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:38.640
and I'm sure you'll
find this too--

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:42.140
that when we listen, when we
take that few moments to just

00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:43.890
say-- and I've said that over
the phone to people.

00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:45.470
Hey, I've got a great speaking
gig for you.

00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:46.460
It's this, that, but that.

00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:46.740
And I go--

00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:48.040
I usually say, OK.

00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:49.410
Or, I want to go the
movies tonight.

00:23:49.410 --> 00:23:50.010
OK.

00:23:50.010 --> 00:23:52.810
Now, I go, hey, let me call
you back in a few minutes.

00:23:52.810 --> 00:23:53.900
And I listen.

00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:55.170
And I feel into--

00:23:55.170 --> 00:23:58.730
and you'll see, as we go along,
why that's important

00:23:58.730 --> 00:24:01.010
because there are beliefs
in us that live in our

00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:02.460
body from day one.

00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:05.680
And they will influence us
in the decisions we make.

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:09.010
So my recommendation is, before
you make decisions,

00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:12.750
before you jump into a project,
just take a moment,

00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:14.860
and ask your body, and just
kind of listen to that

00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:15.560
intelligence.

00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:18.500
It's so intelligent when
we listen to it.

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:20.560
And on a scale of 1 to 10--

00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:21.510
just curious--

00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:25.100
how comfortable do you feel
in your own body?

00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:27.200
And just notice that.

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:30.290
So before we go on, I'm going
to get ready for this next

00:24:30.290 --> 00:24:32.260
slide, here.

00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:36.170
We can't solve problems with
the same kind of thinking,

00:24:36.170 --> 00:24:42.120
meaning if we have a problem,
and we're stuck in our head,

00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:44.490
and we keep-- what
I call "spin"--

00:24:44.490 --> 00:24:46.670
spinning that same thought,
we usually

00:24:46.670 --> 00:24:48.430
don't get to the solution.

00:24:48.430 --> 00:24:51.300
So here's, again, another
example of the body.

00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:53.930
And this is not to brag, but
just to get the point across.

00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:59.300
I had a rock star who had
written many, many songs and

00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:00.850
is a tremendous songwriter.

00:25:00.850 --> 00:25:03.360
He's got big hits, Grammys,
the whole works.

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:04.180
And he came to me.

00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:06.380
He said, you know, I
have a contract.

00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:08.380
And he had a tremendous
producer, Babyface.

00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:10.410
And he said, I don't
know what happened.

00:25:10.410 --> 00:25:11.320
But I'm blocked.

00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:13.150
I cannot write.

00:25:13.150 --> 00:25:14.300
No problem.

00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:16.630
That's where the title "What's
Your Body Telling You?" comes,

00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:19.840
because what happens is when we
go up here for the answer,

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:23.170
remember, this is what created
the block in the first place--

00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:24.130
our thoughts.

00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:28.390
Our thoughts sent a belief,
a feeling into our body.

00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:29.810
And those beliefs stay
in our body.

00:25:29.810 --> 00:25:31.100
I call them viral beliefs.

00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:33.090
They're like viruses.

00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:37.450
So this guy says the same thing,
which we're going to do

00:25:37.450 --> 00:25:38.890
in a few moments.

00:25:38.890 --> 00:25:39.980
I had him say what he wants.

00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:42.740
And he says, I want
to write songs.

00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:43.990
And I want to get
back on tour.

00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:47.200
And, boy, things were happening
in his body.

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:48.620
Started sweating profusely.

00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:51.130
Some anxiety was coming up.

00:25:51.130 --> 00:25:54.800
Again, here's a guy who sits
at his piano and his guitar

00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:56.490
and says, I've got to
write a new song.

00:25:56.490 --> 00:25:57.390
I've got to write a new song.

00:25:57.390 --> 00:25:59.110
I've got to write it because--

00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:00.520
nothing's coming out.

00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:01.230
Can you relate?

00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:02.280
I mean, what's he doing?

00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:03.280
He's stressing.

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:05.330
He's going through the
same belief systems.

00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:06.740
And he's trying to get
it up here, which

00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:08.460
is the problem anyway.

00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:11.240
Dropping him into the lower
belly, breathing--

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:12.820

All I did was said, what's
your body telling you?

00:26:18.370 --> 00:26:19.420
Tell me what you want.

00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:20.970
And as he did that--

00:26:20.970 --> 00:26:24.720
what we usually do is we push
those emotions down.

00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:26.050
We push that feeling down.

00:26:26.050 --> 00:26:29.270
We'll do anything we have to,
whether it's a pizza, whether

00:26:29.270 --> 00:26:32.210
it's a glass of wine, whether
it's a TV show.

00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:34.540
We'll do anything we can

It's just training myself to go,
no, I'm going to listen.

So this guy listens
into his body.

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:48.240

starting to see how it was the

last time I went on tour.

Because it was a great tour.

00:27:05.170 --> 00:27:07.290
It was successful.

My brother and I started
getting into fights.

He got a little jealous.

00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:36.540
And then, we worked the rest of
the day-- because he came

00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:37.470
up to my home.

00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:41.540
We spent the rest of the day
embodying, getting in his body

00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:44.780
that he could actually have
a different viral belief.

00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:47.540
His viral belief was, if
I write new songs,

00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:48.940
if I go out on tour--

00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:52.020
in other words, if I create my
genius again, I'm going to

00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:53.460
lose people, right?

00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:55.180
Because that's what
the experience--

00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:57.270
every one of you have done
things where you had an

00:28:57.270 --> 00:28:59.390
experience, and it's
in your body.

00:28:59.390 --> 00:29:00.880
And you might not think it.

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:03.980
But it might be living
somewhere inside.

00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:07.610
So basically, we worked that
day on him getting into his

00:29:07.610 --> 00:29:10.790
body, as I go on tour,
as I write new songs,

00:29:10.790 --> 00:29:12.960
I'll make new friends.

00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:14.080
People will stay in my life.

00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:15.440
And eventually, he got it.

00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:17.120
And that night, we
wrote a song.

00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:18.340
I'm also a songwriter.

00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:21.360
Secondly, he, that year,
had a Grammy.

00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:23.390
And the next year, he sang
the song on the Oscars.

00:29:23.390 --> 00:29:25.780
Again, that's just
one example.

00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:28.700
But you'll see, since you have
my book, many examples of

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:31.290
people who just, when they
listened, and they went

00:29:31.290 --> 00:29:35.490
inside, and really listened and
tuned in, they noticed,

00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:37.000
wow, there's a belief in me.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.680
I'm going to give you
my belief quickly.

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:41.220
And then, we're going to
do some work together.

00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:45.740
So when I was a little older
than the last story--

00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:47.340
maybe, I was about 10 or 11.

00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:52.200
I was raised in Baltimore City
in a row house neighborhood

00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:54.620
with everything in about
a four-block radius.

00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:58.120
I had 23 cousins, five aunts and
uncles, and there was the

00:29:58.120 --> 00:29:58.860
grocery store.

00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:01.210
I never left the neighborhood.

00:30:01.210 --> 00:30:03.250
We didn't know there was
an outside world.

00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:05.510
As far as we were concerned,
this is life.

00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:08.010
This is our life in
Baltimore City.

00:30:08.010 --> 00:30:10.830
So one day, my cousins and
I got a bright idea.

00:30:10.830 --> 00:30:14.120
And we decided that we wanted
to go out and see what the

00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:15.140
world was like.

00:30:15.140 --> 00:30:17.080
So we put our little
sweaters on.

00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:19.590
And we walked up to what's
called Park Heights Avenue.

00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:20.930
And we stuck our thumbs out.

00:30:20.930 --> 00:30:22.450
We were like this--

00:30:22.450 --> 00:30:23.710
big shots.

00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:24.660
We were in our body.

00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:25.380
We were happy.

00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:26.460
We were excited.

00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:29.320
And all of a sudden, a shiny,
black Chevrolet pulled up.

00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:30.480
I had never seen anything
like it.

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:32.580
It had mag wheels.

00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:36.520
And guys came out of it,
like more than six.

00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:38.190
I had never seen guys like
this in my life.

00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:39.560
I didn't know they existed.

00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:43.820
They had greasy hair,
long, back.

00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:45.370
They had black jackets.

00:30:45.370 --> 00:30:46.565
And they were swinging chains.

00:30:46.565 --> 00:30:49.990
I had never seen people
like this before.

00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:52.770
They called us names and
started to beat on us.

00:30:52.770 --> 00:30:54.740
And we ran home.

00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:57.730
I want to ask you, what's
the viral belief that I

00:30:57.730 --> 00:30:58.770
took in that day?

00:30:58.770 --> 00:30:59.450

That going out too
big is unsafe.

00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:19.895
Well, guess what?

00:31:19.895 --> 00:31:21.750
I have done a lot of
work on myself.

00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:23.590

I'm up here.

But one day, when my book came
out, I got a national TV show.

My mind was like, woo-hoo,
yeah, yeah, I can't wait.

I can't wait to get out there.

you're on in five minutes.

And I started sweating
profusely.

00:31:43.225 --> 00:31:44.280
I had an anxiety--

00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:46.160
I didn't even know what
an anxiety attack was.

I can't wait.

But somewhere in my
body, there was

00:31:53.330 --> 00:31:55.140
something blocking me.

00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:56.250
And I had five minutes.

00:31:56.250 --> 00:31:58.760
So I ran to the restroom.

00:31:58.760 --> 00:31:59.510
And I breathed.

00:31:59.510 --> 00:32:00.290
And I listened.

00:32:00.290 --> 00:32:02.940
And man, it was like I was back
on Park Heights Avenue,

00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:05.350
and I was 11 years old,
hitchhiking, I swear.

00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:07.060
I said, that's what it is.

00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:09.560
So I had to kind of breathe
and relax myself, and tell

00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:12.320
that inner memory that I'm going
to be safe and accepted.

of us, inside, had things

happen, whether it was
somebody betrayed us?

to create in your life.

AUDIENCE: I smile a lot.

00:35:14.508 --> 00:35:16.480
But I definitely was smiling.

00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:18.850
STEVE SISGOLD: OK, that's
a good sign.

00:35:18.850 --> 00:35:20.266
Anybody else?

00:35:20.266 --> 00:35:21.780
AUDIENCE: I felt
my belly a lot.

00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:24.716
But when my eyes were closed, I
felt I was breathing a lot.

00:35:24.716 --> 00:35:26.120
And I kind of felt that
when I said it, too.

00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:26.820
STEVE SISGOLD: Thank you.

00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:29.670
So again, this is awareness for
you to take further after

00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:33.910
today, to say, wow, is there
something like Steve or like

00:35:33.910 --> 00:35:35.900
that rock star who
had the block?

00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:38.060
Is it like the guy who couldn't
build his practice?

00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:41.280
By the way, once he cleared that
belief that his father

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:44.020
taught him, that success will
make you sick-- that's what

00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:45.450
his father taught him--

00:35:45.450 --> 00:35:48.000
and he started affirming and
bringing into his body that

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.320
his success would actually make
him healthy, the guy's

00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:52.240
business just quadrupled.

00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:53.480
I've got it in writing.

00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:54.270
It changes.

00:35:54.270 --> 00:35:57.180
When we change in here, we
become the person that can

00:35:57.180 --> 00:35:59.020
walk in a room and
manifest it.

00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:02.010
If we're walking in, and our
mind wants it, but our body's

00:36:02.010 --> 00:36:04.160
exuding another message,
that's the result

00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:04.950
we're going to get.

00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:06.620
So here's the best question.

00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:10.220
Partner two, or B, what did
you notice, anybody?

00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:12.290
What did you notice
in your partner?

00:36:12.290 --> 00:36:14.130
Did you see anything?

00:36:14.130 --> 00:36:14.780
Were they happy?

00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:15.800
Did they give you--

00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:17.310
I noticed when you said
what you wanted,

00:36:17.310 --> 00:36:18.050
your hand went up--

00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:18.310
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:36:18.310 --> 00:36:20.600
STEVE SISGOLD: --which could
be a good thing.

00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:21.900
So what did you notice?

00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:23.670
What did you notice?

00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:25.760
AUDIENCE: He lit up
after he said it.

00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:26.990
He got happy with it.

00:36:26.990 --> 00:36:29.900
STEVE SISGOLD: Yeah, so when
my partner said what he

00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:31.150
wanted, he lit up.

00:36:31.150 --> 00:36:32.190
His hand went up in the air.

00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:33.250
And he lit up.

00:36:33.250 --> 00:36:35.380
But it could have been
like, I want a--

00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:35.940
I want a--

00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:37.930
I want a new relationship.

00:36:37.930 --> 00:36:39.970
Or I want to write
a book this year.

00:36:39.970 --> 00:36:41.420
Oh, but you know--

00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:43.590
and that kind of stuff is
what we communicate.

00:36:43.590 --> 00:36:45.740
Anybody else, either
partner A or B?

00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:46.730
What did you notice?

00:36:46.730 --> 00:36:47.960
What did you learn
from this simple

00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:49.810
exercise so far, anybody?

00:36:52.335 --> 00:36:54.120
AUDIENCE: When I turned
to thinking about it--

00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:54.445
STEVE SISGOLD: Yeah.

00:36:54.445 --> 00:36:57.638
AUDIENCE: I was definitely
focusing on what I'd seen.

00:36:57.638 --> 00:37:00.745
I know it's like-- yeah, I was
kind of like doing this sort

00:37:00.745 --> 00:37:03.860
of like levitating forward
thing [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:04.360
STEVE SISGOLD: Thank you.

00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:07.740
So again, see this mind-body
connection we're having in the

00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:08.340
room right now?

00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:09.250
That was excellent.

00:37:09.250 --> 00:37:11.810
When I thought about what
I wanted, something

00:37:11.810 --> 00:37:12.960
started with my knees.

00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:16.392
In other words, your body
is intelligent.

00:37:16.392 --> 00:37:17.800
I can show you more slides.

00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:19.670
But here's the basics
of those slides.

00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:21.450
Dr. Paul Pearsall--

00:37:21.450 --> 00:37:23.130
and we're going to do
another partner.

00:37:23.130 --> 00:37:23.990
So just hang in.

00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:29.710
Dr. Paul Pearsall, he found, as
a heart transplant doctor,

00:37:29.710 --> 00:37:34.390
surgeon, that the recipient
who got the heart started

00:37:34.390 --> 00:37:37.370
having feelings and thoughts
of the person

00:37:37.370 --> 00:37:39.830
who died, even foods.

00:37:39.830 --> 00:37:40.890
So imagine that.

00:37:40.890 --> 00:37:42.670
The heart is intelligent.

00:37:42.670 --> 00:37:44.770
You put a new person's heart,
and you start having different

00:37:44.770 --> 00:37:46.440
behaviors, different
thoughts, and

00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:48.660
different personality traits?

00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:51.360
Wow, that tells me that
that heart's not

00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:52.310
just pumping blood.

00:37:52.310 --> 00:37:55.880
It holds onto memories,
feelings, betrayal.

00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:58.310
Dr. Gershon, on the other hand--
and by the way, you can

00:37:58.310 --> 00:38:00.170
have my PowerPoint, anybody
that wants to

00:38:00.170 --> 00:38:01.920
see any of the slides.

00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:03.770
Dr. Gershon, on the
other hand, has

00:38:03.770 --> 00:38:04.790
done work in the gut.

00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:06.645
The gut has the same buildup
as the brain.

00:38:06.645 --> 00:38:09.720
The gut has the neurons,
the nervous system.

00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:12.220
So when you get a gut instinct,
that's a brain

00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:13.240
talking to you.

00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:14.440
But we ignore it.

00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:15.930
So just be aware of that.

00:38:15.930 --> 00:38:18.310
And every one of you, today,
so far-- thank you for

00:38:18.310 --> 00:38:19.420
participating--

00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:21.810
I saw your bodies were
doing something

00:38:21.810 --> 00:38:23.400
related to what you want.

00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:25.850
And the more you go in and
listen to that, the more you

00:38:25.850 --> 00:38:29.290
may be able to clear a block,
get an instinct, see what's

00:38:29.290 --> 00:38:29.940
right or wrong.

00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:31.700
So now, we're going to
switch partners.

00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:35.280
Partner B, take a moment
and close your eyes.

00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:40.850
And just notice what it is that
you would really love to

00:38:40.850 --> 00:38:44.950
create in your life, something
to do with your position, your

00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:50.100
work, something to do on a
personal level, family level,

00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:51.480
exercise level.

00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:54.820
Take a moment and say to
yourself, out loud--

00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:59.791
I mean, inside, what it is
that you want to create.

00:38:59.791 --> 00:39:10.560
And take a moment and notice,
what's happening

00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:12.250
for me right now?

00:39:12.250 --> 00:39:13.520
Just be aware of it.

00:39:18.250 --> 00:39:19.350
Notice what's happening
in your body.

00:39:19.350 --> 00:39:21.900
And now, partner B, when you're
ready, say out loud--

00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:22.560
open your eyes.

00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:26.450
Say out loud to your partner,
two times, what it is that you

00:39:26.450 --> 00:39:27.270
want to create.

00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:29.435
And just notice how
it impacts you.

00:39:29.435 --> 00:39:38.180
[CHATTERING]

00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:40.830
STEVE SISGOLD: OK, and then
we'll have partner

00:39:40.830 --> 00:39:42.580
conversation in a moment.

00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:43.930
So I noticed a few things.

00:39:43.930 --> 00:39:45.750
I noticed, right away, somebody

00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:47.040
said what they wanted.

00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:49.210
And then, they went, whoa,
I was really scared.

00:39:49.210 --> 00:39:52.050
That's great because
you notice.

00:39:52.050 --> 00:39:55.580
You notice, I want that,
and I'm afraid.

00:39:55.580 --> 00:39:57.500
There's a philosophy I have.

00:39:57.500 --> 00:39:59.560
I want this, but I'm afraid.

00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:03.870
The "but" absolutely drowns
out the desire every time.

00:40:03.870 --> 00:40:05.850
I'm going to write a new-- oh,
we don't need any more books.

00:40:05.850 --> 00:40:07.133
Oh, OK.

00:40:07.133 --> 00:40:07.820
You know?

00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:09.390
It's like I had to
get through that.

00:40:09.390 --> 00:40:10.540
I'm going to go out and sing.

00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:11.340
[MUTTERS]

00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:13.840
STEVE SISGOLD: So all these
beliefs that we were taught

00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:14.580
live in our body.

00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:17.570
And also, what'll happen is
we'll say, I want this.

00:40:17.570 --> 00:40:21.120
And then, our body will give us
a signal like fear or some

00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:23.530
parent who told us we couldn't
do it, and we just

00:40:23.530 --> 00:40:25.170
shut down the idea.

00:40:25.170 --> 00:40:27.370
But imagine this.

00:40:27.370 --> 00:40:28.380
I used to live on Maui.

00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:29.180
And people would come.

00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:31.790
And they'd want to dive off
of this famous spot.

00:40:31.790 --> 00:40:32.660
And they'd get up there.

00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:33.570
And they'd be ready to dive.

00:40:33.570 --> 00:40:35.080
And they would freeze.

00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:37.040
And I would say, OK,
you're at a choice.

00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:39.325
You can climb down, because
it's going to be easy.

00:40:39.325 --> 00:40:39.720
[SIGH]

00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:40.740
STEVE SISGOLD: I don't have
to go through it.

00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:42.990
And then, you're going to fly
home feeling like heck.

00:40:42.990 --> 00:40:44.330
Blech, I should have done it.

00:40:44.330 --> 00:40:44.791
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:44.791 --> 00:40:45.252
STEVE SISGOLD: Huh?

00:40:45.252 --> 00:40:46.635
AUDIENCE: Was it Black
Rock on Maui?

00:40:46.635 --> 00:40:47.096
STEVE SISGOLD: Um.

00:40:47.096 --> 00:40:48.020
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:49.470
STEVE SISGOLD: Exactly.

00:40:49.470 --> 00:40:50.300
Tuned in.

00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:52.080
The Black Rock-- she jumped.

00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:53.920
So here's what I told them.

00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:55.440
You can have both.

00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:58.400
You can have your desire
and your belief.

00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:01.680
You can say, I want to
jump, but I'm afraid.

00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:03.550
And change it to, I'm going
to jump anyway.

00:41:03.550 --> 00:41:06.610
So, I want to jump,
and I'm afraid.

00:41:06.610 --> 00:41:08.950
And then, once you do that,
you're going to jump.

00:41:08.950 --> 00:41:12.190
So this is how it goes every day
with every one of us, that

00:41:12.190 --> 00:41:13.695
in every moment it's a choice.

00:41:13.695 --> 00:41:14.520
[GASP]

00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:15.280
STEVE SISGOLD: My
fear came up.

00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:17.020
Should I just shut it down?

00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:17.940
I see some nods.

00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:18.906
That's good because you know.

00:41:18.906 --> 00:41:19.580
[GASP]

00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:20.750
STEVE SISGOLD: I want to
tell that new idea

00:41:20.750 --> 00:41:21.860
to my project manager.

00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:23.300
But, oh, they might
put it down.

00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:24.130
They're--

00:41:24.130 --> 00:41:26.030
and then, it goes back down.

00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:29.630
So I want to encourage you to
feel it, and be able to

00:41:29.630 --> 00:41:32.700
breathe through it, and say,
I'm going to do it anyway

00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:33.810
because then you have
an opportunity.

00:41:33.810 --> 00:41:38.520
So what did you notice, either
partner two in sharing it, or

00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:40.910
partner one in watching it?

00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:44.340
What did you notice, anybody?

00:41:44.340 --> 00:41:45.970
One person said, oh, I
said my dream, and

00:41:45.970 --> 00:41:46.830
I got really scared.

00:41:46.830 --> 00:41:49.360
That's good because now you
know, if you go through that

00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:50.740
fear, you'll have that dream.

00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:53.800
If you let that fear overwhelm
you, it'll lock your body and

00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:55.290
freeze you, and you won't.

00:41:55.290 --> 00:41:58.030
So, anybody, call out what
either you noticed with

00:41:58.030 --> 00:42:00.250
yourself or you noticed
with your partner.

00:42:00.250 --> 00:42:00.680
Please.

00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:02.190
AUDIENCE: Holding
their breath.

00:42:02.190 --> 00:42:03.090
STEVE SISGOLD: Thank you.

00:42:03.090 --> 00:42:07.780
So I was taught, as a kid, by my
mom, when you drive through

00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:09.130
a tunnel, you hold your
breath, and your

00:42:09.130 --> 00:42:11.280
dreams will come true.

00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:13.110
It didn't work.

00:42:13.110 --> 00:42:16.110
Whenever I hold my breath,
what I do is I get small.

00:42:16.110 --> 00:42:17.220
I'm not oxygenated.

00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:18.390
And my mind isn't thinking.

00:42:18.390 --> 00:42:19.770
So that's a great awareness.

00:42:19.770 --> 00:42:20.250
Thank you.

00:42:20.250 --> 00:42:23.310
Really appreciate that because
it's just to notice that when

00:42:23.310 --> 00:42:24.230
I say what I want--

00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:25.180
[GASP]

00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:26.810
STEVE SISGOLD: --the natural
thing is to hold your breath.

00:42:26.810 --> 00:42:27.600
Why?

00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:28.720
Because that's what we do.

00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:30.860
When we get frightened, we get
right up to our sympathetic

00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:31.670
nervous system.

00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:32.820
And we hold our breath.

00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:35.150
So that's just something
for you to do is, can

00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:36.240
I say what I want--

00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:37.060
[BREATHES IN DEEPLY]

00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:38.100

take a breath--

[BREATHES OUT]

00:42:39.130 --> 00:42:41.190
STEVE SISGOLD: --and say it
again, and take a breath?

00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:43.270
And then, eventually, it
becomes comfortable.

00:42:43.270 --> 00:42:45.550
And my experience is,
you'll move forward.

00:42:45.550 --> 00:42:48.170
So thank you, all of you,
for being courageous

00:42:48.170 --> 00:42:49.260
enough to call out.

00:42:49.260 --> 00:42:52.970
Anybody else want to call out
what you noticed, either

00:42:52.970 --> 00:42:55.950
yourself or your partner?

00:42:55.950 --> 00:42:56.225
Please.

00:42:56.225 --> 00:42:59.110
AUDIENCE: I noticed that, for
Bill, when you had your eyes

00:42:59.110 --> 00:43:00.724
closed, you were swaying
back and forth.

00:43:00.724 --> 00:43:03.144
And then, when you said
what you wanted,

00:43:03.144 --> 00:43:05.564
you got very settled.

00:43:05.564 --> 00:43:07.500
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I was actually
more relaxed when I had my

00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:07.990
eyes closed.

00:43:07.990 --> 00:43:09.300
[INAUDIBLE].

00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:12.320
STEVE SISGOLD: OK, so what we're
hearing is, more relaxed

00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:14.660
when I was visioning, which
a lot of us do, right?

00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:15.810
I want to be this.

00:43:15.810 --> 00:43:17.160
I want to do that.

00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:20.130
And then, to come out
and say it, what

00:43:20.130 --> 00:43:21.380
happened in your body?

00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:25.680
AUDIENCE: Well, I wasn't sure
how to say it concisely enough

00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:26.590
to say it twice.

00:43:26.590 --> 00:43:27.080
STEVE SISGOLD: Yeah, OK.

00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:27.870
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:27.870 --> 00:43:29.232
what I was saying.

00:43:29.232 --> 00:43:31.176
I think it was with the
delivery, maybe, I got a

00:43:31.176 --> 00:43:31.830
little tense.

00:43:31.830 --> 00:43:33.720
STEVE SISGOLD: So maybe, I got
a little tense about the

00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:36.560
delivery, but again, just to
notice that and to be able to

00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:39.880
push through it, versus getting
stuck, frozen, and

00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:40.690
pushing that down.

00:43:40.690 --> 00:43:42.090
Does that make sense?

00:43:42.090 --> 00:43:42.930
OK, thank you.

00:43:42.930 --> 00:43:44.830
I hope you got something
out of that exercise.

00:43:44.830 --> 00:43:47.350
And I want to take it
a little further.

00:43:47.350 --> 00:43:49.920
So again, I want to leave
a little room for--

00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:51.190
[CHATTERING]

00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:53.290

to ask questions.

00:43:53.290 --> 00:43:54.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:56.625
STEVE SISGOLD: We're going to
practice this next exercise.

00:43:56.625 --> 00:44:00.361
[CHATTERING]

00:44:00.361 --> 00:44:02.550
STEVE SISGOLD: As we're handing
that out, here's the

00:44:02.550 --> 00:44:04.710
philosophy behind it.

00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:08.550
We repeat patterns.

00:44:08.550 --> 00:44:14.390
Like, if I kept going out, and
the world kept looking scary

00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:18.080
to me, that would
send a message.

00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:19.230
It's not on the PowerPoint.

00:44:19.230 --> 00:44:21.060
I'll just say, it's there.

00:44:21.060 --> 00:44:23.680
And basically, I was
going to show you a

00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:25.010
picture of the brain.

00:44:25.010 --> 00:44:32.270
And basically, the brain has
these networks so that every

00:44:32.270 --> 00:44:37.720
time you do something or say
something, that network is

00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:39.130
sending a message.

00:44:39.130 --> 00:44:42.920
When it says it over and
over repetitively,

00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:44.390
it then gets locked.

00:44:44.390 --> 00:44:46.010
The neuron gets locked.

00:44:46.010 --> 00:44:46.880
And it becomes--

00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:50.630
that whole neuron becomes
like a fixed wire.

00:44:50.630 --> 00:44:54.430
And then, because of
repetitiveness, we then make

00:44:54.430 --> 00:44:55.350
it an identity.

00:44:55.350 --> 00:44:56.700
Does that make sense?

00:44:56.700 --> 00:45:00.100
I have a thought that it's not
safe for me to go out, or

00:45:00.100 --> 00:45:02.660
somebody said I'm not good
enough, a Little League coach,

00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:03.970
or whoever it was.

00:45:03.970 --> 00:45:06.670
And then, somebody else says I'm
not good enough, somebody

00:45:06.670 --> 00:45:08.220
I'm dating or a parent.

00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:13.640
And then, by the fifth or the
500th time that I say that,

00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:16.350
what happens is it starts
to lock in.

00:45:16.350 --> 00:45:17.340
And its fixed.

00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:20.440
So it's not like something that
we're even in control of

00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:23.880
because every time we get in a
similar situation, the brain

00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:26.530
is immediately going to go,
you're in danger, even

00:45:26.530 --> 00:45:27.280
though we're not.

00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:28.740
Does that make sense?

00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:30.850
It's a repetitive thing
that the brain and

00:45:30.850 --> 00:45:31.740
neurotransmitter--

00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:34.490
so our kind of work we're doing
today is busting that.

00:45:34.490 --> 00:45:35.820
It's going to break it open.

00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:36.190
Thank you.

00:45:36.190 --> 00:45:37.030
I got it.

00:45:37.030 --> 00:45:38.080
Thank you so much.

00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:40.430
So basically, that's my little
viral belief graphic.

00:45:40.430 --> 00:45:46.990
But if you want, you can get
this PowerPoint from me or

00:45:46.990 --> 00:45:48.890
look into some of the
things I'm sharing.

00:45:48.890 --> 00:45:52.820
And what I was sharing was these
neurotransmitters that

00:45:52.820 --> 00:45:54.372
just keep coming in.

00:45:54.372 --> 00:45:57.050
OK, we'll pass on it now.

00:45:57.050 --> 00:45:59.580
But the point is it's a
picture of the brain.

00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:02.310
And it's a guy named
Dr. Joe Dispenza.

00:46:02.310 --> 00:46:03.760
And he has a book
about the brain.

00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:06.360
And basically, what he's
showing, again, under the

00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:10.020
microscope, is that if you're
repeating that over and over,

00:46:10.020 --> 00:46:12.010
that I'm not good enough--
so be careful

00:46:12.010 --> 00:46:13.470
what you say to yourself.

00:46:13.470 --> 00:46:14.540
I'm not smart enough.

00:46:14.540 --> 00:46:16.470
I'll never get that job.

00:46:16.470 --> 00:46:18.810
The brain-- and here's
how it works.

00:46:18.810 --> 00:46:21.480
So I was working with
an executive.

00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:23.690
Guess what this executive
does?

00:46:23.690 --> 00:46:29.830
This executive, whenever she
speaks, she gets a feedback

00:46:29.830 --> 00:46:32.295
that says, what you have to
say is not important.

00:46:32.295 --> 00:46:34.035
Can anybody relate
to that one?

00:46:34.035 --> 00:46:36.600
Yeah, what I have to say
is not important.

00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:37.710
Guess where it started?

00:46:37.710 --> 00:46:39.070
She started working with me.

00:46:39.070 --> 00:46:41.140
And we found it in the body.

00:46:41.140 --> 00:46:45.730
When she was a little girl,
she would be at the dinner

00:46:45.730 --> 00:46:48.410
table, and she would say
something that she thought was

00:46:48.410 --> 00:46:49.760
a great thing.

00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:52.180
And her brother always
interrupted her.

00:46:52.180 --> 00:46:53.880
And her parents never
listened to her.

00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:56.100
They listened to him.

00:46:56.100 --> 00:46:59.510
So she started to get this
idea in her system.

00:46:59.510 --> 00:47:01.320
What I have to say
is not important.

00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:02.570
But guess what she does?

00:47:02.570 --> 00:47:05.510
I call it "self-fulfilling
prophecies."

00:47:05.510 --> 00:47:07.470
You're sitting with
her for an hour.

00:47:07.470 --> 00:47:08.780
She doesn't say much.

00:47:08.780 --> 00:47:09.970
We're just talking.

00:47:09.970 --> 00:47:11.260
But then, you go to--

00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:13.140
the curtain opens
for the movie.

00:47:13.140 --> 00:47:15.600
And she says, hey, let me
tell you about my day.

00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:16.310
Oh, not right now.

00:47:16.310 --> 00:47:18.820
See, nobody thinks
I'm important.

00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:24.170
She consistently sets up
situations to reinforce that

00:47:24.170 --> 00:47:26.750
because it's in her brain
and in her body.

00:47:26.750 --> 00:47:27.600
Does that make sense?

00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:29.610
Am I getting across?

00:47:29.610 --> 00:47:34.190
Every time she enters to do
something, as a leader or as a

00:47:34.190 --> 00:47:40.320
manager, somehow, she'll
unconsciously say it at the

00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:40.970
wrong time.

00:47:40.970 --> 00:47:43.460
So somebody says, oh, god, we
only have one minute left.

00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:45.070
And she'll go, darn, nobody
wants to hear

00:47:45.070 --> 00:47:46.260
what I have to say.

00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:49.390
So I had her really look at that
and change that behavior

00:47:49.390 --> 00:47:53.260
because it was a neuro net in
her brain that was fixed that

00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:54.410
kept setting it up.

00:47:54.410 --> 00:47:57.230
That's why we-- sometimes you'll
say, I can't believe

00:47:57.230 --> 00:47:59.730
that person's in the third
relationship that's abusive.

00:47:59.730 --> 00:48:01.990
Why do they keep repeating it?

00:48:01.990 --> 00:48:05.210
Because the first time it
happened, and the second

00:48:05.210 --> 00:48:08.310
time-- and then, it starts to
become a pattern and a habit

00:48:08.310 --> 00:48:09.560
that we believe in.

00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:13.530
So my message, really, today is
that each one of us, as we

00:48:13.530 --> 00:48:16.400
go through this rebooting
exercise, if you do this twice

00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:18.560

to keep you really strong--

00:48:25.720 --> 00:48:27.950
Have you ever heard of it?

00:48:27.950 --> 00:48:29.950
They had this setup.

00:48:29.950 --> 00:48:32.100
And I give you this to encourage
and inspire you

00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:33.250
because it's changed my life.

00:48:33.250 --> 00:48:36.770
They had a setup where you put
your hands in this machine.

00:48:36.770 --> 00:48:40.620
And it tells you how much oxygen
you have in your body.

00:48:40.620 --> 00:48:44.340
So of course, most people
were 40%, 43%, 28%.

00:48:44.340 --> 00:48:48.140
And that's why they have cold
hands, cold feet, and they're

00:48:48.140 --> 00:48:49.170
tired a lot--

00:48:49.170 --> 00:48:50.770
not enough oxygen.

00:48:50.770 --> 00:48:52.520
I was at 98%.

00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:55.140
Now, why am I at 98%?

00:48:55.140 --> 00:48:56.430

down my digestion, and

speed me up, and tire me out.

00:49:20.060 --> 00:49:22.670
And am I taking enough
deep breaths?

00:49:22.670 --> 00:49:24.740
Am I aware of my
breathing, OK?

00:49:24.740 --> 00:49:27.190
So looking at this exercise I
want to send you home with, I

00:49:27.190 --> 00:49:29.320
want to encourage you
to just try this.

00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:32.340
I did it before I started
talking to you today.

00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:34.970
I do it any time I have a
presentation, I get on the

00:49:34.970 --> 00:49:37.445
phone, just a good warmup.

00:49:37.445 --> 00:49:39.500
And basically, the first
step is for you to

00:49:39.500 --> 00:49:40.640
observe your breath.

00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:43.370
So right at your desk, you can
take five minutes and just

00:49:43.370 --> 00:49:44.590
notice, am I breathing?

00:49:44.590 --> 00:49:46.500
Am I breathing full?

00:49:46.500 --> 00:49:47.890
What's happening with me?

00:49:47.890 --> 00:49:51.774
Secondly, you can
scan your body.

00:49:51.774 --> 00:49:54.500
And you can notice-- and it's
important to say out loud,

00:49:54.500 --> 00:49:57.280
like, wow, I'm noticing my
shoulders are up to my ears.

00:49:57.280 --> 00:50:00.660
And just kind of drop your
shoulders and shake it out.

00:50:00.660 --> 00:50:04.540
And then, just really take it
into breathing and scanning

00:50:04.540 --> 00:50:07.010
your body at least once
or twice a day.

00:50:07.010 --> 00:50:10.240
And then, coming back to, what
action do I need to take?

00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:11.235
I might need to go outside.

00:50:11.235 --> 00:50:13.930
I might need to make
that phone call.

00:50:13.930 --> 00:50:16.130
I might need to shake it out of
my body because it can be

00:50:16.130 --> 00:50:18.300
there all day if you don't.

00:50:18.300 --> 00:50:22.610
And then, start to visualize
a calm ocean rhythm.

00:50:22.610 --> 00:50:25.600
That's what happened in the
testing I showed you before

00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:27.650
that the heart was beating
like this.

00:50:27.650 --> 00:50:29.460
This is what's happening
with your heart.

00:50:29.460 --> 00:50:34.010
But when you visualize your
heart like a wave, just to do

00:50:34.010 --> 00:50:36.940
that starts to calm everything
down and put you back into

00:50:36.940 --> 00:50:37.640
place of neutral.

00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:40.600
Just like your computer,
you're rebooting.

00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:43.735
And then, focus on what your
next intention is for the day.

00:50:43.735 --> 00:50:45.880
And just focus on
that one thing.

00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:46.960
Buddha taught--

00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:49.870
here's what Buddha's teachings
were that I studied.

00:50:49.870 --> 00:50:52.210
First thing is connect
with your breath.

00:50:52.210 --> 00:50:54.280
Second thing is scan
your body and

00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:55.740
notice what you're feeling.

00:50:55.740 --> 00:50:57.980
And the third thing is to have
one focus, whether it's a

00:50:57.980 --> 00:50:59.830
candle or a mantra.

00:50:59.830 --> 00:51:03.160
This is the same thing, that
once or twice a day you can

00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:05.330
reboot and re-energize.

00:51:05.330 --> 00:51:07.290
So does anybody want
to comment on that?

00:51:07.290 --> 00:51:09.710
How do you feel just thinking
about it, taking

00:51:09.710 --> 00:51:11.510
it into your life?

00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:14.150
And then, we'll have questions
and answers around that.

00:51:14.150 --> 00:51:17.190
Anybody want to comment on
anything you learned today, or

00:51:17.190 --> 00:51:19.410
noticing about your body
awareness or yourself?

00:51:19.410 --> 00:51:19.950
Yeah, please.

00:51:19.950 --> 00:51:20.380
RACHEL: You need a mic.

00:51:20.380 --> 00:51:22.640
Hold on.

00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:23.470
STEVE SISGOLD: Thank you.

00:51:23.470 --> 00:51:25.380
AUDIENCE: Are there any good
tricks in terms of making sure

00:51:25.380 --> 00:51:26.310
it becomes a regular thing?

00:51:26.310 --> 00:51:28.270
I know there are some computer
programs that'll interrupt

00:51:28.270 --> 00:51:30.100
your day, morning and afternoon,
to stretch.

00:51:30.100 --> 00:51:31.510
But is there something similar
to remind you to

00:51:31.510 --> 00:51:33.430
just kind of reboot?

00:51:33.430 --> 00:51:35.090
STEVE SISGOLD: Well, I'm glad
you're saying that because I'm

00:51:35.090 --> 00:51:38.030
actually working on an app
that's going to remind you

00:51:38.030 --> 00:51:40.070
twice a day to reboot.

00:51:40.070 --> 00:51:41.910
I don't know of anything
like that.

00:51:41.910 --> 00:51:42.360
But you know, what--

00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:43.690
AUDIENCE: I mean, I could set
a reminder on my phone.

00:51:43.690 --> 00:51:45.270
STEVE SISGOLD: I was going to
say, the little iPhones are

00:51:45.270 --> 00:51:48.050
great because they remind
us of appointments.

00:51:48.050 --> 00:51:52.600
So I used to put those kind of
appointments in my book.

00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:53.950
Reboot.

00:51:53.950 --> 00:51:55.710
Take an hour to write
your book.

00:51:55.710 --> 00:51:57.880
So I would say that's
a great question.

00:51:57.880 --> 00:52:01.590
And also, when I work with
companies, I'll have signs,

00:52:01.590 --> 00:52:05.500
"Reboot." I just trained
an office in Las Vegas.

00:52:05.500 --> 00:52:07.900
And all through the office now,
we have "Reboot," "Take a

00:52:07.900 --> 00:52:12.960
Breath," "Say Positive Things to
Your Body." And it changes

00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:14.950
the energy of the culture.

00:52:14.950 --> 00:52:17.030
The whole room starts
to be more vibrant.

00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:18.435
So thank you for-- that's
a great question.

00:52:18.435 --> 00:52:19.100
AUDIENCE: One more question.

00:52:19.100 --> 00:52:19.980
STEVE SISGOLD: Yeah, please.

00:52:19.980 --> 00:52:21.880
AUDIENCE: When you sort of say
these positive things to

00:52:21.880 --> 00:52:23.640
yourself, does it matter if
you say them out loud?

00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:24.880
Or can you say them
internally?

00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:26.660
Or is there a difference between
the impacts there?

00:52:26.660 --> 00:52:27.190
STEVE SISGOLD: That's great.

00:52:27.190 --> 00:52:29.490
The question is, is the impact
different if you say it out

00:52:29.490 --> 00:52:30.540
loud or inside?

00:52:30.540 --> 00:52:32.060
Now, here's a couple
things on that.

00:52:32.060 --> 00:52:32.870
Great question.

00:52:32.870 --> 00:52:35.290
Number one is saying
those to myself,

00:52:35.290 --> 00:52:37.180
inside, I noticed a change.

00:52:37.180 --> 00:52:38.990
And I noticed an energy
difference.

00:52:38.990 --> 00:52:42.020
So obviously, the more
we feed ourselves--

00:52:42.020 --> 00:52:43.810
a lot of people saw "The
Secret." And they wondered,

00:52:43.810 --> 00:52:45.020
well, I sit.

00:52:45.020 --> 00:52:46.700
And I thought I was going to
get that Porsche because I

00:52:46.700 --> 00:52:48.370
thought about it all day long.

00:52:48.370 --> 00:52:49.710
And it didn't show up.

00:52:49.710 --> 00:52:51.470
So it's good to think
positive thinking.

00:52:51.470 --> 00:52:53.390
But I think to take
it into the body--

00:52:53.390 --> 00:52:55.340
and that's why I say it
out loud when I can.

00:52:55.340 --> 00:52:58.440
Like, ah, out loud,
I'm hearing it.

00:52:58.440 --> 00:53:00.910
There's something that happens
in the brain through the ear.

00:53:00.910 --> 00:53:03.200
And also, though, just the
vibration of saying it out

00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:06.620
loud starts to move more energy
through the body, which

00:53:06.620 --> 00:53:08.340
is why I had you do it
with each other.

00:53:08.340 --> 00:53:11.120
Practicing saying it out loud
in front of somebody would

00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:12.430
even bring more energy.

00:53:12.430 --> 00:53:13.320
But thank you.

00:53:13.320 --> 00:53:16.490
The positiveness is the idea
of not just saying

00:53:16.490 --> 00:53:17.610
it, because I think--

00:53:17.610 --> 00:53:19.650
I worked with a woman, Shakti
Gawain, "Creative

00:53:19.650 --> 00:53:22.170
Visualizations." And she always
said, people thought

00:53:22.170 --> 00:53:24.290
they could just read my book
and think about it, and it

00:53:24.290 --> 00:53:25.240
would happen.

00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:26.490
It's taking action.

00:53:26.490 --> 00:53:28.450
And that's why I bring
the body into it.

00:53:28.450 --> 00:53:31.610
What am I my noticing when I say
I want to create that new

00:53:31.610 --> 00:53:33.110
idea in the office?

00:53:33.110 --> 00:53:35.730
What am I noticing when I want
to go talk to my project

00:53:35.730 --> 00:53:39.010
manager about something
that's off?

00:53:39.010 --> 00:53:40.180
What am I my noticing here?

00:53:40.180 --> 00:53:40.920
[BREATHES IN DEEPLY]

00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:42.580
STEVE SISGOLD: Once we get that,
I think, then we can

00:53:42.580 --> 00:53:44.750
walk in the room and attract
what we want and

00:53:44.750 --> 00:53:45.950
exude what we want.

00:53:45.950 --> 00:53:47.470
It makes a huge difference.

00:53:47.470 --> 00:53:49.050
So thank you, great question.

00:53:49.050 --> 00:53:50.765
A couple more questions.

00:53:50.765 --> 00:53:52.340
RACHEL: We have time for
one more question.

00:53:52.340 --> 00:53:54.820
STEVE SISGOLD: OK, thank you.

00:53:54.820 --> 00:53:56.890
Anybody else have a question
before we wrap?

00:53:59.730 --> 00:54:00.585
I really want to
thank you all.

00:54:00.585 --> 00:54:01.645
AUDIENCE: Can you guys hear?

00:54:01.645 --> 00:54:04.200
Can you guys hear
from the remote?

00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:05.225
RACHEL: Yes.

00:54:05.225 --> 00:54:06.530
AUDIENCE: I thought I'd just--

00:54:06.530 --> 00:54:09.900
I was just going to say, one,
there are related topics you

00:54:09.900 --> 00:54:11.330
can study that teach
all this stuff.

00:54:11.330 --> 00:54:12.690
One of them is tai chi.

00:54:12.690 --> 00:54:14.240
Another one is singing.

00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:15.500
Another one is dancing.

00:54:15.500 --> 00:54:18.135
All of those have to do with
posture, and breathing, and

00:54:18.135 --> 00:54:18.550
all of that.

00:54:18.550 --> 00:54:20.350
And they'll help you
remember it.

00:54:20.350 --> 00:54:21.650
STEVE SISGOLD: Thank
you-- qigong.

00:54:21.650 --> 00:54:23.040
Any of it's good.

00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:26.450
My main message today, really,
is just to leave here more

00:54:26.450 --> 00:54:29.690
aware of, am I breathing?

00:54:29.690 --> 00:54:32.160
Do I make decisions quickly
from my head?

00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:33.970
Or am I going to take
a moment and listen?

00:54:33.970 --> 00:54:37.420
And what would happen if I took
twice a day and took five

00:54:37.420 --> 00:54:42.540
minutes to breathe, scan, shake
out that tension, set a

00:54:42.540 --> 00:54:45.350
new intention, and then
walk in the meeting or

00:54:45.350 --> 00:54:46.750
the room like that?

00:54:46.750 --> 00:54:49.220
My experience is that you're
going to have a better result,

00:54:49.220 --> 00:54:51.470
that you're going to attract and
get a better result from

00:54:51.470 --> 00:54:52.000
what you need.

00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:55.200
So thank you, Rachel, so much
for bringing me here today.

00:54:55.200 --> 00:54:56.110
And thank you all.

00:54:56.110 --> 00:54:58.140
You're welcome to email
me with questions

00:54:58.140 --> 00:54:59.660
from my book or anything.

00:54:59.660 --> 00:55:00.730
I'll be glad to answer them.

00:55:00.730 --> 00:55:01.980
Thank you.
