00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.270
Hey there, intrepid
iOS developers.

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:14.030
And welcome to this quick
tip episode of Route 85.

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:15.079
So check this out.

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:16.870
What you're looking at
here is a little app

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:19.078
that I wrote that lets me
configure this secret robot

00:00:19.078 --> 00:00:20.130
army I've been building.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.240
It's a side project.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.274
Don't tell my manager.

00:00:22.274 --> 00:00:23.690
Now, you can see
by the storyboard

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:24.980
here that it goes
several layers deep

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.640
as I select my
robot's personality,

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.337
mode of transportation,
and weaponry.

00:00:28.337 --> 00:00:29.920
And then we get to
the end, and, well,

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.128
I've got to back up a bunch
of times in my navigation

00:00:32.128 --> 00:00:33.860
controller to get
back to my main menu.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.244
It's kind of awkward.

00:00:35.244 --> 00:00:37.160
So there are a few ways
we could address this.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.415
One way is by using code.

00:00:38.415 --> 00:00:40.540
When I finally select my
weapon in the last screen,

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.080
I could add in a
little code like this,

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.163
and everything would work.

00:00:43.163 --> 00:00:44.610
I jump back to the main menu.

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:45.870
But not always.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.590
In a simple example
like this, sure.

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.180
I know exactly what order my
view controllers will be in.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.020
But that won't
always be the case.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.660
What do I do in a
situation like this,

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.700
where I want to jump to
this controller here?

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.660
Well, sometimes,
it'll be at index 1,

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.652
and, other times,
it'll be at index 2.

00:00:59.652 --> 00:01:01.860
So now my code would have
to search through the stack

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.369
until I can find the one I
want and then pop to that one.

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:06.160
It's an awful lot of
code just to jump back

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.750
to a view controller.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:07.249
Isn't it?

00:01:07.249 --> 00:01:08.476
Yeah.

00:01:08.476 --> 00:01:10.100
Not to mention that
now, by using code,

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.690
I've introduced
some inconsistency

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.490
in our navigation logic, right?

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.380
Some of our navigation
follows segues that

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:16.830
are built into our storyboard.

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.680
But some of it now
relies purely on code

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.530
that has no corresponding
entry in Interface Builder.

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.720
If another developer were
working on our project,

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:24.615
they'd have to
start looking around

00:01:24.615 --> 00:01:27.250
in, like, all of our files to
see what additional navigation

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.470
logic we've added instead
of being able to rely

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:30.940
on one consistent system.

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:31.870
And we're engineers.

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:33.900
We like consistency.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.220
So the other option is
to keep using segues.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.720
Now, you might initially think
of doing something like this,

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.790
adding a segue that goes from
our final view controller

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:41.920
back to our first one.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.140
But that would be a bad thing.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.740
See, by doing so,
I wouldn't actually

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.870
be jumping back to the
first view controller.

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.480
My iOS app would create
a new main menu view

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.100
controller to put on top
of my navigation stack.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.670
And I would end up
with a giant pile

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.160
of view controllers like this.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.840
Yeah, that's not
really what I want.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.930
So a better solution here is
to create an unwind segue.

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.860
This is a segue you
define in your storyboard.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.612
And it basically does
what it sounds like.

00:02:05.612 --> 00:02:07.070
It tells your
navigation controller

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.091
to unwind through all
of its view controllers

00:02:09.091 --> 00:02:11.090
until it gets back to the
target view controller

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.840
that you have specified.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.070
Now, creating an unwind
segue is similar to creating

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.630
a normal segue, except that
instead of Control-Dragging

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.260
to the target view
controller, you

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.780
Control-Drag to your view
controller's exit object.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.890
It's this little icon
here in your storyboard

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.874
that you've probably
been ignoring.

00:02:25.874 --> 00:02:28.540
For example, let's say I want to
make this Cancel button go back

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:29.770
to my main menu.

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.720
To do so, I'll just drag
from my Cancel button

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.280
to this little Exit icon here
in my outline, and, let's

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.750
try that again.

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:36.450
Oh.

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.950
Oh yeah.

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.340
That's right.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.230
OK, so this is the thing that
confused me with unwind segues.

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.360
To use one, you first have to go
to your target view controller,

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.260
the one you're
going to unwind to,

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.759
and add a blank
ID action method.

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:50.300
In this example,
I'll create a method

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.494
called unwind to main menu in
my main menu view controller.

00:02:53.494 --> 00:02:54.910
And you'll notice
that I'm passing

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.437
in a UI storyboard
segue as an argument.

00:02:57.437 --> 00:02:59.520
Now you have to do this,
or else Interface Builder

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.240
won't know that this
is a destination

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.620
for your unwind segues.

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.610
It also comes in handy
later, as you'll soon see.

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.440
So once I have that
in my view controller,

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.240
I can go back to
Interface Builder,

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.234
Control-Drag from my
button to this Exit icon

00:03:11.234 --> 00:03:13.400
here in my view controller,
select the method I just

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.260
created-- here it
is-- and, voila,

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.490
I've created an unwind segue.

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:19.522
Now, when I click this
Cancel button in my app,

00:03:19.522 --> 00:03:21.980
it will jump back to the view
controller that contains this

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.580
unwind to main menu method.

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.830
And I don't have to worry
about where in the hierarchy

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.650
it's located, which is nice.

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.810
And now I can use it just
like any other segue.

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.720
So let's revisit our
original problem.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.320
To go back to the main menu from
my last view controller here,

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.420
I can Control-Drag from
that view controller

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.856
to my exit point to
create the segue.

00:03:38.856 --> 00:03:40.480
Then I'll give it an
identifier, like I

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.900
would with any other segue.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.110
And then I can call perform
segue with identifier

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:46.950
to get back to the main menu.

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.870
Let's see it all in action.

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.120
OK, here it goes.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.850
Going, going, oh, much better.

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:56.190
It gets me the logic I wanted.

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.480
And I'm insulated from
major storyboard changes.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.220
And I get to keep
all my navigation

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.340
logic nice and consistent.

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.040
Oh, and, as an added bonus,
if I need this first view

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.650
controller to grab any
information from that last one,

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.660
I have a chance to do that in
my unwind to main menu method.

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.830
It's kind of the opposite
of a traditional prepare

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:13.910
for segue method.

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.390
In this case, I can query the
previous view controller--

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:18.380
this last one here--
before it's disappeared

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.070
from the navigation stack, which
can be very useful sometimes.

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:23.620
So this quick tip
was shared with me

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.202
by our very own Gus Class.

00:04:25.202 --> 00:04:27.410
He writes a number of our
sample mobile applications,

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.660
both on iOS and
Android, that you can

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.250
find in our GitHub repository.

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.910
He also dj'd at Burning
Man with a laser light

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.730
show that he built
himself, which

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:38.631
is way cooler than anything
I've ever done in my entire life

00:04:38.631 --> 00:04:39.130
ever.

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.289
So you win, Gus.

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:42.080
But what about you?

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.040
Do have a quick tip?

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.190
Do you wear clothing?

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.742
Well, then have I
got a deal for you?

00:04:45.742 --> 00:04:47.950
Send me a quick tip, and if
we publish it on the air,

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:49.240
I will send you a T-shirt.

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.895
What a bargain!

00:04:49.895 --> 00:04:51.770
And as for the rest of
you who, I don't know,

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.520
I guess don't wear
clothes, I'll still

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.466
see you soon on "Route 85."
