other end is a place you can go out so
 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:53.730
other end is a place you can go out so
you imagine a tunnel that goes into

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740
you imagine a tunnel that goes into
 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.400
you imagine a tunnel that goes into
there and comes out of there

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:58.410
 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.109
and you might say well it would take me

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119
and you might say well it would take me
 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:03.120
and you might say well it would take me

just took the direct route through
 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.300
just took the direct route through
ordinary space but the point is that

imagine picking up this piece of paper

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540
imagine picking up this piece of paper
 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.540
imagine picking up this piece of paper
and curling these two regions so that

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550
and curling these two regions so that
 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.970
and curling these two regions so that
they're close to each other

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980
they're close to each other
 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.410
they're close to each other
then you go into that end of the

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420
then you go into that end of the
 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.900
then you go into that end of the
wormhole you come outside the other end

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910
wormhole you come outside the other end
 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.030
wormhole you come outside the other end
and there's a shortcut in between them

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040
and there's a shortcut in between them
 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.990
and there's a shortcut in between them
in which the distance is not that much

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000
in which the distance is not that much
 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.790
in which the distance is not that much
so the wormhole provides a way that you

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800
so the wormhole provides a way that you
 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.470
so the wormhole provides a way that you
can travel what appears to be a very

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480
can travel what appears to be a very
 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.839
can travel what appears to be a very
long distance in a very short period of

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:37.849
long distance in a very short period of
 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:40.180
long distance in a very short period of
time and it's for that reason that

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190
time and it's for that reason that
 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.759
time and it's for that reason that
wormholes have found a special place in

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769
wormholes have found a special place in
 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:44.949
wormholes have found a special place in
science fiction if you want to write a

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:46.900
science fiction if you want to write a
science fiction novel you might want to

science fiction novel you might want to
 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.520
science fiction novel you might want to
be able to get across the galaxy very

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530
be able to get across the galaxy very
 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:49.839
be able to get across the galaxy very
quickly and you don't want to be limited

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:49.849
quickly and you don't want to be limited
 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:52.240
quickly and you don't want to be limited
by the speed of light so a wormhole can

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250
by the speed of light so a wormhole can
 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.400
by the speed of light so a wormhole can
be a shortcut it can be a way to get

be a shortcut it can be a way to get
around all the space that you have to

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420
around all the space that you have to
 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.720
around all the space that you have to
travel through if you believe that the

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730
travel through if you believe that the
 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.490
travel through if you believe that the
speed of light really is a speed limit

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500
speed of light really is a speed limit
 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:01.780
speed of light really is a speed limit
you can't go faster than the speed of

you can't go faster than the speed of
 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.360
you can't go faster than the speed of
light the wormhole provides you away

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370
light the wormhole provides you away
 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.930
light the wormhole provides you away
maybe to still go slower than the speed

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940
maybe to still go slower than the speed
 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.820
maybe to still go slower than the speed
of light but get to where you want to go

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830
of light but get to where you want to go
 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.920
of light but get to where you want to go
much faster because the distance is much

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930
much faster because the distance is much
 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.690
much faster because the distance is much
shorter it's really just a shortcut

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700
shorter it's really just a shortcut
 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.449
shorter it's really just a shortcut
through space itself a wormhole might

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459
through space itself a wormhole might
 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.509
through space itself a wormhole might
also empty into another time that's

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519
also empty into another time that's
 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:21.580
also empty into another time that's
because wormholes are portals through

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590
because wormholes are portals through
 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.280
because wormholes are portals through
the fabric of space and time while they

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290
the fabric of space and time while they
 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:25.750
the fabric of space and time while they
could theoretically link different

could theoretically link different
 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.210
could theoretically link different
locations in space they could also

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220
locations in space they could also
 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.520
locations in space they could also
theoretically link up different

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530
theoretically link up different
 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.580
theoretically link up different
locations in time because space and time

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590
locations in time because space and time
 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.800
locations in time because space and time
are mixed up together you could actually

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810
are mixed up together you could actually
 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.259
are mixed up together you could actually
not only end up in a different part of

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269
not only end up in a different part of
 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:40.360
not only end up in a different part of
space by going through the wormhole but

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370
space by going through the wormhole but
 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.430
space by going through the wormhole but
you could also end up in the past you

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440
you could also end up in the past you

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:46.539
could end up in a different part of time
you could go into your own past then

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549
you could go into your own past then
 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:48.430
you could go into your own past then
come visit yourself before you entered

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440
come visit yourself before you entered
 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.280
come visit yourself before you entered
the beginning of the wormhole so you

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290
the beginning of the wormhole so you
 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.080
the beginning of the wormhole so you
could have a wormhole it goes from your

could have a wormhole it goes from your
 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.110
could have a wormhole it goes from your
living room to your dining room they

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.750
living room to your dining room they
might be five years apart so you enter

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760
might be five years apart so you enter
