00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.520
PROFESSOR: To begin today I want
to remind you, I need to

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.720
write it down on the board
at least twice, of the

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.230
fundamental theorem
of calculus.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.870
We called it FTC 1 because it's
the first version of the

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:39.620
fundamental theorem.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.150
We'll be talking about another
version, called the second

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.940
version, today.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:58.010
And what it says is this: If F'
= f, then the integral from

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:06.410
a to b of f (x) dx =
F ( b) - F ( a).

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:10.750
So that's the fundamental
theorem of calculus.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:17.820
And the way we used it last
time was, this was used to

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.090
evaluate integrals.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:28.110
Not surprisingly, that's
how we used it.

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:35.670
But today, I want to reverse
that point of view.

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.190
We're going to read the equation
backwards, and we're

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:49.240
going to write it this way.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:02:01.110
And we're going to use f to
understand capital F. Or in

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.370
other words, the derivative.

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.700
To understand the function.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.290
So that's the reversal
of point of view

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.380
that I'd like to make.

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.310
And we'll make this point
in various ways.

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:36.460
So information about F, about
F', gives us information about

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.770
F. Now, since there were
questions about the mean value

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.040
theorem, I'm going to illustrate
this first by

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.630
making a comparison between
the fundamental theorem of

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.600
calculus and the mean
value theorem.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.540
So we're going to compare this
fundamental theorem of

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:01.550
calculus with what we call
the mean value theorem.

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:02.980
And in order to do that,
I'm going to

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.070
introduce a couple of notations.

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:11.820
I'll write delta F as
F ( b ) - F ( a).

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:17.770
And another highly imaginative
notation, delta x = b - a.

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.760
So here's the change in f,
there's the change in x.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:27.420
And then, this fundamental
theorem can be written, of

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.800
course, right up above
there is the formula.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:38.110
And it's the formula for delta
F. So this is what we call the

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:44.090
fundamental theorem
of calculus.

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:51.810
I'm going to divide
by delta x, now.

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.690
And If I divide by delta x,
that's the same thing as 1 / b

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:02.880
- a times the integral from
a to b of f ( x) dx.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.110
So I've just rewritten
the formula here.

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:11.960
And this expression here, on
the right-hand side, is a

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.650
fairly important one.

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:23.370
This is the average of f.

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:29.490
That's the average value of f.

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.610
Now, so this is going to
permit me to make the

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.110
comparison between the mean
value theorem, which we don't

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.630
have stated yet here.

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.010
And the fundamental theorem.

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:49.130
And I'll do it in the form
of inequalities.

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.550
So right in the middle here,
I'm going to put the

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:52.370
fundamental theorem.

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:57.070
It says that delta F in this
notation is equal to, well if

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.650
I multiply by delta x again, I
can write it as the average of

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.870
F. So I'm going to write it
as the average of F' here.

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.100
Times delta x.

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.790
So we have this factor here,
which is the average of F', or

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:13.810
the average of little f,
it's the same thing.

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:15.430
And then I multiplied
through again.

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:20.810
So I put the thing
in the red box.

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:29.970
Here.

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:37.190
Isn't what the average
of big F.

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:41.370
So the question is, why is this
the average of little f

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:47.030
rather than the average of big
F. So the average of a

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.130
function is the typical value.

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:56.520
If, for example, little f were
constant, little f were

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:01.260
constant, then this integral
would be, so the question is

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.920
why is this the average.

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:08.970
And I'll take a little second
to explain that.

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:13.050
But I think I'll explain
it over here.

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:19.010
Because I'm going to erase it.

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:27.270
So the idea of an average
is the following.

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:32.281
For example, imagine that
a = 0 and b = n,

00:06:32.281 --> 00:06:33.600
let's say for example.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:46.850
And so we might sum the
function from 1 to n.

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:49.520
Now, that would be the sum of
the values from 1 to n.

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:54.960
But the average is, we
divide by n here.

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.140
So this is the average.

00:06:56.140 --> 00:07:01.760
And this is a kind of Riemann
sum, representing the integral

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:06.290
from 0 to n, of f (x) dx.

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:10.700
Where the increment,
delta x, is 1.

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:13.470
So this is the notion of
an average value here.

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:15.840
But in the continuum setting
as opposed to

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:20.570
the discrete setting.

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:24.870
Whereas what's on the
left-hand side is

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:26.840
the change in f.

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:31.790
The capital F. And this is the
average of the little f.

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:33.860
So an average is a sum.

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:39.520
And it's like an integral.

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:42.720
So, in other words what I have
here is that the change in f

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.250
is the average of its
infinitesimal change times the

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:50.000
amount of time elapsed,
if you like.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:56.100
So this is the statement of
the fundamental theorem.

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:56.960
Just rewritten.

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:58.450
Exactly what I wrote there.

00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:01.780
But I multiplied back
by delta x.

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:07.530
Now, let me compare this with
the mean value theorem.

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:13.590
The mean values theorem
also is an equation.

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:16.420
The mean value theorem says
that this is equal to

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:21.560
F' (c) delta x.

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:23.270
Now, I pulled a fast
one on you.

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:26.560
I used capital F's here to
make the analogy clear.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:30.800
But the role of the letter
is important to make the

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.200
transition to this comparison.

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:35.010
We're talking about the function
capital F here.

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:36.620
And its derivative.

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:38.510
Now, this is true.

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:42.510
So now I claim that this thing
is fairly specific.

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:47.750
Whereas this, unfortunately,
is a little bit vague.

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:51.360
And the reason why it's vague is
that c is just somewhere in

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:52.790
the interval.

00:08:52.790 --> 00:09:01.010
So some c - sorry, this is some
c, in between a and b.

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:04.930
So really, since we don't know
where this thing is, we don't

00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:07.690
know which of the values it is,
we can't say what it is.

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:12.410
All we can do is say well for
sure it's less than the

00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:13.280
largest value.

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:18.090
Say, (the maximum
of F' ) delta x.

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:21.010
And the only thing we can say
for sure on the other end is

00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:24.410
that it's less than or equal to
- sorry, it's greater than

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:27.410
or equal to, (the minimum
of F' ) delta x.

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:29.090
Over that same interval.

00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:39.650
This is over 0 less than
- sorry, a &lt; x &lt; b.

00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:42.110
So that means that the
fundamental theorem of

00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:45.950
calculus is a much more
specific thing.

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:48.460
And indeed it gives the
same conclusion.

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:50.230
It's much stronger than the
mean value theorem.

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:52.330
It's way better than the
mean value theorem.

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:56.410
In fact, as soon as we have
integrals, we can abandon the

00:09:56.410 --> 00:09:57.280
mean value theorem.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:58.550
We don't want it.

00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:00.810
It's too simple-minded.

00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:03.860
And what we have is something
much more sophisticated, which

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:04.940
we can use.

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:05.760
Which is this.

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:08.940
So it's obvious that if this is
the average, the average is

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:09.960
less than the maximum.

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:15.190
So it's obvious that it works
just as well to draw this

00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:15.950
conclusion.

00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:20.010
And similarly over here
with the minimum.

00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:22.910
OK, the average is always bigger
than the minimum and

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:25.430
smaller than the max.

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:28.680
So this is the connection,
if you like.

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:32.660
And I'm going to elaborate
just one step further by

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:36.340
talking about the problem that
you had on the exam.

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:39.640
So there was an Exam
2 problem.

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:43.590
And I'll show you how it works
using the mean value theorem

00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:45.610
and how it works using
integrals.

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:48.880
But I'm going to have to use
this notation capital F. So

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:52.450
capital F', as opposed to the
little f, which was what was

00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:55.270
the notation that was
on your exam.

00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:57.620
So we had this situation here.

00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:01.380
These were the givens
of the problem.

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:11.870
And then the question was, the
mean value theorem says, or

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:14.160
implies, if you like,
it doesn't say it,

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:20.110
but it implies it.

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:38.690
Implies a &lt; capital F ( 4)
&lt; b, for which a and b?

00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:43.330
So let's take a look
at what it says.

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:53.620
Well, the mean value theorem
says that F( 4) - F (0) = F' (

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:57.240
c)( 4 - 0).

00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:03.770
This is this (F') delta x,
this is the change in x.

00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:12.750
And that's the same thing
as (1 / 1 + c )( 4).

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:21.060
And so the range of values of
this number here is from (1 /

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:24.630
1 plus 0)( 4), that's 4.

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:28.000
To, that's the largest value, to
the smallest that it gets,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.510
which is (1 / 1 + 4)( 4).

00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:41.020
That's the range.

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:53.780
And so the conclusion is that
F (4) - f ( 0 ) is between,

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:55.090
well, let's see.

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:59.040
It's between 4 and 4/5.

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:01.850
Which are those two numbers
down there.

00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:04.680
And if you remember that F ( 0)
was 1, this is the same as

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:15.680
F ( 4), is between 5 and 9/5.

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:19.740
So that's the way that you were
supposed to solve the

00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:22.570
problem on the exam.

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:26.490
On the other hand, let's compare
to what you would do

00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:31.140
with the fundamental theorem
of calculus.

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:33.680
With the fundamentals theorem
of calculus, we have the

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:34.900
following formula.

00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:46.100
F( 4) - F ( 0) = the integral
from 0 to 4 of dx / 1 + x.

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:52.700
That's what the fundamental
theorem says.

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:56.920
And now I claim that we can
get these same types of

00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:00.780
results by a very elementary
observation.

00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:02.820
It's really the same observation
that I made up

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:06.110
here, that the average is less
than or equal to the maximum.

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:11.810
Which is that the biggest this
can ever be is, let's see.

00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:15.280
The biggest it is when
x is 0, that's 1.

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:20.360
So the biggest it ever
gets is this.

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:25.110
And that's equal to 4.

00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:25.660
Right?

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:30.910
On the other hand, the smallest
it ever gets to be,

00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:36.770
it's equal to this.

00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:39.800
The smallest it ever gets to
be is the integral from

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:42.400
0 to 4 of 1/5 dx.

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:44.220
Because that's the
lowest value that

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:46.110
the integrand takes.

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:48.390
When x = 4, it's 1/5.

00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:54.270
And that's equal to 4/5.

00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:57.720
Now, there's a little tiny
detail which is that really we

00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:00.390
know that this is the area of
some rectangle and this is

00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:01.560
strictly smaller.

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:03.520
And we know that these
inequalities

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:05.210
are actually strict.

00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:07.620
But that's a minor point.

00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:12.270
And certainly not one that we'll
pay close attention to.

00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:17.910
But now, let me show you what
this looks like geometrically.

00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:19.700
So geometrically, we interpret
this as the

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:22.270
area under a curve.

00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:31.850
Here's a piece of the
curve y = 1/1 + x.

00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:37.130
And it's going up to 4 and
starting at 0 here.

00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:42.570
And the first estimate that we
made; that is, the upper

00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:53.200
bound, was by trapping this in
this big rectangle here.

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:56.640
We compared it to the constant
function, which was 1 all the

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:57.990
way across.

00:15:57.990 --> 00:16:00.300
This is y = 1.

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:06.060
And then we also trapped it
from underneath by the

00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:08.600
function which was
at the bottom.

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:14.430
And this was y = 1/5.

00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:19.980
And so what this really is is,
these things are the simplest

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:21.060
possible Riemann sum.

00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:22.860
Sort of a silly Riemann sum.

00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:34.390
This is a Riemann sum
with one rectangle.

00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:36.420
This is the simplest
possible one.

00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:38.580
And so this is a very,
very crude estimate.

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:40.970
You can see it misses
by a mile.

00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:43.180
The larger and the smaller
values are off

00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:46.370
by a factor of 5.

00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:49.480
But this one is called
the, this one is the

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:53.390
lower Riemann sum.

00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:59.560
And that one is less than
our actual integral.

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:14.100
Which is less than the
upper Riemann sum.

00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:18.740
And you should, by now, have
looked at those upper and

00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:20.670
lower sums on your homework.

00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:22.630
So it's just the rectangles
underneath and the

00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:25.390
rectangles on top.

00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:28.150
So at this point, we can
literally abandon the mean

00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:28.730
value theorem.

00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:30.930
Because we have a much better
way of getting at things.

00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:33.330
If we chop things up into more
rectangles, we'll get much

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:35.550
better numerical
approximations.

00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:38.640
And if we use simpleminded
expressions with integrals,

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:40.940
we'll be able to figure out any
bound we could get using

00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:42.610
the mean value theorem.

00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:45.790
So that's not the relevance
of the mean value theorem.

00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:49.070
I'll explain to you why we
talked about it, even, in a

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:51.310
few minutes.

00:17:51.310 --> 00:18:00.040
OK, are there any questions
before we go on?

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:00.290
Yeah.

00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:07.000
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.910
PROFESSOR: I knew that the range
of c was from 0 to 4, I

00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:11.980
should have said that
right here.

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:13.715
This is true for this theorem.

00:18:13.715 --> 00:18:16.190
The mean value theorem
comes with an extra

00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:17.950
statement, which I missed.

00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:21.960
Which is that this is for
some c between 0 and 4.

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:23.690
So I know the range is
between 0 and 4.

00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:25.690
The reason why it's between 0
and 4 is that 's part of the

00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:27.560
mean value theorem.

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:29.610
We started at 0,
we ended at 4.

00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:32.420
So the c has to be somewhere
in between.

00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:42.240
That's part of the mean
value theorem.

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:42.890
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:44.600
PROFESSOR: The question is, do
you exclude any values that

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:45.820
are above 4 and below 0.

00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:47.210
Yes, absolutely.

00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:49.860
The point is that in order to
figure out how F changes,

00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:52.760
capital F changes, between 0
and 4, you need only pay

00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:54.150
attention to the values
in between.

00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:56.210
You don't have to pay any
attention to what the function

00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:59.740
is doing below 0 or above 4.

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:07.090
Those things are strictly
irrelevant.

00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:16.780
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:18.270
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I mean
it's strictly in

00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:19.950
between these two numbers.

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:23.420
I have to understand what the
lowest and the highest one is.

00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:24.700
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:35.200
PROFESSOR: It's approaching
that, so.

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:35.530
OK.

00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:40.050
So now, the next thing that
we're going to talk about is,

00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:42.400
since I've got that 1 up
there, that Fundamental

00:19:42.400 --> 00:20:05.070
Theorem of Calculus 1, I need
to talk about version 2.

00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:15.530
So here is the Fundamental
Theorem of Calculus version 2.

00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:20.900
I'm going to start out with a
function little f, and I'm

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:28.200
going to assume that
it's continuous.

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:30.690
And then I'm going to define a
new function, which is defined

00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:32.790
as a definite integral.

00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:40.310
G ( x ) is the integral from
a to x of f ( t ) dt.

00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:42.840
Now, I want to emphasize here
because it's the first time

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:44.830
that I'm writing something
like this, that this is a

00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:47.300
fairly complicated gadget.

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:52.110
It plays a very basic and very
fundamental, but simple role

00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:54.490
but it nevertheless is
a little complicated.

00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:58.370
What's happening here is that
the upper limit I've now

00:20:58.370 --> 00:21:05.840
called x, and the variable t
is ranging between a and x,

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:08.250
and that the a and the
x are fixed when I

00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:12.290
calculate the integral.

00:21:12.290 --> 00:21:14.730
And the t is what's called
the dummy variable.

00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:16.290
It's the variable
of integration.

00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:21.420
You'll see a lot of people who
will mix this x with this t.

00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:25.790
And if you do that, you will
get confused, potentially

00:21:25.790 --> 00:21:28.150
hopelessly confused,
in this class.

00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:30.380
In 18.02 you will be completely

00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:32.310
lost if you do that.

00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:33.720
So don't do it.

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:38.410
Don't mix these two guys up.

00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:42.510
It's actually done by many
people in textbooks, and it's

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:43.130
fairly careless.

00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:45.230
Especially in old-fashioned
textbooks.

00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:48.610
But don't do it.

00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:50.570
So here we have this G ( x).

00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:56.250
Now, remember, this G ( x)
really does make sense.

00:21:56.250 --> 00:22:00.490
If you give me an a, and you
give me an x, I can figure out

00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:02.830
what this is, because I can
figure out the Riemann sum.

00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:05.090
So of course I need to know
what the function is, too.

00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:07.370
But anyway, we have a numerical
procedure for

00:22:07.370 --> 00:22:09.920
figuring out what the
function g is.

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:13.090
Now, as is suggested by this
mysterious letter x being in

00:22:13.090 --> 00:22:16.350
the place where it is, I'm
actually going to vary x.

00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:20.000
So the conclusion is that if
this is true, and this is just

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.870
a parenthesism not part
of the theorem.

00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:25.770
It's just an indication of
what the notation means.

00:22:25.770 --> 00:22:40.430
Then G' = f.

00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:43.030
Let me first explain what the
significance of this theorem

00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:47.830
is, from the point of view of
differential equations.

00:22:47.830 --> 00:23:04.420
G ( x) solves the differential
equation y' = f ( x).

00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:09.960
So y' = f, you put the x in
if I got it here, with the

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:13.240
condition y ( a) = 0.

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:19.000
So it solves this pair
of conditions here.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.860
The rate of change, and
the initial position

00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:23.280
is specified here.

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:29.660
Because when you integrate from
a to a, you get 0 always.

00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:33.660
And what this theorem
says is you can

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:35.700
always solve that equation.

00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:36.670
When we did differential

00:23:36.670 --> 00:23:38.130
equations, I said that already.

00:23:38.130 --> 00:23:39.990
I said we'll treat these
as always solved.

00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:41.530
Well, here's the reason.

00:23:41.530 --> 00:23:43.160
We have a numerical
procedure for

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:45.080
computing things like this.

00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:49.330
We could always solve
this equation.

00:23:49.330 --> 00:23:54.530
And the formula is a fairly
complicated gadget, but so far

00:23:54.530 --> 00:23:58.400
just associated with
Riemann sums.

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:01.000
Alright, now.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:13.820
Let's just do one example.

00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:17.610
Unfortunately, not a complicated
example and maybe

00:24:17.610 --> 00:24:19.580
not persuasive as to
why you would care

00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:21.230
about this just yet.

00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:23.670
But nevertheless
very important.

00:24:23.670 --> 00:24:26.470
Because this is the quiz
question which everybody gets

00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:29.530
wrong until they practice it.

00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:38.710
So the integral from, say
1 to x of dt / t ^2.

00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:45.420
Let's try this one here.

00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:56.650
So here's an example of
this theorem, I claim.

00:24:56.650 --> 00:25:01.020
Now, this is a question which
challenges your ability to

00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:04.740
understand what the
question means.

00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:06.800
Because it's got a
lot of symbols.

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:09.730
It's got the integration and
it's got the differentiation.

00:25:09.730 --> 00:25:15.700
However, what it really is
an exercise in recopying.

00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:20.660
You look at it and you write
down the answer.

00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:25.720
And the reason is that, by
definition, this function in

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:30.740
here is a function of the
form G ( x) of the

00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:34.320
theorem over here.

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:35.920
So this is the G ( x).

00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:42.980
And by definition, we said
that G' ( x) = f(x).

00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:46.170
Well, what's the f ( x)?

00:25:46.170 --> 00:25:47.010
Look inside here.

00:25:47.010 --> 00:25:48.760
It's what's called
the integrand.

00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:53.640
This is the integral from 0
to x of f ( t ) dt, right?

00:25:53.640 --> 00:26:00.710
Where f ( t) = 1 / t^2.

00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:02.910
So your ability is challenged.

00:26:02.910 --> 00:26:06.430
You have to take that 1 / t ^2
and you have to plug in the

00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:09.960
letter x, instead of t for it.

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:11.480
And then write it down.

00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:18.120
As I say, this is an exercise
in recopying what's there.

00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:19.970
So this is quite easy
to do, right?

00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:21.750
I mean, you just look and
you write it down.

00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:25.490
But nevertheless, it
looks like a long,

00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:28.350
elaborate object here.

00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:28.760
Pardon me?

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:30.590
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:32.940
PROFESSOR: So the question
was, why did I integrate.

00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:34.000
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.990
PROFESSOR: Why did
I not integrate?

00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:37.720
Ah.

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:38.870
Very good question.

00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:41.010
Why did I not integrate.

00:26:41.010 --> 00:26:45.300
The reason why I didn't
integrate is I didn't need to.

00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:48.890
Just as when you take the -
sorry, the derivative of

00:26:48.890 --> 00:26:50.610
something, you take the
antiderivative, you get back

00:26:50.610 --> 00:26:51.750
to the thing.

00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:54.650
So, in this case, we're taking
the antiderivative of

00:26:54.650 --> 00:26:56.030
something and we're
differentiating.

00:26:56.030 --> 00:26:58.380
So we end back in the same
place where we started.

00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:01.780
We started with f ( t),
we're ending with f.

00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:04.990
Little f.

00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:06.950
So you integrate, and
then differentiate.

00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:09.410
And you get back to
the same place.

00:27:09.410 --> 00:27:11.960
Now, the only difference between
this and the other

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:14.880
version is, in this case when
you differentiate and

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:18.430
integrate you could be
off by a constant.

00:27:18.430 --> 00:27:19.910
That's what that shift,
why there are two

00:27:19.910 --> 00:27:21.420
pieces to this one.

00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:23.020
But there's never an
extra piece here.

00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:25.060
There's no + c here.

00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:26.890
When you integrate and
differentiate, you kill

00:27:26.890 --> 00:27:28.080
whatever the constant is.

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:31.920
Because the derivative
of a constant is 0.

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:36.430
So no matter what the constant
is hiding inside of g, you're

00:27:36.430 --> 00:27:37.710
getting the same result.

00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:41.140
So this is the basic idea.

00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:47.450
Now, I just want to double-check
it, using the

00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:52.170
Fundamental Theorem of
Calculus 1 here.

00:27:52.170 --> 00:27:53.790
So let's actually evaluate
the integral.

00:27:53.790 --> 00:27:55.820
So now I'm going to do what
you've suggested, which is I'm

00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:57.370
just going to check
whether it's true.

00:27:57.370 --> 00:27:59.890
No, no I am because I'm going
just double-check that it's

00:27:59.890 --> 00:28:01.120
consistent.

00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:03.930
It certainly is slower this way,
and we're not going to

00:28:03.930 --> 00:28:05.390
want to do this all the
time, but we might

00:28:05.390 --> 00:28:06.810
as well check one.

00:28:06.810 --> 00:28:09.370
So this is our integral.

00:28:09.370 --> 00:28:10.860
And we know how to do it.

00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:13.260
No, I need to do it.

00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:17.820
And this is - t ^ - 1,
evaluated at 1 and x.

00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:22.480
Again, there's something
subliminally here for you to

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:23.300
think about.

00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:25.980
Which is that, remember,
its t is ranging

00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:28.840
between 1 and t = x.

00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:31.280
And this is one of the big
reasons why this letter t has

00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:32.860
to be different from x.

00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:35.370
Because here it's 1
and there it's x.

00:28:35.370 --> 00:28:37.210
It's not x.

00:28:37.210 --> 00:28:38.890
So you can't put an x here.

00:28:38.890 --> 00:28:44.130
Again, this is t = 1 and this
is t = x over there.

00:28:44.130 --> 00:28:48.630
And now if I plug that
in, I get what?

00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:55.860
I get - 1 / x, and then
I get - ( - 1).

00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:59.090
So this is, let me get rid of
those little t's there.

00:28:59.090 --> 00:29:05.690
This is a little
easier to read.

00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:07.030
And so now let's check it.

00:29:07.030 --> 00:29:07.730
It's d / dx.

00:29:07.730 --> 00:29:09.280
So here's what G ( x) is.

00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:12.260
G ( x) = 1 - 1 / x.

00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:14.860
That's what G( x) is.

00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:20.500
And if I differentiate that,
I get + 1 / x ^2.

00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:26.170
That's it.

00:29:26.170 --> 00:29:40.810
You see the constant
washed away.

00:29:40.810 --> 00:29:42.070
So now, here's my job.

00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:45.330
My job is to prove these
theorems. I never did prove

00:29:45.330 --> 00:29:46.140
them for you.

00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:47.210
So, I'm going to prove the

00:29:47.210 --> 00:29:49.340
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:53.420
But I'm going to do 2 first.
And then I'm going to do 1.

00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:56.490
And it's just going to take
me just one blackboard.

00:29:56.490 --> 00:30:00.310
It's not that hard.

00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:03.150
The proof is by picture.

00:30:03.150 --> 00:30:08.310
And, using the interpretation
as area under the curve.

00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:13.650
So if here's the value of a, and
this is the graph of the

00:30:13.650 --> 00:30:22.550
function y equals f of x.

00:30:22.550 --> 00:30:26.380
Then I want to draw three
vertical lines.

00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:29.330
One of them is going
to be at x.

00:30:29.330 --> 00:30:33.790
And one of them is going
to be at x + delta x.

00:30:33.790 --> 00:30:37.390
So here I have the interval from
0 to x, and next I have

00:30:37.390 --> 00:30:42.900
the interval from x to delta
x more than that.

00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:50.360
And now the pieces that I've got
are the area of this part.

00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:53.430
So this has area which
has a name.

00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:55.860
It's called G ( x ).

00:30:55.860 --> 00:31:00.900
By definition, G( x ), which is
sitting right over here in

00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:05.500
the fundamental theorem, is the
integral from a to x of

00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:06.100
this function.

00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:07.890
So it's the area under
the curve.

00:31:07.890 --> 00:31:10.400
So that area is G ( x ).

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:21.700
Now this other chunk here, I
claim that this is delta G.

00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:24.980
This is the change in G. It's
the value of G ( x ) that is

00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:27.930
the area of the whole business
all the way up to x + delta x

00:31:27.930 --> 00:31:30.530
- the first part, G ( x ).

00:31:30.530 --> 00:31:31.640
So it's what's left over.

00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:39.780
It's the incremental amount
of area there.

00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:45.100
And now I am going to carry
out a pretty standard

00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:46.520
estimation here.

00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:48.850
This is practically
a rectangle.

00:31:48.850 --> 00:31:51.590
And it's got a base of delta
x, and so we need to figure

00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:55.320
out what its height is.

00:31:55.320 --> 00:32:02.450
This is delta G, and it's
approximately its base times

00:32:02.450 --> 00:32:05.340
its height.

00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:06.820
But what is the height?

00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:10.390
Well, the height is maybe either
this segment or this

00:32:10.390 --> 00:32:11.920
segment or something
in between.

00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:13.720
But they're all about
the same.

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:17.070
So I'm just going to put in the
value at the first point.

00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:19.430
That's the left end there.

00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:25.550
So that's this height
here, is f ( x ).

00:32:25.550 --> 00:32:28.330
So this is f (x), and so really
I approximate it by

00:32:28.330 --> 00:32:30.050
that rectangle there.

00:32:30.050 --> 00:32:34.790
And now if I divide and take the
limit, as delta x goes to

00:32:34.790 --> 00:32:43.120
0 of delta G / delta x, it's
going to equal f ( x ).

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:48.920
And this is where I'm using the
fact that f is continuous.

00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:51.960
Because I need the values nearby
to be similar to the

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:59.690
value in the limit.

00:32:59.690 --> 00:33:00.650
OK, that's the end.

00:33:00.650 --> 00:33:05.020
This the end of the proof, so
I'll put a nice little q.e.d.

00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:10.800
here.

00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:14.750
So we've done Fundamental
Theorem of Calculus 2, and now

00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:38.420
we're ready for Fundamental
Theorem of Calculus 1.

00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:44.580
So now I still have it on the
blackboard to remind you.

00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:48.690
It says that the integral
of the derivative is the

00:33:48.690 --> 00:33:50.980
function, at least the
difference between the values

00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:54.830
of the function at two places.

00:33:54.830 --> 00:34:04.300
So the place where we
start is with this

00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:08.040
property that F' = f.

00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:10.600
That's the starting, that's
the hypothesis.

00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:13.770
Now, unfortunately, I'm going
to have to assume something

00:34:13.770 --> 00:34:17.730
extra in order to use the
Fundamental Theorem of

00:34:17.730 --> 00:34:24.410
Calculus 2, which is I'm going
to assume that f is

00:34:24.410 --> 00:34:27.980
continuous.

00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:31.380
That's not really necessary, but
that's just a very minor

00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:34.280
technical point, which I'm
just going to ignore.

00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:40.610
So we're going to start
with F' = f.

00:34:40.610 --> 00:34:46.530
And then I'm going to
go somewhere else.

00:34:46.530 --> 00:34:53.580
I'm going to define a new
function, G (x), which is the

00:34:53.580 --> 00:35:00.130
integral from a to
x of f ( t ) dt.

00:35:00.130 --> 00:35:04.560
This is where we needed all of
the labor of Riemann's sums.

00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:07.170
Because otherwise we don't have
a way of making sense out

00:35:07.170 --> 00:35:10.340
of what this even means.

00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:14.690
So hiding behind this one
sentence is the fact that we

00:35:14.690 --> 00:35:16.050
actually have a number.

00:35:16.050 --> 00:35:18.430
We have a formula for
such functions.

00:35:18.430 --> 00:35:21.450
So there is a function g (x)
which, once you've produced a

00:35:21.450 --> 00:35:27.420
little f for me, I can cook up
a function capital G for you.

00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:30.860
Now, we're going to apply this
Fundamental Theorem of

00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:34.650
Calculus 2, the one that
we've already checked.

00:35:34.650 --> 00:35:36.030
So what does it say?

00:35:36.030 --> 00:35:46.510
It says that G' = f.

00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:49.820
And so now we're in the
following situation.

00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:58.080
We know that F' (
x ) = G' ( x).

00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:00.360
That's what we've got so far.

00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:06.650
And now we have one last step
to get a good connection

00:36:06.650 --> 00:36:10.380
between F and G. Which is that
we can conclude that F ( x ) =

00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:12.170
G ( x) + c.

00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:28.730
Now, this little step may seem
innocuous but I remind you

00:36:28.730 --> 00:36:32.610
that this is the spot
that requires

00:36:32.610 --> 00:36:36.030
the mean value theorem.

00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:40.220
So in order not too lie to you,
we actually tell you what

00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:42.680
the underpinnings of all
of calculus are.

00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:45.720
And they're this: the fact,
if you like, that if two

00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:47.110
functions have the
same derivative,

00:36:47.110 --> 00:36:48.430
they differ by a constant.

00:36:48.430 --> 00:36:50.750
Or that if a function
has derivative 0,

00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:53.960
it's a constant itself.

00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:58.110
Now, that is the fundamental
step that's needed, the

00:36:58.110 --> 00:36:59.740
underlying step that's needed.

00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:02.630
And, unfortunately, there aren't
any proofs of it that

00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:06.050
are less complicated than using
the mean value theorem.

00:37:06.050 --> 00:37:08.190
And so that's why we talk a
little bit about the mean

00:37:08.190 --> 00:37:10.630
value theorem, because we don't
want to lie to you about

00:37:10.630 --> 00:37:11.780
what's really going on.

00:37:11.780 --> 00:37:12.230
Yes.

00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:19.070
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:19.070 --> 00:37:24.210
PROFESSOR: The question is how
did I get from here, to here.

00:37:24.210 --> 00:37:28.160
And the answer is that if G' is
little f, and we also know

00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:32.950
that F' is little f,
then F' is G'.

00:37:32.950 --> 00:37:37.090
OK.

00:37:37.090 --> 00:37:50.710
Other questions?

00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:52.750
Alright, so we're almost done.

00:37:52.750 --> 00:37:57.400
I just have to work out
the arithmetic here.

00:37:57.400 --> 00:38:04.810
So I start with F(b) - F ( a).

00:38:04.810 --> 00:38:18.130
And that's equal to (G (
b) + c) - (G (a) + c).

00:38:18.130 --> 00:38:20.970
And then I cancel the c's.

00:38:20.970 --> 00:38:23.310
So I have here G(b) - G(a).

00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:32.665
And now I just have to check
what each of these is.

00:38:32.665 --> 00:38:35.090
So Remember the definition
of G here.

00:38:35.090 --> 00:38:38.100
G ( b) is just what we want.

00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:42.460
The integral from a
to b of f(x) dx.

00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:46.430
Well I called it f ( t) dt,
that's the same as f(x) dx

00:38:46.430 --> 00:38:49.900
now, because I have the limit
being b and I'm allowed to use

00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:52.900
x as the dummy variable.

00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:55.780
Now the other one,
I claim, is 0.

00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:59.680
Because it's the integral
from a to a.

00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:03.490
This one is the integral
from a to a.

00:39:03.490 --> 00:39:06.510
Which gives us 0.

00:39:06.510 --> 00:39:09.370
So this is just this - 0,
and that's the end.

00:39:09.370 --> 00:39:13.460
That's it.

00:39:13.460 --> 00:39:20.370
I started with F( b) - F( a),
I got to the integral.

00:39:20.370 --> 00:39:20.770
Question?

00:39:20.770 --> 00:39:27.370
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:27.370 --> 00:39:32.070
PROFESSOR: How did I get from
F ( b) - F (a), is (G ( b) +

00:39:32.070 --> 00:39:35.430
c) - (G( a) + c), that's
the question.

00:39:35.430 --> 00:39:40.190
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:40.190 --> 00:39:44.160
PROFESSOR: Oh, sorry this
is an equals sign.

00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:47.090
Sorry, the second line
didn't draw.

00:39:47.090 --> 00:39:48.640
OK, equals.

00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:53.240
Because we're plugging in for
f (x) the formula for it.

00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:53.640
Yes.

00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:57.310
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:57.310 --> 00:39:59.630
PROFESSOR: This step here?

00:39:59.630 --> 00:40:04.730
Or this one? there's

00:40:04.730 --> 00:40:09.520
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:10.100
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:12.090
So that was a good question.

00:40:12.090 --> 00:40:15.540
But the answer is that that's
the statement that we're

00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:16.300
aiming for.

00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:18.280
That's the Fundamental Theorem
of Calculus 1, which

00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:19.950
we don't know yet.

00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:22.030
So we're trying to prove it, and
that's why we haven't, we

00:40:22.030 --> 00:40:25.950
can't assume it.

00:40:25.950 --> 00:40:33.270
OK, so let me just notice that
in the example that we had,

00:40:33.270 --> 00:40:36.410
before we go on to something
else here.

00:40:36.410 --> 00:40:48.530
In the example above, what we
had was the following thing.

00:40:48.530 --> 00:40:58.070
We had, say, F (
x ) = - 1 / x.

00:40:58.070 --> 00:41:01.890
So F' (x) = 1 / x ^2.

00:41:01.890 --> 00:41:08.850
And, say, G ( x)
= 1 - (1 / x).

00:41:08.850 --> 00:41:12.220
And you can see that either
way you do that, if you

00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:15.260
integrate from 1 to 2, let's
say, which is what we had over

00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:26.160
there, dt / t ^2, you're going
to get either - 1 / t, 1 to 2

00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:31.200
or, if you like, 1 -
(1 / t), 1 to 2.

00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:33.930
So this is the F version,
this is the G version.

00:41:33.930 --> 00:41:36.750
And that's what plays
itself out here, in

00:41:36.750 --> 00:41:45.410
this general proof.

00:41:45.410 --> 00:41:49.640
Alright.

00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:55.560
So now I want to go back to the
theme for today, which is

00:41:55.560 --> 00:42:01.290
using little f to understand
capital F. In other words,

00:42:01.290 --> 00:42:06.490
using the derivative of f to
understand capital F. And I

00:42:06.490 --> 00:42:22.630
want to illustrate it by some
more complicated examples.

00:42:22.630 --> 00:42:26.980
So I guess I just erased it,
but we just took the

00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:29.740
antiderivative of 1 / t ^2.

00:42:29.740 --> 00:42:32.320
And there's all of the
powers work easily.

00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:39.190
But one, and the tricky one
is the power 1 / x.

00:42:39.190 --> 00:42:41.060
So let's consider the
differential equation

00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:44.550
L' ( x) = 1 / x.

00:42:44.550 --> 00:42:54.490
And say, with the initial
value L (1) = 0.

00:42:54.490 --> 00:42:56.250
The solution, so the Fundamental
Theorem of

00:42:56.250 --> 00:43:05.870
Calculus 2 tells us
the solution is

00:43:05.870 --> 00:43:07.330
this function here.

00:43:07.330 --> 00:43:14.070
L( x) equals the integral
from 1 to x, dt / t.

00:43:14.070 --> 00:43:16.490
That's how we solve all
such equations.

00:43:16.490 --> 00:43:19.290
We just integrate, take
the definite integral.

00:43:19.290 --> 00:43:27.400
And I'm starting at 1 because
I insisted that L( 1 ) be 0.

00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:31.100
So that's the solution
to the problem.

00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:34.370
And now the thing that's
interesting here is that we

00:43:34.370 --> 00:43:35.720
started from a polynomial.

00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:38.060
Or we started from a rational,
a ratio of polynomials; that

00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:40.460
is, 1 / t or 1 / x.

00:43:40.460 --> 00:43:43.180
And we get to a function which
is actually what's known as a

00:43:43.180 --> 00:43:44.990
transcendental function.

00:43:44.990 --> 00:43:46.460
It's not an algebraic
function.

00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:47.080
Yeah, question.

00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:57.000
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:04.970
PROFESSOR: The question is why
is this equal to that.

00:44:04.970 --> 00:44:09.460
And the answer is, it's for the
same reason that this is

00:44:09.460 --> 00:44:10.200
equal to that.

00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:14.030
It's the same reason as this.

00:44:14.030 --> 00:44:16.760
It's that the 1's cancel.

00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:19.410
We're taken the value of
something at 2 minus

00:44:19.410 --> 00:44:20.300
the value at 1.

00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:22.500
The value at 2 minus
the value at 1.

00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:25.150
And you'll get a 1 in the one
case, and you get a 1 in the

00:44:25.150 --> 00:44:25.470
other case.

00:44:25.470 --> 00:44:27.580
And you subtract them and
they will cancel.

00:44:27.580 --> 00:44:28.620
They'll give you 0.

00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:31.380
These two things really
are equal.

00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:33.870
This is not a function evaluated
at one place, it's

00:44:33.870 --> 00:44:36.100
the difference between the
function evaluated at 2 and

00:44:36.100 --> 00:44:37.025
the value at 1.

00:44:37.025 --> 00:44:39.570
And whenever you subtract
two things like that,

00:44:39.570 --> 00:44:40.900
constants drop out.

00:44:40.900 --> 00:44:43.960
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:44.370
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:44:44.370 --> 00:44:46.300
If I put 2, here if I
put c here, it would

00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:47.370
have been the same.

00:44:47.370 --> 00:44:49.010
It would just have
dropped out.

00:44:49.010 --> 00:44:50.640
It's not there.

00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:53.260
And that's exactly this
arithmetic right here.

00:44:53.260 --> 00:44:55.520
It doesn't matter which
antiderivative you take.

00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:57.850
When you take the differences,
the c's will cancel.

00:44:57.850 --> 00:45:03.130
You always get the same
answer in the end.

00:45:03.130 --> 00:45:05.140
That's exactly why I wrote
this down, so that

00:45:05.140 --> 00:45:06.290
you would see that.

00:45:06.290 --> 00:45:12.890
It doesn't matter which
one you do.

00:45:12.890 --> 00:45:21.540
So, we still have a couple
of minutes left here.

00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:23.630
This is actually, so
let me go back.

00:45:23.630 --> 00:45:29.720
So here's the antiderivative of
1 / x, with value 1 at 0.

00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:32.180
Now, in disguise, we know
what this function is.

00:45:32.180 --> 00:45:35.410
We know this function is
the logarithm function.

00:45:35.410 --> 00:45:40.090
But this is actually a better
way of deriving all of the

00:45:40.090 --> 00:45:42.030
formulas for the logarithm.

00:45:42.030 --> 00:45:43.970
This is a much quicker
and more efficient

00:45:43.970 --> 00:45:44.850
way of doing it.

00:45:44.850 --> 00:45:47.280
We had to do it by very
laborious processes.

00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:51.690
This will allow us to
do it very easily.

00:45:51.690 --> 00:45:56.040
And so, I'm going to
do that next time.

00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:59.590
But rather than do that now, I'm
going to point out to you

00:45:59.590 --> 00:46:10.280
that we can also get truly
new functions.

00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:12.130
OK, so there are all kinds
of new functions.

00:46:12.130 --> 00:46:15.860
So this is the first example
of this kind would be, for

00:46:15.860 --> 00:46:23.060
example, to solve the equation
y' = e ^ - x^2 with y( 0 ) =

00:46:23.060 --> 00:46:25.140
0, let's say.

00:46:25.140 --> 00:46:28.860
Now, the solution to that is a
function which again I can

00:46:28.860 --> 00:46:30.380
write down by the fundamental
theorem.

00:46:30.380 --> 00:46:48.160
It's the integral from 0
to x of e ^ - t^2 dt.

00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:52.370
This is a very famous
function.

00:46:52.370 --> 00:46:55.820
This shape here is known
as the bell curve.

00:46:55.820 --> 00:46:57.010
And it's the thing
that comes up in

00:46:57.010 --> 00:46:59.170
probability all the time.

00:46:59.170 --> 00:47:01.880
This shape e ^ - x^2.

00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:04.590
And our function is
geometrically just the area

00:47:04.590 --> 00:47:06.310
under the curve here.

00:47:06.310 --> 00:47:09.080
This is F (x).

00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:12.350
If this place is x.

00:47:12.350 --> 00:47:14.340
So I have a geometric
definition, I have a way of

00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:17.030
constructing what it is by
Riemann's sums. And I have a

00:47:17.030 --> 00:47:18.810
function here.

00:47:18.810 --> 00:47:26.070
But the curious thing about F
( x ) is that F ( x ) cannot

00:47:26.070 --> 00:47:34.470
be expressed in terms of any
function you've seen

00:47:34.470 --> 00:47:35.360
previously.

00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:44.210
So logs, exponentials, trig
functions, cannot be.

00:47:44.210 --> 00:47:51.600
It's a totally new function.

00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:54.780
Nevertheless, we'll be able to
get any possible piece of

00:47:54.780 --> 00:47:56.910
information we would want to,
out of this function.

00:47:56.910 --> 00:47:59.610
It's perfectly acceptable
function, it will work just

00:47:59.610 --> 00:48:00.250
great for us.

00:48:00.250 --> 00:48:01.700
Just like any other function.

00:48:01.700 --> 00:48:03.540
Just like the ln.

00:48:03.540 --> 00:48:07.060
And what this is analogous
to is the

00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:08.890
following kind of thing.

00:48:08.890 --> 00:48:12.650
If you take the circle, the
ancient Greeks, if you like,

00:48:12.650 --> 00:48:17.840
already understood that if you
have a circle of radius 1,

00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:23.290
then its area is pi.

00:48:23.290 --> 00:48:25.640
So that's a geometric
construction of what you could

00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:31.430
call a new number.

00:48:31.430 --> 00:48:34.280
Which is outside of the realm
of what you might expect.

00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:40.660
And the weird thing about this
number pi is that it is not

00:48:40.660 --> 00:48:50.930
the root of an algebraic
equation with rational

00:48:50.930 --> 00:48:57.260
coefficients.

00:48:57.260 --> 00:49:00.540
It's what's called
transcendental.

00:49:00.540 --> 00:49:02.360
Meaning, it's just completely
outside of

00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:04.050
the realm of algebra.

00:49:04.050 --> 00:49:07.270
And, indeed, the logarithm
function is called a

00:49:07.270 --> 00:49:10.040
transcendental function, because
it's completely out of

00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:11.350
the realm of algebra.

00:49:11.350 --> 00:49:14.880
It's only in calculus that
you come up with

00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:16.190
this kind of thing.

00:49:16.190 --> 00:49:21.020
So these kinds of functions
will have access to a huge

00:49:21.020 --> 00:49:24.180
class of new functions here,
all of which are important

00:49:24.180 --> 00:49:26.730
tools in science and
engineering.

00:49:26.730 --> 00:49:29.610
So, see you next time.
