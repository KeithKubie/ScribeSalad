I love America.

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:06.005
It's been perfect
ever since day one,

00:00:06.038 --> 00:00:08.007
when the Pilgrims landed
at Plymouth Rock

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.277
and immediately refused to bake
a cake for some gay Indians.

On religious grounds.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.950
I love it here in America,
but I've got to be honest.

00:00:17.983 --> 00:00:20.720
Sometimes, when I look around,

00:00:20.753 --> 00:00:23.056
I don't recognize
my country anymore.

There's nothing more American

You got "Kentucky ,"
you got "Fried,"

00:00:41.674 --> 00:00:44.010

KFC is developing

<i> Vegetarian</i> fried chicken?!

That's an oxymoron!

00:00:58.591 --> 00:01:00.159
Like government efficiency,

It sure doesn't feel like it.

and going
to the public library--

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:38.731

Statues.

I love statues.

00:01:58.284 --> 00:02:00.786
They're a great way
to commemorate American heroes

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:03.756
who loved this country so much,
they waged war against it.

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:05.625

First Lady Chirlane McCray says

finding a memorial or statue
to instrumental women

00:02:17.937 --> 00:02:20.806
in New York City is like going
on a "scavenger hunt."

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:23.376
When there are no
representations of the women

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:26.812
who built this city,
women of all ethnicities,

00:02:26.845 --> 00:02:30.149
the message is
that women's contributions

00:02:30.182 --> 00:02:32.418
are worth less than men's.

00:02:32.451 --> 00:02:35.488
Hey, lady, what do you mean
you need more statues of women?

00:02:35.521 --> 00:02:37.290
You already have
the tallest one.

And she's great!

00:02:40.993 --> 00:02:42.261
She's holding a book.

00:02:42.294 --> 00:02:44.230
She's supposed to welcome
everyone to the country.

If you think about it,

150 historical male statues
in New York,

00:03:09.188 --> 00:03:11.324

CHUCK: To be honest,
the country<i> is</i> changing.
