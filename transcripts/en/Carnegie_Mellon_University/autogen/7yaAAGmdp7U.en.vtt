system is a mesh network that means that

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.180
system is a mesh network that means that
 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.959
system is a mesh network that means that
power can flow multiple paths so you

00:00:48.959 --> 00:00:48.969
power can flow multiple paths so you
 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:50.610
power can flow multiple paths so you
could have two parallel paths and part

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620
could have two parallel paths and part
 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.080

of the power is flowing over one line

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.090
of the power is flowing over one line
 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.869
of the power is flowing over one line
and the rest on with the other line now

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879
and the rest on with the other line now
 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:57.510

challenges which we're encountering is

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:57.520
challenges which we're encountering is
 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.760
challenges which we're encountering is
that well power flows according to

00:00:59.760 --> 00:00:59.770
that well power flows according to
 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.069
that well power flows according to
kerkoff's law so physical laws that

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:02.079
kerkoff's law so physical laws that
 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:03.660
kerkoff's law so physical laws that
means it's given by the line parameters

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670
means it's given by the line parameters
 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.600
means it's given by the line parameters
and where power is injected where the

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610
and where power is injected where the
 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.430
and where power is injected where the
power is flowing so we can't influence

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:08.440
power is flowing so we can't influence
 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.130
power is flowing so we can't influence
that very well so that means that when

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140
that very well so that means that when
 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.990
that very well so that means that when
we have parallel lines again partly

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000
we have parallel lines again partly
 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.730
we have parallel lines again partly
lower one line and the rest will flow

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740
lower one line and the rest will flow
 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.639
lower one line and the rest will flow
over the other line now that wouldn't be

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:17.649
over the other line now that wouldn't be
 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:19.410
over the other line now that wouldn't be
so bad if we would have unlimited

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420
so bad if we would have unlimited
 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.109
so bad if we would have unlimited
transfer capacity of each line but each

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119
transfer capacity of each line but each
 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:24.120
transfer capacity of each line but each
line is actually limited so the maximum

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130
line is actually limited so the maximum
 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.490
line is actually limited so the maximum
amount of power that we can transmit is

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500
amount of power that we can transmit is
 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.149
amount of power that we can transmit is
is limited so let's look at the

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159
is limited so let's look at the
 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:32.399
is limited so let's look at the
simplified version why is that now a

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:32.409
simplified version why is that now a
 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:35.580
simplified version why is that now a
problem that we can't transmit an

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590
problem that we can't transmit an
 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.249
problem that we can't transmit an
unlimited amount of power let's assume

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259
unlimited amount of power let's assume
 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:40.859
unlimited amount of power let's assume
we have these two power stations and we

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869
we have these two power stations and we
 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:45.420
we have these two power stations and we
want to provide electricity to the load

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430
want to provide electricity to the load
 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.740
want to provide electricity to the load
on the bottom now if we start generating

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750
on the bottom now if we start generating
 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.609
on the bottom now if we start generating
with these two generators at some point

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619
with these two generators at some point
 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.710
with these two generators at some point
we will reach one of the lines which

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720
we will reach one of the lines which
 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.020
we will reach one of the lines which
will actually leech the rim it if the

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030
will actually leech the rim it if the
 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.270
will actually leech the rim it if the
power flows according to the arrows that

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280
power flows according to the arrows that
 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.420
power flows according to the arrows that
EC in in the in the figures now let's

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430
EC in in the in the figures now let's
 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.240
EC in in the in the figures now let's
assume that the right generation plan is

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250
assume that the right generation plan is
 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.219
assume that the right generation plan is
the one which is providing power at low

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229
the one which is providing power at low
 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.109
the one which is providing power at low
cost and the other one is more expensive

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119
cost and the other one is more expensive
 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.900
cost and the other one is more expensive
so that means that as soon as this line

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910
so that means that as soon as this line
 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.640
so that means that as soon as this line
reaches its limit we can't use the

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650
reaches its limit we can't use the
 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.160
reaches its limit we can't use the
cheaper Tran jeepers generator anymore

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170
cheaper Tran jeepers generator anymore
 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.210
cheaper Tran jeepers generator anymore

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220
to supply the load or another reason why
 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.150
to supply the load or another reason why
we would want to be able to get rid of

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160
we would want to be able to get rid of
 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.059
we would want to be able to get rid of
this congestion is that this generation

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069
this congestion is that this generation
 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:28.949
this congestion is that this generation
plant might be a wind power plant so if

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959
plant might be a wind power plant so if
 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:30.210
plant might be a wind power plant so if
we can't use that and you

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220
we can't use that and you
 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.950
we can't use that and you
or then we basically have to spill

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960
or then we basically have to spill
 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.750
or then we basically have to spill

very valuable so ways how we can solve

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450
very valuable so ways how we can solve
 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.840
very valuable so ways how we can solve
that problem is built generation closer

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850
that problem is built generation closer
 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.460
that problem is built generation closer
to load so that and we don't need to

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470
to load so that and we don't need to
 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.040
to load so that and we don't need to
transmit it that much anymore or we

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050
transmit it that much anymore or we
 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:45.420
transmit it that much anymore or we
build additional transmission lines

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430
build additional transmission lines
 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:46.800
build additional transmission lines
which give us additional transfer

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810
which give us additional transfer
 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.290
which give us additional transfer
capacity another option is to increase

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.170
imagine that at some point in time you
have a lot of wind generation in one on

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180
have a lot of wind generation in one on
 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.199
have a lot of wind generation in one on
one side of the system and that results

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209
one side of the system and that results
 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:00.150
one side of the system and that results
in concessions on that set on that side

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160
in concessions on that set on that side
 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.850

you're able to push power to the rest of
 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.370
you're able to push power to the rest of
the system however if the congestion is

on the other side of the system you're
 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.449
on the other side of the system you're
able to again push some power to the

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459
able to again push some power to the
 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:11.850
able to again push some power to the

we how do we control these elements if
 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:33.330
we how do we control these elements if
we have them in the system so we're not

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340
we have them in the system so we're not
 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.940
we have them in the system so we're not
concerned about how do we develop

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:35.950
concerned about how do we develop
 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:37.800

flow is flowing over that line now so if

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:05.539
flow is flowing over that line now so if
 

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:07.509

you're placing that device in the line

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:07.519
you're placing that device in the line
 

00:05:07.519 --> 00:05:09.279
you're placing that device in the line
which is congested what it allows us to

a responsibility of the control for a
certain area in the system to to a

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:38.520
certain area in the system to to a
 

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:40.610
certain area in the system to to a
certain entity and the idea is that

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:40.620
certain entity and the idea is that
 

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:42.800
certain entity and the idea is that
these entities talk to each other but in

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:42.810
these entities talk to each other but in
 

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:45.469
these entities talk to each other but in
a very limited way but that there is

00:07:45.469 --> 00:07:45.479
a very limited way but that there is
 

00:07:45.479 --> 00:07:47.510
a very limited way but that there is
determining the control settings which

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:47.520
determining the control settings which
 

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:48.980
determining the control settings which
would also be optimal from the

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:48.990
would also be optimal from the
 

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:51.890
would also be optimal from the
centralized perspective so we want to

00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:51.900
centralized perspective so we want to
 

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:53.719
centralized perspective so we want to
achieve the overall optimal settings of

00:07:53.719 --> 00:07:53.729
achieve the overall optimal settings of
 

00:07:53.729 --> 00:07:55.730
achieve the overall optimal settings of
all of these devices which would also

00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:55.740
all of these devices which would also
 

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:58.279
all of these devices which would also
result in a good coordination of these

00:07:58.279 --> 00:07:58.289
result in a good coordination of these
 

00:07:58.289 --> 00:08:00.830
result in a good coordination of these
devices the general objective that we're

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:00.840
devices the general objective that we're
 

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:03.529
devices the general objective that we're
looking at is remove improve reliability

00:08:03.529 --> 00:08:03.539
looking at is remove improve reliability
 

00:08:03.539 --> 00:08:07.100
looking at is remove improve reliability
and reduce generation costs so having a

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:07.110
and reduce generation costs so having a
 

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:09.050
and reduce generation costs so having a
trade-off between reliability and

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:09.060
trade-off between reliability and
 

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:13.459
trade-off between reliability and
generation cost so that brings me to my

00:08:13.459 --> 00:08:13.469
generation cost so that brings me to my
 

00:08:13.469 --> 00:08:15.860
generation cost so that brings me to my
