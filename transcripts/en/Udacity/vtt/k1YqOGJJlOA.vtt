00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.220
In the last question of
the previous section,

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.240
we saw that if you drive your
car 150 miles in three hours,

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.350
you can describe that with a rate
of 150 miles over three hours.

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:17.260
This rate simplifies into 50 miles
over one hour or 50 miles per hour.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.620
This version of the rate is
what's known as a unit rate.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:27.430
The reason this is a unit rate, we
have this uni in here which means one,

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:33.240
is because a unit rate is any rate where
the value of the denominator is 1.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.100
These rates can be super useful,

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.960
primarily because
they're easy to compare.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.950
Let's start with a simple question.

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.090
Rafael drives his car
at 64 miles an hour and

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.420
Anastasia drives at 62 miles per hour.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.170
Who drives faster, Rafael or Anastasia?

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.320
This is not a trick question.
