10 Amazing Actors Who Show Up In Multiple
Superhero Movies

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.760
Superhero movies are currently some of the
most popular and successful in Hollywood.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.530
As a result, more and more of them are getting
released every year.

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.750
Because of that, actors are inevitably turning
up in more than one of them and playing multiple

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:20.750
characters.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.000
In some cases, you'll notice obvious similarities
between the different characters a single

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.650
actor has played, but the most interesting
thing is seeing just how different some of

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:28.650
them are.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.419
For example, one actor in this video has played
both a disfigured western bounty hunter and

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:36.460
a monstrous alien warlord.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.640
Although this is by no means an exhaustive
list, let's a take a look at some of the best

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.830
examples of this; Here are 10 amazing actors
who show up in multiple superhero movies.

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.240
Chris Evans
Having first appeared as a Marvel character

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.199
in Fox's terrible Fantastic Four movies, you
would think Chris Evans would have stayed

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:55.979
away from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but
his role as the Human Torch in 2005's Fantastic

00:00:55.979 --> 00:01:00.870
Four and 2007's Fantastic Four: Rise of the
Silver Surfer hasn't prevented him from making

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.510
a success of his more recent role as Captain
America.

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.740
Evans has played the super soldier - also
known as Steve Rogers - in no less than seven

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.490
movies to date, including cameos and credits
scenes.

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.869
The role started with 2011's Captain America:
The First Avenger and, most recently, has

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:17.820
seen Evans star in this year's Captain America:
Civil War.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.710
It should also be noted that he played computer
hacker Jake Jensen in 2010's The Losers, alongside

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:22.710
the aforementioned Idris Elba.

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.950
Ben Affleck
There's no denying that Ben Affleck is a very

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.130
talented actor, but back in 2003 his reputation
took a really hard hit.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.759
Affleck played the title character, Matt Murdock,
in Daredevil and was almost universally panned

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:35.330
for his portrayal of the superhero.

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.310
In fact, 2003 was the year he won the Golden
Raspberry Award for Worst Actor for his performances,

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.280
which also included roles in Gigli and Paycheck.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.569
More recently, however, he portrayed the iconic
Dark Knight, Batman, in 2016's Batman v Superman:

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:49.569
Dawn of Justice.

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:52.869
His initial casting was met with anger, but
his eventual performance won over the fans

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:56.259
pretty emphatically, and the world is looking
forward to seeing him in the role again in

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:57.259
the future.

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:00.170
Idris Elba
Multi-talented British actor, musician and

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.810
DJ, Idris Elba, is best-known for his performance
in TV shows like The Wire and Luther - but

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.009
he's also appeared in multiple superhero movies.

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:11.420
Elba has portrayed the all-seeing Asgardian
Heimdall in three Marvel Cinematic Universe

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:17.360
movies to date; 2011's Thor, 2013's Thor:
The Dark World and 2015's Avengers: Age of

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.360
Ultron.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.420
But he also played a French priest by the
name of Moreau in 2013's Ghost Rider: Spirit

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.400
of Vengeance, as well as the explosives expert,
Roque, in 2010's The Losers (which isn't really

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.920
a "superhero" movie, but is based on a Vertigo
Comics title).

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.900
Josh Brolin
Goonies star Josh Brolin has starred as two

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.080
very different comic book movie characters
in two very different movie franchises - and

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.440
the first is a role he probably regrets.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.080
He played the title character in 2010's Jonah
Hex - a movie in which even a stellar cast

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.930
couldn't prevent it from being awful.

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.580
More recently, he has portrayed the big-bad
Thanos in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.390
To date, he has appeared in 2014's Guardians
of the Galaxy and in the mid-credits scene

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.220
of 2015's Avengers: Age of Ultron.

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.300
He will have a more prominent part to play
as the Mad Titan in future movies – and

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.820
we can’t wait to see that.

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.300
Tommy Lee Jones
Veteran actor Tommy Lee Jones is another star

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.260
who has played both good guys and bad guys
in superhero movies.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.209
First, he portrayed the iconic Batman villain
known as Two-Face in 1995's Batman Forever

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.790
- a movie in which the villains were the only
characters worth talking talking about.

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.700
More recently, he played Colonel Chester Phillips
- Steve Rogers' commanding officer - in 2011's

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.200
Captain America: The First Avenger.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.500
He's also famously played Agent K in three
Men in Black movies - a franchise that you

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.720
might not know was actually based on a Marvel
Comics property.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.620
J.K. Simmons
The incredibly talented, Academy Award-winning

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:41.070
actor J.K. Simmons brilliantly portrayed the
Daily Bugle's editor-in-chief J. Jonah Jameson

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:42.370
in Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy.

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:43.370
His performance as Jameson was genuinely iconic
and he was undoubtedly the best thing in 2002's

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.370
Spider-Man, 2004's Spider-Man 2 and 2007's
Spider-Man 3.

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.560
For his next role in a superhero movie, we're
going to have to look to the future.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.330
Simmons was recently cast as Commissioner
James Gordon in the DC Extended Movie Universe

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.140
and he will debut as the character in 2017's
Justice League Part One.

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:55.500
How exciting is that?!

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.500
James Marsden
James Marsden's most prominent role in a superhero

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.680
franchise is undoubtedly that of Scott Summers
AKA Cyclops.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.160
Cyclops is the field leader of the X-Men and
Marsden has played the character in four movies

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.320
to date; those being 2000's X-Men, 2003's
X2: X-Men United, 2006's X-Men: The Last Stand

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.140
and 2014's X-Men: Days of Future Past.

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.010
Marsden also played Richard White - the nephew
of the Daily Planet's editor-in-chief Perry

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.209
White and fiancé to Lois Lane - in 2005's
Superman Returns.

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.889
Halle Berry
Academy Award-winning actress Halle Berry

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:28.689
has played Ororo Munroe - the weather-controlling
mutant also known as Storm - in four X-Men

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:29.689
movies to date.

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:34.169
They happen to be the same four movies as
the aforementioned James Marsden and, like

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:37.639
Marsden, it doesn't look like she'll be reprising
the role any time soon.

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:42.070
Berry also has the unwanted distinction of
playing the lead in arguably the worst superhero

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:43.289
movie ever made.

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:47.490
2004's Catwoman was a complete trainwreck
of a movie, and Berry's Patience Phillips

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:52.069
was a truly awful and unfaithful adaptation
of a classic comic book character.

00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:54.999
Jim Carrey
The hilarious and multi-talented Jim Carrey

00:04:54.999 --> 00:04:59.389
has actually played characters in no less
than three different superhero franchises.

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:04.180
Starting with 1994's The Mask, Carrey portrayed
the title character - also known as Stanley

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.889
Ipkiss - in a year that really propelled him
to superstardom.

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:11.550
A year later, he starred alongside the aforementioned
Tommy Lee Jones in Batman Forever.

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:16.310
Like Jones, Carrey also played a villain - The
Riddler in his case - and he did so to near-perfection.

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:21.050
Most recently, he played Colonel Stars and
Stripes in 2013's Kick-Ass 2 - a movie he

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:25.689
famously and controversially retracted support
for, due to the level of violence it depicted

00:05:25.689 --> 00:05:28.410
in the wake of the tragic Sandy Hook shootings.

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:31.159
Ryan Reynolds
Ryan Reynolds has become fairly prolific in

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:35.410
the world of superhero movies, having appeared
as three - or you could even say four - different

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:37.819
characters in four very different movies.

00:05:37.819 --> 00:05:42.529
First of all, he played the cocky vampire
hunter Hannibal King in 2004's Blade: Trinity,

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:47.759
then he played the cocky mercenary Wade Wilson
in 2009's X-Men Origins: Wolverine, then he

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:52.639
played the cocky pilot Hal Jordan in 2011's
Green Lantern and, finally, he played a different

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:57.479
version of the cocky mercenary Wade Wilson
in 2016's Deadpool - are you noticing a trend

00:05:57.479 --> 00:05:58.629
