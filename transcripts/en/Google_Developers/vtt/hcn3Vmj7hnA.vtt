00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.760
LES: So Google TV DevRel
office hours.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:11.432
And we are--

00:00:11.432 --> 00:00:14.090
a bunch of stuff has happened.

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:19.870
Probably the most important is
the 2.1 update went out.

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.970
So let me talk a little
bit about that, and--

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:23.220
AUDIENCE: Oh cool.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.600
LES: --then we'll answer
questions.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.280
So the first, in my view,
the most important

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.870
thing is HLS works.

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.610
So if you're sending media,
it will work.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.080
The other thing is hardware
acceleration turned on.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.780
So in the past, it is not
ever [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.350
There were points during
development it was turned on.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.170
But it's definitely turned
on now, and some

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.420
apps are seeing bugs.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.740
Other thing is there's some
other attributes in the

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:01.990
content provider.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.760
You can now set the information
for what cable

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.490
provider is there.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:24.080
And also has the TMS identifier
for each channel.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.680
So that if you license
information from Tribune,

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.580
you'll now be able
to get that.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.590
LEON: On that particular point,
has the documentation

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.890
been updated on that?

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.410
LES: I haven't looked yet.

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.895
But I asked for it to be
updated by yesterday.

00:01:45.895 --> 00:01:48.510
LEON: OK.

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.870
LES: So we hope the
documentation

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:52.350
is going to be updated.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.950
So I haven't seen the
bug come through

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.760
saying it's been fixed.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:01.560
LEON: OK.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.720
And that'll be on your website,
because originally it

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.600
was included in the
SDK, right?

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.410
LES: Right.

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.030
It should be on the website,
and it should be there.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.110
Let's see, what else?

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.390
LEON: So sorry, just
back on that point.

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.990
So in terms of--

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.550
LES: Absolutely.

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.230
LEON: --the TMS ID
for each channel.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.640
So that just gives you the
channel information.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.270
That still doesn't give you
information on what's kind of

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.980
playing or what the user's
watching, right?

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.380
LES: Say it again?

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.970
LEON: In terms of the TMS
ID you mentioned--

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:38.240
LES: Yes.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.680
LEON: That's really just--

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.350
that's the channel
information.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.710
It doesn't tell you anything
about any programming or what

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.150
the user's watching.

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.890
LES: That's right.

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.295
But with that identifier, you
can license with Tribune and

00:02:52.295 --> 00:02:54.677
you get information about
the programming.

00:02:54.677 --> 00:02:55.927
LEON: OK.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.870
LES: That's how it
works for now.

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:08.735
The other thing you should know
is that if you set min

00:03:08.735 --> 00:03:17.590
SDK to 13, then your app will
only go to the update.

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:24.790
Because this is Honeycomb 3.2,
and the other one is 3.1, and

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.130
there are still Logitech
Revues out there

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:28.380
that haven't updated.

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.980
AUDIENCE: That's me.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.200
LES: OK.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:45.594
So that's basically what I
can remember that's new.

00:03:45.594 --> 00:03:47.050
MEGA: What's the question?

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.926
LES: I was talking about
the 2.1 update.

00:03:49.926 --> 00:03:51.820
MEGA: So hardware
acceleration.

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:52.050
LES: Yeah.

00:03:52.050 --> 00:04:00.660
Hardware acceleration is now
valid, HLS, and the content

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:06.160
provider, the channel listing
content provider.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.286
AUDIENCE: That rolled
out when?

00:04:10.286 --> 00:04:13.530
LES: Monday night at 11:00.

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.200
MEGA: The animations are much
smoother now because of

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.630
hardware acceleration.

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:20.144
LES: Yeah.

00:04:20.144 --> 00:04:20.399
So--

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:21.290
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:22.420
LES: --check it out.

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:24.720
You'll find a lot of
things go better.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:32.680
I updated all the M4s
on Tuesday morning,

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.940
if you have an M4.

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:42.220
And all the Sony boxes should
be updated by the end of the

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.350
day tomorrow.

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.210
And Revue is some time
in the future.

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.210
LEON: So by that you mean
it could be as long as

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:52.460
it took last time?

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.360
LES: I'm not even going
to answer that.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.500
I'm sorry.

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:00.940
AUDIENCE: Hey, it came
by Christmas.

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.190
That wasn't so bad.

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:09.270
LES: It may be as long as last
time, it may be shorter, it

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:10.520
may be longer.

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:16.880
So I've given you all
the possibilities.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.826
But it will come.

00:05:18.826 --> 00:05:19.270
LEON: OK.

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.550
So yesterday the tweet that
went out made a particular

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:23.620
point about Chrome.

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.460
So I'm assuming that it's mostly
about the acceleration.

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.290
There isn't anything
else about Chrome

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:32.400
that's improved or better?

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.680
LES: I don't know what's
happened with Chrome.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.330
I don't really follow Chrome.

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:39.760
And--

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.216
MEGA: I think Shaun will
talk about it.

00:05:42.216 --> 00:05:42.600
LES: Yeah.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.430
So Mega will ask Shaun.

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:50.850
By the way, the crew
has gotten bigger.

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:57.678
Joel, who does our QA,
and Fabia and Mega--

00:05:57.678 --> 00:05:58.134
MEGA: Hi.

00:05:58.134 --> 00:05:59.050
LEON: Hi.

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:00.750
AUDIENCE: Howdy.

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:01.670
LES: All right.

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:05.780
So I guess we've started
the questions.

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:09.545
So ah, Christian is joining
us too with breakfast.

00:06:09.545 --> 00:06:13.320
CHRISTIAN: Breakfast of
champions or something.

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.160
Breakfast for lunch.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.680
LES: Christian, do you know
anything more about 2.1

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.790
besides hardware acceleration,
content provider,

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:23.030
and HLS, and Chrome?

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:26.170
What by Chrome changed?

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:28.650
CHRISTIAN: Well I think not
much about Chrome changed.

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:31.235
It's still the same version.

00:06:31.235 --> 00:06:33.335
LES: No, they tweeted
something different.

00:06:33.335 --> 00:06:33.810
CHRISTIAN: Did they?

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:35.060
OK, then I am out of the loop.

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.334
MALE SPEAKER: OK, we did
see the settings page.

00:06:38.334 --> 00:06:40.242
They incorporated--

00:06:40.242 --> 00:06:43.120
they cleaned it up, basically,
from what I've noticed in the

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:46.736
[INAUDIBLE] versions of
the stable Chrome.

00:06:46.736 --> 00:06:48.730
LES: OK, cool.

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:50.100
All right.

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:54.390
We get more from Shaun
if he pops in.

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:56.290
CHRISTIAN: So the other thing
is did you mention hardware

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:56.910
acceleration?

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:59.750
LES: I did.

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:02.590
The reason everyone in the
room talks about hardware

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:07.130
acceleration, one more
time, is test it.

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:13.270
We're seeing folks who turned it
on hoping for the best and

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:15.850
their apps break.

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:18.130
So it's always important
to check out hardware

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:19.220
acceleration.

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:23.320
But it is showing
some real wins.

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.460
So--

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:29.590
LEON: So in terms of this
update, are we going to expect

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:33.570
similar short-term updates
before the big one that was

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:35.740
announced for the
end of the year?

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:37.135
LES: What big one was
announced for

00:07:37.135 --> 00:07:38.220
the end of the year?

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:40.970
LEON: So somebody said, and I
think this was at CS, somebody

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:43.755
said that there was a big one
planned for the end of the

00:07:43.755 --> 00:07:46.340
year, a major update.

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:47.590
LES: There will be a couple--

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:52.490
there will be some things
before that.

00:07:57.470 --> 00:08:03.280
Whether you consider that a huge
update or not, but there

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:04.530
will be some updates.

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:11.775
Beyond that, I won't
speculate.

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:21.170
I would say most of the updates,
there's going to be

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:25.910
some feature updates, but most
things are going to be related

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:38.396
to apps for the short-term, and
also for getting them on

00:08:38.396 --> 00:08:42.297
new platforms, bringing
up boxes.

00:08:42.297 --> 00:08:46.030
MALE SPEAKER: That would be 2011
is really more about the

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:50.270
new Marvell Flash
ARM platform.

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:51.520
LES: Yeah.

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:55.760
OK.

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:57.060
MALE SPEAKER: What about 2012?

00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:59.590
LES: So Leon's asked a
bunch of questions.

00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:02.150
Let's go ask somebody else.

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:04.505
If I can find my cursor.

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.230
Here we are.

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:13.950
There we are.

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:15.200
So let's start with Will.

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:25.720
You were starting to ask about
looking for some goo-- oh,

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:28.890
actually you should just post
that to the question list,

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:30.885
rather than--

00:09:30.885 --> 00:09:32.130
WILL: Oh, OK.

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:35.080
LES: --here because only the
people who are actually on the

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:40.260
chat, and so far it is basically
two of them are us,

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:46.550
and Leon and John.

00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:48.666
I've invited 10 people.

00:09:48.666 --> 00:09:50.430
WILL: Yeah, I know some
other people who said

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:51.150
they wanted to join.

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:54.490
So I hope we get some
more people.

00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:57.060
I didn't want to be too
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:58.810
I don't know if that's
appropriate for this hangout.

00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:01.906
But I have a feature list that's
really long right now,

00:10:01.906 --> 00:10:03.520
and I could use some
good help.

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:06.750
So if you want to do some
side work, let me know.

00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:08.310
LES: Yeah.

00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:17.030
There was somebody looking for
it who posted on one of my

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:19.280
links before.

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:21.920
It was Bradley Gogats.

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:22.160
WILL: OK.

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:23.410
I'll look for him.

00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:27.740
LES: He's written to me before,
but I don't know him

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:29.660
or his work.

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:33.795
I'm sure that my comment will
get me feedback, however.

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:40.990
WILL: I appreciate that.

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:42.820
LES: OK.

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:46.180
But that's there.

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:48.040
Let's see.

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:49.960
OK.

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:51.010
WILL: I have a question.

00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:53.300
LES: Sure.

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:56.300
WILL: This might be just my
stupidity, but in my app, I

00:10:56.300 --> 00:11:01.920
cannot put tags or keywords into
the description page on

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:05.240
my app for the market.

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:07.470
Is that something that I'm
just missing, or is there

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:11.850
going to be tags that we're
going to be add soon?

00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:14.920
I just put keywords in my
description, which was kind of

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:17.050
clunkey, and I don't know if
that's something that would be

00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:17.670
frowned upon.

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:23.070
But I'm trying to get as much
attraction as I can to it.

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:26.370
LES: You know, we reviewed
your app.

00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:31.986
And I'm not sure why it hasn't
been featured yet.

00:11:31.986 --> 00:11:33.414
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE] say?

00:11:33.414 --> 00:11:35.320
MEGA: Is it [INAUDIBLE]?

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:36.229
LES: Yeah.

00:11:36.229 --> 00:11:37.479
MEGA: [INAUDIBLE PHRASE]

00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:43.170
LES: OK. so we're going to
review it again today.

00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:43.900
WILL: OK, awesome.

00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:47.060
I did some tweaks on the
UI over the weekend.

00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:49.400
So hopefully, that's going to
be able to push it over.

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:51.050
LES: Yeah.

00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:57.540
It should definitely be
going because it seems

00:11:57.540 --> 00:11:58.430
like a great app.

00:11:58.430 --> 00:11:59.760
So--

00:11:59.760 --> 00:11:59.970
WILL: Excellent.

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:01.320
Thank you very much.

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:02.240
LES: OK.

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:03.920
All right.

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:07.430
I presume just out of the
block that Paul doesn't

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:08.680
actually have any questions.

00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:15.840
So John had a whole bunch
of questions.

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:19.330
They were mostly user questions
as I remember.

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:20.140
JOHN: Yeah.

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:23.160
probably so.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:26.050
I think one of my main questions
is the integration

00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:31.300
of YouTube remote, and
the YouTube app.

00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:35.420
It was until very recently based
primarily on the old

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:38.940
YouTube Leanback interface.

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:41.850
And they've been kind of taking
some stabs at getting

00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:46.580
the tossing of content to and
from the TV to your remote

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:50.430
device a little bit better, but
it's still pretty rough.

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:53.242
And that seems to be a key point
of better integration.

00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:58.290
I'm just kind of raising
the flag on that.

00:12:58.290 --> 00:13:01.610
There's all sorts of potential
there, and it doesn't seem

00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:03.600
like it's getting a
lot of attention.

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:03.980
LES: Yeah.

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:07.210
That kind of stuff, you
should probably--

00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:13.180
there's another hangout that
happens every week with the

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:15.330
product management.

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:16.130
JOHN: OK.

00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:19.020
LES: And they're the ones to
tell that to, and that would

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:26.830
be Rishi Chandra, or
AK, or any of the

00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:30.550
product management folks.

00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:33.590
They're the ones to give that
kind of feedback to.

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:40.690
I'm going to just read some
questions I think, and see

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:44.490
what we get just because--

00:13:47.815 --> 00:13:49.065
OK.

00:13:56.810 --> 00:14:05.240
So Chris is asking a couple
of questions.

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:11.180
So the first is, wants to enable
NDK for Google TV.

00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:13.150
Don't hold your breath.

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:16.360
My guess is that it won't
be any time soon.

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:22.750
Part of the reason is that
when we added Chrome, we

00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:24.130
changed some of the libraries.

00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:27.980
And so we're not in a compatible
environment.

00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:33.530
We're working to get that fixed,
but it'll be a bit.

00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:36.760
The other thing is when are
we coming to Canada?

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:47.160
And I'm doing an event in Canada
to prepare developers

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:56.490
for Google TV. So if you're
there and you're in Toronto,

00:14:56.490 --> 00:14:59.610
look through my stream because
I'm going to start inviting

00:14:59.610 --> 00:15:01.910
folks in a little bit.

00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:05.500
But there's still room.

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:08.360
And I'm actually doing several
events in Toronto.

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:11.950
But that's the one
we're putting up.

00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:14.410
Also, you mentioned YouTube.

00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:20.670
We're going to be doing a invite
only event at South by

00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:24.950
Southwest. And if you've got
content on YouTube, and you

00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:30.962
want to access it from an
Android app, send me a note,

00:15:30.962 --> 00:15:36.020
and we'd be happy
to talk to you.

00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:40.520
But you've got be at South
by Southwest. That

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:41.770
addresses the Canada.

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:52.300
Chris also says he wants to
learn to be a developer.

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:57.890
So the place to do that is
developers.google.com/tv.

00:15:57.890 --> 00:16:00.540
MALE SPEAKER: There is another
one which is [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:03.850
When will the Google TV add-ons
be available for

00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:08.930
Windows or OSX from
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:14.100
So that's unfortunately some
misconception that I've heard

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:17.970
on another forum where people
were saying they can't develop

00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:21.180
for Google TV because they don't
have a Linux machine.

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:25.880
And unfortunately, I think this
is because our emulator

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:29.230
does not work on anything
other than Linux.

00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:33.040
What I usually say is for
development itself, you just

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:37.180
need a regular machine, Windows
OSX is just fine.

00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:39.370
You need the Android SDK.

00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:41.303
The Google TV add-on
only really only

00:16:41.303 --> 00:16:42.940
gives you the emulator.

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:46.250
If you are developing apps with
the intention of putting

00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:50.770
them in market, you really need
a hardware device anyway.

00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:53.570
I would like to see the one
application that somebody has

00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:56.800
developed that they've never
tested on a real hardware

00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:00.030
device and then it actually
worked flawlessly.

00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:04.240
So I think for, I want to say,
getting your feet wet, playing

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:08.050
around, the emulator
is a great tool.

00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:12.329
Supplementing development, it
gives you a nice way to test

00:17:12.329 --> 00:17:15.589
different screen resolutions,
play around, get some quick

00:17:15.589 --> 00:17:17.780
feedback, the emulator
is useful.

00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:21.530
But for real development, you
need at least one of the

00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:24.300
actual hardware devices.

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:26.010
LES: OK.

00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:27.260
Let's see.

00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:33.220
Will a source be available for
people to start making home

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:37.590
brew versions of Google TV
and standalone boxes?

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:42.440
Surely, that would do wonders
for global proliferation.

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:44.040
Discuss.

00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:46.700
That was from Magnus.

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:53.480
OK, so the Google TV
fundamentals are Open Sourced.

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:59.880
The problem is that Google TV
consists of the Android Open

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:05.945
Source project, plus some
private source not Open

00:18:05.945 --> 00:18:11.550
Sourceable plus apps.

00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:16.540
And so what we're making
available to--

00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:19.620
we're in the process of making
some of the apps available to

00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:29.010
the OEMs who only want to have
Android-only television sets.

00:18:29.010 --> 00:18:32.426
And they will be part of the
standard Android app set that

00:18:32.426 --> 00:18:33.950
an OEM can pick up.

00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:38.880
Eventually--

00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:46.960
that's probably as much as
I can say about that.

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:50.710
You want to take the next
one, Christian?

00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:51.960
CHRISTIAN: Sure.

00:18:53.752 --> 00:18:54.990
Which one is the next one?

00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:57.680
MALE SPEAKER: Ali Nadoff.

00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:59.180
CHRISTIAN: Let's see.

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:03.860
One request. It seems that each
week, either through the

00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:06.330
comments here or during the
hangout, a number of questions

00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:08.280
are raised that you or someone
else in the side

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:09.530
breaks to look into.

00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:14.294
Unfortunately, it's
very rare to hear

00:19:14.294 --> 00:19:16.540
anything back on those.

00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:19.730
Would be possible for you to
take some action items onto

00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:23.295
yourself, and your teams first
start with giving some updates

00:19:23.295 --> 00:19:25.520
on previous action items?

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:26.330
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:29.220
So basically more of
a report style.

00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:32.470
I think if you have some issues
that really need that

00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:37.480
sort of tracking, it's best just
to use our forums, or use

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:41.040
Stack Overflow for technical
questions.

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:43.560
The hangout, it's really more
of a, I want to say, an

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:45.290
informal thing.

00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:49.220
There is a lot of requests that
we get from developers,

00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:52.350
which we raise at the
appropriate times with our

00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:53.500
development team.

00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:57.010
So for example, when they come
and they prioritize the next

00:19:57.010 --> 00:20:00.460
version with which features
should go in, it's good for us

00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:04.530
if we can bring real
world examples.

00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:11.120
We can say hey, if you enable
feature x, be it overlays on

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:16.480
live TV, or be it things like
NDK, here is the five killer

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:18.360
apps that you will get for it.

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:20.830
So it's not like a immediate.

00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:22.775
It's not like OK, next
week we will tell you

00:20:22.775 --> 00:20:24.170
when we have NDK.

00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:29.485
But it's more like OK, if we
get asked from our team, is

00:20:29.485 --> 00:20:32.580
anybody really actually caring
about NDK, or how does NDK

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:35.170
compare to other stuff?

00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:38.220
Then we can give them the
feedback, and we say hey, we

00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:40.430
really hear this a lot from
developers and it would make a

00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:41.560
big difference.

00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:46.200
Also, the Google TV issue
tracker launched last week.

00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:52.612
MEGA: Yeah, so I wanted to add
that with some of the features

00:20:52.612 --> 00:20:57.370
what Chris said are coming to
you, it's better to log them

00:20:57.370 --> 00:21:01.720
in the issue tracker and if it's
on [INAUDIBLE], star it.

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:05.420
So the more the number of stars
it has the higher the

00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:06.670
priority it is.

00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:10.040
LES: Yeah.

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:14.460
Everything at Google works
on voting and feedback.

00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:17.470
So this is the issue tracker.

00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:21.095
What is the URL for that?

00:21:21.095 --> 00:21:22.345
MEGA: code.google.com/
p/googletv-issues.

00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:28.168
LES: So that's code.google.com/

00:21:28.168 --> 00:21:29.418
p/googletv-issues.

00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:40.980
So real important.

00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:44.273
That's the best way to ask
for features, report a

00:21:44.273 --> 00:21:50.000
bug, track a bug.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:50.820
Let's see.

00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:55.530
OK, so I'm going to go to
Leon because he's there.

00:21:55.530 --> 00:22:01.860
I've invited, by the way, this
nice person from Google TV

00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:05.710
developers, or Google
TV friends.

00:22:08.810 --> 00:22:10.550
He hasn't yet shown up.

00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:17.250
OK, Leon.

00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:19.260
You've just got a couple
more questions.

00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:20.260
LEON: Yeah.

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:23.640
And a few more that isn't
in your post.

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:27.940
So regarding the fact that there
isn't really SD storage

00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:32.740
on the current devices, are
there any plans on using maybe

00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:35.070
USB to compensate for that?

00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:37.820
Do you kind of use that as
a place for storing apps?

00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:41.120
And kind of moving forward, from
a development point of

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:45.390
view, are the platforms moving
to a point that they will have

00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:52.640
SD card slots or increased
storage for apps or not?

00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:55.270
LES: Most of the platforms
actually do have

00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:56.935
some external storage.

00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:06.970
It's sort of simulated out of
the existing format of Fat 32,

00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:09.870
so a tiny drive.

00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:11.232
You will want to--

00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:16.500
you'll get the extra storage.

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:19.930
So your apps can certainly
use it.

00:23:19.930 --> 00:23:23.763
As far as putting apps on
it, I have not tried.

00:23:23.763 --> 00:23:27.450
So I can't really comment
about that.

00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:27.642
LEON: Yeah.

00:23:27.642 --> 00:23:29.790
I couldn't figure that out
because it doesn't seem to be

00:23:29.790 --> 00:23:34.160
like the phones, where you could
specify use SD storage

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:34.790
for the apps.

00:23:34.790 --> 00:23:36.450
I didn't see that anywhere,
at least from a

00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:38.770
user point of view.

00:23:38.770 --> 00:23:40.800
The point I'm trying to make
is just that it's quite

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:41.760
limited at the moment.

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:46.070
It's like 500 and something
meg to store all the apps,

00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:48.460
which puts a limit on
the number of apps.

00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:51.870
But also what the apps
themselves can store within

00:23:51.870 --> 00:23:55.210
that internal storage.

00:23:55.210 --> 00:23:58.350
So if the app wanted to cache
to have some more local

00:23:58.350 --> 00:24:02.490
storage, that is quite limited
at this phase.

00:24:02.490 --> 00:24:08.320
LES: I thought that it's
different for different OEMs.

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:11.300
LEON: It looked the same
to me, between the

00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:12.350
Logitech and the Sony.

00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:15.200
They look the same.

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:17.240
So in terms of moving forward,
is that kind of

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:18.560
how it would be?

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:21.800
You're not seeing new platforms
that have SD slots

00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:25.280
in it, for example.

00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:26.155
LES: Christian?

00:24:26.155 --> 00:24:27.430
CHRISTIAN: That's
an OEM question.

00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:31.480
So from the boxes that
we have today, no.

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:34.392
I don't know what the plans
are, going forward.

00:24:34.392 --> 00:24:39.610
But I could imagine that USB
storage is probably the more

00:24:39.610 --> 00:24:41.270
popular choice.

00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:42.550
LEON: Yeah, that makes sense.

00:24:42.550 --> 00:24:44.840
It's just that it seems the
system isn't set up to kind of

00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:50.522
just flip to that or extend the
internal one for the apps.

00:24:50.522 --> 00:24:52.520
Is that also an OEM choice?

00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:55.190
It's not something that Google
TV can say if there is

00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:59.550
something, then the user can
maybe toggle that and say use

00:24:59.550 --> 00:25:01.245
that for storage, app storage.

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:10.470
CHRISTIAN: So I don't know
what the plans are.

00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:13.560
It's another one of those
features where we can raise it

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:19.790
with the engineering team, but
it has not been very high on

00:25:19.790 --> 00:25:23.441
the agenda right now.

00:25:23.441 --> 00:25:23.924
LEON: OK.

00:25:23.924 --> 00:25:25.174
Thanks.

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:36.140
LES: I'm trying to add Google TV
friends who has questions.

00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:42.790
But let's see, Will has a
couple of questions too.

00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:47.720
So we can go back to--

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:52.775
oh, and Will even wrote his from
his developer partner.

00:25:52.775 --> 00:25:56.890
The other developers or Google
TV can recommend developing

00:25:56.890 --> 00:26:00.030
testing on the Android
X86 platform.

00:26:00.030 --> 00:26:05.590
If so, is it possible to cut
the TV resolution on an

00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:10.390
Android X86 VM under
Virtual Box?

00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:13.430
I develop on an actual
device myself.

00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:17.110
But that is part of the search
for better emulators.

00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:26.630
What I'd like to your partner
to do is write me.

00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:27.880
AUDIENCE: Gotcha.

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:33.920
LES: The fundamental
rule of thumb is--

00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:40.320
yeah, write me.

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:41.610
I almost said it.

00:26:41.610 --> 00:26:45.360
I'm not going to say it because
I'm publishing these.

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:47.455
WILL: He's watching you right
now, so he'll write to you.

00:26:47.455 --> 00:26:47.920
LES: OK.

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:49.170
Cool.

00:26:51.175 --> 00:26:51.640
Yeah.

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:54.480
MALE SPEAKER: So I actually
had a question for Will.

00:26:54.480 --> 00:27:03.340
So Will, you posted that the
market search shows apps which

00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:08.010
are not Google TV specific,
before applications that are

00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:11.000
Google TV specific
in the market.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.600
I'm not quite sure what you mean
with Google TV specific.

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:20.190
So technically, every app which
does not require touch

00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:22.610
screen shows up.

00:27:22.610 --> 00:27:26.240
Are you referring to apps which
actually require the

00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:27.755
Google TV feature?

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:32.460
WILL: This might be a little bit
outdated, but I know that

00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:36.380
within the last couple weeks
I've searched for apps and

00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:38.430
they will install.

00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:41.150
And then once they start up,
they will require portrait

00:27:41.150 --> 00:27:44.400
mode, which is not going to be
supported on the Google TV. So

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:48.690
that's mainly the ones
that I've seen.

00:27:48.690 --> 00:27:51.140
The other requirement that you
speak of, I think correctly

00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:52.011
blocks them.

00:27:52.011 --> 00:27:57.760
But I know that I've installed
portrait-only apps, and then

00:27:57.760 --> 00:27:59.850
when I start the app
they don't--

00:27:59.850 --> 00:28:02.660
obviously, they're not
going to work.

00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:05.450
MALE SPEAKER: So that is
actually one thing that we

00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:10.160
have changed in the market
plan for the OTA version.

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:15.470
So the market client will
actually filter out apps which

00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:16.640
declare portrait mode.

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:19.855
So there's two ways to require
portrait mode.

00:28:19.855 --> 00:28:23.655
One is if you can have it on
the manifest, explicitly

00:28:23.655 --> 00:28:26.790
declare, those we
can filter out.

00:28:26.790 --> 00:28:29.460
And then there's others
who do it at run time.

00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:32.420
Those we still can't filter
out, unfortunately.

00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:36.530
But we are trying to limit the
number of apps that show up

00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:38.820
that require portrait mode.

00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:41.260
WILL: That's some really
good news.

00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:43.290
It's frustrating to see an app
that comes up above something

00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:47.444
that's specifically written for
Google TV. So I'm glad you

00:28:47.444 --> 00:28:48.694
guys are working on it.

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:59.400
LES: OK, Dustin writes,
assuming I

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:01.620
can read this properly.

00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:03.960
How do we submit an
app for review?

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:06.480
Just released one
a few days ago.

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:11.110
Any chance to get an example of
how to hook the search API

00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:13.690
while watching live TV?

00:29:13.690 --> 00:29:17.600
I think most develops would
love to see this.

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:20.095
OK, so let's talk about
both of those.

00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:28.795
One is send us your
package address.

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:35.170
A good place to send it
is googletv-android

00:29:35.170 --> 00:29:44.250
@googlegroups.com, or if you
have my email address do that.

00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:50.090
But I'd much rather it come to
the group email address.

00:29:52.850 --> 00:29:55.900
And we'll review it.

00:29:55.900 --> 00:30:00.610
And then the other thing Dustin
was asking was the

00:30:00.610 --> 00:30:02.730
search API.

00:30:02.730 --> 00:30:08.130
So that's best if you actually
join the hangout and clarify

00:30:08.130 --> 00:30:17.160
what you're asking, because the
search button is a global

00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:20.800
search for Google TV. It works
while you're in a hangout--

00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:24.940
or excuse me, it works while
you're watching live TV. It's

00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:26.190
global, it works everywhere.

00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:35.000
But the user has to enable
your app for search.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:44.820
So one thing you can do is on
launch, or include a menu item

00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:49.660
somewhere that says enable for
search that brings up the

00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:53.450
preference pane that
they have to click

00:30:53.450 --> 00:30:55.290
to enable that provider.

00:30:55.290 --> 00:30:59.710
But they have to do an explicit
action to enable the

00:30:59.710 --> 00:31:00.960
search provider.

00:31:03.970 --> 00:31:10.430
And I think that's as far as I
can answer questions on this.

00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:11.940
MALE SPEAKER: Hey, Les,
can you restate

00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:12.870
that question again.

00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:14.840
I'm not sure if I heard it all,
and I'm not sure if I

00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:17.000
might have something to add.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.260
LES: OK.

00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:20.990
Sure.

00:31:20.990 --> 00:31:22.440
This was from Dustin.

00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:37.690
Any chance to get an example of
how to hook the search API

00:31:37.690 --> 00:31:41.520
while watching live TV. I think
most developers would

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:42.770
love to see this.

00:31:48.210 --> 00:31:48.650
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:31:48.650 --> 00:31:48.890
Yeah.

00:31:48.890 --> 00:31:50.720
I don't think I have
anything yet.

00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:52.491
LES: OK.

00:31:52.491 --> 00:32:00.428
We do have some search API
sample code, don't we?

00:32:00.428 --> 00:32:02.470
MEGA: It's not published.

00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:04.060
MALE SPEAKER: It's not
published yet.

00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:08.515
MEGA: It was the search
suggestions sample code that I

00:32:08.515 --> 00:32:11.990
[INAUDIBLE] as the Android.

00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:12.320
LES: OK.

00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:19.260
So look at the Android search
provider sample codes.

00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:21.602
MEGA: Calls a dictionary
app on the [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:26.794
LES: Dictionary app.

00:32:26.794 --> 00:32:27.550
OK.

00:32:27.550 --> 00:32:29.420
Any other live questions?

00:32:32.130 --> 00:32:33.150
LEON: Yeah, a few more.

00:32:33.150 --> 00:32:34.100
LES: OK.

00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:36.550
Let me put you up.

00:32:36.550 --> 00:32:38.700
LEON: So I'm going to raise
this again, and I did last

00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:41.170
week, but the market app.

00:32:41.170 --> 00:32:43.703
The continuous issue there.

00:32:43.703 --> 00:32:45.100
In fact, I've got
a problem now.

00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:47.650
It's happened to me with
one of the apps.

00:32:47.650 --> 00:32:52.250
The NBA app, which is one of
the system installed ones.

00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:56.575
It's stuck in a mode on all my
devices where it keeps sending

00:32:56.575 --> 00:32:58.970
me a notification there's an
update available, and every

00:32:58.970 --> 00:33:01.790
time I try it I actually get the
message that sometimes it

00:33:01.790 --> 00:33:03.960
says it's updating, but
it's not really.

00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:06.170
Sometimes it's updating
and throwing a

00:33:06.170 --> 00:33:08.010
message, an error message.

00:33:08.010 --> 00:33:10.850
But it never gets to a point
where it really updates.

00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:14.070
So it's stuck in that mode, and
even a reboot of the box

00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:17.050
doesn't seem to fix
that at all.

00:33:17.050 --> 00:33:19.410
So I'm just raising it again,
because I'm also hearing it

00:33:19.410 --> 00:33:20.050
from my users.

00:33:20.050 --> 00:33:25.030
They're experiencing market
related issues.

00:33:25.030 --> 00:33:25.410
LES: OK.

00:33:25.410 --> 00:33:29.140
So the update should have
fixed some of that.

00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:31.150
Have you gotten an update--

00:33:31.150 --> 00:33:32.030
LEON: No, not yet.

00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:33.030
I checked this morning.

00:33:33.030 --> 00:33:34.920
It's not on my device yet.

00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:37.090
LES: OK.

00:33:37.090 --> 00:33:39.190
Feel free to send me an
email with the Mac

00:33:39.190 --> 00:33:41.050
address of your device.

00:33:41.050 --> 00:33:43.550
Actually, wait till tomorrow.

00:33:43.550 --> 00:33:44.980
Wait till Friday.

00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:48.710
If you haven't gotten
it by Friday--

00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:50.730
yeah.

00:33:50.730 --> 00:33:55.250
I can kick things to accelerate
it, but in the

00:33:55.250 --> 00:34:00.050
middle of an OTA I don't
want to do that.

00:34:00.050 --> 00:34:03.210
So let's wait till Friday
and see what happens.

00:34:03.210 --> 00:34:06.060
OK, next.

00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:10.256
LEON: Yeah, and the other issue
is about regarding some

00:34:10.256 --> 00:34:13.909
of the discussions we've had
about how to categorize or

00:34:13.909 --> 00:34:15.354
feature an app like mine.

00:34:15.354 --> 00:34:19.340
Have you guys thought about
it more, because of the

00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:21.160
multi-device issue?

00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:24.969
LES: I will bring
Jen next week.

00:34:24.969 --> 00:34:32.540
She is off skiing I think,
which makes it difficult.

00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:37.630
But she's the one who
can talk about it.

00:34:37.630 --> 00:34:45.659
I think we are planning to
feature able remote.

00:34:45.659 --> 00:34:45.870
MALE SPEAKER: Yup.

00:34:45.870 --> 00:34:47.090
It's in the works.

00:34:47.090 --> 00:34:48.010
Yeah It's in the process.

00:34:48.010 --> 00:34:52.219
LES: It's in the process
of getting done.

00:34:52.219 --> 00:34:53.800
LEON: So how would
users find it?

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:55.989
Would it just be the
features list?

00:34:55.989 --> 00:34:56.250
LES: OK.

00:34:56.250 --> 00:35:04.590
What happens when we feature
is there are the Hero apps,

00:35:04.590 --> 00:35:06.470
that have a banner
and all that.

00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:07.820
LEON: Oh, right at
the top, yeah.

00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:08.030
LES: Yeah.

00:35:08.030 --> 00:35:09.365
They're right at the top.

00:35:12.430 --> 00:35:16.240
I'm not sure that'll make it.

00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:20.610
But definitely have one of
those, so that if we decide to

00:35:20.610 --> 00:35:24.830
do it, you're able
to be there.

00:35:27.470 --> 00:35:33.810
Then there are the seven apps
that are below that.

00:35:33.810 --> 00:35:40.660
And then there are 50 or 60
staff picks that you click.

00:35:43.650 --> 00:35:48.260
So that will be the next click,

00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:50.930
and that's what happens.

00:35:50.930 --> 00:35:56.570
And usually from that, that'll
bump your numbers so that when

00:35:56.570 --> 00:36:00.040
you go into your categories,
you'll start appearing very

00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:02.780
near the front in
the category.

00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:07.800
LEON: So you're not thinking
of adding a new category,

00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:11.990
because currently, I've got it
in the generic tools category,

00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:15.060
which is kind of humongous in
terms of what's in there.

00:36:17.810 --> 00:36:24.130
LES: No, at this point, our
hands are kind of tied.

00:36:24.130 --> 00:36:27.625
Try to work within everything
that Android has given us.

00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:36.320
It is not our place
to influence that.

00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:39.510
That's a bigger train than us.

00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:43.320
MALE SPEAKER: One thing that Jen
might be able to help you

00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:47.670
with is there is a Sony Select,
and I believe there's

00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:52.370
something similar on Logitech,
which is sort of the staff

00:36:52.370 --> 00:36:54.560
picks for those guys,
for Sony.

00:36:57.090 --> 00:37:00.810
Maybe talk with some of their
business development guys, and

00:37:00.810 --> 00:37:03.632
point them to your app.

00:37:03.632 --> 00:37:04.000
LES: Yeah.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.685
Sony has a developer program.

00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:16.790
It may be developers.sony.com.

00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:20.580
But if you just Google it.

00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:27.300
I'd recommend all of you that
are developing should be a

00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:28.550
part of the program.

00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:34.095
Let's see.

00:37:34.095 --> 00:37:39.018
Google TV friends joined
us, so hi.

00:37:42.305 --> 00:37:43.370
AUDIENCE: How's it goin'?

00:37:43.370 --> 00:37:43.860
LES: Oh good.

00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:46.880
It unmuted you, because I had
muted you when you joined.

00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:51.120
AUDIENCE: I just have
a couple questions.

00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:54.850
One of them is mostly from users
in my circle of friends,

00:37:54.850 --> 00:37:56.140
whatever they are.

00:37:56.140 --> 00:38:00.415
In the market, I was just
looking, you have Plenty of

00:38:00.415 --> 00:38:03.750
Fish, the dating service,
which is featured or top

00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:04.740
three, whatever it is.

00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:05.685
That's fine.

00:38:05.685 --> 00:38:08.880
But if you scroll through the
social area down at the

00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:12.390
bottom, there's two guys, two

00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:15.390
developers, FavApps and NetAppers.

00:38:15.390 --> 00:38:18.740
In the last two weeks, they've
put in over 75 applications

00:38:18.740 --> 00:38:22.550
for like booty calls,
and sexy singles,

00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:24.710
find sex in your area.

00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:26.780
And a lot of people
don't think--

00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:29.780
they think that doesn't belong
on the Google TV. Especially

00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:32.260
that many apps in such
a short time.

00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:34.500
LES: We'll look into it.

00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:35.820
It's in social?

00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:36.660
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:38:36.660 --> 00:38:37.360
LES: OK.

00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:38.612
Yeah.

00:38:38.612 --> 00:38:40.375
AUDIENCE: And that's, like I
said, that's within the last

00:38:40.375 --> 00:38:43.090
two weeks, that many
apps showing up.

00:38:43.090 --> 00:38:43.820
LES: Yeah.

00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:45.100
Obviously we're getting
spammed.

00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:52.290
We haven't had to deal
with this yet.

00:38:52.290 --> 00:38:54.720
But I can guarantee you,
we will have a

00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:56.780
conversation about it today.

00:38:56.780 --> 00:39:01.080
And beyond that I can't
tell you much.

00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:06.090
But Google's general policy
is one of not censoring.

00:39:06.090 --> 00:39:12.085
But I think Android has a
secondary policy around that.

00:39:12.085 --> 00:39:12.430
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:39:12.430 --> 00:39:15.550
It's like every day he throws
out a new app with a new

00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:17.670
picture on it and just
changes the name.

00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:23.880
LES: I will send a note to
somewhere else also.

00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:26.495
Something will happen shortly.

00:39:26.495 --> 00:39:28.290
MALE SPEAKER: You can also
double-check that they

00:39:28.290 --> 00:39:31.865
actually classified it properly
as, whatever, mature

00:39:31.865 --> 00:39:34.735
content or whatever
it should be.

00:39:34.735 --> 00:39:35.186
LES: Yeah.

00:39:35.186 --> 00:39:37.750
AUDIENCE: And the other question
would be, within the

00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:40.536
market, can we get like a--

00:39:40.536 --> 00:39:42.420
you have top three
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]--

00:39:42.420 --> 00:39:46.050
can we get a paid section where
a lot of the apps that

00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:48.315
you have to buy, they don't show
up in the market unless

00:39:48.315 --> 00:39:49.900
you search for them.

00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:52.730
There's top three, then
there's the features.

00:39:52.730 --> 00:39:57.970
But there's nothing actually to
buy it, to pay for an app.

00:39:57.970 --> 00:40:01.665
The one new app that just came
out this week, I believe it

00:40:01.665 --> 00:40:04.730
doesn't show up because it costs
$2.99, so you actually

00:40:04.730 --> 00:40:09.345
have to search for it in
order to get on a TV.

00:40:09.345 --> 00:40:12.410
LES: What's the name
of the app?

00:40:12.410 --> 00:40:17.960
AUDIENCE: Twitter for TV or
TV suites for Google TV.

00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:21.184
MALE SPEAKER: I think I recently
reviewed that one and

00:40:21.184 --> 00:40:25.270
it wasn't supported
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:26.520
LES: So it's got issues.

00:40:31.601 --> 00:40:32.590
AUDIENCE: That's it for me.

00:40:32.590 --> 00:40:33.380
You can mute me again.

00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:34.930
I'm just here to listen.

00:40:34.930 --> 00:40:36.390
LES: OK. cool.

00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:40.570
We're obviously not
filling up today.

00:40:40.570 --> 00:40:50.380
So Paul has just IM'd me
a Sony developer link.

00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:58.370
It's www.sonydeveloper.com,
which is migrating to

00:40:58.370 --> 00:40:59.650
developer.sony.com tonight.

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:04.815
And there's also
developer.sonyericsson.com.

00:41:09.738 --> 00:41:16.315
So let's see, you now
know about that.

00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:21.810
All right.

00:41:21.810 --> 00:41:29.250
Oh, and we still
have it there.

00:41:29.250 --> 00:41:37.680
All right, why don't you read
one, Christian, and then we'll

00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:39.020
go back to Leon.

00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:40.666
CHRISTIAN: I'll let
you read one.

00:41:40.666 --> 00:41:41.970
I might answer it.

00:41:41.970 --> 00:41:44.344
Actually, I'm on my way
to my next meeting.

00:41:44.344 --> 00:41:45.270
LES: OK.

00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:45.810
Got it.

00:41:45.810 --> 00:41:46.280
All right.

00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:46.980
Cool.

00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:49.200
And Dustin got it.

00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:54.460
OK, any ETA on Adobe
AIR availability?

00:41:54.460 --> 00:41:56.910
CHRISTIAN: Don't hold
your breath.

00:41:56.910 --> 00:42:00.601
LES: I think that's
pretty much--

00:42:00.601 --> 00:42:03.230
CHRISTIAN: I mean I hate to say
never, but it gets pretty

00:42:03.230 --> 00:42:05.790
close to it.

00:42:05.790 --> 00:42:06.920
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:13.900
Basically, Adobe has withdrawn
support for it, and

00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:15.240
we have to do it.

00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:16.530
There's got to be a
reason to do it.

00:42:16.530 --> 00:42:18.560
And really--

00:42:23.310 --> 00:42:25.220
Yeah, we'll stay with
Christian's

00:42:25.220 --> 00:42:27.820
don't hold your breath.

00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:33.585
OK, I think Leon and Will
both have questions.

00:42:36.990 --> 00:42:40.420
So let's go with Leon and
then I'll go back to

00:42:40.420 --> 00:42:41.820
Will if he's got one.

00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:42.920
Thanks, Christian.

00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:44.190
CHRISTIAN: Thank you.

00:42:44.190 --> 00:42:47.190
Bye guys.

00:42:47.190 --> 00:42:52.930
LEON: It's actually related to
the previous question about

00:42:52.930 --> 00:42:57.690
how will Google TV handle
parental control?

00:42:57.690 --> 00:42:59.793
LES: [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:42:59.793 --> 00:43:01.902
The door was closing
as you said it.

00:43:01.902 --> 00:43:05.060
LEON: Parental controls
on Google TV, what's

00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:07.360
the plan for that?

00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:09.390
LES: What kind of controls?

00:43:09.390 --> 00:43:10.260
LEON: Parental control.

00:43:10.260 --> 00:43:11.510
LES: Parental control, sorry.

00:43:18.330 --> 00:43:21.276
I don't know the
answer to that.

00:43:21.276 --> 00:43:22.526
MEGA: [INAUDIBLE PHRASE]

00:43:24.940 --> 00:43:30.980
LES: Well TV and movies
very much have

00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:33.580
parental controls in it.

00:43:33.580 --> 00:43:39.000
You can set settings to only
show certain ratings.

00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:48.630
There are apps that do
parental controls.

00:43:48.630 --> 00:43:52.390
But I don't know if you
can lock out market.

00:43:52.390 --> 00:43:54.420
LEON: Yeah, I was kind of
imagining from a consumer

00:43:54.420 --> 00:43:56.450
point of view, they would
probably want to go to one

00:43:56.450 --> 00:43:59.760
screen and say these
are the controls,

00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:00.650
I want you to enforce.

00:44:00.650 --> 00:44:03.530
And then somehow that will
be managed across the

00:44:03.530 --> 00:44:04.780
system and the apps.

00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:13.910
LES: A reasonable thing, and
I see it on my phone, so we

00:44:13.910 --> 00:44:15.910
should eventually get it.

00:44:15.910 --> 00:44:19.462
But that would be a good thing
to write as an issue.

00:44:19.462 --> 00:44:20.326
LEON: OK.

00:44:20.326 --> 00:44:23.486
I'll do that.

00:44:23.486 --> 00:44:25.120
LES: All right.

00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:29.900
And I'll ask Will if he's got
a question, and then I'll

00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:33.926
probably just pop back
between you two.

00:44:33.926 --> 00:44:34.400
WILL: Yeah.

00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:36.660
My question, I'm not sure if
you can answer it, but it's

00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:40.040
about the number of active users
that are using Google

00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:41.260
TV. I know--

00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:43.005
LES: I actually have
a rap for that.

00:44:43.005 --> 00:44:43.620
WILL: All right.

00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:45.020
Let's hear it.

00:44:45.020 --> 00:44:49.830
LES: So the first answer is
I saw that post and I

00:44:49.830 --> 00:44:51.420
was like, oh, OK.

00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:54.770
I almost decided to
lead with that.

00:44:54.770 --> 00:44:59.790
But it's good that it's now.

00:44:59.790 --> 00:45:04.290
OK, so I can't give you
any numbers today.

00:45:04.290 --> 00:45:08.190
Even if I had the numbers I'd
have to be reading them just

00:45:08.190 --> 00:45:09.440
to make sure they're accurate.

00:45:12.410 --> 00:45:17.130
But that's not the question you
really want to be looking

00:45:17.130 --> 00:45:19.100
at right now.

00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:25.100
Google TV is still in
the hockey stick

00:45:25.100 --> 00:45:28.080
portion of its growth.

00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:35.380
We've just added three major
OEMs. One of our OEMs has

00:45:35.380 --> 00:45:41.170
announced that they are planning
to go international

00:45:41.170 --> 00:45:46.790
to double-digit countries.

00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:48.940
I don't know if they've
announced the number, so I'm

00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:52.220
not going to quote
that either.

00:45:52.220 --> 00:45:59.780
But the double-digit number of
country launch, and this year.

00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:10.060
So you can, if you'd like to
estimate market size, which

00:46:10.060 --> 00:46:16.300
I'd rather didn't show up on
blogs, look at downloads for

00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:22.230
apps, including the
installed apps.

00:46:22.230 --> 00:46:23.190
WILL: Right.

00:46:23.190 --> 00:46:25.810
LES: And that might answer
your numbers.

00:46:25.810 --> 00:46:28.100
WILL: Yeah, that's kind of what
this post actually says

00:46:28.100 --> 00:46:30.946
too, the pre-installed apps,
look how many times they're

00:46:30.946 --> 00:46:32.275
downloaded.

00:46:32.275 --> 00:46:36.130
And it just seems like
500,000 to a million.

00:46:36.130 --> 00:46:38.240
That seems like such
a huge number to

00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:40.346
me, but I don't know.

00:46:40.346 --> 00:46:42.510
It's a good number.

00:46:42.510 --> 00:46:44.265
LES: OK.

00:46:44.265 --> 00:46:48.980
It depends on how you compare
it to phones, because phones

00:46:48.980 --> 00:46:52.710
are activating a huge
number a day.

00:46:56.210 --> 00:47:01.520
But that said, we're at the
beginning of Google TV's

00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:03.110
growth cycle.

00:47:03.110 --> 00:47:09.460
When you look at developing,
you want to ask yourself,

00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:12.770
where do I see myself
in the market?

00:47:12.770 --> 00:47:20.440
And am I better off being a tiny
player in a huge market,

00:47:20.440 --> 00:47:23.890
or a bigger player in
a smaller market--

00:47:23.890 --> 00:47:25.336
smaller but growing market?

00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:31.740
And how do you get
your visibility?

00:47:31.740 --> 00:47:38.820
In Google TV, right now is a
great time to get visibility

00:47:38.820 --> 00:47:40.270
and build market share.

00:47:44.740 --> 00:47:51.170
Ah, Mega has pinged me a
parental control thing.

00:47:51.170 --> 00:47:54.386
Perhaps she could put
it into the stream.

00:47:54.386 --> 00:47:55.636
MEGA: [INAUDIBLE PHRASE]

00:47:58.580 --> 00:48:00.950
LES: OK.

00:48:00.950 --> 00:48:03.380
Yeah.

00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:07.030
OK, so anyway, you're
in a growing market.

00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:10.430
So you have a chance to become
a significant player in a

00:48:10.430 --> 00:48:16.140
growing market, and then use
that to leverage into phones

00:48:16.140 --> 00:48:17.390
and tablets.

00:48:20.550 --> 00:48:22.880
But that way you get significant
visibility.

00:48:27.090 --> 00:48:32.160
Leon managed to get some real
serious visibility a couple

00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:35.480
weeks ago when the
nice folks at--

00:48:39.060 --> 00:48:41.580
LEON: geek.com.

00:48:41.580 --> 00:48:42.500
LES: Which one?

00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:43.950
LEON: geek.com.

00:48:43.950 --> 00:48:47.610
LES: geek.com listed him as one
of the top five apps to

00:48:47.610 --> 00:48:59.160
have for Google TV. And he may
or may not have succeeded if

00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:00.980
he had been only a phone app.

00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:09.290
So it's a developing market.

00:49:09.290 --> 00:49:11.302
And that's my rap on that.

00:49:11.302 --> 00:49:12.450
WILL: Got it.

00:49:12.450 --> 00:49:12.810
LES: OK.

00:49:12.810 --> 00:49:18.900
I've got four posts
to my thread, and

00:49:18.900 --> 00:49:20.150
we've got nine minutes.

00:49:22.465 --> 00:49:28.070
Let's see, we have Mega has
posted to the main thread

00:49:28.070 --> 00:49:29.786
about parental controls.

00:49:34.030 --> 00:49:41.900
Alexander has posted that Redux
has got between 50,000

00:49:41.900 --> 00:49:46.390
and 100,000 downloads.

00:49:46.390 --> 00:49:47.640
And he's--

00:49:52.490 --> 00:49:57.450
actually, Redux isn't
a bundled app, so

00:49:57.450 --> 00:49:58.940
your idea is wrong.

00:50:04.210 --> 00:50:05.460
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE PHRASE]

00:50:09.010 --> 00:50:10.010
LES: Yes.

00:50:10.010 --> 00:50:14.100
We will probably release an ARM
emulator before the Vizio

00:50:14.100 --> 00:50:15.350
Sony launch.

00:50:20.210 --> 00:50:21.905
Or whatever Vizio--

00:50:21.905 --> 00:50:26.920
yeah, before any of the ARM
boxes launch, Alexander.

00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:29.600
All right.

00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:31.150
Who's next?

00:50:31.150 --> 00:50:34.510
Leon, I guess.

00:50:34.510 --> 00:50:37.160
LEON: Yes.

00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:38.940
So moving forward from a
developer point of view,

00:50:38.940 --> 00:50:42.660
should we be writing for that
Vizio box as kind of the

00:50:42.660 --> 00:50:45.760
platform to be concentrating
on from a hardware point of

00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:49.230
view, or will there be something
for Marvell that'll

00:50:49.230 --> 00:50:54.765
be maybe pre-release or
developer-oriented box?

00:51:03.050 --> 00:51:04.740
LES: My guess is that--

00:51:11.420 --> 00:51:13.760
I'll find out.

00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:25.860
The Vizio will be the box that
comes out, the Marvell box.

00:51:25.860 --> 00:51:30.340
Vizio is the manufacturer, or
the distributor for Marvell,

00:51:30.340 --> 00:51:31.590
or one of them.

00:51:35.750 --> 00:51:42.870
There is going to be a wider
separation of performance, so

00:51:42.870 --> 00:51:47.970
we announced two or three system
on a chip vendors.

00:51:47.970 --> 00:51:54.420
There's Marvell there
is Media.

00:51:54.420 --> 00:51:55.460
OK.

00:51:55.460 --> 00:51:57.500
There's another one.

00:51:57.500 --> 00:52:01.620
And then LG is doing
their own.

00:52:01.620 --> 00:52:04.190
It's like a bat out of hell.

00:52:04.190 --> 00:52:07.595
And my suspicion that Samsung
will do something itself.

00:52:11.500 --> 00:52:19.820
So Marvell--

00:52:19.820 --> 00:52:23.450
so they're all going to be
different graphics performance

00:52:23.450 --> 00:52:25.070
and processor performance.

00:52:29.190 --> 00:52:30.870
Does that answer
your question?

00:52:30.870 --> 00:52:31.320
LEON: Yeah.

00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:35.520
I guess related to that is kind
of, would be possible for

00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:37.800
us to get our hands on the
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] before they

00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:39.145
are released to consumers?

00:52:41.950 --> 00:52:44.350
LES: I did understand that
part of the question.

00:52:44.350 --> 00:52:46.080
That was the part I
was not answering.

00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:48.190
LEON: OK, sure.

00:52:48.190 --> 00:52:49.475
LES: I don't know the
answer to that.

00:52:53.310 --> 00:52:59.830
Right now, I do still have
a whole lot of Revues.

00:52:59.830 --> 00:53:05.470
And so I'm trying to
help developers

00:53:05.470 --> 00:53:06.720
get started on them.

00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:15.720
Yeah.

00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:16.190
LEON: OK, thanks.

00:53:16.190 --> 00:53:17.440
LES: That's where I'm at.

00:53:20.890 --> 00:53:23.440
OK, we've got five minutes.

00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:26.870
Any burning questions, or I'll
take the last couple

00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:31.900
on the list. OK.

00:53:31.900 --> 00:53:33.520
Let's see what we got here.

00:53:48.340 --> 00:53:54.750
I think I've answered
everybody's questions.

00:53:54.750 --> 00:53:57.030
There is one last
critter here.

00:54:13.860 --> 00:54:18.770
Alexander G. is asking
a question I don't

00:54:18.770 --> 00:54:20.020
know the answer to.

00:54:22.970 --> 00:54:26.190
And it's best to ask this
kind of question when

00:54:26.190 --> 00:54:27.670
we're all in the room.

00:54:27.670 --> 00:54:32.520
But basically he's saying Qbot,
his app, is failing to

00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:35.730
update on Google TV and
some other devices.

00:54:35.730 --> 00:54:39.360
Users are getting a bad signed
certificate error.

00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:42.070
I'm not sure what happened.

00:54:42.070 --> 00:54:46.490
Doesn't the market check the
certs and match when we

00:54:46.490 --> 00:54:48.270
upload a new APK.

00:54:48.270 --> 00:54:50.340
Ideally.

00:54:50.340 --> 00:54:59.770
It's also supposed to check to
make sure that you don't use a

00:54:59.770 --> 00:55:02.310
debug certificate when
you upload to market.

00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:05.970
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I think
it checks for that.

00:55:05.970 --> 00:55:07.590
That's one of the
checks it does.

00:55:07.590 --> 00:55:09.960
It wouldn't even allow
you to enable that.

00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:10.460
LES: Yeah.

00:55:10.460 --> 00:55:11.280
That's what I thought.

00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:12.850
So I'm not sure why--

00:55:15.460 --> 00:55:17.440
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I think
I've seen this error.

00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:19.790
This error is one of the errors
I'm getting with the

00:55:19.790 --> 00:55:22.650
apps that have issues
on the market app.

00:55:22.650 --> 00:55:24.390
One of many errors.

00:55:24.390 --> 00:55:27.440
But this is one I've seen
personally, and then later, it

00:55:27.440 --> 00:55:29.760
either resolved or doesn't
resolve, or

00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:30.980
goes to another error.

00:55:30.980 --> 00:55:32.480
So I just think this is
a market app feature.

00:55:32.480 --> 00:55:34.790
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE]
when they are paid apps.

00:55:34.790 --> 00:55:39.060
LES: Yeah, these are
all paid apps.

00:55:39.060 --> 00:55:43.738
OK, well we should get
it into bug tracker.

00:55:43.738 --> 00:55:44.988
MEGA: [INAUDIBLE PHRASE]

00:55:47.690 --> 00:55:48.120
LES: Yeah.

00:55:48.120 --> 00:55:49.700
If we could get a log from--

00:55:49.700 --> 00:55:55.520
the next time you get it, if
you could an ADB space bug

00:55:55.520 --> 00:55:59.730
report, and pipe the output to
a file and send it to any one

00:55:59.730 --> 00:56:01.548
of us, that would--

00:56:01.548 --> 00:56:06.000
MEGA: [INAUDIBLE] the bug
tracker [INAUDIBLE PHRASE]

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:07.250
LES: Yeah.

00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:12.275
So ADB space bug report.

00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:17.180
OK.

00:56:17.180 --> 00:56:19.330
Thank you all for coming.

00:56:19.330 --> 00:56:20.820
Tell your friends.

00:56:20.820 --> 00:56:24.860
It's nice to have five people on
the hangout, but it's like

00:56:24.860 --> 00:56:27.481
we can have 10.

00:56:27.481 --> 00:56:29.650
We're broadcasting live.

00:56:29.650 --> 00:56:32.880
It's obvious that somebody's
watching the live view.

00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:37.760
But anyway, I'd be happier
with a bigger

00:56:37.760 --> 00:56:39.605
crowd or more questions.

00:56:42.700 --> 00:56:46.870
I hate to invite any of the
engineers when it's only

00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:49.010
really two or three people
asking questions.

00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:59.090
So I'm going to keep it
with just us for now.

00:56:59.090 --> 00:57:06.190
I will do another plug for
my event in Toronto.

00:57:06.190 --> 00:57:07.720
Will, I got your note.

00:57:07.720 --> 00:57:11.250
Yeah, we'll invite you.

00:57:11.250 --> 00:57:15.390
And I'm also going to plug
one more time my South by

00:57:15.390 --> 00:57:16.640
Southwest event.

00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:23.680
If you're interested you need
to write me, and I will send

00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:24.930
you an invite.

00:57:29.810 --> 00:57:33.020
Let's see, any others?

00:57:33.020 --> 00:57:38.640
Tonight at the GTUG in
Silicon Valley, Paul

00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:40.460
Saxton will be talking.

00:57:40.460 --> 00:57:42.780
And that should be a
good presentation.

00:57:42.780 --> 00:57:44.360
Thank you all.

00:57:44.360 --> 00:57:44.930
MALE SPEAKER: Thanks.

00:57:44.930 --> 00:57:46.180
LES: Aloha.

00:57:50.340 --> 00:57:52.090
We have restored the
server connection.

00:57:54.660 --> 00:57:56.560
That's lovely to hear.

00:57:56.560 --> 00:57:57.810
I'm not exactly sure--
