00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.920
The Mangler Function, performs
the bulk of processing in a DES round.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.940
It takes the right half of the input,
expands the 32 bit data

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:15.110
into 48 bit data, and
xor it with a param key.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:20.730
The result is that a 48 bit
value is being substitute

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.060
to a 32 bit value, and
then the result is permutated.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.320
That is, the Mangler Function performs
both substitution and permutation.
