1
00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.540
Now I thought a new intro theme was just the sound of an air conditioner.

2
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.330
Good experience.

3
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.020
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

4
00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:25.030
<v 2>today is,</v>

5
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.610
<v 1>uh,
December 22nd,
2014,</v>

6
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.620
and,
uh,
Joe Cocker died today and fuck man.

7
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.480
Dot.
Dot.
Guy was a bad mother fucker.
I mean,

8
00:00:39.481 --> 00:00:43.080
what a unique singer.
What a powerful personality.

9
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.880
That guy was amazing.
He was so fucking cool to watch that guy sing.

10
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.930
And when John Belushi did his impression assignment live,
do you remember that?

11
00:00:51.931 --> 00:00:56.040
I don't know.
Oh my God,
it was brilliant.
But this is,
this is,
uh,

12
00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.730
Joe Cocker at Woodstock.
So this is like,

13
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.320
I guess this is 1969.
That's when Woodstock was right.
69.

14
00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.600
<v 2>He was just such a unique dude.
Like I can't,</v>

15
00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.220
I can't think of any other singer that came before him or after him that was

16
00:01:15.221 --> 00:01:19.570
like quite like him.
He's so,
he was so Joe cocker,
you know,

17
00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.861
I mean,

18
00:01:20.861 --> 00:01:25.690
it was just like this big sweaty English dude is crazy fucked up hair doing the

19
00:01:25.691 --> 00:01:28.780
air guitar on stage and squeeze notes out of the air guitar that no one else

20
00:01:28.781 --> 00:01:33.160
could.
Yeah.
And it was like he didn't,
you didn't mind it at all,

21
00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.410
like you know what I mean?
Like there's something like inherently do,

22
00:01:35.411 --> 00:01:37.690
she brought the lead singer do an air guitar.
Right.

23
00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.130
<v 1>But these were Maroon five concert.</v>

24
00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.960
I would be throwing water bottles at the stage.

25
00:01:41.961 --> 00:01:44.270
But you feel his energy immediately.

26
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.660
If it was Nickelback there'd be a riot and that'd be right

27
00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.670
<v 0>there cause I fucking loved him
too.</v>

28
00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.610
Yeah.
Yeah,
me too.

29
00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.860
I will sign that acute

30
00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.590
[inaudible]

31
00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.460
<v 1>damn two was good.</v>

32
00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.510
The last from lung cancer,

33
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.730
probably smoking well knows maybe.
Maybe working in bars.
You know,

34
00:02:44.731 --> 00:02:47.100
I was talking to someone at the comedy store the other day.

35
00:02:47.101 --> 00:02:52.101
We were talking about this how it's amazing how no comedy clubs have smoking

36
00:02:52.321 --> 00:02:56.310
anymore.
Like it used to be when we started,
every comedy club you would go to,

37
00:02:56.311 --> 00:03:00.010
it was like Tupac minimum.
You'd walk in there and just be

38
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.880
<v 3>people constantly puffer to every bar you would go to.
Used to be like that.</v>

39
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.310
Most of the performers to,
yeah.
Yeah.

40
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.760
A lot of the performers and for performers who had quit,

41
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.290
do you know how hard that must be?

42
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.770
If you quit cigarettes and you'd go to a place where everyone's smoking and a

43
00:03:14.771 --> 00:03:15.521
smokes in the air.

44
00:03:15.521 --> 00:03:19.600
So you're essentially taking that nicotine in and it's firing up all those

45
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.220
addictive little pockets that you have that were dormant.
All Kevin.
I see.

46
00:03:24.221 --> 00:03:29.140
Why smoke again?
Oh,
I love it.
I love it.
Like,
no,
no,
no.
We're not smoking.

47
00:03:29.141 --> 00:03:31.690
This is called secondhand smoke.
We're in a bar.
Well let's,
you're kidding you.

48
00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.360
They,
we,
she'd probably kiss,
get along.

49
00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.690
Just get a couple puffs on a little bit.
Tastes so good.

50
00:03:37.691 --> 00:03:40.560
Why don't you just jam a whole bunch in your mouth hole?
Oh,
fun.

51
00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:45.230
What are we on for Kevin?
Let's light this thing.
Let's breathe in.
You know,

52
00:03:45.231 --> 00:03:47.080
it's taken the full dose.

53
00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:49.630
That's what it's like to be at the comedy store when he quit.

54
00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.840
Like every time you quit smoking or quit smoking and then go to the calm to her,

55
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.720
everybody smoking for any comment on the outside.

56
00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.490
But imagine you're up on stage and people are just exalting their appreciation

57
00:04:00.491 --> 00:04:04.660
by blowing things of this addictive chemical right into your nostrils,

58
00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.100
but must be super hard to quit.
And also if they're alcoholics,

59
00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.060
if you're an alcoholic and you're at a comedy club,
like everybody's drinking,

60
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.520
Chappelle still smokes on stage,
he doesn't give a shit.

61
00:04:15.521 --> 00:04:16.770
He'll go right into the comedy story,

62
00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.260
light up a pack of cigarettes and just smoked a whole pack there.
Well,
you know,

63
00:04:20.261 --> 00:04:22.660
you're kind of allowed to onstage.

64
00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.950
I think there's some loophole in the law that allows for you to smoke for a

65
00:04:26.951 --> 00:04:29.650
theatricals under for performance art.
Right?
Or something like that.

66
00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.500
The same reason you're allowed to have power tools in a metal bra and shoots

67
00:04:32.501 --> 00:04:36.760
sparks everywhere and it really cramped studio.
I mean it's performance art.

68
00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:38.800
Well if you had a cigar on stage,

69
00:04:38.801 --> 00:04:41.650
like if you were playing Mark Twain and that was like part of your prop,

70
00:04:41.651 --> 00:04:45.490
you had a light,
a cigar and pontificate on the universe,
you a,

71
00:04:45.491 --> 00:04:48.460
you would be allowed to use that.
They should be able to use bubblegum pipes.

72
00:04:48.461 --> 00:04:51.700
Are Those bubble pipes on Broadway?
Oh,
those old school ones.
Yeah.

73
00:04:51.701 --> 00:04:55.060
You wear the red velvet smoking jacket and tried to deliver a really serious

74
00:04:55.061 --> 00:04:57.250
line and then just pluma bubbles coming out.

75
00:04:57.251 --> 00:05:00.520
Have you ever been to the place in New York where they have the pipes in the

76
00:05:00.521 --> 00:05:04.450
wall now it's that there's a steakhouse in New York.
Brian,

77
00:05:04.451 --> 00:05:07.060
see if he could Google the name of the place.
I forget it,

78
00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.100
but Sussman recommended it to me.

79
00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.570
We went there once and it's been open I guess for like,
you know,

80
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:17.440
150 years or something crazy.
And it has all these pipes on the wall.

81
00:05:17.441 --> 00:05:20.940
Like tobacco smoking pipe,
tobacco pipes from famous P,
right.

82
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:25.120
So I guess people would go and eat steak there and just smoke pipes and they

83
00:05:25.121 --> 00:05:29.140
would take down their pipe like they had like a little wall.
What was it called?

84
00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:33.220
Uh,
it's called Keen's steakhouse.
There you go.
That's old school.

85
00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:37.960
Here's that.
Here's a photo of it.
Right?
When was that latest pie?
Oh look,

86
00:05:37.961 --> 00:05:42.860
those are all pipes on the ceiling surrounded by framed racists.
Look it up.

87
00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:50.800
Yeah.
That guy didn't even pretend you had black friends.

88
00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:54.070
I don't even want the frame around me to be black.

89
00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:58.570
You find some find some Brazilian walnut.
You know,
there was a photo.

90
00:05:58.660 --> 00:05:59.271
<v 2>We're,</v>

91
00:05:59.271 --> 00:06:03.910
we're having this podcast just a few days after these two New York City cops

92
00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:09.520
were executed in their cop car in Brooklyn by this guy who was a,

93
00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:11.620
he was already on a run.
I mean he,

94
00:06:11.621 --> 00:06:15.280
he shot and killed his girlfriend or critically wounded three stars.

95
00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:18.880
He was trying to unlock the tank.
I don't know those,
those video game roles.

96
00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:24.430
But um,
then then there was a photo that was released from 1959,

97
00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.680
I think it was of miles Davis.

98
00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:30.100
Miles Davis had walked some white girl to her car,

99
00:06:30.101 --> 00:06:33.280
to a cab and these police officers,
a friend,

100
00:06:33.281 --> 00:06:37.090
he'd walked a white friend and these police officers beat the shit out of him

101
00:06:37.091 --> 00:06:40.630
and arrested him.
And this picture is a miles Davis.
Yeah,

102
00:06:40.631 --> 00:06:44.230
there's pictures of miles Davis got blood all over him.
You're like,
Whoa,

103
00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:48.400
witch's brew all you just realize that like that

104
00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:52.830
<v 4>been going on for a long fucking time.
Police brutality.</v>

105
00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:58.100
But the good news is now we have first person POV video from lapel cams and it

106
00:06:58.511 --> 00:07:03.120
still can't get an indictment.
So we're fine.
Right.
Win Win for both sides.

107
00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:03.911
<v 2>Well,
you know,</v>

108
00:07:03.911 --> 00:07:08.740
I think that the Eric Gardner one is insanely unfortunate,

109
00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:13.300
insanely unfortunate,
and insanely unnecessary.
Like the what they did.

110
00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:16.230
<v 4>I think the,
the incident is unfortunate,</v>

111
00:07:16.231 --> 00:07:21.060
but I think the lack of fucking trial that's criminal in and of itself,

112
00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:21.440
well

113
00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:25.090
<v 2>just doesn't make any sense unless that's your protocol.
If that's your protocol,</v>

114
00:07:25.091 --> 00:07:28.120
you've got to change your protocol.
If you're saying that he did nothing wrong,

115
00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:30.310
well then you gotta redefine what's wrong.
Sure.

116
00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:33.070
Because this guy was just selling cigarettes,
man.
You know what I mean?

117
00:07:33.071 --> 00:07:36.670
Jesus fucking Christ.
He wasn't wanted for some other crimes,

118
00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:41.440
<v 4>but also they defined what's wrong.
They've,
the choke hold is already illegal.</v>

119
00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:45.910
It's already band.
And when the corner of rules it a homicide via chokehold,

120
00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:49.990
you don't,
you don't rule against that.
Like they've already decided.

121
00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:51.890
So that's illegal.
And with the coroner said,

122
00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:55.240
that's what [inaudible] said it was homicide was like heart failure due to

123
00:07:55.241 --> 00:07:59.440
diabetes or something like that.
No,
no.
That was the issue that the corner,

124
00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:03.970
the corner himself ruled it a homicide.
Wow.
I did not know that.
Yeah.
Well,

125
00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:06.340
and then they go.
And then,
you know,

126
00:08:06.341 --> 00:08:08.980
you've watched the Fox News where there yapping about like,

127
00:08:08.981 --> 00:08:10.810
well it's not a chokehold.
Listen,
I've taken,

128
00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:14.780
I'm a green belt in Brazilian Jujitsu.
I took a class next to an orange Julius.

129
00:08:14.781 --> 00:08:17.050
So there was a,
it was from Fox and friends,

130
00:08:17.051 --> 00:08:19.390
I think where they were talking about that.
He's like,
I know Kung Fu,

131
00:08:19.391 --> 00:08:21.430
I've seen the matrix.
And that wasn't a chokehold.

132
00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:24.820
There's different ways to apply pressure to the neck and you would know that if

133
00:08:24.821 --> 00:08:27.550
you were a mixed martial artist,
couldn't believe it's Hannity,
I think.

134
00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:28.843
Couldn't believe it.

135
00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:31.740
<v 2>Um,
this guy,
uh,</v>

136
00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:36.770
this medical examiner says he was killed by compression of his chest and prone

137
00:08:37.171 --> 00:08:40.500
positioning during physical restraint by the police,
asthma,

138
00:08:40.501 --> 00:08:43.470
heart attack and obesity.
We're contributing factors.

139
00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:49.940
So I don't think we're supposed to say that it was a,

140
00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:54.320
the choke hold it did that I had to connect because I could've sworn I read that

141
00:08:54.321 --> 00:08:56.010
it was,
it was,
uh,
the

142
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:58.140
<v 1>choke hold.
But let's say,
what was the first part of that?
It will be,</v>

143
00:08:58.141 --> 00:09:02.310
it's a different striction of airway,
wasn't that?
Yeah,
I mean,
what else is that?

144
00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:06.240
Oh,
well mean I guess you could argue it's a knee on the chest.
No,
it's more of a,

145
00:09:06.241 --> 00:09:07.320
I'm not arguing that they,

146
00:09:07.321 --> 00:09:10.980
they that indicate that the interaction with the cops kill them.
They,

147
00:09:10.981 --> 00:09:12.360
the cops definitely killed them.
Sure.

148
00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:15.420
What I'm saying is I don't think that means that it was from his neck.

149
00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:19.010
I think it's compression of his chest and uh,

150
00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:20.970
all of it is related to the cops.

151
00:09:20.971 --> 00:09:24.960
But I don't think it's related to that illegal move specifically to the armor on

152
00:09:24.961 --> 00:09:29.010
the now.
Right.
But the idea that,
yeah,
this is what they're saying.
Uh,

153
00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:33.090
compression of the neck.
Okay.
Now the medical,
this is a different thing.

154
00:09:33.091 --> 00:09:36.120
The medical,
okay.
This is the God damn problem with the Internet.

155
00:09:36.121 --> 00:09:38.850
You're reading these stories and these people have their own agenda.

156
00:09:38.851 --> 00:09:41.450
So I apologize.
The autopsy,

157
00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:46.020
those feed article that found that the cement was at fault.
So,
okay.

158
00:09:46.021 --> 00:09:48.940
This is,
okay.
This was,
um,

159
00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:52.980
in this article they're saying that the,
that he was,

160
00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:58.160
he died from compression of the neck and also compression of the chest and the

161
00:09:59.161 --> 00:10:02.520
prone positioning.
So it was a contributing factors.
What you're saying,

162
00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:06.070
<v 4>it wasn't that the dude was out of shape and needed more cardio in his life.
Oh,</v>

163
00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:09.550
they killed them attributed but it was compression of his neck.

164
00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:10.900
That's a choke hold.
Right,

165
00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:13.170
<v 1>exactly.
Well,
how else do you rule that?
Yeah,</v>

166
00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:17.160
well they without a doubt they killed him in this altercation like this

167
00:10:17.161 --> 00:10:21.000
altercate I mean,
yeah,
he didn't have the best of health and and yeah,

168
00:10:21.001 --> 00:10:24.000
he did resist them.
Arresting him for no fucking reason,

169
00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:26.250
but they should have been arresting him.

170
00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:29.100
He rose him doing anything and they were wrong.

171
00:10:29.101 --> 00:10:30.750
He didn't even have any cigarettes on him.
Right.

172
00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:34.040
If this guy was selling loose cigarettes like come on man,

173
00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:36.000
you're going to physically attack a guy.

174
00:10:36.001 --> 00:10:40.410
Like it becomes a matter of this is how we need to look at instead of laws like

175
00:10:40.411 --> 00:10:43.800
this is the law.
Does the law when you are doing that,

176
00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:48.840
you are essentially an arm thug for the tax collectors should not really,

177
00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.840
you're not doing police work anymore.
Okay.

178
00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:57.080
Because police work in the most noble of ways is to serve and protect the idea

179
00:10:57.871 --> 00:11:02.870
of a cop in the best possible position is someone who's there to protect adverse

180
00:11:02.871 --> 00:11:06.360
citizens from horrible people.
That's the beautiful aspects.
So as soon

181
00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:09.750
<v 4>you had to keep and maintain the piece to be clear,
not to rile it up.</v>

182
00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:13.640
<v 1>Right,
but that's,
see,
that's not technically what they're supposed to do.</v>

183
00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:14.511
Technically.

184
00:11:14.511 --> 00:11:18.830
What they're supposed to do is uphold the law and uphold the whatever.
You know

185
00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:22.100
<v 4>there are statute four 17 says that you're holding this thing on a Sunday on</v>

186
00:11:22.101 --> 00:11:23.540
this sidewalk and that is illegal.

187
00:11:23.541 --> 00:11:25.370
This is a red zone and I'm going to harass you.

188
00:11:25.371 --> 00:11:27.710
And because you're tired of systemic harassment,

189
00:11:27.711 --> 00:11:30.620
perhaps that's happened to you for years and years and years,

190
00:11:30.621 --> 00:11:32.060
and that gunk is built on the machine.

191
00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:35.480
You do want to resist me because I'm enforcing this law upon you.

192
00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:38.850
<v 1>Yeah.
One of the things he said is,
he said this,
this ends today.
Yeah,</v>

193
00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:42.480
that's what he was saying while they were,
while they were about to attack him.

194
00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:43.980
Right.
Leave me the fuck alone.

195
00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:45.620
<v 4>It's so easy for,</v>

196
00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:49.010
I'd see the Facebook articles that pop up in my timeline that my own family

197
00:11:49.011 --> 00:11:50.660
members are posting,

198
00:11:50.661 --> 00:11:55.570
and it's so easy to a meme with big capital text on it that says,

199
00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:58.930
hey man,
shouldn't be resisting if you weren't resisting,
that wouldn't happen.

200
00:11:58.931 --> 00:12:02.920
And I go,
listen,
you don't have to resist each and every fucking day.

201
00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:05.380
You have no idea what their life is like.

202
00:12:05.381 --> 00:12:08.980
And this isn't a city with stop and frisk laws where you're just casually

203
00:12:08.981 --> 00:12:11.860
walking down the wrong street and you happened to be the wrong color.

204
00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:14.950
So you're going to get roughed up.
We're going to have your pockets inverted.

205
00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:19.060
<v 1>I think a lot of people have really racist ideas and they don't realize that</v>

206
00:12:19.061 --> 00:12:20.500
they're really racist ideas.

207
00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:25.930
And a lot of people have these notions about what it's like to be someone who

208
00:12:25.931 --> 00:12:29.680
lives in x or y neighborhood,
you know?
And you're living in,

209
00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:34.060
you know,
you're in c town judging those x's and y's.
Yeah.

210
00:12:34.061 --> 00:12:37.390
You're in some fucking beautiful suburb somewhere with a bunch of white people

211
00:12:37.391 --> 00:12:40.540
and you're pretending that you understand what it's like to be living in a

212
00:12:40.541 --> 00:12:43.350
horrible neighborhood.
To be a guy who's been arrested 30 times.
What?

213
00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:45.220
What the fuck is that guy's life been like?

214
00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:47.200
What does his life been like since childhood?

215
00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:51.380
When you say that guy's been arrested 31 times,
like this guy,
you got to go,
Whoa,

216
00:12:51.381 --> 00:12:54.220
hold the fuck on.
Like when did that start?
How old was he?

217
00:12:54.221 --> 00:12:56.590
Was he like 16 when he first got arrested?
Like this guy,

218
00:12:56.591 --> 00:13:01.591
does this guy ever have a chance or was he shot out of the womb into a sea of

219
00:13:01.931 --> 00:13:05.130
chaos and,
and this is a minor thing.
I mean you're gonna,

220
00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:08.410
you're gonna attack this guy physically over cigarettes.
That's crazy.

221
00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:12.310
So if they are saying that they're just abiding by the law and they thought that

222
00:13:12.311 --> 00:13:13.121
they were supposed to do that,

223
00:13:13.121 --> 00:13:17.170
we have to rethink what the fuck the law does cause the law can't do that cause

224
00:13:17.171 --> 00:13:20.590
you're not a cop then you are a fucking revenue collector.

225
00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:22.230
<v 4>Laws.
It's,</v>

226
00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:26.250
it's so crazy to me that there are quotas in that profession.

227
00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:27.450
You've got to meet your quota,

228
00:13:27.451 --> 00:13:30.120
which is why at the end of the month you're getting pulled over for speeding a

229
00:13:30.121 --> 00:13:33.640
little bit more and certain areas are getting stopped and frisked and war just

230
00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:34.680
got,
they got to get the numbers up.

231
00:13:34.681 --> 00:13:38.400
They got to look at the spreadsheet and that line graph has to plot up.
Why?

232
00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:42.120
Why isn't a Yelp based sort of thing?
Why isn't it the people deciding?

233
00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:43.710
Have the cops been helpful to them?

234
00:13:43.711 --> 00:13:48.690
Have they serviced them if they kept the peace?
You know,
it's an archaic system.

235
00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:53.700
The idea of police officers,
it's an archaic system.
It really is.
I mean,

236
00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:57.480
I think we need it.
Yes,
no doubt.
Absolutely need it.

237
00:13:58.040 --> 00:13:59.910
Absolutely need military.
We should absolutely.

238
00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:02.510
<v 1>We don't live in a utopian perfect paradise,</v>

239
00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:06.280
but the system that's in place right now is so archaic.
Correct.

240
00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:08.540
The metrics are off.
This shit,

241
00:14:08.541 --> 00:14:13.370
the quotas and then this shit of like grabbing a guy in wrestling him to the

242
00:14:13.371 --> 00:14:16.010
ground because he's not paying cigarette taxes.
Right.

243
00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:19.420
<v 4>You know who he is.
He poses no threat whatsoever.</v>

244
00:14:19.421 --> 00:14:23.710
He's telling you he can't breathe,
which those are weird crimes,
man.
I mean,

245
00:14:23.711 --> 00:14:24.521
there was so many people saying,

246
00:14:24.521 --> 00:14:27.160
well clearly he can breathe cause he's shouting he can't breathe.

247
00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:29.560
But it's been proven time and time again that your lungs,

248
00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:30.880
there's reserve air in there.

249
00:14:30.881 --> 00:14:35.500
Even if you can't breathe that you can use to get in sometimes minutes worth of

250
00:14:35.501 --> 00:14:36.400
conversation out.
Well,

251
00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:41.060
<v 1>I can help out on a couple of these points that people are debating.</v>

252
00:14:41.061 --> 00:14:43.670
First of all,
that's a fucking choke hold.
Okay,

253
00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:47.450
I know how to choke people call it for a living.
That's a chokehold.

254
00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:50.690
When a guy has his arm around his neck like that,
that's compression of the neck,

255
00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:53.840
but then then it becomes,
how did he actually use it?

256
00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:58.340
C I s you know I even tweeted,
I'm like,
that's a fucking choke hold.

257
00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:00.830
You can't say it's not,
but here's the question.

258
00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:03.140
How much pressure was he applying on the neck?

259
00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:05.300
That's when it becomes a choke hold.
When you,

260
00:15:05.301 --> 00:15:09.230
when you are grabbing and you're pulling on the neck and closing off the

261
00:15:09.231 --> 00:15:11.000
arteries,
that's when it becomes a chokehold.

262
00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:14.270
It could be that he's loosely hold the neck and place.

263
00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:17.120
But the problem is the autopsy says that that wasn't the case.

264
00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:20.540
If the autopsy says he was choked and he was fucking choke if he had compression

265
00:15:20.541 --> 00:15:22.340
of the neck.
So what it's saying,

266
00:15:22.341 --> 00:15:26.150
the medical examiner saying compression of the neck,
compression to the chest,

267
00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:30.230
and a prone position,
prone positioning during physical restraint by the police.

268
00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:32.930
This is like in quotes.
So if this,

269
00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:38.200
all of these things are all like using force on a person's body and all those

270
00:15:38.571 --> 00:15:41.660
things can stop you from breathing.
Like when you're doing Jujitsu,
there's,

271
00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:44.780
there's positions where you can't breathe,
where you're not getting choked.

272
00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:48.200
Like there's positions where guys have like a knee on your belly and they

273
00:15:48.201 --> 00:15:50.780
grabbed you around the back and they're pulling towards you.

274
00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:52.520
They compress your chest so,

275
00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:55.520
so deeply and painfully that you can't fucking breathe.

276
00:15:55.700 --> 00:16:00.350
And this is for people who do Jujitsu.
Like if,
if,
uh,
you know,

277
00:16:00.351 --> 00:16:02.660
someone's on top of me and they're grabbing the back of my neck and they're

278
00:16:02.661 --> 00:16:07.010
shoving a knee into my chest,
it's really hard to breathe.
And you know,

279
00:16:07.011 --> 00:16:09.100
I've done Jujitsu for 20 years.
So for,

280
00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:13.370
for a dude who's like a very overweight guy with diabetes,
he's,
you know,

281
00:16:13.371 --> 00:16:17.270
he's not physically fit at all and he's an older guy and you know,
he's,

282
00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:19.220
he's not planking for fun.
Yeah.

283
00:16:19.221 --> 00:16:23.210
He's really overweight and so they're on top of this guy and they're doing all

284
00:16:23.211 --> 00:16:27.050
that to him.
Who knows how much resistance he has to their body weight.

285
00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.690
Who knows how much it takes before he can't breathe.

286
00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:33.590
Some people are not healthy and if all you have to do is push them to corner and

287
00:16:33.591 --> 00:16:36.830
smoosh them and they'll,
they'll look at Gabriel breathe and they could die.

288
00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:38.300
Like that's not uncommon.

289
00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:41.570
There's people out there that are that fucking unhealthy.
And the,

290
00:16:41.571 --> 00:16:42.620
I get the argument of yeah,

291
00:16:42.621 --> 00:16:45.140
you shouldn't be that unhealthy and you'll put that doesn't matter.

292
00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:45.730
<v 5>Well,
you know,</v>

293
00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:50.340
who's putting those fat fingers in America doing that dude elastically boobs.

294
00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:51.581
This,

295
00:16:51.581 --> 00:16:55.900
these things that you just said about resisting arrest and like I've seen in my

296
00:16:55.901 --> 00:16:58.330
Facebook timeline and I had to run side all that.

297
00:16:58.830 --> 00:17:02.830
<v 1>Come on,
man.
He shouldn't have been so fat.
Really,
he shouldn't have died.</v>

298
00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:05.160
<v 5>I live,
this is not,
it's sad.</v>

299
00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:08.760
I the other day fell asleep while trying to power level in destiny.

300
00:17:08.761 --> 00:17:11.080
Joe and I almost choked myself.
I don't know.

301
00:17:11.670 --> 00:17:13.140
I don't know what that meant was on the couch.

302
00:17:13.141 --> 00:17:17.340
Like this power leveling you're trying to get to 30 so I can enjoy the rates.

303
00:17:17.341 --> 00:17:20.400
It's cool.
I'll teach you.
And destiny is a game.
Destiny is in fact a video.

304
00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:23.650
You fill us all in a video game.
Young and non,
you don't,

305
00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:25.140
you don't need to know the specifics of it.

306
00:17:25.141 --> 00:17:28.990
You don't want to know the specifics but I isn't that frightening suck you in.

307
00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:31.680
I mean a few months really love repetitive gameplay and keeping up with the

308
00:17:31.681 --> 00:17:35.730
Joneses with virtual items.
Yeah.
She get it.
Do you shoot things or no?
Shoot.

309
00:17:35.731 --> 00:17:40.510
Lots of things.
Lots of aliens and lots of robots.
Really?
Yeah.
Sounds to involve.

310
00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:44.960
Yeah.
So you stay away from it.
So.
So you almost blacked out?
No.
I literally,

311
00:17:44.961 --> 00:17:47.250
I fell asleep on the couch and I had my neck just like this,

312
00:17:47.251 --> 00:17:49.630
and I kind of choked myself out as I fell and had

313
00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:54.540
<v 1>to wait before falling asleep,
watching a TV show,
right?
You're head goes down,</v>

314
00:17:54.541 --> 00:17:58.710
you're like,
I'm fucking,
yeah,

315
00:17:58.711 --> 00:18:02.520
you could kill people.
Then it's like some people aren't,
aren't,
aren't very fit.

316
00:18:03.970 --> 00:18:07.620
So there will be justice on the civil side,

317
00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:11.520
which is even more infuriating because that means it's our tax dollars that are

318
00:18:11.521 --> 00:18:16.210
going to pay to settle this guy's illegal maneuver.
This is the latest.

319
00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:19.620
This is all just so unnecessary.
This is what's fucked up about it.

320
00:18:19.621 --> 00:18:22.830
It's just so God damn unnecessary.
Yeah.
I mean this,

321
00:18:22.831 --> 00:18:26.580
this attitude of like this is,
imagine if there were no crimes,

322
00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:30.960
no crimes ever militia,
man.
Nowhere in the world,
everything is beautiful.

323
00:18:30.961 --> 00:18:34.530
Everything is like this room.
We all get along famously,

324
00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:38.430
the entire human race could imagine if we got to a point where the entire human

325
00:18:38.431 --> 00:18:42.270
race is just totally cool with each other,
and this would be like a major crime.

326
00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:46.260
Now,
if this was like our major crime and we saw cops attack this guy like this,

327
00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:50.370
we would recognize the cops for being the bad guys,
right?

328
00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:53.190
Like if there was no real crimes and all this guy was doing it,

329
00:18:53.191 --> 00:18:54.840
this is like the worst thing ever.

330
00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:58.860
He's not paying all the taxes on the cigarettes.
I mean that's it.

331
00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:02.550
And so we saw a bunch of guys jump on this guy because he wasn't paying

332
00:19:02.551 --> 00:19:05.610
cigarette taxes.
We'd told you fucking thugs.

333
00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:07.890
Those are IRS thugs that are going after this guy.

334
00:19:07.891 --> 00:19:10.500
We've got to fucking help that dude.
You know,
fuck these people.

335
00:19:10.501 --> 00:19:14.100
These people are Merck's,
that shouldn't be the police force.

336
00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:16.020
It just shouldn't,
you know?

337
00:19:16.021 --> 00:19:21.021
And whether it's for speeding tickets or whether it's for petty crimes or if you

338
00:19:22.801 --> 00:19:27.000
really do have a quota on arrests,
you're betting against the public.

339
00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:28.260
Like that's what you're doing.

340
00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:31.260
Like what would you do if no one committed crimes anymore?
Right?

341
00:19:31.410 --> 00:19:35.670
If the whole country did become like this room where everybody's just chilling,

342
00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:38.490
what would we do?
What would we do?
If ever where you could go.

343
00:19:38.491 --> 00:19:41.610
You would never have to worry about being robbed or never have to worry about

344
00:19:41.611 --> 00:19:44.850
defending yourself.
It was just everywhere you go and be like,
what's up soap?

345
00:19:44.851 --> 00:19:46.710
It's up.
I mean,
if everybody was cool,

346
00:19:46.711 --> 00:19:49.470
literally that would be the world that we would live in.
Well,
what the fuck?

347
00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:51.780
If that was the case,
what would the cops do?

348
00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:55.410
I need someone to police the cool factor.
Like you're being too chill.

349
00:19:56.270 --> 00:20:00.120
You need to fucking rage it up your way to mellow.
Sorry sir.
We,
uh,

350
00:20:00.121 --> 00:20:01.380
just check the list.

351
00:20:01.381 --> 00:20:06.381
You are the 1000000th guy with an ironic fedora on and we can't let you through.

352
00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:11.070
There's too many of you.
We already had a 12 hour drum circle.

353
00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:12.990
We can't have a 13th that's the rule.

354
00:20:12.991 --> 00:20:14.550
I'm going to have to throw it against a brick wall.

355
00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:19.580
How many fucking Guido's were inspired by the soprano's to go out and put on a

356
00:20:19.771 --> 00:20:24.771
warm up suit and just like go out to the Delis and hang out and wrap up the

357
00:20:24.901 --> 00:20:28.800
fucking Italian fucking Italian became good.
It became like,

358
00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:33.520
like pleasurable to be a Guinea douchebag as my relative.

359
00:20:33.521 --> 00:20:37.650
So call ourselves,
you know,
like it became like a good thing.

360
00:20:37.651 --> 00:20:41.400
It became like a badge of courage is fucking a tiling is we've got to stay

361
00:20:41.401 --> 00:20:44.100
together.
These folk got Italians over here,
we make the best buy.

362
00:20:44.101 --> 00:20:46.420
Lowes the best fucking man.

363
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:50.980
<v 3>It became like,
you know what I mean?
It became like a thing.</v>

364
00:20:50.981 --> 00:20:54.340
I don't know how we got there.
Point being New York City's a fucking,

365
00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:58.510
it's a cauldron of anger,
you know,
and does it.
It ain't,

366
00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:02.200
you know,
it's not,
it's not the cops fault.
They,
they're,

367
00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:06.850
I believe they're stuck in this system that's been there long before the guys

368
00:21:06.851 --> 00:21:09.790
who are in there now we're running in New York City.
You know,

369
00:21:09.791 --> 00:21:12.550
I think that like you dealing with a lot of crime,

370
00:21:12.551 --> 00:21:14.020
you're dealing with a lot of violence in it.

371
00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:17.380
You've got a bunch of hard men that are in charge of taking care of that shit

372
00:21:17.381 --> 00:21:19.060
because that's what you need when you're running a police force.

373
00:21:19.061 --> 00:21:23.590
And that's just Wall Street [inaudible] in a different way.

374
00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:28.710
But you know,
there needs to be some sort of fucking cease fire,
some sort of a,

375
00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:29.210
you know,

376
00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:33.760
a communion with the people in the police because the police are the people and

377
00:21:33.761 --> 00:21:36.160
this is where everybody's getting fucked up.
There's this

378
00:21:37.670 --> 00:21:41.410
them thing that happens.
You get one triple armor plated,

379
00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:46.210
mine sweeping Humvee orb school bus or whatever retrofitted it's been from

380
00:21:46.211 --> 00:21:48.540
Afghanistan or whatever.
Your department gets one.
Yeah,

381
00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:50.590
that's all you're going to need pass that.

382
00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.490
You got to donate to schools and fix roads and get some high speed fucking

383
00:21:54.491 --> 00:21:56.170
Internet.
Yeah,
that's totally true.

384
00:21:56.171 --> 00:21:59.830
Except if something happens like what happened in the North Hollywood shootout?

385
00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:02.140
Do you remember the north and do you remember that?
Yeah,
Dude.

386
00:22:02.141 --> 00:22:05.740
We were on news radio on the set and that shit was going down and everybody was

387
00:22:05.741 --> 00:22:08.410
in the,
I don't know,
I forget what room we're in.
We're watching it.

388
00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:12.820
We were all bundled up together.
We were like Ho Lee Shit.

389
00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:17.740
This is crazy.
There was a guy walking down the street,
just gone in,

390
00:22:17.741 --> 00:22:22.741
people down with our head to toe Arbor played him my fucking ironman movie like

391
00:22:24.581 --> 00:22:27.790
an iron man,
like a bad guy in heat,
you know,
like more eggs,

392
00:22:27.850 --> 00:22:31.360
more exaggerated than heat.
Right.
Cause he was more armored up,
right.

393
00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:34.240
That they have to be ready in case some shit like that happens.

394
00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:38.860
They were ready and they are ready today.
It's like the barely ready for that.

395
00:22:38.861 --> 00:22:41.170
They were super outgunned in that they figured it out.

396
00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:45.130
They barely did with those because there was only two dudes.
You know,

397
00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:49.630
I mean look,
I'm not saying that we should have a militarized police force,

398
00:22:49.631 --> 00:22:54.631
but the reality is if a military attack did occur on a city,

399
00:22:54.641 --> 00:22:57.100
the police force is not equipped to defend against it.

400
00:22:57.310 --> 00:23:00.610
They're equipped to totally true.
But what we've also seen time and time again,

401
00:23:00.611 --> 00:23:04.120
it's that they don't have the proper judgment as to when that use or show of

402
00:23:04.121 --> 00:23:05.170
force as necessary.

403
00:23:05.171 --> 00:23:09.520
And that's why you see fucking tanks and snipers in prone positions at peaceful

404
00:23:09.521 --> 00:23:12.970
Ferguson protests.
I mean that.
So it's like it's,

405
00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:14.860
it's the who watches the watchmen thing,
right?

406
00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:19.000
They need the gear to protect us from the fucking handful of crazies that once a

407
00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.140
decade come out and have their little parade.
Yeah.

408
00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:26.140
But who gets to dictate when and how they can use that gear if they in and of

409
00:23:26.141 --> 00:23:30.850
themselves,
they're corrupt or they've got corrupt motives.
Yeah.
Fuck.

410
00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:33.310
As long as we don't show the interview,
we're all safe.

411
00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:37.840
That's what it comes down to.
Well,
it all comes down to,
first of all,

412
00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:42.070
there has to be some sort of accountability for public's reaction.

413
00:23:42.370 --> 00:23:46.280
The reaction the public has had,
especially the one that kills

414
00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:50.840
<v 1>me,
is that 12 year old kid in Cleveland,
that one kills me.</v>

415
00:23:50.841 --> 00:23:55.280
I can't even read about that one guy.
One fucked my head up.

416
00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:57.140
I don't think I know about that one.
Do I want to know about that?

417
00:23:57.141 --> 00:23:59.310
One kid had a toy gun,
uh,

418
00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:03.920
and these cops pulled over and they shot him within two seconds of seeing him.

419
00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:08.210
They killed him within,
literally,
there's a video that car stopped,

420
00:24:08.211 --> 00:24:09.260
the car opens up.

421
00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:14.440
He pulls his gun out and he starts shooting and he kills the kid and it's like,

422
00:24:14.811 --> 00:24:17.720
what the fuck?
I can't watch it.
I won't watch it.

423
00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:22.350
<v 4>There's also last night I finally the the the officer with the Lapel Cam who</v>

424
00:24:22.351 --> 00:24:24.300
calls to dogs over and then shoots them.

425
00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:28.680
She literally makes the kissing noises then at the dogs and calls him over and

426
00:24:28.681 --> 00:24:31.390
then drops them both and then radios it in now.

427
00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:35.730
Now supposedly she was responding to a call where these dogs were attacking

428
00:24:35.731 --> 00:24:39.120
someone and they were trapped in like a truck and she needed to get through

429
00:24:39.121 --> 00:24:41.010
these dogs.
The issue is that,

430
00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:44.340
and now granted they released the vine version of this video.

431
00:24:44.341 --> 00:24:46.440
I don't know what the handles are on either side,

432
00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:49.920
but you do see in this video or these two dogs,
their tails wagging,

433
00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:55.100
zero barks and she pulls the calls him over and then you see just like a first

434
00:24:55.141 --> 00:24:58.020
person shooter,
you see the revolver come up.
Yeah.

435
00:24:58.110 --> 00:25:02.580
And the trigger squeezed and it's just like another case of like,
okay,

436
00:25:02.581 --> 00:25:05.010
now we're seeing it.
Now we're seeing it.

437
00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:09.540
<v 1>Do you know about the guy who was a mayor somewhere and the,</v>

438
00:25:09.570 --> 00:25:11.530
the cops got the wrong address.

439
00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:15.700
There was a guy who was getting pot delivered and what he was doing is he was

440
00:25:15.701 --> 00:25:18.580
using this guys that dress.
Do you remember the store?

441
00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:20.740
It was ugly somewhere outside of Washington.
Is this

442
00:25:21.410 --> 00:25:23.780
<v 4>bang the house and the kid got scarred or no,
no,
no.</v>

443
00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:26.640
<v 1>So different.
That one I think was in Atlanta.
This is a different one.
So,</v>

444
00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:30.010
so many these days.
Joe [inaudible] House lose track,
shot his dog,

445
00:25:30.011 --> 00:25:33.340
chased the dog down and shot it in front of the kids and,

446
00:25:33.390 --> 00:25:34.630
and handcuffed everybody.

447
00:25:34.631 --> 00:25:36.520
The whole deal went through the house and then found out that the guy was

448
00:25:36.521 --> 00:25:38.920
actually the mayor.
And you know,

449
00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:42.580
the whole thing was just like this shoe or a mayor at least through the whole

450
00:25:42.581 --> 00:25:44.950
thing was a fucking huge disaster.

451
00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:49.570
But you found out like firsthand from a guy who's in government how thuggish

452
00:25:49.571 --> 00:25:54.220
there,
right?
Like they ran after a Labrador and shot it.
I called Labradors.

453
00:25:54.221 --> 00:25:57.820
Anybody who's knows labs like the sweetest,
friendliest dogs in the world.

454
00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:59.470
And if you,
you don't know that,

455
00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:03.620
you don't know if the dog's not barking and attacking you and you shoot it,
you,

456
00:26:03.730 --> 00:26:07.030
you just murdered a dog.
Right?
You know,
you just murdered a family pet.

457
00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:11.410
That's crazy that they have that attitude.
But that's so prevalent.

458
00:26:11.411 --> 00:26:12.670
It happens so often.

459
00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:14.720
<v 4>That's the case in point.</v>

460
00:26:14.721 --> 00:26:18.770
Like had that happened to someone who just happens to work in a cafeteria or

461
00:26:18.771 --> 00:26:19.730
someone who picks up garbage,

462
00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:22.580
you probably wouldn't have heard about it would have made it nowhere.

463
00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:23.300
They just happen,

464
00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:26.030
knock on the one wrong door that had a government official in there.

465
00:26:26.370 --> 00:26:30.540
<v 1>And then the same question again comes up is that protocol and if it is protocol</v>

466
00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:33.480
than protocols fucked up,
that's fucked up.
You know,
we got,

467
00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:36.840
if there was only a few people have as a small town,

468
00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:39.690
you would never accept that kind of behavior from the cop.
Right.

469
00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:44.010
The idea is the only time that behavior becomes is

470
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:46.170
<v 3>when the cop is not a part of the community.</v>

471
00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:49.800
When the cop is from somewhere else and comes in and can shoot that dog and

472
00:26:49.801 --> 00:26:52.800
doesn't have to worry about sleeping in his house right next door to where he

473
00:26:52.801 --> 00:26:57.140
shot that dog,
he can make a mess up in an area and just get out of there.
Right.

474
00:26:57.180 --> 00:27:00.810
That's the problem with urbanization when it comes to like the way people treat

475
00:27:00.811 --> 00:27:02.250
each other inside communities.

476
00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:06.440
<v 4>That was a problem that happened when squad cars became more prevalent that that</v>

477
00:27:06.441 --> 00:27:10.640
the on the streets policing used to have to walk a beat and make eye contact

478
00:27:10.641 --> 00:27:13.420
with your neighbors and you weren't in a metal cage of course with a shotgun

479
00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:15.350
there and surrounded by technology and everything.

480
00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:18.020
And they said that once police officer's switched to that,

481
00:27:18.021 --> 00:27:22.100
their patrols got larger.
So the intimacy dropped and you know,

482
00:27:22.101 --> 00:27:27.101
that sense of community a vanished and it's so painful for me to talk about in

483
00:27:27.531 --> 00:27:29.450
this way because I've got my brother's a cop,

484
00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:33.770
I've got so many police officers in my family and so when I write the long

485
00:27:33.771 --> 00:27:37.400
winded diatribes in response to moderately racist,
you know,

486
00:27:37.401 --> 00:27:41.660
tea party action network means that I see pop up in my Facebook timeline.

487
00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:44.180
I do like,
I always make it a point to say,

488
00:27:44.181 --> 00:27:46.820
I know that they deal with the worst of the worst,
right?

489
00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:51.020
Every day they deal with scumbags or they deal with people who want to kill them

490
00:27:51.021 --> 00:27:53.840
or rape people or what.
Yes,
they deal with that,

491
00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:57.290
but it doesn't excuse any of this.
I'm sorry.
That's part,

492
00:27:57.291 --> 00:27:59.750
I'm glad that they're there.
I'm glad that they keep me safe.

493
00:27:59.751 --> 00:28:02.750
If some shit goes down,
the first thing you did call the cops,
right?

494
00:28:02.930 --> 00:28:06.560
That's who we would turn to.
But it doesn't excuse any of this behavior.

495
00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:11.030
And you have to also admit that those constant interactions day to day,

496
00:28:11.031 --> 00:28:14.660
dealing with people that you think don't.
If it's a routine traffic stop,

497
00:28:14.661 --> 00:28:17.600
you have to in a piece piece of your brain has to fire off going,

498
00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:19.820
this guy wants to fucking kill me.
He,

499
00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:24.850
you never know that that constant pain in your brain has got to warp your vision

500
00:28:24.951 --> 00:28:28.640
on everybody else.
There's no way to keep those feelings silo.

501
00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:30.570
<v 3>This has been a reoccurring subject lately.</v>

502
00:28:30.571 --> 00:28:33.650
If people were tired of us talking about it.
Oh yeah.
Well it's,

503
00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:37.320
it's just so in the news,
right.
Sampling so much tucked destiny.

504
00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:40.470
Now what level are you,
because I find if you get to 20,

505
00:28:40.471 --> 00:28:43.050
then it's all about your light level and then you're fucking funding for

506
00:28:43.051 --> 00:28:45.870
legendary and grams.
And you know what a pain in the ass that is 10.

507
00:28:45.871 --> 00:28:48.390
You got an upgrade them and I don't have enough fucking spin metal for that.

508
00:28:48.391 --> 00:28:53.050
Am I right?
I appreciate your passion.
At least I'm passionate about a topic.
No,

509
00:28:53.130 --> 00:28:55.800
not what you discuss,
sir.
But I appreciate your passion.

510
00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:57.540
I'm not trying to dissuade us from the topic.

511
00:28:57.541 --> 00:29:00.240
I'm just trying to sort of acknowledge the fact that I know we talk about it a

512
00:29:00.241 --> 00:29:04.710
lot.
Sure.
It's,
um,
it's,
I don't think people are qualified to be policed.

513
00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:08.460
I think it's too hard to,
John for humans.
I think we need robot police.
Oh,

514
00:29:08.461 --> 00:29:11.190
we're getting some fucking I robot type dudes.
Yeah.

515
00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:13.780
And as long as criminal stay off the stairs and two and nine,

516
00:29:13.781 --> 00:29:15.180
it's got a man he's set.

517
00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:18.450
Make sure there's nothing to do with taxes and nothing to do with revenue

518
00:29:18.451 --> 00:29:20.810
collection.
You can't arrest people for stuff like that.
Right.

519
00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:22.170
Just take it up in court.

520
00:29:22.410 --> 00:29:24.940
Robot police that you can fuck when they're not doing anymore.

521
00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:28.560
That's not how the world's going to work.
But think about it.

522
00:29:28.561 --> 00:29:30.050
They got it running around fucking the police.

523
00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:35.070
They got to recharge at some point.
Fuck the police from the underground.

524
00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:36.870
No,
seriously.
Fuck them.
They're recharging right now.

525
00:29:36.871 --> 00:29:40.890
Maybe that's what it became a strategy that was devised by a psychologist who

526
00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:43.610
really let everybody know,
listen,
if we're all making love,
will,

527
00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:47.770
will respect and appreciate each morning and it'll give the people a stronger

528
00:29:47.771 --> 00:29:48.700
bond with the police.

529
00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:52.160
So they actually should fuck the police officers when they find them.
Yes.

530
00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:56.950
So the police could do after orgasm,
the robot police could serve a dual purpose.

531
00:29:56.951 --> 00:29:59.770
They could enforce laws and blow you,
you know,

532
00:29:59.771 --> 00:30:02.110
so you really feel good about interacting with them.

533
00:30:02.170 --> 00:30:04.120
Let's take action steps though.
Okay.
I mean,

534
00:30:04.150 --> 00:30:06.940
we know robot fuckable police like bipedal robots.

535
00:30:06.970 --> 00:30:10.840
The technology's not quite there.
They're getting there.
The one time I fuck it.

536
00:30:10.841 --> 00:30:15.450
It'll be there.
I'm not fucking Beta subjects.
I'm not trying any,
uh,

537
00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:17.650
not going to fucking Google ass.
I'm not going to,
no,

538
00:30:17.651 --> 00:30:20.110
I'm saying I'm not yet early.
Adopt doing any,
yeah.

539
00:30:20.111 --> 00:30:21.340
I'm not going to be an early adopter.

540
00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:24.940
I'm going to fuck the Primo units that are ready.

541
00:30:24.970 --> 00:30:29.110
We could have won my ticket and electrocuted off.
You know,
some dudes,
one dude,

542
00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:32.440
the chicks going to have some sort of a blow out inside of her and his Dick's

543
00:30:32.441 --> 00:30:34.960
going to get cooked to a crisp.
Yeah,

544
00:30:36.670 --> 00:30:40.260
but then got to run on electricity.
New firmware.
You're set.
Yeah.
The,

545
00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:44.940
the maybe replaced for utility belts today with just,
just like a bandolier,

546
00:30:44.941 --> 00:30:47.050
a fleshlight holes.
That's about it.

547
00:30:47.051 --> 00:30:50.560
And you could go up and hug your local police officer and go ahead and give him

548
00:30:50.561 --> 00:30:54.690
a little couple thrusts at the waist level.
I'm no,
I know him.
Him or her,

549
00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:57.670
like all robot girl.
Look man,

550
00:30:57.700 --> 00:31:00.040
it's going to be 10 years before this tech is ready.

551
00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:02.320
So let's throw flashlights on officers.

552
00:31:02.410 --> 00:31:06.780
How many women would be into fucking robot dudes as opposed to the dude's being

553
00:31:06.790 --> 00:31:09.610
a fucking robot.
Women.
Cause for Dudes,
I could think,

554
00:31:09.611 --> 00:31:13.570
I can comfortably say it's a hundred percent a hundred percent guys would fuck a

555
00:31:13.571 --> 00:31:17.560
lifelike,
beautiful woman robot.
Right.
But I don't,
we're not even lie.

556
00:31:17.561 --> 00:31:21.910
Same with women with women.
I don't think are 100% of women would fuck a robot.

557
00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:25.270
I bet.
I bet they're way more discerning.

558
00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:29.110
I bet most of my ex girlfriends would say that they have fucked a robot.

559
00:31:29.111 --> 00:31:31.100
He had a,
uh,

560
00:31:31.450 --> 00:31:34.910
emotionless machine that is just the driving for the finish.

561
00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:36.250
They would make love to the robot.

562
00:31:36.910 --> 00:31:40.810
That's exactly [inaudible] a wonderful [inaudible] asked me about my day.

563
00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:43.630
I him with the rubber would look like of chicks could design it.

564
00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:46.390
That's what the real question was.
Saddle will be like,

565
00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:49.930
do you think it would even be white?
Would it be like,
would it be blue,

566
00:31:49.931 --> 00:31:52.060
like avatar style?
I think it'd be red.

567
00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:55.810
If girls could make a guy like any color they want,
would they do,

568
00:31:56.230 --> 00:31:57.700
they would probably make us pink,

569
00:31:58.270 --> 00:32:00.420
giant transparent so they could see our feelings.

570
00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:07.390
I want to know what's going on in their transparent.
Just,
yeah,

571
00:32:08.050 --> 00:32:09.110
I can't wait cause the,
the,

572
00:32:09.111 --> 00:32:13.790
the future of that is LEDs that are customized with the music that's going on to

573
00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:15.780
two robot fucking,
yeah.

574
00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:19.030
Her mouth changes colors based on the Scrillex track that's going,
you know,

575
00:32:19.031 --> 00:32:22.750
like it's going to be wild fucking rave.
That was pretty psychedelic.

576
00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:26.920
Especially thinking about how small the LEDs could possibly get.
Right.
You know,

577
00:32:26.921 --> 00:32:30.350
like literally her whole face.
It could be pores and the,
the,

578
00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:34.450
the actual pores of the face could be like individual LEDs.

579
00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:36.840
Well we think about how cool projection mapping is,
right?

580
00:32:36.841 --> 00:32:39.890
Sling an image onto a surface and oh it looks,
it's that thing when,

581
00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:44.150
when the LEDs are small enough to basically be those individual pores are
pixels.

582
00:32:44.151 --> 00:32:48.170
The entire surface can animate and come to life in a way that admits its own

583
00:32:48.171 --> 00:32:51.590
light.
So you can walk around and you could,
you could change the face of it.

584
00:32:51.591 --> 00:32:53.180
You can change the texture,
you could change whatever.

585
00:32:53.181 --> 00:32:56.150
It can be full motion video playing on your fuck doll's face will.

586
00:32:56.151 --> 00:32:57.890
You could show like commercials,

587
00:32:58.070 --> 00:33:01.850
like if you're doing a doggy style show commercials on her back after a Purina

588
00:33:01.851 --> 00:33:06.230
dog chow.
Yeah.
They could just like interrupt your sex for commercials yet.

589
00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:08.060
Like you get a sex program,

590
00:33:08.061 --> 00:33:10.400
but you have to watch like a certain amount of minutes.

591
00:33:10.401 --> 00:33:11.840
Have a coca cola commercial.
Right?

592
00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:15.950
So you watched this polar bear dance around ice on the small of her back while

593
00:33:15.951 --> 00:33:20.450
you try to keep your heart off and like she freezes while the commercials going

594
00:33:20.451 --> 00:33:24.140
on.
She won't move and it just dries up all of a sudden.

595
00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:28.370
Well it just holds like a fucking metal and not,
not,
not,
not scary,

596
00:33:28.371 --> 00:33:31.820
but gives you a little extra squeeze.
Just stay right here.

597
00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:34.640
Watch this coke commercial.
Don,
look at the new fiesta.

598
00:33:34.641 --> 00:33:37.850
Look at how heavy it is by cook.
After you,
fuck me.
Right baby,

599
00:33:39.330 --> 00:33:44.330
who's six back [inaudible] they're going to holiday or sneezes.

600
00:33:45.291 --> 00:33:49.010
When you finish it,
it's nose robot places are going to have to have juice,
right.

601
00:33:49.011 --> 00:33:51.950
So they're going to have like simulated smells.
Awesome.
So you could have like,

602
00:33:51.951 --> 00:33:54.380
I wouldn't keep the Strawberry Pussy Jews or you could be like,
no,

603
00:33:54.381 --> 00:33:56.470
I want realistic pussy smell.
Yeah,

604
00:33:57.150 --> 00:34:00.110
you're probably going to be able to customize everything Cinnabon.

605
00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:02.660
It's going to be like kind of constantly smell like an airport.

606
00:34:02.810 --> 00:34:05.990
You could totally do that on a food court.
Right.
Dot.
Yeah.
They can do that.

607
00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:09.170
Or like some people would want someone to smell like an animal.

608
00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:13.900
Like want to smell like a dog,
right?
Oh yeah.
Maybe a wet dog dog.

609
00:34:15.110 --> 00:34:17.830
Some people like really into like animalistic sex.

610
00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:21.700
I'm on salmon and you smell like a fucking moose.
Dirty

611
00:34:23.210 --> 00:34:27.770
dirty feet.
Concert breath,
cigarette breath,

612
00:34:27.790 --> 00:34:30.020
arm pits.
Bad vitamins.

613
00:34:35.090 --> 00:34:37.940
Yeah.
You're going to be able to have sex with movie stars.
Well,

614
00:34:37.941 --> 00:34:40.760
there was that one thing they're going to be able to like do a Jennifer Lopez

615
00:34:40.761 --> 00:34:42.080
model,
you know,

616
00:34:42.081 --> 00:34:45.140
and Jennifer Lopez is going to show up at your house and just start blowing you.

617
00:34:45.180 --> 00:34:45.831
And we talked about this.

618
00:34:45.831 --> 00:34:49.730
There's going to be a marketplace for this on Oculus to start in Vr,
right?

619
00:34:49.731 --> 00:34:53.150
And there'll be an underground marketplace where hackers texture map your

620
00:34:53.151 --> 00:34:57.500
favorite actor or actress onto a 3d fuck model and you'll be able to download

621
00:34:57.650 --> 00:35:01.190
and people will be pirating people's likenesses and making the same way they

622
00:35:01.191 --> 00:35:01.890
make soundboard.

623
00:35:01.890 --> 00:35:05.480
So I'll make these sort of fuck audio tracks so you can go and download your

624
00:35:05.481 --> 00:35:09.200
favorite celeb and pay,
you know,
some,
some underground group,

625
00:35:09.201 --> 00:35:13.130
a couple bucks to have access to that three d model.
I am totally in a time,

626
00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:18.190
I envision a time in our lifetimes where people regularly have like implants put

627
00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:23.300
under the skin of their head.
Like,
you know,
how they,

628
00:35:23.330 --> 00:35:28.090
they're doing all these different,
um,
there was a,
an episode of,
um,

629
00:35:28.750 --> 00:35:32.750
radio lab where they were talking about how they've applied electrical impulses

630
00:35:32.751 --> 00:35:35.200
to certain areas of the brain to stimulate learning.
Right.

631
00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:38.010
And people have done things like these,
uh,
videos,
sniper

632
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:40.180
<v 1>courses,
and they do it with the electrical impulses in their,</v>

633
00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:43.590
their scores go through the fucking roof just through the roof.

634
00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:47.340
And these are just these electrodes that are placed on the head.
If you,

635
00:35:47.341 --> 00:35:52.341
if we permanently installed some sort of battery powered system that was like on

636
00:35:55.141 --> 00:35:58.920
top of people's heads and people were constantly connected to this and could

637
00:35:58.921 --> 00:36:02.420
connect to each other back and forth with this.
I mean the,

638
00:36:02.421 --> 00:36:03.840
I think that that's something that would,

639
00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:08.700
that would be implemented like almost like the cell phone is today.

640
00:36:08.790 --> 00:36:10.550
People would just get it because they would want to have it.

641
00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:12.360
<v 5>Yeah.
Some enhanced to learning device.</v>

642
00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:15.950
And now of course I'll pop it on during my formative years and I can read that

643
00:36:15.951 --> 00:36:19.500
the speed of Johnny five and great.
And that'll just become commonplace.
Yeah.

644
00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:22.450
<v 1>According on it,
it'll upload to the cloud.</v>

645
00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:26.870
You'll probably be able to take pictures of your eyeballs and now you can send a

646
00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:31.210
photograph to you're a doctor,
your ophthalmologist,
and you'd go,
Oh gee,

647
00:36:31.211 --> 00:36:35.110
does how you're seeing shit.
Oh,
you silly bitch.
You got 2040 vision.

648
00:36:35.111 --> 00:36:40.060
You need glasses.
What's 2040 is okay,
right?
What's bad?
Like 2050 2060 let's,

649
00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:41.180
I don't know what the numbers are.

650
00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:45.280
20 is best and then look to see actually some people have better than 2020 like

651
00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:46.570
fighter pilots and shit.

652
00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:49.900
Those fucking real red blooded Americans and only eat corn flakes in the
morning.

653
00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:51.340
I fucking blue.

654
00:36:51.830 --> 00:36:54.520
<v 5>You mean the guys in the crate that are controlling the RC helicopter with the</v>

655
00:36:54.521 --> 00:36:58.840
missiles with like a joystick cruises buddy ice.
Yeah,
ice man.

656
00:36:58.870 --> 00:37:00.600
That's who I'm thinking.
Okay.
I'm thinking of,

657
00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:05.620
that's like the perfect macho fighter pilot with perfect bone structure.

658
00:37:05.890 --> 00:37:10.330
Those guys have like 2010 vision.
They see shit.
You don't see Kevin Pereira,

659
00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:13.600
you're not a sky warrior.
Clearly not know.

660
00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:19.600
What do you do for a living?
I'm a sky.
Whoa.
That's way better than the air force.

661
00:37:19.660 --> 00:37:22.690
She called the Sky Warriors.
Come on.
I'm sure they do.

662
00:37:22.691 --> 00:37:25.870
Internally it's two thousand fifteen thousand bumps in slow mo in the locker

663
00:37:25.871 --> 00:37:29.080
rooms are the sky warriors.
We are legion

664
00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:37.000
some fortunate or just woke up like
I played after burner.

665
00:37:37.001 --> 00:37:38.950
I know what it's like.
I'm

666
00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:44.260
<v 1>curious as to see what what effect drone technology is going to have on our</v>

667
00:37:44.361 --> 00:37:49.361
overall quality of life over the next few years because as I've seen more and

668
00:37:49.521 --> 00:37:52.280
more of these fucking videos with these things flying around,

669
00:37:52.281 --> 00:37:57.281
I'm like at what point in time is it going to be like commonplace to be go

670
00:37:59.481 --> 00:38:02.840
outside and there's fucking drones all over the place.
Picking things

671
00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:06.530
<v 5>five years,
five years.
There's going to be dog walking drones.</v>

672
00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:10.250
I think back to the future too.
Back in the future to walking drones.

673
00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:13.210
What do you mean by old name?
Walk your dog.
Snap it.

674
00:38:13.390 --> 00:38:15.700
[inaudible] GPS.

675
00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:18.800
You track the streets and it goes through GPS and finds it.

676
00:38:18.830 --> 00:38:21.860
What if your dog walking a pit bull and he can't hold on to that fucking leash

677
00:38:21.861 --> 00:38:22.700
and it wants to kill something?

678
00:38:22.890 --> 00:38:26.630
It's got emergency jets that only last about 20 minutes that are really strong.

679
00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:29.270
Some sort of tranq dart that'll just shoots into your pooches neck.

680
00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:31.150
You've never had fires and hits the police office.

681
00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:33.180
<v 1>They'll wait that 20 minutes out,</v>

682
00:38:33.210 --> 00:38:36.010
they'll fight it out and when that 20 minutes is over,
there'll be ready.

683
00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:40.030
They'll still chase that dog pit bulls of the worst though.

684
00:38:40.031 --> 00:38:43.480
The worst when it comes to like dog aggression.
Right.
And I've had him,

685
00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:47.620
I've had dogs that were,
I've had,
you know,
they vary.
I've had a few pit bulls,

686
00:38:47.621 --> 00:38:49.960
some of them when they were really sweet and didn't want to have anything to do

687
00:38:49.961 --> 00:38:53.290
with fighting other dogs.
And then other ones that that's all they wanted to do.

688
00:38:53.291 --> 00:38:56.710
And no matter what you tried to do to get it out of them,
especially males,

689
00:38:56.740 --> 00:39:01.030
that is what they want to do.
And it's,
it's so annoying because like,

690
00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:05.480
it's like having a friend who's super awesome until he gets around other people

691
00:39:05.481 --> 00:39:07.810
and then he starts attacking them and beating the shit out of him.

692
00:39:07.930 --> 00:39:10.150
And you're like,
why would,
why would you do this?

693
00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:13.240
Why are you attacking all of these people?
These people are fucking nice,

694
00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:16.900
but he's like,
fuck is shoe and me.
That's it.
That's how pitfalls are.

695
00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:21.460
When like if other dogs come around,
there's a few of them.
It's not all of them,

696
00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:22.690
but it's,
it,
it,
it.

697
00:39:22.691 --> 00:39:26.230
A lot of it has to do with how they were bred and if you get one that had an

698
00:39:26.231 --> 00:39:30.940
actual lineage of dog fighting,
you know,
you're likely going to hear that.

699
00:39:30.941 --> 00:39:35.770
That DNA is modified years of breeding of now when you come out you get big,

700
00:39:35.771 --> 00:39:37.660
strong fast and you murder well.

701
00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:42.340
The actual scary ones believe it or not or not even that big.
Really?
Yeah.

702
00:39:42.341 --> 00:39:44.050
The real fighting dogs,

703
00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:48.700
the dogs they use in actual like gambling matches are fairly small.

704
00:39:48.701 --> 00:39:52.570
They're like 35 pounds,
like 35 pounds is actually a big one.

705
00:39:53.050 --> 00:39:55.810
Those are pit bulls.
The real pit bulls.

706
00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:59.860
What do you see these big like a muscle bound modified dogs.

707
00:40:00.070 --> 00:40:02.500
These are bred to look good.
Those dogs,

708
00:40:02.770 --> 00:40:06.250
they would never last against one of those little 35 pound dogs.

709
00:40:06.490 --> 00:40:08.650
Cause those 35 pound dogs just don't get tired.

710
00:40:09.010 --> 00:40:11.530
They don't get tired and they don't give up and they don't give a fuck about

711
00:40:11.531 --> 00:40:14.650
pain.
And they don't even look scary.
Like if you look at a real pit bull,

712
00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:17.810
they don't have the super wide head.
They're actually fairly small dogs.

713
00:40:17.950 --> 00:40:19.550
Chess and the definition.
Yeah,

714
00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:23.470
they're fairly small dogs and they're really great with people.

715
00:40:23.471 --> 00:40:27.760
They're the sweetest with people because one of the reasons why they fight is to

716
00:40:27.761 --> 00:40:31.270
please their owner,
right?
Like it's really a crazy relationship.

717
00:40:31.630 --> 00:40:35.170
They're the sweetest,
kindest dogs.
They look so friendly with people.

718
00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:39.400
But sometimes the mistake babies for animals,
you know,

719
00:40:39.401 --> 00:40:42.020
and they're very scary in that way.
Like little kids and babies are,

720
00:40:42.130 --> 00:40:46.840
it's very dangerous to have them around like suit certain super hyper aggressive

721
00:40:46.841 --> 00:40:47.350
dogs.

722
00:40:47.350 --> 00:40:50.770
Cause they don't know if they've never seen a baby before but then never seen a

723
00:40:50.771 --> 00:40:55.120
little kid before.
They might think it's an animal.
Right.
Fuck that.
You know,

724
00:40:55.121 --> 00:40:57.940
fuck all that.
I don't think the drone is gonna be able to hold that back.

725
00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.660
What's weird that you could just raise dogs,
you know,

726
00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:03.850
and teach them how to attack this kind of,
I mean,

727
00:41:03.851 --> 00:41:07.930
I get the idea you can have it and abandon them to that.
There's a lot of weird,

728
00:41:07.990 --> 00:41:11.830
that's weird.
That's weird,
right?
But in that we're like,
well,
you know,

729
00:41:11.831 --> 00:41:14.860
it's the question is like if give them up for foster care,
what would it be?

730
00:41:14.861 --> 00:41:18.520
Better to be with the person who wants to give you up to foster girlies with

731
00:41:18.521 --> 00:41:21.190
foster care,
you might have a shot total one trying to,

732
00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:24.340
trying to raise you and love you.
Totally.
You know,

733
00:41:24.790 --> 00:41:27.280
obviously there's a bunch of different reasons why people give people up,

734
00:41:27.281 --> 00:41:29.590
but there's always plan B.
Yeah.

735
00:41:29.650 --> 00:41:33.350
The idea of given up your kid to foster care for no reason other than anything

736
00:41:33.351 --> 00:41:34.070
else.
Like if you're going

737
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:36.380
<v 3>to die or you know,
I mean people,</v>

738
00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:39.770
that kind of shit happens and it's great in that sense.

739
00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:44.180
But you all those nightmare stories about foster kids,
it's like

740
00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:48.260
you always have to think how fucked up where they,
when they got in there.

741
00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:49.011
You know?

742
00:41:49.011 --> 00:41:53.030
I mean when you hear about foster parents having to deal with kids that were

743
00:41:53.031 --> 00:41:58.031
just severely abused for large chunks of their life that can go into a puppy

744
00:41:58.941 --> 00:42:03.740
mill.
I want to know that abs for for anything,
any,
any scar I put on an animal.

745
00:42:03.741 --> 00:42:04.850
I want to know.
I put it there.

746
00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:07.970
You know my dog pisses on the carpet when I microwave a hot pocket.

747
00:42:08.090 --> 00:42:10.580
I wanted to ask because I was punching it in the face the first time that

748
00:42:10.581 --> 00:42:11.950
happened.
Not somebody else.
Yeah.

749
00:42:11.951 --> 00:42:15.920
If you get a dog from a really good breeder that it's one thing if someone like

750
00:42:15.921 --> 00:42:18.380
is a very ethical breeder and they're really kind of their dogs,

751
00:42:18.610 --> 00:42:21.830
you're going to likely get a really good dog but you could get a really good dog

752
00:42:21.831 --> 00:42:24.110
at the pound.
Totally.
You never know.

753
00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:29.090
It's like I wonder how much epigenetics and like learned behavior passed down

754
00:42:29.091 --> 00:42:32.780
through the genes like affects dogs and people.

755
00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:34.580
You know like the idea of adopting a kid.

756
00:42:34.581 --> 00:42:37.970
Like people love the idea of adopting kid.
I mean you give someone a fresh start.

757
00:42:37.971 --> 00:42:41.460
I mean that's amazing.
I mean give,
give a baby a chance and you know,

758
00:42:41.461 --> 00:42:44.210
and loving family takes him in or her in.

759
00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:46.490
But you always have to like wonder.

760
00:42:46.491 --> 00:42:49.640
Like I wonder how much of what a person is,

761
00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:54.800
is what you teach them and what they see in their environment and how much of it

762
00:42:54.801 --> 00:42:56.000
is actually in their genetics.

763
00:42:56.330 --> 00:43:00.620
I mean I think for sure you could take someone from a troubled genetic

764
00:43:00.621 --> 00:43:04.910
background and raise them with love and friendship and they could be great

765
00:43:04.911 --> 00:43:06.470
people.
Sure not questioning that.

766
00:43:06.650 --> 00:43:11.650
But what I am questioning is how much of who you are and who your personality

767
00:43:11.751 --> 00:43:15.230
becomes is really based on your genes.
Right.
Don't you know,
I would,

768
00:43:15.290 --> 00:43:19.250
I would really like to know that no matter how much nurture you give somebody,

769
00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:23.120
they might still have a natural proclivity to be addicted to opioids.

770
00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:25.040
It's just like a thing that might happen.

771
00:43:25.070 --> 00:43:28.250
Same with other diseases and mental disorders and who knows?

772
00:43:28.251 --> 00:43:31.760
So you can nurture the hell out of someone.
But at some point when it's,

773
00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:35.930
when those synapses were firing and forming,
even in the womb and you know,

774
00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:39.020
soap opera theme shows are implanting on its brain.

775
00:43:39.021 --> 00:43:42.050
There are studies now that say that even in the womb that early,
you know,

776
00:43:42.051 --> 00:43:45.920
people can,
these messages and memories are in prime planted on the brain.

777
00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:50.780
At some point you pop out and a certain percentage of your path is formed by a

778
00:43:50.781 --> 00:43:54.290
certain percentage of your being is there that's unshakeable and undeniable.

779
00:43:54.830 --> 00:43:56.990
Yeah.
I wonder how much and what that number is.

780
00:43:57.470 --> 00:44:01.730
12 12% 12% seven so that's the over under,

781
00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:04.310
what's the over under?
I think you can nurture,

782
00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:07.670
you can nurture the shit out of most.
Most things.

783
00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:10.550
You can really turn it around at any age.
At any phase.

784
00:44:10.730 --> 00:44:13.280
There's always turnaround stories,
but there are certain,
you know,

785
00:44:13.281 --> 00:44:15.650
we know there are certain genetic markers that mean you're going to be

786
00:44:15.651 --> 00:44:19.010
predisposed to certain things you can do.
No question about it,

787
00:44:19.070 --> 00:44:20.030
no question about it.

788
00:44:20.031 --> 00:44:23.660
Especially when it comes to certain diseases that are just almost unavoidable.

789
00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:24.830
For certain people,

790
00:44:24.831 --> 00:44:29.150
they have to be like really careful about their diet just because their genetics

791
00:44:30.110 --> 00:44:32.340
are set up in a,
you know,
unfortunate.

792
00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:36.960
<v 1>Why?
Yeah.
That's a strange,
strange thing about being a person,
man.</v>

793
00:44:36.990 --> 00:44:41.580
All the variables and then blaming someone for those variables coming out all

794
00:44:41.581 --> 00:44:46.350
fucked up and them being a mess.
Right.
You know,
you need to take accountability,

795
00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:48.240
pull yourself up by your bootstraps.

796
00:44:48.570 --> 00:44:51.390
That's totally true if you can,

797
00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:56.480
but right way it's way better to like figure out a way to mitigate the amount of

798
00:44:57.331 --> 00:45:00.260
people that are fucked up.
Like instead of like saying you know,

799
00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:04.860
need to pull themselves up by their bootstraps.
Probably.
Yeah,
probably.

800
00:45:04.980 --> 00:45:09.060
But also how the fuck did this happen?
Like why are there,
you know,

801
00:45:09.090 --> 00:45:13.860
x amount of million people living in destitute poverty in Los Angeles.
I mean,

802
00:45:13.861 --> 00:45:17.520
how many people are in like severe poverty in Los Angeles?

803
00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:19.950
What is the percentage?
I wouldn't begin to know the number.

804
00:45:20.010 --> 00:45:23.190
I wouldn't know the number,
but it's probably fairly high.
I bet.

805
00:45:23.250 --> 00:45:25.620
I bet it would be a shocking number.
Let's guess

806
00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:28.600
<v 5>if they could afford bootstraps,
they might pull them up</v>

807
00:45:28.690 --> 00:45:32.290
<v 1>stairs.
How many millions are there in Los Angeles?
Like California,</v>

808
00:45:32.291 --> 00:45:36.280
all together as like 20 million or something like that.
All right,
let's,

809
00:45:36.281 --> 00:45:38.590
let's find that out first.
All right.
How many people are in,

810
00:45:38.710 --> 00:45:42.200
<v 5>okay,
so truck is leaving Chicago.
Yes.
Are we,</v>

811
00:45:42.290 --> 00:45:44.090
are we going like what's unemployment

812
00:45:44.140 --> 00:45:47.020
<v 1>or what?
Well,
first of all,
how many people live in la?
How many,</v>

813
00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:52.030
how would you guess,
you guess?
17 million.
17 million.
Okay.

814
00:45:52.031 --> 00:45:56.410
This doesn't make sense cause this only says 3 million.
Okay.

815
00:45:56.860 --> 00:46:00.390
Okay.
The Greater Los Angeles area,
which,
uh,

816
00:46:00.490 --> 00:46:05.490
contains three oh 13 million and over 18 million people in combined statistical

817
00:46:07.301 --> 00:46:11.650
area as recently as 2010.
So somewhere around,

818
00:46:11.651 --> 00:46:14.590
let's just call it somewhere around,
uh,

819
00:46:15.550 --> 00:46:19.360
18 million people.
Right?
Fair enough.
So,
uh,

820
00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:20.680
I forgot what we're talking about,

821
00:46:20.900 --> 00:46:21.070
<v 5>Jack.</v>

822
00:46:21.070 --> 00:46:23.750
We were trying to find out how many people are living in poverty to have that

823
00:46:23.751 --> 00:46:26.820
Jesus Christ.
That's how boring I am.
I bore myself.
Yeah.
Okay.

824
00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:29.930
How many people live in poverty on a photo of a bunch of old dudes fucking and

825
00:46:29.931 --> 00:46:32.240
sucking each other on a hotel bed.
And that's what I've managed to pull up.

826
00:46:33.170 --> 00:46:37.130
What one party,
Bro,
you're not down the line party.

827
00:46:37.310 --> 00:46:41.960
That one's all what line.
Okay,
and party,
right?
Yeah.

828
00:46:41.961 --> 00:46:43.670
Lemon party.
But why did you bring that up?

829
00:46:44.210 --> 00:46:46.790
Because that's what happens when I start typing into a browser.
You're capable,

830
00:46:46.791 --> 00:46:48.950
you're,
you can function and actually solve the problem.

831
00:46:48.951 --> 00:46:52.280
That's all I can do is pull up pictures of old dicks.
That's not true.

832
00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:56.000
I'm not sure what you're trying to say,
but that's not true.
Welcome to my world.

833
00:46:56.001 --> 00:47:00.590
Okay.
I guess I'd employments 19% 27% and in Los Angeles,

834
00:47:01.010 --> 00:47:05.030
27% of all the people in Los Angeles or in poverty and poverty.
Okay.

835
00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:09.650
Wow.
That's crazy.
And so that's insane.

836
00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:11.480
That's a lot of God damn people.
Right?

837
00:47:11.540 --> 00:47:15.110
And there's people that aren't in poverty that have definitely struggled and

838
00:47:15.111 --> 00:47:16.880
worked very hard to not be there.

839
00:47:16.910 --> 00:47:20.840
That immediately assume that the lack of working hard and the lack of a work

840
00:47:20.841 --> 00:47:24.680
ethic is the reason someone who is in poverty is in that case.
You know,

841
00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:28.790
they assume that we are out of work actors though they can't first unemployment.

842
00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:30.340
How many in poverty,

843
00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:32.920
<v 3>how many of them are out of work actors that you can feel sorry for?</v>

844
00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:35.650
Because if he knew them,
they'd be like really annoying.
Be like,
yeah,

845
00:47:35.651 --> 00:47:39.870
who wants to hire that guy?
I don't know.
Dream chasers.
Uh,

846
00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:43.870
a lot of dream chasers in La,
right?
For sure.
Right.

847
00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:48.900
But I think the point that you were getting at is that it's very easy for

848
00:47:49.421 --> 00:47:49.781
people,

849
00:47:49.781 --> 00:47:53.350
especially in a situation of privilege or one where they're not living paycheck

850
00:47:53.351 --> 00:47:55.480
to paycheck or horror.
Who knows what happened in their past.

851
00:47:55.630 --> 00:47:58.960
Maybe they had a family growing up.
It's very easy for them to think.

852
00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:03.820
We all line up at the starting line at age zero,
the gun goes off and all right.

853
00:48:04.150 --> 00:48:06.520
You just didn't want to run fast enough or hard enough.

854
00:48:06.521 --> 00:48:10.390
It doesn't matter that you started off with one leg or you didn't even,

855
00:48:10.450 --> 00:48:13.140
you weren't even at the the stadium for this race.
You know,
it's,

856
00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:16.840
it's hard for people to empathize and realize that we all start off at different

857
00:48:16.841 --> 00:48:19.990
places and in different ways.
We all think we're running the same race.
Well,

858
00:48:19.991 --> 00:48:23.110
it's also a solid fucking race.
That's the other thing.
It's not,

859
00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:26.980
I mean like if one person makes 10 times more money,

860
00:48:26.981 --> 00:48:29.430
but they're fucking miserable in there constantly.
I have a heart attack.

861
00:48:29.460 --> 00:48:33.840
I'm sure a person makes enough to live and then they're happy.
That guy wins.

862
00:48:34.220 --> 00:48:38.050
Like the guy was making enough to pay his bills and feed himself and is having a

863
00:48:38.051 --> 00:48:41.260
chill life and having fun with his friends.
That guy wins over.

864
00:48:41.261 --> 00:48:45.700
The Guy who never sees his family has a heart attack work 16 hours a day.

865
00:48:45.710 --> 00:48:49.780
He's popping Adderall data.
What if he's got a ski market ski,

866
00:48:49.781 --> 00:48:52.740
do like a sweet ski Doo and he's just fun talking about Russian way.

867
00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:54.190
Really rich dude.
Yeah,

868
00:48:54.191 --> 00:48:56.830
like really rich data that we'll have time to be out there ski doing.

869
00:48:56.950 --> 00:49:00.880
I meant the marathon of life,
not the marathon of,
of money.

870
00:49:00.910 --> 00:49:03.760
You know like that people think we line up and we all are afforded the same

871
00:49:03.761 --> 00:49:04.960
privileges.
So look,

872
00:49:04.961 --> 00:49:08.590
even that guy that makes just enough money and is happy with his friends,

873
00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:12.220
he probably started off in a better place than some others around him because

874
00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:15.280
there's no denying should some people are born into this world without families,

875
00:49:15.281 --> 00:49:16.960
without support systems,
without structure.

876
00:49:16.990 --> 00:49:20.270
And it could be that he came up in a horrible environment if I can get it out

877
00:49:20.271 --> 00:49:21.130
and he got through.

878
00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:24.760
But it doesn't mean that everyone should be forced to figure that out on their

879
00:49:24.761 --> 00:49:27.370
own.
Like the idea of not helping people,

880
00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:30.130
it just seems weird that as a government,

881
00:49:30.131 --> 00:49:32.980
like the government doesn't put more emphasis into that.

882
00:49:33.250 --> 00:49:36.780
You would think like there were constantly worried about conflicts overseas when

883
00:49:36.781 --> 00:49:39.100
constantly worried about conflicts,
you know,

884
00:49:39.101 --> 00:49:40.810
in places where we're never going to go.

885
00:49:41.090 --> 00:49:45.970
But the conflict that's causing murder and our own neighborhoods and cities is

886
00:49:45.971 --> 00:49:50.770
almost like it's the root cause of it is never totally completely addressed like

887
00:49:50.771 --> 00:49:51.461
Chicago,

888
00:49:51.461 --> 00:49:55.150
like what's going on in Chicago with all the insane amounts of murder and

889
00:49:55.151 --> 00:49:58.300
violence and Detroit.
It's obviously got a lot big problems.

890
00:49:58.301 --> 00:49:59.920
He does lots of cities in this country there.

891
00:50:00.130 --> 00:50:05.130
People are dying left and right and it's very likely a direct result of this

892
00:50:05.950 --> 00:50:10.300
crazy infrastructure problem that we have where there's a giant percentage of

893
00:50:10.301 --> 00:50:15.010
people that are living in poverty and until they figure out a way to like sue

894
00:50:15.011 --> 00:50:15.844
that down,

895
00:50:16.180 --> 00:50:20.050
it's going to always fuel those conspiracy theories are people like this is by

896
00:50:20.051 --> 00:50:24.280
plan to government wants everyone to be huddled up together,

897
00:50:24.281 --> 00:50:28.190
angry and fighting over scraps of bread.
You know,
that's the,
that's

898
00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:31.880
<v 1>the plan.
Like to keep the people week and keep them scared and you know,</v>

899
00:50:31.940 --> 00:50:36.140
bring them into these environments and forced them to compete for very limited

900
00:50:36.141 --> 00:50:39.230
resources to so that they're always fucked up and they never really have a

901
00:50:39.231 --> 00:50:41.990
chance to organize and figure out the system and,

902
00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:43.940
and restructure and create their own.

903
00:50:43.970 --> 00:50:46.520
Come up with her own fucking Krypto currencies,
right?

904
00:50:47.060 --> 00:50:47.630
<v 4>I,
you know,</v>

905
00:50:47.630 --> 00:50:52.630
the argument that I see all the time is can't give a handout or can't have a

906
00:50:53.181 --> 00:50:56.300
social safety net because someone else is going to take advantage of that and no

907
00:50:56.301 --> 00:50:59.720
one else should be rewarded for being lazy.
And I go,
look,
yeah,

908
00:50:59.721 --> 00:51:03.110
there are certainly cases of that and that exists and it sucks and we should

909
00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:07.830
prosecute those cases violently.
Fuck those people.
Even Violin,
Limu,

910
00:51:07.940 --> 00:51:10.250
I mean with,
with passion,
not violently,

911
00:51:10.251 --> 00:51:14.120
but like with passionate people get crazy with their violence and passion.
Yeah.

912
00:51:14.270 --> 00:51:17.390
It's the same thing,
Joe,
to same thing.
I'm punching her.

913
00:51:17.391 --> 00:51:21.350
It's out of extreme passion.
Christ son much settled down,

914
00:51:21.710 --> 00:51:25.220
so it's easy to go,
hey,
I don't want anybody taking advantage of me.

915
00:51:25.221 --> 00:51:28.160
How dare you be lazy and suckle from the government t whatever else.

916
00:51:28.250 --> 00:51:32.240
It's very easy to understand your neighbor taking advantage of you,
right?

917
00:51:32.241 --> 00:51:35.030
You work hard,
you come home,
you see your neighbor not working as hard,

918
00:51:35.180 --> 00:51:39.440
how dare he get any leg up.
But the real abuse,

919
00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:43.220
the real systemic abuse in the real fleecing is happening at such a,

920
00:51:43.221 --> 00:51:47.600
at the corporate and political level in such a great way that it's so hard for

921
00:51:47.601 --> 00:51:49.580
us,
I think for many to wrap their brains around.

922
00:51:49.910 --> 00:51:51.740
And it's a lot easier to point to the,

923
00:51:51.930 --> 00:51:56.000
the abuse and the laziness of a neighbor and not the abuse of,
of uh,

924
00:51:56.300 --> 00:51:57.133
of a government.

925
00:51:57.240 --> 00:52:01.140
<v 1>Yeah,
that's,
that is absolutely true.
And it's also one of those things,</v>

926
00:52:01.141 --> 00:52:04.140
like we were talking about earlier with the cops enforcing the law,

927
00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:08.730
if that's the system that's in place,
that system's fucked up.
Like ethically,

928
00:52:08.731 --> 00:52:13.731
people understand that the amount of money that was moved around during that

929
00:52:14.761 --> 00:52:19.230
whole collapse in the economy and the amount of money that was moved around

930
00:52:19.231 --> 00:52:22.550
during the wars,
well,
during the,
during the wars for sure.
I mean they're,

931
00:52:22.570 --> 00:52:25.560
they're finding there's something like 50,000 troops are like ghosts.

932
00:52:26.070 --> 00:52:28.670
They're not really people and they're somehow or another,

933
00:52:28.680 --> 00:52:32.190
these 50,000 people are getting checks.
And you know,

934
00:52:32.430 --> 00:52:33.660
who knows where the fuck that's going.

935
00:52:33.661 --> 00:52:38.661
Either it's complete waste and incompetence or someone's like filtering off that

936
00:52:38.791 --> 00:52:41.880
money somehow and putting it somewhere and sure using it for some,

937
00:52:41.930 --> 00:52:43.790
<v 4>there's always stories.
Billions unaccounted for,</v>

938
00:52:43.791 --> 00:52:45.590
trillions of dollars unaccounted for,

939
00:52:45.591 --> 00:52:48.800
all this corruption thing all day they get vehicles and they burned them so they

940
00:52:48.801 --> 00:52:51.500
can order more because then they get to skim off the top.

941
00:52:51.501 --> 00:52:55.700
Like there's story after story of this happening and when you talk about
Chicago,

942
00:52:55.910 --> 00:52:59.180
you know what helped there.
But some schools maybe,
maybe a community garden,

943
00:52:59.450 --> 00:53:00.950
who knows some music,
get up,

944
00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:04.420
get the kid's a fucking Tuba and a teacher that's compensated to,

945
00:53:04.550 --> 00:53:05.690
to teach them how to use it.

946
00:53:05.810 --> 00:53:10.040
That doesn't cost trillions and trillions of dollars per sure.

947
00:53:10.630 --> 00:53:13.330
<v 1>And you know,
it's also when we were talking about earlier with quotas,</v>

948
00:53:13.810 --> 00:53:17.350
like quotas sort of put a machine in place.
Yes,

949
00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:22.440
almost make it where it's to their benefit to continue to allow a certain amount

950
00:53:22.781 --> 00:53:26.010
of crime so they could continue to have certain amount of people that they

951
00:53:26.011 --> 00:53:26.844
arrest.

952
00:53:26.970 --> 00:53:31.970
And it's almost like that with when you have gigantic corporations that

953
00:53:32.011 --> 00:53:36.870
contribute money towards towards candidates that they know it would be more

954
00:53:36.871 --> 00:53:40.290
likely to engage in military conflict.
You know,
and we've seen,

955
00:53:40.500 --> 00:53:45.210
you've seen direct results of relationships between these gigantic corporations

956
00:53:45.211 --> 00:53:47.570
like Hal Haliburton or you know,

957
00:53:48.180 --> 00:53:52.230
<v 5>that's the even rapid scan getting these scanners in.
It's an offshoot of the,</v>

958
00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:52.830
<v 1>of the war.</v>

959
00:53:52.830 --> 00:53:56.820
There's just so much money involved and that money's been going back and forth

960
00:53:56.821 --> 00:53:58.260
through these people for so long.

961
00:53:58.261 --> 00:54:01.680
It almost becomes impossible to stop because it's like,
hey,

962
00:54:01.681 --> 00:54:06.330
we're going to come along and tell you that you can't make $1 billion a year

963
00:54:06.331 --> 00:54:10.530
anymore,
and then you're going to go,
no,
fuck that.
I make $1 billion everywhere.

964
00:54:10.710 --> 00:54:13.170
This is what I do.
I make $1 billion every year.
They go,
no,
no,
no.

965
00:54:13.171 --> 00:54:16.500
You're not going to make $1 billion anymore because what you're doing,

966
00:54:16.620 --> 00:54:19.520
we're not going to let you do anymore.
We're going to make it illegal.
What?

967
00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:22.860
Illegal to kill people in another country to make $1 billion.
Dude,

968
00:54:22.861 --> 00:54:25.530
how am I going to make $1 billion if I can't kill people in another country?

969
00:54:25.531 --> 00:54:30.180
I need to make tanks and I make fucking jets that shoot rockets I need to make

970
00:54:30.190 --> 00:54:33.640
<v 5>does money.
New Granite counter in my 12 home.
Yep.
In the Hamptons.</v>

971
00:54:33.670 --> 00:54:37.540
People don't ever want to downsize.
No.
They want to push further.
You know?

972
00:54:37.541 --> 00:54:42.420
So like if a guy's,
what stock is celebrated for maintaining none.
No Shit.

973
00:54:42.660 --> 00:54:45.350
That that grass needs to go up.
That's what did the stocks,
yeah.

974
00:54:45.490 --> 00:54:48.670
<v 1>Businesses have this weird thing like they want to make more money every year</v>

975
00:54:48.850 --> 00:54:49.690
and that's,
I mean,

976
00:54:49.691 --> 00:54:54.190
I guess that's the deal with inflation that every year the money's not worth as

977
00:54:54.191 --> 00:54:56.790
much or more money is,
but still,
no,
you want

978
00:54:56.840 --> 00:55:01.160
<v 5>bigger house?
I want a bigger car.
I'll fuck up,
up,
up.
Can I move up in this world?</v>

979
00:55:01.161 --> 00:55:04.070
Jetson,
you know,
like people get crazy.
I need music.

980
00:55:04.071 --> 00:55:07.430
Reactive LEDs in my pussy at home.
We need to restructure.

981
00:55:07.431 --> 00:55:10.610
Society got damn and Kevin Prayer.
You need to run for government here.
Joe Rogan.

982
00:55:10.611 --> 00:55:12.290
It starts right here.
Are you ready to run for government?

983
00:55:12.291 --> 00:55:15.650
Are you ready to be a president?
Skeletons yet.
Oh,
I have many,

984
00:55:15.651 --> 00:55:17.210
but I've let most of them out myself,

985
00:55:17.820 --> 00:55:21.400
but cowboy hats on them and bring them around,
but you know,

986
00:55:21.470 --> 00:55:23.990
government isn't where you could make a change like that.
Unfortunately,

987
00:55:24.310 --> 00:55:27.230
you're buying into a system where you're beholden to fundraising,

988
00:55:27.231 --> 00:55:30.440
which then you're beholden to the people who gave you that money.
I have

989
00:55:30.450 --> 00:55:35.450
<v 1>a feeling that the way the technology of the world is progressing,</v>

990
00:55:36.431 --> 00:55:40.120
like we have this idea,
follow me on this.
Yup.

991
00:55:40.150 --> 00:55:44.800
We have this idea that the law that's in place now as far as the laws that are

992
00:55:44.801 --> 00:55:45.430
in place,

993
00:55:45.430 --> 00:55:50.140
like how fast you can drive and what's legal and what's illegal.

994
00:55:50.470 --> 00:55:54.160
These are all in place and enforced in a system that we have all agreed to.

995
00:55:54.380 --> 00:55:56.890
We've all agreed to this system because it's been in place for a long time.

996
00:55:57.070 --> 00:56:02.020
There's the firemen,
there's the policemen.
These are iconic figures.

997
00:56:02.021 --> 00:56:06.160
I know the colors of their vehicles.
This is a regular part of our culture,

998
00:56:06.970 --> 00:56:11.970
but as the Internet expands and we start wearing these head pieces that can

999
00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:17.200
communicate with each other through Wifi and and send thoughts from brain to

1000
00:56:17.201 --> 00:56:19.560
brain,
which they've already proved they can do over the Internet.
Correct.

1001
00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:23.680
We're going to get to a point,
we're going,
why is this system place?

1002
00:56:23.710 --> 00:56:26.500
Why do we need the system?
This system is just,
you're,

1003
00:56:26.501 --> 00:56:31.300
you're saying you're in charge and I'm saying the people that said someone could

1004
00:56:31.301 --> 00:56:35.470
be in charge.
We're from a totally different world.
Okay?

1005
00:56:35.590 --> 00:56:38.590
They weren't even from,
they're not even from Earth.

1006
00:56:38.740 --> 00:56:43.720
They're from earth 1776 and there was nothing going on then.
Okay.

1007
00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:48.840
You add a pasture and you're shooting bows and arrows and animals to try to stay

1008
00:56:49.031 --> 00:56:51.070
alive.
You're growing some fruits and vegetables.

1009
00:56:51.071 --> 00:56:54.040
You're building a boat in case you got to get the fuck Outta here of some other

1010
00:56:54.041 --> 00:56:56.740
people show up and they have cannons pointing in your direction and you're

1011
00:56:56.741 --> 00:57:00.430
living in an incredibly simple world.

1012
00:57:00.670 --> 00:57:03.490
The world of today.
I would,

1013
00:57:03.580 --> 00:57:08.580
I would say there's a good deal of what is going on in the world today,

1014
00:57:09.430 --> 00:57:14.430
especially in terms of what kind of communications we're able to pass back and

1015
00:57:14.951 --> 00:57:15.640
forth to each other.

1016
00:57:15.640 --> 00:57:19.960
What kind of information we're able to spread and what,

1017
00:57:19.961 --> 00:57:24.160
what kind of messages and interactions you can get from,
which is this giant,

1018
00:57:24.161 --> 00:57:24.581
giant,

1019
00:57:24.581 --> 00:57:29.581
giant group of people like worldwide and like people can agree or disagree or be

1020
00:57:29.711 --> 00:57:34.711
outraged or or or or be be kind and sensitive like all of it can happen in these

1021
00:57:36.401 --> 00:57:40.570
big giant waves going over like a whole planet that's,

1022
00:57:40.810 --> 00:57:42.310
this is a different time.

1023
00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:47.640
The whole thing's different and as soon as we figure out a way to to interface

1024
00:57:47.651 --> 00:57:50.920
with each other like completely and totally all the time,

1025
00:57:51.100 --> 00:57:54.190
we're going to have to rethink like a lot of the laws that we have in place,

1026
00:57:54.340 --> 00:57:56.230
the lot of the laws of don't we're going to like,
wow,

1027
00:57:56.260 --> 00:57:58.870
why is this law still around?
Because someone's profiting from it.

1028
00:57:59.050 --> 00:57:59.801
Is that what we're doing,

1029
00:57:59.801 --> 00:58:04.090
where we've set up these situations where we have a steady stream of money

1030
00:58:04.091 --> 00:58:07.240
coming in that you guys are addicted to.
So because you guys are addicted,

1031
00:58:07.241 --> 00:58:07.780
this money,

1032
00:58:07.780 --> 00:58:11.020
you're going to put like 16 year old kids in jail because they're selling
joints.

1033
00:58:11.210 --> 00:58:11.831
Are you gonna you're gonna,

1034
00:58:11.831 --> 00:58:15.730
you're gonna take people that are doing things that they should absolutely have

1035
00:58:15.731 --> 00:58:19.810
the right to do.
If you can buy cigarettes,
if you can drive a motorcycle,

1036
00:58:19.811 --> 00:58:21.250
if you can fill in the blank,

1037
00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:24.910
there's a million fucking dangerous things that we allow on a regular basis.

1038
00:58:25.060 --> 00:58:27.850
But you're telling that kid he can't have mushrooms,
right?
Because what?

1039
00:58:27.880 --> 00:58:32.020
Because you say so.
Fuck you.
Who are you?
Have you ever done mushrooms?
Why?

1040
00:58:32.021 --> 00:58:34.900
Why are you saying he can't do it?
This is our problem.

1041
00:58:34.930 --> 00:58:38.470
Our problem is our system is archaic.

1042
00:58:38.680 --> 00:58:42.370
It's not caught up to,
to who we are as human beings today.

1043
00:58:42.520 --> 00:58:44.710
It's not cut up to the way we interact with each other.

1044
00:58:44.860 --> 00:58:48.400
It's just not this idea of a representative government where I can represent

1045
00:58:48.401 --> 00:58:50.170
myself so you can represent yourself too.

1046
00:58:50.420 --> 00:58:55.180
This isn't 18 six in fucking Philadelphia where you had to get a guy and pick up

1047
00:58:55.181 --> 00:59:00.010
your handwritten scrawl on some fucking shitty piece of paper and put your stamp

1048
00:59:00.011 --> 00:59:03.010
on it and hand it to him and he writes right a fucking horse into town and

1049
00:59:03.011 --> 00:59:05.740
deliver it to other people.
It's different fucking world.

1050
00:59:05.800 --> 00:59:09.160
I don't need a representative government.
We represent each other.

1051
00:59:09.310 --> 00:59:11.020
The more segmented that we get,

1052
00:59:11.021 --> 00:59:13.780
the more like the smaller everything shrinks down.

1053
00:59:14.140 --> 00:59:18.910
We should all be in charge of our own thoughts.
Okay?

1054
00:59:19.030 --> 00:59:23.690
And if we all vote a popular for the entire United States and it comes out all

1055
00:59:23.691 --> 00:59:26.960
fucked up and things go chaotic,
guess what that means?

1056
00:59:27.080 --> 00:59:31.730
You engineered a system where half the people are fucking retarded,
guaranteed.

1057
00:59:31.940 --> 00:59:33.440
And this is what happens when you do that.

1058
00:59:33.620 --> 00:59:37.310
This is what happens when you don't take advantage of the number one resource

1059
00:59:37.311 --> 00:59:40.160
human beings have,
which is other human beings you don't like.

1060
00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:44.600
Pump these people up and try to make them productive members of society that are

1061
00:59:44.780 --> 00:59:48.160
competing alongside of everyone else and,
and,

1062
00:59:48.161 --> 00:59:51.590
and producing alongside of everyone else and interacting and being a part of

1063
00:59:51.591 --> 00:59:53.060
communities.
No,
you just say,

1064
00:59:53.210 --> 00:59:57.080
just leave them in their little shitty spot and fuck them.
And when you do that,

1065
00:59:57.140 --> 00:59:58.730
if you actually have a common vote,

1066
00:59:58.940 --> 01:00:00.950
have you ever had actually have a popular vote?

1067
01:00:01.100 --> 01:00:05.240
You're going to deal with a huge number of uneducated people.

1068
01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:09.500
A huge number of disenfranchised people that grew up in fucked up households,

1069
01:00:09.740 --> 01:00:13.770
crazy fucking parents and drugs and meth and fucking how many are that?

1070
01:00:13.771 --> 01:00:16.790
It's millions and millions.
And they could vote.
Everyone can vote,

1071
01:00:16.850 --> 01:00:19.850
everyone can vote.
Have you got a popular vote?
You got a real fucking problem.

1072
01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:24.080
And that has to be one of the things that they were thinking of when they made

1073
01:00:24.081 --> 01:00:27.440
this whole electoral college system.
And you know,
they,
when they,

1074
01:00:27.470 --> 01:00:31.340
when they created like a representative government,
they had to let go on.

1075
01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:36.200
Can't just like,
everybody can't just have a vote.
It's still too crazy.

1076
01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:37.160
It's too crazy.

1077
01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:41.990
<v 4>You know?
I agree.
I don't know that that was,
that was for a nefarious reasons.</v>

1078
01:00:41.991 --> 01:00:45.140
I mean at the time just the technology alone for that wouldn't have happened.

1079
01:00:45.141 --> 01:00:47.900
I mean they would still be counting votes were by hand and by candle light,

1080
01:00:48.010 --> 01:00:51.820
<v 1>but I think if they did allow for a popular vote it was probably problematic.</v>

1081
01:00:51.821 --> 01:00:53.490
Even back then you had a lot of apes,

1082
01:00:53.610 --> 01:00:56.110
you know like these motherfuckers are going to get to get what we need is one

1083
01:00:56.111 --> 01:00:56.321
dude.

1084
01:00:56.321 --> 01:00:59.800
We can really trust that he gets to say what the fuck and state's going to do as

1085
01:00:59.801 --> 01:01:02.540
in Doug's edge.
Edumacated get him in there and he won't speak for us.

1086
01:01:02.570 --> 01:01:05.860
It's a total illiterate June of of a choice.
Cause he me,

1087
01:01:05.861 --> 01:01:09.460
you kind of had a choice but you only have a choice to get to choose who chooses

1088
01:01:09.461 --> 01:01:13.480
for you,
which is crazy.
Right?
It's,
I'm on not a baby,

1089
01:01:13.630 --> 01:01:16.930
it's 2014 I'm not a baby.

1090
01:01:17.010 --> 01:01:19.860
<v 4>But also he looked the to play devil's advocate,</v>

1091
01:01:19.890 --> 01:01:22.750
the amount of time and energy and resources that you,

1092
01:01:22.860 --> 01:01:26.910
that that any of us would have to devote to paying attention to everything

1093
01:01:26.911 --> 01:01:30.480
that's coming down the pipe politically,
legislatively,
what,

1094
01:01:30.510 --> 01:01:34.110
however you want to look at it.
It would be a full time job for all of us to be,

1095
01:01:34.230 --> 01:01:36.450
to be well reasoned and well educated on all issues.

1096
01:01:36.451 --> 01:01:41.451
So I do see the merit in having someone appointed to maybe advise you to give

1097
01:01:41.551 --> 01:01:45.690
you an opinion on something,
but at the end of the day,
if I want to cast a vote,

1098
01:01:45.691 --> 01:01:49.380
I should directly be able to do that.
If I'm not there,
you do it on my behalf.

1099
01:01:49.550 --> 01:01:49.731
<v 1>Well,</v>

1100
01:01:49.731 --> 01:01:54.731
we need to do first and foremost is all laws which are in place that don't

1101
01:01:55.311 --> 01:01:59.600
involve a victim,
right?
Morality laws,
St Long victimless crime,

1102
01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:04.840
all laws that pertain to you deciding what you can and cannot do with your own

1103
01:02:06.140 --> 01:02:09.530
person,
your body,
your mind,
where you live,
all those things,

1104
01:02:10.010 --> 01:02:12.380
all those laws should be taken off the books.

1105
01:02:12.381 --> 01:02:14.660
Like let's just start from scratch because that,
those are ridiculous.

1106
01:02:14.661 --> 01:02:17.870
You got admitted all these crazy drug laws.

1107
01:02:17.871 --> 01:02:19.830
If you could go buy

1108
01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:24.000
<v 2>prescription drugs at any pharmacy or your doctor can,
you could say,
Hey,</v>

1109
01:02:24.001 --> 01:02:25.470
I've got this issue,
blah,
blah,
blah.

1110
01:02:25.740 --> 01:02:28.020
Your doctor decides you need some pain pills you bought.

1111
01:02:28.021 --> 01:02:28.831
I don't know how many they give you.

1112
01:02:28.831 --> 01:02:30.840
They give you a 30 they give you a month's worth.

1113
01:02:31.020 --> 01:02:32.190
Maybe you have to take two a day.

1114
01:02:32.191 --> 01:02:35.970
Maybe they give you 60 just swallow all 60 of them with a bottle of whiskey and

1115
01:02:35.971 --> 01:02:39.960
you're dead.
Okay?
Everyone can do that.
So if that's the case,

1116
01:02:40.530 --> 01:02:44.760
you can't decide what other shit people can't do.
You can't.

1117
01:02:44.761 --> 01:02:47.910
You're not allowed to because you haven't made any sense because the choices

1118
01:02:47.911 --> 01:02:51.750
that you've allowed that you have tax stamps on their murderous,

1119
01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:55.620
they kill hundreds of thousands of people,
whether it's cigarettes or alcohol,

1120
01:02:55.621 --> 01:02:58.500
standing on moral quicksand like you're sinking,
you talking crazy.

1121
01:02:58.501 --> 01:03:02.670
I know that you're being bought and paid for and you can't run everybody.

1122
01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:06.120
If you're clearly being bought and paid for that,
you can't do that.

1123
01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:08.890
<v 4>Now what happens when you say like,
listen,</v>

1124
01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:12.770
and some places it's still illegal to have anal sex still is.
It's amazing.

1125
01:03:12.771 --> 01:03:16.390
It's crazy.
Yeah.
But the act of it or the fact that it's illegal,
both,
right.

1126
01:03:17.060 --> 01:03:19.570
The fact that it's illegal,
it's the,
the,
the horrible.
So,

1127
01:03:19.580 --> 01:03:22.780
so now it becomes illegal and you say,
well,
there's no,
there's no victims.
Yeah.

1128
01:03:22.781 --> 01:03:26.540
Everybody wants to consent.
That's great.
So what happens when I go to the park?

1129
01:03:26.810 --> 01:03:31.310
And two people are just exploiting it.
They are raw dogging as hard as they can.

1130
01:03:31.311 --> 01:03:35.460
And Nick to the seesaw.
Now,
am I a victim in this or is this there?

1131
01:03:35.750 --> 01:03:38.060
Or is this their freedom of expression?
Okay.

1132
01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:40.430
Is it their right to be able to fuck wherever?

1133
01:03:40.431 --> 01:03:42.920
Because we would've been able to when we were sitting by,
you know,

1134
01:03:43.220 --> 01:03:46.640
campfires and living in caves.
That's a very good point.
You know,

1135
01:03:46.641 --> 01:03:47.510
I mean seen you draw the line

1136
01:03:47.510 --> 01:03:48.410
<v 2>in that sense,</v>

1137
01:03:48.411 --> 01:03:52.370
community should be able to decide what they accept and they don't accept in

1138
01:03:52.371 --> 01:03:57.340
their community where it may possibly,
um,
uh,

1139
01:03:57.360 --> 01:03:57.890
what's the best way

1140
01:03:57.890 --> 01:03:59.410
<v 4>or to use,
because in that case,</v>

1141
01:03:59.411 --> 01:04:02.770
I'm going right up to the county line and I'm fucking everything that I can just

1142
01:04:02.771 --> 01:04:05.380
across the border so the kids can see it when they're getting out of school.

1143
01:04:05.730 --> 01:04:08.290
Illegal in my town.
Sorry,
kids.
I don't know if it will work.

1144
01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:13.220
<v 2>Probably think of,
see it,
it's probably still illegal.
Probably had rules though,</v>

1145
01:04:13.250 --> 01:04:15.920
but I was trying to figure out what you think.
So,
yeah,
I don't think so.

1146
01:04:15.921 --> 01:04:19.000
I think everybody's fucking say that that would be a,
a law.
The,

1147
01:04:19.001 --> 01:04:20.340
the way you could say that you could,

1148
01:04:20.390 --> 01:04:24.050
you'd have a victim there is cause you expose people to very uncomfortable

1149
01:04:24.051 --> 01:04:27.200
things that the,
you don't necessarily have to do.

1150
01:04:27.380 --> 01:04:29.510
Like you're imposing upon them.

1151
01:04:29.780 --> 01:04:34.220
The visual image and the act of something with a lot of people think is grody.

1152
01:04:34.250 --> 01:04:37.700
<v 4>So as a,
as a,
as a staunch Vegan Joe Rogan,</v>

1153
01:04:37.730 --> 01:04:41.030
I'm offended when I see that Hunka red meat on the plate at the restaurant and

1154
01:04:41.031 --> 01:04:44.210
I'm walking by and it's on the street.
So no more steaks on curbside.

1155
01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:46.820
You gotta be inside.
You can't have a stake in the afternoon.

1156
01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:49.700
<v 2>I bet there's people who would argue that.
Right.
It's crazy that there are,</v>

1157
01:04:49.701 --> 01:04:53.300
there are certain hardcore vegans that probably are very angry when they walk by

1158
01:04:53.301 --> 01:04:55.580
a restaurant and they see plates of meat outside.

1159
01:04:56.050 --> 01:04:58.780
<v 4>They're a pita members that don't want to see your dogs on a leash because you</v>

1160
01:04:58.781 --> 01:05:02.620
shouldn't own an animal.
Yeah.
Dare you.
Well,
that's the animal liberation people.

1161
01:05:02.621 --> 01:05:04.630
Those,
those people are off the charts.
Sure.
Oh,

1162
01:05:04.631 --> 01:05:06.910
there's some panel members that also,
do we know about that?

1163
01:05:06.910 --> 01:05:10.450
<v 2>About the lobster folks know what's the lobster [inaudible] lobster liberation</v>

1164
01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:14.410
people with claws?
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
These people break into the restaurants,

1165
01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:17.800
get lobsters and paste them in the ocean.
Yes,
they do.

1166
01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:20.740
<v 1>They kick open like the front door to the red lobster and go to the aquarium in</v>

1167
01:05:20.741 --> 01:05:22.600
the lobby and just started yanking them out.

1168
01:05:22.660 --> 01:05:26.590
They go to sea food stores and the break in the middle of the night and steal

1169
01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:29.130
all the lobsters out of their tanks and then release them in the,

1170
01:05:29.190 --> 01:05:31.910
it's gotta be a fetish right there.
Fucking something going on there.

1171
01:05:31.980 --> 01:05:36.250
Are you ever had a claw job?
You were trying really hard today.

1172
01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:42.190
You never had one.
I'll let you answer that.

1173
01:05:42.191 --> 01:05:45.190
Do you think I've had a claw job?
No.
Joe Rogan.
I don't think you have.

1174
01:05:45.191 --> 01:05:47.920
And that's why I don't think you're in a position to judge anyone on it.

1175
01:05:47.921 --> 01:05:51.440
So how about that,
what they're doing then?
They're not raping the lobsters there,

1176
01:05:51.850 --> 01:05:53.880
there liberating them.
They really,
uh,

1177
01:05:53.910 --> 01:05:57.580
they really liberating lobster here in lies the issue when you propose the

1178
01:05:57.581 --> 01:06:00.850
Utopia of,
let me vote for me.
Let me have a say.

1179
01:06:00.851 --> 01:06:04.210
It's a victimless crime because everybody at some point Topia for everybody to

1180
01:06:04.211 --> 01:06:07.810
get a choice.
Isn't that seem crazy?
That that's utopia.
That's what I mean.

1181
01:06:07.811 --> 01:06:11.140
That's what was being proposed as right.
Like this is even a start,

1182
01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:13.600
a better story,
a better,
better place,

1183
01:06:13.780 --> 01:06:17.410
but someone's always going to feel victimized for sure.
Always.
Oh,
for sure.

1184
01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:20.980
So how do you police that?
Well,
I think,
here's,
here's my thoughts on it.

1185
01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:25.150
One of the big ones is if everything did go to popular vote and we would really

1186
01:06:25.151 --> 01:06:28.420
like this.
A recent Gallup poll,
one of the crazier ones,

1187
01:06:28.421 --> 01:06:31.870
it was something in the neighborhood of 40 something percent of people believe

1188
01:06:31.871 --> 01:06:35.120
the earth is less than 10,000 years old.
People that they polled,
you know,

1189
01:06:35.250 --> 01:06:36.880
they believe in the biblical account of the Earth.

1190
01:06:37.300 --> 01:06:40.900
When you have a giant number of people in this country,

1191
01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:44.980
a giant number that are growing up,
as we said,

1192
01:06:45.010 --> 01:06:49.690
in poverty or in,
you know,
in crime ridden neighborhoods in,

1193
01:06:49.730 --> 01:06:53.770
in areas where they're not getting a lot of education or the not getting a lot

1194
01:06:53.771 --> 01:06:56.860
of positive role models and there's just millions and millions of people that

1195
01:06:56.861 --> 01:07:00.570
perpetuate the same sort of cycle.
If you have a popular vote there,

1196
01:07:00.571 --> 01:07:03.640
can I get the phone?
It's going to be crazy.
Everyone's going to get the vote.

1197
01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:08.050
So the those millions can like,
they can sway a politician one way or other.

1198
01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:12.370
So there's politicians that would purposely try to keep people ignorant.

1199
01:07:12.371 --> 01:07:15.820
There's politicians that will purposely play to people's ignorance like forget

1200
01:07:15.821 --> 01:07:18.280
about what if you just release it as a popular vote.

1201
01:07:18.460 --> 01:07:23.460
The world like we're going to realize like we have a fucked up balance of how

1202
01:07:23.561 --> 01:07:26.560
many people are impoverished,
how many people in an educated,

1203
01:07:26.561 --> 01:07:29.260
how many people have no hope?
There's a fucked up balance.

1204
01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:31.150
If that balance doesn't get addressed.

1205
01:07:31.390 --> 01:07:35.110
Like if you had something like an Internet vote where everyone gets to vote

1206
01:07:35.140 --> 01:07:38.980
online,
you know you'll,
everyone has their own device.
You all vote.
It's ever,

1207
01:07:39.020 --> 01:07:42.220
it's like an APP.
You,
you get on your phone,
everybody can get it.
Sure.

1208
01:07:42.370 --> 01:07:43.000
Pretty much.

1209
01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:47.470
You know everybody's got a cell phone or someone they know at least to have an

1210
01:07:47.471 --> 01:07:50.620
internet connection and worldview.
Sure.
You do it like that.
No.

1211
01:07:50.621 --> 01:07:52.810
If you looked at the world,
you can go to other countries,
man.

1212
01:07:52.811 --> 01:07:54.670
I mean a good percentage of people.

1213
01:07:54.671 --> 01:07:57.550
There's more cell phones on earth right now than there are humans.

1214
01:07:57.551 --> 01:07:59.140
But that's mostly because like,
you know,

1215
01:07:59.141 --> 01:08:03.130
some people have four phones to one house.
That's still an incredible number.

1216
01:08:03.131 --> 01:08:08.131
When you consider there's seven goddamn billion people on this planet and those

1217
01:08:08.201 --> 01:08:11.620
numbers,
man,
I mean that's,
we're talking,
that's,
this is,

1218
01:08:11.780 --> 01:08:15.860
this is like a crazy amount of human beings.
If every one,
three,

1219
01:08:15.870 --> 01:08:19.820
all 350 million,
you know,
everyone over 18,
whenever that is,
200 million,

1220
01:08:19.821 --> 01:08:24.620
whatever the number is,
if all those people got to vote,
like on everything,

1221
01:08:24.621 --> 01:08:27.620
on everything we decide and all sorts of options were on the table,

1222
01:08:27.621 --> 01:08:31.430
not just democratic for options versus Republican options,
you know,

1223
01:08:31.431 --> 01:08:34.520
of a PR representative or a president.
But everything we do,

1224
01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:38.900
everything we do from reparations for slavery,
how about that gets introduced.

1225
01:08:39.020 --> 01:08:42.740
How about they want,
uh,
African Americans to get money?

1226
01:08:42.741 --> 01:08:44.930
The same way American Indians get money.

1227
01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:47.570
American Indians that are forced to live on reservations,

1228
01:08:47.571 --> 01:08:50.690
a lot of times they get money,
right?
Like people that live in Alaska,

1229
01:08:50.691 --> 01:08:53.390
they get money from the oil companies.
They get like a check.

1230
01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:56.780
If you're an Alaska resident,
they get like a check every month,

1231
01:08:57.140 --> 01:08:59.810
so there's going to be like votes like,
Hey,
okay,

1232
01:08:59.811 --> 01:09:03.770
well how come you have money that goes to people in Alaska and you got money for

1233
01:09:03.771 --> 01:09:05.820
people over here?
Why don't we give money to black people?

1234
01:09:05.980 --> 01:09:10.270
<v 3>Verizon put in a fake tree cell phone tower two blocks from my house,</v>

1235
01:09:10.540 --> 01:09:12.820
which I'm sure has given me all sorts of cancers,

1236
01:09:12.821 --> 01:09:16.810
which will show up in a few years' time and there was a city hall meeting about

1237
01:09:16.811 --> 01:09:20.350
it.
Not a vote,
but they had a meeting about it.
That tower goes up,

1238
01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:22.360
they're going to make some money off that.
Right.

1239
01:09:22.361 --> 01:09:24.940
It's going to serve as customers.
It's directly affecting me.

1240
01:09:24.941 --> 01:09:28.540
I didn't have a say and my bill's not going down because they're allowed to

1241
01:09:28.541 --> 01:09:31.600
expand.
It's that that kind of should,
I would love to have a say on,

1242
01:09:31.601 --> 01:09:33.280
but then you look at local elections,

1243
01:09:33.281 --> 01:09:36.100
look at the cycle that we just had here where you know,

1244
01:09:36.101 --> 01:09:37.900
half the population didn't vote at all.
Yeah.

1245
01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:41.800
They had the ability to on issues that affected them,
but they didn't.

1246
01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:45.280
It's not that easy to move either,
man.
If you wanted to get out of your place,

1247
01:09:45.281 --> 01:09:48.220
you don't have to sell it and trust someone fucking house today and not losing

1248
01:09:48.221 --> 01:09:52.120
money market as goofy as fuck.
It's all confusing.

1249
01:09:52.121 --> 01:09:53.940
Like how much is the house worth?
You know,

1250
01:09:53.970 --> 01:09:56.980
if you really stop and think about how much,
how much people's houses cost.

1251
01:09:57.330 --> 01:10:01.210
Like have you ever been to places where the houses are extremely overvalued?

1252
01:10:01.470 --> 01:10:05.170
If you ever been in California,
most shorts.
Yeah.

1253
01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:08.970
Have you ever been to like the bay area?
Like silicone from there?
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.

1254
01:10:09.130 --> 01:10:11.560
That is a crazy place to be now.

1255
01:10:11.590 --> 01:10:14.410
And there's all these stories that are being written on San Francisco at about

1256
01:10:14.411 --> 01:10:18.400
how many tech millionaires are moving up there and the prices of things are just

1257
01:10:18.401 --> 01:10:22.690
crazy high.
Like a regular house is like $2 million,

1258
01:10:22.900 --> 01:10:25.510
two point $3 million and you go,
whoa,
Whoa,
whoa.

1259
01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:27.190
They were trying to explain to me when I was up there,

1260
01:10:27.191 --> 01:10:28.660
this guy was pointing at this house,

1261
01:10:28.740 --> 01:10:31.600
said that house sold for three and a half million dollars and I'm like,

1262
01:10:31.601 --> 01:10:34.300
you're crazy.
That's not real.
It's a real tear down,

1263
01:10:34.301 --> 01:10:37.540
but when they build something new on it,
it'll be great.
No,
it was a nice house.

1264
01:10:37.541 --> 01:10:40.030
It was a nice house.
Was in normal looking nice house,

1265
01:10:40.031 --> 01:10:42.880
but it was a small like regular house.

1266
01:10:42.881 --> 01:10:47.290
It wasn't a three and a half million dollar house.
It was like like a $500,000.

1267
01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:48.850
Sure.
It was a nice,
that's a nice house.

1268
01:10:48.851 --> 01:10:53.140
You can get a nice house for $500,000 and I was like,
what?
How?
How has that work?

1269
01:10:53.290 --> 01:10:57.550
I don't demand supply and demand.
Like how many people are billionaires up here?

1270
01:10:57.760 --> 01:11:02.620
Like what kind of a crazy hive of cash is up in that spot?

1271
01:11:02.830 --> 01:11:07.720
All has having to do with technology.
Oh,
having to do with the Internet.

1272
01:11:07.990 --> 01:11:12.990
All having to do with future advances like Tesla Motors,

1273
01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:14.070
shit like that.
They're

1274
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:17.310
<v 1>all up there.
Yeah.
All those fucking Google people.
They're all up there.</v>

1275
01:11:17.540 --> 01:11:19.490
<v 4>That's what you pay the price to be in that vicinity.</v>

1276
01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:22.840
You pay the price to be near those engineers and those venture capitalists and

1277
01:11:22.841 --> 01:11:26.630
those angel investors do.
That's what you're buying into as the proximity.

1278
01:11:26.770 --> 01:11:30.550
<v 1>I have a friend who's renting a house in Atherton.
The house,</v>

1279
01:11:30.610 --> 01:11:34.540
the house is worth like $15 million.
It doesn't make any sense.

1280
01:11:34.541 --> 01:11:37.360
It's just a regular house.
It's a regular fucking house,

1281
01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:39.550
but you go in the yard and the yard is pretty big,

1282
01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:41.590
so it's worth like $15 million.
So I'm like,

1283
01:11:41.591 --> 01:11:44.230
that is the craziest fucking thing I've ever heard in my life.

1284
01:11:44.260 --> 01:11:45.270
Have you been down to snow set,

1285
01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:48.910
<v 4>Santa Monica Silicon beach now as they're rebranding it?
Same thing's happening.</v>

1286
01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:52.440
<v 1>Well,
Venice as well,
Callan sold his place in Venice.</v>

1287
01:11:52.590 --> 01:11:56.090
He sold it in one day and he made money off of it.
He's like,

1288
01:11:56.370 --> 01:11:58.920
Google is like opening up some thing down in Venice.

1289
01:11:58.921 --> 01:12:00.330
So they're just buying up property.

1290
01:12:00.331 --> 01:12:05.331
These crazy millionaire fucking ones and zero people come into town moneybag it

1291
01:12:06.690 --> 01:12:09.870
up.
You have,
you hate that?
No,
I don't hate it.

1292
01:12:09.871 --> 01:12:12.300
I love the fact that they create technology right.
I mean,

1293
01:12:12.310 --> 01:12:14.340
I don't hate the fact that they're getting Richie cause that's where the

1294
01:12:14.341 --> 01:12:15.180
headsets coming from.

1295
01:12:15.181 --> 01:12:18.870
That's how we're all going to communicate coming from you or I sir.
No,

1296
01:12:18.871 --> 01:12:21.050
I mean I have no problem with,
I've,

1297
01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:25.350
I'm just fascinated by trends and I'm absolutely fascinated by,

1298
01:12:25.590 --> 01:12:29.280
I don't like the fact that people who,
uh,

1299
01:12:29.310 --> 01:12:32.520
make a moderate amount of money or being pushed out of neighborhoods that bums

1300
01:12:32.521 --> 01:12:32.860
me out,

1301
01:12:32.860 --> 01:12:36.750
especially people that have had friends grow up in that neighborhood and they,

1302
01:12:36.751 --> 01:12:36.961
you know,

1303
01:12:36.961 --> 01:12:39.300
the kids go to school and the neighborhood and they're being pushed out because

1304
01:12:39.301 --> 01:12:41.580
houses are becoming extremely expensive.
Right.

1305
01:12:41.610 --> 01:12:46.610
Which is unfortunately a big problem and a big byproduct of this whole tech

1306
01:12:47.911 --> 01:12:50.280
boom,
you know,
money grab,
it's like these,

1307
01:12:50.310 --> 01:12:52.470
these are so many people up there that are making so much money.

1308
01:12:52.860 --> 01:12:56.310
It's like way more than we could ever wrap our heads around.
You know,

1309
01:12:56.311 --> 01:12:59.070
like there's like a bunch of billionaires up there like a gang of them

1310
01:12:59.170 --> 01:13:02.650
<v 4>and we say billion and we think we can fathom that.
Like,
Oh yeah,
I get a billion.</v>

1311
01:13:02.651 --> 01:13:04.810
Sure.
But you can imagine that in monopoly money,

1312
01:13:04.930 --> 01:13:06.970
not none of us know what $1 billion.

1313
01:13:06.971 --> 01:13:10.570
Truly like the notion that you could not spend enough money fast enough,

1314
01:13:10.730 --> 01:13:13.340
nobody goes,
oh,
of course I could.
I'd blow up space station.
Yeah.

1315
01:13:13.380 --> 01:13:17.470
You literally couldn't spend money fast enough before you died to spend all the

1316
01:13:17.471 --> 01:13:18.150
money you have.

1317
01:13:18.150 --> 01:13:19.920
<v 1>Yeah.
It wasn't until it's unfathomable.</v>

1318
01:13:19.950 --> 01:13:23.460
It would literally wouldn't be physically possible.
I know some billionaires,

1319
01:13:23.580 --> 01:13:28.060
it's very weird.
Even when I'm around him I get nervous
too rich.

1320
01:13:28.770 --> 01:13:30.390
It's too rich.
It's weird.

1321
01:13:30.420 --> 01:13:32.910
What pay grade or you come like most comfortable around.

1322
01:13:32.911 --> 01:13:35.850
I like where do you hold that make around a hundred grand a year.

1323
01:13:36.570 --> 01:13:39.930
That sounds pretty solid list.
Yeah,
like hundred grands.

1324
01:13:39.931 --> 01:13:43.380
Like you could pay your bills but you're not getting crazy.
Right.
You know,

1325
01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:46.560
it's like when they get into that keeping up with the Joneses level,

1326
01:13:46.561 --> 01:13:49.980
when they get into the millions,
when you start making a lot of money,
especially,

1327
01:13:50.010 --> 01:13:52.290
uh,
I think if you're like one of those Wall Street cats,

1328
01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:55.110
you're dealing with a bunch of other people around you that you're trying to

1329
01:13:55.111 --> 01:13:59.520
keep up with.
Well there Brian houses in the Hamptons and you're buying,
you know,

1330
01:13:59.700 --> 01:14:03.930
they're buying the s five 50 and you know,
and like,
Whoa,
I've got to keep up.

1331
01:14:04.140 --> 01:14:07.410
And I think they get trapped in that sort of,
uh,

1332
01:14:07.980 --> 01:14:11.690
keeping up with the Joneses and they becomes everything that that becomes the

1333
01:14:11.710 --> 01:14:12.520
reward

1334
01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:15.100
<v 3>for,
for extracting ones and zeroes.</v>

1335
01:14:15.101 --> 01:14:19.240
So it's all about making more see more success.
You know,

1336
01:14:19.241 --> 01:14:23.290
dog eat dog,
you know,
go for the jugular and then get the,

1337
01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:26.800
get the house that shows you got the higher level of what'd that fucking goofy

1338
01:14:26.801 --> 01:14:30.000
game you're playing destiny.
It's their version of desks that,

1339
01:14:30.001 --> 01:14:31.900
but I'll let it slide,
but they have a house in the Hamptons,

1340
01:14:31.901 --> 01:14:34.600
she shouldn't present it.
It's a real,
their version of tyrosine has anything.

1341
01:14:34.690 --> 01:14:36.790
Why is it,
why was that goofy game?
It's really,

1342
01:14:36.791 --> 01:14:41.110
it's a phenomenal game and level raids.
I love you,

1343
01:14:41.111 --> 01:14:43.930
but if you're a goofy man,
here's,
here's the thing.

1344
01:14:46.210 --> 01:14:49.750
It's not a bad to be goofy.
I'm goofy as fuck.
You know?

1345
01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:54.280
I think at that point the,
the,
when a bank balance defines you,
it's like,

1346
01:14:54.310 --> 01:14:55.390
it's not like they're,

1347
01:14:55.391 --> 01:14:58.300
they're just amassing this cause they have this greedy pit and they wanted in

1348
01:14:58.301 --> 01:15:00.970
greed,
greed,
greed,
greed,
greed.
I think it's actually more human than that.

1349
01:15:00.971 --> 01:15:04.150
I think it's,
I've,
I've tried to look at those that have,
that,

1350
01:15:04.151 --> 01:15:07.750
that are in the game for extreme wealth for shifting one's and zero's solely in

1351
01:15:07.751 --> 01:15:09.050
their favor.
Um,

1352
01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:13.300
I feel sorry for them because I feel like that's what defines them and wouldn't

1353
01:15:13.410 --> 01:15:16.660
we all like to be the best version of ourselves that we could be.

1354
01:15:16.810 --> 01:15:19.090
And for those people sometimes I think that that's,

1355
01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:21.820
they think that that's the best version of them is the wealthiest version of

1356
01:15:21.821 --> 01:15:22.090
them.

1357
01:15:22.090 --> 01:15:26.590
I also think it's very convenient to feel sorry for them because like everyone

1358
01:15:26.591 --> 01:15:29.110
in life,
there's a giant spectrum.

1359
01:15:29.260 --> 01:15:32.830
So there must be amongst super ball or billionaires,

1360
01:15:32.831 --> 01:15:37.660
a dune who is having a fucking blast,
whose life should be a movie,

1361
01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:40.480
who's kind and friendly and considerate,

1362
01:15:40.630 --> 01:15:45.630
but is just banging tens in his yacht all over the planet.
Like,
whew,

1363
01:15:45.780 --> 01:15:49.180
the guys just live in the most crazy,
ridiculous,
fun,

1364
01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:54.480
loving party ever and he happens to be like a super successful entrepreneur

1365
01:15:55.001 --> 01:15:56.620
slash businessman character.

1366
01:15:56.621 --> 01:15:59.800
It's gotta be Ilan [inaudible] possible that someone could be that person,

1367
01:15:59.801 --> 01:16:01.600
but we don't associate that associate that.

1368
01:16:01.720 --> 01:16:03.820
We always assume that if someone is successful,

1369
01:16:03.970 --> 01:16:08.950
if he is some Rolls Royce driving,
look at my mansion,
look at all of my property,

1370
01:16:08.951 --> 01:16:12.280
I've got with zero money down and Dan girls are behind them dancing.

1371
01:16:12.430 --> 01:16:15.280
We assume that guy's a piece of shit,
right?
We always do.

1372
01:16:15.281 --> 01:16:19.810
We always assume that anybody who becomes like stupid Uber,

1373
01:16:19.811 --> 01:16:24.400
like private jet successful,
you know,
we always assume that they're assholes,

1374
01:16:24.460 --> 01:16:25.450
right?
They must be.

1375
01:16:25.630 --> 01:16:29.330
There's no way he could be that like Richard Branson is the only guy.
People go,

1376
01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:33.160
man,
I don't know.
He seems cool and want to love them,

1377
01:16:33.161 --> 01:16:37.360
but it seems cool.
Richard Branson seems cool.
He's got the long hair.

1378
01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:39.700
He says nice things.
He donates a lot of money.

1379
01:16:39.940 --> 01:16:42.040
He's got like a lot of charitable causes.

1380
01:16:42.041 --> 01:16:45.070
He's got a lot of like interesting philanthropic causes.

1381
01:16:45.071 --> 01:16:50.020
Interesting prospects in terms of technology involved in the whole virgin space

1382
01:16:50.021 --> 01:16:53.800
flight.
Tolling.
Yeah.
I mean he's a baller.
He's a super billionaire guy,

1383
01:16:53.801 --> 01:16:57.820
but he's Kinda nice like,
no,
who's hating Annette?
You're Branson.

1384
01:16:58.150 --> 01:16:59.470
He seems like a sweet dude.

1385
01:16:59.471 --> 01:17:03.550
Like he's like the best example of what could be possible if someone was like

1386
01:17:03.551 --> 01:17:08.000
some super baller capitalists,
but it's like really kind of Nice and chill.
Right?

1387
01:17:08.140 --> 01:17:12.200
He was in that fucking high movie man.
Branson was,
yes.
Nice.
Yes.

1388
01:17:12.201 --> 01:17:15.260
He did an interview in the culture high about marijuana.

1389
01:17:15.810 --> 01:17:19.550
I saw a tweet the tweet the other day about,
we love possession laws.

1390
01:17:19.551 --> 01:17:21.350
What the fuck?
Come on guys.
I'm like,
yeah,
good.

1391
01:17:21.351 --> 01:17:24.340
He doesn't have to worry about that at his level.
Exactly.
Fuck yeah.

1392
01:17:24.350 --> 01:17:28.520
Richard Branson's down.
He's like the coolest billionaire ever.
One of them,

1393
01:17:28.580 --> 01:17:31.270
I think he Lorenzo for teens,
musket billionaire by now for Tito.

1394
01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:33.860
The guys who own the UFC,
they're pretty fucking cool.
Yeah.

1395
01:17:33.890 --> 01:17:34.810
Those guys are billionaires.

1396
01:17:34.840 --> 01:17:38.870
They're the only billionaires I feel comfortable around.
They're really friendly.

1397
01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:40.050
Like Franklin.

1398
01:17:40.070 --> 01:17:43.800
Lorenzo always been like super cools made the guys who own the UFC there,

1399
01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:46.670
they're billionaires.
They don't like 20 something casinos.

1400
01:17:47.510 --> 01:17:49.790
I think 22 Jesus fucking Christ.

1401
01:17:49.791 --> 01:17:53.060
Think about that in Vegas specifically are around the country or I don't know.

1402
01:17:53.061 --> 01:17:55.970
I never counted,
but uh,
I think most of them are in Vegas,

1403
01:17:56.020 --> 01:17:57.710
but because all those station casinos,

1404
01:17:57.711 --> 01:18:01.600
they own all those [inaudible] there's a level of money that you,

1405
01:18:01.700 --> 01:18:06.700
certain people get to where it's clear that they're competing with a very small

1406
01:18:07.071 --> 01:18:10.700
group of other assholes that are making stupid amounts of money to like the

1407
01:18:10.701 --> 01:18:13.610
Forbes high score list.
Yeah.
Got To get number 12.

1408
01:18:13.660 --> 01:18:17.210
You know what I look at every year?
I look at like the most expensive yachts.

1409
01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:22.250
Like yachts are crazy.
I can't fucking bully Elan Musk.
Yeah,

1410
01:18:22.310 --> 01:18:26.660
he's in the bill.
1.1 billion on paper.
Yesterday.
Yeah.
Yesterday.

1411
01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:31.160
Just yesterday.
You made a million over the last,
um,
oh my God.

1412
01:18:31.161 --> 01:18:34.230
Deserves every penny.
I know what happened,
uh,

1413
01:18:34.250 --> 01:18:38.210
as shares any tests has motors gained nearly 14%.
So yeah,

1414
01:18:38.211 --> 01:18:40.760
but that could go away tomorrow.
That's fluctuating.
That's not fair.

1415
01:18:40.761 --> 01:18:44.410
That's kind of sneaky.
Those sneaky fucking numbers play an asshole cylinder.

1416
01:18:44.510 --> 01:18:47.360
If he decides to cash out today.
It's real.
Yeah,
that is true.
It's real.

1417
01:18:47.361 --> 01:18:50.650
It's very real money.
He's not going to,
but I forgot my point.

1418
01:18:50.651 --> 01:18:52.040
What I'm curious about what I was talking about.

1419
01:18:52.130 --> 01:18:54.170
You said some billionaires make you uncomfortable.

1420
01:18:54.171 --> 01:18:56.960
Have you been in the room with a billionaire who said something or done

1421
01:18:56.961 --> 01:19:01.690
something?
[inaudible]
babies,
but that's normal.
That's what everybody does mean.

1422
01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:03.980
Did they marinate over that 48% tax bracket?

1423
01:19:04.010 --> 01:19:07.040
Is there any barbecue sauce or would they just,
oh no,
I've met,

1424
01:19:07.100 --> 01:19:11.580
I've met quite a few over my years of working for the UFC.
And um,

1425
01:19:11.690 --> 01:19:15.170
I think the weird thing about human beings is yos expect while these people are

1426
01:19:15.171 --> 01:19:17.840
going to be fucking different,
you know,
I've met royal people,

1427
01:19:17.870 --> 01:19:22.100
I've met royalty in a,
especially in the Arab Emirates,
United Arab Emirates,

1428
01:19:22.580 --> 01:19:26.540
and a normal regular folks.
Like I talk to them,
super friendly,
super normal.

1429
01:19:26.720 --> 01:19:30.830
I know a dude who's,
you know,
he's a royalty and he listens to my podcast,

1430
01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:33.670
like gets weird shit.
That's amazing.
Yeah.

1431
01:19:33.710 --> 01:19:35.720
But when you're around him after like a minute,

1432
01:19:35.750 --> 01:19:38.620
you forget that he's a royalty in wants talk MMA,
right.

1433
01:19:38.621 --> 01:19:40.880
And then wants to talk techniques,
wants to talk.
Uh,
you know,

1434
01:19:40.881 --> 01:19:42.770
what happened with that?
Why did this go wrong?

1435
01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:45.440
What do you think his prospects are like?
Dudes like a super fan.

1436
01:19:45.770 --> 01:19:49.280
So we have these awesome like technical conversations about strategies and
stuff.

1437
01:19:50.110 --> 01:19:52.560
<v 0>Can I choke him with diamonds and rings?</v>

1438
01:19:53.500 --> 01:19:58.420
Can I put faithful the bombing in his mouth?
Cause I do.
I have large rope.

1439
01:19:58.421 --> 01:20:02.590
Gold Rope.
Yeah.
Get in nick,
good in octagon.
Eileen,

1440
01:20:02.650 --> 01:20:06.940
Eileen chopper on him.
By the way,
I,

1441
01:20:07.180 --> 01:20:08.040
you must have,

1442
01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:11.280
<v 4>I know you have analytics so you know how many people listened to your podcast,</v>

1443
01:20:11.281 --> 01:20:13.110
but in your heart of hearts,

1444
01:20:13.111 --> 01:20:17.700
do you really understand the reach that your voice has on a weekly basis?

1445
01:20:18.210 --> 01:20:23.010
It's insane.
No,
I think,
no,
I think it's fucking beautiful,
man.
I was,

1446
01:20:23.250 --> 01:20:25.770
I went on a Iowaska journey.
I was in Iquitos,

1447
01:20:25.771 --> 01:20:28.590
Peru and I have the 20 some odd people there.

1448
01:20:28.591 --> 01:20:30.660
I texted you while I was there saying,
hey man,

1449
01:20:30.870 --> 01:20:35.010
every fucking morning your name comes up over eggs.
And,
and lentils,

1450
01:20:35.190 --> 01:20:36.023
like people are taught,

1451
01:20:36.030 --> 01:20:40.350
like you drew people there from all over the world at all ages,

1452
01:20:40.351 --> 01:20:41.580
all walks of life,

1453
01:20:41.790 --> 01:20:46.250
all coming there based off of hearing you interview people and talk about this

1454
01:20:46.251 --> 01:20:48.250
and I was buying too disavow

1455
01:20:48.250 --> 01:20:51.520
<v 1>all knowledge of you bring up this subject.</v>

1456
01:20:51.610 --> 01:20:53.470
I didn't know that this is going to be discussed.

1457
01:20:53.471 --> 01:20:55.210
I would have spoken with my attorney.

1458
01:20:55.420 --> 01:20:57.750
I believe what those people are doing is illegal.
Uh,

1459
01:20:57.860 --> 01:20:59.500
that's why I haven't done it for real.

1460
01:20:59.510 --> 01:21:02.320
It's one per room to be clear in our country.

1461
01:21:02.470 --> 01:21:06.430
I think someone was actually trying to pass a law saying that if you violate a

1462
01:21:06.431 --> 01:21:11.320
law outside of America,
can't talk about it and no,
but that's an American law.

1463
01:21:11.321 --> 01:21:15.040
You can be tried for it in America.
God,
I forget the particulars.

1464
01:21:15.041 --> 01:21:16.150
I hate when I do that.

1465
01:21:16.151 --> 01:21:20.980
But it was so bizarre because someone was saying that it would be in protection

1466
01:21:20.981 --> 01:21:25.780
of children having like going over and having like sex with a child.

1467
01:21:25.781 --> 01:21:29.520
Prostitutes.
I'm heading to Bora Bora.
Yeah,
you're going to 12 year olds now.

1468
01:21:29.580 --> 01:21:31.300
I'm counting the fort back here.
Exactly.

1469
01:21:31.301 --> 01:21:34.690
You could be [inaudible] as a pedophile and a rapist in America.

1470
01:21:34.840 --> 01:21:37.600
But then people said,
but yeah,
but you could apply those to drug laws.

1471
01:21:37.601 --> 01:21:40.800
So you go to Portugal and smoke weed all day and then I'd come back to America

1472
01:21:40.801 --> 01:21:44.560
and you arrest me or go to Peru and have an IOWASCA ceremony.

1473
01:21:44.710 --> 01:21:48.280
I want ask a sneaky though,
dude,
because it's not technically illegal.

1474
01:21:48.550 --> 01:21:52.780
It's in a weird classification cause it's not really die trip to me.

1475
01:21:52.781 --> 01:21:56.500
What it is is a brew of a bunch of plants that are all legal.

1476
01:21:56.710 --> 01:21:58.660
All those plants are illegal.
You know,

1477
01:21:58.661 --> 01:22:03.520
you could buy most of the ingredients for Iowasca online because it's legal.

1478
01:22:03.550 --> 01:22:04.383
Correct.
They're not.

1479
01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:09.480
There's too much DMT out there and plants to make every plant that has DMT in it

1480
01:22:09.940 --> 01:22:10.773
illegal.

1481
01:22:10.780 --> 01:22:15.780
So you could conceivably come up with some form of all IOWASCA is all you're,

1482
01:22:16.600 --> 01:22:21.370
you're making is an orally active version of DMT,
DMT,

1483
01:22:21.371 --> 01:22:25.060
which has been proven to be produced in the human brain.

1484
01:22:25.510 --> 01:22:28.060
Your lungs produce it,
your liver produces it.

1485
01:22:28.061 --> 01:22:31.630
It's incredibly potent psychedelic drug that your body makes.

1486
01:22:32.110 --> 01:22:35.230
And unfortunately it's in everything.

1487
01:22:35.260 --> 01:22:38.680
It's in so many different plants and vegetables that our body has ways of

1488
01:22:38.681 --> 01:22:39.191
dealing with it.

1489
01:22:39.191 --> 01:22:42.970
And one of the ways is this stuff called Mano aiming oxidase is the long and

1490
01:22:42.971 --> 01:22:43.810
boring version of it,

1491
01:22:44.070 --> 01:22:47.380
but your body produces model Amy [inaudible] days and it destroys DMT when

1492
01:22:47.381 --> 01:22:52.120
you're digesting it orally.
But if you take it with what's called harming,

1493
01:22:52.130 --> 01:22:56.800
which is unnatural Mao inhibitor,
it becomes this crazy drug that you can drink.

1494
01:22:56.920 --> 01:23:01.390
So you can get an orally active DMT trip,
but that's not totally illegal.

1495
01:23:01.391 --> 01:23:06.310
But DMT is elite,
right?
You have extracted that is illegal,

1496
01:23:06.340 --> 01:23:08.470
but if you have the plants,
that's fine.

1497
01:23:08.580 --> 01:23:09.840
<v 4>It's so funny.
It's like the,
the,</v>

1498
01:23:10.020 --> 01:23:13.770
the gun analog is that an ar 15 is illegal in the state of California.

1499
01:23:13.771 --> 01:23:17.130
You can't buy one.
Right?
Right.
But you can certainly fucking build one.
Yeah.

1500
01:23:17.220 --> 01:23:18.390
It's really easy to do.

1501
01:23:18.391 --> 01:23:21.870
There are whole communities built around that where once you have it,

1502
01:23:21.871 --> 01:23:25.190
it's okay to have exactly.
Because you made it,
there's a loophole for Ya.

1503
01:23:25.220 --> 01:23:27.780
So it's like fuck.
It's like the,
the component is illegal,

1504
01:23:27.781 --> 01:23:32.080
but the sum of all the parts is totally fine.
Yeah.
Very weird know.

1505
01:23:32.140 --> 01:23:34.920
There's a lot of weird laws,
man.
There's a lot of weird laws.

1506
01:23:35.130 --> 01:23:38.760
I was at the shot show two years ago and I saw that like,

1507
01:23:38.761 --> 01:23:40.290
cause we will explain what the shots are.

1508
01:23:40.291 --> 01:23:45.180
Shot show is comic con for law enforcement.
It is,
it is,
you know Ted Nugent,

1509
01:23:45.181 --> 01:23:46.980
they're selling fucking beef,
beef,

1510
01:23:47.010 --> 01:23:52.010
Ben Venison Jerky and flaming bow and arrows and guys selling kits to modify or

1511
01:23:52.141 --> 01:23:56.370
dodge Durango.
So you can hide three weapons in the center console during Avn.

1512
01:23:56.371 --> 01:24:00.380
Awesome.
Exactly.
Yeah.
It's a law enforcement and adult superstars.

1513
01:24:00.450 --> 01:24:02.340
It's enforcement and what they've created

1514
01:24:05.180 --> 01:24:07.990
and uh,
they're babies.
You know,
I went,

1515
01:24:08.280 --> 01:24:12.480
I went to this booth that allows you a rude,
I say that twice.

1516
01:24:12.481 --> 01:24:17.260
So they sold a piece of a,
of an ar.
Basically it was a bolt on for,
for a,

1517
01:24:17.261 --> 01:24:19.610
a a semiautomatic weapon that if you do,

1518
01:24:19.800 --> 01:24:23.550
if you held the trigger or held this handle with enough force and held down the

1519
01:24:23.551 --> 01:24:23.911
trigger,

1520
01:24:23.911 --> 01:24:28.230
the natural recoil of the rifle would automatically chamber the next round and

1521
01:24:28.231 --> 01:24:32.730
fire it.
So it turned a non assault rifle or non automatic weapon into one.

1522
01:24:32.790 --> 01:24:35.700
And it could retrofit all these guns.
And they were,
you know,

1523
01:24:35.701 --> 01:24:38.880
they had a big banner that said California friendly.
Come on guys,

1524
01:24:38.881 --> 01:24:43.800
legal and good old CA.
And that was a real rude awakening for the whole,

1525
01:24:43.801 --> 01:24:46.780
well I think we need,
we need stricter gun laws and we need some,

1526
01:24:46.781 --> 01:24:49.860
some we need to get down on paper exactly what you can and can't own and wine.

1527
01:24:49.861 --> 01:24:50.610
It's like,
no,

1528
01:24:50.610 --> 01:24:55.320
they'll just figure out a way to make it limbo under whatever legal bar you set

1529
01:24:55.321 --> 01:24:58.080
and it's done game over.
Well,
we've got to really figure out a way,

1530
01:24:58.190 --> 01:25:00.760
<v 1>keep mentally ill people from getting guns.
Right.
You know,</v>

1531
01:25:00.830 --> 01:25:05.830
and make sure that they do like the people that have guns,

1532
01:25:06.290 --> 01:25:08.990
have them locked somewhere.
You have to have it locked.

1533
01:25:09.530 --> 01:25:13.250
You can't have it so you're crazy.
Son can come home and raid your gun cabinet.

1534
01:25:13.251 --> 01:25:15.740
Like the Newtown,
Connecticut thing.
That's what happened.
Right.

1535
01:25:15.741 --> 01:25:18.800
It was like the guy rated his mom's guns or something like that.

1536
01:25:19.340 --> 01:25:21.770
I don't remember the exact story,
but it wasn't his,

1537
01:25:21.771 --> 01:25:26.771
but you got to make it harder to get them and you got to make sure that we have

1538
01:25:27.030 --> 01:25:28.010
a good account,

1539
01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:32.270
like a good audit of all the crazy people who can figure out how crazy they are.

1540
01:25:32.300 --> 01:25:35.480
<v 4>How can it be harder to adopt a pet in certain places?</v>

1541
01:25:35.481 --> 01:25:38.900
Like there's home inspections and background checks and all sorts of,

1542
01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:42.410
it's harder to get an animal than it is to get weapons in certain areas of this

1543
01:25:42.411 --> 01:25:44.500
country.
A car drive a car.
Sure.

1544
01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:48.590
<v 1>You have to take a license to drive a car.
It's difficult.
Like kids freak out,</v>

1545
01:25:48.591 --> 01:25:50.600
they're panicking.
Then make sure they come to a complete stop,

1546
01:25:50.630 --> 01:25:54.320
look left look right.
You know,
but a gun.
There you go.

1547
01:25:55.380 --> 01:25:58.400
<v 4>My pappy used is Corolla for hunting,
so God dammit,</v>

1548
01:25:58.550 --> 01:26:01.580
I deserve to be able to drive one if he hands it to me.
This is a video of it.

1549
01:26:01.580 --> 01:26:01.580
You have a

1550
01:26:01.580 --> 01:26:03.710
<v 1>dude hitting a deer,
his bike,</v>

1551
01:26:04.010 --> 01:26:06.830
<v 2>he's riding his bike down a hill,
like going pretty fast.</v>

1552
01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:11.360
And this deer just perfectly t bones,
I'm or he teens and deer.

1553
01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:16.190
And it goes flying and the most uncomfortable part is the end.

1554
01:26:16.370 --> 01:26:19.240
The hear him moaning like after he hits,
the guy's like,

1555
01:26:19.460 --> 01:26:23.830
oh,
and you know,
Oh,

1556
01:26:24.040 --> 01:26:27.220
poor pastor was that.
That was the end of them.
I don't know if he dies.

1557
01:26:27.221 --> 01:26:29.420
I think he just got fucked up.
I mean,

1558
01:26:29.421 --> 01:26:32.360
you hit a deer on your bike and you're going 30 something miles an hour or

1559
01:26:32.361 --> 01:26:35.540
whatever the hell he was going.
He went flying.
It'll collapse in escolade.

1560
01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:39.170
So imagine that on your little bike.
Yeah.
Big One can,
right?

1561
01:26:39.260 --> 01:26:41.860
There's some big ones too,
man.
Especially in the north,
you know you can,

1562
01:26:41.890 --> 01:26:44.590
you could hit one that's like 200 plus pounds.
Did every,

1563
01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:47.390
were you hunting where you were up hunting something in the news recently,

1564
01:26:47.430 --> 01:26:52.310
weren't you Canada?
Yeah,
I shot a moose with,
what were the rifle now?

1565
01:26:52.311 --> 01:26:56.240
Shit.
That's the head over there.
Oh,
that's,
that's there.
That's it.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1566
01:26:56.840 --> 01:26:59.550
Wow.
Did you use,

1567
01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:02.480
did you say like a sweet eighties action film line before you pulled the
trigger?

1568
01:27:02.510 --> 01:27:04.430
No,
I did not.
I did not have much time.

1569
01:27:04.610 --> 01:27:07.370
We saw it coming out of the woods or walking through the woods.

1570
01:27:07.371 --> 01:27:11.540
We had a small area where could shoot it or even some sort of bluff or where we

1571
01:27:11.541 --> 01:27:11.840
were.

1572
01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:14.150
We were actually just coming down this road and we saw it on the side of the

1573
01:27:14.151 --> 01:27:16.520
road.
It was just total dumb luck.
Wow.
Yeah.

1574
01:27:16.521 --> 01:27:20.570
Moose hunting is a tricky thing to do unless they're in the Rut,

1575
01:27:20.630 --> 01:27:22.970
which means unless they're breathing,
if they're breathing,

1576
01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:24.920
you can kind of find them.
You can call the man.

1577
01:27:25.100 --> 01:27:28.130
But we got there a little late so they were done breeding,

1578
01:27:28.131 --> 01:27:33.060
so we had to literally just walk around and drive around and try a shot,

1579
01:27:33.110 --> 01:27:37.280
a load and he was doing the lazy wattle most likely to get a sandwich.

1580
01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:40.110
Most likely he was walking around because he was still looking for some postal.

1581
01:27:40.120 --> 01:27:43.640
He was a few guys.
It was three.
I am at the nightclub.
He was that goose.

1582
01:27:44.420 --> 01:27:47.690
He's the last call most cause there is a few of them that were fighting.

1583
01:27:47.691 --> 01:27:51.620
We've found this dust up in the middle of a street or a dirt road.

1584
01:27:51.621 --> 01:27:54.230
Rathers would say that definitely not street.
There was no,
no,

1585
01:27:54.260 --> 01:27:58.640
nothing was paved up there.
But um,
these,
uh,
there was like hair everywhere.

1586
01:27:58.641 --> 01:28:03.641
Tufts for a little bit of blood and like this big scuffle in the middle.

1587
01:28:03.920 --> 01:28:08.570
And you can tell by looking at it that these two giant Moose had just started

1588
01:28:08.571 --> 01:28:11.840
smashing heads together.
They were like claiming this area.

1589
01:28:12.050 --> 01:28:16.580
And so like all around,
you know,
this huge like patch of dirt,

1590
01:28:16.850 --> 01:28:19.220
which salt fucked up with hair and dirt.

1591
01:28:19.221 --> 01:28:22.310
And imagine being there while that's going on and you can cue sticks and

1592
01:28:22.311 --> 01:28:25.430
Barstools I was like,
fuck you man,
you're dealing with my dirt patch.

1593
01:28:25.430 --> 01:28:28.100
1400 pound animals often.

1594
01:28:28.250 --> 01:28:32.150
And they have like what looks like a giant saloon door growing off the side of

1595
01:28:32.151 --> 01:28:34.430
their head.
And then there's slamming,

1596
01:28:35.090 --> 01:28:38.000
slamming the saloon doors into each other.

1597
01:28:38.420 --> 01:28:42.200
I mean they have fucking giant trees growing out of their head and they're

1598
01:28:42.201 --> 01:28:43.850
smashing into each other with these things.

1599
01:28:43.851 --> 01:28:47.390
And these things are huge and if you want,
they're like way bigger than a horse.

1600
01:28:47.420 --> 01:28:49.670
They like tower of a horse.
They're really long legged.

1601
01:28:49.940 --> 01:28:54.440
Like when we saw one walk across the road,
we were on the,
on this,
um,

1602
01:28:54.680 --> 01:28:58.850
this,
uh,
this one road and uh,
like in it was all snowy,

1603
01:28:59.030 --> 01:29:02.250
but up ahead like around the corner,
like out steps,

1604
01:29:02.250 --> 01:29:06.750
<v 1>something that is impossibly big,
just way bigger than the truck that we're in.</v>

1605
01:29:06.751 --> 01:29:08.330
Like,
wait,
like if we had hit it,

1606
01:29:08.820 --> 01:29:12.840
the top of the truck would have smashed into the bottom of the Moose.

1607
01:29:12.920 --> 01:29:16.530
Like that's how big it was.
There were enormous,
they don't even look real.

1608
01:29:16.680 --> 01:29:20.790
Like if you didn't know Moose was real and it was like a legendary creature and

1609
01:29:20.791 --> 01:29:23.670
then you were driving down the road and you saw one walked cross,

1610
01:29:23.700 --> 01:29:26.610
it would affect the rest of your life.
You'd be like,

1611
01:29:26.611 --> 01:29:29.820
I can't believe I saw a moose.
I thought they were legendary.

1612
01:29:29.970 --> 01:29:32.290
I thought it was like a fucking Unicorn.
Oh,
Unicorn.

1613
01:29:32.291 --> 01:29:36.390
Get one who are in the middle of his head.
He's magic.
Get the fuck Outta here.

1614
01:29:36.391 --> 01:29:39.480
That thinks stupid.
That's a terrible place for a horn.
Looked at this thing.

1615
01:29:39.660 --> 01:29:41.610
This thing has giant paddles.

1616
01:29:41.850 --> 01:29:44.640
These huge tree branches growing off the side of his head.

1617
01:29:44.640 --> 01:29:47.490
You wouldn't believe it was real.
You would think you'd seen some hobbit shit.

1618
01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:50.880
You'd seen some Lord of the rings thing.
You know some,

1619
01:29:50.950 --> 01:29:54.690
it was like it really like a game of Thrones animals on a real animal.

1620
01:29:54.780 --> 01:29:59.340
Giant Moose does.
Big fucking forest horse just wanders across the road.

1621
01:29:59.580 --> 01:30:02.170
So do you have to stop and just wait for it to cross because there's nothing,

1622
01:30:02.370 --> 01:30:04.470
I mean,
oh yeah.
I mean you don't want to hit it for sure.

1623
01:30:04.471 --> 01:30:05.850
Of course you want to hit,
yeah.
You don't want to just,

1624
01:30:06.060 --> 01:30:09.000
I wonder if they're not clear.
Let's go here.
Not Smart.

1625
01:30:09.630 --> 01:30:13.500
I mean they will fuck up.
Especially when they're horny.
Apparently they,

1626
01:30:13.501 --> 01:30:15.150
they try to fuck everything when they're born.

1627
01:30:15.480 --> 01:30:19.020
They'll come over and try to fuck a lawn mower.
Like they,
they hear things,

1628
01:30:19.021 --> 01:30:20.150
they cried towards those things.

1629
01:30:20.151 --> 01:30:22.650
I want to know what the fuck it is and they'll smash you to,

1630
01:30:22.651 --> 01:30:24.900
if you get in the way of them and they're horny,

1631
01:30:25.080 --> 01:30:28.650
they'll just fucking smash you with those horns and stomp you to jazz's.
Yeah,

1632
01:30:28.651 --> 01:30:29.930
they're huge.
I guess I would,

1633
01:30:29.931 --> 01:30:33.390
robotic fuck police force is not going to work in Canada.
When we were up there,

1634
01:30:33.391 --> 01:30:36.240
we found one that had been taken out by a wolf that was pretty eerie.

1635
01:30:36.540 --> 01:30:40.200
A wolf took down a giant ass mouth.
It was a smaller one.
It's a smaller Moose.

1636
01:30:40.201 --> 01:30:43.650
It was a bit like a baby moose,
but even a baby moose,
it's like a deer,

1637
01:30:43.980 --> 01:30:45.150
like a couple hundred pounds.

1638
01:30:45.151 --> 01:30:48.780
I mean it's a big fucking animal and it was just torn apart.
It just,

1639
01:30:48.781 --> 01:30:52.020
most of the meat was picked off the bones and you've got there and it wasn't

1640
01:30:52.021 --> 01:30:55.560
that long ago.
We had gotten there like maybe a day after it happened,

1641
01:30:55.800 --> 01:31:00.270
so it was really eerie to be around this cause you,
there's hair everywhere.

1642
01:31:00.271 --> 01:31:04.050
Like I'll show you a picture of the ground is just completely covered in hair

1643
01:31:04.260 --> 01:31:07.370
and then there's the skeleton and you're looking at this and you're like,
oh,

1644
01:31:07.390 --> 01:31:10.080
match and what that must have been like to see.

1645
01:31:10.590 --> 01:31:15.090
Imagine being there while you see that fucking that wolf picking off every piece

1646
01:31:15.091 --> 01:31:19.480
of flesh and meat.
Yeah,
the first one that comes along.
Yeah.
Look at it that way.

1647
01:31:19.560 --> 01:31:21.660
That's what it looks like on the ground.
Shit.
Yeah.

1648
01:31:21.750 --> 01:31:25.980
That's the meat of the animal all picked off the bread for some reason.

1649
01:31:25.981 --> 01:31:28.950
The hair just hanging out and is it just,
that's even more disturbing?

1650
01:31:28.951 --> 01:31:30.600
I didn't expect that for some reason.

1651
01:31:30.601 --> 01:31:33.570
I figured like they did something with the hair.
No,

1652
01:31:33.571 --> 01:31:36.510
they just leave it on the ground.
They eat a lot of the skin.

1653
01:31:36.690 --> 01:31:40.770
Like the skin's gone.
Like the actual out outer skin like this.

1654
01:31:40.771 --> 01:31:43.530
It's like they spit out the hair coughing it up.
Yeah.

1655
01:31:43.670 --> 01:31:45.960
It's like they spit out the hair in the video of the,

1656
01:31:46.050 --> 01:31:49.500
it's either a cheetah or something.
You've seen a porcupine.

1657
01:31:49.560 --> 01:31:52.620
Have you seen that one where he's taken down the porcupine?
How's he taken out?

1658
01:31:52.680 --> 01:31:56.380
It's,
it's,
I don't know if you can Google it.
It's probably on the show it on.

1659
01:31:56.500 --> 01:32:00.610
Don't know when.
Whenever we show we show nature documentaries

1660
01:32:01.060 --> 01:32:01.871
<v 4>always get pulled off.</v>

1661
01:32:01.871 --> 01:32:04.600
It's a great video cause he stocks it and it's almost like he's going to let it

1662
01:32:04.601 --> 01:32:08.140
pass and he waits in the porcupines doing his thing but its quills or you know,

1663
01:32:08.141 --> 01:32:09.940
it's out.
It's,
it's sprouted.

1664
01:32:09.941 --> 01:32:14.320
It's ready to go and it comes up behind it and just pause under it and gets in

1665
01:32:14.321 --> 01:32:17.380
there and it gets attacked and then it pulls a little needles out,

1666
01:32:17.440 --> 01:32:18.310
licks the wound,

1667
01:32:18.311 --> 01:32:21.610
there's a little blood dripping and then it waits again and porcupines starts

1668
01:32:21.611 --> 01:32:24.640
waddling away and he walks in there and get somebody to fucking jabs at him.

1669
01:32:24.641 --> 01:32:26.010
It's just trying to pull this fucking like,

1670
01:32:26.200 --> 01:32:31.200
and they do this dance six or seven times and each time cleans a little quills

1671
01:32:31.271 --> 01:32:33.130
out,
looks the blood weights,

1672
01:32:33.160 --> 01:32:35.890
goes back in and finally on the last one gets them and you just watch him

1673
01:32:35.891 --> 01:32:37.890
fucking,
once he gets under there and grabs him,

1674
01:32:37.891 --> 01:32:41.320
he just slams him and then fucking tears into him.
It's amazing.

1675
01:32:41.321 --> 01:32:43.540
Just holds them down,
just holds him,
bleeds them out.

1676
01:32:43.541 --> 01:32:45.940
It's like squeezing the last toothpaste out of the tube.

1677
01:32:46.150 --> 01:32:47.260
You just clamping them down.

1678
01:32:47.420 --> 01:32:52.250
<v 2>You mentioned how hard has to be to the point where you're trying to kill one of</v>

1679
01:32:52.251 --> 01:32:55.820
those things,
right?
Porcupine and eat it with your face,
right?

1680
01:32:55.821 --> 01:32:57.020
Like that's how hungry you are.

1681
01:32:57.170 --> 01:33:02.170
You're going to go out of your way to slowly reach under this thing's ball sack

1682
01:33:02.600 --> 01:33:03.433
and gut it,

1683
01:33:03.590 --> 01:33:06.560
<v 4>right?
No one gets going to bleed you out as well,
like now,
right?</v>

1684
01:33:07.180 --> 01:33:11.860
<v 2>The barrier to entry nature,
so ruthless the existence,</v>

1685
01:33:11.950 --> 01:33:16.330
the day to day existence of just trying to kill things with your face to stay

1686
01:33:16.331 --> 01:33:20.650
alive.
You know,
and you know,
eating grass and always be looking around,

1687
01:33:21.090 --> 01:33:24.130
right?
Everywhere you go,
you're fucking,
what the fuck was that sound?

1688
01:33:24.160 --> 01:33:27.730
Always waiting for some giant dog thing,

1689
01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:32.860
whether it's a wolf or a bear or a big cat thing.
These fucking things come on,

1690
01:33:32.950 --> 01:33:36.850
eat you and your family and they just eat you just jack you and start eating you

1691
01:33:36.851 --> 01:33:38.050
alive.
That's your life.

1692
01:33:38.200 --> 01:33:41.080
Your life is like eating grass and looking left and right.
Right.

1693
01:33:41.200 --> 01:33:45.000
And being ready to fucking bolt at any second.
Fuck this right.

1694
01:33:45.310 --> 01:33:49.030
And hope you can run just a little bit faster than Tommy.
That's beautiful,

1695
01:33:49.510 --> 01:33:52.090
beautiful nature.
That's our beautiful nature.
We are.

1696
01:33:52.091 --> 01:33:55.780
Perception of nature is so distorted.
Our perception is,
wow,

1697
01:33:55.781 --> 01:33:59.350
look at the eagles soaring over the beautiful,
like that's a dinosaur.

1698
01:33:59.410 --> 01:34:02.810
He's looking to murder,
right.
He's going to swoop down and you're just lucky.

1699
01:34:02.811 --> 01:34:06.310
You're big enough that he can pick you up.
Because if you,
if you are smaller,

1700
01:34:06.311 --> 01:34:08.950
if you were like rabbits size,
he was fuck your world up.

1701
01:34:08.951 --> 01:34:11.320
That Eagle who'd come down and fucking kill you.

1702
01:34:11.360 --> 01:34:14.660
<v 4>Yeah.
That's not a show of freedom.
He's not flapping his patriotism in your face.</v>

1703
01:34:14.661 --> 01:34:15.620
He's looking for food.

1704
01:34:15.720 --> 01:34:16.650
<v 2>You'd imagine if,</v>

1705
01:34:17.220 --> 01:34:22.220
how crazy would this be if global warming made the earth warmer and because the

1706
01:34:23.581 --> 01:34:27.150
earth got warmer,
eagles got more food and eagles got so big,

1707
01:34:27.151 --> 01:34:31.550
they started praying on Americans.
Would that be the most ironic shit ever?
If,

1708
01:34:31.640 --> 01:34:34.210
if globally,
that's our my fine movie that's coming out next set up,

1709
01:34:34.390 --> 01:34:39.390
set up a path in motion that turned eagles into giant 20 foot human eating

1710
01:34:40.021 --> 01:34:40.800
predators.

1711
01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:43.800
And we had a war with the eagles and it was all because of global warming cause

1712
01:34:43.801 --> 01:34:48.240
they had access to all that frozen land up in Alaska and Canada 24 hours a day.

1713
01:34:48.330 --> 01:34:50.820
Cause that's where they live.
Those fuckers,
they live on the north.

1714
01:34:51.140 --> 01:34:56.010
The north becomes like palm springs,
you know,
but water,
you know like a jungle,

1715
01:34:56.011 --> 01:34:58.310
constant food.
We just have a swarm

1716
01:34:58.310 --> 01:35:02.030
<v 3>of eagles coming down to Seattle.
Fucking people up.
We go to war with the eagles.</v>

1717
01:35:02.360 --> 01:35:04.920
Eagles are the sites of dragons.
Yeah,
that's what I'm saying.

1718
01:35:06.040 --> 01:35:09.050
Then the polar bears were got to deal with them where you have to swim on down

1719
01:35:09.051 --> 01:35:11.700
here I am at change causes a change in animals kind of.

1720
01:35:11.720 --> 01:35:14.650
How do we know that climate change isn't going to cause I'll tell you how would

1721
01:35:14.651 --> 01:35:19.000
you know there's climate change is real.
Climate change is like Obamacare.

1722
01:35:19.010 --> 01:35:22.330
It's not illegal
though.

1723
01:35:22.340 --> 01:35:24.670
The earth is calling on in cycles.
I would,

1724
01:35:24.730 --> 01:35:28.340
you know how cold it is out there today,
ed saw most six g degrees,

1725
01:35:28.970 --> 01:35:33.800
global warming,
global warming.
Now it's hilarious.

1726
01:35:34.260 --> 01:35:37.340
Did it?
Stephen Colbert had a funny line about that.
You know,

1727
01:35:37.370 --> 01:35:42.370
it's like saying like saying there's no global warming because it was cold out.

1728
01:35:42.531 --> 01:35:46.460
Today is like saying there's no global hunger cause I just had lunch,

1729
01:35:48.170 --> 01:35:51.260
right?
There's six.
I can see six taco trucks out this window.

1730
01:35:51.290 --> 01:35:53.450
Clearly people aren't hungry.
Yeah.
I might have paraphrased it.

1731
01:35:53.451 --> 01:35:55.190
I think it was Kobe or I might have paraphrased that,

1732
01:35:55.191 --> 01:35:58.310
but it's pretty close to what it was.
I stumbled through it,
but yeah,

1733
01:35:58.760 --> 01:36:00.500
there's this climate change going on.

1734
01:36:00.660 --> 01:36:04.460
The only question is like how much of it is because of us and it's gotta be some

1735
01:36:04.480 --> 01:36:08.990
of it.
Scalably we're fucking dumping shit into the sky all the time.

1736
01:36:09.170 --> 01:36:12.530
Pretend that that's not doing anything.
That seems a little disingenuous.
I mean,

1737
01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:14.630
why are you pretending?
Well,
and this tree,

1738
01:36:14.631 --> 01:36:18.980
I'm job with the idea that that's the only way we can do things.

1739
01:36:18.981 --> 01:36:23.450
It's so stupid.
What?
Where's,
where's the solar powered factories?
Bitch?

1740
01:36:23.630 --> 01:36:25.330
Where's the solar power clean?
I her,

1741
01:36:25.410 --> 01:36:29.510
every time I read another fucking story about some city getting just clumps of

1742
01:36:29.511 --> 01:36:33.080
their hair falling out in the shower because they're fracking 12 miles away.

1743
01:36:33.290 --> 01:36:37.550
Every time I see a new report or a new study,
I go,
man,
how?
Where's the,

1744
01:36:37.640 --> 01:36:38.870
where's the solar tax breaks?

1745
01:36:38.900 --> 01:36:43.900
Let's just stop feeding that industry and go to the most infinite clean resource

1746
01:36:43.911 --> 01:36:47.810
we have.
Please speaking,
which I'm going to have that dude from,
um,

1747
01:36:48.560 --> 01:36:53.090
from,
uh,
the fracking movie.
Gaslight.
Yeah.
Gas.
Oh yeah.

1748
01:36:53.091 --> 01:36:57.620
I haven't seen Gasland too,
but I saw a gas line one and I was like,
whoa.

1749
01:36:57.650 --> 01:37:02.210
And he's going to come on soon.
He'll be on,
uh,
like to thank me.
He might,

1750
01:37:02.211 --> 01:37:05.630
it might actually be next week we're working on now.
I love that.
But yeah,

1751
01:37:05.631 --> 01:37:06.440
great movie.

1752
01:37:06.440 --> 01:37:09.440
<v 1>And that one also is a controversial movie and uh,</v>

1753
01:37:09.480 --> 01:37:12.540
there's a lot of people that think that a lot of the stuff that he said was,

1754
01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:14.880
was not exactly accurate.

1755
01:37:14.881 --> 01:37:19.140
And some people have said that some of it is bullshit and other people said,
no,

1756
01:37:19.141 --> 01:37:21.960
that's the fracking industry trying to discredit him,
sir.

1757
01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:26.580
So I will give people the opportunity to ask me questions before that.

1758
01:37:26.610 --> 01:37:30.420
Just be me if you have any questions about like,
uh,
the movie or fracking.

1759
01:37:30.421 --> 01:37:33.240
But they made fracking illegal in New York,
New York state.

1760
01:37:33.241 --> 01:37:36.030
They just signed a bill saying out of environmental concerns,

1761
01:37:36.031 --> 01:37:39.900
the governor decided to make a fracking illegal,
which take on it.

1762
01:37:39.990 --> 01:37:43.230
It's like I don't know how many spots they've ruined.
You know,
I don't know.

1763
01:37:43.231 --> 01:37:43.501
I don't,

1764
01:37:43.501 --> 01:37:47.310
I mean the idea of cheap oil and it sounds nice and great and everything,

1765
01:37:47.311 --> 01:37:51.930
but I'm so not into at in 2015 since it's almost there,

1766
01:37:52.150 --> 01:37:56.730
it all we've learned about the consequences of poisoning the environment to just

1767
01:37:56.731 --> 01:38:00.540
wantonly do that without working out the technology to its fullest extent first.

1768
01:38:00.900 --> 01:38:04.560
Cause they're already coming up with new ways of fracking now that are less

1769
01:38:04.561 --> 01:38:05.580
harmful to the environment.

1770
01:38:05.581 --> 01:38:08.730
Like there was just some new release the other day of some new discovery.

1771
01:38:08.731 --> 01:38:12.030
Well okay,
well why didn't we wait until you guys made that cut?
No,

1772
01:38:12.031 --> 01:38:15.210
cause you greedy cunts didn't mind if you polluted a well you didn't mind if you

1773
01:38:15.211 --> 01:38:16.440
fucked up a lake.
You didn't mind.

1774
01:38:16.441 --> 01:38:20.670
A few ruined an ecosystem of a few square miles.
Just a few square miles.

1775
01:38:20.820 --> 01:38:22.350
But that's not,
that's not yours.

1776
01:38:22.351 --> 01:38:25.260
That's the earth's like if you're doing something and you know it's going to

1777
01:38:25.261 --> 01:38:29.850
ruin a lake forever,
like don't do that.
That's fucking stupid.

1778
01:38:29.940 --> 01:38:30.640
Don't do that.

1779
01:38:30.640 --> 01:38:31.900
<v 4>Another layer of that is,
you know,</v>

1780
01:38:31.901 --> 01:38:34.630
when I was down during the BP spill and they were spraying,

1781
01:38:34.690 --> 01:38:38.560
which unprecedented amounts of corrects it all over the Gulf.
Yeah.

1782
01:38:38.561 --> 01:38:43.280
Hundreds of thousands of gallons of,
of a chemical which uh,

1783
01:38:43.300 --> 01:38:47.230
had a proprietary materials list and I'm like,
look,

1784
01:38:47.231 --> 01:38:51.040
if you're spraying thousand hundreds of thousands of gallons of something into a

1785
01:38:51.041 --> 01:38:55.060
water supply,
that is a shared resource.
You don't get to keep the sauce secret.

1786
01:38:55.330 --> 01:38:57.780
This isn't the colonel Sanders recipe here.
Same thing,

1787
01:38:58.510 --> 01:38:59.950
same thing with fucking fracking.

1788
01:38:59.951 --> 01:39:04.210
It's like we don't know specifically what chemical cocktail is going on.

1789
01:39:04.211 --> 01:39:05.650
We can get traces of it,

1790
01:39:05.770 --> 01:39:09.280
but we have no idea what's being pumped into this shared resource and it's not

1791
01:39:09.320 --> 01:39:13.640
<v 1>yours.
Right.
And even if we do know,
if you do know what those chemicals are,</v>

1792
01:39:13.730 --> 01:39:17.270
do we know the longterm consequences of introducing those chemicals to the

1793
01:39:17.271 --> 01:39:21.380
environment now and what are we willing to accept those longterm consequences?

1794
01:39:21.381 --> 01:39:24.410
Maybe you are,
maybe he isn't.
If you guys,
you know,

1795
01:39:24.590 --> 01:39:27.200
we have to be able to figure out what's correct and incorrect and how much is

1796
01:39:27.201 --> 01:39:32.000
based on like exaggeration and how much is based on fear and paranoia versus

1797
01:39:32.001 --> 01:39:32.751
propaganda.

1798
01:39:32.751 --> 01:39:35.750
Like where the fuck is the scientists so we know where are they and then you've

1799
01:39:35.751 --> 01:39:37.400
got to look at the scientist.
Where are you?
Get your money.

1800
01:39:37.610 --> 01:39:40.010
Have you ever gotten any money from a fracking company you get,

1801
01:39:40.011 --> 01:39:43.970
you get paid for the oil company.
You ever done any consulting?
Yeah.

1802
01:39:44.420 --> 01:39:46.460
That cause that's what happened with the financial crisis.

1803
01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:49.160
You ever see the inside job?
Do you ever see that?
Oh Yeah Woo.

1804
01:39:49.370 --> 01:39:50.810
That's a fucking great one,
right?

1805
01:39:50.990 --> 01:39:53.800
You find out that these guys who enact policy then they,

1806
01:39:53.801 --> 01:39:58.801
they then go and get jobs at the company where these professors of economics,

1807
01:39:59.030 --> 01:40:02.210
they propose like certain standards based on their knowledge because their

1808
01:40:02.211 --> 01:40:05.750
economic professors and then they get these fucking juicy jobs when they retire,

1809
01:40:05.960 --> 01:40:07.740
when they stopped teaching and they make better.

1810
01:40:08.530 --> 01:40:12.070
<v 4>It's like doctors getting bonuses for prescribing certain prescription pills.</v>

1811
01:40:12.071 --> 01:40:13.120
I made my quota.
Great.

1812
01:40:13.121 --> 01:40:16.510
Now I'm going to bail out and go work for one of those companies as a
consultant.

1813
01:40:16.780 --> 01:40:21.220
Tip Paper,
Kevin,
bright red.
It's a race,
Joe Rogan.
I'm trying to be in front,

1814
01:40:21.290 --> 01:40:26.030
<v 1>just trying to get paid kid trying to get dead paper.</v>

1815
01:40:26.760 --> 01:40:30.980
I've got to do what I gotta do.
If you want me to propose some Shanky as laws,

1816
01:40:31.010 --> 01:40:35.510
let's do this and that's what's going on.
I mean,

1817
01:40:35.511 --> 01:40:39.920
that's that if people have done that and have profited than it has been shown

1818
01:40:39.921 --> 01:40:44.480
that the deregulation of the markets and all that was disadvantage or was bad

1819
01:40:44.481 --> 01:40:48.670
for the economy.
And if that is the case,
you know,
like,
Whoa,

1820
01:40:48.800 --> 01:40:52.040
how did that happen?
Oh,
you guys did it.
Oh,
and you guys got money from that.

1821
01:40:52.041 --> 01:40:54.100
You've got to get that money.
Yeah,
you stole

1822
01:40:54.100 --> 01:40:57.310
<v 4>that money.
Good luck with that one,
Steven.
Little fucking weasel.</v>

1823
01:40:57.570 --> 01:41:00.460
What do you see today?
That shit policy creating fuck face.

1824
01:41:00.730 --> 01:41:04.990
It's a fucked up policy that,
you know,
the torture memos stuff today.

1825
01:41:05.320 --> 01:41:06.220
The New York Times,

1826
01:41:06.221 --> 01:41:09.390
did you say is your more towards what they're calling the New York Times?
Uh,

1827
01:41:09.580 --> 01:41:12.730
which if you believe that any traditional publication is still going to have

1828
01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:17.660
maybe an ounce of impact on a broad level,
a lot of people point to that.
Um,

1829
01:41:17.710 --> 01:41:20.260
they are calling for basically for,
uh,

1830
01:41:20.410 --> 01:41:25.410
for the Justice Department to look at prosecuting Cheney Bush in name checking

1831
01:41:25.421 --> 01:41:30.220
all of the entire,
the CIA,
the psychologist who came up with the torture stuff.

1832
01:41:30.250 --> 01:41:32.100
You know,
it's like the ones who created the program there.

1833
01:41:32.101 --> 01:41:36.310
They're actively calling for investigations and potentially prosecution.

1834
01:41:36.930 --> 01:41:39.460
Dan,
it's about damn time wow.

1835
01:41:39.850 --> 01:41:44.280
The rectal feeding things like what?
And like someone was trying to justify it.

1836
01:41:44.310 --> 01:41:45.260
Well that's all we were going to do.

1837
01:41:45.290 --> 01:41:47.250
Nutrients and to patients who don't want to eat.

1838
01:41:47.260 --> 01:41:51.070
And I don't think it works like that.
I don't think you shove food up dudes,

1839
01:41:51.090 --> 01:41:55.840
assholes.
They still alive.
Like what is reverse flog raw.

1840
01:41:55.990 --> 01:41:59.290
But what did this whole,
they've got to plunge the oats.
Like is that who we are?

1841
01:41:59.291 --> 01:42:01.320
We're,
we're stuffing food up people's assholes.

1842
01:42:01.390 --> 01:42:05.680
Is that we are who we are when it comes to like the lowest dungeon of secrecy in

1843
01:42:05.681 --> 01:42:08.980
American policy when it comes to maybe not the lowest by the way,

1844
01:42:09.070 --> 01:42:13.260
just one load that we know about.
Yeah.
One one that we found out about it.

1845
01:42:13.261 --> 01:42:16.570
What am I some darker shit they've done.
But you know what man?

1846
01:42:16.720 --> 01:42:17.680
Well there was a real,

1847
01:42:17.770 --> 01:42:21.220
there was a photo on my Facebook while they had the head was an image of a dude

1848
01:42:21.221 --> 01:42:25.500
and mid descent jumping out of one of the towers from nine 11 and the,

1849
01:42:25.501 --> 01:42:28.630
the main text on the top was like,
uh,
you think water,

1850
01:42:28.660 --> 01:42:31.810
you think I'm spraying water in someone's face is torture.

1851
01:42:31.930 --> 01:42:35.140
Just remember what they did to us.
You know,
it's like,
like if you believe in,

1852
01:42:35.170 --> 01:42:39.790
you know,
Eagle screams and seeing that go out there like I had,

1853
01:42:39.820 --> 01:42:40.810
it lured me in,

1854
01:42:40.811 --> 01:42:44.500
I had to like debate this with people who would like and share that and distill

1855
01:42:44.501 --> 01:42:46.480
the argument down to that.
And again,

1856
01:42:46.481 --> 01:42:51.481
it's just like there's no denying that wrong has been done to this country.

1857
01:42:51.611 --> 01:42:54.340
And there's no denying that there are people out there that wake up in their

1858
01:42:54.341 --> 01:42:58.870
first thought out of bed is how can I fuck up America that absolutely exists?

1859
01:42:58.900 --> 01:43:01.060
That's real.
Okay.
Um,

1860
01:43:01.420 --> 01:43:05.310
but how do you think you create more people like that?
You know,
what,

1861
01:43:05.311 --> 01:43:09.100
what process leads to people having that sort of mentality.

1862
01:43:09.220 --> 01:43:11.560
And now there's a certain percentage of people that would say,

1863
01:43:11.561 --> 01:43:15.610
even if we gave a fair trial and found someone guilty and executed them for

1864
01:43:15.611 --> 01:43:16.391
planning for crimes,

1865
01:43:16.391 --> 01:43:19.630
that they would still have family members back home who are super fucking pissed

1866
01:43:19.631 --> 01:43:23.140
that his bed is true.
That there's nothing that you can do to change their minds.

1867
01:43:23.320 --> 01:43:27.880
But when a drone blows up a building and there's 15 innocence killed with that,

1868
01:43:27.881 --> 01:43:31.000
well that's mothers and fathers,
that's neighbors,
that's cousins.

1869
01:43:31.120 --> 01:43:34.630
There's an ancillary fallout.
Where are you?
We're just breeding that mentality.

1870
01:43:34.631 --> 01:43:37.540
You're sowing the seeds of descent,
you know,
your,
your riling people up.

1871
01:43:37.690 --> 01:43:40.360
And when a torture memo like this comes out and we hear about our,
our,

1872
01:43:40.540 --> 01:43:44.020
our moral high ground is completely taken out.
It was taken out at the knees.

1873
01:43:44.290 --> 01:43:45.610
There's very damning report.

1874
01:43:45.611 --> 01:43:49.120
If you believe a percentage of what goes on in there,
you know,

1875
01:43:49.121 --> 01:43:51.080
you want to stop this cycle.
That's not the way to do it.

1876
01:43:51.170 --> 01:43:54.440
It's not the way to get credible information that's been proven and it's only a

1877
01:43:54.441 --> 01:43:55.260
way to create,
yeah.

1878
01:43:55.260 --> 01:43:59.380
<v 2>More hatred and the,
I mean,
they did stuff that was just unimaginable.</v>

1879
01:43:59.381 --> 01:44:02.350
Like they froze to death.
Yeah,
we'll put them there,

1880
01:44:02.380 --> 01:44:06.420
but they're me on a cold floor,
naked handcuffed to a wall froze to death.

1881
01:44:07.050 --> 01:44:11.370
I mean,
people in coffins couldn't breathe.
He died dead.
Couldn't,

1882
01:44:11.371 --> 01:44:16.200
he couldn't maintain his body temperature.
He died.
That's just fucking crazy.

1883
01:44:16.380 --> 01:44:20.340
It's fucking crazy.
I get mean if you want someone dead killed them.
Okay,

1884
01:44:20.370 --> 01:44:22.380
but don't do that.
Right?
Like what are you doing?
You're,

1885
01:44:22.381 --> 01:44:23.430
you're freezing them to death.

1886
01:44:23.490 --> 01:44:27.000
Just if someone is a murderer or someone's done horrible things in these,

1887
01:44:27.001 --> 01:44:30.420
you know,
it's been deemed that he's guilty.
Just execute them.

1888
01:44:30.450 --> 01:44:31.410
Don't fucking do this.

1889
01:44:31.590 --> 01:44:35.340
And if you're doing this just to get information there has gotta be a better
way.

1890
01:44:35.370 --> 01:44:39.270
Did you try ecstasy?
Right?
Did you give him ecstasy first?
Right?
You know what?

1891
01:44:39.310 --> 01:44:43.470
Kindness.
A lot of shit.
I bet you get that guy next up.
Oh,
you can't do that.

1892
01:44:43.471 --> 01:44:46.410
It's illegal.
Okay,
but what did people,
the freezes Dick,

1893
01:44:46.590 --> 01:44:48.690
<v 4>what if you put it in a magic bullet and shove it up his butt?</v>

1894
01:44:48.870 --> 01:44:53.060
Then it's totally illegal into what you feed him.
MTMA roles.

1895
01:44:53.190 --> 01:44:54.300
Fucking a man.

1896
01:44:54.560 --> 01:44:57.570
You know some people I was getting into this discussion and they were like,
well,

1897
01:44:57.571 --> 01:44:59.820
do you know how expensive it is to have a trial?

1898
01:44:59.821 --> 01:45:02.810
Why should we waste money on a terrorist trial and go,

1899
01:45:02.940 --> 01:45:06.660
do you know how fucking expensive to run black site operations with these CIA

1900
01:45:06.661 --> 01:45:10.650
salaries where these dudes that whose chests are filled with medallions and

1901
01:45:10.651 --> 01:45:14.350
striped bars are putting tubes and dude's ass holes and paddling.

1902
01:45:14.351 --> 01:45:17.580
I'm naked down hallways as they put chains around their neck.

1903
01:45:17.581 --> 01:45:19.200
Like that's expensive too.

1904
01:45:19.300 --> 01:45:22.240
<v 2>Yeah.
I would say this is not the way to handle anything.</v>

1905
01:45:22.480 --> 01:45:25.900
This is not the way to do it.
Rectal feeding.
Should never be on your menu.

1906
01:45:25.990 --> 01:45:28.000
That's not noble.
Capitalis chilies.

1907
01:45:28.210 --> 01:45:30.340
Captain America would never directly feed somebody.

1908
01:45:30.490 --> 01:45:33.280
Think about that way when it comes to what we should and shouldn't do and

1909
01:45:33.281 --> 01:45:36.340
dealing with bad guys.
Think about what the fuck captain America would do.
Okay.

1910
01:45:36.450 --> 01:45:39.490
He would never stuff a tube up someone's ass and force feed them a hamburger.

1911
01:45:39.520 --> 01:45:41.590
He wouldn't do that.
So you shouldn't do that.

1912
01:45:41.920 --> 01:45:43.240
If you're going to work for the CIA,

1913
01:45:43.270 --> 01:45:45.520
you should at least uphold the standards of Captain America.

1914
01:45:46.060 --> 01:45:49.850
<v 4>Actually Joe and uh,
issue 17,
Captain America,</v>

1915
01:45:49.851 --> 01:45:52.490
he did give a rectal feeding to doctor Gizmo.

1916
01:45:53.930 --> 01:45:58.580
He slipped the tube up his robe.
Well,
he rectally fed him the truth.

1917
01:46:00.410 --> 01:46:03.770
Put this meal on my shield and just jam it in their freedom.
Right up your ass.

1918
01:46:05.310 --> 01:46:09.480
<v 2>This is the cock of Free Da da Da.
Yeah.</v>

1919
01:46:09.481 --> 01:46:14.130
He actually flew to the courthouse with that dude in the doggy style position.

1920
01:46:14.960 --> 01:46:15.760
Stick in that car,

1921
01:46:15.760 --> 01:46:19.080
answers holding onto the back of his hair as he was flying through the air,

1922
01:46:19.110 --> 01:46:22.680
watching an ad for Coca Cola.
Captain America couldn't even fly.
You know,

1923
01:46:22.681 --> 01:46:24.210
he was just like the first guy on EPO.

1924
01:46:24.350 --> 01:46:27.370
<v 4>Can you jump on a shield and fly?
Is that not a thing?
No.</v>

1925
01:46:27.380 --> 01:46:29.790
We thought it could throw a shield and leap on it and kind of surf the wave.

1926
01:46:29.890 --> 01:46:32.770
<v 2>I'll kind of jump harder than you are higher than you or I,</v>

1927
01:46:32.920 --> 01:46:34.930
but he was in no way a superhero.

1928
01:46:34.960 --> 01:46:37.240
I mean it wasn't even like a bird like bird to be like,

1929
01:46:37.241 --> 01:46:40.810
bitch can't even get off the ground.
He'd be like,
oh,
high jump.

1930
01:46:40.990 --> 01:46:44.800
I'm kept in America.
I'm on not super soldier serum.

1931
01:46:45.580 --> 01:46:48.500
He was the first steroid user.
That's exactly what it was like.

1932
01:46:48.520 --> 01:46:51.870
The United States up with awesome steroids that make you with pride and joy of

1933
01:46:51.871 --> 01:46:53.210
America don't turn turn.

1934
01:46:53.280 --> 01:46:56.190
Why would they just give that to everybody and have all America filled with

1935
01:46:56.191 --> 01:46:59.520
captain America's?
Why rely on this one dude?
You fucking idiots.

1936
01:46:59.640 --> 01:47:03.150
You made some shit that obviously keeps this guy alive since the 1930s he looks

1937
01:47:03.151 --> 01:47:07.230
fantastic.
Give it up,
bitch.
Start passing out the super soldier CRM.

1938
01:47:07.320 --> 01:47:09.960
Why don't you mass producing that?
Why isn't it for say like cigarettes?

1939
01:47:10.110 --> 01:47:12.720
How come the super soldier serums and everywhere.
Oh,

1940
01:47:12.721 --> 01:47:16.080
you like having us week relying on Captain America.

1941
01:47:16.230 --> 01:47:20.190
You fucking shit bags.
Give Up.
Give up the seeker soldiers serum.

1942
01:47:20.360 --> 01:47:22.710
If we all had secret soldiers serum,

1943
01:47:22.800 --> 01:47:25.050
we wouldn't have to worry about isis or al Qaeda.

1944
01:47:25.140 --> 01:47:29.220
We'd all be jacked and we'd have shields and we'd be jumping over buildings and

1945
01:47:29.221 --> 01:47:34.221
we'd have America filled with bad mother fuckers instead of ironic fedora

1946
01:47:34.560 --> 01:47:39.180
wearing douche bags with,
with bird like bone structures.

1947
01:47:39.540 --> 01:47:42.270
No,
there'd be so much roid rage.
It'd be awful.

1948
01:47:42.271 --> 01:47:47.040
It'd be an American [inaudible] on the DMV.

1949
01:47:47.041 --> 01:47:50.190
If everybody was captain America though,
you guys are so wrong.

1950
01:47:50.430 --> 01:47:55.430
All you have to do is just inject morals and ethics into him the same time you

1951
01:47:55.891 --> 01:47:59.250
inject them along with super soldiers here who gets to define the moral code,

1952
01:47:59.251 --> 01:48:00.870
super kindness vote.

1953
01:48:00.890 --> 01:48:03.840
A villain is going to put a back door in that the guardians a piece,

1954
01:48:03.841 --> 01:48:06.510
they're going to put a moral backdoor in it so they can activate all the super

1955
01:48:06.511 --> 01:48:07.344
soldiers.

1956
01:48:07.460 --> 01:48:12.270
He's in the Guardian or isn't the watchman the greatest cartoon or slash comic

1957
01:48:12.271 --> 01:48:17.271
books slash adventure movie ever because it was so like kind of morally

1958
01:48:17.461 --> 01:48:19.260
ambiguous.
Sure.
They were all like,

1959
01:48:19.261 --> 01:48:22.680
everyone's kind of bad and some sort of a weird way.
Like even the good guys,

1960
01:48:22.681 --> 01:48:26.130
we're fucked up.
Everybody's got flaws.
Yeah.
Like in a major way,

1961
01:48:26.160 --> 01:48:27.840
in a way that like,
you know,

1962
01:48:27.841 --> 01:48:31.020
we've seen like Tony Stark likes to drink the team and in the bottle.

1963
01:48:31.021 --> 01:48:33.240
I remember that episode of Iron Man.
I was a little kid.

1964
01:48:33.350 --> 01:48:36.990
I was a big iron man fan and I was reading color comic book and the episode was

1965
01:48:36.991 --> 01:48:41.190
called a demon in the bottle and Tony Stark iron man was having a hard time with

1966
01:48:41.191 --> 01:48:44.430
the whiskey,
the alcohol.
He just couldn't stop drinking.

1967
01:48:44.700 --> 01:48:47.210
They can find Tara in Netsuite,
but he can't find his own Daymond.

1968
01:48:47.211 --> 01:48:51.840
His bottle demon in the bottle was getting a total star.
Amazing.

1969
01:48:51.841 --> 01:48:52.820
I mean that was like the word.

1970
01:48:52.821 --> 01:48:56.070
He wasn't raping anybody or killing and murdering people to watch men murder

1971
01:48:56.071 --> 01:49:00.060
people.
You know,
they'll,
they'll kill people,
stomp heads,
you know,

1972
01:49:00.061 --> 01:49:03.090
like some of the shit that they do is like really dark man.

1973
01:49:03.450 --> 01:49:07.380
What he's showing is that it?
Yeah,
he's looking in the mirror.

1974
01:49:07.381 --> 01:49:11.970
He can't even believe himself.
He looks like the punisher
iron face.

1975
01:49:11.971 --> 01:49:16.770
He's sweating with his suit on underneath his clothes.
They're always,
always,

1976
01:49:16.950 --> 01:49:19.470
always had like a little bit of a torn shirt.
There's something

1977
01:49:21.430 --> 01:49:23.770
that's off afraid would happen to me.

1978
01:49:23.771 --> 01:49:27.420
She was stumbling down a flight of stairs when I was a kid.
Man.

1979
01:49:27.480 --> 01:49:31.710
Comic books were so vacation is his hair dyed cosplay blue.
Did you see that?

1980
01:49:33.300 --> 01:49:37.800
Oh that was always the case.
It's like superman always had blue hair.
Yeah.

1981
01:49:37.830 --> 01:49:39.540
I think it was like a highlight thing.

1982
01:49:39.660 --> 01:49:43.380
Like that's how they decided to go with highlights because it's hard to make

1983
01:49:43.381 --> 01:49:46.860
like a black black hair with like white highlights.
Right?
Right.

1984
01:49:46.861 --> 01:49:48.100
It's like what is the shiny part

1985
01:49:48.100 --> 01:49:50.980
<v 5>look like?
So they decided to go with blue.
Like almost universally.</v>

1986
01:49:51.160 --> 01:49:53.410
It's really like,
occasionally we'll have like brown,

1987
01:49:53.770 --> 01:49:55.450
like like Brown in between the black,

1988
01:49:55.451 --> 01:49:58.420
but a lot of times it's blue and you don't even question it.
Like,
yeah,

1989
01:49:58.660 --> 01:49:59.720
they're just punk rocker.

1990
01:49:59.980 --> 01:50:04.390
You got some weird weird fucking blew their iron man goes to hot topic and gets

1991
01:50:04.391 --> 01:50:07.960
punky colors.
Yeah.
Like we just accept it.
Yeah,
he's got blue hair,

1992
01:50:07.961 --> 01:50:12.420
but he's cool as fuck.
Look,
it's blue hair man.
I love it.
Oh look at him.

1993
01:50:12.730 --> 01:50:16.030
He's so depressed in his chair.
Bumped doesn't look uncomfortable.

1994
01:50:16.031 --> 01:50:19.330
He's wearing a big metal like take off your pants.

1995
01:50:21.040 --> 01:50:24.700
Yeah,
I guess unless you just now he must,

1996
01:50:24.970 --> 01:50:27.160
he must encounter skins or something,
right?
Like,

1997
01:50:27.161 --> 01:50:30.310
I mean you would say for the first week you're iron man and then you just

1998
01:50:30.311 --> 01:50:33.250
develop a tolerance.
We never explained how it looks like metal,

1999
01:50:33.251 --> 01:50:36.310
but Ben's like your muscles as it was that ever explained.

2000
01:50:36.550 --> 01:50:37.383
Like how does that work?

2001
01:50:37.510 --> 01:50:40.660
Because it doesn't have like real joints to be made of unobtainium or something.

2002
01:50:40.690 --> 01:50:43.840
There's some rule we don't know about.
How goofy is that word on a Panini?

2003
01:50:43.841 --> 01:50:47.690
Tanium wasn't that,
isn't there.
And it was movie was Avatar.
Was it advertised?

2004
01:50:47.740 --> 01:50:51.550
Yeah.
Get funding.
I remember Adam [inaudible] was being,
you know,

2005
01:50:51.850 --> 01:50:53.440
get his clot unobtainium like

2006
01:50:55.600 --> 01:50:59.950
that seems like really uncreative.
I haven't possessing them.

2007
01:51:01.450 --> 01:51:06.100
You can't have it.
I'm looking forward to those new movies more than anything.

2008
01:51:06.400 --> 01:51:10.320
James Camera.
It's a bad motherfucker.
Yeah,
there was,
I loved those movies writes.

2009
01:51:10.321 --> 01:51:12.220
It's an article just yesterday,
I think it was,

2010
01:51:12.221 --> 01:51:15.720
it came out that said Avatar gross 9.2 billion.
Dot.

2011
01:51:15.730 --> 01:51:19.390
Whatever the fucking number was like 92 million or what?
900 million worldwide.

2012
01:51:19.570 --> 01:51:24.190
But it didn't leave a cultural impact.
Who said that?
A,

2013
01:51:24.720 --> 01:51:26.410
it's been swimming around like mad.

2014
01:51:26.411 --> 01:51:29.350
This article of like it didn't leave a lasting impact.

2015
01:51:29.380 --> 01:51:32.290
What's where people agreeing with that?
Yeah.
They were saying like,
oh,

2016
01:51:32.291 --> 01:51:34.900
you're right.
Avatar was kind of a failure.
I mean it made a lot of money,

2017
01:51:35.050 --> 01:51:39.070
but it didn't lead to any real in depth discussions about why,

2018
01:51:39.071 --> 01:51:43.240
because the hottest girl ever that broke up with you and you were depressed to

2019
01:51:43.241 --> 01:51:44.740
the point where you don't bring her up anymore.

2020
01:51:44.980 --> 01:51:48.670
That's why two people got avatar depression.
Do you remember that shit?

2021
01:51:48.970 --> 01:51:50.510
People were getting avatar depression.

2022
01:51:50.580 --> 01:51:53.440
Don't tell me it didn't make a cultural impact of fucking idiot.

2023
01:51:53.530 --> 01:51:57.340
Whoever wrote that.
It's ridiculous.
That movie was spectacular.

2024
01:51:57.660 --> 01:52:02.080
It was PSI Phi at its best dances with wolves.
Yes,

2025
01:52:02.081 --> 01:52:06.090
exactly.
It was Pocahontas too.
It was the same movie.
Who Cares?
Right?

2026
01:52:06.160 --> 01:52:09.790
They're all awesome.
It was awesome.
Avatar was the shit.

2027
01:52:09.850 --> 01:52:12.100
If you didn't enjoy that movie,
just as a movie,

2028
01:52:12.101 --> 01:52:16.330
you're a jaded fuck cause you see it in three d in theaters.
It's like people go,

2029
01:52:16.331 --> 01:52:17.920
well I don't like three d.
It's not good.
I'm like,

2030
01:52:17.921 --> 01:52:22.921
you can't judge Avatar by the upconverted bullshit you see at the local hardwood

2031
01:52:24.011 --> 01:52:28.890
chair.
Fucking multip.
You gotta go gotta go Imax Three d?
Yes.

2032
01:52:28.950 --> 01:52:29.051
Oh,

2033
01:52:29.051 --> 01:52:31.660
I wouldn't have loved that movie in nearly as much as if it were in imax three d

2034
01:52:31.690 --> 01:52:33.880
I gotta be honest.
I loved it,
but I needed that.

2035
01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:39.000
I needed some fucking sativa and Imax and it's 12.1 sound system and fucking

2036
01:52:39.670 --> 01:52:43.300
Avatar titties.
Right.
Depth in my eyeballs.
That was amazing.

2037
01:52:43.330 --> 01:52:46.100
Here's what people don't,
oh,
I can't tell you what you do

2038
01:52:46.100 --> 01:52:49.430
<v 3>and don't get,
but this is what I don't get about people's reaction to it.</v>

2039
01:52:49.431 --> 01:52:54.080
The same people would probably be comic book fans.
You know,

2040
01:52:54.081 --> 01:52:58.160
there's a lot of people that are like snobs over a movie like that,

2041
01:52:58.161 --> 01:53:03.080
but may actually be into like other genres while there except plot holes like

2042
01:53:03.081 --> 01:53:07.700
that.
Of course.
But what Avatar is,
is a comic book movie.
It's a comic book movie.

2043
01:53:07.701 --> 01:53:11.030
It's,
it's almost cartoonish in the fact that,
you know,

2044
01:53:11.031 --> 01:53:13.100
everything's going to work out in the end.
You know,

2045
01:53:13.101 --> 01:53:16.140
you know the good guys are going to get through and the basket that beat
Goliath,

2046
01:53:16.220 --> 01:53:19.370
you got a bad marine.
He's in his fucking bad outfit.

2047
01:53:19.371 --> 01:53:22.610
Like you're going to kick that guy's ass.
The whole thing is like,

2048
01:53:22.670 --> 01:53:26.660
but it's a visual masterpiece.
I mean it's,

2049
01:53:26.661 --> 01:53:30.910
you're watching this world play out this like,
I mean it's,

2050
01:53:30.920 --> 01:53:35.300
it's a little homogenized.
It's a little pasteurize and it's a little mainstream.

2051
01:53:35.390 --> 01:53:39.500
Guilty as charged.
It certainly is.
But so what,

2052
01:53:39.650 --> 01:53:40.580
just enjoy it.

2053
01:53:40.610 --> 01:53:45.610
It's amazing trees with the fiber optics and the dragons and grade fucking,

2054
01:53:46.220 --> 01:53:49.820
oh my God,
it's incredible to hair doc dude.
It's incredible.

2055
01:53:50.040 --> 01:53:51.470
You mentioned that like the the,

2056
01:53:51.530 --> 01:53:54.290
these guys love comic books and get their picking this apart because there's

2057
01:53:54.320 --> 01:53:59.320
subsets of nerds who will go out of their way to excuse or explain logic flaws

2058
01:54:01.221 --> 01:54:04.610
and star wars or star Trek,
anything star related.
They were Lord of the rings.

2059
01:54:04.760 --> 01:54:09.020
They will cook up formulas that explain the science behind a wizard staff.

2060
01:54:09.200 --> 01:54:12.110
They will do everything they can to defend a franchise they love,

2061
01:54:12.290 --> 01:54:16.340
but if they will apply that exact same violent hatred,

2062
01:54:16.341 --> 01:54:19.430
white hatred to a new property that no,

2063
01:54:19.431 --> 01:54:23.330
there's unobtainium stupid and then they will just tear it down with that same

2064
01:54:23.331 --> 01:54:28.160
laser focus.
But I'd loved about Avatar was that a bunch of,
not just,

2065
01:54:28.161 --> 01:54:31.340
I loved watching it.
It was fun.
I thought it was just a fun movie,

2066
01:54:31.580 --> 01:54:36.230
but what I loved is watching all these people with this quote unquote avatar

2067
01:54:36.231 --> 01:54:39.530
depression talking about it.
There was all these people that were saying like,

2068
01:54:39.980 --> 01:54:44.980
that movie made me realize how unrewarding my regular everyday life is and how

2069
01:54:46.400 --> 01:54:49.550
unspiritual unconnected I am too,

2070
01:54:49.620 --> 01:54:53.330
to the energy of the universe and life and like those,
those,
those beings,

2071
01:54:53.331 --> 01:54:57.830
those Navi,
they weren't free.
You know,
they lived like flying,
you know,

2072
01:54:57.831 --> 01:55:01.310
nomads and shooting bows and arrows and shit.
And for whatever reason,

2073
01:55:01.311 --> 01:55:04.940
it's just like so much more appealing than the shitbag life you have getting

2074
01:55:04.941 --> 01:55:07.100
stuck in traffic driving to your cubicle,

2075
01:55:07.130 --> 01:55:10.670
right where you constantly feel out of balance and out of peace with your

2076
01:55:10.671 --> 01:55:15.470
environment to most men live lives of silent desperation.
That was,

2077
01:55:15.530 --> 01:55:19.010
was it Ralph Waldo Emerson?
Who the fuck said that thorough?

2078
01:55:19.040 --> 01:55:21.950
I think Thoreau said that.
It's one of my favorite all time quotes.

2079
01:55:22.730 --> 01:55:26.900
Most men live lives of silent desperation,
you know,

2080
01:55:26.930 --> 01:55:31.400
and you see that avatar movie.
God,
I want to fly a fucking dragon.

2081
01:55:31.880 --> 01:55:34.310
I just want to live in a hammock and a tree.

2082
01:55:34.790 --> 01:55:39.790
Just live off the land and justly avoid all the monsters and shoot them down as

2083
01:55:41.271 --> 01:55:43.780
I leap over them.
And just cliff,
if

2084
01:55:43.980 --> 01:55:48.930
<v 2>you're alive and exciting times instead of this fucking traffic and sneezing and</v>

2085
01:55:49.200 --> 01:55:52.740
Bullshit and Oh,
I got laid off,
great.
I think I'll shoot myself.
You know,

2086
01:55:52.741 --> 01:55:57.150
I mean this is the world that people are trapped in,
in a,
in a lot of ways.

2087
01:55:57.151 --> 01:56:01.230
And so to say that that movie was culturally significant or it didn't have a

2088
01:56:01.231 --> 01:56:06.090
cultural impact,
it might not have for you are okay because first of all,

2089
01:56:06.091 --> 01:56:09.420
it shouldn't have,
it should have just been an enjoyable film,

2090
01:56:09.450 --> 01:56:12.420
which I thought it was,
but you can't deny all this.

2091
01:56:12.480 --> 01:56:16.110
They came up with a term for how people reacted,

2092
01:56:16.111 --> 01:56:19.050
like the withdrawal that they had from that movie.
I mean,

2093
01:56:19.080 --> 01:56:21.330
that's how fucking powerful impact,

2094
01:56:21.750 --> 01:56:26.040
just because it didn't get you just because you're a little fucking movie snob

2095
01:56:26.400 --> 01:56:30.670
fedora wearing movies knob.
Cause I said,
you know what I saw,
I saw a Fox catcher,

2096
01:56:31.500 --> 01:56:35.730
um,
I've heard about that is it's a lot of ways,

2097
01:56:35.731 --> 01:56:39.810
a very good movie and a lot of ways,
a very good movie.
Spoiler alert.

2098
01:56:40.110 --> 01:56:43.980
Steve Carell knocks it out of the fucking park.
Um,

2099
01:56:44.400 --> 01:56:48.330
what is his name?
The a beautiful,
handsome man.
I of course,
you know his name.

2100
01:56:48.331 --> 01:56:52.520
What's his name?
Channing Tatum.
You know,
all the celebrity gossip.

2101
01:56:52.530 --> 01:56:54.870
They fuck Channing Tatum.

2102
01:56:57.150 --> 01:57:01.710
He knocks it out of the park.
Mark refollow wears Nike,
Mark Rufallo who plays,

2103
01:57:01.711 --> 01:57:04.530
uh,
the hulk in the Avengers movie.

2104
01:57:04.680 --> 01:57:07.180
He plays the brother David Schultz,

2105
01:57:08.020 --> 01:57:09.780
and it's all based on a true story,

2106
01:57:09.850 --> 01:57:14.490
a story that I'm a very aware of because mark Schultes actually fought in the

2107
01:57:14.491 --> 01:57:17.970
UFC.
Now here's the,
I mean the movie's a very good in some ways,

2108
01:57:17.971 --> 01:57:21.270
but here's the issue that I had with it.
Spoiler alert,
stop.

2109
01:57:21.271 --> 01:57:22.470
Now if you don't want to go further,

2110
01:57:22.860 --> 01:57:27.600
I want to say they fucked with the timeline in the 1980s,

2111
01:57:27.630 --> 01:57:32.610
they showed the UFC on TV in 1988 or they show them watching the UFC,

2112
01:57:32.611 --> 01:57:36.030
talking about it like the UFC wasn't even invented until 1993.

2113
01:57:36.180 --> 01:57:40.680
So why would you make a true story about real people in a really fucked up

2114
01:57:40.710 --> 01:57:45.710
actual real life murder that it's incredibly creepy movie and a lot of ways it's

2115
01:57:46.021 --> 01:57:47.460
really well done.
But,

2116
01:57:47.550 --> 01:57:51.750
and then lie about the timeline by five years.

2117
01:57:52.170 --> 01:57:56.700
Other than being an acronystic,
does it play as a central point in the plot?

2118
01:57:56.760 --> 01:57:59.100
Yes.
Okay.
Yes.
Because at the end of it,

2119
01:57:59.101 --> 01:58:01.740
he winds up being a mixed martial arts fighter,
which is true.

2120
01:58:01.890 --> 01:58:05.910
But what's not true is in the movie they put him in against some random Russian

2121
01:58:05.911 --> 01:58:09.080
guy.
I think they'd like a white guy.
He didn't fight a white guy.

2122
01:58:09.081 --> 01:58:12.420
I fought a black guy,
fought a guy named big dairy daddy Goodrich and big daddy.

2123
01:58:12.421 --> 01:58:15.780
Good.
Richard is the only MMA fight that Mark Schultz ever had.

2124
01:58:15.930 --> 01:58:18.240
So to have the end of the movie having him about the fight,

2125
01:58:18.241 --> 01:58:20.580
a white guy like you guys just invented some shit.

2126
01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:22.380
Like why did you go with a white guy?

2127
01:58:22.381 --> 01:58:26.430
And then when they're watching the fight in 1988 which was actually taking place

2128
01:58:26.431 --> 01:58:29.700
in 1993 it was big daddy,
good rich fighting.
Paul Herrera.
So like,

2129
01:58:29.701 --> 01:58:32.370
I don't know what the fuck they were doing when they were doing that.

2130
01:58:32.371 --> 01:58:37.371
Like that is not just unnecessary but jarring and insulting in a way to anybody

2131
01:58:37.741 --> 01:58:38.970
that's in mixed martial arts fan.

2132
01:58:38.971 --> 01:58:42.010
Because if you're like me and do like a historian mixed martial arts

2133
01:58:42.010 --> 01:58:44.050
<v 1>and you watched that,
you go,
why are you doing that?</v>

2134
01:58:44.200 --> 01:58:47.800
Like you're dealing with a real Olympic gold medalists who was really involved

2135
01:58:47.801 --> 01:58:51.610
in a real life scenario.
We had a real live,
crazy super rich guy.

2136
01:58:51.611 --> 01:58:54.520
Shoot his brother.
Like all those things are real.
It's a nutty story.

2137
01:58:54.620 --> 01:58:58.210
W W when you add in a bunch of shit that I know is not real,

2138
01:58:58.360 --> 01:59:00.220
it makes me question all the other,
everything else,

2139
01:59:00.221 --> 01:59:03.370
and I don't want to have to do research on this guy's entire life and find out

2140
01:59:03.371 --> 01:59:06.400
how much of what you put in there.
It was just total bullshit.

2141
01:59:06.850 --> 01:59:08.020
But when they do that,
man,

2142
01:59:08.021 --> 01:59:12.700
when they just fuck with reality and put unnecessarily,

2143
01:59:12.910 --> 01:59:17.650
they changed the timeline of these guys watching the UFC by five fucking years.

2144
01:59:17.890 --> 01:59:22.600
That's so irresponsible.
It's just dumb.
It was a big part of this guy's life.

2145
01:59:22.960 --> 01:59:25.780
Mark Schultz would have been the fucking UFC heavyweight champion of the world.

2146
01:59:25.930 --> 01:59:27.520
He was a phenomenal wrestler.

2147
01:59:27.700 --> 01:59:31.420
He was one of a handful of Olympic gold medalist who fought in MMA,

2148
01:59:31.421 --> 01:59:35.080
but he only fought once and dominated this guy who was a really tough guy and

2149
01:59:35.081 --> 01:59:37.240
everybody was wondering what could have happened with him that he went on to

2150
01:59:37.241 --> 01:59:37.660
coach.

2151
01:59:37.660 --> 01:59:40.420
He was coaching at Brigham Young University and they wouldn't let them fight in

2152
01:59:40.421 --> 01:59:43.210
MMA.
They said,
if you fought in the UFC,
we're gonna know your contract.

2153
01:59:43.211 --> 01:59:45.340
There was no money in the UFC back then.
So he backed away.

2154
01:59:45.490 --> 01:59:46.900
He could have been heavyweight champion the world.

2155
01:59:46.901 --> 01:59:51.190
I mean he was just a fucking animal stud wrestler.
Ridiculously strong.

2156
01:59:51.880 --> 01:59:56.140
And so when you watch stuff like that in this movie about this guy's life,

2157
01:59:56.170 --> 01:59:58.900
it makes me question the whole movie.
I'm like,
what are you doing?

2158
01:59:58.901 --> 02:00:01.300
Like why are you changing reality?
Why you?

2159
02:00:01.301 --> 02:00:05.140
Why you putting in some stuff like that?
Like he fought a white guy,

2160
02:00:05.170 --> 02:00:07.840
he didn't fight.
He fought one guy ever.
His whole fucking life.

2161
02:00:08.230 --> 02:00:09.790
It's already had a hundred MMA fights.

2162
02:00:09.791 --> 02:00:11.920
You're creating a fictional opponent to move on.

2163
02:00:11.940 --> 02:00:14.910
<v 4>Is that like the line along the intern that was doing the research for that</v>

2164
02:00:14.911 --> 02:00:16.380
scene in the script,
you know,

2165
02:00:16.381 --> 02:00:20.040
had to cull through 500 matches and pick one to represent his career.
Yeah.

2166
02:00:20.041 --> 02:00:22.950
And there was one,
it wasn't even in the UFC in the movie.

2167
02:00:23.010 --> 02:00:26.900
Like the movie didn't show the UFC,
it didn't show the octagon and didn't,

2168
02:00:26.901 --> 02:00:28.950
I mean it was like a cage but it wasn't the UFC.

2169
02:00:28.951 --> 02:00:33.720
It was like generic fight promotion.
It was a UFC though in real life.

2170
02:00:33.750 --> 02:00:36.600
Yeah.
That and it was weird cause they didn't even pick like an old,

2171
02:00:36.660 --> 02:00:40.790
the oldest one,
they picked one from 1994 so it wasn't even 1993 UFC.

2172
02:00:40.791 --> 02:00:43.830
It was at night.
The one that he was watching TV.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2173
02:00:43.831 --> 02:00:47.010
When he fought Paul Herrera,
when the big daddy Goodrich far Paul Herrera.

2174
02:00:47.011 --> 02:00:50.190
It's so stupid.
So they fucked with the timeline for no reason.

2175
02:00:50.220 --> 02:00:53.250
It's interesting cause like that's a piece of knowledge that the average viewer

2176
02:00:53.251 --> 02:00:56.850
is not going to have most likely.
But it makes you wonder why they come.

2177
02:00:56.910 --> 02:00:58.650
I'm sure they compressed it for time,
right?

2178
02:00:58.651 --> 02:01:01.530
They wanted to plant the seed of why he's going to watch this thing and become

2179
02:01:01.531 --> 02:01:04.170
this thing and okay.
But to your point,

2180
02:01:04.171 --> 02:01:07.230
it does a huge disservice if it makes you question the legitimacy,

2181
02:01:07.320 --> 02:01:10.060
legitimacy or the accuracy of everything else in the film.
In

2182
02:01:10.060 --> 02:01:13.930
<v 1>my opinion,
there was no reason for them to put it in the UFC at all.</v>

2183
02:01:13.931 --> 02:01:17.500
Like there's no reason for them to show that part of his life.

2184
02:01:17.610 --> 02:01:20.740
And it was only one fight that he had.
What was really crazy,

2185
02:01:20.741 --> 02:01:23.470
it was the fact this guy was an Olympic gold medalist who,
you know,

2186
02:01:23.471 --> 02:01:28.471
it shows you how difficult it is for these guys to make money rather training

2187
02:01:28.751 --> 02:01:30.800
and how difficult it is to come up with sponsorship.

2188
02:01:30.801 --> 02:01:32.160
So when this really rich guy,

2189
02:01:32.230 --> 02:01:36.790
John Dupont came along and wanting to fund the Olympic team and Olympic

2190
02:01:36.791 --> 02:01:39.370
wrestling team,
they had a deal with this insane,

2191
02:01:39.380 --> 02:01:44.270
crazy guy that was like pretending to be a wrestler that was sort of financing

2192
02:01:44.300 --> 02:01:47.450
this.
Steve Carell knocks it out of the park,
man.

2193
02:01:47.490 --> 02:01:49.230
<v 5>I heard people don't even realize it's him.</v>

2194
02:01:49.400 --> 02:01:52.470
They watched the movie and they leave.
Not even realizing he's so

2195
02:01:52.480 --> 02:01:57.050
<v 1>fucking creepy,
man.
He's so creepy.
Do you see bird man?
Um,</v>

2196
02:01:57.520 --> 02:01:59.770
no,
I did not see Birdman.
Yeah,
put that on the,

2197
02:01:59.800 --> 02:02:04.800
put that on the instant instant watch mark in the UFC for months after Dave was

2198
02:02:05.471 --> 02:02:09.850
murdered.
Holy Shit.
That's incredible.

2199
02:02:10.870 --> 02:02:14.920
He finally UFC four months after his brother was murdered.

2200
02:02:15.280 --> 02:02:19.230
That's justice.
Unbelievable.
Wow.
And that was that.

2201
02:02:19.231 --> 02:02:21.760
That all happened in 1996.
Wow.
Fuck.

2202
02:02:22.240 --> 02:02:26.350
But I just don't understand why they make a movie about a real live situation

2203
02:02:26.351 --> 02:02:31.351
that is insanely compelling and add some shit and fuck with timelines and I

2204
02:02:31.850 --> 02:02:35.560
think maybe UFC got paid are paid them to do.

2205
02:02:35.561 --> 02:02:38.710
That doesn't make any sense.
That doesn't make any sense.

2206
02:02:38.920 --> 02:02:41.710
That doesn't make any sense because they didn't have the UFC at the end.

2207
02:02:41.830 --> 02:02:43.940
It wasn't,
UFC didn't show the arc.

2208
02:02:43.970 --> 02:02:47.350
I mean I think it was even round if I might be wrong about that.

2209
02:02:47.500 --> 02:02:49.990
But I remember looking at it like that's the wrong sized cage.

2210
02:02:50.140 --> 02:02:52.120
I remember looking at the scenario like this is not,

2211
02:02:52.190 --> 02:02:55.870
is not like what it looked like when Mark Schultz stepped in the octagon.
He,

2212
02:02:56.020 --> 02:02:59.890
he fought in the UFC just before I started working there.

2213
02:03:00.190 --> 02:03:04.720
I think he fought like,
oh I want to say UFC nine,

2214
02:03:04.721 --> 02:03:07.300
I think it is.
And I came along and UFC 12,

2215
02:03:07.630 --> 02:03:10.590
so it was just right before I got there.
They weren't,
you know,

2216
02:03:10.660 --> 02:03:13.900
the way they had this setup,
it was,
it was incorrect.

2217
02:03:13.901 --> 02:03:16.750
It was smaller than it really is.
There's a lot of things were weird about it,

2218
02:03:16.751 --> 02:03:20.830
but the weirdest things that he was fighting a white guy.
But if I one guy ever,

2219
02:03:21.160 --> 02:03:21.911
so at the end of the movie,

2220
02:03:21.911 --> 02:03:25.630
why making a white guy like what the fuck are you doing?
And not only that,

2221
02:03:25.660 --> 02:03:29.350
they also didn't account for the fact that you're talking about like a six year

2222
02:03:29.351 --> 02:03:33.970
time gap between them watching it in 1988 the murder and him,
uh,

2223
02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:36.460
getting,
starting fighting in the UFC,

2224
02:03:36.700 --> 02:03:40.180
like you just created this time dilemma that doesn't make any sense.

2225
02:03:40.181 --> 02:03:42.820
Like how did Mark Schultz age six years like that?

2226
02:03:42.850 --> 02:03:47.080
All of a sudden he's in the UFC cause you can't deny when his debut is,

2227
02:03:47.081 --> 02:03:49.510
you're going to deny the timeline of his actual fight.

2228
02:03:49.960 --> 02:03:52.750
Well that fight was in 1996.
This whole thing doesn't make any sense.

2229
02:03:52.751 --> 02:03:53.584
This is stupid.

2230
02:03:53.980 --> 02:03:57.010
<v 5>Well that's what does it inherently change the story?
Oh</v>

2231
02:03:57.370 --> 02:04:01.840
<v 1>it stinks of producer Greece,
right?
You know that someone,</v>

2232
02:04:01.841 --> 02:04:05.290
some executive type character wanting to get their greasy pause on,

2233
02:04:05.320 --> 02:04:10.210
let's have them sitting around watching the UFC or some screenwriter that

2234
02:04:10.211 --> 02:04:12.070
doesn't respect the history of the sport.

2235
02:04:12.250 --> 02:04:14.380
Like you do imagine that they did that about baseball.

2236
02:04:14.470 --> 02:04:17.140
If they made a movie that was a Babe Ruth,

2237
02:04:17.141 --> 02:04:21.220
but the timeline was five years off to when Babe Ruth was actually playing

2238
02:04:21.221 --> 02:04:23.790
baseball.
People would go fucking crazy.
They did

2239
02:04:24.060 --> 02:04:27.920
<v 5>yo fuck get red dodge rose Denton thought play Doh.</v>

2240
02:04:28.090 --> 02:04:31.450
Five got fucking piece of shit movie.

2241
02:04:31.740 --> 02:04:36.240
You don't fucking know shit about baseball for a bunch of Chuck Riding Hollywood

2242
02:04:36.330 --> 02:04:38.340
got soccer that are fucking

2243
02:04:38.340 --> 02:04:42.960
<v 2>with the American pastime.
But if you have it about the UFC,</v>

2244
02:04:42.961 --> 02:04:46.260
like nobody gives a shit.
Like,
so,
uh,
it's five years off with six years off,

2245
02:04:46.261 --> 02:04:49.820
whatever it is.
It's off.
You're off.
You don't have to,
it doesn't have to be off,

2246
02:04:49.840 --> 02:04:53.580
but should I say the movie?
It's a good move.
Alright.
Fuck yeah,
it's a good movie.

2247
02:04:53.581 --> 02:04:56.700
Channing Tatum knocks out of the park.
He looks like a real wrestler too.

2248
02:04:56.701 --> 02:04:58.170
Like when he moves,
he moves good.

2249
02:04:58.560 --> 02:05:02.850
Like the wrestling scenes are not offensive at all.
They're good.
You know,

2250
02:05:03.180 --> 02:05:07.320
I mean there's certain like you watch like certain martial arts scenes in movies

2251
02:05:07.321 --> 02:05:10.230
and you're like,
get the fuck out of here.
Like this is so weak.

2252
02:05:10.530 --> 02:05:11.730
The kicks look fake.

2253
02:05:12.120 --> 02:05:14.520
You can tell they're not really hitting each other then not really punching each

2254
02:05:14.521 --> 02:05:16.530
other full blast.
It's just hard to fake.

2255
02:05:16.800 --> 02:05:20.820
But they must've done a lot of really hard wrestling training because he moves

2256
02:05:20.821 --> 02:05:25.530
real good.
Like he hits,
he hits takedowns and positions.
He hits a very smooth.

2257
02:05:25.830 --> 02:05:29.130
So either he wrestled at one point in his career and his life rather,

2258
02:05:29.131 --> 02:05:34.131
and he's like John from that Bri relearning those skills or he learned them for

2259
02:05:34.441 --> 02:05:36.720
the movie.
But either way,
it's totally possible.

2260
02:05:36.810 --> 02:05:39.480
It's never going to look 100% legit because it's a planned outcome.

2261
02:05:39.660 --> 02:05:41.820
It's like it's planned that this guy's going to take this guy down.

2262
02:05:41.821 --> 02:05:44.320
So it always has this sort of stink about it.

2263
02:05:44.321 --> 02:05:47.450
And whenever there's any sort of choreographed motions going on in a move,

2264
02:05:47.451 --> 02:05:50.370
we could do a movie about pride,
but not about UFC then.
Well,

2265
02:05:50.371 --> 02:05:53.790
even looser trying to was choreographed.
Yeah.

2266
02:05:54.090 --> 02:05:57.120
I'm sure there's been some choreographed fights in the UFC in the early days.

2267
02:05:57.180 --> 02:05:58.860
There were some,
there were some fights.
Yeah.

2268
02:05:59.100 --> 02:06:01.830
There was a Vito Belfort fight that a lot of people thought was at work.
Oh,

2269
02:06:01.831 --> 02:06:05.310
actually that was a,
that was actually pride.
He fought the ghetto man,

2270
02:06:05.311 --> 02:06:06.121
Joe Charles,

2271
02:06:06.121 --> 02:06:09.990
and got him at a really quick arm bar and a lot of people were shocked because

2272
02:06:09.991 --> 02:06:12.720
they knew that Joe Charles train with v Tour,
you know?

2273
02:06:12.721 --> 02:06:16.620
And a lot of people are like,
hmm,
I mean maybe v toward decided not to punch him.

2274
02:06:16.860 --> 02:06:21.450
You,
maybe they made a sort of an agreement because like back then Vito was the

2275
02:06:21.470 --> 02:06:23.520
motherfucker,
you know,
he was,

2276
02:06:23.640 --> 02:06:26.970
he was really good and unusually good with his standup.
I mean,

2277
02:06:26.971 --> 02:06:27.810
he's still really good.

2278
02:06:27.820 --> 02:06:30.990
He's challenging for the title next month or in February rather than,

2279
02:06:31.290 --> 02:06:33.600
so he's already,
I mean,
he's at the top of the food chain right now,

2280
02:06:33.601 --> 02:06:34.950
but back then,
see,

2281
02:06:34.951 --> 02:06:38.250
right now there's a lot of good strikers as a lot of guys who have a lot of good

2282
02:06:38.251 --> 02:06:40.740
hand techniques and you know,
good stand up guys.

2283
02:06:40.740 --> 02:06:43.980
But back then there was only a handful of them and Vito was at the top of that

2284
02:06:43.981 --> 02:06:45.620
heap.
Like when [inaudible] came around,

2285
02:06:45.630 --> 02:06:48.810
he was 19 nobody had ever seen anybody with hand speed like his,

2286
02:06:49.050 --> 02:06:51.450
when he fought Treg telling me that was his first fight in the UFC.

2287
02:06:51.840 --> 02:06:54.420
He stepped forward and everybody knew he's a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belt,

2288
02:06:54.421 --> 02:06:57.370
but he just unloads with these punches.
Like they made me wait,
wait,
wait,

2289
02:06:58.410 --> 02:07:02.340
beautiful fucking lightening fast punches.
And everybody's like,
what the fuck?

2290
02:07:02.880 --> 02:07:05.670
But he fought Joe.
Charles just won't take them down.
Armbar,
you know,

2291
02:07:05.671 --> 02:07:06.620
and everybody's like,
hmm.

2292
02:07:06.660 --> 02:07:09.090
And you think because they trained together there was like,
hey man,

2293
02:07:09.091 --> 02:07:13.320
don't bust up my face too much if you're going to beat me,
do it.
Or,

2294
02:07:13.380 --> 02:07:17.770
or it could be that Joe Charles knew what the fuck was going to go down and say,

2295
02:07:17.771 --> 02:07:22.140
listen,
I know I can't be you,
so let's just,
you know,
even this arm,

2296
02:07:22.170 --> 02:07:26.970
this is my good arm.
Bend it too much.
We'll tap you don't me brother.

2297
02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:30.660
I will.
And that's the thing,
like a guy like [inaudible] tour is so nice.

2298
02:07:30.780 --> 02:07:33.450
Like a lot of people think that that's how he lost to John Jones.

2299
02:07:33.451 --> 02:07:38.200
He caught John Jones up perfect arm bar and he popped his elbow like a bunch of

2300
02:07:38.201 --> 02:07:38.510
times,

2301
02:07:38.510 --> 02:07:42.970
but John never tapped and veto even said that he relaxed his grip on it because

2302
02:07:42.971 --> 02:07:46.210
he felt bad that he was breaking this guy's arm.
Right.
You know,

2303
02:07:46.211 --> 02:07:50.410
like I'm in a sense that he was taken aback and he said that he should've held

2304
02:07:50.411 --> 02:07:54.220
onto it.
I believe that's what he said.
I'm sorry.
I apologize if I was incorrect,

2305
02:07:54.221 --> 02:07:57.310
but I was pretty sure.
And one of the interviews,
he's a very nice guy,

2306
02:07:57.880 --> 02:08:01.360
but you know,
with striking,
you either hit a guy,
you don't,
you know,

2307
02:08:01.361 --> 02:08:05.470
it's not a matter of holding a technique and he,
he,
he bugging eds people.

2308
02:08:06.040 --> 02:08:08.440
That's going to be a really interesting fight.
Who was he fighting?

2309
02:08:08.500 --> 02:08:12.370
He's fighting Chris Weidman for the middle weight title.
But the point is,
anyway,

2310
02:08:12.580 --> 02:08:14.470
back to Fox catcher.
Really good movie.

2311
02:08:14.830 --> 02:08:17.710
Really good movie that I'm Channing Tatum.

2312
02:08:17.711 --> 02:08:20.030
Guy Kills it even looks like mark shoulds.

2313
02:08:20.050 --> 02:08:23.800
Like he did something with his jaw or judges jaw forward while he's talking all

2314
02:08:23.801 --> 02:08:26.910
the time.
So he actually looks like the guy in a lot of ways,
you know,

2315
02:08:26.920 --> 02:08:28.660
he looks different than it usually looks.

2316
02:08:28.840 --> 02:08:31.570
And his wrestling was super respectable and Mark Ruffalo was awesome.

2317
02:08:31.720 --> 02:08:34.380
They both walked like wrestlers.
They,
they did.
Uh,

2318
02:08:34.660 --> 02:08:36.550
they really did a really good job and it's fine because like,

2319
02:08:36.640 --> 02:08:39.490
especially like Channing Tatum,
he does a lot of funny movies,
you know,

2320
02:08:39.491 --> 02:08:40.900
don't do a lot of silly movies.

2321
02:08:41.020 --> 02:08:45.010
So it's weird to see him play this like super intense,
you know,
uh,

2322
02:08:45.040 --> 02:08:49.900
really dark kind of character in this movie.
And fucking Tarell's.

2323
02:08:49.901 --> 02:08:51.670
Amazing man.
You don't even believe it's him.

2324
02:08:51.720 --> 02:08:54.180
<v 4>That's what I,
every review that I've read is like,
oh,</v>

2325
02:08:54.181 --> 02:08:56.730
I had to wait for the credits to find out who that amazing actor was.

2326
02:08:57.210 --> 02:08:58.043
Sneak up on them,

2327
02:08:58.660 --> 02:09:03.290
<v 2>changed his face and gave him this weird nose.
It's fucking good,
dude.</v>

2328
02:09:03.310 --> 02:09:07.370
You were catching it.
You really buy it.
He's so good.
You really buy that.

2329
02:09:07.371 --> 02:09:08.160
He's just crazy.

2330
02:09:08.160 --> 02:09:10.950
<v 4>Someone was saying I'm Ashton Kutcher is doing,</v>

2331
02:09:11.070 --> 02:09:13.270
I know that sounds like a setup to a joke,
but it's,
yeah,

2332
02:09:13.290 --> 02:09:16.410
he's doing Jujitsu and that he's done in the past and he's playing a role in

2333
02:09:16.411 --> 02:09:20.280
some movie where whoever is training him says he's fucking phenomenal and he's

2334
02:09:20.281 --> 02:09:23.100
really committed and you're just going to blow you away with this
transformation.

2335
02:09:23.150 --> 02:09:26.070
<v 2>Well,
he's a purple belt.
You know,
he's a purple belt in there.
Higa Machado.</v>

2336
02:09:26.280 --> 02:09:30.510
Who is,
uh,
my,
uh,
in Jujitsu we use the term master,
don't get crazy.

2337
02:09:30.870 --> 02:09:34.170
My master a Jacques Machado.
That's the top of the heap.

2338
02:09:34.171 --> 02:09:36.450
I have a black belt under John Jacques Machado and John John,

2339
02:09:36.451 --> 02:09:38.970
which try to give Eddie Bravo is black pearl and have a black pilling Eddie too.

2340
02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:43.110
So the ultimate top guy,
the food chain in our lineage is John Jacques Machado.

2341
02:09:43.380 --> 02:09:47.580
His brother Hagen is also a bad motherfucker and he can Machado,
um,

2342
02:09:47.790 --> 02:09:51.510
gave Ashton Kutcher a purple belt if he can.
Me Trial gives you a purple belt.

2343
02:09:51.620 --> 02:09:52.710
You're a fucking purple belt.

2344
02:09:53.190 --> 02:09:54.760
<v 4>No,
he's not handing those out because if you're</v>

2345
02:09:55.090 --> 02:09:58.410
<v 2>be score,
it doesn't mean shit.
You gotta Roll and you've got to roll with people.</v>

2346
02:09:58.411 --> 02:10:02.220
You can't,
they don't just give you that.
You have to spar.
That's the only,

2347
02:10:02.300 --> 02:10:06.840
I mean there's martial arts where you don't spar on your way to getting belts,

2348
02:10:07.370 --> 02:10:10.890
like [inaudible] stuff,
right.
For like little kids and stuff.

2349
02:10:11.040 --> 02:10:14.640
But in Jujitsu you have to spar.
You just have to,
you know,
you,
you,

2350
02:10:14.670 --> 02:10:17.250
there's no other way around it and yeah,
you kind of go full blast.

2351
02:10:17.710 --> 02:10:21.250
<v 4>And would they just evaluate your technique and situations and go,
okay,
yeah,</v>

2352
02:10:21.251 --> 02:10:22.360
you did the right thing there.

2353
02:10:22.361 --> 02:10:24.550
So clearly you have a level of knowledge that has this color.

2354
02:10:24.590 --> 02:10:27.590
<v 2>The guy like Egan,
he can watch your role in five minutes.</v>

2355
02:10:27.591 --> 02:10:29.030
He could probably figure out what you are.

2356
02:10:29.031 --> 02:10:32.240
You know you might be a super athletic purple belt but you make some mistakes

2357
02:10:32.420 --> 02:10:36.650
and you might a a brown belt who's been around for a long time but doesn't have

2358
02:10:36.651 --> 02:10:39.800
the athleticism,
try tap black belts but you have a lot of knowledge.

2359
02:10:40.180 --> 02:10:41.390
He could tell like right away,

2360
02:10:41.391 --> 02:10:43.730
like if someone does like certain like set someone up,

2361
02:10:43.731 --> 02:10:46.430
they try to do something and then the counter they hit him with the counter and

2362
02:10:46.431 --> 02:10:48.830
then they tap a guy.
You're like,
oh that's some slick shit.

2363
02:10:49.040 --> 02:10:50.870
And then you get to see like how many times can that guy do that?

2364
02:10:50.900 --> 02:10:54.890
Like is it just you get lucky this one time and it's a matter of consistency of

2365
02:10:54.891 --> 02:10:58.820
movement.
But it's like chess.
If you could add pieces,

2366
02:10:59.180 --> 02:11:01.940
you know like everybody says it's like human chess sort of,

2367
02:11:01.941 --> 02:11:04.490
but you might only have like a couple of pieces.

2368
02:11:04.490 --> 02:11:08.180
You might have like a footlocker and a guillotine.
Some guys only have one move.

2369
02:11:08.181 --> 02:11:10.460
And they do it over and over and over and over and over again.

2370
02:11:10.461 --> 02:11:13.010
They're just so good at it.
You can't stop that one move.

2371
02:11:13.011 --> 02:11:16.280
That's a strategy that some guys employ and there's a lot of guys that are like

2372
02:11:16.281 --> 02:11:17.540
that are that are essentially black belts.

2373
02:11:17.541 --> 02:11:20.840
It's weird and they have all those other techniques but this one they rely on

2374
02:11:20.841 --> 02:11:24.890
all the time or you're a guy like Eddie Bravo type character that has a hundred

2375
02:11:24.891 --> 02:11:26.780
things you could tap you with at any given moment.

2376
02:11:26.781 --> 02:11:28.040
It was just kind of practicing on,

2377
02:11:28.041 --> 02:11:31.760
you just wished Durbin when someone's rolling with somebody else and they know

2378
02:11:31.761 --> 02:11:35.630
that like a potential belt evaluation or is it like a test is on the line,
right?

2379
02:11:35.631 --> 02:11:39.010
I'm telling him to roll or is it just completely depends on the instructor.

2380
02:11:39.290 --> 02:11:40.730
Different instructors do it different ways.

2381
02:11:40.850 --> 02:11:44.960
Some instructors want to see you compete like in a test situation or they want

2382
02:11:44.961 --> 02:11:46.520
to put you in front of the class and show,

2383
02:11:46.521 --> 02:11:50.060
put a lot of pressure on you and see how you react and some want to see you at

2384
02:11:50.061 --> 02:11:52.400
your very best in a casual,
relaxed environment.

2385
02:11:52.401 --> 02:11:54.140
Where you're not nervous and they want to see what it was,

2386
02:11:54.141 --> 02:11:58.670
your actual skill level and then see if you maintain that skill level when you

2387
02:11:58.671 --> 02:12:03.410
get tested,
got,
you know,
when you do.
So it's completely depends on the,

2388
02:12:03.440 --> 02:12:06.830
um,
the,
uh,
the style of teaching of the instructor.

2389
02:12:06.920 --> 02:12:11.920
But instructors almost always we'll put you in a situation where there's like,

2390
02:12:12.111 --> 02:12:14.420
maybe it will have four people roll and the other people stay.
Like,

2391
02:12:14.421 --> 02:12:17.570
one of the things they'll do is they'll do drills where like,

2392
02:12:17.571 --> 02:12:20.390
you're on the ground,
like you have to go on your back and a guy,

2393
02:12:20.391 --> 02:12:24.110
a new fresh guy gets on top of you for seven minutes and tries to tap.

2394
02:12:24.110 --> 02:12:28.520
You don't keep your keeping your massage.
Um,
and then if you tap that guy,

2395
02:12:28.521 --> 02:12:31.850
you get to stay.
If he taps you,
you have to go.
Or if you guys stalemate,

2396
02:12:31.851 --> 02:12:34.010
you both get out.
Sometimes there's drills like that.

2397
02:12:34.160 --> 02:12:35.840
So when he does something like that,

2398
02:12:35.841 --> 02:12:38.470
he's evaluating how you perform under pressure,
uh,

2399
02:12:38.630 --> 02:12:41.450
how you performed with a bunch of people.
So my point being,

2400
02:12:41.690 --> 02:12:46.040
if Ashton Kutcher got a purple belt from Hagen Machado,
that Shit's legit.

2401
02:12:46.070 --> 02:12:49.850
There's no,
no one gets fake purple belts.
What does purple belt mean?

2402
02:12:50.060 --> 02:12:52.400
It means you a blue belt is dangerous.

2403
02:12:52.430 --> 02:12:56.300
A guy who's got a blue belt con fuck the average person out.
If they,

2404
02:12:56.420 --> 02:12:58.520
if they get in a situation where it turns into a grappling match,

2405
02:12:58.521 --> 02:13:00.200
they're going to know things.
The average person doesn't know.

2406
02:13:00.890 --> 02:13:04.070
Purple Belt is a level where you should be able to tap blue belts fairly

2407
02:13:04.071 --> 02:13:07.790
consistent.
Really?
Yeah.
So that's,
that's another level removed.

2408
02:13:07.820 --> 02:13:09.770
And purple belts can oftentimes tap brown belts.

2409
02:13:10.040 --> 02:13:11.890
I've seen purple belts get lucky and type flapper.

2410
02:13:11.930 --> 02:13:15.110
Black belts if they have like one specific mood they're really good at is very

2411
02:13:15.111 --> 02:13:17.810
possible.
So purple belt is dangerous.
That's my point.

2412
02:13:18.020 --> 02:13:20.630
They might not have all the knowledge,
but they're dangerous enough.

2413
02:13:20.631 --> 02:13:24.120
So if Ashton Kutcher's a purple belt,
that's all.
It's God damn impressed.

2414
02:13:24.140 --> 02:13:27.260
I love that.
I love hearing handsome bastard.
It's got everything going for him.

2415
02:13:28.220 --> 02:13:32.130
Where is he on your list?
The above.
Goslings above

2416
02:13:32.130 --> 02:13:34.230
<v 5>his head to the left.
Upper left.</v>

2417
02:13:34.231 --> 02:13:38.580
Channing Tatum is above in the tax and the ceilings just holding those posters

2418
02:13:38.581 --> 02:13:38.850
there.

2419
02:13:38.850 --> 02:13:43.800
Jay Z and Beyonce are together holding hands on his wall and one side is it

2420
02:13:43.801 --> 02:13:46.650
likes to lie Miley Cyrus the poster cause you're good so hard.

2421
02:13:46.651 --> 02:13:51.650
It just collects Miley Cyrus is pointing to his toothpaste jar for that on his

2422
02:13:51.680 --> 02:13:55.270
wall.
You're saying North Korea is suffering a complete internet outage?

2423
02:13:55.570 --> 02:13:57.550
Yeah.

2424
02:13:57.840 --> 02:14:02.840
All four of the big pipe pipes are all four computers for computer.

2425
02:14:03.090 --> 02:14:06.720
You think they did you think they just sent some fucking either anonymous or

2426
02:14:06.721 --> 02:14:09.330
down or shot some holes and come pipes?
Come on.

2427
02:14:09.360 --> 02:14:11.340
I think anonymous is fucking with them for sure.

2428
02:14:11.341 --> 02:14:15.150
But I mean that's how much is the government,
the hiding under anonymous.

2429
02:14:15.300 --> 02:14:19.710
There's no way to to know who's launching what.
Beautiful.
Just keep the hose.

2430
02:14:20.070 --> 02:14:21.720
Can they,
can they do that?

2431
02:14:21.720 --> 02:14:23.970
Do you think they have a cutoff switch somewhere where they could just hit the

2432
02:14:23.971 --> 02:14:26.040
switch?
Like the government though?
Yeah,
I mean,
look,

2433
02:14:26.041 --> 02:14:29.730
if you can take just simple packet flooding when you have enough bandwidth where

2434
02:14:29.731 --> 02:14:33.270
you call up Papa,
Comcast,
and Verizon,
these backbone operators and be like,
Hey,

2435
02:14:33.480 --> 02:14:34.313
do me a favor.

2436
02:14:34.350 --> 02:14:38.850
Let's redirect like 12 terabytes of bullshit to their front door right now and

2437
02:14:38.851 --> 02:14:41.970
that is just ringing until sparks are flying out in the computers.

2438
02:14:41.971 --> 02:14:45.750
Just can't crunch that information.
They can do that all day long.
Crazy.

2439
02:14:45.751 --> 02:14:49.890
That's a strategy that you can do with cars.
That's brute force.
It's the same.

2440
02:14:49.891 --> 02:14:53.820
Crazy.
You can see me what I'm in in their goofy fucking system.

2441
02:14:53.970 --> 02:14:56.370
If you could do that,
you can do that.
Wait a minute.

2442
02:14:56.371 --> 02:14:59.370
You could just send packets and just killed their security that with anybody you

2443
02:14:59.371 --> 02:15:00.530
could just,
you could get better.

2444
02:15:00.540 --> 02:15:03.870
I mean in any medium you could get 50 people to surround a human being and just

2445
02:15:03.871 --> 02:15:06.580
screaming at them.
That's it.
That's it.

2446
02:15:07.140 --> 02:15:10.170
They just use the Metallica to torture dudes in the CIA.
Black sites,

2447
02:15:10.171 --> 02:15:12.540
they were just blasting it at 75 decibels,

2448
02:15:12.541 --> 02:15:17.040
but for a week it should go fucking cuckoo.
Go loopy.
There was a guy who

2449
02:15:17.050 --> 02:15:20.980
<v 2>who's doing this,
um,
this speech and he was,
uh,</v>

2450
02:15:22.030 --> 02:15:24.010
he was labeled a men's right advocate.

2451
02:15:24.280 --> 02:15:27.940
So all these feminists got outside of the university hall where was,

2452
02:15:27.941 --> 02:15:30.340
I think it was University of Toronto.
I'm not sure.
I think it was that.

2453
02:15:30.730 --> 02:15:35.410
And they screamed and yelled in the hall and then set off the fire alarms.
Yeah.

2454
02:15:35.740 --> 02:15:39.100
So that this guy could not,
couldn't give a speech and his speech,
yeah.

2455
02:15:39.250 --> 02:15:41.410
It turns out the guy wasn't even a men's rights advocate.

2456
02:15:41.411 --> 02:15:43.630
The whole thing was like completely blown out.

2457
02:15:43.810 --> 02:15:48.100
Like the thing they had like completely misappropriated or misquoted him on

2458
02:15:48.101 --> 02:15:49.840
things.
People just made up quotes,

2459
02:15:49.841 --> 02:15:52.690
made up his positions and then everybody got behind it and got super aggressive

2460
02:15:52.691 --> 02:15:53.950
with it.
But it's like,

2461
02:15:54.010 --> 02:15:57.080
it's kind of hilarious that that is the exact strategy they all went around went

2462
02:15:59.480 --> 02:16:02.030
<v 5>just,
you can't talk about that.
You're not allowed to.</v>

2463
02:16:02.390 --> 02:16:05.510
I don't know what you're going to say,
but whatever you're going to say,

2464
02:16:05.511 --> 02:16:08.240
I don't think you should be allowed to say it can't even,

2465
02:16:08.510 --> 02:16:12.620
it's the backseats Aerostar van tactic where two brothers are fighting and the

2466
02:16:12.621 --> 02:16:15.200
other just screams at one.
It's,
I don't care what you're saying,

2467
02:16:15.380 --> 02:16:16.340
you're not being heard.

2468
02:16:16.940 --> 02:16:19.540
<v 2>You could step in and stop someone from ta,</v>

2469
02:16:19.560 --> 02:16:23.720
I mean you would have to demonstrate that they were like a hate group or

2470
02:16:23.721 --> 02:16:28.010
committing a crime and you can't with this guy like so like they just decided

2471
02:16:28.190 --> 02:16:30.070
that this was what they going to do and that's

2472
02:16:30.070 --> 02:16:33.810
<v 3>fascism.
Like that's,
that's like that's really dangerous.
You're not,
that's,</v>

2473
02:16:33.850 --> 02:16:37.080
everybody had been a vote Joe.
You know,
it's not kindness.
Nah,

2474
02:16:37.400 --> 02:16:39.220
I mean it's like those people's buddied with their voice.

2475
02:16:39.230 --> 02:16:42.340
You're interfering with those people's ability to listen to someone communicate

2476
02:16:42.341 --> 02:16:45.100
because you don't even,
you don't even know what he's about to say.

2477
02:16:45.101 --> 02:16:46.450
You have no knowledge of it whatsoever.

2478
02:16:46.930 --> 02:16:49.930
Appearing with free speech from the perspective of those that are there going,

2479
02:16:49.931 --> 02:16:54.340
wow,
that's their free speech.
No,
they're deciding that they want to do that.

2480
02:16:54.341 --> 02:16:56.800
Their vote,
they get to vote with their voice.
That's what they're thinking.

2481
02:16:56.820 --> 02:17:00.730
Absolutely.
But wait a minute,
then people can just shout you down all day.

2482
02:17:00.731 --> 02:17:03.430
You don't have to think that that should be an issue.
Nope.
It clearly it is.

2483
02:17:03.431 --> 02:17:04.630
I mean there's rules against that.

2484
02:17:04.631 --> 02:17:09.040
In certain areas you can be disorderly and removed.
For City University,

2485
02:17:09.041 --> 02:17:09.890
it's ridiculous.

2486
02:17:09.920 --> 02:17:14.530
It's the you're terrorist threats because a woman is giving a speech on feminism

2487
02:17:14.531 --> 02:17:17.860
and video games or sexism in video games,
that's just as bad.

2488
02:17:17.980 --> 02:17:19.900
You just didn't have the balls to show up and scream at her.

2489
02:17:20.120 --> 02:17:23.670
You called in and anonymous threat.
Any calling in if any anonymous threat.

2490
02:17:23.671 --> 02:17:26.530
It's fucking gross on whatever side.

2491
02:17:26.560 --> 02:17:29.980
I mean we could just say that anybody willing to do that is is a piece of shit.

2492
02:17:30.220 --> 02:17:34.510
These are bad people.
Anybody who's doing that,
whether it's weird real or not,

2493
02:17:34.630 --> 02:17:39.370
whether they're trolling or not,
like come on like Dan is not the way.

2494
02:17:39.580 --> 02:17:44.170
The way is.
Let them talk and expose the goofiness of what they're saying.

2495
02:17:44.200 --> 02:17:47.770
If there's some validity to your argument and if there was no validity to your

2496
02:17:47.771 --> 02:17:49.930
argument,
consider what they're saying.
Like that's,

2497
02:17:49.960 --> 02:17:51.610
that's how human beings interact with each other.

2498
02:17:51.760 --> 02:17:54.490
You don't call them death threats because some chick likes vaginas.

2499
02:17:54.700 --> 02:17:58.630
She's on team vagina.
She's,
you know,
I mean,
that's her thing.
She loves women.

2500
02:17:58.840 --> 02:18:01.330
She thinks that women should be better represented in video games.

2501
02:18:01.331 --> 02:18:03.310
She's Hashtag feminists,
like I said,
what do you want?

2502
02:18:03.490 --> 02:18:04.840
Why is that really affecting you?

2503
02:18:04.950 --> 02:18:09.190
She's stopping you from voting and she stopped sensibilities.
Dammit.
Man.

2504
02:18:09.220 --> 02:18:12.700
It's funny.
It's fascinating.
It's cute.
They're trying to change video games.

2505
02:18:13.120 --> 02:18:17.890
You know,
Laura Croft seemed pretty feminine to me.
Sheree strong,

2506
02:18:18.220 --> 02:18:21.010
sure big titties.
The old gun flapping around.

2507
02:18:21.011 --> 02:18:22.980
I liked them better than they were just like six polygons.

2508
02:18:22.981 --> 02:18:25.900
It's just like aggressive triangles that could jab your eye.

2509
02:18:26.380 --> 02:18:29.870
This video game thing is very fascinating to me because on one hand,
uh,

2510
02:18:29.890 --> 02:18:33.310
I see it as like all these people resisting the radical left,

2511
02:18:33.340 --> 02:18:34.540
the radical left in there,

2512
02:18:34.570 --> 02:18:38.410
their ideas of what should and shouldn't be acceptable in our culture.

2513
02:18:38.680 --> 02:18:43.420
And on the other hand I see it as a bunch of fucking babies that are like

2514
02:18:43.450 --> 02:18:47.020
freaking out and getting crazy about some people's opinions.

2515
02:18:47.020 --> 02:18:51.480
It don't even matter.
I get the old ethics and video games thing.

2516
02:18:51.490 --> 02:18:52.810
There's definitely a point in that,

2517
02:18:52.811 --> 02:18:54.910
but it seems to have branched out way further than that.

2518
02:18:55.410 --> 02:18:58.610
It got corrupted immediately and now there's no like the originals what it is,

2519
02:18:58.611 --> 02:19:01.660
right.
Original argument I believe was not so much about that.

2520
02:19:01.661 --> 02:19:05.080
It was actually about ethics in video game journalism and they were trying to

2521
02:19:05.081 --> 02:19:07.090
prove that these blogs where you know,

2522
02:19:07.091 --> 02:19:10.420
getting paid or colluding with each other or bang in the same chair.
Exactly.

2523
02:19:10.530 --> 02:19:14.090
Exactly.
It all,
it all came down to that but,
and there's a valid gripe there.

2524
02:19:14.091 --> 02:19:18.940
There's a valid argument,
but the movement was so quickly co opted and we see,

2525
02:19:19.260 --> 02:19:22.290
you know we,
you and I yapped about occupy at length and then was eight.

2526
02:19:22.330 --> 02:19:25.330
That was in many cases a physical manifestation that was a physical movement

2527
02:19:25.331 --> 02:19:28.010
that is much harder to coopt,
but you can

2528
02:19:28.010 --> 02:19:31.820
<v 4>expertly do that as we saw pretty easily when it's a digital movement,</v>

2529
02:19:31.880 --> 02:19:36.170
when it can be usernames and there's astroturfing or there's members of a group

2530
02:19:36.171 --> 02:19:40.200
claiming that they're acting on behalf of the entire Hashtag your opted

2531
02:19:40.230 --> 02:19:40.760
overnight.

2532
02:19:40.760 --> 02:19:44.170
<v 1>So what we're seeing,
we're seeing that go on in Ferguson,</v>

2533
02:19:44.171 --> 02:19:48.010
we saw the undercover cops in Oakland that we're in the Eric Gardner protest.

2534
02:19:48.011 --> 02:19:50.740
They were,
they were pointing guns at people that were pointing cameras at them.

2535
02:19:51.040 --> 02:19:54.430
You're going to see those sort of agent provocateurs whenever you have some sort

2536
02:19:54.431 --> 02:19:59.350
of a large scale movement and if it's beneficial for them to insight some sort

2537
02:19:59.351 --> 02:20:03.100
of action that allow them to bring cops in like a loophole in the law,

2538
02:20:03.340 --> 02:20:06.970
like smash a few windows,
right?
Oh they smashed windows to move the cops in.
Boom.

2539
02:20:07.060 --> 02:20:09.070
Start arresting people.
Who is,
who is managing those windows?

2540
02:20:09.190 --> 02:20:12.820
I fucking saw everybody thrown rocks.
Arrest them.
All Zip ties.
Yup.
All around.

2541
02:20:13.330 --> 02:20:17.410
I mean that shit happens.
So if that shit happens with the police,

2542
02:20:17.650 --> 02:20:19.870
wouldn't you assume the two people that grow in at it,

2543
02:20:19.960 --> 02:20:21.580
whether it's the left or the right,

2544
02:20:21.581 --> 02:20:25.870
whether it's the gamers or the Gamer gators or the fucking feminists or the

2545
02:20:25.960 --> 02:20:29.140
men's rights advocates,
everybody's playing dirty there.

2546
02:20:29.150 --> 02:20:30.790
There's a lot of people that troll accounts.

2547
02:20:30.880 --> 02:20:33.310
There's people that are pretending to get death threats and they don't.

2548
02:20:33.311 --> 02:20:35.440
There's people that are sent in real death threats.
There are cons.

2549
02:20:35.680 --> 02:20:39.040
There's men that are pretending to get death threats from the feminists that are

2550
02:20:39.041 --> 02:20:41.500
fake.
There's all sorts of fuckery going on.

2551
02:20:41.501 --> 02:20:44.980
There's all sorts of anyone's involved.
Everyone,
I'm on a fucking mission.

2552
02:20:45.130 --> 02:20:49.240
I'm a part of a group.
Hi Am I came her gator right not your shield.

2553
02:20:49.241 --> 02:20:52.900
You fucks and it's like it becomes like a part of your life.

2554
02:20:52.901 --> 02:20:54.760
It becomes something you're excited to Hashtag.

2555
02:20:54.790 --> 02:20:57.820
Right and then agree with all these other people that are hashtagging that are

2556
02:20:57.821 --> 02:21:00.100
going after that fucking feminist bitch.

2557
02:21:00.101 --> 02:21:03.400
She's trying to ruin my games like she is she or is she just saying she doesn't

2558
02:21:03.401 --> 02:21:06.790
like them?
I mean,
what power does she have?
She's got a fucking youtube channel,

2559
02:21:06.940 --> 02:21:10.740
like she's not stopping any video games from being made.
She's not.
She's like,

2560
02:21:10.790 --> 02:21:11.830
keep you from buying them.

2561
02:21:11.831 --> 02:21:16.670
You how much fucking money is in world of Warcraft or any color.

2562
02:21:17.180 --> 02:21:20.650
You really think that they're going to let some chick who's got a youtube page

2563
02:21:20.680 --> 02:21:24.460
that's going to change anything about these games that you love?
No,

2564
02:21:24.550 --> 02:21:28.030
she's saying she thinks they're a part of the male patriarchy and they're

2565
02:21:28.031 --> 02:21:33.031
fucking horrible toxic masculinity examples like somewhat let her talk,

2566
02:21:33.880 --> 02:21:38.670
keep playing.
Why get offline?
Why not stay online and play and well,

2567
02:21:38.671 --> 02:21:40.750
why worry about what does she have any power?

2568
02:21:40.800 --> 02:21:44.740
She had congress woman and she's running for president,
right?
What the fuck man?

2569
02:21:44.950 --> 02:21:47.890
Oh,
you're mad that a bunch of people agree with her.
What are you crazy?

2570
02:21:47.891 --> 02:21:50.890
You want to get in arguments with people that you don't agree with and you don't

2571
02:21:50.891 --> 02:21:51.560
even know.

2572
02:21:51.560 --> 02:21:53.950
You want to get in the middle of them and just start duking it out back out

2573
02:21:53.951 --> 02:21:54.200
there.
There's

2574
02:21:54.200 --> 02:21:58.500
<v 4>someone say a single remotely disparaging or critical thing about the only pass</v>

2575
02:21:58.501 --> 02:22:02.530
time that I have are my favorite pass time.
You know.
Exactly.

2576
02:22:02.870 --> 02:22:06.650
Shouted down,
fucking shut it down.
We love that because I feel like look,

2577
02:22:06.651 --> 02:22:09.380
shutting off the Internet to,
to an entire country,

2578
02:22:09.381 --> 02:22:12.080
to a society if North Korea is blacked out because we flipped the switch,

2579
02:22:12.081 --> 02:22:16.310
we fired up the low orbiting ion cannon and blasted their internet out.

2580
02:22:16.550 --> 02:22:18.680
That can be dangerous in most cases.

2581
02:22:18.681 --> 02:22:21.710
That can be very dangerous and detrimental to an entire population.

2582
02:22:21.830 --> 02:22:26.250
But in the case of North Korea where I doubt that the average citizen has access

2583
02:22:26.610 --> 02:22:30.480
<v 5>to any semblance of the real internet,
you know,
they're,
I mean,</v>

2584
02:22:30.481 --> 02:22:33.030
they're eating salt from their minds right now.
It's not like they're,

2585
02:22:33.040 --> 02:22:38.040
they're popular.
So rude.
Realize,
um,
sure.
Uh,
yes,
I am.

2586
02:22:38.041 --> 02:22:40.440
Thank you.
Say that they'll take that,

2587
02:22:40.441 --> 02:22:43.330
they'll put it in quotes and you'll be in trouble.
They won't.
Well,
yes they are,

2588
02:22:43.340 --> 02:22:47.040
but they would do that anyways over there on their propaganda posters,
tweeters.

2589
02:22:47.390 --> 02:22:50.160
Here's the thing.
The defense representative North Korea takes me out of context.

2590
02:22:50.190 --> 02:22:51.990
There's worse battles that I have to fight today.

2591
02:22:52.020 --> 02:22:53.820
This is what I think we should do.
Do you,

2592
02:22:54.120 --> 02:22:58.140
do you think this is harming regular average joes?
In north.

2593
02:22:58.160 --> 02:22:59.470
<v 2>Cool.
I think they're fucks Ville.</v>

2594
02:22:59.500 --> 02:23:02.530
If I'm paying attention to the government propaganda,
which I am,

2595
02:23:03.010 --> 02:23:06.550
I think there Foxville.
If you listen to anybody that's survived those,

2596
02:23:06.580 --> 02:23:10.510
those horrible prison camps and if any of those stories even remotely true,

2597
02:23:10.560 --> 02:23:13.120
didn't have 10% of his true,
those people are fucked over there.
Right?

2598
02:23:13.540 --> 02:23:14.920
I think we should by North Korea.

2599
02:23:15.160 --> 02:23:17.050
We should go how much you guys want for this whole place.

2600
02:23:17.140 --> 02:23:21.160
Just go in there and buy it.
I bet it'd be surprisingly cheap.
It sucks.

2601
02:23:21.400 --> 02:23:23.080
How much could it cost?
Seriously?

2602
02:23:23.170 --> 02:23:26.140
How much can North Korea if we just went in and bought the whole country,

2603
02:23:26.380 --> 02:23:28.390
bought the whole government said,
listen,
there's we're gonna.

2604
02:23:28.420 --> 02:23:29.920
We're gonna just by you guys.

2605
02:23:30.010 --> 02:23:34.600
Like how much would the world have to chip in for the world buys North Korea and

2606
02:23:34.630 --> 02:23:39.370
has a like [inaudible] first global democratic society.

2607
02:23:39.371 --> 02:23:42.770
It'll be North Korea.
We just cleaned the whole place up like everybody,
you know,

2608
02:23:42.771 --> 02:23:46.060
you get some money scatter out across the four corners of the world.

2609
02:23:46.410 --> 02:23:50.170
The four kingdoms go wherever you want,
but we,
we own North Korea now.

2610
02:23:50.790 --> 02:23:52.260
<v 5>We would lose such a good boogie man.</v>

2611
02:23:52.650 --> 02:23:56.680
There's such a good boogie man to have cause they do have a new bogeyman that

2612
02:23:56.760 --> 02:24:01.760
Mike Myers Myers was on Saturday night live is Dr Evil Evil and like call it out

2613
02:24:02.790 --> 02:24:06.600
Kim Jong or whatever.
And it's recently.
Yeah,
this Saturday.
And he actually,

2614
02:24:06.900 --> 02:24:10.680
he pulled some good punches.
It was good.
It was a good roast.
A little baby roast.

2615
02:24:11.040 --> 02:24:12.970
You mean he hit him with some good punches?
They didn't pull them.

2616
02:24:13.420 --> 02:24:16.980
Poland pulled off some good offs and coupled off some good punches.

2617
02:24:17.280 --> 02:24:18.031
That's funny man.

2618
02:24:18.031 --> 02:24:22.680
I think that this is a weird time to have a guy in this day and age that is an

2619
02:24:22.681 --> 02:24:26.070
actual real dictator like Hitler styles is any like,

2620
02:24:26.100 --> 02:24:30.540
can y'all 30 or 29 pound around with Dennis Rodman?
I mean,

2621
02:24:30.570 --> 02:24:34.350
what is that to Dennis Rodman speak Korean or does he speak English?

2622
02:24:34.530 --> 02:24:37.710
He speaks to a universal language.
Universal language of the slam.

2623
02:24:37.950 --> 02:24:41.250
He can that man dunks and that's all,
it was just more of a rebounder.

2624
02:24:41.251 --> 02:24:44.160
But I see what you're saying.
You get what I'm saying?
It's a sportsman's analogy.

2625
02:24:44.161 --> 02:24:45.270
I love Athletic Games.

2626
02:24:45.300 --> 02:24:49.350
I love all sports teams and sporting events and score points and I think you're

2627
02:24:49.351 --> 02:24:51.080
being sarcastic.
We talking about,

2628
02:24:51.090 --> 02:24:54.480
I love that you like your video games and love my video games man.

2629
02:24:54.510 --> 02:24:58.720
Do you love them?
I know you.

2630
02:24:58.770 --> 02:25:02.220

Play like Madden,
Madden football.
No,
it's funny,

2631
02:25:02.221 --> 02:25:06.510
I don't the the virtual manifestation of a physical activity is always odd to
me.

2632
02:25:07.020 --> 02:25:10.320
You know Madden and looks pretty dope.
No,
no,
no.
It's great.
It's I,

2633
02:25:10.620 --> 02:25:13.770
it's a great game but for me it's like,
oh I love football.
I would go play.

2634
02:25:13.950 --> 02:25:15.630
I would go and throw a football around here.

2635
02:25:15.631 --> 02:25:18.960
That kind of gun get out and do it kind of sometimes.
Yeah,
absolutely.

2636
02:25:18.961 --> 02:25:21.820
Just off your cowboy boots and get back on the horse.
Shut up.

2637
02:25:22.560 --> 02:25:24.070
Fucking little piece of Straw.

2638
02:25:24.100 --> 02:25:27.400
<v 2>Like a wheat,
a little piece of wheat hanging out of the corner of your mouth.</v>

2639
02:25:27.401 --> 02:25:31.360
Spittoon was those dudes walking around with wheat sticking out of the corner of

2640
02:25:31.361 --> 02:25:34.330
the mouth doing stupid.
That's nice.
In the earth.
That doesn't taste good.

2641
02:25:34.650 --> 02:25:38.110
Sales piece of wheat.
You're chewing on like an asshole.
So avatar man,

2642
02:25:38.490 --> 02:25:41.470
they're getting in touch with their earth there.
Is that what it is?
Mm hmm.

2643
02:25:41.560 --> 02:25:43.540
But it's genetically modified.
Monsanto,

2644
02:25:44.430 --> 02:25:47.950
you getting some weird pesticides into your system so bad.

2645
02:25:48.400 --> 02:25:51.190
It's like a little nicotine sticks.
You're chewing coming out of the ground.

2646
02:25:52.480 --> 02:25:55.420
Avatar,
depression,
frack and Rod,
I'd like to chew on it.

2647
02:25:55.421 --> 02:25:56.830
Get some residual chemical goo.

2648
02:25:56.890 --> 02:26:01.570
Have you heard of any movie ever where they associate a depression to withdrawal

2649
02:26:01.571 --> 02:26:04.120
from the reality that's in that movie other than Avatar?

2650
02:26:04.180 --> 02:26:05.020
<v 4>Do you think though,</v>

2651
02:26:05.021 --> 02:26:08.230
this whole depression thing was just marketing from the movie?

2652
02:26:09.070 --> 02:26:10.770
Cause I mean my girlfriend,

2653
02:26:10.780 --> 02:26:14.320
that's all she does all day is make bullshit articles to promote shit.

2654
02:26:14.321 --> 02:26:17.270
Like totally,
totally plausible,
totally plausible.

2655
02:26:18.040 --> 02:26:20.740
We created a Hashtag avatar depression.
I went,

2656
02:26:20.750 --> 02:26:23.320
got 20 fake accounts to retweet it.
That would be the case

2657
02:26:23.370 --> 02:26:28.370
<v 2>except for the fact that I saw furry convention one time I was in Philadelphia</v>

2658
02:26:28.741 --> 02:26:30.250
or Pittsburgh Rather,
um,

2659
02:26:30.270 --> 02:26:33.510
just completely randomly were there for the UFC and it happened to be a furry

2660
02:26:33.511 --> 02:26:37.920
convention in the saint and looking around at all those people that are wearing

2661
02:26:37.921 --> 02:26:41.790
all these costumes and running around hugging each other and dancing together.

2662
02:26:41.791 --> 02:26:43.500
I'm like fucking everything.
Anything's possible.

2663
02:26:43.510 --> 02:26:47.140
<v 4>Well it's all pie.
Anything see say play.
They yeah,</v>

2664
02:26:47.150 --> 02:26:50.830
we can put on a silver Fox suit and fuck each other.
Anything is possible.

2665
02:26:50.831 --> 02:26:53.970
My friend.
There's a lot of God damn people that are just different.

2666
02:26:54.160 --> 02:26:58.030
I'll never like it was a year three g four was covering comicon and all the,

2667
02:26:58.060 --> 02:27:00.730
like the director called up all the crumbs like got to get up here right away,

2668
02:27:00.740 --> 02:27:03.960
get up here and it came up and to Peel back the curtains and he's like look and

2669
02:27:03.961 --> 02:27:08.290
in the tower across the way,
full on fucking furry orgy with you know,

2670
02:27:08.540 --> 02:27:12.010
chicks with their Fox ears pressed against the glass and they were all fucking

2671
02:27:12.011 --> 02:27:16.980
in a row just on display.
And I was like,
Ma,
Lsu comicon plus human,

2672
02:27:16.990 --> 02:27:19.240
whatever.
Babies are going to pop out of there.
Yeah.

2673
02:27:19.270 --> 02:27:22.930
<v 2>I love when doors get together like that.
I think it's awesome.</v>

2674
02:27:22.960 --> 02:27:26.380
I was thinking that the other day because I was thinking like how much I love

2675
02:27:26.410 --> 02:27:30.940
like a good comic book movie,
Lincoln,
Good Avengers,
movie theaters.
The galaxy.

2676
02:27:31.540 --> 02:27:36.240
Uh,
yes.
Yeah.
Fucking great.
Yeah,
it's really good.
Very interesting.
I'd loved um,

2677
02:27:36.460 --> 02:27:40.010
um,
what we're talking about earlier,
the watchman.
I loved that.
Um,

2678
02:27:40.690 --> 02:27:44.290
big Avengers fan,
you know,
I think those movies are fun.

2679
02:27:44.620 --> 02:27:46.150
I just stood there fun to me.
They,
they,

2680
02:27:46.151 --> 02:27:50.560
they fill some sort of a childish need for like exciting things.

2681
02:27:50.770 --> 02:27:52.240
So when I see like a whole convention,

2682
02:27:52.241 --> 02:27:54.910
like a comic con convention where people like,
you know,

2683
02:27:55.120 --> 02:27:58.870
in their forties can like unabashedly talk about how much they loved the hulk.

2684
02:27:58.900 --> 02:27:59.733
Right?

2685
02:27:59.970 --> 02:28:01.920
<v 4>Right.
And a judgment free zone.</v>

2686
02:28:02.330 --> 02:28:04.830
How much they judgment comes from someone who thinks they'd like hulk more than

2687
02:28:04.831 --> 02:28:08.370
you and wants to catch you on a piece of information.
Something like the wrong,

2688
02:28:08.480 --> 02:28:10.800
more Ghostrider trivia than you do.

2689
02:28:12.840 --> 02:28:16.170
I got the tats man to prove it.
I got nick cage on my inner thigh.

2690
02:28:16.380 --> 02:28:21.020
There has to be a guy who has all ghost rider tattoos.
I would get it.

2691
02:28:21.110 --> 02:28:22.310
Pull that up.
Ghost

2692
02:28:22.340 --> 02:28:25.610
<v 5>man with ghost rider tattoos.
Let's just have a,</v>

2693
02:28:25.670 --> 02:28:30.670
a random wild Google search man with ghost rider tattoos.

2694
02:28:31.251 --> 02:28:34.820
I know there's a ghost rider tattoo because I bet there's some women that have a

2695
02:28:34.850 --> 02:28:37.970
nick cage tramp stamp.
Yeah.
I want to see the floating around.
Ben Affleck.

2696
02:28:38.060 --> 02:28:39.020
Dare Devil Tattoo.

2697
02:28:39.980 --> 02:28:43.160
Someone went all it was announced there will be somebody.

2698
02:28:43.680 --> 02:28:47.000
There's a lot of images in Scholes,
man.
There's the bike.

2699
02:28:47.001 --> 02:28:49.760
Look at the bike on the back.
Fuck got mad at her.

2700
02:28:51.380 --> 02:28:54.980
He's chasing the demon in the bottle dudes.
Well,
did you see the skull,

2701
02:28:55.160 --> 02:28:57.440
Abraham Lincoln one at the top.
I know it's a little unrelated,

2702
02:28:57.441 --> 02:29:01.010
but did you see that in the suggested Oh wow.
What the fuck?
Whoa.

2703
02:29:01.070 --> 02:29:03.350
It's like decomposing Lincoln.
People were creepy.

2704
02:29:05.420 --> 02:29:08.780
Alfred e Neuman.
Why worry about the theater?

2705
02:29:09.140 --> 02:29:12.520
Why would anybody do that to Lincoln asshole?
Yeah,
there's,

2706
02:29:12.980 --> 02:29:16.700
there's a lot of ghost rider tattoos.
Holy thinking would be sweet.
Dude,

2707
02:29:16.730 --> 02:29:17.540
I saw some,

2708
02:29:17.540 --> 02:29:22.540
someone posted a link to a on Twitter yesterday to three d tattoos like,

2709
02:29:23.400 --> 02:29:26.270
or they buy based off the perspective.
Yeah.
If you find the link,

2710
02:29:26.271 --> 02:29:30.320
there's like the top 11 three d tattoos and they had these,

2711
02:29:30.830 --> 02:29:35.390
just like what they're doing now with like shading and color is to try to trick

2712
02:29:35.391 --> 02:29:38.570
your mind into thinking things are three dimensional and you're like,
what?

2713
02:29:38.830 --> 02:29:41.870
I really want to see them in real life because what's the thing from the camera

2714
02:29:41.871 --> 02:29:44.870
angle,
it looks like the,
the,
the,
their arm is collapsing,

2715
02:29:44.871 --> 02:29:47.930
but from the right side it looks like you got a giant droopy black,

2716
02:29:48.200 --> 02:29:51.770
nothing going down your arm,
you know,
that's awesome.
But that's,

2717
02:29:51.771 --> 02:29:55.910
we're looking at Spiderman like a spider man logo through regards torn chest.

2718
02:29:55.940 --> 02:29:59.810
That's amazing how good that looks.
Yeah.
But there's,
there's a gang of those,

2719
02:29:59.811 --> 02:30:02.540
dude,
I wonder if there's some practical makeup going on with that too.

2720
02:30:02.541 --> 02:30:05.870
Like he has to shade that in the morning.
That Butterfly Fuck.
Yeah.

2721
02:30:06.140 --> 02:30:09.920
Have you seen street art that's like this?
They all think of chocolate or,
yeah,

2722
02:30:09.980 --> 02:30:12.230
those guys.
That's again,
that's all perspective stuff.

2723
02:30:12.231 --> 02:30:16.220
So it's like from that one angle,
that butterfly looks awesome from the side.

2724
02:30:16.221 --> 02:30:18.590
It looks like you have a mole,
a giant butterfly shape,

2725
02:30:18.591 --> 02:30:23.180
mold and Nathan Click on that lady.
Oh my God.
That's nuts.

2726
02:30:23.240 --> 02:30:25.660
That is so crazy.
Yeah.

2727
02:30:25.661 --> 02:30:28.370
To dating a girl like that though and having to see that when you're trying to

2728
02:30:28.371 --> 02:30:30.310
fuck or how about coming on?
That's what,
yeah,

2729
02:30:30.440 --> 02:30:34.160

2731
02:30:35.751 --> 02:30:39.890
She's got like fairy friends hunted dude up in the left up up to the left.

2732
02:30:39.891 --> 02:30:42.740
I don't think that's real.
Look at that.
Look at her.
I click on that.

2733
02:30:43.100 --> 02:30:46.920
What the fuck man?
She got some,
some cheap pellets coming.

2734
02:30:47.050 --> 02:30:51.680
Our pedals below her eyeball.
Fuck all that to make up the hope.

2735
02:30:51.730 --> 02:30:56.270
That's not even a real [inaudible].
Oh my God.

2736
02:30:56.271 --> 02:30:58.580
That's a pretty good

2737
02:31:00.700 --> 02:31:05.240
ah shit.
Holy Shit Man.
Baby on here.
That's pretty sweet.

2738
02:31:05.241 --> 02:31:09.710
I had a,
a,
a three dimensional map on his back with like,
um,

2739
02:31:09.740 --> 02:31:13.250
like a sextant over it.
Oh my God,

2740
02:31:14.480 --> 02:31:16.980
that's so crazy.
A cat living on her side.

2741
02:31:16.990 --> 02:31:20.040
Cheshire cat peeking out of the side of the road.
Eyeballs are

2742
02:31:20.040 --> 02:31:23.190
<v 2>amazing.
Look,

2743
02:31:23.340 --> 02:31:28.150
<v 5>[inaudible] lighter guy meets a Cheshire cat girl.</v>

2744
02:31:28.390 --> 02:31:32.440
She's like,
I just can't respect your,
oh my God.
That's great.
Whoa.
That's dope.

2745
02:31:32.470 --> 02:31:36.190
Like I got a sweet 3d natty ice can on my abs.
It's like,
why?

2746
02:31:36.220 --> 02:31:37.900
That's the object you went to make three d.

2747
02:31:37.930 --> 02:31:42.030
There's some serious fucking tattoo artists.
These neck eyeball.

2748
02:31:42.080 --> 02:31:45.280
Nobody's saying you can't see it unless he does that.
That's cool.
Well,

2749
02:31:45.281 --> 02:31:48.820
you would know something's there.
You're like,
what's going on down there?

2750
02:31:49.060 --> 02:31:53.170
This guy has a high ball.
Oh my God.
You know she didn't do that.
No,

2751
02:31:53.171 --> 02:31:56.230
she didn't do that.
That's got to be picked out or something.
Or is it real?

2752
02:31:56.231 --> 02:31:59.620
What does it say?
Oh my God,

2755

<v 2>God.
That might be real shit if it is</v>

2756
02:32:10.920 --> 02:32:13.390
<v 5>hit random.
Let's see what else pops up on this climb stairs.</v>

2757
02:32:13.830 --> 02:32:17.160
I guarantee you that someone's done that this.
Oh,
I'm sure.

2758
02:32:17.310 --> 02:32:19.830
Just because it looks like a normal girl.
That's what's freaking you out.

2759
02:32:20.040 --> 02:32:23.280
I bet that with some subdermal implants going on,

2760
02:32:23.310 --> 02:32:24.660
you could really fuck some shit up.

2761
02:32:24.661 --> 02:32:27.410
You could really make sure you never get a job at a bank.
Yes.

2762
02:32:27.420 --> 02:32:31.380
Check dermal implants
put on his feet forever.

2763
02:32:32.220 --> 02:32:33.150
That's strange,

2764
02:32:33.500 --> 02:32:37.400
<v 2>Bro.
How weird.
Oh,
look at this.
No tattoos for Kevin prayer.</v>

2765
02:32:37.401 --> 02:32:39.470
How about super creative on your back?
Hello.

2766
02:32:39.620 --> 02:32:42.830
It'll be there in like gladiator logo.
Super Creative,
right?
With that,

2767
02:32:42.831 --> 02:32:45.940
I want to get someone to make it in like sacred geometry.
That's what I want.

2768
02:32:45.941 --> 02:32:48.320
Now I want you to do it and you fucking calls Satan.

2769
02:32:49.070 --> 02:32:53.030
If you didn't know if I get that men use a Wedgie board at the same time,

2770
02:32:53.031 --> 02:32:57.320
then the than the demon corridors open.
Yeah.
He fucks up like one room.

2771
02:32:57.420 --> 02:33:01.310
Just changes.
It should've pointed left points,
right?
Right.

2772
02:33:01.311 --> 02:33:03.110
Satan's like you called bitch.
Dude.

2773
02:33:03.111 --> 02:33:07.760
What I'm hearing is he suing me for copyright infringement for trademark

2774
02:33:07.761 --> 02:33:09.700
infringement turns you into the ghost rider.
Oh yeah.

2775
02:33:09.770 --> 02:33:12.650
You gotta live your life for the rest of your life flying around.

2776
02:33:12.980 --> 02:33:17.300
Apparently Nicolas Cage did a new movie,
a new,
a super religious movie.

2777
02:33:17.301 --> 02:33:20.780
A version of the left behind series,
you know,
really behind movies.

2778
02:33:21.070 --> 02:33:24.170
Ever say familiar.
I haven't seen the movies.
Kirk Cameron did them.
Right?

2779
02:33:24.171 --> 02:33:27.680
Like I had VHS copies of them because they're wonderful.

2780
02:33:30.110 --> 02:33:34.310
They're fucking hilarious.
It's about the rapture.
Exactly.
Yeah,
exactly.

2781
02:33:34.640 --> 02:33:38.780
And the books are a hugely popular Christian books.
I mean,
they're there.

2782
02:33:38.781 --> 02:33:41.730
They've sold millions of copies and the,
that's the plot point.

2783
02:33:41.731 --> 02:33:44.180
It's fucking hilarious.
It's just,
you know,
Jesus comes,

2784
02:33:44.181 --> 02:33:46.630
it takes everybody to have,
and everybody's going,
Woo,
Woo.

2785
02:33:46.710 --> 02:33:49.400
Let's say some of the week I'll get,
oh,
guess we're all sinners.

2786
02:33:51.060 --> 02:33:54.750
Everybody else went to heaven.
Yeah,
yeah.
That's there in heaven.
Oink,
oink.

2787
02:33:55.190 --> 02:33:59.420
Aliens came down and ate him.
You fucking idiots.
The eight,
all the lemmings.

2788
02:33:59.421 --> 02:34:03.400
They were willing to get on the spaceship.
Jesus.
Jesus at this patient.
Yeah,

2789
02:34:03.740 --> 02:34:07.230
<v 5>I know what I felt could do.
Are you going to heaven?</v>

2790
02:34:07.410 --> 02:34:10.800
You fucking queers while you gay marriage could look good luck.

2791
02:34:10.801 --> 02:34:11.790
You're gonna burn in hell.

2792
02:34:11.940 --> 02:34:16.940
I'm going to be feasting at the garden right next to St Pete and we're going to

2793
02:34:16.951 --> 02:34:18.280
be flowing robes

2794
02:34:18.280 --> 02:34:21.730
<v 2>and now convert.
All my animals are going to be there.
All animals,</v>

2795
02:34:21.731 --> 02:34:24.580
all dogs go to heaven.
All your parents,
friends,

2796
02:34:24.970 --> 02:34:28.990
all your friends that died and drunk accidents.
They didn't know any better.
Sure.

2797
02:34:29.260 --> 02:34:31.780
God took the man.
They're all going to be in heaven waiting for you.

2798
02:34:31.781 --> 02:34:35.350
It's going to be amazing.
Every day is going to be super bowl Sunday every day.

2799
02:34:38.230 --> 02:34:39.790
I love that.
Like once you're up there though,

2800
02:34:39.791 --> 02:34:42.130
like all bets are off because you made it to heaven and there is no,

2801
02:34:42.160 --> 02:34:45.100
you don't really get booted out of heaven.
Right.
Forgiveness is sort of the,

2802
02:34:45.430 --> 02:34:47.960
that's like the,
that's the motto there.
That's the emo.

2803
02:34:48.730 --> 02:34:53.360
I bet you just repress the gayness enough so that when you get raptured then you

2804
02:34:53.361 --> 02:34:56.500
just suck in all the dicks on clouds.
No,
that's not how it works.

2805
02:34:56.620 --> 02:34:57.431
That's exactly how it works.

2806
02:34:57.431 --> 02:34:59.470
I can't go to heaven if you've got all that gay in your heart.

2807
02:34:59.720 --> 02:35:03.670
If that's forgiven,
you're getting your funnel.
You have to get rid of the gay.

2808
02:35:03.790 --> 02:35:06.880
I'll have to pray it away before you get on the spaceship.
Exactly.
Ah,

2809
02:35:06.881 --> 02:35:08.260
you got to pray the gay away.
Got It.

2810
02:35:08.440 --> 02:35:12.730
You got to pray it away or you know he can't have it in your head.

2811
02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:16.710
That's the whole idea.
When they do get to heaven,
they just hang out,
right?
Yeah.

2812
02:35:16.720 --> 02:35:18.130
What do you,
what the fuck do you do up there?
No one,

2813
02:35:18.131 --> 02:35:22.400
no one ever adequately explained adequate Lee.
What?

2814
02:35:22.420 --> 02:35:25.330
No one ever explained to me.
What happened after Jesus came back from the dead.

2815
02:35:25.390 --> 02:35:28.030
Did he die of old age?
Well,
how come he's not still around?

2816
02:35:28.240 --> 02:35:31.270
Like he came back to life,
right?
He was dead for three days,
came back to life,

2817
02:35:31.271 --> 02:35:35.920
freaked everybody out.
They all wrote about it and then what?
Where's he now?

2818
02:35:36.670 --> 02:35:40.030
Where was he then he didn't do anything like there's no great stories like,

2819
02:35:40.120 --> 02:35:43.180
and then he stopped all the wars and then he fed all the poor people and he

2820
02:35:43.181 --> 02:35:43.781
decided to do,

2821
02:35:43.781 --> 02:35:46.510
was going to educate people on what his dad and that everyone's going to believe

2822
02:35:46.511 --> 02:35:46.601
him.

2823
02:35:46.601 --> 02:35:49.690
Cause he came back from the dead and he's going to live for a hundred years and

2824
02:35:49.691 --> 02:35:52.060
change.
It's like,
nope,
nope.
That's equal to the bottom of the bag,

2825
02:35:52.230 --> 02:35:54.670
bitches back and I'm gone again.

2826
02:35:54.910 --> 02:35:59.830
He just came back from the dead.
Tada releases doves and then poof,

2827
02:36:00.010 --> 02:36:01.270
disappears.
In a way.

2828
02:36:01.271 --> 02:36:05.110
It's a lot like the Adam and Eve story with like a cursory examination of the

2829
02:36:05.111 --> 02:36:06.160
facts in the story.

2830
02:36:06.310 --> 02:36:10.480
If you were on the first 48 and if you are one of those officers sat down across

2831
02:36:10.510 --> 02:36:13.810
from the person,
he'd be like,
okay,
let me get this straight so you show me.

2832
02:36:14.170 --> 02:36:18.610
Is it all the people came from a guy named Adam and his wife named eve,

2833
02:36:18.611 --> 02:36:21.790
so they had sex and they made kids and then I guess they just start fucking

2834
02:36:21.791 --> 02:36:24.310
their kids or their kids started fucking each other.

2835
02:36:24.590 --> 02:36:27.340
Everybody just fucked each other that they had to is the only way you can make

2836
02:36:27.341 --> 02:36:28.810
people's people have to have sex with each other?

2837
02:36:28.811 --> 02:36:31.360
Is that what you're trying to tell?
Me and the guy on the other side be like,

2838
02:36:31.450 --> 02:36:32.470
I need to talk to my lawyer.

2839
02:36:34.090 --> 02:36:38.190
I hope that season two of cereal tired out examination shows,

2840
02:36:38.200 --> 02:36:40.300
that would be exactly what would happen.
They would come,

2841
02:36:40.990 --> 02:36:43.720
they would come in and I'll go,
okay,
well let's just,
let's just draw this.

2842
02:36:43.721 --> 02:36:46.570
We're going to draw this out.
Let's start with Robert here and figures.

2843
02:36:46.630 --> 02:36:48.130
We're going to have them.
This is a male figure,

2844
02:36:48.131 --> 02:36:51.580
like one of those bathrooms where you have like the bathroom icon with a girl

2845
02:36:51.581 --> 02:36:55.750
with the skirt.
Sure.
And then the guy would skirt,
this is dad.
This is mom.

2846
02:36:56.690 --> 02:36:59.950
So Dad,
mom,
fuck.
And they have kids.
And who starts fucking first,
right?

2847
02:37:00.040 --> 02:37:03.100
Cause the sun.
Fuck.
The mom wasn't a mate of his bone.
Wasn't that part of her?

2848
02:37:03.101 --> 02:37:05.680
Adam was made from the bone.
Some of them was made from a range,
right?

2849
02:37:05.730 --> 02:37:09.220
A piece of a rib bone eve was made from the rib of,
has made from the rib.
Okay.

2850
02:37:09.250 --> 02:37:13.760
And of course,
always blame it on chicks.
Eve gave into that snake shit.

2851
02:37:13.870 --> 02:37:16.040
That's a fucked us up.
She really about you.
Imagine the

2852
02:37:16.040 --> 02:37:20.060
<v 5>idea that one chick back when you couldn't even read,
no one had a cell phone.</v>

2853
02:37:20.300 --> 02:37:24.830
There was no internet and no cars,
no planes,
no fucking television.
Right?

2854
02:37:25.010 --> 02:37:29.270
This one chick fucked it up for everybody.
Like we have all eternity.

2855
02:37:29.720 --> 02:37:33.230
What are convenient way to like to,

2856
02:37:33.270 --> 02:37:37.010
to blame one person,
right?
And one gender for everything that we've ever done.

2857
02:37:37.160 --> 02:37:40.270
I want to believe that the lapel footage of her grabbing that apple and taking a

2858
02:37:40.300 --> 02:37:41.780
bite would be on Worldstar

2859
02:37:41.910 --> 02:37:46.510
<v 6>oh
fuck</v>

2860
02:37:47.530 --> 02:37:48.640
<v 5>woes dog.</v>

2861
02:37:48.720 --> 02:37:52.390
When the world stopped you and Adam founder eating an apple and started beating

2862
02:37:52.440 --> 02:37:54.580
around,
that would be on Worldstar.

2863
02:37:54.850 --> 02:37:57.730
This is forever when we just allow it gets forever.

2864
02:37:57.790 --> 02:38:00.520
Are you allowed to beat your wife in the Bible?
Is that legal?
Yeah,

2865
02:38:00.550 --> 02:38:04.300
it's legal in the Quran,
right?
Depends on what she does.
Right.
Domestic violence,

2866
02:38:04.540 --> 02:38:06.670
which,
which uh,
is the Bible allow it?

2867
02:38:06.760 --> 02:38:09.430
I know like there's certain depends on budget,
which revision.

2868
02:38:09.431 --> 02:38:12.010
I think you're going with,
there's certain Muslim texts.

2869
02:38:12.050 --> 02:38:16.580
<v 1>David have alluded to the idea that a man should be able to beat his wife.
Right?</v>

2870
02:38:16.590 --> 02:38:16.840
Right.

2871
02:38:16.840 --> 02:38:19.780
<v 5>Is that true?
Is that,
am I making this up?
Let's say?
No,
I think so.</v>

2872
02:38:19.781 --> 02:38:22.150
It's all of your interpretation.
Okay.

2873
02:38:22.151 --> 02:38:25.510
Let's look up why you're allowed to beat slaves and certain parts of the Bible.

2874
02:38:25.511 --> 02:38:28.060
Like that's for sure.
You're allowed to own and reprimand your slaves.

2875
02:38:28.090 --> 02:38:30.730
Are you allowed to reprimand them?
Yeah.
You're allowed to come.

2876
02:38:30.731 --> 02:38:32.500
And Mary Madeline or whatever her name was.

2877
02:38:32.790 --> 02:38:36.070
<v 1>No,
you're not allowed to commoner.
She's just like got pregnant.
I magically,</v>

2878
02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:40.720
that was a,
that was how it went down.
Cover up.
Yeah.

2879
02:38:41.800 --> 02:38:44.440
Does Islam allow wife reading?
Okay.

2880
02:38:44.770 --> 02:38:49.450
This isn't an actual Islam,
um,
website.
Snopes comic website.

2881
02:38:49.630 --> 02:38:52.020
Know some husbands are violent.

2882
02:38:52.050 --> 02:38:54.430
They said the Quran allows them to beat their wives there.

2883
02:38:54.431 --> 02:38:58.300
Any logical explanation giving given regarding men being allowed to beat their

2884
02:38:58.301 --> 02:39:00.790
wives as stated in,
I don't want to butcher this.

2885
02:39:01.030 --> 02:39:04.300
Serrat on Nisa and I s s oh,
you nailed it.

2886
02:39:04.301 --> 02:39:08.110
Verse 34 and the Name of Allah,
Most Gracious,
Most Merciful,

2887
02:39:08.140 --> 02:39:12.640
all praise and thanks are due to our law and peace and blessings be upon his

2888
02:39:12.641 --> 02:39:16.110
messenger.
Okay.
Ba,
ba Ba ba Ba ba Ba ba Ba ba Ba ba Ba.

2889
02:39:16.450 --> 02:39:19.830
I'm trying to find out about wife beaten.
I Dunno.

2890
02:39:20.900 --> 02:39:21.970
It doesn't make any sense.

2891
02:39:23.350 --> 02:39:24.820
<v 5>Yeah.
Same thing with the honor killings.</v>

2892
02:39:25.540 --> 02:39:28.780
Some people will quote certain passages and say,
well,

2893
02:39:28.781 --> 02:39:30.820
you're allowed fit is as long as your honor was offended,

2894
02:39:30.821 --> 02:39:31.990
you were allowed to kill somebody.

2895
02:39:31.991 --> 02:39:35.680
But someone else will quote another passage and say,
no,
I'll,
murder is wrong.

2896
02:39:35.710 --> 02:39:39.460
It says it right there.
And some chapter.
Yeah.
This doesn't make any sense,

2897
02:39:39.461 --> 02:39:44.190
but there's different religion.
The president of the US Lamek

2898
02:39:44.250 --> 02:39:46.440
<v 1>Society of North America states according to the Quran,</v>

2899
02:39:46.441 --> 02:39:49.620
the relationship between the husband and the wife should be based on mutual love

2900
02:39:49.621 --> 02:39:53.670
and kindness.
I'll ask says,
and among his signs is this,

2901
02:39:53.671 --> 02:39:58.671
that he created for you mates from among yourselves that Ye may dwell and

2902
02:39:59.041 --> 02:40:00.210
tranquility with them,

2903
02:40:00.990 --> 02:40:05.990
and he has put love and mercy between your hearts verily in that are signs for

2904
02:40:08.221 --> 02:40:13.110
those who reflect.
See,
that's the problem,
man.
Whenever you're reading old shit,

2905
02:40:13.200 --> 02:40:16.860
they write it like that.
Okay.
What the fuck did I just say?

2906
02:40:16.890 --> 02:40:20.580
Whenever you're reading a tweet,
it could be that confusing.
This is,
no,

2907
02:40:20.760 --> 02:40:24.680
this is the thing that they're trying.
Right?
Exactly.
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah.

2908
02:40:24.720 --> 02:40:27.810
This is the statement that they're trying to,
um,

2909
02:40:28.260 --> 02:40:32.160
to conceive as being said that it allows wife beating,
right.

2910
02:40:33.600 --> 02:40:35.460
Notice they still use that language.
Yes.
An IRS.

2911
02:40:35.461 --> 02:40:39.000
But also when like talent contracts in court,
it's like,
yeah.
Anything legal.

2912
02:40:39.001 --> 02:40:43.110
Anytime someone's trying to fuck you or trying to preclude you from fucking them

2913
02:40:43.111 --> 02:40:46.350
somehow.
It's always very early in perpetuity.

2914
02:40:46.680 --> 02:40:50.710
And the various similar to that of the ancillary spinoff of the CPM of the,

2915
02:40:50.711 --> 02:40:54.600
what the fuck are you trying to say to me?
Yeah,
yeah,
that,
that,
that I just read.

2916
02:40:54.900 --> 02:40:58.920
Yeah.
That is what they're using to diverse,
saying that on its surface,

2917
02:40:58.921 --> 02:41:02.490
meaning taking it to allow wife beating that,
that statement that I just said.

2918
02:41:02.520 --> 02:41:07.080
Sure.
What the fuck,
how it,
what does that even mean?
And among his signs is this,

2919
02:41:07.200 --> 02:41:11.340
that he created for you mates from among yourselves that Ye may dwell and

2920
02:41:11.341 --> 02:41:16.341
tranquility with them and he has put love and mercy between your hearts verily

2921
02:41:17.160 --> 02:41:22.050
in that are signs for those who will reflect.
How was that wife beating?

2922
02:41:22.080 --> 02:41:23.580
Well,
what the fuck does that even mean?

2923
02:41:23.760 --> 02:41:28.050
It's just like when you read old shit like this,
like really ancient scripts.

2924
02:41:28.380 --> 02:41:32.190
It's very difficult to figure out what the hell there they were saying.
Sure.

2925
02:41:32.280 --> 02:41:34.710
And this is just a translation.
I mean,

2926
02:41:34.790 --> 02:41:37.560
did you understand it in the language that's being spoken?

2927
02:41:37.561 --> 02:41:39.000
It's a completely different statement.

2928
02:41:39.001 --> 02:41:41.730
I'm sure they literally don't have in some languages,

2929
02:41:41.731 --> 02:41:44.670
they don't have words for the thing that you're saying or describing.

2930
02:41:44.671 --> 02:41:46.080
There is literally no word for it.

2931
02:41:46.081 --> 02:41:49.170
So right there you're translation or your interpretation is broken.
Well,

2932
02:41:49.171 --> 02:41:52.800
my friend Steve lived in Hong Kong for a while and he spoke Chinese.

2933
02:41:52.801 --> 02:41:56.850
He learned Chinese and one of the things that he said was that one of the things

2934
02:41:56.851 --> 02:42:00.000
that people misconstrue about Chinese people and they speak English is that

2935
02:42:00.001 --> 02:42:04.290
they're rude,
but their language is much more direct.

2936
02:42:04.710 --> 02:42:09.570
They don't speak in the past,
they're just doing,
you know,
you have dog,

2937
02:42:09.810 --> 02:42:13.590
you know,
like do you have a dog?
Have you had a dog?
They don't have those.

2938
02:42:13.680 --> 02:42:16.110
You have dog.
They'll like say it.
Right,
and that's how they can,

2939
02:42:16.111 --> 02:42:19.440
which is a state or a question.
You'll figure that out from the context.
Yeah,

2940
02:42:19.441 --> 02:42:23.410
it's some,
it's really interesting to hear him explain while they're,

2941
02:42:23.420 --> 02:42:27.300
while there's so many misconceptions about the way a Chinese people communicate

2942
02:42:27.301 --> 02:42:31.440
with English because their language is so different,
it's confusing as fuck.

2943
02:42:31.441 --> 02:42:33.720
Like to grasp the subtleties of our language.

2944
02:42:33.930 --> 02:42:37.200
They don't exist culturally in their language.
So I'm like,

2945
02:42:37.230 --> 02:42:38.730
I was trying to get them to explain to me like,

2946
02:42:38.731 --> 02:42:43.710
how would you say I used to play the fiddle?
How would you say that?
You know,

2947
02:42:43.740 --> 02:42:48.030
I don't think you say it.
You say,
I play fiddle,
I play fiddle.
Not,

2948
02:42:48.450 --> 02:42:50.770
you know,
I'd really fiddle.
Not now.
You know,
I don't,

2949
02:42:50.780 --> 02:42:52.410
I don't know how the fuck you would say it,

2950
02:42:52.440 --> 02:42:57.240
but you can't say the way we think you would say it.
So when they translate,

2951
02:42:57.720 --> 02:43:01.980
uh,
Chinese to English,
it's like,
you know,
you'll go now,
you'll get out of here.

2952
02:43:02.110 --> 02:43:06.480
Right.
It's weird.
It's a weird sort of cultural disconnect.
Sure.

2953
02:43:06.540 --> 02:43:09.090
That's what this shit too,
man.
That's why in 17 years from now,

2954
02:43:09.091 --> 02:43:11.980
we're all speaking Emoji.
That's all it's going to be.
Do you have to call?

2955
02:43:12.030 --> 02:43:14.030
<v 5>It's going to be,
I'm going to be that.
We're not talking right.</v>

2956
02:43:14.050 --> 02:43:16.510
We're just gonna be beaming.
Thoughts.
Yeah.
We're going to be doing is getting,

2957
02:43:16.511 --> 02:43:18.820
someone's going to be on the Google protocol and you're going to have the

2958
02:43:18.821 --> 02:43:23.050
windows one or whatever and your android is going to mix the message that comes

2959
02:43:23.051 --> 02:43:26.470
over to my iMessage.
She going to be just like a Cordy keyboard.
She universal.

2960
02:43:26.471 --> 02:43:27.460
Even if it's not the best.

2961
02:43:27.540 --> 02:43:29.260
I'm going to figure out one and it's going to be universal.

2962
02:43:29.290 --> 02:43:33.490
Someone's going to run [inaudible],
someone's gonna run some other shit,

2963
02:43:33.491 --> 02:43:36.910
some Linux distro and be like,
I don't think I think differently,
man.

2964
02:43:36.940 --> 02:43:39.970
Have you ever really think differently?
Keyboard if you're using one of them now?

2965
02:43:39.971 --> 02:43:41.650
I try.
I tried for like a week,

2966
02:43:41.651 --> 02:43:46.590
but I was so that was raised on in the Qwerty in the [inaudible] that I could

2967
02:43:46.720 --> 02:43:50.140
not adjust to it.
People who have no idea what the fuck we're talking about.

2968
02:43:50.230 --> 02:43:52.510
The reason why your keyboard is set up the way it is,

2969
02:43:52.511 --> 02:43:55.600
where it's his Courtney on the top is not because it's the most efficient way.

2970
02:43:55.750 --> 02:43:58.330
It's because back when they had like a real type writer,

2971
02:43:58.510 --> 02:44:01.610
we pressed a button and a gear moved a thing,

2972
02:44:01.730 --> 02:44:05.710
a mechanical stamp and left its mark on paper.
Yeah,

2973
02:44:05.711 --> 02:44:07.970
and they had a lego ink ribbon.
Yup.

2974
02:44:08.090 --> 02:44:11.110
Punch the ribbon down back when that was going on.

2975
02:44:11.260 --> 02:44:13.990
You couldn't do it too fast because if he did,

2976
02:44:13.991 --> 02:44:15.190
they would get all mashed up together.

2977
02:44:15.191 --> 02:44:18.160
When my grandfather had a typewriter and it would always get mashed up and you'd

2978
02:44:18.161 --> 02:44:21.860
have to go in there and unpeel the little fuckers a little arms.

2979
02:44:21.861 --> 02:44:25.540
So we tried to play a cord on it.
Nope.
It was all lenses.

2980
02:44:25.600 --> 02:44:29.170
Super Mechanical.
And so they devised this,

2981
02:44:29.200 --> 02:44:33.730
this positioning to actually make it more difficult to do it fast.

2982
02:44:34.300 --> 02:44:36.490
Like this is not the most efficient way.

2983
02:44:36.640 --> 02:44:39.430
This is the most efficient way to keep the common case.

2984
02:44:39.790 --> 02:44:44.080
I thought it was also commonly used letters away from each other so they don't

2985
02:44:44.160 --> 02:44:47.170
got to get your teaching because they don't smash into each other because of the

2986
02:44:47.171 --> 02:44:50.200
commonly used letters were right next to each other.
It would be easier to do.

2987
02:44:50.330 --> 02:44:53.620
I'll be doing next fingers all day and they'd be smashing against each other and

2988
02:44:53.621 --> 02:44:56.320
getting stuck all the time.
See,
I always,
that's fascinating.

2989
02:44:56.321 --> 02:44:57.011
I always thought it was,

2990
02:44:57.011 --> 02:45:00.490
it was arranged that way due to technical limitations and have to place letters

2991
02:45:00.491 --> 02:45:01.510
in certain areas.
But B,

2992
02:45:01.511 --> 02:45:06.220
I thought they were grouped by usage in terms of words and phrases so that your

2993
02:45:06.221 --> 02:45:09.670
hands could easily reach the things.
I'm pretty sure that's what I assumed.

2994
02:45:09.671 --> 02:45:11.980
So if you,
if you,
if you've read an ounce on it,

2995
02:45:12.280 --> 02:45:13.780
then you'd have more knowledge on it than I,

2996
02:45:13.781 --> 02:45:16.540
but pretty sure I'm right about this.
And the divorce,
that keyboard,

2997
02:45:16.541 --> 02:45:17.990
is that what you're saying?
Does that,
doesn't that happen?

2998
02:45:18.040 --> 02:45:19.960
Isn't that the layout and think it is?
Yes.
In divorce,

2999
02:45:19.990 --> 02:45:23.590
the guy from tech TV trying to work.
Okay,

3000
02:45:23.620 --> 02:45:28.510
well he created a great keyboard,
sorry,
sorry,
g four bottom and ruined them.

3001
02:45:28.520 --> 02:45:31.210
I get it.
Read it.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

3002
02:45:31.211 --> 02:45:33.040
It's like me running when I hosted the man show.

3003
02:45:33.041 --> 02:45:35.640
You'll never live it down right now.
Oh,
it's all good.
I'm going to bring up,

3004
02:45:35.650 --> 02:45:37.300
I'm going to bring it back though and I'm going to do it right.

3005
02:45:37.690 --> 02:45:39.980
The going boy you go going to,

3006
02:45:40.270 --> 02:45:44.020
but I've never met anybody that's used at other keyboard.
No,

3007
02:45:44.200 --> 02:45:47.320
there was a time there was,
I remember like when I was 12 or 13 year olds,

3008
02:45:47.321 --> 02:45:47.711
years old,

3009
02:45:47.711 --> 02:45:51.370
there was a keyboard that came out that could be positioned on your thighs or on

3010
02:45:51.371 --> 02:45:53.000
your uh,
the hand,
like the,
the,

3011
02:45:53.160 --> 02:45:56.860
the handles of your chair or whatever and you placed your fingers physically

3012
02:45:56.861 --> 02:46:00.730
into these like little holes and up would be f down would be d left would be

3013
02:46:00.731 --> 02:46:03.820
this,
right,
would be bad or whatever.
And then you had shift commands,
whatever.

3014
02:46:04.030 --> 02:46:08.710
And basically they could put exponentially more keys mathematically speaking

3015
02:46:08.810 --> 02:46:13.520
within just a finger movement.
Nobody wanted to be trained on this new system,

3016
02:46:13.521 --> 02:46:15.380
but the handful of guys that develop this or whatever,

3017
02:46:15.381 --> 02:46:20.350
there's videos of them putting their hands into this thing and just just doing

3018
02:46:20.360 --> 02:46:25.340
little fucking street fighter combos and it's just spitting words onto the thing

3019
02:46:25.341 --> 02:46:27.700
because there's no travel time.
You can just tick,
tick,
tick,
tick,
tick,
tick,
tick,

3020
02:46:27.701 --> 02:46:30.020
tick,
tick,
tick.
Those do it that way.
Fucking awesome.

3021
02:46:30.021 --> 02:46:33.350
Would have to be so weird to go back and forth from that to a regular children

3022
02:46:33.360 --> 02:46:35.420
for keyboard.
No,
I wouldn't have,
I mean sure,

3023
02:46:35.570 --> 02:46:38.600
but imagine putting that into gloves then and just you could do that anywhere.

3024
02:46:38.970 --> 02:46:43.970
I love this guy on a recently Zoltan Istvan who's a futurist in fortune teller

3025
02:46:45.351 --> 02:46:48.980
and a box at the [inaudible] actually smart guy.
He's a big,
he's a,

3026
02:46:49.820 --> 02:46:53.450
one of the guys from the um,
the uh,

3027
02:46:54.800 --> 02:46:59.780
what the word they use singularity university,
singularity university.

3028
02:47:00.170 --> 02:47:00.801
Um,
you know,

3029
02:47:00.801 --> 02:47:05.340
they're all trying to try to get a handle on transhumanism and what all know,

3030
02:47:05.720 --> 02:47:09.620
but he was saying that he believes within 20 years the written language and

3031
02:47:09.621 --> 02:47:13.280
spoken language will all go away and it'll all be done back and forth through

3032
02:47:13.281 --> 02:47:14.900
like headsets.
These headsets,

3033
02:47:14.901 --> 02:47:18.210
his ability that found to transmit a thought and actual thought.
Sure.

3034
02:47:18.470 --> 02:47:20.000
Telepathically through the Internet,

3035
02:47:20.160 --> 02:47:22.250
that that's going to be like standard technology in 20 years.

3036
02:47:22.251 --> 02:47:23.480
We're all going to just use that,
right?

3037
02:47:23.660 --> 02:47:26.750
Imagine we'd be like Cecil here and we're talking inside of each other,

3038
02:47:26.751 --> 02:47:30.440
but when we sit here,
why would we even sit here?
We'll just connect remotely.

3039
02:47:30.500 --> 02:47:33.350
We'll have a mine site.
It's fun to like Skype while you're looking at somebody.

3040
02:47:33.380 --> 02:47:35.510
Yeah,
but I'll be able to show you what I look like.

3041
02:47:35.511 --> 02:47:37.970
I'll be able to project that image into your head and someone else will be able

3042
02:47:37.971 --> 02:47:41.300
to connect to our shared image.
It's true and they won't be able to contribute,

3043
02:47:41.330 --> 02:47:44.030
contribute to it.
There'll be moderation.
What about,
you know,

3044
02:47:44.031 --> 02:47:47.660
I'm in touch with Evan Perez.
We'll synthesize that as well.
The touch is great,

3045
02:47:47.661 --> 02:47:50.630
but you could,
if you can have the fucking demolition man sex,

3046
02:47:50.840 --> 02:47:53.660
that's going to be even more real.
I'm gonna be able to mind.
Fuck you.

3047
02:47:53.870 --> 02:47:58.100
That's coming,
right?
Oh absolutely.
Virtual Reality Vr is happening and look,

3048
02:47:58.130 --> 02:48:02.690
you can train with just with electromagnetic would just put the helmets that you

3049
02:48:02.691 --> 02:48:05.240
strap on that you know,
read the electrical stimulation.

3050
02:48:05.420 --> 02:48:10.040
You could sit down today with off the shelf technology and train a computer.

3051
02:48:10.041 --> 02:48:13.970
When I think the letter f this is what fires off my brain and I think f,
F,

3052
02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:14.930
f over and over again.

3053
02:48:14.930 --> 02:48:18.860
I'm not visualized pictures of F and you could roughly train a computer to

3054
02:48:18.861 --> 02:48:21.920
understand when these synapses fire off.

3055
02:48:21.980 --> 02:48:24.620
This is what I'm thinking about that exists today.

3056
02:48:24.980 --> 02:48:27.650
That exists right now that technology is going to get miniaturized.

3057
02:48:27.651 --> 02:48:29.360
It's going to get flushed out.
They're gonna,

3058
02:48:29.390 --> 02:48:33.740
they're gonna have 100,000 people contribute their brain scans to some Google

3059
02:48:33.741 --> 02:48:35.750
project.
So right out of the box,

3060
02:48:35.751 --> 02:48:39.320
it's going to have an averaging of what most human brains think of when they

3061
02:48:39.321 --> 02:48:42.440
think horse or f or the combination of those two,

3062
02:48:42.441 --> 02:48:46.430
which sounds sexual and out of the box.
And it's going to well,

3063
02:48:46.490 --> 02:48:49.160
to a lot of people,
Joe,
again,
let's not judge and fuck,

3064
02:48:49.400 --> 02:48:53.030
I said F I didn't say fuck.
So out of the box,

3065
02:48:53.510 --> 02:48:55.610
10% of whatever is going to work.

3066
02:48:55.611 --> 02:48:58.760
It's going to have Siri like accuracy with this little fucking beanie that

3067
02:48:58.761 --> 02:49:02.340
you're going to put on and that's going to happen in what,
seven years?
10 years?

3068
02:49:02.670 --> 02:49:02.930
Yeah.

3069
02:49:02.930 --> 02:49:06.690
If we don't blow ourselves up or don't get hit by a meteor or a supervolcano or

3070
02:49:06.691 --> 02:49:08.220
right quick for sure.

3071
02:49:08.550 --> 02:49:11.100
We're going to have some mind bending stuff in just a few years.

3072
02:49:11.101 --> 02:49:13.560
It's really weird to just think about the possibilities.

3073
02:49:13.950 --> 02:49:16.860
It's going to change what we feel is important and not important.

3074
02:49:16.861 --> 02:49:17.460
It's going to really,

3075
02:49:17.460 --> 02:49:22.460
I think it's going to redefine how we even how even think about other people,

3076
02:49:22.620 --> 02:49:24.510
right?
We're going to be so much closer to each other.

3077
02:49:24.511 --> 02:49:27.190
It's going to be very strange.
It's also interesting to think about like the,

3078
02:49:27.390 --> 02:49:32.390
the process of thought to transmitting into any sort of medium to conversation,

3079
02:49:32.491 --> 02:49:35.010
to typing,
to whatever.
There's a barrier there,
right?
There's a,

3080
02:49:35.011 --> 02:49:37.680
there's a time that lapses where you,
some people don't,

3081
02:49:37.681 --> 02:49:40.890
but most formulate a thought.
They worked through it.
How do I want to say this?

3082
02:49:40.891 --> 02:49:42.120
How do I want to express this?

3083
02:49:42.300 --> 02:49:46.440
What's that going to be when that shit is just firing raw in your brain?
Well,

3084
02:49:46.441 --> 02:49:48.180
we have to like form the thought and then go,
okay,

3085
02:49:48.181 --> 02:49:51.300
send like a tweet where we have that over there.
Just because to me,

3086
02:49:51.301 --> 02:49:55.260
raw fucking data coming out.
Like how is that conversation going?
Right?

3087
02:49:55.740 --> 02:49:57.190
How was that conversation?
We're going to,

3088
02:49:57.210 --> 02:49:59.340
we've got to handshake like old modems and be like,
Yo,

3089
02:49:59.341 --> 02:50:01.650
I want to tap into your brain.
You get your permission.
Okay.

3090
02:50:01.800 --> 02:50:05.250
Now we have this mental chat room.
People gonna be mad if you say no.
Right?

3091
02:50:05.251 --> 02:50:08.460
Why don't you let me tap into your brain,
Bro,
right there.
Knocking on your mind.

3092
02:50:08.490 --> 02:50:13.200
Yeah.
I'm a fan.
I loved you on remote control,
Dude.
Fucking,
I'm a Nerdist fan,

3093
02:50:13.201 --> 02:50:17.040
bro.
No,
no,
that's not me.
That's not even a movie.
That's a different guy.
Yeah,
no,

3094
02:50:17.041 --> 02:50:21.210
no,
bro,
Bro.
Bro,
you're the fucking tosh guy.
I love your liver.

3095
02:50:23.000 --> 02:50:25.770
It's going to happen when you give it a timekeeper or were you wanting a high

3096
02:50:25.771 --> 02:50:30.300
five high five,
bro.
Damn.
It went through three hours.
That's three.

3097
02:50:30.330 --> 02:50:34.590
Three.
I'll tell you about g four IOWASCA or any lounge right next to other one.

3098
02:50:34.591 --> 02:50:38.940
Next time you live in la,
man.
[inaudible] man.
No,
I really do.
I was,

3099
02:50:39.180 --> 02:50:42.570
and I'll tell you as much as it was [inaudible] and I miss you,

3100
02:50:42.580 --> 02:50:46.710
I miss you too by the way.
Oh,
sweet.
Uh,
as much as it might sound like,

3101
02:50:46.740 --> 02:50:48.780
like the billowing of smoke through an asshole,

3102
02:50:48.810 --> 02:50:53.810
like it was really amazing and beautiful to see how you're doing what you do

3103
02:50:54.540 --> 02:50:59.540
directly affected the lives for the better of so many people in such a ballsy,

3104
02:51:00.530 --> 02:51:02.950
a drastic way.
It's not to carry waking.

3105
02:51:02.970 --> 02:51:07.260
You met 20 freaks in the fucking jungle resort.
Okay.
I deal with the extremes.

3106
02:51:07.380 --> 02:51:09.480
All right.
I deal with extremists,
crazy people.

3107
02:51:09.481 --> 02:51:13.400
People willing to go to the jungle and drinks a fucking vile tea.
I think.

3108
02:51:13.620 --> 02:51:15.200
I think you,
I think you,
uh,

3109
02:51:15.210 --> 02:51:19.230
enabled people to explore extremes and push themselves into places that would

3110
02:51:19.231 --> 02:51:22.100
normally be off limits and uncomfortable and to be quite honest,

3111
02:51:22.110 --> 02:51:26.820
saved people's lives.
I saw people who literally said this was a last resort.

3112
02:51:26.821 --> 02:51:30.510
If I don't feel any better after this,
I'm done.
I'm punching out.
Well,

3113
02:51:30.511 --> 02:51:33.480
that's beautiful people,
John there because of your podcast,
so thank you.

3114
02:51:33.481 --> 02:51:34.201
On behalf of them.

3115
02:51:34.201 --> 02:51:37.080
I told them I would relay that and it was important to me to do that.

3116
02:51:37.081 --> 02:51:40.710
So Nice of you to do that.
But it's easy as fucking,
I don't deserve shit.

3117
02:51:40.740 --> 02:51:43.830
And all of you would do the same thing if you were kind of situation that I'm
in.

3118
02:51:44.070 --> 02:51:48.180
All of you would express yourself in a way.
If you had the freedoms that I have,

3119
02:51:48.600 --> 02:51:53.190
99% of all people who lived my life would do exactly what I'm doing.

3120
02:51:54.840 --> 02:51:56.250
It's not that hard,
man.

3121
02:51:56.280 --> 02:51:59.400
Just have conversations about shit that's already out there.
That is,

3122
02:52:00.390 --> 02:52:02.070
especially when it comes to psych and dogs,

3123
02:52:02.120 --> 02:52:06.460
they things that could really change people's lives and everyone's treating them

3124
02:52:06.461 --> 02:52:09.760
as if they're frivolous.
Nonsense.
Everyone's treating me like,
yeah man,

3125
02:52:09.761 --> 02:52:12.550
we took some ass.
We got fucked.
Call it drugs anymore.

3126
02:52:12.560 --> 02:52:16.300
I purposely have changed that.
It's,
it's,
it's a plant medicine.

3127
02:52:16.480 --> 02:52:19.630
Oh that's you used beat.
You're going to lose a lot of the right wing people.

3128
02:52:19.920 --> 02:52:21.840
Oh yeah.
There's a lot of the Republicans been,

3129
02:52:21.950 --> 02:52:24.370
they're not gonna be using my Squarespace discount code anymore.

3130
02:52:24.520 --> 02:52:28.330
All those fucking tea party members listening to me.
Plant medicine,

3131
02:52:28.630 --> 02:52:32.680
sot nom,
um,
psychedelic drugs.

3132
02:52:32.770 --> 02:52:35.170
It's okay to say drugs.
Don't be scared of drugs.

3133
02:52:35.200 --> 02:52:38.200
That's why you go to the drugstore folks.
That's why there's so many trucks,

3134
02:52:38.201 --> 02:52:41.650
doors.
You go there to get on medicine.
The word drug is a,

3135
02:52:41.651 --> 02:52:44.260
a confused word.
Correct.
Fucked up.
Just,

3136
02:52:44.380 --> 02:52:47.470
I'm trying to avoid it because I think it starts a conversation on unequal

3137
02:52:47.471 --> 02:52:51.410
footing to guess what's in this Mug.
What is it that caveman coffee?
No,

3138
02:52:51.430 --> 02:52:56.110
caveman coffee is,
please tell me everything from rugs.
It's drugs.
It's caffeine.

3139
02:52:56.200 --> 02:52:58.780
I had to take us with chocolate.
Caffeine.
When I was in Peru.

3140
02:52:58.810 --> 02:53:01.660
The biggest headache I got was because I couldn't drink coffee for three fucking

3141
02:53:01.661 --> 02:53:04.630
days.
Wow.
It wasn't the IOWASCA,
it wasn't the Chuma.

3142
02:53:04.780 --> 02:53:06.790
It was the fucking Folgers that didn't,

3143
02:53:06.850 --> 02:53:09.930
didn't like knock it out of you and the IOWASCA didn't knock it out of you.

3144
02:53:09.931 --> 02:53:13.060
You still wanted coffee?
Oh No.
I mean after the first one it was,
I mean,

3145
02:53:13.150 --> 02:53:16.600
migraine leading up to it because I'd been off of it for two or three days and

3146
02:53:16.601 --> 02:53:19.750
then after the Iowasca happened,
who gives a fuck about caffeine?

3147
02:53:19.751 --> 02:53:22.660
That's child's play.
Wiffle bat to my soul.
Right,

3148
02:53:22.780 --> 02:53:27.160
but aren't you supposed to not take coffee like days leading up to the RMS

3149
02:53:27.170 --> 02:53:28.930
customize and you drank any?
We're not supposed to do,

3150
02:53:28.940 --> 02:53:32.080
it's some say 48 some say 72 hours before.

3151
02:53:32.081 --> 02:53:35.740
So I was off of it for over 72 hours.
So that's why it was the three days.

3152
02:53:35.830 --> 02:53:39.160
Correct you?
Yeah.
And no sugar,
no salt,
no any of that.
I mean,

3153
02:53:39.161 --> 02:53:42.060
you've had that conversation with others,
but next time,
next time.
Yeah,

3154
02:53:42.070 --> 02:53:45.280
next time for sure.
Yeah.
Kevin Pereira.
Thanks.
Joe Rogan is my friend.

3155
02:53:45.281 --> 02:53:48.040
Thank you man.
It's always good to have young Grad something.
All of this success.

3156
02:53:48.041 --> 02:53:50.380
Brian was going to see grand stole yours too.
I mean,

3157
02:53:50.381 --> 02:53:53.160
I want to go outlet shopping anytime at which is me.

3158
02:53:53.860 --> 02:53:55.690
He'll talk to you about celebrities only.

3159
02:53:55.850 --> 02:53:59.580
So we talked to Jamie gave us some great advice on helping our podcast studio

3160
02:53:59.581 --> 02:54:01.060
long as well.
So thank you.
Bye.

3161
02:54:01.120 --> 02:54:05.140
[inaudible] this show is over,

3162
02:54:06.660 --> 02:54:08.910
<v 2>buddy,
for tuning in January 2nd.</v>

3163
02:54:08.970 --> 02:54:12.250
I am at the Mirage in Las Vegas with Joey Diaz,

3164
02:54:12.360 --> 02:54:16.500
Ari Shaffir and Duncan Trussell.
Then January 30th,

3165
02:54:16.501 --> 02:54:20.640
we returned to the Mirage with Tony Hinchcliffe and Ian Edwards.

3166
02:54:20.641 --> 02:54:23.480
Good Lord,
Ladies and Gentlemen,

3167
