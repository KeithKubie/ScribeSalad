GUILHERME PAULOVIC:
My name is Paulovic.

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.320
I'm a Product
Manager of PlayKids.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.000
It means that, in
my day-to-day job,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.920
I talk with parents and kids and
families and businesspeople--

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.000
like the CEO of PlayKids is
over here-- and designers

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.010
in order to get information
to build apps for kids.

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.720
And I'd like to talk today is
about-- imagine the app store.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.090
There's over 100,000
apps in the app stores.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.960
So a parent decides
to download an app.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.950
And then he presents the app
to his little one-- to the kid.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.380
And the kid enjoys
it and loves it.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.740
And you start trying to sell
your product to the parent.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.030
And you get it.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.760
And there's this whole
cycle that is happening.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.380
And after that-- after he
downloads or she downloads--

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.260
and the kid enjoys with
the app, and he subscribes

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.420
or she subscribes
to the app, how

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.660
do you keep these subscribers
engaged to these experiences.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.260
So this is what I'd
like to talk today--

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.530
what we learned so far
in PlayKids in creating

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.580
subscribers in a different
way than our users.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.780
But first, I'd like to give
you some background on what

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.260
is PlayKids, and to get a sense
of the size of the problem

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.940
and the scale of the problem
that we're talking about.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.760
PlayKids is the most curated
educational and entertainment

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.860
platform for kids in the world.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:36.510
We have books and games and
videos through various apps.

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.840
And we deliver entertainment
and education for kids.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.030
To give you more sense
on how big is it,

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.150
PlayKids is watched over
150 million videos a month,

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.360
and kids play over 100
million games a month.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.550
And as you can see in
our engagement numbers,

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.710
we have over 100 countries
that have already

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.280
downloaded PlayKids.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.190
And kids are really
enjoying this-- PlayKids.

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.020
And this has to do pretty
much with the industry

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.640
and what's happening right now.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.180
Last year, people
started getting more time

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.010
seeing and watching videos and
entertainment on their mobile

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.750
rather than TV.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.160
And the same thing is happening
to the kids industry as well.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.870
So although the industry's
shifting from TV and to mobile,

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.800
it's expected of you to
deliver a great experience

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.430
on mobile for those cases.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.570
But there is a thing
that is not changing.

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.530
That is the needs of the parents
and the needs of the kids--

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.770
the motivations for
them to get together,

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.800
the motivation for them
to download an app,

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.920
or even to watch a video,
or to get entertainment,

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.170
or to look for education.

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.990
SPEAKER 1: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:03:03.365 --> 00:03:05.640
SPEAKER 2: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.250
GUILHERME PAULOVIC: I don't
know if you got this--

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:33.480
if you got this translation.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.200
OK.

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.810
And the thing is she and parents
are looking for ways for kids

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.350
to play and interact
with a safer place,

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.510
where the kids are safe, and
they can learn from playing.

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.370
And kids, otherwise,
they want a cool place

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.430
where they get superpowers,
and they can learn,

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.570
and they can paint
and create things.

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.270
And the mix of the things
is the base of PlayKids.

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.080
Why do we learn is upon that.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.280
Our product is created
and based on this.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.480
So PlayKids is based on
a subscription model.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.940
And at first, as we
launched PlayKids,

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.070
we thought that our
life would be like this.

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.150
So we just decided a
subscription model,

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.290
and money would come
month after month.

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.709
And so we discovered
that is not as easy

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.610
as it seems because people
canceled their subscription,

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.140
or there's something
that's happened

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.180
to their subscription
that is canceled,

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.030
or they uninstalled the app.

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.465
And they don't feel
like the app is OK.

00:04:33.465 --> 00:04:34.590
You have to update the app.

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.630
So we started thinking
that, well, it's

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.490
not only a thing that you
just apply a business model.

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.880
You have to act like
a subscription model.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.480
And to do this, you have
to think that you are not

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:49.245
creating an app.

00:04:49.245 --> 00:04:53.190
You have to start thinking about
you are creating a service.

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.200
And people are paying for this
service month after month.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.610
So you have to continuously
be adding value

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.010
to the subscribers.

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:07.890
So along all of this journey, I
created a top list of nine ways

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:11.340
that PlayKids has
evolved with parents

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.640
with this kind of
subscription base,

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:19.230
and what we learned so far,
and how we are adding value

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:21.510
to our subscriber base.

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:25.560
The first thing is that
PlayKids is moving from an app

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:26.720
to a service.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.470
It means that we had
only one app in 2013,

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.380
and we moved it to over
four apps this year.

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:38.220
We moved from only an
app that was giving

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:42.690
videos and games for parents.

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:47.130
For today, a bundle of apps
that we can provide casual games

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:53.160
for kids, for older kids,
and over 1,000 books for kids

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.070
as well, and a communication
tool for families,

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:58.620
and more and more
videos on PlayKids.

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.560
And the very innovative
thing is that with just one

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.660
subscription, we can
unlock all the content

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:05.340
across all our apps.

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:08.700
And this increased a
lot the willingness

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:10.890
to pay of the parents in this.

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:12.595
It's as much as this.

00:06:12.595 --> 00:06:16.200
This is a subscription
banner that we

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.570
were selling all
the apps of PlayKids

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:20.220
within the same subscription.

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:24.930
And these are the results
just after the launch.

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:28.170
We increased 81% in
sales, and bringing people

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:33.790
to subscribe to our service by
providing a variety of apps--

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:36.660
a bundle of apps with
the same subscription.

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:40.040
And also, by creating
this platform,

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:43.050
we could announce
ourselves as a service.

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:46.920
So we created a feature
across all our apps

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.980
that would
cross-promote our apps.

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:53.610
And then we could make a
more better understanding

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:56.310
for parents that we
were not just an app,

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:58.720
but a bundle of apps.

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.810
And by then downloading
one app, they

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:03.180
could use all the content
of the other apps as well.

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:05.730
And one app
complements each other.

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:14.458
It increases more and more the
willingness to pay for parents.

00:07:14.458 --> 00:07:18.472
And we also have
PlayKids catalog

00:07:18.472 --> 00:07:19.680
that we have a lot of videos.

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:24.150
In over 28 countries,
every country

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:26.910
has a different catalog that
we will license content.

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:32.370
And every week, every Friday,
we launch our new episodes

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:35.730
or new videos or new characters.

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:43.680
And maintaining these
launches every week,

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:46.350
there's a lot of work
to get done to get this.

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:50.040
And this constant
update-- the constant look

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:52.740
for prospection for new
characters, characters

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:58.410
that kids love, characters
that parents care about.

00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:03.120
And this updating our
services and updating our apps

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:06.300
frequently with this creates
a sense to the parents

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:07.935
that it is a service.

00:08:07.935 --> 00:08:08.790
It's not an app.

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:09.680
It's not finished.

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:11.900
It's constantly evolved.

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:16.380
And for us, it's very important
to have a mix of local content

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:19.680
like [INAUDIBLE] in Brazil,
or Daniel Tiger in the US,

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:24.060
with famous and well-known
characters such as Pocoyo

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:26.612
or Backyardigans and so on.

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:31.850
Everything that we
design on PlayKids

00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:34.230
is for the amusement
of the little ones.

00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:36.090
If you don't design
for the little ones,

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:38.100
we are doing our job wrong.

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:40.210
Because they are
going to use it.

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:42.100
They're going to enjoy it.

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:44.550
They're going to learn
things by using PlayKids.

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:46.530
So they are our user.

00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:48.300
Our customer is the parent.

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:50.430
You have to convince
the parents to keep

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:51.730
subscribing to our service.

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:54.120
But they have to
trust us that we

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:58.500
created a real good experience
to their little ones.

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.420
Just an example on PlayKids.

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:04.060
Just one week before we launched
the version 1 [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:11.530
PlayKids, we designed
the app to stream video.

00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:14.310
We with the streamed
video instead of download.

00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:17.490
And we brought some
kids to the office.

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:20.490
And we gave them the app
for them to interact with.

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:22.260
And we did all the setup.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.270
I don't know if you already
have [INAUDIBLE] with kids.

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:27.760
But nothing happens as
the way you expected.

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:29.820
Because you have all this setup.

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:31.440
And we brought the kids.

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:36.720
And they tapped to watch
a video, and the spinner,

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:37.590
loading.

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:40.620
The kids just put the
tablet away and just started

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:41.670
playing with another toy.

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:44.430
So by that moment,
we knew we have

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:45.900
to design with the kid in mind.

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:48.620
So just one week
before launching,

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:54.780
we said we are not going to have
a stream as the full version.

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:57.930
As a standard of PlayKids, we
are going to have the download.

00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:01.260
And while we are
downloading, we created games

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:05.520
so kids could watch videos.

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:09.270
While they download a video,
they can play some games.

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:11.790
And they come back
and watch the videos

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:13.340
when it is finished, and so on.

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:15.240
So we design for kids.

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:18.090
And every little detail is
very important for them.

00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:20.580
They expect everything
to be interactive.

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:23.840
And everything-- every detail
detail of PlayKids is you

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:26.520
can tap, and you
expect an animation.

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:30.210
And in the end of the
day, if you are not

00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:33.390
creating a good product--
a good toy for the kids--

00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:36.630
why would the parent
care about it?

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:40.290
If the kids don't like it,
why would someone buy it?

00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:43.890
We also have learned
during all the way

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:46.350
some themes that kids
like, such as music

00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:48.960
telling about ABC songs.

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:51.240
They're telling
about basic stuff

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:53.150
and learning basic things.

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:55.350
And some craft
classes-- learning

00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:59.570
how to fold origami or
something like that.

00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:03.720
And some animal songs that
would place some animals

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:06.510
in some [? topics ?]
like bullying or lying

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:07.560
and something like that.

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:12.210
So we learned with our data,
and then with some tests, what

00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:14.700
kids would love to
see, and then started

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:16.560
creating our own content.

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:18.340
And we brought this
to the platform.

00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:20.760
So we brought it to
the PlayKids so parents

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:24.390
could see that there's someone
behind this thinking about how

00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:26.250
to well treat their kids.

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:30.030
And this is adding value
to the platform as well.

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:34.950
And we have over 50 episodes
of our original content,

00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:38.970
with over 100 million
views already.

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:43.530
And just for comparison,
what we understood

00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:47.250
is that, by understanding the
kids and using some metrics,

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:51.210
we could create some episodes
that were engaging more-- kids

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:54.600
were watching more and more
and more than some other ones

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:56.070
like this place.

00:11:56.070 --> 00:12:02.760
You can compare ABC episode
with the Backyardigan ones.

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:06.840
Kids were watching more and
replaying it more and more.

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:08.790
Another thing that
we have talked here

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:13.260
already is we created
special collections.

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:16.560
And this is very important
across all our apps.

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:18.750
Our books app has
special collections

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:21.270
for special dates
such as the Halloween,

00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:24.920
or the Easter, back
to school, or summer.

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:30.180
And our PlayKids TV app
has some special train cars

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:32.280
that have some videos
for those dates.

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:35.250
And this is really
important because kids,

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:37.560
they are in the school,
or they have some friends,

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:38.730
and they're talking
about the things.

00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:40.530
Oh, oh, what is your
costume for Halloween?

00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:42.480
Oh, we're going back to school.

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:45.487
And this is a real link
from the offline world

00:12:45.487 --> 00:12:46.320
to the online world.

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:51.560
So when a kid sees this,
he likes it, she likes it.

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:54.670
And the parent
expects this as well.

00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:58.610
We also adapt our icon
to those special dates,

00:12:58.610 --> 00:12:59.880
as we talked before.

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:01.800
Actually, we talked a
lot about icons today.

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:05.310
It was a great lesson.

00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:09.140
This other thing that we
do is social media buzz.

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:12.600
Every new launch that we
have, every new episode,

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:16.790
or every new feature, we try
to push on the channels that

00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:18.630
reach the parents
for the parents

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:22.740
to know that we are caring about
it, updating, bringing content,

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:25.470
and making their service alive.

00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:28.200
So they're investing
money every month in it.

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:31.540
And we're telling them that
you're in a safe place,

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:33.520
we're creating a
great app for kids,

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:36.960
and the service is evolving.

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:40.810
We treat our subscribers,
as well, in a different way.

00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:43.950
We have a really detailed
customer journey.

00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:49.240
And to sum up, we
have four states here.

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:52.410
When someone enters on
PlayKids as a new user,

00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:55.710
and then we give a seven-day
free trial so the user

00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:58.050
can try PlayKids for free.

00:13:58.050 --> 00:14:03.000
And then she becomes
an active subscriber.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.160
And then if she cancels
or has some error,

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:10.980
and if she churns-- we
call this user churn.

00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:14.790
And each of these phases,
we have a different message

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:16.410
through a different channel.

00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:21.030
Or we send emails telling
about the subscription's over.

00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:23.820
Or during the period, we
send emails telling you

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:26.580
what is going on and
what's new on PlayKids.

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:28.510
Or we send a push
notification telling

00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:31.140
them there's some billing
problem, and so on.

00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:33.900
So this is very
important because this

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:36.810
is a way to recover
people that have churned.

00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:40.250
And you have to reconvince
parents for them

00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:43.620
to go back to the service.

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:48.150
And it's a good way also to
make parents know that you

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:49.290
are evolving the product.

00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:51.960
So the app is a
channel for a kid.

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:54.630
And you have to think
and figure out ways

00:14:54.630 --> 00:15:00.450
to reach the parents outside.

00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:02.520
We also run a lot of icon tests.

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:06.360
And as we talked today, we
have to do some experiments,

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:09.510
because it drives
a lot of results.

00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:12.590
The last one is the
most successful icon

00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:15.270
ever on PlayKids.

00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:22.620
It drove a lot of traction,
a lot of user downloads.

00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:27.060
And we use the Google
Developer Console experience

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:28.920
to try these new things.

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:33.570
We also try some
screenshots experiments

00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:38.850
to see which message
conveys better to the parent

00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:40.830
compared to another one.

00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:45.080
What should be the two first
screenshots of the store?

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:46.860
What should be the description?

00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:48.090
What should be the icons?

00:15:48.090 --> 00:15:49.530
So we can test it.

00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:55.020
And then, as we learn
it, we can spread this

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:59.430
into all the platforms as well.

00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:06.970
And the bottom line on all
of this is parents care a lot

00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:11.820
on what their kids are
playing, what their kids are

00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:15.390
learning from playing.

00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:16.950
And the first thing
that we learned

00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:19.710
is that you have
to design for kids.

00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:20.700
It's mandatory.

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:23.580
You have to create a great
product with great content that

00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:25.650
makes sense for kids.

00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:29.650
And then we have to keep
your service always updated.

00:16:29.650 --> 00:16:34.280
And there is a difference
from thinking of app

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:36.240
and thinking of service.

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:40.950
You have to think that your
app is a way to communicate

00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:43.040
within your service.

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:45.330
As you have this in mind,
you can reach parents

00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:49.650
in another way so you can
communicate properly with them

00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:53.340
and show all the
value of your product.

00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:58.140
And making various constant
updates, as well make

00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:00.930
it look local with
local content,

00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:05.760
and localization as well,
and all the things that

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:07.619
makes the content feel local.

00:17:07.619 --> 00:17:09.900
Like if you use
PlayKids in Brazil,

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:12.599
it looks like there's
a Brazilian app.

00:17:12.599 --> 00:17:17.329
But if you use it in the US,
there's a voiceover in English.

00:17:17.329 --> 00:17:19.920
There is all the content
that is very now in the US.

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:22.740
If you go to Spain,
it's all in Spanish,

00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:25.440
and it has all the
voiceovers, all the characters

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:28.252
are speaking Spanish, and so on.

00:17:28.252 --> 00:17:31.110
And you have to properly
communicate with the parents.

00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:35.650
You have to send a right message
to the right state of the user

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:36.422
engagement.

00:17:36.422 --> 00:17:39.700
It does not make sense
to change a message

00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:42.060
to convince a parent to
subscribe to your service

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:45.120
if he is already or she's
already a subscriber.

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:47.830
And you have to put your own
personality in the service.

00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:50.940
Or by creating our own
content like we did.

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:53.250
We created our own characters.

00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:55.440
We created our own shows.

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:58.410
And we put it on TV.

00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:00.825
But parents always
expect their kids

00:18:00.825 --> 00:18:02.850
to learn from what
they are doing.

00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:06.350
And they are very proud on this.

00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:09.330
And so these are
some of the points

00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:14.130
that we're working on PlayKids
to make more clear to parents

00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:18.930
that we are a service, and
that our service is always

00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:20.190
being updated.

00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:23.700
So I hope this can
be useful for you.

00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:26.400
We learned a lot
in this journey.

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:28.860
And keep creating
great apps for kids.

00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:30.900
And keep making them smile.

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:33.260
So thank you.
