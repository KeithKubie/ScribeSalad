00:00:24.298 --> 00:00:27.048
(peaceful music)

00:00:45.394 --> 00:00:47.640
- Welcome to a Conversation with History.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.800
I'm Harry Kreisler of

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.650
the Institute of International Studies.

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.840
Our guest today is Laura d'Andrea Tyson

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.110
who is professor of business
administration and economics

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.940
and director of the Institute for Business

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.280
and Social Impact at the
Haas School of Business.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.760
She is a former chairman of the
Council of Economic Advisors

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.230
in the Clinton administration.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.910
Laura served as dean of the Haas School

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.050
and of the London Business School.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:21.050
Professor Tyson is the 2015
Harvest Distinguished Lecturer.

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.970
This is a series which features women

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.040
from a broad range of
disciplines and cultures.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.340
It offers a forum to
foster thoughtful dialogue

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.347
and an opportunity to be inspired

00:01:33.347 --> 00:01:38.347
by outstanding and accomplished
real world women leaders.

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.550
Laura, welcome back to our program.

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:41.580
- Thank you, Harry.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.073
- [Harry] What attracted you to economics?

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.530
- You know, I discovered economics.

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.530
I was pretty good at math at high school.

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.360
I went to college thinking I'd do math,

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.730
which is pretty rare
for a girl at the time.

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:57.164
And I went to a woman's college.

00:01:57.164 --> 00:02:00.447
Took a class in economics
and instantly realized

00:02:00.447 --> 00:02:01.800
that's what I wanted to do.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.600
Because I wanted to do
something that was rigorous

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.360
where I could use analysis and math.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.120
But that addressed policy problems.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.140
'Cause I actually had always been

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.010
interested in those, as well.

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.843
Even in high school.

00:02:15.843 --> 00:02:18.470
So, it was a wonderful combination.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.427
- And, looking back,
what factors in your life

00:02:21.427 --> 00:02:26.427
influenced your commitment
to progressive values?

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.380
Which is, I think, a fair assessment

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.150
of where you fall on the spectrum.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.143
- Yes, and I'm not entirely
sure I can link, trace it.

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:41.440
I mean, part of it, I suppose, is that

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.440
my parents were raised poor
in Jersey City and Bayonne.

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.170
My father was...

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.988
His life was very much
shaped by the GI Bill.

00:02:50.988 --> 00:02:53.610
So, they're rising into the middle class.

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.170
He's the first person in his family,

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.485
extended Italian family, to go to college.

00:02:58.485 --> 00:03:02.470
Emphasis on education
from the very beginning.

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.340
I suspect the nuns in Catholic school

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.699
may have a little to do
with my progressive values.

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:10.400
Taking care of the disadvantaged

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.210
and paying attention to equity concerns

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.720
and the concerns of
others clearly, I think,

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.083
was something you got in Catholic school.

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.630
And then I gradually,
as I went to college,

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.710
began to study history and
study political science.

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:27.980
And realized that the values that I had

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.100
were what I guess we call
now progressive values.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.720
Maybe we call them liberal values.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.093
I don't know.

00:03:34.093 --> 00:03:39.093
- And has it been difficult to reconcile

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.560
the discipline, essentially
what the numbers say,

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.127
if I can make a short
version of economics,

00:03:46.127 --> 00:03:48.200
and where the values lead?

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.520
I mean, in other words...

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.950
Or is that really about
defining the problems

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.360
you wanna look at?

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.190
- So, my colleague at the
Council of Economic Advisors

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.030
who was also a classmate of
mine at MIT, Alan Blinder,

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.610
wrote a very good book about 25 years ago.

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:05.590
Maybe 30 years ago.

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.160
And he's actually in the
process of revising it.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.250
It's called Hard Heads, Soft Hearts.

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.790
And basically he says,
"Economists have hard heads.

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.950
They wanna figure out the
best way to do something.

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:17.370
The most efficient way to do something.

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.200
The least costly way to do something.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.930
But they can certainly have soft hearts."

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.370
That is, what's the best way to provide

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.330
early childhood education
for disadvantaged families?

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.330
What's the best way to provide
employment opportunities

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.010
for high school dropouts?

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:39.500
So, you can be committed to the values

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.680
and then say what's the best way?

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.960
So, I think there's a natural combination.

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.240
- And the interface must be important,

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.530
because the economics must bring rigor

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.800
to where your heart wants to go.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.370
- So, I think that's
the hard head concept.

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.120
These things are not...

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.050
Doing these things are very difficult.

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.370
Some ways are more effective than others.

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:02.630
Some ways don't work at all.

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:03.932
Some things that sound good,

00:05:03.932 --> 00:05:06.330
it turns out, when you
actually look at the evidence,

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:07.180
don't really work.

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.410
So, you have to say I'm
committed to my values.

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:12.550
I'm committed to my goal.

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.110
I want to do this.

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.110
Let me look analytically about

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.370
the best ways to achieve this.

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.287
And I think that's what
the rigor of the discipline

00:05:21.287 --> 00:05:23.453
forces you to do.

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:29.380
- Now, what about the leap from
economics to public policy?

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.560
'Cause there's an interface
there that's challenging.

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.220
- [Laura] Yes, yes.

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:40.060
- Talk a little about the
adaption that has to take place,

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:41.860
if that's the right word.

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.260
- You know, Berkeley
was very important to me

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:49.260
in terms of my preparation
for a role in public policy.

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:51.660
With some of my colleagues at the time,

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:56.520
we got interested in US economic
competitiveness and trade.

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.440
We started something that you know about

00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:59.700
called the Berkeley Round Table

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.310
on the International Economy.

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:05.750
We started to deal with policy
makers and business leaders.

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:07.840
Trying to give advice about

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.070
how to make the US more competitive,

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:12.090
how to raise productivity,

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:14.670
what a trade agreement should look like.

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:18.750
So, gradually, slowly,
over a decade, I would say,

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:22.063
I started to have those
kinds of interactions.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:27.010
I was not like many of my colleagues

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:28.500
in the Clinton
administration who had spent

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.550
most of their life in politics

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:34.356
aiming to be a policy
maker at the highest level.

00:06:34.356 --> 00:06:37.620
I had really spent my
life in academic circles,

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:39.270
but in advisory capacities.

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:40.690
On commissions, things like that.

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:42.220
Writing commission reports.

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:44.022
So, it was really surprise

00:06:44.022 --> 00:06:49.022
and a great stroke of luck, really,

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:51.910
that I ended up in the
position that I ended up in.

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:53.340
I mean, my work was known.

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:56.250
It was known to the
President-Elect Bill Clinton.

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:58.143
He knew about my academic work.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:03.400
But I still was thrown into an environment

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:06.810
where I didn't quite know all the rules.

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:09.270
I said then, and I think it's true,

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:11.540
that being an economist,

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:15.350
but being an economist who
could explain things clearly

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:16.800
to large groups of...

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:19.280
To 900 sophomores and
freshmen at Berkeley.

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:21.474
If I could explain economics to them,

00:07:21.474 --> 00:07:24.850
I should be able to
explain it to the public,

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:27.280
to policy makers, to members of Congress.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:31.100
So, I was viewed as someone
who could be very articulate

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:35.450
and helpful in both designing policy,

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:40.190
but also explaining it and
making people understand

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:42.170
why this was the right thing to do.

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:45.373
Came from my academic, my
life at Berkeley, I must say.

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:49.480
- At this point, I like to ask my guests

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:53.800
about what they see is
the skills and temperament

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.680
involved in the discipline.

00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:00.680
So, in your case, what
do you see as important,

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:04.890
in that regard, with regard to economics,

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:06.613
but also public policy?

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:11.507
- So, for economics, I
would say I clearly have...

00:08:13.107 --> 00:08:16.390
I guess I would say I suggest I have

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:19.290
a fairly analytical
approach to problem solving.

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:21.242
Somehow or other, I was born with that.

00:08:21.242 --> 00:08:24.500
It got nurtured over time.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:26.060
That's really important.

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:31.060
I think I've been open in economics

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:33.130
to different ways of thinking.

00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:35.190
So, I did a lot of work in

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:37.320
comparative economics at one point.

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:41.740
I have a general view of skepticism.

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:45.800
Like we don't know the
answers and no model is right,

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.920
but we can get better.

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:51.760
I used to say that served
me well in public policy,

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:54.970
because a lot of people
feel like "Here's the answer

00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:56.570
and I'm gonna do everything I can

00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:57.930
to get straight to the answer.

00:08:57.930 --> 00:08:59.300
Because I believe in my answer.

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:01.996
And, frankly, I don't
believe in any compromises."

00:09:01.996 --> 00:09:03.630
That's not gonna work.

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:06.880
So, my view is, "Okay, you
kinda know where you wanna go

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:10.270
and you may have to kind
of go slowly with zig zags.

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:11.750
As long as you're not going backwards.

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:12.950
You're going forwards."

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:17.610
But willingness to kind
of see room for compromise

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:22.610
or room for going slowly,
seeing a different perspective.

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:26.538
I think I temperamentally have that.

00:09:26.538 --> 00:09:29.770
And that's actually been really important

00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:32.990
in both economics and in public policy.

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:37.990
I mean, finally, I
apparently have the ability

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:43.470
to take complex things
and make them simple.

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:46.120
And, actually, people said that,

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:49.510
when I would do an
economics paper or lecture

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:51.339
to what I would do in
public policy session

00:09:51.339 --> 00:09:53.400
to when I would do a lecture for students.

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.320
So, I think that is a skill.

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:59.120
Because, if you're
explaining complex concepts

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:02.040
and complicated solutions to people

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:05.320
who are not trained in your discipline,

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:10.320
then you are trying to bring them along

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:14.410
to see an outcome which you
believe is the best outcome.

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:17.140
But, you know, we live in a democracy.

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:19.620
We live in a situation where
you don't impose your views.

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:22.020
You convince people of your views.

00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:24.610
- That view is atypical, isn't it?

00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:28.100
Because, in the disciplines,

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:30.350
it's really about talking
to your colleagues.

00:10:31.298 --> 00:10:32.743
Is that fair?

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:35.920
- Well, I don't think
I was very traditional

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:36.760
in that respect.

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:37.670
I really don't.

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:38.930
I think that I...

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:40.980
- No, I'm noting that.

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:45.620
- No, no, no, I would say,

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:50.430
in the first decade of
my professional life

00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:54.360
as an academic economist,
I did the right things.

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:58.290
I wrote papers for my specialty.

00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:01.072
I went to conferences for my specialty.

00:11:01.072 --> 00:11:03.801
I taught classes in my specialty.

00:11:03.801 --> 00:11:06.923
Very complicated PhD classes.

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:10.050
I did that.

00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:11.310
It was interesting to me.

00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:14.440
But I really felt it was too constraining.

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:15.640
Too restrictive.

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:17.210
So, it gradually...

00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:18.880
It didn't happen overnight.

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:22.250
I started to say, "No, the
things that actually interest me

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:25.110
from a point of view of my own sighting

00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:27.370
which I live in making things better

00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:29.850
are a different set of issues.

00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:33.530
And a different set of people
are having this conversation.

00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:36.460
Not my academic colleagues."

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:38.640
So, I would say there
was a period of time...

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.280
And, again, I would say it's kind of like

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:42.220
a decade long process.

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:47.220
When I, at Berkeley, found
similarly inclined colleagues.

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:51.200
Berkeley has a wonderful tradition

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:56.013
of allowing people to work
across disciplinary lines,

00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:58.470
if they want.

00:11:58.470 --> 00:12:00.230
And that's really what I started to do.

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:02.230
In fact, I started to co-teach a class

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:04.230
with a political scientist.

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:05.670
Pretty rare.

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:07.450
I started to do a little more teaching

00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:10.560
in the business school and out
of my economics discipline,

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:12.170
because business school curricula

00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:17.170
is more related to public
policy or application problems.

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:20.240
So, I gradually made this transition.

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:23.770
- And you're saying that
communication skills

00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:27.070
and writing skills have
been very important to you.

00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:29.890
Where did you learn to write well?

00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:31.880
- Well, I don't know.

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:36.873
I decided, again, in the early 1980s...

00:12:36.873 --> 00:12:39.200
I date all of this pretty well,

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:40.950
because this was a period of time where

00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:44.580
I was teaching very large
econ one classes at Berkeley,

00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:46.840
when my son was born,

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:50.150
and when the Berkeley Round
Table was being formed.

00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:52.050
So, all of these things were signs

00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:54.630
of real change in my own life.

00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:56.640
And what I wanted to do at the time,

00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:59.020
I thought, "You know, I'm clearly...

00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:01.960
I'm involved in writing
these commission reports.

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:03.670
I'm involved in going to conferences.

00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:06.650
I really should try to write something

00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:08.730
of an opinion column sort

00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:12.260
to get my thoughts out to the
public in a different way."

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.620
And so, I started to do that.

00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:17.690
I've done it over the decades since

00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:20.990
for the LA Times and Business
Week and the New York Times

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:22.240
and the Financial Times.

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:24.193
And I'm currently doing something for

00:13:24.193 --> 00:13:28.610
a blog site called Project Syndicate,

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:30.860
which has economists
and political scientists

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:32.060
from all over the world.

00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:34.470
And they place them in
newspapers all over the world.

00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:37.230
So, I would not say that

00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:39.430
writing is easy for me, however, Harry.

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:41.360
I think it's actually hard for me.

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:45.000
And I spend a lot of time
on each of my columns.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.150
Probably much...

00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:47.510
I could not be a columnist.

00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:48.390
If I were a columnist

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:49.810
and I had to write something every day,

00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:52.280
I'm not sure I could get
out of the house any day.

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:56.560
So, I think that I'm clear in my writing

00:13:56.560 --> 00:14:00.410
and I think that I rely a
lot on facts and analysis.

00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:03.530
My columns tend to be
analytical and fact-based,

00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:04.863
rather than just opinion.

00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:07.230
I think it's important.

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:08.400
I think it's important to do.

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:10.618
I don't actually really enjoy doing them.

00:14:10.618 --> 00:14:11.980
(laughter)

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:12.813
A confession.

00:14:12.813 --> 00:14:14.620
- I've read many of them.

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:17.630
You're doing a very good
job of informing people

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:21.100
and helping people who don't
have an economics background

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:22.083
to understand.

00:14:22.083 --> 00:14:24.090
Talk a little about Washington.

00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:27.223
What surprised you most
when you went to Washington?

00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:28.903
- Well, first of all,

00:14:28.903 --> 00:14:30.300
a couple of things come to mind, I guess.

00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:34.878
First of all, when I first
started to testify in Congress,

00:14:34.878 --> 00:14:37.720
which I had to do in my role as

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:40.680
the chair of the Council
of Economic Advisors,

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:43.551
what I thought was, "Well, I can go

00:14:43.551 --> 00:14:48.270
and use evidence and logic
and my skills as an economist

00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:51.840
to convince this committee that

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:56.650
what we're doing in the Clinton
administration is correct."

00:14:56.650 --> 00:14:59.960
And, after going many times

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:02.970
and realizing that that was not happening,

00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:04.987
I did realize what people said to me.

00:15:04.987 --> 00:15:08.660
"No, no, this is a kind
of political theater.

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:10.540
You go and make your statement.

00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:11.990
You have to do this.

00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:13.810
Everyone else makes their statement.

00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:18.740
There's very little
real exchange of ideas."

00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:22.330
The exchange of ideas probably
goes on behind the scenes

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:23.350
with the staff.

00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:26.870
So, there's very, very
talented young people

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:28.560
who staff the senators

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:30.570
and House of Representative congressmen

00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:32.040
and all of the committees.

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:34.680
And they are doing real work.

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:39.680
But the hearings
themselves where I would go

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:42.430
into a lecture situation historically

00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:44.300
and feel like, "Oh, I can convince people.

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:45.800
I can educate people.

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:48.130
I'm imparting real information here.

00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:49.522
It's not a performance."

00:15:49.522 --> 00:15:53.660
I felt that a lot of what I
ended up doing on the Hill

00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:55.870
was a bit of performance art.

00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:58.063
That was a surprise.

00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:00.820
I also figured out...

00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:05.693
And this was a little related
to the issue of gender.

00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:08.930
When I first got to the White House,

00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:10.500
I had a very high level position.

00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:12.190
But, even in the White House,

00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:13.360
you have a high level position,

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:14.770
that doesn't necessarily mean that

00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:16.810
you're gonna be invited
to the right meetings.

00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:18.120
It doesn't.

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:21.320
So, at a certain point,
I started to feel like

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:24.080
the Council of Economic Advisors
should be in this meeting.

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:27.440
So, I need to go and make a
request to be in the meeting.

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:28.820
And that was very hard for me.

00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:29.653
But I did it.

00:16:29.653 --> 00:16:31.160
I represented my institution.

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:31.993
We're economists.

00:16:31.993 --> 00:16:33.230
We must be at this meeting.

00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:35.880
And I was told at the
time "That's fine, Laura.

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:40.380
You don't realize how
many men have come in here

00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:41.500
and asked for that.

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:42.860
And they get it.

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:45.050
And you took a while to do it,

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:47.560
but you realized that
you needed to do it."

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:50.460
So, that was like, well,
that's a rule I didn't know.

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:52.890
An unwritten rule, whoa.

00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:56.217
So, I got better at saying,

00:16:56.217 --> 00:16:58.220
"Okay, who should be in the room?

00:16:58.220 --> 00:16:59.160
We should be in the room."

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:01.600
And then making a point
of being in the room.

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:03.670
And I didn't get any pushback.

00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:05.939
But it's sort of like you have to do that.

00:17:05.939 --> 00:17:07.850
You have to take the first step.

00:17:07.850 --> 00:17:11.850
So, a lot of the evidence about
women in large organizations

00:17:11.850 --> 00:17:16.060
is women don't negotiate for positions.

00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:17.037
They don't go in and say,

00:17:17.037 --> 00:17:18.600
"Hey, I would be great for that job.

00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:19.690
Think of me."

00:17:19.690 --> 00:17:24.629
They hold back a little bit
and wait to be discovered.

00:17:24.629 --> 00:17:27.476
That doesn't work in politics.

00:17:27.476 --> 00:17:30.180
It doesn't work in organizations, either.

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:34.870
- Looking back at your time
in the Clinton administration,

00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:39.656
and we know about the events that occurred

00:17:39.656 --> 00:17:42.703
after you all had been out
of office for many years...

00:17:42.703 --> 00:17:46.800
I'm talking about the
economic crisis of 2008.

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:51.800
As you reflect back, do you
have any reflections or thoughts

00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:57.550
about what things that might
have been done differently?

00:17:58.630 --> 00:18:00.080
- I think the first term...

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:01.670
And I was only there for the first term.

00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:04.600
And it's important in terms
of telling that story, also,

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:07.660
to note on the side, as I
said in the Harvest Lecture.

00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:11.320
After four years in government,
I certainly wanted to stay.

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:14.230
But, from the family's point
of view, husband and son,

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:15.400
they didn't wanna stay.

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:17.300
And the job was a family job.

00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:19.010
It wasn't an individual job.

00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:20.300
The whole family had the job.

00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:21.630
They had it in different forms.

00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:22.730
But they had the job.

00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:24.680
- But, by that, you mean that

00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:26.120
the job was taking so much of your time.

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:28.570
- So much of my time that everything else

00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:31.500
that had to do with the work of the family

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:34.590
was secondary to me and imposed on them.

00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:36.035
And it was enough.

00:18:36.035 --> 00:18:37.640
It was really enough.

00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:39.050
There were several men,

00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:41.440
including my good friend
Bob Reich and his family,

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:43.520
who left at the same
time for the same reason.

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:48.520
So, I felt that the budget
plan was the right thing to do.

00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:51.880
And it turned out to be very important

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:54.810
from the point of view
of being the first step

00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:58.980
to getting us on the road to
a sustainable fiscal course.

00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:02.760
There was a second step in the
beginning of the second term,

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:03.710
but they were linked.

00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:05.002
They were absolutely linked.

00:19:05.002 --> 00:19:08.370
I think that the North
American Free Trade Agreement

00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:10.790
and then the completion
of the Uruguay Round,

00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:12.480
I think, were very important.

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:14.740
I know they're controversial
among the Democrats.

00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:17.230
But I think the evidence, from
the economic point of view,

00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:18.113
is positive.

00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:21.220
I regret...

00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:24.390
I think we all regret that

00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:28.400
we were not able to
move healthcare forward.

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:30.200
I think we don't...

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:32.180
The Clinton administration
doesn't regret...

00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:35.390
And I was actually a skeptic
of the welfare reform.

00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:36.810
I literally was a skeptic.

00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:38.777
I have a note from the president saying,

00:19:38.777 --> 00:19:40.874
"Thank you for your counsel.

00:19:40.874 --> 00:19:43.050
I understand your concerns.

00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:44.400
But this is what we're going to do."

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:45.233
He was right.

00:19:45.233 --> 00:19:46.220
So, I don't...

00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:49.660
But healthcare probably was obviously

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:53.330
the biggest sort of lost opportunity.

00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:55.270
The second term, however, I wasn't there.

00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:57.750
I thing the biggest lost
opportunity, by far,

00:19:57.750 --> 00:19:59.970
was social security reform.

00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:04.820
Because, as you began to see
those surpluses building up,

00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:07.690
it was pretty clear that
there were two things

00:20:07.690 --> 00:20:08.940
that might happen.

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:12.240
There would either be a tax cut,

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:16.500
which is what George W. Bush
decided to do with that money,

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:19.620
or there would be a social security reform

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:23.700
that would essentially use
that money for social security.

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:27.568
And the second term
Clinton administration,

00:20:27.568 --> 00:20:31.790
it was not possible, in a
way, to move in that direction

00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:34.030
because of all of the
other things going on

00:20:34.030 --> 00:20:36.850
around the presidency at that time.

00:20:36.850 --> 00:20:38.570
And I think, from an
economic point of view,

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:40.990
that's a tremendous loss.

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:44.880
- In the second term, did
the administration go too far

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:46.733
in terms of deregulation?

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:52.400
- It's possible that, at the...

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:54.410
It was towards the very end.

00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:55.570
I think that...

00:20:57.230 --> 00:21:01.510
It was a moment in time when
the economy was doing so well.

00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:03.270
Productivity was so high.

00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:05.760
There was a kind of love of technology.

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:09.350
Technology was transforming
the retail sector,

00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:11.640
the wholesale sector, but
also the financial sector.

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:15.730
The financial sector's ability to develop

00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:18.200
intricate new products,
financial engineering,

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:21.970
risk management, that
was all just exploding.

00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:24.720
Frankly, no one really
completely understood it.

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:28.397
I remember I had Alan Greenspan
come to the Haas School

00:21:28.397 --> 00:21:31.310
when I first became dean in 1998.

00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:33.597
And he actually said to me,

00:21:33.597 --> 00:21:37.000
"It's like having a really fancy new car.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.400
You open up the hood and you
don't know what's going on."

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:41.770
That's Alan Greenspan.

00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:44.470
Okay, so, that was the situation.

00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:47.590
And there was a kind of
sense in my profession,

00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:52.244
among financial experts, that
the system is going to...

00:21:52.244 --> 00:21:54.210
One of the things it can do, in a way,

00:21:54.210 --> 00:21:58.330
we don't quite understand
is manage risk better.

00:21:58.330 --> 00:22:00.310
But, of course, my view,
even at the time...

00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:01.870
I wrote a piece about
this in Business Week.

00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:03.730
I said, "Why does one think that?

00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:06.400
Maybe it just moves the risk around

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:08.180
in ways that we can't see.

00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:10.040
And actually makes the risk bigger,

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:12.540
because, if everybody
thinks the risk is smaller,

00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:14.050
they're gonna take riskier actions."

00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:15.920
It's almost like it's self-fulfilling.

00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:17.950
If I believe the system is less risky,

00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:20.580
hey, I can personally be pretty risky.

00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:22.160
So, there was...

00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:27.560
The administration was
certainly not alone in its view

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:30.270
that the financial markets were becoming

00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:33.720
so sophisticated that they
could regulate themselves

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:36.680
in ways which we didn't quite understand.

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:38.390
That turned out to be wrong.

00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:39.320
- It's interesting.

00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:41.810
Because you were influential,

00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:43.300
having been in the administration.

00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:44.218
You wrote a piece.

00:22:44.218 --> 00:22:49.218
Why were the majority of
powerful people in Washington

00:22:51.992 --> 00:22:54.238
not listening to you?

00:22:54.238 --> 00:22:57.420
Which is not to say you were
the only one saying that.

00:22:57.420 --> 00:22:59.870
Is it just the herd instinct?

00:22:59.870 --> 00:23:03.800
- I think that that was not
the conventional wisdom,

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:07.513
the herd instinct, the
dominant paradigm at the time.

00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:13.390
As reflected in having
Bob Rubin, Larry Summers,

00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:15.870
and Alan Greenspan on the
cover, I guess it was of Time.

00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:17.200
Master of the Universe.

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:19.757
The dominant view of the time was

00:23:19.757 --> 00:23:23.480
"Boy, financial markets
have become more stable.

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:25.050
We're more sophisticated.

00:23:25.050 --> 00:23:29.980
There's more ways for the
system to manage risk.

00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:32.920
Therefore, we don't need
to do as much regulation."

00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:35.650
There was another point of view
at the same time out there,

00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:40.650
which is US financial institutions
are competing globally.

00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:42.580
They need to compete globally.

00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:44.370
We don't want to restrict them

00:23:44.370 --> 00:23:47.790
in ways which disadvantage them
in this global competition.

00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:49.743
So, there was another thing going on.

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:53.530
So, occasionally, voices
would be raised of concern,

00:23:53.530 --> 00:23:58.060
but it really was not the
dominant view at the time.

00:23:58.060 --> 00:23:59.470
- Now you are an observer.

00:23:59.470 --> 00:24:01.336
- [Laura] You learn from your mistakes.

00:24:01.336 --> 00:24:02.450
- Hopefully.

00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:04.770
- I think a lot has been learned.

00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:07.920
I recently did a book...

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:11.550
The last interview with Timothy
Geithner on his book tour.

00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:14.035
And I just said to the audience,

00:24:14.035 --> 00:24:17.310
"There is so much in this book

00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:20.250
which really reflects what has been done,

00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:22.620
which is very significant, and, of course,

00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:24.300
also indicates some of the things that

00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:25.300
still need to be done."

00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:28.160
For example, we have not, in any way,

00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:30.850
in the United States, dealt
with the housing market.

00:24:30.850 --> 00:24:31.890
We have...

00:24:31.890 --> 00:24:34.120
Most of the mortgages are coming
through Fannie and Freddie.

00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:35.328
Government institutions.

00:24:35.328 --> 00:24:39.470
We don't have that part of the
financial market worked out.

00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:41.030
We've put it on hold.

00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:44.030
We've put it on hold while we
sort of did some other things.

00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:48.153
- You're an observer now here at Haas.

00:24:49.090 --> 00:24:54.090
And I wanna ask you, comparing
the Clinton presidency

00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:56.768
and the Obama presidency,

00:24:56.768 --> 00:25:00.710
what do you see, how has
the environment changed?

00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:02.710
Has it changed drastically?

00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:06.700
Or is it just more of the same
old stuff in extreme form?

00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:10.850
- Well, I think you have to
ask that question in two ways.

00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:14.520
One is internally and one is
with the rest of the world.

00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:18.160
So, internally, I think you could say

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:20.570
these are extreme versions of tendencies

00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:24.350
that were already obvious in
the Clinton administration.

00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:28.010
So, if we go back to the
budget plan in the first term,

00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:30.930
there were no Republicans
who supported that.

00:25:30.930 --> 00:25:33.801
And, indeed, they said
from the very beginning

00:25:33.801 --> 00:25:36.040
in January of the first year

00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:38.160
of President Clinton's first term.

00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:40.055
They said, "We will not
support your program."

00:25:40.055 --> 00:25:42.130
I mean, so it wasn't like there was

00:25:42.130 --> 00:25:43.610
any possibility to compromise.

00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:44.710
We will not support your program.

00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:46.230
You're gonna have to get enough Democrats

00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:47.063
to get this through.

00:25:47.063 --> 00:25:48.160
We're not gonna do it.

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:52.200
That was very similar to what Obama heard

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:54.830
in the beginning of his first term.

00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:56.050
It was much worse for him,

00:25:56.050 --> 00:25:59.630
because he had a huge financial crisis.

00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:03.320
An economic crisis,
threatening crisis right there

00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:04.990
happening in real time.

00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:07.330
It turns out, in the
Clinton administration,

00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:09.140
things were starting to get better.

00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:10.640
They had started to get better.

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:15.015
So, the magnitude of the
problem was less severe.

00:26:15.015 --> 00:26:20.015
But, also, the nasty partisan
unwillingness to compromise,

00:26:23.670 --> 00:26:27.180
unwillingness to come up
with a bipartisan plan,

00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:28.540
which you'd seen in

00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:31.570
the first term of the
Clinton administration,

00:26:31.570 --> 00:26:33.870
you certainly saw in the
Obama administration.

00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:35.770
By the way, the second term
of the Clinton administration

00:26:35.770 --> 00:26:39.150
was better because that budget deal

00:26:39.150 --> 00:26:40.700
in the beginning of the second term

00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:43.330
did get bipartisan support.

00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:44.920
So, after government shutdown...

00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:46.240
Remember the first government shutdown

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:48.580
was under the first term of
the Clinton administration.

00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:49.565
I was there.

00:26:49.565 --> 00:26:54.565
That technique, that
tactic of getting one's way

00:26:56.173 --> 00:26:59.600
was not used again until
the Obama administration.

00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:02.210
And there's even a threat, apparently,

00:27:02.210 --> 00:27:04.090
that it will be used again
at the end of this year.

00:27:04.090 --> 00:27:06.858
So, unwillingness to compromise

00:27:06.858 --> 00:27:09.860
is something that has gotten worse,

00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:14.860
because, first, the far right has gained

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:21.200
a very significant hold
over the members of Congress

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:22.550
in the Republican Party.

00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:26.260
Making it extremely difficult for

00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:29.770
Boehner and McConnell to
really move their party

00:27:29.770 --> 00:27:31.370
to any compromise position.

00:27:31.370 --> 00:27:33.150
They can barely get their party to agree

00:27:33.150 --> 00:27:34.470
on their own position.

00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:36.860
Much less a compromise position.

00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:41.620
And that just means that
there's not the ability...

00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:44.640
Who's your partner in trying
to work out a compromise?

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:45.590
Who's your partner?

00:27:46.770 --> 00:27:48.820
On the external side, I will just say that

00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:53.820
the US, we have, when Obama took office,

00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:58.673
the US was extremely
unpopular in the world.

00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:04.920
The unilateral coalition
of the willing approach

00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:07.590
had completely broken down.

00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:12.120
And, I think, the need to follow

00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:15.670
what has been a traditional
democratic instinct,

00:28:15.670 --> 00:28:18.700
which is use multilateral institutions

00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:23.700
and agreements with allies that

00:28:24.010 --> 00:28:26.290
are worked out at the beginning
to get something done,

00:28:26.290 --> 00:28:30.450
that's a different
approach to foreign policy.

00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:32.260
A different approach to foreign policy.

00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:36.063
- In the context of these
changes in the political system,

00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:40.370
as someone who's on the progressive side,

00:28:40.370 --> 00:28:43.493
what do you then see is
the role of government?

00:28:43.493 --> 00:28:47.960
What is possible in such an environment?

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:51.480
- So, a couple of things
are interesting here.

00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:55.100
I think you saw some of
this in the last election.

00:28:55.100 --> 00:29:00.030
Although the country
significantly swung to the right

00:29:00.030 --> 00:29:03.280
or appeared to in who they elected,

00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:06.680
if you actually looked at what
people thought about things,

00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:10.370
like the minimum wage or social security

00:29:10.370 --> 00:29:12.720
or early childhood education

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:15.884
or equity in educational opportunities,

00:29:15.884 --> 00:29:19.210
most people support those things.

00:29:19.210 --> 00:29:22.000
Actually are ardent
supporters of those things.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.740
Okay, so, the kind of progressive values,

00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:29.189
as reflected in things people care about,

00:29:29.189 --> 00:29:32.340
are still very present
among American voters.

00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:37.340
So, but the people that are
being elected into Congress

00:29:39.048 --> 00:29:41.440
are not as reflective.

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:43.730
Now, that's partly to
do with gerrymandering

00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:47.140
and the way elections are
run in the United States.

00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:49.510
The role of money and the
role of gerrymandering.

00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:50.970
So, the people who are elected

00:29:50.970 --> 00:29:53.116
don't necessarily reflect
these views at all.

00:29:53.116 --> 00:29:55.333
It's something else going on.

00:29:56.510 --> 00:30:00.760
And then I would say another
thing that is true is that,

00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:04.530
at state and local government levels,

00:30:04.530 --> 00:30:06.390
some really interesting
things are going on

00:30:06.390 --> 00:30:08.750
in some rather red states.

00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:12.750
So, Utah's doing some
really interesting things

00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:14.280
in early childhood education.

00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:17.720
Tennessee is doing amazing
things in community college.

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:21.130
Kentucky is doing amazing
things in healthcare.

00:30:21.130 --> 00:30:24.818
Using, working with Obamacare to achieve

00:30:24.818 --> 00:30:27.910
dramatic improvements in healthcare.

00:30:27.910 --> 00:30:31.280
So, let's say, for a while,

00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:33.260
for reasons of money in politics

00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:35.730
and gerrymandering and who
wants to run for office

00:30:35.730 --> 00:30:38.050
at the level of Congress
in the United States,

00:30:38.050 --> 00:30:40.140
Congress is the, I would say,

00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:42.570
the broken organization of government.

00:30:42.570 --> 00:30:44.773
And I would say that we're seeing

00:30:44.773 --> 00:30:49.750
a lot of signs at the state
and local levels that...

00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:50.583
Not all states.

00:30:50.583 --> 00:30:52.500
I mean, clearly, there
are some states that

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:55.890
are absolutely walking away from

00:30:55.890 --> 00:30:57.830
the kinds of social policy
we're talking about.

00:30:57.830 --> 00:31:00.166
But lots of states, including
ones you wouldn't predict,

00:31:00.166 --> 00:31:01.620
are embracing it.

00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:02.810
And why are they doing that?

00:31:02.810 --> 00:31:06.090
Because that's what
their populations want.

00:31:06.090 --> 00:31:09.570
So, what happens at the federal level?

00:31:09.570 --> 00:31:13.233
You know, I guess a
disappointment to me was,

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:16.150
if you think about the
rise of the Tea Party,

00:31:16.150 --> 00:31:17.780
the rise of the Tea Party was

00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:21.270
a bunch of disgruntled
voters who got together

00:31:21.270 --> 00:31:23.970
and formed a political organization

00:31:23.970 --> 00:31:27.010
and then influenced electoral outcomes.

00:31:27.010 --> 00:31:30.350
What did the 99% do?

00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:31.410
Didn't do any of that.

00:31:31.410 --> 00:31:32.730
They protested.

00:31:32.730 --> 00:31:33.610
They protested.

00:31:33.610 --> 00:31:34.624
They wrote some things.

00:31:34.624 --> 00:31:35.960
And they dissipated.

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:39.390
No effort to run candidates,
to influence elections,

00:31:39.390 --> 00:31:40.955
to come up with a policy.

00:31:40.955 --> 00:31:44.500
Sooner or later, the only
way to change Washington

00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:45.963
is to change who goes there.

00:31:45.963 --> 00:31:47.950
That's the only way to do it.

00:31:47.950 --> 00:31:50.790
And you have to be politically
mobilized to do that.

00:31:50.790 --> 00:31:54.330
- In one of your columns, you argued about

00:31:54.330 --> 00:31:57.370
the possibilities of perceiving government

00:31:57.370 --> 00:31:59.780
as almost like a venture capitalist.

00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:02.220
And that follows from what you just said.

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:03.280
Talk a little about that.

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:08.280
- So, one of the unremarked
innovations, I would say,

00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:10.900
in the Obama administration...

00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:13.200
And I think this will just grow over time.

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:15.162
Is to set up an office of...

00:32:15.162 --> 00:32:18.320
Basically it was called something like

00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:20.970
civic engagement and social innovation.

00:32:20.970 --> 00:32:22.940
And it was actually sat...

00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:24.560
It was headed by someone

00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:26.912
who actually was at UCI for a while.

00:32:26.912 --> 00:32:29.800
He was originally a competitor

00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:32.630
in the Global Social Venture
Competition at Berkeley.

00:32:32.630 --> 00:32:34.246
He's connected to California.

00:32:34.246 --> 00:32:37.332
Anyway, he worked very hard
within the administration

00:32:37.332 --> 00:32:41.970
on things that are
social innovation funds.

00:32:41.970 --> 00:32:44.440
Funds that can be used by
the federal government.

00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:46.620
Small amounts of funds to promote

00:32:47.831 --> 00:32:51.444
new policy approaches at
the state or local level.

00:32:51.444 --> 00:32:55.510
And the other thing the
administration has done a lot of

00:32:55.510 --> 00:32:59.910
is to try to improve
the efficiency of policy

00:32:59.910 --> 00:33:04.010
by having things like
competitions for policy,

00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:06.330
suggestions, so policy ideas.

00:33:06.330 --> 00:33:08.060
And you sort of look at the results

00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:09.610
and you kind of improve things.

00:33:09.610 --> 00:33:13.280
They've brought in a lot
of private sector groups

00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:14.972
to help improve things.

00:33:14.972 --> 00:33:17.060
A very good example of this, by the way,

00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:22.060
was when the healthcare,
the rollout of the system

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:27.600
encountered all of these flaws in design.

00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:29.390
Basically, there were a lot of people

00:33:29.390 --> 00:33:32.720
from the tech community who
just went in and helped.

00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:35.208
They just said, "Okay,
we're gonna help out."

00:33:35.208 --> 00:33:38.360
You know, things like Code for America.

00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:43.360
There are important new
organizations that, oftentimes,

00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:45.650
can work with the public sector.

00:33:45.650 --> 00:33:48.270
That can be supported by the public sector

00:33:48.270 --> 00:33:51.630
through a grant or
through a research project

00:33:51.630 --> 00:33:54.190
to improve the way things are done.

00:33:54.190 --> 00:33:57.420
And then, ideally, this is where

00:33:57.420 --> 00:33:59.753
we're just seeing things happen.

00:33:59.753 --> 00:34:04.210
An innovation in, say,
how you deliver healthcare

00:34:04.210 --> 00:34:06.960
can actually start at a local level,

00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:09.129
then be copied by a lot
of different communities.

00:34:09.129 --> 00:34:11.370
And then scale up to the state level.

00:34:11.370 --> 00:34:14.820
At every level, there is
federal money coming in,

00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:15.963
because federal money is

00:34:15.963 --> 00:34:18.140
a very important part of healthcare.

00:34:18.140 --> 00:34:21.390
But the federal money is
being allocated in such a way

00:34:21.390 --> 00:34:26.040
to allow for these experimental
innovative approaches.

00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:28.600
- Let's talk about two problems

00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:32.100
that are of a concern
to every progressive.

00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:35.070
And the first is inequality,

00:34:35.070 --> 00:34:36.960
which has really become a major topic.

00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:39.868
And then, secondarily,
which is an aspect of that,

00:34:39.868 --> 00:34:44.868
the plight of women and
their unequal situation.

00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:49.480
Talk first about inequality.

00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:52.360
I mean, what does the data show?

00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:54.830
You've done a very good
job of explaining that

00:34:54.830 --> 00:34:57.760
in some of your blog posts.

00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:02.760
- Well, so, I think the most
important place to start

00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:05.590
this discussion is to note that

00:35:05.590 --> 00:35:09.880
the increase in income
and wealth inequality

00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:12.320
is not unique to the United States.

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:15.970
It started about the same time,

00:35:15.970 --> 00:35:20.110
which is probably in the late 1970s

00:35:20.110 --> 00:35:21.951
and it's continued today,

00:35:21.951 --> 00:35:25.300
in all of the developed...

00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:26.140
Or I wouldn't say all.

00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:28.540
But most of the developed
market economies.

00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:31.230
In fact, I think it was all of them.

00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:32.330
So, the first thing you say is

00:35:32.330 --> 00:35:33.700
it's not unique to the United States.

00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:38.700
You can say that, in the US,
two things are different.

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:44.480
One is that the top 1% has a larger share.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.980
And that share has grown
most rapidly over time

00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:50.300
compared to the other countries.

00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:52.860
So, if you measure inequality that way,

00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:56.040
the US clearly has the
most extreme inequality

00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:58.368
because of the share of national income

00:35:58.368 --> 00:36:01.700
or share of wealth that
goes to the top 1%.

00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:05.080
But, if you measure
inequality by things like

00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:08.315
the Gini coefficient, which
are meant to measure...

00:36:08.315 --> 00:36:10.590
It's the overall measure of inequality

00:36:10.590 --> 00:36:13.030
that's most commonly used.

00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:17.810
The US actually looks not as bad as

00:36:17.810 --> 00:36:20.935
countries like Germany
and the UK and Sweden.

00:36:20.935 --> 00:36:22.730
But that's before the government

00:36:22.730 --> 00:36:24.010
does anything to make it better.

00:36:24.010 --> 00:36:25.710
So, the Gini coefficient might be

00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:28.090
before the government does any tax policy

00:36:28.090 --> 00:36:30.820
and any transfer policy
to help the disadvantaged

00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:31.730
or the middle income.

00:36:31.730 --> 00:36:34.110
What does income inequality look like?

00:36:34.110 --> 00:36:36.010
Looks like it's getting worse every place.

00:36:36.010 --> 00:36:39.351
The US doesn't look like it's
at the top, the worst, okay?

00:36:39.351 --> 00:36:42.660
Where the US looks worse is

00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:44.990
after the tax and transfer policy.

00:36:44.990 --> 00:36:47.360
The other countries are doing a lot more

00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:49.460
to bring the inequality in.

00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:51.030
To reduce the inequality.

00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:56.030
You can do that by childcare
policies, education policies,

00:36:57.070 --> 00:36:59.983
health policies, income transfer policies.

00:37:00.890 --> 00:37:01.920
By tax policy.

00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:05.450
You can do it by a more
progressive tax code.

00:37:05.450 --> 00:37:08.920
Actually, most countries
don't do it by the tax code

00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:10.730
so much as by the transfer system,

00:37:10.730 --> 00:37:12.120
because most of these other countries

00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:13.490
have value added taxes,

00:37:13.490 --> 00:37:16.370
which are, by themselves,
tend to be regressive.

00:37:16.370 --> 00:37:19.667
So, the US does a lot less.

00:37:19.667 --> 00:37:23.236
And that is a reflection
of our policy choices.

00:37:23.236 --> 00:37:27.080
One might say, "Well,
alright, if all the countries

00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:31.570
have encountered this problem
at around the same time,

00:37:31.570 --> 00:37:33.690
what's driving the problem?"

00:37:33.690 --> 00:37:36.870
And I am a structuralist
here in the sense of

00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:40.200
thinking it's primarily technology,

00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:44.230
which is taking out a lot of
middle income job opportunities

00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:46.500
and pushing the opportunities
to the extremes.

00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:51.370
Either low income job
opportunities or very high income.

00:37:51.370 --> 00:37:52.640
You work with the technology.

00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:55.900
The technology doesn't substitute for you.

00:37:55.900 --> 00:37:56.740
You work with it.

00:37:56.740 --> 00:37:57.810
It's your robot.

00:37:57.810 --> 00:37:59.130
It's your technology.

00:37:59.130 --> 00:38:02.560
And the technology in the
middle is taking out jobs.

00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:05.320
And that leaves you with people

00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:09.780
who are doing things that
require face to face engagement,

00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:11.420
but they can be...

00:38:13.910 --> 00:38:18.070
They can be rather low income jobs.

00:38:18.070 --> 00:38:21.760
Healthcare orderlies might
be an example of that.

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:24.500
Very, very, very important.

00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:27.150
Childcare givers.

00:38:27.150 --> 00:38:29.570
Very, very, very, very important.

00:38:29.570 --> 00:38:33.130
They don't earn much in the
way of income or benefits.

00:38:33.130 --> 00:38:36.580
So, that's how I tend to see it.

00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:39.810
There are others who really focus more on,

00:38:39.810 --> 00:38:43.080
you know, the role of money in politics.

00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:45.430
My colleague Bob Reich
would do that and say...

00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:48.780
Look, I certainly think the erosion

00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:50.000
of unions in the United States

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:53.910
has been a big contributor to...

00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:57.140
Instead of holding against or pushing back

00:38:57.140 --> 00:38:58.875
against these structural forces,

00:38:58.875 --> 00:39:03.150
the ability of unions to push
that way has just collapsed.

00:39:03.150 --> 00:39:05.920
I mean, 6% of the private
sector workforce is unionized.

00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:07.430
Only 6%.

00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:09.412
Who represents the worker here?

00:39:09.412 --> 00:39:12.430
- In one of your columns,
you make the point,

00:39:12.430 --> 00:39:14.680
which I would like for
you to go over here,

00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:17.390
and that is that, traditionally,

00:39:17.390 --> 00:39:20.660
productivity, rise in productivity,

00:39:20.660 --> 00:39:23.970
was tied to the rise in income.

00:39:23.970 --> 00:39:26.863
And, since the '70s, that has ceased.

00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:31.060
And then all these factors
that you've talked about

00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:31.970
play into that.

00:39:31.970 --> 00:39:34.170
- Yeah, so, it's one of the big surprises.

00:39:34.170 --> 00:39:37.300
And I think that any economist

00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:41.410
who thinks about income inequality
sort of starts with that.

00:39:41.410 --> 00:39:46.410
Because economic logic says that,

00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:49.380
in general, labor markets are supposed to

00:39:49.380 --> 00:39:51.900
reward people according
to their productivity.

00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:54.450
So, if productivity is growing rapidly,

00:39:54.450 --> 00:39:57.690
you would expect that
wages or compensation,

00:39:57.690 --> 00:40:01.040
some measure of the
productivity of the workforce

00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:05.290
would also be growing with
that productivity growth.

00:40:05.290 --> 00:40:08.520
And, really, starting around 1980,

00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:11.080
that gap between the rate
of growth of productivity

00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:13.690
and the rate of growth
of worker compensation

00:40:13.690 --> 00:40:14.910
started to open up.

00:40:14.910 --> 00:40:16.980
It's a very large gap now.

00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:20.132
As far as we know, it's the largest gap

00:40:20.132 --> 00:40:23.960
that exists like that in
the developed countries.

00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:26.650
Suggesting that there are
some things about, say,

00:40:26.650 --> 00:40:30.570
things like labor markets
and unions, minimum wages.

00:40:30.570 --> 00:40:32.140
So, again, I'm gonna say that,

00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:34.000
in these other countries that do

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.350
a lot to compress income inequality,

00:40:36.350 --> 00:40:38.140
it's not just their policies.

00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:38.973
But they do...

00:40:38.973 --> 00:40:40.630
Well, minimum wage is a policy.

00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:43.060
They have much more generous
minimum wage policies.

00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:46.130
So, the minimum wage is often
tied to the median wage.

00:40:46.130 --> 00:40:48.923
If you put a serious
floor on the minimum wage,

00:40:48.923 --> 00:40:51.740
you're gonna hold up the
entire wage distribution

00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:52.700
to some extent.

00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:56.610
We let the minimum wage just fall apart

00:40:56.610 --> 00:40:59.120
in terms of real purchasing power.

00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:01.880
And then unions have a much bigger role,

00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:04.770
oftentimes, at the level of centralized

00:41:04.770 --> 00:41:07.540
or nationwide wage agreements,

00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:09.160
which are very, very important.

00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:10.230
And we don't have those.

00:41:10.230 --> 00:41:14.640
So, that gap might be largely explained by

00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:17.430
or significantly explained
by the lack of institutions

00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:20.140
to represent labor in what share

00:41:20.140 --> 00:41:22.350
of those productivity
gains should go to workers.

00:41:22.350 --> 00:41:26.580
- So, if this is a problem
of political economy,

00:41:26.580 --> 00:41:29.210
it's the political that
becomes very important?

00:41:29.210 --> 00:41:30.403
- Yes, yes.

00:41:30.403 --> 00:41:34.240
Look, I would say that that gap,

00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:36.280
part of that is also economic.

00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:39.630
So, what you have going on here is that,

00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:41.502
because of the technology,

00:41:41.502 --> 00:41:46.502
a larger share of what
looks like wage income

00:41:47.610 --> 00:41:50.890
ends up going to a very
small percentage of people.

00:41:50.890 --> 00:41:53.800
Many of whom are not exactly workers,

00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:57.535
'cause a lot of top
management is being paid

00:41:57.535 --> 00:42:00.650
in the basis of shares
and restricted stock.

00:42:00.650 --> 00:42:03.100
And, if you believe that those
shares and restricted stock,

00:42:03.100 --> 00:42:06.450
over time, reflect the
growing productivity

00:42:06.450 --> 00:42:08.630
and the growing revenues
that come from productivity,

00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:11.879
it's being shared in a very unequal way.

00:42:11.879 --> 00:42:16.380
So, I wanna say there're
both economic factors

00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:18.280
behind the gap.

00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:21.940
But certainly we, the politics or policy

00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:24.330
is all about how we handle that gap.

00:42:24.330 --> 00:42:26.970
What do we do about it if that's
the world that we live in?

00:42:26.970 --> 00:42:30.360
If that's what the globalization
and technological change

00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:32.480
are doing to middle income families?

00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:33.950
And to lower income families.

00:42:33.950 --> 00:42:34.888
What do we do about it?

00:42:34.888 --> 00:42:39.770
And we're not doing nearly as much

00:42:39.770 --> 00:42:43.107
as what some of our other
developed countries are doing.

00:42:43.107 --> 00:42:45.680
And we don't seem to be moving

00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:47.330
in the direction of doing more.

00:42:47.330 --> 00:42:51.630
Indeed, the right wing of
the Republican Party...

00:42:51.630 --> 00:42:53.510
And I would say even the Republican Party,

00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:55.700
the median on the Hill,

00:42:55.700 --> 00:42:59.003
really doesn't think we should
do as much as we're doing.

00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:06.570
- Your journey as a policy person

00:43:06.570 --> 00:43:11.570
and as an economist made you
sensitive to issues of gender.

00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:13.640
And then, when you became dean

00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:16.100
at the London School of Business,

00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:19.052
you were sensitized to what was happening

00:43:19.052 --> 00:43:21.018
to women graduates.

00:43:21.018 --> 00:43:22.600
Let's talk about that.

00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:25.380
'Cause you've been involved in shaping

00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:30.380
what the World Economic Forum
calls a gender parity index.

00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:32.557
Talk a little about that.

00:43:32.557 --> 00:43:35.940
And what you're seeing that's disturbing.

00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:40.430
- Okay, so, I think my
increasing engagement

00:43:40.430 --> 00:43:43.655
in thinking about gender started to come,

00:43:43.655 --> 00:43:47.260
really, when I came back to Berkeley.

00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:49.590
Not because of what was going
on at Berkeley, by the way,

00:43:49.590 --> 00:43:52.200
but because I became the
dean of a business school.

00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:55.473
And then I became dean of a
business school and you...

00:43:55.473 --> 00:43:56.950
I wanna say one thing.

00:43:56.950 --> 00:44:00.020
I am a very progressive
Democrat, I would say.

00:44:00.020 --> 00:44:02.324
But I've also really felt that.

00:44:02.324 --> 00:44:04.930
Because of my role on boards

00:44:04.930 --> 00:44:06.890
and because of the kind of academic work

00:44:06.890 --> 00:44:08.480
I did on US competitiveness,

00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:13.480
that I really understand
the importance of business.

00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:18.520
And I want policy makers
to work well with business.

00:44:19.010 --> 00:44:23.070
And I want really great educated leaders

00:44:23.070 --> 00:44:24.310
to go into business.

00:44:24.310 --> 00:44:25.870
So, I was very attracted to

00:44:25.870 --> 00:44:27.800
being a dean of a business school.

00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:30.550
I thought that was really a nice way to

00:44:30.550 --> 00:44:34.040
combine my policy interest
with my pro-business,

00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:36.030
pro-worker, how we're gonna get

00:44:36.030 --> 00:44:38.763
this public-private
partnership for economics.

00:44:39.950 --> 00:44:42.880
What I discovered early on was that

00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:45.140
there weren't many female professors

00:44:45.140 --> 00:44:46.423
and there weren't many students.

00:44:46.423 --> 00:44:50.790
Whereas the students were in
medical school and law school

00:44:52.230 --> 00:44:56.720
and public health, you had women enrolling

00:44:56.720 --> 00:44:59.090
at about gender parity 50/50.

00:44:59.090 --> 00:45:01.990
In business schools, way under 20.

00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:04.550
You were lucky if you got to 20.

00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:08.000
Women weren't applying in large numbers.

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:09.190
Then there was some evidence that

00:45:09.190 --> 00:45:11.190
they were applying but
they weren't staying

00:45:11.190 --> 00:45:13.310
in the business world
once they got the degree.

00:45:13.310 --> 00:45:15.410
So, I just got interested.

00:45:15.410 --> 00:45:19.300
And then I started to not so much here,

00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:20.930
because, here, I was doing more

00:45:20.930 --> 00:45:22.730
new economy stuff and technology

00:45:22.730 --> 00:45:24.940
and just starting to think about gender.

00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:27.816
But, when I got to London,

00:45:27.816 --> 00:45:31.620
what I was asked initially to do

00:45:31.620 --> 00:45:35.830
a report on diversity
and corporate governance.

00:45:35.830 --> 00:45:37.970
Not to do the report, but
to chair a commission,

00:45:37.970 --> 00:45:39.720
because it was a political hot potato.

00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:41.770
And, since I was not a British citizen,

00:45:41.770 --> 00:45:43.820
I could share this thing
totally objectively.

00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:45.100
That was the view.

00:45:45.100 --> 00:45:48.310
And I was on the boards of
several companies at that point.

00:45:48.310 --> 00:45:49.900
So, I said, "Okay, I'll do that."

00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:54.900
And I was struck by what we
discovered in that process

00:45:57.850 --> 00:46:01.370
of the pipeline issue that I
talked about in the lecture.

00:46:01.370 --> 00:46:06.370
The fact that you have
businesses, by the early 2000s,

00:46:08.507 --> 00:46:13.507
who were really trying
hard to have gender parity

00:46:14.290 --> 00:46:17.590
in their intake, in the
number of new employees.

00:46:17.590 --> 00:46:19.360
But then it would all disappear

00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:22.490
and you'd still see, at the
top levels, very few women.

00:46:22.490 --> 00:46:23.590
Very few women on boards.

00:46:23.590 --> 00:46:25.660
Very few women in top management.

00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:28.566
Women disappearing in middle
management in large numbers.

00:46:28.566 --> 00:46:29.890
So, what was going on?

00:46:29.890 --> 00:46:31.850
Why is this happening?

00:46:31.850 --> 00:46:33.370
And why is this happening for women

00:46:33.370 --> 00:46:34.550
who are going to business school

00:46:34.550 --> 00:46:36.240
and getting these degrees and then...

00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:38.620
And so, that's how I became interested.

00:46:38.620 --> 00:46:41.890
And then the World Economic
Forum approached me

00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:44.830
and said would I be interested in working

00:46:44.830 --> 00:46:48.210
on this new idea they had to
have one of their indices...

00:46:48.210 --> 00:46:51.270
They do a lot of indices
on global competitiveness.

00:46:51.270 --> 00:46:55.280
But they wanted to do an
index measuring gender parity.

00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:59.060
So, over the time, they
developed a series of measures.

00:46:59.060 --> 00:47:01.170
You can measure gender
parity on education,

00:47:01.170 --> 00:47:03.360
on health, on politics,

00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:05.823
and on economic opportunity
and advancement.

00:47:07.510 --> 00:47:10.550
We put together the data.

00:47:10.550 --> 00:47:13.060
There's always been a
really strong team on this

00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:15.139
within the World Economic Forum.

00:47:15.139 --> 00:47:17.460
And someone who's been
working on it consistently

00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:21.023
the whole time who I have a
very close relationship with.

00:47:22.110 --> 00:47:24.830
And we put together a report.

00:47:24.830 --> 00:47:28.244
And it's basically come to be widely cited

00:47:28.244 --> 00:47:30.910
and used by governments.

00:47:30.910 --> 00:47:34.250
Used by businesses to think about

00:47:37.790 --> 00:47:39.630
why are countries doing differently?

00:47:39.630 --> 00:47:41.100
What could countries do better?

00:47:41.100 --> 00:47:44.150
What could businesses
do better to actually

00:47:44.150 --> 00:47:46.840
add to more economic
opportunity advancement?

00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:49.287
To improve gender parity
on all these measures.

00:47:49.287 --> 00:47:53.100
- And the bottom line is that women...

00:47:53.100 --> 00:47:58.100
That there is progress,
but, in the final analysis,

00:47:58.550 --> 00:48:01.830
not as much is happening
as should be happening.

00:48:01.830 --> 00:48:02.663
- It's very slow.

00:48:02.663 --> 00:48:04.820
So, look, the truth is...

00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:07.769
First of all, I wanna say that

00:48:07.769 --> 00:48:10.340
we don't have perfect measures.

00:48:10.340 --> 00:48:14.410
In order to have a large
number of countries be covered,

00:48:14.410 --> 00:48:19.410
we had to choose data that is
available for all countries.

00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:24.920
So, with that being said,
what you find is that,

00:48:25.090 --> 00:48:28.163
on education or on health,

00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:33.300
even if you're a poor society,

00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:38.150
most societies deliver
about the same degree

00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:43.150
of educational attainment by gender.

00:48:44.010 --> 00:48:44.900
Not all societies.

00:48:44.900 --> 00:48:46.701
Clearly we can think of some that don't.

00:48:46.701 --> 00:48:49.160
That the educational parity,

00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:51.910
whether you measure it in
literacy or primary school

00:48:51.910 --> 00:48:55.060
or secondary school and
now even tertiary school,

00:48:55.060 --> 00:48:58.510
that, on education, parity is...

00:48:58.510 --> 00:49:00.180
We are approaching parity.

00:49:00.180 --> 00:49:03.660
The gender gap has been
dramatically reduced.

00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:07.720
That stands in great contrast to

00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:09.950
the disparities in what we call

00:49:09.950 --> 00:49:12.220
economic opportunity and advancement.

00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:14.530
And those would be measured by things like

00:49:14.530 --> 00:49:17.730
the percentage of the
working age female population

00:49:17.730 --> 00:49:21.340
that is working, their wage opportunities,

00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:22.940
their advancement opportunities,

00:49:22.940 --> 00:49:25.610
their percentage of high level jobs.

00:49:25.610 --> 00:49:28.330
Those, on all of those indicators,

00:49:28.330 --> 00:49:30.410
even most developed societies,

00:49:30.410 --> 00:49:32.410
even the best performers in the world

00:49:32.410 --> 00:49:34.960
haven't reduced the gender parity gap.

00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:38.130
Now, they're quite low
in the Nordic Countries,

00:49:38.130 --> 00:49:40.820
which are always top of the list here.

00:49:40.820 --> 00:49:44.160
So, maybe they've eliminated 85%

00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:46.323
of the gender gap in economics.

00:49:47.350 --> 00:49:48.910
And then the final gap,

00:49:48.910 --> 00:49:50.250
and this is the hardest one to measure,

00:49:50.250 --> 00:49:54.360
which is why I talked about
the problems of the data,

00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:56.130
is political representation.

00:49:56.130 --> 00:50:01.130
Because women around the world tend to be,

00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:03.010
if they're involved in politics,

00:50:03.010 --> 00:50:05.980
more likely to be at the local level,

00:50:05.980 --> 00:50:08.700
at the community level, at the town level,

00:50:08.700 --> 00:50:10.230
at the city level, at the state level

00:50:10.230 --> 00:50:13.500
than they are to be at the
federal or national level.

00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:15.940
And so, we don't have
good indicators of that.

00:50:15.940 --> 00:50:17.780
So, if you look at the national level,

00:50:17.780 --> 00:50:21.110
things like ministerial positions
or presidential positions

00:50:21.110 --> 00:50:23.820
or very high level
positions, all countries,

00:50:23.820 --> 00:50:27.233
the biggest gap is the gender
gap in politics by far.

00:50:28.750 --> 00:50:29.583
The progress.

00:50:29.583 --> 00:50:31.690
We recently, in the last report,

00:50:31.690 --> 00:50:34.720
we looked at the progress on

00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:36.820
economic opportunity and advancement.

00:50:36.820 --> 00:50:37.900
That's the one we looked at.

00:50:37.900 --> 00:50:41.010
We said, "If the world
continues to make progress

00:50:41.010 --> 00:50:41.900
at the current pace,

00:50:41.900 --> 00:50:44.440
it will take 81 years to close that gap."

00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:46.740
So, that's too long.

00:50:46.740 --> 00:50:50.510
And I think that societies
have to work very hard

00:50:50.510 --> 00:50:52.270
and organizations have to work very hard

00:50:52.270 --> 00:50:54.050
to make more progress.

00:50:54.050 --> 00:50:56.130
- I'm gonna recommend to our audience that

00:50:56.130 --> 00:50:59.550
they watch your lecture, which is on UCTV,

00:50:59.550 --> 00:51:01.241
where this interviewer appears.

00:51:01.241 --> 00:51:04.870
And there are two very
interesting tables at the end

00:51:04.870 --> 00:51:07.240
about how we can make change.

00:51:07.240 --> 00:51:09.080
And you point out that this has to be done

00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:12.000
at the individual level,
the cultural level,

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:14.310
the level of the company, and...

00:51:14.310 --> 00:51:15.543
- The level of government.

00:51:15.543 --> 00:51:20.543
- But I want to focus
onto another table also,

00:51:21.700 --> 00:51:24.192
which compares the strengths of women

00:51:24.192 --> 00:51:26.150
versus the strengths of men

00:51:26.150 --> 00:51:28.310
and the stereotypes that go with them.

00:51:28.310 --> 00:51:30.160
And so, I wanna ask you...

00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:31.650
I wanna put all that together.

00:51:31.650 --> 00:51:34.640
People are gonna go watch the
lecture and see the tables.

00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:39.170
But it seems that two problems that

00:51:39.170 --> 00:51:42.740
are really quite stand out.

00:51:42.740 --> 00:51:47.130
One is the problem of having children,

00:51:47.130 --> 00:51:50.730
rearing children, all of it is involved

00:51:50.730 --> 00:51:54.800
in the woman's concern about
the family on the one hand.

00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:57.030
Which suggests all sorts of policies.

00:51:57.030 --> 00:52:00.520
And then the other is the extent to which

00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:05.260
women are different than
men in a positive way.

00:52:05.260 --> 00:52:09.390
In the sense that they have
different values and so on.

00:52:09.390 --> 00:52:11.760
And, in both cases,

00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:16.270
the company level and at the policy level,

00:52:16.270 --> 00:52:19.098
this is not taken into account.

00:52:19.098 --> 00:52:21.550
Adjustments are not made.

00:52:21.550 --> 00:52:26.040
Is that a fair kind of superficial summary

00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:27.410
of what you're saying there?

00:52:27.410 --> 00:52:29.110
- Yeah, no, I actually hadn't

00:52:29.110 --> 00:52:30.340
put it quite together that way,

00:52:30.340 --> 00:52:32.930
but I think that I would agree
with everything you said.

00:52:32.930 --> 00:52:37.930
So, on the issue of
families and childcare,

00:52:38.870 --> 00:52:41.130
I think societies can do much more.

00:52:41.130 --> 00:52:44.829
Here, I think, as I said,
on gender parity measures,

00:52:44.829 --> 00:52:48.605
the Nordic Countries always top the list.

00:52:48.605 --> 00:52:50.920
There's lots of things common to them.

00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:53.280
But one of the key commonalities,

00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:55.440
which other countries around the world now

00:52:55.440 --> 00:52:56.300
are trying to learn from...

00:52:56.300 --> 00:52:58.840
I know Japan is deeply involved

00:52:58.840 --> 00:53:01.940
in studying the ways in which

00:53:01.940 --> 00:53:05.390
Norway, Sweden, Iceland,
Finland support families.

00:53:05.390 --> 00:53:10.070
Those are parental leave
policies, childcare policies,

00:53:10.070 --> 00:53:11.730
early education policies,

00:53:11.730 --> 00:53:16.380
doing everything society can
do to support the family.

00:53:16.380 --> 00:53:20.313
Not the woman as opposed to the spouse.

00:53:22.010 --> 00:53:24.380
The family is the thing to support.

00:53:24.380 --> 00:53:28.160
The family and the children in the family.

00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:31.480
And I think we can do much more.

00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:35.930
You know, I also did say, in that lecture,

00:53:35.930 --> 00:53:39.130
just last December, there was an article.

00:53:39.130 --> 00:53:41.300
They did a survey of
Harvard Business School

00:53:41.300 --> 00:53:43.500
men and women across generations.

00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:45.900
From my generation down
to the Millennials.

00:53:45.900 --> 00:53:47.137
And they asked questions about

00:53:47.137 --> 00:53:50.760
expectations of men and women about

00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:54.940
who would play the major role
of childcare in their family.

00:53:54.940 --> 00:53:58.030
And both men and women
thought women would.

00:53:58.030 --> 00:53:58.863
Still.

00:53:58.863 --> 00:53:59.696
This is now.

00:53:59.696 --> 00:54:01.100
This is right now.

00:54:01.100 --> 00:54:03.440
So, there's no way.

00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:05.400
It's not realistic.

00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:06.534
This is where I'm an economist.

00:54:06.534 --> 00:54:10.290
It's not realistic to say
you can simply have it all

00:54:10.290 --> 00:54:11.123
and do it all.

00:54:11.123 --> 00:54:12.160
Well, you can have it all and do it all

00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:14.191
if you have a whole bunch of help.

00:54:14.191 --> 00:54:17.330
But we can't assume that

00:54:17.330 --> 00:54:20.020
the average woman is
going to be able to afford

00:54:20.020 --> 00:54:20.960
a whole bunch of help.

00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:22.400
Okay, that's just not it.

00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:24.890
So, society is the source of the help.

00:54:24.890 --> 00:54:29.890
Society should want to
help families so that

00:54:29.900 --> 00:54:33.940
the talent of men and
women can be fully engaged

00:54:33.940 --> 00:54:37.330
to improve the economy, improve society,

00:54:37.330 --> 00:54:38.390
improve education.

00:54:38.390 --> 00:54:40.680
So, that's my view on that.

00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:42.803
And I think it is very, very important.

00:54:42.803 --> 00:54:47.141
It's the first thing
countries can and should do

00:54:47.141 --> 00:54:51.468
if their goal is to move
towards greater gender parity.

00:54:51.468 --> 00:54:56.468
Then, on the issue of
business organizations

00:54:57.810 --> 00:55:00.500
and gender differences, so, there is that.

00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:03.700
I did put up in the lecture this one pager

00:55:03.700 --> 00:55:08.100
which summarizes the work
of, say, the last decade

00:55:08.100 --> 00:55:12.480
by a lot of economists,
social psychologists,

00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:14.640
sociologists around the world

00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:19.640
looking at differences
in behavior by gender.

00:55:20.600 --> 00:55:23.900
So, looking at things like
differences in negotiating style

00:55:23.900 --> 00:55:26.660
and styles of competition

00:55:26.660 --> 00:55:31.660
and styles of working with
teams and styles of leadership.

00:55:34.320 --> 00:55:37.460
What the results show are
things which I think many women,

00:55:37.460 --> 00:55:40.067
and probably many men,
too, anecdotally think,

00:55:40.067 --> 00:55:42.350
"Yeah, that's how it is."

00:55:42.350 --> 00:55:46.020
But documenting them is
really, really important.

00:55:46.020 --> 00:55:48.270
Because, let me just give you an example.

00:55:48.270 --> 00:55:52.470
And it was highlighted by
what happened last fall

00:55:52.470 --> 00:55:55.840
when the new CEO of Microsoft said,

00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:59.573
when asked in a setting that
was a conference about women,

00:56:00.590 --> 00:56:02.690
he was asked, "Well,
should women negotiate

00:56:02.690 --> 00:56:06.687
for wage increases and promotions?"

00:56:06.687 --> 00:56:11.687
He said, "I think that women
have some karma by not asking.

00:56:14.990 --> 00:56:16.707
And then their talent will be discovered

00:56:16.707 --> 00:56:20.050
and they will be promoted.

00:56:20.050 --> 00:56:21.970
And they will get wage increases."

00:56:21.970 --> 00:56:23.640
Well, if he had seen this research,

00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:27.129
he would have known that
was just not the case.

00:56:27.129 --> 00:56:31.610
That women don't tend to
negotiate for promotions

00:56:31.610 --> 00:56:32.680
nearly as much as men.

00:56:32.680 --> 00:56:34.230
They're not as confident as men.

00:56:34.230 --> 00:56:35.063
They're not...

00:56:35.063 --> 00:56:36.620
Even when they're as confident,

00:56:36.620 --> 00:56:38.527
they're not as likely to go out and say,

00:56:38.527 --> 00:56:41.380
"Hey, I'm really good.

00:56:41.380 --> 00:56:42.830
Do something about this."

00:56:42.830 --> 00:56:46.580
So, the whole human
resources of an organization

00:56:46.580 --> 00:56:49.360
has to be designed
around these differences

00:56:49.360 --> 00:56:54.360
if what you want to do is achieve
gender parity in outcomes.

00:56:54.540 --> 00:56:56.680
You have to accept the
differences in behavior

00:56:56.680 --> 00:57:00.318
and say "How do we reorganize
our human resources processes

00:57:00.318 --> 00:57:03.280
to take account of these differences?"

00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:05.801
By the way, he subsequently
said he was wrong.

00:57:05.801 --> 00:57:09.260
And I said, "I just hope
his human resources person

00:57:09.260 --> 00:57:10.380
knows this literature."

00:57:10.380 --> 00:57:12.250
Because that's really what we have to do.

00:57:12.250 --> 00:57:15.950
Organizations have to know
about these differences.

00:57:15.950 --> 00:57:20.950
And, if they're committed
to developing the pipeline,

00:57:21.440 --> 00:57:23.623
they are going to have
to make adjustments.

00:57:24.835 --> 00:57:29.677
And many companies are
beginning to do just that.

00:57:30.890 --> 00:57:33.070
- Well, on that note,
Laura, I wanna thank you

00:57:33.070 --> 00:57:36.290
for taking the time to be on our program.

00:57:36.290 --> 00:57:40.240
And I wanna, again, recommend
to our audience that

00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:45.080
they watch your lecture as a
companion to this interview.

00:57:45.080 --> 00:57:47.093
And I think the two together will

00:57:47.093 --> 00:57:52.093
give an impressive sense of the ideas that

00:57:52.500 --> 00:57:54.780
you've carried throughout your life.

00:57:54.780 --> 00:57:56.446
Thank you.
- Thank you very much, Harry.

00:57:56.446 --> 00:57:58.240
- And thank you very much for joining us

00:57:58.240 --> 00:58:00.653
for this Conversation with History.

00:58:01.930 --> 00:58:04.680
