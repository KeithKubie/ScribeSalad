Speaker 1:          00:02          And when live, what's up, heavyweight champion of the world. How does that feel? Man said amazing. You know, it's a big blessing. I'm just happy this is, it seem real. It's still, yeah, of course it's real. Uh, for the first few weeks, the first few days I was pinching myself. See it fills, fills a dream or nothing, but you know, I'm just really blessed to be here. I want a big blessed honorable situation. Right. You got soaps, like how many weeks out did you find out about the fight? Um, I think it was like a month, a month and two weeks. Wow. Month and two weeks. I messaged JD Hearns I told him, you know what, give me the opportunity and what do you know, you message back? Me and my girl were just all happy. Like whoa. That was crazy. Wow. And you were already in camp, right? [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:47          so like it wasn't like they close you out of shape? No, it was after my fight against, uh, Alexander to trinkle. Oh, that's right. How much time did you have off to recover? Um, I just took like a week and a half off fell. That's nine. I went back to the gym and I, we'll just ready and loose. So it was, it couldn't have happened in a perfect time. That's amazing. Um, do you like it like that where you just experienced a big fight so you're already kind of used to the being in the ring, being on television, the whole moment of it all and then boom, it happens again right afterwards. Yeah, of course. You know, cause I was already loose, I was already in fight mode. So especially from, uh, having the heavyweight champion title, you know, I'm the opportunity to get that. It was amazing. It was incredible fight, man.

Speaker 1:          01:33          It was incredible, man. Thank you. It was really amazing. What was amazing was when you got dropped, you kept your composure, you got up and then he tried to move in for the kill and then you started landing bombs on him and dropped him. And I remember jumping off the bed while I was watching. Oh Shit. It was wild man fight. It was my first time getting dropped. And you know what? I'm, I don't feel super hurt, you know, because I have, when I got dropped, he hit me with the a good right hand and I took it like a champ. But I got a man and I just throwing bombs. You have fluid punches, man. I mean it's, it's really interesting to watch. You're so efficient. Like the way you throw punches, you're not like grunting and fucking digging. Like there's a lot of guys that you see, there's a tremendous amount of energy that's expended every time they throw punches.

Speaker 1:          02:25          But you man, your punches just coming bunches, they just pop. You just fire them on nations. The combinations that we'd be working at in the gym, many rollerblades. That's why I had a trainer who throws a lot of combinations as good at a working speed. So I think we click really good together. Well, it's such a big asset for heavyweights because most heavyweights, they're throwing big bombs and they're looking for that one punch. Yeah. And you just pile them on man. And you throw them at all these angles. And especially when you get in tight with dudes, you know, like w when you're in tight with dudes in these dogfights, your punches are coming at these different angles and so fluid is beautiful to watch, man. Thank you man. Especially with these big guys. I love fighting bigger guys. You know, some one time I s I fought a guy that was shorter than me and it was Kinda hard.

Speaker 1:          03:11          So imagine me pressuring bigger guys and throwing these combinations at works for me. Really good. It does. And you're the first ever Mexican heavyweight champion of the world. Thanks to God. It's crazy man. I mean you are in the same league as a Cain Velasquez, the first ever in UFC heavyweight champion that was Mexican. Yeah, I mean that's a, that's just an incredible honor man. Thanks man. Have water shirt that the love you must be getting from all the meaning. Oh my gosh, I can't even go to the store without taking so many pictures. People on a lines, they get off, uh, like say if I'm in a drive through somewhere, they get off of their car and tries to take pictures. But it's a blessing, you know? I really appreciate it. All my fans, all the supporters. It's amazing, man. You know what was really cool was the post-fight press conference when you talking about it, you're like, damn, you know, we made it.

Speaker 1:          04:06          And you were just saying, we're seven. My mom. Yeah. Tell your mom that was beautiful. Yeah, I can, because a lot of people don't know that we're, we're struggling a lot of, even before this fight, you know, and I'm going through a lot of the stuff with a top rank with Bob Barron of me not getting a lot of fights, a waiting, waiting because I had one more fight left with them, so they didn't want to let me go, so I had to pay my pay it off. So now, yeah, everything turned around so quick. Sorry Bob. I fucked up. Yeah, well there's a lot to do too. We're not interested in fighting you. You know? Um, I had seen it was one of those things where you were incredibly talented and incredibly skilled, but you didn't have the biggest name yet. So there wasn't like a lot of money in it yet, but there was a giant risk and a lot of insiders were very, very aware of this.

Speaker 1:          04:58          You know, guys who really followed boxing were very aware of this and coming into that fight, like I talked to a lot of people that are like big boxing fans and they're like, that dude is alive dog. That's a live dog. Like, I mean for sure. Anthony Joshua was a bad motherfucker. He's a big giant muscular dude. It looks like a dinosaur. But they were like, Andy Ruiz is alive dog. He could win that fucking, it's because when they see me, they're like, oh, look at this chubby kid, man. He's going to get tired really fast. He's just going to get knocked out. But the real people that know about boxing, they know the skills that I have, the movement. Yeah, I could get a little bit more fit and I'm more leaner, you know, get the, the um, like the extra fat turning into muscle. I love to do that, you know, but the thing is people love you because you're kind of Chubby.

Speaker 1:          05:45          Cause I, I'm me. Well it's also you, you like, you like, Hey, you know people that like go to the beach and don't want to take their shirt off. You're like, fuck man, Andy Ruiz is kinda built like me shit. And he's the champion of the world. Yeah, give, give these bad guys confident. You know, it makes a big deal. Like you remember when Butter Bean Pot, potter bean was obviously never a champ, but you know [inaudible] because he was as big fat guy. I would fuck people up. You know what? I took a picture with a butter being when I was at like thing. I was like five years old, six years old and the Quanah, he fought over there and he was a big guy, man, big guy. He was a tank man. That dude had some fucking pie where he made everybody a starch. People, you know, he really couldn't go past four or five rounds, but he would put a fucking beating on you for four rounds.

Speaker 1:          06:32          See, when Johnny Knoxville from a, that crazy asshole decided to hey, they made him bleed or something on that God. But he, they, he let him punch him for some crazy reason. He decided to try to box with butter beans, sprained them. It was, this was not good. Don't do that to people, man. Now I'm going to sign a waiver. So you're sitting pretty right now, man. I mean, you're at the top of the heap. You're the champ and you are the most popular champ right now because you're the guy who pulled off the giant upset over the Olympic gold medalist, the fucking the man, Anthony Joshua, you knock him out and like th everyone is sitting there chomping at the bit. There's wilder who's, you know, probably the greatest knockout artists in the history, the heavyweight division. And then there's Tyson fury and Tyson fury. And while they're trying to figure it out, and then Tyson fury is now in a different organization.

Speaker 1:          07:25          It's a hard to make the matches work now. It's like what happens next for you? You know? Um, what's gonna be next is the rematch against me and Anthony. Joshua, we're still negotiating. Um, but there's definitely going to be there. We matched this year. Exciting fight. Uh, but yeah, but a wilder, you know, uh, while they're wearing me and him are on the same team. I had a little interview with him over there at the pack-out fight and really cool dude. He's very cool. He's really cool. We would respect each other and um, but that'll be a good fight, you know, between me and him. I love that. Well, I mean, people knew who he was before, but God damn that Tyson fury fight put him on the map. What anything raising. I was really glad I was there too. I was like, man, I want to be in that position.

Speaker 1:          08:12          I want to be championed and kind of motivating me, you know, there well, you know, and then his, the fight with Brazil afterwards where he, he flat lined that one punch. He's an interesting guy, man. He's so interesting. You know, his story that he didn't even start boxing until he was like 20 something years old and he really started doing it because of a daughter, because the daughter has medical issues. Got into the Olympic team, won a bronze medal a year and a half in a boxing. That's crazy. Yeah, it's nuts. But he's blessed, you know? Yeah. Blessed. Like you man. I mean, this is it. It's gotta be a crazy feeling now like six months ago, you're this struggling boxer, you know, trying to make ends meet, you know, working your way up, very respected. We don't have that big name yet. And then boom, you get the opportunity of all opportunities.

Speaker 1:          09:01          I think that's what I need is just the opportunity and be hungry, you know, from having nothing to wanting to want, uh, something, you know, in life. It, it's a big motivation. Especially with me. I have five kids, so damn. Hello. I'm 29. Wow. Five kids started early. I know, but Mexican style, Mexican style, definitely. Well, hey man, your five kids are sitting pretty now, man. Yeah, that's a beautiful name. So you a, there was a rematch that is in negotiation. Now, how much can you tell us? Um, that is going to be in December sometime. December. Uh, um, uh, there's going to be, there's going to come out pretty soon. You know, I, I did tell you about telling anybody. No, don't send it to the cameras are off. Yeah. Um, but it's going to be this year. It's going to be an exciting fight.

Speaker 1:          09:55          Me and Anthony, Joshua rematch. Uh, but, um, the, the words are gonna come out soon. Where's it gonna be at? If anything, I'll message you and be like, Oh, you already know actually. Well, um, so now going into this rematch, is there anything that you're going to do differently? I mean, um, you know, obviously now that he's well aware you're a big threat, you know, he's going to think about you. I mean, I'm sure he was aware you were threat before, but when you stopped him, you became the first guy to beat him. I mean that, I mean, that changes history, that thing. What we're going to do. Uh, um, we're, we're getting a big house over there in Mexico, somewhere in the, in the nowhere is, you know, so we're going to have a close suited, uh, uh, camp, you know, close camps. So we're just going to be really focused for this fight.

Speaker 1:          10:42          We're not underestimating him or anything. Um, you know, it was just got to work hard and do it again. She'll show people what I'm capable of. Now. How much changes now that you're the champ, do you have, um, do you change anything in your camp and as far as your strength and conditioning as far as nutrition or, um, as long as we have all the team, you know, the stuff that we need and the nutrition is the chef, uh, um, the coaches, you know, the, all the, all the stuff that I need to, to win this fight, especially training, you know, that that's the main thing and trainings thing, discipline and, and, um, you know, praying to God. Now I'm coming into the fight with Joshua the first time. Did you have a nutritionist? Did you have a strength and conditioning coach? And I did have one.

Speaker 1:          11:26          Um, the plan was not to lose too much weight, you know, because the guy's really big, you know, I want it to be heavy so I could carry his weight and you know, and it worked for my favor. But I think the main thing that I'm going to do, I might do a little bit of ways just to tighten up a little bit. Uh, but just they busy. That's the main thing. Do you worry about like give, it's not broke, don't fix it. Like there have been guys before that have made changes in the way they prepare and those like maybe fuck with their confidence or they didn't feel as good. They didn't, they didn't perform the same way. No, I don't think we're going to be changing too much of that stuff. You know, as long as they're, it's training, we have the good sparring, just, just exactly what we did for the last fight.

Speaker 1:          12:06          I think that's where we're going to be doing this more intense. Now. Do you have a guy that monitors your heart rate? Do they, did they take like logs of like what your resting heart rate is when you get up in the morning and your heart rate variability and all that kind of shit? Nah, they don't, they don't do that. I'm Kinda just old school, old school, you know, work hard, wake up, run, train. Uh, he good for like four or five days and we have our little cheap meals, you know, but you know, just, just have a happy camp that, you know, this is heavy weight camp. Like attire, battery. Yeah. Heavyweight camps. Nice weight cutting. Now what kind of food they have you eating? Um, right now I'm just, uh, just eating like, you know, uh, sandwiches, uh, sandwich steaks. Yeah. I just ate a sandwich before I came on.

Speaker 1:          12:50          So, well, the beautiful thing about beating heavyweights, you don't have to worry about your weight, but it's in terms of optimal performance, like when your chef has you in camp, oh, when will come and they feed everything chicken. Me. Uh, I try not to eat too much. Me, you know, it takes too long to digest. I get constipated, can shit comfortable. But, um, everything, no vegetables, a lot of white rise. They tell, they tell me not to eat too much white rice, but I like white rice. Now. Do they have you taking supplements or anything like that? You know what, for this fight I wasn't taking a lot of slip them as just multivitamins. Um, something to get me through the training. Um, yeah basically. And what kind of strength of conditioning should they have? You do and you running, you running, sweating, um, doing explosive stuff.

Speaker 1:          13:40          Uh, a lot of made work, a lot of millwork. I think that's one of my favorite things at the gym. Sparring, beating people up and doing millwork. Yeah, of course. Right now you, you had an extensive amateur career too, man, which is a think a lot of like how you're so well-schooled you know, that that helped me a lot, you know. Um, I first started training when I was six years old and now I trained for a whole year and when I was 70 years old, I had my first amateur fight. Um, I was always this big Chubby kid where, uh, there wasn't people at my age at that weight. So I always had a fight. Bigger guys and no older guys. So my first fight I won, but they gave it to the other guy at 12 years old, finding a seven year old. So, but I got robbed, I got robbed.

Speaker 1:          14:27          I feel I dabbed your first fight and I, and I had the video too. Oh, just put that shit online. Yup. Let the Internet decide. Wow. So you first fight at seven years old. That's incredible, man. That's, there's no substitute for that guys who get into combat sports young. That's the guys who have what I was talking about that you possessed before. That sort of fluidity. The efficiency to punches. It's like your, you develop throwing punches. I, it's all muscle memory type of, you know, um, a lot of male work and she's working hard, man, working hard. And this is a sport that I love and I've been doing. This is the only thing that I know. So thank God that it paid off, but I just, it's, it's such an amazing story. I love a story like that. It's such a rocky story, such as Cinderella story and I Cinderella, it's amazing.

Speaker 1:          15:12          Well, yeah, everybody underestimated me there. They're just waiting for me to, to get knocked down. And then when they, when they see me get knocked down, they're like, oh. And it's crazy that the announcers were saying, oh, Anthony's a great finisher. Look at how he's in, finish him and what do you know? I ended up getting them with the, with the hook. Yeah. It was crazy how many times you watched the fight? Um, probably like 30 times, 30 times. And I still got more, more to see, you know, because when he come in with the uppercut and the hook, um, I was Kinda, I was kind of being on a lazy mode, you know? Uh, I think I need to put my geared up more and move ahead more. Well, he's a big powerful motherfucker, but he's an outside fighter. He likes to fight on the outside and drop big power punches.

Speaker 1:          15:55          And that's where it became apparent that like when you're in the dog fight, when you guys are in tight, you have that advantage. The fluidity in efficiency. And I think it's, I think it was the speed that I kind of messed them up, you know, and I'm not, I'm not just the one, two, three fighter, a puncher, you know, and I try to throw more than, than one or two punches. So no dude, you know, throw hailstorms shit coming away from all kinds of angles. It's awesome man. So you're in this amazing position now, um, when you're, you're headed into this fight, how long did it take to negotiate the rematch? I'm sure you had some sort of a contract clause, right? Yeah, we had a contract clause, uh, which has been going back and forth, you know, with my team and their team. Cause they were trying to get you to go to England.

Speaker 1:          16:38          Yeah. But now I want to say it in America, but in, there's some, we don't, we can't say what's happening. I love to have it back over there at the Madison Square Garden, you know, loves to run it back. And [inaudible] how about the staples center and the Staples Center? That's what I said to and when one of the interviews, but for Vegas Move Vegas would have been great too. Yeah, right. But wherever it is is going to be an amazing fight and amazing venues. So, but tune in is there, the announcement is going to be in soon. Now is this gonna be on design again on the zone? Beautiful. Um, it's so nice. You could just watch it on app. Yeah, we're watching your phone and watching a laptop. And um, when you see the rest of the heavyweight division meeting, what a crazy, exciting time for boxing. Lauzon comes in these waves, right?

Speaker 1:          17:23          And we're like this waves of awesome shit happening right now as a hot wave. Canelo's hot. You know, Manny just won the title at 40 years old, you know, triple g and canal, they're talking about having another fight. It's so amazing right now. It's like boxing is on fire. That is, you know, and I'm just blessed to be in there and in the top 10, you know, and having the unified heavyweight champions. But, you know, uh, I'm willing to fight anybody as soon as I, um, when the, the rematch, I'm willing to fight Tyson fury or wilder or anybody, you know, that's all. Well, listen, there's never been a time that I can recall where there's four legitimate heavyweight champions that everybody thinks of. Like, look, Anthony, Joshua could have been the man, you know, Tyson fewer. He could be the man while there could be demand.

Speaker 1:          18:14          You could be the man who's the fucking man. It's like, no one knows. It's not like during the Tyson era, it was like Tyson and everybody else was just, just waiting to get murked. You know, like there's been times where there was a standout fighter, but when you, when Joshua beat Klitschko, it was apparent that Joshua was the guy. But then as wilder started piling up bodies, it's like, damn, maybe Wilder's the guy and then Tyson fury comes back, you know? And like a lot of people had written Tyson fury off after the Klitschko fight. They were like, you know, he kind of went crazy, almost committed suicide and all these mental health problems and now he seem super happy and healthy. And so it's this incredible, incredible time for boxing where you have like in terms of star power and in terms of like the public interest, I can't recall a time in my life with has been for dudes who were at the top of the heap like this.

Speaker 1:          19:09          Yeah, a Tyson phrase, a good guy. It's, you know, I love his personality, his energy. And you know what if I, if, if I want to see that fight again while during fury, you know? And those are really good fight. I think it was really close. If Walter wouldn't have knocked him down in the last round, I think Tyson freer was winning in my eyes. I think so too. And I think you could make an argument that he still won even though he got knocked down twice in the five. Yeah. It's still, you make a good argument that he still won the decision. I know a lot of people think he did, but I didn't have a problem with the decision just because of action does not end the way wilder knocked him down and that final well like what the fuck? How did he get up?

Speaker 1:          19:50          That was, what was crazy like when while there like two was a stomach crosses throat and with Oh fuck, it's over and he's shaking his head. He thought it was off and then Tyson fury just rises from the dead like a fucking Zombie. It's just as crazy man in the heavyweight division, you know? It only takes one punch to change the whole game, the whole, the whole fight, you know? And that's the beauty of it. It is the beauty of it. Now. What is it like, like getting accustomed to all this recognition now I know you've got this new ice, you got an ar hanging phone spending a little, that heavyweight champion. Shailene jeweler. Yeah man. Dude, your, I mean your whole life is like shifted. Like what does that feel like? Shit, it feels good. You know, just get in the stuff that I always wanted. You know, seeing a lot of famous, uh, people having nice stuff, you know, and uh, thanks to God and now I could just get it from myself and from my family, from my kids. My mom. I'm gonna call you driving now. Um, I have a Rolls Royce.

Speaker 1:          20:50          You stepped right up. You didn't even fuck around. You didn't even try BMW first. Nah, I already had that before. What were you driving before you won the title? Um, I had a Porsche. I had a Porsche Panamera oh, those are nice. But it's our roles wise. No, Rolls Royce is a king car. You know what the car that I love right now and I bought from my, from my fiance Julie. Uh, it's the new g wagons. It's 2019 so beautiful shine. My wife is one of those. Yeah, the other shit. She was lucky. Those are dope man. That's a crazy car. It's, they redesigned it. They made it so that the old ones, they had like a, that old truck suspension with the live rear and front axles and it was kind of bumpy and shit. I love it, man. When you move it, when the car moves that like the seats hug you, that's a tank too.

Speaker 1:          21:39          Yeah. Those doors we a thousand pounds. It's crazy. We shut those things like a bank vault, you know? Yeah. But there's something about a Rolls Royce man that's like a suitable car for a champ. You know, you run around the room. All my dream car man, my dream car I even had pictures of before. I wasn't even in any of that. Nothing. I used to have pictures on my, on my, on my wall of other cars that I wanted a Lamborghini, Rolls Royce, you know, just dreaming big. Right. And that's what I tell a lot of these kids, managers that dream big have, have 'em right. Something that you want in life and just keep, keep praying for it, you know, keep wishing for it and it will come true. You work hard. Yeah. If you work hard. Some people just want to wish, no. Yeah. They got to work hard.

Speaker 1:          22:19          There's a lot of shit involved. Yeah. Do you use any sort of a sports psychologist or anything like that? Um, no, not really. No. Just motivation. My kids, uh, um, you know, just a person that wants to do betters and to do better. Right. And so when you are preparing for a fight, do you, um, do you ever have moments where you, you know, you'll, you'll find yourself feeling down or you find yourself not, yeah, there's mental place now. There's a lot of times like that, you know, because I'm missing home. I'm like, man, I want to go with my kids. I want to go with my girl. Oh, I'm, I'm, I'm mad man. I haven't, I haven't fucked or nothing, so I'm fucking angry. And um, you know, stuff like that. That's what a lot of boxers go through, you know, because this is a lonely sport, you know, this was a one man sport and you know, you got to do everything on your own and not on your own.

Speaker 1:          23:14          But when you go to the gym, you have routine, but you just after the gym as, as what you do, you know, I usually just rest, watch movies. I'm trying to go to show, find a show, just relax, just chill out. Do A, get regular massage or anything. Yep. I get massages, um, from ar therapy, uh, from La. Uh, he hooks it up like every, I probably when I'm in camp, I'll get one like to two times a week, three times. So basically it's normal stuff, just normal strength and conditioning food. It's the grind of camp is something that boxers always complained about. That's like one thing is this to the day in, day out, just hard work constantly. You know what sex for for a lot of the fighters too is going in there and you know, your coach wants you away, you after training every fucking time and you're like, man.

Speaker 1:          24:06          And it's crazy. But you know, I was just working hard. It's, it's, it's, everything's in a payoff. What did they like to keep you at? Like what weight did they like to keep you out? Um, I think like at two 55 to 50, that's where you feel like you're your best. I'm at my best at two 50 by two 50. But I gained to, what did I wait like two 67 for Joshua really purpose. Just because he saw me. Huh? Yeah, I kind of worked out. It definitely worked out. Now what did you do differently? Um, nothing. No, it was good. Just I'm more portion, you know, a little bit more portion and I was just happy through all this camp. You know, I was just focused, motivated. Uh, I kept telling everybody that I'm going to win, that I'm going to pull out the upset and you know, just having those good vibes inside you.

Speaker 1:          24:55          Uh, and the fun camp, you know, it was fun. I enjoyed the camp a lot. The only thing that people worry about when someone finds success and you know, obviously Tyson is the best example of it because he's documented in his documentary and he talks about all the time was how things got out of control. Once he became famous, I was, things just went off the rails and he just lost his fucking mind. How do you, how do you prevent that from happening and you were weeds. I think just having the right people around you. You know, having the right people around you that want to do good and want you to do good, you know, I'm bringing you good opportunities, you know, stuff like that. And you know, I'm a, I'm a family man. I'm always with my kids, with my fiances. So, um, that's one of the big blessings that I have.

Speaker 1:          25:40          And if that would've happened, I think my dad will grab me by the throat, like, what the fuck are you doing? He's always on me. So you seem like a real down to Earth Guy, which helps a lot, you know? I mean that, that really does, it's the dudes that have feeling like sometimes the ego is what gets you to the dance because you believe you are the baddest motherfucker of all time. But then once you are there and the challenge is met, then there's no other challenges in front of you, like with Tyson. And each fight is kind of like a done deal before it happens and you just start getting tigers and doing crazy shit, you know, recently with tigers. Yeah. Nah. Um, then the main thing just remain humble, you know? Um, I, um, I was praying for this opportunity for so long, so I'm still gonna continue to keep praying and thanking God for all these big blessings that he gave me and you know, just continue to work hard and enjoy my family to the fullest.

Speaker 1:          26:38          And you've got a good crew of dudes with you too. You can tell. I know this is you're saying this the biggest entourage that the hat and I never, I never rolled everybody's ever brought in here. I never wrote with a lot of entourage and not just with a few of my best friends, you know, friends, close friends that were from high school and some of my cousins and that's awesome. Stuff like that. Just family who know you. He's actually known you from the beginning. Now I'm this new found celebrity, like are they giving you like there's other distractions that come your way, like, like movie type offers and television shit. You know what? I did my first commercial, uh, for sweat away exhales and, and uh, it's a Masco brand. What is it? A sweat o x sweat o x sweat away. It's a, it's a drink, you know, like, uh, like pedia light, but it's a Mexican version and it was fun, man.

Speaker 1:          27:27          It was really fun. I loved doing commercials. Have you been to Mexico since you one? I have. You remember I met the president of Mexico. I went to Los Pinos and that was amazing man. Um, um, that is Lopez. He's the president for, for med school. Amazing guy is a wild being in Mexico was the first ever Mexican heavyweight champion and it was super wild. So many, so many fans, you know, little kids, uh, of, um, all types of sort of people come in my way and it's just crazy how, how they react, you know, how they react or screaming. Like it's crazy, man. I was, must be the, the wildest thing about this is the shift in how people perceive you versus just a few months ago and now like you're the fucking man. It's, it's weird, right? It's crazy. Does that mean what does, what, what goes on in your head while all this has happened?

Speaker 1:          28:22          Um, that this is just the beginning. You know, this is just the beginning and you know, I don't wanna I don't want to lose the title. So the main thing I could just gotta stay focused and get prepared for the rematch. You know, cause there's more work to be done. So, and um, you know, I want to be the Mexican Rockies so I want to continue to keep winning and defending all my titles. That's beautiful. Now Joshua is the first fight and so this will take place in December. And given if you win, what would you like to, who would you like to face next? Cause it looks like it's going to be a while before they could sort out Tyson fury and Deontay wilder. Um, because of contractual shit. Uh, when I, when and, and Sealskin I went for the rematch. Uh, I love to fight Tyson fury man sizing fury.

Speaker 1:          29:09          I know wilder Wilder's there too. He has the belt that, that I want, you know, cause I want the WBC bell. Why do you want that belt? Because I'll be undisputed if I have that bell, you know, I have all the belts. I'm in the heavyweight division and I'll, I'll be the new king. Do you have not? You have WBA I have the WBA. WBO I beo and IBF. Damn. I know. Damn, that's crazy. I should've brought him to man. Shut up. Do what you just have laid out on your bed? No, they're actually in my at Dad's house. They're actually, I thought my dad's house must be bizarre. Just looking at them. Right? They are, man. It's, I was crying, man. Like I said, I was still pinching myself for, for weeks. I can only imagine. I would imagine it's getting the last years before really, really, really sinks in.

Speaker 1:          29:58          So, uh, Tyson fewer seems to you to be like the best matchup after that size. Inferior. I think that he's, well, he's one of the biggest names out there, you know? Um, I, I liked Dylan, Dylan White, so, you know, he was coming up, but um, he got caught up with stop it. Uh, what did he get? What did he get caught with? I don't know. I think it was PD or something, some sort of performance enhancing. I don't know why they do that. I know why they want to win. Shit. I, you don't need it man. Look at me. I'm, it doesn't look like if I take anything. And I was just on natural. Well, you're consistent and even though you carry body fat, you're always in great shape. You know, you never have a problem with fatigue. I have a six pack under my bed.

Speaker 1:          30:40          It's in the valley somewhere. Yeah, I mean that's deceptive. You know, there's quite a few fighters like that that you look at them on the outside and you can get real confused, you know? But you have always been consistent. Like you had a consistent amateur career, consistent professional career. Some fighters just like they, maybe they just feel like they need something else, you know? They just don't feel like they're doing enough and they want it. They want a shortcut. It's usually, it's usually a bad sign, you know? And in today's climate it's, look, there's, there's Vata testing and there's the best, you know, that was my first time getting tested. And by Vida and they're fucking strict man. They go there, they'll go look for you wherever you're at, at your house, at the gym, anywhere. And um, they take blood out, piss out. I liked it.

Speaker 1:          31:30          Yes. Um, I think it's the best way. And you Sada is what works with the UFC. Very similar, same sort of deal. They wake you up six o'clock in the morning, hey buddy, time to find out what's up, you know, and they've caught a lot of people that way. They caught a lot of people and it's great. It cleans up the sport, you know, I mean this, uh, this is a dangerous, dangerous sport and when people are taking things, they, there's a potential that they could hit you when they wouldn't be able to hit you without it. And I mean, this is a something that we all want to avoid. We all know, avoid anything that could potentially mean it's already a dangerous enough, some balls out. It's already trying to kill each other and all that. Yeah. Yeah. So Dillon white is, I mean, how long they suspended him for?

Speaker 1:          32:12          Um, I'm not sure. I seen it on Instagram, but you know, things happen. But you know, hopefully it gets clean and, or we don't know what really happened. You know, maybe there was a team side of that puts something in it or we don't know. Yeah. It could be PR. When we catch this a lot with the UFC, we're guys buy a supplement at like a vitamin store and it's tainted. Or even like a diet one holiday. They been that soon. Yeah. Yeah. Anything that has like a diarrhetic things along those lines. Yeah, it's a as a shame. But you know, if they're not using Vada testing and they get caught, then they're just dumb. Cause then it doesn't, it means that, that's what I was kind of scared. You know, fighting over there at the UK. We don't know what they're gonna be letting our Anthony Joshua be taking or whatnot or, I don't know, take some shit.

Speaker 1:          33:02          I don't know. Tell you what she looks like. He does. He does. He looks like it. But it looks like what you would think a movie fighter would look like. You know, like he's, he's just, he's built perfect, like he's got a perfect body. Like you wouldn't want to change anything, you know, like if you're making a sculpture, like damn nailed it. Yeah. You know, but that, I don't know if that's natural. What do you think? I don't know if he took something, you know, it didn't work. If he, if he doesn't wear, if he doesn't use it for the next fight, I don't know who knows how the body's gonna react or if he doesn't have it. So, or maybe, um, reacted wrong when he wasn't using it when I follow him or that's possible. That's definitely happened before. That's definitely happened before. You know, you've seen fighters that look different because of stricter testing and then they don't perform the same way.

Speaker 1:          33:52          They have like real proud. And then also it's confidence. If you know you've been cheating and then all of a sudden they take away your secret weapon and then you just, you're like, I'm fine, I'm fine, but you in this little league out. Yep. So you worried about that? If, if I, if the fight takes place in the UK, uh, you know, somewhat, but it's not going to be over there. So he's never tested positive before. Right. He's never have, so you just gave up the ghost, you said it's not going to be over there. So now the people have narrowed it down. There's 197 countries, now we know it's not going to be in England. No, that's not okay. 196.

Speaker 1:          34:27          Yeah, it's uh, in combat sports. I mean, it's always been a problem. Performance enhancing drug. Now everybody's been using it. A lot of champions, you know, from the heavyweight division two, a lot of sure. A lot of people. Yeah. But I dunno, I don't want to try it. I don't want to get caught up. Well, it's, it's beautiful that you haven't had it and you can take pride that everything that you've accomplished is from hard work and intelligence. Yeah, sure that. So when you look at the landscape of boxing, I mean, right now, uh, what fights are exciting for you? Um, I want to see that pack out and, uh, what's his name? Thurman? No. Uh, um, uh, the guy that fought, uh, many, um, Mikey Garcia. Oh, Earl span arrow span or else Penn's chant like him. He's a bad motherfucker. Wish the shutdown Garcia like that.

Speaker 1:          35:25          Garcia is a bad motherfucker. He was, I was over there in Vegas with him. It was funny. Well, when Garcia look, I give it up to Garcia cause after that fight, he's like, that guy is the truth. Yeah. The guy's the real deal. And you know, that's beautiful when a guy doesn't make excuses and says, hey man, I guys, he's, everybody knew Earl. Spence is a bad motherfucker though. I mean there was no surprise once you have him fight like the really elite fighters, I think that's when highest talents is in a show. Oh sure. Yeah. I mean it's such a great time for boxing or Earl spends junior versus Manny pack. That would be incredible. Yeah. They're working on it. Is that what they're working on? I thought they were working on a rematch with Thurman. Uh, I don't think so. No. No. Who wants to see that?

Speaker 1:          36:04          Man, I want to see, you don't want to say I think Pacquiao beat his ass. Fuck yeah. It was crazy when he knocked him down. The first round was huh? Wow. I think he got too confident at the many pack. Y'All got too confident and he got hit with punches that he shouldn't have. You know? And I don't know, I think Thurman was just surviving the whole time, but either way he was connecting really good shots. He connected with good shots and then he hits hard. The crazy thing is Manny is the oldest ever guy to win the welterweight title. 40 years old. He's won titles in how many different weight classes now it's more than eight. Like 12. I don't know something, but it's like eight more than eight different weight classes, which is nuts. Like who the fuck does that? And then maintains his power all the way through it.

Speaker 1:          36:48          He just takes care of himself, you know. Amaz I am white rice, whatever it's doing in the Philippines, so it's amazing. But um, yeah, that's a great fight. Um, and then there's Mayweather who shows up at that fight and talking shit. And I think that'd be a good fight against Manny pack young Mayweather. Oh, watch it. Apparently according to Khabib number, I bet on it could be. You've never been better off as the UFC lightweight champion, bad Russian motherfucker. He's, um, he's saying that that Floyd May, where there's people have been trying to get him to box him. Uh, that's crazy. Wow. Floyd made that an easy money off Conor McGregor. That's crazy. He probably thinks I do too. I mean, a crazy, well, Floyd played that perfectly too. You don't give Connor like six weeks to prepare. You know, he, uh, you know, he took the lion's share of the money but gave Connor shitload.

Speaker 1:          37:37          He made a lot of money off that fight. Yeah, man. Where there's smart man, like I said, having the right people, which you and that, that give you good opportunities. Those are the right people you want around you. Now, when you were coming up, um, who are you influenced by? Like, who are you a big fan of? Um, of Chavez, you know, all the Mexican fighters. Moralez Barrera I got to meet. Um, I've, I read, I was my first time. It was a good honor over that. The pack y'all fight. Uh, you know, my Tyson, um, you know, all the, all the big guys, all the Mexican guys as well too. Yeah. Um, so you're 29, so when you were, when you first started out, who was, uh, who was big? Fernando Vargas hills man. Fernando. Fernando on the plane was, yeah. Mesa have the same haircut as him.

Speaker 1:          38:28          I, I painted my, my hair. That was crazy. Yeah. No, he was a bad motherfucker. He was a lot of fun to watch. Didn't he had some reality show he was doing it to write on it with him and his family. What is he doing now? Do you know? Um, he's training fighters and his kids too. They're really talented. Um, we're at in Vegas. Yes. Yeah. Nice. No, they have really good people. Nice guys. Oscar de la Hoya. Your fan of his, yeah. I'll share a little to this. I mean, there's so many great Mexican fighters. If you think about one country that produced a basing boxers, I mean, Mexico might be the top of the heap. I mean, if you really started to think about it, I think, um, I think we're missing one champion. I think we'd have champions in all the divisions except for one.

Speaker 1:          39:12          I think light heavyweight maybe. Probably cruiserweight. Cruiserweight I think. I think so. But you know what? At least we got the first Mexican heavyweight champion. Yeah, that's a field man. So crazy. Those good, you know, just my saying, I'm going to be, I'm in the records, you know, um, hopefully nobody forgets my name, but you know, there's always going to be the first Mexican heavyweight champion of the world, especially for my kids. You know, for them to look up and be like forever. Yeah. My Daddy never kick your daddy's ass. It'd be number one. I mean, you're the first ever does. No one ever can take that from front. That's it. Forever. Blessing man. Read the books. This is what I'd been working for for so long. You know, my dad pushing me, embarrassing me and with my friends. Um, how do you actually just by kicking me out by telling me, come on.

Speaker 1:          40:00          We had to go try and get the fuck out of there. I Dunno. It was crazy, man. My Dad's always been there behind me, so I don't think I would've been in this position if he wasn't in the role of all this. Is Your Dad a boxer? No, but his dad used to train fighters and my heat Kelly. Oh, a long time ago. I never got to meet him, but, and he never boxed himself. Um, no. It was just in the streets. Did he train? No, he'll just see. It was just see his, his dad trained other guys. I didn't think he had the discipline. I think it was, he was more like a hustler basically. So what was his thought when you first started finding, well, he's the one who put me into it because, yeah, because, um, I used the destroy your, I used to destroy everything, all the, the toys, uh, my mom's stuff, everything.

Speaker 1:          40:48          So it has so much energy as a little kid. He just took me to, after my first thing was karate. I tried karate. I was six years old, didn't like it. It took too long for action or whatnot. And he put me in the boxing. I was six years old. And what do you know? I fell in love with the sport. So what do you mean by t took too long for action? Um, I think we were practicing too much or something. I like Katas and Chile. And the first two weeks when I went to a boxing gym, they made me spar in the kick, kick the shit out of me, man. They beat me up. I knew he was seven. I was, no, I was six and a half. You remember? Cause I trained a whole year. And so I turned the right. Um, they beat me up.

Speaker 1:          41:28          They put me this far my first time and I was bleeding and I told my dad, you know what? I don't want to fight no more like that. What do you mean? You just got to keep training and you're gonna end up beating everyone up. And what do you know? A year later I ended up beating heroin up. So your nickname came from you fucking things up as a kid. Fucking things up. Just showing things. I could never have a toy or ar or even like a the game boy or anything for like more than a week or something cause I would end up breaking it. Right. So did your parents give you that nickname? Yeah. That's hilarious. That's what a great nickname. That seems like a tough guy nickname. But then when you find out it's because you were a little kid and you would break your toys. That makes it even better.

Speaker 1:          42:08          Every, not just toys but everything classes. Uh, I don't know. It was crazy. So it must be wild for your dad to see you come up from a six year old kid and you know, because of his pushing you and trying to keep you in there that you eventually start excelling and winning amateur fight after amateur fight. And then he's really happy manager. They happy. And, um, uh, like I said, he's really happy. He's really blessed. He's over here and over there just enjoying life as well. Now when you were coming up to, was their fighter who style you tried to emulate, was there anyone that like really stood out for you? You know, I sparked a lot of guys in the hill. All of them telling me that I have, uh, my own type of style. You know, they tell me that I have a calm different style than, than everyone else.

Speaker 1:          42:56          And you know, I kinda, I like that would, that is one of the beautiful things about boxing and all martial arts like this. A lot of people that don't like that term martial arts cause they don't think it's really an art, but it is an art. I think it's harder man shit from being in the ground and fighting up. It's a lot of things you have to learn. Oh, for mixed martial arts. Yeah. But I mean even boxing as a martial art and what I mean is that like the way you knocked out Joshua, that was beautiful. It was beautiful for a, for a person like me who loves boxing, it was art. Like you expressed yourself in art. I mean that's no different than a badass movie or a rap song or a symphony. It's art. It's just art with your fists. And you know, I mean, you saw, I'm sure you saw that video that I posted up on my Instagram.

Speaker 1:          43:44          Who was the guy that made that video, that video where he hits Joshua and Josh, his soul leaves his body. He goes on the airplane and I was a funny man. That guy's amazing. What is his, what is it? Five, four? What we're going to find out is it Instagram and give them some prompts cause seven 47 right around seven 47 put that, put that up so we could watch that again. This, that guy is a goddamn genius. Cause he didn't just do it with that. He did it with Deontay versus Brazil. He gave him a fantasies, a power fist. This guy does amazing. Animate. This one's not on Jamie. Oh, the guy does a amazing, uh, animation. I mean, I don't even know how the fuck he does something like that. I'm what program, but this was my favorite play. Play this Jamie through Joshua through

Speaker 2:          44:34          here. Boom. Look at that. What do you see? The soldiers leaves his body a blue. So he gets the roller bag. He's on the, he's on the escalator. He gets on the plane and they'll go, the tweety birds are flying around his head. That is hilarious man. That guy's a God damn genius Ray Rod, seven four seven. Thanks a lot buddy. No, he's genius. How many millions of views that should get? Well I think you re posted it and I got a lot more views than on his page. His got like 730 (630) 730-5000 but on mine it was millions. Yeah, no, it's crazy. He's, he does a lot of great shit in MMA and in boxing there's been a lot of that, right? A lot of memes. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          45:18          I liked it, you know, and now they have my own ones. So it's amazing to have your own one. What? Like the Mimi's that they put out above me hitting a Anthony Joshua, you know, stuff like that. Having me there and looking at it, I'm just like, wow, man. It was crazy. Yeah. Wild. Right. So you, you didn't emulate anybody when you're coming up. It's not like Chavez or, or Barrera. You like tried to imitate their style or type of course. Yeah, of course. Like Tyson, you know, everybody wants to knock everybody out like Tyson and um, Chavez always going to the body. You know, I'm one of the heavyweights. I like to hit the body of law, you know, you get them tired. Um, uh, but like I said, I think I have my own style, you know, I like, I like my style. Have you had the same trainer your entire life?

Speaker 1:          46:08          No, I went through, I learned from a lot of different trainers. You know, my first, um, real professional trainer was Freddy Roach. That's when I man, yeah, that's when I met Manny Pacquiao, Freddy, Freddy, me too. Um, great guy. Freddy, uh, helped me out through my whole professional career until like the, my 10th or 12th fight. He had me. So I learned a lot from him. Why did you stop training with them? They send me to Las Vegas, a top rank, send me over there. Uh, and then, um, some guy, Jeff, Jeff's, I'm going to Jeff Gramada, some big guy was trying to meet over there. Then we moved from there when we went to April Sanchez when I felt for the, for the world title for the WBO again, parking up in big bear, big Abel. I was in big bear for I think for like a month and a half for the Joseph Parker fight was the only fight you've lost and there was a close decision.

Speaker 1:          47:01          Exactly. What's your, what was your thoughts on that fight? Um, you know, I trained myself for that fight. A lot of yelling. A lot of people don't know the, the training camp that we had, April Sanchez had like eight different fighters fighting at that same time. So he was always flying out. So he'll just leave us a piece of paper and be like, you know what, you guys do this, do that. And on our own, you know, so that Kinda sucked. Why did he do that? Uh, I blew the Hill's obligation to, to go to the too thin. Yeah. That sucks. I'm a fan of Abel Sanchez too. He's a bad motherfucker. Yeah, he sure is. You know, I appreciate everything that he's done for me. He was so knowledgeable. But for that fight, um, I think I needed to the right trainer and moving with many robe Liz and estate dials.

Speaker 1:          47:45          It was the best thing I could have done, you know, cause those guys are really on me. It just two, two guys just pushing you and one telling you that one, you have that and it just good. You know, it keeps you focused. And so when Abel was training you and you train by yourself, you're up there in big bear and training by herself. How you going nuts? I was going Helen as man and the fuck am I doing up here. It ain't shit to do that one movie theater. I was going back and forth from my hometown, you know, cause I live in imperial valley. I live like, so that's like four hours, right? Three hours from big bear and I'm, I was just going back and forth and I wasn't really focused for that fight, you know? So, um, a lot of people don't know that that did you?

Speaker 1:          48:25          The UK? No, I fought them in New Zealand. Oh Wow. And his hometown too. Oh Wow. So I think if I would've been over here with many real bliss, I definitely would've won. What was it? Close fight. It was a good, that was a good fight. What, when you think about what, what went wrong? I mean, this is, it's always so important for a fighter to have to experience a loss because a loss sort of lets you know like, hey man, you don't want this feeling. You know, and I didn't want to lose no more, you know, and that's when exactly. That's when everything went down and me having child comes with a top rank and, um, then not letting me go and I'll Hayman helping me out. How him as the man, you know, he's a man right now. And he helped me out through, through everything to get me out of the situation and, and giving me this opportunity.

Speaker 1:          49:15          So, top rank, did they make you train with able, like how did, how did that set up? Yeah, we ended up going over there with Abel Sanchez. Um, you know, it was a, it was a good, good idea at first, but we didn't know it was gonna be like that Bryant cause he's just got too many up to five. There's too many obligations and the triple g want to believe in him as well. Right? Yeah. Triple g went with Jacobs, Anthony and Jacobs or something like that. Um, my uh, bat triple, she's a good fighter. You know, I seen him over there at the fights too, so he's a man. Good. We're good friends now. He's amazing. And you know, I'm really interested to see his rematch. If they tried to do a rubber match, he's a strong man. Me and him wrestled over there and big bear and like literally wrestling.

Speaker 1:          49:58          And this guy picked me up and she's, he's strongly, those Russians are a different kind of, you know, they're strong, different, they got different tendons or so, but he's strong now. He is a bad motherfucker. He's a really friendly guy too. He's always smiling and shit. He's humble his ass. Yeah. I get along with him really good. We're over there going crazy together while we record. Um, it was just some something that some, some drill to warm up and, and I'm grabbing our fist by, I mean our hands, like shaking our hands to get, so he gets strengthened our forearms and shaking your moons. Those like can, can we do it and like going like that. Like, oh, just squeezing walls. Yeah. We get like, uh, cramps right here. Yeah. Here's how we're on this fucking big, too strong. But why not like do like a risk role where we do that one too, but I guess I don't know that.

Speaker 1:          50:50          So this style of doing it, picking each other up and how weird is this shit? So was able Sanchez gone with him too? Or did he, was he focusing on, um, triple g was in training at that time? He had a different other fighters he had to go. Oh, okay. So he was just in camp. So then you left Abel Sanchez and now you're training with, with Manny. Rob Lives in a state that at the legends boxing gym in Norwalk. So that is where you feel like is your best fit. Yeah, that's, I'm comfortable right there, you know. Um, the gym is beautiful facilities really big. Um, you have everything that you need. But for the, um, Reese Joshua to, uh, the training camps and to be in the mountains somewhere private and, you know, so we could just focus and get ready for the Mexico. Nice.

Speaker 1:          51:41          Um, did you like training at altitude? A big bear was at the first time you had trained at altitude? No, I kinda, I went there a few times and you know, I like it, you know, the first few weeks is, it was hard, you know, it was really hard. He get tired fast and, um, but I did like it. But when you come back down to c level, you, you feel the benefit. I feel the benefit, the I ca last more, you know, more oxygen and your body, your brain. Yeah, for sure. Now, um, when you go to Mexico, do you know what altitude you're going to be up up there? There's gonna be high in altitude too cause there's like a point of diminishing returns. So people feel like once you get above like 6,000, 7,000, 8,000, the idea is that you can't work hard enough cause there's just not enough air.

Speaker 1:          52:22          Like they think that 5,000 is like the perfect line. There's a lot of weird this, this, you know, people have had different philosophies when it comes to training at altitude and now many people feel like you should actually live at altitude but you should train at sea level because they think that you, when you train at sea level, you could put out more output, you could do more work and then you go and live up at altitude so your body acclimates to the low oxygen and you develop more red blood cells. And that makes sense. Yeah. So we thought about doing something like that or you're just going to stay up there. Yeah, I'm just going to stay out there just for a few months, you know, and a few months and come back down, finish, finish it up, finish the camp for like a month and go where I'm going to fight that I can say, well you're in such a great position man and you're only 29 years old.

Speaker 1:          53:11          So like your athletic prime, particularly as a heavyweight is like yo like three or four years away from your prime, which is really crazy. And that's a good thing. You know, I'm still young. I never had big wars. You know, I never been hurt things to, you know, and every fight that I have, you know, always pray for me and the guy that I'm fighting. No, cause I won both of us who go with our families. Cause I have two friends that have died from one, from a heat galleon, one from Costa Rica that I know personally. So it's scary man. It's really scary. It most certainly is. I mean there's no getting away from that man. It's, it's, it's a fucking scares me more. When you think about your career, do you have longterm goals? Do you have like a day that you like a time where you want to get out of this?

Speaker 1:          53:56          You know what? I wanted to retire when I was 35 years old and I'm, I said that on a piece of paper. Like I like I was telling everybody to, if you want to join, if you want a goal or something, write it down and all that. And I said, I won't, I wanted to retire when I'm 35. So we'll see why in 35. I don't know, I just had it. That number seems like a good number. What do you think you would do if you weren't boxing? Um, do the houses. Mom, my dad is a contractor. So, uh, we, we buy lots and we make houses from scratch and now, and we sell them, we resell them or we rent them out and or make, uh, a lot of apartments, you know, condos for the people that can really afford, what was that called?

Speaker 1:          54:36          My Dad does it. Low income houses, low income houses, um, apartments like that in my hometown, you know. Well, that's beautiful. But for fighters, the thrill of fighting is something that is impossible to recreate. It's almost like for a regular person to experience what you experienced when you knocked out Anthony. Joshua and Joshua gets counted off the referee waves his arms and you're like, oh shit. I started jumping like, oh my God, I grab it. You went nuts, man. But it'd been that feeling. You, you, you, all of a sudden you're the heavyweight champion of the world that, I mean, if you could sell that, that, look at that. Look at you right there, man. I felt like so many stuff, um, from my bag just came off, you know, cause so much pressure. So I'm like, oh yeah, man, stuff that was going through my mind.

Speaker 1:          55:27          I mean everybody was stunned. The home crowd was done, everybody was, but the crowd was on your side. It was really wild man. When you routine off on him and that the roars, the crowd and when it was over, when the referee just shook his hand and waved it off, like that high is what bleeds fighters back in the ring when they really shouldn't be. They chase that dragon. Yeah. And that's what I want to do, you know, make a statement that everything is possible. You know, all the fighters that, that have low confident or something in themselves, you know, anything is possible. Just work hard and know the opportunity will come. Do you think you'll ever train fighters? Me? You know, I think the only person that will train would probably be like my son or have first, you know, because it's not really good to be training the son and well it depends what kind of relationship you guys have, you know?

Speaker 1:          56:17          But, um, I think my son, I'll be trained. I'd rather be like a promoter or something like that. And your mouth promotions. I like Oscar. I sure will. Yeah. [inaudible] that's in the works. Arj Promotion. Oh, so you're a Knutson. Really? You're an [inaudible]. Oh, no, shit. Wow. That's rare. Where that's the plan. You know, first I want to focus on the fight and all that. I don't want to jump in conclusions of doing all kinds of other stuff. I want to focus in my flight and um, after that or when I want to retire, I want to get fighters from med school, giving them the opportunity and um, you know, learn, learn like Oscar the [inaudible]. Beautiful. That's beautiful, man. Yeah. Anything else? Anything else you want to tell people? Um, you know, just to tune in, uh, December in December. Anthony Joshua against Andrew Reese or n or [inaudible] versus Anthony.

Speaker 1:          57:07          Joshua [inaudible]. You're the top billing now, man. You're the champ. Thank you. Bye. Um, you know, uh, just gotta work hard, man. Work Hard, stay, stay humble. Say discipline and just focus on the, on the room match. Well, Andy, listen man, you're a great guy and a great role model. Thank you. I appreciate it. I think for young kids to look up to a guy like you who's a really nice guy, who's also a bad motherfucker, it makes him realize, hey, you know, you don't have to be a dickhead. You don't have to be mean. You can be a real cool dude who even prays for his opponent and still be the baddest motherfucker on the planet. Congratulations to you, sir. Thank you, man. Appreciate it very much, and good luck to you in December, having meetings coming up. We're going to be there, man. I'm going to give you some tickets. Shit. Oh Shit, man, that'd be there.
