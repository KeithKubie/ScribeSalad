00:00:04.417 --> 00:00:07.708
When I was a kid, the only companies that made games were the big ones.

00:00:07.708 --> 00:00:11.708
Now, it's two friends that come together in their free time and make games.

00:00:12.583 --> 00:00:15.375
One of the first great games we created was "The Balloons",

00:00:15.417 --> 00:00:16.667
which is an arcade-floater.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.042
The first thing everyone
who played it said was,

00:00:19.083 --> 00:00:21.333
It's difficult, impossible.
Nobody is actually enjoying it.

00:00:21.417 --> 00:00:22.500
Yes, we had an audience,

00:00:22.583 --> 00:00:25.917
but not soliciting feedback hurt us a lot.

00:00:26.125 --> 00:00:29.625
we should make things simpler and clearer first,

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.583
and then, growing is easier.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.375
One day, we came up with an idea of a cat and a piano.

00:00:36.458 --> 00:00:40.167
Joe thought:"How about when you poke the cat,

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.417
it'll go away and bring you back a small gift?"

00:00:42.458 --> 00:00:46.417
And we said, "Oh, it's so simple! It may work."

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
"KleptoCats" is a virtual pet

00:00:49.083 --> 00:00:51.958
that doesn't need you to take any kind of responsibility.

00:00:52.125 --> 00:00:55.125
The game is very simple, you have a cat and an empty room.

00:00:55.292 --> 00:00:57.125
You poke it and tell it to leave.

00:00:57.208 --> 00:00:59.292
The cat leaves and says, "I'll be back soon",

00:00:59.375 --> 00:01:00.833
and it comes back with a surprise.

00:01:01.875 --> 00:01:04.542
For our players, to keep them playing,

00:01:04.833 --> 00:01:10.375
we try to optimize the essence of fun and what it is that makes games interesting today.

00:01:10.458 --> 00:01:12.625
We believe there are these moments

00:01:12.917 --> 00:01:15.917
when the surprise is brought to you that generate a lot of emotion in the game.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.375
Which kind of represents gacha machines,

00:01:18.417 --> 00:01:20.750
where something falls and it's a surprise.

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.417
We have a very close relationship with our users.

00:01:24.458 --> 00:01:27.750
We read all their comments. We read everything they tell us.

00:01:28.083 --> 00:01:30.250
And we always take that into account.

00:01:30.458 --> 00:01:32.083
We always launch on Android first

00:01:32.125 --> 00:01:34.083
because it provides us with the early access platform.

00:01:34.125 --> 00:01:37.125
"KleptoCats 2" is part of the early access platform,

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.708
which has helped us a lot as fans appreciate

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.625
that they're part of the process.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.833
They feel united with us when making the game.

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.667
I remember at some point

00:01:47.708 --> 00:01:50.208
we had an argument over which icon was better.

00:01:50.417 --> 00:01:54.125
We had an icon we liked, but apparently the users didn't like it so much.

00:01:54.208 --> 00:01:56.708
We decided to use A/B Testing on the Store listingâ€¦

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.000
and when we did the tests between the different icons

00:01:59.125 --> 00:02:02.125
we saw our app downloads increased by 30%.

00:02:03.125 --> 00:02:08.292
We're adding people to the family to help us develop more and more games.

00:02:08.583 --> 00:02:12.208
Our future plan is "KleptoDogs",which is "KleptoCats" but with dogs.

00:02:12.292 --> 00:02:14.750
Our fans have asked for this,so let's see what happens.

00:02:16.125 --> 00:02:19.042
I think the funniest and most difficult thing

00:02:19.125 --> 00:02:21.875
for Latin American developers when launching games,

00:02:22.125 --> 00:02:23.792
is actually the simple aspect of launching the game.

00:02:25.083 --> 00:02:26.000
Make games.

00:02:26.125 --> 00:02:28.333
Don't stop making games.And don't take too long to make them.

00:02:28.417 --> 00:02:30.000
You don't have to create a masterpiece.

00:02:30.125 --> 00:02:32.625
Learn step by step with each iteration and feedback you're getting

00:02:32.875 --> 00:02:35.250
and your work will eventually pay off.
