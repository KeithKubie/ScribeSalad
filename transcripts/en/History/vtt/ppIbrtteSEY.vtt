Hold on, son!

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.830
NARRATOR: In the
bayou, it's always

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:05.330
easy to find the swamp man.

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:06.730
This son of a bitch

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:08.170
[bleep]

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:10.030
[bleep]

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.870
Oh god, really?

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.330
NARRATOR: Just follow
the trail of destruction

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.500
he leaves behind.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.400
Now, even when the
swamp man is just

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.730
trying to do a little work--

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.430
Hey, what the hell you doing?

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.030
NARRATOR: Accidents can happen.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:28.830
What the hell
you doing, Shelby?

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:29.530
This [inaudible]

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.970
[bleep]

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.170
You ain't seen my truck there?

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.370
Oh my God.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.230
You got pay me the
son of bitch now.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.570
NARRATOR: But Shelby always
tries to make amends.

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:42.670
Let me see if
I can get it off.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.500
[laughing]

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.700
I got to pay for it anyways!

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:02.630
How's that?

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.530
Got it back on the
road for you, man.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.000
Hold on, wait.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.930
Go go go go.

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.630
NARRATOR: Now,
sometimes, the swamp man

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.130
makes a slight miscalculation.
- Hey!

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:29.570
You all right?

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:30.430
I'll get it.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:31.730
You need to relax a little bit.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:32.570
Don't let it get you.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.430
We can fix it.
- Oh, yeah.

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:35.300
We can fix it.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.330
Oh yeah.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.370
[inaudible]

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.930
NARRATOR: But he's
quick to find a solution

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.100
and make everything good as new.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.330
Oh yeah!

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:00.570
Turtle soup tonight.

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.000
NARRATOR: Shelby's been known to
go where others fear to tread.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.470
[inaudible]

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.530
whether he should be
going there or not.

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.370
That don't like
like the trail.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:20.870
Oh, oh.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.430
Can it go through here?

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.100
I'm pretty sure
you can make it.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.430
Hold on.
Hold on.

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.030
Oh my God.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.830
- All right!
- Whoa!

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.330
Oh-- [bleep]

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.970
[inaudible]

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.570
NARRATOR: But sometimes
when you go off roading--

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.070
Come here and turn
this son of bitch over.

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.830
You all right?

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.000
Yeah.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.200
Yeah, I'm all right.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.870
NARRATOR: You just gotta
dust yourself off and get

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.230
right back behind the wheel.

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.370
Oh, my leg hurts.

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.400
Jenny, you better
go ready go get some.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.670
Here we go, Popeye!

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:15.730
Take it easy this time?

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:16.670
All right, we got it.

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.570
Does it still move?

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:22.530
Oh, come on, Shelby.

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.470
Stinks, I know.

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.430
You got to get it.

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.870
NARRATOR: Now, the swamp
man makes a mess quicker

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.800
than a pig in a porta potty.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.900
But when it comes
time to clean up,

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.570
he knows just the place to go.

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.630
- This is like a bubble bath.
- Yeah.

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.200
- Hey!
- All in that hair.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.200
Out of the way.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.700
Chill, man.

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.100
[interposing voices]

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.570
We got to get to the blow dry.

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.170
Let me dry your hair.

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:03.370
You don't know how that
work that son of a bitch.

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.700
Give me that bath.
- Hey, yo!

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.400
I'm forgetting my quarters.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.330
