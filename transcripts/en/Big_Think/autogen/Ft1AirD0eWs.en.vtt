the one that was my most memorable

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370
the one that was my most memorable
 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.339
the one that was my most memorable
probably one of the first experiments

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349
probably one of the first experiments
 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.499
probably one of the first experiments
was was a little bit later in life was

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509
was was a little bit later in life was
 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.060
was was a little bit later in life was
with starting zoos in my when I was I

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070
with starting zoos in my when I was I
 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.140
with starting zoos in my when I was I
don't know 13 14 and I was this was for

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150
don't know 13 14 and I was this was for
 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.730
don't know 13 14 and I was this was for
science fair project and I was a total

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740
science fair project and I was a total
 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.590
science fair project and I was a total
science partner growing up and did

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600
science partner growing up and did
 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.429
science partner growing up and did
science first every year and loved it

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:27.439
science first every year and loved it
 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:34.520
science first every year and loved it
and I I was researching this this drug

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530
and I I was researching this this drug
 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.530
and I I was researching this this drug
called melatonin and it was kind of

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540
called melatonin and it was kind of
 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.160
called melatonin and it was kind of
interested in its properties in terms of

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170
interested in its properties in terms of
 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.380
interested in its properties in terms of
affecting the circadian rhythms and

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390
affecting the circadian rhythms and
 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.260
affecting the circadian rhythms and
pineal gland of these unicellular

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270
pineal gland of these unicellular
 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.360
pineal gland of these unicellular
organisms called raw defers so raw

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370
organisms called raw defers so raw
 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.500
organisms called raw defers so raw
defers are basically these like black

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510
defers are basically these like black
 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.660
defers are basically these like black
blobs the globe they're growing swamps

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670
blobs the globe they're growing swamps
 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.810
blobs the globe they're growing swamps
and so I decided to take this room off

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820
and so I decided to take this room off
 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.490
and so I decided to take this room off
of our kitchen and turn it into my lab

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500
of our kitchen and turn it into my lab
 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.110
of our kitchen and turn it into my lab
not to everyone's great pleasure in my

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120
not to everyone's great pleasure in my
 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.420
not to everyone's great pleasure in my
house and had these petri dishes set up

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430
house and had these petri dishes set up
 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.009
house and had these petri dishes set up
with different raw defers and I would

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019
with different raw defers and I would
 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.899
with different raw defers and I would
sort of put different amounts of

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909
sort of put different amounts of
 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.070
sort of put different amounts of
melatonin and different amounts of

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080
melatonin and different amounts of
 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.270
melatonin and different amounts of
different chemicals and so we created

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280
different chemicals and so we created
 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.090
different chemicals and so we created
this little kind of lab set up with a

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100
this little kind of lab set up with a
 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.609
this little kind of lab set up with a
microscope and that was one of the first

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619
microscope and that was one of the first
 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.429
microscope and that was one of the first
signs were projects turning the kitchen

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439
signs were projects turning the kitchen
 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.530
signs were projects turning the kitchen
into a microbiology lab I always don't

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540
into a microbiology lab I always don't
 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.700
into a microbiology lab I always don't
want to be in science I think from an

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710
want to be in science I think from an
 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.760
want to be in science I think from an
early age from Hawaii 13 14 from from

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770
early age from Hawaii 13 14 from from
 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.350
early age from Hawaii 13 14 from from
just kind of fooling around in the

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360
just kind of fooling around in the
 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.890
just kind of fooling around in the
backyard and you know causing things to

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900
backyard and you know causing things to
 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.880
backyard and you know causing things to
blow up or to cut catch on fire to look

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890
blow up or to cut catch on fire to look
 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.260
blow up or to cut catch on fire to look
at something under a microscope or look

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270
at something under a microscope or look
 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.960
at something under a microscope or look
at something like a magnifying glass

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970
at something like a magnifying glass
 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.460
at something like a magnifying glass
just kind of see watching looking at

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470
just kind of see watching looking at
 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.740
just kind of see watching looking at
ants I mean that was highly pleasurable

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750
ants I mean that was highly pleasurable
 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.390
ants I mean that was highly pleasurable
you know lifting up this rock that we

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400
you know lifting up this rock that we
 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.490
you know lifting up this rock that we
had and there was always just a ton of

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500
had and there was always just a ton of
 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.690
had and there was always just a ton of
ants and seeing how they would move

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700
ants and seeing how they would move
 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.700
ants and seeing how they would move
around and kind of build a little

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710
around and kind of build a little
 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.490
around and kind of build a little
community down there it always

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500
community down there it always
 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.760
community down there it always
fascinated me I loved looking at

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770
fascinated me I loved looking at
 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.039
fascinated me I loved looking at
pictures of science and it was as much

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049
pictures of science and it was as much
 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.749
pictures of science and it was as much
the kind of aesthetics of science that

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759
the kind of aesthetics of science that
 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.340
the kind of aesthetics of science that
appealed to me as anything else I've

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350
appealed to me as anything else I've
 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.609
appealed to me as anything else I've
always been fascinated by how science

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619
always been fascinated by how science
 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.190
always been fascinated by how science
looks the architecture and design of

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200
looks the architecture and design of
 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.590
looks the architecture and design of
science as much as the more

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600
science as much as the more
 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.859
science as much as the more
philosophical ideas in science in fact

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869
philosophical ideas in science in fact
 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.840
philosophical ideas in science in fact
it was an image of a protein

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850
it was an image of a protein
 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.150
it was an image of a protein
was done to an x-ray crystallography so

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160
was done to an x-ray crystallography so
 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.640
was done to an x-ray crystallography so
basically looking at the structure of a

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650
basically looking at the structure of a
 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.860
basically looking at the structure of a
protein of this particular protein

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870
protein of this particular protein
 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.330
protein of this particular protein
that's responsible for how our cells

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340
that's responsible for how our cells
 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.330
that's responsible for how our cells
adhere to one another and it turned out

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340
adhere to one another and it turned out
 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.320
adhere to one another and it turned out
that this molecule looks like a zipper

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330
that this molecule looks like a zipper
 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.400
that this molecule looks like a zipper
zipper in between ourselves sort of a

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410
zipper in between ourselves sort of a
 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.200
zipper in between ourselves sort of a
molecular zipper and it was seeing an

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210
molecular zipper and it was seeing an
 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:33.970
molecular zipper and it was seeing an
image an x-ray crystallography image of

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980
image an x-ray crystallography image of
 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.230
image an x-ray crystallography image of
that protein complex that got me on a

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.240
that protein complex that got me on a
 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.760
that protein complex that got me on a
path for a few years of doing

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770
path for a few years of doing
 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.100
path for a few years of doing
biochemical research and cancer research

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110
biochemical research and cancer research
 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.780
biochemical research and cancer research
it was an image it was sort of the

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790
it was an image it was sort of the
 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.220
it was an image it was sort of the
architecture of this protein that was

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230
architecture of this protein that was
 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.280
architecture of this protein that was
just so compelling and overwhelmingly

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290
just so compelling and overwhelmingly
 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.040
just so compelling and overwhelmingly
satisfying and kind of a visceral for a

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050
satisfying and kind of a visceral for a
 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.880
satisfying and kind of a visceral for a
romantic way an aesthetic way that led

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890
romantic way an aesthetic way that led
 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.650
romantic way an aesthetic way that led
me to then try to understand it further

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660
me to then try to understand it further
 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.500
me to then try to understand it further
in in a more you know deeply biochemical

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510
in in a more you know deeply biochemical
 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.800
in in a more you know deeply biochemical
way so it's always been as much the

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810
way so it's always been as much the
 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.050
way so it's always been as much the
language and aesthetics and culture of

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060
language and aesthetics and culture of
 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.880
language and aesthetics and culture of
science as it has been the actual

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890
science as it has been the actual
 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.300
science as it has been the actual
scientific ideas themselves that have

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310
scientific ideas themselves that have
 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:19.870
scientific ideas themselves that have
excited me

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880
