00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.050 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ryan Reft: Hi, thanks for coming.

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:25.350
I'm Ryan Reft.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.200
I am a historian in the Manuscript
Division here at the Library.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.620
My responsibility is to oversee
-- to be overly simplistic,

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.160
the 20th century collections we
have related to congress, law,

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.590
journalism, LGBT issues,
things like that.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.590
I have a counterpart who
does foreign policy as well.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.110
So, thank you for coming
to Rights and Resistance,

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.720
Civil Liberties During Wartime.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.560
We have a great panel here.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.080
First I just want to
get some thank yous out.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.730
One, thank you to the Madison
Council for its generous funding

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.900
of this exhibit, and to Mark Conner
and Sue Siegel in Development

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.360
for helping bring that funding.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.170
Thank you to Angela
Newburn in Public Events

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:06.470
for helping to organize this.

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:07.770 position:56%
I couldn't have done it without her.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.790
Also, to the Law Library,
James Martin,

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.690
who's here in attendance,
thank you for your help.

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.200
To the new librarian, Jane
Sanchez, the law librarian,

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.760
who was also was of great help.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.880 position:56%
And Donna Sokol and Isabel Di Costeo
[assumed spelling], who is no longer

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.790
with the Law Library but was
instrumental in the early stages.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.280
I also would just like to highlight
the fact that the Law Library is,

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.070
as one past law librarian
said, the crown jewel

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.550
in the Library of Congress, right?

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.330
The world's largest library.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:34.960
Over 2.5 million volumes.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.050
Do I got that correct, James
[assumed spelling], 2.5 mill?

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.310
And established in 1832
by an Act of Congress.

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.290
And I think its proximity in --

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.110
to Congress and just
the public's ability

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.700
to access it has made it
invaluable tool for the library.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.820
And I think when you combine it
with the Manuscript Division,

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.340
a little soft promotion here, it's
really perhaps the best collection

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.820
of U.S. legal history
that you will find.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.110
And the Manuscript Division
just -- just bear with me,

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.190
we have about two dozen
modern Supreme Court justice,

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.750
and when I say modern, 20th century
Supreme Court justice, collections.

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.760
Some of the more, you know, Robert
Jackson, Harlan Fiske Stone,

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.560
Thurgood Marshall, William O.
Douglas, the notorious RBG, and,

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.610
of course, Sandra Day
O'Connor, right?

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.890
Now, the latter two are not really
open yet but they will be one day.

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.200
And upcoming we have John Paul
Stevens opening up in 2020.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.980
And this July, July 24, for those,
the more intrepid researchers

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.270
in the audience, the Brennan
Papers Correspondence opens,

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.520
and you can even find
the correspondence

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.990
between a grizzled Justice
Brennan and a young,

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.540
naive future law professor
at the University of Chicago,

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.690
Geoffrey Stone, several
folders worth of correspondence.

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.600
A lot of bake -- a lot of
baking sales, right [laughter]?

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.760
Yeah. But that opens up.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.060
We hope that researchers
will enjoy that.

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.880
Now, in addition to that we
also have federal justices,

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.050
like J. Skelly Wright, Harold
Leventhal, Frank Johnson,

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.760
the legendary Robert Bork,
lawyers like Winn Newman,

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.150
who was at the head of
gender equality and pay,

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.850
in addition to Joseph Raul [assumed
spelling], who was head of the ADA

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.750
in the 50's and also a
pioneering civil rights lawyer.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.750
And finally, journalists
like Anthony Lewis.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.410
We are actually right now
processing a huge addition

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.170
to the Anthony Lewis Papers, and
Lewis is one of the premier kind

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.890
of journalists to cover the court.

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.330
And so with all adieu, I'll
thank my boss, Jim Hutson,

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.130
and my other boss, Jan Ruth.

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.430
Sue Siegel, thank you for coming.

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.220
She was also of great help in
organizing this this panel.

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.450
And Peggy Wagner, who wrote the
book for the World War I exhibit,

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.950
who turned me on to Geoffrey
Stone in the first place.

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.720
That sounds odd, but
she did [laughter].

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.140
So, how did I come to World War I?

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.470
I'll just give you a brief
overview and let Mary take over,

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.400
who is a far more -- offer you
far more substantial comments

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.700
than myself.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.710
I was lucky enough
to serve as lead --

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.000
as one of the lead curators
on the World War I exhibit,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.080
Echoes of the Great War, American
Experience of World War I.

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.670
The book version, which Peggy
Wagner, who is in the audience,

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.660
wrote, Peggy was a great help
to it, but also my colleague,

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.440
Sahr Conway-Lanz, who is
a 20th century historian

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.990
in the Manuscript Division
also was of --

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.230
just super great to work
with as a co-curator.

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.350
But also in the IPO, the
Interpretative Programs Office,

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:12.000
Cheryl Regan, Kim Curry, Betsy
Nahum-Miller were all just critical

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.630
in putting this together
and really helpful.

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.360
So, really a lot of talented
people working at the Library

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.420
who I mentioned already and just
wanted to thank them for that.

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.780
Now, I'm actually a
post '45 historian.

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.310
I worked a lot on housing

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.280
and all volunteer army,
and things like that.

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.720
So when I was assigned World
War I I didn't really know --

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.140
it's not that I didn't know what
to do, but I wasn't, you know,

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.360
super conversant on the subject.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.720
I think a lot of Americans
kind of could express that.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.020
So, you know, you do what you do.

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.320
You dig in.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.620
You read a lot.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:40.920
Did a lot of research
in our primary sources.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.190 position:56%
Talked to other historians, in
addition to those here on the panel,

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.720
and came up with, you know, what
we think was a good exhibit.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.180
Now there's two takeaways,
I would say,

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.570
from my experience
during World War I.

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.970
One is, we didn't want to
overplay World War I's significance

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.150 position:56%
on some level, because really,
World War II kind of closes the loop

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.850
that arguably, and
historians like to argue,

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.090
so arguably closes the loop
that World War I kind of opens.

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.410
But if there are two
or three things I'd say

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.640
that World War I definitely
accomplishes is, one,

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.710
is that a number of key
figures later in World War I --

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.670
serve in World War
I and prove critical

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:16.020
to 20th century developments later.

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.170 position:56%
So FDR, the secretary of the navy
who draws upon his experiences there

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:24.600
to create the new deal and then
obviously prosecute World War II.

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.690
Charles Hamilton Houston, who goes
to war, comes back really kind of,

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:29.990
embittered is not the right word,

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:31.930
but like critical social
consciousness about racism,

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.390 position:56%
goes to Harvard Law, becomes Dean
of Howard Law School, trains a cadre

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:37.940
of civil rights lawyers,
including Thurgood Marshall.

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:39.610
Did I mention we have his papers?

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:42.280
He brings -- he takes over the
NAAC -- well doesn't take over,

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:43.770
works in the NAACP in the '30s.

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.250
Kind of becomes one
of the architects

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:48.450
of their desegregation
planning, becomes the man

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:50.080
who killed Jim Crow and, of course,

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.110
brings Thurgood Marshall
into the NAACP.

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.190
Then you have Harlan Fiske
Stone and Felix Frankfurter,

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:57.670 position:56%
who Jeremy Kessler discusses in some
of work, who despite not really --

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:00.150
who were working for the government
in various ways but kind of come

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.830
to defying conscientious objector
status, which you may not think

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:05.700
of as a civil liberty but in
some ways really kind of is.

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:08.310
And, of course, then you have
the famous George Patton,

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:09.920
whose poems we have in the exhibit.

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.140
He did write poems
and they're fantastic.

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:15.210
He was a tank commander in
World War I, and obviously goes

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:17.960
on to World War II to
much greater acclaim.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.720
The second thing is the
issue of citizenship.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.890
World War I really comes to define,
or begins to define what it means

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:28.000
to be a modern citizen in the
U.S. What do I owe the government?

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.770
What does the government owe me?

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:31.490
And part of that is conscription.

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:35.920
You know, we did have a conscripted
army in the Civil War, but only 8%.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.380
World War I, 72% of the
army is conscripted.

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:41.510
And the idea of conscription itself
was something people had to reckon

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:43.110
with in terms of what it
meant for liberties, right?

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:46.900
And that brings us to the issue of
civil liberties and civil rights,

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:50.990
which are kind of dovetailed
within this idea of citizenship

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:52.580
and idea of conscription.

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:55.550
On the one hand you have the
creation of Civil Liberties Bureau,

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:59.650 position:56%
which will become famously the ACLU,
and you have the famous court cases,

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:01.980
these are just two, there are
others, Schenck versus U.S.,

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:04.580
Abrams versus U.S., where Justice
Holmes goes from -- in the --

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:08.950 position:56%
first the majority opinion, limiting
speech to clear and present danger

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:11.310
to being a [inaudible]
in Abrams and saying, no,

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:13.520
you need to let ideas play
out in the marketplace.

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.510
You know, a very --
a very sharp shift.

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:18.150
And our idea of civil liberties
today, and this is something

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:22.110
that Geoffrey Stone and David
Rabban talk about in their work,

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:23.600
is not necessarily the same idea

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.960
of civil liberties
prior to World War I.

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.820
And World War I had a lot to
do with not creating that,

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:30.120
but propelling these --

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:33.170
this movement to that end
-- that kind of end result.

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:35.980
Relatedly, just like you have
the ACLU that kind of pops

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:39.310
up during the war, NAACP,
we think of the NAACP

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:42.220
as a well-established
civil rights organization,

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:43.730
maybe the foundational
organization today,

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:46.860
but in 1917 it was only
a couple years old.

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:49.510
It increases six fold
during the war.

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:52.700
Veterans, this has to do
with conscription as well,

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:54.000
this is the first time
we have an office --

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.970
a black officer's training
camp is during the war.

00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:59.990
And despite the military being just
ranked with segregation and racism,

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:04.140
does at least create this
wartime service that enables men

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:06.130
like Charles H. Houston to come
back and dedicate their lives

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:07.870
to fighting for civil rights.

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:09.640
Now, the anti-lynching
campaigns that come

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:12.270
in the '20s are a direct
result of the NAACP's growth,

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:14.530
and because black veterans were
targeted when they returned

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:17.630
from the war for hostilities.

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:20.640
This is something that
Megan Ming Francis discusses

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:22.210
in her work as well.

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:26.410
So I think that we have a panel
here that's more than capable

00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:29.140
of discussing these issues in great
depth and with great interest.

00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:31.170 position:56%
I'll just give you a brief overview.

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:35.750
Mary Dudziak, Emery Professor
of Law, author of Wartime,

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:39.960
the award-winning Wartime, which
is really almost an existential

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:43.440
discussion of war, its meaning,
its influence on law and thought,

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:46.770
and it stretches from really
like roughly World War I

00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:48.560
through 9/11 I would
say, correct [laughter]?

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:54.290
She has no chance to answer so
I'm just going to keep moving on.

00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:56.060
In civil liberties --
in terms of civil --

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:57.360
and so Mary is going
to moderate here,

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:00.960
and I think she has this really
great grasp of the idea of war

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:04.240
and its implications legally and
even socially and politically

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:05.730
that I think will enable her

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:07.880
to really navigate a
really great discussion.

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:10.270
Geoffrey Stone obviously
wrote Perilous Times,

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:13.980
a book that was listed on
LA Times' best book award,

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:16.080
New York Times' notable book.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:19.500
It examines free speech
[inaudible] through 9/11,

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:21.380
but with a really cogent
chapter on World War I.

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:24.420
And I think he and David
Rabban, who wrote Free Speech

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:26.320
and its Forgotten Years,
really a foundational text

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:31.020
about the progressive era idea of
civil liberties and free speech,

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:34.470
and how really World War
I didn't create it so much

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:38.620
as create a flashpoint over which
these issues had really been the

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:42.220
domain of like sexual and political
radicals and laborer agitators,

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:45.700
and that changes during
the war and after the war.

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:49.750
And Megan Ming -- Jeremy
Kessler discusses the rise

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:52.760 position:56%
of the administrative state and mix,
in some ways I would argue, Jeremy,

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:55.370
is a somewhat counterintuitive
kind of argument in the sense

00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:58.590 position:56%
that you don't normally think of the
government as maybe being a pioneer

00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:01.030
in civil liberties, and yet
in Jeremy's law review article

00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:03.810
for Columbia makes the argument
that actually, you know,

00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:05.720
Harlan Fiske Stone and Felix
Frankfurter are at the forefront

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:07.070
of creating conscientious
objector status.

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:10.220
And in some ways because you create
conscription and these other laws,

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:13.860
and that the Espionage Act
kind of hinged its implications

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:15.830
on conscription, that
the administrative state

00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:18.110
that was created around it
did actually push forward

00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:22.610
in many ways civil liberties that
we would not think of in that way.

00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:26.830
And finally, Megan Ming Francis
talks about the NAACP in her book,

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:29.110
The Creation -- The Modern --

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:31.350
Civil Rights and the Making
of the Modern American State.

00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:35.250 position:56%
And everybody has used their papers,
but Megan used their NAACP papers,

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:37.140
which is something the Manuscript
Division is very, very proud of,

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:38.740
because it's just a
massive collection.

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:40.930
And I would just say --
tell people that what's

00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:42.930
on microfilm is a small
portion of the collection.

00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:44.970
You have -- there is so much
more in that collection.

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:47.080
It's so much richer than
people give her credit for.

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:49.120
But she -- it was written
about Woodrow Wilson,

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:51.720
the fight for the anti-lynching
legislation in the '20s,

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:56.240
and really kind of I think actually
juxtaposes the rise of the ACLU

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:58.270
with the expansion of the NAACP
in a very interesting way.

00:10:58.270 --> 00:10:59.940
Not that it's in her book, but
I think that the two things kind

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:03.090 position:56%
of parallel in development and ways
that I think we can explore further.

00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:05.390
And with that I'll
let Mary take over.

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:10.740
&gt;&gt; Mary Dudziak: Thank you so much.

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:16.620 position:56%
Ryan. I want to start by thanking,
I'm so thrilled to be at the Library

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:20.500
of Congress, and also at
an event that's sponsored

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:22.000
by the Manuscript Division.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.450 position:56%
And I have to say, historians across
the country and around the world

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:32.070
who use the collections
here are in your debt.

00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:35.440
It's not just that we are in your
debt for all the work it does

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:39.430
to organize archival
collections, make them accessible,

00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:43.570
advise us about where to look,
help us figure out how to deal

00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:47.780
with the index to Woodrow
Wilson's files, which in

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:52.340
and of itself could require, you
know, a lifetime of expertise.

00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:57.620
But really, the American
people are in your debt.

00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:00.460
American democracy is in your debt.

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:03.220
It's not just people
who care about history,

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:08.580 position:56%
but policymaking is based upon
ideas and assumptions about history.

00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:11.730
Politics are informed by history.

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:14.800
Legal developments are
informed by history.

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:18.620
And so the work that you
do is this foundation

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:20.720
that helps enable everything else.

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:24.160
So I feel privileged
to have an opportunity

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:25.980
to thank you for that today.

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:31.280
I also thank everybody else who,
it's kind of an exciting day

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:35.960 position:56%
in Washington, and I'm just so
happy that you either needed a break

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:39.570
from it or something
and decided to come.

00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:41.720
We really have a wonderful panel.

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:45.000 position:56%
All I want to do right now is just
to try to set the stage a little bit

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.160
and maybe ask a couple
of sort of questions,

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:51.750
not for them to deal with,
but for us to think about.

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:57.030
So let's go back to April of 1917.

00:12:57.030 --> 00:13:01.400
You know, first let me sort of
step back, 1916 election was one

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:04.450
of those elections so
close Woodrow Wilson went

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:07.160 position:56%
to bed having been told he had lost.

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:08.920
Only gets up in the morning to find

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:11.150
that Charles Evans Hughes
had lost the election

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:12.450
and Wilson got reelected.

00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:16.390
That was the election where
the Democratic Party ran

00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:19.910
on the slogan, he kept
us out of war.

00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:25.530
And my opinion, the best work on
the 1916 election says that, yes,

00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:29.450
war issues carried
Wilson over the top.

00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:33.950
It was that concern about war, not
just in Europe but also with Mexico

00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:38.750
that led to key votes for Wilson
in the west and in the mid-west.

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:43.910
So an antiwar perspective
helps decide the election,

00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:49.110
then how do we get to April
1917 and Wilson goes to Congress

00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:50.990
and asks for war declaration.

00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:55.200
After Wilson himself goes
through this torturous turn

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:58.340
that his biographer's call
Wilson's Gethsemane, you know,

00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:02.190
where Jesus prayed the night
before his death and his sweat was

00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:04.240
like drops of blood
falling on the ground.

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:06.430
I mean, it really --
read his letters.

00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:10.400
And he says to a friend,
my thought is under seize.

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:13.710
Even you don't understand
how difficult it is.

00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:15.130
So what happened?

00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:18.130
Well, lots of things
happened, but a crucial thing

00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:23.950 position:56%
that happens is Germany starts
doing unrestricted submarine warfare

00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:30.010
in the Atlantic announced
January 31, you know, February 1

00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:31.720
and then ships are being sunk.

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:34.920
Now there had been submarine
warfare in the Atlantic.

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:37.110
There had just been a deal
with the U.S. We're not going

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:38.680
to go after neutral shipping.

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:42.690
Germany says, nope,
everybody's fair game.

00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:47.500 position:56%
And the New York Times had on the
front page the ships that went down,

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:52.980
how many casualties, everybody
is watching it day by day.

00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:56.890
The -- and basically the
casualties, you know, step up.

00:14:56.890 --> 00:14:59.580
There's more to say about
this than I will right now,

00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:07.690
but it's in this moment when
Wilson, little by little,

00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:12.640
sort of comes to the idea
that the only response is

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:15.730
to turn towards war.

00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:19.560
Now, Wilson in asking
for a declaration

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:21.010
of war he basically says,

00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:26.130
in this context neutrality
is no longer feasible.

00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:30.000
Germany, he said, was
at war with all nations.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.940
So what was the U.S.
doing in going to war?

00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:38.210
Our object now is to vindicate the
principles of peace and justice

00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:39.800
and [inaudible] of the world

00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:43.930
as against selfish
and autocratic power.

00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:46.830
And probably the most
famous line is,

00:15:46.830 --> 00:15:50.170
the world must be made
safe for democracy.

00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:52.800
Now to accomplish U.S.
objectives in this war,

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:55.040
what did the United
States need to do?

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:56.340
Two things.

00:15:56.340 --> 00:16:01.080
All resources of government
had to be devoted to the war.

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:02.380
All resources.

00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:05.390
And that's a typical
thing presidents call for.

00:16:05.390 --> 00:16:11.070
He also demanded that the people
themselves be devoted to war.

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:15.560
He said in his speech, if there
should be disloyalty it will be

00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:19.460
dealt with with a firm
hand of stern repression.

00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:21.020
It's sort of a shocking sentence.

00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:25.110
It will be dealt with with a
firm hand of stern repression.

00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:28.170
He had been talking about
German Americans, but he says,

00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:32.050
most of them, they're loyal.

00:16:32.050 --> 00:16:35.950
But among German Americans and
others, the problems would come

00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:39.880
from what he called a
lawless and malignant view.

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:44.280
So dissenters, you see,
are lawless and malignant.

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:47.140
They're sort of a cancer
on the [inaudible].

00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:49.760
As his speech taught -- sought --

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:53.990
so as his speech sought to unite
Americans behind a grand purpose,

00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:57.440
he helped to lay the basis
for the marginalization

00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:59.720
and criminalization of dissent.

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:05.870 position:56%
In this way, even as he upheld
democracy as this global aspiration,

00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:10.860
he endangered a central bedrock
of democracy of free people,

00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:15.090
free to speak politically and free
to criticize their government.

00:17:15.090 --> 00:17:18.590
It's the -- it's the protection
of dissent that is a sort

00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:22.210
of a central aspect of
having a free government.

00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:26.700
Now when we gauge how well
American institutions have stood

00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:31.060
up to the pressures during wars,
generally American scholars,

00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:34.330
especially clinical scientists
and [inaudible] tend to sort

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:36.940
of compare wars against each other.

00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:40.680
Let's think about one president's
war power as compared to another,

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:43.140
and the Civil War gets
a lot of play in this.

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:46.500
And Lincoln's suspension of
the writ of habeas corpus

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:49.120
in the Civil War is a prime example

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:52.690
of presidents essentially
overrunning constitutional limits

00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:53.990
during war.

00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:56.870
Sometimes it's used as a way of
-- you know, it always happens.

00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:58.400
Don't worry so much.

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:00.640 position:56%
It'll all go back to normal someday.

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:03.050 position:56%
Okay, so when we think about that --

00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:06.190
these examples, what
kinds of pres --

00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:13.560
which kinds of presidential actions
are justifiable, and the context

00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:16.180
of these decisions matters a lot?

00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:21.860
So Lincoln's 1861 suspension of
the writ of habeas corpus came

00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:26.260
when Confederate sympathizers
threatened supply lines

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:29.620
through Maryland to the
District of Columbia.

00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:35.190
The Civil War, as a whole, of
course, obviously happened here.

00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:37.350
It happened here.

00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:42.680
And so Lincoln is acting to protect
the ability of the government

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:46.780
to function to get food and
other supplies into Washington,

00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:51.860
D.C. Compare this with 1917.

00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:55.560 position:56%
Now the war was happening elsewhere.

00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:59.440
It wasn't happening within
the territorial U.S. at all.

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:01.880
American supply lines,
were they threatened?

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:05.600
Well, the ability of American
companies to ship goods overseas

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:07.720
and the United States
companies were trading

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:10.720
with everybody to ship
goods overseas.

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:15.630
That was cut off and there was
ships backed up in the harbors.

00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:20.760
And ship companies were, after
Woodrow Wilson saying, what --

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:24.970
you got to do something,
because we can't sail anywhere.

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:31.370
There was also a threat
to American lives.

00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:33.020
And at one point Lincoln says,

00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:36.200
if Germany does anything
we're going to do something.

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:39.370
And he didn't really say what.

00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:43.230 position:56%
And he didn't say what the something
was that would generate more action,

00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:49.180
but it caused the world to focus on
Wilson and to watch every sinking.

00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:54.720
First death was a working
man about three days

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:56.510
after the German announcement,

00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:59.840
African American merchant
sailor killed

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:02.460
on I believe it was a British ship.

00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:08.810
And that wasn't the act that would
drive Wilson to call for a war.

00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:12.000
But these deaths sort of
started to accumulate.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.690 position:56%
So the Americans who were threatened
were people who worked on ships.

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:18.400
They were ship captains,

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:23.630
and probably the largest number was
basically working-class laborers

00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:28.280
who worked in the boiler room,
including many men of color.

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:32.720 position:56%
And then there was another
category, Americans who freely chose

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:38.670
to travel, often to sail on
fancy British ocean liners,

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:42.950
ocean liners that had contraband
in the hole and were armed.

00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:45.570
In other words, they are warships.

00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:48.730
They are fair targets.

00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:51.030
The --

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:59.620
And the deaths that then sort
of motivate the press coverage

00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:03.500 position:56%
and the emotional tenor of
American politics, it's actually not

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:09.810
about the working men, it's
about the society ladies

00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:14.430
and wealthy travelers choosing
to make a trip across a war zone

00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:18.840
on ships that are fair
targets, and that's the overact

00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:22.500
that basically helped shift the,
again, the sort of emotional tenor

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:27.020
of American politics
at this point in time.

00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:29.770
But -- and then when the U.S.
enters the war, what does it do?

00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:32.300
Let's protect the oceans.

00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:34.940
Let's have safe lanes
for American ships.

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:38.190
It sounds like we need
to have a naval war

00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:40.750
to protect American
interests in the Atlantic.

00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:44.550
Well, instead, the U.S. jumps
all the way in and, of course,

00:21:44.550 --> 00:21:49.060 position:56%
Wilson in part has his broader goals
for the world community in mind,

00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:52.920
wanting to be at the table in
Paris at the end of the war.

00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:58.180
That's achieved by sending
American troops to Europe.

00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:04.130
American shipping in the Atlantic
might well have been managed

00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:07.440 position:56%
through a narrower U.S. involvement.

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:11.480
So there's lots of interesting
questions about how the U.S. got

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:14.330
to where it got to with
this sort of full engagement

00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:16.950
for a limited period
of time in World War I.

00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:22.510
Now, when we think about World
War I and the suppression

00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:27.150
of civil liberties, we need to keep
in mind, I think, that this isn't

00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:29.960
like Lincoln's experience.

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:34.330 position:56%
And when we have a war somewhere
else that's then producing this sort

00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:37.580
of domestic political
environment, where does that come

00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:39.200
from and what's driving it?

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:43.480 position:56%
It's not just war per se happens
and then there's a reaction at home.

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:46.040
And the sort of best work I
think in political science

00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:49.190
about public reactions to
war says it's not actually --

00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:53.710
it's not war per se that does
it, it's the way war gets talked

00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:56.860
about in elite discourse
and partisan politics.

00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:58.910
So it's basically a
domestic political

00:22:58.910 --> 00:23:03.750
and social phenomenon that's
driving the domestic reaction.

00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:06.280
At least that's an argument.

00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:10.960
The legacy of World War I, which is
tremendously important in the law

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:18.010
and policy community, the
legacy is -- matters so much.

00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:22.260 position:56%
Eventually we get this growth of
this law of civil liberties and a --

00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:25.650
and a flourishing civil
liberties tradition in spite

00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:30.760
of its coexistence with
continuing forms of oppression,

00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:35.010
including race discrimination
and segregation.

00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:39.940
On these issues there are many
productive points of disagreement,

00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:43.530
or at least difference
among our speakers today,

00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:47.260
on whether the federal government
helped or hindered the development

00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:51.720
of civil liberties on the role of
social movements and organizations,

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:56.140
like the NAACP and the ACLU
on the history of ideas,

00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:58.960
a tremendously important
and rich area of study,

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:02.250
and on the role of the course.

00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:04.580
And so with that, I'd
like to turn this

00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:07.880
over to Geoff Stone
to get us started.

00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:14.500
[ Applause ]

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:18.340
&gt;&gt; Geoffrey Stone: Thanks.

00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:20.420
I want to talk a bit about
the issues of free speech,

00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:23.870
free press during World War I.

00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:27.840
During the First World War there
were more than 2000 prosecutions

00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:31.420
of individuals for criticizing
the war or the draft.

00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:35.410
Sentences of those ranged
up to 20 years in prison.

00:24:35.410 --> 00:24:38.920
Any person who had the audacity
to make such statements,

00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:42.740
whether in a speech, in a book,
in a newspaper, or in a pamphlet,

00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:45.840
were subject to prosecution
and conviction.

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:49.580 position:56%
Those prosecuted included
journalists, politicians, activists,

00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:53.460 position:56%
members of the clergy, and
ordinary citizens across the nation.

00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:55.940
They even included Eugene
Debs, who had received more

00:24:55.940 --> 00:25:00.320
than a million votes for
president in the 1912 election.

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:02.130
The vast majority of
these convictions were

00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:05.700
for violating the Espionage
Act of 1917.

00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:10.370
Now, the Espionage Act of 1917
was directed primarily at acts

00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:15.350
of espionage and acts directed at
the protection of military secrets.

00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:19.180
But section three of the act also
made it a crime for any person to,

00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:24.210 position:56%
quote, cause or attempt to cause
insubordination, disloyalty, mutiny,

00:25:24.210 --> 00:25:28.290
or refusal of duty in the military
services of the United State,

00:25:28.290 --> 00:25:30.210
or to willfully obstruct or --

00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:34.630
the recruiting and enlistment
service of the United States.

00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:37.540
Now on its face, that
provision would not seem

00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:40.750
to forbid newspaper
articles, speeches, pamphlets,

00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:45.160 position:56%
and the like that did nothing more
than criticize the war or the draft.

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:48.840
But the federal courts, with but
a few exceptions, interpreted

00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:52.530
and applied the Act as making
it crime for any person

00:25:52.530 --> 00:25:55.410
to make any statement that
might have even a tendency

00:25:55.410 --> 00:25:58.260
to turn people against the war.

00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:01.260
Because of that interpretation,
any criticism of the war

00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:04.140
or the draft was deemed
unlawful resulting

00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:08.950 position:56%
in the most aggressively speech
suppressive era in American history.

00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:11.540
Now, those who were prosecuted
under the Espionage Act

00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:15.510
for their speech tended to raise
one of two, or both, objections.

00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:20.500
First, that the Act should not be
interpreted to reach the speech

00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:21.800
in which they had engaged.

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:25.160
And second, and if the Act were
interpreted to reach the speech

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:29.510
with which they engaged it
violated the First Amendment.

00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:31.940
Both objections were, with
only a few exceptions,

00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:34.330 position:56%
emphatically rejected by the courts,

00:26:34.330 --> 00:26:37.280
including the Supreme
Court of the United States.

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:40.520
I'd like to focus in my
few minutes on the question

00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:42.500 position:56%
of the meaning of the Espionage Act.

00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:44.040
And I'm sure we'll have
an opportunity to talk

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:45.900
about the First Amendment
issues later.

00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:49.780
So in the months leading up
to the United States entry

00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:54.840
into World War I, there was fierce
opposition to that possibility.

00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:58.290
The American people were
divided about the war.

00:26:58.290 --> 00:27:00.870
Many Americans did not
understand what the war

00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:04.030
in Europe was all about, and
many of them had no desire

00:27:04.030 --> 00:27:06.020
to send their sons off to die

00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:09.560
in what seemed a senseless
and brutal conflict.

00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:12.070
Many thought, in short, that
the United States had no dog

00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:15.140
in this fight, and that the best
course for the nation was simply

00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:19.560 position:56%
to stand aside and let the Europeans
fight it out among themselves.

00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:22.790
President Woodrow Wilson,
though, who, as you heard,

00:27:22.790 --> 00:27:26.860
had been elected -- reelected
president in 1916 on the platform

00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:29.990
that he had kept us out
of war, had other ideas.

00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:33.570
And by early 1917 he had come
to the conclusion that our entry

00:27:33.570 --> 00:27:35.730
into the war was inevitable.

00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:39.360
But Wilson understood he
faced a serious dilemma.

00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:42.400
And that dilemma was the
lack of public support.

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:44.300
It's difficult to fight
a war successfully

00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:47.130
if you do not have the
support of your people.

00:27:47.130 --> 00:27:51.770 position:56%
To address the widespread opposition
to our entry into the war, Wilson;

00:27:51.770 --> 00:27:54.210
therefore, launched
two types of programs.

00:27:54.210 --> 00:27:57.090
The first, called the Community
for Public Information,

00:27:57.090 --> 00:28:00.140
was a propaganda program
run out of the White House.

00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:05.260
It was essentially designed with
the task of demonizing the enemy

00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:08.170
across the nation and
whipping up a war fervor

00:28:08.170 --> 00:28:13.820
by basically having editorials and
speeches and pamphlets and posters

00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:17.120
that showed how horrible the
enemy was and how essential it was

00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:20.660
to American freedom
to fight in this war.

00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:23.850
But Wilson understood that
wouldn't be sufficient to deal

00:28:23.850 --> 00:28:26.390
with the dissent that was
going on in the country.

00:28:26.390 --> 00:28:28.060
And he; therefore,
needed legislation

00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:29.840
that would silence that dissent.

00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:33.680
Now, the United States government
had not enacted federal legislation

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:37.100
making it a crime to criticize the
government of the United States

00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:39.920
since the Sedition Act of 1798,

00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:42.910
an episode that had been
roundly condemned over the course

00:28:42.910 --> 00:28:44.930
of the following century.

00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:47.760
Indeed having learned the
painful lessons of that history,

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:50.830
the United States had intentionally
refrained from enacting

00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:54.450
such legislation during the war
of 1812, during the Civil War,

00:28:54.450 --> 00:28:56.780 position:56%
and during the Spanish American War.

00:28:56.780 --> 00:29:01.370 position:56%
Nonetheless, in lead up to our entry
into World War I, Wilson decided

00:29:01.370 --> 00:29:03.730
that aggressive legislation
was necessary

00:29:03.730 --> 00:29:06.120
to stifle criticism of his war.

00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:09.870
Thus, Wilson called upon Congress
to enact legislation, quote,

00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:12.150
to suppress disloyal activities.

00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:15.620
The Department of Justice proposed
to Congress the initial version

00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:19.580
of Espionage Act, which included
a provision declaring it unlawful

00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:24.570
for any person in time of war
to publish any information

00:29:24.570 --> 00:29:28.450 position:56%
that the president, in his judgment,
deemed to be of such character

00:29:28.450 --> 00:29:31.220
that it might be harmful to
the interests of the nation.

00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:35.010
This proposal triggered
a firestorm of protest.

00:29:35.010 --> 00:29:38.300
The American Newspaper Association
declared that the provision, quote,

00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:42.010 position:56%
strikes at the fundamental rights of
the American people, and newspapers

00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:45.600
across the land condemned it as
oppression as a glaring attempt

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:48.610
to muzzle free speech, and as an
effort to suppress the freedom

00:29:48.610 --> 00:29:52.320
of the press and the freedom people
of the to express on its judgments

00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:54.600
on the acts of public servants.

00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:57.830
Members of Congress from both
parties similarly condemned the

00:29:57.830 --> 00:29:59.290
proposed legislation.

00:29:59.290 --> 00:30:02.690
Senator Johnson of California, for
example, charged that the, quote,

00:30:02.690 --> 00:30:06.000
preservation of free speech
is of transcendent importance,

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.180
especially in times
of national stress.

00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:11.630
And Representative Madden of
Illinois protested that, quote,

00:30:11.630 --> 00:30:14.630
while you're fighting to establish
the democracy of the world,

00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:16.690
we ought not to do the very thing

00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:20.410
that will establish
autocracy in America.

00:30:20.410 --> 00:30:23.940
Although Wilson then made a
direct appeal to Congress arguing

00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:26.780
that such authority, quote,
is absolutely necessary

00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:30.460
to the public safety, Congress
nonetheless defeated the proposed

00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:33.600
legislation by an overwhelming
majority.

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:38.720
Thereafter, Congress enacted what
became the Espionage Act of 1917,

00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:41.370
with its much more
narrowly focused provisions

00:30:41.370 --> 00:30:43.910
which were directed
specifically at speech intended

00:30:43.910 --> 00:30:47.110
to cause insubordination
in the military

00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:49.360
or to cause obstruction
of the draft.

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:55.260
As enacted, this legislation was
not designed as a broadside attack

00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:56.670
on all criticism of the war,

00:30:56.670 --> 00:31:00.240
but it's a carefully considered
enactment designed to deal

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:03.110
with very specific
military concerns.

00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:07.200
Wilson's attorney general, Charles
Gregory, was bitterly disappointed,

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:09.600
complaining that Congress
had taken the teeth

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:13.330
out of the legislation
we attempted to enact.

00:31:13.330 --> 00:31:17.010
Nonetheless, with the advent of the
war federal judges across the land,

00:31:17.010 --> 00:31:19.600
acting at the insistence and
encouragement of the Department

00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:21.650
of Justice and of the
Executive Branch,

00:31:21.650 --> 00:31:24.760
interpreted these provisions
very broadly.

00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:28.690
Basically they held that any
speech that criticized the war

00:31:28.690 --> 00:31:31.980
and the draft could have
the tendency to turn people

00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:34.850
against the war and;
therefore, could lead people

00:31:34.850 --> 00:31:37.630
to refuse induction into
the military and could lead

00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:41.160
to insubordination on the part
of individuals in the military.

00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:42.630
And; therefore, it
had a bad tendency

00:31:42.630 --> 00:31:44.870
which would cause these effects.

00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:48.580
But said, the defendants, the
statute talks about intent

00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:49.880
to cause content obstruction,

00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:52.280
intent to cause insubordination,
that wasn't our intent.

00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:55.160
Our intent was to criticize
the war and the draft.

00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:57.200
The court said, doesn't matter.

00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:59.050
You're held to have
intended the natural

00:31:59.050 --> 00:32:01.800
and foreseeable consequences
of your speech.

00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:03.200
And since this was
one of the natural

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:07.410
and foreseeable consequences you
can be punished under the statute.

00:32:07.410 --> 00:32:10.190
Only a few judges resisted.

00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:13.900
The most famous of these,
Learned Hand in the Masses case,

00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:17.870
wrote a memorable opinion in which
held that in light of the history

00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:21.870
of free speech on issues of
war in the United States,

00:32:21.870 --> 00:32:24.770
and legislative history
in the Congress,

00:32:24.770 --> 00:32:28.310
that he would interpret the
Espionage Act as applying only

00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:32.750
to speech that expressly
incited obstruction of the draft

00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:36.380
or insubordination in the military,
and that speech that stops short

00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:39.250
of expressly encouraging
people who refuse induction

00:32:39.250 --> 00:32:40.800
or expressly encouraging them

00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:44.650
to be insubordinate was
not prohibited by the Act.

00:32:44.650 --> 00:32:46.780
That was short lived, however.

00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:50.370
His opinion in Masses was promptly
overruled by the Court of Appeals,

00:32:50.370 --> 00:32:52.750
and Hand himself was punished.

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:56.620
He had been awaiting a promotion to
the Court of Appeals that was put

00:32:56.620 --> 00:32:59.890
in abeyance and he remained on the
District Court for another decade,

00:32:59.890 --> 00:33:03.070
in part as punishment
for his opinion.

00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:07.200
Indeed a year later, in 1918,
now in the heat of war fever,

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:10.040
Congress enacted the
Sedition Act of 1918,

00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:12.860
which finally gave the Wilson
administration what it had wanted

00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:14.160
all along.

00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:17.360
The Sedition Act made it a crime,
among other things, quote, to utter

00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:21.890
or to publish any disloyal language
intended to cause contempt or scorn

00:33:21.890 --> 00:33:24.460
for the government of the
United States, the Constitution,

00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:27.720
or the flag, or to utter any
language opposing the cause

00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:30.140 position:56%
of the United States in time of war.

00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:34.510
The Sedition Act of 1918
was repealed in 1921,

00:33:34.510 --> 00:33:37.730
but the Espionage Act of
1917 remains on the books.

00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:39.530
Thank you.

00:33:39.530 --> 00:33:43.500
[ Applause ]

00:33:56.250 --> 00:33:57.550
&gt;&gt; Jeremy Kessler: I want to stress

00:33:57.550 --> 00:34:02.120
in my brief opening comments
the extensive resistance

00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:06.490
to free speech claims during World
War I, especially from the courts,

00:34:06.490 --> 00:34:11.400 position:56%
as Geoff has already mentioned, but
also, and more surprisingly I think,

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:16.180
for many progressive
intellectuals as well.

00:34:16.180 --> 00:34:20.610
As Geoff mentioned,
the judicial resistance

00:34:20.610 --> 00:34:24.250
to free speech claims
was most obvious

00:34:24.250 --> 00:34:30.590
in cases construing the
federal Espionage Act of 1917.

00:34:30.590 --> 00:34:35.450
I think it's worth repeating the
three main provisions of that act.

00:34:35.450 --> 00:34:41.050 position:56%
One is publishing false reports with
intent to injure the war effort.

00:34:41.050 --> 00:34:43.040
Second, causing or attempting

00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:46.590
to cause insubordination
in the Armed Forces.

00:34:46.590 --> 00:34:51.890
And third, willfully obstructing
recruitment into the Armed Forces.

00:34:51.890 --> 00:34:56.640 position:56%
And, as Geoff mentioned, convictions
could lead to fines of up to $10,000

00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:59.320
and 20 years imprisonment.

00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:05.200
Government prosecutions under
the Espionage Act overwhelmingly

00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:10.580
resulted in convictions, and judges
overwhelmingly rejected claims

00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:12.970
by defendants that to be convicted

00:35:12.970 --> 00:35:18.810
for antiwar speech violated their
First Amendment free speech rights.

00:35:18.810 --> 00:35:26.110 position:56%
The most typical kind of speech that
led to a conviction was speech often

00:35:26.110 --> 00:35:28.320
by socialists or members
of the industrial workers

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:31.710
of the world claiming that
the financial interests

00:35:31.710 --> 00:35:35.810
of capitalists were
primarily responsible

00:35:35.810 --> 00:35:40.150 position:56%
for the American entry into the war.

00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:44.670
And many juries and
judges construed that kind

00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:47.350
of opposition to war as false.

00:35:47.350 --> 00:35:50.470
That's not what Congress
said in declaring war.

00:35:50.470 --> 00:35:55.280
And also that that antiwar
speech had a tendency

00:35:55.280 --> 00:36:00.030
to cause insubordination
and obstruct recruitment.

00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:03.900
Much milder speech also
led to convictions.

00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:08.920
This is an extreme case, but
not the only extreme case.

00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:13.060
A minister was found guilty
of causing insubordination

00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:18.020
under the Espionage Act because
he distributed a pamphlet teaching

00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:20.990
that Christians should
not kill during wars.

00:36:20.990 --> 00:36:24.620
And that was held to have a
tendency to cause the obstruction

00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:28.090
of recruitment and insubordination.

00:36:28.090 --> 00:36:31.970
There were some rare acquittals
under Espionage Act prosecutions,

00:36:31.970 --> 00:36:36.790 position:56%
but as Geoff mentioned, many of
them were reversed by higher courts.

00:36:36.790 --> 00:36:40.440
And one of these rare
acquittals prompted Congress

00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:44.690
to amend the Espionage Act to
make convictions even easier

00:36:44.690 --> 00:36:47.910
than they already were,
which is very easy.

00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:52.590 position:56%
And I think it's worth telling you
a little bit about the case that led

00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:56.070
to the passage of the Sedition Act.

00:36:56.070 --> 00:37:01.130
A judge in Montana directed
acquittal of a defendant.

00:37:01.130 --> 00:37:05.490
The judge pointed out that the
defendant's antiwar statements,

00:37:05.490 --> 00:37:10.390
anti-capitalist statements,
occurred at picnics

00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:16.290
and during saloon argument
at a small village in Montana

00:37:16.290 --> 00:37:21.490
that was 60 miles from the nearest
train station and 100's of miles

00:37:21.490 --> 00:37:24.850
from the nearest military base.

00:37:24.850 --> 00:37:29.270
And according to the judge,
that is not enough evidence

00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:32.970
to show an intent to
cause insubordination.

00:37:32.970 --> 00:37:39.310
The Attorney General of the United
States cited this rare acquittal

00:37:39.310 --> 00:37:42.990
as evidence of the ineffectiveness
of the Espionage Act,

00:37:42.990 --> 00:37:45.880
which overwhelmingly
led to convictions.

00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:49.640
And the Attorney General
successfully urged Congress

00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:54.610
to pass the Sedition Act of
1918, which as Geoff said,

00:37:54.610 --> 00:38:01.980 position:56%
expressly prohibited, quote unquote,
unpatriotic or disloyal language.

00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:08.570
Now, this widespread
hostility to free speech claims

00:38:08.570 --> 00:38:15.310
under the Espionage Act extended
to the United States Supreme Court.

00:38:15.310 --> 00:38:17.070
The first Supreme Court decisions,

00:38:17.070 --> 00:38:20.680
as many of you probably
know, were in March 1919.

00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:23.640
All three were unanimous decisions.

00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:28.370
All three were written by Justice
Holmes, who still had a reputation

00:38:28.370 --> 00:38:33.940
as a progressive hero
when I was in law school.

00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:40.510
Most public attention was focused
on the case of Eugene Debs,

00:38:40.510 --> 00:38:45.790
who was by far the most famous
defendant in an Espionage Act case.

00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:49.000
As many of you know, I'm sure
Debs was a major union leader

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:50.300
in the United States.

00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:52.470
He had been a recent
Socialist party candidate

00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:54.280
for president of United States.

00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:56.910
I think he got more votes
as a percentage basis

00:38:56.910 --> 00:38:58.360
until Ross Perot, is that?

00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:02.260
He was a major candidate.

00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:04.970
Holmes observed that the speech

00:39:04.970 --> 00:39:09.360
for which Debs had been convicted
consisted of restatements

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:13.810
of socialist opposition to war,
and also praise of socialists

00:39:13.810 --> 00:39:15.840
who had already been convicted

00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:20.680
for violating the draft
law and the Espionage Act.

00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:25.230
And Holmes concluded that the jury
was justified in finding that kind

00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:28.770
of speech, having a tendency

00:39:28.770 --> 00:39:31.730
to obstruct the recruitment
service and; therefore,

00:39:31.730 --> 00:39:34.860
the conviction of Debs was upheld.

00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:42.630
Notice again the use of tendency to
justify the punishment of speech.

00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:48.260
Holmes relied on the bad tendency
of speech in upholding convictions

00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:52.050
in the two companion cases,
called Schenck and [inaudible].

00:39:52.050 --> 00:39:54.490
And it's interesting, many of you
probably have heard the term clear

00:39:54.490 --> 00:39:56.870
and present danger
from the Schenck case,

00:39:56.870 --> 00:39:58.400
which for decades was considered

00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:00.970
to be a protective interpretation
of the First Amendment.

00:40:00.970 --> 00:40:04.790
Holmes did not even use that
phrase in the other two cases,

00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:09.100
yet he relied on the bad tendency
of speech to uphold convictions

00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:14.630
under the Espionage Act for
opposition to American involvement

00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:19.250
in World War I, basically the claim
it was a capitalists' war rejecting

00:40:19.250 --> 00:40:21.760
First Amendment claims.

00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:27.680
Now, I want to emphasize that
this reliance on the bad tendency

00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:30.920
of speech to justify convictions

00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:36.730 position:56%
and to deny First Amendment claims
was not new under the Espionage Act.

00:40:36.730 --> 00:40:41.370
This was the standard approach
to rejecting free speech claims

00:40:41.370 --> 00:40:44.740
of all kinds throughout
the United States,

00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:47.110
throughout the entire
judicial system,

00:40:47.110 --> 00:40:50.600
from the Civil War
until World War I.

00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:53.420
And I want to give you
an example of the use

00:40:53.420 --> 00:40:56.010
of the bad tendency
approach before the war,

00:40:56.010 --> 00:40:58.830
and this is by Holmes
himself in a case

00:40:58.830 --> 00:41:03.420
in 1907 called Patterson
versus Colorado.

00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:06.790
Okay, Patterson, Thomas
Patterson was a Democratic senator

00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:08.930
from Colorado who was
also the publisher

00:41:08.930 --> 00:41:11.590
of a leading newspaper in Colorado.

00:41:11.590 --> 00:41:14.740
The newspaper published
editorials, cartoons,

00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:19.020
articles criticizing
the Republican majority

00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:22.680
of the Colorado Supreme
Court for acting as tools

00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:26.330 position:56%
of the wealthy utility corporations.

00:41:26.330 --> 00:41:29.240
And prodded by the
Colorado Supreme Court,

00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:32.490
the Colorado Attorney
General brought contempt

00:41:32.490 --> 00:41:36.540
of court proceedings
against Senator Patterson,

00:41:36.540 --> 00:41:40.950
and the Republican majority of
the Colorado Supreme Court upheld

00:41:40.950 --> 00:41:43.970
that conviction for
contempt of court.

00:41:43.970 --> 00:41:46.960
Patterson appealed to the United
States Supreme Court claiming the

00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:50.810 position:56%
conviction violated his First
Amendment rights and asserting truth

00:41:50.810 --> 00:41:54.610
as a defense, a basic defense
under the First Amendment.

00:41:54.610 --> 00:41:57.390
Holmes, writing for eight
of the nine justices,

00:41:57.390 --> 00:42:00.540
rejected the First Amendment claim.

00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:01.950
Reasoning?

00:42:01.950 --> 00:42:07.890
Publications criticizing judicial
behavior in pending cases tend

00:42:07.890 --> 00:42:11.200
to obstruct the administration
of justice, whether

00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:16.560
or not the allegations are true,
First Amendment claim denied.

00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:22.030
And this reliance on the tendency
of speech could be found in 100's

00:42:22.030 --> 00:42:25.110
of cases throughout the
American judicial system

00:42:25.110 --> 00:42:28.160
between the Civil War
and World War I.

00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:32.320
I find it very interesting
that a man named Gilbert Roe,

00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:35.610
who had been a lawyer
for many defendants

00:42:35.610 --> 00:42:39.200
in free speech cases
before World War I,

00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:43.700
testified in the Congressional
hearings about the espionage bill

00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:49.000
and warned about the potential
use of the bad tendency approach.

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:50.630
He says, I know about this danger

00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:53.690
because I handled free
speech cases before the war.

00:42:53.690 --> 00:42:56.190
He didn't object of
a falsity clause,

00:42:56.190 --> 00:43:00.710
but he did correctly
presciently predict

00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:06.620
that the courts would construe
unpopular antiwar speech

00:43:06.620 --> 00:43:11.110
as having a tendency
to obstruct recruitment

00:43:11.110 --> 00:43:16.290
and cause insubordination, and
he turned out to be right based

00:43:16.290 --> 00:43:18.170
on the judicial decisions.

00:43:18.170 --> 00:43:26.380
So very briefly in closing I want
to emphasize that this resistance

00:43:26.380 --> 00:43:32.300
to free speech claims during World
War I was not limited to judges.

00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:33.870
It was surprising to me to find

00:43:33.870 --> 00:43:36.760
out that leading progressive
intellectuals

00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:42.280
in the United States had at best
ambivalent views about free speech.

00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:44.320
Now some of this explicable.

00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:51.420
The progressives identified
constitutional rights

00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:57.900 position:56%
with excessive individualism, and
they attributed many of the problems

00:43:57.900 --> 00:44:05.070
in early 20th century America,
such as destructive inequality,

00:44:05.070 --> 00:44:10.740
division throughout society, to the
over emphasis on individual rights,

00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:13.290
including individual
constitutional rights.

00:44:13.290 --> 00:44:17.420
Now they focused on the individual
rights of property and liberty

00:44:17.420 --> 00:44:20.020
of contract, which
as many of you know,

00:44:20.020 --> 00:44:25.290
were used to invalidate
progressive reform legislation,

00:44:25.290 --> 00:44:28.130
but they weren't sympathetic
to other expressions

00:44:28.130 --> 00:44:33.300
of individual rights, including
those based on the First Amendment.

00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:38.580
Also, the progressives
placed great emphasis

00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:41.240
on achieving social harmony.

00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:44.160
That was a key element
of progressive thought.

00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:49.410
And that attention to harmony
limited their conception

00:44:49.410 --> 00:44:51.010
of free speech.

00:44:51.010 --> 00:44:57.090
Yes, free speech that contributes
to social reconstruction is good

00:44:57.090 --> 00:45:00.500
and should be protected,
but free speech

00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:04.880
that expresses the
inevitability of class conflict,

00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:08.810
or that denies the feasibility,

00:45:08.810 --> 00:45:12.830
possibility of ultimate social
unity, that was not good speech,

00:45:12.830 --> 00:45:15.800
and they did not really
believe in protecting it.

00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:20.470
And a great example of this
progressive view is John Dewey,

00:45:20.470 --> 00:45:23.800
perhaps the leading progressive
intellectual, public intellectual

00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:27.300
in the country at the time,
probably more sympathetic

00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:31.710
to free speech claims than most
progressives, yet in an article

00:45:31.710 --> 00:45:33.650
in the New Republic Magazine soon

00:45:33.650 --> 00:45:38.520
after the United States
entered World War I in 1917,

00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:43.580
Dewey criticized pacifist
opposition to the war as a failure

00:45:43.580 --> 00:45:46.390
to seize its Democratic
possibilities,

00:45:46.390 --> 00:45:52.240
and he ridiculed dissenters
for invoking, quote unquote,

00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:57.410
early Victorian platitudes about
the sanctity of individual rights.

00:45:57.410 --> 00:45:59.570
That's John Dewey, a progressive.

00:45:59.570 --> 00:46:03.790
So I'll stop here with
that, and I look forward

00:46:03.790 --> 00:46:06.820
to the other presentations and to
the discussion that will follow.

00:46:06.820 --> 00:46:08.620
Thanks.

00:46:08.620 --> 00:46:11.500
[ Applause ]

00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:18.090
&gt;&gt; Megan Ming Francis: Great,
good afternoon everyone.

00:46:18.090 --> 00:46:22.810
First, I want to follow up on what
Mary said, and really thank Ryan

00:46:22.810 --> 00:46:26.280
and the rest of the
Library of Congress staff

00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:27.620
for all that you do here.

00:46:27.620 --> 00:46:29.810
I spent, what is this now?

00:46:29.810 --> 00:46:34.860
2005 through 2013 basically
taking refuge in this building,

00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:40.150
in part because my first
book centers on the NAACP.

00:46:40.150 --> 00:46:44.660
And I can attest to what Ryan
said in terms of that's so much

00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:46.800
of actually what I cite my book.

00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:49.860
Some of it is on microfilm,
but a lot of it are just

00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:52.020
like these wonderful
finds that I found

00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:55.600
in very well cataloged
folders, as well as the papers

00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:58.660
of Lauren [assumed spelling] -- I
mean, not Lauren, Woodrow Wilson

00:46:58.660 --> 00:47:03.600
and Warren G. Harding, an often,
unfortunately, forgotten president.

00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:08.660
I also really want to thank the
panel moderator, Mary Dudziak,

00:47:08.660 --> 00:47:11.600
for her work on civil rights
in the Cold War period,

00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:14.300
in part because her work
had a transformative impact

00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:15.650
on my own scholarship.

00:47:15.650 --> 00:47:17.300
With that, hey, everyone.

00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:20.770
All right, so what I
want to do is to --

00:47:20.770 --> 00:47:24.880
is to, one, depose these three
myths, and then because I believe

00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:28.120
in truth telling and myth
busting, especially here in D.C.,

00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:30.730
because that's kind of, I
feel, like the flavor of today.

00:47:30.730 --> 00:47:34.370
And then we're going to --
and then I'm going to try

00:47:34.370 --> 00:47:37.980
to tell you a story, and you can
believe me or not, but it is backed

00:47:37.980 --> 00:47:40.210
up by archives found
in this building.

00:47:40.210 --> 00:47:43.870
Okay. So one of the things that
I just want to -- I think --

00:47:43.870 --> 00:47:47.180
I think it's important to
state first is that to get

00:47:47.180 --> 00:47:49.100
around I think this kind of --

00:47:49.100 --> 00:47:52.240
this traditional narrative of
civil rights making that centers

00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:55.900
around kind of the '50s and
the '60s in this country,

00:47:55.900 --> 00:47:59.950
and to push that timeline back
much further into the early part

00:47:59.950 --> 00:48:02.520
of the 20th century, there's
this way, and this is --

00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:05.350 position:56%
historians have been really great on
this, especially legal historians,

00:48:05.350 --> 00:48:06.870
and kind of this -- there's this --

00:48:06.870 --> 00:48:11.230
been this huge focus on the
Brown v. Board of Education,

00:48:11.230 --> 00:48:14.090
that whole litigation campaign,
and then what happens after that,

00:48:14.090 --> 00:48:17.700
obviously, in '64 and in '65.

00:48:17.700 --> 00:48:20.150
But there's this kind of
world of rights making

00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:22.540
that happens actually before that.

00:48:22.540 --> 00:48:26.170
Part of the kind of -- the worry
here is that so much of the work,

00:48:26.170 --> 00:48:29.740
especially in terms of the making
of African American citizenship,

00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:33.050
has centered around education
as being central to that.

00:48:33.050 --> 00:48:35.430
And I don't think that's
wrong, but I think that needs

00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:37.450
to be problematized a bit.

00:48:37.450 --> 00:48:40.330
The second one that I
think is important today,

00:48:40.330 --> 00:48:43.780
to make very plain here, is
that the fight and the struggle

00:48:43.780 --> 00:48:47.500 position:56%
for black lives is not a new civil
rights struggle by any means, right?

00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:49.550
So I'm just going to say that.

00:48:49.550 --> 00:48:51.310
And the other one,
and this is something

00:48:51.310 --> 00:48:52.610
that I actually was a bit surprised

00:48:52.610 --> 00:48:55.790
about because perhaps I
was brainwashed in college,

00:48:55.790 --> 00:49:00.420
was that courts were not the
first point of entry for the NAACP

00:49:00.420 --> 00:49:03.700
in the battle for civil
rights in this country.

00:49:03.700 --> 00:49:05.620
All right, so what I'm
going to try to do --

00:49:05.620 --> 00:49:08.160
so those are kind of what
I want to present perhaps.

00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:10.370
I'm unwilling to talk
more about the --

00:49:10.370 --> 00:49:16.480
any of these in the q and a. So I
want to tell you a story in terms

00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:19.120
of my work around the NAACP.

00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:24.070
And so what I try to focus on, and
my work is the NAACP's campaign

00:49:24.070 --> 00:49:27.870
against racial violence in the
first quarter of the 20th century.

00:49:27.870 --> 00:49:31.020
So my two other panelists
have told a kind of a story

00:49:31.020 --> 00:49:33.520
around World War -- World War II --

00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:38.130
World War 1 that focuses
on free speech.

00:49:38.130 --> 00:49:42.090
I'm going to move a little
bit here outside of the courts

00:49:42.090 --> 00:49:43.390
and depose something interesting.

00:49:43.390 --> 00:49:46.720
I mean, for me it was focusing
on the development of the NAACP,

00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:49.690
and then to realize
that actually they begin

00:49:49.690 --> 00:49:54.900
and they grow very much during
the time of World War I.

00:49:54.900 --> 00:49:58.550
So the NAACP was founded in 190

00:49:58.550 --> 00:50:01.050
around this issue of
racial violence.

00:50:01.050 --> 00:50:05.690
This big race massacre happened
in Springfield, Illinois.

00:50:05.690 --> 00:50:11.040
And a lot of really concerned white
abolitionists became, what is this?

00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:14.060
Why is there this white
violence outside of the south?

00:50:14.060 --> 00:50:17.310
We should organize and we
should do something, right?

00:50:17.310 --> 00:50:20.270
And so then what happens
between 1909

00:50:20.270 --> 00:50:25.340
and 1911 is they form what
then becomes the NAACP.

00:50:25.340 --> 00:50:28.330
At the time, I know many people
in here do also know this,

00:50:28.330 --> 00:50:30.770
the board was all white with
one black member, which is going

00:50:30.770 --> 00:50:32.180
to be W. E. B. Dubois, right?

00:50:32.180 --> 00:50:34.320
He's going to be a single
black member on the board

00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:36.130
of directors at the NAACP.

00:50:36.130 --> 00:50:38.930
And the big issue that they
take up, I don't ever talk

00:50:38.930 --> 00:50:42.860
about the NAACP also without
talking about Ida B. Wells.

00:50:42.860 --> 00:50:46.330
So, and I'm going to say one
very quick thing about that.

00:50:46.330 --> 00:50:49.030
So the big issue they take up is
this issue around racial violence,

00:50:49.030 --> 00:50:50.970
in part because of
Ida B. Wells' work

00:50:50.970 --> 00:50:54.180
around the anti-lynching
crusades at the end of the 19th,

00:50:54.180 --> 00:50:56.340
in the beginning of
the 20th century.

00:50:56.340 --> 00:50:58.450
She makes the case very clear

00:50:58.450 --> 00:51:02.320 position:56%
that African Americans cannot
actually be free until they are free

00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:04.100
from the threat of racial violence,

00:51:04.100 --> 00:51:06.310
meaning lynching and
mob violence, right?

00:51:06.310 --> 00:51:09.340
And so the beginning planning
meetings of the NAACP,

00:51:09.340 --> 00:51:12.800
Ida B. Wells is around, but Dubois,
because of serious gender issues

00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:15.720
that he actually has, then
pushes her to the side,

00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:17.270
but they still do take
up this issue, right?

00:51:17.270 --> 00:51:19.510
Like, history is fun because
all these characters are

00:51:19.510 --> 00:51:21.830
so much more complex
than I think sometimes

00:51:21.830 --> 00:51:23.130
that at least media
gives them credit for.

00:51:23.130 --> 00:51:25.360
All right, so the NAACP is formed.

00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:28.570
And they go after,
they very much believe

00:51:28.570 --> 00:51:31.650
that this is the way towards
freedom in this country.

00:51:31.650 --> 00:51:37.200
Sometimes in order to kind of
try to bring home the importance

00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:39.610
of racial violence to
the early development

00:51:39.610 --> 00:51:43.510
of the NAACP I often use this
one quote that, when I read it,

00:51:43.510 --> 00:51:45.230
I just had to kind of
sit back because it --

00:51:45.230 --> 00:51:48.220
and it had to sit with
me for a while.

00:51:48.220 --> 00:51:51.400
So at this board meeting in
1916, Mary White Ovington,

00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:53.610
a white board member,
is a bit confused

00:51:53.610 --> 00:51:57.780
about why the NAACP is not going
after other important areas

00:51:57.780 --> 00:52:01.170
that we now associate with
civil rights, such as education,

00:52:01.170 --> 00:52:03.240
voting, and housing segregation.

00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:07.430
And one of the black leaders,
he's now the board of directors

00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:10.780
at the NAACP, turns to her
and he says, all the Amer --

00:52:10.780 --> 00:52:13.770
and this is a quote, all the
American Negro wants is a chance

00:52:13.770 --> 00:52:16.490
to live without a rope
around his neck, end quote.

00:52:16.490 --> 00:52:19.650
Right? So the point here
is that before we can fight

00:52:19.650 --> 00:52:22.250
for the other rights, before we
can enjoy these other rights,

00:52:22.250 --> 00:52:25.460
that African Americans actually
first have to live first.

00:52:25.460 --> 00:52:29.280
And so this is a statement in 1916,

00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:33.040 position:56%
despite what I told you very quickly
earlier that the NAACP was formed

00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:35.800
and it was kind of this all
white board of directors

00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:39.690
with Dubois, that changes in 1916.

00:52:39.690 --> 00:52:43.560 position:56%
James Wood Johnson comes on board
and assumes leadership of the NAACP,

00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:45.960
and Walter White, not from
Breaking Bad, but Walter White

00:52:45.960 --> 00:52:49.600
of NAACP fame, comes on in 1917.

00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:52.680
And they then resurrect the
membership and it expands.

00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:54.860
They're like, why is
all the membership

00:52:54.860 --> 00:52:56.630
in the mid-west and the north?

00:52:56.630 --> 00:53:01.030
Like, there is clearly African
Americans, and a lot of them

00:53:01.030 --> 00:53:04.630
in the south, and we need to
organize and mobilize and set

00:53:04.630 --> 00:53:08.160
up chapters in the
south immediately.

00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:10.640
And so you see the numbers
in terms of the membership

00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:16.890
of the NAACP changing
dramatically between 1916 and 1919,

00:53:16.890 --> 00:53:21.240
in part because of the leadership
of Johnson and White at the NAACP.

00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:23.620
So the way they go about this
issue of racial violence,

00:53:23.620 --> 00:53:27.230
and with my five minutes left
I'm going to condense a lot here,

00:53:27.230 --> 00:53:28.530
is they believe that the first --

00:53:28.530 --> 00:53:31.730
and this is one of the things that
I've struggled with and I still do,

00:53:31.730 --> 00:53:35.450
before there was such a
notion of civil rights, right,

00:53:35.450 --> 00:53:37.720
we today if I say civil rights
you'll be like, all right,

00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:41.560
march in Washington [inaudible],
it's like, things come to mind.

00:53:41.560 --> 00:53:43.740
But this is like, again,
the early part of the NAACP,

00:53:43.740 --> 00:53:45.770
the federal government
has not come out, right,

00:53:45.770 --> 00:53:48.490
to consistently protect
African American rights.

00:53:48.490 --> 00:53:51.010 position:56%
So they're fighting for civil rights
before there's like this notion

00:53:51.010 --> 00:53:53.860 position:56%
of what civil rights actually means.

00:53:53.860 --> 00:53:56.260
And so they believe, all
right, first what we're going

00:53:56.260 --> 00:53:58.410
to do is we're going to launch
this public opinion campaign.

00:53:58.410 --> 00:54:00.690
We're going to organize
people in the streets.

00:54:00.690 --> 00:54:04.270
And if we can just reach the
hearts and minds of Americans,

00:54:04.270 --> 00:54:06.280
and then things will change, right?

00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:09.350
Like white America
will realize the terror

00:54:09.350 --> 00:54:12.410
of racial violence and
it will stop, right?

00:54:12.410 --> 00:54:16.770
So they do this and they
organize, and significant inroads,

00:54:16.770 --> 00:54:18.090
but it doesn't stop, right?

00:54:18.090 --> 00:54:22.390
So then they were like, all right,
we have to attack formal politics.

00:54:22.390 --> 00:54:24.380
So with that -- and the
three branches, right?

00:54:24.380 --> 00:54:27.850
So one, obviously, they
do this whole campaign

00:54:27.850 --> 00:54:30.990
for anti-lynching legislation
inside of Congress

00:54:30.990 --> 00:54:33.890
and they make far -- they get far.

00:54:33.890 --> 00:54:37.610
And then a Supreme Court case
around criminal procedure,

00:54:37.610 --> 00:54:40.760
around basically the
legal lynching, the --

00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:44.910
kind of the sentencing to die of 12
African American men in Arkansas.

00:54:44.910 --> 00:54:49.110
And the point that I want to
focus on here though that I --

00:54:49.110 --> 00:54:52.580
that I found fascinating is the
work inside the executive, right?

00:54:52.580 --> 00:54:57.080
So here's the NAACP, this
incredibly outsider organization.

00:54:57.080 --> 00:55:01.810
That is like, all right, you know
what we're going to do in 1960?

00:55:01.810 --> 00:55:04.670
We're going to go and
talk to Woodrow Wilson.

00:55:04.670 --> 00:55:07.250
And we're going to
make the plea to him

00:55:07.250 --> 00:55:11.850
to make a public statement
condemning lynching, right?

00:55:11.850 --> 00:55:14.650
And also, you know, what's
going on in the background here,

00:55:14.650 --> 00:55:18.210
of course for those who know
a little bit around African,

00:55:18.210 --> 00:55:22.250
Americans, relationship,
Wilson, you guys are like,

00:55:22.250 --> 00:55:25.360
that's been [inaudible], right?

00:55:25.360 --> 00:55:30.390
Okay. So, Dubois and NAACP actually
come out to support his first term,

00:55:30.390 --> 00:55:33.960 position:56%
in part because he -- Wilson lobbies
African American organizations,

00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:35.670
some people don't know that.

00:55:35.670 --> 00:55:40.450
And so Dubois wrote -- has written
this now, historians like to fight

00:55:40.450 --> 00:55:42.570
about it, this editorial
called Closing Ranks,

00:55:42.570 --> 00:55:45.080 position:56%
which is basically the argument that
African Americans should close ranks

00:55:45.080 --> 00:55:49.600
and support Wilson and that --
and that serving is perhaps a way

00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:53.210
to greater sense of kind of
citizenship in this country.

00:55:53.210 --> 00:55:56.300
But then obviously what
happens is that, right,

00:55:56.300 --> 00:55:59.970
the civil service gets segregated
and African Americans it seems

00:55:59.970 --> 00:56:02.650
like progress is rolled
back, and the NAACP

00:56:02.650 --> 00:56:08.160 position:56%
and all these other civil rights
organizations are upset with Wilson.

00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:10.570
The second term though, what I
found fascinating is the NAACP just

00:56:10.570 --> 00:56:15.980
doesn't stop their relentless like
kind persistence around Wilson.

00:56:15.980 --> 00:56:20.640
In the second term, while he
is still the staunch southern

00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:25.730
segregationist, and not by any
means great on matters of race,

00:56:25.730 --> 00:56:29.130
there is a softening in Wilson's
racial tone towards African

00:56:29.130 --> 00:56:32.750
Americans in his second term
that I found interesting,

00:56:32.750 --> 00:56:36.230
a tiny bit confusing, but
interesting nonetheless.

00:56:36.230 --> 00:56:37.530
And so there's two
very quick things.

00:56:37.530 --> 00:56:39.910
I know I'm like on two
minutes, Mary, I'm sorry.

00:56:39.910 --> 00:56:42.530
So two big things for me that I --

00:56:42.530 --> 00:56:46.850
that I highlight that I think are
worth making mention of in terms

00:56:46.850 --> 00:56:50.390
of -- because at the end of
the day my work and my concern,

00:56:50.390 --> 00:56:53.870
at least in the academy, is the
impact that social movement actors,

00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:58.530
specifically black and brown
social movement actors can have

00:56:58.530 --> 00:57:00.600
on pushing the boundaries
of the American state

00:57:00.600 --> 00:57:03.200
and American institutions
in new directions.

00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:05.640
So the -- there's this
horrible race massacre

00:57:05.640 --> 00:57:07.760
that happens in East St. Louis.

00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:13.430
And it is -- it results because
of labor tensions as a result

00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:17.540
of the draft and also
of the great migration,

00:57:17.540 --> 00:57:21.120
and they are resenting this new
African American presence in town.

00:57:21.120 --> 00:57:24.850
And so what happens one day that
sets this off is they then go --

00:57:24.850 --> 00:57:26.600
the whites in Phil -- not in
Philip's [assumed spelling] County,

00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:29.880
excuse me, in East St. Louis, go
to the African American section

00:57:29.880 --> 00:57:32.290
of town, light houses on fire.

00:57:32.290 --> 00:57:36.900
So it was either stay inside and
burn alive or face a firing squad

00:57:36.900 --> 00:57:38.510
as you ran out of the house, right?

00:57:38.510 --> 00:57:42.060
And so 1000's of men, women, and
children died in East St. Louis.

00:57:42.060 --> 00:57:44.750
It's a horrible massacre.

00:57:44.750 --> 00:57:48.610
So what the NAACP did to organize
is they launched at that time,

00:57:48.610 --> 00:57:52.150
to that point, was the biggest
demonstration of African Americans

00:57:52.150 --> 00:57:57.220
in history in July of 1917, don't
5th Avenue in New York City,

00:57:57.220 --> 00:58:00.640
10,000 African Americans
marched silently down 5th Ave.

00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:03.740
to protest increasing
violence and the St. --

00:58:03.740 --> 00:58:08.600
the St. Louis massacre,
East St. Louis massacre.

00:58:08.600 --> 00:58:10.600
They then afterwards,
a few days afterwards,

00:58:10.600 --> 00:58:12.550
take a delegation to Wilson.

00:58:12.550 --> 00:58:15.170
Joseph Tumulty, his personal
secretary, meets them at --

00:58:15.170 --> 00:58:16.650
meet them, provides buffering.

00:58:16.650 --> 00:58:19.530
Is like, hey, hey, hey,
you can't talk to Wilson.

00:58:19.530 --> 00:58:21.100
He doesn't want to talk to you.

00:58:21.100 --> 00:58:23.920
In this really weird exchange,

00:58:23.920 --> 00:58:27.520
Wilson then sends the following day
Tumulty a letter that is like --

00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:31.240 position:56%
that says, I would like to meet with
the delegation if it's possible.

00:58:31.240 --> 00:58:33.850
And Tumulty is like, I've
already contacted a governor

00:58:33.850 --> 00:58:35.420
to try to run interference.

00:58:35.420 --> 00:58:36.720
You don't need to meet with them.

00:58:36.720 --> 00:58:40.090
And Wilson says, no, I actually
think I do need to meet with them.

00:58:40.090 --> 00:58:43.950
And so he sits down, and this is in
James Wood Johnson's autobiography,

00:58:43.950 --> 00:58:47.070
he sits down and have a long
conversation and they tell him,

00:58:47.070 --> 00:58:50.410
at least James -- according to
James Wood Johnson's account,

00:58:50.410 --> 00:58:52.420 position:56%
they tell him about racial violence.

00:58:52.420 --> 00:58:56.000
They ask him to make a
statement condemning lynching,

00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:58.650
and he actually does.

00:58:58.650 --> 00:59:00.430
Two months later he
makes a statement

00:59:00.430 --> 00:59:03.100
to Congress condemning lynching.

00:59:03.100 --> 00:59:07.300
And in closing I think it's
important and are useful to think

00:59:07.300 --> 00:59:11.030
about in times of resistant
president the impact

00:59:11.030 --> 00:59:15.130
that social movement actors,
even though kind of marginalize,

00:59:15.130 --> 00:59:18.600
might have on a president
and also on a nation.

00:59:18.600 --> 00:59:20.510
Thanks a lot.

00:59:20.510 --> 00:59:25.500
[ Applause ]

00:59:32.580 --> 00:59:35.510
&gt;&gt; David Rabban: So first I just
wanted to echo previous thanks

00:59:35.510 --> 00:59:38.240
to Ryan Reft and to the
Library of Congress,

00:59:38.240 --> 00:59:43.580
to which I'm almost greatly
indebted for my -- for my research.

00:59:43.580 --> 00:59:46.520
And also thank the --

00:59:46.520 --> 00:59:51.720
my co-panelists, who have
given just a fabulous, I think,

00:59:51.720 --> 00:59:56.210
panoply of views on World
War I, particularly to Megan,

00:59:56.210 --> 00:59:58.600
who I think has [inaudible]
up what I want

00:59:58.600 --> 01:00:00.970
to briefly address very nicely.

01:00:00.970 --> 01:00:05.150
And that is that we generally
associate World War I,

01:00:05.150 --> 01:00:11.670
and war more generally, across
history with, on the one hand,

01:00:11.670 --> 01:00:18.550
the expansion of state capacity,
the development of new forms

01:00:18.550 --> 01:00:26.510 position:56%
of governance, and new fiscal power,
the provision of social services,

01:00:26.510 --> 01:00:29.060
the rationalization of industry.

01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:32.480
And we often -- we often
associate that aspect of war making

01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:35.780
on the home front and we
see it in a positive way,

01:00:35.780 --> 01:00:40.610
that that kind state building
is actually a beneficial effect

01:00:40.610 --> 01:00:42.100
of many major wars.

01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:47.090 position:56%
On the other hand, we all recognize,
and Geoff and David have spoken

01:00:47.090 --> 01:00:52.490
to it very eloquently,
that war tends to lead

01:00:52.490 --> 01:00:57.740
to massive state repression
of dissent in particular,

01:00:57.740 --> 01:01:01.850
but often maybe of a variety
of vulnerable social groups.

01:01:01.850 --> 01:01:06.530
So on one hand, we kind of
like the sort of expansions

01:01:06.530 --> 01:01:10.280
and transformations of the national
state that we get in wartime.

01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:12.410
On the other hand, it
seems to come along

01:01:12.410 --> 01:01:18.200
with some pretty bad,
negative effects.

01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:21.300
And what I want to
highlight is actually,

01:01:21.300 --> 01:01:24.710
there's kind of some overlap
and some contradiction

01:01:24.710 --> 01:01:29.230
between these two features
of what happens

01:01:29.230 --> 01:01:31.730
on the home front during
World War I,

01:01:31.730 --> 01:01:35.210
and I think many American
wars thereafter.

01:01:35.210 --> 01:01:39.440
And that is that, a third thing
that goes on during World War I,

01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:43.190
and that would continue to go on --

01:01:43.190 --> 01:01:48.640 position:56%
be repeated and really intensified
during World War II in some spheres,

01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:52.130
is a growth and a form
of state capacity

01:01:52.130 --> 01:01:55.830
that I don't think we usually
think of a form of state capacity,

01:01:55.830 --> 01:01:59.980
and that is the provision
of civil libertarian rights.

01:01:59.980 --> 01:02:04.020
That actually there
are many examples

01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:08.300
of the executive branch
during World War I,

01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:11.470
of wartime administrators trying

01:02:11.470 --> 01:02:15.740
to either create new
civil libertarian rights

01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:19.100
or expand the reach of
recognized preexisting civil

01:02:19.100 --> 01:02:20.400
libertarian rights.

01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:24.820
And so I want to jut briefly run
through four examples of this

01:02:24.820 --> 01:02:32.890 position:56%
and then close by what I think these
examples do and do not show us.

01:02:32.890 --> 01:02:35.780
So the first example
is the War Department,

01:02:35.780 --> 01:02:38.600
and Ryan nicely referenced
in his introduction.

01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:41.480
So in the War Department,
which was responsible not just

01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:45.480 position:56%
for fighting the war but for running
the draft during World War I,

01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:48.400
the War Department was
run by Newton Baker,

01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:51.720
an avowed pacifist,
prior to World War I.

01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:55.670
And his second-in-command was
Frederick Keppel, the former dean

01:02:55.670 --> 01:02:57.120
of Columbia University,

01:02:57.120 --> 01:03:00.210
also an avowed pacifist
prior to World War I.

01:03:00.210 --> 01:03:02.500
And they staffed up War
Department with a number

01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:09.230
of young progressive
lawyers and intellectuals.

01:03:09.230 --> 01:03:11.930
Foremost most among
them, for my purposes,

01:03:11.930 --> 01:03:14.430
the young Harvard law
professor Felix Frankfurter,

01:03:14.430 --> 01:03:18.010
who was very involved in the
creation of the new republic

01:03:18.010 --> 01:03:21.840
and was a leading progressive mind,

01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:25.400
and would go on to
be one for some time.

01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:28.440
Felix Frankfurter was an
assistant in the War Department

01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:32.010
and he was tasked with
figuring out what to do

01:03:32.010 --> 01:03:34.210
about conscientious objection.

01:03:34.210 --> 01:03:37.960
What to do with the problem
of folks who got drafted,

01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:42.200
but because they were
pacifists didn't want to fight.

01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:48.250
The Selective Service Act of
1917 had a very narrow provision

01:03:48.250 --> 01:03:49.750
for conscientious objection.

01:03:49.750 --> 01:03:52.180
It basically said that
if you were a member

01:03:52.180 --> 01:03:55.860
of a well-recognized
pacifist church,

01:03:55.860 --> 01:03:59.610
a formally organized pacifist
church, you could perform

01:03:59.610 --> 01:04:02.830
in uniform noncombat
duty in the army.

01:04:02.830 --> 01:04:08.110
And that was the extent of the
right of conscientious objection.

01:04:08.110 --> 01:04:10.450
Felix Frankfurter, in his mid-30's,

01:04:10.450 --> 01:04:14.140
comes into the War Department
and says, this won't do.

01:04:14.140 --> 01:04:17.120
He's in contact with a lot
of social movement activists

01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:21.120
on the civil libertarian side
of things and the pacifist side

01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:23.750
of things, and basically
creates a blueprint

01:04:23.750 --> 01:04:26.420
for an entirely different
administration

01:04:26.420 --> 01:04:29.470
of conscientious objection during
World War I, a blueprint that goes

01:04:29.470 --> 01:04:33.270
on to be implemented,
imperfectly but in a --

01:04:33.270 --> 01:04:37.330
in a very different way than what
Congress had actually imagined.

01:04:37.330 --> 01:04:40.250
Frankfurter says that right of
conscientious objection needs

01:04:40.250 --> 01:04:47.060
to be expanded to pacifists who are
not members of official churches,

01:04:47.060 --> 01:04:53.710
pacifists or otherwise, and needs
to be extended even to pacifists

01:04:53.710 --> 01:04:59.450
who do not have religious grounds
for their objections to war.

01:04:59.450 --> 01:05:04.820
And finally, he argues
that pacifists need

01:05:04.820 --> 01:05:09.820 position:56%
to be offered alternative civilian
service, non-uniform service outside

01:05:09.820 --> 01:05:12.980
of the military during the war.

01:05:12.980 --> 01:05:16.410
And his fourth suggestion
is that this expanded right

01:05:16.410 --> 01:05:19.090
of conscientious objection
needs to be implemented not

01:05:19.090 --> 01:05:23.470
by local draft boards, which
were constituted by volunteers

01:05:23.470 --> 01:05:29.640
from the community, but by a
centralized committee of sort

01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:32.460 position:56%
of nationally respected legal minds.

01:05:32.460 --> 01:05:34.290
All of those things happen.

01:05:34.290 --> 01:05:39.420
A Board of Inquiry was
established, headed by the dean

01:05:39.420 --> 01:05:43.080 position:56%
of Columbia Law School, Harlan Fiske
Stone, who like Frankfurter will go

01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:44.980
on to be a Justice
of the Supreme Court.

01:05:44.980 --> 01:05:47.860
And they basically take
all of the -- they go --

01:05:47.860 --> 01:05:51.080
they find where all of
the alleged pacifists are,

01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:52.860
all of those who have
not [inaudible] the right

01:05:52.860 --> 01:05:55.770
of conscientious objection are
being mistreated in the army camps,

01:05:55.770 --> 01:05:57.990
they basically hold a kind of --

01:05:57.990 --> 01:06:01.120
this ad hoc form of
administrative adjudication

01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:05.400
and they get those pacifists into
alternative civilian service.

01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:09.370
Okay, Frankfurter then, right after
having written that blueprint,

01:06:09.370 --> 01:06:13.890
goes on and is appointed to Woodrow
Wilson's mediation commission

01:06:13.890 --> 01:06:18.110
in 1917, which was having to
deal with the massive problem

01:06:18.110 --> 01:06:23.270
of labor unrest at the
beginning of World War I.

01:06:23.270 --> 01:06:25.850
While on the mediation commission
Frankfurter writes another

01:06:25.850 --> 01:06:31.060
blueprint, which is a blueprint
for a more powerful board,

01:06:31.060 --> 01:06:32.800
national administration board,

01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:35.830
that will basically have
primary jurisdiction

01:06:35.830 --> 01:06:39.420
over labor disputes during the war.

01:06:39.420 --> 01:06:42.600
That leads to the creation of the
National War Labor Board headed

01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:45.190
by former president Taft.

01:06:45.190 --> 01:06:49.280
And the National War
Labor Board in the --

01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:52.820
as the labor historian
Joseph McCartin has shown,

01:06:52.820 --> 01:06:58.280
what it basically does is it
creates a massive incentive

01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:02.780 position:56%
for nonunionized workers, especially
in industries that are vital

01:07:02.780 --> 01:07:05.640
to the war effort, to strike.

01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:08.710
Because the only way the
National War Labor Board can come

01:07:08.710 --> 01:07:12.600
in to mediate a labor dispute
is if there is a labor dispute

01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:14.550
or a pending labor dispute.

01:07:14.550 --> 01:07:19.460
And so there is a massive
strike wave that actually --

01:07:19.460 --> 01:07:20.790
there's a first strike
wave in early --

01:07:20.790 --> 01:07:24.960
in mid-'17, and then in 1918
there's a massive strike wave --

01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:29.440
a second massive strike wave once
the -- these workers realized that,

01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:32.670
oh, if we threatened to strike
or strike we'll get mediation

01:07:32.670 --> 01:07:34.270
from the National War Labor Board.

01:07:34.270 --> 01:07:42.100
They do -- over a million Americans
join unions during the war.

01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:44.840
So it's massive -- and particularly

01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:48.490
in the previously nonunionized
industrial --

01:07:48.490 --> 01:07:51.070
many nonunionized industrial
sectors.

01:07:51.070 --> 01:07:55.640
So here we see a massive
expansion of Freedom of Association

01:07:55.640 --> 01:07:57.920
and what legal historian
[inaudible],

01:07:57.920 --> 01:08:00.900
a colleague of Geoff Stones,
has called the right to agitate

01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:03.310
in the early 20th century.

01:08:03.310 --> 01:08:07.080
Third and fourth examples
are pretty quick.

01:08:07.080 --> 01:08:14.000
The third example is a
less -- a less happy story,

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:17.750
and it's one that actually
Geoff has brilliantly laid

01:08:17.750 --> 01:08:21.240
out in Perilous Times, and that
is the work by some members

01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:23.730
of the Justice Department
during World War I to try

01:08:23.730 --> 01:08:29.290 position:56%
to mitigate the degree of repression
of antiwar dissenter in the war.

01:08:29.290 --> 01:08:32.990
This is John Lord O'Brian, who
headed the war emergency division

01:08:32.990 --> 01:08:35.910
of the Justice Department,
and along with Alfred Bettman.

01:08:35.910 --> 01:08:42.080 position:56%
As Geoff has shown, they -- although
certainly did a lot of prosecution

01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:48.340
of wartime dissent, they really did
hold to a narrower interpretation

01:08:48.340 --> 01:08:50.660
of the Espionage Act than the one

01:08:50.660 --> 01:08:52.700
that was often implemented
by the courts.

01:08:52.700 --> 01:08:57.140
They also tried to resist the
Postmaster General, who was engaged

01:08:57.140 --> 01:08:59.210
in massive censorship at the time.

01:08:59.210 --> 01:09:03.940
These efforts were not terribly
successful, interestingly,

01:09:03.940 --> 01:09:06.570
and this will be one of my
takeaways, as Geoff shows,

01:09:06.570 --> 01:09:11.190
in large part because
the Justice Department

01:09:11.190 --> 01:09:13.360
at the time was actually
quite decentralized.

01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:16.560
So even though John Lord O'Brian
and Alfred Bettman had these views,

01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:21.590
district U.S. attorneys did not,
they were bringing the cases.

01:09:21.590 --> 01:09:24.600
And then another form of
decentralization was the jury.

01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:28.320
These cases went to juries, and
even despite the formal views

01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:31.570
of the heads of the DOJ about
what the Espionage Act entailed,

01:09:31.570 --> 01:09:37.810
juries would implement a much more
aggressive interpretation leading

01:09:37.810 --> 01:09:41.950
to many of the prosecutions
that Geoff did -

01:09:41.950 --> 01:09:45.110
convictions that Geoff
and David talked about.

01:09:45.110 --> 01:09:49.610
Finally, the Bureau of Immigration,
Louis Post, the assistant secretary

01:09:49.610 --> 01:09:53.500
of labor, who was in charge at
the Bureau of Immigration during

01:09:53.500 --> 01:09:56.710
and immediately after World War I,

01:09:56.710 --> 01:10:01.560
pushed back against then Attorney
General Mitchell Palmer's famous

01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:02.860
Red Raid.

01:10:02.860 --> 01:10:05.300
So this is the Red Scare that
immediately follows World War I,

01:10:05.300 --> 01:10:11.660
leads to 1000's of attempted
deportations of supposed radicals.

01:10:11.660 --> 01:10:18.540
Louis Post cancels over 1500 of
these -- of these deportations,

01:10:18.540 --> 01:10:22.650
sort of trying to vindicate to
some extent the rights of freedom

01:10:22.650 --> 01:10:25.400
of association and
freedom of speech of --

01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:28.410
even of immigrants and
even of non-citizens.

01:10:28.410 --> 01:10:30.750
Okay, so what to take from this?

01:10:30.750 --> 01:10:32.190
What to take from this idea

01:10:32.190 --> 01:10:36.980
that actually during World War
I the state doesn't just repress

01:10:36.980 --> 01:10:38.350
or violate civil liberties,

01:10:38.350 --> 01:10:44.140
but actually supplies new civil
libertarian rights, or new vehicles

01:10:44.140 --> 01:10:46.290
for vindicating civil
libertarian rights.

01:10:46.290 --> 01:10:48.780
I tell this story not to kind of --

01:10:48.780 --> 01:10:51.770
not in an effort to
mitigate the story

01:10:51.770 --> 01:10:57.030
of repression -- I'm out of time?

01:10:57.030 --> 01:10:58.330
Okay, one more minute.

01:10:58.330 --> 01:11:02.970
Thanks. Not to mitigate the
stories of repression of that Geoff

01:11:02.970 --> 01:11:06.810
and David have laid out
and that we know so well,

01:11:06.810 --> 01:11:10.110
and it wasn't just these
Espionage Act cases.

01:11:10.110 --> 01:11:13.890 position:56%
There's massive racial violence that
continues throughout World War I,

01:11:13.890 --> 01:11:16.470 position:56%
massive violence against immigrants.

01:11:16.470 --> 01:11:20.460
So goal is not to say, yeah, you
know, America did some bad things,

01:11:20.460 --> 01:11:22.230
but they also did some good things.

01:11:22.230 --> 01:11:25.520
Rather, I think the importance
of recognizing this side

01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:29.010
of the wartime civil liberty
story is to help us think

01:11:29.010 --> 01:11:32.200
about civil liberties
just differently.

01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:35.610
That civil libertarian
rights are not these kind

01:11:35.610 --> 01:11:40.040
of transcendental rights that
emerge from civil society

01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:43.190
that are then used to push
back against state power,

01:11:43.190 --> 01:11:48.020
but historically have generally
been developed inside the state

01:11:48.020 --> 01:11:51.810
by relatively powerful
administrative actors

01:11:51.810 --> 01:11:55.810
that are then supplied
to society to use.

01:11:55.810 --> 01:11:58.980
So that would be, I think, the
point -- the first takeaway.

01:11:58.980 --> 01:12:02.660
The second takeaway, which is
quite related, is that not only;

01:12:02.660 --> 01:12:08.250
therefore, do -- we to some
extent kind of are stuck depending

01:12:08.250 --> 01:12:11.430
on a powerful state to provide
civil libertarian rights.

01:12:11.430 --> 01:12:15.500
As several of these example show,
centralization, which is often seen

01:12:15.500 --> 01:12:18.540
as one the dangers of
wartime administration,

01:12:18.540 --> 01:12:21.980
is actually generally
pro-civil libertarian.

01:12:21.980 --> 01:12:24.430
That in many of these --
in many of these instances,

01:12:24.430 --> 01:12:27.360
so in the War Department --
in the conscription case,

01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:31.680
the War Department administrators
and the National Board

01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:33.580
of Inquiry that's established,

01:12:33.580 --> 01:12:35.940
are all for a much
broader conscientious --

01:12:35.940 --> 01:12:38.250
right of conscientious objection.

01:12:38.250 --> 01:12:39.950
The local draft boards and many

01:12:39.950 --> 01:12:43.510
of the local army training camp
commanders are not, and that leads

01:12:43.510 --> 01:12:45.050
to the difficulties

01:12:45.050 --> 01:12:47.680
in administrating this more
civil libertarian approach.

01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:50.490
Similarly, the DOJ, I
have mentioned the juries

01:12:50.490 --> 01:12:55.660
and the local U.S.
attorneys, similar issue.

01:12:55.660 --> 01:12:57.750
So centralization actually tends

01:12:57.750 --> 01:13:03.860
to help the state promote
these civil libertarian norms.

01:13:03.860 --> 01:13:07.960
And I'll wrap up there.

01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:09.820
I'm happy to -- I think
-- I think --

01:13:09.820 --> 01:13:14.170
I just would want to say that what
happens during World War I isn't

01:13:14.170 --> 01:13:16.400
just kind of, what?

01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:20.490
These efforts to create new
civil libertarian rights provided

01:13:20.490 --> 01:13:21.960
by administrative agencies

01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:26.280
within the national government will
continue and will really, I think,

01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:32.530
be the fundamental institutional
precursor to a lot of new deal

01:13:32.530 --> 01:13:36.460
and World War II agencies that we
then come to associate more readily

01:13:36.460 --> 01:13:38.070
with civil liberties
and civil rights.

01:13:38.070 --> 01:13:39.870
Thanks very much.

01:13:39.870 --> 01:13:45.570
[ Applause ]

01:13:45.570 --> 01:13:47.890
&gt;&gt; Mary Dudziak: I'd like to
thank all of my co-panelists.

01:13:47.890 --> 01:13:50.630
I thought that was so
interesting and helpful.

01:13:50.630 --> 01:13:55.430 position:56%
What we're going to do now is have a
little conversation among the group,

01:13:55.430 --> 01:13:59.450
and then open it up to your
questions and comments.

01:13:59.450 --> 01:14:01.510
Okay, and I -- you know,
as I was listening to you,

01:14:01.510 --> 01:14:04.510
I was sort of thinking
about a lot of things

01:14:04.510 --> 01:14:08.260
that sort of cut across the talks.

01:14:08.260 --> 01:14:12.500
But I think I want to think about,
you know, three different things,

01:14:12.500 --> 01:14:13.800
and I'll ask different questions,

01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:19.510
about sort of about consequences
downstream, which you've suggested,

01:14:19.510 --> 01:14:27.000 position:56%
about causality, and let's make sure
along the way we talk about the role

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:28.760
of the courts within this all?

01:14:28.760 --> 01:14:32.210
But let me start with the
question of, you know,

01:14:32.210 --> 01:14:33.990
what's the sort of
causal engine here?

01:14:33.990 --> 01:14:37.750
Because sometimes it sounds
like Felix Frankfurter was

01:14:37.750 --> 01:14:39.700
in the right place at
the right time, right?

01:14:39.700 --> 01:14:43.540
Or some other character in
history so that the history is sort

01:14:43.540 --> 01:14:47.560
of being driven by, you
know, individual agency

01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:52.270
and the happenstance of the --
of certain people being together.

01:14:52.270 --> 01:14:58.840
Other times, wartime is this
sort of roping causal factor.

01:14:58.840 --> 01:15:04.800
And so to the extent it's the war
that's causing what's happening

01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:08.360
in these stories, what's
exactly the mechanism by that,

01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:11.980
like what about the war,
the war as a set of --

01:15:11.980 --> 01:15:14.080
generating a set of ideas,

01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:16.870
the war generating a set
of institutions, right?

01:15:16.870 --> 01:15:20.360
So if we think about World
War I causing certain things

01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:22.940
in domestic politics and
culture, what's the --

01:15:22.940 --> 01:15:29.550
what's actually the trail
there from this fighting war

01:15:29.550 --> 01:15:32.990
and what we're seeing at home?

01:15:32.990 --> 01:15:34.290
Anybody?

01:15:34.290 --> 01:15:36.580
&gt;&gt; Geoffrey Stone: So in terms
of my particular interest,

01:15:36.580 --> 01:15:38.560
it would seem fairly obvious

01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:44.640
that when a nation is
it war it wants unity.

01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:47.730
Unity is seen as, and
understandably seen,

01:15:47.730 --> 01:15:50.750
as critical to being able to win.

01:15:50.750 --> 01:15:55.720
And once you've decided to enter
a war, winning is critical.

01:15:55.720 --> 01:16:00.490
And so that becomes
the paramount goal.

01:16:00.490 --> 01:16:02.410
And the question is, well,
how do you achieve that?

01:16:02.410 --> 01:16:05.720
Well, one way it's been
understood you achieve that is

01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:10.390
by not creating dissension,
not causing situations

01:16:10.390 --> 01:16:13.110
where people doubt
whether this is worthwhile.

01:16:13.110 --> 01:16:15.440
It's true that if they
doubt that they will go

01:16:15.440 --> 01:16:19.580
to Canada rather than
to go to Vietnam.

01:16:19.580 --> 01:16:24.320 position:56%
Or they will not buy war bonds, or
they will be subordinated if they're

01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:25.620
in the military all ready.

01:16:25.620 --> 01:16:29.640
And all of that has the effect
of dampening the probability

01:16:29.640 --> 01:16:31.490
of being successful in war.

01:16:31.490 --> 01:16:35.260
And assuming you believe
that putting our welfare,

01:16:35.260 --> 01:16:39.000
our lives at stake is
the right thing to do,

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.180
then you've got to be all in.

01:16:41.180 --> 01:16:43.440
And I think that much
of the causality

01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:46.210
of what happens during wartime
is the product of the sense

01:16:46.210 --> 01:16:50.590 position:56%
that if we're going to put
American lives at risk by the 1000's

01:16:50.590 --> 01:16:56.030
or millions, and America's wealth
at risk, and freedom ultimately

01:16:56.030 --> 01:16:58.920
at risk, then we have to be willing
to sacrifice almost everything.

01:16:58.920 --> 01:17:02.370
And that's what Wilson was sort of
saying when he was first advocating

01:17:02.370 --> 01:17:05.740
for his version of the Espionage
Act, which is that, you know,

01:17:05.740 --> 01:17:07.680
everything has to be
put in place so we win.

01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:09.230
That's the only thing that matters.

01:17:09.230 --> 01:17:11.620
Nothing else makes any difference.

01:17:11.620 --> 01:17:16.000
&gt;&gt; Jeremy Kessler: So I want
to emphasize how much war

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:20.160
at first did not change
the legal tradition, okay.

01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:24.710
You know, the traditional
understanding was we had this great

01:17:24.710 --> 01:17:28.640
theoretical tradition of freedom
of expression in the United States,

01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:34.100
but not much occasion to
invoke it until World War I,

01:17:34.100 --> 01:17:40.270
our first world war where the
country went crazy and overreacted

01:17:40.270 --> 01:17:44.250
and repressed civil liberties,
unprecedented in American history,

01:17:44.250 --> 01:17:46.560
against which there was
an ultimate reaction

01:17:46.560 --> 01:17:49.410
in favor of civil liberties.

01:17:49.410 --> 01:17:53.140
As I, to my surprise,
discovered, right,

01:17:53.140 --> 01:17:57.570
at least the judicial
tradition was extremely hostile

01:17:57.570 --> 01:18:03.990
to all free speech claims of every
[inaudible] imaginable throughout

01:18:03.990 --> 01:18:05.670
the 19th century.

01:18:05.670 --> 01:18:09.750
And World War I only
extended that tradition.

01:18:09.750 --> 01:18:15.490
It didn't change it at first,
but war as causal agent.

01:18:15.490 --> 01:18:18.470
I think many Americans
during the war

01:18:18.470 --> 01:18:22.980
for the first time
realized the consequences

01:18:22.980 --> 01:18:28.300
of this long-term repressive,
I would say, tradition.

01:18:28.300 --> 01:18:33.630
And also, Roger Baldwin
himself, the founder of the ACLU,

01:18:33.630 --> 01:18:36.380
many others, do we change?

01:18:36.380 --> 01:18:41.440
People for the first time started
thinking about the consequences

01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:45.740
of this tradition and worried
about it and decided we need

01:18:45.740 --> 01:18:49.110
to protect political speech more.

01:18:49.110 --> 01:18:54.430
So to a great extent, I think,
World War I transformed the views

01:18:54.430 --> 01:18:58.360
about free speech of many
people who later defended it,

01:18:58.360 --> 01:19:01.530
most obviously the
leaders of the ACLU.

01:19:01.530 --> 01:19:02.990
&gt;&gt; Geoffrey Stone: Can
I add a word to that?

01:19:02.990 --> 01:19:05.590
The transformation of
Oliver Wendell Holmes.

01:19:05.590 --> 01:19:06.890
&gt;&gt; Jeremy Kessler: Yes.

01:19:06.890 --> 01:19:08.190
&gt;&gt; Geoffrey Stone: Is
a critical example.

01:19:08.190 --> 01:19:09.490
&gt;&gt; Jeremy Kessler: Right.

01:19:09.490 --> 01:19:11.950
&gt;&gt; Geoffrey Stone: So as David
said in the first iteration

01:19:11.950 --> 01:19:14.490 position:56%
in which the Supreme Court addressed
the First Amendment question

01:19:14.490 --> 01:19:15.790
about whether these prosecutions

01:19:15.790 --> 01:19:17.890
under the Espionage Act
were constitutional,

01:19:17.890 --> 01:19:19.190
Holmes wrote these opinions,

01:19:19.190 --> 01:19:23.730
basically adopted the bad tendency
test, and affirmed the convictions

01:19:23.730 --> 01:19:26.520
without really writing a
serious opinion at all.

01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:30.320
And then over that next
summer he spent time thinking

01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:33.370
about free speech, the war
had ended, talking to people

01:19:33.370 --> 01:19:35.730
who had been critics
of his opinions,

01:19:35.730 --> 01:19:38.250
some academic, some
lower court judges.

01:19:38.250 --> 01:19:40.920
And comes back the following
fall, only a few months later,

01:19:40.920 --> 01:19:43.310
and writes a stirring opinion

01:19:43.310 --> 01:19:45.780
in which he now says you cannot
punish speech unless it creates a

01:19:45.780 --> 01:19:48.430
clear and present danger
of serious harm

01:19:48.430 --> 01:19:52.530
and launches the judicial tradition
of the protection of free speech

01:19:52.530 --> 01:19:55.180
that we now live with today.

01:19:55.180 --> 01:19:58.430
But that was also very much
the product of the fact

01:19:58.430 --> 01:20:01.650
that he did one thing, he
learned from that experience

01:20:01.650 --> 01:20:04.470
in only a few months to
his credit, came around,

01:20:04.470 --> 01:20:07.040
didn't admit he was wrong, of
course, but came around and --

01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:08.340
&gt;&gt; Jeremy Kessler: Which he
never did about anything.

01:20:08.340 --> 01:20:09.830
&gt;&gt; Geoffrey Stone: Right, never
did about anything, right.

01:20:09.830 --> 01:20:12.110 position:56%
Basically maintained all those
earlier decisions [inaudible] right,

01:20:12.110 --> 01:20:14.230
but never explained how they
could possibly be reconciled

01:20:14.230 --> 01:20:15.630
with his new approach.

01:20:15.630 --> 01:20:19.950
But then he became -- he became
really the initial spokesperson

01:20:19.950 --> 01:20:25.680
for the idea of a really robust
meaning of the First Amendment.

01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:27.740
&gt;&gt; Megan Ming Francis: In terms
of what war does, I think for me

01:20:27.740 --> 01:20:29.040
and thinking about the NAACP

01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:31.130
or black political
activism during this time,

01:20:31.130 --> 01:20:33.600
I think it made them
reevaluate what was meant

01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:35.150
by citizenship in this
country, right?

01:20:35.150 --> 01:20:37.790
And I kind of -- these treasured
American ideals, such as freedom

01:20:37.790 --> 01:20:42.800
and democracy, especially for those
who had volunteered for these kind

01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:45.820
like separated camps for
training and those who had gone

01:20:45.820 --> 01:20:47.550
and also come back, right?

01:20:47.550 --> 01:20:51.510
And I think especially for
those who served and came back

01:20:51.510 --> 01:20:54.050
and the violence that
occurred to them,

01:20:54.050 --> 01:20:56.880
and so I think one the well-known
examples is the African American

01:20:56.880 --> 01:21:02.690
soldier who's wearing his --
wearing his uniform in the south.

01:21:02.690 --> 01:21:04.320
I forget what city he's in.

01:21:04.320 --> 01:21:07.180
He is then harassed and then
his eyes are gouged out,

01:21:07.180 --> 01:21:09.640
in part because they
find it so offensive

01:21:09.640 --> 01:21:12.350
that this black man could be
wearing the uniform, right?

01:21:12.350 --> 01:21:14.370
And so there's all these
different moments of violence.

01:21:14.370 --> 01:21:18.030
And I think for them it
actually I think fueled them

01:21:18.030 --> 01:21:19.330
to push harder, right?

01:21:19.330 --> 01:21:22.170 position:56%
That if you want us to serve and die

01:21:22.170 --> 01:21:24.900
for this country then you all
got to do some more, right?

01:21:24.900 --> 01:21:27.550
And I think -- I mean,
just to pull a little bit

01:21:27.550 --> 01:21:31.380
on what Geoff was saying here about
Holmes, he's a fascinating justice.

01:21:31.380 --> 01:21:36.930
But I think it wasn't just
for the NAACP and or, right,

01:21:36.930 --> 01:21:38.810
like African Americans,
that kind of --

01:21:38.810 --> 01:21:43.090
that pushed them to reevaluate what
citizenship means in this country,

01:21:43.090 --> 01:21:44.660
but also for political elite.

01:21:44.660 --> 01:21:48.080 position:56%
So one of my favorites Supreme Court
cases is Morvey Dempsey [assumed

01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:52.110
spelling], a case decided by
-- a case decided in 1923.

01:21:52.110 --> 01:21:54.950
Holmes is going to write
the opinion of the court.

01:21:54.950 --> 01:21:57.460
And basically it's a case

01:21:57.460 --> 01:22:00.530
around these 12 African
American men Arkansas,

01:22:00.530 --> 01:22:03.360 position:56%
and which is the first case in which
the federal courts get involved

01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:04.660
in a state criminal court trial.

01:22:04.660 --> 01:22:07.770
And he's like, hey, you know what,
mob dominated trial that kind

01:22:07.770 --> 01:22:09.810
of violate the due
process clause, right.

01:22:09.810 --> 01:22:11.110
I don't know.

01:22:11.110 --> 01:22:13.090
But, and it's an important
-- and it's really important.

01:22:13.090 --> 01:22:15.300
I mean, on previous cases
that Holmes I think had been

01:22:15.300 --> 01:22:17.240
on the right side of history,
but he hadn't been able

01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:19.030
to get his fellow justices
on his side.

01:22:19.030 --> 01:22:21.470
And so this is kind of his
big vindication for him.

01:22:21.470 --> 01:22:24.890
So it's not just, I think, kind
of those on the ground or those

01:22:24.890 --> 01:22:29.300
who were marginalized, I think it's
also those elite, political elites,

01:22:29.300 --> 01:22:33.740
again who are -- who are
reevaluating this notion.

01:22:33.740 --> 01:22:35.400
&gt;&gt; David Rabban: Thanks.

01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:39.460
So how -- yeah, this is like
one of the biggest problems

01:22:39.460 --> 01:22:40.980
that I think I've struggled with.

01:22:40.980 --> 01:22:46.420 position:56%
And I know Mary has -- Mary and many
other legal historians have really

01:22:46.420 --> 01:22:48.090
shed some light on,
how to deal with the --

01:22:48.090 --> 01:22:52.060
what is the causal relationship
between war as this kind

01:22:52.060 --> 01:22:55.900
of an event, a sort of
exogenous shock to the system,

01:22:55.900 --> 01:23:00.380
and then the individual, whether
it be executive official or judge

01:23:00.380 --> 01:23:02.550
or social movement activist?

01:23:02.550 --> 01:23:05.260
I think that one way
of getting at that,

01:23:05.260 --> 01:23:10.700
and it's actually been
suggested in some of David

01:23:10.700 --> 01:23:15.350
and Megan's remarks just now,
is to introduce a third category

01:23:15.350 --> 01:23:22.230 position:56%
between the two, which are
longer-term and long-running social,

01:23:22.230 --> 01:23:24.430
cultural, and economic conflicts

01:23:24.430 --> 01:23:26.960
that predate the war
and that postdate it.

01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:29.540
I think it's really
important to understand

01:23:29.540 --> 01:23:35.050
that war emerges precisely
from the social, cultural,

01:23:35.050 --> 01:23:37.890
and economic conflicts, both
nationally and internationally,

01:23:37.890 --> 01:23:41.950
and that war then does indeed
overdetermine those social,

01:23:41.950 --> 01:23:43.270
cultural, and economic conflicts.

01:23:43.270 --> 01:23:45.380
Now, how does it overdetermine it?

01:23:45.380 --> 01:23:51.380 position:56%
Here I think like I would -- I would
point to Geoff's point about unity.

01:23:51.380 --> 01:23:52.680
So you have a war.

01:23:52.680 --> 01:23:56.220
It's complex and we argue
over why exactly it emerges

01:23:56.220 --> 01:23:57.520
at a particular time.

01:23:57.520 --> 01:24:01.580
But once we decide we're going
to have a war, unit, unity,

01:24:01.580 --> 01:24:05.310
collective sacrifice,
rationalization,

01:24:05.310 --> 01:24:08.610
all of these, this is needed.

01:24:08.610 --> 01:24:13.780
On the one hand that push
for unity will indeed kind

01:24:13.780 --> 01:24:18.530
of sometimes suppress many
of the social, cultural,

01:24:18.530 --> 01:24:21.330
economic actors involved in
the preexisting conflict.

01:24:21.330 --> 01:24:22.630
So on the one hand that search

01:24:22.630 --> 01:24:27.820
for unity will kind
of shutdown conflict.

01:24:27.820 --> 01:24:32.510
But on the other hand, the very
fact that the state needs unity

01:24:32.510 --> 01:24:36.510
to run the war actually
renders it vulnerable,

01:24:36.510 --> 01:24:40.520
and perhaps newly vulnerable to
some of these conflicts and to some

01:24:40.520 --> 01:24:42.480
of these social forces
involved in them.

01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:46.430
So precisely to get the unity
that's needed to fight the war,

01:24:46.430 --> 01:24:52.130
the state needs to begin to try to
conciliate some of the conflicts

01:24:52.130 --> 01:24:56.580
that previously could just burn.

01:24:56.580 --> 01:24:57.920
You know, did not -- did not --

01:24:57.920 --> 01:25:00.310
the state did not necessarily
have an immediate reason to deal

01:25:00.310 --> 01:25:03.080
with some of the conflicts and
with some of the social movements

01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:08.470
or social groups prior to
needing everyone to come together

01:25:08.470 --> 01:25:09.770
to fight the war effectively.

01:25:09.770 --> 01:25:12.650
So that -- I would -- I would
introduce that third category,

01:25:12.650 --> 01:25:16.580
mediating between the individual
and the war event as crucial.

01:25:16.580 --> 01:25:17.910
&gt;&gt; Mary Dudziak: Yeah, this
is interesting and helpful.

01:25:17.910 --> 01:25:20.610
And as you were speaking I was
thinking of, it's Randolph Bourne,

01:25:20.610 --> 01:25:22.670
right, who says, war is
the health of the state.

01:25:22.670 --> 01:25:25.810
And that it's, you know,
in war that people sort

01:25:25.810 --> 01:25:29.690
of see the state, he said.

01:25:29.690 --> 01:25:36.120
And so this sort of connection
between moments when there's a need

01:25:36.120 --> 01:25:40.680
for sort of broad-based support
for a government project,

01:25:40.680 --> 01:25:46.790
which we call war, you know, that's
a point when there are these sort

01:25:46.790 --> 01:25:49.750
of -- as well as sort of the social
and cultural dynamics that come

01:25:49.750 --> 01:25:55.350
out in the First Amendment context,
the importance of, you know,

01:25:55.350 --> 01:25:59.690
forms of state formation and their
relationship to the polity, the war

01:25:59.690 --> 01:26:03.520
and the health -- the health of
the state we're seeing happening.

01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:07.040
I would just say as an aside, that
this idea about the need for unity,

01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:10.660
etcetera, you know, we can
probably be on the same page right

01:26:10.660 --> 01:26:12.740
about through World
War II on that story,

01:26:12.740 --> 01:26:16.140
and then of course American
history starts looking differently,

01:26:16.140 --> 01:26:18.430
lots of ideas about how
and why that happens,

01:26:18.430 --> 01:26:20.600
but really beyond the
scope of the panel.

01:26:20.600 --> 01:26:24.620
Can I just ask a Holmes question,
Holmes and, more broadly,

01:26:24.620 --> 01:26:28.040
thinkers at this time, because
as you're talking about Holmes,

01:26:28.040 --> 01:26:30.570
who is so important on the
Supreme Court at this point,

01:26:30.570 --> 01:26:35.840
and Holmes is one of the many
important, in this period,

01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:38.170
Civil War veterans, right?

01:26:38.170 --> 01:26:44.640
And Holmes, when he was in the
war, talked about it as barbarism.

01:26:44.640 --> 01:26:48.770
You know, and he himself
was injured could have died,

01:26:48.770 --> 01:26:51.790
and really talks about
war as barbarity.

01:26:51.790 --> 01:26:54.110
And then later on, I
think was in a -- in a --

01:26:54.110 --> 01:26:59.490
in a graduation address in
1895, you know basically talks

01:26:59.490 --> 01:27:02.240 position:56%
about how wonderful it is, you know,

01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:06.720
to have had the opportunity
to participate in war.

01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:11.480
And so he goes from
hating war as barbarous

01:27:11.480 --> 01:27:15.060
to celebrating young
men going off to sort

01:27:15.060 --> 01:27:18.270
of sacrifice their lives
for, you know, anything.

01:27:18.270 --> 01:27:24.200 position:56%
And then in Congress, the members of
Congress who declare war on Germany,

01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:30.550 position:56%
there were I believe it was 16 Civil
War veterans in Congress who sort

01:27:30.550 --> 01:27:35.700
of came together, the blue and
the gray, to march with Americans

01:27:35.700 --> 01:27:38.340
who were being drafted
for World War I.

01:27:38.340 --> 01:27:41.710
So there's this sort of
intergenerational thing happening,

01:27:41.710 --> 01:27:45.380
and I just wondered what you think
either with respect to Holmes

01:27:45.380 --> 01:27:49.000
or other important actors?

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:53.000
How is this sort of Civil War
memory experience filtering

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:56.030
through their thinking
about World War I?

01:27:56.030 --> 01:27:57.330
&gt;&gt; Geoffrey Stone: He was
looking at something --

01:27:57.330 --> 01:28:00.170
&gt;&gt; Jeremy Kessler: I'm trying to
look up his language in the --

01:28:00.170 --> 01:28:02.850
even in the case, whereas
Geoff said,

01:28:02.850 --> 01:28:08.130 position:56%
he first offered a vigorous
defense of the right of free speech.

01:28:08.130 --> 01:28:11.930
He said, right before that,
prosecution of opinions

01:28:11.930 --> 01:28:17.410
with which we disagree is
perfectly natural and predictable.

01:28:17.410 --> 01:28:20.860
If we were sure of our
convictions we would enforce them.

01:28:20.860 --> 01:28:27.490
It was an anti-free speech prelude
to a pro free speech statement,

01:28:27.490 --> 01:28:29.630
and he said, but often
we're not so sure.

01:28:29.630 --> 01:28:31.980
That's -- but I would
say his experience

01:28:31.980 --> 01:28:34.550
in the war made him
skeptical about rights,

01:28:34.550 --> 01:28:37.010
made him respectful of power.

01:28:37.010 --> 01:28:41.970
And it -- he had to overcome that
to get to his pro free speech fuse.

01:28:41.970 --> 01:28:45.400
They didn't help produce them
would be my interpretation.

01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:46.700
&gt;&gt; Geoffrey Stone: Yeah,
I think that's right, too.

01:28:46.700 --> 01:28:48.050
I think that's right, too.

01:28:48.050 --> 01:28:50.650
&gt;&gt; David Rabban: One, I think
the Civil War background is

01:28:50.650 --> 01:28:52.060
very important.

01:28:52.060 --> 01:28:55.480
But so, too, more proximate in time

01:28:55.480 --> 01:28:59.420
to World War I I would say is
say is putting these actors

01:28:59.420 --> 01:29:05.430
into the context of the imperial
moment the late 19th century.

01:29:05.430 --> 01:29:07.430
And in both in the
United States and in --

01:29:07.430 --> 01:29:12.430
and in the UK, and in Europe at
this moment, what you really see

01:29:12.430 --> 01:29:19.470 position:56%
at the turn of the 20th century is I
think two extreme views of violence

01:29:19.470 --> 01:29:25.280 position:56%
that were perhaps at their most --
their kind of modern popular height,

01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:27.200
and that after this
moment we're going

01:29:27.200 --> 01:29:31.020
to see an interesting new third
possibility, or synthesis emerge.

01:29:31.020 --> 01:29:33.930
So the two extreme
views are pacifism.

01:29:33.930 --> 01:29:36.780
Pacifism is huge at this moment.

01:29:36.780 --> 01:29:41.220
Now, not everyone felt this
meant the same thing by pacifism,

01:29:41.220 --> 01:29:42.780
but it's astonishing the number.

01:29:42.780 --> 01:29:45.830
I mentioned that the
secretary of war

01:29:45.830 --> 01:29:49.070
and his second-in-command during
World War I was a pacifist

01:29:49.070 --> 01:29:50.370
and had been members of the --

01:29:50.370 --> 01:29:54.560
some of the major international
pacifist antiwar organizations

01:29:54.560 --> 01:29:55.900
in the world at this moment.

01:29:55.900 --> 01:29:58.830
So on the one hand you have
this rich culture of pacifism,

01:29:58.830 --> 01:30:02.620
on the other hand, in this -- I
think we see in the later Holmes,

01:30:02.620 --> 01:30:07.520
the 1895 Holmes, you have the idea
of regeneration through violence.

01:30:07.520 --> 01:30:09.880 position:56%
There is this worry about decadence.

01:30:09.880 --> 01:30:11.180
There's some -- there's this worry

01:30:11.180 --> 01:30:14.100
about industrial civilization
leading

01:30:14.100 --> 01:30:16.650
to weak bodies and weak minds.

01:30:16.650 --> 01:30:19.940
And there is a cult of
violence that emerges at the --

01:30:19.940 --> 01:30:21.590
at the turn of the 20th century.

01:30:21.590 --> 01:30:24.010
What I think begins to
happen after World War I,

01:30:24.010 --> 01:30:26.800
and is very much associated
with America --

01:30:26.800 --> 01:30:30.760
what we call American liberalism,
midcentury liberalism for better

01:30:30.760 --> 01:30:36.460 position:56%
or worse, is a -- the emergence of
a third position that is comfortable

01:30:36.460 --> 01:30:38.660
with war, relatively
comfortable with war,

01:30:38.660 --> 01:30:42.890
does not consider it a
absolute moral nightmare,

01:30:42.890 --> 01:30:47.880
but thinks it can be wielded
or managed constructively

01:30:47.880 --> 01:30:51.820
for the betterment
of global society.

01:30:51.820 --> 01:30:56.470
And that is a position that doesn't
really exist prior to World War I.

01:30:56.470 --> 01:30:57.770
&gt;&gt; Mary Dudziak: Yeah.

01:30:57.770 --> 01:30:59.750
&gt;&gt; Jeremy Kessler: I'd like to read
the six sentences or so of Holmes.

01:30:59.750 --> 01:31:01.050
Could I?

01:31:01.050 --> 01:31:02.350
&gt;&gt; Mary Dudziak: Of course.

01:31:02.350 --> 01:31:03.650
&gt;&gt; Jeremy Kessler: Holmes
was a brilliant writer.

01:31:03.650 --> 01:31:07.480
But I do think this is
like the major indication

01:31:07.480 --> 01:31:09.290
of the shift in his own views.

01:31:09.290 --> 01:31:12.740
And you'll see some very
familiar language here.

01:31:12.740 --> 01:31:16.450
So this is Holmes in Abrams.

01:31:16.450 --> 01:31:19.270
Persecution for the expression

01:31:19.270 --> 01:31:22.850
of opinions seems to
me perfectly logical.

01:31:22.850 --> 01:31:26.440
If you have no doubt of
your premises or your power,

01:31:26.440 --> 01:31:29.360
and want a certain result
with all your heart,

01:31:29.360 --> 01:31:34.110 position:56%
you naturally express your wishes in
law, and sweep away all opposition.

01:31:34.110 --> 01:31:37.880
To allow opposition by
speech seems to indicate

01:31:37.880 --> 01:31:41.020
that you think speech is
impotent, as when a man says

01:31:41.020 --> 01:31:44.640
that he has squared the circle, or
that you do not care wholeheartedly

01:31:44.640 --> 01:31:49.500
for the result, or that you doubt
either your power or your premises.

01:31:49.500 --> 01:31:52.440
That's not very free speech, is it?

01:31:52.440 --> 01:31:58.520 position:56%
But when men have realized that
time has upset many fighting faiths,

01:31:58.520 --> 01:32:01.240
they may come to believe
even more than they believe

01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:03.710
in the very foundations
of their own conduct

01:32:03.710 --> 01:32:07.040
that the ultimate good desired
is better reached by free trade

01:32:07.040 --> 01:32:11.320
in ideas, that the best test of
truth is the power of the thought

01:32:11.320 --> 01:32:14.330
to get accepted in the
competition of the market,

01:32:14.330 --> 01:32:16.540
and that truth is the
only ground upon

01:32:16.540 --> 01:32:19.500
which their wishes
safely can be carried out.

01:32:19.500 --> 01:32:22.430
That, at any rate, is the
theory of our Constitution.

01:32:22.430 --> 01:32:25.690
It is an experiment, as
all life is an experiment.

01:32:25.690 --> 01:32:29.240 position:56%
That's how Holmes changed his views.

01:32:29.240 --> 01:32:31.920
And he became -- he
doubted the very foundations

01:32:31.920 --> 01:32:34.140
of his own thoughts
about free speech.

01:32:34.140 --> 01:32:37.420
I think he's expressing here
the change in his own views

01:32:37.420 --> 01:32:42.030
as a very powerful defense
of free speech, okay.

01:32:42.030 --> 01:32:44.250
He's a good writer,
right [laughter]?

01:32:44.250 --> 01:32:45.550
&gt;&gt; Mary Dudziak: Did you --

01:32:45.550 --> 01:32:46.850
&gt;&gt; David Rabban: I'm good.

01:32:46.850 --> 01:32:48.630
&gt;&gt; Mary Dudziak: Okay.

01:32:48.630 --> 01:32:51.320
So do -- let's -- do we --

01:32:51.320 --> 01:32:54.810
do we want to think a
little more about courts?

01:32:54.810 --> 01:32:58.690
And maybe we start
with Jeremy and Megan.

01:32:58.690 --> 01:33:03.340
And you're talking about activities
that are happening outside

01:33:03.340 --> 01:33:09.590
of courts, but to what degree does
the -- what the court's doing?

01:33:09.590 --> 01:33:12.560
Because a lot of times when we
do civil liberties now we tend

01:33:12.560 --> 01:33:14.460
to focus especially on courts.

01:33:14.460 --> 01:33:19.100 position:56%
It's been important to think outside
of courts, but then I kind of wonder

01:33:19.100 --> 01:33:22.130
about the relationship either
between social movements

01:33:22.130 --> 01:33:26.220
and what's happening judicially,
or courts as sites of, you know,

01:33:26.220 --> 01:33:29.380
coming together, like
criminal trial,

01:33:29.380 --> 01:33:32.510
as places where communities
get mobilized?

01:33:32.510 --> 01:33:37.110
But, so how do -- how do
courts relate to your project?

01:33:37.110 --> 01:33:39.890
And then coming back
to David and Geoff,

01:33:39.890 --> 01:33:43.180
what are the broader stories
outside of these [inaudible] cases

01:33:43.180 --> 01:33:48.230
that we can think about with
regard to courts during this era?

01:33:48.230 --> 01:33:49.530
&gt;&gt; David Rabban: So
two thoughts on that.

01:33:49.530 --> 01:33:52.790
So first, to the extent
that one accepts this idea

01:33:52.790 --> 01:33:57.030
that where civil libertarian
rights come from,

01:33:57.030 --> 01:34:02.320
what produces them is the exertion
of state power, that the provision

01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:08.340
of civil liberties is a function
of the state to giving it to masses

01:34:08.340 --> 01:34:13.400
of people, courts are not going
to be the obvious institution

01:34:13.400 --> 01:34:16.190
that is providing those civil
libertarian rights courts.

01:34:16.190 --> 01:34:17.920
Courts adjudicate individual cases.

01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:20.640
And in cases of controversies
they do establish precedence

01:34:20.640 --> 01:34:25.940
that then bind the populace as
a whole, but generally we tend

01:34:25.940 --> 01:34:32.740
to think of legislatures
or administrative agencies

01:34:32.740 --> 01:34:39.330
as in a much better position to
craft policy for an entire polity,

01:34:39.330 --> 01:34:41.030
or at least large social groups.

01:34:41.030 --> 01:34:45.250
So if -- so if one
accepts kind of my story,

01:34:45.250 --> 01:34:47.480
then that's one reason
why you would think

01:34:47.480 --> 01:34:51.780
that non-judicial institutions
are the more effective supplier

01:34:51.780 --> 01:34:53.330 position:56%
of civil liberties and civil rights.

01:34:53.330 --> 01:34:57.460 position:56%
However, my second point is, I think
in general one just doesn't want

01:34:57.460 --> 01:35:01.080
to make the mistake of being
formalistic about this.

01:35:01.080 --> 01:35:04.410
Of thinking that there
is some, and this is --

01:35:04.410 --> 01:35:07.240
this is an idea that it's
very difficult to resist

01:35:07.240 --> 01:35:10.080
in the legal academy,
that there is some kind

01:35:10.080 --> 01:35:13.820
of essential institutional
competence that one branch

01:35:13.820 --> 01:35:16.620
of government as opposed to
another branch of government has.

01:35:16.620 --> 01:35:20.200
I think the main reason
why the NAACP and the ACLU

01:35:20.200 --> 01:35:25.870
in its early years and
labor activists went

01:35:25.870 --> 01:35:29.680
to the Wilson administration and
then the Harding administration,

01:35:29.680 --> 01:35:31.960
and the [inaudible] administration,
and the Hoover administration,

01:35:31.960 --> 01:35:36.120 position:56%
and the FDR administration
throughout that entire period is not

01:35:36.120 --> 01:35:39.690
because they had that theory
I just had about, you know,

01:35:39.690 --> 01:35:44.220
the different -- the different
competencies of these institutions

01:35:44.220 --> 01:35:50.140 position:56%
as such, but is because they saw
the federal courts as being occupied

01:35:50.140 --> 01:35:55.120 position:56%
by their class and social enemies,
and they were very clear about that.

01:35:55.120 --> 01:36:02.640 position:56%
That the federal courts were largely
populated by very elite social group

01:36:02.640 --> 01:36:05.320
and were almost entirely
unsympathetic

01:36:05.320 --> 01:36:08.620
with a few notable
exceptions to the claims

01:36:08.620 --> 01:36:12.080
of marginal social
and economic groups.

01:36:12.080 --> 01:36:15.180
And so they just said, well, we'll
don't really think they're going

01:36:15.180 --> 01:36:19.400
to help us out that much, no
matter how clever our arguments.

01:36:19.400 --> 01:36:21.080
&gt;&gt; Megan Ming Francis:
So for me in terms

01:36:21.080 --> 01:36:24.040
of the NAACP during this
period, kind of what the role

01:36:24.040 --> 01:36:28.030
of courts here, I mean,
the way that I end --

01:36:28.030 --> 01:36:31.070
the way that I end my book
project is a chapter on the courts.

01:36:31.070 --> 01:36:34.430
What the NAACP does, right, is they
focus on these different branches

01:36:34.430 --> 01:36:37.650
of government and then the
argument that I make is

01:36:37.650 --> 01:36:42.770
that there's this big Supreme
Court case that happens in 1923.

01:36:42.770 --> 01:36:46.550
And the NAA -- and part of
the reason why, a little bit,

01:36:46.550 --> 01:36:48.880
very kind of similar to what
Jeremy here is talking about,

01:36:48.880 --> 01:36:51.270
the reason why they're -- it's --

01:36:51.270 --> 01:36:54.800 position:56%
they're not going to courts
initially is because they don't find

01:36:54.800 --> 01:36:58.230
that courts, or think that courts
will be friendly, especially trying

01:36:58.230 --> 01:37:01.260
to litigate cases around criminal
procedure in the south, right?

01:37:01.260 --> 01:37:04.750
They don't believe that local
and state courts will decide

01:37:04.750 --> 01:37:07.310
on their behalf, and nor do
they think that they're going

01:37:07.310 --> 01:37:12.000
to be able take these
cases outside of the south.

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.370
And so that at some level was a
nonissue, and you go through kind

01:37:14.370 --> 01:37:17.510
of the early, at least first
decade of the NAACP papers

01:37:17.510 --> 01:37:20.050
and board minutes, and
it's like a nonfactor.

01:37:20.050 --> 01:37:22.860
They're not -- I mean, every now
and then somebody will bring up,

01:37:22.860 --> 01:37:25.610
oh perhaps, right, in terms
of their legal division

01:37:25.610 --> 01:37:29.010
that perhaps we should like file
court case and it's dismissed

01:37:29.010 --> 01:37:31.220
because they don't
think that they're going

01:37:31.220 --> 01:37:33.340
to make any types of
inroads in courts.

01:37:33.340 --> 01:37:37.720
This horrible incident
happens in 1919,

01:37:37.720 --> 01:37:40.770
and they eventually then begin
legal proceedings in the state

01:37:40.770 --> 01:37:44.680
of Arkansas, and then
they eventually are able,

01:37:44.680 --> 01:37:48.800
by a mistake at some
level, they're able to --

01:37:48.800 --> 01:37:51.560
they're able to get the
case outside of the state

01:37:51.560 --> 01:37:54.480
of Arkansas into the Supreme Court.

01:37:54.480 --> 01:37:57.080
But there was this -- I mean,
the way that they also talk

01:37:57.080 --> 01:37:59.390
about things, if they can
just get it into the kind

01:37:59.390 --> 01:38:03.250
of the federal court system
at least then perhaps --

01:38:03.250 --> 01:38:05.110
then they'll actually
have a fighting chance.

01:38:05.110 --> 01:38:07.920 position:56%
But part of the reason they're going
to focus more attention on courts,

01:38:07.920 --> 01:38:10.010
and this is what I argue
at the end of the --

01:38:10.010 --> 01:38:13.430
of the teens and the early 1920's,
is because they're not getting

01:38:13.430 --> 01:38:15.510
that much from the
presidents, right?

01:38:15.510 --> 01:38:17.460
They're not getting
that much on the ground.

01:38:17.460 --> 01:38:18.910
And they're -- and Congress,

01:38:18.910 --> 01:38:23.130
and these anti-lynching bills
are dying in committee, right?

01:38:23.130 --> 01:38:24.990
So nothing is moving.

01:38:24.990 --> 01:38:29.120
And so the way that I, at least I
understand the NAACP's relationship

01:38:29.120 --> 01:38:34.230 position:56%
to courts in the first quarter of
the 20th century, it's the last kind

01:38:34.230 --> 01:38:36.280
of -- the last frontier in terms

01:38:36.280 --> 01:38:39.090
of a federal government
institution for them, right?

01:38:39.090 --> 01:38:41.800
They get this big win and the
argument obviously that I make is

01:38:41.800 --> 01:38:44.630
that it then puts them on a new
path of development and a new way

01:38:44.630 --> 01:38:47.370
of seeing kind of the pathway
forwards for civil rights.

01:38:47.370 --> 01:38:50.560
And then they begin this massive
obviously campaign at the end

01:38:50.560 --> 01:38:54.930
of the 1920's, beginning of the
'30s, around education segregation.

01:38:54.930 --> 01:38:58.690
But initially, kind of courts
are not viewed as friendly.

01:38:58.690 --> 01:39:03.380
They are viewed -- courts outside,
more friendly I think later on,

01:39:03.380 --> 01:39:06.240
but that was only as a result of
these other branches of government,

01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:10.740
at least in their eyes not getting
-- not getting what they want.

01:39:10.740 --> 01:39:13.650
&gt;&gt; Jeremy Kessler: So I just
want to refer to a book published

01:39:13.650 --> 01:39:17.550
by Geoff's colleague, [inaudible],
others have mentioned all ready,

01:39:17.550 --> 01:39:23.740
and she emphasizes correctly
that the ACLU in its early years

01:39:23.740 --> 01:39:28.820
of existence following World War I
expressly did not go to the courts

01:39:28.820 --> 01:39:30.580
to vindicate free speech claims.

01:39:30.580 --> 01:39:31.990
They went to administrators.

01:39:31.990 --> 01:39:33.910
They worked on their own.

01:39:33.910 --> 01:39:37.290
They had no hope for the courts
because the courts were --

01:39:37.290 --> 01:39:40.880
had been so unsympathetic
of free speech claims.

01:39:40.880 --> 01:39:45.020
Laura's [assumed spelling] probably
most innovative argument I think is

01:39:45.020 --> 01:39:49.470
when the ACLU ultimately turned
to the courts in the '30s

01:39:49.470 --> 01:39:52.960
and got some free speech victories.

01:39:52.960 --> 01:39:54.980
They were double-edged.

01:39:54.980 --> 01:39:57.260
And I think her book is called
The Taming of Free Speech.

01:39:57.260 --> 01:40:01.750
And her point is, the ACLU's
more progressive interpretation

01:40:01.750 --> 01:40:05.510
of free speech was compromised
when they worked kind

01:40:05.510 --> 01:40:09.400
of across the political spectrum
and tried to get the Supreme Court,

01:40:09.400 --> 01:40:11.050
a more receptive Supreme Court,
to accept free speech arguments.

01:40:11.050 --> 01:40:14.660 position:56%
So that's one thing I wanted to say.

01:40:14.660 --> 01:40:17.790
The second thing, I don't know
how many of you are lawyers here

01:40:17.790 --> 01:40:19.720
or have come across this argument.

01:40:19.720 --> 01:40:22.720
I was taught, I think I was even
taught this in high school civics,

01:40:22.720 --> 01:40:27.540
but it came through in law
school, what is the role

01:40:27.540 --> 01:40:32.280
of the unelected judiciary
in the system

01:40:32.280 --> 01:40:33.970
of government in the United States?

01:40:33.970 --> 01:40:35.340
How can you defend that?

01:40:35.340 --> 01:40:37.840
And judicial review is
stronger in the United States

01:40:37.840 --> 01:40:40.490
than virtually any other
country in the world.

01:40:40.490 --> 01:40:45.320
It's because the judges could
defend individual rights,

01:40:45.320 --> 01:40:48.860
such as free speech,
against popular majorities,

01:40:48.860 --> 01:40:52.210
the people generally,
even the legislatures.

01:40:52.210 --> 01:40:57.060
That was overwhelmingly
the lesson in law school.

01:40:57.060 --> 01:40:59.650
So I was surprised.

01:40:59.650 --> 01:41:02.370
I did research on the
history of free speech,

01:41:02.370 --> 01:41:04.260
and I wasn't investigating
this issue.

01:41:04.260 --> 01:41:10.530
You know, there was no
institution less sympathetic

01:41:10.530 --> 01:41:13.540
to free speech claims than
the American judiciary.

01:41:13.540 --> 01:41:17.260 position:56%
I'm saying compared to police
commissioners were more sympathetic,

01:41:17.260 --> 01:41:18.560
okay.

01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:20.750
So that's just a fact.

01:41:20.750 --> 01:41:22.050
And it makes me wonder.

01:41:22.050 --> 01:41:29.550
You know, it's true that the
courts during [inaudible] in court,

01:41:29.550 --> 01:41:36.320
did protect individual civil
liberties, including free-speech.

01:41:36.320 --> 01:41:44.460
I wonder whether that might be an
exception to the long tradition.

01:41:44.460 --> 01:41:48.610
Anyway, the history of repression
of free speech casts doubt

01:41:48.610 --> 01:41:55.530 position:56%
on the alleged role of the judiciary
that's protecting individual rights.

01:41:55.530 --> 01:41:57.570
&gt;&gt; Geoffrey Stone:
So I would build on,

01:41:57.570 --> 01:42:00.160
or vary a bit from
what David just said.

01:42:00.160 --> 01:42:04.920
One of the questions one might
ask is, why do we have a judiciary

01:42:04.920 --> 01:42:08.110
that is authorized to
interpret the Constitution,

01:42:08.110 --> 01:42:12.570 position:56%
and to override the judgments of the
elected branches of the government,

01:42:12.570 --> 01:42:14.440
at least with respect
to certain areas

01:42:14.440 --> 01:42:16.540
that are governed by
the Constitution.

01:42:16.540 --> 01:42:19.890
And the reason for that was
that the framers understood

01:42:19.890 --> 01:42:23.080
that majoritarian rule
was dangerous.

01:42:23.080 --> 01:42:26.330
It had obvious advantages
relative to a monarchy,

01:42:26.330 --> 01:42:30.200
but it also was dangerous
because majorities will misbehave.

01:42:30.200 --> 01:42:32.690
And one of the reasons
that they settled

01:42:32.690 --> 01:42:36.690
on adopting ultimately a Bill
of Rights and looking explicitly

01:42:36.690 --> 01:42:39.780
to the courts to be the ones
who would enforce that was

01:42:39.780 --> 01:42:44.520
because with life tenure and
with the training and enforcement

01:42:44.520 --> 01:42:48.350
of the laws, judges
would have insulation

01:42:48.350 --> 01:42:50.890
against the political
process and would understand

01:42:50.890 --> 01:42:52.490
that their responsibility was

01:42:52.490 --> 01:42:55.440
to protect those rights
against majorities.

01:42:55.440 --> 01:42:58.960
Now, in a more refined
view, the precise areas

01:42:58.960 --> 01:43:04.720
in which I think courts are
most needed are those situations

01:43:04.720 --> 01:43:09.160
in which laws disadvantage
historically oppressed groups,

01:43:09.160 --> 01:43:12.800 position:56%
disadvantaged groups, who are likely
to be disadvantaged in majoritarian

01:43:12.800 --> 01:43:15.700
and political process because
they're not adequately represented.

01:43:15.700 --> 01:43:20.230 position:56%
And also, when the political
process attempts to redefine itself,

01:43:20.230 --> 01:43:23.810 position:56%
either through the electoral process
or through regulating free speech

01:43:23.810 --> 01:43:25.990
in a way that perpetuates
its own authority,

01:43:25.990 --> 01:43:28.270
it keeps itself in
office indefinitely.

01:43:28.270 --> 01:43:30.660
Those are the two areas in
which it's most important

01:43:30.660 --> 01:43:32.710
for judges to be aggressive.

01:43:32.710 --> 01:43:36.950 position:56%
So the question then is, why haven't
judges always or often, in fact,

01:43:36.950 --> 01:43:39.420
fulfilled those responsibilities?

01:43:39.420 --> 01:43:43.190
Part of it is, judges have
been reluctant in many times

01:43:43.190 --> 01:43:46.630
in our history to override
the judgments

01:43:46.630 --> 01:43:48.710
of the elected branches
of government.

01:43:48.710 --> 01:43:50.520
They've been timid
in their willingness

01:43:50.520 --> 01:43:52.800
to exercise a responsibility.

01:43:52.800 --> 01:43:57.490
Second is that sometimes they have
not their responsibility correctly

01:43:57.490 --> 01:44:01.640
and they thought they were
originalists or whatever

01:44:01.640 --> 01:44:04.560
and didn't really understand
what constitutional law

01:44:04.560 --> 01:44:07.830
from their perspective was
most fundamentally about.

01:44:07.830 --> 01:44:12.820
And I think that the war in court I
think was probably the best period

01:44:12.820 --> 01:44:16.080
of American history in which if you
look at the decisions of the war

01:44:16.080 --> 01:44:18.600
in court, they actually
did a pretty good job

01:44:18.600 --> 01:44:22.280
of fulfilling the two particular
areas that I identified.

01:44:22.280 --> 01:44:29.090
That is, protecting against one --
guaranteeing one person one vote,

01:44:29.090 --> 01:44:32.360
[inaudible] wide range of
restrictions on freedom of speech,

01:44:32.360 --> 01:44:36.240
and guaranteeing in Brown and
Board of Education and Loving

01:44:36.240 --> 01:44:39.710
versus Virginia the
rights of minorities.

01:44:39.710 --> 01:44:42.510
But I think that's been kind
of an anomaly in our history.

01:44:42.510 --> 01:44:46.630
And part of the problem is that
presidents have appointed justices

01:44:46.630 --> 01:44:50.310
with goals other than that,

01:44:50.310 --> 01:44:53.960 position:56%
and those goals are often completely
incompatible with those values.

01:44:53.960 --> 01:44:57.070
So you see the current Supreme
Court, for example, holding things

01:44:57.070 --> 01:44:59.650
that campaign finance
laws unconstitutional,

01:44:59.650 --> 01:45:03.650
and holding affirmative action
unconstitutional, and those are two

01:45:03.650 --> 01:45:05.310
of many possible examples,

01:45:05.310 --> 01:45:09.110
or I would say are just total
abuse of judicial review.

01:45:09.110 --> 01:45:11.390
They are not enforcing
what the responsibility

01:45:11.390 --> 01:45:13.320
of the courts is to enforce.

01:45:13.320 --> 01:45:15.190
So the idea of having courts

01:45:15.190 --> 01:45:17.620
with really strong judicial
review is a great idea.

01:45:17.620 --> 01:45:20.910
It's a critical and
valuable component

01:45:20.910 --> 01:45:22.680
to a well-functioning democracy.

01:45:22.680 --> 01:45:25.350
But you've got to have judges
who under what their job is,

01:45:25.350 --> 01:45:29.360
and too often in our
history they haven't.

01:45:29.360 --> 01:45:30.660
&gt;&gt; Mary Dudziak: So helpful.

01:45:30.660 --> 01:45:32.720
You know what I'd like to do
is, we've got a few more minutes

01:45:32.720 --> 01:45:35.360
and then I want to have
your questions and comments.

01:45:35.360 --> 01:45:39.830
And why don't -- why doesn't
everyone say a little bit about,

01:45:39.830 --> 01:45:43.380
because so much happens
right after 19 --

01:45:43.380 --> 01:45:45.260 position:56%
you know, so the Red Summer of 1919.

01:45:45.260 --> 01:45:48.600
There were race riots, you know,
right at the end of World War I.

01:45:48.600 --> 01:45:53.580
There is also a Red Scare that
breaks out in, you know, 1919.

01:45:53.580 --> 01:45:57.450
And after [inaudible] rather then
we go from period of repression

01:45:57.450 --> 01:45:59.840
to period of celebration of rights,

01:45:59.840 --> 01:46:01.880
we go into another
period of repression.

01:46:01.880 --> 01:46:05.000
So, you know, can you say a
little bit about what you think

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:11.830
of as this sort of legacy, or sort
of aftereffects of this period,

01:46:11.830 --> 01:46:18.160
what kind of trajectory are we
seeing for civil liberties coming

01:46:18.160 --> 01:46:21.030
out of the World War I years?

01:46:22.050 --> 01:46:23.350
Go ahead.

01:46:23.350 --> 01:46:27.760 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David Rabban: So I would say that
clearly both the Red Scare and then,

01:46:27.760 --> 01:46:31.790
you know, famously the
republican administration

01:46:31.790 --> 01:46:41.360
of the 1920's are not -- even
before we get to the Red Scare

01:46:41.360 --> 01:46:43.760
or republican administration
of the 1920's,

01:46:43.760 --> 01:46:46.600
I actually think perhaps
the most salient phenomenon,

01:46:46.600 --> 01:46:48.460
at least for the civil liberty --

01:46:48.460 --> 01:46:51.160
the civil libertarian
story I would want to tell,

01:46:51.160 --> 01:46:53.870
which the puts the
administrative state,

01:46:53.870 --> 01:46:57.830
puts the nontraditional federal
government at center stage,

01:46:57.830 --> 01:47:01.120
is immobilization,
wartime demobilization,

01:47:01.120 --> 01:47:03.600
which is one of the major
causes of the Red Scare,

01:47:03.600 --> 01:47:08.270
because it creates both a
massive unemployed population,

01:47:08.270 --> 01:47:11.540
soldiers return and don't haven
jobs, and creates a massive --

01:47:11.540 --> 01:47:16.480
there's a inflationary spike.

01:47:16.480 --> 01:47:20.440
And you have -- so you have
massive social and economic unrest,

01:47:20.440 --> 01:47:22.980
and this is the -- this is the
political economic background

01:47:22.980 --> 01:47:24.280
of the Red Scare.

01:47:24.280 --> 01:47:28.980
So that decision to demobilize,
which many progressive thinkers

01:47:28.980 --> 01:47:31.550
and many wartime administrators
did not want.

01:47:31.550 --> 01:47:34.450
There was a fight over the
politics of demobilization.

01:47:34.450 --> 01:47:38.650
Many wanted to continue to extend
the administrative experiments

01:47:38.650 --> 01:47:44.290
of the war era into the peace, and
that would include these elements

01:47:44.290 --> 01:47:47.040
of a civil libertarian or
perhaps potentially civil rights

01:47:47.040 --> 01:47:48.910
bureaucracy maybe.

01:47:48.910 --> 01:47:51.900
The main reason why
that doesn't happen is

01:47:51.900 --> 01:48:00.260
because of Wilson's commitment
and the commitment of the sort

01:48:00.260 --> 01:48:03.820
of large -- most of the
legal and political elite

01:48:03.820 --> 01:48:09.720
to rapid demobilization, as
well as many ordinary Americans.

01:48:09.720 --> 01:48:14.990
What you then see, though, is it
only takes you about nine years

01:48:14.990 --> 01:48:20.160
from the decision, or 10 years,
from the decision to demobilize

01:48:20.160 --> 01:48:23.700
to the beginning of
the Great Depression,

01:48:23.700 --> 01:48:29.250 position:56%
where already under Hoover you start
seeing actually Hoover resurrecting

01:48:29.250 --> 01:48:31.810
at the end of his presidency
a number

01:48:31.810 --> 01:48:34.830
of the administrative experiments
of World War I period and trying

01:48:34.830 --> 01:48:38.180
to put them into play in
order to manage the economic

01:48:38.180 --> 01:48:40.540
and social unrest at the
beginning of the Great Depression.

01:48:40.540 --> 01:48:45.110
And then FDR just puts that into
really high gear with a more,

01:48:45.110 --> 01:48:50.890
I would say, civil libertarian
and labor -- pro labor slant.

01:48:50.890 --> 01:48:52.280
And I would just point to --

01:48:52.280 --> 01:48:56.250
for sort of direct continuities
from the National War Labor Board

01:48:56.250 --> 01:48:59.100
to the NLRB, the National
Labor Relations Board,

01:48:59.100 --> 01:49:04.470
from the kind of maverick
war department experiments

01:49:04.470 --> 01:49:07.580
with conscientious objection
in World War I to the creation

01:49:07.580 --> 01:49:10.550
of the Selective Service System
and the Civilian Publics --

01:49:10.550 --> 01:49:12.730
Civilian Public Service
of World War II,

01:49:12.730 --> 01:49:15.620
which really just amplifies
Frankfurter's vision.

01:49:15.620 --> 01:49:19.370 position:56%
And then finally you have the
creation of the Civil Liberties Unit

01:49:19.370 --> 01:49:21.750
in the Justice Department,
now the Civil Rights Division.

01:49:21.750 --> 01:49:27.530
And '39 making good, I think, on
both some of the anti-lynching --

01:49:27.530 --> 01:49:29.640
some of the administrators who
were sympathetic to anti-lynching

01:49:29.640 --> 01:49:34.280
at the World War I period, and
also a more rights protected vision

01:49:34.280 --> 01:49:38.200
of a -- of what the
DOJ should be about.

01:49:38.200 --> 01:49:39.500
&gt;&gt; Megan Ming Francis:
I think you see --

01:49:39.500 --> 01:49:41.290
I'm going to focus
on three things, too.

01:49:41.290 --> 01:49:42.590
I'll go very quickly.

01:49:42.590 --> 01:49:47.860
One I think, especially for the
NAACP, I think post, I think,

01:49:47.860 --> 01:49:52.330
World War I this [inaudible] kind
of reevaluation of citizenship.

01:49:52.330 --> 01:49:55.570
And there's new ideas that never
leave them because of, I think --

01:49:55.570 --> 01:49:57.870
I think, the war that they
then go and fight for.

01:49:57.870 --> 01:50:03.100
I think that a lot of obviously
what happens in the '50s and '60s,

01:50:03.100 --> 01:50:05.840
a number of these rights
movements, not just the NAACP,

01:50:05.840 --> 01:50:08.790
not just the Urban League, but a
lot of them get like constituted

01:50:08.790 --> 01:50:12.090
in the late '20s and in the '30s.

01:50:12.090 --> 01:50:16.460
Second, I think one of the
things that comes out in part

01:50:16.460 --> 01:50:19.460
because some African Americans
are filling jobs left by those

01:50:19.460 --> 01:50:24.470
who are -- who -- of those who
got drafted, as well as kind

01:50:24.470 --> 01:50:27.670 position:56%
of new understandings is part of the
great migration, but labor becomes,

01:50:27.670 --> 01:50:33.020
I think, it's always been a huge
issue for African Americans,

01:50:33.020 --> 01:50:36.700
but I think postwar
you see more calls,

01:50:36.700 --> 01:50:38.980
especially in civil
rights organizations,

01:50:38.980 --> 01:50:43.020 position:56%
to focus on discriminatory wages and
the issue around peonage farming,

01:50:43.020 --> 01:50:45.290
sharecropping in the south,
and this is obviously --

01:50:45.290 --> 01:50:47.270
I mean, for those who know
a lot about W. E. B. Dubois,

01:50:47.270 --> 01:50:49.180
he very much has like
a transformation

01:50:49.180 --> 01:50:50.840
in what he thinks is
a critical issue

01:50:50.840 --> 01:50:54.000
for African American
advancement, and that is labor.

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:57.080
The big thing for me, and part of
the work that I do that you see

01:50:57.080 --> 01:50:58.550
for me coming out in the --

01:50:58.550 --> 01:51:03.010
in the aftermath of the war is
for the NAACP, and I think it's --

01:51:03.010 --> 01:51:06.340
I think it's transformative,
a re-understanding of --

01:51:06.340 --> 01:51:08.730
like a new understanding,
I should probably say,

01:51:08.730 --> 01:51:10.030
but how to fight for rights.

01:51:10.030 --> 01:51:15.420
And so they move we know from a
huge focus between around 1909

01:51:15.420 --> 01:51:19.470
and about 1925, '27 to a
focus on education, right?

01:51:19.470 --> 01:51:22.690 position:56%
So they get this big grant from an
organization called The Garland Fund

01:51:22.690 --> 01:51:29.530
in 1931, but they're in talks about
this grant between 1927 and 1928.

01:51:29.530 --> 01:51:31.920
And there's this whole new
idea that, oh my goodness,

01:51:31.920 --> 01:51:35.440
the NAACP has this big case 1923.

01:51:35.440 --> 01:51:38.660
The NAACP is an organization
that can fight for civil rights.

01:51:38.660 --> 01:51:40.580
The Garland Fund was an
organization about --

01:51:40.580 --> 01:51:43.890
funded by white radicals that
really believed the way forward was

01:51:43.890 --> 01:51:46.740
through, at some level,
labor and education.

01:51:46.740 --> 01:51:48.290
And so they really
believed and wanted

01:51:48.290 --> 01:51:51.160
to fund this big campaign
around education.

01:51:51.160 --> 01:51:53.210
The NAACP's leaders,
Johnson and White,

01:51:53.210 --> 01:51:55.490
were both very actually
resistant about that idea.

01:51:55.490 --> 01:51:57.090
They were like, no,
we actually still need

01:51:57.090 --> 01:51:58.390
to focus on racial violence.

01:51:58.390 --> 01:51:59.830
It's still a critical issue.

01:51:59.830 --> 01:52:02.430
Education is not going to be kind
of the issue that rights are going

01:52:02.430 --> 01:52:05.840 position:56%
to actually turn on, because African
Americans can still get killed.

01:52:05.840 --> 01:52:07.140
They didn't really care.

01:52:07.140 --> 01:52:08.440
And I'm nothing saying

01:52:08.440 --> 01:52:09.950
that education is not a
radical issue, I do think it is.

01:52:09.950 --> 01:52:11.960
But I do think in terms
of some of these moments,

01:52:11.960 --> 01:52:14.720
especially if you look at
the trajectory of the NAACP,

01:52:14.720 --> 01:52:18.460
they kind of post theories,
not obviously exclusively,

01:52:18.460 --> 01:52:21.440
but they become very much focused
on this issue of education.

01:52:21.440 --> 01:52:25.370
And you see this very, I think,
like sharp turn actually happening

01:52:25.370 --> 01:52:30.160
in 1931, 1930, between
1931 and 1933.

01:52:30.160 --> 01:52:31.480
And so for me, in terms
of the NAACP,

01:52:31.480 --> 01:52:33.600
that is a big shift
that happens postwar.

01:52:33.600 --> 01:52:36.650 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jeremy Kessler: So I can be brief
because my expertise largely runs

01:52:36.650 --> 01:52:39.240
out [laughter] after World War I.

01:52:39.240 --> 01:52:41.960
But my impression is,
I think it's consistent

01:52:41.960 --> 01:52:43.970
with what you two have been saying.

01:52:43.970 --> 01:52:48.330
It really took into the
'30s for civil liberties

01:52:48.330 --> 01:52:50.670
to become the real focus

01:52:50.670 --> 01:52:54.880
of widespread popular attention
and judicial attention.

01:52:54.880 --> 01:53:00.540
So the war changed many people's
views, but it took another decade

01:53:00.540 --> 01:53:02.820
to focus on civil liberties.

01:53:02.820 --> 01:53:07.240
So there wasn't that
immediate impact, my sense is.

01:53:07.240 --> 01:53:11.420
&gt;&gt; Geoffrey Stone: I'll take a
somewhat different tact on this,

01:53:11.420 --> 01:53:12.720
which comes out of the fact

01:53:12.720 --> 01:53:16.850
that I just published a book
called Sex and the Constitution.

01:53:16.850 --> 01:53:20.610
And it said the generation
that went through World War I,

01:53:20.610 --> 01:53:26.020
that is the soldier age generation,
came out of that war with a sense

01:53:26.020 --> 01:53:30.860
that the world was not, as
they had been born into it,

01:53:30.860 --> 01:53:33.170
was not such a great place.

01:53:33.170 --> 01:53:38.470
And that led to the '20s and to
this era of much greater degree

01:53:38.470 --> 01:53:40.940
of freedom in their
individual lives.

01:53:40.940 --> 01:53:46.360
And so one began to see a much
greater movement towards the

01:53:46.360 --> 01:53:47.790
legalization of contraception,

01:53:47.790 --> 01:53:52.520 position:56%
a much greater movement towards
limiting the laws against obscenity,

01:53:52.520 --> 01:53:57.410
a openly gay culture in New
York, Chicago, Los Angeles,

01:53:57.410 --> 01:54:01.940
and other cities, which
began to sort of burgeon,

01:54:01.940 --> 01:54:06.480
and that part of the society
really came into the light.

01:54:06.480 --> 01:54:09.820
Unfortunately, with the
depression it was stamped largely

01:54:09.820 --> 01:54:11.120
out of existence.

01:54:11.120 --> 01:54:12.920
And indeed, particularly the
gay part of that culture,

01:54:12.920 --> 01:54:16.810
largely disappeared even from
historians until the last 15

01:54:16.810 --> 01:54:19.810
or 20 years when historians
went back and unearthed it.

01:54:19.810 --> 01:54:21.950
But clearly one of the consequences

01:54:21.950 --> 01:54:26.730
of the war was this very different
attitude towards day-to-day life,

01:54:26.730 --> 01:54:30.360
particularly in these areas
to sexual freedom and openness

01:54:30.360 --> 01:54:33.540 position:56%
and living your life in a happy way.

01:54:33.540 --> 01:54:35.080
&gt;&gt; David Rabban: Could I
just jump very quickly,

01:54:35.080 --> 01:54:36.940
Mary, on Geoff's last point?

01:54:36.940 --> 01:54:40.330
I mean, when we focus on
institutions, and I think Geoff has

01:54:40.330 --> 01:54:44.330
like nicely reminded us the risks
of that just now, the '20s can look

01:54:44.330 --> 01:54:48.110
like a period of senescence
from a variety of angles.

01:54:48.110 --> 01:54:51.310
But in point of fact, nothing
that happens, even if you accept

01:54:51.310 --> 01:54:53.460
that at the institutional
level, nothing --

01:54:53.460 --> 01:54:55.500
almost everything that's
being done during the new deal

01:54:55.500 --> 01:54:59.470
at the institutional level
is being done by folks

01:54:59.470 --> 01:55:04.400
who themselves are veterans
of the World War I moment,

01:55:04.400 --> 01:55:08.370
whether that be soldiers
or often, more importantly

01:55:08.370 --> 01:55:14.270
for these new legal institutions,
administrators, low level bureau --

01:55:14.270 --> 01:55:18.470 position:56%
folks who are low level bureaucrats
during World War I, or were involved

01:55:18.470 --> 01:55:21.420
at the rank and file
level of unions,

01:55:21.420 --> 01:55:25.290 position:56%
they're around during the '20s,
they're organizing, they're writing,

01:55:25.290 --> 01:55:27.300
they're associating, they're
creating new organizations

01:55:27.300 --> 01:55:31.750
like the ACLU, and they're
ready to go in the '30s.

01:55:31.750 --> 01:55:33.050
&gt;&gt; Mary Dudziak: So interesting.

01:55:33.050 --> 01:55:35.350
So let's -- yes?

01:55:38.510 --> 01:57:11.500
[ Inaudible ]

01:57:14.450 --> 01:57:15.750
&gt;&gt; Jeremy Kessler:
So, David, go ahead.

01:57:15.750 --> 01:57:17.270
You probably have a
more structural --

01:57:17.270 --> 01:57:19.900
I have two incidents to
mention involving Germans

01:57:19.900 --> 01:57:21.200
that I think are interesting.

01:57:21.200 --> 01:57:22.500
But, go ahead.

01:57:22.500 --> 01:57:23.800
&gt;&gt; David Rabban: So what I -- what
I was just going to -- on the --

01:57:23.800 --> 01:57:26.610
one of the things, I really think
the striking things as you pointed

01:57:26.610 --> 01:57:31.970 position:56%
to is the different vis-a-vis German
Americans, there's a difference

01:57:31.970 --> 01:57:37.310 position:56%
in their treatment between World War
I and World War II, and a great deal

01:57:37.310 --> 01:57:41.150
of that, and it's something
that the lawyers

01:57:41.150 --> 01:57:43.920
and the administrators
are hugely conscious of,

01:57:43.920 --> 01:57:50.620
is the different degree
of latitude local mobs

01:57:50.620 --> 01:57:54.990
and local collectives were given
in World War I versus World War II.

01:57:54.990 --> 01:57:57.500
The kind of all -- like
the postmortems provided

01:57:57.500 --> 01:58:00.890
by John Lord O'Brian and
a host of progressive --

01:58:00.890 --> 01:58:04.200
young, middle-aged progressive
lawyers immediately afterward World

01:58:04.200 --> 01:58:07.010
War I, and then during
the Red Scare, is --

01:58:07.010 --> 01:58:09.430
and even that's their analysis
of the Red Scare itself,

01:58:09.430 --> 01:58:11.730
even though it's being led
by an Attorney General,

01:58:11.730 --> 01:58:15.020
is that what this really
is, this sort of oppression

01:58:15.020 --> 01:58:19.990
of German Americans and then other
foreign [inaudible] Americans is a

01:58:19.990 --> 01:58:22.730
problem of mob rule and the answer

01:58:22.730 --> 01:58:27.000
to it is further centralization
of state power.

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:28.750
And there's this amazing moment

01:58:28.750 --> 01:58:35.890 position:56%
when Robert Jackson becomes Attorney
General, and they see the war coming

01:58:35.890 --> 01:58:40.800
and it's 1940, in the spring
-- early spring of 1940.

01:58:40.800 --> 01:58:45.400
And Robert Jackson all of a
sudden, Felix Frankfurter,

01:58:45.400 --> 01:58:48.370
Harlan Fiske Stone sitting
on the Supreme Court,

01:58:48.370 --> 01:58:53.620
and a number of other World War
I officials all send Jackson all

01:58:53.620 --> 01:58:57.590
of the materials they produced
during World War I and immediately

01:58:57.590 --> 01:59:02.920
in its aftermath talking about
precisely this problem of the need

01:59:02.920 --> 01:59:08.760
to crackdown, not on
disloyal Americans or traders,

01:59:08.760 --> 01:59:12.940
but rather to crackdown on
patriotic organizations.

01:59:12.940 --> 01:59:17.770
And actually Jackson and Hoover, J.
Edgar Hoover are utterly committed

01:59:17.770 --> 01:59:22.360
to the repression of
loyalty leagues and other --

01:59:22.360 --> 01:59:25.250
the American Legion and
other patriotic groups,

01:59:25.250 --> 01:59:27.320
because they identify
that as at least one

01:59:27.320 --> 01:59:30.940
of the main drivers
of anti-Germanism.

01:59:30.940 --> 01:59:33.920
&gt;&gt; Jeremy Kessler: So I wanted to
make two points through examples.

01:59:33.920 --> 01:59:38.400
One is, although socialist
opposition to World War I was kind

01:59:38.400 --> 01:59:42.790
of the major category of defendants
who were prosecuted and convicted

01:59:42.790 --> 01:59:46.540
under the Espionage Act, there were
quite a few cases involving German

01:59:46.540 --> 01:59:50.570
Americans who kind of praised
the Kaisers, we have no fight

01:59:50.570 --> 01:59:54.710 position:56%
with the Kaiser, and that was enough
to be considered to have a tendency

01:59:54.710 --> 01:59:58.100
to cause insubordination
and to obstruct recruitment.

01:59:58.100 --> 02:00:00.050
So there's that example.

02:00:00.050 --> 02:00:02.520
Also, I'm interested in the history

02:00:02.520 --> 02:00:04.190
of academic freedom
as a separate right.

02:00:04.190 --> 02:00:05.960
And when the classic defenses

02:00:05.960 --> 02:00:10.520
of academic freedom
came during World War I,

02:00:10.520 --> 02:00:11.900
there was a German professor

02:00:11.900 --> 02:00:14.880
at Harvard I think named
Musterberg [assumed spelling],

02:00:14.880 --> 02:00:19.110
something like that, who said
we shouldn't get into a war

02:00:19.110 --> 02:00:22.390
with Germany and praise
German civilization.

02:00:22.390 --> 02:00:29.850
And a major donor to Harvard
threatened to withdraw his pledge

02:00:29.850 --> 02:00:32.970
of $20 million, when that
was real money, you know.

02:00:32.970 --> 02:00:40.650
And the president of Harvard
said, we are not going

02:00:40.650 --> 02:00:45.980
to monitor the speech
of our professors.

02:00:45.980 --> 02:00:50.150 position:56%
Our job is to worry about academics.

02:00:50.150 --> 02:00:55.750
His views about politics, it's
up to the state to monitor.

02:00:55.750 --> 02:01:01.660
So this was kind of a major
defense of political rights anyway,

02:01:01.660 --> 02:01:04.830
and limits of the role
of universities

02:01:04.830 --> 02:01:07.010
in monitoring political speech,

02:01:07.010 --> 02:01:09.180
having to do with a
German American professor.

02:01:09.180 --> 02:01:11.800
&gt;&gt; Geoffrey Stone: And one
other point about this which is,

02:01:11.800 --> 02:01:15.540
it's important not to forget
about the Japanese and German.

02:01:15.540 --> 02:01:18.820
The fact is that, you
know, a, when you think

02:01:18.820 --> 02:01:20.760
about the current situation

02:01:20.760 --> 02:01:24.880
to remember what we're
capable of as a nation.

02:01:24.880 --> 02:01:27.490
And second, the distinction
between how the government chose

02:01:27.490 --> 02:01:30.560
to treat Japanese Americans
and German Americans, right?

02:01:30.560 --> 02:01:33.140
German Americans, well, we can tell
the good ones from the bad ones.

02:01:33.140 --> 02:01:37.020
That was literally the policy, the
Roosevelt administration, right?

02:01:37.020 --> 02:01:40.520 position:56%
And it's also worth remembering that
J. Edgar Hoover opposed the Japanese

02:01:40.520 --> 02:01:42.710
and German, in terms
of giving credit

02:01:42.710 --> 02:01:45.100
where credit is rarely
due [laughter].

02:01:45.100 --> 02:01:46.400 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jeremy Kessler: The early Hoover.

02:01:46.400 --> 02:01:47.790
&gt;&gt; Geoffrey Stone: The
early Hoover, yes, right.

02:01:47.790 --> 02:01:49.090
The [inaudible] Hoover.

02:01:49.090 --> 02:01:50.860
And Felix Frankfurter voted

02:01:50.860 --> 02:01:52.910
to uphold the Japanese
and German by the way.

02:01:52.910 --> 02:01:54.210
So --

02:01:54.210 --> 02:01:55.510
[ Inaudible ]

02:01:55.510 --> 02:01:56.810

that's right, correct.

too late to go to law school.

do that, no [laughter].

02:04:26.010 --> 02:04:56.500
[ Inaudible ]

02:04:56.500 --> 02:04:58.900
&gt;&gt; Geoffrey Stone: You know, I
think it's a semantic question

02:04:58.900 --> 02:05:00.980
that doesn't carry a lot of weight.

02:05:00.980 --> 02:05:03.870
If I were going to simplistically
answer it I would talk

02:05:03.870 --> 02:05:06.450
about civil liberties being freedom
of speech, freedom of religion,

02:05:06.450 --> 02:05:08.410
and civil rights being
more about equality issues.

02:05:08.410 --> 02:05:10.120
But there's a lot of
stuff besides that.

02:05:10.120 --> 02:05:12.740
I'm not sure which
box I'd put them in.

02:05:12.740 --> 02:05:14.040
&gt;&gt; Mary Dudziak: Yeah.

02:05:14.040 --> 02:05:15.340
&gt;&gt; Jeremy Kessler: Me, too.

02:05:15.340 --> 02:05:16.640
[ Inaudible ]

02:05:16.640 --> 02:05:17.970
&gt;&gt; Mary Dudziak: Okay, can I just
say on the gender point, of course,

02:05:17.970 --> 02:05:21.610
this was -- the World War I
years were when Jeannette Rankin,

02:05:21.610 --> 02:05:24.930 position:56%
the first female member of
Congress, before women had the vote,

02:05:24.930 --> 02:05:29.590
her first -- Wilson called
Congress into session early

02:05:29.590 --> 02:05:34.900
so that her first day in Congress
was his World War I declaration

02:05:34.900 --> 02:05:39.190
speech and her first vote, that's
right, was against the war.

02:05:39.190 --> 02:05:41.360
[ Inaudible ]

02:05:41.360 --> 02:05:44.620
Yeah, she the only -- and
the only term she served

02:05:44.620 --> 02:05:48.840
in Congress were the term when
Congress voted on World War I

02:05:48.840 --> 02:05:51.280
and the -- and the term that
Congress voted on World War II.

02:05:51.280 --> 02:05:52.580
&gt;&gt; Geoffrey Stone: So
it was all her fault?

02:05:52.580 --> 02:05:54.700
&gt;&gt; Mary Dudziak: But really,
but this shows us something

02:05:54.700 --> 02:05:58.280
about politics, which is, you
know, there was -- that she --

02:05:58.280 --> 02:06:02.500
many people argued for war
referendum after World War II.

02:06:02.500 --> 02:06:04.560
Let's not go into a foreign war

02:06:04.560 --> 02:06:08.830
like this unless there's a
public referendum over it.

02:06:08.830 --> 02:06:13.260
And on some level Americans
do have war referenda, right?

02:06:13.260 --> 02:06:15.310
When she ran for Congress again,

02:06:15.310 --> 02:06:22.390
members of her constituency
could vote against war in 1940

02:06:22.390 --> 02:06:24.580
by voting for Jeannette Rankin.

02:06:24.580 --> 02:06:27.180
So, you know, so that's
how voting --

02:06:27.180 --> 02:06:29.380 position:56%
the public voting about war happens.

02:06:29.380 --> 02:06:32.240
It happens through voting
for candidates like,

02:06:32.240 --> 02:06:34.200
you know, Wilson in 1917.

02:06:34.200 --> 02:06:38.770
&gt;&gt; Jeremy Kessler: Just in terms
of free speech, the major defenders

02:06:38.770 --> 02:06:44.700
of free speech before World
War I were defenders of people

02:06:44.700 --> 02:06:47.560
who were called sex radicals.

02:06:47.560 --> 02:06:54.280
And I was fascinated to learn that
the first prosecution [inaudible]

02:06:54.280 --> 02:06:58.590 position:56%
for obscenity involved not something

02:06:58.590 --> 02:07:03.640
that we would consider obscene
today, but radical speech

02:07:03.640 --> 02:07:07.100
about sexual relations
between men and women,

02:07:07.100 --> 02:07:10.120
and particularly it was a
radical attack on language.

02:07:10.120 --> 02:07:11.910
So you probably just
see a recent book,

02:07:11.910 --> 02:07:15.860
there was this pamphlet
called Cupid's Yokes.

02:07:15.860 --> 02:07:18.240
It took me forever to find it.

02:07:18.240 --> 02:07:19.540
&gt;&gt; Geoffrey Stone: I got it online.

02:07:19.540 --> 02:07:20.840
It was like that.

02:07:20.840 --> 02:07:22.140
&gt;&gt; Jeremy Kessler: See,

02:07:22.140 --> 02:07:23.440
that's what's changing
in the last 20 years.

02:07:23.440 --> 02:07:24.740
You know, I found it in the
New York Public Library.

02:07:24.740 --> 02:07:26.170
So like, what did people
think, you know,

02:07:26.170 --> 02:07:32.980 position:56%
would be obscene, salacious in 1873?

02:07:32.980 --> 02:07:34.900
I find this pamphlet.

02:07:34.900 --> 02:07:37.830
Okay, people are different
in different times.

02:07:37.830 --> 02:07:40.460
But it was inconceivable
to me that anyone

02:07:40.460 --> 02:07:44.270
in 1873 could have considered
Cupid's Yokes salacious

02:07:44.270 --> 02:07:45.570
or titillating.

02:07:45.570 --> 02:07:50.380
Basically, Cupid's Yokes -- it
was an argument against religious

02:07:50.380 --> 02:07:52.760
and state regulation of marriage.

02:07:52.760 --> 02:07:56.350
Rather, people should
be confined only

02:07:56.350 --> 02:07:59.640 position:56%
by Cupid's Yokes, the yokes of love.

02:07:59.640 --> 02:08:07.730 position:56%
And what prompted the prosecution
of Cupid's Yokes were not, you know,

02:08:07.730 --> 02:08:10.790
sexually explicit passages,
but statements

02:08:10.790 --> 02:08:16.450
such as marriage is a form of
slavery, a prostitute is bought

02:08:16.450 --> 02:08:19.940
for a night, a wife becomes
a prostitute for life.

02:08:19.940 --> 02:08:23.300
So I just thought that was
relevant to your question.

02:08:23.300 --> 02:08:24.600
&gt;&gt; Mary Dudziak: Just
two little points

02:08:24.600 --> 02:08:25.900
and then I want to take questions.

02:08:25.900 --> 02:08:29.210
But, you know, of course the
women got the vote, you know,

02:08:29.210 --> 02:08:31.520
in part out of World War
I when Wilson finally came

02:08:31.520 --> 02:08:33.040
to support the suffrage movement,

02:08:33.040 --> 02:08:38.390
after the women's suffrage
moment had basically promised

02:08:38.390 --> 02:08:40.320
to support war.

02:08:40.320 --> 02:08:44.220 position:56%
So they had a sort of a partnership.

02:08:44.220 --> 02:08:48.070
But, so the other thing
is, in terms of books,

02:08:48.070 --> 02:08:50.530
you and D.C. have someone local,
Michael Kazen [assumed spelling],

02:08:50.530 --> 02:08:54.740
who has a new book about
pacifists during this era,

02:08:54.740 --> 02:08:58.370
and I highly recommend, you know,
keeping an eye out for book talks.

02:08:58.370 --> 02:08:59.750
I know there had been a
couple more questions.

02:08:59.750 --> 02:09:01.990
If I can take questions now.

02:09:01.990 --> 02:09:03.290
&gt;&gt; One?

02:09:03.290 --> 02:09:04.590
&gt;&gt; Mary Dudziak: Just --
I was going to say, ask --

02:09:04.590 --> 02:09:07.730
get a couple of people to
ask questions now together,

02:09:07.730 --> 02:09:10.100
and then we can do sort
of lightning answer.

02:09:10.100 --> 02:09:11.900
Yes?

02:09:11.900 --> 02:09:17.500
[ Inaudible ]

02:09:18.360 --> 02:09:20.020
And is there another question?

02:09:20.020 --> 02:09:22.320
No? Okay. Yes?

02:09:24.010 --> 02:09:25.310
[ Inaudible ]

02:09:25.310 --> 02:09:27.540
But make it quick.

02:09:27.540 --> 02:09:29.840
Sorry.

02:09:31.510 --> 02:10:01.500
[ Inaudible ]

02:10:04.370 --> 02:10:06.960
Geoffrey Stone: The Sedition
Act was repealed in 1921.

02:10:06.960 --> 02:10:09.330
The Espionage Act is
still on the book.

02:10:09.330 --> 02:10:11.900 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jeremy Kessler: Right, and I know
the answer to your second question.

02:10:11.900 --> 02:10:13.200
I can be quick.

02:10:13.200 --> 02:10:15.630
&gt;&gt; Megan Ming Francis: I think
it just -- it changes over time.

02:10:15.630 --> 02:10:19.960
And groups tend to be -- try to
be strategic about where they go.

02:10:19.960 --> 02:10:23.570 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David Rabban: So on that
question I would say that, you know,

02:10:23.570 --> 02:10:26.540
there is a kind of [inaudible]
in our history in the sense

02:10:26.540 --> 02:10:30.870
that Madison, going back to
federal 10, makes the argument

02:10:30.870 --> 02:10:34.360
that larger republics,
because they will like --

02:10:34.360 --> 02:10:38.210
because they will give [inaudible]
too many different interests,

02:10:38.210 --> 02:10:41.300
will tend to be less to
tyrannical than smaller republics.

02:10:41.300 --> 02:10:44.010
But I actually agree that it
probably just changes over time.

02:10:44.010 --> 02:10:45.310
[ Inaudible ]

02:10:45.310 --> 02:10:47.440
I do want to take the
opportunity, though,

02:10:47.440 --> 02:10:50.520
because I thought the
immigration point

02:10:50.520 --> 02:10:53.190
that you raised is really
well taken, both this idea

02:10:53.190 --> 02:10:55.900
that the massive demographic
shifts of the late 19th

02:10:55.900 --> 02:11:00.420
and early 20th century I do think
are a profound material basis

02:11:00.420 --> 02:11:02.840
of both the First Amendment --

02:11:02.840 --> 02:11:05.210
First Amendment struggles
and the labor struggles

02:11:05.210 --> 02:11:08.310
of the period we've
been talking about.

02:11:08.310 --> 02:11:12.470
And it also is [inaudible]
not too much excitement

02:11:12.470 --> 02:11:15.130
about the green shoots
of civil libertarianism

02:11:15.130 --> 02:11:17.930
that we've been recounting
to some extent, right,

02:11:17.930 --> 02:11:20.960
because what do you have '23, '24?

02:11:20.960 --> 02:11:24.300
A massive system of
immigration restriction.

02:11:24.300 --> 02:11:27.390
And then what do you have
along with Japanese internment,

02:11:27.390 --> 02:11:31.900
but Geoff rightly emphasized,
you have the Smith Act in 1940

02:11:31.900 --> 02:11:37.440
and you have a new massive wave of
deportations and denaturalization,

02:11:37.440 --> 02:11:41.180 position:56%
every bit as destructive personally,

02:11:41.180 --> 02:11:44.100
and I think probably more
destructive at a policy level,

02:11:44.100 --> 02:11:50.590
of foreign born Americans during
World War II and the 1950's.

02:11:52.010 --> 02:11:53.360
&gt;&gt; Ryan Reft: So that wraps up.

02:11:53.360 --> 02:11:54.660
And I'd like to thank our panel.

02:11:54.660 --> 02:11:57.810
I thought that was a great
discussion [applause].

02:11:57.810 --> 02:12:00.380
And I'd also just be remiss
not to mention, you know,

02:12:00.380 --> 02:12:04.510 position:56%
the next three days in the Jefferson
Building we are having a LGBTQ

02:12:04.510 --> 02:12:06.840
pop-up exhibit to celebrate
gay pride month

02:12:06.840 --> 02:12:09.100
and the parade that's
coming on Saturday.

02:12:09.100 --> 02:12:10.400
So please do check that out.

02:12:10.400 --> 02:12:12.750
And if you get a chance, check
out the Drawing Justice exhibit

02:12:12.750 --> 02:12:14.910
and the Echoes of the
Great War exhibit also

02:12:14.910 --> 02:12:16.820
in the Jefferson Building.

02:12:16.820 --> 02:12:19.070
And you're all invited
to drinks and [inaudible]

02:12:19.070 --> 02:12:22.910
in the next room afterwards.

02:12:22.910 --> 02:12:25.320
See, I'm not -- I probably
said that wrong.

02:12:25.320 --> 02:12:29.840
But, thank you very much
for coming [applause].

02:12:31.280 --> 02:12:34.940

of the Library of Congress.
