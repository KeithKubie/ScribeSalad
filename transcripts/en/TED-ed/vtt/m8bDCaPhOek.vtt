00:00:06.921 --> 00:00:10.123
Imagine setting sail 
from Hawaii in a canoe.

00:00:10.123 --> 00:00:13.960
Your target is a small island thousands
of kilometers away

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.512
in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.

00:00:16.512 --> 00:00:21.252
That's a body of water that covers
more than 160 million square kilometers,

00:00:21.252 --> 00:00:26.352
greater than all the landmasses 
on Earth combined.

00:00:26.352 --> 00:00:27.541
For thousands of years,

00:00:27.541 --> 00:00:30.932
Polynesian navigators managed voyages 
like this

00:00:30.932 --> 00:00:34.342
without the help 
of modern navigational aids.

00:00:34.342 --> 00:00:36.241
Ancient Polynesians used the Sun,

00:00:36.241 --> 00:00:37.052
Moon,

00:00:37.052 --> 00:00:37.871
stars,

00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:38.651
planets,

00:00:38.651 --> 00:00:39.633
ocean currents,

00:00:39.633 --> 00:00:45.993
and clouds as guides that allowed them
to see the ocean as a series of pathways

00:00:45.993 --> 00:00:48.982
rather than an obstacle.

00:00:48.982 --> 00:00:52.073
Their voyages began around 1500 B.C.

00:00:52.073 --> 00:00:57.574
when the people who would settle Polynesia
first set sail from Southeast Asia.

00:00:57.574 --> 00:01:01.487
Early Polynesians eventually settled
a vast area of islands

00:01:01.487 --> 00:01:06.743
spread over 40 million square kilometers
of the Pacific Ocean.

00:01:06.743 --> 00:01:10.109
Some historians believe the voyagers moved
from place to place

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:11.874
to avoid overpopulation.

00:01:11.874 --> 00:01:14.015
Others, that they were driven by war.

00:01:14.015 --> 00:01:18.286
Voyages became less frequent
by around 1300 A.D.

00:01:18.286 --> 00:01:24.335
as Polynesian societies became more rooted
in specific locations.

00:01:24.335 --> 00:01:25.975
During the voyaging period,

00:01:25.975 --> 00:01:29.265
successful journeys depended on 
a number of factors:

00:01:29.265 --> 00:01:30.655
well-built canoes,

00:01:30.655 --> 00:01:32.294
the skill of navigators,

00:01:32.294 --> 00:01:35.425
and weather being some of the biggest.

00:01:35.425 --> 00:01:39.876
Voyages relied on sturdy wa'a kaulua,
or double-hulled canoes,

00:01:39.876 --> 00:01:44.635
which were powered by sails
and steered with a single large oar.

00:01:44.635 --> 00:01:47.016
Canoe building involved
the whole community,

00:01:47.016 --> 00:01:48.665
bringing together the navigators,

00:01:48.665 --> 00:01:49.745
canoe builders,

00:01:49.745 --> 00:01:50.656
priests,

00:01:50.656 --> 00:01:51.522
chanters,

00:01:51.522 --> 00:01:53.846
and hula dancers.

00:01:53.846 --> 00:01:57.096
Navigators were keen observers 
of the natural world.

00:01:57.096 --> 00:02:01.536
They were abundantly familiar with 
trade wind-generated ocean swells,

00:02:01.536 --> 00:02:05.058
which typically flow 
northeast or southeast.

00:02:05.058 --> 00:02:07.528
By day, navigators could 
identify direction

00:02:07.528 --> 00:02:11.606
by the rocking motion of their canoes
caused by these swells.

00:02:11.606 --> 00:02:15.217
But sunrise and sunset 
were even more useful.

00:02:15.217 --> 00:02:18.588
The Sun's position indicated east and west

00:02:18.588 --> 00:02:24.888
and created low light on the ocean that
made it possible to see swells directly.

00:02:24.888 --> 00:02:28.618
At night, navigators used something 
called a star compass,

00:02:28.618 --> 00:02:33.497
which wasn't a physical object,
but rather a sort of mental map.

00:02:33.497 --> 00:02:37.917
They memorized the rising and setting
points of stars and constellations

00:02:37.917 --> 00:02:40.317
at different times of the year.

00:02:40.317 --> 00:02:43.528
They used those to divide the sky
into four quadrants,

00:02:43.528 --> 00:02:46.879
subdivided into 32 houses,

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:48.908
with the canoe in the middle.

00:02:48.908 --> 00:02:53.479
So, for example, when they saw the star
Piraâ€˜atea rising from the ocean,

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:55.480
they knew that to be northeast.

00:02:55.484 --> 00:02:57.997
They had some other tricks, too.

00:02:57.997 --> 00:03:02.657
The Earth's axis points towards Hokupa'a,
or the North Star,

00:03:02.657 --> 00:03:07.085
so called because it's the one fixed
point in the sky as the Earth rotates

00:03:07.085 --> 00:03:09.395
and always indicates north.

00:03:09.395 --> 00:03:12.165
However, it's not visible 
south of the Equator,

00:03:12.165 --> 00:03:15.715
so navigators there could use
a constellation called Newe,

00:03:15.715 --> 00:03:17.424
or the Southern Cross,

00:03:17.424 --> 00:03:21.096
and some mental tricks to estimate
where south is.

00:03:21.096 --> 00:03:24.635
For instance, draw a line through
these two stars,

00:03:24.635 --> 00:03:26.695
extend it 4.5 times,

00:03:26.695 --> 00:03:29.574
and draw another line 
from there to the horizon.

00:03:29.574 --> 00:03:31.097
That's south.

00:03:31.097 --> 00:03:36.806
But the sky also contains 
navigational aids much closer to Earth,

00:03:36.806 --> 00:03:38.478
the clouds.

00:03:38.478 --> 00:03:40.397
Besides being useful weather cues,

00:03:40.397 --> 00:03:43.917
under the right conditions, 
they can indicate landmasses.

00:03:43.917 --> 00:03:47.116
For instance, the lagoons 
of Pacific atolls

00:03:47.116 --> 00:03:51.488
can actually be seen reflected
on the underside of clouds,

00:03:51.488 --> 00:03:53.498
if you know what to look for.

00:03:53.498 --> 00:03:58.627
And high masses of clouds can indicate
mountainous islands.

00:03:58.627 --> 00:04:01.377
Once navigators neared their destination,
other clues,

00:04:01.377 --> 00:04:04.088
such as the flight patterns of birds,

00:04:04.088 --> 00:04:06.007
floating debris or vegetation,

00:04:06.007 --> 00:04:11.468
and types of fish in the area helped
determine the proximity of land.

00:04:11.468 --> 00:04:16.938
For example, the Manu-O-Ku had a known
flight range of 190 kilometers,

00:04:16.938 --> 00:04:19.838
and could be followed back to shore.

00:04:19.838 --> 00:04:22.287
So how do we know all of this?

00:04:22.287 --> 00:04:24.570
Partially through evidence in petroglyphs,

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.198
written observations 
of European explorers,

00:04:27.198 --> 00:04:30.099
and Polynesian oral traditions.

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:33.588
But also by trying them out for ourselves.

00:04:33.588 --> 00:04:37.079
In 2017, a voyaging canoe called Hokulea

00:04:37.079 --> 00:04:42.319
completed a worldwide voyage 
using only these techniques.

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:46.079
If that seems remarkable,
remember the ancient Polynesians,

00:04:46.079 --> 00:04:48.979
who through close study 
and kinship with nature,

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:51.360
were able to forge these paths across

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.250
an unfathomably vast, 
vibrant living ocean.
