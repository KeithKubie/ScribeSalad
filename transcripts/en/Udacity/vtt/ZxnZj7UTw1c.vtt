This is Cameron.

00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:03.660
You probably recognize him from
some other courses around Udacity.

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.420
&gt;&gt; Hey everybody, it's good to see you.

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.400
&gt;&gt; So Cameron, we've been working
through stuff with frameworks.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.260
&gt;&gt; Yes, frameworks are awesome.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.010
No, I love frameworks,
they're so much fun.

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:14.330
You get to build your app and

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.610
just think about the logic of your app,
without worrying about all the nuances

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:22.230
that go into making your app
work at the lower levels.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.490
&gt;&gt; That's right, and frameworks, the
developers have already created a bunch

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.960
of different components that you
can just stick together, and so

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.610
you don't actually have to worry
about any of that complexity at all.

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.380
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's fantastic,
like for instance, templating.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.967
Usually there's some kind of HTML that
you want to display over and over, or

00:00:36.967 --> 00:00:39.278
display differently in
different situations.

00:00:39.278 --> 00:00:42.083
And so with templating,
you can just define that once,

00:00:42.083 --> 00:00:45.545
say what kind of information you
want to go inside that template, and

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:49.725
then when that data changes on your app,
the template automatically changes, and

00:00:49.725 --> 00:00:50.580
it looks great.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:51.830
It's easy,
you don't have to think about it.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.830
So at the end of the day, your workflow
is so much faster and more efficient.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.667
&gt;&gt; That's right, and another thing
is that they also handle events,

00:00:58.667 --> 00:01:01.256
so you don't actually have to
worry about atEvent listener or

00:01:01.256 --> 00:01:02.428
managing state at the dom.

00:01:02.428 --> 00:01:05.028
[CROSSTALK]
&gt;&gt; That's awesome, it's great, yeah.

00:01:05.028 --> 00:01:07.989
There's so much you don't have to
worry about, because you have the best

00:01:07.989 --> 00:01:10.540
developers in the world, usually,
working on these things.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.410
Maybe that's a bit of an exaggeration,
but they're really good, and they know

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.740
what they're doing, and so you're not
really building this app by yourself.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.460
You're building on top
of their expertise,

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.840
which means that your app is
going to be more performant, and

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.600
there's a lot that you just don't
have to do, which is great.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.530
&gt;&gt; That is great, yeah,
less work is better.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.038
&gt;&gt; Definitely, the best code, or the
code that has the least chance of being

00:01:30.038 --> 00:01:32.028
a bug, is the code that you don't write.

00:01:32.028 --> 00:01:34.850
There's probably a better way of
saying that, but you get the idea.

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.070
&gt;&gt; Exactly, yeah.

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.080
Okay, so we're looking at angular and
ember and

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.310
some other frameworks in this course.

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.050
But each framework is different, and

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.090
each one provides its own set
of benefits and detractions.

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.710
So there are lots of different things
you need to keep in mind as you're

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:48.535
looking for a framework.

00:01:48.535 --> 00:01:49.130
&gt;&gt; Yeah,

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.720
everyone is slightly different, they all
have their own different philosophy.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.171
They all have their way of doing things,
and

00:01:55.171 --> 00:01:57.430
they all also have different features.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.010
Usually, sets of features
are fairly similar, but

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.550
there can be some differences, so
it's definitely worth experimenting with

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.170
different frameworks to see
which one you like more.

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.229
And then when it comes time
to build your project,

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.150
it's worth thinking about
what's going to go into it, so

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.910
you can make the best decision about
which framework best fits your needs.

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.070
Sometimes there's not necessarily a best
framework, it's just what you're most

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.830
comfortable with and what you think
you can move the fastest with.

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:24.330
&gt;&gt; Right.
