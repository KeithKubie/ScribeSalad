00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:02.630
This is the fourth of
the five problems that

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:04.020
Kortaggio sent me today.

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.430
And I've been doing these
problems because I think

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.190
they're really neat
applications of essentially

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:12.520
fairly basic, even you could
call it physics, rate problems,

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:13.750
and a little bit of algebra.

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.280
But you're able to figure out
pretty neat things, where

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.850
you're not sure if there's
enough information at first.

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:21.710
So, here we have train A,
represented by these two dots

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.000
and arrow, is 200 meters long.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.810
And I did this because I think
we want to be specific about

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.480
the configurations we're
talking to later

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:29.230
in the problems.

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:30.390
Let's just read it.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.440
Train A is 200 meters long.

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.410
Train B is 400 meters long.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.620
They run on parallel tracks
at constant speeds.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.250
When moving in the same
direction, A passes

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.770
B in 15 seconds.

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.460
From, so these are
the configurations.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.760
From A is right behind B, to
A is right in front of B.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.720
So let me draw that.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.050
So, train A, I'll do
in this blue color.

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.670
So train a is like that.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.380
And it's 200 meters long.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.210
And then train B, I'll
do in this green color.

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.430
Train B is double the length.

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.360
So it's 400 meters.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.390
And so this is a
starting configuration.

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.090
The outline right here.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.400
And it says, it takes 15
seconds to pass it, to go

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.670
to this configuration.

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.080
So the ending configuration
looks like this.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.340
Ending configuration.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.600
Train B here.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.830
And then train A has
passed train B.

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.600
200 meters.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.070
Once again, this is
400 meters here.

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.410
And this situation
takes 15 seconds.

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.850
So this takes 15
seconds to happen.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.010
15 seconds.

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.380
So, A passes B in 15 seconds.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.370
So this whole sentence right
here, is this right here.

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.820
We go from the situation
to that situation.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.540
And then in opposite
directions, they pass

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.390
each other in 5 seconds.

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.260
So from this
configuration to that.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:55.480
So let me draw that.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.540
So, in the opposite direction
example, they start like this.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.260
Train A is 200 meters.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.540
Train B is facing in
the other direction.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.660
I'm doing it probably little
bit too long, 400 meters.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.160
And then in 5 seconds they
get from this configuration

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.160
to this configuration.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.890
To that configuration,
right there.

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:20.900
200.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.850
And, of course, this
right here is 400.

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.540
And this takes-- this right
here takes 5 seconds.

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.890
So in opposite directions they
pass each other in 5 seconds.

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.620
Now, their question is how
fast is each train moving

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:39.980
in meters per second?

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.270
So, once again they gave us--
they didn't really give us a

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:43.490
lot of velocity information.

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.140
They just tell us how
long it takes to pass.

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.830
But maybe using both of these
pieces of information,

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.110
we can solve it.

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.370
So let's say that--
well, you have velocity

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.900
of train A, so vA.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.840
Velocity of train A, and
then of course you have

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.960
the velocity of train B.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.820
And regardless of which
direction they're facing, it

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.470
assumes that they're always
going at the same velocity.

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.330
So in this situation, and we
always have to just

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.970
remember, distance is equal
to rate times time.

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.900
So relative, if we assume,
because when you take a

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.110
velocity, you can always
take a velocity relative

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.160
to something else.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:21.090
So, first of all, relative to
this train right here, to train

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.510
B, how far does train A travel?

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.510
Well, it goes from this point.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.710
It goes from right here.

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:30.880
To, not just 400 meters, it
gets to the point where the

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.930
front of the train is out here.

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.560
So it has to travel 400 meters.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.650
And another 200 meters.

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.136
So it travels 600 meters.

00:03:42.136 --> 00:03:44.660
It travels 600 meters
in this situation.

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.530
And how far does it travel
in this situation?

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.680
Well, once again, if we assume
that this train is stationary,

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.420
and that's, I guess, the key
assumption we have to make.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.090
We're going to do
everything relative.

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.660
We're going to assume that,
even though it is moving at a

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.800
velocity, the position we're
going to make relative.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.330
So, relative to this train,
we move from right here,

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.630
we move 400 meters.

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.010
And then we move 200 more.

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.990
So, again, in both situations,
we move 600 meters.

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:14.310
In this situation we move
600 meters, relative.

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.020
I guess you could say, we move
600 meters relative to the back

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:20.190
of train B in this situation.

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.640
And we move 600 meters relative
to the front of train

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.560
B in this situation.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.330
In this situation, we
do it in 15 seconds.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.890
That's because we're, kind of,
where the velocity of train A

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.510
is being eaten away by
the velocity of B.

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.050
If the velocity of B was 0, if
this green train was really

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.870
stationary, then we'd be moving
relative to this train

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.010
with velocity A.

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:45.400
But now this is moving
at some velocity.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.135
So our relative velocity
to this train is going

00:04:48.135 --> 00:04:48.970
to be something lower.

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.150
And what is the
relative velocity?

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.390
If you're a passenger sitting
in train B, if you're a

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:58.830
passenger sitting in train B,
right there, how fast will it

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.180
look like train A is going?

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.290
What will be the
relative velocity?

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:05.720
Well, it's going to be the
difference between the two.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:06.930
Right?

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.710
So it's going to
be vA minus vB.

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.910
If you're sitting in
this train right there.

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:18.380
And you would say, it
takes 15 seconds.

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.270
So, rate times time.

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:21.700
Times 15 seconds.

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.860
Is equal to a distance
that it traveled.

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.480
And, once again, if you're a
passenger sitting in this green

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:29.120
train right here, you would
say, OK, it went

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.830
from this point.

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.420
It crossed this entire
train then it went

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:32.980
another 200 meters.

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:35.500
So it went 600 meters.

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.360
Now, and this is of
course in seconds.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.220
Now, obviously both of
these trains in this have

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:40.680
some positive velocity.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.470
This train would have moved
even more than 600 meters.

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:45.880
This train moved 100 and
this train would've

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.050
moved 700 meters.

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.830
But I'm doing everything
relative to what this passenger

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:51.870
in the green train sees.

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:52.800
Likewise.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.350
The passenger in the green
train here, let's say the

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:59.820
passenger in the green
train right here.

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:02.040
Oh, I'm doing his arms
coming out of his head.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:06.990
But what velocity does he see
this blue train coming in at?

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:08.970
Well, he's going in
this direction at 400

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:09.990
meters per second.

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:13.150
The other train is coming in--
no, sorry he's going in this

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:15.640
direction at velocity
of train B.

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:16.470
We don't know what that is.

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:18.450
400 is how long it is.

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:21.250
And this train is coming with
velocity, want to do it

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:24.350
in blue, with velocity a.

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:25.920
So you would add the
two velocities.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:28.380
If this is coming at 60 miles
per hour and this is going in

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:31.040
that direction at 60 miles per
hour, to this guy who's

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:35.350
stationery in train B, he would
just feel like this train

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:37.720
is approaching him at
120 miles per hour.

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:39.920
Or the addition of those two.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.940
So from this guy's point of
view, this train is approaching

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:46.970
with the velocity-- let me do,
is approaching with the

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:49.690
velocity vA plus vB.

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:55.985
And in 5 seconds-- and they
give us that information.

00:06:55.985 --> 00:06:58.895
In 5 seconds-- so velocity
times time, or rate times

00:06:58.895 --> 00:07:02.900
time, is equal to distance--
it travels 600 meters.

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:06.150
Remember, this is all relative
to the guy, or the gal,

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:07.660
sitting on this green train.

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:09.540
And that's kind of the key
assumption you have to make to

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:11.330
make this problem solvable.

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:13.530
Well, now we have two equations
and two unknowns, we should

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:14.560
be able to solve this.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.450
For the velocity of
the two trains.

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:19.490
So, just to simplify,
let's divide both sides

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:21.510
of this one by 15.

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:25.190
So we have the velocity of A
minus the velocity of B, is

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:29.510
equal to 40 meters per second.

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:29.960
Right?

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:32.050
60 divided by 15 is 4.

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:33.080
Yep, 40.

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:36.900
And then here we have the
velocity of A plus the velocity

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:43.190
of B, that's an A, is equal
to 120 meters per second.

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:45.140
And, see, we could just
take this equation.

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:46.060
Put it down here.

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:47.730
We could add the two
equations to each other.

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:51.870
So if the velocity of A minus
the velocity of B is equal

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:54.980
to 40 meters per second.

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:57.210
Add the two equations.

00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:00.030
We get 2 times the
velocity of A.

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:01.770
These two cancel out.

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:05.200
Is equal to 160
meters per second.

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:09.230
Or the velocity of A is equal
to 80 meters per second.

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:10.780
And then we can just
back-substitute here.

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:13.020
The difference between
the two is 40.

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:16.490
So it's the 80 minus the
velocity of B is equal to

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:18.360
40 meters per second.

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:20.290
So what's the velocity of B?

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:23.540
Well, you could subtract
80 from both sides.

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:27.100
You get minus velocity of
B is equal to minus 40.

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:30.940
Or the velocity of B is equal
to 40 meters per second.

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:32.410
And we've done the problem.

00:08:32.410 --> 00:08:34.960
And the key assumption there is
to do everything relative to

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:38.270
the green guy sitting
inside of train B.

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:39.260
You could have done
it the other way.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.780
You could have picked
other relative positions.

00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:45.480
But that, in my brain, is the
easiest way to figure it out.

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:48.330
So, this guy, in this case,
is going at the speed at

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:50.530
40 meters per second.

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:53.930
And this guy is going at
80 meters per second.

00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:57.890
In this situation, this guy is
traveling at 80 meters per

00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:01.240
second and this guy going in
this direction at 40

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:02.330
meters per second.

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:03.030
Anyway.

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:06.000
Thanks again to Kortaggio
for that problem.
