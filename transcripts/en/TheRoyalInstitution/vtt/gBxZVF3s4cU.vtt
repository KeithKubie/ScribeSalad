00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.820
 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:18.130
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:25.390
On the 30th of April, 1852,
Thomas Henry Huxley, one of my

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.220
scientific heroes, walked
through that door to give his

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.580
first Friday evening
discourse.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:38.375
His heart was beating like a
sledgehammer, as is mine.

00:00:38.375 --> 00:00:41.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.270
He wrote to his wife later, I
now know what it feels like to

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.606
be going to be hanged.

00:00:46.606 --> 00:00:50.200
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.660
His nervousness, I think,
was partly the

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.130
fault of the audience.

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.380
He continued, in his letter,
"the audience is a most

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:04.319
peculiar one-- at once the best
and worst in London."

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:05.330
Such as tonight.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:11.610
"The best because you have all
the first scientific men--

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.810
the worst because you
have a great number

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.690
of fashionable ladies.

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.380
The only plan is to take
a profound subject--

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.120
and play at battle and
shuttle-cock with it--

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.560
so as to suit both."

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.510
Well, Huxley's outrageous
division of the sexes is, of

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.910
course, of its time.

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.650
We know now, thanks to quantum
mechanics, that ladies can be

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.390
fashionable and intelligent
at the same time.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.000
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.225
As can men.

00:01:45.225 --> 00:01:48.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.080
But where I agree
with Huxley--

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.500
and I agree with him on many
other topics, as well--

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.890
is in the choice of a
profound subject.

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.990
And I hope I have chosen
a suitably

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.920
deep subject for tonight.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.440
What I want to tell you about
is the technique of x-ray

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.540
crystallography, a technique
that has a very famous and

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.009
intimate relationship
with this place.

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.120
And it's a technique we are
celebrating the 100th

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.190
anniversary of the invention
of this method, which has

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.280
shown us the world in
unprecedented detail.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.220
And we're celebrating the
centenary this year.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.820
Now, unfortunately, it doesn't
really have the appeal in the

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.380
public domain that
I would like.

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.300
It's hidden from us, and that's
partly because the

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.310
technique relies on a phenomenon
that is not

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.270
available to us in our
everyday lives.

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.120
We don't come across x-ray
diffraction, which is the

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.240
physical principle of which
the method relies.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.300
But, it does speak to a broader
subject, which is

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.600
humankind's obsession with
seeing things that are

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.840
normally too small to see.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.320
And that's something that,
actually, has grabbed the

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.840
human imagination for as long as
we have been putting lenses

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.760
together to make telescopes
and microscopes.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.635
And one of the most famous
publications from the 1600s--

00:03:05.635 --> 00:03:09.650
it was 1665, and we have
an original copy here--

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.810
is Micrographia, written by
Robert Hooke, who was a

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.430
pioneer of microscopy.

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.810
And this was a very popular
book in its day.

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.050
It was a bestseller.

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:24.400
Peeps tweeted about it.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.620
It is the most ingenious
book I have ever read.

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.690
And the secret of Hooke's
success, I think, was that he

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.590
included images of things
that were familiar--

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.780
such as his famous flea--

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.140
even if they were largely
unseen to most people.

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.610
And these astonishing detailed
pictures of the horrific flea

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:51.290
delighted and enthralled the
people who bought his book.

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.860
But, the trouble with
microscopy is

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.100
that it has got limits.

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.890
It's fantastic in its own way,
but there are limits in a

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:59.550
number of ways.

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.100
One is, that when you're
illuminating material with

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.150
visible light, you, generally,
only see the surface.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.070
You see the light that is
reflected off the surface of

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.040
the material, as with
the flea here.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.860
You can't see inside.

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.060
And also, you are limited in
the size of the things that

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.600
you can see.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.640
What if you want to see
the molecules that the

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.100
flea is made of?

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.000
And what I want to tell you
tonight is about the use of

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.370
x-rays in order to solve
both of those problems.

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.790
And I hope, in doing so, to sort
of set the ball rolling

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.850
in a popularisation
of the technique.

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.630
Because, now that we're
celebrating the centenary, it

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.170
is a method that has really

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:38.940
transformed all of the sciences.

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.750
It relies on a rather beautiful
piece of physics and

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.620
mathematics, but it has informed
not only those

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.380
subjects, but mineralogy,
chemistry, and biology.

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.970
It has really brought us an
acquaintance with the world at

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:56.310
the molecular and anatomic
level, which was simply not

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:01.020
appreciated prior to the turn
of the 20th century.

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.340
So, I'm going to make you work
a little bit hard a couple of

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.490
times during this, as I
go through the theory.

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.610
But I am not going to delve into
all the gory details--

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.800
I will spare you that,
ladies and gentleman.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.120
But I do want to tell you about
how you use x-rays, and

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.080
how you use them in a
very particular way.

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.070
Now, from the very beginning, it
was obvious that x-rays was

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.100
a special kind of light,
because it

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:25.650
could see through matter.

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.320
And here you can see one
of the very first--

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.750
it wasn't quite a
medical x-ray.

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.380
I think it was more an
experiment that Rontgen, who

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:37.730
discovered x-rays in 1895, did--
not on his own hand,

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:43.120
smartly, but on that of
his fashionable wife.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.520
And what you can see is that
the skin and soft tissue is

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.390
largely transparent, because
matter is mostly transparent

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:53.400
or semi-transparent to x-rays.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.260
But the bone is slightly
denser.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.630
It's got calcium atoms in it,
and so it casts a shadow.

00:05:58.630 --> 00:05:59.580
And the ring--

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.800
let's give Rontgen a bit of
credit and assume that it's

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.750
gold, which, with an atomic
number of 79, is very

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:06.470
electron-dense.

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:11.570
And so it scatters x-rays and
casts a darker shadow.

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:15.830
So, what's happening here is
that the electrons in the

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:19.880
atoms and molecules of Anna
Bertha's hand are scattering

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:23.600
x-rays out of the beam,
and so it attenuates

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:24.850
the transmitted beam.

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:26.310
And so you see the shadow.

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:28.670
But rather than being a solid
shadow, we see that it's

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:31.825
semi-transparent because the
x-rays are very penetrating.

00:06:31.825 --> 00:06:34.400
 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.290
So, let's think about the
scattering that's happening

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:40.540
and that explains that
x-ray pattern--

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:42.760
that x-ray shadow.

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:46.500
So, x-rays, we now know, is
a special kind of light.

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:49.740
It just has a very short
wavelength, and it effectively

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:53.150
consists of an oscillating
electric and magnetic field.

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:56.070
Here, we're just showing the
electric field, and it's about

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:57.660
to hit an electron.

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:00.160
And when an electric field
hits an electron--

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.520
a charged particle--

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:05.210
it causes that electron to
oscillate up and down.

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:09.660
And an oscillating electron
will, itself, emit radiation

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:12.970
of the same wavelength, and
so it emits x-rays.

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:16.750
And, in fact, almost in all
directions are x-rays emitted.

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:20.940
And so, the transmitted
beam is attenuated

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.420
somewhat because of that.

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:25.600
Most of the x-ray is unaffected,
but a small part

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:27.590
of the energy is re-radiated--

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:29.250
scattered, we say--

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:31.170
in all directions.

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:33.650
And if we look at a more
realistic representation of an

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:39.010
atom, we can see that what
happens is, the straight

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:43.480
through beam is attenuated
as the x-ray is partially

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:46.620
scattered by the electrons
in the atom.

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:49.860
So, what the x-ray is doing is
penetrating and sampling all

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:54.421
of that structure that's
inside the atom.

00:07:54.421 --> 00:07:57.710
Now, when we take medical
x-rays, we're only really

00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:00.690
looking at the transmitted
beam, and we ignore the

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:02.910
scattered radiation.

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:05.900
But the technique of x-ray
crystallography actually

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:08.335
relies on the scattered
radiation, because it, in

00:08:08.335 --> 00:08:12.610
itself, contains information
about the object that's doing

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:14.080
the scattering.

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:16.970
And that is the basis of the
technique that I want to tell

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:18.630
you about tonight.

00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:21.070
And what this technique
can do--

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:23.340
because of the penetrating power
of the x-rays, it shows

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:25.730
us the interior structure
of things.

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:30.690
And it does so, not just at a
fairly anatomical level--

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:32.870
we can actually begin to learn
about the structures of

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:34.610
molecules and of atoms.

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:36.220
And that happens because
of a very

00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:39.202
peculiar property of light--

00:08:39.202 --> 00:08:40.820
of any kind of radiation--

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:43.980
when it interacts with matter
which is of the similar size

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:47.130
to its own wavelength.

00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:49.010
And we can get an understanding
of that-- that

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:51.290
process, that phenomenon
of diffraction.

00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:54.070
So what happens is, when light
scatters from an object that

00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:56.720
is about the same size as the
wavelength, it scatters in

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:58.160
many directions.

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:02.490
And we can get an idea of that
by repeating classic optics

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:04.660
experiments that were done in
the early part of the 19th

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:07.980
century by a polymath,
Thomas Young.

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:11.000
And I don't know how Young
managed to do these, because I

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.900
think he only had candles
at his disposal.

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:16.530
But, fortunately,
we have a laser.

00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:22.900
So, I would like to just show
you the principle of

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:27.680
diffraction that occurs in order
to give you an idea of

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:31.760
the strange property of light
when it interacts with matter.

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:36.570
So, if I just blank the slides
and we could have the lights

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:39.550
down a little bit, we'll be
able to see what happens.

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:44.190
So, this is a very cheap laser,
and the beauty of laser

00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:47.790
light is that it gives us a very
fine, very bright, and a

00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:49.540
very parallel beam.

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:51.450
And that beam is travelling
in a dead straight

00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:53.260
line from the laser--

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:54.725
bouncing of the mirror,
of course--

00:09:54.725 --> 00:09:56.370
to the screen.

00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:57.670
So, we see a fine spot.

00:09:57.670 --> 00:10:00.820
But, if we then take an object,
a very simple object--

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:03.590
and this is just a single slit,
so there's a small gap

00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:06.400
here, which is of approximately
the same size as

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:09.740
the wavelength of light--

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:10.815
we can see--

00:10:10.815 --> 00:10:11.970
let me see.

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:13.770
Let me get that right.

00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:15.290
OK.

00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:17.340
So, you have to look a bit
closely, but what you see is

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:19.300
we no longer have
a simple spot.

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:22.310
And we don't have an image
of the slit, either--

00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:24.870
the slit is just a rectangular
aperture.

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:27.140
But, you see, what has happened
is the light is

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:29.230
spreading out at an angle.

00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:29.520
OK?

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:31.620
Not necessarily very much
here, but enough

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:32.870
that you can see it.

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:35.450
And you can see there's a bright
band in the middle, and

00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:38.670
then flanking it on either side,
if my laser holds up--

00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:39.850
well, there we go--

00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:43.000
then you can see that there are
fainter bands on either

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.650
side, as well.

00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:46.850
And what that tells
us is two things.

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:52.820
One is that the light
is bent--

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:55.480
it's scattered at an angle
by the small object--

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:58.770
and that there's a pattern
here that appears to be

00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:00.880
related to the particular
structure that's doing the

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.110
scattering.

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:04.120
And so, there's a relationship
that, if you understand the

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:07.170
rules of optics, we could work
backward from that pattern to

00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:09.980
figure out that we had
a single slit here.

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:11.880
Now let's see what happens
when we put two

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.110
slits into the beam.

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:16.610
So, these are just two slits,
both the same width as the

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:21.470
original slit in the
first slide.

00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:25.040
And now, we can see that there
is a different pattern,

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:27.140
although it is similar
to the first one.

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:31.260
So again, there's a central
broad band, and its flanked by

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:32.440
fainter bands on either side.

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:34.790
But now, each of those bands
is actually split into a

00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:36.380
series of dots.

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:39.520
So, again, that tells us that
we've changed the structure,

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:41.910
here, that's doing the
scattering, and that changes

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:45.670
the diffraction pattern that
we see on the wall.

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:48.470
But, because the structure here
is simply a duplicate of

00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:51.110
the first structure, the
overall pattern-- the

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:54.335
envelope, as it were-- of the
intensity variation changes.

00:11:54.335 --> 00:11:57.890
It's just that we see different
points of light.

00:11:57.890 --> 00:12:05.450
And if we go from two slits,
now, to six, then we see that,

00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:08.570
again, we get a similar
overall pattern--

00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:12.110
a, sort of, central bright than
flanked by fainter bands

00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:13.290
on either side.

00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:16.470
And, again, now they are
divided into dots.

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:19.370
And the pattern of dots is
exactly the same as with the

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:22.530
two slits, because the spacing
between the six slits is the

00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:25.410
same as the spacing between
the two slits.

00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:27.930
And that's a point I want you to
keep in mind because we'll

00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:31.110
come back to talk about that
when we talk about crystals

00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:32.370
and what crystals do.

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:36.720
Because a crystal is, simply,
a repeating form of matter.

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:40.420
You have a structure that is
repeated, and we will be using

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:43.540
that to probe the structure
of matter.

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:48.420
But the optics shows us how
that principle works.

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:52.450
So, that's my diffraction,
but--

00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:55.530
so, I've mentioned crystals
there, and I showed you that--

00:12:55.530 --> 00:12:58.910
with a repeating pattern
of the slits--

00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:01.370
was important for getting an
interesting diffraction

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:05.700
pattern on the screen, that we
could then start to think

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:06.665
about it and interpreting.

00:13:06.665 --> 00:13:10.370
Although I haven't explained to
you, yet, how you do that.

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:13.430
But, before I do that, we want
to, then, actually grow some

00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:14.880
crystals of our own.

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:20.185
So, if Jayshan, my assistant,
is going to come here.

00:13:20.185 --> 00:13:20.870
And so Jayshan--

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:23.640
he's a novice crystallographer.

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:32.390
And so, what Jayshan is doing
here is, we have a solution of

00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:33.180
a protein--

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:36.320
a purified protein-- called
lysozyme, which some of you

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:39.380
may be familiar with.

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:42.360
OK, we have pre-filled these
small wells with a solution

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:44.430
that's got a high concentration
of sodium

00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:46.960
chloride and an organic solvent,
called polyethylene

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:48.850
glycol, or PEG.

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:54.050
And Jayshan is currently mixing
some of that solution

00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:57.600
in with a drop of protein in
this well, and he's then going

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.330
to seal the chamber.

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:01.200
And what's going to
happen over the

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.170
course of the lecture--

00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:03.860
we hope--

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:08.440
is that, because we have a high
concentration here, you

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:10.625
have a lower vapour pressure
above the reservoir.

00:14:10.625 --> 00:14:13.940
And so water gradually moves
through the vapor phase, out

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:16.610
of the drop and into
the reservoir.

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:19.380
And what that will do over a
course of minutes, that will

00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:22.030
reduce the volume of the drop,
and it will increase the

00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:25.860
concentration of protein inside
the drop to a point

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:29.410
where, we hope, it starts to
precipitate out of solution.

00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:31.420
And when a protein precipitates
out of solution,

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:34.220
what that means is that the
molecules are starting to

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:34.960
stick together.

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:39.260
They interact with one another
rather than interact with the

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:40.370
water molecules.

00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:43.990
And what we hope is that they
will aggregate together in a

00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:49.050
very regular array to give
us a protein crystal.

00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:51.950
So, we are almost
done with that.

00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:55.210
I did say he was a novice.

00:14:55.210 --> 00:14:56.510
I was going to do this myself.

00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:59.760
I thought I'd be too nervous,
but my hand looks OK.

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:01.350
The trouble is that's the
hand I pipet with.

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:04.540
 

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:08.200
I believe that is a Tommy Cooper
joke, just to give

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:10.570
proper attribution.

00:15:10.570 --> 00:15:11.930
So, we are going to put
that on one side.

00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:13.820
We want to take it out of the
bright lights in case the

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:16.900
temperature perturbs it, but
we will come back to that

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:19.530
experiment later
in the lecture.

00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:21.750
But, I'm getting a little bit
ahead of myself with crystals.

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:24.100
I've told you about x-rays
and diffraction.

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:29.260
Let's think about how the two
were finally brought together.

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:34.740
So, as I said, x-rays were
discovered in 1895 by Rontgen.

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:37.470
And they were quite a puzzle at
the beginning, although we

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:41.910
now know that they are a type of
electromagnetic radiation,

00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:43.610
and so they are waves.

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:45.880
At the time, there was a great
debate-- are they waves or are

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:46.840
they particles?

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:50.200
It really wasn't known, and
many people spent a lot of

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:53.060
time trying to investigate their
properties in order to

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:56.040
work it out.

00:15:56.040 --> 00:16:00.220
And, in Germany then, a
scientist called Max Von Laue

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:03.160
thought that he would be able
to crack the problem.

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:07.370
Because he reasoned that inside
crystals, and in a

00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:10.720
crystal of copper sulphate--
this is a beautiful blue

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:12.090
crystal, here--

00:16:12.090 --> 00:16:14.395
it was well understood, because
of the regular faces

00:16:14.395 --> 00:16:16.740
that one sees in crystalline
solids--

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:19.560
it was already presumed that the
atoms or molecules within

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:22.410
them would be lined up
in regular arrays.

00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:25.930
And Laue figured that the
wavelength of x-rays was

00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:29.080
probably about the same size
as the spacing between the

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:32.400
atoms in crystals like
copper sulphate.

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:37.490
And so, he persuaded to Walter
Friedrich and Paul Knipping to

00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:39.360
do the experiment for him.

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:42.780
So, I guess they were the
Jayshan's of their day.

00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:46.420
And, what he did was, he took
a Crookes tube, which

00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:50.100
generates x-rays, and put it
through fine slits in order to

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:52.870
get a pencil beam, as
they called it then.

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:55.680
Placed a crystal here, in their
experiment, and then

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:58.480
placed a photographic plate
at the far side.

00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:01.050
And they exposed that for
several hours, and then

00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:04.589
developed it on tenterhooks
in the dark room, and then

00:17:04.589 --> 00:17:07.250
produced one of the
most remarkable

00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:09.400
images of the 20th century.

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:13.780
 

00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:17.670
Now, I know it doesn't look like
much, but it is a truly

00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:20.369
significant scientific result.

00:17:20.369 --> 00:17:23.079
It does look like a
horrible smudge--

00:17:23.079 --> 00:17:26.109
maybe it's a Rorschach diagram,
I'm not quite sure--

00:17:26.109 --> 00:17:28.480
but what you can see
are two things.

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:30.860
One, there is a diffraction
pattern there.

00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:32.650
It's not a very regular
diffraction pattern, not

00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:34.150
immediately apparent.

00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:37.020
But you can see that the beam
has been split into different

00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:39.390
rays, and so it's scattering.

00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:43.210
So there's a ray here and a ray
here, and these are spread

00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:44.830
out from the middle.

00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:47.390
So the audience, here, is where
the x-ray beam came

00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:50.160
from, and this is the pattern.

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:54.640
So, Laue's hypothesis was
supported, so it did suggest

00:17:54.640 --> 00:18:00.530
that x-rays are waves and that
crystals could be used as a

00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:02.300
diffraction grating for them.

00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:04.210
But-- as well as showing
that they were waves--

00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:06.970
because you have a pattern here,
what that tells you is

00:18:06.970 --> 00:18:09.050
that the structure within
the crystal--

00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:11.560
because the beam has passed
straight through and been

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:13.390
scattered off at angles--

00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:16.690
the structure of the crystal has
imprinted itself, somehow,

00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:18.590
on the pattern of scattering.

00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:20.610
And so, what you have
in this pattern--

00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:24.390
and when they moved the
photographic plate back a bit,

00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:26.730
they got a slightly
better resolved

00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:28.330
separation of the spots--

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:31.860
but there's information in here
about the structure of

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:33.820
the crystal that they
were analysing.

00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:35.660
Now, this wasn't the most
regular pattern.

00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:37.930
It turns out, there were good
reasons, initially, for

00:18:37.930 --> 00:18:39.660
choosing copper sulphate,
but--

00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:42.220
although it is a nice,
regular array--

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:45.210
the atoms are not arranged, in
copper sulphate, in a very

00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:46.870
symmetric pattern.

00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:49.850
So they then chose a crystal
of zinc blende,

00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:51.380
which is zinc sulphide.

00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:54.200
And from the appearance of these
beautiful crystals, you

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:57.010
can tell that it does look like
the atoms are lined up in

00:18:57.010 --> 00:18:59.090
a cubic type of formation.

00:18:59.090 --> 00:19:01.490
And that certainly turns
out to be the case.

00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:04.500
And if you take one of these
crystals and you orient it

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:08.000
properly in the beam, then you
get a much nicer pattern.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.730
And you can see, actually, that
the pattern of scattering

00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:14.665
of the x-rays has a four-fold
symmetry.

00:19:14.665 --> 00:19:20.200
You can see this makes a sort
of square that is hinting at

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:23.260
four-fold symmetry, which you
would expect for a cube,

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:25.710
inside the crystal.

00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:29.630
But, Laue tried to analyse this
pattern and he was mostly

00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:32.370
able to solve it, but he
wasn't quite able to

00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:33.790
get the whole way.

00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:37.330
And this is in 1912.

00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:39.230
So, it was a major
breakthrough.

00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:44.080
It was big news in Europe, but
Laue himself wasn't able to

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:47.000
solve the structure, wasn't able
to figure out exactly how

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.310
it is that you use x-ray
diffraction information in

00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:51.440
order to work out structures.

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:54.970
That fell to the father and
son team of William and

00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:57.484
Lawrence Bragg.

00:19:57.484 --> 00:20:02.320
Now, William was already,
at that time, a renowned

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:05.820
physicist and had been working
on the problem of x-rays up to

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:08.940
that point for the past 10 or
15 years, and was a world

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:10.160
expert on that.

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:13.610
And so, a Norwegian colleague of
his, Lars Vegard, wrote to

00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:15.110
him, because he'd been
to Munich and

00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:17.160
he'd talked to Laue.

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:20.250
And he sent a letter saying,
"Recently, however, certain

00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:22.590
new curious properties of x-rays
have been discovered by

00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:26.810
Dr. Laue in Munich." And the
letter was a long and detailed

00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:29.810
account of the experiments, and
Laue was even kind enough

00:20:29.810 --> 00:20:32.510
to give Vegard a photograph,
which he then knew he was

00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:33.590
going to send the Bragg's.

00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:36.520
So, this was a very nice
example of scientific

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:39.440
international co-operation.

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:44.510
And this happened in the summer
of 1912, and Lawrence,

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:48.240
William's son, had just
completed his second degree--

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:50.140
a degree in physics--
in Cambridge.

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:52.780
He'd earlier got a degree in
mathematics when they were

00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:55.350
living in Adelaide
in Australia.

00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:59.170
And it was Lawrence, really, who
was able, ultimately, to

00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:02.530
crack the problem of figuring
out how there is a

00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:05.320
relationship between the
scattering pattern of the

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:11.970
x-rays and the structure
of inside the crystal.

00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:14.010
And it was fortunate
for him, in a way.

00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:16.920
There was a sort of coming
together of events.

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:19.190
He'd just finished his physics
degree, so he had been

00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:22.860
learning about electromagnetic
radiation, he'd been learning

00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:25.060
about the symmetry
of crystals.

00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:30.030
And he also was blessed with a
father who was a world expert

00:21:30.030 --> 00:21:33.180
in x-rays and who had, then,
received this letter.

00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:36.440
They hadn't actually
seen Laue's paper.

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:40.930
And Lawrence realised that the
key to the problem was

00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:44.180
realising that what's happening
is that the x-rays

00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:47.650
are reflecting off planes
of atoms in the crystal.

00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:50.970
And so, I'm going to make you
work hard here by explaining

00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:52.990
to you a little bit
of the theory.

00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:54.350
So, we are all familiar--

00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:57.260
at least those of us who
wash regularly--

00:21:57.260 --> 00:22:00.230
with the laws of reflection.

00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:02.870
So, you know that the angle of
incidence equals the angle of

00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:05.830
reflection for light
impinging on a

00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:07.895
silvered or polished surface.

00:22:07.895 --> 00:22:10.710
Now, that law of reflection
applies equally-- although I

00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:11.920
won't explain the details--

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:13.920
even if that surface
is discontinuous--

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:18.510
say, for example, it was made
up of a set of atoms.

00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:21.400
But remember, if we're now
thinking about what x-rays do

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:25.060
to atoms, matter is mostly
transparent to x-rays.

00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:26.880
And so, a large fraction
of the energy will

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:29.270
actually pass through--

00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:31.370
certainly the top
layer of atoms.

00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:34.500
Only a small fraction of
it will be reflected.

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:37.090
Most of the energy--
more than 99%--

00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:38.820
goes straight through.

00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:41.670
And so, that will interact,
then, with the layers of atoms

00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:42.770
below that in the crystal.

00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:47.430
And we have regular arrays of
atoms-- many, many of them.

00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:50.360
And each layer will then,
itself, reflect a tiny

00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:52.950
fraction of the incident
x-rays.

00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:56.180
And what Lawrence realised was
that what he needed to do was,

00:22:56.180 --> 00:23:00.190
to work out how much the beam
is scattered in this

00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:02.645
direction, he needed to add
up all of these rays.

00:23:02.645 --> 00:23:05.590
Now, this diagram is getting a
little bit complicated, but

00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:09.250
Lawrence had a gift, I think,
for simplifying things.

00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:12.430
So, let's just think about one
of the rays going through, and

00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:16.560
you get a partial reflection of
every single layer within

00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:19.980
the crystal, from this
law of reflection.

00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:22.460
Now, we also have to remember
that what's happening here is

00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:25.460
an electromagnetic phenomenon,
so the x-rays are waves.

00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:28.520
And so, we have to think about
what the waves are doing.

00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:31.870
And to make it even simpler
mathematically, we can boil

00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:34.530
that down to just two waves,
although let me just tell

00:23:34.530 --> 00:23:39.920
you-- so here, the scattered
rays are what we call in

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:45.570
phase, and what that means is
that the peaks are lined up.

00:23:45.570 --> 00:23:47.760
And so, all the peaks are lined
up and all the troughs

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:48.400
are lined up.

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:51.360
And when that happens, when you
add those waves together,

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:52.910
you get a very big wave--

00:23:52.910 --> 00:23:54.350
a wave with a very
big amplitude.

00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:56.370
It oscillates massively.

00:23:56.370 --> 00:23:57.980
So, that's called constructive
interference.

00:23:57.980 --> 00:24:01.050
And so, that's the best way
that waves can add up,

00:24:01.050 --> 00:24:03.140
although there are other
relationships,

00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:04.950
too, as we'll see.

00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:10.210
But let's plough on and see how
these relationships arise.

00:24:10.210 --> 00:24:15.140
So, if we just think about by
what's happening in the

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:17.230
reflections of adjacent
rays-- so the top

00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:19.300
one and the one below.

00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:23.430
So, we have the incident ray--
comes here and goes away.

00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:27.420
And then the lower ray hits
the bottom layer and is

00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:28.670
reflected off the lower layer.

00:24:28.670 --> 00:24:34.250
 

00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:35.650
So let me just get that.

00:24:35.650 --> 00:24:40.300
So what you see is that
the lower ray has to

00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:42.080
travel a bit further.

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:42.420
OK?

00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:45.610
So it sort of falls out of
step with the upper ray,

00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:48.030
because it has a shorter
path to go around.

00:24:48.030 --> 00:24:50.790
It's like running in the outside
lane on an athletics

00:24:50.790 --> 00:24:51.940
track, as it were.

00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:55.000
But, as long as this extra
distance travelled--

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.850
which is indicated by the two
black arrows on my diagram--

00:24:57.850 --> 00:25:01.610
is equal to one wavelength, or
two wavelengths, or three

00:25:01.610 --> 00:25:04.280
wavelengths, or any whole number
of wavelengths, then

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:06.300
the waves will be
back in step.

00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:09.000
And so, they will add up, and
you will get appreciable

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.220
scattering in this direction.

00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:15.900
So, Lawrence Bragg worked out,
by simple trigonometry, that

00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:19.880
this extra distance from the
spacing d, and when you're

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:23.010
reflecting at an angle theta,
the path difference is equal

00:25:23.010 --> 00:25:25.050
to 2d sine theta.

00:25:25.050 --> 00:25:27.490
And if that path difference--

00:25:27.490 --> 00:25:31.160
2d sine theta-- is equal to a
whole number of wavelengths--

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:33.780
so, the wavelength is simply
the distance between two

00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:35.120
adjacent peaks--

00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:39.910
then you will get appreciable
scattering in this direction.

00:25:39.910 --> 00:25:42.496
And that is Bragg's Law.

00:25:42.496 --> 00:25:45.500
Now, if you look at a slightly
different angle--

00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:47.910
and here we've just changed
the angle of incidence--

00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:50.770
and in this particular case--
the way that I've chosen it--

00:25:50.770 --> 00:25:55.340
the path difference is such that
the lower wavelength is

00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:59.250
out of step by half a
wavelength, or a whole odd

00:25:59.250 --> 00:26:01.310
number of half wavelengths.

00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:04.970
So, in this case, the peak of
the top ray lines up with the

00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:07.110
trough of the bottom ray.

00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:10.430
And that means, in this case,
that these two rays cancel one

00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:13.110
another out, so you
get no scattering.

00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:15.280
Now, if you think about it,
you'll have the same

00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:18.110
relationship for the next pair
of layers down, and then the

00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:20.170
next pair after that,
and so you get no

00:26:20.170 --> 00:26:21.910
scattering in that direction.

00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:25.150
And so, what Bragg's Law tells
you is which directions you're

00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:27.820
going to get scattering in,
depending on the angle that

00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:30.100
you're looking at and
the spacing--

00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:32.450
which is an indication
of the structure--

00:26:32.450 --> 00:26:34.360
within the crystal.

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:36.700
Now, you might think, well,
OK, he's just shown us two

00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:38.900
particular special
directions there.

00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:43.090
But, actually, Bragg's Law is a
very severe law, and it only

00:26:43.090 --> 00:26:45.830
allows scattering
if it is true.

00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:48.850
So, let me show you how that
works out by a slightly more

00:26:48.850 --> 00:26:51.220
sophisticated example, and I'm
going to come to the front so

00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:54.370
I can see this with
you, as well.

00:26:54.370 --> 00:26:57.770
So, let's think about a case
where it's coming in at an

00:26:57.770 --> 00:27:00.210
angle, and the difference
between adjacent layers is

00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:03.700
such that the path difference
is only 1.01 wavelengths.

00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:05.380
It's a percent out.

00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:06.780
So, this ray--

00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:10.390
this wave-- is almost exactly
in phase with the lower one.

00:27:10.390 --> 00:27:12.050
Near as dammit.

00:27:12.050 --> 00:27:16.340
And if you, then, think about
the next ray up, that is twice

00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:17.770
as far away from
the first ray.

00:27:17.770 --> 00:27:20.210
And so, the path difference
is doubled.

00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:23.720
And in this case, the path
difference is 2.02 lambda,

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:28.195
which is, again, almost in
phase with the lower one.

00:27:28.195 --> 00:27:30.060
So you kind of think, well,
this is going to add up--

00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:33.090
there's going to be quite
an appreciable amount.

00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:35.410
And the same for the third
one-- it's only 3% out.

00:27:35.410 --> 00:27:37.440
It's not really too bad.

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:40.400
But, by the time you get
up to the 51st layer--

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:42.940
and remember that in any given
crystal there will be

00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:45.230
thousands upon thousands
of layers, if not

00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:47.210
millions upon millions--

00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:51.560
when you get to the 51st, the
path difference is 50.5

00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:52.510
wavelengths.

00:27:52.510 --> 00:27:56.810
And so, this ray is half a
wavelength out of step with

00:27:56.810 --> 00:28:01.070
the one from layer one, and so,
those two will cancel out.

00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:03.650
The diagram is a little bit
misleading, but they are close

00:28:03.650 --> 00:28:06.340
enough in space that you do
get interference here.

00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:13.010
And so, the 51st layer will
cancel with the first one.

00:28:13.010 --> 00:28:17.700
What that means also, then, is
that the scattering from 52 is

00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:19.580
going to be half a
step out with the

00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:22.090
scattering from layer two.

00:28:22.090 --> 00:28:27.860
And so on, up the stack of
layers in the crystal.

00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:31.270
So, unless Bragg's Law
is satisfied--

00:28:31.270 --> 00:28:35.530
and that is, bang on, one,
two, three, or four

00:28:35.530 --> 00:28:36.210
wavelengths--

00:28:36.210 --> 00:28:37.920
then you do not get
any scattering.

00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:41.560
And so, Bragg's Law places a
severe restriction on the

00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:43.540
scattering of the planes.

00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:46.010
But it also tells you
interesting information about

00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:48.790
the spacing between
those planes.

00:28:48.790 --> 00:28:49.920
And also--

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:52.790
we've just looked at one
horizontal set of planes in

00:28:52.790 --> 00:28:54.000
the crystal--

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.380
but there are many other ways
of looking at crystals.

00:28:57.380 --> 00:29:00.530
These are the horizontal planes,
but you can equally

00:29:00.530 --> 00:29:04.000
imagine that the atoms line up
in a completely different way.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.130
And so, we have an angled
set of planes here.

00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:09.880
But you can look at the same
thing again, and you have

00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:13.670
another set of angled planes,
each with different spacings.

00:29:13.670 --> 00:29:18.460
And what Lawrence realised was
the spots in a diffraction

00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:21.480
pattern are simply all the
various different reflections

00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:25.820
that are allowed by his
law coming off the

00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:26.890
interior of the crystal.

00:29:26.890 --> 00:29:30.110
And we can maybe get an idea
of that just if we look in

00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:30.840
three dimensions.

00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:35.630
So, here is a atomic lattice,
but if we sort of tilt it in

00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:38.980
three dimensions, you can see
that we see a horizontal set

00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:42.850
of planes, there, from the way
that the atoms line up.

00:29:42.850 --> 00:29:46.390
But we can rotate it again, and
here we have another set

00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:49.830
of planes which are sloping
down from left to right.

00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:51.800
And then one final one--

00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:54.790
rotate another direction, and
here you can see there's

00:29:54.790 --> 00:29:57.910
another set of planes sloping
from right to left.

00:29:57.910 --> 00:30:00.880
And so, all of those sets of
planes are inside the crystal.

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:05.025
And when x-rays come in to the
crystal, they are bouncing off

00:30:05.025 --> 00:30:08.030
those sets of planes in all
different directions.

00:30:08.030 --> 00:30:10.860
And so, when he looked at a
diffraction pattern-- oh, let

00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:13.200
me get back to the slides--

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:15.850
when he looked at a diffraction
pattern, Lawrence

00:30:15.850 --> 00:30:19.170
realised that what he was seeing
was each of these rays

00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:22.210
was one of the reflections
off one set of planes.

00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:25.300
And so, it was telling him--
and the angle of the ray,

00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:26.450
which you could measure--

00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:29.550
was telling him about the angle
and the separation of

00:30:29.550 --> 00:30:31.260
the planes in the crystal.

00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:33.700
And he realised that by, if he
could figure out where all the

00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:37.220
angled planes were, then the
atoms would be lying at the

00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:39.710
intersections of all
those planes.

00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:42.530
And so, he would then be able to
work out, once he'd solved

00:30:42.530 --> 00:30:43.850
that puzzle--

00:30:43.850 --> 00:30:46.400
he would be able to work out
where the atoms were.

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:50.320
And so, he was the first, in
that case then, to solve the

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:52.860
structure of the atomic
arrangement

00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:54.310
with inside a crystal.

00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:57.400
And this is from zinc blende,
and this is Lawrence's

00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:59.870
interpretation of the pattern,
or his prediction of what the

00:30:59.870 --> 00:31:01.680
diffraction would look
like, once he had

00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:02.670
figured out the structure.

00:31:02.670 --> 00:31:06.400
And as you can see, there's a
very good correspondence.

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:08.850
And he did this just in the few
months after the summer of

00:31:08.850 --> 00:31:12.430
1912, so this was by December
of that year.

00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:14.080
And he'd gone back to Cambridge,
because he was

00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:16.530
working with J.J. Thompson
at the time.

00:31:16.530 --> 00:31:17.530
But, he was in regular

00:31:17.530 --> 00:31:19.850
correspondence with his father.

00:31:19.850 --> 00:31:23.540
"Dear Dad," he writes, and is,
sort of, describing the

00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:24.220
experiment.

00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:26.730
And it's a nice, sort
of, chatty letter.

00:31:26.730 --> 00:31:30.370
He's sending him some
photographs, but some very bad

00:31:30.370 --> 00:31:32.080
prints from the photos.

00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:33.390
They're not very good.

00:31:33.390 --> 00:31:36.460
But you can see there's a very,
sort of, nice statement

00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:41.360
about his excitement
at the achievement.

00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:43.510
So, if you can read the
handwriting-- it's better than

00:31:43.510 --> 00:31:44.610
mine, I have to say--

00:31:44.610 --> 00:31:48.350
"Larry's thing was equivalent to
reflection but of course he

00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:54.150
didn't see it, and it's great
fun getting it straight off,

00:31:54.150 --> 00:31:56.630
isn't it?" So, it's
the young Bragg--

00:31:56.630 --> 00:32:00.630
he was 22, 23 at this time, and
you just get a real sense

00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:01.830
of his excitement.

00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:04.690
And it was a real puzzle-solving
exercise for

00:32:04.690 --> 00:32:08.580
him, and he was jolly pleased
with the result, and quite

00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:10.210
right, too.

00:32:10.210 --> 00:32:11.370
So, they went on.

00:32:11.370 --> 00:32:14.270
Soon, the Bragg's father and son
team are working together

00:32:14.270 --> 00:32:15.820
analysing lots of crystal
structures.

00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:18.230
This is one of their
own early pictures.

00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:23.470
This is from a crystal of
potassium chloride, which is a

00:32:23.470 --> 00:32:25.930
close relation of
sodium chloride.

00:32:25.930 --> 00:32:29.120
And again, Lawrence was able to
interpret the diffraction

00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:34.660
pattern, and this his own
prediction from having worked

00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:35.680
out the structure.

00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:38.150
You can see that he's annotated
it, and here--

00:32:38.150 --> 00:32:39.030
sorry if--

00:32:39.030 --> 00:32:41.950
so, you can see that he
has annotated it.

00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:45.690
And then, they also analysed
sodium chloride, which

00:32:45.690 --> 00:32:47.530
actually has a similar
atomic arrangement.

00:32:47.530 --> 00:32:48.970
But you can see that
there are small

00:32:48.970 --> 00:32:50.770
differences in the pattern.

00:32:50.770 --> 00:32:53.390
You can see, you get many of the
spots in the same places,

00:32:53.390 --> 00:32:58.080
but some of them change in
intensity and darkness.

00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:00.900
And this was an early hint
that it's not just the

00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:02.740
positions of the spots that
are important, but the

00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:04.720
intensities are as well.

00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:07.670
Now, initially they had mostly
just been working on the

00:33:07.670 --> 00:33:10.060
positions of the spots, which
told them about the angles of

00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:11.010
the planes.

00:33:11.010 --> 00:33:12.920
And it was by working out the
angles of the planes that they

00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:15.090
could figure out where
the atoms were.

00:33:15.090 --> 00:33:17.380
But this was an early
indication of a more

00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:21.270
sophisticated analysis that
was to follow it.

00:33:21.270 --> 00:33:24.380
So, this was a structure of
sodium chloride that they

00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:24.890
worked out.

00:33:24.890 --> 00:33:30.040
They published it in 1913, and
even then-- although they

00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:32.200
worked hard on it-- he wasn't
entirely sure of himself.

00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:35.340
It was on this rather slender
and indirect evidence that I

00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:37.750
assigned the structure, in
a paper read to the Royal

00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:39.670
Society in 1913.

00:33:39.670 --> 00:33:43.120
Fortunately, few further
investigation established its

00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:45.054
correctness.

00:33:45.054 --> 00:33:47.470
Now, it was a major
breakthrough.

00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:50.300
This was the first time that
people had seen the interior

00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:53.910
of the matter, had seen the
atomic arrangements inside a

00:33:53.910 --> 00:33:55.560
piece of crystalline matter.

00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:58.530
However, it didn't please
everybody, and it took the

00:33:58.530 --> 00:34:00.570
chemists actually, in
particular, a long time to get

00:34:00.570 --> 00:34:02.220
on board with crystallography--

00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:04.140
or some of them, at least.

00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:08.350
So, Bragg was writing, as late
as 1927, "In sodium chloride

00:34:08.350 --> 00:34:10.810
there appears to be no molecules
represented by

00:34:10.810 --> 00:34:13.020
sodium chloride." The chemists
had expected to see molecules,

00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:14.429
of an atom of sodium
and an atom of

00:34:14.429 --> 00:34:16.880
chloride stuck together.

00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:19.239
"The equality of number of
sodium and chloride atoms is

00:34:19.239 --> 00:34:22.130
arrived at by a chessboard
pattern of these atoms.

00:34:22.130 --> 00:34:25.770
It as a result of geometry and
not a pairing of the atoms."

00:34:25.770 --> 00:34:28.739
Now, a British chemist, by the
name of Henry Armstrong, took

00:34:28.739 --> 00:34:29.750
exception to this.

00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:33.840
He got rather cross, and he
wrote in the pages of Nature,

00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:37.250
"This statement is absurd
to the nth degree,

00:34:37.250 --> 00:34:39.969
not chemical cricket.

00:34:39.969 --> 00:34:43.050
Chemistry is neither chess nor
geometry, whatever x-ray

00:34:43.050 --> 00:34:46.150
physics may be." You can just
hear the disdain in this

00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:48.260
voice. "It's time that chemists
took charge of

00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:53.750
chemistry once more. " So, he
was a little bit out of step,

00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:55.550
perhaps, with many of his
colleagues, because many

00:34:55.550 --> 00:34:57.720
chemists did adopt
crystallography.

00:34:57.720 --> 00:34:59.150
But it didn't phase
the Bragg's .

00:34:59.150 --> 00:35:02.130
They carried on at working
with crystallography.

00:35:02.130 --> 00:35:04.800
An early structure that they
solved the following year was

00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:06.470
the structure of diamond.

00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:10.110
And that was followed, and
again, 10 years later, by the

00:35:10.110 --> 00:35:10.960
structure of graphite.

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:14.210
Now, both of these are forms of
carbon, and this shows how

00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:16.520
understanding the atomic
structure helps us to

00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:19.470
understand the material
properties of these.

00:35:19.470 --> 00:35:22.090
So, in diamond, carbon
is bonded in a

00:35:22.090 --> 00:35:23.590
three-dimensional pattern.

00:35:23.590 --> 00:35:25.700
We have a tetrahedral
arrangement, and you have

00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:28.330
strong bonds in all
three directions.

00:35:28.330 --> 00:35:33.010
Where as in graphite, again, a
pure form of carbon, the atoms

00:35:33.010 --> 00:35:35.660
are arrayed two-dimensional
hexagonal nets.

00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:38.780
And these nets can slide past
one another, and that is why

00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:42.110
graphite is used as the lead
in your pencil, and is very

00:35:42.110 --> 00:35:45.370
soft and leaves a smudge
on a paper.

00:35:45.370 --> 00:35:48.660
So, understanding the intrinsic
structure helps us

00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:51.560
to understand exactly
what the material

00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:52.540
properties of these are.

00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:54.630
So, we're getting new insights
into material

00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:56.220
science from this.

00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:59.650
And the Bragg's kept going
further and further into this.

00:35:59.650 --> 00:36:02.300
They solved more and more
structures, mainly, initially,

00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:04.860
working on types of
material that only

00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:06.450
naturally occur as crystal.

00:36:06.450 --> 00:36:10.150
So iron pyrite, calcite,
and quartz.

00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:12.960
And, I agree with him when he
wrote-- and, again, this is

00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:14.640
early June, 1914--

00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:17.450
"we are scarcely guilty of
over-statement if we say that

00:36:17.450 --> 00:36:19.356
Laue's experiment"--
and it was good of

00:36:19.356 --> 00:36:20.340
him to credit Laue--

00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:23.480
"has led to the development of
a new science." And I think

00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:26.570
that's absolutely true.

00:36:26.570 --> 00:36:29.640
Now, until that point, they
had only been looking at

00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:33.700
relatively simple structures
of types of matter that

00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:37.270
naturally occur as crystals,
such as the beautiful crystal

00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:41.060
of rock salt that
we have here.

00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:43.420
And, they had been largely
relying simply on measuring

00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:46.690
the positions of the spots in
the diffraction pattern, in

00:36:46.690 --> 00:36:51.810
order to, then, solve the puzzle
of how to work out the

00:36:51.810 --> 00:36:53.220
internal structure.

00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:54.390
But again, early on--

00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:56.420
1915, this is--

00:36:56.420 --> 00:37:00.040
William Bragg give a lecture
at the Royal Society and

00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:04.220
identified the opportunities
for advancing the technique

00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:07.350
for improving it and applying
it to more complicated

00:37:07.350 --> 00:37:08.300
structures.

00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:10.240
So, in this simple case,
we'd be considering--

00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:12.180
the consideration of the
crystal symmetry--

00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:14.160
though unable themselves to
determine the crystal

00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:17.260
structure, comes so near to
doing so that a few plain

00:37:17.260 --> 00:37:18.910
hints given by the
new methods--

00:37:18.910 --> 00:37:21.052
that is, the positions
of the spot in

00:37:21.052 --> 00:37:22.430
the diffraction pattern--

00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:25.060
have been sufficient for the
completion of the task.

00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:26.910
The exact positions of the atoms
are then known, so they

00:37:26.910 --> 00:37:28.090
could work it out.

00:37:28.090 --> 00:37:31.950
This is not the case with more
complicated crystals, and he

00:37:31.950 --> 00:37:33.830
realised that a more
sophisticated

00:37:33.830 --> 00:37:35.390
mathematical approach--

00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:38.610
he realised, even early in 1915,
that Fourier methods

00:37:38.610 --> 00:37:41.690
needed to be applied in order
to bring in the information

00:37:41.690 --> 00:37:44.700
that was in the intensities of
the spots in the diffraction

00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:47.190
pattern, so that they could
start to analyse more

00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:48.770
complicated things.

00:37:48.770 --> 00:37:50.910
Now, I'm not going to go through
Fourier Theory with

00:37:50.910 --> 00:37:53.900
you here, tonight, in gory
detail, but I do want to give

00:37:53.900 --> 00:37:56.310
you a type of graphical
explanation for it.

00:37:56.310 --> 00:37:59.430
So, let's think about a more
complicated molecule.

00:37:59.430 --> 00:38:01.380
So, this is a complicated
molecule.

00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:04.310
I hope you'll agree it's a
little bit more complicated

00:38:04.310 --> 00:38:05.550
than the two atoms of
sodium chloride.

00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:06.730
This is in fact a protein--

00:38:06.730 --> 00:38:09.370
doesn't really matter and what
it is-- but you can see that

00:38:09.370 --> 00:38:12.520
it's a complex set
of bonded atoms.

00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:15.570
And what I'm showing here,
in this blue mesh, is the

00:38:15.570 --> 00:38:16.300
electron density.

00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:18.900
So we see exactly where
the electrons are.

00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:21.330
So, this is a representation.

00:38:21.330 --> 00:38:24.640
So, let's think about how
x-rays interact with a

00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:27.200
molecule like this.

00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:29.660
So, an x-ray comes in
from the side--

00:38:29.660 --> 00:38:31.270
and here it comes--

00:38:31.270 --> 00:38:34.600
and, as we saw before with the
electron and with a single

00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:38.690
atom, the x-ray illuminates the
whole of the molecule, and

00:38:38.690 --> 00:38:42.620
we get scattering in every
direction from every part of

00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:43.555
the molecule.

00:38:43.555 --> 00:38:44.280
OK?

00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:46.830
And what you'll notice here is
that some of these scattered

00:38:46.830 --> 00:38:49.310
rays are beefier than others.

00:38:49.310 --> 00:38:51.950
So, this is quite a strong one,
and it's coming off in

00:38:51.950 --> 00:38:52.800
this particular direction.

00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:54.660
We have quite a strong
oscillation here.

00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:58.190
Whereas is this one is quite
weedy, and what that means is

00:38:58.190 --> 00:39:01.060
that this is scattering from a
point where there's quite high

00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:03.230
electron density-- strong
electron density--

00:39:03.230 --> 00:39:05.640
whereas here is a part of the
structure which has weak

00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:07.200
electron density.

00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:08.990
So, although the scattering is
a bit of a mess because it's

00:39:08.990 --> 00:39:11.750
in all directions, what each
scattering is doing-- it's

00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:14.980
carrying off a little bit of
information about the electron

00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:18.660
density at the point where
it was scattered from.

00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:21.610
Now, we can't do mathematical
analysis on things like this.

00:39:21.610 --> 00:39:23.220
We like to break down
the problem and

00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:24.780
take it step by step.

00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:27.570
So, let's simplify it, now, just
by considering all the

00:39:27.570 --> 00:39:30.510
scattered rays in one particular
direction.

00:39:30.510 --> 00:39:32.640
There will be thousands of
them--I have only had

00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:35.020
time to draw four.

00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:38.430
So, again, the amplitude--

00:39:38.430 --> 00:39:40.610
so, the size of the
oscillation-- varies according

00:39:40.610 --> 00:39:44.870
to position, and that will vary
in different positions r,

00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:48.370
indicated by a vector
in the structure.

00:39:48.370 --> 00:39:52.320
Now, each of these waves is
heading off in a particular

00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:54.660
direction and can be represented
mathematically by

00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:55.155
this function.

00:39:55.155 --> 00:39:57.100
Now, this function looks
horrendous OK,

00:39:57.100 --> 00:39:58.730
I agree with you.

00:39:58.730 --> 00:40:02.010
But, it's actually not
very difficult.

00:40:02.010 --> 00:40:05.910
So, as we said, the amplitude
depends on the electron

00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:08.120
density, and this function
here-- rho of r--

00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:11.190
tells you, what is the electron
density at position r

00:40:11.190 --> 00:40:12.520
in the molecule.

00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:13.940
So, that's a measure of
the electron density.

00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:15.340
If that's big-- that number--

00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:17.030
then you'll get a
big amplitude.

00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:21.020
And this dxdydz is just the
little volume of electron

00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:23.780
density that we have
at this point.

00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:25.900
This exponential function looks
a bit odd, but that's

00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:29.050
just encoding the fact
that this is a wave--

00:40:29.050 --> 00:40:30.780
it tells us about
the wavelength.

00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:34.600
It also depends on s, which is a
number that just varies with

00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:36.930
the angle at which we
are thinking about.

00:40:36.930 --> 00:40:38.540
So, we're just thinking
arbitrarily about this one

00:40:38.540 --> 00:40:41.930
angle, but we generate the
mathematical methods just for

00:40:41.930 --> 00:40:43.630
that direction.

00:40:43.630 --> 00:40:46.660
But it also tells us about the
phase, and the phase of the

00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:48.570
wave depends on r.

00:40:48.570 --> 00:40:51.240
And so, the phase has got
information about the position

00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:54.220
of the electrons doing the
scattering, as well.

00:40:54.220 --> 00:40:57.020
And the phase is simply, where
is the position of the first

00:40:57.020 --> 00:41:00.850
peak relative to some
arbitrary origin.

00:41:00.850 --> 00:41:03.840
So, to calculate the total
scattering in this direction,

00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:05.810
we have to add these up.

00:41:05.810 --> 00:41:08.390
And when we do addition of funny
terms like this, we have

00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:09.070
to integrate--

00:41:09.070 --> 00:41:10.480
so again, it looks horrible--

00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:12.850
but all we're doing is just
adding up the waves.

00:41:12.850 --> 00:41:13.620
OK?

00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:16.240
And when we add up the waves,
we get one particular wave

00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:17.110
that travels in that
direction.

00:41:17.110 --> 00:41:20.070
And we can think about the whole
contribution from the

00:41:20.070 --> 00:41:23.320
whole molecule emerging from
some arbitrarily chosen point

00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:25.870
in the middle, and then
we have a wave--

00:41:25.870 --> 00:41:29.470
which we describe is this
function, f of S. But this is

00:41:29.470 --> 00:41:30.350
just an expression.

00:41:30.350 --> 00:41:32.790
This means, a wave scattered
in the direction associated

00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:35.660
with f, which we also
know as theta.

00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:36.650
So, that's all the addition.

00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:38.150
So, that's that particular
direction, but

00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:39.360
we would also then--

00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:42.000
to calculate, we could sum up,
then think about, all the

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.820
waves scattered by
all parts of the

00:41:43.820 --> 00:41:46.060
molecule in another direction.

00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:48.030
But, of course, we've got to
think about all possible

00:41:48.030 --> 00:41:50.970
directions because that will
give us the most possible

00:41:50.970 --> 00:41:52.520
information.

00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:55.260
So, if we then were to, sort of,
turn the detector around

00:41:55.260 --> 00:41:59.090
to face us and see what happens,
then you would-- you

00:41:59.090 --> 00:42:01.760
might-- get something that
looked a bit like this.

00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:03.645
So this doesn't look
very regular.

00:42:03.645 --> 00:42:05.300
It looks a bit messy.

00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:08.165
But there's a pattern of, sort
of, dark and light areas.

00:42:08.165 --> 00:42:10.820
We've got strong scattering
here, medium strength

00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:13.330
scattering here, quite weak
scattering here, quite weak

00:42:13.330 --> 00:42:14.400
scattering there.

00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:17.020
But this is a very definite
pattern, and this is the

00:42:17.020 --> 00:42:19.870
diffraction pattern-- it's just
like the optical pattern

00:42:19.870 --> 00:42:22.380
that we saw from the laser
at the beginning.

00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:24.640
And it's got information in it
about the structure of the

00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:28.650
molecule because it's the
x-rays that have come--

00:42:28.650 --> 00:42:31.520
scattered from all points within
the molecule, in its

00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:33.760
three-dimensional interior.

00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:37.020
And this mathematical formula,
that we've worked out, is

00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:39.960
actually known as the Fourier
transform, after the French

00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:43.310
mathematician Jean Baptiste
Joseph Fourier.

00:42:43.310 --> 00:42:45.220
What's interesting about Fourier
is that he lived and

00:42:45.220 --> 00:42:48.700
died before the x-ray was
even discovered, but his

00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:50.450
mathematical methods have
turned out to have very

00:42:50.450 --> 00:42:52.380
general use in physics.

00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:55.060
He won a prize from the French
Academy of Sciences, but they

00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:57.780
were a bit sniffy about it.

00:42:57.780 --> 00:43:00.460
They gave him the prize, but
they did note in the citation,

00:43:00.460 --> 00:43:02.050
"the manner at which the
author arrives at his

00:43:02.050 --> 00:43:05.390
equations is not without
difficulties, and that his

00:43:05.390 --> 00:43:07.930
analysis for integrating them
still leaves something to be

00:43:07.930 --> 00:43:13.220
desired." But there you go,
that's the French for you.

00:43:13.220 --> 00:43:18.375
Lord Kelvin, an Ulsterman, was
right on the money when he

00:43:18.375 --> 00:43:20.430
said it is "one of the most
beautiful results of modern

00:43:20.430 --> 00:43:24.350
analysis." Now, the beauty of
Fourier's analysis when it's

00:43:24.350 --> 00:43:26.800
applied to x-ray crystallography
is that we can

00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:29.400
work out what the scattering
should look like from the

00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:31.650
electron density, but if you
can calculate the Fourier

00:43:31.650 --> 00:43:35.100
transform mathematically, you
can actually then, also,

00:43:35.100 --> 00:43:37.430
simply do the inverse
Fourier transform.

00:43:37.430 --> 00:43:39.420
So, we have, basically,
rearranged the equation.

00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:40.900
You're allowed to do this,
according to the

00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:41.930
mathematicians.

00:43:41.930 --> 00:43:45.690
So, if you measure all the
scattering, you can work out

00:43:45.690 --> 00:43:47.930
from the maths what the
electron density is.

00:43:47.930 --> 00:43:50.730
And this is basically a
mathematical description of

00:43:50.730 --> 00:43:52.520
the shape of the molecule.

00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:55.260
And so, this is entire
mathematical basis of x-ray

00:43:55.260 --> 00:43:58.040
crystallography that we
use, and still use,

00:43:58.040 --> 00:43:59.490
in the modern era.

00:43:59.490 --> 00:44:01.590
It's just the maths is
all now done inside a

00:44:01.590 --> 00:44:02.840
computer, thank goodness.

00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:05.370
 

00:44:05.370 --> 00:44:08.120
This mathematical technique
would allow us to work out the

00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:09.960
structure of a single
molecule.

00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:12.830
However, we cannot work
with single molecules.

00:44:12.830 --> 00:44:16.370
They are really small, so
they're very hard to pick up.

00:44:16.370 --> 00:44:18.990
And even if you could pick it
up and put in an x-ray beam,

00:44:18.990 --> 00:44:22.140
it was scatter so few photons--
so few x-rays--

00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:24.160
that you wouldn't be
able to measure it.

00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:27.880
So, the trick to get around that
is to try and crystallise

00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:29.570
your molecule.

00:44:29.570 --> 00:44:34.790
And so, you take your protein,
or whatever compound you're

00:44:34.790 --> 00:44:36.890
interested in analysing,
and you try to grow

00:44:36.890 --> 00:44:38.060
a crystal of it.

00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:41.030
It may not occur naturally,
but chemistry has shown us

00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:43.820
that the final purification step
is often crystallisation.

00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:46.510
So many compounds can
crystallise, and we now know

00:44:46.510 --> 00:44:49.960
that even many proteins can
crystallise, as well.

00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:53.260
And so, if you get a crystal,
you'll see that it behaves

00:44:53.260 --> 00:44:57.430
exactly like a crystal of sodium
chloride, or of salt.

00:44:57.430 --> 00:44:59.950
All you have is a regular ray--
not of atoms this time,

00:44:59.950 --> 00:45:01.110
but of molecules.

00:45:01.110 --> 00:45:04.400
But you can identify planes,
just in the same way as we did

00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:06.330
for sodium chloride
in zinc blende.

00:45:06.330 --> 00:45:09.960
And so Bragg's Law still
applies, and so there are only

00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:12.340
certain directions in which
you will get diffraction.

00:45:12.340 --> 00:45:17.265
But, at least, as we saw with
the slits when we put in six

00:45:17.265 --> 00:45:20.170
slits rather than two, we got
much brighter diffraction

00:45:20.170 --> 00:45:21.850
because we were allowing
more light through.

00:45:21.850 --> 00:45:26.070
And so, the crystal basically
gives us an amplified signal

00:45:26.070 --> 00:45:28.080
that we can interpret.

00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:30.940
So, I wonder, now, can we have
a look and see how our

00:45:30.940 --> 00:45:34.110
crystals of lysozyme
are doing?

00:45:34.110 --> 00:45:38.570
By the magic of-- oh, and
it looks quite nice.

00:45:38.570 --> 00:45:42.240
So, this was a clear drop
earlier, but you can see,

00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:44.750
here, there's a sort of
grittiness to it.

00:45:44.750 --> 00:45:47.990
But this looks like a whole
cluster of little jewels.

00:45:47.990 --> 00:45:50.110
And so, these are crystals
of lysozyme--

00:45:50.110 --> 00:45:51.210
a protein--

00:45:51.210 --> 00:45:53.765
that have grown in the last
20 minutes, or so,

00:45:53.765 --> 00:45:55.560
that I've been talking.

00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:56.980
They're a little bit small.

00:45:56.980 --> 00:46:00.270
But, by modern standards,
they're perfectly adequate,

00:46:00.270 --> 00:46:04.420
perfectly serviceable for
doing x-ray diffraction.

00:46:04.420 --> 00:46:07.020
So, as long as you can
crystallise it, you can solve

00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:08.800
the structure of it.

00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:10.700
And that was what the
Bragg's realised,

00:46:10.700 --> 00:46:13.160
back as early as 1915.

00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:18.050
So, the application of the
Fourier methods allowed

00:46:18.050 --> 00:46:18.810
crystallographers--

00:46:18.810 --> 00:46:20.410
allowed the Bragg's,
initially--

00:46:20.410 --> 00:46:23.320
to use the positional
information, and the fact that

00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:25.700
the intensity of the spots
varied in different

00:46:25.700 --> 00:46:28.460
directions, in order
to calculate the

00:46:28.460 --> 00:46:29.410
electron density map.

00:46:29.410 --> 00:46:32.140
So, they applied Fourier
methods, and this is one of

00:46:32.140 --> 00:46:34.290
the very first, published
by Lawrence Bragg.

00:46:34.290 --> 00:46:37.160
This is from 1929,
from diopside--

00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:40.280
still a fairly simple structure,
but much more

00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:42.600
complicated than sodium
chloride.

00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:44.390
And so, this is a section
through the

00:46:44.390 --> 00:46:45.030
electron density map.

00:46:45.030 --> 00:46:46.290
You can see the contours.

00:46:46.290 --> 00:46:48.380
So, here's strong electron
density here.

00:46:48.380 --> 00:46:49.770
This is kind of medium.

00:46:49.770 --> 00:46:53.750
And here is the structure that
Bragg built into that electron

00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:57.160
density map and solved
for diopside.

00:46:57.160 --> 00:47:00.410
And so, through the '20s and
'30s they showed that they

00:47:00.410 --> 00:47:02.480
could apply the technique
to more and

00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:04.350
more complex molecules.

00:47:04.350 --> 00:47:08.170
And the chemists didn't all
listen to Armstrong.

00:47:08.170 --> 00:47:11.010
And this is beautiful work done
by one of Britain's, sort

00:47:11.010 --> 00:47:14.520
of, most celebrated female
scientist, Dorothy Hodgkin--

00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:16.950
or Crowfoot, as she was
before her marriage.

00:47:16.950 --> 00:47:19.660
This is the structure of
penicillin that was solved

00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:22.790
during World War II and
published shortly afterwards.

00:47:22.790 --> 00:47:26.580
And this, she published in the
late 1950s, is the structure

00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:27.650
of vitamin B12--

00:47:27.650 --> 00:47:29.340
a massive molecule.

00:47:29.340 --> 00:47:31.310
And it was the biggest molecule
to have been solved

00:47:31.310 --> 00:47:31.980
at that time.

00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:35.410
So, a single molecule
has over 100 atoms.

00:47:35.410 --> 00:47:38.430
And so, the technique moved
on in power, thanks to the

00:47:38.430 --> 00:47:41.520
application of the Fourier
method, which had been

00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:43.210
pioneered by the Bragg's.

00:47:43.210 --> 00:47:45.110
And crystallography
is now, simply, an

00:47:45.110 --> 00:47:47.010
embedded part of chemistry.

00:47:47.010 --> 00:47:49.670
So, as well as telling us about
material science, it's

00:47:49.670 --> 00:47:53.350
now a regular routine
tool of chemistry.

00:47:53.350 --> 00:47:56.390
The database has over half a
million crystal structures in

00:47:56.390 --> 00:48:02.060
it, and 40,000 new structures
are added every single year.

00:48:02.060 --> 00:48:04.220
So much for chemistry, which
isn't really my subject.

00:48:04.220 --> 00:48:06.470
What about biology?

00:48:06.470 --> 00:48:09.910
So, again, this started
relatively early-- so it was

00:48:09.910 --> 00:48:12.460
in the '20s and '30s that people
started to think about

00:48:12.460 --> 00:48:14.730
how you could apply x-ray
methods to look

00:48:14.730 --> 00:48:16.260
at biological problems.

00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:19.290
Biological proteins are much
bigger, in general, and so

00:48:19.290 --> 00:48:21.380
it's much more challenging
and demanding.

00:48:21.380 --> 00:48:26.100
But again, Bragg-- father and
son, actually, were both very

00:48:26.100 --> 00:48:28.680
instrumental in inspiring
and guiding people to

00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:30.160
tackle these problems.

00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:32.100
One of the first to get involved
was a chap called

00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:35.030
Bill Astbury, who worked here
at the Royal Institution as

00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:37.590
part of William Bragg's
group in the '20s and

00:48:37.590 --> 00:48:39.020
then moved to Leeds.

00:48:39.020 --> 00:48:41.690
And here we see the work of one
of his Ph.D. Students from

00:48:41.690 --> 00:48:45.030
1937 or '38, Florence Bell.

00:48:45.030 --> 00:48:47.900
And this is actually one
of the very first x-ray

00:48:47.900 --> 00:48:51.440
diffraction patterns of
DNA-- of nucleic acid.

00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:54.420
Now, you don't have a pattern
of spots because this is not

00:48:54.420 --> 00:48:56.930
exactly a crystal that they're
analysing here.

00:48:56.930 --> 00:48:58.040
This is a fibre.

00:48:58.040 --> 00:49:00.420
But DNA has a very regular
structure so it is

00:49:00.420 --> 00:49:02.010
crystal-like.

00:49:02.010 --> 00:49:04.530
And you can see, even in
this early pattern--

00:49:04.530 --> 00:49:05.950
this is 1938--

00:49:05.950 --> 00:49:09.500
the typical, sort of, X pattern
that is characteristic

00:49:09.500 --> 00:49:12.340
of the double helix that was
eventually to emerge.

00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:16.230
Now, the whole story of the work
on the structure of DNA

00:49:16.230 --> 00:49:20.610
in itself is convoluted and
tortuous, and deserves a whole

00:49:20.610 --> 00:49:21.910
lecture in itself.

00:49:21.910 --> 00:49:27.250
What I want to focus on tonight
is the crystal side of

00:49:27.250 --> 00:49:28.760
biological crystallography.

00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:32.280
And that was kind of kicked off
by this chap, J.D. Bernal,

00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:36.720
an Irishman from Tipperary,
who worked--

00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:38.000
one of his first students
was Dorothy

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:40.100
Hodgkin, or Dorothy Crowfoot.

00:49:40.100 --> 00:49:41.850
And Bernal-- he started
off as a theorist.

00:49:41.850 --> 00:49:43.510
He wasn't very good with
this hands, initially.

00:49:43.510 --> 00:49:46.260
But under William Bragg's
tutelage, here at the Royal

00:49:46.260 --> 00:49:49.890
Institution, he eventually
mastered the technique and

00:49:49.890 --> 00:49:52.430
became a crystallographer
of some renown.

00:49:52.430 --> 00:49:54.170
And so, people would just
send him crystals.

00:49:54.170 --> 00:49:57.650
And so, a friend of his was
travelling in Sweden in

00:49:57.650 --> 00:49:58.980
Svedberg's lab.

00:49:58.980 --> 00:50:02.370
They had accidentally grown
crystals of pepsin, and their

00:50:02.370 --> 00:50:05.520
friend said, I know someone who
would give his eyes for

00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:06.250
those crystals.

00:50:06.250 --> 00:50:07.900
And so, he was allowed
to take them away--

00:50:07.900 --> 00:50:11.130
carried them in his coat
pocket back to London--

00:50:11.130 --> 00:50:15.250
or, sorry, back to Cambridge,
where Bernal was

00:50:15.250 --> 00:50:16.290
working at the time.

00:50:16.290 --> 00:50:19.070
And they put them into the beam,
and they produced the

00:50:19.070 --> 00:50:21.920
very first x-ray diffraction
pattern

00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:23.240
from a protein crystal.

00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:26.970
It must have been
quite a moment.

00:50:26.970 --> 00:50:31.270
Unfortunately, the photograph
that they took is lost.

00:50:31.270 --> 00:50:36.260
It was probably destroyed in
a bomb during World War II.

00:50:36.260 --> 00:50:39.520
However, it probably looked
something like this.

00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:42.230
So, this is a diffraction
pattern from a crystal of

00:50:42.230 --> 00:50:46.040
haemoglobin, which was taken by
Max Perutz who was also a

00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:49.240
student of Bernal's, just
a few years later.

00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:51.820
But, you see a fairly
similar--

00:50:51.820 --> 00:50:53.760
must have been very similar to
the pattern from pepsin.

00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:57.270
And you can see many,
many spots in here--

00:50:57.270 --> 00:50:58.550
you get many more spots
because the

00:50:58.550 --> 00:51:00.502
molecules are much bigger.

00:51:00.502 --> 00:51:03.580
Now, at that point, they
couldn't really analyse the

00:51:03.580 --> 00:51:03.990
structure--

00:51:03.990 --> 00:51:05.540
they couldn't work it out
because it was too

00:51:05.540 --> 00:51:05.800
complicated.

00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:07.560
It was even beyond the
Fourier methods that

00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:08.980
they had at the time.

00:51:08.980 --> 00:51:09.880
But they realised--

00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:13.390
and this is 1934 that it was
initially published by

00:51:13.390 --> 00:51:18.045
Crowfoot and Bernal, so Dorothy
and-- well, Sage, as

00:51:18.045 --> 00:51:21.210
he was known, because he was
such an intelligent and

00:51:21.210 --> 00:51:22.290
well-read person.

00:51:22.290 --> 00:51:25.150
Everybody called him Sage.

00:51:25.150 --> 00:51:28.390
And there was two things they
realised from this.

00:51:28.390 --> 00:51:32.950
One was that, because they had
regular diffraction, it meant

00:51:32.950 --> 00:51:36.570
that the protein molecule is of
a perfectly definite kind.

00:51:36.570 --> 00:51:39.230
That meant that the
protein molecule

00:51:39.230 --> 00:51:40.990
had a definite structure.

00:51:40.990 --> 00:51:43.380
Before that, until that point,
there had been a lot of debate

00:51:43.380 --> 00:51:44.700
on this point.

00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:47.930
It was thought that it was like
a colloid-- a rather,

00:51:47.930 --> 00:51:50.380
sort of, loose association
of peptides.

00:51:50.380 --> 00:51:53.110
But here they showed, because
it diffracts, then it is a

00:51:53.110 --> 00:51:54.010
definite structure.

00:51:54.010 --> 00:51:56.910
And they further realised that
they now had, through this

00:51:56.910 --> 00:52:01.370
x-ray method, the means of
really getting to grips with

00:52:01.370 --> 00:52:05.300
what proteins looked like
and what they could do.

00:52:05.300 --> 00:52:08.770
And, although it was going to
take quite some time before

00:52:08.770 --> 00:52:13.535
they could realise this, they
knew-- and certainly, Astbury

00:52:13.535 --> 00:52:15.520
and Bernal knew--

00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:17.795
that they were on the cusp of, I
think, a major breakthrough.

00:52:17.795 --> 00:52:20.600
And there's a very nice
quotation in a letter from

00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:21.420
Astbury to Bernal--

00:52:21.420 --> 00:52:23.100
they wear pals--

00:52:23.100 --> 00:52:26.240
where Astbury says, "If you
and I do not make the most

00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:29.030
biological crystallography, we
should have our respective

00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:31.900
bottoms kicked."

00:52:31.900 --> 00:52:33.860
While I don't think they deserve
to have their bottoms

00:52:33.860 --> 00:52:36.170
kicked, they are, unfortunately,
not as

00:52:36.170 --> 00:52:40.670
well-known in the scientific
world as they deserve to be.

00:52:40.670 --> 00:52:41.975
Their names are well-known
inside the

00:52:41.975 --> 00:52:43.460
crystallographic community.

00:52:43.460 --> 00:52:46.020
That's partly, I think,
because they didn't,

00:52:46.020 --> 00:52:48.620
themselves, solve any
landmark structures.

00:52:48.620 --> 00:52:52.090
But they both did early work and
inspired other people to

00:52:52.090 --> 00:52:54.980
go on to work on structures
that were, themselves,

00:52:54.980 --> 00:52:56.100
landmark achievements.

00:52:56.100 --> 00:52:59.530
Astbury's initial work helped to
inspire Maurice Wilkins to

00:52:59.530 --> 00:53:02.380
get involved in analysing DNA,
and Wilkins was very

00:53:02.380 --> 00:53:05.880
instrumental in pursuing the
project to fruition.

00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:06.510
Bernal--

00:53:06.510 --> 00:53:11.320
he had mentored Hodgkin and,
also, people like Max Perutz.

00:53:11.320 --> 00:53:15.510
But it took until 1959 before
the very first protein

00:53:15.510 --> 00:53:19.490
structure was solved, and what
a moment that must've been,

00:53:19.490 --> 00:53:22.200
when this model appeared.

00:53:22.200 --> 00:53:25.255
I won't offend the sensibilities
of the find,

00:53:25.255 --> 00:53:27.580
ladies and gentlemen of London,
by telling you what I

00:53:27.580 --> 00:53:29.490
think it looks like this.

00:53:29.490 --> 00:53:33.910
But, the disappointment in
Perutz's voice is palpable--

00:53:33.910 --> 00:53:37.440
"Could the search for ultimate
truth really have revealed so

00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:39.890
hideous and visceral
an object?"

00:53:39.890 --> 00:53:42.120
Part of the disappointment was
because the crystals they

00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:44.710
initially had weren't very good,
and they didn't scatter

00:53:44.710 --> 00:53:45.310
to high angle.

00:53:45.310 --> 00:53:47.360
And so, that limited the
information that they could

00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:50.310
get, and so the model really
just shows the fold of the

00:53:50.310 --> 00:53:51.960
polypeptide chain--

00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:53.630
that reveals the structure.

00:53:53.630 --> 00:53:56.120
But you don't really get any
biological insight from a

00:53:56.120 --> 00:53:57.550
model like this.

00:53:57.550 --> 00:54:00.210
And it certainly-- this came six
years after the structure

00:54:00.210 --> 00:54:02.455
of DNA had been solved--

00:54:02.455 --> 00:54:05.270
well actually, DNA had been
solved on the basis of much

00:54:05.270 --> 00:54:09.100
sparser information, but it
produced this beautiful,

00:54:09.100 --> 00:54:10.740
double-helical molecule.

00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:14.090
It was just elegant in its
simplicity, and it immediately

00:54:14.090 --> 00:54:17.090
suggested the mechanism for
how genetic information is

00:54:17.090 --> 00:54:20.340
transmitted from copy to copy.

00:54:20.340 --> 00:54:23.910
However, within a couple of
years, the crystals improved

00:54:23.910 --> 00:54:25.740
and their analysis improved.

00:54:25.740 --> 00:54:28.620
And soon, they had a model of
the protein structure that

00:54:28.620 --> 00:54:31.420
really did have all the atoms in
it and was starting to give

00:54:31.420 --> 00:54:34.630
us real biological and
mechanistic insights.

00:54:34.630 --> 00:54:35.780
So, this is myoglobin.

00:54:35.780 --> 00:54:38.860
This is a protein that comes
from a sperm whale.

00:54:38.860 --> 00:54:41.590
It is an oxygen storage
molecule, and so it is the

00:54:41.590 --> 00:54:44.660
molecule in the muscles of the
sperm whale that allows this

00:54:44.660 --> 00:54:50.100
incredible beast to hold its
breath for a very long time.

00:54:50.100 --> 00:54:52.015
So, the initial myoglobin
structure was

00:54:52.015 --> 00:54:53.190
solved by John Kendrew--

00:54:53.190 --> 00:54:56.020
that was done in the Cavendish
lab at Cambridge, again, under

00:54:56.020 --> 00:54:58.540
the watchful eye of Lawrence
Bragg, who was director of it

00:54:58.540 --> 00:54:59.690
at the time.

00:54:59.690 --> 00:55:02.530
And Perutz himself, working in
the same lab, produced the

00:55:02.530 --> 00:55:05.750
structure of haemoglobin a few
years later-- this is in the

00:55:05.750 --> 00:55:07.190
early '60s.

00:55:07.190 --> 00:55:09.870
And this is a protein
that's found in the

00:55:09.870 --> 00:55:10.930
blood of all mammals.

00:55:10.930 --> 00:55:14.150
It's the oxygen transporter, so
it carries oxygen in your

00:55:14.150 --> 00:55:17.510
blood from the lungs, all the
way through your tissues, and

00:55:17.510 --> 00:55:18.810
back into the lungs.

00:55:18.810 --> 00:55:21.520
And immediately this was just
the second molecule structure

00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:22.540
to be solved--

00:55:22.540 --> 00:55:24.750
but what was remarkable about
this was that when they

00:55:24.750 --> 00:55:27.110
overlaid the structure of
myoglobin on it, they saw that

00:55:27.110 --> 00:55:31.600
it was almost the same as one of
the chains of haemoglobin.

00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:34.950
And myoglobin from a sperm
whale-- the haemoglobin here

00:55:34.950 --> 00:55:36.600
was from a horse--

00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:39.640
but, it showed an evolutionary
connection.

00:55:39.640 --> 00:55:42.930
And this was the first time that
people had seen evolution

00:55:42.930 --> 00:55:46.330
working at a structural level,
at a molecular level.

00:55:46.330 --> 00:55:48.880
And this is a type of insight
that we get from structural

00:55:48.880 --> 00:55:50.350
biology all the time now.

00:55:50.350 --> 00:55:53.340
Previously, it had really just
been looking at morphological

00:55:53.340 --> 00:55:56.210
similarities in the external
appearance of different

00:55:56.210 --> 00:55:59.590
animals, and different species
of plants, and so on.

00:55:59.590 --> 00:56:01.690
Now, we can look at and
study evolution at

00:56:01.690 --> 00:56:02.490
the molecular level.

00:56:02.490 --> 00:56:05.330
So, this is another benefit
of the technique of

00:56:05.330 --> 00:56:08.000
crystallography.

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:12.770
So, a later structure, lysozyme,
was solved here, in

00:56:12.770 --> 00:56:14.880
the Royal Institution,
in a group

00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:17.000
involving David Phillips.

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:19.150
And again, this was
now the time when

00:56:19.150 --> 00:56:20.740
Lawrence Bragg was director.

00:56:20.740 --> 00:56:24.160
And this sketch of the protein
molecule is actually done by

00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:25.680
Lawrence's own hand--

00:56:25.680 --> 00:56:28.380
he was quite a talented
artist.

00:56:28.380 --> 00:56:31.310
And what a pleasure it must
have been for him--

00:56:31.310 --> 00:56:34.301
and this is 1965,
thereabouts--

00:56:34.301 --> 00:56:37.250
50 years after he and his father
had first, sort of,

00:56:37.250 --> 00:56:39.920
worked on this technique and
solved the structure of just

00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:43.000
two atoms, here was the
structure of lysozyme.

00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:44.630
This is an enzyme.

00:56:44.630 --> 00:56:46.690
This one is from chicken eggs--
it actually helps the

00:56:46.690 --> 00:56:49.420
chicken egg to fight off
bacteria because it chews up

00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:51.010
the bacterial cell wall.

00:56:51.010 --> 00:56:53.130
This is a modern representation
of it, and we

00:56:53.130 --> 00:56:55.660
can now see, in atomic
detail--

00:56:55.660 --> 00:56:59.500
the orange molecule is a small
segment that looks like a

00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:01.890
bacterial cell wall-- and so,
we can see how the enzyme

00:57:01.890 --> 00:57:06.750
works-- how it catalyses pulling
apart this molecule.

00:57:06.750 --> 00:57:11.630
So, crystallography gives
us incredible molecular,

00:57:11.630 --> 00:57:15.760
atomic-level insights into
the workings of biology.

00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:18.350
And it has just gone from
strength to strength.

00:57:18.350 --> 00:57:21.570
That result was from
the 1960s.

00:57:21.570 --> 00:57:25.090
These days, we have much
better kit, but we're

00:57:25.090 --> 00:57:26.510
basically doing the
same thing.

00:57:26.510 --> 00:57:29.540
We are still growing crystals,
we are still collecting x-ray

00:57:29.540 --> 00:57:32.290
diffraction patterns, and we are
still solving structures.

00:57:32.290 --> 00:57:33.540
The kit's a bit better.

00:57:33.540 --> 00:57:35.830
So rather than a Crookes tube,
which is what the Bragg's

00:57:35.830 --> 00:57:38.840
started out with, we've
got one of these.

00:57:38.840 --> 00:57:39.795
This is a particle
accelerator.

00:57:39.795 --> 00:57:43.380
It nestles in the Oxfordshire
countryside near Didcot.

00:57:43.380 --> 00:57:44.580
This is the diamond
light source.

00:57:44.580 --> 00:57:47.280
It is the most expensive
scientific facility that

00:57:47.280 --> 00:57:49.740
Britain has built in the last
10 or 20 years, and it is

00:57:49.740 --> 00:57:52.220
something that we should
be very proud of.

00:57:52.220 --> 00:57:54.930
It's an excellent, world-class
facility.

00:57:54.930 --> 00:57:57.670
So now, we just grow our
crystals, and we take them to

00:57:57.670 --> 00:58:00.050
diamond, and we fire
x-rays at them.

00:58:00.050 --> 00:58:03.060
And instead of the, sort of,
early patterns, like

00:58:03.060 --> 00:58:04.920
haemoglobin, this is now a

00:58:04.920 --> 00:58:06.770
modern-day diffraction pattern.

00:58:06.770 --> 00:58:10.130
And as we illuminate the
crystal, we can rotate it.

00:58:10.130 --> 00:58:13.060
And instead of collecting data
on photographs, we now have

00:58:13.060 --> 00:58:15.990
electronic detectors that
capture the diffraction almost

00:58:15.990 --> 00:58:17.280
in real time.

00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:19.930
And, from all of these different
images, we can then

00:58:19.930 --> 00:58:22.806
work out structure
after structure.

00:58:22.806 --> 00:58:25.470
And so, the technique
really has matured,

00:58:25.470 --> 00:58:28.080
really has grown up.

00:58:28.080 --> 00:58:31.860
From sodium chloride, which was
just two atoms in 1912,

00:58:31.860 --> 00:58:34.400
1913, to lysozyme--

00:58:34.400 --> 00:58:37.400
which is probably a couple of
thousand atoms-- in the '60s.

00:58:37.400 --> 00:58:38.765
We now have structures
like this.

00:58:38.765 --> 00:58:41.220
This is actually a sodium
potassium ATPase.

00:58:41.220 --> 00:58:42.150
So, this is --.

00:58:42.150 --> 00:58:43.050
This is salt.

00:58:43.050 --> 00:58:44.740
And this is a molecule--

00:58:44.740 --> 00:58:45.770
a transporter--

00:58:45.770 --> 00:58:48.380
that sits in your cell membranes
and regulates the

00:58:48.380 --> 00:58:51.520
influx and efflux of the sodium
and potassium ions to

00:58:51.520 --> 00:58:53.520
maintain a healthy salt balance

00:58:53.520 --> 00:58:55.200
within the living cell.

00:58:55.200 --> 00:58:57.460
So, this is a gigantic
structure.

00:58:57.460 --> 00:59:02.463
However, it's not very
big compared to this.

00:59:02.463 --> 00:59:06.170
Now, this is the ribosome.

00:59:06.170 --> 00:59:09.960
Now, the ribosome
is a monster.

00:59:09.960 --> 00:59:12.700
So, this is the ribosome
from a yeast, which is

00:59:12.700 --> 00:59:14.080
a eukaryotic cell.

00:59:14.080 --> 00:59:16.810
It's a sophisticated type of
cell, which has the same type

00:59:16.810 --> 00:59:17.870
of organism that we are.

00:59:17.870 --> 00:59:20.440
It's just we are a many-celled
organism and yeast is only a

00:59:20.440 --> 00:59:21.920
single-celled organism.

00:59:21.920 --> 00:59:24.980
But, this is a truly
gigantic structure.

00:59:24.980 --> 00:59:27.500
Bragg's first structure
had two atoms.

00:59:27.500 --> 00:59:35.390
The ribosome has 404,714 atoms
in this crystal structure.

00:59:35.390 --> 00:59:38.310
It's truly a monster.

00:59:38.310 --> 00:59:42.490
It might even be said to be
akin to the monstrosity of

00:59:42.490 --> 00:59:44.070
Hooke's flea.

00:59:44.070 --> 00:59:47.620
I wish that it would capture
the public imagination in

00:59:47.620 --> 00:59:50.390
quite the same way, but it's
worth bearing in mind that

00:59:50.390 --> 00:59:54.630
this flea contains many millions
of copies of a

00:59:54.630 --> 00:59:56.230
molecule just like this.

00:59:56.230 --> 01:00:01.280
The ribosome is an enormous and
powerful machine, which

01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:08.470
helps us to decode the genetic
code and synthesises proteins.

01:00:08.470 --> 01:00:11.470
So, from all of those
techniques, from x-ray

01:00:11.470 --> 01:00:15.740
crystallography applied to salt,
we have moved to brand

01:00:15.740 --> 01:00:17.620
new territory.

01:00:17.620 --> 01:00:23.615
And so, we are learning all the
time about life, and we

01:00:23.615 --> 01:00:27.720
are learning about it in ways
that are brand new.

01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:32.180
And so, if we now just, finally,
look at the ribosome

01:00:32.180 --> 01:00:35.240
in the wild, so to speak, you
can see where it takes its

01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:36.930
place inside the cell.

01:00:36.930 --> 01:00:38.760
And this is a beautiful
painting from a

01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:40.645
book by David Goodsell--

01:00:40.645 --> 01:00:43.740
if I show it up here to give
him the credit for it--

01:00:43.740 --> 01:00:46.170
this shows the molecular
interior of a cell.

01:00:46.170 --> 01:00:48.700
This is bringing together all
the knowledge we have about

01:00:48.700 --> 01:00:50.610
what molecules are present and
what structures they are

01:00:50.610 --> 01:00:51.500
likely to have.

01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:54.420
We haven't yet solved all these
structures, but thanks

01:00:54.420 --> 01:00:59.550
to crystallography, we very soon
will be able to do so.

01:00:59.550 --> 01:01:03.280
Finally, we are solving
structures on Earth, but

01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:05.640
crystallography has moved
beyond this planet.

01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:08.760
And on the Curiosity Rover that
NASA sent to Mars last

01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:11.890
year, there is an instrument
that does x-ray diffraction.

01:01:11.890 --> 01:01:14.810
And the robot arm can toss a
sample of soil into this

01:01:14.810 --> 01:01:17.230
device, and it can
take an x-ray

01:01:17.230 --> 01:01:19.700
diffraction pattern on Mars.

01:01:19.700 --> 01:01:23.970
And so, x-ray crystallography
has moved off-world, so to

01:01:23.970 --> 01:01:27.610
speak, and is now telling us
that the soil on Mars is a bit

01:01:27.610 --> 01:01:30.590
like Hawaii.

01:01:30.590 --> 01:01:35.120
I don't think the climate
is quite as nice.

01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:38.620
And this, again, is just a
structure from this week's

01:01:38.620 --> 01:01:40.730
Nature, published
on Wednesday--

01:01:40.730 --> 01:01:41.640
another monster.

01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:44.640
This is a polymerase that
actually makes the RNA that is

01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:46.390
used to build the ribosome.

01:01:46.390 --> 01:01:50.140
And so, we are making connection
after connection at

01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:51.600
the atomic level.

01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:54.470
So, I hope you will now agree
with me, that x-ray

01:01:54.470 --> 01:01:58.490
crystallography is one of the
most powerful methods that

01:01:58.490 --> 01:02:01.500
science has produced in the 20th
century, and has truly

01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:06.400
allowed us to see the world in
a completely different light.

01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:42.646
[APPLAUSE]
