00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.770
I'm Rachel Zuraw. I'm, live here in San Francisco. I'm an attorney

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:10.730
specializing in intellectual properties, especially pharmaceutical

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.230
and biotechnology, with a background in bio-ethics.

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.600
&gt;&gt; You know, what are the ethical issues surrounding the

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.080
use of specifically HeLa cells in the case of Henrietta's story.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.501
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:21.501 --> 00:00:25.550
&gt;&gt; But also the issue of using tissues from

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.300
people without their consent in general.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:34.600
&gt;&gt; The researchers who took the cells from Henrietta's you've already covered.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.690
You know, they were attempting There were multiple attempts to find this

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.430
immortal cell line. And, they were taking samples from anyone they could. She

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.450
was there for therapeutic treatment, when they took the cell line. And,

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.760
at the time that the cells were

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.780
harvested from Henrietta Lacks. The Nuremberg trials

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.710
of the Nazi physicians who participated in

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.830
medical experiments, well quasi medical experiment in

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.110
the concentration camps. The one of the first principles to come out of the

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.070
Nuremberg trials is that voluntary consent of

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.640
a human research subject is absolutely essential.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.670
And that's been embroidered on in United States law and ethical guidelines ever

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.430
since. The informed consent, that any individual

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.040
participating in research needs to be told

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.380
beforehand. They need to have all of the information that they are able to

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.350
understand so that they can agree or not. To participate in the research.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.760
&gt;&gt; It must be fully voluntary.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.670
&gt;&gt; It must be fully voluntary. Fully informed and

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.000
fully voluntary. You can't make a voluntary choice

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.630
to participate if you don't have all of

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.340
the information. Informed consent in the United States

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.040
in the early 1950s was still a, a

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.600
good theory. You know, everyone thought that

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.160
this, this sounded like a great idea. But

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:07.570
then you have an uneducated patient in

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.770
the hospital who doesn't understand what treatment she's

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.990
receiving, is not advocating for herself, and in the, in the context of the time

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.519
most physicians would not have paused to think

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.120
I should explain to her why I'm taking

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.770
this tissue sample. And let her know what I'm going to do with

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.810
it. Today, and we can discuss some other examples, that sort of behavior still

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.870
goes on. But it's a. Recognized by the medical establishment to be an

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.560
actual intrusion and invasion of the patient's

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.390
autonomy, of the human research subject's autonomy.

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.520
&gt;&gt; Right, now obviously things have changed since then and

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.395
&gt;&gt; Incrementally.

00:02:43.395 --> 00:02:44.385
[LAUGH]

00:02:44.385 --> 00:02:45.480
&gt;&gt; Okay, incrementally then.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.195
&gt;&gt; It's leaps and bounds, maybe not as much as we would've liked.

00:02:48.195 --> 00:02:48.789
[LAUGH]

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:50.930
&gt;&gt; Well, I want you to speak to that for a second

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.600
then. Did the Henrietta Lacks' story change anything, if not at the

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.670
time, eventually? And, if not that, were there other cases that, you

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.270
know, had a bigger impact on how we look at informed consent?

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:08.510
&gt;&gt; Well, the Henrietta Lacks' story is, you know, wasn't known for more than

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.090
40 years, so when the Immortal Life

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.150
of Henrietta Lacks was released and Rebecca Skloot

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.240
started publicizing this story, then, I think, the story has now become part of

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:24.900
a really interesting movement towards control over personal genetic information.

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.950
Which, I think we're really just seeing the beginnings of. Because

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.520
legally, there was never a recognized right of

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:39.590
ownership or control of your, well, in the past,

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.570
tissues, blood sample et cetera, before genetic information

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.380
could be extracted and used from those samples.

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:47.480
&gt;&gt; Mm hmm

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.890
&gt;&gt; But now, you know, Henrietta Lacks, you mentioned

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.790
that her descendants Are now sitting on a committee to

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.780
authorize the use of the genetic information from the Hela

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:03.820
cells. Likewise there is a really interesting decision in 2010,

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.950
regarding a small Indian tribe that lives

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.910
in the Grand Canyon, who had given blood

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.330
samples to a University of Arizona researcher for,

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.619
to be used in diabetes and schizophrenia research.

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.310
one of the members of the tribe found

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.350
out several years after these blood samples were

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.350
donated that they were being used for purposes

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.250
that the tribe members had not consented to.

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.600
The university of Arizona, of course, argued that this was

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.970
perfectly acceptable, they had the samples, they had no right of

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:42.440
ownership to the samples. However, the ultimate outcome of this case, is

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.500
the, the tribe was able to dictate that they

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:54.160
would not authorize their blood samples to be used for anything other than the

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.240
original intended purpose. And actually, all of

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.934
the samples that they donated were destroyed.

00:04:58.934 --> 00:04:59.578
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:04:59.578 --> 00:05:02.460
&gt;&gt; So I mean, these are just a couple of isolated examples.

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.960
Case by case situations. Not really setting the precedent for how we're

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.730
going to be managing genetic information that are, that is in the

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:13.160
hands of researchers. But, it's indicative

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.240
of an interesting movement towards people becoming

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:20.079
aware of and taking measures to control the use of their genetic information.
