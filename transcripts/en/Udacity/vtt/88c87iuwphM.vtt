00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.680
Carol, I'd, I'd start with you. do you have any

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:09.110
personal opinion about gene patenting, or the idea of, you

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.480
know, can a company own a gene, specifically you know,

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.138
the bracket gene has been the subject of much debate?

00:00:16.138 --> 00:00:21.320
&gt;&gt; myriad genetics was just denied the right

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.280
to patent the BRCA mutation, and I agree with

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.200
that completely.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.380
&gt;&gt; Why is that?

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:33.270
&gt;&gt; Well, I don't, I don't, I think this information should be available,

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.290
and you don't patent the gene. A treatment, or medicine, for a period

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:44.630
of time, but the gene is, is something that we have in our body.

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:50.270
You know it's part of human nature, it's our human, in your human,

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:55.540
it's part of your makeup. And I don't think that they should

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.920
be able to patent a gene. All living things have genes. Trees.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.950
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:04.330
&gt;&gt; Have cells with DNA in them. Cats, dogs, bacteria, what do

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.120
you think about patenting those genes. Do you feel similarly, or, differently.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:15.340
&gt;&gt; I mean, it would, I think, the way that the decision

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:16.980
went, so that you can't patent something that's

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.200
already naturally occurring, I think that's already, that's been

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.090
in the law for a long time. I think

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.480
when you get into the recombinate DNA technology and

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.202
Bioengineering where you're changing the genetic code of

00:01:27.202 --> 00:01:30.870
something. That, is currently allowed to be patented and

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.781
I think innovations like that should definitely, those are

00:01:34.781 --> 00:01:39.740
pure innovations that deserves patents that should be protected.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:40.740
&gt;&gt;

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.855
[COUGH]

00:01:39.855 --> 00:01:45.660
&gt;&gt; Even if it's only one letter change? That one letter change, yeah,

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.890
if that one letter change changes the essence or the function of, I

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.110
mean, like I said, my wife's a yeast geneticist. So small changes make

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.240
big differences, so if you can change something like that, then that's a novel.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.350
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.500
&gt;&gt; Then true sickle cell anemia, one small change.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.020
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. BRCA mutation, and FGFR3 mutation

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.540
that can have major effects. I saw Sterling nodding

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.680
his head over there. You, you agree with that assessment?

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.490
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I would just think, like, an analogy, like can you patent like a type

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.920
of leaf, or you know, patent a part of your body. patent the

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.070
liver. I mean, this is something that's sort of occurring within nature,

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:29.740
already, and then to claim it, is a hard thing to buy into.
