00:00:01.068 --> 00:00:02.269
- MY PLAN WAS TO TAKE PHOTOS
OF THE EVENT

00:00:02.269 --> 00:00:03.704
AND THEN POST THEM ONLINE

00:00:03.704 --> 00:00:07.074
SO SALOMON WOULD SEE HE MISSED
OUT ON A REALLY FUN PARTY.

00:00:07.074 --> 00:00:09.743
UNFORTUNATELY, THE FEW DESIRED
GUESTS I INVITED SAID

00:00:09.743 --> 00:00:12.212
THEY COULDN'T MAKE IT
ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE.

00:00:12.212 --> 00:00:13.847
BUT I STILL FELT
VERONIQUE AND I

00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:18.952
WERE ENOUGH TO HAVE A PARTY.

00:00:18.952 --> 00:00:20.654
DO YOU...SPEAK FRENCH,

00:00:20.654 --> 00:00:24.358
OR IS IT
JUST THE ACCENT YOU DO?

00:00:24.358 --> 00:00:26.159
- NO, I SPEAK FRENCH.

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:28.095
- OH, OKAY.

00:00:28.095 --> 00:00:29.196
- AND I DON'T WANT TO BE RUDE

00:00:29.196 --> 00:00:32.165
BUT I REALLY HAVE TO LEAVE
SOON SO...

00:00:32.165 --> 00:00:33.901
- WITH VERONIQUE
ON THE VERGE OF LEAVING,

00:00:33.901 --> 00:00:35.402
I WAS HOPEFUL THE ENTERTAINMENT
I HIRED

00:00:35.402 --> 00:00:36.970
WOULD TURN THINGS AROUND--

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.872
A PROFESSIONAL BILL GATES
IMPERSONATOR

00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:41.241
WHO I'D WORKED WITH IN THE PAST.

00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:43.076
- IT'S REALLY GREAT TO BE HERE.

00:00:43.076 --> 00:00:45.579
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE A PARTY.

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:47.314
YOU KNOW, UH...

00:00:47.314 --> 00:00:50.083
YOU WORK HARD ALL YOUR LIFE,

00:00:50.083 --> 00:00:54.354
ESPECIALLY TRYING TO GET
MICROSOFT WORKING.

00:00:54.354 --> 00:00:56.790
I MEAN, MICROSOFT.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.026
WHAT WOULD WE HAVE DONE
WITHOUT IT?

00:00:59.026 --> 00:01:02.629
IN THE OFFICE DAYS--OLDER OFFICE
DAYS, IN THE '80s

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:06.967
YOU HAD BIG COMPUTERS
IN A ROOM.

00:01:06.967 --> 00:01:09.336
I MEAN, ENORMOUS.

00:01:09.336 --> 00:01:12.072
AND LOOK AT THE TECHNOLOGY NOW.

00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:15.676
IT TAKES A INVENTIVE MIND

00:01:15.676 --> 00:01:21.682
TO RUN AND INVENT...
THIS MICROSOFT.

00:01:21.682 --> 00:01:24.885
AND I'M VERY HAPPY.

00:01:28.155 --> 00:01:30.290
[awkward applause]

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.493
- AFTER BILL'S PERFORMANCE
THE PARTY HAD REACHED ITS PEAK,

00:01:33.493 --> 00:01:36.263
SO THE ONLY THING LEFT TO DO WAS
TAKE SOME PHOTOS OF THE EVENT

00:01:36.263 --> 00:01:38.365
BEFORE VERONIQUE HAD TO GO.

00:01:38.365 --> 00:01:41.535
AND AFTER AN HOUR OF GETTING TO
KNOW THE MAN BEHIND BILL GATES--

00:01:41.535 --> 00:01:44.204
WHY WERE YOU CIRCUMCISED TWICE?

00:01:44.204 --> 00:01:47.107
- WELL, THE FIRST TIME, UM...

00:01:47.107 --> 00:01:49.142
THERE WAS A PROBLEM
WITH THE FORESKIN.

00:01:49.142 --> 00:01:50.511
- I WRAPPED THINGS UP

00:01:50.511 --> 00:01:53.347
AND THE NEXT DAY, I POSTED
MY PARTY PICS ON FACEBOOK,

00:01:53.347 --> 00:01:56.116
WHERE I WAS SURE SOLOMON
WOULD SEE THEM.

00:01:56.116 --> 00:01:57.284
WITH EVERYTHING IN PLACE,

00:01:57.284 --> 00:02:00.153
IT WAS NOW TIME TO TEST
THE IMPACT OF MY IDEA.

00:02:00.153 --> 00:02:01.188
SO I BROUGHT VERONIQUE
INTO THE OFFICE
