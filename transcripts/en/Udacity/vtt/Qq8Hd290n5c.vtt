00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
For the next few questions we're given this data structure of courses.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Let's take a couple seconds to go through what it looks like.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.500
It's a dictionary where each key in the dictionary is a hexamester of courses that Udacity offers.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.000
In each hexamester we have another dictionary

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
that's where the keys are the name of the course,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and within that there's another dictionary with name value pairs.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
This is a common way to store data in an unstructured form

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
where we just have an attribute like name, teacher, assistant, whatever--

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
prereq down here--and then a value for that attribute:

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Building a Search Engine, the name of the TA, etc, etc.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
This question asks us to write a function

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
that determines whether a course is offered during a given hexamester,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and we're going to do that pretty simply.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Before we get started, let's look at the data structure.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
What we want to do is, given a hexamester and the name of a course,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
we want to determine if that course is a key in the dictionary

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
to which that hexamester is associated with.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
And this is just 1 line of code, actually.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
What this line of code does is determine whether or not the course is a key

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
in the dictionary that we get with the keyword hexamester in our course's data structure.
