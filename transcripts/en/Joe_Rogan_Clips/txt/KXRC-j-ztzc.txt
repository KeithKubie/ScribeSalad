Speaker 1:          00:01          Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:03          And we're live. What's up Yo, dude, you're on a rollercoaster ride. What is it like to be the champ? What's the feeling like this is fresh for you? Oh, well first of all, I just want to say, man, it's such an honor to be here. Um, the honor is mine. I never, I'm gonna I'm gonna be honest. Um, um, my thing is I'm just going to be 100% and totally transparent. I was never, I never really watched the show. I never really kind of heard of this show. Of course I heard of you and all the things you do. I'm like, Oh yeah, it's fear factor guy and all, but I never really heard of this show until like after like a fight or two in the UFC and people are like tagging me and shit. Like, Yo Joe Rogan's talking by Joe. Ranga talked about you in pocket. I'm like fucking podcast. Cause I'd never listened to podcasts at the time. I was like, oof, what are you talking about? Until I finally started listening, I'm like, oh, this dude is for real. This dude got some, some, some pool. You've got some people watching this shit. Random people would tag me. Oh Joel was talking about you today on the podcast. I'm like, Oh man, this guy's for real. And then every time after that that I see you, I'm like sub Gel.

Speaker 2:          01:11          Yeah we've been talking about you for a long time man. We were just with your friend out there. We're watching a video of us talking about you back when you were ranked number 12 and I was saying I think you can fight for the title right now. Yeah man. That um, and I I like to attest it to, I think because I went back once I started kind of researching you, I like to go back and do a little research and I'm like fucking Joe's been with this, this sport for the beginning. Like you were in the back with hair [inaudible] the hair freaking interview in the guys yet during the tournament that we're finding multiple fights and night and you were interviewing those guys and I was like damn. Even back there, Joe had skills. Joel was the beast interview in these guys. There was no shaking behind it.

Speaker 2:          01:55          Cause I, you know one thing about me, I've gotten into comp and commentating and things like that now and I'm like Dang Joe, he didn't seem nervous. You would just like a freaking natural at it. And the sport was just growing at that time. I was like, there was nobody watching back then. It wasn't as much pressure, you know, it wasn't like coming into it today. Yeah. Espn paper view, all that deal. It would be a lot of pressure. But back then it was just fun. Yeah it was. It was weird man. The first one I did was in Dothan, Alabama and this weird like it was, I don't know if it was a high school gym or some small auditorium, tiny little place. It was very weird. They have a, you made it look like a freaking certain little walk in the park. I mean it was, I was like damn chosen good at the gentleman doing this shit for a wow.

Speaker 2:          02:38          Well, it's a, it's an interesting thing to see, you know, to see it progress from 1997 to where it's out of 2019. The biggest difference is not just, uh, the amount of eyes at accounts in amount of people that are paying attention to the real difference is the level of athlete. It's a, it's a giant, giant leap. Like in no other sport, I don't think there's another sport from 1993 to 2019 where the athletes are almost, it's almost unrecognizable. How much better the fighters are as Lilly, you know, it's now back in the day it was like, okay, you finished your college career, you finished all this, you've got to the height of whatever you know, sport you could be, let's start fighting. And so guys were coming in at 28, 27 starting to learn the tricks. Now you've got freaking 10 year old kids sparring.

Speaker 2:          03:31          There's all these crazy videos like little bitty kids fighting in like Russia or other places. Like they're full on MMA fighting. Yeah, totally distinct. That whole promotion. I'm like, man, by the time these guys get to 1617, they're going to be killers. Have, if you go back and watch like a boxing match from like 93 a by a world champion boxer like Marvin Hagler, perfect example, Marvin Hagler from the 80s could absolutely hang with w middleweights like he's, he would fit right in with world champions today. Absolutely. But a UFC champ from 93 mean ah, it's just not the same. It's not by any stretch. It's, it is such a, back then it was like a, it was wild. It was crazy. But nobody had endurance. And you know, there was a few guys that had some skill and certainly our v Orlando VA or hoists Gracie, there was guys are really good at their individual arts, but there was no real complete fighters yet.

Speaker 2:          04:26          Yeah. You got the transition because it was, everyone came in with their special skills and that was, that was a big thing. I think UFC even sold that as, oh yeah, you got the wrestler firing, the calm, the Combo, the sambal guy and the Jujitsu guy. And, uh, so that was the thing. Everyone came in with their one skill and they put it to the test to see what you still watch better. It's freaking crazy. Joe. My first fight, first time I ever watched a UFC fight, I was visiting John Jones in college freshman year. This was our, our, our freshman year to freshman year. I was visiting him cause I went to uh, a small school unit when William Penn University, which was about two hours away from him. He was at Iowa Central in Fort Dodge, Iowa. So I went to go spend my fall break a whole week with him just hanging out because we had met the previous year in high school and just, you know, it's two brothers and wrestling.

Speaker 2:          05:20          It was like, hey two brothers, what's up man? Where you go, let's go like shares, like I'll be, I was like show me too as well. We kept in touch and I want them to hang out with him. And during that week it was a fight on someone, like a friend of the team, something like that invited us to come to his house and watch it. And we went over there to watch the fights. I had never really heard of it. I never really cared. I was just at freshman just trying to hang out with John and Paul uses around, this was 2005 to I think, yeah, 2005 so it was like first season of the ultimate fighter. Yeah, 2005 so we go on, I think it might've been Randy couture or somewhat John just reminded, but I forgot who was fighting and we went to the House party and watched it.

Speaker 2:          06:02          I really didn't really remember the fight cause I didn't really care. I never paid attention to it. I never thought I would ever do something like that. So I just watched it. And then I remember the guy saying, hey man, you guys can do this. Why don't you guys try this? And I was, I mean John kind of looked at each other like hell no. And the way we go and do that shit. You know, wrestling is controlled. You know, there's rules, you know, certain things you can or can't do. There's no way we're doing that. So we kind of laughed it off and left that day. Never knew that I freaking, years later I'd be doing this.
