00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.610
&gt;&gt; So, know that we know a bit more about your Y Chromosome

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.080
in your paternal line, would do you

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.420
know about your Mitochondria, you maternal line?

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:12.460
&gt;&gt; Well, if we look over here, back to MY RESULTS and then under

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:17.320
ANCESTRY OVERVIEW. If you click on the MATERNAL LINE, I found

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.710
out. That, I am J2a1a, a subgroup of J2.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.110
&gt;&gt; Wow! And where's this from?

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:26.220
&gt;&gt; So this

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.980
basically shows that it's from the Northwestern

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.450
portion of Asia in the Middle East.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.740
&gt;&gt; Wow, this seems maybe a little surprising or, or not?

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.930
&gt;&gt; it's very surprising, I mean

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:39.441
[SOUND],

00:00:39.441 --> 00:00:43.675
like I've mentioned earlier I, hypothesized that both my maternal

00:00:43.675 --> 00:00:48.440
and paternal line were all from the North, Northern Europe.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.350
&gt;&gt; And it says here that the Haplogroup J originated

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.910
about 45,000 years ago. On the Arabian Peninsula, just as

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.060
modern humans were first expanding out of Africa. I mean

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.458
that sounds, I mean this is some deep history. Some.

00:01:00.458 --> 00:01:00.666
&gt;&gt; Eh.

00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:01.790
&gt;&gt; Some deep Ancestry here.

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.590
&gt;&gt; I never could imagine that I would find out

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.500
information about my ancestors that, that far.
