00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:08.719
Just because they are rich, famous and sometimes
even powerful celebrities, it doesn’t mean

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:09.719
actors cannot be fired.

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.710
They’re rich, famous and seem to have it
all so it’s hard to imagine powerful celebrities

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.210
It probably happens a lot more than you’d
think.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.050
And sometimes it is a lot worse than you’d
imagine.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.860
Say, for instance, you’re an actor or actress
who has filmed all your scenes and the director

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.529
has a last-minute epiphany that you just aren’t
right for the role.

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.130
Whether it is a contract problem, money issue
or simply not being a good fit, getting fired

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.550
is not fun situation to be in.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:49.440
Check out 
these 10 actors who were fired during production.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.499
Edward Norton in The Avengers
Edward Norton is known for his incredible

00:00:53.499 --> 00:00:57.609
work in films like “Fight Club,” where
he played the unreliable narrator and “American

00:00:57.609 --> 00:00:59.319
History X” as a reformed neo-Nazi.

00:00:59.319 --> 00:01:03.949
Additionally, Norton appeared as Bruce Banner
in the 2008 Hulk movie.

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:08.170
He was expected to reprise his role as the
green monstrous hero in “The Avengers,”

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.660
however, Marvel Studios said it wanted another
actor more suitable for playing the character.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:17.140
Norton reportedly met with director Joss Whedon
and was told Mark Ruffalo was chosen for the

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:26.130
role, citing Ruffalo was much easier to work
with.

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.259
Terrence Howard in Iron Man 2
Terrence Howard could have had an integral

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:34.810
part in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but
all that disappeared in a blink of an eye.

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.520
If you remember, Howard co-starred in the
2008 “Iron Man” film as James Rhodes/War

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.390
Machine, but was replaced by Don Cheadle in
“Iron Man 2.”

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.420
Howard has stated that he had a three-picture
deal and was guaranteed $4.5 million for the

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.909
first movie, $8 million for the second and
an undisclosed amount for the third.

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:57.700
However, the studio only offered him 1/8 of
the original agreed amount for Iron Man 2,

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.899
which is sadly only $1 million.

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:07.479
Aside from the low ball offer, Howard was
also told the film would be a success with

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:09.940
or without him.

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.780
Ouch!

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.470
Stuart Townsend in Lord of the Rings
Stuart Townsend is undoubtedly a talented

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.950
actor, but he just hasn't landed a role that
earns him an A-list status.

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.170
This could be because he’s missed a few
major opportunities.

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.650
The biggest came when, after months of intense
training and preparation, he was fired from

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.440
the role of Aragorn just as filming was commencing
on “Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.440
the Ring.”

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.849
At the very last minute, director Peter Jackson
decided 26-year-old Townsend was too young

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:39.920
for the role and replaced him with Viggo Mortensen.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.670
Unfortunately, Townsend missed another big
opportunity when he dropped out of the Marvel

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.890
blockbuster “Thor.”

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.250
Megan Fox in Transformers
After appearing in both “Transformers”

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.830
and “Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen,”
Megan Fox was replaced as Mikaela Banes.

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.940
Back in 2009, the actress made several remarks
about director Michael Bay comparing him to

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:03.950
Hitler.

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.290
Apparently Fox said to Wonderland magazine,
“He’s (Bay) like Napoleon and he wants

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.560
to create this insane, infamous mad-man reputation.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.200
He wants to be like Hitler on his sets, and
he is.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.360
So, he’s a nightmare to work for.”

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:22.560
After the interview was published, Fox was
fired and replaced with Rosie Huntington-Whiteley.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.610
Anne Hathaway in Knocked Up
“The Devil Wears Prada” actress Anne Hathaway

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.870
was originally cast as lead Alison Scott in
Judd Apatow’s 2007 comedy “Knocked Up.”

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.370
In the film, Alison ends up getting pregnant
after a one night stand with Ben Stone (played

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:37.370
by Seth Rogan).

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:42.180
But it looks as though Hathaway had an issue
with the birthing scene, which she described

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.780
as too graphic.

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:54.610
In the end, Apatow decided to let Anne go
and replaced her with Katherine Heigl.

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:59.160
Dougray Scott in X-Men
You can’t mention X-Men or Wolverine without

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.160
picturing Hugh Jackman’s face.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.160
For over 15 years, the Australian actor has
appeared as the metal clawed hero in over

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.160
seven films.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.810
But it would surprise you to know he was not
the first choice for the role.

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.689
Russell Crowe was originally eyed for the
role but his salary demands were too high.

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:11.329
Next, Dougray Scott was cast as Logan.

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:16.340
However, playing Wolverine required a sequel
and Scott’s conflicting schedule with “Mission:

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.140
Impossible II” made it quite literally an
impossible mission.

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.010
So the role was given to Hugh Jackman.

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:27.950
Sean Young in Batman
Kim Basinger embodied Vicki Vale in Tim Burton’s

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:29.750
1989 “Batman” flick.

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.720
It was like the actress was made for the role.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.110
But she wasn’t the first choice.

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.130
Sean Young was initially set to play the journalist.

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.810
Unfortunately, the “Blade Runner” actress
could not continue on in the role after she

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.101
broke her arm from falling off a horse in
rehearsal.

00:04:43.101 --> 00:04:44.101
Samantha Morton in Her
Imagine the 2013 film “Her” without Scarlett

00:04:44.101 --> 00:04:45.101
Johansson’s husky tone as Samantha, the
intelligent computer OS.

00:04:45.101 --> 00:04:46.101
Well that almost happened!

00:04:46.101 --> 00:04:47.101
The movie had already completed filming when
the Spike Jonze decided to replace British

00:04:47.101 --> 00:04:48.101
actress Samantha Morton with ScarJo.

00:04:48.101 --> 00:04:49.101
Apparently Morton’s performance “wasn’t
working for what the character needed.”

00:04:49.101 --> 00:04:50.101
Ryan Gosling in The Lovely Bones
In Peter Jackson’s 2009 film, “The Lovely

00:04:50.101 --> 00:04:53.970
Bones,” Ryan Gosling initially earned the
part of Jack Salmon.

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:58.600
Gosling decided he needed to gain weight to
play the grieving father and put on 60 pounds

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.500
by melting Haagen Daz ice cream and drinking
it.

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.100
When Gosling arrived on set the first day,
Jackson was all but impressed.

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.940
The two apparently had different ideas of
what the character should look like and in

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:18.010
the end Gosling was replaced by Mark Wahlberg.

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:22.920
James Purefoy in V for Vendetta
James Purefoy was originally cast in the role

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:28.940
of V in the 1988 DC/Vertigo Comics series
“V for Vendetta.”

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:33.710
About six weeks into filming, Purefoy complained
about wearing the mask saying he couldn’t

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:35.260
do it for the entire film.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:41.280
Ultimately this led to him being replaced
by Hugo Weaving and the rest is history.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.130
Amanda Seyfried in As the World Turns

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:48.770
The blonde bombshell Amanda Seyfried is best
known for her role as the ditzy teen Karen

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:50.220
Smith in “Mean Girls.”

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:54.940
But what you may not have known is Seyfried
got her start at 11-years-old on popular soap

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:58.000
operas like “All My Children” and “As
The World Turns.”

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.850
Unfortunately, Seyfried’s acting in the
latter was so bad she was fired.

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:07.320
She played Lucy Montgomery on the soap and
revealed she was so uncomfortable on screen

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.380
that the only option was to ship the character
off.

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:16.100
As devastating as that is, it did prompt Seyfried
to take some acting classes and enhance her

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:17.100
skills.

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:18.470
What do you think of our list?

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:23.400
