Hey it's me Destin welcome to Smarter Every Day 

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.100
and today we're going to show you some pretty cool

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.840
high speed, and it has nothing to do with all those assault rifles. 

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:09.410
It's actually much sweeter than that, literally.

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:12.580
Check this out. It is a

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.750
jar of honey.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.920
So, I know this sounds a little strange

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.100
but we've got a high speed camera setup, and we are going to show you

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.290
something called the liquid rope coil effect.
This is how it works.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.470
You just put some of the honey on this chopstick here,

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:37.660
and just drip it down. And look at this.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.750
Check out that. How cool is that.

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:46.020
It has to do with the viscosity of the fluid, 
and basically the liquid is piling

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.220
up. So I think this is really really neat, 
so we're gonna get a little bit of

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.240
high speed of it, 
and then after that we're going to discuss

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.280
this in more detail.
Fluid dynamics are awesome.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.330
It's tempting to think that this would be an easy math problem but it turns out people have been studying

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.360
this for fifty years. To explain, let me show you the variables.

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:08.430
This section is call the coil, and this section is called the tail. 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:14.560
The coil and the tail together make up the total height, H. 
The mass flow rate of the material

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.730
is Q, and the initial radius at the top of the tail is called

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.920
"a sub zero". We'll call the radius at the bottom "a sub one".

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.090
And the exciting part is the angular coiling frequency, 
which is omega.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.320
The fluid itself also has internal properties that we 
have to consider. Density is rho

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.500
and the surface tension coefficient is gamma.
The kinematic viscosity is nu.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.680
OK simply put, viscosity is

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.800
the measure of the thickness of a fluid. 
Viscosity is the measure of a fluid to

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.960
resist a sheer or tensile stress.
Dynamic viscosity is measured in

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:52.140
Poise, whereas kinematic viscosity 
is measured in Stokes.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.310
Kinematic viscosity is also referred to as 
the Diffusivity of Momentum.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.390
And that makes sense if you think about it, 
to diffuse momentum throughout a fluid.

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.470
As you can see here, obviously the molasses honey 
mixture is the most viscous.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.520
OK if these big words are boring you, just wait.
There's a shower scene for you.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.680
But if you're like me and you want to understand what's going on and you want to know the math, let's do this.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.860
What you're looking at here are the four different types 
of flow that scientists can describe

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.040
using the variables that we defined earlier.
Let's start here with this one.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.220
This is the viscous flow regime. The way it works is as H, or the height that the

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.250
fluid is dropped from is relatively small, the flow has to

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.430
naturally go into a spiral because the fluid has to 
get out of the way of itself.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.600
Now the interesting thing about the equation used 
to define the coiling frequency is

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.780
that it doesn't even include the kinematic viscosity 
of the fluid. That's interesting

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.910
seeing how it's called the viscous flow regime.
OK the second condition we're talking about

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.060
here is called the gravitational flow regime.
Basically the way it works is 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.240
as that height increases, 
gravity begins to take over and stretch

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.430
the fluid. So basically the viscosity 
of the fluid is resisting that

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.490
stretching, and that's why the equation there shows that kinematic viscosity starts to 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.570
come into play. And that's where the coiling 
becomes uniform and stable.

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.670
That's the exact condition that we were filming with the high speed camera earlier.

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.760
The third condition we're gonna talk about is called 
the intertial regime. Now as height

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.930
gets very very long what happens 
is that fluid becomes very fast

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.110
and very very skinny.
Now you noticed in the equation that the radius of

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.300
the coil at the bottom is factored into the denominiator and raised to the tenth power.

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.500
Now if you think about it, that means 
the smaller the radius gets

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.670
the higher the coiling frequency, which makes sense.
OK the fourth regime

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.850
is why I love science. All we know is that somewhere 
between the gravitational

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.030
regime and the intertial regime, everything goes 
out the window. All of a sudden

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.200
you'll go from a steady state coil to some erattic figure eight pattern or something stranger

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.580
but if you raise it just a little bit more, all of a sudden you're steady state again.

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.770
Even more, and you're back on stable.
Everything is erratic. The frequency

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.890
is varying wildly, but it seems to have some sort of 
pattern but we don't know why.

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.050
It's very interesting and there has been a very complex study done on it and I'll leave the link in the

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:09.220
description too that so you can check it out yourself.
I think it's amazing that we as humans can

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:13.390
conquer so many things about the world around us but we still struggle with the smallest of things.

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.440
If you're interested in knowing why I did this video I'll leave that info in the description as well.

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:21.500
Boy that got weird in a hurry didn't it.
Every single day

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:25.590
you can check out the liquid rope coil effect in your own shower.
It's pretty easy. Just take your

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.680
shampoo, which is a pretty viscous fluid, and throttle the flow rate

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.860
and the height until you get the right combination and then boom.

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.050
You lock in on the liquid rope coil effect. It's pretty cool.

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.230
You can change things and see how the variables effect it's action. Anyway,

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.410
I'm not responsible for any extra shampoo you end up using.

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.640
I'm Destin. You're getting Smarter Every Day. 
Have a good one.
