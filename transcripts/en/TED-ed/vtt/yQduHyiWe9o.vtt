00:00:08.014 --> 00:00:10.825
Some are longer than a blue whale.

00:00:10.825 --> 00:00:14.625
Others are barely larger 
than a grain of sand.

00:00:14.625 --> 00:00:18.804
One species unleashes one of
the most deadly venoms on Earth.

00:00:18.804 --> 00:00:24.424
Another holds a secret that's behind some 
of the greatest breakthroughs in biology.

00:00:24.424 --> 00:00:27.797
They've inhabited the ocean for at least
half a billion years,

00:00:27.797 --> 00:00:31.835
and they're still flourishing as the sea
changes around them.

00:00:31.835 --> 00:00:36.436
Jellyfish are soft-bodied sea creatures
that aren't really fish.

00:00:36.436 --> 00:00:40.466
They're part of a diverse team
of gelatinous zooplankton,

00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:44.386
zooplankton being animals that drift
in the ocean.

00:00:44.386 --> 00:00:47.467
There are more than 1,000 species
of jellyfish,

00:00:47.467 --> 00:00:50.717
and many others 
that are often mistaken for them.

00:00:50.717 --> 00:00:54.310
A noted feature of jellyfish 
is a translucent bell

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:58.497
made of a soft delicate material
called mesoglea.

00:00:58.497 --> 00:01:00.915
Sandwiched between two layers of skin,

00:01:00.915 --> 00:01:07.276
the mesoglea is more than 95% water
held together by protein fibers.

00:01:07.276 --> 00:01:12.418
The jellyfish can contract and 
relax their bells to propel themselves.

00:01:12.418 --> 00:01:14.547
They don't have a brain or a spinal cord,

00:01:14.547 --> 00:01:17.187
but a neural net around the bell's
inner margin

00:01:17.187 --> 00:01:19.837
forms a rudimentary nervous system

00:01:19.837 --> 00:01:24.618
that can sense the ocean's currents
and the touch of other animals.

00:01:24.618 --> 00:01:28.707
Jellyfish don't have typical 
digestive systems, either.

00:01:28.707 --> 00:01:34.008
These gelatinous carnivores consume 
plankton and other small sea creatures

00:01:34.008 --> 00:01:37.598
through a hole in the underside 
of their bells.

00:01:37.598 --> 00:01:41.101
The nutrients are absorbed by
an inner layer of cells

00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:45.407
with waste excreted back through
their mouths.

00:01:45.407 --> 00:01:47.938
But the jellyfish's relatively 
simple anatomy

00:01:47.938 --> 00:01:51.795
doesn't prevent it from having
some remarkable abilities.

00:01:51.795 --> 00:01:55.408
One kind of box jellyfish has 24 eyes.

00:01:55.408 --> 00:02:02.538
Scientists think it can see color and form
images within its simple nervous system.

00:02:02.538 --> 00:02:06.218
Four of its eyes are curved 
upward on stalks.

00:02:06.218 --> 00:02:10.217
This allows the jellyfish to peer
through the surface of the water,

00:02:10.217 --> 00:02:14.508
looking for the canopy 
of the mangrove trees where it feeds.

00:02:14.508 --> 00:02:17.268
In fact, this may be one 
of the only creatures

00:02:17.268 --> 00:02:21.581
with a 360-degree view of its environment.

00:02:21.581 --> 00:02:25.939
The jellyfish's sting, which helps it
capture prey and defend itself,

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:28.880
is its most infamous calling card.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.499
In the jelly's epidermis,

00:02:30.499 --> 00:02:36.150
cells called nematocysts
lie coiled like poisonous harpoons.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.629
When they're triggered by contact,
they shoot with an explosive force.

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:46.530
It exerts over 550 times the pressure
of Mike Tyson's strongest punch

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.000
to inject venom into the victim.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.380
Some jellyfish stings barely tingle,

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.720
but others cause severe skin damage.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.209
The venom of one box jellyfish
can kill a human in under five minutes,

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:06.689
making it one of the most potent
poisons of any animal in the world.

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:09.679
Other jellyfish superpowers 
are less lethal.

00:03:09.679 --> 00:03:13.350
One species of jellyfish glows green
when it's agitated,

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:18.120
mostly thanks to a biofluorescent compound
called green fluorescent protein,

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.779
or GFP.

00:03:19.779 --> 00:03:22.289
Scientists isolated the gene for GFP

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:27.431
and figured out how to insert it
into the DNA of other cells.

00:03:27.431 --> 00:03:30.192
There, it acts like a biochemical beacon,

00:03:30.192 --> 00:03:32.240
marking genetic modifications,

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:36.522
or revealing the path 
of critical molecules.

00:03:36.522 --> 00:03:41.681
Scientists have used the glow of GFP
to watch cancer cells proliferate,

00:03:41.681 --> 00:03:43.892
track the development of Alzheimer's,

00:03:43.892 --> 00:03:48.501
and illuminate countless other
biological processes.

00:03:48.501 --> 00:03:51.370
Developing the tools and techniques
from GFP

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.350
has netted three scientists
a Nobel Prize in 2008,

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.543
and another three in 2014.

00:03:58.543 --> 00:04:03.640
But it's jellyfish who may be the most
successful organisms on Earth.

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.811
Ancient fossils prove that jellyfish
have inhabited the seas

00:04:06.811 --> 00:04:09.896
for at least 500 million years,

00:04:09.896 --> 00:04:13.471
and maybe go back over 700 million.

00:04:13.471 --> 00:04:17.552
That's longer than any 
other multiorgan animal.

00:04:17.552 --> 00:04:20.462
And as other marine animals 
are struggling to survive

00:04:20.462 --> 00:04:23.061
in warmer and more acidic oceans,

00:04:23.061 --> 00:04:25.153
the jellyfish are thriving,

00:04:25.153 --> 00:04:28.702
and perhaps getting even more numerous.

00:04:28.702 --> 00:04:35.500
It doesn't hurt that some can lay
as many as 45,000 eggs in a single night.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.042
And there's some jellyfish 
whose survival strategy

00:04:38.042 --> 00:04:40.542
almost sounds like science fiction.

00:04:40.542 --> 00:04:44.491
When the immortal jellyfish is sick,
aging, or under stress,

00:04:44.491 --> 00:04:48.202
its struggling cells can change
their identity.

00:04:48.202 --> 00:04:51.102
The tiny bell and tentacles deteriorate

00:04:51.102 --> 00:04:53.462
and turn into an immature polyp

00:04:53.462 --> 00:04:56.982
that spawns brand new clones
of the parent.

00:04:56.982 --> 00:05:01.103
As far as we know, these are the only
animals who found a loophole

00:05:01.103 --> 00:05:03.742
when facing mortality.

00:05:03.742 --> 00:05:07.653
That's pretty sophisticated for species
that are 95% water

00:05:07.653 --> 00:05:10.062
and predate the dinosaurs.
