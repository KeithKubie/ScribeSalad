Gundrota:
about HTML 5 standards,

00:00:01.534 --> 00:00:02.801
about evolution.

00:00:02.801 --> 00:00:04.067
But in reality,

00:00:04.067 --> 00:00:06.067
I'm not sure
we would've had this luxury

00:00:06.067 --> 00:00:08.601
had it not been for Mozilla's
and the community's

00:00:08.601 --> 00:00:11.100
phenomenal work
over ten years.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.534
There was a time
when people wondered,

00:00:13.534 --> 00:00:16.434
uh, if the--that the odds
were against you guys

00:00:16.434 --> 00:00:18.400
with, uh, competitors
that had the benefit

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.000
of preinstallation.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.133
But you guys really proved--
you proved--

00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:26.133
that you could build a community
of hundreds of millions

00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:28.467
of loyal consumers
who chose Firefox

00:00:28.467 --> 00:00:30.467
and you could build
a better web.

00:00:30.467 --> 00:00:32.634
So for all that you did,
for what you're doing now,

00:00:32.634 --> 00:00:34.767
and for what you will do,
thank you.

00:00:34.767 --> 00:00:36.033
Sullivan: Thanks.
Thanks, Vic.

00:00:36.033 --> 00:00:38.434
Gundrota: Thank you.

00:00:43.767 --> 00:00:45.000
Sullivan: Well,
I want to thank Vic

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.067
for that introduction.

00:00:46.067 --> 00:00:47.968
Um, not for myself,

00:00:47.968 --> 00:00:49.968
but on behalf of the whole
Mozilla community

00:00:49.968 --> 00:00:52.067
around the world
that's made that possible.

00:00:52.067 --> 00:00:55.567
Um, it's an amazing,
vibrant, crazy organization

00:00:55.567 --> 00:00:57.567
that it's fun
to be a part of.

00:00:57.567 --> 00:01:00.434
Um, I want to do three things
today, um, real briefly.

00:01:00.434 --> 00:01:03.434
I want to explain
why Mozilla's here at I/O.

00:01:03.434 --> 00:01:04.767
I want to talk
about what's coming

00:01:04.767 --> 00:01:06.667
in Firefox for developers,

00:01:06.667 --> 00:01:07.968
and I want to give you
a brief demo

00:01:07.968 --> 00:01:11.567
of geolocation support
in the browser.

00:01:11.567 --> 00:01:13.734
So...

00:01:13.734 --> 00:01:15.634
browser competition
is heating up again.

00:01:15.634 --> 00:01:17.701
That's--that's no secret
to anybody here.

00:01:17.701 --> 00:01:19.434
Um, and we think
this is very important.

00:01:19.434 --> 00:01:23.534
As users live more and more
of their lives online,

00:01:23.534 --> 00:01:25.234
it's very important
that we continue

00:01:25.234 --> 00:01:29.434
to improve the user experience,
to make the browser faster,

00:01:29.434 --> 00:01:32.934
and to protect user security
and privacy online.

00:01:32.934 --> 00:01:34.968
And we see what happens

00:01:34.968 --> 00:01:37.734
when there isn't any competition
in the marketplace.

00:01:37.734 --> 00:01:39.968
Things stagnate.
There aren't new features.

00:01:39.968 --> 00:01:41.634
The web does not get better.

00:01:41.634 --> 00:01:44.133
Now, since we entered the market
with Firefox

00:01:44.133 --> 00:01:46.133
and other browsers
have followed--

00:01:46.133 --> 00:01:48.701
these modern browsers
that we're talking about today--

00:01:48.701 --> 00:01:50.367
that's improved
the user experience.

00:01:50.367 --> 00:01:52.734
So it's very important
to have that vibrant competition

00:01:52.734 --> 00:01:53.868
in the marketplace.

00:01:53.868 --> 00:01:55.300
And we're glad
that these other--

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.701
other folks
are producing browsers.

00:01:57.701 --> 00:02:00.934
Now, it's also important to note
that each of our organizations

00:02:00.934 --> 00:02:04.334
have very different missions
and motivations

00:02:04.334 --> 00:02:06.467
for why we work
on web browsers.

00:02:06.467 --> 00:02:08.634
But today,
we put all that aside

00:02:08.634 --> 00:02:11.234
to focus on what we share
in common.

00:02:11.234 --> 00:02:12.834
So we share, I think,

00:02:12.834 --> 00:02:15.167
three important things
in common.

00:02:15.167 --> 00:02:18.067
One, we believe strongly

00:02:18.067 --> 00:02:20.767
that the web
is the development platform

00:02:20.767 --> 00:02:22.534
for our time.

00:02:22.534 --> 00:02:24.367
More than any single
operating system,

00:02:24.367 --> 00:02:26.367
the web is going to drive
the innovation

00:02:26.367 --> 00:02:29.200
and the new services that are
going to do amazing things

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.434
for people all around
the world.

00:02:31.434 --> 00:02:34.968
We also share a belief
that we need to keep bringing

00:02:34.968 --> 00:02:37.234
new capabilities
to you as developers

00:02:37.234 --> 00:02:38.734
so you can create
these things.

00:02:38.734 --> 00:02:41.334
And that means
that we need to move quickly.

00:02:41.334 --> 00:02:44.834
But also we need to make sure
that we don't fragment the web.

00:02:44.834 --> 00:02:46.267
There will be
no worse outcome

00:02:46.267 --> 00:02:47.968
than through
this renewed competition

00:02:47.968 --> 00:02:50.901
to have a fragmentation
of the web platform.

00:02:50.901 --> 00:02:52.868
You should be able to focus
on--on building your house

00:02:52.868 --> 00:02:53.868
and not worrying

00:02:53.868 --> 00:02:55.367
about the cross-browser
plumbing.

00:02:55.367 --> 00:02:56.801
So we need
to work together

00:02:56.801 --> 00:02:59.801
to--to keep that standards
held together.

00:02:59.801 --> 00:03:01.534
And that's a challenge.
And it's--it's the web.

00:03:01.534 --> 00:03:02.834
So it's messy, right?

00:03:02.834 --> 00:03:05.601
So we don't always agree
on what the perfect API is

00:03:05.601 --> 00:03:07.834
to expose a new piece
of functionality.

00:03:07.834 --> 00:03:09.667
We don't even always agree
on the process

00:03:09.667 --> 00:03:11.400
to run some experiments
and then decide

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.334
which the best API
should be.

00:03:13.334 --> 00:03:16.534
But I strongly believe
that a-a very, very good API

00:03:16.534 --> 00:03:18.634
for something
that's in five browsers

00:03:18.634 --> 00:03:21.467
is better than a perfect API
that's in no browsers

00:03:21.467 --> 00:03:22.801
or one browser.

00:03:22.801 --> 00:03:24.968
So we need to work hard
together with Google

00:03:24.968 --> 00:03:27.367
and the other browser vendors
to hold that center.

00:03:27.367 --> 00:03:29.734
And that's very important.

00:03:29.734 --> 00:03:31.534
I want to talk a little bit
about what's coming

00:03:31.534 --> 00:03:34.400
in Firefox 3.5
for developers.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.234
Now Firefox 3.0
is the most successful browser

00:03:38.234 --> 00:03:39.767
that we've ever built.

00:03:39.767 --> 00:03:42.901
Um, we have about 300 million
users worldwide.

00:03:42.901 --> 00:03:45.467
We just recently had
our one billionth

00:03:45.467 --> 00:03:46.868
add-on download.

00:03:46.868 --> 00:03:49.968
Um, so Firefox 3 has been
phenomenally successful.

00:03:49.968 --> 00:03:52.934
But--but we believe
Firefox 3.5 is better.

00:03:52.934 --> 00:03:54.367
We believe it's much better.

00:03:54.367 --> 00:03:55.901
Uh, JavaScript performance,

00:03:55.901 --> 00:03:57.434
which is
the underlying piece

00:03:57.434 --> 00:03:59.501
that dr--that--that enables
all of this innovation

00:03:59.501 --> 00:04:00.667
in these apps that we're--

00:04:00.667 --> 00:04:02.200
that we're working hard
to build--

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.767
JavaScript performance
is three times faster

00:04:04.767 --> 00:04:07.667
in 3.5
than it was in 3.0.

00:04:07.667 --> 00:04:10.400
And ten times faster
than it was in 2.0.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.267
So we've been working very hard
to increase the speed

00:04:12.267 --> 00:04:14.534
of JavaScript execution.

00:04:14.534 --> 00:04:17.767
Um, you heard a little bit
about how canvas works

00:04:17.767 --> 00:04:19.334
and how video works.

00:04:19.334 --> 00:04:21.133
And what I think
is important here

00:04:21.133 --> 00:04:22.734
is getting things
like video

00:04:22.734 --> 00:04:24.734
out of, uh,
out of plug-in prison

00:04:24.734 --> 00:04:26.200
so that we can script them.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.901
And when you combine things
like video and canvas

00:04:28.901 --> 00:04:30.267
as--as Vic demo'ed,

00:04:30.267 --> 00:04:32.767
you start to see the power
of being able to use things

00:04:32.767 --> 00:04:34.901
through--through web APIs

00:04:34.901 --> 00:04:36.234
and be able
to manipulate them

00:04:36.234 --> 00:04:37.501
and mash them up
in new ways.

00:04:37.501 --> 00:04:38.667
And that's really
a common theme

00:04:38.667 --> 00:04:40.033
for some of this
new functionality

00:04:40.033 --> 00:04:41.234
is it's the web.

00:04:41.234 --> 00:04:42.567
You should be able
to touch anything,

00:04:42.567 --> 00:04:44.834
hack anything,
and mash up anything.

00:04:44.834 --> 00:04:47.868
Um, we're adding support
for geolocation.

00:04:47.868 --> 00:04:50.300
And I'll talk about that more
in a minute.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.000
We're also--we also have support
for offline storage

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.567
so that you can begin
to write apps that work better

00:04:55.567 --> 00:04:57.300
when they're disconnected.

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.734
That's--that's very important
for mobile situations

00:04:59.734 --> 00:05:01.267
and--and other use cases.

00:05:01.267 --> 00:05:03.834
And we're also adding support
for Web Workers

00:05:03.834 --> 00:05:06.501
so that you can write scripts
that run pretty intensively

00:05:06.501 --> 00:05:09.200
without hosing your browser,
a very important feature.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.334
And all this stuff is--
is, um, you can--

00:05:12.334 --> 00:05:13.934
you can look at the link
up there and go there

00:05:13.934 --> 00:05:15.234
and it'll take you
to a description

00:05:15.234 --> 00:05:16.968
of how to use
these new APIs

00:05:16.968 --> 00:05:21.501
and exactly what the level
of support is in Firefox 3.5.

00:05:21.501 --> 00:05:23.033
Um, I want to talk
a little bit now

00:05:23.033 --> 00:05:25.567
about geolocation support
in the browser.

00:05:25.567 --> 00:05:27.234
So in Firefox 3.5,

00:05:27.234 --> 00:05:30.767
there's support
for, um, the geolocation API.

00:05:30.767 --> 00:05:33.000
And I'm going to give you a demo
of one of the apps,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.534
um, that's going
to use this.

00:05:39.067 --> 00:05:41.200
So be believe
that there are use cases

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.567
in--in many, many,
um, spheres

00:05:43.567 --> 00:05:45.634
for geolocation support.

00:05:45.634 --> 00:05:49.400
Um, we--we think it's going
to change how maps,

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.634
local search, directions,
all sorts of social networking--

00:05:52.634 --> 00:05:54.100
anywhere where you want
to tag something

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:55.334
with your location,

00:05:55.334 --> 00:05:56.834
we believe it's going
to change the nature

00:05:56.834 --> 00:05:59.067
of how all
of those applications work.

00:05:59.067 --> 00:06:01.767
One particular application
that's going to take advantage

00:06:01.767 --> 00:06:07.234
of Firefox's support
for geolocation is Google Maps.

00:06:07.234 --> 00:06:10.334
So Google Maps, shortly,
will be adding a new button

00:06:10.334 --> 00:06:13.400
to the user interface
called "my location."

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.067
And if I click this button,
I get a prompt.

00:06:16.067 --> 00:06:18.300
And I get request for--
if I would like to share

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.267
my location
with that web site.

00:06:20.267 --> 00:06:21.667
I'm going to go ahead
and click share--

00:06:21.667 --> 00:06:22.901
I'm going to come back
to this

00:06:22.901 --> 00:06:24.534
'cause I want to talk
about this a little bit.

00:06:24.534 --> 00:06:26.200
But I'm going to go ahead
and share my location.

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:29.868
Couldn't be determined.
Let's try that again.

00:06:41.267 --> 00:06:42.767
Okay.

00:06:42.767 --> 00:06:47.868
[applause]

00:06:47.868 --> 00:06:49.300
Murphy's Law of demos.

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:52.300
Um, so--so I wanted to explain
what's happened there.

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:55.033
So, um, what happened
when I clicked that button

00:06:55.033 --> 00:06:57.534
was the browser gathered up
the signal strengths

00:06:57.534 --> 00:06:59.501
of all the nearby
Wi-Fi hotspots

00:06:59.501 --> 00:07:02.534
and transformed that
into a latitude and longitude.

00:07:02.534 --> 00:07:03.868
If it was a cell phone,

00:07:03.868 --> 00:07:05.000
I could've used Wi-Fi

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.334
or I could've used
cell tower IDs

00:07:07.334 --> 00:07:09.934
and the signal strength
of those that are nearby.

00:07:09.934 --> 00:07:13.434
Um, I could even use GPS
if it's local to--to the device.

00:07:13.434 --> 00:07:15.701
So there's a number of ways
a back-end provider,

00:07:15.701 --> 00:07:17.534
uh, can enable
that functionality.

00:07:17.534 --> 00:07:20.067
And because it's Firefox,
user choice is important.

00:07:20.067 --> 00:07:21.834
So users will be able
to download

00:07:21.834 --> 00:07:23.734
all sorts of add-ons
that are going to provide

00:07:23.734 --> 00:07:25.968
that back-end location
functionality.

00:07:25.968 --> 00:07:28.367
And web developers
can enable their applications

00:07:28.367 --> 00:07:30.968
with just a couple lines
of JavaScript code.

00:07:30.968 --> 00:07:33.100
It's dead simple to use
the API.

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:34.934
I want to come back to one thing
real briefly though,

00:07:34.934 --> 00:07:37.033
which is--which is how a user
opts in.

00:07:37.033 --> 00:07:39.200
I think this is very important
for features like this

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:42.467
that begin to blend services
with client-side functionality.

00:07:45.601 --> 00:07:48.200
Now, when I click the button,
I get this mode list info bar.

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:49.534
Now, don't try
to write down the URL.

00:07:49.534 --> 00:07:50.667
It's not going to work.

00:07:50.667 --> 00:07:52.200
It's behind
some Google firewall.

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.000
Uh, don't try this
at home yet.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Um, so--but I get a--
I get information

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.367
about what domain name
is requesting my location.

00:07:59.367 --> 00:08:01.467
I can click "learn more"
if I want to understand

00:08:01.467 --> 00:08:02.634
how the service works

00:08:02.634 --> 00:08:04.868
and how the privacy
policies work.

00:08:04.868 --> 00:08:07.167
And if I just ignore this,
nothing happens.

00:08:07.167 --> 00:08:09.234
If I close it,
nothing happens.

00:08:09.234 --> 00:08:10.567
If I hit don't share--

00:08:10.567 --> 00:08:12.400
and I can remember
that not sharing

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.267
so that I don't get prompted
in the future--

00:08:14.267 --> 00:08:15.300
any of those things

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:16.968
and my location
is never accessed

00:08:16.968 --> 00:08:18.300
by the browser.

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:20.100
It's only if I explicitly
opt in.

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:22.734
And that has to happen
on a per hostname basis

00:08:22.734 --> 00:08:23.834
for this to work.

00:08:23.834 --> 00:08:25.067
So we're trying to err
on the side

00:08:25.067 --> 00:08:26.901
of--of the user
being in control.

00:08:26.901 --> 00:08:29.601
Even though it might include
an extra click here and there,

00:08:29.601 --> 00:08:32.334
we think it's important
to err on that side.

00:08:32.334 --> 00:08:34.267
So, um, that's it
for the demo.

00:08:34.267 --> 00:08:36.200
We look forward to see
the--the great things

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.667
you're going to do
with geolocation

00:08:37.667 --> 00:08:38.868
and with all
of these features.

00:08:38.868 --> 00:08:40.667
So thanks, Vic.

00:08:40.667 --> 00:08:43.667
Gundrota: Thank you.
Thank you.

00:08:43.667 --> 00:08:46.167
[applause]

00:08:46.167 --> 00:08:48.534
Yeah, we love those guys
and can't wait to see

00:08:48.534 --> 00:08:50.100
what they're going
to do next.

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:52.501
Uh, geolocation
broadly available

00:08:52.501 --> 00:08:54.033
in modern browsers.

00:08:54.033 --> 00:08:55.234
Uh, before we move on,

00:08:55.234 --> 00:08:57.334
I should show you
one more geolocation demo.

00:08:57.334 --> 00:08:59.701
Uh, Jay mentioned the importance
of using geolocation

00:08:59.701 --> 00:09:01.367
in mobile scenarios.

00:09:01.367 --> 00:09:03.934
We've got exactly one
of those demos to show you.

00:09:03.934 --> 00:09:08.801
What you're looking at now
is Latitude.

00:09:08.801 --> 00:09:10.534
Latitude is an application
Google released

00:09:10.534 --> 00:09:12.868
several months ago
for phones like the BlackBerry,

00:09:12.868 --> 00:09:14.934
or Windows Mobile
or Nokia phones.

00:09:14.934 --> 00:09:16.434
What you're seeing
for the first time

00:09:16.434 --> 00:09:18.701
is Latitude on the iPhone.

00:09:18.701 --> 00:09:20.634
And there's even one more
surprise.

00:09:20.634 --> 00:09:24.567
It's Latitude on the iPhone
in the browser.

00:09:24.567 --> 00:09:25.968
And the reason
this is possible

00:09:25.968 --> 00:09:27.267
is because
in the next generation

00:09:27.267 --> 00:09:28.901
of Apple's
operating system,

00:09:28.901 --> 00:09:33.434
they too have implemented
the W3C geolocation API.

00:09:33.434 --> 00:09:36.834
So we're able to build apps
that were formerly impossible,

00:09:36.834 --> 00:09:40.334
now possible right on the web,
uh, uh, on the platform.

00:09:40.334 --> 00:09:44.100
You--you'll see this app
shortly after Apple releases,

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:45.834
uh, OS 3.0.

00:09:45.834 --> 00:09:48.367
Okay, let's go back
to slides.

00:09:48.367 --> 00:09:50.100
And by the way,
that's another evidence

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:53.467
of Google making the bet
on HTML 5

00:09:53.467 --> 00:09:55.734
and really try to build
those flagship apps

00:09:55.734 --> 00:09:57.801
so we can move
the web forward.

00:09:57.801 --> 00:10:00.133
Now let's move on and talk
about App Cache and Database.
