00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.790
Now, before the end of this unit, two words of caution.

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:08.390
The first one is that the border between NP completeness and polynomial time

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:10.660
can sometimes be very thin.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.200
I already mentioned to you that for example 3-SAT,

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.580
so where you just have three variables in each clause is NP complete

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.960
but 2-SAT where you just have two variables is solvable in polynomial time

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.890
and there are many other cases like that

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.510
but of course this is good news

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.250
because if your problem turns out to be just as hard to solve as 2-SAT

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.240
you actually have a polynomial time algorithm for it

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.310
although it might initially have seemed a bit harder

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:42.800
or sometimes even if your original problem possibly is as hard as 3-SAT

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.400
maybe you can look at a slightly different problem that becomes polynomial time solvable.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.260
Because oftentimes there are many different ways to frame

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.750
the practical problem that you're trying to solve

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.570
so sometimes you're lucky there.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.420
The second thing is an actual word of caution.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.430
Because this border here can sometimes be so fragile.

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.840
It's very important to be precised in your NP-completeness proof.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:09.000
Because sometimes making just a little mistake in an NP-completeness proof

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.390
can invalidate this whole proof and of course we don't want that.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.780
Now, it's time once more to congratulate you.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.060
You now know what NP completeness means and how you control NP completeness.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.340
And actually not many people can do that.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.010
Very few people know precisely what NP completeness means

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.390
and also they're not capable of showing NP completeness.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.340
In the next unit, we're going to take you even one step further.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.110
We're going to show you countermeasures against NP completeness.

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.600
Because even most people that understand what NP completeness means

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.900
and that can also show NP completeness actually tend to give up

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.090
once they've shown their problem to be NP complete.

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.150
But that's actually not necessary because there are many many techniques

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.660
that she can use to attack even NP complete problems.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:01.220
What should you do when you want to solve the problem and show that is NP complete?

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.710
Should you carefully check your proof?

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.790
Should you have somebody else carefully check your proof?

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.150
Should you give up?

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:13.360
Should you maybe try to think about ways of modifying your problem

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.900
so that it could not be NP-complete or

00:02:15.900 --> 99:59:59.000
should you try to use the techniques that you're about to learn in the next units of this course.
