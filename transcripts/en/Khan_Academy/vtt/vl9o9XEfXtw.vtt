00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:04.670
The volume of a box is
405 cube units, or

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:05.420
I guess cubic units.

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:06.860
So they just want to
keep it general.

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:09.850
It could've been in cubic feet,
or cubic meters, or

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:12.310
cubic centimeters,
or cubic miles.

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:12.790
Who knows?

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:14.640
They just want to keep
it as units, keep it

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.460
as general as possible.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.010
The length is x units, the width
is x plus 4 units, and

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.320
the height is 9 units.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.840
So let me draw this box here.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:31.340
Let me draw a little box here,
so we have a nice little

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.670
visualization.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.570
So they tell us, that
the length is x.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.360
Maybe we could call this
the length right there.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.060
They say the width is x
plus 4, and the height

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.420
is 9 of this box.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.580
In units, what are the
dimensions of the box?

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.400
Well, they also tell us that
the volume is 405.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.760
So the volume, 405-- let
me do it this way.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.340
So if we wanted to calculate the
volume, what would it be?

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.739
Well it would be the width-- it
would be x plus 4 times the

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.510
length -- times x-- times 9.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.010
That's, literally, the
volume of the box.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.880
Now they also tell us that the
volume of the box is 405 cubic

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.300
units, is equal to 405.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.930
So now we just solve for x.

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:22.630
So what do we get here?

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.610
If we distribute this x
into this x plus 4.

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.190
Actually, if we distribute
a 9x.

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:28.300
Let me just rewrite it.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.890
This is the same thing
as 9x times x plus

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.320
4 is equal to 405.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.970
9x times x is equal
to 9x squared.

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:47.110
9x times 4 is equal to
36x, is equal to 405.

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.420
Now we want our quadratic
expression to be equal to 0.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:58.260
So let's subtract 405 from both
sides of this equation.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.010
So when you do that, your
right-hand side equals 0, and

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:11.520
your left-hand side is 9x
squared plus 36x minus 405.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.860
Now, is there any common
factor to these

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.310
numbers right here?

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.860
Well 405, 4 plus 0 plus 5 is 9,
so that is divisible by 9.

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.060
So all of these are
divisible by 9.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.990
Let's just figure out what
405 divided by 9 is.

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:32.700
So 9 goes into 405-- 9
goes into 40 4 times.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.200
4 times 9 is 36.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.940
Subtract you get 45.

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.380
9 goes into 45 5 times.

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.880
5 times 9 is 45.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:44.960
Subtract, you get 0.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.880
So it goes 45 times.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:52.090
So if we factor out a 9 here,
we get 9 times x squared--

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.410
actually even better, you
don't even have to

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:54.355
factor out of 9.

00:02:54.355 --> 00:02:56.990
If you think about it, you can
divide both sides of this

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:58.460
equation by 9.

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:02.640
So if you can divide all of
the terms by 9, it won't

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.060
change the equation.

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.465
You're doing the same thing to
both sides of equations, which

00:03:06.465 --> 00:03:10.020
we've learned long ago is a
very valid thing to do.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.150
So here you get x squared-- if
you just had this expression,

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.600
here, and someone told you to
factor it, then you'd have to

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:17.710
factor out the 9.

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:20.120
But because this is an equation,
it equals 0, let's

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.200
just divide everything by 9.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.610
It'll simplify things.

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:30.730
So you get x squared plus 4x
minus 45 is equal to 0.

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.560
And now we can try to factor
this right here.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.740
And this fits the pattern, where
we don't have a leading

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:37.540
1 out here.

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.500
So we don't even have to
do it by grouping.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.860
You just have to think, what 2
numbers, when I take their

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.870
product I get negative 45, and
when I take their sum, I get

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:46.960
positive 4.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:47.830
They are 4 apart.

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:49.750
1 has to be positive, 1
has to be negative.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.650
Their positive versions
have to be 4 apart.

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.430
Because when you take the sum,
you are really taking their

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.950
difference because 1 of
them is negative.

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.330
So let's think about it.

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.800
When you have positive
9 and negative 5, I

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:01.550
think that'll work.

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.880
Right?

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.520
Positive 9 plus negative
5 is 4.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.280
And when you take the product,
you get negative 45.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:14.240
So you have x plus 9 times
x minus 5 is equal to 0.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.560
Just factored it out.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.630
And we've seen this before.

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.000
If you have 2 numbers, when you
take their product that

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
equals 0, that means 1 of these
numbers at least has to

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.960
be equal 0.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.180
So this means that x plus
9 is equal to 0.

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.590
Scroll down a little bit.

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:36.900
x plus 9 is equal 0, or
x minus 5 is equal 0.

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.105
So if we subtract 9 from this
equation right there, you get

00:04:41.105 --> 00:04:45.500
x is equal to negative 9, or if
you add 5 to both sides of

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:46.900
this equation, here.

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.820
You get x is equal to 5.

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.820
So these are both possible
values of x right here.

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.950
So the box, if you take x is
equal to negative 9, well, x

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:59.530
equal to negative
9 won't work.

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.650
Because if you but negative 9
here, you're going to have a

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.160
box that has a width of negative
5, a length of

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.810
negative 9, and a height of 9.

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:11.930
And if we're talking about our
reality, we don't have

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:13.200
negative distances like this.

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.850
That can't be the length
or the width.

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:19.190
So x equals negative 9 isn't
appropriate for this problem

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:21.340
Because in this problem we
need to have positive

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:22.340
dimensions.

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:24.525
So let's see what happens
with x equals 5.

00:05:24.525 --> 00:05:29.460
If x equals 5, x plus 4 is 9,
and this dimension right here

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.290
is going to be 5.

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:33.530
And that seems pretty reasonable
for our reality.

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:36.620
And let's verify that
this does end up

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.070
with a volume of 405.

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:44.630
9 times 5 is 45 times
9 is indeed 405.

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:51.810
We just figured that out over
here, that 45 times 9 is 405.

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.350
So we're done.
