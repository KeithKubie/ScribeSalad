00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.770
A 7.8 magnitude Earthquake rained avalanches
on Mount Everest and devastated Nepal.

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:12.340
What exactly is going on underground when
the Earth moves so violently?

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:20.420
The Theory of Plate tectonics was put forward
in the mid-20th century based on decades of

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:21.640
earlier research.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.660
One scientist, Alfred Wegener first suggested
the concept of continental drift in 1912 - the

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.140
idea that land masses can move across the
earth’s surfaces.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.730
But he didn’t know the mechanism behind
the movement.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.829
Throughout the 50s, 60s and 70s more pieces
of the puzzle fell into place.

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:39.399
Including ideas like sea-floor spreading,
and global crustal motion.

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:43.190
Now scientists know that the Earth is made
up of several layers, the mantle and the crust

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.670
make up the outermost shell, the Lithosphere.

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.859
This crust is broken up into 7 or 8 major
tectonic plates which float on top of another

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:51.690
layer called the asthenosphere.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.730
The molten rock beneath them move them around
like a conveyer belt.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.760
Sometimes the plates meet up and move towards
each other forming a convergent boundary,

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.339
when they move apart, it’s a divergent boundary,
when they slide past each other it’s a transform.

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:07.610
When plates slide over, under or past each
other it creates a lot of pressure which can

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.630
be released as a volcanic eruption or an Earthquake.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.040
Nepal sits on a volatile zone.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.899
The Indian plate broke off from Madagascar
90 million years ago.

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:19.450
Around 50 million years ago it hit the Eurasian
plate.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.350
This forced the Indian plate to take a dive,
while the other plate thrusted upwards creating

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:24.390
the Himalayas.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.350
When two plates meet like this, it’s called
a thrust fault.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.689
Millions of years later, they’re still crashing
into each other.

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:34.289
The Indian plate subducts, or is sliding beneath
the other plate, and moves North 2 inches

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:35.289
(5 centimeters) a year.

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:37.549
This builds up enormous amounts of pressure.

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:40.250
When all that pressure is released, it can
mean disaster.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:41.250
This region is weirdly used to earthquakes,
for some reason.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.090
They seem to experience large quakes every
75 years or so, like clockwork.

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.600
And this one was right on cue, the last major
Earthquake struck in 1934.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.490
But this recent earthquake was shallow, at
only 15 kilometres deep.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.950
While a 7 magnitude earthquake is devastating
on its own, a shallow depth means more shaking

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.299
at the surface and more damage.

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:02.999
At the time of this taping, the death toll
from this catastrophic earthquake’s death

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:05.710
toll is over 4-thousand and is expected to
rise.

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.910
Buildings, temples and homes have been toppled
as many remain in need of help.

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.500
Recovery efforts are underway with aid and
humanitarian organizations mobilizing to provide

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.580
much needed support, but they need help.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.940
In response to the tragic earthquake, Discovery
Communications will be making a $250,000 donation

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.110
to relief efforts.

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.650
And we hope that you too can support the people
of Nepal by visiting GlobalGiving’s Nepal

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:26.650
Earthquake Relief Fund page.

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.590
We’ve got a link below in the description.

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.360
