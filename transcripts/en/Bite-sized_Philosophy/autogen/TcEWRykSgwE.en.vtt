distribution but Pareto distributions

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380
distribution but Pareto distributions
 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.380
distribution but Pareto distributions
govern for example the distribution of

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390
govern for example the distribution of
 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.960
govern for example the distribution of
money which is why one percent of the

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970
money which is why one percent of the
 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.060
money which is why one percent of the
people in the general population have

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070
people in the general population have
 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.429
people in the general population have
the overwhelming amount of money and one

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439
the overwhelming amount of money and one
 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.620
the overwhelming amount of money and one
tenth of that one percent has almost all

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630
tenth of that one percent has almost all
 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.810
tenth of that one percent has almost all
of that right so I think it's like the

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820
of that right so I think it's like the
 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.630
of that right so I think it's like the

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.380
as much money as the bottom two and a
half billion and you think well that's a

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390
half billion and you think well that's a
 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.270
half billion and you think well that's a
terrible thing and perhaps it is but

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280
terrible thing and perhaps it is but
 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.550
terrible thing and perhaps it is but
what you have to understand is that that

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560
what you have to understand is that that
 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.800
what you have to understand is that that
law governs the distribution of creative

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810

production across all creative domains

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879
production across all creative domains
 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.180

right it's something like a natural law

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190
right it's something like a natural law
 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.979
right it's something like a natural law
and we can we'll talk about that more

and we can we'll talk about that more
 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:14.240
and we can we'll talk about that more
