three times a week they check the device

00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:40.760
three times a week they check the device
 

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:42.790
three times a week they check the device
catalog and essentially they do three

the last tool which is country targeting

00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:34.780
the last tool which is country targeting
 

00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:37.090
the last tool which is country targeting
country targeting is a very powerful

00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:37.100
country targeting is a very powerful
 

00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:39.760
country targeting is a very powerful
tool and essentially it allows two

tool and essentially it allows two
 

00:22:39.770 --> 00:22:42.280
tool and essentially it allows two
things so first we can have different

00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:42.290
things so first we can have different
 

00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:44.770
things so first we can have different
tracks per country and then we can run

00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:44.780
tracks per country and then we can run
 

00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:47.290
tracks per country and then we can run

launches in processes where for example

00:22:55.150 --> 00:22:55.160
launches in processes where for example
 

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:57.340
launches in processes where for example
we want to have one particular region in

monetization secondly is key during
 

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:05.080
monetization secondly is key during
launch because we can use a staged

rollout per geographies and these means

00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:07.340
rollout per geographies and these means
 

00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:08.799
rollout per geographies and these means
that you can control the rollout in

00:23:08.799 --> 00:23:08.809
that you can control the rollout in
 

00:23:08.809 --> 00:23:10.600
that you can control the rollout in
different countries and then monitor

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:10.610
different countries and then monitor

this allows us to test server

00:23:14.890 --> 00:23:14.900
this allows us to test server
 

00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:17.799
this allows us to test server

a second stage they open up to a fewer
more countries and they were testing

00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:20.360
more countries and they were testing
 

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:24.820
more countries and they were testing
mostly server capacity and ensuring the

00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:24.830
mostly server capacity and ensuring the

during this whole process wargaming was

00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:41.630
during this whole process wargaming was
 

00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:44.410
during this whole process wargaming was
testing as well and monitoring the

00:24:44.410 --> 00:24:44.420
testing as well and monitoring the
 

00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:46.180

targeting two things to remember today
 

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:55.780
targeting two things to remember today
so the first one is like we can use a

00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:55.790
so the first one is like we can use a
 

00:24:55.790 --> 00:24:58.330
so the first one is like we can use a
country targeting during soft launch but

00:24:58.330 --> 00:24:58.340
country targeting during soft launch but
 

00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:01.030
