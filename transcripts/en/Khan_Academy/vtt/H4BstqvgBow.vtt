00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.633
Let's see if we can get some experience

00:00:02.633 --> 00:00:06.633
converting from a decimal representation

00:00:07.263 --> 00:00:11.467
to a binary representation.

00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:15.156
Let's start with the fairly
straightforward example

00:00:15.156 --> 00:00:16.361
with a fairly low number.

00:00:16.607 --> 00:00:17.566
Let's see if we can convert

00:00:17.566 --> 00:00:21.800
the number 13 in decimal to binary.

00:00:21.833 --> 00:00:23.367
And I encourage you to pause the video,

00:00:23.367 --> 00:00:25.867
and try to work through
it out on your own.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.366
So I'm assuming you had a go at it.

00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:30.634
So the key here is to see if you can

00:00:30.634 --> 00:00:34.700
deconstruct the number 13
as the sum of powers of two.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.168
And then it becomes very straightforward

00:00:36.168 --> 00:00:37.900
to represent it in binary.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.500
Because in binary, you're
essentially saying,

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.400
well what powers of two do you
need to make up this number.

00:00:43.992 --> 00:00:45.900
So let's just write
the powers of two here,

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.633
just to remind ourselves.

00:00:47.633 --> 00:00:50.300
And I'll go until we go right above 13.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.500
So two to the zero is equal to one,

00:00:53.033 --> 00:00:54.967
Two to the first is equal to 2.

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.767
Two squared is equal to four.

00:00:57.767 --> 00:01:00.700
Two to the third is equal to eight.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.233
Two to the fourth is equal to 16.

00:01:03.233 --> 00:01:04.833
So now, I'm above 13,

00:01:04.833 --> 00:01:09.833
so I have all the powers of two
that I need to construct 13.

00:01:11.089 --> 00:01:12.766
So what's the largest power of two,

00:01:13.427 --> 00:01:15.233
that is less than or equal to 13?

00:01:16.063 --> 00:01:18.567
Well, 16's too large,
well it would be eight.

00:01:18.567 --> 00:01:22.400
So I could rewrite 13 as eight plus five.

00:01:23.567 --> 00:01:25.433
Now five is not a power of two,

00:01:25.433 --> 00:01:27.433
so I have to keep deconstructing that.

00:01:27.433 --> 00:01:29.101
What's the largest power of two,

00:01:29.101 --> 00:01:31.933
that is less than or equal to five?

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.367
We see it right over here, it's four.

00:01:34.367 --> 00:01:35.900
So let me rewrite that,

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.500
it's eight plus, instead of writing five,

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.933
I'll write four plus one,

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.833
and then the good thing is
at one as a power of two

00:01:44.833 --> 00:01:46.033
we already see is the largest power of two

00:01:46.033 --> 00:01:47.700
that is less than or equal to it is one.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.367
This already is a power of two.

00:01:49.873 --> 00:01:51.576
So I now have rewritten this

00:01:51.576 --> 00:01:55.600
as the sum of powers of two.

00:01:57.233 --> 00:02:00.034
Notice this is two to the third power.

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:08.279
This is two squared, and this
is two to the zero power.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:11.900
Or I could write it like this.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.800
I have 1 eight, clearly.

00:02:16.966 --> 00:02:21.966
I have 1 four, and I have 1 one.

00:02:24.501 --> 00:02:28.434
So I can add these two, I
can add these three together.

00:02:28.434 --> 00:02:32.166
13 could be considered 1
eight plus 1 four plus 1 one.

00:02:32.433 --> 00:02:34.100
Why is that helpful?

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.100
Well now, let's go in to binary mode.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.228
And think about what each of
the place values represent.

00:02:41.288 --> 00:02:46.233
So, this is the ones place,
that's the ones place.

00:02:46.233 --> 00:02:49.833
And then we can go to the twos place.

00:02:51.417 --> 00:02:52.433
Every time we go to the left,

00:02:52.433 --> 00:02:54.700
each place we multiply by two.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.433
It's the next power of two.

00:02:56.766 --> 00:03:01.766
Then we go to the fours
place, fours place.

00:03:02.766 --> 00:03:06.866
And then we go the eights place, eights.

00:03:09.966 --> 00:03:12.234
In binary I only have
two digits, zero and one.

00:03:12.234 --> 00:03:15.566
So I either have zero of a
place or I have one of it.

00:03:15.904 --> 00:03:17.235
So let's go through it.

00:03:17.235 --> 00:03:18.967
How many ones do I have?

00:03:18.967 --> 00:03:21.766
Well I have 1 one, so I write that there.

00:03:21.766 --> 00:03:23.567
How many twos do I have?

00:03:23.567 --> 00:03:25.766
Well in this representation
I don't have any twos.

00:03:26.058 --> 00:03:28.100
I have an eight, I have a four and a one.

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.766
So I'm gonna put I have 0 twos.

00:03:30.627 --> 00:03:32.351
How many fours do I have?

00:03:32.351 --> 00:03:33.766
Well I have 1 four.

00:03:34.658 --> 00:03:36.500
And how many eights do I have?

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.666
Well I have 1 eight.

00:03:38.766 --> 00:03:43.766
So 13, or 13 which is a decimal number.

00:03:45.033 --> 00:03:50.033
If I were to write it in
binary, is one one zero one.
