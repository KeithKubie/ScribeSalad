00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.600
Categorize each of the following
statements as true or false.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.850
If an event is
unlikely to occur,

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.630
its probability
will be negative.

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:11.210
No.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.870
Your probability can
never be negative.

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:19.150
Even if something is impossible,
then the probability will be 0.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.270
If it's highly unlikely,
it'll be close to 0,

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:24.940
but it'll be still positive.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.050
Probabilities are
always between 0 and 1.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.100
0 means it is impossible.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.330
It cannot happen.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.240
1 means that it's a certainty
that it will happen.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.060
And the values in between
say how likely or unlikely

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.760
they are.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.780
Probabilities
greater than 0.5 say,

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.890
hey, it's more likely than not.

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.520
Probabilities less than 0.5,
it's more unlikely than not.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.810
And probabilities
of 0.5 say, hey,

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:55.360
it's just as likely to
happen or as to not happen.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.180
An event with
probability 3/5 is less

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.650
likely to occur than an
event with probability 3/4.

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.645
So 3/5 is a smaller
number than 3/4.

00:01:05.645 --> 00:01:06.770
We have the same numerator.

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.230
We have a larger denominator.

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.560
3 is a smaller fraction
of 5 than it is of 4.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.310
So since 3/5 is a
smaller number than 3/4--

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.210
and it's more obvious if you
see it as a decimal-- 3/5

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.180
is 0.6 while 3/4 is 0.75.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.090
So this is less likely to occur.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.920
This is true.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.290
The probability of getting 1,000
tails in 1,000 tosses of coin

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.310
is 0.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.804
So getting 1,000
tails in 1,000 tosses.

00:01:32.804 --> 00:01:35.470
In future videos, we'll actually
talk about how to calculate it.

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.120
It's a very, very
low probability,

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.040
but it still is possible.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.240
It still is possible.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.980
So the probability is not 0.

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.200
It could be a very small
positive number close to 0,

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.080
but it is not 0.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.480
It's actually possible.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.230
A probability of 0 means
that it is impossible.

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.540
The probability of
winning the lottery is 0.

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.820
Once again, you can
win the lottery.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.680
It's within the realm of
possibility, so it's not 0.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.030
It's a very small number.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.000
It could be close to
0, but it's not 0.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.250
So this is false.

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.400
The probability
that the sun will

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.020
rise in the west tomorrow
on earth is 0.25.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.190
So you probably already
know, or hopefully know,

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.970
that the sun rises in the east.

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.720
And assuming that the Earth
continues to rotate in the way

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.570
that it rotates, it will
continue to rise in the east.

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.670
Now, there is some ultra,
ultra small probability

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.030
that an asteroid of the
right mass or a meteorite

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.900
of the right mass hits
earth in the exact right way

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.210
to somehow reverse
its spin to maybe make

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:40.910
the sun rise in the
west, but that's

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.110
a super, super, super,
duper small probability.

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.460
That probability is very, very,
very, very, very close to 0.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.640
It's not going to be 0.25.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.980
0.25 is a fairly
large probability.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.430
So if this was
actually the case, then

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.150
as we live our lives,
we would be seeing days

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.860
where the sun rises on the west.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.030
And we clearly don't see
that, so this is false.

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.256
The probability that the Obama
family's beloved dog, Bo,

00:03:09.256 --> 00:03:11.130
will gain access to the
President's computer,

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.340
log on to dogancestors.com,
and leave the country in search

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.660
of his long-lost relatives
in Portugal is 0.01.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.340
So this seems, if
not an impossibility,

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.700
a near impossibility,
that the dog somehow

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.480
will know how to
log onto a computer.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.700
This is probably
an impossibility.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.810
And then, actually, be
able to read something

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.960
on a website, type on a website,
and then read on a website?

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.240
This seems close to an
impossibility, if not

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.450
an impossibility.

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.930
And then, somehow getting a
ticket and leaving the country,

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.870
and somehow the Secret
Service lets them?

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.790
This seems pretty
close to impossible.

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.940
So this probability is
pretty darn close to 0.

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.620
If it's impossible,
it would be 0,

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.710
but it'd be much, much
closer to 0 than 0.01.

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:00.610
This is a small probability,
but this is not super unlikely.

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.890
If this was the case, this means
that if we had 100 realities

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.090
like we had today, 1 out
of those 100 realities,

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.340
it would be reasonable to
expect this scenario to happen,

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.830
and we know it's a much, much
lower probability than that.

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.220
This probability is
very, very close to 0.

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.550
If this said 0.000 and it had
like twenty zeroes and then

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:22.500
a 1, I'd have to think
about a little bit more,

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.100
but I would say that this is
still false, that even 0.01,

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:31.910
as high as it is, is
still a low probability.

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:34.320
So we only got one
true statement,

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.880
and we got a bunch
of false ones.
