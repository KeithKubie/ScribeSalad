energy leaching the nutrients rather
 

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:52.240
energy leaching the nutrients rather
than closing the leakages so we need

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250
than closing the leakages so we need
 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.089
than closing the leakages so we need
nutrient-dense foods and yet we are

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:55.099
nutrient-dense foods and yet we are
 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:57.280
nutrient-dense foods and yet we are
investing in removing the nutrients so

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290
investing in removing the nutrients so
 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.830

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:17.740
and what we're seeing today of the kind
of monoculture trend that that leads to

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750
of monoculture trend that that leads to
 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.890
of monoculture trend that that leads to
is a threat to the food security in the

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900
is a threat to the food security in the
 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.870
is a threat to the food security in the
future and that we need to enrich and

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880
future and that we need to enrich and
 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.790
future and that we need to enrich and
invest in the local indigenous food

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800
invest in the local indigenous food
 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:25.840

food yeah and that's why we don't have

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040
food yeah and that's why we don't have
 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.730
food yeah and that's why we don't have
healthy food that's one key how and how

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740
healthy food that's one key how and how

that concerns me greatly is that there

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330
that concerns me greatly is that there
 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:54.340
that concerns me greatly is that there
is this huge distance between the way we

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:54.350
is this huge distance between the way we
 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.800
is this huge distance between the way we
think about food in Europe in the West

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810
think about food in Europe in the West
 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:59.830
think about food in Europe in the West
and the way that food is thought about

00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840
and the way that food is thought about
 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.840
and the way that food is thought about
and is important in the developing world

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:01.850
and is important in the developing world
 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:04.260

emotional response to GMOs and so I

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110
emotional response to GMOs and so I
 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:28.930
emotional response to GMOs and so I
decided I was going to try to do

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940
decided I was going to try to do
 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.240

to get involved in this but in fact it

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:38.540
to get involved in this but in fact it
 

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:39.490
to get involved in this but in fact it
is now possible

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:39.500
is now possible

we should make sure that the

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:32.360
we should make sure that the
 

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.810
we should make sure that the
possibilities of better agriculture that

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:34.820
possibilities of better agriculture that
 

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:38.050
possibilities of better agriculture that
are available here in Europe also can be

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:38.060
are available here in Europe also can be
 

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:40.060
are available here in Europe also can be
used in the developing countries and so

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:40.070
used in the developing countries and so
 

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:41.470

sensibly we are going to build tax

00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:10.400
sensibly we are going to build tax
 

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:12.840

with what I think the challenge we
 

00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:50.020
with what I think the challenge we
always have with the GMO debate is that

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:50.030
always have with the GMO debate is that
 

00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:52.780
always have with the GMO debate is that
it gets emotional because it's presented

choice should be for the producer the

broader question I think the challenge

00:13:33.309 --> 00:13:33.319
broader question I think the challenge
 

00:13:33.319 --> 00:13:36.189
broader question I think the challenge
for me is really let's improve

00:13:36.189 --> 00:13:36.199
