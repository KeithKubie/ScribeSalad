Since you just calculated the midpoints of each of the sides of this

00:00:03.697 --> 00:00:07.875
quadrilateral, I've now plotted them for you on our coordinate plane. I think

00:00:07.887 --> 00:00:12.220
you'll find something pretty interesting though. What happens if I connect all

00:00:12.232 --> 00:00:16.435
these midpoints together? Hm, we get 8 different quadrilateral. Think for a

00:00:16.447 --> 00:00:20.876
second about these line segments joining these points and the shape that we

00:00:20.888 --> 00:00:25.875
formed. Here's a box for you to just record your thoughts about our new shape.
