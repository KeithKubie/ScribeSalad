so I'm sitting somewhere in between

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680
so I'm sitting somewhere in between
 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.840
so I'm sitting somewhere in between
reality and fantasy right now and the

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850
reality and fantasy right now and the
 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.690
reality and fantasy right now and the
wheelchair and no cure is the reality no

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700
wheelchair and no cure is the reality no
 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.300
wheelchair and no cure is the reality no
and the fantasy is that there may be a

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310
and the fantasy is that there may be a
 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.620
and the fantasy is that there may be a
cure one day and we may be able to walk

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630
cure one day and we may be able to walk
 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.270
cure one day and we may be able to walk
so I'm operating somewhere in between

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280
so I'm operating somewhere in between
 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:24.770
so I'm operating somewhere in between
those two places

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780
