00:00:00.083 --> 00:00:02.289
 Let's talk about the different ways, 

00:00:02.289 --> 00:00:04.030
 on which molecules can be transported 

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:06.282
 through the cell membrane. 

00:00:06.282 --> 00:00:07.954
 Perhaps the most common 

00:00:07.954 --> 00:00:10.346
 and the most passive of passive modes of transport 

00:00:10.346 --> 00:00:11.971
 is the simple diffusion. 

00:00:11.971 --> 00:00:13.550
 If we have a molecule that is small enough, 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:15.203
 let's say it's molecular oxygen. 

00:00:15.203 --> 00:00:18.639
 This molecule is small, no charge, no polarity. 

00:00:18.639 --> 00:00:20.779
 Will be able to diffuse through the membrane in the direction 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:24.007
 of its concentration gradient. 

00:00:24.007 --> 00:00:26.398
 But if we have charged particles 

00:00:26.398 --> 00:00:27.768
 or larger molecules, 

00:00:27.768 --> 00:00:29.631
 then we need help. 

00:00:29.631 --> 00:00:32.346
 The first type of help will simply be to facilitate the movement of particles 

00:00:32.346 --> 00:00:34.990
 in the direction of their concentration gradient. 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:37.038
 This is called relieved diffusion. 

00:00:37.038 --> 00:00:39.847
 We have a whole separate video on the diffusion. 

00:00:39.847 --> 00:00:41.217
 Some kind of diffusion 

00:00:41.217 --> 00:00:43.214
 is done by opening tunnels that allow certain particles 

00:00:43.214 --> 00:00:44.844
 to move in the direction of their concentration gradient. 

00:00:44.844 --> 00:00:48.354
 We saw an example of such transport in the potassium ion channels. 

00:00:48.354 --> 00:00:51.424
 Potassium ions accumulate inside the cell 

00:00:51.424 --> 00:00:53.217
 due to the action of the sodium-potassium pump. 

00:00:53.217 --> 00:00:55.748
 Let's clarify this chart, 

00:00:55.748 --> 00:00:58.627
 this is the environment outside the cell, 

00:00:58.627 --> 00:01:00.814
 but these channels pass potassium ions 

00:01:00.814 --> 00:01:02.398
 and they move in the direction of their concentration gradient. 

00:01:02.398 --> 00:01:04.395
 This will not continue until the concentration of potassium ions on both sides is equal 

00:01:04.395 --> 00:01:05.375
 of the membrane, because the external environment is more positive than the interior of the cell, 

00:01:05.375 --> 00:01:06.977
 we will talk about it in other videos. 

00:01:06.977 --> 00:01:08.401
 But this structure is just a simple tunnel. 

00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:10.537
 Some tunnels can have activation doors. 

00:01:10.537 --> 00:01:12.975
 They only open if they receive a specific alert. 

00:01:12.975 --> 00:01:15.251
 We see examples of these tunnels when talking about transmission of signals 

00:01:15.251 --> 00:01:19.086
 along the neuron, thanks to channels regulated by the tension in the cell. 

00:01:19.086 --> 00:01:21.060
 Once the voltage reaches a certain threshold, 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.871
 this channel opens and scraps, 

00:01:22.871 --> 00:01:24.705
 which has a higher concentration from the outside, 

00:01:24.705 --> 00:01:27.930
 begins to enter the cage in the direction of its concentration gradient. 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.235
 This is considered as passive transport, 

00:01:31.235 --> 00:01:33.835
 this is a relaxed diffusion. Passive transport, 

00:01:33.835 --> 00:01:35.437
 which allows certain particles to move in the direction 

00:01:35.437 --> 00:01:37.132
 of its concentration gradient. 

00:01:37.132 --> 00:01:39.412
 - 

00:01:39.412 --> 00:01:41.479
 You can see that the potassium here moves in the direction 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:42.621
 of its concentration gradient. 

00:01:42.621 --> 00:01:45.059
 There is a high concentration inside 

00:01:45.059 --> 00:01:46.434
 and low concentration outside the cell. 

00:01:46.434 --> 00:01:47.711
 We allow him to move in the direction 

00:01:47.711 --> 00:01:49.266
 of its concentration gradient. 

00:01:49.266 --> 00:01:52.383
 Sodium has a high concentration outside 

00:01:52.383 --> 00:01:54.496
 and low concentration inside. 

00:01:54.496 --> 00:01:56.799
 This is thanks to the sodium-potassium pump. 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:58.889
 But with this channel we allow sodium ions to move in the direction 

00:01:58.889 --> 00:02:00.700
 of its concentration gradient. 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.822
 Now let's talk about active transport. 

00:02:02.822 --> 00:02:05.701
 Passive transport does not need energy, 

00:02:05.701 --> 00:02:06.797
 to run. 

00:02:06.797 --> 00:02:09.403
 At it the particles simply move in the direction of their gradient. 

00:02:09.403 --> 00:02:13.470
 In active transport, however, we use energy directly, 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.396
 to make something move in the opposite direction to his gradient. 

00:02:16.396 --> 00:02:19.995
 Or we use energy that is created by another kind of active transport, 

00:02:19.995 --> 00:02:22.572
 to help other types of particles 

00:02:22.572 --> 00:02:24.151
 to move in the opposite direction to their gradient. 

00:02:24.151 --> 00:02:26.199
 Let's first talk about primary active transport, 

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:29.427
 because it can be a bit easier to understand. 

00:02:29.427 --> 00:02:31.799
 But none of the modes of transport is very complex. 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:33.336
 When we talk about animal cells, 

00:02:33.336 --> 00:02:35.078
 a very good example of active transport is 

00:02:35.078 --> 00:02:37.678
 sodium-potassium pump. 

00:02:37.678 --> 00:02:39.838
 It is extremely important to establish 

00:02:39.838 --> 00:02:43.343
 membrane potential of rest. 

00:02:43.343 --> 00:02:45.559
 Furthermore, the concentration gradients, 

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:48.414
 which it creates 

00:02:48.414 --> 00:02:49.668
 are very important. 

00:02:49.668 --> 00:02:51.828
 The sodium-potassium pump pumps 

00:02:51.828 --> 00:02:55.543
 sodium ions outside the cell, 

00:02:55.543 --> 00:02:57.749
 contrary to their concentration gradient. 

00:02:57.749 --> 00:02:59.583
 Sodium ions already have 

00:02:59.583 --> 00:03:01.278
 higher concentration outside, 

00:03:01.278 --> 00:03:02.996
 but the pump continues to export them out of the cage. 

00:03:02.996 --> 00:03:05.945
 To do this, she uses the ATP. 

00:03:05.945 --> 00:03:10.403
 It degrades ATP to ADP and phosphate group. 

00:03:10.403 --> 00:03:11.726
 Hydrolyzes it. 

00:03:11.726 --> 00:03:14.076
 Therefore, sometimes the sodium-potassium pump is called ATPase. 

00:03:14.076 --> 00:03:17.141
 This is an enzyme that helps break down ATP. 

00:03:17.141 --> 00:03:20.401
 But the sodium-potassium pump uses this energy to pump sodium ions 

00:03:20.401 --> 00:03:24.604
 outside the cell and potassium ions to the inside of the cell. 

00:03:24.604 --> 00:03:27.297
 Then we will see that the sodium ions, pumped out of the cage, 

00:03:27.297 --> 00:03:28.900
 form a reserve of potential energy. 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.381
 An electrochemical gradient has begun, 

00:03:33.381 --> 00:03:36.841
 which can later be used to carry out secondary active transport. 

00:03:36.841 --> 00:03:39.140
 We'll talk about this in seconds. 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:40.840
 This is the situation in animal cells. 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:46.110
 The analogue of plant cells, fungi and prokaryotes 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.522
 is the protonated ATPase or protonic nodule, 

00:03:50.522 --> 00:03:52.240
 which does the same thing but instead 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.982
 to do it in two directions, 

00:03:53.982 --> 00:03:56.350
 she pumped protons only 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.732
 outside the cell, contrary to their concentration gradient. 

00:03:59.732 --> 00:04:01.468
 Even if there is a higher concentration of protons 

00:04:01.468 --> 00:04:04.161
 outside the cell rather than in it, the pump will continue to export them from the crate. 

00:04:04.161 --> 00:04:07.853
 To do this, you must use the ATP to change it 

00:04:07.853 --> 00:04:10.105
 conformation in the appropriate manner. 

00:04:10.105 --> 00:04:11.823
 For this reason, this is called 

00:04:11.823 --> 00:04:16.908
 proton ATPase, and this is called sodium-potassium ATPase, 

00:04:16.908 --> 00:04:18.905
 our friend the sodium-potassium pump. 

00:04:18.905 --> 00:04:21.046
 This is called proton ATPase. 

00:04:21.046 --> 00:04:24.436
 You can not see these two structures in the same cage. 

00:04:24.436 --> 00:04:25.880
 I'll draw a line here, 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.408
 this will be a plant cell or a sponge, etc. 

00:04:30.408 --> 00:04:32.149
 This will be an animal cage. 

00:04:32.149 --> 00:04:35.428
 Both proton and sodium-potassium pumps use energy. 

00:04:35.428 --> 00:04:38.469
 They use the ATF directly to transport different things 

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:40.308
 contrary to their concentration gradient, 

00:04:40.308 --> 00:04:42.375
 so we call this process an active transport. 

00:04:42.375 --> 00:04:45.625
 Because we have these concentration gradients 

00:04:45.625 --> 00:04:48.899
 or these electrochemical gradients, 

00:04:48.899 --> 00:04:53.596
 they can also be used in other forms of active transport. 

00:04:53.596 --> 00:04:56.340
 This is called secondary active transport. 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.654
 This is my painting here 

00:04:58.654 --> 00:05:03.030
 the simporter. It is a symptom of sodium and glucose. 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.723
 It uses sodium ion 

00:05:05.723 --> 00:05:08.301
 in the direction of their concentration gradient. 

00:05:08.301 --> 00:05:09.787
 This gradient was created thanks to 

00:05:09.787 --> 00:05:11.876
 sodium-potassium pump. 

00:05:11.876 --> 00:05:13.599
 Sodium ions move in the direction of their concentration gradient, 

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:15.248
 but the energy from this movement can be used. 

00:05:15.248 --> 00:05:18.870
 You can imagine if we put a small wheel 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.843
 under a waterfall he will turn it. 

00:05:20.843 --> 00:05:24.466
 Similarly, the flow of sodium ions is used to transport glucose 

00:05:24.466 --> 00:05:25.933
 contrary to its concentration gradient. 

00:05:25.933 --> 00:05:28.069
 Glucose already exists 

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:30.252
 high concentration here 

00:05:30.252 --> 00:05:32.550
 and low here. But the sympatter carries glucose 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.227
 contrary to its concentration gradient. 

00:05:34.227 --> 00:05:36.108
 We are talking about this in other videos too. 

00:05:36.108 --> 00:05:39.104
 Another example of secondary active transport 

00:05:39.104 --> 00:05:41.982
 are the anti-supporters. 

00:05:41.982 --> 00:05:44.583
 In the symporter, which is a co-transporter, both types of particles 

00:05:44.583 --> 00:05:46.812
 go in the same direction, although one kind 

00:05:46.812 --> 00:05:48.414
 moves in the direction of its concentration gradient 

00:05:48.414 --> 00:05:50.341
 and drives the transportation, 

00:05:50.341 --> 00:05:51.734
 and the other type moves back to 

00:05:51.734 --> 00:05:52.988
 its concentration gradient. 

00:05:52.988 --> 00:05:54.594
 This is an active transport. 

00:05:54.594 --> 00:05:57.915
 With antiparts, the two different types of particles move in opposite directions. 

00:05:57.915 --> 00:06:01.193
 We can not have a sodium-calcium anti- 

00:06:01.193 --> 00:06:02.772
 where the sodium moves in the direction of 

00:06:02.772 --> 00:06:04.188
 its concentration gradient, 

00:06:04.188 --> 00:06:06.115
 which drives calcium ion extraction 

00:06:06.115 --> 00:06:09.927
 outside the cell, contrary to their concentration gradient. 

00:06:09.927 --> 00:06:11.460
 And repeat again, whenever something moves 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:13.387
 contrary to its concentration gradient, 

00:06:13.387 --> 00:06:15.964
 in this case these are the calcium ions, 

00:06:15.964 --> 00:06:18.008
 we have active transport. 

00:06:18.008 --> 00:06:20.771
 But because sodium ions 

00:06:20.771 --> 00:06:21.824
 and calcium ions move in different directions, 

00:06:21.824 --> 00:06:25.144
 we call this protein anti- 

00:06:25.144 --> 00:06:29.185
 while this one is a symphon. 

00:06:29.185 --> 00:06:31.948
 Now you might wonder if the sodium-potassium pump 

00:06:31.948 --> 00:06:33.299
 is not an antiporter. 

00:06:33.299 --> 00:06:35.760
 Sodium and potassium ions run in different directions. 

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.598
 The difference is that here 

00:06:37.598 --> 00:06:39.201
 we have primary active transport. 

00:06:39.201 --> 00:06:40.687
 For the sodium-potassium pump 

00:06:40.687 --> 00:06:42.219
 both types of particles move back to 

00:06:42.219 --> 00:06:44.169
 its concentration gradient. 

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:46.329
 And with a real anti- 

00:06:46.329 --> 00:06:47.931
 we have secondary active transport. 

00:06:47.931 --> 00:06:50.090
 One particle moves in the direction of its concentration gradient, 

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:52.203
 which delivers energy 

00:06:52.203 --> 00:06:55.709
 to transfer the other kind of particles back to their concentration gradient. 

00:06:55.709 --> 00:06:58.865
 I hope this video gave you a basic idea 

00:06:58.865 --> 00:07:00.567
 for different modes of transport 

00:07:00.567 --> 00:07:02.146
 and about how much 

00:07:02.146 --> 00:07:06.766
 complex, beautiful and enchanting 

00:07:06.766 --> 00:07:08.559
 are cell membranes and all 

00:07:08.559 --> 00:07:11.757
 various cell functions.
