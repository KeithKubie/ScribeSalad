(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THANK YOU.

00:00:28.961 --> 00:00:36.502 align:start position:0%
APPRECIATE IT.

00:00:36.535 --> 00:00:43.309 align:start position:0%
IT'S AMAZING A MOVIE LIKE THIS
WILL MAKE $200 MILLION.

00:00:43.342 --> 00:00:44.077 align:start position:0%
WHY DO YOU THINK THAT?

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.012 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; IT'S A GREAT MOVIE.

00:00:46.045 --> 00:00:48.848
IT'S COMMUNICATING WHAT WE AS
VETERANS HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO

00:00:48.881 --> 00:00:50.650 size:78% position:39%
COMMUNICATE FOR A DECADE.

00:00:50.683 --> 00:00:53.786 align:start position:0%
THERE ARE A LOT OF PIECES TO
PULL APART BUT AT THE END OF THE

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:54.654 align:start position:0%
DAY IT'S POWERFUL.

00:00:54.687 --> 00:00:57.256 align:start position:0%
THE VETERANS COMMUNITY IS BEHIND
IT.

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:00.626 align:start position:0%
IT FEELS AUTHENTIC AND REAL AND
IT'S ENTERTAINING.

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:01.928 size:78% position:39%
THAT HAS AMERICA TALKING.

00:01:01.961 --> 00:01:05.465
&gt;&gt; Larry: YOU FEEL IT'S THAT
SIMPLE LEVEL, IT'S JUST THAT WE

00:01:05.498 --> 00:01:07.800
WANT TO FEEL GOOD ABOUT IRAQ?

00:01:07.833 --> 00:01:12.305 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; AMERICA IS NOT THAT
INTERESTED IN IRAQ OR VETERANS

00:01:12.338 --> 00:01:13.573 align:start position:0%
ISSUES.

00:01:13.606 --> 00:01:16.709
WE HAD A V.A. SCANDAL AND NOBODY
GAVE A (BLEEP) BUT NOW EVERYONE

00:01:16.742 --> 00:01:17.677 align:start position:0%
IS FOCUSED.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.045 align:start position:0%
I'LL TAKE THAT.

00:01:19.078 --> 00:01:22.982 align:start position:0%
WE NEED TO FIND CONNECTIONS AND
THIS FILM DOES THAT.

00:01:23.015 --> 00:01:28.020 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Larry: IF IT GIVES
ATTENTION TO VETERANS THAT'S

00:01:28.053 --> 00:01:28.387 align:start position:0%
GOOD.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:29.555 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; RIGHT.

00:01:29.588 --> 00:01:34.427 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Larry: WERE YOUR CRITICISMS
THAT YOU FELT THE MOVIE WAS

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.731
INACCURATE OR THE PORTRAYAL OF
THE WAR WAS INACCURATE AND IT

00:01:38.764 --> 00:01:41.033 align:start position:0%
MADE A LOT OF MONEY?

00:01:41.066 --> 00:01:45.438
&gt;&gt; LOOK, IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A
DOCUMENT RI, BUT, I THINK, YOU

00:01:45.471 --> 00:01:48.875 align:start position:0%
KNOW, THE FACT THAT THEY LEFT
OUT THE PART THAT WE INVADED THE

00:01:48.908 --> 00:01:49.809 align:start position:0%
WRONG COUNTRY.

00:01:49.843 --> 00:01:53.846 align:start position:0%
I THINK THAT WAS AN IMPORTANT
PLOT ELEMENT.

00:01:53.879 --> 00:01:56.082 size:81% position:41%
&gt;&gt; A TINY LITTLE OMISSION?

00:01:56.115 --> 00:01:57.316 align:start position:0%
YEAH.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.054
LOOK, OBVIOUSLY, IT COMPLETELY
CHANGES THE ENTIRE COMPLEXION OF

00:02:02.087 --> 00:02:05.625 align:start position:0%
THE STORY IF YOU LEAVE OUT THE
CONTEXT OF THE MISSION.

00:02:05.658 --> 00:02:11.063 align:start position:0%
HAT'S ALL I WAS WANTING TO SAY. 
I DIDN'T WANT TO DISPARAGE

00:02:11.096 --> 00:02:15.768
VETERANS OR THE MILITARY BUT I
FELT LIKE IT LEFT OUT IMPORTANT

00:02:15.801 --> 00:02:17.002 align:start position:0%
HISTORICAL DETAIL.

00:02:17.036 --> 00:02:21.007
&gt;&gt; Larry: I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, BUT TO ME

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.312
IT MADE ME FEEL THAT, OKAY,
THAT'S WHAT MADE THAT GUY GO.

00:02:26.345 --> 00:02:29.615
NICK, DID YOU THINK IT'S HARD
FOR US TO BE ABLE TO RELATE TO

00:02:29.648 --> 00:02:31.884 align:start position:0%
VETERANS AND PEOPLE WHO ARE
ACTUALLY IN WAR?

00:02:31.917 --> 00:02:35.087
&gt;&gt; I DON'T THINK ANYBODY WILL
EVER BE ABLE TO RELATE UNLESS

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.357 align:start position:0%
YOU HAVE BEEN THERE AND SEEN
YOUR BEST FRIEND GET SHOT IN THE

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:39.191 align:start position:0%
FACE.

00:02:39.224 --> 00:02:40.392 align:start position:0%
I DON'T THINK YOU CAN RELATE TO
THAT.

00:02:40.426 --> 00:02:44.463 align:start position:0%
YOU CAN'T PUT THAT ON CAMERA OR
FILM AND I'VE SEEN IT QUITE

00:02:44.496 --> 00:02:45.063 align:start position:0%
OFTEN.

00:02:45.097 --> 00:02:46.832 size:81% position:41%
&gt;&gt; Larry: YOU'RE A SNIPER.

00:02:46.865 --> 00:02:47.866 align:start position:0%
MM-HMM.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.637 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Larry: YOU HAVE THE MOST
UNRELATABLE -- SNIPER,

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.141 align:start position:0%
PRESIDENT, LATE NIGHT TALK SHOW
HOST --

00:02:55.174 --> 00:02:56.909 align:start position:0%
(LAUGHTER)
-- THOSE ARE THE MOST

00:02:56.942 --> 00:02:58.844 align:start position:0%
UNRELATABLE THINGS.

00:02:58.877 --> 00:03:01.080 align:start position:0%
WHY DO YOU THINK IT IS SO
UNRELATABLE?

00:03:01.113 --> 00:03:06.419 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; OUR SKILL SET, OUR JOB IS
HARD TO PUT IN WORDS.

00:03:06.452 --> 00:03:08.020 align:start position:0%
WE'RE SENT OUT THERE TO KILL
PEOPLE.

00:03:08.053 --> 00:03:09.689
THAT'S OUR SOLE PURPOSE IN LIFE.

00:03:09.722 --> 00:03:11.891 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Larry: MAN!

00:03:11.924 --> 00:03:14.994 align:start position:0%
NO, BUT WHEN YOU SAY THAT --
&gt;&gt; IT'S HEAVY.

00:03:15.027 --> 00:03:16.596
&gt;&gt; Larry: IT IS HEAVY, RIGHT?

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:20.132 align:start position:0%
I DON'T LOOK AT THE ASPECT
BEHIND IT AS FAR AS, YOU KNOW,

00:03:20.165 --> 00:03:21.734 size:84% position:42%
I'M GOING TO KILL THIS GUY.

00:03:21.767 --> 00:03:24.837
HE'S NOTHING BUT A TARGET AT
THAT POINT AND IF I CAN PREVENT

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:31.844
ONE OF MY FRIENDS FROM DYING,
RIGHT, I'M GOING TO PUT ONE

00:03:31.877 --> 00:03:32.978 align:start position:0%
THROUGH YOU.

00:03:33.012 --> 00:03:43.022 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Larry: IS IT LOOKING AT HOW
THIS HAS MADE, IN A SENSE?

00:03:43.055 --> 00:03:50.930 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Larry: IS IT LOOKING AT HOW
THIS HAS MADE, IN A SENSE?

00:03:50.963 --> 00:03:57.203 align:start position:0%
AS A MOVIE GOER, DO YOU NOT CARE
ABOUT BEING ABLE TO RELATE?

00:03:57.236 --> 00:04:01.274 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I THOUGHT IT WAS COOL TO SHOW
WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO COME HOME

00:04:01.307 --> 00:04:02.308 align:start position:0%
FROM WAR.

00:04:02.342 --> 00:04:04.877 align:start position:0%
THE FEMALE LEAD IN IT WAS KIND
OF ONE DIMENSIONAL.

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.346 align:start position:0%
IT WAS THE SAME THING OVER AND
OVER AGAIN.

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:08.714 align:start position:0%
LIKE, DON'T GO TO WAR!

00:04:08.747 --> 00:04:09.815 align:start position:0%
DON'T GO TO WAR!

00:04:09.848 --> 00:04:12.351 align:start position:0%
DON'T GO TO WAR!

00:04:12.384 --> 00:04:14.854 align:start position:0%
I'M, LIKE, THIS IS THE BEST
SHOOTER IN THE WORLD!

00:04:14.887 --> 00:04:17.490 align:start position:0%
HE'S GOT TO GO TO WAR!

00:04:17.523 --> 00:04:22.895 size:84% position:42%
SHE'S LIKE A BROKEN RECORD.

00:04:22.928 --> 00:04:26.999
&gt;&gt; Larry: YEAH, I THOUGHT PHIL
WAS SUPPOSED TO DIRECT THE MOVIE

00:04:27.032 --> 00:04:28.467 align:start position:0%
AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
DIFFERENT.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.838 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; BUT IT'S CLINT EASTWOOD FILM,
A BLACK AND WHITE VIEW OF THE

00:04:32.871 --> 00:04:38.744
WORLD, CHRIS KYLE'S VIEW OF THE
WAR WAS GEORGE BUSH'S AND IT'S

00:04:38.777 --> 00:04:41.447 align:start position:0%
NOT MINE AND NOT EVERYONE
ELSE'S --

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:42.748
&gt;&gt; YOU LIKE THAT PERSPECTIVE.

00:04:42.781 --> 00:04:46.719
I LIKE THAT PERSPECTIVE TO BE
TOLD BECAUSE IT'S PART OF THE

00:04:46.752 --> 00:04:47.887 align:start position:0%
LARGER STORY.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.056 align:start position:0%
IF IT GETS MILLIONS OF PEOPLE TO
UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'VE GONE

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:51.290 align:start position:0%
THROUGH, WE'LL TAKE IT.

00:04:51.324 --> 00:04:55.528
&gt;&gt; Larry: NICK, HOW MUCH OF AN
ISSUE -- GO AHEAD IF YOU WANT TO

00:04:55.561 --> 00:04:56.128 align:start position:0%
CLAP.

00:04:56.162 --> 00:04:57.230 align:start position:0%
(APPLAUSE)
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU.

00:04:57.263 --> 00:05:01.867 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Larry: HOW MUCH OF AN ISSUE
IS THE PTSD PART OF IT?

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.536 size:88% position:44%
&gt;&gt; I THINK IT'S A BIG ISSUE.

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:09.108
MY LAST DEPLOYMENT, IN FOUR
MONTHS, I KILLED 33 GUYS AS A

00:05:09.141 --> 00:05:09.508 align:start position:0%
SNIPER.

00:05:09.542 --> 00:05:10.509 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Larry: 33.

00:05:10.542 --> 00:05:11.310 align:start position:0%
YEAH.

00:05:11.343 --> 00:05:13.679 align:start position:0%
THE BODIES DIDN'T MATTER, I'M
NOT --

00:05:13.712 --> 00:05:16.015 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Larry: YOU'RE NOT ASSESSING
ANY THREATS NOW?

00:05:16.048 --> 00:05:17.750 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; NO, I'M A NICE GUY.

00:05:17.783 --> 00:05:24.090 align:start position:0%
(LAUGHTER)
I DON'T HAVE ANY REGRETS ABOUT

00:05:24.123 --> 00:05:25.258 align:start position:0%
KILLING ANYONE.

00:05:25.291 --> 00:05:28.294 align:start position:0%
I REGRET NOT BEING ABLE TO SAVE
THE GUY WHO SAVED MY LIFE.

00:05:28.327 --> 00:05:33.566 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Larry: THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY
IN THE MOVIE.

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:38.204
&gt;&gt; BENJAMIN WAS 21 YEARS OLD,
SAVED MY LIFE AND I WATCHED HIM

00:05:38.237 --> 00:05:39.238 size:88% position:44%
TAKE ONE FIVE MINUTES LATER.

00:05:39.271 --> 00:05:42.708 size:75% position:38%
&gt;&gt; Larry: DO YOU HAVE TO
COMPARTMENTALIZE THAT?

00:05:42.741 --> 00:05:48.280
I WAS TAKEN BY HOW IF YOU DON'T
COMPARTMENTALIZE THAT YOU WILL

00:05:48.313 --> 00:05:51.350 align:start position:0%
BE (BLEEP) ON A MUCH FASTER
ROAD.

00:05:51.383 --> 00:05:58.124
BECAUSE PART OF YOU HAS TO BE
MESSED UP ANYWAY -- NOT SAYING

00:05:58.157 --> 00:06:04.029 align:start position:0%
YOU'RE MISSED UP -- BUT YOU HAVE
TO BE KIND OF A DICK.

00:06:04.062 --> 00:06:09.602 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; NO, NO, WHEN I GOT OUT, THE
PTSD THING WAS REAL AND WAS

00:06:09.635 --> 00:06:10.670 align:start position:0%
THERE.

00:06:10.703 --> 00:06:17.476 align:start position:0%
I WOULD WAKE UP AT 6:00 A.M. AND
DRINK TILL 4:00 P.M.

00:06:17.509 --> 00:06:21.847
I DON'T REMEMBER DRINKING WATER
FOR TWO YEARS, JUST ALCOHOL, TO

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.083 align:start position:0%
TRY TO FORGET.

00:06:24.116 --> 00:06:27.686
&gt;&gt; Larry: MATT, DO YOU THINK
THESE MOVIES MAKES IT HARDER OR

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:29.688 align:start position:0%
EASIER TO KNOW WHAT THEY'RE
GOING THROUGH?

00:06:29.721 --> 00:06:32.024 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; IT HELPS.

00:06:32.057 --> 00:06:35.161 align:start position:0%
THE MOVIE CERTAINLY SHOWED HE
HAD A STRUGGLE.

00:06:35.194 --> 00:06:38.764
IT WASN'T AS OVERT AS YOU WOULD
HAVE THOUGHT, BUT I THINK IT DID

00:06:38.797 --> 00:06:41.500 align:start position:0%
DEFINITELY ADDRESS SOME OF THAT
IN THE MOVIE.

00:06:41.533 --> 00:06:44.637 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; THE COMING HOME PART IS VERY
POWERFUL.

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:50.943
I HAD A LOT OF CIVILIANS SAY TO
ME, NOW I CAN START TOWNS WHAT

00:06:50.976 --> 00:06:52.278 align:start position:0%
YOU WENT THROUGH.

00:06:52.311 --> 00:06:55.448 align:start position:0%
NOBODY EVER ASKS US HOW MANY
PEOPLE WE SAVED.

00:06:55.481 --> 00:06:59.819
IT'S NOT THE COMPLETE STORY,
BUTS A VERY COMPLEX THING THAT

00:06:59.852 --> 00:07:02.988 align:start position:0%
HOLLYWOOD WILL NEVER
ENCAPSULATE.

00:07:03.021 --> 00:07:06.225
BUT WE'RE HERE ON A COMEDY SHOW
TALKING ABOUT THE WAR AGAIN AND

00:07:06.258 --> 00:07:09.361 align:start position:0%
VETERANS ISSUES AND WE HOPE THAT
DISCUSSION WILL CONTINUE.

00:07:09.394 --> 00:07:12.731 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Larry: DO YOU THINK A
DIFFERENT WAR WOULD HAVE MADE A

00:07:12.764 --> 00:07:14.133 align:start position:0%
LOT OF DIFFERENCE?

00:07:14.166 --> 00:07:16.602 align:start position:0%
PEOPLE HAVE PARTICULAR ISSUES
ABOUT THIS WAR.

00:07:16.635 --> 00:07:19.972 align:start position:0%
IT'S HARD FOR US TO
COMPARTMENTALIZE SOMETIMES.

00:07:20.005 --> 00:07:23.375 align:start position:0%
DO YOU THINK THAT'S A BIG
PROBLEM?

00:07:23.408 --> 00:07:24.609 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; MAYBE.

00:07:24.643 --> 00:07:27.713
I THINK THE REASON WHY WE WENT
TO IRAQ, I DIDN'T CARE, I SIGNED

00:07:27.746 --> 00:07:28.380 align:start position:0%
UP IN 2004.

00:07:28.414 --> 00:07:29.982
&gt;&gt; Larry: WHY DID YOU SIGN UP?

00:07:30.015 --> 00:07:35.721 size:81% position:41%
I SAW THE TWIN TOWERS FALL
AND A FEW LAIRTS I WAS IN

00:07:35.754 --> 00:07:39.859
AFGHANISTAN, SO I DEPLOYED
MULTIPLE TIMES TO EACH, THREE

00:07:39.892 --> 00:07:42.561 size:84% position:42%
TIMES TO IRAQ, TWO TIMES TO
AFGHANISTAN, SOMETHING LIKE

00:07:42.594 --> 00:07:43.428 align:start position:0%
THAT.

00:07:43.462 --> 00:07:47.933 align:start position:0%
(APPLAUSE)
&gt;&gt; Larry: WELL, DO YOU WANT TO

00:07:47.966 --> 00:07:49.802 align:start position:0%
SAY ONE LAST THING?

00:07:49.835 --> 00:07:55.341 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; YEAH, NOW THAT THEY'RE
ALAPPLAUDING, I JUST WANTED TO

00:07:55.374 --> 00:07:57.409 align:start position:0%
ALSO ADD -- NO.

00:07:57.442 --> 00:08:01.814 align:start position:0%
(LAUGHTER)
I THINK YOU GUYS DO AN AMAZING

00:08:01.847 --> 00:08:02.948 align:start position:0%
JOB.

00:08:02.982 --> 00:08:08.420
MY FATHER IS PAKISTANI, AND I
GREW UP WITH HIM IN CANADA

00:08:08.453 --> 00:08:12.057 align:start position:0%
LOOKING AT THE TV GOING, OH,
THESE, (BLEEP).

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:16.262 align:start position:0%
AND MY FATHER IN LAW SERVED OVER
TWO DECADES.

00:08:16.295 --> 00:08:24.003
IN GETTING TO KNOW HIM, IT'S NOT
A CARICATURE, THE GUN SLINGERS

00:08:24.036 --> 00:08:26.872 size:75% position:38%
VERSUS THE OTHER PEOPLE.

00:08:26.905 --> 00:08:31.777
THE MOVIE WAS A LITTLE BIT LIKE
DUCK HUNT BUT INSTEAD OF DUCKS,
