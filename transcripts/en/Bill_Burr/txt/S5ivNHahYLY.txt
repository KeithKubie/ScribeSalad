I got a table read for episode eight of Season Three, eight of 10 where 80% of the way there for you mathletes out there. Very excited. Starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel before the horrific editing process begins. And uh, you know, we'll just be working for another year and uh, get everything all locked and I'll have maybe three days off and then we'll start all over again. Bump pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump.

Speaker 1:          00:01:01       Oh, Badu Ludo too. Um, what's going on? How are you? I, yeah, how's your week going? Is that all right? I'm actually a have to do the table read. I'm going to bright some more shit. And then late night I'm going to be traveling up to Toronto where I'm doing three shows at the Sony fucking sat up Toronto, one of my favorite cities. You know, I like, I like a nice small city, you know, everybody knows everybody's name. That's what I love about Toronto. You know what I mean? It's not this fucking monstrosity with a ton of traffic. Everybody's done the earth now. I actually really like, you know, it's the biggest God damn city, you know, basically for, uh, people in the United States. All right. Who never look up when they're walking around so they never see Canada. Right. They dumb like me. Where north to you is looking up cause you can't fucking, you have no spatial relation to how you stand on this planet.

Speaker 1:          00:01:56       Um, auto was the capital of Canada, but Toronto is, is like, it's kind of like how Albany is like the capital of New York, but it's all about New York City. Albany is the capital of New York state, I should say, and share. They have the egg, you know, they have a fucking minor league hockey team. There's a lot to like an Albany got some beautiful theaters. You know what I mean? They got that fucking, we used to build shit here before it all left, you know, for 30 years. And now we're coming back around with a little tech savvy horse shit, like all these fucking rust belt cities. Not Saying Albany was in the rust belt, but all I can look at, look at what's going on in Pittsburgh. The revitalization of the downtown area is all these fucking nerds who make websites and uh, robots and you know, synthetic heroin, whatever the fuck it is these nerds do for these sociopath's, for these fucking sociopath.

Speaker 1:          00:02:55       That's how it works. Nerds, I've said that my act nerds make fucking sociopath dreams come true. That's what the fuck they do. Okay. Sociopath's are crazy enough to think shit, but they need a nerd to actually make it a fucking reality in nerds do none of the background to backbone, I should say. They don't have the backbone to tell fucking sociopath's. You know what dude, I know I, I could figure out how to do that, but I'm not going to make that. They won't do it. They won't do it. And they're all sitting around making robots that they can fuck right now to get rid of that guilt. Okay. And we're taking collars were taking callers will read them live. Um, Toronto. What of Doing Toronto? Toronto. Sorry. Just had some fucking corn checks. Um, by the way, I haven't been working out cause my cap was fucked up and I'm, I'm still dropping weight just by not boozing and eating like a fucking angel.

Speaker 1:          00:03:56       Do you know what I have every fucking night? Like probably four out of seven nights a week at this premade to bully salad that has this little, I don't know if it's cous cous I don't know what the fuck it is. Tomatoes and onions in it. And then I put a little fucking chicken in there and I just eat that shit. Like the fuel that it is, I just shovel it into my mouth to stop the, the hunger feeling. And it's around five 36 and then I owed do anything. And if I get a little extra hug, did a set tonight, you know, burned a little calories. Every once in a while I'll come home. I just have a fucking bullet cereal and then that's it. And I have to tell you, dude, I gotta tell you, I've got on the scale today, all fucking Billy alabaster, freckled fat tits was down to 175 pounds. I was up to a buck 85 I was a buck 90 last summer, so I'm down to one 75 my fighting weight is one 72 I got this acting Gig in two fucking weeks and I've been unable to work out my fucking rotator cuff is all fucked up again. I was imitating this blowup doll on stage and I stuck my fucking arm out and it started burning again. It's like, really?

Speaker 2:          00:05:06       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:05:07       I'm a chef, I'm a God damn man. I have to, you know what I have to do? I have to go to a physical therapist and I have to, I have to start being a better patient. Like, you know, when they tell me to do some shit, I need to go fucking do the shit. That's what the fuck I need to do to finally get past the shit. Cause I haven't worked out. You know, I used to be pull up guy. I got a bet with Paul Versey that when I'm 70 years old, I'm still be able to do 10 pull ups. I want you to be able to do that. When I turned 50 the way this is fucking going on. What I'm trying to say here, people is I'm falling apart. I know there's a lot of benefits out there. Okay? From, you know, people's who's fucking, you know, heads were fused together with their brother would have whatever your fucking causes.

Speaker 1:          00:05:45       All right. What about broken down middle aged, white male heterosexuals. What about that? What do all about? All of us. Okay. After half a century of privilege, you know, what about us with our sore calf and our soil, right shoulder. What about that? How people, you know, I want to know how much you care. Um, I just want to turn a fucking corner with this goddamn thing. You can't do it. I haven't been able to do whatever the other rotated cuffs at the tough, you know, they gay kind of fucking linger. I know, I know. I'm living with it. Um, so my name is, I've been talking to some people recently and you know, I've always just joked around about pharmaceutical companies. I keep hearing this rumor that they started the of this fucking heroin epidemic and everything. And I just found out, you know, someone from like the town I grew up in 23 years old just fucking died of a heroin overdose.

Speaker 1:          00:06:42       I grew up in fucking Mayberry and uh, someone was talking about basically all these fucking things, oxy, Percocet, all of that shit. It has the exact same fucking addictive qualities, chemical makeup, all of that shit is heroin. It's just like a synthetic heroin and a difference between an opiate and an opioid. And opiate is natural. Like those poppy fucking things you always see in those chuck Norris movies. Right? And then now the poppy seeds there and then in a opiate is just like manufactured nerds. Nerds, you fucking go to the doctor like me. I fucked up my calf. This fucking guy goes, all right, I'm going to give you a painkiller and I'm going to give you an anti inflammatory. So I go to the fucking pharmaceutical. Pharmacists are fucking hilarious. The fact that they get to dress up like their doctors is one of the funniest fucking things.

Speaker 1:          00:07:39       It's like, what are you doing in there? It's like you're basically working the Starbucks of the medical field. You know what? What do you do? What the fuck you do it back? You should get me a cup of coffee with my fucking pills. They always act like they're so God damn, you know, just under the gun when you're back there, you're counting aspirin. I get, you know what? Enough way. You know what the fucking worst thing is is when somebody like, it's like running. There's nothing. People think cops are bad. The worst thing you want to have fucking attitude. Get a rent a cop. Cars in the, in the, in the back of his head. He knows he's not a real cops and now he's got something to prove. A cop's cop, you know what I mean? Say He's, he knows he's, you know, he's got a gun, he's got a fucking license to kill him.

Speaker 1:          00:08:29       I'll stick this right in the back of your fucking mouth and I'll pull the trigger and go down and go to a sandwich and I even think about it. Right? Fuck around cup. Where does he get maybe as a taser, it got a little fucking stick. So he's gotta be some cut and run around taking some little fucking kid's skateboard away, right? They, they, they, they dabble in that shit. So always that type of shit, you know what I mean? It's like if you're going to get a threesome, right, there's always the beautiful girl and then the other one is fucking annoying. Who's got to start running a Yap. Even if she is beautiful, she knows she's not as good looking as the other one. That brings up the insecurity and then she won't shut the fuck up. She tries to be funny or something like that is stupid, sloppy tits hanging out. It's like, what are you doing?

Speaker 1:          00:09:13       I don't care how fucking ugly you are. You don't think I'm gonna work my way through you to get to her to shut up. I don't know what the fuck this has to do with pharmaceutical companies. Okay. But I know when I went to this pharmacy with my calf problem, all right, I was supposed to get, he said a painkiller. I'm like, well, I'm not fucking with those. I'm not fucking with those. I'm not getting heroin in a fucking synthetic form and start tailoring and look how I handle beaus people, or I should say, look how Booz handled me. Okay. Who's like triple g walking down Alvarez the other day. That's what fucking booze does to me. A backing up the whole fucking fight. Maybe once a while I plant and I fucking throw a cup of combinations. You know what the bottle does? It eats it up. Hey eats, sit upright. But my wife's sitting there, gone here, not an alcoholic has me winning one 18, one 10. Figure that one out. So I fucking go in to a cvs. Right. Which is a great place. If you need to buy somebody a card, you know, get a gallon of root beer and get some fucking heroin. Right. Maybe some shit and fucking, I don't know, shaving cream or some shit. Right? So

Speaker 1:          00:10:26       the fucking, you know, rent a fucking Dr. Guy behind there. He fucking, you know, it's, you know, it's going to be like 20 minutes. So I was gonna be like 20 minutes. All right. Okay. Whatever. I get it. Yeah. There's a lot of different colored pills back there. You got to look at your pill chart. See which color the blue ones are for boys. And the red ones are for old people, whatever that sciences.

Speaker 2:          00:10:48       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:10:48       They're, they're back. They're acting like they make the pills. I need to shut the fuck up about pharmacists. I got to read up on him here far months. Let me finish selling the story. Um, so the guy finally comes back, right. I'm standing by in all these cute fucking old people, you know what I mean? Fucking people with all that God damn pills for the ailments and shit. Um, and uh, he gives me two vials and I go, okay, what's this one? He goes, those are the pain pills, painkillers. And I'm like, all right, well, I'm not messing with that. And I, and I go, what are these? And he goes, those, uh, those are more pain pills. And I'm like, well, what about the anti inflammatory? He goes, oh, it's, it's in these painkillers. And it's just like, oh, I don't want that. I just want the antiinflammatory.

Speaker 1:          00:11:38       But you know what it is, is he's fucking drug companies. They're drug dealers. So they get, they want to get me hooked. So you want the antiinflammatory, you've got to do a little fucking synthetic heroin one with it. Okay. Now base in all of this on my own fucking paranoia, in like two conversations I've had over the last 48 hours. Okay? And now I'm in my fucking house, like in that movie, Beautiful Mind. I'm taking fucking, I'm cutting out headlines from papers that I don't read and upon on Blinken and all together and I'm presenting it as fact to you. Okay. Pharmacists, what do they do? All right. They advise physicians and other health practitioners on the selections, dosage interactions and side effects of medication. They also plan and monitor drug programs or regimens. Pharmacists, council, hospitalized patients on the use of drugs and on their use at home when the patients are discharged. Yeah, you made it the back of the CVS. Okay. Take two of these twice a day. Take one on the third day and then flush the rest of it, right?

Speaker 2:          00:12:50       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:12:51       Pharmacists

Do they do, I said level and immediately of education immediately popped up. Doctoral or professional degree. All right. Here's what you got to do. There's no way this is, no, no. This can't be more than a two year fucking program. Okay. Here you go. Here's a video on how to be a fucking pharmacist. It's a fucking cartoon character in a pharmacist and a pharmacy.

Non-Specified two years of undergraduate study. I got four is required to apply for pharmacy school. Okay.

You take a test and then your licensed experienced clerkship residency's fellowships. This is bullshit. Key skills, attention to detail. Oh, did I say for Percocet? I met one a and an extensive knowledge of drugs and interactions. Okay, there you go. I'll give you that one. Research, communication, interpersonal and customer service skills. Job Outlook. 3% growth. Medium annual salary. $121,500 given up for the pharmacist. Jesus. No. One of their lab coats is so damn clean, Huh? Back. They're raking in the fucking money. I'll tell you if you start selling some of those drugs on this side to the people that you get addictive in the front. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:14:46       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:14:46       Do you know, I'm just saying you get those fake tits. They're sweet. [inaudible] um, I had an amazing week this week. I actually got to a, I got to fucking play drums for about two and a half hours with a tremendous musician who is just like, hey man, do you want to fucking jam? And I was like, yeah man, I want to jam. And I didn't even know what that meant. I thought it was going to go down there and just be like, hey, you do, you know, highway to hell. That's what I thought it was going to be. I showed up, this guy was doing that yellow have Reggie watts thing where yeah, we fucking builds up, he'll make like drum sounds and then I'll make guitar songs and then whatever and whatever, whatever. And then he starts fucking singing over it. Right. Um, he was doing that but with like a guitar and he was just creating these songs.

Speaker 1:          00:15:35       And then I had to jump in and play drums and it was just a whole other fucking animal. And I realized that all these years I thought that I played drums. I didn't, I like do drums. I was talking about somebody who bought that today. I like do drums. I don't play them. You know what I mean? Playing him is what I attempted to do the other night and failed horrifically. See if you fucking listen to a song and you listen to what the drummer's doing, you figure it out, then you play it. That's like getting all the answers to the test and then the drum part fits, fix fits because the other guy already came up with it. But you, somebody just starts playing you a piece of music he never heard of. And then you have to actually come up with the drum part. You are, um, the level of musician that you are as immediately exposed and there's nowhere for you to hide. And I was just, I, we had a great time. I had such a fucking fun time doing it, but I was actually thinking, I was like, wow man. I knew I sucked. I didn't know I sucked. Wow. Um, but it was a, it was so much fun and the person was really, really generous and I want to thank him for a fucking

Speaker 2:          00:16:48       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:16:48       Hang on that long with me. But it was such a fun fucking time and it was also, you know, it was a very huge learning. So it wasn't, you know, it was a few moments. I actually thought I played pretty good. But other than that I was just like, Jesus Christ just kept trying to do stuff and then, you know, you just make that face. Like I'm not bad at that too. I don't know if you professional drummers can try and fill and you don't you fuck up, you know, do you make a face? Cause I always do. I make that, oops, you don't have face John Paul Jones made when him and bought him fucked up in a song remains the same. They came in a little too early. But John Paul Jones says back to the crowd and you see bon and looked down and he just kind of shakes his head for half a second and then they got it right. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:17:36       I dunno what I'm talking about. I'm just trying to fill up this fucking half hour cause I have no fucking time. I have no time in my life anymore. You know what I mean? I don't, I need to, I need a pharmacist in my fucking life. You know what, you know, I don't take pills aside from the fact that I don't want to get addicted is, uh, what I like about drinking is I enjoy the effort it takes to get the buzz. You know what I mean? Like I don't like, uh, like we just seem so easy, especially now with all these fucking vaporizers and stuff. I'll eat you inhale, you're doing that anyways. Then you just sit there and all say, hey man, blah blah blah, but fucking drinking. You gotta drink it.

Speaker 3:          00:18:17       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:18:17       If you're going to get shit faced just drinking beer, that's a lot of Goddamn work. You've got dre, he drink at least six of them feel lightweight, upwards of fucking, you know, I dunno, 36 to 40 depending on, how bout you Drake. So anyways, look at this shit. So I went to this um, this website and it was like, what is the difference between heroin and Percocet? And this is like fucking nuts. This is like people who were like on these drugs talking in this, this chat room. Like what is the difference? Someone told me I should buy some versus buying 30 milligrams of oxycodone because it should be a lot cheaper. So what are your opinions?

Speaker 1:          00:19:04       Somebody taught, basically told this person who is addicted to these, this fucking oxy, they should now get heroin. So this guy just, this is such like, like they talking about cars or some shit. This person says, well they are both strong narcotics. Heroin is an opiate and oxycodone is an opiod, which is basically in layman terms, opioids are synthetics and opiates occur naturally. And the opium poppy, in my opinion, heroin is stronger. But then that's countered by the fact that you'll never know street heroins purity. And you always know what's in an oxy, am I saying that right? Oxy coating tablet, do you buy 30 milligrams of 30 milligram tablets? You know how strong it is. Heroin purity can go up and down and they cut it with all kinds of shit. These are fucking people doing hard drugs. First of all, I got to give it up that they could still fucking have the sense to go into a chat room and compare fucking notes.

Speaker 1:          00:19:58       So does a lot of people talking about this, but not in, not on CNN, on Fox News or any of those other fucking so-called news channels where they're all bought and paid for and they're not going to do this fucking story because you know, the same companies that get everybody allegedly got everybody addicted or advertising on their fucking channels. Um, so Ohio is suing drug companies over their role in creating an opioid epidemic, which has led to an opiate epidemic. Uh, cause after a while they won't fill you fuck a prescription. So NPRs Robert Siegel talks with Ohio attorney general. Did you get to the bullshit here? The state of Ohio figures? It's home to 200,000 opiod addicts. That's the equivalent. The population of Akron overdoses are so common. The morgues in some Ohio counties lack for space. Today's Ohio, uh, today, Ohio's attorney general announced he's bringing a suit against five drug manufacturers accusing them of misrepresenting the risk of prescription opioids and helping to fuel an addiction epidemic in this state.

Speaker 1:          00:21:09       Yeah. Like these people are like murdering people. If what they're saying is true, that's what the fuck they're doing in these fucking cunts. These corporate cons, they go to bed fucking silk, pajamas, indoor and outdoor pool is everybody's fucking dying. I don't know the uh, population control person in me sorta like I'm on both sides of this thing. It's like this is fucking terrible that do to people. Then it's also like, well, there's 20 people on the planet, so thank God these fucking psychos are killing people so they can get a bigger house. I heard the like, you know, any doctors listen to this shit anonymously want to write in. I mean I heard like they have like these pharmaceutical companies see, hire these hot chicks to walk around to bring in the new drugs wearing like fuck me pumps and stuff. Is that true or did it was I have asleep sleep watching some red shoe diary one night.

Speaker 1:          00:22:00       I thought it was in this industry. I have no idea. So the State Attorney General Mike, the win or, or d wine is he known as he's known around the way joins us now from Columbus. Welcome to the program. Once again, I'll fuck this is the, uh, somebody who the fuck would read this is this for like deaf people who can't hear NPR. Mike [inaudible] good to be back. Thank you very much Segal.

Speaker 1:          00:22:55       US officials are starting to treat opiod companies like big tobacco. About time and how the city is suing pharmaceutical. Don't vilify drug companies says cvs. Really? Oh Jesus. He's how button paid for these fuckers? Well, but you don't mind when I hear their opinion first. Only America would vilify the people that invented Viagra. That's what happened. That's what's happening. Parentheses sort of. They just bought back everything they just said this week is the FDA holds very public hearings and the potential health risks of popular prescription pain medication such as Cox, two inhibitors, Pfizer, the company that makes one of those medicines.

Everybody. Lyft knows that drivers are what keeps them moving. So they do everything they can to make sure their drivers are happy on every trip.

Like those slave driving bastards over at Uw, at Uber, you want to go with Lyft, you get tips at this fucking place. The only tips you get it over is, hey, here's a tip. You ain't make it shittier. So shut the fuck up and keep driving. That's how they treat him over there, right?

Speaker 1:          00:31:10       Lyft is the North Sea. I mean, Uber is the North Korea of ride sharing apps. Uh, live was the first to offer in APP tipping. Can imagine a few are fucking Lyft driver and you picked up Kim Jong Il, or maybe just somebody who look like, you know what I mean? You're like, well, he wouldn't be over here. He doesn't like us. Maybe that's just some fat Asian kid who likes to have a Hitler youth haircut. I don't know where you go. And serve to the airport. Live was the first offer. Inept tipping.

They should go after fucking fossil fuel companies at some point. That's going to fucking happen, you know? But she can never get the people that made the decision. Because what you're doing is you're, you're suing a corporation, which is nameless and faceless. And then all those people who made those fucking decisions collectively turn your key. They all turned their fucking key. I was following orders. All of those fucking cuts when you go to sue the company or completely insulated and they will be giving themselves raises with their blood money. And then when they go to fucking attack the company, everybody just fucking walks away. It's like, well, I work there. I am not, you know, I'm not the corporation.

Speaker 5:          00:33:58       Okay.

Alright, Bill loved the podcast, freelance every week. Uh, they're much appreciated, Yada, Yada, Yada. I thought you might like this link as you're a big conspiracy theory, a big conspiracy theorist. You mean? He said it's the former Canadian defense administrator. No Canadian defense minister giving some bold claims about several species of aliens living among us and actually working with elements in the government. Uh, not only that, but a shadowy cabal. C A, B, a, l, k, but k bow, I dunno, comprised of the council on foreign relations, the build the Burgers, the trilateral commission. That should add a hyphen in it. You caught the international banking cartel. Uh, the oil cartels, members of various intelligent organizes the select members and military Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah. One world government. Check it out, sir. The last thing I'm going to do is look at this. I'll put the link up there. Ah, fuck it. I'll look at it right now. This shit just freaks me out and makes me depressed because there's nothing I could do about it. Okay. Now, how is this going to help me, sir? If I find out there's actually aliens living among us, talking to international bankers, you know, am I gonna come walking in, bursting into their meeting like the end of a feel good movie?

Speaker 7:          00:38:09       Yeah.

Speaker 8:          00:38:09       You know, like, hey man, the people have spoken and they like me. All right, here we go. I got it right here. Uh, Canada's former minister of national defense, Paul Haler testifies at the citizens hearing on disclosure, where the fuck am I last month in Washington DC that aliens are living among us and that it is likely at least two of them are working with the u s government. Oh, this guy sounds like he's out of his fucking mind. Ah, let, let's, let's, let's, let's kind of flip the script here. Let's say you're an alien. All right. Whoever's listening to this still, who believes in aliens who was in blogging about my reaction to the blogger? Um, can you go to ego to another fucking solar system now the galaxy, whatever the fucking terminology is, and you land there, okay, what are you going to do other than try and get blended it. Blend in so people don't chop your fucking alien head off.

Speaker 8:          00:39:13       Like how exactly did this fucking alien get? Infiltrate the government. This is like Mr. Smith goes to Washington. The alien just lands and just goes, okay. Ah, right. I mean, how come he didn't do this in Argentina? He picks the United States, goes right into fucking Washington DC walks into the Capitol building and somebody filibustering so they can't make an electric car or whatever comes right out on the house floor and then does what, you know, security comes up, tries to shoot him and he just puts his hands up and their guns turned into like chocolate bars or fall to the ground and then for some reason everybody in their suits doesn't scramble and freak the fuck out, you know?

Speaker 8:          00:40:04       No, you just fucking walk out there and say, hey, what's going on? Relax, relax, relax. It's a simple technology that you guys will discover. If you become friends with me, hired attorney could fucking gone into some melted shit that doesn't let people shoot you. I am from the planet. Zol Tar. Right. It always begins with z. How does that work? Like if you were a fucking alien and you went to another God damn plan it. Exactly, I guess. Okay. You'd be like, all right, if there's a bunch of different nations, which one seems to be running? Shit. I got to chop the head off and you're just going to want you and you and a buddy till you

Speaker 8:          00:40:48       gonna walk in fucking arm and arm and do what? Yeah. Hey, listen. Uh, I think just the simple fact that worry we were able to get here. You know, the kind of firepower that we're capable of. Um, for some fucking reason we want to take over this planet or we want you guys to do shit the way we feel that the it should be done. Who? Who would want that fucking headache? I don't, I don't know that I believe this shit. Anyways, he believes Hellyer whose beliefs are extra life, extra terrestrial life. And you are so your foes are well established. Made the statements at the nongovernmental hearings chaired by six former US congressman and aimed at according to the events website, doing what the u s congress had failed to do for 45 years. Seek out the facts surrounding the most important issue of this or any other time. Evidence pouring towards an extraterrestrial presence, engaging the human race. All right. You know what, even I have my limits when it comes to that type of shit. All right. I don't think that's the most pressing thing I would say. Yeah, I was fucking up the environment, world population and that type of suit. Shit, it's a little more, unless you want to throw more people from other galaxies also living here too. Do they drink bottle

Speaker 7:          00:42:11       water to [inaudible] you can't get [inaudible].

Speaker 8:          00:42:59       Um, all right. Sisters a through c. Here we go. Uh, tired of giving advice to guys with psycho suicidal girlfriends or people with STDs. Well, I got something a bit lighter for you here. A kind of like the cores lite version of your typical advice. Thank you. And is perfect for the middle of summer. Like kick my feet back on this one. So I know this

Speaker 8:          00:43:23       who I'd been friends with, uh, for awhile now and banged one time. She's the oldest of three sisters, so we all call her sister a. About two years ago I made out with sister, be in a club, not my initiative, um, and ended up having sex with there the same night. Jesus Christ. Dude, I went out with her. Do, do they have like that thing on the back of their SUV where they had this stick figures of the entire family and you just slowly keep axing them out and the family doesn't understand if somebody's trying to kill my daughters. No, just trying to fuck all of them, sir. Well, that's a relief. All right. Um, anyways, I went out with her for awhile. Oh, this is sister B. And it was surprisingly not awkward when we were hanging out all together, even though everyone knew the situation. Jesus Christ, what's southern state are you in sir?

Speaker 8:          00:44:20       Um, I'll go fuck yourself people down south. That was funny. Um, some months later, sister bea left me for one of her, one of my friends and got over it quickly enough. Oh, got over it quickly enough. And nowadays I'm still in contact with sister a and B since I'm not the kind of guy that holds a grudge for that kind of stuff. Oh, there you go. That's very mature, which means you really didn't give a fuck about either one of them. So why are you going to be all upset? You know, like you own their pussy once you fuck it. I hate when, I hate when guys do that. Anyways, recently senses to see, started talking to me more frequently after talking for a bit. She said she could pose for me since I'm a painter and she's a model and a 10 all the fucking way I might add. Oh you fucking creep. You fucking creep. You fucking creep.

Speaker 8:          00:45:09       So she was attend the whole time. So basically you're in a holding pattern banging her oldest sisters waiting until this girl was of age so he could fucking painter Jesus Christ. I gotta I, you know, I might have to stand up and applaud this one. This guy has taken it to another level. This is a fucking epic situation here. So you see, here's my question. Does that proposition mean anything? Do you need my advice? I need advice from you. How do you fuck every girl in the same family? Jesus Christ. This is like, you know, long there's been at, they'd spend, since there's been a triple crown winner in horse racing, the last time someone won the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness and the breeders' Cup, is that what it is or is that a soccer match? I don't fucking know. I don't own a fucking horse since the late seventies.

Speaker 8:          00:45:59       I would guarantee that it's been since the late seventies sent somebody has booze. Bang three. I think a lot can do two in one family, but to get all fucking three, two, three, two is a respectable three. Is it? No, it's beyond respectful. Two. Three. Okay. Everybody knows it's three is in the sporting world. Do that. That's a fucking dynasty. Okay. You just put yourself in there. We're fucking Bill Russell. You put yourself in there with, with, with the fucking, uh, Magic Johnson Lakers. You know, I wouldn't say the Colby Lakers. You know when you go out and you get Phil Jackson and fucking check, then it, that's that new shit that the kids like. I don't like that shit. Um, either way, dude, you're talking fucking dynasty. Wait, magic never won three in a row, but he had the Celtics to fuck with named when three out of four years. Give me a fucking break.

Speaker 8:          00:46:53       Um, so here's Michael Jordan. There we go. So here's my question. Does that proposition mean anything? Is it a trap? Should I try to bang her? Should I try and bang her too and get a third strike or keep my dick in my pants and avoid a potential shitstorm and if yes, do you have any tips, special tips on this special situation? All my friends are telling me to do so, but I thought I'd ask them more refined mine like yourselves before I did a move. Dude, you are looking at me like, dude, you're beyond me right now. Okay. This is like Bull Durham. I'm, I'm fucking Kevin Costner. Um, I'm, I'm a lifer. Okay. You're, you're, you're going up to the show. Hit and brand new balls every fucking day. I will. You tell me. Okay. I never bank two girls in one fucking family. You know, I was psyched if I was able to tag a couple of friends and we were all hanging out at a bar one night and you get that feeling like I fuck both of you and you both knew it and you both loved it.

Speaker 8:          00:47:50       I hope. Please, please tell me you liked it. Did you like it was I okay? Um, dude, I think you gotta do it. You got to do it. You know, you, you've been above board the whole time, sister. A sister be, they all fucking knew everything right now. I understand this is a little delicate. Okay. He's trying to snip the last wire here. This is the kid sister. This is it going to blow up in your fucking face. Uh, it's worth it, dude. It's worth it. It's worth losing a couple of limbs and your nose on this one. You got to do it to fuck you. No, dude. What the fuck she says to you? I, yeah, you're, you're a painter all let me take my clothes off and get paid my fucking Twat. Let's not art too. That's foreplay. Give me a fucking break. It'd be one thing. If you're in a classroom of people, it's just you and she's standing there naked, dude, that's like one of the TIF they ever done that porn senate and that scenario in a porn Jesus Christ, you might've found a new angle to. That's phenomenal. That is fucking phenomenal, dude. You got to do it. You got to do, what did John Elway retired when he only got one? He came back for another, right?

Speaker 8:          00:49:10       You got to do it to two. That's like when Bush fucking the first Bush, he stopped. He didn't get to sit down. You got to go all the way on this one, man. All right? You gotta be like Marlon Brando in fucking apocalypse now. You just, you just, you just accept the fact you left the program. All right? And I don't care how mad these girls get to do. You are at the precipice of becoming an absolute fucking legend. Legend who, who can, who can, who's gonna be able to top that dude? There are celebrities who've had orgies, they've had five on ones and all that type of Shit, okay? But I guarantee you they never fucked three fucking girls in the same family when they weren't famous, not famous. You're doing this shit with the gift of Gab. Whatever the fuck you doing, dude, you do this.

Speaker 8:          00:50:12       You got to write a book. You gotta write a book, that's fine. You know that's easy to do. Collection of the most amazing pussy getting stories ever that you can somehow confirm, all right, and it has to be none of that bullshit. The second you get famous, he get money. That doesn't count. All right? That's garbage time. Okay? They put the fucking second team in there and you just fucking Titone layups. That's bullshit. I'm talking about just regular dude. You, you talk yourself into it through. You're a fucking legend. You got to do it. All right. This might halftime speech. I'm going to quote Joe Barton. [inaudible] quoting John Madden today is going to be the greatest day of your life, but only if you win. All right? You got to do it.

Speaker 9:          00:50:59       He got to fucking do it and keep it [inaudible] the future. [inaudible] he's told me,

Speaker 10:         00:51:42       hey, what's going on? This is bill burr and this is the Monday morning podcasts for Monday, September 21st, 2009. This is like the fifth time I've tried to start this thing. I don't know where to begin this week. Uh, I am psyched because I am in Los Angeles at least for a today and tomorrow before I fly right back out again. I'm getting ready to do another special. So I have to, I'm in comedy bootcamp right now. I did a Gig at Boston University this weekend, the weekend before I was in Philadelphia, the weekend before I was in Stockholm, Sweden. Let me think. I had a week off and now I got it. I got a four week intensive right here where I just keep fucking going out and uh, my, my act is going to get really tight during this time. But um, you ever see those fat people on the biggest loser where they're like, they're losing weight, but that look of pain when they're on the treadmill?

Speaker 10:         00:52:37       That's what I have right now. If the stand up comedy version of that, you know, where there's some, a good looking woman who sort of manly standing over me going, you got to tell more jokes. Do you guys watch your show? Biggest loser deck. Did the girl on the woman, the female, the broad on that show is like, I dunno, she's really, really hot, but she's really like manly. And I wrote me and she looks like a mess. She just moves. There's like nothing dainty about her. Actually. Some girl you kind of play fight with and then she just unleashed one into your ribs and you'd be like, okay, you definitely had older brothers because you know how to throw a punch. Why are your eyebrows so big? All right. So if you're new to the podcast and I can't figure out why this fucking thing keeps red line in like that, turn down the record level here.

Speaker 10:         00:53:33       Maybe that's the problem. Um, if you new to this podcast, I do one of these every God damn week. I've been doing them for about two years at this point and I pretty much, uh, I don't think I've really missed a week really. I mean, occasionally I put them in on Tuesdays, but generally speaking, I don't miss a week. So they come out every Monday and, uh, people send me in questions, they send me in their list of stuff that they feel is underrated. Overrated. We recommend some youtube videos and websites. We interpret dreams. No, actually we don't, you know what, that was one that I always want, I've been meaning to do. Um, people keep asking me for advice and it keeps getting deeper and deeper and deeper and um, evidently haven't, I've been getting some decent reviews with my advice, but you got to understand, you're talking to the guys pretty much fucked up in every area of his life. Like here's one. Oh yeah. Let me see if I can find this one. Actually, the, how was, I was on the plane and I was going through the emails.

Speaker 10:         00:54:34       I'll, I guess I'll have to paraphrase. This guy basically sent me in one that was asking advice and he said that he was, he was married to a Chinese woman who was like seven years older than him. They had a 10 year old kid and he was from like Vietnam. I don't fuck a remember, but all I know is they got a kid and he's tired. He's not attracted to her anymore. And he wanted some advice and it's just like to I, I, I don't know. I mean that sounds about right. You know, you've been together for how long now? Why would I say something like that? See, that's why I don't wanna I don't want to fucking talk about stuff that that's got, that's, that's that fucking deep, you know what I mean? Yeah. I can see that. I think that's normal. Don't they call it like the seven year rich, you know, you're in a relationship for like seven years or so, or maybe 10 years and after awhile it's like, you know, when it comes to the physical thing, it's like there's no room left in your house where you haven't fucked.

Speaker 10:         00:55:43       There's no position that you haven't done. You know, mean my girls a pain in the ass.

Speaker 10:         00:55:52       She just walking out of the room, threw her head back. Are you serious? Are you seriously going to talk about me this way? Because if you are, I'm gonna storm out. Um, yeah. I don't know what to tell you. Why do you always do that? Nia, you just stick your head in you. You start looking at me like that's gonna make me not be an asshole. I'm always going to be an asshole. Um, so anyways, this is what I, this is what I did. This is why you can't be here when I do these. Nia, you have to leave. Close the door. Be a good girl. Come on.

Speaker 10:         00:56:26       Come in here. All right, well what? You're distracting me. Close the door. Oh, that's a good girl. Ah, you're the worst. You just keep walking in and out. It's fucking brutal. 11, 12, 13 seconds wasted. Oj. When your girl puts on flip flops, that's the worse. When they're being annoying and you keep hearing the sound of that Sandal hitting the fucking healer, their foot. And you need to be a little more sensitive. And then that silence here [inaudible] you're walking through some horrific mall that you don't even want to be in. Oh, look at those sunglasses, those acute, I want sunglasses. There you go. There you go guys. That's how you get rid of your girl. Just start trashing what they're wearing and then they store them up, you know? And then I guarantee you six hours from now she'll be like, do you really not like when I wear flip flops?

Speaker 10:         00:57:22       I thought you like those. Oh my God, why didn't you say something? I just feel so stupid right now. You know the way she had an argument about health, you know, I know I can't stand about fucking women. I just do this every week. But it's annoying. It's frustrating. I can't fucking stand the way they turn. Little things, nothing into these big fucking dramatic Falcon Crest fucking moments where all of a sudden like I'm supposed to feel like, sorry, I can't fucking stand that. You know? Like I was flying back yesterday. I couldn't, you know, from the east coast, I can't find my keys. All right. Now for those of you who listen to my podcast all the time, you know that I drive a hybrid like a fig. I drive a Prius, right? It's a great fucking car. I totally recommend it. Especially if you live in a city.

Speaker 10:         00:58:19       Why would you buy a sports car in a city? Huh? You're going to be stuck in traffic. The car's going to get all fucked up cause you can't blow out the lines or whatever the fuck you supposed to do. Actually reality is I can't afford the car. I want it. So I'm just going to trash people who can anyways, plumbing ahead. So how it works with the Fancy Prius is you don't have to stick your key in the lock and you don't even have to press a button. As long as it's on you. The second you get in the vicinity of the handle and you touch it, it unlocks. Okay. Which you know is supposed to be like, wow, wow. We really are going to fucking have flying saucer some days like moment. You know? So evidently, but that, that little mechanism that's supposed to make my life so much easier.

Speaker 10:         00:59:03       If I lose that thing, it costs like two or 300 bucks to get a new one. And I can't just be like, well, why don't you just give me one that has a fucking key on it? Cause I don't think that that option exists. Does it now? Maybe it does. I don't fucking know. So all I know is I thought I lost like that two or $300 thing. I hung around watching the Patriots jets, the game went a little bit long cause those country refs call the fucking penalty every two seconds. So now I was in jeopardy of missing my flight and I can't find my keys. So I'm rushing around the house. I tore apart my luggage like twice. All right. And then I call my girl up and she answers the phone and I'm like, I'm like, Hey, did I leave my keys out in la?

Speaker 10:         00:59:40       They only make, he's out in La. She goes, um, yeah, yeah, you left him in the car. I said, okay, cool. All right. I'll, uh, no, no, no. She answered it right away. So she goes, yeah, you left them in the car. And I said, okay. Okay. All right, cool. I'll call you from the airport. And she just goes, okay. I just, yeah, that you want attached to me for a minute. You know, they, they create that fucking moment. You know what I mean? That's why women are not in battle in war. Right. Fucking there. He'd start giving quick fucking, you know, orders. Ah, thank you. Asking me how my day in the Fox Hall went fires before he just started telling me charge up the hill. No, that's okay. You know, I don't know. I don't, I don't tolerate that. So when they say shit like that, well I guess, I guess you too busy to talk to me. That's right. I am. All right. See you later.

Speaker 10:         01:00:39       You know, and then you just fucking go. Four, three, two, one. And then the phone calls again. What's the problem? Is there a problem? And then you're in it. You're in the fucking fight that they wanted. A, he just can't fucking actually you can win, you can win. You just going to live a lonely life, but you can win. And speaking of that, this is something I learned the other, you know, I use the word console out here on my podcast and um, I don't know how they hell I came across this, but I would like to read to you guys about a street that existed in the Middle Ages by the name of Grope cunt lane.

Speaker 10:         01:01:20       I'm not bullshitting you grope current lane, pronounced grope current lane or they come late. They have to have that like I can't read English. Okay. Was this street name found in English towns and cities during the middle ages believe to be a reference to the prostitution centered on those? Uh, in those areas it was normal practice from an evil names, street names to reflect the streets function or economic activity taking place within it. Grope. Cont the earliest known use of, which is about 1230 after the death of that dude that everyone thought was holy, um, appears to have been derived as a compound of the words grope and cunt. Don't you hate when people explain obvious shit? Like really? Yeah. I couldn't put the two of those grope content. What are the w everyone knows what groping is, you know, there's

Speaker 10:         01:02:20       no other word for what else can grow up mean and [inaudible] is yet. Yeah, grub contact. Got It. Why do I have puberty lately on this? I got it, Ma. I really like this girl in class. What do I say? Um, streets with that name. We're often in the busiest parts of medieval towns and cities. Yeah, it's a red light district and at least one appears to have been an important thoroughfare. Um, although, although the name was once commonly common throughout England, changes in attitude, results resulted in, it's being replaced by more. And Nakia was versions such as grape lane, grope con was last recorded as a street name in 15, 61. You know what I mean? So all you guys out there used to have cool names for your stadiums and now you have a, I need a job.com arena as opposed to like war memorial coliseum. It's been going on forever. All right. And you know when they changed it to grape lane that there was people who still called it grope, comment and then there was people like, it's, it's balloon. Okay, have a little bit of clothes. Um, go fuck yourself. What are people doing down there on grape lane?

Speaker 10:         01:03:42       You know what that is just the beginning of like that clean comedy and why you know, something unique. You need grape lane for grope Khan to be funny. You need great Blaine. I'm full of Shit. It's just fucking annoying me. Like does, does that mean because you call it grape lane, does that mean that there's any less fucking women down there getting, you know, getting their cons groped? You know, do you guys know I got, I got an email from somebody, a, I dunno, a priest, a pastor. Uh, I dunno what the fuck it was. Some person who a holy person said that they saw me on TV and that they thought I was absolutely hilarious, but they wished that I hadn't cursed as much because it was getting beeped out a lot. And then they stumbled across my podcast and thought the podcast was also hilarious but just could not get past the fact of how much I curse. And um, I don't understand people. I could see if you have a child there, but I just don't understand it. Like adults who just like, uh, you know, it's like, dude, you're on the Internet. Okay, what does nothing I'm saying that's going to be shocking. Good Lord. I Dunno. You know what in is he right? I don't fucking know. You know what? I don't have class. Do you know what they normally like about having class? There's this, there's a, there's, there's a lack of honesty to it.

Speaker 10:         01:05:16       You know what I mean? The second you put on a pair of a pair of loafers in a blazer, okay. And all of a sudden people are looking at him. He's a gentleman, he's easy client. And then all of a sudden you start calling grope con grape lane and that that's how it begins. You know, you start calling it human resources. That creepy shit. I don't fucking know. You know, I like to say fuck, I do. I like it. It feels good. You know, nothing. I, you know, something people out there who are clean, who don't curse as much. Can you, can you give me a word, um, that did that, you know, when you're angry, like what word gets it out like that you can stress and then it ends with that. You know, you just, you just stick the landing like fucking Mary Lou Retton anyways, so whatever.

Speaker 10:         01:06:14       My point is that there used to be a street called [inaudible] Lane, you know, back in a more honest time when they could be head you every five fucking seconds. Um, you know, it's one of those deals where you look back on a time and there's certain things about it that you liked in other aspects you didn't, I mean, I liked the fact that where the whores wear was called grow current lane, you know, I mean, shit, you don't even need a map. You don't need that. But you know why they had that back then, they didn't have those little tourist brochures to let you know that, uh, where you, what part of the city you were in? Oh, it's right there on the corner of uh, uh, fucking raped me and grope cunt. Oh yeah, that's the red light district. Okay, I got it. Cool.

Speaker 10:         01:06:54       You know, and then the other side was, uh, you know, black soles, blacksmith row and cobbler fucking lane. I don't, I don't know. You know what? I'm too stupid to Improv with this right here. But you know what I'm saying? Actually, Bill, you know what? We've known what you've been saying for the last 15 fucking minutes. Why don't you get on with the podcast? All right? It's already 12, 26 out here and I have something to do at one, so I got to fucking get moving along here. Um, oh, and what I have to start doing is hyping my shit more towards the front because I think a lot of people get sick of me by the end of it. God knows I do. So, uh, this week I'm going to be at the Improv in Addison, Texas, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday. And I'm going to the cowboys game, the Monday night game against the Carolina Panthers on uh, on the Monday.

Speaker 10:         01:07:42       So if you see me stumbling through the parking lot, because I will be drinking. All right, please offer me a burger or something like that because a, I don't know if I'm going to have, the person I'm going with is going to have a fucking grill, you know. Um, anyway, so let's plow ahead here. Uh, and after next week, the week after, I'm going to be at the stress factory in New Jersey and the week after that I'm going to be in Pittsburgh at the Improv. Then I have a week off and then I'm at the uh, Improv in a DC. So there's no excuse not to see me on the fucking east coast. All right. Cause I just got back from Boston. I was in New York in May. I've been everywhere. I write. All right, Bill. Exactly. I know, I'm sorry. I just been like a real jerk lately.

Speaker 10:         01:08:27       I've been really like this how I get when I own, I'm under the gun. I really shouldn't do like podcasts. I was under the gun last week. Um, I dunno. Let's, let's just plow ahead here. Oh yeah. Okay. Now people have been asking me a lot of advice. Um, my girlfriend had this real weird dream the other day and I actually interpreted it to the point where she went, wow, that was pretty good. And I was like, you know what? That'd be great. Should have podcasts listeners, if you have some sort of, you have to have one of those dreams. You just have no idea what a fucking meant. And maybe you need somebody insight into it. Like, here's one for you. I had a dream the other day I was flying on an airplane and for some reason I was faced in the opposite direction, like I was on a train.

Speaker 10:         01:09:08       You know those little areas where you can have like people face each other and they can discuss the latest styles, like it's the fucking 18 hundreds. Um, yeah, I was sitting like that, right? I was sitting the other way and I was looking through plexiglass and I was watching George Carlin doing stand up and for some reason he was missing his right hand. And I was like, Holy Shit, that's George Karl. And I couldn't believe it. He's right fucking there. And what happened to his hand? And then when we went to get off the plane, all of a sudden he was really, really skinny in small and almost look like an like a woman. And then I walked around the front, he had like a beard and he, and he was missing his fucking hand. And I, and I, what the hell did I say to him? I said, well, you know, you, I think you're really funny, whatever.

Speaker 10:         01:09:58       And then at with the, I came out, what the fuck he said to me, he said something weird back to me and then walked away and then I got back on the plane like it was a subway and it just continued on flying somewhere, you know? And that's one of those dreams you just say to somebody in, they're looking at you like, uh, uh, I dunno dude. Maybe you want to fucking may be your fucking attracted to George Carlin is some fucked at all fucking though. That was just a weird ass fucking dream. Why is he missing a hand? Why did he look like a woman? You know, what's the deal with fucked up dreams if you have fucked up dream like that one? Cause I can't make heads or tails of that one. Why was I faced in the opposite direction? Well, build in life.

Speaker 10:         01:10:44       You feel as though, you know everybody's just going in this one direction and you don't agree with the direction you're going in the other direction. That's what you feel and you want to get to where some of your heroes are. But there's this invisible piece of plexiglass that seems to stop you from going there. And a lot of times when you don't do what everybody else wants you to do, they say you're evil. And back in the day when people used to write with their left hands, they thought those kids were demonic and they used to slap their left hand and make them write with their right hand. So maybe because your hero was on the other side of that glass, he was evil. And that's why he didn't have a right hand.

Speaker 10:         01:11:32       See, I can do it. I could somehow find a fucking through line, you know? And then maybe you, you always want to hook up with Gloria on a fucking all in the family. And that's why when you were walking behind George Carlin, that's what he looked like. An old Gloria. All right, let's fucking, let's end this. Alright, let's plow ahead here. Um, we actually, for the first time on my podcast, I have a follow up email from somebody that I gave advice to, to see how shit worked out. Um, and of course I can't fucking find it. Why? Why do I do this to myself? All right. As I search for it, I'll tell you, remember last week when I was telling you about the guy who had his, uh, his brother a cock blocked him.

Speaker 11:         01:12:23       MMM [inaudible]

Speaker 10:         01:12:25       you know, at the party and he, you know, he meets a beautiful girl first. She asked for a piece of cake. He set up, we'll get you on. He leaves, he comes back and then his fucking douchebag, older brother, he's trying to get her number. Well, he wrote me back. He said, uh, well here's what ended up happening. Um, that's it. I don't know. Okay. The next day after meeting that 26 year old and having my brother's steal her numbers, she ended up requesting me on Facebook. Got To love the Internet. He says, uh, she then wrote me saying, nice to meet you. Thanks for the cake. I wrote back and we made some conversation, uh, where I ended with hope to see you around again. She agreed and said the same, so fuck it. I asked for a phone number. Needless to say. She gave it to me and we played the phone game for a week.

Speaker 10:         01:13:09       We made plans to go out to some club on Saturday. By the way, I'm not much of a dancer, but if necessary I can bullshit my way through it. Uh, my luck could not have been any better. We got there around 3:00 AM and the friend she came with ended up leaving thinking I was taking her home. Whether they play on that or not, I don't know. But we got to her house and she a little tipsy, tells me to come up. Doesn't ask would you like to come in? She casually tells me to come in dot. Getting too crude. I'm proud to say I fucked the shit out of her.

Speaker 10:         01:13:41       Funny thing. While I was banging her, I remember thinking to myself, wait till I tell bill, dude, I really hope this story is true. All right cause I want the best for all my 14 podcast listeners. I hope this happened. Um, had um, anyways, he said I had to turn my head down and stop myself from laughing. Now my brother, the cup. Now for those of you who didn't listen last week or two weeks ago, whenever the hell I read it, uh, her brother's a cop. All right. And he's also a cock block and Douche bag of identity. Um, the cop works the night shifts. Dude, he's not at copies of fucking security guard stop it or I was wondering how the hell he became a police officer at 21 probably works at a video store. The fucking creep. Anyways, he said we ended up getting home at the same time, around 6:00 AM him in his late ships, late shifts, security guard brother.

Speaker 10:         01:14:34       He said, uh, I'm not one to rub shit my brother's face, but he asked me what I ended up doing for the night. So I simply told them I chilled with that Monica Bitch, his face said it all with me getting home at that time he was able to put two and two together. I'm not sure whether this counts as a revenge story or not since I didn't take a bat to his squad car or anything, but with the way shit turned out. I don't think a revenge is necessary. Also on a different note. Um, all right. So we ended up getting it. Then the rest is about how he has four dogs and unfortunately he had to put one down and he told you he or she gave me good advice. He goes, uh, you can't believe how much you miss your dog when it's finally gone.

Speaker 10:         01:15:13       So make sure you enjoy your dog, which I did in which I am. I wrestle my fucking dog. The dog likes to wrestle. Isn't that right Cleo? Huh? Good dog. You a good dog, Huh? Fucking maniac. You wake me up every morning. Um, anyways. All right, let's get on to, um, how bout some youtube videos for the weekend? Everybody, let me scroll down here. I actually have a website that I think is kind of blowing up on the Internet right now and I wasn't able to, uh, to get to it. I think it got too many hits. These kids started it. It's the name of the website is people of Walmart. Just search for that. And I guess these people go, they just walk around taking pictures. Of all the fucking freaks you see in a Walmart. And they just thought it was going to be something that would be funny amongst them and their friends and somehow and ended up on funny or die.

Speaker 10:         01:16:05       So, uh, evidently it's hilarious. Uh, check that out and for, um, sports fans because we seem to have a lot of them on this. Um, and even if you're, you're overseas, you can, you can actually enjoy this one search bears fan catch it catches kick on youtube bears fan catches kick and it was basically from a Monday night football game about a, I dunno, 20, 24 years ago, 25 years in 1985, 24 years ago, the bears kick in an extra point. It's going through the uprights and into the stands and all of a sudden coming from like the right hand side of the TV screen, this guy just jumps, you know, like a stadium. Like when you kick an extra point, it usually goes down and into the alleyway where the, uh, the players run into. That's basically what it was. This guy is like fucking, you know, a good 20 feet in the air.

Speaker 10:         01:17:00       He, and the best part of it is he's just completely standing up. I think I've actually talked about this before in the podcast and he catches the ball with no fucking concern. What's fro whatsoever about his own goddamn safety. I Dunno who we landed on our what, but if he did that today in America, they'd be some sort of al Qaeda nine 11 fucking group of people that would go after this guy with his mullet and a z Kaveri cheese. Like he isn't just some drunk coked up football fan that can jump to stories without breaking his fucking ankle. They treat him like he was some sort of terrorist and put his face into the fucking ground. But this is back in the day. All right, pre all that bullshit. They actually showed the replay. We're talking about what a great catch it was in Lynn Swann, the hall of fame fucking wide receiver.

Speaker 10:         01:17:48       We had one of the best world, a world series, best Superbowls ever. Actually interviews the guy. So check that one out. Check that one out. Why don't, yeah. Um, all right. That's it. Now let me get onto the advice. Like I said, I've got to blow through it this week. I apologize. Um, hey bill. So I was going out with this girl. She was real cute and real funny and we had a lot in common. Uh, do, this is a, this is a fucking weird story here he goes. Uh, we had gone out four or five times, so I thought I was getting sick, you know. Semi-Serious then one day she called me and told me we had to cancel, cancel a dinner. We had planned for later that week. She had a legitimate reason. So I was like, just like, I fuck it. Well, just reschedule. No biggie. Right? So later in the week I call her and get her voicemail and leave her a message asking if she had, uh, she was free a certain day to have dinner. She never gets back to me. So I wait a few more days and I call her again. I ended up leaving another message. Fucking nothing. Never calls me back. At this point, I wait about a week and call again and leave one more message. Not a goddamn thing.

Speaker 10:         01:18:56       What the fuck? Who does that? Sorry, I got lost at what the fuck? Who does that fucking at least call me? Tell me it's over. Tell me. I'm lame. Say you have to wash your hair or your dog ate your love life, but fucking call. I talked to my parents and friends and they have all consoled me and gave me advice or whatever. But I needed advice from, I want you to get some advice from you. Um, all right, well, let's be honest. She took the easy way out. Um, you know, she obviously didn't want to see an anymore obviously, and yeah, she, she took the fucking easy way out and um, who's getting to a, breaking up with somebody is one of the hardest things. The fear of it. You know, I saw this thing on intervention one time where they were talking about drug addicts and they say basically they'll spend 20 years avoiding, you know, 10 days of pain by continuing to medicate themselves because in their head, the pain of going through, getting clean is so fucking huge that they, that they'll continue, they'll, they'll, they'll go through 20 years of fucking hell, you know, and that's what relationships can be like, where people get into relationships and they want to break up with someone.

Speaker 10:         01:20:15       They just don't know how to fucking do it. And they just thinking, oh my God, I'm gonna break this person's heart. They're going to cry. I want to feel horrible. Uh, you know, and for guys, what if they start screaming and throwing shit and charging me, you know, with assault, because when they threw a bookcase at me, it bounced off my big forehead and then hit their big toe, you know? Um, so I know this is gonna sound fucked up, but his is, she kind of, she did you a favor in a weird, she obviously felt that there wasn't a, the connection to make it long lasting. Um, and I know she took the coward way out, but at least she, she, she figured out a way to get out of it before she fucking rips your heart out of your chest. I mean, I know it probably sucked, but it didn't seem like, you know, you have been gone. You said you're going to have four or five times. So I thought it was getting, yeah, so you went out like fuck, you know, four or five times, Dude. I mean that's some shit you can get over that at a keg party, you know, couple of fucking plastic, 16 ounces and you grabbed the fucking closest Hooters look and chick, you know, or whatever. Talk a little bit of Shit.

Speaker 10:         01:21:33       You know that she did your favorite man. So I don't know how old you are with this girl. Sounds like you guys sound like you're young and when you're young you really don't know how to do it. Um, the best way I found to do it, I mean, we actually should have like a fucking class on that. How to break up with somebody. First of all, you got to psych yourself up mentally to do it and you just have to be like, all right, we're going to talk it too and my life is going to suck from about two to possibly four 30 or five and I just have to understand that the next three hours of my life is going to suck. You know, it's kind of like if you had a fight, a kid after school you like, okay, we're fighting around three. By the time I remember a buddy of mine, he used to always get into fights as well cause I used to be like, dude, how the fuck do you fight? Like Dan? He goes, I just think in an hour I'm going to be home. I'm going to be in my bed. Everything's gonna be fine. It's kind of the same way I look at like, you know,

Speaker 12:         01:22:34       yeah.

Speaker 10:         01:22:35       If back in the day when I do a college gig and they just had me standing in a fucking hallway with no microphone and I'm like, all right, this is going to be absolutely humiliating. But in an hour from now, I'll have my check and I'll be in my fucking, you know, Buick Skylark rented from Avis or whatever, and I'll be fucking drab driving away from here. And I'd just be a funny story. Who gives a shit? So that's kind of what you have to do. And uh, and you can't leave any, there's no daylight. And a great way to stop to start is just to say that you're not happy.

Speaker 10:         01:23:09       You know, I'm not happy. Why Asian? I'm just, I'm not happy. You know, you're a great person. You can do, you know, all of that type of stuff. I feel horrible, but you know, it's not working for me and I have to figure out why. And I just, this just doesn't feel right in more. And you got, and you just get that out. And once you get that out, then the fucking tears and all the bullshit comes and then you just, you fucking, you just got to stay in there, take it, you know, and it's just getting through that first major fucking day of it. And then you've got to have other conversations. Fucking brutal. It's fucking brutal. So getting back to this look, you know, you guys sound like you're young and I just don't think that she has the mental ability to be like, yeah, listen, you know, we've gone out like four or five times, I think early, Nice Guy, but I just don't feel like it's going to go anywhere else in bum.

Speaker 10:         01:24:05       And who's kidding? Who, if she did that, you'd still be just as fucking pissed. But it is weird when they just disappear off the face of the earth like that. I've, I've had that man. I had the classic, uh, she's in the shower in a roommate, sucked at lying and when she's in the shower, callback and a half an hour and I called back and a half an hour, um, she's repairing her credenza, callback and 17 minutes and I called back in 17 minutes. Dude, I called, I want a fucking moron. I must've called like eight times and then they finally stopped answering the phone.

Speaker 10:         01:24:39       You know? Do you ever have that? Like you're avoiding somebody call and in like you think thinking there finally not going to call and then the phone rings and you literally get that little fucking heart attack in your chest. You're almost scared of the goddamn phone. Um, what do, she did not break up with you and she did and she did you a favor. Do cause she could have stuck with you for another six months and you could have been walking around telling all your friends how much you love her and how great she is. And then she dumps you out of fucking nowhere or bangs one of your friends and then you got to carry. You can carry that shit around for eight years and you know what you do get end up being stuck going out hurting other girls who had nothing to fucking do with that.

Speaker 10:         01:25:17       So in a weird way, consider yourself lucky you're out of it. You know, why would you want to waste any more time with someone who's not NTA anyways? And you're absolutely right. It was fucked up. She should have called you, but she's just not at that level of maturity and a, you've got a life to lead so there's no reason to carry around anymore. You understand me? So you go out there, you have a couple of drinks, you talked some shit to some broads this weekend. He put her fucking behind you and it's football season, you know, uh, fire up the fucking grill and forget about her. All right, here we go. Moving on. Next one. Bill, I watched a couple of your shows and videos or you stand up. I really enjoy your work. Thank you. Uh, but, but the, but the, all right, um, um, I've been listening to podcasts. All right, here we go. I am a sophomore in and I'm attending a public school that has a reputation for being dumb. Where slutty girls and obnoxious boys roam freely until the the bell rings. You know what school I thought you were describing. There's a school on the upper west side.

Speaker 10:         01:26:23       Ah, what the fuck? I think Paris Hilton went to it. A CHS knee out. She knew the name of it. I think it's called the Dwight school. And the people said it stood for dumb white idiots getting high together cause I guess they were all like rich kids. And this kind of sounded like you were a, you were describing anyways. That's a, that's an old story. Anyways. Not only does my school have bratty and no annoying, almost unbelievably ignorant students, but it is also located in Las Vegas. Oh that's right. That's how I knew it wasn't at school. Um, the hottest slash colas hole in the west. I am basically a nobody at school and other people talk to me in school. They usually describe me as quiet. I'm the person who when that one person they talk to all the time doesn't show up, seems more lost and more lonely than usual.

Speaker 10:         01:27:23       I'm very introverted and people don't really warm up to me, although I secretly wish they would. My grades are usually high, but since I have always been Mousey, I usually have problems making speeches and presentations due to not speaking loudly enough and not making any eye contact. I mean it was easily embarrassed and mistake prone. And when I'm around my friends, friends, when I'm around my friends, friends, teachers and anyone I find intimidating, uh, all they do is sit there arguably hoping I never have to talk to them to summon up. I'm socially inept. You really should've said to sum it up, you're, you're a teenager. This is how I was. I was socially retarded. Do you know when I was in, if I was like right up until like sophomore year in high school, if a girl even talked to me, my face turned beet red.

Speaker 10:         01:28:11       It's fucking embarrassing to admit, but it's true. It was pathetic and I was only funny around my immediate group of friends. If I was in a class and it was basically, you know, a middle of the pack class and there was no real popular people in there, you know, either guys or the cheerleader girls, then, um, then I would be myself. But if any of the popular people, I just knew my role and I just shut the fuck up. So to this day I have a lot of people who I knew in my past and like, how the fuck did you end up being a comedian? Dual use show. Fucking quiet. Cause that was a fucking psycho. Um, anyways, person goes on and says the only people who, uh, live in this plane, bug infested house or my mother on a Chambong of life, uh, or his life. I mean, I didn't even see who the, this was guy or girl, sorry about that. A bug infested house on my mother and me. My Dad pays for the major bills, like the mortgage and rent, but doesn't live with us for most of the year. Uh, he works as a retired civilian for the navy. Doing janitorial work on the ship channel is outside the country.

Speaker 12:         01:29:23       Yeah.

Speaker 10:         01:29:23       My mom works currently at a Vietnamese supermarket and as a cashier, yes, she is Vietnamese. And like most people from there that I observed, she cares. She only cares for Vietnamese and Chinese people. That's hilarious. Cause I told that guy he was being sensitive a few weeks ago when he was talking about the fucking, uh, that lady at the front desk or the dentist office being reverse racist. And I was like, there's no way that happened. See, this is why you shouldn't listen to me. I don't want the fuck I'm talking about and uh, I'm going to use your mother as the, the, the litmus test for everyone in Asia. I should just shut the fuck up here anyways. I can't stand or prejudice against other racist. The biggest, most recent mistakes she has made so far, she's tried to open a business and it's failed w uh, in less than a year, which is pretty pathetic.

Speaker 10:         01:30:06       We ended up being bankrupt, um, and living without water and electricity and had to move around a little bit. After a while we had to make a big change in lifestyle, which was to move, um, to Las Vegas. I was furious and upset. Oh, I guess this person used to live in San Diego in a neighborhood and always had a good time out there. And now you're at the house. Uh, my two best friends lived in San Diego and we share so much in common knowing each other and grade school. And, uh, thirdly, my sisters would visit me and take me out of the House and away from her mother.

Speaker 10:         01:30:41       Um, so what are you asking me here? Did I skip something? Oh, I have a major reason why I don't want to leave. Okay. Your mom's taking you out there when we lived in a nice looking suburb network. Okay. All my friends are there, my parents. So I have, okay. Even though I can't get away from my current situation a life, I'm worried about going to college and living on my own was moving away from your parents and living independently hard for you. Is there anything I should be warned about? Uh, no. You just need to relax and realize that you're a cool person and you're overthinking shit. Everything's gonna be fine. Do you want to learn how to come out of your shell? You just work at it the same way you would fucking learn how to play guitar, which is to basically do it every day.

Speaker 10:         01:31:21       You know, I sucked at guitar three years ago and now, um, um, um, getting halfway decent at guitar because I try to play it every day and the shit that I still suck at is a shit I don't work at. So what I would do if I was you is just work at coming out of your shell. You can try it. You know, you go out, you buy something and try and make a little chit chat with the person behind the register if it's not fucking automated and a, and give you a self licensed to suck in the beginning. That's the big thing about improving shit in your life, I found is to forgive the fact that in the beginning when you try to talk to other people, you're a, you're not going to be good at it at first. And, um, let me ask you this, have you ever opened your mouth and said something?

Speaker 10:         01:32:06       And then an entire room of people turned around and looked at you and said, what the fuck? And then they all beat the shit out of you. I mean, that was my fear. That was my fear in high school that that's what was gonna happen. You know what? It never happened. And when I finally did open my mouth, people are like, hey, you're funny. You should have been more like that in high school. You could have been fucking those fucking cheerleaders, you know? So hence I have a lot of regret about that period in my lifetime because I wasn't being myself. So, um, I dunno if you're under age, you got to go with your mom. So, you know, you got to go out there just fucking write it out and you know what it's going gonna make you a stronger person to go out there and to be a great exercise and coming out of your shell to go there, be the new kid, meet some new people.

Speaker 10:         01:32:51       And um, as far as moving out, the best advice I can give you is a get a can opener and all that little innocuous bullshit that you take for granted in your mother's house. Um, you know, and then, I dunno, don't, uh, don't hang around with assholes, you know, don't hang out with psychosis and, but I don't mean psychos like the standing there with a bloody ax, but you know, those PE people play like fucking mind games with you and you feel getting competitive with you. Those aren't friends, you know, or you can, it can happen like one or two times, but you address it. And if it continues to happen, dump them because it's just, you know, those are the kinds of people that if you start doing well in life, they actually resent you. And uh, it's kind of like that guy before earlier that I was talking about with that woman kind of, you know, saves them a lot of pain by leaving early.

Speaker 10:         01:33:43       You can do that with friends yourself. Does that make any sense? You know, the second you start seeing someone's being a Douche, if your gut is telling you that they are a Douche and there's no reason to be around him. But uh, I hope that helps you out. I'm kind of rushing through here though cause I gotta only like eight minutes left here before I got to get on. Um, alright bill. Um, his last advice when I'm going to read bill, I've been going out with this girl for, I love how I'm giving relationship advice yet. I've never had a successful relationship, although I like to think this one's a little successful, don't you Nia, who's sneaking around the room you find you find this relationship successful?

Speaker 9:          01:34:19       Oh, define successful.

Speaker 10:         01:34:26       We have healthy arguments, don't we?

Speaker 9:          01:34:28       Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 10:         01:34:30       Wow. That was hilarious for you went. Yeah. And then you're like, wait, that didn't sound like a good, yeah, we do. All right. You know what? I was right the first time. Beat it. Let me finish this.

Speaker 9:          01:34:43       Oh, look it up. Just one second.

Speaker 10:         01:34:46       You didn't have to put that over there. You're just trying to stay in here longer. Alright, let's plow ahead here. Bill. I've been going out with this girl for a little over a year and she's been, she's beginning to Piss me off. Ah, Jesus Christ. He, you know, at this question could be for about 9,000 people right now. She complains about not having any money and never offers to pay when we go out somewhere. But when she goes out with their friends to the bar or something, she spends it like, no fucking tomorrow. As a man, I don't mind paying for shit most of the time, but fucking offered to pay, you know, but fucking offered to pay would be a great, would be great sometime, but fucking offering to pay. See, it's not always my reading. Sometimes people don't write shit correctly, but fucking offering to pay would be great sometime.

Speaker 10:         01:35:32       Um, I don't want to seem like an ass making the girl pay for Shit, but give me a fucking break. Times have changed. Equality is prevailing. So why don't you throw some dough like the guys do a, what should I do to get her to start spending some money on me or at least fucking offer without me making me out to be the Dick? Basically tell me what you just told me and take out all the fucks that seriously do. That's the secret. You have to, you have to, and I had to do this because I have a temper and I say fuck every other word. I would literally sit down with a piece of paper and I would write the, the two or three points that I was trying to make and um, just to make sure that I, I didn't, you know, that this is what I wanted to say.

Speaker 10:         01:36:20       And then I would also, and and, and I would draw out this happened. I have a how much of a psycho I was. I had to draw a little smiley face next to it, which would remind me not to say it with my usual angry east coast tone. All right, so what you have to tell her is that basically what you tell me then a big thing with women, you've got to tell her how it makes you feel when she doesn't offer to pay. All right? Yet you have to sit there and listen to her. You know, complaining about money yet she doesn't offer to pay and how it makes you feel when you then see her throwing the money around with their friends and makes you feel like what? Like she's treating. You see I was gonna say like an ATM. See, this is what happens when I don't write shit down. That's very hostile. He treated me like a fucking ATM. What? I'm not good enough to spend fucking money on you fucking whore. See, you can't go that route. You got it. Oh Jesus Christ. Cleo, what the fuck are you eating lately? Just gassing me out.

Speaker 10:         01:37:19       You know, some, I am convinced with dogs that there, there is no like, uh, is no toxins built up in them. They just don't give a shit. You know, they got a fucking rip one. They just do. Um, anyways, that's what you have to do. You got to tell her how that makes you feel, you know? Um, and just, I dunno, you know what, the more you do it, you're going to learn how to do it. And it's like keywords that you can use with women that makes their ears perk up. Perk up without getting mad at you is basically, if you say, it makes me feel like this and you use words like, you know, I just kind of feel like there's a lack of respect there. I mean that's, you got to go like this way more, a sort of mature way and not because they're more mature. So get off your high horse is ladies, you just have to go that way or else they will fucking turn it around on you. Okay. The fact that you're fucking paying for everything, somehow that point we'll, you'll somehow be in the wrong. And um, there's two ways to know you're winning an argument with the female is, uh, one, they're trying to pull some fucking Jujitsu, double reverse, two point reversal fucking move on you. And a lot of times last, their last ditch suicide bomber fucking mood move is they cry.

Speaker 10:         01:38:43       All right? And the thing about is a guy, if you want to win an argument, the woman, okay? And I'm not just saying win, but you really want to make your point when you know you're right, because you'll write on this one. If your version of what's going on is actually going on, you're fucking right on this one, okay? So what you have to do is not lose your cool. You cannot get, don't take the bait and she'll do shit. She'll bring up shit from your fucking childhood. She'll bring up mom, you didn't do the fucking dishes. She'll do something if you get a dead to rights, okay? If you, if you don't, if you do, it all depends on her personality. If she's a real defensive, combative person, you really got to watch out for that breed. Okay. Those little terrier fucking women, what you gotta do is just know that she's going to say all that stuff and that you, you got to keep your fucking cool.

Speaker 10:         01:39:31       And once they start, you know, if they go name calling or something like that, that's just, that's hostile. They, they basically that to fucking word. I can never remember. Um, God dammit, you know, uh, capitulate, that's a great word too. If you use that calmly, it's basically is when you just abandon your, the, the argument and you just start, you don't reverting to like name calling or you abandon your argument and they start agreeing with you or something like that. I don't fucking know. It just sounds great to say it. But anyways, um, you gotta do you gotta write down what you want to say, say it and just say how you feeling. Take out all the fucks and if she tries to turn around on you, you know, by bringing, if she starts bringing up other shit while you do this, will you do that?

Speaker 10:         01:40:23       And it don't, don't allow that. You know what I mean? And if she wants to to talk about, you know, are you leave your shoes, you know, in the middle of the living room, be like, okay, well before we discuss that, can we, can we finish discussing this? You just got to keep steering it back. It's like fucking law and order. You've got to cross examine them. And I'm telling you, watch out for that cry and bullshit. All right? Cause that's a latch. Diffs that's their fucking 60 yard field goal. Our Hail Mary Pass. When they know that they're going to fucking, and I'm telling you, they're all there like Meryl Streep. That's why I'm not blown away by Meryl Streep. Okay. You know, I have my girlfriends can fucking act as good as she can. That's bullshit. She's a great actress. Just being a Douche. Um, so anyways, there you go.

Speaker 10:         01:41:09       That's how you do it. All right? And that's how you win an argument. If you're right, or at least that's how you make your point. Okay? And if they want to revert to name calling and bring up shit from your childhood, just don't take the bait and then what's going to end up happening is they're just going to be sitting there feeling like a jerk. And um, you know, if they're mature enough then they'll apologize for the name calling and say, I was actually wrong. I got defenses but blah, blah blah, blah, blah. But if there is psycho, they'll actually try to cry their way out of it. And I'm just know this, that when an adult is beyond the age of, uh, eight, if you didn't punch them in the face or call him some horrific name, there's really no reason to be crying.

Speaker 10:         01:41:53       So if they are crying, you know, it's like those fucking commercials here on the radio, they give you a free car and you don't have to give him any money to like September of 2015. It sounds like bullshit, doesn't it? It has to be somehow you're getting fucked. And that's the same way it is. Like most of the times when women are crying, all right out. Okay, let's get on to some questions here. Um, oh, by the way, I gave this guy shit talking about how, you know, games weren't invented in England with the fuck is he talking about? And here's somebody actually was trying to tell me, um, that I was wrong on that one. Said I would thought ever respond to your comments about, uh, what sports did the English and invent. Um, I think the English did invent baseball. It was called rounders, like in the 17 or 18 hundreds and it was played mostly by girls.

Speaker 10:         01:42:44       Not Kidding. Look it up. I actually looked it up. Um, and it seems like, yeah, there is a game called rounders, but that's one of those, you know, that's like one of those things like somebody invents that guitar and then they take credit for Jimi Hendrix, you know, I dunno. Maybe I'm them. I'm exaggerating. Um, I just don't understand why, if there is a game like baseball in England, why you would play cricket, you know, and don't they where a bunch of pads, those big catcher pads, don't, they wear that shit anyways as plow ahead. Um, besides what you mentioned on the podcast, they also invented, he wrote Bob Sleigh. Is that Bob sledding? Um, tennis, Ping Pong table tennis, golf in badminton. While if you want to take credit for those fucking sissy games, go for badminton. Really Ping Pong. I like how you keep inventing games that then other people dominate golf.

Speaker 10:         01:43:43       Tiger Woods. Thank you. Ping Pong. China. You lose that one. Tennis was the last time saving from England, England, one to fucking Wimbleton never. You got to go back to when only white people were allowed to play and they were a little fucking a cutoff slacks. No, actually they work. No, they wore slacks. That's right. There were full length pants. They have wooden rackets that they ate later use to hit a woman over the head with the fucking have a girlfriend. Um, badminton. Who plays badminton? Members of your royal family. All right. Um, I said I wasn't gonna be a jerk, but I, and I ended up being a jerk. Let's close out here with the questions. Uh, Bill, I recently started like, you know what? It's one oh three with the fuck am I doing? I got to get to the questions next week. I gave out a lot of advice this week.

Speaker 10:         01:44:30       No, always. No. My disclaimer, I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. All I can do is a judge, you know, go from my own life here. How I've handled some shit as the psycho that I am. All right. Ah, Shit. That was 53 minutes, so I didn't even do a short one. Hope you guys all have a good weekend. Please come out and check me out, uh, over the next couple of months while I get ready for my special, I mean a Addison at the Improv this weekend. I'm at the stress factory in New Jersey next weekend and the weekend after that, I'm at the Improv in Pittsburgh. I'm petting my dog with my foot.
