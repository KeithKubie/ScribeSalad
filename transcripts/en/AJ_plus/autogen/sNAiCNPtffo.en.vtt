00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.279
 I feel like eating me 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.290
 world 

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:12.269
 the desire to move forward wanting to want 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.269
 do different and unique things 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.880
 do not 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:30.230
 contextualize that has brought cultures 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:33.350
 civilizations not important in the 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.120
 history of egypt rome greece and everything 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.309
 what does the world mean while a 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.660
 little beyond not at the end much further 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:41.650
 we who are very people 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:45.620
 restless in many very many things 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:49.430
 apart discipline methodology the whole is 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:52.150
 possible teamwork respect the 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:55.660
 another game that is today this can be one 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.660
 and the citizen 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:08.200
 is for me more exciting than there are in 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.030
 no point the mind for this opaque 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.500
 is with us because to mount a 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.860
 wonderful reason and we can 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:19.860
 contextualize we see understand and 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.860
 understand and understand the Arab world 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.850
 in this way we do everything much more 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:27.289
 methodological much more efficient and 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.390
 we can control the methods much more 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:31.729
 creative we did not see him trying on your 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.590
 cook a dish because here we go more 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:35.509
 there at the end they take us the restlessness 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.840
 you want to learn more, you have to know 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:37.840
 plus 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.670
 for me cooking gastronomy is a 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:47.920
 way to understand life we ​​know a lot 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.920
 more than with work, cook for me
