00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:06.500
Cape Town is running out of water. After
three years of unprecedented drought, it

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.830
could be the first major city in the
world to go dry. And nearly a dozen more

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.060
around the world are facing the same risk.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:17.920
This is supposed to be Cape Town's main dam, but it's looking more like a desert.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.440
Did the city of Cape Town fail to act early enough?

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.120
It's always easy in retrospect, to say, well, we could've started earlier.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.050
If "Day Zero" arrives, the South African city of

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.640
4 million will shut off the taps for all
but essential facilities, like hospitals.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.960
In a region defined by deep racial and
economic disparity, the threat of dry

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.900
taps is highlighting the stark divide
between the haves and the have-nots.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.480
But in the end, everyone in Cape Town could be left without water.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.980
We're in Newlands, which is an affluent suburb at the slope of Table Mountain. Its natural spring has always

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.270
provided water for local residents, but
now thousands come from miles away, as

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.650
early as 5 a.m., to fill up their jugs.
This is now a common sight in Cape Town.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.850
Long lines at one of the city's natural
springs, where people are collecting

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.840
fresh water in an attempt to conserve
the ever-scarce municipal water coming

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.420
from the tap. It's a time-consuming but
cost-effective alternative to buying water.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.940
How worried are you about Day Zero, when the taps might run dry?

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.320
Some enterprising Capetonians are turning crisis into opportunity with online offers to

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.280
"deliver" water for those willing to pay.
Others are selling rainwater collection

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.620
tanks, and installing water collection
systems in homes. It's smart business,

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.100
since water, especially bottled, has been
in high demand. When Day Zero appeared

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.880
imminent, bottles would sell out in stores.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.720
Now, many Capetonians have settled into the realization that conservation is their new way of life.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.980
Scenes like this are not what most
outsiders think of when they hear "Cape Town."

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.700
The coastal city is better known as
a tourist destination, with multi-million

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.930
dollar beachfront properties. But three
years of unprecedented drought and rapid

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.739
population growth, coupled with
inadequate planning, have plunged this

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:45.690
paradise into panic. This is Cape Town's
main reservoir, supplying more than half

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.260
of the city's water.
I should be underwater right now but as

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.209
you can see there is none in sight. The
reservoir is down to just 10% of its

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.200
capacity. The last 9% of the
water is unusable because of the high

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.579
mix of sand in it, making it almost mud.
The winter rainfall runs from May to

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:07.769
August. But rain alone is unlikely to
save Cape Town. Instead, city officials

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:12.870
are instructing residents to limit their
daily water use per person to 50 liters – or

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.470
13 gallons – a day.
There are signs all around town

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.489
reminding people to conserve, and some
public spaces have already shut off

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:24.540
their taps. So as you can see in this
public restroom, there's signs saying

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.650
that washing hands is prohibited. In fact,
the fixtures on all the sinks are

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.340
removed, and over here there's a sign
that says, that "Due to the current water

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.080
crisis, showers and some taps have been
disconnected."

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:41.819
In February, farmers opened their dams to allow about 2.6 million gallons of water to flow to

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:45.810
the drought-stricken city. Such combined
efforts have helped to push back Day

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.129
Zero. but the doomsday remains a moving target – in a city where a water crisis

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:53.970
only highlights the deep disparity
between residents. What's now considered

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.709
the "new normal" for all Capetonians is
everyday life for black residents living

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:03.470
in townships. Under the apartheid system,
blacks were forced to live in barren,

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.290
under-resourced communities called
"townships" – like this one, where they

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.150
continue to live today. Shepherd is
among the 25% of Capetonians who live

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.250
in townships, all of which combined use
less than 5% of the city's water. They

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.829
don't have taps in their homes, or
toilets or showers.

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:23.980
So every time you need to get water, this
is what you do?

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.980
What about when you want to wash yourself, shower?

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.500
How many times a day do you do this? Or how many times a week?

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:49.620
20 times a week?

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:50.220
Yes.

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.400
I asked Shephard to show me how he fills what he calls his “bath.”

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:00.860
You fill half this up?

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.080
Do you feel like, now that everybody in Cape Town is suffering from a water shortage,

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:24.160
that the richer people and the white people are getting a glimpse into your experience?

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:37.740
Townships already experience regular water shutoffs, and city officials say they'll

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:42.069
be exempt from a citywide shutdown on
Day Zero. The city's conservation

00:05:42.069 --> 00:05:46.500
campaigns are instead targeted at
suburbs, which are among the most water-wasteful.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.260
They're also where most white residents live.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:53.860
Anita Shapiro is doing her best to meet
the city's water guidelines. Her family

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:59.380
doesn't water their lawn or fill their
pool, and have learned to collect rainwater.

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:00.940
Did you know any of this before you –

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.540
No, no.

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:05.940
So you basically had to learn the piping –

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:06.780
Yes.

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:09.980
The water infrastructure of this
whole house.

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:15.240
Anita's home has more conservation signage than most public facilities. She also uses wet wipes

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:19.659
instead of washing her hands. If it's
yellow, lets it mellow, takes short showers

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:23.889
and collects the "gray water" to flush the
toilet with. Her neighbors have also

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:27.520
drilled a borehole and let her draw
groundwater from it.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:32.660
How do you feel about the fact that Cape Town has gotten to this point of severe water shortage?

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:35.860
It's quite shocking, I think, to to first contemplate

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:40.300
the thought of there being no water in
taps. I mean, you grew up with this magic, that you

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:43.390
open a tap and there's water, and suddenly you have to realize it's not magic.

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:48.010
There's politics behind it, there's dams behind it, there's engineering

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:53.220
behind it, and people have failed us. The local government has failed us,

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:54.860
the national government has failed us.

00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:02.140
Officials are now scrambling to construct three expensive but temporary small-scale desalination plants

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:06.380
that would purify seawater into drinkable
water delivered through taps.

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:10.540
A two-year plant seems kind of just like a band-aid and not a long-term solution.

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:28.680
So this is like buying time in a very expensive way?

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:44.600
But knowledge of the impending crisis goes back decades.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.560
So why is the city only now taking serious action?

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:52.000
I asked the deputy mayor, who was recently put in charge of dealing with the water crisis.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.350
I went to the Theewaterskloof dam
yesterday. I saw how shockingly empty it

00:07:56.350 --> 00:08:02.600
is, but that didn't happen overnight.
So did the city of Cape Town fail to act early enough?

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.800
It's always easy in retrospect, when you know that you

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:09.900
had that situation, to say, well, we could have started earlier. And obviously, if we had

00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:13.870
started earlier, we would have been in a
more comfortable position. But we would

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:20.310
still have to be in a position where we
had very significant water restrictions

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:26.340
in order to to get through this period of crisis.

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:32.180
During my time here, the drought was declared a national emergency. There are skeptics who say

00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:34.900
that the Democratic Alliance, which runs
the city of Cape Town,

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:38.460
waited for things to get this bad in
order for the national government, run by

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:42.780
the ANC, to come and shoulder the burden. What do you say to that?

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:50.399
Well, I mean, that's pathetic, to be honest.
You know this crisis came upon us

00:08:50.399 --> 00:08:54.100
through the lack of rainfall, and
everyone has acknowledged for the last

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:59.260
three years that there is an
inadequate rainfall. The national

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:03.519
government in terms of the South African
constitution, is responsible for bulk

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:08.350
water supply. So it has been their
responsibility to step up to the plate.

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:12.840
In the meantime the city is taking
additional steps including lowering the

00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:17.529
pressure in its water system, installing
larger desalination plants, tapping into

00:09:17.529 --> 00:09:21.820
aquifers and mountains for groundwater
and turning wastewater to drinking water.

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:26.860
So we went from 3 million people to 4
million people overnight. And so, the

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:33.100
ability of the city to service people
is stretched because you have this

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:37.640
massive growth in population, but there's
a lag in the economic growth.

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:45.480
What's happening here in Cape Town can't be dismissed as unique. Only 3% of the water

00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:48.790
covering the Earth's surface is
freshwater. And already more than a

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:52.839
billion people around the world live in
water-scarce regions. The UN has

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:56.980
projected that the global demand for
freshwater will exceed the supply by 40%

00:09:56.980 --> 00:10:00.840
in 2030, and that's due to
population growth, climate change and

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:06.190
human action. Meanwhile in Cape Town, as the city struggles to push back Day Zero,

00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:12.420
its citizens are forced to change their relationship to water and how they use it, possibly forever.

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.780
Hey guys, it's Dena here at Cape Town's main reservoir.

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:18.360
That's what's going on with the water crisis here.

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:22.980
Watch our next video where you see what it means to live on 50 liters of water a day.
