00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500
 

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:07.870
What I have attempted to
draw here is a unit circle.

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.460
And the fact I'm
calling it a unit circle

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.190
means it has a radius of 1.

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.290
So this length from
the center-- and I

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.230
centered it at the origin--
this length, from the center

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.560
to any point on the
circle, is of length 1.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.890
So what would this coordinate
be right over there, right

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.150
where it intersects
along the x-axis?

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.910
Well, x would be
1, y would be 0.

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.770
What would this
coordinate be up here?

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.420
Well, we've gone 1
above the origin,

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.450
but we haven't moved to
the left or the right.

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:41.860
So our x value is 0.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.420
Our y value is 1.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:44.930
What about back here?

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.970
Well, here our x value is -1.

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.200
We've moved 1 to the left.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.140
And we haven't moved up or
down, so our y value is 0.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.520
And what about down here?

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.670
Well, we've gone a unit
down, or 1 below the origin.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.800
But we haven't moved
in the xy direction.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.810
So our x is 0, and
our y is negative 1.

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:08.230
Now, with that out of the way,
I'm going to draw an angle.

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:10.510
And the way I'm going
to draw this angle--

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.160
I'm going to define a
convention for positive angles.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.200
I'm going to say a
positive angle-- well,

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.110
the initial side
of the angle we're

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.500
always going to do along
the positive x-axis.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.320
So you can kind of view
it as the starting side,

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.805
the initial side of an angle.

00:01:26.805 --> 00:01:31.090
And then to draw a positive
angle, the terminal side,

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.820
we're going to move in a
counterclockwise direction.

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.470
So positive angle means
we're going counterclockwise.

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.739
 

00:01:41.739 --> 00:01:43.780
And this is just the
convention I'm going to use,

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.160
and it's also the convention
that is typically used.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.860
And so you can imagine
a negative angle

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.950
would move in a
clockwise direction.

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.602
So let me draw a positive angle.

00:01:54.602 --> 00:01:59.510
So a positive angle might
look something like this.

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:00.770
This is the initial side.

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.510
And then from that, I go in
a counterclockwise direction

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.530
until I measure out the angle.

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.250
And then this is
the terminal side.

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.720
So this is a
positive angle theta.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.830
And what I want to do is
think about this point

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.920
of intersection
between the terminal

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.620
side of this angle
and my unit circle.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.200
And let's just say it has
the coordinates a comma b.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.370
The x value where
it intersects is a.

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.550
The y value where
it intersects is b.

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.330
And the whole point
of what I'm doing here

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.720
is I'm going to see how
this unit circle might

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.720
be able to help us extend our
traditional definitions of trig

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:38.220
functions.

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.970
And so what I want
to do is I want

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.900
to make this theta part
of a right triangle.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.760
So to make it part
of a right triangle,

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.660
let me drop an altitude
right over here.

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.550
And let me make it clear that
this is a 90-degree angle.

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.030
So this theta is part
of this right triangle.

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.050
So let's see what
we can figure out

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.350
about the sides of
this right triangle.

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.630
So the first question
I have to ask

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:11.740
you is, what is the
length of the hypotenuse

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.130
of this right triangle that
I have just constructed?

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.500
Well, this hypotenuse is just
a radius of a unit circle.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.250
The unit circle
has a radius of 1.

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.770
So the hypotenuse has length 1.

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:29.480
Now, what is the length of
this blue side right over here?

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.530
You could view this as the
opposite side to the angle.

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.570
Well, this height is
the exact same thing

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:42.880
as the y-coordinate of
this point of intersection.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.380
So this height right over here
is going to be equal to b.

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.370
The y-coordinate
right over here is b.

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.690
This height is equal to b.

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.060
Now, exact same logic--
what is the length

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.570
of this base going to be?

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.540
The base just of
the right triangle?

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.780
Well, this is going
to be the x-coordinate

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.082
of this point of intersection.

00:04:04.082 --> 00:04:05.540
If you were to drop
this down, this

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.500
is the point x is equal to a.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:14.780
Or this whole length between the
origin and that is of length a.

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.460
Now that we have
set that up, what

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:24.580
is the cosine-- let me
use the same green-- what

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.510
is the cosine of my angle going
to be in terms of a's and b's

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.460
and any other numbers
that might show up?

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.630
Well, to think
about that, we just

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.310
need our soh cah toa definition.

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:37.870
That's the only one we have now.

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.380
We are actually in the process
of extending it-- soh cah toa

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.370
definition of trig functions.

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.770
And the cah part is what
helps us with cosine.

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.880
It tells us that the
cosine of an angle

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.220
is equal to the length
of the adjacent side

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:52.750
over the hypotenuse.

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.310
So what's this going to be?

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.410
The length of the
adjacent side--

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.280
for this angle, the
adjacent side has length a.

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.050
So it's going to be
equal to a over-- what's

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:03.580
the length of the hypotenuse?

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.090
Well, that's just 1.

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.740
So the cosine of theta
is just equal to a.

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.320
Let me write this down again.

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.450
So the cosine of theta
is just equal to a.

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:18.070
It's equal to the x-coordinate
of where this terminal

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:21.340
side of the angle
intersected the unit circle.

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.320
Now let's think about
the sine of theta.

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.600
And I'm going to do it in-- let
me see-- I'll do it in orange.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:34.286
So what's the sine
of theta going to be?

00:05:34.286 --> 00:05:37.330
Well, we just have to look at
the soh part of our soh cah toa

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:38.300
definition.

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.470
It tells us that sine is
opposite over hypotenuse.

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:44.950
Well, the opposite
side here has length b.

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:48.460
And the hypotenuse has length 1.

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:54.890
So our sine of
theta is equal to b.

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:57.540
So an interesting
thing-- this coordinate,

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:00.050
this point where our
terminal side of our angle

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:01.940
intersected the
unit circle, that

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:05.344
point a, b-- we could
also view this as a

00:06:05.344 --> 00:06:07.363
is the same thing
as cosine of theta.

00:06:07.363 --> 00:06:10.250
 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:16.300
And b is the same
thing as sine of theta.

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:17.810
Well, that's interesting.

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.650
We just used our soh
cah toa definition.

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:24.190
Now, can we in some way use
this to extend soh cah toa?

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:26.020
Because soh cah
toa has a problem.

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:30.090
It works out fine if our angle
is greater than 0 degrees,

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:31.840
if we're dealing with
degrees, and if it's

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.370
less than 90 degrees.

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:36.620
We can always make it
part of a right triangle.

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.190
But soh cah toa
starts to break down

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:43.130
as our angle is either 0 or
maybe even becomes negative,

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:46.330
or as our angle is
90 degrees or more.

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:48.890
You can't have a right triangle
with two 90-degree angles

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:49.390
in it.

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:50.750
It starts to break down.

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:52.540
Let me make this clear.

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:55.540
So sure, this is
a right triangle,

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.040
so the angle is pretty large.

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.322
I can make the angle even
larger and still have

00:06:59.322 --> 00:07:00.030
a right triangle.

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:03.741
Even larger-- but I can never
get quite to 90 degrees.

00:07:03.741 --> 00:07:05.240
At 90 degrees, it's
not clear that I

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.531
have a right triangle any more.

00:07:06.531 --> 00:07:07.979
It all seems to break down.

00:07:07.979 --> 00:07:09.520
And especially the
case, what happens

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:12.380
when I go beyond 90 degrees.

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:16.230
So let's see if we can
use what we said up here.

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:19.230
Let's set up a new definition
of our trig functions

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:23.290
which is really an
extension of soh cah toa

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:25.050
and is consistent
with soh cah toa.

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:28.530
Instead of defining cosine as
if I have a right triangle,

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:30.780
and saying, OK, it's the
adjacent over the hypotenuse.

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:32.660
Sine is the opposite
over the hypotenuse.

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:34.560
Tangent is opposite
over adjacent.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.520
Why don't I just
say, for any angle,

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:41.280
I can draw it in the unit circle
using this convention that I

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:42.270
just set up?

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:48.160
And let's just say that
the cosine of our angle

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:56.270
is equal to the x-coordinate
where we intersect,

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:59.402
where the terminal
side of our angle

00:07:59.402 --> 00:08:00.950
intersects the unit circle.

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:17.180
 

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:20.990
And why don't we
define sine of theta

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:25.350
to be equal to the
y-coordinate where the terminal

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:28.060
side of the angle
intersects the unit circle?

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:30.720
So essentially, for
any angle, this point

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:34.237
is going to define cosine
of theta and sine of theta.

00:08:34.237 --> 00:08:36.070
And so what would be a
reasonable definition

00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:37.240
for tangent of theta?

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:40.350
Well, tangent of theta--
even with soh cah toa--

00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:42.620
could be defined
as sine of theta

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:45.750
over cosine of theta,
which in this case

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:48.990
is just going to be the
y-coordinate where we intersect

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:53.650
the unit circle over
the x-coordinate.

00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:56.310
In the next few videos,
I'll show some examples

00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:59.210
where we use the unit
circle definition to start

00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:03.194
evaluating some trig ratios.

00:09:03.194 --> 00:09:03.694
