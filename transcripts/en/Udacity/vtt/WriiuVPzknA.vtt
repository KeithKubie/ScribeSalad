00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.540
In this lesson we learned some new concepts, that can be summarized into five

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.810
main points. Point one, our genomes hold

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.940
information, and are made of a basic molecule

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:15.020
called DNA. Point two, the basic building blocks of DNA are four different

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:20.290
types of deoxynucleotides, called adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine,

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:25.570
or A, T, G and C. Point three:

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.410
Long molecules of DNA are organized around

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.750
histone proteins into individual structures called chromosomes.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:39.250
Point four: 3 billion base pairs of DNA are organized into 22 pairs of autosomes

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.360
and one pair of sex chromosomes that can be found in the nucleus. And point

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.590
five, the total human genome is composed

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.270
of elements from our nuclear and mitochondrial chromosomes.
