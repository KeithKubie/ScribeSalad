00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.090
You think it's perfect.

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.910
Of course, not.

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:04.720
There are some problems.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.700
One problem is, remember I told you
that the way you do the dot product,

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.710
since these are images, vectors, you can
just line them up and multiply them.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:13.670
That was the dot product.

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.210
That's how you take the dot product of
these two 10,000-dimensional vectors.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.250
That should have made you wonder,
well what happens if it's misaligned?

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:22.800
Right?
The eyes aren't exactly in

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.220
the right place.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.530
Okay.
The scale is a little bit different.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.365
The answer is,
it doesn't work very well.

00:00:28.365 --> 00:00:32.000
All right.
It really requires good alignment

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:32.780
scaling.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.820
Also the background has to be not too,
too terrible.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.220
That can be done but it is a,
a sensitivity of method.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:40.580
Another cute little story.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.650
At the time they had
these 8,000 faces and

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.560
they wanted to put them in a scale,
in a, in a scaled lined up way.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.340
And so, you could imagine trying to
write a computer program that would

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.040
sort of find where eyes were,
and then line them up, or

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.710
you could pay an undergraduate.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.050
So, they paid an undergraduate
to click on the pupils of

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.950
the eyes of each picture
of the 8,000 pictures.

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:03.786
I think his first name was Wasi,
I cant remember.

00:01:03.786 --> 00:01:05.550
If you're out there, my apologies.

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.015
And what was great as Sandy will tell
you is as a student who's working

00:01:09.015 --> 00:01:12.419
on these 8,000 pictures,
he came back and said, I have a new,

00:01:12.419 --> 00:01:15.146
new appreciation for
what order of magnitude means.

00:01:15.146 --> 00:01:17.811
Because the difference
between doing 80 pictures and

00:01:17.811 --> 00:01:20.960
8,000 pictures as you can
imagine took a long time.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.590
But you basically you
have to line this up.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.322
Now, You can use methods to
automatically align the eyes its scale,

00:01:27.322 --> 00:01:29.690
et cetera, and
then that kind of thing will work.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.920
Another limitation that is sort of
of a more theoretical basis for

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.420
PCA in general,
Principle Component Analysis.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.810
Typically the way you do it is you take
your entire population, you find the,

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.010
the direction of variants
over the whole population.

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.830
You project down along
those dimensions and

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.490
then you try to discriminate
between the different classes.

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.660
In this data here, we have blue
points and we have red points.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:02.180
But, if the first thing you did
was find the axis of elongation.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.760
Okay.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.560
The axis along which there
is the most variation.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.960
All right.
And you projected these points down,

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.980
well clearly, you will confuse
the blue points and the red points.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:15.950
All right.

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.180
So as it happens to be that
the way of separating the classes.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.100
Right?
So the direction along which you want to

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.500
separate the classes is not
the direction along which the,

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.860
all the points are distributed.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.980
There is methods in comp,
in pattern recognition Fisher Analysis,

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.320
Linear Discriminant Analysis, for
using not just the structure of

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.880
the population, but
the structure of the classes.

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.830
To determine which way to separate.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.910
We won't talk about them here
because it's kind of an old method.

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.950
But it actually talks more about the
discriminative methods that we'll talk

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.330
about not next time, but the time after.

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.815
The idea is saying that,
well I don't need so much to model the,

00:02:53.815 --> 00:02:57.050
the points themselves, because
the points are elongated this way

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.970
I need to model the separation
between the points.

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:05.670
So a limitation of PCA is that sometimes
the direction of maximum variance

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.680
is not always the best direction to
project on for doing classification.
