00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.240
- So Sal here from Khan Academy,

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:04.410
and I'm excited to be
here with John Dickerson,

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.480
co-host of CBS This Morning.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.720
- And I'm excited to be here too.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:08.760
(Sal laughing)

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:09.860
- And some of you all might be wondering,

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:11.260
what are we doing together?

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.610
And we are going to be
talking about civics

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.490
and government and American history.

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.180
And you're gonna see a series of videos

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.350
on Kahn Academy tapping
into John's expertise.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.680
- You know, when I cover
the news every single day,

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.350
one of the first things I do is I go back

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:28.920
and look at our amazing American
history for two reasons.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.690
One, what has the
standard been in the past?

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:32.030
How have people behaved in the past?

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:33.870
So we know whether what's
happening now is new,

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.910
crazy, interesting, in keeping
with the American experience.

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.050
And the other thing is when
you learn about history,

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.970
when you look to the past,
you can sometimes have a clue

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:42.810
about what's gonna happen in the future.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:44.737
Even though things are much
different now with technology

00:00:44.737 --> 00:00:46.830
and the pace of things,

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.920
turns out, human beings
behave the same way

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.460
in a lot of ways all
throughout American history.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.450
- So this is gonna be a very exciting,

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:55.660
as you could tell, series of videos

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.690
that some of 'em are
gonna be John and myself.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.450
And some of 'em are gonna be John,

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.110
giving us kind of connecting
what you learn in school

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.260
to what's happening in
the world around us.
