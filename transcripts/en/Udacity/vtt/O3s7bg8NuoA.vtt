Before diving into the nitty-gritty details of data munching, I

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.390
want to ask if you've ever had to analyze really messy

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.470
or unorganized data? Even if you're not a data scientist, you've

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:14.060
probably dealt with unwieldy data at some point in your life.

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:15.960
Maybe you had trouble reading the receipts from a bake

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.690
sale you organized, or you tried to keep track of your

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.590
personal budget in an Excel spreadsheet. What methods or tools did

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.830
you use to make your life easier? Please share your experience

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.900
with the class by typing your answer in the forum. I've added

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.670
a link to the discussion thread for you in the instructor comments.
