[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:04.870
JASON ROBINSON: Providing our
users with a more interactive

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:06.770
movie discovery experience
is very important

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:08.150
to us here at Flixster.

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:11.150
Interactive posts allow users
to invite their friends to a

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.070
movie while they're looking
up a showtime.

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.500
Interactive posts are unique
because they feature a

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.660
prominent call to action back
to Flixster directly in a

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.660
Google+ stream.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.080
SAMEER IYENGAR: We use
interactive posts to help

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.180
people share and purchase
products.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.870
For example, when you write a
review, you have the option to

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:28.710
share it to your
Google+ stream.

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.885
If you've given it a good
rating, we use a special Add

00:00:30.885 --> 00:00:33.640
to Cart call to action to allow
your friends to purchase

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.740
it directly from the stream.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.840
JOCELYN MANGAN: People love to
talk about food, so we're

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.190
using interactive posts to allow
people to share the fact

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.440
that they made a reservation
or that they just found a

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.150
great-looking menu.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.480
Our engineers were genuinely
excited throughout the

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.950
process, and the support that we
got from Google was great.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.895
And we're excited to lay the
foundation for even cooler

00:00:53.895 --> 00:00:55.145
features to come.
