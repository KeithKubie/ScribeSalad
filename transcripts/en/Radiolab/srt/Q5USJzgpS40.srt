1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:05,400
You are listening to radio lab radio, w.

2
00:00:05,401 --> 00:00:09,990
N. Y. S. C. E. N. N. P. R.

3
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:14,050
I thought we would begin, uh,
by looking backwards at a,

4
00:00:14,051 --> 00:00:17,340
at a wonderful moment in the
history, cinematically of parasites.

5
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:22,350
Here's the cinematic history of parasites.
Okay. So do you remember that movie?

6
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:27,060
I'm not going to tell you the name
of it. Yeah. Starts out. In fact,

7
00:00:27,061 --> 00:00:31,610
I have the script right
here. Setting space.

8
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:34,290
[inaudible]

9
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:37,590
okay. Vast empty space

10
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:44,260
script continues to stars shine cold
and remote like the love of God.

11
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:47,040
Ooh, you imagining this? Yes.

12
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,910
Now floating in that vast
nothingness as a tiny dot of a ship,

13
00:00:50,911 --> 00:00:51,810
you can barely see it

14
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,420
to the interior of the ship dead.

15
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:58,880
Here we are in a ship full of
astronauts who are tired and dirty.

16
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:01,580
Renee will tell you, look dead, no

17
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,030
bouncing around and you
just get the feeling.

18
00:01:03,031 --> 00:01:06,540
This is a normal day in
their astronauts lie until

19
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:13,330
they're on the computer. Radar is a
disturbance, some kind of distress.

20
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:15,790
Second transmission here. Yeah.

21
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,650
Do you think we're going to check
this out so they trace the signal,

22
00:01:18,651 --> 00:01:23,651
eventually get into a pod and show me and
they find themselves at this abandoned

23
00:01:24,261 --> 00:01:25,094
ship.

24
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:33,340
Totally abandoned. It's like a ghost ship.

25
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,600
I've never seen anything like
it. I knew I hadn't had to crow.

26
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,810
It's empty except for these weird eggs
and the astronauts are like looking at

27
00:01:40,811 --> 00:01:42,540
the eggs and touching the eggs and going,

28
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:51,350
okay, now fast forward. We're
back into the first ship. Okay,

29
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:56,150
everything's fine for the most part and
then something happens and I want you

30
00:01:56,151 --> 00:01:59,240
to, I've got the computer there in
front of you. Okay? We'll push this.

31
00:01:59,241 --> 00:02:00,830
Push the space bar. Space bar.

32
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:05,560
All right, you're at the table.

33
00:02:05,561 --> 00:02:06,394
Everyone's dressed.

34
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:11,560
The first thing that I get to do
when I get to get some decent food,

35
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,050
you can dig it, man. Talk to talking,

36
00:02:13,051 --> 00:02:16,240
chatting me or having like
salad was eating and talking.

37
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:20,770
One of the guys gets a little weird,
right? Oh, he's not feeling so good.

38
00:02:20,771 --> 00:02:25,540
One of the guys, what are you doing?
Oh, now he's coughing, coughing.

39
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,670
Don't tell me trouble breathing.

40
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,880
He's falling back onto the table. His
chest is heaving, his wrist. Oh my gosh.

41
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:41,280
He's kicking his head wildly and he's
like flexing all over the table and

42
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:45,660
something. He's like, Oh,

43
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:47,370
Oh God,

44
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:56,040
there's a red thing. I read
the horrible sneaky thing.

45
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:59,970
This is of course the classic scene
from the original alien movie scene

46
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:04,410
where the little thing bursts out of
the guy's chest and like hisses why did,

47
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,300
because I think I figured out
why that scene is scary. I mean,

48
00:03:08,301 --> 00:03:12,650
when I first saw this movie, that scene
went over and over and over in my mind,

49
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:16,130
and it's had this effect on a lot of
people and I think I know why. What are,

50
00:03:16,131 --> 00:03:19,790
you know, it's not that the little
creature is disgusting, which it is.

51
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:25,280
It's that it was there all
along. Sitting there. Yeah,

52
00:03:25,281 --> 00:03:27,470
inside him, like incubating,

53
00:03:27,471 --> 00:03:32,210
waiting to think that you sitting in
that seat right there could have in your

54
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:36,140
gut these little worms that are wriggling
around doing more or less what that

55
00:03:36,141 --> 00:03:38,330
alien was doing and I
can't even see them in, you

56
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:42,700
can't even talk about it. So it's not,

57
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:48,710
today's subject on radio lab will be
flowers. Even meadows coming up after this

58
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,373
[inaudible]

59
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:01,690
no, we're not doing that. We're doing,
we're doing that an hour on parasites.

60
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:07,250
These little creatures that live inside
us invisibly and yet can have a huge

61
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:10,250
influence over who we think we are.

62
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:14,510
What is a parasite precisely and
mature. And just to sort of slide us in,

63
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,150
get us into the mood. I'm
already not in the mood.

64
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:20,510
We thought we would get things started.
Maybe I'll just move this over here.

65
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:25,310
Well there really is no other way to
start a show on parasites except with this

66
00:04:25,311 --> 00:04:27,890
guy. You should introduce
yourself. My name is Carl Zimmer.

67
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,570
Carl's is a science writer and parasites
have been on his radar ever since.

68
00:04:32,571 --> 00:04:33,590
He was a little boy.

69
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:38,830
I grew up on a little farm and my mother
would raise tomatoes sometimes in her

70
00:04:39,021 --> 00:04:43,640
pensionable garden and sometimes there
would be these caterpillars feeding on

71
00:04:43,641 --> 00:04:43,761
them.

72
00:04:43,761 --> 00:04:47,420
And my mom would be very annoyed and every
now and then I would notice that some

73
00:04:47,421 --> 00:04:51,020
of them didn't look very well and they
had this little sort of fuzzy white bumps

74
00:04:51,021 --> 00:04:53,810
on them and I didn't really
know what they were. Well,

75
00:04:53,811 --> 00:04:58,811
it turned out that they had been
attacked by a parasitic wasp,

76
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,210
which had laid its eggs inside of it.

77
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,470
Those exit hatched and had become larvae
and those larvae were swimming around

78
00:05:06,471 --> 00:05:10,970
inside that Caterpillar while I was
eating my mother's tomatoes and they were

79
00:05:10,971 --> 00:05:14,900
growing, growing inside the caterpillar.
And then finally when they were ready,

80
00:05:14,901 --> 00:05:17,930
they came out and only
then did their host die.

81
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:22,010
And when he finally found out that that
is what was happening inside those fuzzy

82
00:05:22,011 --> 00:05:24,170
white bumps, profound situation,

83
00:05:24,171 --> 00:05:28,100
this whole universe of a baby's
growing into adolescence,

84
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:30,530
that's when I guess I
sort of got very hooked,

85
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:34,190
which is probably an understatement
because you are sort of like capital p

86
00:05:34,191 --> 00:05:36,980
parasite man. And if you look, yeah,

87
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:40,670
in the New York Times or science magazine
or any of the places, Carl writes,

88
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:45,590
a suspicious number of his articles
are pretty flattering to parasites.

89
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,990
People who have been dismissing
parasites for a long time,

90
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:49,250
calling them degenerates.

91
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:53,110
Now I would argue that
parasites are not degenerate.

92
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:55,900
They have gained the ability to
live inside three, four, five,

93
00:05:55,901 --> 00:05:58,370
six different species. So do
you find that you sort of,

94
00:05:58,371 --> 00:06:02,830
you're a lawyer for them. Hey Sir, you
call this degenerative. How dare you sir?

95
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:03,580
Say that.

96
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:08,350
I think I'm a defender of all in the
collected and put upon species out there.

97
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:11,500
Why wouldn't a parasite the what?

98
00:06:11,501 --> 00:06:14,500
I think you mean when you say
degenerate because the title thing,

99
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:18,650
it infects something else. It sucks.
Whatever. It's not independent. Right?

100
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,190
So when you say it's not degenerate
[inaudible] what do you say that? Well,

101
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:27,350
let's start with saying it's not
independent or any of us independent Kit

102
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:30,170
Carson. How have you stripped all
the bacteria out of Kit Carson?

103
00:06:30,171 --> 00:06:33,020
Kit Carson would get very sick.
Daniel Boone on the other hand,

104
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,760
now there's a guy in the pendant
alone in the woods. Daniel Boone eat,

105
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,720
I guess Daniel boot eats pigeon like
the rest of us. What's your point?

106
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:46,940
Right point is the Daniel Boone eats meat.
He ate bread, which came from plants,

107
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,140
was the question of degrees.

108
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:52,010
Though we're not living inside the
intestinal track of some other creatures,

109
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:56,390
so why does living in side seem like
it's a degenerate thing as opposed to us

110
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:56,680
know?

111
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:01,010
We can't even synthesize a lot of our own
vitamins anymore where the degenerates

112
00:07:01,011 --> 00:07:03,050
in a lot of ways, no code, no com.

113
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:08,060
If you are a creature that lives
off someone else's vitality,

114
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:11,450
cheaters would be another way of putting
it. But listen, can you appreciate it?

115
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:15,440
I'm going to cut this short right here.
Carl says, no, no, no. They're amazing.

116
00:07:15,441 --> 00:07:18,640
Time and time again, he says, no,
no, no. In the argument went on,

117
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,630
still waiting to hear about how you,

118
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:24,830
how you are able to photosynthesize
until you answer. Do it for me,

119
00:07:24,831 --> 00:07:28,460
but I go about it in a mental way. You
can't even do it yourself. Like I said,

120
00:07:28,461 --> 00:07:32,360
the argument went on and on with Roberts
saying one thing and Carl firing back

121
00:07:32,361 --> 00:07:33,760
and me adding another. Okay,

122
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:36,680
and here's what we're going to do
just to be fair and square about this.

123
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:40,880
We're going to bring in an independent
moderator. Lolo yourself. Yeah.

124
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,440
You're going to be the monitor.
Yeah, you'd get that Mike, Right?

125
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,110
You're going to be the moderator
and a you listening right now.

126
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,270
We will leave it to you, your decision
and this one lightning round of go ahead.

127
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,820
Should I like to do that?
Okay. Yeah. Parasites.

128
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:01,910
Are they evil or are they
awesome? Starting with number one,

129
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:04,280
that a parasitic wasps,

130
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:09,620
there are probably 200,000 species
of parasitic wasps out there.

131
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:11,190
Big Wasp, small ones.

132
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,310
They're generally pretty tiny and
they go after all sorts of things.

133
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,120
Some will lay them in house caterpillars.

134
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:19,090
Spiders are the one Carl's
going to tell us about this.

135
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,760
This particular wasp is called imp
likes. Compressor goes after [inaudible]

136
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:25,580
[inaudible]

137
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:28,230
and for those of you who never
thought you'd feel sorry for a caucus,

138
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:29,883
[inaudible]

139
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:33,040
keep listening. So what
it does is it [inaudible]

140
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:35,970
flies around and it looks for a cockroach.

141
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,180
And once it finds that Cock Roche

142
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:42,050
kid land and then

143
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:46,850
the fight begins, they
tumbled back and forth around,

144
00:08:46,851 --> 00:08:51,710
around until finally the wasp somehow
manages to arch its back around the body

145
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:54,430
of the cockroach and uh, stings it

146
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,160
right in the belly. The
cockroach twitches for a second

147
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:06,180
and then false. The cockroach is
paralyzed. Now the wasp takes its time.

148
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:10,290
Repositions itself puts its butt
up right near the cockroaches head

149
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:11,960
[inaudible]

150
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,940
and delivers a second stink.

151
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,860
The Stinger actually threads its way
to a particular spot in the brain.

152
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,750
And this does something odd.

153
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:25,940
Moments later the cockroach recovers
of stands up. I can walk again,

154
00:09:25,941 --> 00:09:29,300
but something is wrong, very
wrong. It just stands there

155
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:31,750
like a week.

156
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:37,200
It can't run away. Move.
It has essentially lost its
will. What does that mean?

157
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,513
Uh, it's,

158
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,650
yes, it is a puppet. It's
become a Zombie basically.

159
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:50,310
And so now the wasp will literally grab
onto the cockroaches antenna and start

160
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:55,670
pulling on it. How does it grab with,
what does it grin? I plead with its mouth.

161
00:09:56,210 --> 00:10:00,410
Imagine tiny wasp guiding a
cockroach across the desert floor,

162
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:01,610
like a dog on a elite.

163
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:07,790
And so it leads it down, down, down,

164
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:12,380
down into a little borough it's
made and the cockroach says, okay,

165
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,740
whenever you want to go. Then

166
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:20,080
once the wasp has the Roach in the borough
lays its eggs on the underside of the

167
00:10:20,081 --> 00:10:20,914
cockroach.

168
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:25,150
Tonight you've got this drugged roach
sitting on top of some wasp bags and then

169
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:27,610
the wasp goes out and
it seals the borough.

170
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:32,710
It buries the cockroach
alive. Well, it's a shell.

171
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:36,230
It's in a little chamber. It doesn't
want to kill the cockroach because this,

172
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:38,950
the cockroach is gonna feed.
It's, you know, it's young. Yeah.

173
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,320
So then the eggs hatch

174
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,900
and then they drill inside. The
cockroach is still just sitting there.

175
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,370
How's it staying alive at this point?
What parasites are very careful, you know,

176
00:10:51,371 --> 00:10:55,150
they won't eat vital organs
that will kill it. Instead,

177
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:57,250
Carl says they just
feast on the extra stuff.

178
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,920
There's a lot of stuff
inside of a cockroach,

179
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:04,360
a lot of fluid just floating around.
It's of Wonderbread essence of skin,

180
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:08,260
old hair, and you can just feed
on any, the host stays alive. Wow.

181
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:09,303
And then what happens?

182
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:14,340
Eventually a little baby wasp larva grows
up inside the cockroach and develops

183
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,620
into an adult. And then
one day in the wash

184
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,490
eats its way up a little hole out of the,

185
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:26,530
out of the cockroaches body shakes
off its wings and flies off,

186
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:32,330
and then the Roche dies, then the
roach dies. Why only then? Yeah.

187
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:35,850
[inaudible]

188
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:40,850
that to me sounds like of the purest
description in nature of evil that I can

189
00:11:41,461 --> 00:11:43,920
imagine. Wouldn't you agree? Well,

190
00:11:43,921 --> 00:11:48,921
Darwin certainly said that God should
not be personally blamed for having

191
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,450
created parasitic wasps.

192
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:56,650
[inaudible]

193
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:59,680
but if you ask Carl, he'll have
you think about that moment.

194
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:01,570
The moment where the wasp stings,

195
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:06,690
the brain parasitic wasp can attack a
cockroach and inserted Stinger into one

196
00:12:06,731 --> 00:12:11,731
specific part of the cockroaches brain
and inject a precise little cocktail of

197
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:16,810
drugs that then turns the
cockroach into it. Slave.

198
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:22,170
I know that that Wasp didn't get a phd
in neurobiology and yet it has performed

199
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:27,850
a kind of brain surgery very
precisely in a very elegant way. Uh,

200
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,360
or evil might be the other
way. [inaudible] go. Go ahead.

201
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,820
But there's a complexity
there that you can't deny

202
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,000
[inaudible]

203
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,560
or can you, we leave it

204
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:43,120
to you bringing us to example number two,

205
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:47,110
parasitic mean to food. I mean, here's,

206
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:50,650
here's a another example that I
actually was looking at today.

207
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:55,540
Can you holding your computer up to the
glass and on the screen is a big black

208
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:59,200
and it looks like it's carrying
a cherry, right? A Cherry.

209
00:12:59,201 --> 00:13:01,210
That's about twice the size of the ant.

210
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:06,240
That Red Cherry is actually parasites
inside of the aunt making it look like a

211
00:13:06,611 --> 00:13:10,060
red cherry. What part of the aunt is
that? Is that it's bought essentially?

212
00:13:10,061 --> 00:13:13,510
Yeah. Wait a second. Is it,
it looks like it's sticking.

213
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:17,190
It's big red button up into the air.
Yeah. Their behavior is changed or they,

214
00:13:17,191 --> 00:13:20,270
they waggle around their, their,
their tail as it were. Now.

215
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:24,640
Why on earth would a parasite turn on
ants but red and then make it stick?

216
00:13:24,641 --> 00:13:27,580
It's bought up into the air. Well,

217
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,070
let's say you put an ant down.

218
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:34,150
It has this bright red from your end
and an ordinary and in front of a bird.

219
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:38,980
Birds can go for that red and very quickly
because it thinks it's a berry. Yeah,

220
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:39,760
and then what?

221
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,530
It's going to swallow this little
package full of nematode eggs.

222
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:48,250
So that's the way the nematode
eggs get into the sky.

223
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:52,710
They buy their airplane tickets by
advertising themselves as berries. Yes.

224
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:54,490
What's the benefit of
being in the air? Well,

225
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:59,470
the only place that this parasite
can reproduce is inside the bird.

226
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:04,180
And how better to spread your seed?
Far and wide, the drop from the sky

227
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:09,910
with the birch droppings. That
is brilliant. That's brilliant.

228
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,370
I mean, look at the
[inaudible] that it's red.

229
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,420
It's up in the air. Yeah. Is it amazing?

230
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:20,280
It's like how can a stupid
little thing be so brilliant?

231
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:22,050
Because they're not degenerates,

232
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:28,770
but they're still cheating. And
then just to bring his point home,

233
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,060
just to pick a common one. Carl
offered up his third and final example.

234
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:37,580
Number three, blood flukes.
Blood flukes are, um,

235
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:39,990
related to flatworms tapeworms.

236
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:43,200
So their eggs start out in the water,

237
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:48,950
fresh water in Africa, Asia,
parts of South America.

238
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:49,881
And the first part of their life,

239
00:14:49,881 --> 00:14:53,330
they go into a snail and come back out
into the water and they're swimming

240
00:14:53,331 --> 00:14:57,260
around and they start looking for a human.

241
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:02,300
So imagine a foot going into the
shallow end of the pot. I see toes,

242
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:06,350
I see bottom of foot, I see ankle.
Well, if you're a blood fluke,

243
00:15:06,351 --> 00:15:11,120
you don't see anything. You don't have
eyes. But eventually you find a foot,

244
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,500
secrete a little enzyme,

245
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:18,970
basically turn a little bit of skin into
butter and you slip into the vein and

246
00:15:19,161 --> 00:15:19,650
now

247
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:22,410
you're going to swim
my circulatory system.

248
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:26,550
Sure you're going to
ride along in the blood.

249
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:33,540
And now it's time to find a mate, a mate.

250
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,240
So their sex. So there's a male and
female. So what you're saying, sure.

251
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:39,210
They're animals. They're animals. I
would have never called them animals.

252
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:42,070
It's interesting you say that. That's
a whole nother topic I guess so.

253
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:44,220
All right. So the female is very thin,

254
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:47,340
literally have a standard
issue where I'm kind of thing,

255
00:15:47,341 --> 00:15:50,850
but the male is very strange. It's,
it's kind of like like a canoe.

256
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:53,440
It's gotta be trough
down in the middle. Uh,

257
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,830
and at one end it's got a giant sucker.

258
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:58,770
Should we urge some of our listeners
to tune away at this point because,

259
00:15:58,771 --> 00:16:02,850
but it's about to happen. May Not
be acceptable in family hour. Um,

260
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:07,890
actually blood flukes are, are fairly
monogamous and loyal. So you know,

261
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:12,090
if you're looking for or for animals
to reinforce your family values,

262
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,040
blood flukes pretty good.

263
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,170
And eventually two blood flukes find
their way toward each other and the male

264
00:16:19,171 --> 00:16:23,370
does this sort of court ship or
whatever reason the female says, yes,

265
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:26,940
I accept your courtship.
The female joined,

266
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,150
the male fits in the trough.
Oh, so it's like a groove.

267
00:16:30,151 --> 00:16:33,600
The female goes and occupies the
groove right now this isn't just,

268
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:36,690
this isn't mating. This
is way beyond meeting.

269
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,140
The males will feed the
female for starters,

270
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:45,360
and they will stay this way for
a long, long time. Really? Yeah.

271
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:49,560
Like days, years. Years,
years. Yeah. Oh my God.

272
00:16:49,561 --> 00:16:54,200
Years in human or years to them. Just
years. Years, years. Years. Years.

273
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:57,120
Like the earth going around the
sun kind of years. Yes. In fact,

274
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:01,210
there've been cases where people show up
at their doctor's feeling awful and the

275
00:17:01,211 --> 00:17:05,390
doctor does some tests and says,
oh, you've got blood flips.

276
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:08,770
No, you had to have been in
Africa to get this disease.

277
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:13,330
When have you been in Africa?
And the person said 40 years ago,

278
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:18,190
44 zero 40 years ago. Yeah.

279
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:23,140
And the reason that they're getting
sick is that these male and female blood

280
00:17:23,141 --> 00:17:26,050
flukes are still together making eggs.

281
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:31,300
And Carl's literally glowing when
he says this. I have to admit,

282
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:36,301
I do love the thought that parasites
are among the most monogamous animals on

283
00:17:37,481 --> 00:17:40,420
the planet. It's heaven. I mean,

284
00:17:40,421 --> 00:17:42,580
you're going to spend the
rest of your life together.

285
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:49,030
And so our story concludes that
the image of two blood flukes

286
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:53,040
in your veins for nearly half a century

287
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:05,840
got hand to him. He's good.
Carl, you mean? Yeah. Yeah.

288
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:09,170
And there is a a species of take part
that's going to be named after me.

289
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:13,910
No kidding. Wow. It's not quite
as much of an honors do you think?

290
00:18:13,911 --> 00:18:18,911
At first I was talking with the Paris
autologist and she was telling her fellow

291
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:22,370
expert about how she was going to name
one for me and then they got into a

292
00:18:22,371 --> 00:18:23,840
conversation about, you know,

293
00:18:23,841 --> 00:18:27,060
that was good that you named
that particular tape form
for him because he's kind

294
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,170
of thin and it's kind of a thin day
for him. You know, my aunt is, she's,

295
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:33,620
she's a little round and it's a kind of
a round table of nine named her after

296
00:18:33,621 --> 00:18:36,530
and you just suddenly discover there
are a lot of tapeworms to be named.

297
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:41,420
How many is a lot. I mean tens of
thousands of species of tapeworms. Wow.

298
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:43,610
So they got us beat many times over.

299
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:47,990
I once a estimates that if you took all
the viruses in the ocean and you stuck

300
00:18:47,991 --> 00:18:51,620
them into end, how far
would it go? And, um,

301
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:55,970
it was many light years, way
beyond our galactic neighborhood.

302
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:58,910
They other ones there more cheats
than there are honest people.

303
00:18:58,911 --> 00:19:00,530
Honest creatures on earth. Oh yeah.

304
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:20,400
[inaudible] [inaudible]

305
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,830
we should go to Brackney.
Same. And I think we can,

306
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:26,520
thanks to Lulu Miller and of course
Carl Zimmer, who has written many books,

307
00:19:26,521 --> 00:19:28,080
including parasite rex,

308
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:31,980
a book we shamelessly parasitized for
the making of the previous segment.

309
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:35,580
Also want to encourage you to go to our
website where you can find pictures of

310
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:39,330
the, uh, the blood fluke spooning
the ant with swollen red button.

311
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:44,550
And of course the a wasp with
the cockroach, Letcher porn,

312
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:47,340
and it's all yours. It radiolab.org
