00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200
One of the most frightening aspects of working life is that we will,

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.400
unless we are the beneficiaries of extreme good fortune, be required to have colleagues.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:18.500
The colleague is a creature who, endured over any length of time, in situations of high stress and procedural complexity,

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:24.500
presents one of the greatest threats to calm, composure and soundness of mind.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.000
It was so much easier when we were kids. We could lie on the bedroom floor and,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.200
in a few minutes of play, build a plane, run a restaurant, or invade a country on our own.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.500
The problem with colleagues starts with the facts that they can't guess what we want.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.900
Everything needs to be explained to them, often very slowly and repeatedly.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:51.900
If this were not bad enough, many colleague are at risk of disagreeing with us about many things

00:00:51.900 --> 00:01:01.900
They turn out to have a host of contrary opinions, their own quirks, pet peeves and obsessive interests and, yet worse, they are very sensitive.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:12.500
If lone behold we have to manage with them, unless we speak them in the right way, they'll become offended, develop grudges, start to cry, or report one to a superior.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.600
In the good old days, you could just shout.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.300
When most work was physical, management could be abrupt, emotional distress didn't hold things up.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:26.900
One could still operate the brick making machine at maximum speed, even if one hated the manager,

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:33.500
or clean out the stables thoroughly even if one felt the foreman hadn’t enquired deeply enough into the nature of one’s weekend.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:40.300
But nowadays, most jobs require a high degree of psychological well-being in order to be performed adequately.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.200
A wounding comment can destroy a person’s productivity for a whole day.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:53.000
Without ample respect, recognition and encouragement, huge sums of money will get wasted in silently resentful moods.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:01.000
If one has any concern for the bottom line, it seems one has little alternative but to try to be a bit nice.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.700
Work relationships are no less tricky than romantic ones, but at least in the latter,

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:13.000
we have a basic sense of security that enables one to speak one’s mind and make the necessary cathartic moves,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.500
to call them fuckwits and compress a range of ideas in the occasional expletive loaded outburst.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:30.000
The office environment misses out on the cleansing frankness seemingly possible only when two people know they will have the option of having sex together after the bust-up.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.700
At the heart of our office agonies is the complaint that we seldom like our colleagues as people.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:44.000
In a better world, we would be unlikely ever to want to spend any time at all with such disturbing, and often unlikely, figures.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:51.500
We shouldn’t be surprised by our daily discomfort, given that these people were never picked out on the basis of psychological compatibility.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:59.600
We were formed into a unit because they had a range of technical and commercial competences necessary for a task,

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.700
not because they were fun lunch companions or were graced with a pleasing manner.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.200
We are like the unfortunate bride in a power-marriage in the middle ages.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:17.100
A princess would be obliged to marry a certain prince because he owned an important led mine or the archers in his country were especially proficient.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:25.300
It would have been nice if the two liked each other a bit as well, but the stakes were generally far too high for this to be a relevant factor.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:30.800
The success of the realm depended on such matters as access to raw materials and military strength,

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.700
not on whether the partner had a maddening giggle or a daunting overbite.

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.680
To work well around colleagues requires not talent per se,.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.760
but success at a range of dark psychological arts best summoned up by the word 'politics'

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:53.900
But political skill has woefully little in common with the reasons we were trained and hired to do our jobs in the first place.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:04:04.100
We may, as part of a good business education, have spent years studying the way to navigate a balance sheet, analyse competitors, negotiate contracts, and administer a logistics chain.

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:12.200
But life at work requires quite different skills: the capacity to quietly accept glory for things that were not truly our doing;

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.480
to distance ourselves from errors in which we were heavily  implicated; to subtly foreground the failings of otherwise quite able colleagues;

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:26.700
to turn cold at key moments towards emotionally vulnerable superiors; to flatter while not appearing to do so;

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:31.100
to mould our views to suit the currently ascendant attitudes.

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:37.800
Our inevitable difficulties are aggravated by notions that offices are at heart really giant families,

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.800
Our inevitable difficulties are aggravated by notions that offices are at heart really giant families,

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:45.000
that colleagues can be friends, that honesty is rewarded and that talent will win out.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.500
Kindly sentimentality is in the end, just a disguised version of cruelty.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:57.300
It might be a lot simpler if, in dark moments, we could simply admit to what we know in our hearts:

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:03.100
that it would obviously be a great deal better if we could be shot of the whole business of colleagues and

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:09.700
could instead spend our days, as we used to do so well, on our own.
