00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.740
CCDA documents are assembled
from templates,

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.200
which are essentially
reusable XML components.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:14.455
Templates can be constructed at the
document, section, or data entry level.

00:00:14.455 --> 00:00:17.630
These correspond conceptually
to the parts of a paper form,

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.920
where the document as
a whole consists of sections,

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:28.000
each of which consists of fields where
specific data items can be recorded.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.590
Here at the document level,
sections are specified.

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.350
And within those,
data elements are specified.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:41.770
In this case, a clinical observation,
which is recorded as free text.
