00:00:00.733 --> 00:00:01.501
(bass driven rock music)

00:00:01.534 --> 00:00:02.168
- [Sam Voiceover] This.

00:00:02.201 --> 00:00:03.403
 This is it.

00:00:03.436 --> 00:00:04.771
 The spot where comics go after

00:00:04.804 --> 00:00:07.473
the show to just shoot the shit.

00:00:07.506 --> 00:00:11.444
  Tonight, I'm here to work,
  to write new material.

00:00:12.845 --> 00:00:13.646
 - I'll have the usual.

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.616
 Thanks, doll. (laughs)

00:00:16.649 --> 00:00:17.450
 - Sam!

00:00:17.483 --> 00:00:18.451
My man.

00:00:18.484 --> 00:00:19.352
 How we doin'?

00:00:19.385 --> 00:00:21.387
- Oh, hey Mark.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.655
 - It's Tim.

00:00:22.688 --> 00:00:23.489
 - Right, right, right.

00:00:23.522 --> 00:00:24.690
  I'm good.

00:00:24.723 --> 00:00:25.658
 You know, just doing
 shows, the norm.

00:00:25.691 --> 00:00:26.959
  - Oh, yes.

00:00:26.992 --> 00:00:28.327
  Isn't it the best?

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.196
  All I need is a
  microphone in front of me,

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:31.998
 and a brick wall behind me,

00:00:32.031 --> 00:00:34.100
  and that raw truth
  just takes over.

00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:35.068
 No bullshit.

00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:36.035
 - Right, right, right, right.

00:00:36.068 --> 00:00:37.236
 Yeah, same.

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:40.707
Just a bare bones
comedian here. (laughs)

00:00:42.341 --> 00:00:43.776
 - Thank you, Reggie.

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:44.610
 - It's actually Luke.

00:00:44.643 --> 00:00:45.878
 - Oh my God.

00:00:45.911 --> 00:00:47.380
 You two are literally
 obsessed with names.

00:00:47.413 --> 00:00:49.482
 - Yo, when the
 crowd is in my hand,

00:00:49.515 --> 00:00:51.217
 comedians are like rock stars.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.486
  Hold on, wait, we're like
  the new philosophers.

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:54.921
 Oh wait, we're like those--

00:00:54.954 --> 00:00:55.888
 - Yeah, I'm actually
 trying to write

00:00:55.921 --> 00:00:57.057
 right now, so could you not?

00:00:58.324 --> 00:00:59.893
  I mean, not trying
  to be rude, just.

00:01:03.395 --> 00:01:06.432
- [Sam Voiceover] Okay,
now back to writing.

00:01:06.465 --> 00:01:08.367
 New material.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.502
 It's gotta be honest.

00:01:12.004 --> 00:01:14.941
 No, I need to be now.

00:01:14.974 --> 00:01:16.910
 I need to tackle the
 political climate.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:25.818
 Yes!

00:01:25.851 --> 00:01:26.686
 This is it.

00:01:27.753 --> 00:01:30.457
 Hard hitting, honest,
 and political.

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:35.061
 I don't know, maybe
 it's too harsh.

00:01:35.094 --> 00:01:36.729
 I'm not Bill Hicks, after all.

00:01:40.866 --> 00:01:41.668
 - There it is.

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:44.770
 My new bit.

00:01:44.803 --> 00:01:45.605
- Is that a bit?

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:47.940
 Yeah, that's a bit.

00:01:47.973 --> 00:01:49.575
 I like that, 'cause it's like,

00:01:49.608 --> 00:01:51.911
 is Macri dead?

00:01:51.944 --> 00:01:53.846
 I don't know! (laughs)

00:01:53.879 --> 00:01:54.747
- I know, right?

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.149
- Keep that, keep that.

00:01:56.182 --> 00:01:58.551
  - I'm incredible. (laughs)

00:01:58.584 --> 00:01:59.819
  Pills for the bar.
