well science is telling us that we can

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:14.780
well science is telling us that we can
 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.580
well science is telling us that we can
do phenomenal things if we put our minds

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:18.590
do phenomenal things if we put our minds
 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.650
do phenomenal things if we put our minds
and our resources to it I mean I think

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:20.660
and our resources to it I mean I think
 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.050
and our resources to it I mean I think
science is probably the best example of

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:23.060
science is probably the best example of
 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.109
science is probably the best example of
you put resources into something and you

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:26.119
you put resources into something and you
 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:28.390
you put resources into something and you
let the creativity and the brilliance of

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:28.400
let the creativity and the brilliance of
 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.160
let the creativity and the brilliance of
the minds throughout the world and

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.170

good things can happen you've got to
 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.560
good things can happen you've got to
make sure that there's checks and

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570
make sure that there's checks and
 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.210
make sure that there's checks and
balances on that because science can

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:40.220
balances on that because science can
 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.310
balances on that because science can
also lead to things that are not so good

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320
also lead to things that are not so good
 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.869

and you're going to use discovery for
the betterment of mankind I think

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680
the betterment of mankind I think
 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.609
the betterment of mankind I think
science stands out among what some of

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619
science stands out among what some of
 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:12.730
science stands out among what some of
the most important endeavors that the

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740
the most important endeavors that the
 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.540
the most important endeavors that the
humankind can pursue mankind evolves I

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:16.550
humankind can pursue mankind evolves I
 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.310
humankind can pursue mankind evolves I
mean there's no doubt that we have

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320
mean there's no doubt that we have
 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.000
mean there's no doubt that we have
evolved the whole issue of evolving

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.010
evolved the whole issue of evolving
 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.850
evolved the whole issue of evolving
through various lower species to our own

through various lower species to our own
 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.970
through various lower species to our own
species of the human but there's also

species of the human but there's also
 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.110

the continuing evolution that is
 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.390
the continuing evolution that is
associated with mankind and a lot of

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400
associated with mankind and a lot of
 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.280
associated with mankind and a lot of
that is using what specifically and

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290
that is using what specifically and
 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.440
that is using what specifically and
particularly and peculiarly makes you a

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450
particularly and peculiarly makes you a
 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:42.520
particularly and peculiarly makes you a
human being

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530
human being
 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.980
human being
and that is your intellect and your will

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990
and that is your intellect and your will
 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.830
and that is your intellect and your will
you have a choice you can analyze things

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840
you have a choice you can analyze things
 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.780
you have a choice you can analyze things
and you can act in an intellectual

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790
and you can act in an intellectual
 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.600
and you can act in an intellectual
manner and that is to me that the very

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610
manner and that is to me that the very
 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.390
manner and that is to me that the very
foundation of what science is how you

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400
foundation of what science is how you
 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.740
foundation of what science is how you
can better your own lot the lot of the

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750
can better your own lot the lot of the
 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.649
can better your own lot the lot of the
other citizens of the world while you're

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659
other citizens of the world while you're
 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:05.230
other citizens of the world while you're
paying attention to and preserving the

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240
paying attention to and preserving the
 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.850
paying attention to and preserving the
world you live in which is the reason

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860
world you live in which is the reason
 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.669
world you live in which is the reason
why things like the environment are so

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679
why things like the environment are so
 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.610
why things like the environment are so
so important when we try and analyze all

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620
so important when we try and analyze all
 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.830
so important when we try and analyze all
we doing things that are detrimental to

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840
we doing things that are detrimental to
 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.009
we doing things that are detrimental to
the environment and if so how do we stop

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:18.019
the environment and if so how do we stop
 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:20.440
the environment and if so how do we stop
it and if we have to stop it how do we

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450
it and if we have to stop it how do we
 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.149
it and if we have to stop it how do we
replace it with something that's

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:22.159
replace it with something that's
 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:24.030
replace it with something that's
environmentally free

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040
environmentally free
 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.339
environmentally free
and I think science is going to lead us

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:26.349
and I think science is going to lead us
 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:28.440
and I think science is going to lead us
there and it's the goodwill that you

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450
there and it's the goodwill that you
 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.539
there and it's the goodwill that you
have to try and preserve your own

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:30.549
have to try and preserve your own
 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:32.130
have to try and preserve your own
species as well as preserve the

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140
species as well as preserve the
 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.970
species as well as preserve the
environment ie our planet so that we can

environment ie our planet so that we can
 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.390
environment ie our planet so that we can
have thousands of more years of people

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400
have thousands of more years of people
 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:45.690
have thousands of more years of people
doing good things in leading good lives

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700
 
 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.380
 
bioethics is a very very important field

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390
bioethics is a very very important field
 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.960
bioethics is a very very important field
we as as we get more and more in the

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970
we as as we get more and more in the
 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.270
we as as we get more and more in the
arena of understanding science and

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280
arena of understanding science and
 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.330
arena of understanding science and
getting better opportunities the fact

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340
getting better opportunities the fact
 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.030
getting better opportunities the fact
that you can do things with biological

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040
that you can do things with biological
 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.660
that you can do things with biological
sciences that have an impact on a human

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670
sciences that have an impact on a human
 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.090
sciences that have an impact on a human
being means you must have ethical

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100
being means you must have ethical
 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.880
being means you must have ethical
standards and and paramount among these

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890
standards and and paramount among these
 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.190
standards and and paramount among these
are when you do something that involves

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200
are when you do something that involves
 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.229
are when you do something that involves
a human subject as one example there are

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239
a human subject as one example there are
 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.180
a human subject as one example there are
a lot of bioethical issues but for

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190
a lot of bioethical issues but for
 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.009
a lot of bioethical issues but for
example if you're trying to develop a

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019
example if you're trying to develop a
 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:23.500
example if you're trying to develop a
new drug or a new vaccine and you need

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510
new drug or a new vaccine and you need
 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.780
new drug or a new vaccine and you need
to do experimentation there has to be

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790
to do experimentation there has to be
 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.140
to do experimentation there has to be
some fundamental immutable principles of

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150
some fundamental immutable principles of
 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.990
some fundamental immutable principles of
ethics that guide what you can and

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000
ethics that guide what you can and
 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
ethics that guide what you can and
cannot do when you're dealing with

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010
cannot do when you're dealing with
 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.080
cannot do when you're dealing with
another human being

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090
another human being
 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.330
another human being
and there are also fundamental things

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340
and there are also fundamental things
 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.460
and there are also fundamental things
that you can it cannot do when you're

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470
that you can it cannot do when you're
 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.020
that you can it cannot do when you're
dealing with life itself

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030
dealing with life itself
 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.360
dealing with life itself
I mean is it or is it not ethical to

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370
I mean is it or is it not ethical to
 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.680
I mean is it or is it not ethical to
create an embryo and to create a person

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690
create an embryo and to create a person
 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.440
create an embryo and to create a person
for the purpose of getting an organ to

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450
for the purpose of getting an organ to
 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.030
for the purpose of getting an organ to
give to someone else I mean your

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040
give to someone else I mean your
 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.550
give to someone else I mean your
knee-jerk reaction is absolutely not

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560
knee-jerk reaction is absolutely not
 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.710
knee-jerk reaction is absolutely not
but you need the ethical analysis of

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720
but you need the ethical analysis of
 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.770
but you need the ethical analysis of
that to show why and how that is

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780
that to show why and how that is
 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.600
that to show why and how that is
something that you need to stay away

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.610
something that you need to stay away
 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:05.680
something that you need to stay away
from so I think that bioethics is one of

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690
from so I think that bioethics is one of
 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.590
from so I think that bioethics is one of
the most important evolving fields that

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600
the most important evolving fields that
 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.650
the most important evolving fields that
we have because as science gets more and

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660
we have because as science gets more and
 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.390
we have because as science gets more and
more sophisticated and as the

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400
more sophisticated and as the
 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.430
more sophisticated and as the
opportunities for transforming

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440
opportunities for transforming
 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.640
opportunities for transforming
Biological Sciences occur we're going to

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650
Biological Sciences occur we're going to
 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:20.650
Biological Sciences occur we're going to
be faced with more and more important

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660
be faced with more and more important
 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.409
be faced with more and more important
ethical questions and we can approach

that by the seat of our pants we have to
 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.600
that by the seat of our pants we have to
have experts who study that and make

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610
have experts who study that and make
 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.990
have experts who study that and make
that a career of analyzing the kinds of

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000
that a career of analyzing the kinds of
 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.150
that a career of analyzing the kinds of
ethical issues and gaining experience so

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160
ethical issues and gaining experience so

that when people come in and they're
 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.350
that when people come in and they're
faced with a question of ethics in the

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360
faced with a question of ethics in the
 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.750
faced with a question of ethics in the
biological sciences at least you have a

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760
biological sciences at least you have a
 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.700
biological sciences at least you have a
catcher of people who pay serious

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710
catcher of people who pay serious
 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:45.580
