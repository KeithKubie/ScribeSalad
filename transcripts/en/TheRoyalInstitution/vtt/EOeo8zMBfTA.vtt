00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.840
So we recorded Lecture one last
night, and we're just

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.900
rehearsing Lecture three,
I think, at the moment.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.405
So it's surrounded by
the paraphernalia of

00:00:21.405 --> 00:00:21.760
the Lectures to come.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.700
But I just wanted to take a
moment to tell you about the

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.560
Ames room behind me, which
was one of the

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.450
demos from last night.

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:31.780
I don't think we actually
mentioned it was

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:32.680
called an Ames room.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.810
It's named after Adelbert Ames,
which is a great name,

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.840
who was an ophthalmologist. I
don't know what he was doing

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.600
inventing distorted perspective
rooms like this

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.850
but he did.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.520
So quite early on, we decided
we wanted to build one of

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.220
these on this scale.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.450
I was hoping, Andy, you might
be able to make an

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:52.430
Ames room for us.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:53.792
Yeah, I like that comment.

00:00:53.792 --> 00:00:54.684
Did you notice that -

00:00:54.684 --> 00:00:55.350
Oh, I didn't see
that actually.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.400
No, that'd be really good fun.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.530
It has to be fairly large.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:58.030
Yeah.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.080
Choose two kids who are the
same height, and you can

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.140
measure them up and then be sure
and then they walk into

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.470
it, and they walk backwards
and forwards, and you

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.430
literally see them growing.

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.700
And it's extraordinary.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.990
We started looking on
the net for plans of

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.260
how we might do this.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.400
Downloaded a couple which seemed
not particularly good,

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.690
so we thought we'd do all the
calculations ourselves and

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.390
work out exactly how to go
about building this.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.060
So that manifested itself
in fairly complicated

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.450
spreadsheets, which gave
rise to prototype

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.850
one, which is here.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.210
I don't think you can really see
into it through that hole.

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.360
But you look through that
hole, and you see...

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.530
If I look through, I can
just about see a room.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.510
So this gave me the confidence
that we could make something

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:42.240
roughly right.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.560
So the next stage was to build
a slightly more serious scale

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.380
model of what we wanted
to build.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.260
Roughly a one-tenths
scale of the main.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.170
Once we'd made this, I was
pretty confident that we could

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.920
make the real thing and
make it look good.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.140
I hadn't anticipated some of the
woodwork challenges that

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.900
were to come.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.020
So this took about three or
four days work to build.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.910
And when I say days, I'm talking
24 hours, basically.

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:09.150
It's almost nonstop
work on this.

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:11.039
There were three of us,
me and Mellis and

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.310
Gaz making this room.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.520
Some of the beams at the far
end, there's some really weird

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.280
double compound cuts going on.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.380
So it's pretty complicated
stuff.

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.050
And one of those days was just
decorating it, and finding

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.872
some nice pictures from the
collection, which is quite a

00:02:25.872 --> 00:02:26.390
nice touch, I think.

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.070
We probably finished off the
floor about 45 minutes before

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.870
the start of the show
last night.

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.590
So it was typical last-minute
stuff.

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.010
It was really great to see it
work as well as it did on

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.060
camera last night.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.310
It was really fantastic.

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.190
If you did ever wonder what on
earth you learned trigonometry

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:50.990
for, this is it right here.
