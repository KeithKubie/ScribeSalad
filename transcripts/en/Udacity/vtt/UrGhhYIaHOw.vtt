00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
We have three answers--we can quickly rule out these because these should be less likely

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
from a loaded coin that's disproportionately heads since they each have more tails than heads.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
We can also say that if four heads in a row is sufficient evidence

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
that we have a loaded coin 10 and 20 heads should be two.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So let's just evaluate this for the four heads' case.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:36.000
So the probability of having four heads in a row from a loaded coin is going to be 0.6561.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Whereas the probability for a fair coin is 0.0625 but remember

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:55.000
this just gives us the probability of flips given fair and given loaded.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
What is we have to multiply each of these by the probability of fair

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and the probability of loaded and so those are.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
So we can see here the probability of having a loaded coin times the probability of the flips

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:18.000
given the loaded coin is 0.06561 and the probability of having

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
the same flips with a fair coin times its probability is 0.05625.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Together they are equal to P of flips.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:37.000
So only one of these divided by that can be greater than 50% so it's going to be the bigger one

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.000
that's going to be P of loaded, and if P of loaded given flips is greater than 0.5

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
then P of fair must be less.

00:01:48.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So this is true which means this is true and this is true.
