00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.650
Now that we discussed softer process models, there is

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:05.100
another important point I want to cover, because it's going to

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.970
be useful for your projects. Documenting the activities carried out

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.660
during the different phases of the softer lifecycle, is a

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.960
very important task. The documents that we produce are used

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.270
for different purposes, such as communicative details of the software

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.650
systems. To difference the colors, ensure the correct implementation of

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.630
the system, facilitate maintenance, and so on. There are standardized

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.230
document that are provided by IEEE that you can use

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.680
for this purpose. However, they're kind of heavyweight. So for the

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.090
project in this class, when we will need them, I will

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.760
rather use this lightweight documents. That we created by modifying the

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.730
original ones, and make them a little simpler. In this,

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.700
our documents are actually used, while teaching this class in the

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.600
past. So they're well tested and work well for the kind

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.730
of projects that we will perform. I provide information on how

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.880
to access these documents in the class notes.
