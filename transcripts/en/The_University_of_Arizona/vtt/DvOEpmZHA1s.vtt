00:00:19.144 --> 00:00:19.685
Good evening.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.060
My name is Joaquin Ruiz.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.530
I'm dean of the
College of Science.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:33.840
And I welcome you all to today's
lecture from our series, Next.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.340
Today, we have the
pleasure of having

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.150
with us one of the premier
philosophers from the world,

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.410
actually, and from
this country for sure,

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.770
Dr. Dennett, who will be telling
us a little bit about how

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.690
we have changed our views
about things since Darwin.

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.730
This lecture series, this is
the fourth lecture series now

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.340
that the College of
Science has produced.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.680
And as I was telling somebody
as I was walking down the aisle,

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.630
this is quite a
symbiotic kind of thing.

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.570
And we will be happy to
continue these lecture series

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.100
as long as you keep showing up.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.040
And in fact, I'm incredibly
proud to be in a community that

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.680
brings as many people as
we do in our community

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.750
to listen to science.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.180
These lectures are expensive.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.750
And there are many people
that support the lecture.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:43.060
Cox Communication, Bob
Davis, the Galileo circle,

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.280
who are members of
our community that

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.750
support the College of Science,
[INAUDIBLE] Design, Tom

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.330
and Candy Grogan, Jeff and
[? Shelley ?] Owen, Raytheon,

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.410
Research Corporation,
and UniSource Energy.

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.610
Today, I am thrilled, in fact,
that the individual that's

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.600
going to be
introducing our speaker

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:14.680
is Dr. Taylor, who is
the president of Research

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.330
Corporation in town.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.750
So it ends up being that
this high tech energy has

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.670
a humanist running it.

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.320
And he will be introducing
our speaker tonight.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.823
Taylor Lawrence, where are you?

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.460
Thanks, Dean Ruiz.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.780
I'm actually
president of Raytheon.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.360
A little bit bigger,
but you know.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.450
But it's a pleasure to be here.

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.720
I moved from our corporate
headquarters in Massachusetts

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.350
back in June to take over for
Louise Francis Francesconi who

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.480
retired on July 1.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.270
I must say I'm not missing
the winter weather back

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:01.500
in Massachusetts.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.290
But I also have to say that
on a night like tonight when

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.090
it's below 60, people think it's
very wicked weather here too.

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.180
So I appreciate all
of you coming out

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.330
on such a horrid night
here in Arizona to attend.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:15.930
Well Raytheon is
very proud to be

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.490
a part of this lecture series.

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:20.910
We're in our fourth year
of providing support

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.980
to make this free to the public.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.430
And one of our
struggles at Raytheon,

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.850
and I recently spoke
to the Board of Regents

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.330
here at U of A,
is promoting math,

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.050
and science, and engineering,
and technology education

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.100
to our young people, and getting
them excited about careers

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.640
in STEM types of fields.

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.740
And I'm very, very
disturbed by some

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.140
of the things that are
going on in our community

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.940
today, especially
with the economy

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.910
and with some of the
actions of our legislature.

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.161
And strongly support
strong funding

00:03:57.161 --> 00:03:58.410
for the University of Arizona.

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.240
And I hope we can turn
a corner and come back.

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:11.510
Because we need
a steady pipeline

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.550
of talent in this state.

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.710
We need it to preserve
the high technology

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:18.350
jobs that we have in the state.

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.370
And I feel very privileged that
we have such a fine university

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.440
and a distinguished
college of science

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.025
right here-- right
here in Tucson.

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.190
And one of the things
I've learned about

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.370
is U of A's Ecology and
Evolutionary Biology

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.870
Department.

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.930
I didn't realize
that in 1975, it

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.930
was the first of its
kind in the world.

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.760
And now most of the
top universities

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.470
have EEB departments.

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:52.790
But ours is ranked in the
top 10% of all such programs.

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:56.270
And just as impressive, the
physical sciences at the U of A

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.390
were recently ranked number
one by the National Science

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:01.409
Foundation among
all universities

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:02.450
within the United States.

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.980
And tonight, in celebration
of Darwin's 200th birthday,

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:19.760
I'm honored to introduce
Dr. Daniel C. Dennett.

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:23.060
Dr. Dennett is university
professor, an Austin B.

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.250
Fletcher professor
of philosophy,

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.900
and co-director at the Center
for Cognitive Studies at Tufts

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.510
University.

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:34.160
He received his BA in
philosophy from Harvard in 1963,

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.140
the year I was born.

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:38.300
So I'm kind of a young guy.

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.630
He then went to Oxford to work
with Gilbert Ryle, under whose

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:46.790
supervision he completed the
DPhil in philosophy in 1965.

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:50.690
He taught at UC-Irvine
from 1965 to 1971

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:54.500
when he moved to Tufts, where
he has taught ever since, aside

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:58.760
from periods visiting at
Harvard, Pittsburgh, Oxford,

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:02.564
and the [INAUDIBLE] in Paris.

00:06:02.564 --> 00:06:04.730
He's the author of a book
that's a favorite of mine.

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:06.313
In fact, I pulled
it out of my library

00:06:06.313 --> 00:06:09.590
and brought it along--
Darwin's Dangerous Idea.

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:11.360
I bought this back in 1995.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.420
It's been in my
library ever since.

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:17.150
His most recent book,
Breaking the Spell:

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:21.020
Religion is a Natural
Phenomenon was published in 2006

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.210
by Viking Press.

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:26.270
He has received two Guggenheim
fellowships, a Fulbright

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:28.430
fellowship, and a
fellowship at the Center

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:31.040
for Advanced Studies
and Behavioral Science,

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.570
and many, many other awards.

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:34.220
Ladies and gentlemen,
please join me

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:35.980
in welcoming Dr. Daniel Dennett.

00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:58.020
Thank you very much.

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:00.510
I am honored to be here
and to see so many of you

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:01.920
in this audience.

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:05.880
This is a special
occasion indeed.

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.880
But let's get started.

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:12.510
As a philosopher, I
have to face the fact--

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:15.180
and all philosophers
do, I think--

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:17.790
that some of the
greatest thinkers

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:23.600
that we philosophers have to
consider were not philosophers.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.320
Here's five of the
most important.

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:30.540
I haven't labeled them so
you can see who they are.

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:31.639
All right.

00:07:31.639 --> 00:07:32.430
Call out the names.

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:34.140
Starting from left
to right it is?

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:35.090
Newton

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:35.655
Newton.

00:07:35.655 --> 00:07:36.155
Next.

00:07:36.155 --> 00:07:36.920
Einstein.

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:37.830
Yes.

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:38.330
Next.

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:39.220
[INAUDIBLE]

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:39.770
Yes.

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:40.726
Who's the next one?

00:07:40.726 --> 00:07:41.226
Godel.

00:07:41.226 --> 00:07:41.610
Godel.

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:42.401
Yeah, that's right.

00:07:42.401 --> 00:07:44.070
That's Kurt Godel.

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:45.090
And finally there's?

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:46.060
Turing.s

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:46.560
Turing.

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:47.059
OK.

00:07:47.059 --> 00:07:48.270
Indeed, you're right.

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:52.500
So these are all philosophers
who weren't philosophers--

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:55.680
very important thinkers
who are important

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:58.320
to philosophical thought.

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:01.200
But the number one
philosopher, in my opinion,

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:05.760
who wasn't a philosopher has got
to be this one, Charles Darwin.

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:07.800
Now when I show this
picture sometimes

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:08.910
I get a sort of laugh.

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:10.846
I don't know what this is about.

00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:16.360
I don't know why.

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:19.330
I don't, myself, see any
reason for that laugh.

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:22.450
But we can get it
behind us, and then we

00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:25.670
can get on to other things.

00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:32.200
So why was Darwin's
idea so great?

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:36.039
I think the answer is really
quite straightforward.

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:40.179
Darwin's idea of evolution
by natural selection united

00:08:40.179 --> 00:08:43.659
the two most disparate
parts of our universe--

00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:47.570
the world of purposeless
causation on the one hand--

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:51.160
the world of physics
and chemistry--

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:55.630
with a world of meaning-- the
world of ethics and poetry.

00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:59.030
So we go all the way from
physics to ethics and poetry,

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:01.420
and even beyond
that to morality,

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:05.120
all in one unified perspective.

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:08.630
No other scientific idea
or philosophical idea

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:15.750
so grandly unifies
everything that exists

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:18.960
under a single perspective.

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:21.510
It's not as if there wasn't
an earlier perspective that

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:24.770
had the same aspiration.

00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:27.240
The pre-Darwinian
world view is made

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:30.750
famous-- among other
places-- in the ceiling

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:33.390
of the Sistine
Chapel, Michelangelo's

00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:35.130
famous paintings.

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:40.380
And in the center, we
see God, the Creator,

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:45.360
putting the finishing
touches on Adam.

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:49.290
I want to call this
the trickle-down theory

00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:49.920
of creation.

00:09:56.740 --> 00:10:00.340
Adam is pretty wonderful, but
he is the creation of something

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:02.690
more wonderful still.

00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:07.410
Adam is pretty smart, but
his creator is even smarter,

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:10.550
even more intelligent.

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:16.200
And I think that this idea
may have even been obvious.

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:19.370
Even to our ancestors,
this may be an idea

00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:22.010
that's older than our species.

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:26.890
Homo habilis was a hominid
that made very simple tools--

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:30.800
chipped stone flakes mainly.

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:35.050
And I think that maybe Homo
habilis had some dim sense

00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:38.680
that it always takes a
big, fancy, smart thing

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:40.190
to make a lesser thing.

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:45.730
You never see a pot
making a potter.

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:50.620
You never come across a
horseshoe making a blacksmith.

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:55.660
It's always big, smart, fancy
things making lesser things

00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:56.890
of one sort or another.

00:10:56.890 --> 00:10:59.560
That's the trickle-down
theory of creation.

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:03.190
And it seems, indeed,
quite obvious.

00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:07.060
Along comes Darwin with what we
may call the bubble-up theory

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:09.660
of creation.

00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:12.210
And here, I though,
Darwin's birthday,

00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:15.810
we really should have a little
quotation from Darwin himself.

00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:22.770
And what I've chosen is
simply a great long sentence

00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:27.270
at the end of chapter
four of Origin of Species,

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:33.435
which captures all on one page
the main points of the theory.

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:39.090
It has often been said
one long argument.

00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:44.120
I'm going to bring out the
argument by highlighting it.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:47.190
"If, during the
long course of ages

00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:49.470
and under varying
conditions of life,

00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:53.160
organic beings vary at
all in the several parts

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:55.270
of their organization.

00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:58.080
And I think this
cannot be disputed."

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:00.270
He puts in a little empirical.

00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:04.810
He says, that's a premise
that everybody should accept.

00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:08.020
"If there be owing to the high
geometric powers of increase

00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:11.110
of each species that some
age, season, or year,

00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:17.190
a severe struggle for life, this
certainly cannot be disputed.

00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:20.610
Then considering the
infinite complexity

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:23.430
of the relations of all
organic beings to each other

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:25.920
and to their conditions
of existence causing

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:28.470
an infinite diversity and
structure of constitution

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:31.140
in the habits to be
advantageous to them,

00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:33.450
I think it would be a
most extraordinary fact

00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:36.960
if no variation ever had
occurred useful to each beings

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:40.170
own welfare in the same way
that so many variations have

00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:42.210
occurred useful to man."

00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:44.130
Now the punchline.

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:49.320
"But if variations useful to
any organic being do occur,

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:52.110
assuredly individuals
thus characterized

00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:54.030
will have the best
chance of being preserved

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:55.710
in the struggle for life.

00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:59.280
And from the strong
principle of inheritance,

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:00.960
they will tend to
produce offspring

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:03.650
similarly characterized.

00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:05.900
This principle of
preservation I have

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:09.080
called, for the sake of
brevity, natural selection."

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:10.430
That's it.

00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:16.155
That is a beautiful, succinct
summary of Darwin's great idea.

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:23.060
On the face of it, it
may not seem so shocking.

00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:27.290
But to many people, it seemed to
be a deeply subversive and even

00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:29.150
outrageous idea.

00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:34.610
A critic named MacKenzie
summed it up-- not right away,

00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:40.640
but in 1868 in a piece published
in the Athenaeum, which

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:44.480
was sort of the London
Review of Books of its day.

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:49.630
And here is MacKenzie's
observation about this theory.

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:55.570
"In theory with which
we have to deal,

00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:59.420
absolute ignorance
is the artificer so

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:02.360
that we may enunciate as
the fundamental principle

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:04.970
of the whole system
that in order

00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:07.340
to make a perfect,
a beautiful, machine

00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:10.820
it is not requisite to
know how to make it."

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:14.450
The capital letters
are in the original.

00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:18.380
This is a man in high dudgeon.

00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:22.670
"This proposition will be
found, on careful examination,

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:26.690
to express in condensed
form the essential purport

00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:29.690
of the theory, and to
express in a few words

00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:35.150
all Mr. Darwin's meaning--
who, by a strange inversion

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:40.360
of reasoning, seems to think
absolute ignorance fully

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:43.480
qualified to take the
place of absolute wisdom

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:47.470
in all the achievements
of creative skill."

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:49.450
Exactly.

00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:51.070
That's it.

00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:52.150
He's got it.

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:57.940
That's just exactly the
purport of Mr. Darwin's theory.

00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:02.380
It is a strange
inversion of reasoning.

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:07.390
It flies in the face of
common sense principles

00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:10.950
that go back to Homo
habilis perhaps.

00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:15.690
So obvious does it seem to so
many people that this cannot be

00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:20.220
right that a creationist
pamphlet that was sent to me

00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:24.580
by a student sort of mocks it.

00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:26.200
Test two.

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:30.290
Do you know of any building
that didn't have a builder?

00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:33.460
Do you know of any painting
that didn't have a painter?

00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:37.060
Do you know of any car
that didn't have a maker?

00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:41.460
If you answered yes for any
of the above, give details.

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:42.360
Ah ha.

00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:50.360
This challenge thrown in
the face of Darwinians

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:55.070
perfectly expresses the sense
of just utter incredulity

00:15:55.070 --> 00:16:00.300
with which many people
greet Darwin's great idea.

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:04.420
And yet Darwin says,
no I can't show

00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:08.320
you a building, or a
painting, or a car.

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:14.980
But everything in the biosphere
has exactly this property

00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:17.320
that you find so
impossible to accept.

00:16:20.770 --> 00:16:23.830
I mentioned Alan Turing
a few minutes ago

00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:27.310
as another great thinker.

00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:33.230
And I want to point out a deep
commonality between this Brit

00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:37.110
and that other Brit,
Charles Darwin.

00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:42.910
I want to talk about Turing's
strange inversion of reasoning

00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:44.500
so that you can compare the two.

00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:51.770
Before Turing, there
were computers.

00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:55.080
Mostly they had
degrees in mathematics.

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:58.670
Some of them, as you
can see, wore dresses.

00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:00.670
They were people.

00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:01.610
That was their job.

00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:03.520
They were called computers.

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:06.961
They worked in offices,
and they did computation.

00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:14.890
In the old days, computers
had to understand arithmetic,

00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:18.790
had to appreciate the reasons
for what they were doing.

00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:21.726
Turing recognized that
this was not a necessity.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.030
In his 1936 paper on
computable numbers,

00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:30.580
he puts it this way-- "the
behavior of the computer

00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:33.070
at any moment is determined
by the symbols which

00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:35.950
he is observing and his
state of mind at the moment,"

00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:37.930
putting "state of mind"
in quotation marks

00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:44.850
to suggest that this was
an illimitable feature.

00:17:44.850 --> 00:17:47.000
So now let's compare
Darwin and Turing.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.580
Here's Darwin strange idea, his
strange inversion of reasoning.

00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:57.900
And I've used MacKenzie's
words in their caps.

00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:59.050
And here's Turing's.

00:17:59.050 --> 00:18:03.540
"In order to be a perfect and
beautiful computing machine,

00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:07.480
it is not requisite to
know what arithmetic is."

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:12.190
Now this strikes many people
as just about as preposterous

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:13.900
as Darwin's inversion.

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:19.280
Although we do know,
thanks to the last 75

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:25.400
years of computer development,
that, indeed, it is true.

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:32.040
Indeed, Turing's strange
inversion is widely-accepted.

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:33.600
Put the two together.

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:35.700
"In order to make a perfect
and beautiful machine,

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:37.890
it's not requisite to
know how to make it.

00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:40.680
In order to be perfect and
beautiful computing machine,

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:43.860
it is not requisite to
know what arithmetic is."

00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:48.210
In fact, they're
almost the same point

00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:50.120
applied in different domains.

00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:56.910
Now many people just can't abide
Darwin's strange inversion.

00:18:56.910 --> 00:18:58.440
We call them creationists.

00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:03.410
Oh, what happened?

00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:04.490
I left out something.

00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:06.614
There.

00:19:06.614 --> 00:19:08.030
There are other
people who are not

00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:10.130
creationists who
also can't abide

00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:11.649
Darwin's strange inversion.

00:19:11.649 --> 00:19:13.190
There are many people
who can't abide

00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:14.810
Turing's strange inversion.

00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:19.280
I propose that we might
call them mind creationists.

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:23.470
And there are even a few
people who seem to be both.

00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:27.260
In fact, a few very
eminent people.

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:31.190
Simon Conway Morris,
the paleontologist.

00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:36.520
Jerry Fodor, Thomas Nagel-- two
very well-known philosophers.

00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:39.250
Thomas Nagel in a recent
piece in Philosophy and Public

00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:40.050
Affairs.

00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:44.650
John Searle, who has argued
that what he calls original

00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:48.730
intentionality cannot be
achieved by, shall we call it,

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:50.560
Turing's strange inversion.

00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:58.000
Searle treats the mind as
what we might call a skyhook.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.130
So let me explain
my terminology.

00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:02.620
What is a skyhook?

00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:04.930
In Darwin's dangerous
idea, I draw a distinction

00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:08.560
between skyhooks and cranes.

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:13.450
The way to understand this is
to recognize the work of design

00:20:13.450 --> 00:20:17.620
can be considered to be
lifting in design space.

00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:21.250
Imagine the space of all
possible designs of every sort,

00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:22.780
artificial and natural.

00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:27.790
And think of the work of R&amp;D,
research and development,

00:20:27.790 --> 00:20:29.140
as lifting.

00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:30.040
It takes energy.

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:33.430
It takes time in design space.

00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:41.370
Now intelligent design, or
the work of intelligence,

00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:44.220
can be considered then
lifting in design space.

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:47.910
Then skyhooks are
miraculous top-down lifters.

00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:51.210
They are things that just float
high in that space somehow

00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:55.710
without being the products
of a laborious process

00:20:55.710 --> 00:21:01.860
of non-miraculous R&amp;D. Cranes,
in contrast, do good lifting.

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:05.400
But they've been put in position
by non-miraculous bubble-up

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:06.280
processes.

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:13.110
So now we have this
metaphor for understanding

00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:18.450
the relationship between
Darwin's idea and his critics.

00:21:18.450 --> 00:21:24.610
Darwin's bubble-up theory
says, over billions of years,

00:21:24.610 --> 00:21:27.940
non-miraculous,
non-intelligent forces

00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:32.750
have gradually created
more and more design.

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:34.580
And among those
designs are cranes

00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:39.050
which speed up the lifting,
make the lifting more efficient.

00:21:39.050 --> 00:21:42.410
And by these processes
cascaded together,

00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:46.175
we can get anywhere in design
space where anything exists.

00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:50.170
How do you rebut that?

00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:54.450
You look for something
that couldn't

00:21:54.450 --> 00:21:58.380
be arrived at by that bubble-up
process-- something that

00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:02.370
had to come into existence just
hanging there in design space

00:22:02.370 --> 00:22:05.545
thanks to some special act
of intelligent creation.

00:22:09.670 --> 00:22:13.160
It can seem that some design is
too wonderful to have evolved.

00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:17.230
It's irreducibly complex,
requiring a top-down helping

00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:19.160
hand.

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:22.250
So what critics and
skeptics of evolution

00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:26.390
have been looking for
150 years are skyhooks.

00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:31.670
They want to have examples
of living things, phenomena

00:22:31.670 --> 00:22:38.587
in the biosphere, that are so
marvelous, so supercalifragili

00:22:38.587 --> 00:22:42.180
sticexpialidocious,
that there's just

00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:48.920
no path from the Darwinians'
starting point up to them.

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:52.560
They are irreducibly complex.

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:56.160
Over the years,
hunting for skyhooks

00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:58.230
has actually led to
some very good science,

00:22:58.230 --> 00:23:00.080
because people have
looked for skyhooks

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:01.330
and they've discovered cranes.

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:07.570
They think it's impossible that
the following thing could ever

00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:08.830
evolve.

00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:10.690
They set out to prove
that it's impossible.

00:23:10.690 --> 00:23:14.290
And they end up discovering
some new lifting device that

00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:15.910
makes it possible after all.

00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:19.250
I'm going to discuss a
few in a few minutes.

00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:21.010
Now of course, when I
talk about skyhooks,

00:23:21.010 --> 00:23:24.910
this is not what I have in mind.

00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:26.680
Somebody sent me this
photograph recently.

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:28.960
Apparently there's
a lighter than air

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:32.080
company somewhere-- I
think in Europe-- that

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:33.850
makes what they call skyhooks.

00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:37.140
These are really cranes,
because they're non-miraculous.

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:41.230
This is a skyhook.

00:23:47.370 --> 00:23:53.340
This wonderful, satiric drawing
appeared in the Atlantic

00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:56.950
Monthly a few years ago.

00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:59.240
And it's particularly
appropriate,

00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:03.020
because those of you
who are into art history

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:05.090
will recognize that
this is Brunelleschi's

00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:08.450
dome in Florence.

00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:11.740
And at the time it was built,
it was an engineering marvel.

00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:15.530
It was considered one of the
great, almost nearly miraculous

00:24:15.530 --> 00:24:17.270
structures in the world.

00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:19.820
And placing that
lantern on the top

00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:22.640
was the crowning achievement.

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:26.660
This is not, of course, how
Brunelleschi achieved that.

00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:29.180
In fact, how he achieved
it was by inventing

00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:31.130
a whole new series
of cranes that

00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:32.690
had never been seen before.

00:24:32.690 --> 00:24:35.510
And those cranes--
they're like these.

00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:37.730
These are not actually
Brunelleschi's drawings.

00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:41.390
These cranes made
possible the exploration

00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:45.710
of parts of architectural
design space that, heretofore,

00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:47.900
had not been accessible.

00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:51.000
That's how cranes operate.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.170
Well now many people, when
they think about evolution,

00:24:55.170 --> 00:24:58.020
they accept that evolution can
explain some things and not

00:24:58.020 --> 00:24:58.620
others.

00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:01.140
For instance, they're inclined
to say, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:06.530
I think evolution can
explain say, a nightingale,

00:25:06.530 --> 00:25:09.980
but not an ode to a nightingale.

00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:12.700
Really?

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:14.080
You think an ode
to a nightingale

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:18.340
is that much more wonderful
than a nightingale?

00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:22.330
Think of the intricacy, the
wonderfulness of a nightingale.

00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:24.970
If that can be
produced by ultimately

00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:27.340
mechanical,
non-miraculous processes,

00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:29.920
you don't think a
poem could be produced

00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:33.130
by somewhat different but
also non-miraculous processes?

00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:38.780
This is a good example
of the resistance

00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:43.580
that is felt in many quarters
to the Darwinian perspective.

00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:45.110
People say, well yes.

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:47.450
I see how the bubble-up
theory of creation

00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:53.960
can explain a lot of
things-- birds, beaver dams--

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:59.235
but not poems and
not the Hoover Dam.

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:06.190
I think this is
very short-sighted.

00:26:06.190 --> 00:26:09.010
Now I want to sketch
the bubble-up path.

00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:10.690
It'll have to be a
sketch, because there

00:26:10.690 --> 00:26:12.940
isn't that much time.

00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:16.510
Because along the way, I
think we get some insights.

00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:19.220
What we see here is a
cover of Science Magazine

00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:20.320
a few years ago.

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:24.070
And what it shows is a
motor protein trudging along

00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:26.150
inside a cell.

00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:28.660
Now I've used this
diagram for some time.

00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:33.850
And just recently, I
discovered a superb animation

00:26:33.850 --> 00:26:36.790
of a motor protein--
much more realistic

00:26:36.790 --> 00:26:39.665
than this, which I
want to share with you.

00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:14.520
We're made of trillions
of these little fellas.

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:15.750
Really, we are.

00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:18.170
You have trillions of
these in your body.

00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:19.530
Not millions or billions.

00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:20.280
Trillions of them.

00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:21.571
You couldn't live without them.

00:27:21.571 --> 00:27:22.980
And they are not even alive.

00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:23.730
They're proteins.

00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:25.890
They are motor proteins.

00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:31.400
So we're made of trillions
of mindless little robots.

00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:35.960
Not a one of them knows
who we are or cares.

00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:37.956
In fact, not a one of
them knows a darn thing.

00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:46.070
They are, as MacKenzie would
say, absolutely ignorant.

00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:46.760
But stop.

00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:47.510
We know.

00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:50.130
We care.

00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:51.370
How can this be?

00:27:51.370 --> 00:27:52.350
How come?

00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:57.871
How can things that care,
and understand, and know

00:27:57.871 --> 00:28:04.810
be constructed out of mindless
little robots by the trillions?

00:28:04.810 --> 00:28:08.295
That's the task for the
Darwinian bubble-up path

00:28:08.295 --> 00:28:08.795
to explain.

00:28:11.610 --> 00:28:14.440
Along the way, there were
some very important cranes.

00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:16.690
And the one I want
to concentrate on

00:28:16.690 --> 00:28:20.910
is eukaryotic revolution,
which takes us back roughly two

00:28:20.910 --> 00:28:22.930
and a half billion years.

00:28:22.930 --> 00:28:25.480
Life began on this planet
about a billion years

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:26.710
earlier than that.

00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:34.910
So for a billion years, all
there were on this planet

00:28:34.910 --> 00:28:39.110
were simple cells-- so-called
prokaryotes like bacteria.

00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:43.820
And then one day, a
wonderful thing happened.

00:28:47.610 --> 00:28:53.470
Prokaryote A, prokaryote
B bumped into each other.

00:28:53.470 --> 00:29:02.360
And instead of B eating A or
A eating B from the inside,

00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:05.240
B left A intact.

00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:12.910
And A and B joined forces to
become a single thing-- an AB.

00:29:12.910 --> 00:29:18.600
And in this refraining
from eating, you might say,

00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:19.540
well it's a good meal.

00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:22.630
But instead of
having a good meal,

00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:28.360
picked up a billion years of
independent R&amp;D incorporated

00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:30.550
into the structure
of that thing,

00:29:30.550 --> 00:29:33.778
giving it an instant
multiplication of competence.

00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:38.660
It joined forces
with the cell, taking

00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:40.200
advantage of all that design.

00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:48.220
Lynn Margulis is the scientist
at UMass who is responsible,

00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:51.640
I think, for weathering lots
of storms and getting people

00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:55.060
to take this idea
seriously when they didn't.

00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:56.920
It is now textbook fare.

00:29:56.920 --> 00:30:00.430
And many, many
demonstrations and proofs

00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:07.300
of this, the symbiotic origins
of the eukaryotic cells.

00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:11.930
And the eukaryotic cells
are bigger and more complex.

00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:13.096
They have more moving parts.

00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:19.870
On the left, you see a sort of
simple sketch of a prokaryote.

00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:21.580
On the right, a eukaryote.

00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:24.100
And you see the
little yellow ovals.

00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:26.260
Those are mitochondria.

00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:31.500
They have their own DNA, just
the way the prokaryote does.

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:34.650
In fact, you have
your mitochondrial DNA

00:30:34.650 --> 00:30:37.750
and you have your nuclear
DNA in the nucleus.

00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:40.230
So there are sort of
two genomes right there.

00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:43.620
And every cell in your body,
every human cell in your body,

00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:45.450
is a eukaryotic cell.

00:30:45.450 --> 00:30:48.370
And it has its nuclear
DNA, that's your genome.

00:30:48.370 --> 00:30:50.380
And it has its
mitochondrial DNA.

00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:56.940
And that DNA is descended from
that original endosymbiotic

00:30:56.940 --> 00:30:59.650
revolution.

00:30:59.650 --> 00:31:02.290
Eukaryotes are more complex.

00:31:02.290 --> 00:31:03.310
They're more talented.

00:31:03.310 --> 00:31:06.530
They're more versatile.

00:31:06.530 --> 00:31:11.460
This versatility permitted
a division of labor.

00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:14.480
And that permitted
multi-cellular life,

00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:19.030
because you could have bone
cells, and blood cells,

00:31:19.030 --> 00:31:22.000
and liver cells,
and brain cells,

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.140
and all the other kinds of
cells-- all eukaryotic cells.

00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:29.410
By being versatile
and by specializing,

00:31:29.410 --> 00:31:32.000
they could create this
division of labor,

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.720
which makes multi-cellular
life like you and me,

00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:41.170
and like every plant and every
animal on land or in sea,

00:31:41.170 --> 00:31:44.220
they're all eukaryotes.

00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:45.300
Here's one.

00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:46.500
Not a very fancy one.

00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:50.370
It's a caddis fly larva.

00:31:50.370 --> 00:31:51.780
Here's something that it builds.

00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:54.090
It's a food sieve.

00:31:54.090 --> 00:31:55.710
It lives in the water.

00:31:55.710 --> 00:32:02.060
It builds this amazing
structure in the flowing water.

00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:05.800
The water flows in, as
you can see in the funnel.

00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:08.710
The food gets
trapped on the sieve.

00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:09.820
The water escapes.

00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:13.270
And then the larva can
just scrape up the food

00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:15.010
off the sieve.

00:32:15.010 --> 00:32:17.049
This is quite an
ingenious artifact,

00:32:17.049 --> 00:32:18.340
I think, you'd have to believe.

00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:23.460
And it's made by such a simple
organism, a caddis larva.

00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:26.250
It bears a certain striking
resemblance to this food sieve.

00:32:29.670 --> 00:32:33.870
Some similar features,
some similar purposes.

00:32:33.870 --> 00:32:36.670
What's the difference
between them?

00:32:36.670 --> 00:32:39.430
The difference between them is
that although there are reasons

00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:42.320
for the arrangement of the
parts in the caddis larva's food

00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:46.600
sieve, and there are
also in the lobster trap,

00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:48.670
they're not
represented anywhere.

00:32:48.670 --> 00:32:54.820
They're not represented in the
caddis larva's nervous system.

00:32:54.820 --> 00:32:58.210
They're not represented
in natural selection.

00:32:58.210 --> 00:33:00.920
They're not represented at all.

00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:03.520
Whereas in the case
of the lobster trap,

00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:05.380
the reasons for the
parts are represented

00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:08.360
in the minds of the people
that make lobster traps,

00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:10.150
or the people who
order lobster traps,

00:33:10.150 --> 00:33:14.490
or the people who
design lobster traps.

00:33:14.490 --> 00:33:18.510
These reasons that we see in
the case of the caddis larva

00:33:18.510 --> 00:33:24.770
are what I call free-floating
rationales of evolution.

00:33:24.770 --> 00:33:29.440
They are the reasons why
structures in the biosphere

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:32.590
have the shapes and
parts that they do.

00:33:32.590 --> 00:33:34.930
But they're not reasons that
were represented anywhere

00:33:34.930 --> 00:33:38.620
until some clever
biologist figured them

00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:40.360
out and represented them.

00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:44.620
But that had nothing to do with
their coming into existence.

00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:49.160
One of my favorite examples
is the cuckoo chick.

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:53.760
Now cuckoos are brood parasites.

00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:57.090
Cuckoos do not make
their own nests.

00:33:57.090 --> 00:34:01.342
The cuckoo mother, when
she's ready to lay her egg,

00:34:01.342 --> 00:34:07.710
finds the nest of another
species that's just been built.

00:34:07.710 --> 00:34:09.440
The eggs have been laid.

00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:14.000
And she waits in hiding,
watching until the parents that

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.139
have built that nest and laid
those eggs fly away to feed.

00:34:18.139 --> 00:34:22.949
Then she swoops down,
lays her egg in the nest,

00:34:22.949 --> 00:34:26.739
rolls one of the host eggs out.

00:34:26.739 --> 00:34:28.937
That's just in case
the host can count.

00:34:33.159 --> 00:34:35.010
That's the reason.

00:34:35.010 --> 00:34:38.810
And goes away, flies
away, never to return.

00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:41.590
The hosts come back.

00:34:41.590 --> 00:34:43.650
Things look all right.

00:34:43.650 --> 00:34:45.909
They incubate the eggs.

00:34:45.909 --> 00:34:50.739
And the cuckoo egg incubates
faster than the others.

00:34:50.739 --> 00:34:52.840
So the cuckoo chick
is the first one out.

00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:55.780
And the first thing it
does is to try to roll

00:34:55.780 --> 00:35:00.070
the other eggs out of the nest.

00:35:00.070 --> 00:35:02.530
This is an artist's sketch.

00:35:02.530 --> 00:35:08.440
But I want to show you
a little film clip.

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:11.290
The cuckoo's egg looks
like the warbler's.

00:35:11.290 --> 00:35:13.125
And the number of
eggs hasn't changed.

00:35:21.630 --> 00:35:25.760
Everything appears normal, but
appearances can be deceiving.

00:35:34.130 --> 00:35:36.290
Something is not quite right.

00:35:43.790 --> 00:35:46.580
One chick has hatched
way before the others.

00:35:46.580 --> 00:35:48.840
And it is ejecting
the remaining eggs.

00:35:55.330 --> 00:35:59.390
I think you have to
agree there's plenty

00:35:59.390 --> 00:36:01.950
of sign of purpose there.

00:36:01.950 --> 00:36:06.480
The reason for this
behavior is all too clear.

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:09.740
But relax.

00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:12.680
The cuckoo chick doesn't
understand the reason.

00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:14.430
It doesn't have to
understand the reason.

00:36:14.430 --> 00:36:18.480
It knows not what it does.

00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:22.070
Natural selection
tracks that reason.

00:36:22.070 --> 00:36:25.500
And it creates things that have
purposes such as that purpose.

00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:31.760
But organisms themselves don't
need to know their purposes.

00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:34.290
The need to know principle
reigns in the biosphere

00:36:34.290 --> 00:36:36.602
just as it does at the CIA.

00:36:36.602 --> 00:36:37.560
But it has a different.

00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:40.410
Rationale in the
CIA, the reason why

00:36:40.410 --> 00:36:43.200
the need to know principle
is invoked-- only

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:46.950
give your agents the information
they absolutely need to know--

00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:51.090
is because then if they're
captured, and tortured,

00:36:51.090 --> 00:36:54.990
and spill the beans, they
don't have many beans to spill.

00:36:54.990 --> 00:36:57.600
That's one reason for the
need to know principle.

00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:02.330
Evolution's reason is
rather simpler-- thrift.

00:37:02.330 --> 00:37:05.450
If an organism doesn't need to
know the reason why it's doing

00:37:05.450 --> 00:37:09.019
something, don't provide it.

00:37:09.019 --> 00:37:10.310
The organism will do just fine.

00:37:10.310 --> 00:37:14.210
It will be the beneficiary
of that purpose

00:37:14.210 --> 00:37:18.450
without comprehending it at all.

00:37:18.450 --> 00:37:22.840
Now there's a common error when
people study-- and not just

00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:25.890
lay people, even scientists--
when they study animals

00:37:25.890 --> 00:37:28.020
that exhibit such purposes.

00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:31.140
What happens is we attribute
more understanding to the agent

00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:33.240
than need be.

00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:34.770
And the reason for
this, I submit,

00:37:34.770 --> 00:37:37.440
is because we lack
a familiar concept

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:39.740
of what we might
call semi-understood

00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:42.690
quasi-representations.

00:37:42.690 --> 00:37:44.850
There's no term for that.

00:37:44.850 --> 00:37:48.804
Or hemi-semi-demi-understood
pseudo-representations.

00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:54.060
There's just no everyday
words for these things.

00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:56.970
This is where Turing comes in.

00:37:56.970 --> 00:37:58.950
It is Turing's
strange inversion that

00:37:58.950 --> 00:38:02.850
gives us the vocabulary
and the concepts

00:38:02.850 --> 00:38:10.730
to think about such strange and
unnatural states of affairs.

00:38:10.730 --> 00:38:13.820
Computer programs that
don't really understand,

00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:15.710
but they sort of understand.

00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:17.780
And those aren't
really representations.

00:38:17.780 --> 00:38:19.860
They're only sort
of representations.

00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:24.290
But they get the job done.

00:38:24.290 --> 00:38:26.740
Now sometimes
birds can do things

00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:29.950
that are much more
dramatic and interesting.

00:38:29.950 --> 00:38:33.155
And I'm going to
show you an example.

00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:43.180
So this is a New
Caledonian crow.

00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:45.950
No sound on this.

00:38:45.950 --> 00:38:48.170
It's been given just
a piece of wire.

00:38:48.170 --> 00:38:51.030
And it's trying to get some
food out of this beaker.

00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:51.750
No success.

00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:13.870
Here's the tree of life.

00:39:13.870 --> 00:39:15.600
It doesn't look much
like a tree of life,

00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:17.940
because we're looking at
it from the bird's eye view

00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:20.310
actually-- from on top.

00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:22.590
And the root, you
can see at the center

00:39:22.590 --> 00:39:26.910
there where that Y is, that's
the last universal common

00:39:26.910 --> 00:39:30.520
ancestor of everything
alive on the planet today.

00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:32.200
And you see the
bacteria on the left

00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:34.270
and the archaea up
on the upper right.

00:39:34.270 --> 00:39:36.640
And down on the bottom
here, we see the eukarya,

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:38.800
the eukaryotic cells.

00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:42.880
And it's been drawn
so that out at the end

00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:44.620
of the eukaryotic
branch, there's

00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:51.100
three closely-related
genera-- [INAUDIBLE],

00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:52.870
homo, and [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:54.370
Homo, of course, is us.

00:39:54.370 --> 00:39:58.160
The other two are close
relatives, relatively speaking,

00:39:58.160 --> 00:39:58.930
of us.

00:39:58.930 --> 00:40:01.895
That's mushrooms, us, and corn.

00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:06.520
Yes.

00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:09.010
You are closely related to corn.

00:40:09.010 --> 00:40:10.740
You are closely
related to mushrooms.

00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:16.430
You have more genes in
common with each of them

00:40:16.430 --> 00:40:19.475
than you do with the other
branches on the tree of life.

00:40:22.410 --> 00:40:24.030
All of that tree of
life-- oh, here's

00:40:24.030 --> 00:40:26.900
another, better, more recent
picture of the eukaryotes.

00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:28.940
I won't bother explaining that.

00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:29.780
Time is short.

00:40:33.470 --> 00:40:36.310
All of that has to happen about
three and a half billion years.

00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:44.650
We split off from our common
ancestor with the chimpanzee

00:40:44.650 --> 00:40:47.470
roughly six million years ago.

00:40:47.470 --> 00:40:49.540
And it is just as
wrong to say that we

00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:53.380
evolved from chimpanzees as to
say that chimpanzees evolved

00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:55.810
from us.

00:40:55.810 --> 00:40:58.780
We both evolved from
a common ancestor.

00:40:58.780 --> 00:41:02.710
Chimpanzees have been evolving
away from that common ancestor

00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:06.200
just as long as we have.

00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:09.830
But probably that ancestor was
a lot more, in most regards,

00:41:09.830 --> 00:41:13.100
like a chimpanzee
than it is like us.

00:41:13.100 --> 00:41:15.140
But in any case, the
differences between us

00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:18.930
and the chimpanzee
all have to have

00:41:18.930 --> 00:41:21.770
been accumulated
by R&amp;D that occurs

00:41:21.770 --> 00:41:23.690
in the last six million years.

00:41:28.510 --> 00:41:32.050
But now I want to
leap ahead, ignoring

00:41:32.050 --> 00:41:35.980
all the interesting complexities
about hominid evolution,

00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:40.540
and go to the
recent, recent past

00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:42.490
when Homo sapiens,
when our species,

00:41:42.490 --> 00:41:46.180
was already well-established
around the time

00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:50.120
of the dawn of agriculture.

00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:54.330
Paul MacCready the
visionary engineer,

00:41:54.330 --> 00:41:58.020
the creator of the
Gossamer Albatross,

00:41:58.020 --> 00:42:01.290
calculated a few years
ago that at that time--

00:42:01.290 --> 00:42:06.670
shortly after the dawn of
agriculture-- human beings

00:42:06.670 --> 00:42:11.320
plus all their livestock
and all their pets

00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:18.110
was just a fraction of 1% of the
terrestrial vertebrate biomass.

00:42:18.110 --> 00:42:19.850
That is to say that
doesn't include

00:42:19.850 --> 00:42:21.880
the insects or the worms.

00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:24.800
It doesn't include
the fish in the sea.

00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:27.860
This is the terrestrial
vertebrate biomass,

00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:31.900
roughly what everyday
folks call animals.

00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:36.160
So us plus all our
animals was less

00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:42.462
than a fraction of 1%
just 10,000 years ago.

00:42:42.462 --> 00:42:43.795
What do you suppose it is today?

00:42:46.620 --> 00:42:48.810
Quite a bit more.

00:42:48.810 --> 00:42:50.010
What do you think, 20%?

00:42:50.010 --> 00:42:52.445
30%?

00:42:52.445 --> 00:42:52.945
50%?

00:42:55.490 --> 00:42:58.110
How could it be 50%?

00:42:58.110 --> 00:42:59.963
MacCready calculates
that it's 98%.

00:43:03.330 --> 00:43:04.455
Now most of that's cattle.

00:43:07.450 --> 00:43:11.920
We plus our domesticated
animals have swamped

00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:15.310
the world in just 10,000 years.

00:43:19.150 --> 00:43:22.990
Here's what MacCready
has to say about it.

00:43:22.990 --> 00:43:25.090
"Over billions of years
on a unique sphere,

00:43:25.090 --> 00:43:27.520
chance has painted a
thin covering of life--

00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:31.240
complex, improbable,
wonderful, and fragile.

00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:34.660
Suddenly, we humans--"
forget the parentheses.

00:43:34.660 --> 00:43:36.550
It's false.

00:43:36.550 --> 00:43:38.920
"--have grown in
population, technology,

00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:42.010
and intelligence to a
position of terrible power.

00:43:42.010 --> 00:43:46.370
We now wield the paintbrush."

00:43:46.370 --> 00:43:47.900
All of this in 10,000 years.

00:43:51.010 --> 00:43:54.820
As he says, it's the
technology and intelligence

00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:58.250
that permit us to do this.

00:43:58.250 --> 00:44:01.010
Compare the Cambrian
Explosion, which

00:44:01.010 --> 00:44:03.530
was another great event
in the history of life.

00:44:03.530 --> 00:44:05.910
It occurred over
millions of years

00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:09.330
and it occurred about
530 million years ago.

00:44:09.330 --> 00:44:14.100
That's when so many new
body plans evolved over

00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:16.730
a relatively very
short period of time,

00:44:16.730 --> 00:44:21.270
and created so much of the
diversity of life forms.

00:44:21.270 --> 00:44:23.540
This has been famous
by Steve Gould

00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:26.390
in his book, Wonderful Life.

00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:29.330
And that was, indeed, one of
the great explosive creative

00:44:29.330 --> 00:44:32.040
periods in evolution.

00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:35.040
But compare that with the
MacCready explosion, which

00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:36.930
occurred over 10,000 years.

00:44:36.930 --> 00:44:41.380
That's only about 500
human generations.

00:44:41.380 --> 00:44:44.900
It's a remarkably
swift biological change

00:44:44.900 --> 00:44:46.460
to the planet.

00:44:46.460 --> 00:44:49.550
And we're right at
the center of it.

00:44:49.550 --> 00:44:51.680
It's not just genes.

00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:53.510
There's a second
information highway

00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:57.080
from parents to offspring
that we, and really we alone,

00:44:57.080 --> 00:44:59.580
have optimized.

00:44:59.580 --> 00:45:01.710
Richardson and Boyd, in
their wonderful book,

00:45:01.710 --> 00:45:04.740
Not by Genes Alone,
examine the conditions

00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:07.320
under which this could happen.

00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:12.870
And they point out that culture
is transmitted more generally

00:45:12.870 --> 00:45:14.730
than genes.

00:45:14.730 --> 00:45:16.920
You get your genes
from your parents.

00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:19.560
That is vertical transmission.

00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:23.460
But once this second highway
from parents to offspring

00:45:23.460 --> 00:45:26.670
is established, you
can then get what

00:45:26.670 --> 00:45:29.370
they call oblique
transmission, or even

00:45:29.370 --> 00:45:30.960
horizontal
transmission, where you

00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:35.460
get a lot of this information
not from your parents

00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:39.300
but from your peers, from other
people, people not related

00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:41.460
to you at all.

00:45:41.460 --> 00:45:45.480
Once this information highway
is established between parent

00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:48.990
and offspring, it can be
co-opted and exploited

00:45:48.990 --> 00:45:52.770
by all of these other
elements, which they

00:45:52.770 --> 00:45:57.440
call rogue cultural variants.

00:45:57.440 --> 00:46:00.100
To get the idea, you might want
to think about the internet

00:46:00.100 --> 00:46:02.160
and spam.

00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:06.260
The internet wasn't created
to make spam possible.

00:46:06.260 --> 00:46:10.980
It wasn't created to make
pornography possible.

00:46:10.980 --> 00:46:14.390
But once it exists
and is in good shape,

00:46:14.390 --> 00:46:16.760
all kinds of rogue
cultural variants

00:46:16.760 --> 00:46:22.520
begin to take advantage
of it, as we all know.

00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:25.160
Those rogue cultural variants
are what Richard Dawkins

00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:29.360
calls memes--
cultural items that

00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:34.460
replicate and spread
through human populations

00:46:34.460 --> 00:46:35.554
thanks to their culture.

00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:41.240
Memes, says Dawkins,
are analogous to genes.

00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:43.550
They're information structures.

00:46:43.550 --> 00:46:45.590
They bear information.

00:46:45.590 --> 00:46:49.340
He also points out that
they're analogous to viruses.

00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:51.110
And what is a virus, actually?

00:46:51.110 --> 00:46:53.550
It is really a
sort of naked gene.

00:46:53.550 --> 00:46:58.400
It's just sort of
all gene and no body.

00:46:58.400 --> 00:47:01.640
Or as I like to say,
a virus is a string

00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:03.782
of nucleic acid with attitude.

00:47:06.130 --> 00:47:10.200
It doesn't have a mind.

00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:13.410
It is absolutely ignorant.

00:47:13.410 --> 00:47:17.190
But it does have the amazing
competence, the competence

00:47:17.190 --> 00:47:21.860
of being able to insert
itself because of its shape

00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:25.860
into a cell that does
have copy machinery there.

00:47:25.860 --> 00:47:27.960
And to commandeer
that copy machinery

00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:30.900
and get it to make
copies of itself, rather

00:47:30.900 --> 00:47:34.520
than of the cell's own DNA.

00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:37.160
That's how viruses replicate.

00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:42.370
And of course, natural
selection operates over them

00:47:42.370 --> 00:47:44.310
very effectively.

00:47:44.310 --> 00:47:50.310
To take a well-known
example, HIV, a virus,

00:47:50.310 --> 00:47:54.990
a non-living replicator,
has evolved more just

00:47:54.990 --> 00:47:58.440
in terms of codon change
since it was first

00:47:58.440 --> 00:48:04.490
sequenced not so many years
ago than we have evolved

00:48:04.490 --> 00:48:07.370
from our common ancestor
with the chimpanzee

00:48:07.370 --> 00:48:09.460
six million years ago.

00:48:09.460 --> 00:48:10.237
It's very fast.

00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:17.270
A meme is a data structure made
of information with attitude.

00:48:17.270 --> 00:48:20.880
It's the same sort
of thing as a virus.

00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:24.570
But it doesn't insert itself
into an individual cell

00:48:24.570 --> 00:48:28.350
and get the cell's Cells
copy machinery to work.

00:48:28.350 --> 00:48:32.430
It inserts itself into an
individual head, into a brain,

00:48:32.430 --> 00:48:34.800
and gets the brain
to make the copies.

00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:37.200
And then to spit them
out, to transmit them,

00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:41.600
to broadcast them, the
way I'm doing right now.

00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:46.370
I am spraying you with
memes, some of which

00:48:46.370 --> 00:48:50.750
are no doubt going to enter not
only your ears, but your minds.

00:48:50.750 --> 00:48:53.630
And there they will
proliferate and replicate.

00:48:53.630 --> 00:48:56.090
And then you'll spread
them to somebody else.

00:48:56.090 --> 00:48:58.370
And it will be viral.

00:48:58.370 --> 00:48:59.140
You get the idea.

00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:03.560
Let's put in a little
skeptical interlude.

00:49:03.560 --> 00:49:07.010
What evidence is there
that memes even exist Well

00:49:07.010 --> 00:49:09.830
if you believe that
words exist, then you

00:49:09.830 --> 00:49:12.440
believe that memes
exist, because words are

00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:14.600
memes that can be pronounced.

00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:16.100
There are other
memes that can't be.

00:49:16.100 --> 00:49:20.632
But words-- how many of
you believe in words?

00:49:20.632 --> 00:49:23.540
All right, they're memes
that can be pronounced.

00:49:23.540 --> 00:49:26.060
If you doubt the
existence of words,

00:49:26.060 --> 00:49:30.005
then you can doubt the
existence of memes.

00:49:30.005 --> 00:49:32.005
In other words, we're
apes with infected brains.

00:49:35.940 --> 00:49:38.880
Or you might say
we are euprimates,

00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:41.700
like those eukaryotic cells.

00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:44.970
Our brains are invaded by
virtual machines designed

00:49:44.970 --> 00:49:46.680
by natural selection.

00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:48.480
And these virtual
machines give us

00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:50.940
powers, which give
us the versatility

00:49:50.940 --> 00:49:53.880
to take organization up a level.

00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:56.760
Remember that original
endosymbiotic origin

00:49:56.760 --> 00:49:58.350
of eukaryotes?

00:49:58.350 --> 00:50:04.080
Where B got a billion years of
R&amp;D for free by just joining

00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:09.660
forces, by just taking that
other prokaryote in and not

00:50:09.660 --> 00:50:11.760
eating it, not taking
it apart, because that

00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:13.530
would have lost all
the information--

00:50:13.530 --> 00:50:15.730
or most of the information.

00:50:15.730 --> 00:50:19.137
Similarly, when you take in
memes, you don't eat them.

00:50:19.137 --> 00:50:20.220
You don't take them apart.

00:50:20.220 --> 00:50:21.930
You leave their
structure intact,

00:50:21.930 --> 00:50:26.490
because that's the product
of many years of design.

00:50:26.490 --> 00:50:30.700
None of you had to invent
the wheel, or long division,

00:50:30.700 --> 00:50:37.180
or statistics, or finding
averages, or reading maps.

00:50:37.180 --> 00:50:41.422
All of these wonderful
tools are culture-born.

00:50:41.422 --> 00:50:42.880
And you just help
yourself to them,

00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:45.420
and you pack them
into your head.

00:50:45.420 --> 00:50:47.380
Our power depends
on the culture that

00:50:47.380 --> 00:50:51.850
permits us to divide labor and
share expertise so that we can

00:50:51.850 --> 00:50:56.350
create organizations like
universities, like churches,

00:50:56.350 --> 00:51:00.230
like armies, like clubs,
like institutions,

00:51:00.230 --> 00:51:02.110
which depend on a
division of labor

00:51:02.110 --> 00:51:05.880
and depend on our complexity.

00:51:05.880 --> 00:51:07.770
From this perspective,
we're able to see

00:51:07.770 --> 00:51:09.750
that among the fruits
on the tree of life

00:51:09.750 --> 00:51:14.430
are both spiderwebs and
power grids, both beaver

00:51:14.430 --> 00:51:20.370
dams and the Hoover Dam, both
the bird's nest and the ode

00:51:20.370 --> 00:51:22.290
to a nightingale.

00:51:22.290 --> 00:51:26.250
These are all artifacts
made by organisms.

00:51:26.250 --> 00:51:29.866
And in the case of
the human organisms,

00:51:29.866 --> 00:51:31.240
these are artifacts
that are made

00:51:31.240 --> 00:51:35.080
possible by the
establishment in those brains

00:51:35.080 --> 00:51:39.850
of evolved virtual
machines-- memes-- that

00:51:39.850 --> 00:51:42.850
give them their powers.

00:51:42.850 --> 00:51:45.640
So now I want to approach
the delicate transition

00:51:45.640 --> 00:51:50.170
from bottom-up Darwinian R&amp;D to
top-down creative genius R&amp;D,

00:51:50.170 --> 00:51:55.270
because after all, we do have
this clear image that sometimes

00:51:55.270 --> 00:51:57.250
people are really geniuses.

00:51:57.250 --> 00:51:58.750
And they're really creative.

00:51:58.750 --> 00:52:01.510
They are intelligent designers.

00:52:01.510 --> 00:52:04.570
Well as Bo Dahlbom once said,
"You can't do much carpentry

00:52:04.570 --> 00:52:06.910
with your bare hands, and
you can't do much thinking

00:52:06.910 --> 00:52:09.492
with your bare brain."

00:52:11.174 --> 00:52:13.340
If you're going to do some
really creative thinking,

00:52:13.340 --> 00:52:16.051
you need lots of thinking tools.

00:52:16.051 --> 00:52:18.050
Fortunately, there's a
lot of them lying around.

00:52:18.050 --> 00:52:21.060
Those are those memes that
I was telling you about.

00:52:21.060 --> 00:52:23.480
And so you take them in,
and you make them your own,

00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:24.980
and you learn to use them.

00:52:24.980 --> 00:52:28.880
And that equips your mind with
all sorts of prosthetic devices

00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:33.650
that you can then
use to create things.

00:52:33.650 --> 00:52:37.550
So what I'm suggesting is
that words are sort of tools.

00:52:37.550 --> 00:52:40.250
They're not always elements
in grammatical constructions.

00:52:40.250 --> 00:52:43.550
For instance,
passwords and labels

00:52:43.550 --> 00:52:46.730
are individual words
that have very nice uses

00:52:46.730 --> 00:52:50.720
quite independently of any
grammar, of any syntax.

00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:53.750
Interestingly enough,
both passwords and labels

00:52:53.750 --> 00:52:56.630
are echoes of designs
that evolution

00:52:56.630 --> 00:53:00.310
has found much earlier in
the animal world, as well.

00:53:00.310 --> 00:53:02.690
We've sort of
rediscovered tricks

00:53:02.690 --> 00:53:06.960
that evolution
discovered long ago.

00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:10.320
My dear friend and sometimes
co-author, Doug Hofstadter,

00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:16.410
in his 2006 book, I
am a Strange Loop,

00:53:16.410 --> 00:53:19.050
gives us a list, a toolkit.

00:53:19.050 --> 00:53:23.040
And it includes a wonderful
list of tools in his kit.

00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:24.290
And they're in your kit too.

00:53:24.290 --> 00:53:25.200
Here they are.

00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:33.100
Wild goose chases, tackiness,
dirty tricks, sour grapes,

00:53:33.100 --> 00:53:40.330
elbow grease, feet of clay,
loose cannons, crackpots,

00:53:40.330 --> 00:53:46.750
lip service, slam
dunks, feedback.

00:53:46.750 --> 00:53:51.600
Each of these is
a thinking tool.

00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:55.240
If you've got it, if
it's part of your kit,

00:53:55.240 --> 00:54:00.010
you can think more effectively,
more efficiently, more swiftly.

00:54:00.010 --> 00:54:01.510
You can categorize things.

00:54:01.510 --> 00:54:03.490
You can find similarities.

00:54:03.490 --> 00:54:06.250
You can reason about
similarities better

00:54:06.250 --> 00:54:10.090
with these tools than
you could otherwise.

00:54:10.090 --> 00:54:13.989
These are tools that are
made of not steel, and wood,

00:54:13.989 --> 00:54:14.530
and so forth.

00:54:14.530 --> 00:54:15.613
They're made of technique.

00:54:15.613 --> 00:54:16.870
They're made of information.

00:54:16.870 --> 00:54:18.610
They're recipes for action.

00:54:18.610 --> 00:54:20.530
And some of them
are obviously that,

00:54:20.530 --> 00:54:22.810
like long division
is a nice tool.

00:54:22.810 --> 00:54:24.940
Statistics is a nice tool.

00:54:24.940 --> 00:54:27.760
They're rather like
Java applets if you're

00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:30.440
into thinking about
these in computer terms.

00:54:30.440 --> 00:54:32.920
They're informational
structures that

00:54:32.920 --> 00:54:38.980
enhance the powers
of the Turing machine

00:54:38.980 --> 00:54:42.340
that you have between your ears.

00:54:42.340 --> 00:54:44.334
What are Java applets made of?

00:54:44.334 --> 00:54:45.500
They're made of information.

00:54:45.500 --> 00:54:47.830
Well they're made of bits.

00:54:47.830 --> 00:54:51.170
But they have no material
basis other than that.

00:54:51.170 --> 00:54:53.720
And much is the same of words.

00:54:53.720 --> 00:54:55.120
What's long division made of?

00:54:59.430 --> 00:55:00.340
It's an algorithm.

00:55:00.340 --> 00:55:03.480
It's made of just information.

00:55:03.480 --> 00:55:06.040
It's a recipe for
doing something.

00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:08.230
What's cost benefit
analysis made of?

00:55:08.230 --> 00:55:13.640
These are excellent tools that
are not made of any material.

00:55:13.640 --> 00:55:15.680
They're made of information.

00:55:15.680 --> 00:55:19.550
They are, as we say,
virtual machines.

00:55:19.550 --> 00:55:22.530
And this is the technology
that has remade the brain,

00:55:22.530 --> 00:55:26.060
and basically that
makes the human minds.

00:55:26.060 --> 00:55:29.720
Now who designs all these
treasures that we share?

00:55:29.720 --> 00:55:36.020
Well there are heroes of design
that can be assigned authorship

00:55:36.020 --> 00:55:37.910
for some of those treasures.

00:55:37.910 --> 00:55:40.430
People like Pythagoras,
and Plato, and Descartes,

00:55:40.430 --> 00:55:43.220
and Newton, and Shakespeare,
and Austen, and Curie,

00:55:43.220 --> 00:55:44.390
and many others.

00:55:44.390 --> 00:55:46.220
But in general, no.

00:55:46.220 --> 00:55:48.710
Most of the treasures that you
have stored up in your head

00:55:48.710 --> 00:55:50.570
have no authors at all.

00:55:50.570 --> 00:55:52.160
Nobody designed language.

00:55:52.160 --> 00:55:55.440
Nobody designed tonal music.

00:55:55.440 --> 00:55:56.745
But then what are you?

00:55:56.745 --> 00:55:58.590
What am I?

00:55:58.590 --> 00:56:00.044
Who uses these tools?

00:56:02.700 --> 00:56:05.250
Is there a Cartesian
ego in there that

00:56:05.250 --> 00:56:07.830
equips itself with the tools?

00:56:07.830 --> 00:56:10.200
No.

00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:13.870
That is not what is in there.

00:56:13.870 --> 00:56:17.230
What is in there
is just an alliance

00:56:17.230 --> 00:56:20.410
of hemi-semi-demi-understood
quasi-representations.

00:56:20.410 --> 00:56:23.740
Just a whole bunch
of memes in there,

00:56:23.740 --> 00:56:28.090
forming a superstructure, which
then has the interesting role

00:56:28.090 --> 00:56:30.940
of being a virtual machine
made of smaller, simpler

00:56:30.940 --> 00:56:32.350
virtual machines.

00:56:32.350 --> 00:56:34.780
And it guards the
entrance and evaluates yet

00:56:34.780 --> 00:56:35.936
other virtual machines.

00:56:40.200 --> 00:56:43.270
This still looks
ominous to most people.

00:56:43.270 --> 00:56:50.760
But I want to try to take away
the bad aroma of this idea

00:56:50.760 --> 00:56:52.620
by pointing to
something that Darwin

00:56:52.620 --> 00:56:55.260
did in the Origin of Species.

00:56:55.260 --> 00:56:58.620
He began that book by looking
at methodical selection.

00:56:58.620 --> 00:57:02.040
That is, where plant and
animal breeders set out

00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:03.990
with foresight,
and deliberately,

00:57:03.990 --> 00:57:06.720
and with intention,
with consciousness

00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:10.290
to try to improve the
breed, to make a faster race

00:57:10.290 --> 00:57:15.760
horse, a smarter dog, a more
beautiful pigeon, and so forth.

00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:17.490
And then he pointed
out that that works.

00:57:17.490 --> 00:57:22.350
But also so does what he
calls unconscious selection.

00:57:22.350 --> 00:57:26.180
This is where people,
without intending a thing,

00:57:26.180 --> 00:57:28.610
without meaning a thing,
without knowing what they're

00:57:28.610 --> 00:57:31.730
doing inadvertently,
their actions

00:57:31.730 --> 00:57:36.980
tend to bias the survival
of their domesticated plants

00:57:36.980 --> 00:57:38.000
and animals.

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:41.540
And this leads to
accumulated change

00:57:41.540 --> 00:57:44.300
in those domesticated species.

00:57:44.300 --> 00:57:47.690
This is still going on today.

00:57:47.690 --> 00:57:50.930
And then he uses that as a
segue into natural selection.

00:57:50.930 --> 00:57:55.070
So we start with an
attempted intelligent design.

00:57:55.070 --> 00:57:57.380
And then we get design which
isn't really intelligent.

00:57:57.380 --> 00:57:58.670
It's just unconscious.

00:57:58.670 --> 00:58:00.230
And then we get
natural selection

00:58:00.230 --> 00:58:02.780
where there's no
mind involved at all,

00:58:02.780 --> 00:58:06.480
just the vicissitudes of nature.

00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:09.930
Now more recently, of course,
we've added one at the top.

00:58:09.930 --> 00:58:12.140
We've added genetic
engineering, which

00:58:12.140 --> 00:58:14.780
is like methodical selection,
only more efficient,

00:58:14.780 --> 00:58:19.280
in that we don't wait for nature
to generate the genomes that we

00:58:19.280 --> 00:58:21.500
then put to the test.

00:58:21.500 --> 00:58:26.490
Now we can do the
same thing with memes.

00:58:26.490 --> 00:58:29.200
Working backwards, let's
start at the bottom,

00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:33.300
working in the other direction
from the previous slide.

00:58:33.300 --> 00:58:35.940
First we have what we might
call the natural selection

00:58:35.940 --> 00:58:38.210
of synanthropic memes.

00:58:38.210 --> 00:58:43.290
Synanthropic memes are the rats,
and bedbugs, and squirrels,

00:58:43.290 --> 00:58:46.230
and pigeons of the meme world.

00:58:46.230 --> 00:58:47.700
They're not domesticated.

00:58:47.700 --> 00:58:48.630
We don't own them.

00:58:48.630 --> 00:58:51.610
We don't love them.

00:58:51.610 --> 00:58:53.660
They're well-designed
by natural selection

00:58:53.660 --> 00:58:59.360
to live in our company and to
exploit us in various ways.

00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:01.590
But pretty soon, we get
unconscious selection

00:59:01.590 --> 00:59:04.790
where we have, for
instance, tunes

00:59:04.790 --> 00:59:08.010
that replicate and only
the most memorable,

00:59:08.010 --> 00:59:11.070
the most unforgettable,
the most lilting tunes

00:59:11.070 --> 00:59:12.690
survive and make copies.

00:59:12.690 --> 00:59:14.980
And the rest go extinct.

00:59:14.980 --> 00:59:16.640
And you get what
the Germans call

00:59:16.640 --> 00:59:22.290
earworms, those terrible
tunes that you can't get out

00:59:22.290 --> 00:59:24.240
of your head.

00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:26.610
You don't like it.

00:59:26.610 --> 00:59:29.310
You don't want to own it.

00:59:29.310 --> 00:59:31.870
You're just stuck with it.

00:59:31.870 --> 00:59:34.350
And now you're going to pass
it to your neighbor, who's

00:59:34.350 --> 00:59:35.765
going to hate you for it.

00:59:38.730 --> 00:59:42.300
But there are memes that
we love, that we honor,

00:59:42.300 --> 00:59:43.080
that we respect.

00:59:43.080 --> 00:59:46.920
And we go way out of
our way to make sure

00:59:46.920 --> 00:59:50.165
that they replicate in our
children, in our friends,

00:59:50.165 --> 00:59:52.050
in our young.

00:59:52.050 --> 00:59:53.850
And like other
domesticated species--

00:59:53.850 --> 00:59:57.240
like laying hens for instance,
which would probably go extinct

00:59:57.240 --> 00:59:58.980
if they were left on
their own in nature,

00:59:58.980 --> 01:00:02.100
because their capacity to
reproduce and to incubate

01:00:02.100 --> 01:00:05.970
their eggs has been pretty
well bred out of them.

01:00:05.970 --> 01:00:12.670
So people have to work hard
to get hens to reproduce.

01:00:12.670 --> 01:00:17.230
And similarly, I'll give
you an example-- calculus.

01:00:17.230 --> 01:00:24.380
Or maybe here at UA, people find
this just the most wonderful,

01:00:24.380 --> 01:00:25.550
infectious idea.

01:00:25.550 --> 01:00:27.770
You just can't get
it out of your head.

01:00:27.770 --> 01:00:30.440
So catchy, calculus.

01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:31.250
So infectious.

01:00:31.250 --> 01:00:35.030
Just can't get those
derivatives out of my head.

01:00:35.030 --> 01:00:37.700
I doubt it.

01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:43.700
No these memes have to be very
deliberately and laboriously

01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:48.529
replicated generation
after generation.

01:00:48.529 --> 01:00:50.820
And then, of course, we have
memetic engineering, which

01:00:50.820 --> 01:00:54.780
is what people in advertising
do, and spin doctors,

01:00:54.780 --> 01:00:59.040
and other people who try
to do intelligent design

01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:02.370
of cultural items
that will then fly,

01:01:02.370 --> 01:01:04.410
that will become
viral, that will

01:01:04.410 --> 01:01:06.130
pass from person to person.

01:01:08.660 --> 01:01:10.750
What this all permits us
to do is a certain sort

01:01:10.750 --> 01:01:12.430
of bootstrapping.

01:01:12.430 --> 01:01:14.770
It's worked in the past
and it'll work again.

01:01:14.770 --> 01:01:17.780
I'm going to give you one
example of bootstrapping,

01:01:17.780 --> 01:01:20.920
which should stand for
thousands actually.

01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:23.150
How do you draw a straight line?

01:01:23.150 --> 01:01:24.250
Think about it.

01:01:24.250 --> 01:01:25.150
It's easy.

01:01:25.150 --> 01:01:28.807
Get a piece of paper, and a
pencil, and a straight edge.

01:01:28.807 --> 01:01:30.640
And put the straight
edge down on the paper.

01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:32.825
You draw the line.

01:01:32.825 --> 01:01:33.700
That's how you do it.

01:01:33.700 --> 01:01:35.370
It's easy.

01:01:35.370 --> 01:01:36.310
Use a straight edge.

01:01:36.310 --> 01:01:38.662
Where'd you get
the straight edge?

01:01:38.662 --> 01:01:41.150
Oh, you got the straight
edge from a straight edge

01:01:41.150 --> 01:01:43.250
manufacturer.

01:01:43.250 --> 01:01:44.800
How do you make
the straight edge?

01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:47.900
Well you see, he had
this straight edge.

01:01:47.900 --> 01:01:51.946
And he put a piece
of metal down.

01:01:51.946 --> 01:01:53.570
And where did he get
his straight edge?

01:01:53.570 --> 01:01:58.250
Well from a super straight edge
manufacturer, and so forth.

01:01:58.250 --> 01:02:00.080
But that's not an
infinite regress.

01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:02.180
It's a finite regress.

01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:05.520
And it turns out to be a
fairly interesting one.

01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:07.220
This is from a 1970 book.

01:02:07.220 --> 01:02:13.180
And it shows a circa 1960
high quality straight edge,

01:02:13.180 --> 01:02:15.950
about as good as you
could make at that time.

01:02:15.950 --> 01:02:18.920
The history of the
evolution of straight edges

01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:20.940
is really quite an
interesting phenomenon.

01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:22.190
They got better and better.

01:02:22.190 --> 01:02:26.030
And one of the key elements
in their getting better

01:02:26.030 --> 01:02:29.300
is that they began to
use their other memes

01:02:29.300 --> 01:02:32.600
to represent the
goal of making better

01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:33.950
and better straight edges.

01:02:33.950 --> 01:02:36.650
Here is a wonderful
diagram from that book.

01:02:36.650 --> 01:02:40.050
That wiggly line
that you see there

01:02:40.050 --> 01:02:43.140
is a representation
of a straight edge,

01:02:43.140 --> 01:02:45.780
as good a straight edge as
they could make in 1960.

01:02:45.780 --> 01:02:47.100
It's a gauge block.

01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:49.410
And it shows the
imperfections in that surface

01:02:49.410 --> 01:02:50.885
magnified a million fold.

01:02:53.580 --> 01:02:58.350
Once you've got the capacity
to represent your reasons

01:02:58.350 --> 01:03:03.550
for making things, unlike
the caddis fly larva,

01:03:03.550 --> 01:03:05.890
once you can
represent the reasons

01:03:05.890 --> 01:03:09.160
and then represent the falling
short of the perfections

01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:14.920
that you can define, you're
on an accelerated path

01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:16.870
to competence.

01:03:16.870 --> 01:03:18.910
The ideal of a perfectly
straight line--

01:03:18.910 --> 01:03:21.520
or as Plato might say,
the form of the straight--

01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:24.940
was arrived at by approximation,
both of the artifacts

01:03:24.940 --> 01:03:27.940
and of the idea itself.

01:03:27.940 --> 01:03:30.820
The form of the good
has a similar history.

01:03:30.820 --> 01:03:33.520
And for that matter,
the form of the true.

01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:36.790
What makes us human
then is not so much

01:03:36.790 --> 01:03:41.890
our genetic children
as our brain children.

01:03:41.890 --> 01:03:46.120
We alone represent our reasons.

01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:50.320
We can think about our
values, our reasons.

01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:55.130
And that is the source
of our creativity.

01:03:55.130 --> 01:04:00.720
We, the reason representers,
now can look back

01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:03.570
and discover the
reasons everywhere

01:04:03.570 --> 01:04:06.420
in the tree of life, the
unrepresented reasons for all

01:04:06.420 --> 01:04:11.750
of the parts in the tree of
life before here, before us.

01:04:11.750 --> 01:04:16.100
It took Darwin to discover
that a mindless process created

01:04:16.100 --> 01:04:18.260
all those reasons.

01:04:18.260 --> 01:04:20.810
We intelligent
designers then are

01:04:20.810 --> 01:04:24.680
among the effects, the
very recent effects--

01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:27.500
not the cause-- of
all those purposes.

01:04:30.830 --> 01:04:35.960
Some of you may notice I have a
little Darwin fish, an evolving

01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:37.830
fish.

01:04:37.830 --> 01:04:42.410
I had this pin on several
years ago at a conference.

01:04:42.410 --> 01:04:44.910
And the physicist, Murray
Gell-Mann was there.

01:04:44.910 --> 01:04:47.390
And he's a very
learned gentleman.

01:04:47.390 --> 01:04:49.040
And he said, Dan,
I like your pin.

01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:53.130
He said, do you know
that the Christian fish

01:04:53.130 --> 01:04:58.450
symbol was the first acronym?

01:04:58.450 --> 01:04:59.334
Ichthus.

01:04:59.334 --> 01:05:01.000
That's what you see
there in the middle,

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:04.720
ichthus is the
Greek word for fish.

01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:08.630
And it stood for
[SPEAKING GREEK].

01:05:11.350 --> 01:05:14.080
Jesus Christ, God,
Son, and Savior.

01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:16.660
That's why they use the fish.

01:05:16.660 --> 01:05:20.220
I said, that's very nice,
Murray, really interesting.

01:05:20.220 --> 01:05:22.740
He said, what I want
to know, Dan, is,

01:05:22.740 --> 01:05:25.150
what does D-A-R-W-I-N stand for?

01:05:29.340 --> 01:05:32.670
I thought, that's a
very good question.

01:05:32.670 --> 01:05:35.250
Well I'm not really
a classical scholar.

01:05:35.250 --> 01:05:37.357
But I did take Latin in
high school for a while.

01:05:37.357 --> 01:05:38.940
I thought, let me
work on that and see

01:05:38.940 --> 01:05:40.470
what I can come up with.

01:05:40.470 --> 01:05:43.980
So I went off and had a cup of
coffee, and got out my pencil

01:05:43.980 --> 01:05:45.300
and worked at it for a while.

01:05:45.300 --> 01:05:48.060
And I came up with something
which seems to fit pretty well.

01:05:48.060 --> 01:05:48.780
So here we go.

01:05:48.780 --> 01:05:53.940
Here's D-A-R-W-I-N. There's no
W in Latin so you have to use

01:05:53.940 --> 01:05:58.340
double U. OK?

01:05:58.340 --> 01:06:05.376
Delere auctorem rerum ut
universum infinitum noscas.

01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:17.320
Destroy or delete the
author of things in order

01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:19.510
to understand the
infinite universe.

01:06:21.975 --> 01:06:23.454
Thank you for your attention.

01:06:54.080 --> 01:07:00.360
Dr. Dennett will be happy
to answer your questions.

01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:01.380
If we can see anybody.

01:07:01.380 --> 01:07:03.770
If we can see anyone, yes.

01:07:03.770 --> 01:07:04.860
May we have the lights up?

01:07:04.860 --> 01:07:06.050
There we go.

01:07:06.050 --> 01:07:06.920
Right here.

01:07:15.420 --> 01:07:18.030
I know you've had a number
of constructive debates

01:07:18.030 --> 01:07:20.730
with Dreyfus, Hubert Dreyfus.

01:07:20.730 --> 01:07:25.260
Do you consider him a skyhook
proponent or something else?

01:07:25.260 --> 01:07:28.300
I'm sort of curious where
he would stand in there.

01:07:28.300 --> 01:07:29.570
Thank you.

01:07:29.570 --> 01:07:30.390
Yeah.

01:07:30.390 --> 01:07:34.680
Hubert Dreyfus at Berkeley,
a phenomenologist,

01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:37.290
good philosopher,
longtime critic

01:07:37.290 --> 01:07:39.480
of artificial intelligence.

01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:41.400
Yes, I would call him
a mind creationist,

01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:45.000
because he has supposed
that it was in principle

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:50.250
impossible to build up
from the Turing base

01:07:50.250 --> 01:07:54.030
to a mind with creativity
and intelligence.

01:07:54.030 --> 01:07:57.240
He thinks that the sort of
insight that human minds have

01:07:57.240 --> 01:08:00.990
is beyond the scope of
not just current AI,

01:08:00.990 --> 01:08:02.790
but any imaginable AI.

01:08:02.790 --> 01:08:05.480
That makes him a
mind creationist.

01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:07.468
He thinks of mind as a skyhook.

01:08:17.050 --> 01:08:20.529
We thought until
about 18 months ago

01:08:20.529 --> 01:08:27.880
that we had evolved some very
impressive economic structures,

01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:33.819
which went crashing
and burning since then.

01:08:33.819 --> 01:08:35.783
Is that an evolution
that went wrong?

01:08:40.060 --> 01:08:43.422
Evolution doesn't
guarantee success.

01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:53.609
After all, think of it this way.

01:08:53.609 --> 01:08:56.694
Something like 99% of the
species that have ever existed

01:08:56.694 --> 01:08:57.360
are now extinct.

01:09:01.380 --> 01:09:04.130
But here's a more hopeful
way of thinking of it.

01:09:04.130 --> 01:09:09.000
99% or more, much more
than 99%, of all the things

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:14.640
that have ever lived
have died childless.

01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:17.090
But not a single one
of your ancestors did.

01:09:20.569 --> 01:09:22.370
Think of how lucky
that makes you.

01:09:22.370 --> 01:09:26.870
You sit at the end of an
incredibly lucky strain that

01:09:26.870 --> 01:09:30.529
goes back three and
a half billion years

01:09:30.529 --> 01:09:34.587
without a single ancestor
that died childless.

01:09:41.550 --> 01:09:48.850
Dr. Dennett, you talked
about things-- culture

01:09:48.850 --> 01:09:52.880
such as tonal
music and religion,

01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:56.000
poetry, even
earworms, things which

01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:03.200
have universal appeal among
all cultures, but apparently

01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:09.470
no reasonable basis for
them at all that I can tell.

01:10:09.470 --> 01:10:14.390
I mean, there is a
theory which attempts

01:10:14.390 --> 01:10:23.120
to explain the universality, the
compellingness, of such things

01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:25.970
by describing them as an
artifact of the evolution

01:10:25.970 --> 01:10:28.280
of consciousness,
a theory which says

01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:33.530
that consciousness itself
is a product of memes

01:10:33.530 --> 01:10:35.180
rather than vice versa.

01:10:35.180 --> 01:10:38.840
And I'm talking about The
Theory of the Bicameral Mind

01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:40.000
By Dr. Julian James.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.260
I wonder if you'd
comment on that.

01:10:42.260 --> 01:10:43.004
Yeah.

01:10:43.004 --> 01:10:45.170
First of all, I got a lot
of good ideas from Julian.

01:10:45.170 --> 01:10:47.630
And I hope I've given
him credit along the way.

01:10:47.630 --> 01:10:49.130
I'm a fan of that book too.

01:10:49.130 --> 01:10:53.180
But I think Julian James
book is a classic book.

01:10:53.180 --> 01:10:55.190
It's also a sort
of cult classic,

01:10:55.190 --> 01:10:56.700
because it has some
wonderful ideas

01:10:56.700 --> 01:11:00.010
and it has some ideas that
I think are just daft.

01:11:00.010 --> 01:11:01.700
And I don't think
James could tell

01:11:01.700 --> 01:11:04.800
the difference between them.

01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:07.880
But that's like a lot of
other creative geniuses.

01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:12.170
So I have been happy to mime
his work for good insights

01:11:12.170 --> 01:11:12.962
over the years.

01:11:12.962 --> 01:11:15.170
And in my own theory of
consciousness, which you also

01:11:15.170 --> 01:11:17.090
sort of described
right there, I've

01:11:17.090 --> 01:11:18.830
drawn heavily on some of those.

01:11:18.830 --> 01:11:22.940
But let me quickly say
something about your point about

01:11:22.940 --> 01:11:27.020
whether there's any basis
for the survival of memes.

01:11:27.020 --> 01:11:31.540
To me, the single
most important gift

01:11:31.540 --> 01:11:35.200
of the memetic perspective
when we look at culture

01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:37.690
is that it acknowledges
and it helps

01:11:37.690 --> 01:11:43.720
us to see that cultural items
can persist not because they're

01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:46.240
good for us, not because they're
true, not because they're

01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:51.850
wonderful, but just because they
can replicate in our brains.

01:11:51.850 --> 01:11:57.220
Now many replicate in our brains
because they're wonderful.

01:11:57.220 --> 01:11:59.230
And those are the ones
that we particularly

01:11:59.230 --> 01:12:02.190
seek out, and domesticate,
and try to foster.

01:12:02.190 --> 01:12:04.852
Of course we're not always
very good judges of that.

01:12:04.852 --> 01:12:06.310
But it's very
important to remember

01:12:06.310 --> 01:12:12.130
that some cultural items
have their own fitness,

01:12:12.130 --> 01:12:14.680
independently of our fitness.

01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:18.600
When I was working on my
book on religion and people

01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:22.410
were learning that I was looking
at the evolution of religion

01:12:22.410 --> 01:12:26.490
and of religious memes, a lot
of people said to me, oh, Dan.

01:12:26.490 --> 01:12:29.940
That's really interesting.

01:12:29.940 --> 01:12:31.890
What do you think
religions are for?

01:12:31.890 --> 01:12:33.660
After all, every
human group that's

01:12:33.660 --> 01:12:36.970
ever been looked at closely has
religion of some form or other.

01:12:36.970 --> 01:12:39.130
It's got to be good
for something, right?

01:12:39.130 --> 01:12:41.970
And I said, no.

01:12:41.970 --> 01:12:43.080
Not necessarily.

01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:46.760
It might be, but
not necessarily.

01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:48.510
Every human group
that's ever been studied

01:12:48.510 --> 01:12:49.650
has the common cold.

01:12:49.650 --> 01:12:52.150
What's that good for?

01:12:52.150 --> 01:12:54.030
It's good for itself.

01:12:54.030 --> 01:12:55.390
It replicates because it can.

01:12:55.390 --> 01:12:57.790
It has its own fitness.

01:12:57.790 --> 01:12:59.410
And so do memes.

01:12:59.410 --> 01:13:02.740
Now many memes
have their fitness,

01:13:02.740 --> 01:13:07.090
as it were, in spite of our
efforts to eradicate them

01:13:07.090 --> 01:13:11.690
or in spite of the fact
that we don't care for them.

01:13:11.690 --> 01:13:14.380
Others have their fitness
because we treasure them

01:13:14.380 --> 01:13:16.930
dearly, rightly or wrongly.

01:13:16.930 --> 01:13:19.610
If you want to have a good
theory of cultural evolution,

01:13:19.610 --> 01:13:21.850
which I very much
want, you should

01:13:21.850 --> 01:13:24.310
start with a level
playing field, which

01:13:24.310 --> 01:13:31.500
says we need to explain
the fitness of memes

01:13:31.500 --> 01:13:32.790
in their own terms first.

01:13:32.790 --> 01:13:35.160
And then we can see which
of them are, if you like,

01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:38.280
mutualists, which ones of
them are beneficial to us,

01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:42.602
and which of them are parasites
and are not beneficial to us.

01:13:42.602 --> 01:13:44.078
Both are possible.

01:13:50.970 --> 01:13:59.490
This masterful lecture
this evening was the end,

01:13:59.490 --> 01:14:02.430
at this point-- it's
going on, of course--

01:14:02.430 --> 01:14:08.370
of 50 years of fighting
the creationists.

01:14:08.370 --> 01:14:11.010
And I think we all should
get down on our knees

01:14:11.010 --> 01:14:18.240
and thank God for
the creationists,

01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:22.950
because they forced us to
get our stuff together.

01:14:22.950 --> 01:14:23.970
Thank you, sir.

01:14:31.570 --> 01:14:33.470
Yes, Professor.

01:14:33.470 --> 01:14:37.970
I was thinking about three
constants-- time, sleep,

01:14:37.970 --> 01:14:40.940
and memory-- and how
they are combined.

01:14:40.940 --> 01:14:45.550
Also I'd like to make an
inquiry into time machines.

01:14:45.550 --> 01:14:48.580
Is memory a time machine,
a simplistic form

01:14:48.580 --> 01:14:50.360
of a time machine?

01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:55.330
And in speaking of
space time, that time,

01:14:55.330 --> 01:14:58.590
does time have memory?

01:14:58.590 --> 01:15:01.230
Well I'm just going to
take part of that, the part

01:15:01.230 --> 01:15:02.750
that I'm sure I understand.

01:15:07.510 --> 01:15:11.230
What I like to say is
that the job of brains

01:15:11.230 --> 01:15:15.340
is to produce future,
to produce expectations.

01:15:15.340 --> 01:15:19.840
And they do this by mining
the past and the present,

01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:24.310
and then turning that ore into
expectations about the future.

01:15:24.310 --> 01:15:26.380
Brains are anticipation makers.

01:15:26.380 --> 01:15:27.700
That's why we've got them.

01:15:27.700 --> 01:15:30.160
And our brains, we can
look farther and better

01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:32.230
into the future than
any other species.

01:15:32.230 --> 01:15:35.470
We can conceive of
events that will

01:15:35.470 --> 01:15:37.780
happen long after we are dead.

01:15:37.780 --> 01:15:41.200
We can conceive of events that
happen all over the universe.

01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:44.620
We're the only species
that can do this.

01:15:44.620 --> 01:15:48.610
But every species
has a brain, the job

01:15:48.610 --> 01:15:52.330
of which it is to extract
information from the world

01:15:52.330 --> 01:15:56.930
and use it to better anticipate
what's going to happen next.

01:15:56.930 --> 01:15:59.620
So there is a deep
relationship between memory,

01:15:59.620 --> 01:16:01.370
and expectation, and mind.

01:16:07.740 --> 01:16:11.370
I think it's fascinating to
hear about all these processes

01:16:11.370 --> 01:16:13.695
that go on in our brain.

01:16:13.695 --> 01:16:19.050
And I can almost visualize
these neurons firing like crazy

01:16:19.050 --> 01:16:20.310
to each other.

01:16:20.310 --> 01:16:27.240
But why do we actually have to
have the sensation of thinking?

01:16:27.240 --> 01:16:29.880
And what is it actually?

01:16:29.880 --> 01:16:31.530
And what is really good for?

01:16:31.530 --> 01:16:35.070
I think one of the philosophers,
one of your colleagues,

01:16:35.070 --> 01:16:39.720
once stated, why
aren't we all zombies?

01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:47.450
Well there's no short answer
to your question except this--

01:16:47.450 --> 01:16:48.350
we are all zombies.

01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:57.860
That is to say,
we, and we alone,

01:16:57.860 --> 01:17:00.170
are creatures who
are equipped when

01:17:00.170 --> 01:17:04.125
asked to talk about what
we've been thinking about.

01:17:04.125 --> 01:17:05.750
Penny for your
thoughts, somebody says.

01:17:05.750 --> 01:17:08.180
And we can answer.

01:17:08.180 --> 01:17:11.810
We are the kind of being that,
because we have language,

01:17:11.810 --> 01:17:19.100
is able to access some small
subset of the processes that

01:17:19.100 --> 01:17:21.200
are going on in our
brains, those neural

01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:22.910
processes you speak of.

01:17:22.910 --> 01:17:27.380
But when we do access them,
our capacities to verbalize

01:17:27.380 --> 01:17:31.370
have to be run through a
sort of metaphorical sieve

01:17:31.370 --> 01:17:36.680
so that we can only speak in
sort of unconscious metaphor

01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:39.150
about the processes actually
going on in our brain.

01:17:39.150 --> 01:17:41.180
But we can do that.

01:17:41.180 --> 01:17:43.375
And that, sir, is
what consciousness is.

01:17:46.155 --> 01:17:49.620
[INAUDIBLE]

01:17:55.560 --> 01:17:58.410
I don't know.

01:17:58.410 --> 01:18:02.070
I think we will
call it quits here

01:18:02.070 --> 01:18:05.494
and thank Dr. Dennett
for a wonderful talk.

01:18:20.140 --> 01:18:25.150
If you should happen to come
here at this time next week,

01:18:25.150 --> 01:18:28.840
you'll be surprised that
there isn't another talk.

01:18:28.840 --> 01:18:31.900
Instead there is a
Beethoven concert

01:18:31.900 --> 01:18:35.170
with the [INAUDIBLE] Symphony
and the [INAUDIBLE] Piano

01:18:35.170 --> 01:18:36.220
Concerto.

01:18:36.220 --> 01:18:40.540
But Dr. [INAUDIBLE] will be
talking the following week.

01:18:40.540 --> 01:18:42.910
So please write it
on your calendars.

01:18:42.910 --> 01:18:46.820
She will be talking about
observing the brain at work,

01:18:46.820 --> 01:18:50.620
seeing those neurons
firing, and starting

01:18:50.620 --> 01:18:55.600
on the process of trying to
understand how we actually

01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:58.540
go about thinking.

01:18:58.540 --> 01:19:05.530
So I'd not only like to thank
Dr. Dennett again, but also

01:19:05.530 --> 01:19:09.070
Dr. Taylor for coming
here to introduce him.

01:19:09.070 --> 01:19:10.920
Thank you.
