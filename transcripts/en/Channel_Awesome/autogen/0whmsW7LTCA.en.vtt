01:04:31.980 --> 01:04:31.990
another pilot for a TV show isn't it
 

01:04:31.990 --> 01:04:33.930
another pilot for a TV show isn't it
that explains why the animation looks

01:04:33.930 --> 01:04:33.940
that explains why the animation looks
 

01:04:33.940 --> 01:04:35.850
that explains why the animation looks
this way and why all the stories don't

01:04:35.850 --> 01:04:35.860
this way and why all the stories don't
 

01:04:35.860 --> 01:04:38.580
this way and why all the stories don't

01:04:38.590 --> 01:04:40.230
really connect that well damnit at least
what Tarzan and Jane I knew it was gonna

01:04:40.230 --> 01:04:40.240
what Tarzan and Jane I knew it was gonna
 

01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:42.570
what Tarzan and Jane I knew it was gonna
be a pilot to a TV show of this this

01:04:42.570 --> 01:04:42.580
be a pilot to a TV show of this this
 

01:04:42.580 --> 01:04:44.490
be a pilot to a TV show of this this
tried harder and fooled me into thinking

01:04:44.490 --> 01:04:44.500
tried harder and fooled me into thinking
 

01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:45.930
tried harder and fooled me into thinking
it was gonna be something that tries

01:04:45.930 --> 01:04:45.940
it was gonna be something that tries
 

01:04:45.940 --> 01:04:47.640
it was gonna be something that tries
hard throughout the whole thing I guess

01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:47.650
hard throughout the whole thing I guess
 

01:04:47.650 --> 01:04:49.830
hard throughout the whole thing I guess
it does technically have an ending and

01:04:49.830 --> 01:04:49.840
it does technically have an ending and
 

01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:51.720
it does technically have an ending and
yeah actually the endings not that bad

01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:51.730
yeah actually the endings not that bad
 

01:04:51.730 --> 01:04:53.400
yeah actually the endings not that bad
it even kind of retcons the ending of

01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:53.410
it even kind of retcons the ending of
 

01:04:53.410 --> 01:04:55.470
it even kind of retcons the ending of
the first film but it's weird when you

01:04:55.470 --> 01:04:55.480
the first film but it's weird when you
 

01:04:55.480 --> 01:04:57.300
the first film but it's weird when you
see the choice she makes you understand

01:04:57.300 --> 01:04:57.310
see the choice she makes you understand
 

01:04:57.310 --> 01:04:59.340
see the choice she makes you understand
her reasoning but there's also like a

01:04:59.340 --> 01:04:59.350
her reasoning but there's also like a
 

01:04:59.350 --> 01:05:01.230
her reasoning but there's also like a
ton of dangers that happen throughout

01:05:01.230 --> 01:05:01.240
ton of dangers that happen throughout
 

01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:03.330
ton of dangers that happen throughout
this film to go against her reasoning -

01:05:03.330 --> 01:05:03.340
this film to go against her reasoning -
 

01:05:03.340 --> 01:05:05.130
this film to go against her reasoning -
I'm not saying what happens is the wrong

01:05:05.130 --> 01:05:05.140
I'm not saying what happens is the wrong
 

01:05:05.140 --> 01:05:06.900
I'm not saying what happens is the wrong
choice I'm saying they never explained

01:05:06.900 --> 01:05:06.910
choice I'm saying they never explained
 

01:05:06.910 --> 01:05:08.640
choice I'm saying they never explained
the actual dangers that could come along

01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:08.650
the actual dangers that could come along
 

01:05:08.650 --> 01:05:10.230
the actual dangers that could come along
with it and that's very important to

01:05:10.230 --> 01:05:10.240
with it and that's very important to
 

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:13.350
with it and that's very important to
address so yeah I guess in terms of

01:05:13.350 --> 01:05:13.360
address so yeah I guess in terms of
 

01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:15.540
address so yeah I guess in terms of
other technicals the voice actors are

01:05:15.540 --> 01:05:15.550
other technicals the voice actors are
 

01:05:15.550 --> 01:05:17.490
other technicals the voice actors are
all replacements and they do a good job

01:05:17.490 --> 01:05:17.500
all replacements and they do a good job
 

01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:19.980
all replacements and they do a good job
the animation like I said is a huge

01:05:19.980 --> 01:05:19.990
the animation like I said is a huge
 

01:05:19.990 --> 01:05:22.650
the animation like I said is a huge
budget cut but for kind of TV animation

01:05:22.650 --> 01:05:22.660
budget cut but for kind of TV animation
 

01:05:22.660 --> 01:05:24.960
budget cut but for kind of TV animation
I guess it's fine sometimes there's a

01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:24.970
I guess it's fine sometimes there's a
 

01:05:24.970 --> 01:05:26.880
I guess it's fine sometimes there's a
really inventive idea like there's this

01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:26.890
really inventive idea like there's this
 

01:05:26.890 --> 01:05:29.220
really inventive idea like there's this
annoying dog that kind of sucks but he

01:05:29.220 --> 01:05:29.230
annoying dog that kind of sucks but he
 

01:05:29.230 --> 01:05:30.510
annoying dog that kind of sucks but he
was born in molten lava

01:05:30.510 --> 01:05:30.520
was born in molten lava
 

01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:31.980
was born in molten lava
so he'll counsel II do things like just

01:05:31.980 --> 01:05:31.990
so he'll counsel II do things like just
 

01:05:31.990 --> 01:05:34.230
so he'll counsel II do things like just
sleep in a fireplace that's not creative

01:05:34.230 --> 01:05:34.240
sleep in a fireplace that's not creative
 

01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:36.090
sleep in a fireplace that's not creative
and again when they're actually kind of

01:05:36.090 --> 01:05:36.100
and again when they're actually kind of
 

01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:38.070
and again when they're actually kind of
talking about this ant lanty and stuff

01:05:38.070 --> 01:05:38.080
talking about this ant lanty and stuff
 

01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:40.500
talking about this ant lanty and stuff
it is kind of interesting kind of like

01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:40.510
it is kind of interesting kind of like
 

01:05:40.510 --> 01:05:42.720
it is kind of interesting kind of like
the first film in that respect but sadly

01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:42.730
the first film in that respect but sadly
 

01:05:42.730 --> 01:05:45.210
the first film in that respect but sadly
it just doesn't stay focused and I don't

01:05:45.210 --> 01:05:45.220
it just doesn't stay focused and I don't
 

01:05:45.220 --> 01:05:46.590
it just doesn't stay focused and I don't
even know if it was actually meant to
