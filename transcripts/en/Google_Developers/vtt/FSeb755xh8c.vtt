NAZMUL IDRIS: Hi, everyone.

00:00:07.275 --> 00:00:07.800
I'm Nazmul.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:08.840
And I'm a developer.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.210
IZABEL IDRIS: And
hi, I'm Izabel.

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:10.800
I'm a designer.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.340
In today's episode of "UX Design
for Developers," we're

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.440
going to talk about how to
create really awesome social

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:16.850
user experiences.

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.290
We're going to talk about some
best practices and some design

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.360
patterns that you guys can use
to implement social in your

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.380
applications.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.755
And today we have a very special
guest named Sam.

00:00:25.755 --> 00:00:26.740
SAM STERN: Hi, I'm Sam.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.720
And I'm a developer for Google+
Developer relations.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:30.510
IZABEL IDRIS: So, I'm
going to start off

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.920
by asking some questions.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.810
Nazmul, there's a lot of
buzz around Social.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.770
But tell us, what is social and
why it's important, and

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.070
what's the value for us
using it in our apps?

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.980
NAZMUL IDRIS: So if you go to
the slides, there's really two

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.650
main concepts we have to think
about when we're thinking

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:46.820
about social, because social
is like a buzzword--

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.690
everybody uses it and everybody
interprets it in a

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:49.530
different way.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.350
So what really is social?

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.440
There's really two main concepts
that make up social.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.510
And they are having a portable
identity that you could take

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.320
with you and apply to any
application on the internet--

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.250
and so when you say things like
sign in with Google or

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.740
log in with Facebook, that's
what we're talking about.

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.830
The other concept is sharing
activities, which means that

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.000
whatever actions or activities
you perform in whatever

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.840
application, the idea is that
you should be able to take

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.640
those activities and then expose
it or share it with an

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.540
audience of your choice.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.430
And so when you put these two
together, you have the

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.310
beginnings of social.

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.280
Now, those concepts are
implemented very specifically

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.780
across various social
network providers.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.230
So the three main features that
are almost everybody has

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:41.460
are sign-in, personalization,
and sharing.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.150
So sign-in, that really, from a
user experience perspective,

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.240
that feature addresses reducing
friction that a user

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.210
has to experience when they
first encounter your

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.790
application.

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.790
So it really eliminates having
to create a new account by

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.130
providing information that you
already stored somewhere else,

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.880
like in your profile for
Google+, for example.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.970
So the idea there is that if you
sign in with a provider,

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.789
you don't have to
provide all that

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:11.870
information all over again.

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.110
And that makes logging in and
account creation totally

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.450
seamless and really,
really easy.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.710
So the next thing is once you
signed in, how does the

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.540
application respond to the
fact you've signed in?

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.420
How is it showing you that there
is a signed in state?

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:26.930
So that's when personalization
comes in.

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.540
And personalization is the
act of your application,

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.210
essentially taking things like
your name, your profile

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.710
picture, and any other relevant
information, like

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.330
what Google Now does sometimes,
when it's your

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.790
birthday, it says, hey,
happy birthday, Sam.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.580
Not that it's Sam's birthday
today, just an example.

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.890
But so personalization is key in
making you feel at home in

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.560
your application.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.630
And, finally, sharing.

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.610
Sharing is just taking certain
application activities and

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.380
then exposing them to whatever
audience in a

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.460
way that makes sense.

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.950
And different or social network
providers do it

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.260
differently.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.550
IZABEL IDRIS: OK, so now that
we know a little bit about

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.140
social, should we
put in our apps?

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.530
And how are our end users going
to benefit from social?

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.640
NAZMUL IDRIS: That's actually
a really good question.

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.020
There are really two things
to consider from the user

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.090
experience perspective to
answer the question.

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.280
And those are do you have
a signed-in experience?

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.040
And you have an enormous
experience?

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.870
So what do those mean?

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.160
An anonymous experience is
you've, for example, gone to

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.940
amazon.com.

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.890
You haven't signed in, and
it doesn't know who you.

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.130
Are it's showing you just a

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.820
catalogue of Amazon's products.

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:42.890
If your application can have a
signed out experience, or an

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.300
anonymous experience, and also
signed in inexperienced, just

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.950
like, again, with Amazon--
when you're signed in, it

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.500
knows who you are, it gives
you your wish list, your

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.270
recommendations, your shopping
cart and so on.

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:56.070
That's an example of an
application that can have both

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:00.500
an anonymous experience and
a signed in experience.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.560
So sometimes, if you're--

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.600
So Gmail is actually another
example, different than

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.450
Amazon, because Gmail does not
have an anonymous experience.

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.310
You have to signed in to Gmail
for Gmail to make any sense.

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.600
So to answer the question, if
your application can do

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.089
without a signed-in experience,
then you really

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:22.830
have to think about
how to make your

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.010
social integration special.

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.870
Don't just put social
into an application

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.600
because it's a buzzword.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.910
It has to make sense in the
context of your application.

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.000
Now, if you have a certain type
of application which does

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.690
not have an anonymous
experience, then you don't

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.910
have a choice but to
make it social.

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.210
And in that case, also, make
sure that you do a really good

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.390
integration, because a bad
integration with social will

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:47.580
end up turning people off, more
than actually engaging

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.126
them or delighting them.

00:04:49.126 --> 00:04:50.430
IZABEL IDRIS: There's one thing
I wanted to mention,

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.490
because social features can
surface in your application in

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:54.510
many places.

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.060
I think it really makes sense
for social to be taken into

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.990
consideration early
on in the design.

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.160
Designers, PMs, and developers
should all think about how

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.430
social is going to surface in
the application, because it

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.930
really goes into the DNA
of the application.

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.190
A lot of people think social is
just a Share button or just

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.040
a Login button, but I think it
needs to be really thought of

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.230
in a more holistic way early
on in your project.

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:21.730
So Sam, should people implement
these social

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:22.540
features on their own?

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:24.380
How should they go about this?

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.230
SAM STERN: So I think it's
tempting for a lot of people

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:28.370
to say, my application
needs a messaging

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.480
service, let's build messaging.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.310
But there are people--

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:34.170
and these are social providers--
that do this all

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:35.350
day, and they do it very well.

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:38.220
And you shouldn't reinvent the
wheel, we should let these

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:39.580
social networks do what
they do best.

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:42.050
And sort of outsource
your social

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:43.770
features to these networks.

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:46.190
So if you're going to have a
friends model, you should

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:50.140
really consider off loading that
to Google+ or Facebook,

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:52.830
or something that can provide
you with a social model.

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.650
So there's no need, especially
if you are a startup, to spend

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.290
all this effort implementing
social features that have

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.980
almost definitely been done
better by someone else.

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:02.000
IZABEL IDRIS: So from an end
user perspective, why do you

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.230
think end users choose
social login?

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:07.340
And how do they choose which
provider to log in with?

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.160
SAM STERN: I think users choose
social login, like

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.660
Nazmul said, to reduce
friction.

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.830
Almost always if you can
click once and be

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:14.470
logged into a new service.

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:17.960
And, yeah, there's a trust
factor there too, because

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.280
they've already made an account
with the social

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.180
provider, so they've already
given their trust to that

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:21.740
application.

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.040
This way they don't have to
further distribute their trust

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:28.200
among more developers that they
might not know too well.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:32.300
And they choose a social
provider based on--

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:33.720
assuming there are multiple
offers-- based

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:34.620
on the feature sets.

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:37.880
So you might choose Facebook,
because you're dying to share

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:39.580
everything you do with your
friends, and you might choose

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:42.470
LinkedIn, because you want to
connect with your coworkers.

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:45.880
So that's a portable identity.

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.500
And which provider you
choose is also a data

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.360
point in that identity.

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.130
IZABEL IDRIS: So as a developer,
should we choose to

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:53.910
implement social login?

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:57.040
And if so, should we implement
multiple providers?

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.330
SAM STERN: I think it's
important for developers who

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.780
are implementing social login
to consider multiple

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:04.320
providers, Because it's
one more thing you can

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:05.310
know about your user.

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:07.300
It's a choice they're making,
and you should be able to

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:08.685
react to that choice.

00:07:08.685 --> 00:07:10.890
Like the example I gave earlier,
if someone chooses to

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:13.270
log in with LinkedIn, that's
saying something about how

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:14.450
they intend to use
your application.

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:16.490
And you only know the
choice they made, if

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:17.800
you give them a choice.

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.650
So if you just offer to sign
them in with Google+, the only

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:23.860
thing you're learning is do they
have a Google+ or not.

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:25.580
But if you give them multiple
providers, that's one more

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:27.360
thing you can learn about your
users, and one more way your

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:29.900
website can react and create
a great experience.

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:31.550
IZABEL IDRIS: So now that we
know about all the cool things

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:33.870
we can do with social, let's
talk about the developer

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:34.980
experience.

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:37.700
What's the best way to
implement social?

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:40.040
SAM STERN: Implementing social
is not very hard, but it's

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:41.100
hard to do well.

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:44.130
So there's a lot of code you
can just drop into your

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:46.880
application, but that can
quickly make things messy.

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:48.590
And you have to think
about why you're

00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:49.450
implementing social.

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:52.760
To make your users able
to do more things.

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.360
And your code should reflect
that you've expanded the

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.060
abilities of your users.

00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:00.680
So you don't want to have your
code littered with branching

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:03.550
statements, like if the user's
signing in with Google, share

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:04.760
it to Google, if they're signing
in with Facebook,

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:07.950
share it to Facebook, because
that's really leaking your

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:10.350
social logic into your business
logic and defeating

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:13.560
the point of why you did this
in the first place.

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:15.010
You want to just make
it seem like your

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:15.780
app has more functions.

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:17.540
So your code should
reflect this.

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:20.110
And you want to separate the
social logic entirely so that

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:23.270
you just say, the user has
bought a widget and the user

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:25.470
is sharing buying a widget.

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:29.250
And you let some other code or
library somewhere handle what

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:31.080
network they're sharing
this to, how exactly

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:33.659
that's being done.

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:36.280
And of course, this will be
harder at the very beginning,

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:38.270
when it might be easier
just to drop in code.

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:40.370
But the idea is as you add more
features, maybe you want

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:43.339
to add two or three more login
providers as you really get

00:08:43.339 --> 00:08:45.410
the hang of this, it's going to
be so much easier if you do

00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:48.150
this in a principaled matter and
think of that as expanding

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:50.390
the ability of your users, and
not just dropping code

00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:51.905
snippets throughout
your application.

00:08:51.905 --> 00:08:52.580
NAZMUL IDRIS: That
makes sense.

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:55.790
It's like using separation of
concerns, essentially, to

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:59.850
isolate different providers
and make sure that you can

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:03.410
express social capabilities of
your application but leave it

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:05.100
up to your provider
implementations.

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:08.500
Very much like Android does it
with location providers.

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:11.270
Where you can ask Android,
hey, give me a location

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:13.040
provider and give it
to your criteria.

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:15.450
And then Android might hand you
different ones-- like some

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:18.290
consume more batteries, some
give you more accurate

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:21.780
readings, and then others give
you quick readings, but they

00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:23.130
might not be as accurate.

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:26.140
So it's kind of like that, where
they've basically taken

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:30.060
this very complex Location
Provider model--

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:32.360
or very many different providers
and then abstract it

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.303
to a much simpler model.

00:09:34.303 --> 00:09:34.990
Is that--

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:35.720
SAM STERN: Yeah, that's right.

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:38.610
And it's also-- a way to think
about it is you wouldn't let

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:43.300
the social features take over
your entire UI, it's an

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:44.530
extension of your business.

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:46.900
And so if someone's looking at
your code and you onboarding

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:48.640
new developers, they should
see it that way too.

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:51.570
This is an extension and this
is not the driving force.

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:52.930
NAZMUL IDRIS: That
makes sense.

00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:56.380
So you almost don't want to
denature the DNA, if you will,

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:58.680
of your application by thinking
of it just as a

00:09:58.680 --> 00:09:59.965
conduit for sharing
activities.

00:09:59.965 --> 00:10:00.790
SAM STERN: Right.

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:02.180
NAZMUL IDRIS: Or for how do you

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:03.290
accommodate a portable identity?

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:06.740
It's like you have to maintain
who you are, what your

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:10.580
application was meant to do,
and then augment it with

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:14.120
social features, as it makes
sense, in the context of your

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:16.230
application and the experience
you're delivering.

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:17.082
SAM STERN: Exactly.

00:10:17.082 --> 00:10:18.460
IZABEL IDRIS: How does
everything we've discussed

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:21.480
here today affect the user
experience for our end users?

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:23.300
NAZMUL IDRIS: That's a
really good question.

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:27.530
If your application allows or
provides the user a choice to

00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:30.650
sign in with multiple providers,
then it's very,

00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:33.890
very important in the user
experience to really make this

00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:37.000
user feel good about the choice
that they've made.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.580
So a really, really bad design
pattern, an anti-pattern,

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:43.660
would be that if you asked them
to basically choose one

00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:47.110
provider, then in the flow of
your application you keep

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:49.840
prompting them to use another
provider, as if you really

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:52.920
wanted them to sign in with this
other provider, but you

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:54.250
were kind of--

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:57.250
you're not really OK with them
signing in with the provider

00:10:57.250 --> 00:10:58.950
they chose, but you're
tolerating it.

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:01.340
But you really wanted them to
use the other provider.

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:04.000
So if your application is
delivering that tone or that

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.690
mood to the user, then that's
not really good, because then

00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:08.930
the user feels bad that they've

00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:10.310
chosen the wrong provider.

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:15.120
Also, another anti-pattern is do
not ask users to sign with

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:18.290
every single provider that they
might have an account on.

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:19.100
That's redundant.

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:21.420
And unless you can
deliver value--

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:25.060
and you have to let the user
know upfront what value they

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:30.130
are going to get from actually
connecting your application to

00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:31.870
all their identities--

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:34.900
unless you can give them this
value proposition upfront,

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:38.170
it's a really, really bad idea
to ask them to connect to

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:38.960
every single provider.

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:40.630
Because the whole point,
if you remember,

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:41.990
was to remove friction.

00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:45.170
And now what you've done is
you've layered more friction

00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:47.780
onto a process that's supposed
to be frictionless.

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:48.741
IZABEL IDRIS: It takes
away value.

00:11:48.741 --> 00:11:51.150
It almost makes it feel like
you just want their dates,

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:53.520
you're just trying to get at
their friends or their data.

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:54.020
NAZMUL IDRIS: Exactly.

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:57.320
And that also is a very bad
thing to do is to give the

00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:04.630
impression that when you're
asking somebody to sign in

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:09.130
with their identity, you have to
deliver an experience that

00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:12.270
was better than if they had
an anonymous experience.

00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:15.560
If you're not doing that, then
why are you doing social

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:16.680
integration?

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:20.000
Additionally, if you're asking
them for multiple identities,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.290
then there has to be a value
proposition to the user, which

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:25.560
is pretty clear, and they
have to see that in your

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:26.210
experience as well.

00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:28.340
That means that you're unlocking
certain capabilities

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:31.470
that might not have existed if
you had a single provider.

00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:34.020
So unless you can do all of
the above, it's not a good

00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:37.480
idea to actually ask them
from multiple providers.

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:40.700
SAM STERN: You said before about
making the application

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:43.090
seem like it was built for
the choice the user made.

00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:44.800
Could you elaborate on
that a little bit?

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:45.810
NAZMUL IDRIS: Sure.

00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:49.840
So for example, if you're
signing in with something like

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:53.910
LinkedIn, then the type of
information or the activities

00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:56.370
that your application should
share should be more

00:12:56.370 --> 00:12:57.490
work-related.

00:12:57.490 --> 00:12:59.520
Versus, let's say, you've signed
in with Facebook, where

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:01.820
that could be more personal
stuff, more fun stuff.

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:05.010
Or, let's say, you signed in
with GitHub, where now we're

00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:08.660
talking more technical stuff,
like coding oriented.

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:12.000
So the application that you're
building obviously has a

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.200
certain user experience in mind,
it does certain things.

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:18.440
And so you should align these
identity providers with what

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:21.290
you're trying to deliver, and
then when there is alignment,

00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:24.960
then the user will feel like
they're getting a tremendous

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:26.660
amount of value from the choice
they've made, and

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:28.745
they'll feel good about having
made that choice.

00:13:28.745 --> 00:13:30.130
Does that answer
your question?

00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:31.220
SAM STERN: Yeah, I think that
makes a lot of sense.

00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:31.800
NAZMUL IDRIS: Cool.

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:34.950
IZABEL IDRIS: I think for one
thing that can really enhance

00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:38.100
the user experience is, like
with Google search results

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:40.200
too, you can see which one of
your friends has +1 certain

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:42.470
sites, or even the Google Play
store, you can see which one

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:46.170
of your friends in Google+
have +1 certain items.

00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:47.620
And that can help you make
better decisions.

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:49.105
And I think that adds
a lot of value.

00:13:49.105 --> 00:13:49.880
NAZMUL IDRIS: That true.

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:53.830
The social proof is a really,
really big component of

00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:56.500
actually enhancing my
experience, because if I'm

00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:59.640
looking for a particular
application in Google Play,

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:01.190
and Sam has +1'ed it.

00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:03.100
I trust Sam, Sam is awesome.

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:06.660
So then by extension, I think
this application is good,

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:08.710
because Sam said that it was
a really application.

00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:11.610
And vice versa, if Sam gives
it a negative review, then

00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:15.250
obviously, I would take that
data point in too.

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:17.080
I would basically trust that
interview more than an

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:17.520
anonymous review.

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:22.230
So for example, if I'm signed
into Amazon, then I have a lot

00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:24.250
of reviews, with a lot of
ratings, and I'm not really

00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:25.830
sure whether--

00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:26.720
I don't know these people.

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:30.450
So if I can see Sam reviewing
something, I have much more

00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:32.550
confidence in that review
then if it's

00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:34.380
just some random person.

00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:35.730
Even if those reviews
are good.

00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:37.240
It's just a human thing.

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:39.600
And again, when we talk about
social here, it's really

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:43.780
important to think of this as
a human experience, because

00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:46.090
social should not be
some feature set.

00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:47.690
Like I mentioned three
features--

00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:51.400
sign-in, personalization,
and sharing.

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:54.840
Social is just not a composite
of these features, social is

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:56.500
something that we
do as humans.

00:14:56.500 --> 00:15:00.390
And these features are trying
to enhance what we would

00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:02.470
normally do anyway as people.

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:05.630
So that's, I think, another
kind of meta concept.

00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:07.230
But I think it's really
important to now.

00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:09.970
And that's why we talked about
making users feel good about

00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:12.460
the choice they've
made, and so on.

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:14.810
SAM STERN: If you're a developer
and you're looking

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:17.070
to get started with multiple
providers, and Nazmul has

00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:18.965
especially convinced you that
this can really add advantage

00:15:18.965 --> 00:15:23.670
to your application, I've done
another GDL on this topic and

00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:25.365
I wrote a tutorial on
how to get started

00:15:25.365 --> 00:15:26.190
with multiple providers.

00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:29.316
And the links are below, if you
want to get started and

00:15:29.316 --> 00:15:30.110
get coding.

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:33.180
NAZMUL IDRIS: Yes, there is a
good example, actually, of how

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:34.620
to use Google+ and Facebook.

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:36.780
And I think the application
is called Wigwam now.

00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:39.120
SAM STERN: Yeah, and there's
also code samples on GitHub

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:39.880
[INAUDIBLE] as well.

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:40.190
NAZMUL IDRIS: Cool.

00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:41.855
And it's a web app and a mobile
