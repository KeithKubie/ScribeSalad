00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:07.050
It sounds like a very mean and undemocratic
thought, trading off the peculiar glamour

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:12.789
that isolation has in a Romantic culture – in
order to gain an oblique sense of superiority

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:18.660
and perhaps pass off an absence of social
skills as a virtue. It is important, therefore,

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:25.089
to be clear what is meant here by intelligence.
It has nothing to do with degrees or any of

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:31.960
the criteria by which we ordinarily measure
cleverness. What is meant is emotional intelligence,

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:39.940
which exists (or not) in every strata and
nook of society. Emotional intelligence means

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.390
a capacity for self-honesty and self-observation;
it means, a knack for opening oneself up to

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.560
the stranger, more exciting, less easily admissible
aspects of oneself and at the same time for

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:57.100
noticing the many beautiful, peculiar and
profound experiences and sensations passing

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.980
through consciousness. We’re not used to
doing this. We cleave tightly to reassuring

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:09.540
notions of what normal people are like, which
means we exclude a lot – often the richest

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:16.390
bit – of what we truly feel, want and think.
We edit out our more generous, wilder, more

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:22.810
impatient, more terrifying sides; leaving
only the socially admissible husk that we

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:28.740
artfully pretend is who we are. And simultaneously,
we ensure that we are never far from something

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.159
that can take us powerfully away from ourselves,
and so miss out on the troubling wonders that

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:40.320
streak across the mental horizon at every
instant. Most of what is in our minds remains

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:47.700
unfelt and unseen, troubling us only in the
small hours. Insomnia is the revenge for all

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:54.530
that we tried so hard not to notice in the
daylight. In this context, emotional intelligence

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:00.380
emerges as a species of courage, directed
at vanquishing not an external enemy but a

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:07.060
fear of being weird or of going mad. A certain
sort of intelligent person is, above all else,

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:13.250
a superior and more committed reporter of
their inner states. Or, as Emerson once put

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:20.569
it, ‘In the minds of geniuses, we find – once
more – our own neglected thoughts.’ It

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:26.090
is almost certain that people who have devoted
themselves to self-honesty and self-observation

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:32.359
have an above average chance of meeting with
incomprehension, irritation, censorship or

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:39.060
boredom when they attempt to share the data
from their own minds frankly in company. Their

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.370
thoughts (it might be on politics or architecture,
family life or sexuality) will sound more

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:51.150
threatening, intense, oblique or tender than
is allowed. That feels lonely, if one is in

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.260
the mood to frame things like this. There
are simply fewer people at large committed

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.690
to self-honesty and self-observation – and
therefore up for exchanging notes on what

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:08.549
it’s truly like to be alive. Yet there is
one resource that is exceptionally well suited

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:14.459
to address the feelings of disconnection liable
to be felt by the emotionally intelligent:

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:21.099
art. Works of art are humanity’s secret
diary: records of all that could not be said

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:26.129
in regular social contexts, but which have
found a home in the more intimate, honest

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:32.400
communication that can take place between
an art-work and its audience. The libraries,

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.449
cinemas and galleries of the world are repositories
for all the sensations that didn’t easily

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:42.969
make it into standard interactions and that
contain what we need to state, and crave to

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:50.090
hear as audiences, in our lonely states. Therefore,
while emotionally intelligent people may have

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:56.349
an uncommonly hard time not being lonely with
a person, they have an unusually easy time

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:01.739
finding company with people who are not in
the room, the fancy term for which we call

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:08.379
art. We have perhaps over-privileged certain
standard notions of friendship. We may just

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:12.969
have to accept that our best friends could
have died 250 years ago – and be chatting

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:19.269
to us via dabs of paint or within rhyming
pentameters. That said, the goal shouldn’t

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:24.940
be a society where art is ever more prevalent
and more available when loneliness strikes.

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:30.960
It is perhaps a society where art is ever
less necessary – because we have grown better

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:36.860
at knowing how to share more of who we are
in the ordinary moments of our lives; where

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.880
we have found a more direct and reliable path
out from our loneliness.
