00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.340
I'm gonna give you an astounding result

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:03.480
Astounding?

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:04.360
An astounding result

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.400
So I'm just gonna write down a little sum

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.400
I'm just gonna see what answer it gives.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.920
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + duh duh duh duh duh

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.170
And I include all the 
natural numbers, so all the way up to infinity

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.260
So what do you reckon the answer to this is, Brady?

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.060
-Well I would say it would go to tend towards infinity.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.939
Yeah, that makes sense, doesn't
it.

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.140
The answer to this sum is -- remarkably -- minus a twelfth.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.410
It's amazing! I mean, I first saw this result
when I start learning a bit of String Theory

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:44.000
And what's even more bizarre is that this
result is used in many areas of physics

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.559
This is a very well known string theory
textbook by Joe Polchinski.  As you can see,

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:53.640
sort of quite early on, page 22, we have this
statement here which is that the sum of

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.329
all this is --- basically saying the sum of
all the integers ---

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:00.480
all natural numbers all the way up to infinity, is, minus a twelfth.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.520
Alright so we're going to prove now,

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.400
Without getting our knickers in a twist with Riemann zeta functions, we gonna prove

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.819
in quite simple way, why the sum of all the natural numbers is indeed minus a twelfth.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.220
So, to do that we're gonna do this in a
number of steps.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.820
We're gonna to look at a few different sums.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.860
The first sum that I want to look at, I'm gonna call it S1.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:28.000
And it's 1 -1 +1 -1 +1 -1 and so on.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.920
That's the first sum I wanna look at in principle.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:38.719
The second sum I'm gonna look at is 1-2+3-4 and so on

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.160
Carry on in that process all the way up.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.980
And the third one is of course going to be

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.740
the one we're really interested in which is 1+2+3+4... and so on.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.500
So we're gonna evaluate all these 3 different sums.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.500
Now the first one is really easy to evaluate.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.960
We need to attach a number. Now clearly what is the answer to this?

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.040
You stop this at any point.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.120
Okay, if you stop it at an odd point you're going to get the answer 1.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.000
You stop it at an even point you'll get the answer 0, clearly.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.740
That's obvious right?

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.040
So what number are we gonna attach 
to this infinite sum?

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.480
Do we stop at an odd or an even point?

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.640
We don't know so we take the average of the two.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.300
So the answer is a half.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.240
There're other ways to prove that this sum is a half by the way,

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.720
which we can do if you want...

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.800
No, no, there'll be a link, there'll be a link there, 'cause we've done it before.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.500
ok, good ...
See the link there

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.140
Ok so this is a half and I think intuitively that's the easiest way to say

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.580
that you either get 0 or 1, and therefore you just take the average...

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.040
So this is the natural number to attach to this sum.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.860
So once we know this we're laughing, ok?

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.280
Because from this we can achieve everything we want to achieve.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.480
The next step is to find out what this sum is.

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.500
So what I'm gonna do is... I'm going to take two copies of this S2, ok.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.340
So I'm gonna add it to itself. So 2 times S2 is equal to...

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.840
Let me just write it out. I will write it out twice

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.100
1 -2 +3 -4 duh duh duh and so on.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.000
And then I'm gonna add to it itself, but I'm gonna shift it along a little bit

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:19.880
So that's +1-2+3-4 and so on

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.700
I've just taken two copies and added them together. But I've done it in a particularly nice way,

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.460
and I just pushed this one along slightly on the bottom.

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:32.380
So now see what you get: you take this 1 and this... This and this and I get 1.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.560
So 1 + nothing is 1

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.780
-2 +1... -1

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.020
3 -2 is 1

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.580
-4 +3 is -1 duh duh duh and so on. And I 'm gonna keep getting this pattern.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.520
So hang on a minute, I just got back to the sum that I started with.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.000
Which I know the answer to it: a half.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.940
Ok, so therefore I know this sum.

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.940
So let's divide through by this 2 and I get a quarter.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.000
So now I know that this sum, the second sum with somewhere the signs alternate

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:03.800
is actually equal to 1/4.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.500
So this is my second remarkable result.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.760
Now I have everything I need to prove
this crazy -1/12 thing, right.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:11.880
Ok, so let's do it.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.540
I'm going to take this one and I'm going to subtract this one.

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.600
Ok, so I'm going to substract S2 from S. Let's write them (?)

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.880
Ok, so I'm going to write our S first which is 1 + 2

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:24.360
+3

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.880
+4

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.400
+5 and so on. Ok.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.600
And I'm going to subtract S2.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.460
So that's minus

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.540
and let me just put a bracket. And now, because I'm gonna "minus" all of this

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:42.300
1 -2 +3 -4 and so on.

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.360
Ok 1 - 1 what's that?

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.580
-Zero
-Zero, yeah, exactly. So I get nothing from that bit.

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.500
2 - (-2) is... 4

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.220
Ok 3 - 3... 0

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.540
4 - (-4) is... 8

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.120
And so on.

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.260
And the next one, I'm gonna get it from the 5, so I get nothing.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.860
From the 6 here I get 12, and so on duh duh duh...

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:12.300
And it proceeds in that way.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.540
And now you can see we're almost there now right.

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:16.820
Because look what I've got here. I've got 4 + 8 + 12.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.720
I'll take a factor of 4 out.

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:23.900
It's 4 times 1 + 2 + 3 duh duh duh

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.920
Ok

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.280
It's my sum I want to...

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.100
So now I've got a formula So this is just 4 time S,

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:32.480
which is my sum.

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.100
Now I just solve this equation, right, because I know what S2 is.

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:40.200
So I have now the expression S minus... I know what S2 is: S2 is 1/4

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:42.760
is equal to 4S.

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:48.900
Ok, let's take S from either sides, so I get -1/4 is equal to 3S.

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.940
Which implies that S equals -1/12.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.240
(?) you believe me.

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.460
That's amazing, I love it... It's so nice...

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:01.320
(?)

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:03.160
Tony, if I've got a calculator out,

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:09.240
and wrote 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 and I sat here until the end of everything,

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:10.740
and then press =

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.200
-Will I get -1/12 ?
-What do you mean by the end of everything?

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.800
You can't do it till the end of everything, can you?

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:21.880
So, the point is I know it looks like a
bit of mathematical hocus-pocus or thing, but...

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.940
I tell you the truth it's not, and I'll tell you why we know it's not:

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:28.100
And I know you think I've gone about physics too much.

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:29.700
But we know it's not because of physics.

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.700
Because these kinds of sums appear in physics.

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.900
And in physics we don't get infinite answers.

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.300
It's amazing. It's amazing and it's just...

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:41.680
You know, I was trying to come up with an intuitive reason for this,

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:42.860
and I just couldn't.

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:44.680
*laughing*
to be honest

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:48.540
You have to do the mathematical
hocus-pocus really to see it.

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:54.099
And then you just have to believe that you're not measuring physical infinities in nature

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:57.840
and those two facts, I think, give you confidence in this result. But...

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:00.880
it is clearly counter-intuitive.
It's counter-intuitive because

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:06.320
intuitively, you just want to stop the sequence, and in the minute you stop the sequence...

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:10.360
then all your intuition for this result goes out the window

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:15.260
So what if I do 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5... and I go up to a googleplex ?

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:19.760
You get a big number... you won't
get anything like -1/12.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.980
You'll have to get to infinity, Brady

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:25.100
It's negative.

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.820
I've added all these positive numbers together up to infinity

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:31.740
and I've got -1/12.

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:35.660
But it does play a role in lots of different things

00:07:35.669 --> 00:07:42.360
that the number 12 and and it's so for
example as I said the calculations of

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:46.140
the critical dimension in string theory, the 26 dimensions

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:48.260
comes from this calculation.
