00:00:15.176 --> 00:00:17.966
&gt;&gt;Narrator: These first-graders
are learning all about opera...

00:00:18.516 --> 00:00:20.576
&gt;&gt;Class: [applauds]

00:00:21.076 --> 00:00:22.436
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Let's give
them a round of applause.

00:00:22.436 --> 00:00:23.426
Take a bow, guys.

00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:26.186
&gt;&gt;Narrator: ...and with the help of
professional singers and musicians,

00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:28.356
they're also becoming writers.

00:00:28.536 --> 00:00:31.096
&gt;&gt;Teacher: How does Papageno feel
in the beginning of the story?

00:00:32.396 --> 00:00:32.736
&gt;&gt;Student: Thrilled.

00:00:33.046 --> 00:00:35.296
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Very good, and
then how do they both feel

00:00:35.296 --> 00:00:36.306
at the end of our song?

00:00:36.956 --> 00:00:38.606
It means really, really happy.

00:00:38.836 --> 00:00:39.816
How did they feel?

00:00:39.916 --> 00:00:40.456
&gt;&gt;Student: Exuberant.

00:00:40.456 --> 00:00:42.836
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Exuberance, very
good, they feel exuberance...

00:00:42.836 --> 00:00:45.216
&gt;&gt;Narrator: At Corbett Elementary
School in Tucson, Arizona,

00:00:45.516 --> 00:00:49.576
the arts enhance instruction
in math, reading, writing,

00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:51.316
science and social studies.

00:00:51.476 --> 00:00:54.206
&gt;&gt;Teacher: What words do you use
when you're at the end of a story?

00:00:54.666 --> 00:00:55.286
&gt;&gt;Student: Finally.

00:00:55.486 --> 00:00:56.166
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Finally, very good.

00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:58.896
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The Arts Infusion
Program, now operating in more

00:00:58.896 --> 00:01:03.956
than 44 schools, it called OMA:
Opening Minds through the Arts.

00:01:04.526 --> 00:01:06.596
&gt;&gt;Joan: Opening Minds
through the Arts is a program

00:01:06.596 --> 00:01:09.536
that utilizes the arts to
boost student achievement

00:01:09.836 --> 00:01:14.616
and social growth, one that uses
those tools in music, writing,

00:01:14.616 --> 00:01:18.206
visual arts and dance to
make connections for children

00:01:18.436 --> 00:01:20.746
that are related to their
neurological development

00:01:21.116 --> 00:01:21.976
and to their social growth.

00:01:22.516 --> 00:01:28.546
&gt;&gt;Class: [sings]

00:01:29.046 --> 00:01:32.216
&gt;&gt;Narrator: OMA is based on brain
research showing that the wiring

00:01:32.216 --> 00:01:36.366
of the left to the right side of the
brain takes place between the ages

00:01:36.366 --> 00:01:39.766
of four and twelve, a
time when children learn

00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:41.916
from different forms of stimulation.

00:01:42.056 --> 00:01:44.366
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Is there
something that we're making

00:01:45.636 --> 00:01:47.566
with ourselves that we're forming?

00:01:47.766 --> 00:01:48.596
Let's see.

00:01:48.686 --> 00:01:49.076
Esteban?

00:01:49.626 --> 00:01:50.956
&gt;&gt;Esteban: A pattern.

00:01:51.206 --> 00:01:54.926
&gt;&gt;Teacher: A pattern; what
kind of pattern are we making?

00:01:54.926 --> 00:01:57.026
&gt;&gt;Esteban: A high-low pattern.

00:01:57.026 --> 00:02:02.206
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Music helps kindergarten
children learn to listen.

00:02:02.346 --> 00:02:05.506
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Our very first
shape today is a triangle.

00:02:06.056 --> 00:02:08.306
Hand on your hips.

00:02:08.306 --> 00:02:08.996
One, two.

00:02:08.996 --> 00:02:11.726
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Dance helps
second-graders learn geometry.

00:02:11.826 --> 00:02:16.916
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Now put your feet apart
so you have a triangle in your legs.

00:02:16.916 --> 00:02:20.926
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Fourth-graders study
science while learning the violin.

00:02:20.926 --> 00:02:23.486
&gt;&gt;Teacher: How does humidity
affect our instrument?

00:02:23.946 --> 00:02:26.736
&gt;&gt;Student: It makes the
strings stick to the bridge.

00:02:26.836 --> 00:02:27.196
&gt;&gt;Teacher: It makes...

00:02:27.196 --> 00:02:31.086
&gt;&gt;Narrator: And fifth-graders express
their creativity by composing music.

00:02:31.086 --> 00:02:32.846
&gt;&gt;Teacher: So now we need
something that repeats,

00:02:33.336 --> 00:02:36.256
a rhythm that would be here
and then it would repeat here.

00:02:36.646 --> 00:02:41.056
&gt;&gt;Joyce: Opening Minds through the
Arts really is an academic program

00:02:41.166 --> 00:02:42.606
that infuses the arts.

00:02:43.156 --> 00:02:47.636
Because we align it with the state
standards, it gives another way

00:02:47.726 --> 00:02:50.976
for the brain to connect to
what children are learning,

00:02:51.196 --> 00:02:55.326
and the more opportunities that
children have to have tactile

00:02:55.526 --> 00:03:00.406
or physical or all of those
responses that may be different

00:03:00.476 --> 00:03:08.476
than what we are used to learning
with, the better they learn.

00:03:08.926 --> 00:03:12.006
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Professional artists
from the Tucson Opera, the symphony

00:03:12.006 --> 00:03:17.226
and the University of Arizona teach
in each classroom twice a week.

00:03:17.226 --> 00:03:22.496
&gt;&gt;Kimberly: I always like to
sing things in foreign languages,

00:03:22.496 --> 00:03:28.406
so that really helps
the students to observe,

00:03:28.906 --> 00:03:32.186
and it puts the second-language
learners in the same boat

00:03:32.186 --> 00:03:33.746
as the English-speaking students,

00:03:33.746 --> 00:03:36.556
because it's in a totally different
language that no one knows.

00:03:36.556 --> 00:03:38.756
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Corbett Elementary
is a neighborhood school

00:03:38.756 --> 00:03:41.006
in a working-class section of Tucson.

00:03:41.476 --> 00:03:44.686
Twenty percent of its students
are English-language learners.

00:03:44.846 --> 00:03:47.016
&gt;&gt;Student: My house is
dirty, I have to clean it up.

00:03:47.016 --> 00:03:47.083
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Yeah.

00:03:47.083 --> 00:03:47.706
"Oh, no, my house is dirty."

00:03:47.906 --> 00:03:49.966
&gt;&gt;Joyce: One of the things
that the OMA program does,

00:03:50.226 --> 00:03:54.096
especially for our English-language
learners, is provide them

00:03:54.366 --> 00:03:57.466
with a art form that's
connected to learning in a way

00:03:57.466 --> 00:04:00.096
that they can connect, no
matter what language they speak.

00:04:00.096 --> 00:04:01.546
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Does anybody
know what this is called

00:04:01.546 --> 00:04:04.496
when we kind of speak-sing like this?

00:04:04.496 --> 00:04:07.016
What do we call that in the opera?

00:04:07.016 --> 00:04:07.946
Recitative.

00:04:07.946 --> 00:04:09.686
Everybody say "recitative."

00:04:09.766 --> 00:04:11.566
&gt;&gt;Class: Recitative.

00:04:11.566 --> 00:04:12.796
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Get used to it,
because this is how we're going

00:04:12.796 --> 00:04:16.316
to compose music when
you write your own opera.

00:04:16.316 --> 00:04:17.026
Isn't that exciting?

00:04:17.026 --> 00:04:19.186
&gt;&gt;Rachel: Professional artists
come in and they just have a wealth

00:04:19.416 --> 00:04:23.356
of knowledge, but not only do
these artists have a firm grasp

00:04:23.356 --> 00:04:26.236
on their art form but they're able
to come in and create lesson plans

00:04:26.286 --> 00:04:30.386
that teach these things to students
while also integrating things

00:04:30.416 --> 00:04:33.396
like language skills and
just 21st-century skills.

00:04:33.556 --> 00:04:36.156
&gt;&gt;Student: We learned a lot of
things about opera like subtext

00:04:36.496 --> 00:04:38.776
and how terms of opera are used,

00:04:38.776 --> 00:04:43.176
and you get to use
your imagination a lot.

00:04:43.176 --> 00:04:44.956
&gt;&gt;Student: Nice bow in your hair.

00:04:45.286 --> 00:04:48.856
&gt;&gt;Student: It's a really good
way of learning, because usually

00:04:48.856 --> 00:04:51.836
when you learn you just read it out
of the textbooks, but when you act

00:04:51.836 --> 00:04:55.686
out stuff and talk about stuff,
it really helps you learn better.

00:04:55.686 --> 00:04:56.626
&gt;&gt;Student: Don't be late.

00:04:56.756 --> 00:04:57.106
&gt;&gt;Teacher: I won't.

00:04:57.106 --> 00:04:57.636
&gt;&gt;Student: I won't.

00:04:57.836 --> 00:05:02.006
&gt;&gt;Teacher: So then you rush off
and you say, "Good job, dude."

00:05:02.476 --> 00:05:03.686
&gt;&gt;Kimberly: They want
the story to be based

00:05:03.686 --> 00:05:05.406
around some theme from
the curriculum.

00:05:05.406 --> 00:05:06.786
We were thinking social
studies might be the best way

00:05:06.786 --> 00:05:07.716
to go so that we don't...

00:05:07.716 --> 00:05:10.166
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Artists work
closely with classroom teachers

00:05:10.166 --> 00:05:11.766
to plan a semester's curriculum.

00:05:11.766 --> 00:05:14.746
&gt;&gt;Teacher: So my class would be
the acts that took place prior

00:05:14.746 --> 00:05:18.606
to the Revolutionary War, so
I don't know how that would...

00:05:19.036 --> 00:05:20.366
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Just tell us
what you want them to know

00:05:20.366 --> 00:05:22.506
about them and we'll figure it out.

00:05:22.936 --> 00:05:25.876
&gt;&gt;Narrator: And the school's
full-time arts-integration specialist

00:05:26.086 --> 00:05:29.226
helps teachers reach specific
performance objectives.

00:05:29.576 --> 00:05:32.256
&gt;&gt;Rachel: And we've
completed our poetry on that,

00:05:32.256 --> 00:05:34.256
so this unit's kind of done.

00:05:34.306 --> 00:05:37.166
&gt;&gt;Evelyn: Boys and girls, can you
say good morning to Mr. Jones?

00:05:37.256 --> 00:05:41.786
&gt;&gt;Class: Good morning, Mr. Jones.

00:05:42.056 --> 00:05:45.126
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Ninety-three-year-old
former businessman Gene Jones

00:05:45.126 --> 00:05:49.746
initiated the OMA program by funding
a pilot project in the year 2000.

00:05:49.966 --> 00:05:54.106
&gt;&gt;Gene: So we started out seven
years ago with three schools.

00:05:54.556 --> 00:05:59.326
We're up to 20,000 kids a day
that are impacted by the program.

00:05:59.726 --> 00:06:05.066
It's a tremendous team effort, and
to see the effects of it on the kids,

00:06:05.066 --> 00:06:09.286
enthusiasm that they have, is
just -- it's very thrilling to me.

00:06:09.706 --> 00:06:11.166
&gt;&gt;Nathan: You'll never
believe what happened today.

00:06:11.396 --> 00:06:14.496
The queen of the night, she didn't
keep her promise, and now...

00:06:14.496 --> 00:06:17.276
&gt;&gt;Evelyn: We've been working on
this opera for about a month,

00:06:18.576 --> 00:06:21.566
and we've been describing
the emotions

00:06:21.566 --> 00:06:23.636
that these characters are feeling.

00:06:24.276 --> 00:06:27.176
&gt;&gt;Student: Why are you
so disappointed, man?

00:06:27.176 --> 00:06:31.056
&gt;&gt;Student: Because the queen of the
night didn't -- broke her promise.

00:06:31.346 --> 00:06:34.316
&gt;&gt;Nathan: You see a great increase of
their vocabulary from the beginning

00:06:34.316 --> 00:06:38.106
to the end, and since we write
their own operas at the end

00:06:38.106 --> 00:06:40.836
of the school year, they
are coming up with ideas,

00:06:40.836 --> 00:06:42.556
so you hear it coming
right out of their mouths.

00:06:43.026 --> 00:06:47.416
&gt;&gt;Student: Then they
buy new wedding rings.

00:06:48.266 --> 00:06:50.486
&gt;&gt;Student: Next they
go in an airplane.

00:06:51.016 --> 00:06:54.946
&gt;&gt;Evelyn: At the first quarter I
had over half my class not be able

00:06:54.946 --> 00:06:59.896
to write a word, and since
we've been doing this regularly,

00:07:00.226 --> 00:07:02.616
I have sentences on papers now.

00:07:02.616 --> 00:07:04.656
I have punctuation.

00:07:04.796 --> 00:07:10.616
I have not just one sentence; I
have maybe three, four sentences.

00:07:10.616 --> 00:07:12.096
I am so amazed.

00:07:12.796 --> 00:07:13.396
It works.

00:07:13.666 --> 00:07:16.786
&gt;&gt;Narrator: And independent
research confirms that reading,

00:07:16.786 --> 00:07:19.936
writing and math test scores
have dramatically improved.

00:07:20.126 --> 00:07:24.216
&gt;&gt;Class: [singing] The colon
says it be a list or a quotation.

00:07:24.266 --> 00:07:27.106
The punctuation song.

00:07:29.326 --> 00:07:33.536
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Academics aside, the
kids and adults of Corbett believe

00:07:33.606 --> 00:07:36.116
that the arts make this
a better place to be.

00:07:36.396 --> 00:07:39.796
&gt;&gt;Student: I like when
the people go up on stage

00:07:39.796 --> 00:07:41.236
and they act and they sing.

00:07:41.566 --> 00:07:43.426
&gt;&gt;Student: They teach
you how to do dialogue.

00:07:43.746 --> 00:07:44.936
&gt;&gt;Student: You get
to express yourself.

00:07:45.436 --> 00:07:46.966
&gt;&gt;Student: It really
helped me how to write.

00:07:47.546 --> 00:07:50.136
&gt;&gt;Student: There's a lot of
acting, which I really like doing.

00:07:50.246 --> 00:07:51.976
&gt;&gt;Student: It's kind of fun.

00:07:52.516 --> 00:07:56.866
&gt;&gt;Class: [sings]

00:07:57.366 --> 00:07:58.646
&gt;&gt;Joyce: I get tears in my eyes

00:07:59.206 --> 00:08:04.486
when I see children laughing,
enjoying their learning.

00:08:04.486 --> 00:08:10.496
No matter what cultural background,
they can connect with the OMA program

00:08:10.856 --> 00:08:14.826
and improve their academics,
which is a very exciting thing.

00:08:15.516 --> 00:08:19.656
&gt;&gt;Class: [sings]

00:08:20.156 --> 00:08:20.306
&gt;&gt;Nathan: Bravi.

00:08:20.406 --> 00:08:23.146
