this room to make our machines and we
 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.240
this room to make our machines and we
can use this room too and or plumbing

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250
can use this room too and or plumbing
 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.470
can use this room too and or plumbing
and we could you know we can survive

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480
and we could you know we can survive
 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.100
and we could you know we can survive
here so that was very interesting and

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110
here so that was very interesting and
 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.860
here so that was very interesting and
Aang is looking at this temple just

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870
Aang is looking at this temple just
 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.510
Aang is looking at this temple just
shaking his head like that this was a

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520
shaking his head like that this was a
 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.660
shaking his head like that this was a
sacred place but he's also dealing with

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670
sacred place but he's also dealing with
 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.150
sacred place but he's also dealing with
the idea well but these people need to

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160
the idea well but these people need to
 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.030
the idea well but these people need to
survive and they are doing good well for

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040
survive and they are doing good well for
 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.080
survive and they are doing good well for
the most part of what we'll get to a

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090
the most part of what we'll get to a
 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.700
the most part of what we'll get to a
second um and they are very much trying

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:16.710
second um and they are very much trying
 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.580
second um and they are very much trying

know there's there's a kid who he can't
use his legs but they create a glider

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020
use his legs but they create a glider
 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.690
use his legs but they create a glider
where he can fly through the skies

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700
where he can fly through the skies
 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.840
where he can fly through the skies
that's why it's unbelievable um and the

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850
that's why it's unbelievable um and the
 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.250
that's why it's unbelievable um and the

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.470
the inventor Rene Ohno from deep space 9
is the guy who makes most of this stuff

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480
is the guy who makes most of this stuff
 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.710
is the guy who makes most of this stuff
and he's a very nice guy and and he's
