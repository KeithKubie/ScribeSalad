00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:19.200
another project that I thought was just
 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.350
another project that I thought was just
outstanding was a pure air project and

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:21.360
outstanding was a pure air project and
 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.510
outstanding was a pure air project and
the reason is because the kinds of solar

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:23.520
the reason is because the kinds of solar
 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.070
the reason is because the kinds of solar
power that you need the level of energy

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080
power that you need the level of energy
 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.420

relatively low and you know solar panels

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640
relatively low and you know solar panels
 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.010

accessories they're really not bad for

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770
accessories they're really not bad for
 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.800
accessories they're really not bad for
powering small things like a fan the

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:39.810
powering small things like a fan the
 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:41.600
powering small things like a fan the
same time more and more reports are

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610
same time more and more reports are
 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.220
same time more and more reports are
coming out about ultrafine particles and

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230
coming out about ultrafine particles and
 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.050
coming out about ultrafine particles and
how ultrafine particles especially for

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:45.060
how ultrafine particles especially for
 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.670

cooking when they lodging themselves
 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.010
cooking when they lodging themselves
deep in your lungs they are what cause

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020
deep in your lungs they are what cause
 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.290
deep in your lungs they are what cause
asthma long-term and so literally people

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300
asthma long-term and so literally people
 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.299
asthma long-term and so literally people
at home cooking with let's say frying

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309
at home cooking with let's say frying
 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.549
at home cooking with let's say frying
and chicken they do that ultrafine

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559
and chicken they do that ultrafine
 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:56.990
and chicken they do that ultrafine
particles at least in the air they stay

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000
particles at least in the air they stay
 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
particles at least in the air they stay
tuned four five six hours even if you'll

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010
tuned four five six hours even if you'll
 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.020
tuned four five six hours even if you'll
be a winner if it takes five or six

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030
be a winner if it takes five or six
 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.090
be a winner if it takes five or six
hours because the particles to sell down

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100
hours because the particles to sell down
 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.650
hours because the particles to sell down
so for those five or six hours your kids

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660
so for those five or six hours your kids
 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.780
so for those five or six hours your kids
are breathing air that's literally

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790
are breathing air that's literally
 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.490
are breathing air that's literally
putting ultrafine particles deep in

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500
putting ultrafine particles deep in
 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.950
putting ultrafine particles deep in
their lungs and so this idea that you

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960
their lungs and so this idea that you
 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.990
their lungs and so this idea that you
take really simple the exciting modern

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000
take really simple the exciting modern
 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.370
take really simple the exciting modern
technology like solar power and simple

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380
technology like solar power and simple
 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.190
technology like solar power and simple
van and add that to a cooking system so

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200
van and add that to a cooking system so
 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.899
van and add that to a cooking system so
that the air can stay cleaner to me

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:18.909
that the air can stay cleaner to me
 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:21.060
that the air can stay cleaner to me
that's fantastic what's more we can test

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070
that's fantastic what's more we can test
 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.010
that's fantastic what's more we can test
it so that's exciting because we can

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020
it so that's exciting because we can
 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.660
it so that's exciting because we can
actually quantitatively tell are we

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670
actually quantitatively tell are we
 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.639
actually quantitatively tell are we
making a real difference is there enough

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:26.649
making a real difference is there enough
 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:28.139
making a real difference is there enough
of a difference to affect the health of

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:28.149
of a difference to affect the health of
 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:29.669
of a difference to affect the health of
the kids who happen to be sleeping

00:01:29.669 --> 00:01:29.679
the kids who happen to be sleeping
 

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:32.460
the kids who happen to be sleeping
living in that test
