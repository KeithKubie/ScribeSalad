00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:02.335
This youngster was banned
from performing

00:00:02.335 --> 00:00:03.669
at his
first grade talent show

00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:05.638
because his act was deemed
too inappropriate.

00:00:05.638 --> 00:00:09.175
Now as a fellow artist
I will not stand for censorship.

00:00:09.175 --> 00:00:11.777
So making his television
debut. Please welcome Eric.

00:00:12.211 --> 00:00:14.347
Thanks Mr. Tosh here's my
talent.

00:01:06.065 --> 00:01:07.767
Is that real?

00:01:07.767 --> 00:01:09.235
Oh!

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:12.972
How is that even possible?

00:01:12.972 --> 00:01:13.038
Jesus.

00:01:14.073 --> 00:01:15.374
Smell it.

00:01:15.374 --> 00:01:17.176
I can't believe you farted like
that. How?

00:01:17.176 --> 00:01:20.613
Get this girl a show
on Comedy Central now.

00:01:20.613 --> 00:01:23.216
I think we finally solve
the riddle

00:01:23.216 --> 00:01:28.121
of why hospital gowns
are open in the back.

00:01:30.056 --> 00:01:32.325
Quick! Pull the covers
over your wife's head.

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:40.600
I'm dreaming
of a weighty tidy Christmas.

00:01:41.868 --> 00:01:43.803
At least fart in them with
care.

00:01:45.471 --> 00:01:47.273
I'm guessing
too much fruitcake.

00:01:51.511 --> 00:01:53.546
Wake up!

00:02:00.586 --> 00:02:02.988
Unfortunately we can
only save your mustache

00:02:02.988 --> 00:02:04.257
and your butthole.

00:02:04.257 --> 00:02:06.459
Paul Flart is dead.
From this day on you

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:08.361
will simply be known
as Roboflart.

00:02:08.928 --> 00:02:12.232
A lean mean ass-rippin' machine.

00:02:13.166 --> 00:02:14.867
Well, not that lean.

00:02:15.902 --> 00:02:17.604
It'll take you a while
to get used to it.

00:02:28.247 --> 00:02:29.949
That's an unarmed black man.

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:32.484
You're gonna make
one hell of a cop.

00:02:32.484 --> 00:02:34.687
I'll just say
he was holding a knife.

00:02:36.822 --> 00:02:38.625
You have the right
to remain silent.

00:02:39.525 --> 00:02:41.861
But deadly.

00:02:41.861 --> 00:02:44.197
Might want to
change his name to Roboshart.

00:02:45.864 --> 00:02:48.267
He didn't deserve to get
thrown under the fart bus

00:02:48.267 --> 00:02:50.336
so we brought him out to L.A.
to clear the air.

00:02:50.336 --> 00:02:52.038
In this week's Web redemption.

00:03:02.014 --> 00:03:03.682
That is not
what it looked like.

00:03:03.682 --> 00:03:05.652
I just enjoy spanking
kids with a paddle.

00:03:05.652 --> 00:03:06.753
Now get in here fartsy.
