00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.060
now an actual fact we haven't discovered

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070
now an actual fact we haven't discovered
 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.039
now an actual fact we haven't discovered
a huge amount about obesity genes at the

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049
a huge amount about obesity genes at the
 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.740
a huge amount about obesity genes at the
moment but you know they're almost

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750
moment but you know they're almost
 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.960
moment but you know they're almost
certainly years and we know that there

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970
certainly years and we know that there
 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.120
certainly years and we know that there
are genes involved in the development of

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130
are genes involved in the development of
 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.310
are genes involved in the development of
predisposition to diabetes and so on and

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320
predisposition to diabetes and so on and
 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.560
predisposition to diabetes and so on and
we know that diabetes is going to become

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570
we know that diabetes is going to become
 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.140
we know that diabetes is going to become
a massive problem over the next set of

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150
a massive problem over the next set of
 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.839
a massive problem over the next set of
20 to 30 years ago estimates in the

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849
20 to 30 years ago estimates in the
 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.550
20 to 30 years ago estimates in the
range of 400 million people with

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560
range of 400 million people with
 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.200
range of 400 million people with
diabetes by 2030 around the world and

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210
diabetes by 2030 around the world and
 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.400
diabetes by 2030 around the world and
what were what we would like to

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410
what were what we would like to
 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.750
what were what we would like to
understand is how does your genetic

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760
understand is how does your genetic
 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.569
understand is how does your genetic
predisposition interact with your

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579
predisposition interact with your
 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.569
predisposition interact with your
environmental predisposition to you know

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579
environmental predisposition to you know
 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.130
environmental predisposition to you know
culture what what kind of foods that you

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140
culture what what kind of foods that you
 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.490
culture what what kind of foods that you
eat you know etc etc and that's the

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500
eat you know etc etc and that's the
 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.490
eat you know etc etc and that's the
piece that we want to try and you know

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500
piece that we want to try and you know
 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.110
piece that we want to try and you know
understand and sort of tease apart and

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120
understand and sort of tease apart and
 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.720
understand and sort of tease apart and
what for diabetics what does that mean

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730
what for diabetics what does that mean
 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.279
what for diabetics what does that mean
in terms of your likelihood of getting

00:01:04.279 --> 00:01:04.289
in terms of your likelihood of getting
 

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:07.010
in terms of your likelihood of getting
cardiovascular disease and so on so I

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020
cardiovascular disease and so on so I
 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.719
cardiovascular disease and so on so I
think those are the areas in which is

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729
think those are the areas in which is
 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.160
think those are the areas in which is
going to be a lot of work to try and

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170
going to be a lot of work to try and
 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.650
going to be a lot of work to try and
sort of understand the differences in

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:12.660
sort of understand the differences in
 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.139
sort of understand the differences in
populations and the differences in rates

00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:15.149
populations and the differences in rates
 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:17.120
populations and the differences in rates
of obesity between different populations

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130
of obesity between different populations
 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.279
of obesity between different populations
how much of that is genetic how much of

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:19.289
how much of that is genetic how much of
 

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:21.469
how much of that is genetic how much of
it is environment and what can one do

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479
it is environment and what can one do
 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.199
it is environment and what can one do
together to get around the other so what

00:01:24.199 --> 00:01:24.209
together to get around the other so what
 

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:28.130
together to get around the other so what
kind of lifestyle changes can you make

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140
kind of lifestyle changes can you make
 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.900
kind of lifestyle changes can you make
to get around your genetic

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:29.910
to get around your genetic
 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:31.790
to get around your genetic
predisposition to get developing obesity

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.800
predisposition to get developing obesity
 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.300
predisposition to get developing obesity
and and also what kind of behavioral

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310
and and also what kind of behavioral
 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.580
and and also what kind of behavioral
components might make it difficult or

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590
components might make it difficult or
 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.830
components might make it difficult or
easy for you to do that you know because

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840
easy for you to do that you know because
 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.389
easy for you to do that you know because
it's often very difficult for people to

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:41.399
it's often very difficult for people to
 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:43.460
it's often very difficult for people to
change their lifestyle and that's where

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470
change their lifestyle and that's where
 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.900
change their lifestyle and that's where
that's where it's often the big

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:44.910
that's where it's often the big
 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:46.910
that's where it's often the big
challenge so we all know what we're

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920
challenge so we all know what we're
 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.559
challenge so we all know what we're
supposed to do in order to keep healthy

00:01:48.559 --> 00:01:48.569
supposed to do in order to keep healthy
 

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:50.419
supposed to do in order to keep healthy
most of the time but it's difficult to

00:01:50.419 --> 00:01:50.429
most of the time but it's difficult to
 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:55.190
most of the time but it's difficult to
do

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200
 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.259
you
