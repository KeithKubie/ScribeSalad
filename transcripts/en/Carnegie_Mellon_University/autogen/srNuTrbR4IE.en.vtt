it means to have a creative environment

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620
it means to have a creative environment
 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.730
it means to have a creative environment
and it's one of the things I remember

about the environment that is the
 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.820
about the environment that is the
creative environment I think that when

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:57.830
creative environment I think that when
 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.520
creative environment I think that when
it comes to creativity that the tentacle

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530
it comes to creativity that the tentacle
 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.010

people and the artists are actually the

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:03.020
people and the artists are actually the
 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.200
people and the artists are actually the
same they're both involved in creative

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210
same they're both involved in creative
 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.390
same they're both involved in creative
activities the fact that it's art of

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400
activities the fact that it's art of
 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.520

technology doesn't matter when you put

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530
technology doesn't matter when you put

them together there's a multiplication

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960
them together there's a multiplication
 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.440
them together there's a multiplication
effect that takes place the whole is

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450
effect that takes place the whole is
 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.139
effect that takes place the whole is
really much greater than the sum of the

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:17.149
really much greater than the sum of the
 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:19.989
really much greater than the sum of the
parts and there's something about that

00:01:19.989 --> 00:01:19.999
parts and there's something about that
 

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:23.109
parts and there's something about that
inspiration that takes place in fact the

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119
inspiration that takes place in fact the
 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:26.289
inspiration that takes place in fact the
term we use is that art inspires

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299
term we use is that art inspires
 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:29.469

technology and technology inspires the

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479
technology and technology inspires the
 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.020
technology and technology inspires the
art and when they're working close

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030
art and when they're working close
 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.450
art and when they're working close
collaboration both of them grow as a

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460
collaboration both of them grow as a
 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.910
collaboration both of them grow as a
result of it and they grow in surprising

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920
result of it and they grow in surprising
 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.739
result of it and they grow in surprising
ways and you can't even predict it it's

00:01:38.739 --> 00:01:38.749
ways and you can't even predict it it's
 

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:42.989
ways and you can't even predict it it's
clear to me that CMU has this unique

00:01:42.989 --> 00:01:42.999
clear to me that CMU has this unique
 

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:46.599
clear to me that CMU has this unique
combination of the best in computer

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:46.609
combination of the best in computer
 

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:48.099
combination of the best in computer
science the best in computer graphics

00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:48.109
science the best in computer graphics
 

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:50.739
science the best in computer graphics
the best in entertainment technology the

00:01:50.739 --> 00:01:50.749
the best in entertainment technology the
 

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:53.980
the best in entertainment technology the
best in robotics there isn't any other

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990
best in robotics there isn't any other
 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.510

place where they've got that combination

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520
place where they've got that combination
 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.899

together and students interacting with

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909
together and students interacting with
 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:01.840
together and students interacting with
each other and the result of that is

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850
each other and the result of that is
 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.440
each other and the result of that is
this dynamic that creates a new kind of

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450
this dynamic that creates a new kind of
 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.809
this dynamic that creates a new kind of
person that's that's in a position to

00:02:07.809 --> 00:02:07.819
person that's that's in a position to
 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:10.090
person that's that's in a position to
address the unpredictable things that

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100
address the unpredictable things that
 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.920
address the unpredictable things that
are coming there imprintable because

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930
are coming there imprintable because
 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.860
are coming there imprintable because
they make them happen
