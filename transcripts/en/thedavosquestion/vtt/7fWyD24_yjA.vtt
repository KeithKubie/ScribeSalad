NGOZI: Hi you tube. My name is Ngozi Okonjo-Iwela.
I'm Managing Director of the World Bank. I'm

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:14.079
very concerned about the impacts of the [INAUDIBLE
 - NOISE] global financial crisis on developing

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:27.750
countries. They are being hit now in several
ways. First of all[INAUDIBLE]prices natural

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:39.280
resourse products, experiencing declines in
income like cotton has fallen off, you name

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:45.230
it so many natural resources. [INAUDIBLE]
many people, [INAUDIBLE] who used to send

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:56.860
money home [INAUDIBLE]are down for many governments,
experience 40% since the last [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:04.950
in remittances, this is important. And then,
in addition, Foreign Director investments

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:12.700
is drying up. So many investments that were
going to be made by [INAUDIBLE] $350,000,000

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.690
investments in Zambia, these are no longer
going to be made. So this means that unemployment

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.460
is going to be an issue in many of the countries.
All I'm trying to say is that we have one

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.640
integrated world and what is happening in
developed countries is also impacting the

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.250
developing ones. Therefore, when we think
of stimulous packages, we need to think not

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.780
just of the developed countries, but also
how can we help the developing of low income

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:44.360
countries to have a stimulous package as well.
You must remember that these countries have

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.070
also been suffering from a food crisis. So
you have financial crisis [INAUDIBLE] and

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.890
a food crisis and we need to make sure that
1 billion people who don't have enough to

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:00.340
eat don't suffer any futher. Now the President
of the World Bank [INAUDIBLE] has suggested

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:07.890
that each developed country that has a stimulous
package devotes 0.7% of it to help developing

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.159
countries to have their own stimulous so that
demand is these countries can also be improved.

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:18.219
I think this is a good idea. I'd love to know
what you of it. Hope to hear from some of

00:02:18.219 --> 00:02:19.239
you. Thank you.
