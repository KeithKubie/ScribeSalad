00:00:07.916 --> 00:00:10.756
&gt;&gt;Teacher: What's this
simple machine right here?

00:00:11.386 --> 00:00:12.486
Wheel and axle, right.

00:00:12.486 --> 00:00:16.196
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Just outside Boston in
the diverse community of Malden,

00:00:16.196 --> 00:00:20.016
fifth graders are studying some
of America's oldest technology,

00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:21.536
using some of its newest.

00:00:21.576 --> 00:00:22.926
&gt;&gt;Teacher: All right,
watch that gate.

00:00:23.186 --> 00:00:25.506
&gt;&gt;Narrator: They're on a
field trip to the birthplace

00:00:25.716 --> 00:00:28.936
of the country's manufacturing
industry, the Saugus Iron Works.

00:00:29.596 --> 00:00:30.786
&gt;&gt;Teacher: This works like a lever.

00:00:30.786 --> 00:00:35.156
It presses the bellows closed, it
blows the air into the furnace.

00:00:35.156 --> 00:00:39.146
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Public education in
America also began in Massachusetts.

00:00:39.146 --> 00:00:43.996
In the mid-1800s, a Prussian system
was adopted that featured reading,

00:00:44.246 --> 00:00:46.126
writing and arithmetic taught

00:00:46.126 --> 00:00:48.116
in separate periods
governed by the clock.

00:00:48.116 --> 00:00:50.586
&gt;&gt;David: We don't live in an
industrial economy any more.

00:00:50.586 --> 00:00:53.306
We live in a knowledge economy, and
so we have to think about education

00:00:53.616 --> 00:00:54.876
in a fundamentally different way.

00:00:54.876 --> 00:00:58.436
We can't be focusing on
basic facts and basic skills.

00:00:58.436 --> 00:01:00.686
We have to think about ways
of thinking that are going

00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:04.186
to matter more than what we do
in traditional schools right now.

00:01:04.186 --> 00:01:05.556
&gt;&gt;Teacher: You want to
be a photo journalist?

00:01:05.966 --> 00:01:06.033
&gt;&gt;Students: Yeah!

00:01:06.616 --> 00:01:07.816
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Oh, oh, all right!

00:01:08.136 --> 00:01:10.056
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Today, many
educators are calling

00:01:10.106 --> 00:01:12.056
for an integrated approach
to teaching.

00:01:12.056 --> 00:01:13.526
&gt;&gt;Teacher: The circumference
of the circle...

00:01:13.956 --> 00:01:16.826
&gt;&gt;Narrator: At Ferryway
School, the Iron Works project,

00:01:16.826 --> 00:01:22.936
which is a collaborative effort of a
dozen teachers integrates math, art,

00:01:23.056 --> 00:01:25.496
English, history and science.

00:01:25.736 --> 00:01:26.666
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Look where
the water's falling.

00:01:27.226 --> 00:01:29.566
&gt;&gt;Narrator: And features a
handmade water wheel competition.

00:01:29.566 --> 00:01:29.906
&gt;&gt;Students: [clapping]
Go, go, go, go.

00:01:31.196 --> 00:01:32.786
&gt;&gt;Earl: The project's not
just about the water wheel,

00:01:32.786 --> 00:01:36.016
it's not just about the Saugus
Iron Works, it's about all

00:01:36.016 --> 00:01:37.876
of the subject areas
being brought together.

00:01:37.876 --> 00:01:39.046
The rocks and minerals.

00:01:39.046 --> 00:01:40.216
The simple machines.

00:01:40.476 --> 00:01:44.156
The technology concepts and they
learn leadership, they learn how

00:01:44.156 --> 00:01:45.526
to get along, how to cooperate.

00:01:45.526 --> 00:01:48.286
There's a lot of life
lessons to be learned.

00:01:48.356 --> 00:01:50.366
&gt;&gt;Student: And it looks
like shiny metal.

00:01:50.926 --> 00:01:53.086
&gt;&gt;Anxhela: If you're like
in different classes,

00:01:53.086 --> 00:01:56.746
you sometimes forget, because
your mind's on one class,

00:01:56.746 --> 00:01:59.906
and then you have to be
focused on another class.

00:02:00.036 --> 00:02:02.856
But when it's all together, you
can just focus on one thing,

00:02:03.136 --> 00:02:04.806
'cause it's all the same.

00:02:04.806 --> 00:02:07.816
&gt;&gt;Ken: These divisions between
disciplines are provisional at best,

00:02:08.016 --> 00:02:11.276
and also in schools, they
become artificially enforced.

00:02:11.836 --> 00:02:14.846
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Sir Ken Robinson is an
internationally acclaimed author

00:02:14.846 --> 00:02:17.486
and lecturer, and an
expert in creativity.

00:02:17.546 --> 00:02:19.496
&gt;&gt;Ken: There's a kind of
assumption that there's a set number

00:02:19.556 --> 00:02:20.816
of subjects in the world.

00:02:21.426 --> 00:02:23.846
And some of those are more
important than the other ones.

00:02:23.846 --> 00:02:25.876
So typically, you end up
with this hierarchy of math

00:02:25.876 --> 00:02:28.356
and languages and science at the top.

00:02:28.356 --> 00:02:29.346
And they are very important.

00:02:29.796 --> 00:02:32.056
But they're not more
important in my view

00:02:32.106 --> 00:02:33.426
than the arts and the humanities.

00:02:33.426 --> 00:02:35.266
So that's the first thing,
you've got the hierarchy.

00:02:35.266 --> 00:02:36.986
The second thing is,
these things tend

00:02:36.986 --> 00:02:38.496
to be hermetically sealed
off from each other.

00:02:38.606 --> 00:02:40.276
You know, so you do science
on a Thursday morning.

00:02:40.276 --> 00:02:42.006
You do math in the afternoons.

00:02:42.886 --> 00:02:45.616
And this is really a feature
of education, because outside

00:02:45.616 --> 00:02:48.256
of education, people know
naturally that all these things flow

00:02:48.256 --> 00:02:49.366
in and out of each other.

00:02:49.366 --> 00:02:51.466
You know, that disciplines
affect each other.

00:02:51.466 --> 00:02:53.486
&gt;&gt;Karen: So you want to
put your GPSs up this way.

00:02:53.486 --> 00:02:54.416
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Across the country,

00:02:54.416 --> 00:02:57.436
imaginative teachers make
learning richer and deeper

00:02:57.436 --> 00:02:59.796
by connecting subjects
through projects.

00:02:59.926 --> 00:03:02.026
&gt;&gt;Karen: We want you to
write down that latitude

00:03:02.026 --> 00:03:03.276
and longitude on your paper.

00:03:03.606 --> 00:03:06.006
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In the Eastern
Washington town of Waterville,

00:03:06.006 --> 00:03:08.176
local farmers team up
with fourth graders

00:03:08.216 --> 00:03:11.326
to track tiny horny-toad
lizards as part

00:03:11.326 --> 00:03:13.726
of a national program
called Nature Mapping.

00:03:13.726 --> 00:03:15.656
&gt;&gt;Karen: And we don't know
what the horny-toads do.

00:03:15.756 --> 00:03:17.966
We don't understand what
they do during the winter.

00:03:18.436 --> 00:03:20.976
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Teachers and experts
designed an interdisciplinary

00:03:20.976 --> 00:03:22.886
curriculum for the year-long project.

00:03:22.886 --> 00:03:25.526
&gt;&gt;Karen: And when I saw what
the kids were supposed to do

00:03:25.526 --> 00:03:28.236
at different age levels,
I said, "Oh, we have math.

00:03:28.236 --> 00:03:29.316
We have science.

00:03:29.316 --> 00:03:32.206
We have technology, we have art.

00:03:32.866 --> 00:03:34.116
We have all these components."

00:03:34.336 --> 00:03:39.246
&gt;&gt;Student: How to catch a horny-toad.

00:03:39.636 --> 00:03:42.446
The first thing you have
to have is a good eye.

00:03:43.066 --> 00:03:45.836
&gt;&gt;Narrator: At Landry Middle
School, just outside New Orleans,

00:03:46.096 --> 00:03:49.966
the eighth-grade teaching team built
an interdisciplinary unit around one

00:03:49.966 --> 00:03:52.646
of their students'
favorite subjects, cars.

00:03:52.646 --> 00:03:53.506
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Oh, it curves!

00:03:53.746 --> 00:03:54.706
Look at that!

00:03:54.926 --> 00:03:58.496
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In science class,
students made balloon-propelled cars

00:03:58.496 --> 00:04:02.886
out of recycled materials, and
road tested their various designs.

00:04:03.256 --> 00:04:06.436
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Try to write some
different selling points.

00:04:06.876 --> 00:04:09.416
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In English,
students wrote car commercials.

00:04:09.596 --> 00:04:12.416
And in math, they calculated
loan payments.

00:04:12.596 --> 00:04:13.726
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Now six percent

00:04:14.256 --> 00:04:16.756
of whatever you get
for item number seven.

00:04:16.786 --> 00:04:18.536
&gt;&gt;Student: So multiply six percent...

00:04:18.536 --> 00:04:19.066
&gt;&gt;Teacher: ...times that.

00:04:19.146 --> 00:04:19.376
&gt;&gt;Student: Okay.

00:04:20.046 --> 00:04:22.026
&gt;&gt;Linda: I've had kids come
back to me and tell me,

00:04:22.026 --> 00:04:23.536
"Do you remember that
project we did?"

00:04:24.066 --> 00:04:25.966
They have never, ever
come back and said,

00:04:25.966 --> 00:04:27.336
"You remember that test we did?"

00:04:28.116 --> 00:04:30.386
So I think that's the impact.

00:04:30.386 --> 00:04:34.846
If the kids remember it, our scores
will go up, and our test scores have.

00:04:34.846 --> 00:04:35.456
&gt;&gt;Student: Good afternoon.

00:04:35.456 --> 00:04:38.496
Welcome to the culminating
event of "Fading Footprints."

00:04:38.616 --> 00:04:42.486
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In some schools, like
King Middle School in Portland,

00:04:42.746 --> 00:04:46.176
Maine, interdisciplinary learning
drives the entire curriculum,

00:04:46.646 --> 00:04:49.586
drawing on knowledge gained
in several different classes,

00:04:49.736 --> 00:04:52.156
seventh graders here
produced a CD-ROM

00:04:52.396 --> 00:04:54.496
that features Maine's
endangered species.

00:04:55.496 --> 00:04:57.276
&gt;&gt;Teacher: The model that we
use is expeditionary learning,

00:04:57.466 --> 00:04:58.206
outward bound.

00:04:58.436 --> 00:05:01.736
So it's really, it focuses
on hands-on learning.

00:05:01.996 --> 00:05:04.936
We try to integrate science,
social studies, math and English

00:05:05.346 --> 00:05:07.846
with technology, with artwork,

00:05:07.846 --> 00:05:10.456
with community members,
field work, etcetera.

00:05:11.116 --> 00:05:13.666
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In the process of
making the CDs, students learn

00:05:13.666 --> 00:05:19.786
to collaborate and contribute
their various talents.

00:05:19.786 --> 00:05:22.636
In music class, they recorded
soundtracks for the CD;

00:05:23.426 --> 00:05:26.566
in art they painted
scientifically accurate watercolors

00:05:26.566 --> 00:05:27.296
of their animals.

00:05:27.296 --> 00:05:29.446
&gt;&gt;Student: Everybody talks
about field work, and...

00:05:29.446 --> 00:05:32.586
&gt;&gt;Narrator: And in video production
class, they made the movie

00:05:32.586 --> 00:05:34.496
about the making of the CD.

00:05:34.556 --> 00:05:37.926
&gt;&gt;Student: On our winter walk,
we learned about how animals

00:05:37.926 --> 00:05:40.506
and plants survive in
Maine's harsh climate.

00:05:40.606 --> 00:05:43.016
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Since implementing
the interdisciplinary curriculum,

00:05:43.176 --> 00:05:46.316
King principal, Mike McCarthy
has seen the test scores

00:05:46.316 --> 00:05:49.966
of King's diverse student body
go from the bottom one-third,

00:05:50.226 --> 00:05:52.436
to the top one-third in the state.

00:05:53.086 --> 00:05:55.406
&gt;&gt;Michael: I've heard people
describe what a gifted

00:05:55.406 --> 00:05:57.076
and talented classroom
would look like.

00:05:57.466 --> 00:06:00.716
It should include field experiences,
it should include technology;

00:06:00.716 --> 00:06:04.336
it should independent work; it
should include work that's in-depth.

00:06:04.816 --> 00:06:06.156
Well, that's basically
what our school is.

00:06:06.156 --> 00:06:10.376
One of the kids said, "Nobody
feels stupid around here anymore."

00:06:10.546 --> 00:06:13.856
And I think that was one of
our highest achievements.

00:06:13.856 --> 00:06:15.156
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Open up,
find "Wild Ginger."

00:06:15.156 --> 00:06:16.936
It's on page 59.

00:06:17.316 --> 00:06:17.796
&gt;&gt;Narrator: At the School

00:06:17.796 --> 00:06:20.956
of Environmental Studies
just outside Minneapolis,

00:06:20.956 --> 00:06:24.786
nature provides the context for the
school's interdisciplinary approach

00:06:24.786 --> 00:06:26.956
to learning in service
to the community.

00:06:27.596 --> 00:06:29.206
&gt;&gt;Dan: We work with
the local communities.

00:06:29.206 --> 00:06:31.086
We have 20 ponds and lakes

00:06:31.086 --> 00:06:34.016
that we are monitoring every
year since we've been open.

00:06:34.196 --> 00:06:37.566
And so the kids go out and do a
chemical analysis of the water.

00:06:38.506 --> 00:06:40.926
They also will write
a technical paper.

00:06:41.366 --> 00:06:42.886
And then they present their findings

00:06:42.886 --> 00:06:44.826
to the water commissioners
from the local cities.

00:06:44.966 --> 00:06:48.126
And those people actually
will be the student work.

00:06:48.126 --> 00:06:49.476
&gt;&gt;Student: Could use
one more, I think.

00:06:49.476 --> 00:06:50.056
&gt;&gt;Student: We need one more.

00:06:50.056 --> 00:06:50.316
&gt;&gt;Student: Yeah.

00:06:51.276 --> 00:06:54.436
&gt;&gt;Mark: When you go to a normal
high school you get biology

00:06:54.436 --> 00:06:59.426
and earth science and English,
and then here you get just world,

00:06:59.526 --> 00:07:01.486
you get everything,
and it's all together.

00:07:01.486 --> 00:07:03.946
And you realize that it's all
systemic, and it all connects.

00:07:04.306 --> 00:07:06.796
And you leave here, you
know, with real value.

00:07:07.006 --> 00:07:09.076
&gt;&gt;Teacher: So that would be one
of the predators of the pond.

00:07:09.356 --> 00:07:11.196
&gt;&gt;Amanda: I can't learn
from a textbook.

00:07:11.356 --> 00:07:12.936
I can't concentrate.

00:07:12.936 --> 00:07:15.996
I don't have the ability
to concentrate like that.

00:07:15.996 --> 00:07:19.546
And here, with the hands-on
activities that we do,

00:07:19.546 --> 00:07:22.576
and the integration of
everything into our daily lives,

00:07:22.916 --> 00:07:25.786
it helps me absorb the
information a lot better.

00:07:25.786 --> 00:07:27.536
&gt;&gt;Student: All right,
recreational use.

00:07:28.246 --> 00:07:30.756
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Instead of
tests in various subjects,

00:07:30.886 --> 00:07:34.846
the school judges presentations
to peers and content experts

00:07:35.236 --> 00:07:38.546
as a better way to assess the
understanding of complex subjects.

00:07:38.546 --> 00:07:41.796
&gt;&gt;Teacher: And through biological
magnification the tiger hare is then

00:07:41.796 --> 00:07:43.326
poisoned because it eats the fish.

00:07:43.396 --> 00:07:45.526
&gt;&gt;Tom: I think that
where we are is a lot

00:07:45.526 --> 00:07:48.266
like when the Wright Brothers
flew the first airplane.

00:07:48.536 --> 00:07:51.946
Imagine for a minute when the Wright
Brothers flew their first airplane,

00:07:52.566 --> 00:07:55.756
everybody running up to
them, congratulating,

00:07:55.856 --> 00:07:57.166
saying, "That's wonderful."

00:07:57.676 --> 00:08:01.986
And someone walks up and says,
"Well, that's impressive,

00:08:01.986 --> 00:08:03.836
but how is it going to
improve the railroad?"

00:08:05.146 --> 00:08:06.826
The standards for performance

00:08:06.856 --> 00:08:10.196
that we're using are
railroad performances.

00:08:10.346 --> 00:08:13.246
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Today you are
going to take the SAT-1.

00:08:13.246 --> 00:08:15.306
&gt;&gt;Tom: So we're kind of
locked in by those standards

00:08:15.306 --> 00:08:19.086
to fixing the railroad, when we need
to get busy on inventing flight.

00:08:19.086 --> 00:08:22.066
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In industries
like filmmaking and gaming

00:08:22.066 --> 00:08:24.396
where collaboration and
creativity are prized,

00:08:24.786 --> 00:08:27.176
employers are looking
for people who can fly.

00:08:27.826 --> 00:08:30.406
&gt;&gt;Randy: Education has been
a lot about accruing facts.

00:08:30.666 --> 00:08:34.076
And today, getting facts is a
lot easier than it's ever been.

00:08:34.146 --> 00:08:37.736
But doing something interesting
with those facts, it's not so much

00:08:37.736 --> 00:08:40.466
in the points themselves, but in
the relationship between them.

00:08:40.966 --> 00:08:42.746
&gt;&gt;Teacher: And you don't
have to scrap the design,

00:08:42.746 --> 00:08:44.306
'cause the design is beautiful.

00:08:44.306 --> 00:08:47.726
&gt;&gt;Randy: One of the things that comes
out of that interdisciplinary kind

00:08:48.076 --> 00:08:50.936
of learning is it forces
people to examine patterns.

00:08:51.676 --> 00:08:56.336
And the real knowledge is when you
recognize the complexity of a pattern

00:08:56.336 --> 00:08:59.286
and then can resolve it into
a simplicity that allows it

00:08:59.286 --> 00:09:01.576
to be applied to something else.

00:09:01.576 --> 00:09:06.116
That's so much of the business of
art and technology and breakthrough.

00:09:06.516 --> 00:09:08.646
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Further
breakthroughs in education will come

00:09:08.646 --> 00:09:12.236
from understanding that people
learn best by integrating bits

00:09:12.236 --> 00:09:15.916
of information, and combining them
to create something that is greater

00:09:16.216 --> 00:09:17.336
than the sum of its parts.

00:09:17.436 --> 00:09:19.976
&gt;&gt;Student: There's actually
230 endangered species.

00:09:20.426 --> 00:09:24.886
&gt;&gt;Ken: For a really innovative
creative education, you simply have

00:09:25.016 --> 00:09:26.666
to have a broad curriculum.

00:09:26.956 --> 00:09:28.826
One that includes the arts,
as well as the sciences,

00:09:28.826 --> 00:09:31.206
as well the humanities and
languages and technology.

00:09:31.406 --> 00:09:33.486
&gt;&gt;Teacher: We're going
to take the math idea

00:09:33.486 --> 00:09:37.196
of below zero and turn it into music.

00:09:37.196 --> 00:09:38.306
&gt;&gt;Ken: For there's
no doubt in my mind

00:09:38.306 --> 00:09:40.866
that a really creative
school encourages all kinds

00:09:40.866 --> 00:09:41.906
of interaction between subjects.

00:09:41.906 --> 00:09:42.736
There's just no doubt about that.

00:09:43.116 --> 00:09:46.616
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Oh, I see some really
wonderful positive negatives,

00:09:46.616 --> 00:09:48.296
just like those math numbers.

00:09:48.696 --> 00:09:49.286
Great!

00:09:49.406 --> 00:09:52.956
