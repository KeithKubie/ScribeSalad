00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.549
- Elizabeth Grigsby, many of you know Liz.

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.966
Liz is a client, and advocate

00:00:18.148 --> 00:00:21.732
for the Golden Gate Regional Center.

00:00:21.732 --> 00:00:24.471
Liz has spoken at the
conference many times

00:00:24.471 --> 00:00:28.588
and she is going to introduce
the Shriver Award winner,

00:00:28.588 --> 00:00:31.419
Amy Restling, who is
gonna accept the award

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:34.336
on behalf of the ARCA organization,

00:00:35.485 --> 00:00:39.652
which is the California
Association of Regional Centers,

00:00:40.924 --> 00:00:41.760
I think I said that right.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.172
Yes, okay, good.

00:00:43.172 --> 00:00:46.297
Each year we award an
organization or a group

00:00:46.297 --> 00:00:51.033
who's made a considerable
contribution to improving

00:00:51.033 --> 00:00:53.265
the health and the lives of people

00:00:53.265 --> 00:00:55.771
with developmental
disabilities in California

00:00:55.771 --> 00:00:59.950
and there's no better
organization than ARCA

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.902
to actually receive the award this year

00:01:01.902 --> 00:01:03.961
and I think we started
the conference hearing

00:01:03.961 --> 00:01:06.569
about the history of the Lanterman Act

00:01:06.569 --> 00:01:08.810
and the history of the Regional Centers

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.104
and it's really our
pleasure to acknowledge

00:01:11.104 --> 00:01:15.175
their incredible work
over the last 50 years,

00:01:15.175 --> 00:01:16.373
has it been?

00:01:16.373 --> 00:01:19.367
Let's just give a little
round of applause for--

00:01:19.367 --> 00:01:21.617
(applause)

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.172
Want me to hold this for you?

00:01:31.172 --> 00:01:32.005
Okay.

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.963
I do not.

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:04.442
- It'll be just a second.

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:08.299
Here we are.

00:02:15.446 --> 00:02:16.863
- Sorry for that.

00:02:19.578 --> 00:02:23.161
I would to talk about
a lady, Amy Restling.

00:02:29.713 --> 00:02:33.880
Amy Restling is currently the
interim executive director

00:02:38.133 --> 00:02:42.300
of the association of Regional
Centers Agency's ARCA.

00:02:47.578 --> 00:02:51.745
She joined ARCA in 2012
and has focused on services

00:02:57.902 --> 00:03:02.069
for children at risk of
developmental disabilities,

00:03:04.191 --> 00:03:08.358
assessing health and insurance
funding for autism services

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.607
and the service system.

00:03:17.355 --> 00:03:19.438
Prior to that, she worked

00:03:20.343 --> 00:03:23.260
for ARCA California Regional Center

00:03:24.682 --> 00:03:28.015
coordinating the movement of individuals

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:33.502
with developmental
disabilities, institutional

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.321
to community.

00:03:37.321 --> 00:03:38.154
Yes!

00:03:45.976 --> 00:03:50.143
And she also worked for
Central Valley Regional Center

00:03:53.586 --> 00:03:57.669
overseeing services,
coordinating in rural Merced

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.713
and Mariposa counties.

00:04:05.364 --> 00:04:08.781
Amy also worked for Disability California

00:04:14.487 --> 00:04:18.654
advocating for individuals
with developmental disabilities

00:04:22.931 --> 00:04:24.764
in the central valley.

00:04:25.607 --> 00:04:29.774
Amy earned both her bachelor's
degree in social work

00:04:31.407 --> 00:04:34.490
and master's of public administration

00:04:35.814 --> 00:04:39.397
from California State
University in Fresno.

00:04:42.093 --> 00:04:45.926
So it's my pleasure to
introduce Amy Restling.

00:04:50.066 --> 00:04:53.733
(applause)
- Thank you Liz.

00:04:59.026 --> 00:05:01.629
- Thank you all so much for being here

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:05.891
and thank you, Liz, for
that great introduction.

00:05:05.891 --> 00:05:09.778
I really appreciate it and
I first just wanna welcome

00:05:09.778 --> 00:05:14.312
or just wanna say thank
you again, for being here

00:05:14.312 --> 00:05:18.500
and on behalf of the Association
of Regional Center Agencies

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.043
and really on behalf of
all the Regional Centers

00:05:22.043 --> 00:05:23.265
in California.

00:05:23.265 --> 00:05:25.265
Thank you for the award.

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:30.897
Today, just wanted to talk a little bit

00:05:30.897 --> 00:05:32.754
about our service system
and what makes us unique

00:05:32.754 --> 00:05:36.587
in California and where
we think we're headed.

00:05:42.031 --> 00:05:44.345
And today we'll talk
briefly about the structure

00:05:44.345 --> 00:05:47.367
and history of California's
Developmental Services System,

00:05:47.367 --> 00:05:49.658
'cause we never get tired
of talking about ourselves.

00:05:49.658 --> 00:05:52.006
(audience laughs)

00:05:52.006 --> 00:05:54.630
We'll talk about how the feds look at us

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:56.637
and we'll talk about
factors that are gonna shape

00:05:56.637 --> 00:05:59.795
our future or those that we think will.

00:05:59.795 --> 00:06:02.165
And then we will try to reserve
a few minutes at the end

00:06:02.165 --> 00:06:04.165
for question and answer.

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:08.676
What makes California's system unique?

00:06:08.676 --> 00:06:12.509
California's system is
unique because it began

00:06:13.615 --> 00:06:15.038
with families.

00:06:15.038 --> 00:06:17.635
It began with families
saying, "I want an alternative

00:06:17.635 --> 00:06:20.928
"that's different from
institutional care."

00:06:20.928 --> 00:06:24.624
In the 1960s, California
supported over 13,000 individuals

00:06:24.624 --> 00:06:27.386
with developmental
disabilities in state-run

00:06:27.386 --> 00:06:30.161
developmental centers and
there was a waiting list

00:06:30.161 --> 00:06:31.463
to get in.

00:06:31.463 --> 00:06:33.727
Families came to the legislature and said,

00:06:33.727 --> 00:06:36.310
"there has to be a better way."

00:06:37.602 --> 00:06:41.769
Through cooperation between
both republicans and democrats,

00:06:42.794 --> 00:06:45.346
the service system was developed.

00:06:45.346 --> 00:06:48.544
To this day, it remains widely supported

00:06:48.544 --> 00:06:50.294
in a bi-partisan way.

00:06:51.911 --> 00:06:54.488
At that time, federal
funding was only available

00:06:54.488 --> 00:06:57.612
for institutional care, but
California made a commitment

00:06:57.612 --> 00:07:00.378
to serve people with
developmental disabilities

00:07:00.378 --> 00:07:04.463
in community settings, even without that.

00:07:04.463 --> 00:07:05.773
Now every state in the country has

00:07:05.773 --> 00:07:09.907
a developmental services
system that is community based,

00:07:09.907 --> 00:07:14.246
but ours remains one of
the few entitlement states.

00:07:14.246 --> 00:07:16.082
Other states will tell you
they're an entitlement.

00:07:16.082 --> 00:07:18.582
We like to disagree with them.

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:23.167
And the other thing that
makes our system really unique

00:07:23.167 --> 00:07:25.670
is it's not government run.

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:29.173
It is designed to be responsive
to the individual needs

00:07:29.173 --> 00:07:32.840
of individual communities
because the state,

00:07:34.104 --> 00:07:35.562
when they were putting
the system together,

00:07:35.562 --> 00:07:38.730
came to the realization that
the needs of individuals

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:42.501
and families in this
area are very different

00:07:42.501 --> 00:07:46.327
than those of individuals
and families in Fresno.

00:07:46.327 --> 00:07:48.748
The challenges and the gaps in services

00:07:48.748 --> 00:07:50.392
are all very different.

00:07:50.392 --> 00:07:55.067
Each regional center has an
independent board of directors

00:07:55.067 --> 00:07:58.860
and 50% of that board
must be either individuals

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:01.088
with developmental disabilities
or their family members

00:08:01.088 --> 00:08:03.586
to ensure that the
system remains responsive

00:08:03.586 --> 00:08:05.586
to those who rely on it.

00:08:07.886 --> 00:08:09.218
Really, the regional center is here

00:08:09.218 --> 00:08:11.718
for three real basic purposes.

00:08:12.657 --> 00:08:14.693
To help infants and toddlers to reach

00:08:14.693 --> 00:08:16.694
their developmental potential.

00:08:16.694 --> 00:08:19.574
To help children to stay at
home with their families,

00:08:19.574 --> 00:08:20.940
because remember, this was at a time

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:24.310
when if you had a child with
a developmental disability,

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:26.542
you could either put
them on that waiting list

00:08:26.542 --> 00:08:28.833
for the developmental center,
or you could take them home

00:08:28.833 --> 00:08:31.349
and take care of them
entirely on your own,

00:08:31.349 --> 00:08:33.556
and too many families were
making the first choice

00:08:33.556 --> 00:08:35.439
out of necessity.

00:08:35.439 --> 00:08:38.006
And then the third goal of the
system is to support adults

00:08:38.006 --> 00:08:41.089
to live as independently as possible.

00:08:43.648 --> 00:08:46.648
Regional centers don't do
the day-to-day hands-on work

00:08:46.648 --> 00:08:49.147
with individuals, but they fulfill a lot

00:08:49.147 --> 00:08:50.904
of important functions.

00:08:50.904 --> 00:08:53.538
They provide intake and
eligibility to ensure

00:08:53.538 --> 00:08:57.153
that people who qualify for
services are brought in.

00:08:57.153 --> 00:09:00.059
They provide lifelong service planning.

00:09:00.059 --> 00:09:02.693
Talking about what is it that
you need and how can we help

00:09:02.693 --> 00:09:03.888
you get it?

00:09:03.888 --> 00:09:08.255
They provide clinical support,
oftentimes acting as a hub

00:09:08.255 --> 00:09:12.861
of excellence for medical
information in their communities.

00:09:12.861 --> 00:09:15.538
Regional centers were designed
to fill in gaps in services.

00:09:15.538 --> 00:09:19.077
They aren't here to take
the place of other services,

00:09:19.077 --> 00:09:22.662
but they're here to help
you access other services

00:09:22.662 --> 00:09:24.857
in your community through
things such as MediCal,

00:09:24.857 --> 00:09:27.399
in-home supportive
services, special education,

00:09:27.399 --> 00:09:28.854
and the like.

00:09:28.854 --> 00:09:31.560
And lastly, regional centers
fulfill a critical function

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:34.928
in meeting federal expectations
because while the system

00:09:34.928 --> 00:09:38.230
was started without
federal dollars, today,

00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:42.561
it relies on a tremendous
amount of federal funding.

00:09:42.561 --> 00:09:46.305
Speaking of which, you'll
see that, I wish the colors

00:09:46.305 --> 00:09:48.906
came out a little better, but that's okay.

00:09:48.906 --> 00:09:52.077
The first 40% of the funding in our system

00:09:52.077 --> 00:09:54.984
is federal dollars and so
it's essential that we meet

00:09:54.984 --> 00:09:57.602
those expectations of
the federal government

00:09:57.602 --> 00:09:59.618
and keep those dollars coming.

00:09:59.618 --> 00:10:02.928
At this time, the Regional
Center System has a total budget

00:10:02.928 --> 00:10:07.095
of 6.1 billion dollars or so,
with about 2.5 billion of that

00:10:08.912 --> 00:10:11.745
coming from federal reimbursement.

00:10:14.782 --> 00:10:15.975
Because the money, we care a lot

00:10:15.975 --> 00:10:19.975
about what the federal
government thinks, right?

00:10:21.478 --> 00:10:23.461
The way our service system is structured,

00:10:23.461 --> 00:10:26.635
and please excuse the crude flowchart.

00:10:26.635 --> 00:10:28.557
It was my first time making
one and I was super proud

00:10:28.557 --> 00:10:30.372
of it, so I stuck it on the slide.

00:10:30.372 --> 00:10:33.270
(audience laughs)

00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:36.617
But basically, service providers report

00:10:36.617 --> 00:10:39.962
to the regional center about the progress

00:10:39.962 --> 00:10:44.871
of the individual, as well
as for billing purposes.

00:10:44.871 --> 00:10:46.582
The regional centers bill

00:10:46.582 --> 00:10:48.471
the Department of Developmental Services.

00:10:48.471 --> 00:10:50.254
The Department of
Developmental Services bills

00:10:50.254 --> 00:10:53.437
the federal government, money comes out

00:10:53.437 --> 00:10:55.267
of the federal government,
and it all goes back up

00:10:55.267 --> 00:10:57.467
the stream the other direction.

00:10:57.467 --> 00:11:01.257
The reason that it all goes
through, or the vast majority

00:11:01.257 --> 00:11:03.578
of it goes through the
Department of Health Care Service

00:11:03.578 --> 00:11:06.828
is they are what we call in California,

00:11:08.787 --> 00:11:11.607
what we call our single
state entity for Medicaid.

00:11:11.607 --> 00:11:13.366
Basically the federal
government doesn't wanna talk

00:11:13.366 --> 00:11:15.949
to every department in
this state or in any state,

00:11:15.949 --> 00:11:19.655
for that matter, so most of
this funding is Medicaid funding

00:11:19.655 --> 00:11:20.908
and it has to flow through

00:11:20.908 --> 00:11:24.158
the Department of Health Care Services.

00:11:28.622 --> 00:11:31.864
The federal government
pushes a lot of initiatives

00:11:31.864 --> 00:11:36.169
on states, and the good
news is that in California,

00:11:36.169 --> 00:11:38.353
we've always had a very
progressive system.

00:11:38.353 --> 00:11:40.672
We've always wanted to
see people participating

00:11:40.672 --> 00:11:41.883
in their communities.

00:11:41.883 --> 00:11:46.050
We've always wanted to see
people living independent lives

00:11:47.572 --> 00:11:50.752
and so some of the trends
that are being pushed

00:11:50.752 --> 00:11:53.059
at the federal government,
at the federal level,

00:11:53.059 --> 00:11:55.654
are much tougher for
other states than they are

00:11:55.654 --> 00:11:58.282
for California at this time.

00:11:58.282 --> 00:12:00.528
Some pose a challenge,
frankly, because of the scale

00:12:00.528 --> 00:12:01.694
of our system.

00:12:01.694 --> 00:12:05.161
We serve 300,000 individuals
with developmental disabilities

00:12:05.161 --> 00:12:07.037
in the state of California.

00:12:07.037 --> 00:12:11.131
Other states, for example,
the state of Tennessee,

00:12:11.131 --> 00:12:12.714
serves about 8,000.

00:12:14.694 --> 00:12:17.703
You'll begin to see why
that's a challenge for us.

00:12:17.703 --> 00:12:19.994
First and foremost, the federal government

00:12:19.994 --> 00:12:22.269
wants to see person-centered planning.

00:12:22.269 --> 00:12:24.484
They want to see that the
person and their needs

00:12:24.484 --> 00:12:27.912
and their individual wants
and desires are central

00:12:27.912 --> 00:12:31.480
to the determination of what
services they will receive.

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:33.598
I heard one speaker one time refer to this

00:12:33.598 --> 00:12:37.917
as finding that balance
between what someone needs

00:12:37.917 --> 00:12:39.877
and what someone wants.

00:12:39.877 --> 00:12:44.757
What the person requires
and what makes their life

00:12:44.757 --> 00:12:46.180
worth living.

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:48.391
And that's really how we look at it.

00:12:48.391 --> 00:12:52.673
It is possible to meet someone's
health and safety needs

00:12:52.673 --> 00:12:55.896
without really giving them
the life that they desire.

00:12:55.896 --> 00:12:58.492
And that's really the balance
that we strive to achieve

00:12:58.492 --> 00:13:00.534
here in California.

00:13:00.534 --> 00:13:04.052
We started doing person-centered
planning in one form

00:13:04.052 --> 00:13:08.181
in 1992 in this state and other
states are just now starting

00:13:08.181 --> 00:13:09.431
down this path.

00:13:10.756 --> 00:13:13.189
Conflict free case management.

00:13:13.189 --> 00:13:15.538
In California, as I
mentioned, regional centers

00:13:15.538 --> 00:13:18.373
don't provide that
day-to-day direct support.

00:13:18.373 --> 00:13:21.252
In some other states,
the agencies that provide

00:13:21.252 --> 00:13:24.033
the case management function
are also service providers

00:13:24.033 --> 00:13:27.477
and you could see the potential
for conflicts of interest

00:13:27.477 --> 00:13:28.310
there.

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:31.632
The federal government
wants to see higher levels

00:13:31.632 --> 00:13:33.316
of community integration.

00:13:33.316 --> 00:13:35.462
They wanna see people
out in their communities

00:13:35.462 --> 00:13:40.349
and they wanna see people
part of their communities.

00:13:40.349 --> 00:13:44.516
We are continuously growing
and changing in this way.

00:13:47.602 --> 00:13:51.024
Having less settings that
are set aside just for people

00:13:51.024 --> 00:13:54.324
with disabilities, and
finding more creative ways

00:13:54.324 --> 00:13:56.880
to support people in natural communities,

00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:58.685
which we believe is good,
not only for the individual,

00:13:58.685 --> 00:14:01.185
but for the community as well.

00:14:02.054 --> 00:14:03.924
There's also an emphasis on greater levels

00:14:03.924 --> 00:14:05.800
of community employment.

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:10.028
As we know, employment
isn't just about a paycheck.

00:14:10.028 --> 00:14:13.482
It's about a sense of
belonging, it's about finding

00:14:13.482 --> 00:14:16.881
a community, it's about
creating a space for yourself

00:14:16.881 --> 00:14:20.667
in that community, and so the
emphasis at the federal level

00:14:20.667 --> 00:14:23.822
and at the state level as
well, is on helping people

00:14:23.822 --> 00:14:27.414
to find their place in this world.

00:14:27.414 --> 00:14:28.997
Measuring outcomes.

00:14:29.902 --> 00:14:33.652
We can really easily
measure what we provide,

00:14:35.379 --> 00:14:37.655
but we're working hard to begin to measure

00:14:37.655 --> 00:14:41.583
the ultimate impact on someone's life.

00:14:41.583 --> 00:14:43.925
We don't just wanna provide services.

00:14:43.925 --> 00:14:47.438
We wanna provide services that
make people's lives better

00:14:47.438 --> 00:14:49.612
and that make them
fulfilled, and that help them

00:14:49.612 --> 00:14:52.293
to achieve their goals.

00:14:52.293 --> 00:14:54.422
One method for measuring
progress in this way

00:14:54.422 --> 00:14:57.102
is the National Core Indicators Project,

00:14:57.102 --> 00:15:01.297
which soon, all 50 states
will participate in

00:15:01.297 --> 00:15:03.805
and it allows us to compare
outcomes from California

00:15:03.805 --> 00:15:07.972
to other states and also,
across regional centers as well.

00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:13.143
For instance, here is a chart from

00:15:15.062 --> 00:15:17.479
the National Core Indicators.

00:15:21.956 --> 00:15:26.123
This is the proportion of
people who describe themselves

00:15:28.022 --> 00:15:32.189
as having poor health and
this is the national chart,

00:15:34.989 --> 00:15:36.314
I believe.

00:15:36.314 --> 00:15:37.996
Yes, it says all states.

00:15:37.996 --> 00:15:41.287
So you can see the percentages there.

00:15:41.287 --> 00:15:45.211
And then you can see in
California that we have

00:15:45.211 --> 00:15:47.684
a greater number of people
who report themselves

00:15:47.684 --> 00:15:50.883
being in good health and less
people reporting themselves

00:15:50.883 --> 00:15:52.701
being in poor health.

00:15:52.701 --> 00:15:55.489
And those are the kinds
of outcomes we wanna see.

00:15:55.489 --> 00:15:57.836
Those show us that services
aren't just being provided

00:15:57.836 --> 00:16:02.003
for their own sake, but
they're making a difference.

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:07.427
As we look ahead, the state
is asking lots of questions

00:16:08.927 --> 00:16:11.553
of the Service System.

00:16:11.553 --> 00:16:12.938
We're not a stagnant system.

00:16:12.938 --> 00:16:14.488
We continue to grow.

00:16:14.488 --> 00:16:16.069
Next year it's expected that we'll grow

00:16:16.069 --> 00:16:20.236
by 14,000 individuals, which
is about a 3.6% growth rate,

00:16:22.631 --> 00:16:24.884
which far exceeds the
growth of the population

00:16:24.884 --> 00:16:26.371
in the state.

00:16:26.371 --> 00:16:29.566
Over time, our demographics have shifted.

00:16:29.566 --> 00:16:32.244
We're seeing far more
individuals with autism,

00:16:32.244 --> 00:16:35.614
we're seeing larger numbers of people

00:16:35.614 --> 00:16:38.541
who are outliving their caregivers

00:16:38.541 --> 00:16:40.705
and we're having to figure out what to do

00:16:40.705 --> 00:16:43.622
with an older geriatric population.

00:16:45.577 --> 00:16:47.883
The system is also asking
what services and supports

00:16:47.883 --> 00:16:49.985
will help the families to stay together.

00:16:49.985 --> 00:16:52.557
Here in California, 78% of individuals

00:16:52.557 --> 00:16:54.552
with developmental
disabilities live at home

00:16:54.552 --> 00:16:57.969
with their families and that is essential

00:17:00.021 --> 00:17:01.803
to the way our system works.

00:17:01.803 --> 00:17:03.716
Providing critical family support services

00:17:03.716 --> 00:17:06.270
to help families to stay together

00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:08.618
when that's the desired outcome.

00:17:08.618 --> 00:17:11.479
We're also beginning to look
at and continuing to look at,

00:17:11.479 --> 00:17:14.600
what are the opportunities
for what to do next?

00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:17.911
Where can we enhance the system?

00:17:17.911 --> 00:17:19.913
Finally, how can funding
be adjusted to ensure

00:17:19.913 --> 00:17:22.505
that it remains sustainable?

00:17:22.505 --> 00:17:25.589
We have an entitlement
system here in California.

00:17:25.589 --> 00:17:29.679
Individuals are entitled
to services and supports,

00:17:29.679 --> 00:17:33.596
but every year, the system must continue

00:17:33.596 --> 00:17:37.763
to seek out funding through
the legislative process.

00:17:39.843 --> 00:17:41.966
Concerns on the horizon.

00:17:41.966 --> 00:17:46.133
Now we're glancing across
the country to Washington.

00:17:46.969 --> 00:17:48.707
I know people in this
room are really concerned

00:17:48.707 --> 00:17:51.013
about all the things that
they're hearing out of Washington

00:17:51.013 --> 00:17:52.910
and so are we.

00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:56.159
The four things that
could have a major impact

00:17:56.159 --> 00:17:58.557
on our service system are,
of course, any changes

00:17:58.557 --> 00:18:00.781
to the Affordable Care Act.

00:18:00.781 --> 00:18:03.913
Some of our funding, as
I mentioned, much of it

00:18:03.913 --> 00:18:06.123
is Medicaid funding, so we serve

00:18:06.123 --> 00:18:08.596
the Medicaid expansion population.

00:18:08.596 --> 00:18:13.430
We also receive a few hundred
million dollars a year

00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:17.071
through an expansion of
federal funding specifically

00:18:17.071 --> 00:18:18.525
for our service system.

00:18:18.525 --> 00:18:20.225
That was part of the Affordable Care Act.

00:18:20.225 --> 00:18:22.539
We're continuing to watch these things.

00:18:22.539 --> 00:18:26.706
We also know that because
our system fills in gaps

00:18:29.205 --> 00:18:31.556
in services, that when new gaps open up,

00:18:31.556 --> 00:18:33.165
that poses a problem.

00:18:33.165 --> 00:18:35.858
If people begin to lose
health care or if they lose

00:18:35.858 --> 00:18:39.126
access to other services, that's a problem

00:18:39.126 --> 00:18:41.709
for the people that we support.

00:18:43.101 --> 00:18:47.202
We're also very concerned about
Medicaid funding structures.

00:18:47.202 --> 00:18:51.369
You hear, in Washington, talk
of Medicaid block granting

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:56.332
and this, at least the
third time that idea's

00:18:56.332 --> 00:18:59.140
been put forward, but
we're still concerned

00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:01.140
for a number of reasons.

00:19:02.047 --> 00:19:04.036
First, Medicaid block
granting is really hard

00:19:04.036 --> 00:19:05.487
on high growth states.

00:19:05.487 --> 00:19:07.102
We're a high growth state.

00:19:07.102 --> 00:19:12.043
Additionally, we're unclear
what that will look like

00:19:12.043 --> 00:19:13.998
because Medicaid funds
don't just go to fund

00:19:13.998 --> 00:19:16.387
doctor's appointments
and physical therapy.

00:19:16.387 --> 00:19:18.669
They also go to fund a
number of social services

00:19:18.669 --> 00:19:22.060
through the Regional Center, through IHSS,

00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:23.787
through all kinds of things.

00:19:23.787 --> 00:19:27.287
That's a very real concern for the system.

00:19:30.396 --> 00:19:33.824
Any changes to Medicare, also
a concern for our system.

00:19:33.824 --> 00:19:36.775
We have a number of
people, particularly those

00:19:36.775 --> 00:19:39.208
who have the greatest
levels of medical fragility

00:19:39.208 --> 00:19:40.708
who are Medi-Medi.

00:19:41.626 --> 00:19:44.085
So changes to the
Medicare funding structure

00:19:44.085 --> 00:19:46.418
could adversely impact them.

00:19:48.148 --> 00:19:51.821
There's also talk of changes
to special education.

00:19:51.821 --> 00:19:55.404
Again, we look at the
comprehensive whole person

00:19:55.404 --> 00:19:59.334
and we have to think about
what are the challenges

00:19:59.334 --> 00:20:01.930
that not only our system will face,

00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:04.043
but that these individuals
that we support will face

00:20:04.043 --> 00:20:06.245
and their families will face.

00:20:06.245 --> 00:20:08.055
Those are things that
we continue to monitor

00:20:08.055 --> 00:20:12.222
and continue to try to
educate our lawmakers about.

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:23.082
As if that's not
depressing enough (laughs),

00:20:23.082 --> 00:20:26.075
and sadly those are things
that keep me up at three AM

00:20:26.075 --> 00:20:28.345
thinking about Medicaid block granting.

00:20:28.345 --> 00:20:30.596
Hopefully you all, if
you're up at that hour

00:20:30.596 --> 00:20:33.665
have something else to worry about.

00:20:33.665 --> 00:20:35.143
A final thought.

00:20:35.143 --> 00:20:38.054
Our system turned 50 years old last year

00:20:38.054 --> 00:20:40.385
and there's a great video

00:20:40.385 --> 00:20:42.199
called We're Here To Speak For Justice.

00:20:42.199 --> 00:20:44.072
If you haven't seen it,
please take the time out

00:20:44.072 --> 00:20:44.906
to do it.

00:20:44.906 --> 00:20:47.828
It's from those inspirational
families who founded

00:20:47.828 --> 00:20:52.136
our system and who gave us the
backbone of what we do today.

00:20:52.136 --> 00:20:54.861
One of them said, "we were
clearing away new paths

00:20:54.861 --> 00:20:56.772
"to get the work done,
to get what we needed.

00:20:56.772 --> 00:20:59.550
"They didn't exist, so
we had to work on it

00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:01.506
"so that they did exist."

00:21:01.506 --> 00:21:04.057
Today, we consider ourselves
continuing to chart

00:21:04.057 --> 00:21:07.724
new paths where they
didn't exist yesterday.

00:21:10.648 --> 00:21:12.366
Any questions?

00:21:12.366 --> 00:21:15.366
(audience applause)
