00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:06.380
I'm Sterling Tadlock. And I grew up in eastern North Carolina. in a really small

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:12.040
rural community. about 50 minutes southeast of Raleigh.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.480
In a little town called Grantham. I was

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.440
raised as an only child. My dad was a Sheriff's Deputy. My mom was a stay at

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:25.530
home mom. we lived a pretty country, a rural life. you know, we never

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:31.490
really traveled outside of the state. and I grew up as an only child thinking

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.590
my parents were my real parents. which I

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.523
still classify them as my real parents. But

00:00:38.523 --> 00:00:43.470
yeah I didn't really any thing, think anything about it until I got a little

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.370
bit older. And sort of realized that, you

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.150
know, I don't really look like my parents

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.510
&gt;&gt; How old were you when that, when that happened?

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:51.190
&gt;&gt; I

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:57.080
was probably, you know, probably 11, 12 when I sort

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.850
of noticed. You know, my parents have different body shapes than

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.810
me. I always just, sort of wondered, why is that? And,

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.540
sort of just put it to the back of my mind.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:07.830
&gt;&gt; Mm hm

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.170
&gt;&gt; although I did notice that my friends, parents and

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.400
their siblings looked more similar than I looked to my parents.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:16.770
&gt;&gt; Mm hm

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.590
&gt;&gt; But again, I didn't really question in

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.470
it because I didn't really think anything of it.

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.420
That was really the only exposure I really had,

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.370
I never really understood, you know, growing up what

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.150
adopted meant. Just because sex is not talked

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.010
about in eastern North Carolina and the understanding of

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.140
where you come from. through your biological parents wasn't

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.650
really ever brought, so the concept of being adopted

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.590
was also never brought up.

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.040
&gt;&gt; So how old were you when you finally actually sort

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.220
of, figured it out? Or someone talked to you about it?

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.460
&gt;&gt; So, it was a really interesting story. I was 14. And

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.930
like most people in eastern North Carolina was raised in the Church. The

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.490
Church was a big facet of everyone's life. And I

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.949
went to Sunday School one day. I was 14 and coincidentally it was Father's Day

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:09.949
&gt;&gt;

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:09.830
[LAUGH]

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.540
&gt;&gt; And in church that day, in Sunday school lesson the teacher was talking

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.150
about how whenever you become adopted. Or whenever you become a Christian, you

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.400
become adopted into God's family. And he then looked

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:30.010
at me and he said So, why don't you tell the class what it feels like

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:35.220
to be adopted, Sterling. And, that sort of struck me.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.100
Because I, I had never heard that I

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.390
was adopted before. Like I said, I thought that...

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.500
&gt;&gt; Mm hm.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.730
&gt;&gt; You know? I look a little bit different

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.710
than my parents. And but then I saw pictures

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:48.730
of me as a baby with my parents. And so. You know, I just thought about it and I

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.630
was like no, I can't be adopted. And I

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.860
remember there was a lil, a girl, a distant

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.770
cousin of mine who said Sterling's not adopted those

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.620
are his real parents. and so, I sort of squashed

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.640
it in church although there was this rumbling anxiety within me.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:04.506
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:03:04.506 --> 00:03:08.140
&gt;&gt; and then I went to the sermon portion of church and I sat between

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.125
my grandmother, whom I refer to as me-maw, And my mama on the other side. And

00:03:13.125 --> 00:03:13.690
[COUGH]

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.470
I leaned over to my memaw and I was

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.410
like, so am I adopted? And she didn't look at

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.790
me, she looked, kept looking straight at the pulpit. And

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.660
she's like, you're going to have to ask your mother about

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.780
that. and so then I turned to my mama

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.370
and I was like, so I heard in Sunday school

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.450
that I'm adopted. And she's like, well you are. And

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.083
I just kind of froze, right there in the pew, and

00:03:37.083 --> 00:03:39.962
[COUGH]

00:03:39.962 --> 00:03:44.250
I just was in shock. I, I didn't really react at first, and then I just started

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:49.750
tearing up and crying and stood up and just sort of left.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:55.580
I think it's one of the sort of disadvantages in a way of being adopted is

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:04.026
this notion of survivor's guilt where there's a big disaster.

00:04:04.026 --> 00:04:06.470
this is where the term came form originally, I believe.

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.740
There's a big disaster and those that survive the disaster

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:10.620
feel guilty because they are not the ones that have been

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.800
injured or killed... And, when you're adopted, you feel like,

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.149
I was chosen, you know, by my parents. But there are

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:20.529
plenty of other people still in the foster care system

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:24.910
who weren't adopted. And you feel like you should be grateful,

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:26.800
you know, that you were adopted. And you should be

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.300
thankful every day that you live that you have a

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.480
family that you know, raised you and supported you. And,

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:37.940
and I am thankful, but you know, anytime I question

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.330
being adopted, who my biological parents are, that's like a twinge of guilt.

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.500
&gt;&gt; How did that make you think

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.730
about your biological parents? Once you discovered this

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:50.270
information, what was going through your mind

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:52.890
about the scenario in which you found yourself?

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.980
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.200
&gt;&gt; Did you have a lot of questions?

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.290
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean, I think there's a lot of fantasy that goes on with,

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:05.150
you know, who they could be. Like, are they like me? Do they act like me?

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.070
Do they talk like me? What are their

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:10.580
professions? Like, what if it's like, you know.

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:11.990
I remember when I was a teenager, like

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.048
what if it's like some European like. royal family.

00:05:15.048 --> 00:05:16.048
&gt;&gt;

00:05:15.048 --> 00:05:15.774
[LAUGH]

00:05:15.774 --> 00:05:18.720
&gt;&gt; Who like, ships their child off to North Carolina.

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:23.050
And was reared by you know, some really awesome Southern parents.

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.495
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:05:23.495 --> 00:05:28.320
&gt;&gt; that obviously came to mind. Also like, what if they're in jail?

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:28.350
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:30.920
&gt;&gt; Or you know, you know, not even alive. Like,

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:34.090
even that, that came into mind. So I was just

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:35.950
always curious as to what they were. What they were

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:40.910
like. and also what was the situation that led them

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:43.970
to having to put up a child for adoption? I'm also

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:46.640
just sort of curious about their lives. Like, what are they like?

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:52.090
if I have any siblings or not. I mean that's always

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:57.670
a question of mine. if there are any health considerations? You know,

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:01.650
there are a lot of health diseases medical diseases. Have the

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:06.490
huge genetic component and like knowing that information is important to me.

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:08.800
&gt;&gt; You know, as part of participation we've offered you an

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:14.110
opportunity to actually submit a DNA sample and find out. You know,

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:17.520
if there in the 23andMe program if you might

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:22.510
find any genetic relatives of yours. you know, what

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:25.240
are your thoughts surrounding that. You, you've submitted your,

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.000
your, your DNA. You submitted your sample, but you haven't

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.360
seen your results yet. you know, what are some

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.160
thoughts going into that about participating in a program like

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.510
that. And what you expect to see, what you

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:38.680
expect to find and how that might make you feel.

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:39.960
&gt;&gt; You

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.790
know, to be honest, I haven't thought about

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:45.120
it too much, because Again, that fantasy play

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:49.340
of, you know, finding my biological parents. Like,

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:51.600
finding the DNA that may match with mine and

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:55.560
seeing what percentage the similarities are and being

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:59.220
able to contact them. I don't want to disappoint

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:02.850
myself, because I know that the the highest

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:05.350
likelihood is that there's probably going to be some distant,

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:10.730
distant cousin that has similar DNA to, to me. So I'm not really putting a

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:14.340
whole lot of stock into it, as far as finding somebody. But I am interested in

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:19.030
seeing you know, the other facets of my DNA. That 23andMe will sort

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:24.659
of elucidate such as risk for medical diseases. And

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:30.350
pharmacological sort of ability to metabolize drugs and respond

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:35.360
to them. I think that's a part of it, and just generic ancestor stuff.

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.880
&gt;&gt; Are you excited to see your 23andme results?

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.550
&gt;&gt; I am, I am, I've been holding out. They've

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:43.850
actually been available for a little bit now, but For the

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:48.310
purposes of the interview, I've sort of held back. I'm waiting

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:49.980
on the edge of my seat to see what they say.
