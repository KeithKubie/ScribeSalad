00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.766
The answer to both of these questions is most likely yes. Clearly language is

00:00:03.766 --> 00:00:06.886
the most important means of communicating our thought and ideas, but they're

00:00:06.886 --> 00:00:11.528
not necessarily the same, as these two examples demonstrate. We might have an

00:00:11.528 --> 00:00:15.080
idea in one language that we can't quite translate to another. Or you might

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.056
have a lot of thoughts going through your head, but you can't quite get them

00:00:18.056 --> 00:00:22.093
out into words. That shows that there is a slight disconnect between thought

00:00:22.093 --> 00:00:25.180
and language. But let's go to Susan for a little bit more on this.
