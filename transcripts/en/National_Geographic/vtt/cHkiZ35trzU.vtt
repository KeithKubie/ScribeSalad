00:00:01.433 --> 00:00:06.400
What will life be like
in a early Mars colony?

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.000
ROGER LAUNIUS: Let's take
some stages in terms of how

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
we might do things on Mars.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.800
There is exploration, somebody
going out and coming back.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.533
The next stage would be some
sort of research station.

00:00:24.667 --> 00:00:28.467
We will mostly
resupply it from Earth.

00:00:28.467 --> 00:00:31.633
You cycle people in and
out on a regular basis.

00:00:31.633 --> 00:00:34.567
I would contend that that would
look a lot like Antarctica.

00:00:39.033 --> 00:00:40.166
You don't have to
fly into space,

00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:41.333
obviously, to go to Antarctica.

00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:43.166
But it's not easy to get to.

00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:46.500
And it's not easy to
sustain life there.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.100
NARRATOR: At the very
bottom of the world,

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.033
there's a cheerless land where
the long night is 125 degrees

00:00:52.033 --> 00:00:56.367
below 0 and murderous winds
howl at 200 miles an hour

00:00:56.367 --> 00:01:00.834
across a desert as
desolate as the moon.

00:01:00.834 --> 00:01:03.266
CHARLES ELACHI: Before we used
to send people to Antarctica,

00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:05.867
they crossed the
Antarctic continent

00:01:05.867 --> 00:01:08.900
and came back and waited
three, four years before you

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.400
sent the next expedition.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.567
NARRATOR: Then in
1954, a dozen nations

00:01:14.567 --> 00:01:19.000
decided to man 50 stations
built around the continent.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.200
Now, the emphasis
shifted to science.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.734
CHARLES ELACHI:
Today, you literally

00:01:24.734 --> 00:01:28.000
have hundreds of people who
actually live in the station

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.867
throughout the year.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.033
JOSEPH LEVY: There are
more scientists working

00:01:34.033 --> 00:01:35.600
in Antarctica today
from more different

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.033
countries than there probably
have ever been in the past.

00:01:39.033 --> 00:01:40.667
And what that means
is, globally, we

00:01:40.667 --> 00:01:42.967
need to think about how
we collaborate and manage

00:01:42.967 --> 00:01:45.000
and work together.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.834
I think it's a
good model for how

00:01:46.834 --> 00:01:50.200
policy and engineering and
politics can come together

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.433
to produce great science.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.467
JOHN BRUNSFELD:
The McMurdo Station

00:02:01.467 --> 00:02:04.867
is a kind of analog to
the kind of activity

00:02:04.867 --> 00:02:09.200
we hopefully want to do on
Mars someday because McMurdo

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.367
is, in fact, a city.

00:02:12.367 --> 00:02:15.033
This is where you have
infrastructure, where you have

00:02:15.033 --> 00:02:18.100
power, where you have supplies.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.600
BK GRANT: We have
everything from people

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.400
who cook the food to people
who prepare science cargo.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.700
We all live and work together.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.633
And we have
essentially one goal.

00:02:28.633 --> 00:02:31.300
And that is to
support the science.

00:02:34.433 --> 00:02:35.967
DAVID DINGES: What
happens in the Antarctic

00:02:35.967 --> 00:02:40.967
is what will likely
happen on Mars.

00:02:40.967 --> 00:02:43.667
We'll create a kind of
early version of community.

00:02:45.967 --> 00:02:49.333
And what we really want to do
is make sure that we understand

00:02:49.333 --> 00:02:53.266
how humans can cope with
the next level of risk

00:02:53.266 --> 00:02:57.266
living on Mars, trying
to feed everybody,

00:02:57.266 --> 00:02:59.266
and coping with
different visions

00:02:59.266 --> 00:03:01.834
of what should happen next.

00:03:01.834 --> 00:03:04.834
And that's going to require
a much different level of

00:03:04.834 --> 00:03:06.233
understanding how to do this.

00:03:06.233 --> 00:03:07.400
We'll get there.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.800
We just got to move
to it in steps.
