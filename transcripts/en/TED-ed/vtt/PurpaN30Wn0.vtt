00:00:14.605 --> 00:00:19.716
I would like to introduce you
to my favorite parasite.

00:00:19.716 --> 00:00:21.551
There are millions that I could choose from

00:00:21.551 --> 00:00:22.866
and this is it:

00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:24.336
it's called the jewel wasp.

00:00:24.336 --> 00:00:27.283
You can find it 
in parts of Africa and Asia.

00:00:27.283 --> 00:00:28.608
It's a little under an inch long,

00:00:28.608 --> 00:00:30.997
and it is a beautiful looking parasite.

00:00:30.997 --> 00:00:32.659
Now, you may be saying to yourself,

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:34.225
"This is not a parasite.

00:00:34.225 --> 00:00:35.153
It's not a tapeworm,

00:00:35.153 --> 00:00:35.895
it's not a virus,

00:00:35.895 --> 00:00:38.639
how could a wasp be a parasite?"

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:40.553
You are probably thinking 
about regular wasps,

00:00:40.553 --> 00:00:45.008
you know, the ones that build 
paper nests as their house.

00:00:45.008 --> 00:00:48.663
Well, the thing is that the jewel wasp

00:00:48.663 --> 00:00:52.721
makes its house inside 
a living cockroach.

00:00:54.627 --> 00:00:57.669
Here's how it happens.

00:00:57.669 --> 00:01:00.552
A jewel wasp is flying around, 
looking for a cockroach.

00:01:00.552 --> 00:01:03.719
When it sees one, it lands 
and bites on its wing.

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:04.933
So, I'll be the cockroach.

00:01:04.933 --> 00:01:06.273
Be-wha! Bewha!

00:01:06.273 --> 00:01:08.352
And the cockroach starts shaking it off,

00:01:08.352 --> 00:01:10.671
"Get away from me!"

00:01:10.671 --> 00:01:14.551
The wasp very quickly starts
stinging the cockroach.

00:01:14.551 --> 00:01:17.045
All of a sudden, the cockroach can't move,

00:01:17.045 --> 00:01:18.474
for about a minute.

00:01:18.474 --> 00:01:21.095
And then it recovers

00:01:21.095 --> 00:01:22.843
and stands up.

00:01:22.843 --> 00:01:24.294
It could run away now,

00:01:24.294 --> 00:01:26.286
but it doesn't.

00:01:26.286 --> 00:01:28.596
It just doesn't want to.

00:01:28.596 --> 00:01:30.482
It just stays there.

00:01:30.482 --> 00:01:33.571
It's become a zombie slave.

00:01:35.371 --> 00:01:37.435
Again, I'm not making this up.

00:01:37.435 --> 00:01:38.651
The wasp goes off,

00:01:38.651 --> 00:01:41.266
it walks away and finds a hole

00:01:41.266 --> 00:01:44.155
and digs it out, makes it into a burrow.

00:01:44.155 --> 00:01:45.586
It walks back.

00:01:45.586 --> 00:01:48.268
This can take up to half an hour.

00:01:48.268 --> 00:01:51.181
The cockroach is still there.

00:01:51.181 --> 00:01:53.697
What do we do now?

00:01:53.697 --> 00:01:56.917
The wasps grabs onto one of the antenna,

00:01:56.917 --> 00:01:58.203
bites down on it,

00:01:58.203 --> 00:01:59.134
of the cockroach,

00:01:59.134 --> 00:02:01.933
and pulls the cockroach.

00:02:01.933 --> 00:02:04.770
And the cockroach says, "Alright,"

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.851
and walks like a dog on a leash.

00:02:07.851 --> 00:02:11.765
The wasp takes it 
all the way down into the burrow.

00:02:11.765 --> 00:02:14.744
The cockroach says, "Nice place."

00:02:14.744 --> 00:02:16.331
The wasp takes care of some business

00:02:16.331 --> 00:02:17.933
and then goes and leaves the burrow

00:02:17.933 --> 00:02:19.130
and seals it shut,

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.412
leaving the cockroach entombed 
in darkness, still alive.

00:02:23.412 --> 00:02:27.319
The cockroach says, "Alright, 
I'll stay here if you want."

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.558
Now, I mentioned that 
the cockroach took care,

00:02:29.558 --> 00:02:32.278
ah, the wasp took care 
of a little business

00:02:32.278 --> 00:02:34.683
before it left the burrow.

00:02:34.683 --> 00:02:37.105
The business was laying an egg

00:02:37.105 --> 00:02:39.382
on the underside of the cockroach.

00:02:39.382 --> 00:02:40.729
The egg hatches.

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:42.140
Out comes a wasp larva.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.792
It looks kind of like 
a maggot with big, nasty jaws.

00:02:45.792 --> 00:02:49.315
It chews a hole into the cockroach

00:02:49.315 --> 00:02:51.913
and starts to feed from the outside.

00:02:51.913 --> 00:02:55.352
It gets bigger, 
like you can see over here.

00:02:55.352 --> 00:02:56.922
And then when it gets big enough,

00:02:56.922 --> 00:03:00.457
it decides to crawl into the hole,

00:03:00.457 --> 00:03:02.215
into the cockroach.

00:03:02.215 --> 00:03:05.800
So now it's inside 
the still-living cockroach

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.557
and the cockroach doesn't mind much.

00:03:09.557 --> 00:03:11.701
This goes on for about a month.

00:03:11.701 --> 00:03:14.293
The larva grows and grows and grows,

00:03:14.293 --> 00:03:16.678
then makes a pupa, 
kind of like a cocoon.

00:03:16.678 --> 00:03:18.930
Inside there it grows eyes,

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:19.915
it grows wings,

00:03:19.915 --> 00:03:21.804
it grows legs,

00:03:21.804 --> 00:03:24.767
the cockroach is still alive, 
still waiting.

00:03:24.767 --> 00:03:27.142
Finally the wasp is ready to leave,

00:03:27.142 --> 00:03:30.553
and that's when the cockroach finally dies

00:03:30.553 --> 00:03:33.140
because the fullly-formed adult wasp

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.595
crawls out of the cockroach's dying body.

00:03:38.193 --> 00:03:40.966
The wasp shakes itself off,

00:03:40.966 --> 00:03:42.207
climbs out of the burrow,

00:03:42.207 --> 00:03:44.349
goes and finds another wasp to mate with

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:47.960
to start this whole, crazy cycle again.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.731
So, this is not science fiction,

00:03:50.731 --> 00:03:54.592
this happens every day, 
all over the world.

00:03:54.592 --> 00:03:58.343
And scientists are 
totally fascinated by this.

00:03:58.343 --> 00:04:01.540
They're just starting to figure out
how all this happens.

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.212
And, when you really start 
to look at the science of it,

00:04:04.212 --> 00:04:08.128
you start to kind of respect 
this very creepy wasp.

00:04:08.128 --> 00:04:12.079
You see, the thing is that 
when it attacks the cockroach,

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:13.570
it's not just stinging wildly,

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:18.998
it delivers two precise stings.

00:04:18.998 --> 00:04:21.060
It knows this cockroach's nervous system

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.509
like you know the back of your hand.

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:26.308
The first sting goes to that spot there,

00:04:26.308 --> 00:04:28.473
called the "walking rhythm generators,"

00:04:28.473 --> 00:04:29.311
and, as you can guess,

00:04:29.311 --> 00:04:30.984
those are the neurons that send signals

00:04:30.984 --> 00:04:33.120
to the legs to move.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.025
It blocks the channels 
that the neurons use

00:04:36.025 --> 00:04:36.987
to send these signals.

00:04:36.987 --> 00:04:39.508
So the cockroach wants to go, 
it wants to run away,

00:04:39.508 --> 00:04:42.835
but it can't because 
it can't move its legs.

00:04:42.835 --> 00:04:45.041
And that lasted for about a minute.

00:04:45.041 --> 00:04:49.917
This is really sophisticated pharmacology.

00:04:49.917 --> 00:04:51.996
We actually use the same method,

00:04:51.996 --> 00:04:53.266
a drug called Ivermectin,

00:04:53.266 --> 00:04:54.227
to cure river blindness,

00:04:54.227 --> 00:04:55.496
which is caused by a parasitic worm

00:04:55.496 --> 00:04:57.600
that gets into your eye.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.734
If you take Ivermectin, 
you paralyze the worm

00:05:00.734 --> 00:05:03.071
using the same strategy.

00:05:03.071 --> 00:05:05.150
Now, we discovered this in the 1970s,

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.331
the wasp has been doing this for millions of years.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.546
Then comes the second sting.

00:05:11.546 --> 00:05:14.974
Now the second sting actually hits two places along the way.

00:05:14.974 --> 00:05:18.057
And to try to imagine how this can happen,

00:05:18.057 --> 00:05:22.172
I want you to picture yourself with a friend

00:05:22.172 --> 00:05:25.790
who's got a very long, very, very scary looking needle.

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:26.571
And your friend,

00:05:26.571 --> 00:05:28.090
or at least you thought he was your friend,

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:31.314
sticks it in your neck,

00:05:31.314 --> 00:05:33.288
goes into your skull,

00:05:33.288 --> 00:05:35.672
stops off at one part of your brain

00:05:35.672 --> 00:05:38.787
and injects some drugs,

00:05:38.787 --> 00:05:40.986
then keeps going in your brain

00:05:40.986 --> 00:05:43.621
and injects some more.

00:05:43.621 --> 00:05:45.186
These are two particular spots,

00:05:45.186 --> 00:05:46.196
marked here, "SEG",

00:05:46.196 --> 00:05:50.313
and you can see the tip of it in the brain, marked "Br".

00:05:50.313 --> 00:05:55.749
Now, we can do this, but it's really hard for us.

00:05:55.749 --> 00:05:57.997
It's called stereotactic drug delivery.

00:05:57.997 --> 00:06:00.522
You have to put a patient in a big metal frame

00:06:00.522 --> 00:06:01.642
to hold them still,

00:06:01.642 --> 00:06:03.803
you need CAT Scans to know where you're going,

00:06:03.803 --> 00:06:05.094
so you look at the picture and say,

00:06:05.094 --> 00:06:07.305
"Are we going the right way?"

00:06:07.305 --> 00:06:10.542
The jewel wasp has sensors on its stinger

00:06:10.542 --> 00:06:14.489
and scientists think that it can actually feel its way

00:06:14.489 --> 00:06:17.092
through the cockroach's brain until it gets

00:06:17.092 --> 00:06:19.876
to the exact, right place,

00:06:19.876 --> 00:06:22.703
and then penetrates an individual neuron

00:06:22.703 --> 00:06:25.244
and then delivers the goods.

00:06:25.244 --> 00:06:29.389
So, this is quite amazing stuff,

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:31.440
and what seems to happen then

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:36.772
is that the wasp is taking away the control

00:06:36.772 --> 00:06:39.214
that the cockroach has over its own body.

00:06:39.214 --> 00:06:42.124
It's taking away the cockroach's free will.

00:06:42.124 --> 00:06:43.688
We didn't really appreciate that cockroaches

00:06:43.688 --> 00:06:46.657
have free will until this wasp showed us.

00:06:46.657 --> 00:06:50.343
And, we have no idea how it's doing this,

00:06:50.343 --> 00:06:52.443
we don't know yet what the venom has in it

00:06:52.443 --> 00:06:53.926
and we don't know which circuits

00:06:53.926 --> 00:06:56.380
it's hitting in the cockroach's brain,

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:58.278
and I think that's why this is,

00:06:58.278 --> 00:07:00.208
most of all, my favorite parasite

00:07:00.208 --> 00:07:03.194
because we have so much left to learn from it.

00:07:03.194 --> 00:07:05.323
Thank you very much.
