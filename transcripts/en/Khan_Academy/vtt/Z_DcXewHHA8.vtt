00:00:00.627 --> 00:00:03.088
Any economy is a super complicated thing

00:00:03.088 --> 00:00:04.203
So what I am going to do in this video

00:00:04.203 --> 00:00:05.735
is a super over simplification.

00:00:05.735 --> 00:00:07.732
But it is just a way of thinking about things.

00:00:07.732 --> 00:00:09.218
In particular, I want to think about

00:00:09.218 --> 00:00:12.005
why good economies tend to be associated

00:00:12.005 --> 00:00:14.884
with a moderate level of inflation.

00:00:14.884 --> 00:00:16.370
And that will also help inform us

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:17.670
when we are thinking about Stagflation

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.808
when we have inflation with a bad economy.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.732
So, a good economy, employment is up

00:00:22.732 --> 00:00:24.218
And because employment is up,

00:00:24.218 --> 00:00:26.633
employees have more negotiating power

00:00:26.633 --> 00:00:28.305
There's more people who want to hire them,

00:00:28.305 --> 00:00:30.302
there is fewer people who wants their jobs,

00:00:30.302 --> 00:00:32.673
And so wages will go up.

00:00:33.181 --> 00:00:35.225
And since you have more people with jobs,

00:00:35.225 --> 00:00:36.943
And those who have jobs are being paid more,

00:00:36.943 --> 00:00:39.404
You can imagine that demand will also go up.

00:00:39.404 --> 00:00:42.051
There is more people that have money in their pockets.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.466
And if demand goes up,

00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:48.228
Then companies, or you can think of them as factories,

00:00:48.228 --> 00:00:49.714
But it can also be services,

00:00:49.714 --> 00:00:52.593
Then everything will be utilized more.

00:00:52.593 --> 00:00:53.801
And if things are utilized more,

00:00:53.801 --> 00:00:56.959
Then the companies or those factories

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:58.120
or whatever you want to think of them,

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.999
They are going to have more profit.

00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:05.411
On top of that, if they get close to fully utilization,

00:01:05.411 --> 00:01:07.361
Or if they see that fully utilization is down the road,

00:01:07.361 --> 00:01:09.869
They are going to want to invest more.

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.866
And, they could actually push off that

00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:13.956
utilization and get more profit,

00:01:13.956 --> 00:01:17.485
by maybe raising prices.

00:01:17.485 --> 00:01:19.668
So this is where that moderate of inflation,

00:01:19.668 --> 00:01:21.572
really shows up.

00:01:21.572 --> 00:01:23.058
The fact that there is more demand,

00:01:23.058 --> 00:01:24.312
the fact that you can produce a little bit more,

00:01:24.312 --> 00:01:26.401
and it could raise prices a little bit more.

00:01:26.401 --> 00:01:28.073
So this is where,

00:01:28.073 --> 00:01:30.024
the moderate level of inflation shows up.

00:01:30.024 --> 00:01:31.742
And there is a little bit of a negative feedback,

00:01:31.742 --> 00:01:33.182
if price goes up.

00:01:33.182 --> 00:01:36.575
It will inhibit demand a little bit.

00:01:36.852 --> 00:01:38.522
And that is why it is moderate inflation,

00:01:38.522 --> 00:01:41.013
not some type of crazy inflationary spiral here.

00:01:41.013 --> 00:01:43.840
But the net effect of more utilization,

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.651
and more investment

00:01:45.651 --> 00:01:48.484
is going to be an increase in supply.

00:01:48.576 --> 00:01:51.456
is going to be an increase in supply.

00:01:51.656 --> 00:01:52.497
And once again,

00:01:52.497 --> 00:01:54.799
And this is kind of e-con 101,

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:58.218
If supply goes up, price will also have an

00:01:59.526 --> 00:02:03.293
inhibitory impact on price.

00:02:03.739 --> 00:02:07.036
So let me draw, so we get all the feedback loops here.

00:02:07.036 --> 00:02:09.683
So this is negative feedback right over there.

00:02:09.683 --> 00:02:12.002
But to complete the loop, if we are investing more,

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.653
we are going to build more factories.

00:02:14.653 --> 00:02:17.253
or some more capacity to do services or whatever else.

00:02:17.253 --> 00:02:20.225
That is going to increase employment.

00:02:20.225 --> 00:02:21.479
If we have more profit,

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:23.894
Then a company feels better about growing,

00:02:23.894 --> 00:02:25.458
It feels more like it have a cushion,

00:02:25.458 --> 00:02:27.238
and feels more optimistic about the future,

00:02:27.238 --> 00:02:28.863
that is going to help employment.

00:02:28.863 --> 00:02:31.185
And obviously, utilization itself

00:02:31.185 --> 00:02:33.507
if we want to run the factory lines longer,

00:02:33.507 --> 00:02:35.179
we are going to need more people to run those lines.

00:02:35.179 --> 00:02:38.244
So that will also increase employment.

00:02:38.244 --> 00:02:40.659
This is like the general feedback loop

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:44.513
you can add little nuanced twists to this,

00:02:44.513 --> 00:02:47.811
but this is the general idea of a why a moderate level of inflation is

00:02:47.811 --> 00:02:52.037
kind of associated with this virtuous cycle

00:02:52.037 --> 99:59:59.999
you normally see in a good economy.
