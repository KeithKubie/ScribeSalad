understanding how people view losses and

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240
understanding how people view losses and
 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.060
understanding how people view losses and
games and there's nobel-prize-winning

games and there's nobel-prize-winning
 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.769

behavioral economics theory that says

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779
behavioral economics theory that says
 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.340
behavioral economics theory that says
that people value put a value of losses

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350
that people value put a value of losses
 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.920
that people value put a value of losses
on at least twice when an equivalent

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930
on at least twice when an equivalent
 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.410
on at least twice when an equivalent
gain is and that's how people get their

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420
gain is and that's how people get their
 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.439
gain is and that's how people get their
valuations distorted and actually the

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449
valuations distorted and actually the
 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.900
valuations distorted and actually the
guys that came up with that theory said

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910
guys that came up with that theory said
 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.720
guys that came up with that theory said
it's twice as losses are twice as heavy

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730
it's twice as losses are twice as heavy
 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.479
it's twice as losses are twice as heavy
as gains but then they've unofficially

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489
as gains but then they've unofficially
 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.190
as gains but then they've unofficially
said you know really it's five to seven

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200
said you know really it's five to seven
 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.440
said you know really it's five to seven
times as much we just wrote down twice

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450
times as much we just wrote down twice
 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.819
times as much we just wrote down twice
as much because we wanted fewer

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829
as much because we wanted fewer
 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.040

arguments so losing five dollars stings

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050

at least twice as much as gaining five

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800
at least twice as much as gaining five
 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.600
at least twice as much as gaining five
dollars losing five dollars feels like

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610
dollars losing five dollars feels like
 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.479
dollars losing five dollars feels like
losing ten dollars or even thirty five

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489
losing ten dollars or even thirty five
 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.260
losing ten dollars or even thirty five
dollars it's just a ridiculous skewing

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270
dollars it's just a ridiculous skewing
 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.160
dollars it's just a ridiculous skewing
in our brains over loss which is why

is worth a hundred dollars and you're

only charging 80 well based on prospect

only charging 80 well based on prospect
 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:17.810
only charging 80 well based on prospect
theory is in it they're not going to

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820
theory is in it they're not going to
 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.520
theory is in it they're not going to
make that exchange well to us that makes

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530
make that exchange well to us that makes
 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.870
make that exchange well to us that makes
all the sense in the world because it's

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880
all the sense in the world because it's
 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.929
all the sense in the world because it's
a game but if 80 losing it paying eighty

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939
a game but if 80 losing it paying eighty
 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.580
a game but if 80 losing it paying eighty
dollars for something it's got to be

dollars for something it's got to be
 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.380
dollars for something it's got to be
worth at least 160 dollars for them to

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390
worth at least 160 dollars for them to
 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.289
worth at least 160 dollars for them to
want it's this crazy math that goes on

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299
want it's this crazy math that goes on
 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.319
want it's this crazy math that goes on
in our heads over gains and loss gains

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329
in our heads over gains and loss gains
 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.999
in our heads over gains and loss gains
and losses it just did there's nothing

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009
and losses it just did there's nothing
 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.789
and losses it just did there's nothing
we can do about it so understanding that

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799
we can do about it so understanding that
 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.120
we can do about it so understanding that
first of all when I begin to use an

first of all when I begin to use an
 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.190
first of all when I begin to use an
accusations on it to try to diminish

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200
accusations on it to try to diminish
 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.160
accusations on it to try to diminish
those fears of loss it gets a person

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170
those fears of loss it gets a person
 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.639
those fears of loss it gets a person
back more into even games and then I

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649
back more into even games and then I
 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.859
back more into even games and then I
realize that people are more likely to

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869
realize that people are more likely to
 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.410
realize that people are more likely to
do things to avoid losses in the

do things to avoid losses in the
negotiation all I have to point out is

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430
negotiation all I have to point out is
 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.959
negotiation all I have to point out is
what's actually going to be lost if this

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969
what's actually going to be lost if this
 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.840
what's actually going to be lost if this
isn't done in some ways in the business

into getting all that money for those

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310
into getting all that money for those

losing those referrals that's pretty
 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.720
losing those referrals that's pretty
common and after a while people tend to

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730
common and after a while people tend to
 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.010
common and after a while people tend to
catch on to it the much wiser approach

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020
catch on to it the much wiser approach
 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.680
catch on to it the much wiser approach
is for me to simply point out how not

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690
is for me to simply point out how not
 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.460
is for me to simply point out how not
doing this deal is in fact costing you

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470
doing this deal is in fact costing you
 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.300
doing this deal is in fact costing you
every day if you do nothing you lose if

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310
every day if you do nothing you lose if
 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.880
every day if you do nothing you lose if
you don't address this issue it's going

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890
you don't address this issue it's going
 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.190
you don't address this issue it's going
to cost you so when the status quo

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200
to cost you so when the status quo
 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.150
to cost you so when the status quo
becomes laws and people are more likely

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160
becomes laws and people are more likely
 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.590

to make a decision to make a move
 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.870
to make a decision to make a move
because of prospect theory just the fear

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880
because of prospect theory just the fear
 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:16.030
because of prospect theory just the fear
of loss in our head is huge
