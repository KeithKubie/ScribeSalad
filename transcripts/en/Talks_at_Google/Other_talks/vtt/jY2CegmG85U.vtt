Katie &gt;&gt; Welcome everyone, thanks for coming
to an Authors at Google talk featuring Thomas

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:11.530
Goetz. We're really excited to have you here.
Thomas Goetz is executive editor at Wired

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:16.410
Magazine and has more then 15 years of experience
in Journalism having worked at the Village

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.210
Voice, The Wall Street Journal, and the Industry
Standard. He frequently writes about science,

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.010
health, and medicine and he has a Master of
Public Health degree from UC Berkeley. He

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.360
is not a doctor though but even given that,
he's written that things that kills us today

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.230
aren't infections or epidemics. They are diseases
of lifestyle, in other words, more than half

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.949
of us are the agents of our own demise which
sounds kind of scary but he's actually pretty

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:46.859
optimistic about healthcare. He's here today
to talk about "The Decision Tree" and his

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:51.370
main sort of argument is that the more people
see themselves as decision makers in their

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.980
own healthcare, the better their behavior
and outcomes, and he also talks a lot about

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.609
how technology can help people control their
health better. So, we have discounted books

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:06.680
so after the talk if you'd like to go purchase
one and speak to Mr. Goetz, he will gladly

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:13.860
sign a copy for you as well and then if you
have any questions, we have a mic here after

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.500
the talk. Please feel free to come up and
ask so with that, please welcome Thomas Goetz.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.500
[applause]

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:31.130
Thomas Goetz &gt;&gt; Thanks. So you guys don't
have to stay so far back. If you come closer,

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.880
it's easier for me but, your choice. So I'm
very happy to be here at Google to talk about

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:42.090
this. I actually um-- A lot of these ideas
that are in the book were hashed out,

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.660
some of them, in this very room when I would
come to SciFoo over the last few years which

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:55.240
is a little conference that Google and Nature
and O'Reilly put together, so it's fun to

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:01.490
be here to talk about the same ideas again.
What I wanted to talk about today was this

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.360
idea of, you know, there's been a lot of discussion,
especially of late, about a healthcare crisis

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:13.910
and a need for healthcare reform in the US.
There is also--, that is true and it needs

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:21.780
addressing and we need to engage our government
in providing coverage for people and making

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.200
sure everyone has access to healthcare, but
there's another issue involved which is not

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:35.790
so much a healthcare crisis as a health crisis
which is happening in the country and basically

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:41.670
that as Katie alluded to, we are making all
sorts of decisions that lead to consequences

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:48.990
that really doesn't have to work out that
way. We're making poor decisions, poorly informed

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:55.410
decisions, that basically lead to a consequence
of poor health and I just want to explain

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:01.349
that and discuss that a little bit today.
So, there's no end of health information,

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:08.120
right? There's no end of access to information
about our health. We are inundated with a

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.990
cacophony of information in fact, we are barraged
with a stern list of things we should do and

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:17.900
shouldn't do, mostly shouldn't do, and the
trick is we don't actually do them. Only three

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:23.600
percent of Americans manage to pull off four
basic health behaviors, behaviors that any

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.090
one of you would probably be able to
recite off if I put you to it but they are

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.849
to not smoke, maintain a healthy body weight,
get some regular exercise, and don't drink

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:40.739
too much. So only three percent of Americans
manage to do all four of those behaviors consistently,

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:45.160
which is pretty startling. What it means is
that we are basically somehow

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.090
disengaged from all that information that
is coming at us. We don't really have a way

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:55.239
to put it into an action and what happens
is that we are not only making poor decisions

00:03:55.239 --> 00:04:01.459
for ourselves but we're making poor decisions
for our families and we are failing to act

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:06.879
when we can, when we have these little moments
of making choices we are making the wrong

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:11.150
choices. We think our health doesn't matter,
health too often is something that we decide

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:16.299
that we don't want to engage in and that is
somehow a source of anxiety or fear for many

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.900
people, for many Americans. For these people,
that's probably the case, right? You don't

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:26.470
want to think about it. I think that's unfortunate
and it's not the way it needs to be. What

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:32.220
happens in practice, what's happening in this
country is that we are getting a series of

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:39.340
decisions are cascading to more and more serious
conditions so you have what I call a "cascade

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:44.310
of cormorbidities". You have one disease leading
to the other disease leading to the next disease

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:50.460
and this is the way most of us get sick and
die in this country. In fact, seventy percent

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:58.150
of Americans die of chronic disease, so these
are diseases that are not infectious diseases,

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:04.090
these are not diseases that come out of the
blue, they are diseases that slowly build

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:09.710
and it's the deterioration of health. Likewise,
seventy percent of the money that we spend

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:14.380
on healthcare in this country is spent on
managing chronic diseases. So when you look

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:19.600
at healthcare reform and where we should be
directing some of the issues of reforming

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:24.680
the cost side, well this is part of the problem,
right? It's that these chronic diseases are

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:30.820
causing us to spend too much money to keep
people alive when they have already had a

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:36.550
disease beset themselves. It's not where we
want to be, and then of course you get this

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:43.440
stat that was alluded to. 55 percent of Americans
die of something that can be traced back to

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:48.800
a personal decision. This was a study done
by Ralph Keeney out of Duke University. He's

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:54.530
an operations researcher which is one of these
fascinating disciplines. You've got, maybe

00:05:54.530 --> 00:06:00.150
some of you are in operations research, but
what he did is he took the kind of standard

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:06.120
CDC data, right? The mortality data that the
CDC gathers on all of us and he analyzed it

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:10.280
in a slightly different way. What he wanted
to do was see how many of the

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:16.280
mortality statistics could be attributed if
you work your way back to a choice, when somebody

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:21.070
had a choice. What he did was he excluded
some of the things that we don't necessarily

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:25.960
think of as a choice such as getting in your
car, right? Getting in your car, we pretty

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:30.150
much have to do that if we want to be a functioning
member of society, but getting in your car

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:36.000
drunk or getting in your car and texting,
well that's a decision so those decisions

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.010
would be ones that would fall under this 55
percent. It's startling when you think about

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:47.150
it that if more than half of us are dying
because of these decisions, why are we making

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:55.650
these decisions? Where do we lack this opportunity
to engage? Right. So that's a problem and

00:06:55.650 --> 00:07:00.270
that's the depressing part of the talk. What
I want to do now is turn towards this idea,

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:06.889
what I actually think is a very helpful and
hopeful way of righting this wrong, particularly

00:07:06.889 --> 00:07:13.070
I want to talk about three experiments. These
are three experiments that are in the book

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:19.380
that I think are, to me, offer a new structure
and new approach to our engagement with our

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:26.539
health. The first experiment takes place in
London, on Whitehall Street. In the 1960's,

00:07:26.539 --> 00:07:32.070
in 1967, a couple of researchers from the
London School of Hygiene came to Whitehall

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:37.100
Street and decided that this was the place
to conduct a unprecedented experiment. Whitehall

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:41.199
Street is the epicenter of British government.
It is the equivalent of, when you say Whitehall

00:07:41.199 --> 00:07:46.729
in the UK it's the equivalent of saying Washington
here. At the end is Big Ben, that's the Halls

00:07:46.729 --> 00:07:50.889
of Parliament, around the corner is 10 Downing
Street, and up and down Whitehall Street are

00:07:50.889 --> 00:07:57.060
all the government offices, right? So the
Labor office, the Treasury, all the kind of

00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:01.150
offices of government. What's great, and what
made Whitehall especially in the 1960's such

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:07.500
an important place to do a population study,
was that it was, as the researchers called,

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:12.590
"exquisitely stratified". So you had through
the ranks of the civil service, through the

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:18.400
ranks of people who worked on Whitehall, you
had five distinct categories. You had an executive

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:23.530
class, an administrative class, a clerical
class--, No, I'm sorry. an executive, an administrative,

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:27.930
a professional, a clerical, and at the bottom
was another category; these were the messengers,

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:34.740
the janitors who kind of did all the work
that was left for them.

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:39.899
What the researchers found was that, let me
back up, they specifically wanted to study

00:08:39.899 --> 00:08:44.900
the causes, not the causes of heart disease
but who was most likely to get heart disease,

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:49.290
so that's why they were drawn to Whitehall
Street because they had this great stratification

00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:55.640
by class. So what they found was that the
people at the bottom of the group, of the

00:08:55.640 --> 00:09:00.060
18,000 people, the people at the bottom had
four times the risk of dying of heart disease

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:06.520
as the people at the to. So there was something
really negative about being at the bottom

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:11.150
and there was something protective about being
at the top. Well, we could all imagine what

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:15.750
some of these things are, right? So it looked
like the people at the bottom tended to smoke

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:21.980
a little bit more, people at the bottom tended
to not have as healthy a diet, they tended

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:26.620
to be a little heavier, so those were known
risks for heart disease and so they factored

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:31.750
all those things out of the study but they
were still left with this profound relation

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:39.170
between status and heart disease. The people
at the bottom now, with all the factors excluded,

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:42.560
all the known factors excluded, the people
at the bottom are still twice as likely to

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:47.320
die of heart disease at the people at the
top, and there was no known reason for this

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:52.711
association so it was pretty stunning.
They didn't know what to make of it. They

00:09:52.711 --> 00:09:57.410
thought at first that maybe there was something
protective about being in the upper classes,

00:09:57.410 --> 00:10:01.501
maybe there was some genetic inbreeding that
maybe protected you if you were part of the

00:10:01.501 --> 00:10:06.990
aristocracy or the elite, that didn't hold
water for very long.

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:13.330
So what they were left with was the idea that
maybe status in and of itself was the correlation,

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:19.740
maybe status was the driver towards good or
bad health. They distilled it to this idea

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:24.050
of control of destiny, that the people at
the bottom had very little control of their

00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:29.709
destiny. When they made decisions, they were
only somewhat likely to come true because

00:10:29.709 --> 00:10:33.421
they were subject to all the other decisions
of everybody above them while the people at

00:10:33.421 --> 00:10:38.170
the very top, they made a decision and that
was pretty much the way things went, right?

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:42.920
They were in control and the people at the
bottom had very little control and we all

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:47.769
know what this feels like. I mean, the people
we deal with these kind of ideas all the time.

00:10:47.769 --> 00:10:51.060
When we call customer service, those are people
at the bottom, right?

00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:55.170
So when we call customer service and they
can't help us with our cell phone plan, we

00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:59.510
say, "Can I speak to your supervisor?" And
they can't help so we say, "Can we speak to

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:02.540
your supervisor?", and we go up and up the
chain until we get somebody who can make a

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:06.209
decision, right? Somebody who has some control,
somebody who has some authority. Likewise,

00:11:06.209 --> 00:11:09.580
we know what it's like to be at the other
end of the spectrum, we know what it's like

00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:13.670
to have control. We know what it's like to
be, you know we have all these phrases, when

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:20.120
we're in the flow we're in the top our game,
we are surfing the wave, this is a good feeling,

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:27.640
we like to be in control. So, the second experiment
that I want to talk about takes place in the

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:33.310
bathroom, particularly it takes place in 5,000
bathrooms around the country. There was this

00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:37.180
great research study that's ongoing out of
Brown University and it's called the National

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:41.350
Weight Control Registry and what they've done
is they've selected 5,000

00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:46.430
people, 5,000 Americans, who have successfully
lost weight. They've lost at least thirty

00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:51.279
pounds and kept it off for at least a year
and so basically if you want to study what

00:11:51.279 --> 00:11:56.970
are the secrets to losing weight, these are
the people you want to talk to, right? So

00:11:56.970 --> 00:12:00.280
they asked them, they've surveyed them for
all the tricks that they might have, all their

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:04.330
behaviors, everything that they do, they've
given them surveys after surveys. And what

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:08.060
they found is a lot of the things that you
might expect. They tend to exercise a little

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:13.310
more than the average person and they tend
to watch what they eat a little better, so

00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:17.190
they have better nutritional choices. You
might have heard that when you tend to eat

00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:22.420
at breakfast regularly, that it actually correlates
with maintaining a health body weight, that's

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:27.019
comes out of the National Weight Control Registry.
But one of the other things they found that

00:12:27.019 --> 00:12:32.790
was quite surprising that they didn't expect
to find at all was the simple fact that the

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:38.670
people who successfully lost weight stepped
on a scale a lot. In fact, 80 percent of them

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:43.500
stepped on a scale at least once a day, and
50 percent--, I'm sorry 80 percent of them

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:46.950
stepped on a scale at least once a week, 50
percent of them stepped on a scale once a

00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:52.510
day like this woman, Jody Green, who every
day steps on a scale, takes a picture of it,

00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:59.709
and posts it on Flickr with a fancy pair of
socks. What they've all realized is that this

00:12:59.709 --> 00:13:06.649
tracking, this idea of monitoring their progress,
is a very powerful, helpful way to engage

00:13:06.649 --> 00:13:12.270
in successful behavior change. Now it's known
by the phrase, in public health they call

00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:16.420
it feedback, right? So when you get people
involved in a feedback loop and you help them

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:21.000
monitor their progress, they tend to be able
to successfully or have better success at

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.670
changing their behavior. Now you combine this
feedback loop with the idea of groups and

00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:30.560
you get even more potential for change so
this is the secret in fact of Weight Watchers,

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:35.730
right? I don't know if, when I started this
project I was actually very skeptical of Weight

00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:39.130
Watchers. What it turns out is that it's one
of the few diet programs that actually works

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:43.130
because they give you feedback, they have
this point system that some of you may have

00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:48.700
heard of that basically translates the nutritional
information box on the cereal and the food

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:53.410
products into a formula that gives you a number
of points that you're allowed and that's a

00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:57.459
very simple way of getting people involved
in this feedback loop. Likewise, they have

00:13:57.459 --> 00:14:00.721
these meetings, right? With Weight Watchers,
they go to the meeting. They call it the magic

00:14:00.721 --> 00:14:03.680
of the meeting and when you're able to share
your information, when you are able to share

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:08.730
your progress and track and compare your progress
with other people's progress, it turns out

00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:13.750
to be an effective way to change behavior.
so that's what we get out of the National

00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:21.980
Weight Control Registry. The third experiment
that I wanted to offer today takes us to Kansas

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:28.210
City, Missouri and an orthodontic clinic.
There was an orthodontic clinic a few years

00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:34.389
ago that, as many orthodontists do, they deal
with teenagers, lots of adolescents who have

00:14:34.389 --> 00:14:40.130
braces and what they had was a group of kind
of incorrigibles who wouldn't brush their

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:47.800
teeth. They had these kids who had just really
bad oral hygiene. So they--, in fact, they

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:51.889
had to, this is the way that you monitor this
is to take photographs of your teeth and then

00:14:51.889 --> 00:14:57.430
you can analyze it for plaque coverage, so
they had forty kids who had about 70 percent

00:14:57.430 --> 00:15:02.540
of their tooth surface was covered with plaque,
right? So 70 percent was the baseline. They

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:07.950
took-- they split the forty kids into two
groups, one, they said, they brought them

00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:11.480
into the office and said, "We'd like you be
part of this study with this new experimental

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:15.709
toothpaste", so they gave them the toothpaste
and it said experimental in big, black letters

00:15:15.709 --> 00:15:20.250
on the side and they said, "Go home and brush
your teeth like we'd told you before. Brush

00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:23.630
your teeth twice a day, two minutes a day."
They even gave them a little kitchen timer

00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:28.220
to time it, "and come back in three months."
So that was the experimental group. The control

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:32.420
group were twenty kids who were members of
the clinic but they didn't tell them they

00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:37.829
were going to be an experiment. They had signed
a kind of blanket waiver as a patient of the

00:15:37.829 --> 00:15:40.490
clinic so they didn't have
to tell them they were going to be in the

00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:45.040
experiment, they were just on track to come
back in three months anyway. So after three

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:49.579
months, you can imagine where this is going,
after three months the kids in the experimental

00:15:49.579 --> 00:15:54.600
group had profoundly improved dental hygiene.
It's not going to sound that profound but

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:59.019
their coverage had gone from 70 percent down
to 50 percent which was, actually after three

00:15:59.019 --> 00:16:02.519
months, considered quite good progress. The
control group meanwhile, their hygiene had

00:16:02.519 --> 00:16:08.040
actually gotten a little worse. They had ticked
up to nearly 80 percent coverage so there

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:11.490
was a real significant difference, right?
At least 30 percent difference between the

00:16:11.490 --> 00:16:15.779
control group and the experimental group.
The question is what was in that toothpaste?

00:16:15.779 --> 00:16:20.769
What was the secret toothpaste that they gave?
Well, it was Crest with fluoride, right? It

00:16:20.769 --> 00:16:26.050
was ordinary Crest. The magic wasn't in the
toothpaste at all, it was in the fact that

00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:30.220
these kids were in an experiment and they
knew they were in an experiment, so no doubt

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:34.910
some of you already know what this is called.
This is called the Hawthorne Effect. It's

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:39.540
named after this kind of mythical study that
was done in the 1920's by Western Electric

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:44.050
Company. They wanted to see if they could
get their workers to be more productive, so

00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:49.110
they would experiment with the lighting in
the factory. They were making relays and when

00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:53.269
they would raise the lights to see if they
made more relays or they would lower the lights

00:16:53.269 --> 00:16:56.880
to see if they would make more relays. It
turned out when they did either one, lights

00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:00.949
went up, lights went down, they made more
relays because when the lights change, the

00:17:00.949 --> 00:17:06.350
workers knew that the experiment was on so
this has become kind of the mythical way of

00:17:06.350 --> 00:17:10.899
describing this phenomenon that when people
are under observation, they tend to change

00:17:10.899 --> 00:17:15.319
their behavior. So it's related to placebo
effect, it's the same thing that you see Heisenberg

00:17:15.319 --> 00:17:18.629
uncertainty principle, these are kind of well
known phenomena throughout the sciences. They

00:17:18.629 --> 00:17:25.759
are particularly vexing with experiments that
involved human subjects so during clinical

00:17:25.759 --> 00:17:32.029
trials for drugs, for instance, the Hawthorne
Effect is this thing that researchers try

00:17:32.029 --> 00:17:36.729
to accommodate and try to kind of factor out.
There are all sorts of ways of trying to get

00:17:36.729 --> 00:17:40.539
ride of the Hawthorne Effect. What was really
interesting about these orthodontists in Kansas

00:17:40.539 --> 00:17:44.840
City was they decided what happens if we try
to put the Hawthorne Effect to work? What

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:50.809
happens if we try to put it to work and engage
people in the idea that they're in an experiment

00:17:50.809 --> 00:17:55.940
and it turned out to work. So what do we do
with this? What do we do with these three

00:17:55.940 --> 00:18:00.389
experiments? The idea
of control of destiny from Whitehall, the

00:18:00.389 --> 00:18:04.330
idea of feedback in groups that we've gotten
out of the National Weight Control Registry,

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:12.240
and then this idea of making your life an
experiment out of the orthodontic clinic in

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:20.679
Kansas City? To me, it becomes, in essence,
an algorithm, which being at Google makes

00:18:20.679 --> 00:18:27.379
sense to talk about. It's a formula that we
can actually use to start being more active,

00:18:27.379 --> 00:18:32.019
more engaged in monitoring our health, start
taking some control of our health. If we can

00:18:32.019 --> 00:18:37.419
use the opportunity to monitor where we are,
chart our progress, compare it to other people,

00:18:37.419 --> 00:18:42.109
actively use the data that we are generating
all the time every day in our lives and in

00:18:42.109 --> 00:18:48.359
our health, we can actually start to engage
with that information and have some control

00:18:48.359 --> 00:18:52.570
even though in the other senses of our lives,
it we may not feel like we do have a great

00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:55.809
dealof control.
It turns out that other research has borne

00:18:55.809 --> 00:19:00.440
this out as well. When you give people, when
you give patients, an opportunity to participate

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:05.710
in their care, when they are simply involved
in the decision making, their averages, their

00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:11.629
outcomes on average tend to get much better.
In fact, they tend to get about 20 to 25 percent

00:19:11.629 --> 00:19:16.590
better then people who aren't involved in
the decision making. So it's also auspicious

00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:22.289
that I'm talking to you guys about this because
this idea of feedback in groups as powerful

00:19:22.289 --> 00:19:28.529
members or powerful drivers of behavior
change, can be pretty much easily translated

00:19:28.529 --> 00:19:34.570
into the terms data and social networks, right?
They are almost analogous terms and the fact

00:19:34.570 --> 00:19:40.200
is that even though public health researchers
have known for many years that feedback in

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:44.190
groups are good ways of getting people to
engage behavior change, it hasn't been that

00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:48.649
easy, right? So you have to go through all
these kind of fancy research studies or you

00:19:48.649 --> 00:19:52.350
have to sign up with a program like Weight
Watchers, there's a lot of friction involved

00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:56.940
in getting people to actually go through the
process of feedback and behavior change. But

00:19:56.940 --> 00:20:00.950
if you translate it into data and social networks,
if you start using information technologies

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:05.610
to tap into these same ideas, it becomes a
lot easier. There is far less friction involved,

00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:13.220
it's far more easy for anybody to get access
to these tools and strategies. This to me

00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:18.840
is what makes it so auspicious, that we're
at this moment in our healthcare system when

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:23.109
we can start developing new tools and new
strategies to work on these principles and

00:20:23.109 --> 00:20:29.499
start engaging people in their health. So
one way that this looks, one way that this

00:20:29.499 --> 00:20:36.419
kind of comes to life, is all the tracking
apps that are on the iPhone. So this is my

00:20:36.419 --> 00:20:43.379
iPhone that I've loaded up with about 18 apps
here. There are actually thousands of tracking

00:20:43.379 --> 00:20:50.279
apps on the iTunes store. I have my Nexus
One and I'm going to suitably load that up

00:20:50.279 --> 00:20:56.470
with apps as well but it's remarkable. There's
the app with the scale there, Lose It!, it's

00:20:56.470 --> 00:21:00.409
been downloaded four and a half million times
and what it does is, it's a really nifty,

00:21:00.409 --> 00:21:07.019
very simple free app, that you enter your
weight and then you enter your target weight

00:21:07.019 --> 00:21:11.729
and it calculates how many calories you should
consume a day. Then every time you eat something,

00:21:11.729 --> 00:21:18.100
it gives you a menu of preloaded library of
foods and with just a few a clicks, you are

00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:23.700
able to register how many calories you're
consuming and it's constantly adding it and

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:28.479
keeping you on track towards that overall
calorie goal. Now this is a much easier way,

00:21:28.479 --> 00:21:32.429
it has far less friction than the traditional
way of getting people to write everything

00:21:32.429 --> 00:21:37.580
down. The food diaries that people traditionally
have to do to engage in this stuff. Likewise,

00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:44.320
there are some awesome little calculators
that are working our personal data into this

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:49.650
kind of huge body of health research that's
out there. When you think about the first

00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:53.099
slide I showed, that cacophony of information
that we get, one reason that that doesn't

00:21:53.099 --> 00:21:57.549
work is because it doesn't have relevance
to us, right? It's all generic, impersonal

00:21:57.549 --> 00:22:07.169
data. You know, if a study says that 50 percent
of people are deficient in Vitamin D, the

00:22:07.169 --> 00:22:11.059
question is are you in the 50 percent that
is deficient or do you have enough? You want

00:22:11.059 --> 00:22:15.599
to be--,you want to know which side of the
coin you're on so there are these new predictive

00:22:15.599 --> 00:22:21.399
tools, these online calculators that are being
developed. Very, very, actually, not, not-they

00:22:21.399 --> 00:22:27.920
are aggregating to cover more and more of
our health and they are remarkably effective

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:33.249
at combining our personal information, our
personal metrics, with this aggregate of generic

00:22:33.249 --> 00:22:41.009
information. So this is developed by a lab
at Harvard University, it's called Lifemath.net

00:22:41.009 --> 00:22:48.960
and you basically just fill out a few little
drop down menus so I did it here and it calculates,

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:53.200
it gives you a specific list of actions that
you can take, personal actions that you can

00:22:53.200 --> 00:23:01.179
take that will, according to general research,
correlate to improved life.So it's integrating

00:23:01.179 --> 00:23:06.639
our own metrics, our own data with what's
known and what's generally told to everybody,

00:23:06.639 --> 00:23:11.849
what everybody kind of hears; take an aspirin,
cut down on alcohol, but all of a sudden that

00:23:11.849 --> 00:23:20.470
information becomes very, very compelling
and relevant to us in explicit terms. So there

00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:26.340
are all sorts of examples of this. The--,
kind of--, since I started writing the book

00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:31.690
two years ago, this was very scattershot.
There were a few tools here or there. In fact

00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:35.490
when I started work on the book, things like
Microsoft Healthvault and Google Health didn't

00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:41.249
even exist, or they hadn't been announced
yet. So in that time, in that span of two

00:23:41.249 --> 00:23:45.809
years, there have been dozen of tools that
have emerged. Everything from 23andMe on one

00:23:45.809 --> 00:23:49.969
end that kind of gives us a look at our genetic
information and how we can start building

00:23:49.969 --> 00:23:56.249
a baseline of our health based on our genetic
predispositions all the way to PatientsLikeMe

00:23:56.249 --> 00:24:02.679
at the other end which lets us build our personal
data when we have a disease from Parkinson's

00:24:02.679 --> 00:24:07.729
to a mood disorder and share that information
with other people, and come to more insights

00:24:07.729 --> 00:24:13.219
and better engagement, and so I want to leave
you with these three idea take aways. The

00:24:13.219 --> 00:24:16.899
first is that data means more when it's our
data. When we're given relevant information,

00:24:16.899 --> 00:24:22.700
it becomes incredibly more powerful driver
of behavior change. It's demonstrated not

00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:26.740
just in the studies that I talked about here
but in dozens of other studies, and the second

00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:30.519
is, that the more that we engage, the better
our health so this is the idea that I touched

00:24:30.519 --> 00:24:35.479
on, that when people are given a role in their
health and when they are participants of their

00:24:35.479 --> 00:24:39.239
health, they tend to have better outcomes.
Likewise, there was a study done, a meta analysis,

00:24:39.239 --> 00:24:43.700
of decision tools so these are specific tools
that when somebody say is diagnosed with a

00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:50.570
cancer and they want to know what chemotherapy
they might be able to take, these are simple

00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:56.080
online calculators that help people understand
the risks and benefits of every different

00:24:56.080 --> 00:25:01.409
chemotherapy guiding them to what is hopefully
an informed choice in correlation, in association

00:25:01.409 --> 00:25:06.859
with their doctor of course. It turns out
that this meta analysis showed that again,

00:25:06.859 --> 00:25:11.080
when people are given these decision tools,
when they are given an opportunity to actually

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:16.169
make decisions for their health and for their
choices, even not just preventive decisions

00:25:16.169 --> 00:25:21.499
but treatment decisions, care decisions, when
you are faced with a disease and really life

00:25:21.499 --> 00:25:28.250
or death stakes, the outcomes improve. The
third principle is as simple as this: every

00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:33.169
decision counts. So we are constantly making
decisions about our health, from those little

00:25:33.169 --> 00:25:37.739
micro decisions about where to park and how
far are we going to walk to work to what we

00:25:37.739 --> 00:25:41.840
are going to eat to whether we are going to
go to the gym that day. Every decision that

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:47.229
we make adds up to our health, you know. We
set off on these trajectories of health basically

00:25:47.229 --> 00:25:53.440
and too often the approach is that it's kind
of fate is taking us on our course, right?

00:25:53.440 --> 00:26:00.039
That our health is something that we are not
necessarily in control of, we are not necessarily

00:26:00.039 --> 00:26:05.049
even participating in and I think that's exactly
wrong and that's what I'm hoping that people

00:26:05.049 --> 00:26:13.950
will start to realize, is that they become--,
we all are the drivers of our own health trajectories,

00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:19.809
and that's the essence of what I'm getting
at. Because as far as I'm concerned, it seems

00:26:19.809 --> 00:26:25.239
like life is an experiment. None of us know
at the end of the day or at the beginning

00:26:25.239 --> 00:26:29.129
of the day,what the end of the day is going
to hold, right? When we get up in the morning,

00:26:29.129 --> 00:26:33.049
we are never really sure. We might have a
very clear agenda but we are never really

00:26:33.049 --> 00:26:37.409
sure how things are going to play out, on
any given day or any given week or even given

00:26:37.409 --> 00:26:43.570
month. There are inputs and outputs that we're
all in control of, we don't necessarily have

00:26:43.570 --> 00:26:49.409
a way to get perfect health but we can help
move the lever where we have some influence.

00:26:49.409 --> 00:26:55.879
We can help drive our way to better health.
So that's the idea, that's some of the stuff

00:26:55.879 --> 00:27:03.379
that's in the book. I'd love to hear your
questions. I hear that you guys are good and

00:27:03.379 --> 00:27:08.039
pretty versed in making people think on their
toes so I look forward to some questions.

00:27:08.039 --> 00:27:11.090
If you want to get in touch with me otherwise,
this is how. Thanks very much.

00:27:11.090 --> 00:27:13.760
[applause]

00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:21.769
Somebody's got something.

00:27:21.769 --> 00:27:27.729
Do you have to use the microphone?

00:27:27.729 --> 00:27:36.679
&gt;&gt; How did you tackle this topic? Because
you said your background was in, or is in,

00:27:36.679 --> 00:27:41.979
journalism, so what persuaded you to go into
the medical industry?

00:27:41.979 --> 00:27:48.379
Thomas Goetz &gt;&gt; So I come from a family of
healthcare workers. My father is a doctor,

00:27:48.379 --> 00:27:51.539
my mom is a nurse, my sister's a surgeon,
and my other sister was a public health worker

00:27:51.539 --> 00:27:56.460
so I was the black sheep of the family as
a journalist. That was the easy way out so

00:27:56.460 --> 00:28:03.269
eventually I just, one of the cool things
about working at Wired, was that we are in

00:28:03.269 --> 00:28:06.979
the thick of it. We are not just covering
things, we are really trying to engage in

00:28:06.979 --> 00:28:14.589
change and I realized that in order to be
better at my job, not just as an editor but

00:28:14.589 --> 00:28:21.159
as a writer, it seems prudent and even a little
bit fun to cross the bridge into Berkeley,

00:28:21.159 --> 00:28:26.419
so I worked out a way to go to Berkeley in
the morning and work at Wired in the afternoon

00:28:26.419 --> 00:28:41.049
and so this book basically came out of some
of the studies I was doing at Berkeley.

00:28:41.049 --> 00:28:48.639
&gt;&gt; So when you are looking at these tests,
these feedback, 80 percent on the scale and

00:28:48.639 --> 00:28:52.220
people joining groups, how do you separate
out the fact that those 80 percent are super

00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:54.999
motivated, that's why they're on the scale
every day versus being on the scale every

00:28:54.999 --> 00:28:55.999
day, you know? Cause versus effect?

00:28:55.999 --> 00:29:03.200
Thomas Goetz &gt;&gt; Right, right, right. So part
of what you're getting at is to what extent

00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:08.320
do these strategies scale to broader populations,
right? So you get self selecting in terms

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:11.919
of the groups but also the question is if
you are going to start asking people to track

00:29:11.919 --> 00:29:16.099
their health, how many people are actually
going to get to do that, right? There are

00:29:16.099 --> 00:29:21.479
certain groups of people who are more predisposed
to engage in data, people who are more happy

00:29:21.479 --> 00:29:29.320
or comfortable with quantitative information,
so that's all true and in many ways, this

00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:35.440
is a kind of a classic early adopter phenomenon.
What I mentioned was the idea of friction,

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:41.149
right? So right now it takes a fair amount
of work. Even the tools that I'm talking about,

00:29:41.149 --> 00:29:48.529
you have to actually work to find the tools,
you have to work to use them. They are fairly

00:29:48.529 --> 00:29:54.859
easy to use but you have to figure it out.
It's, as I say, working out the classic kind

00:29:54.859 --> 00:30:00.710
of early adopter curve is that it's just getting
easier. You have things like the Moore's Law

00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:06.129
of sensor which is making tracking movement
much more passive and automatic, right? So

00:30:06.129 --> 00:30:11.350
you have little gizmos like the Fitbit that
right now, for 99 dollars, clip it on your

00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:16.599
waist and you can track not only your cadence
and your calorie count but also your sleep

00:30:16.599 --> 00:30:27.859
quality. It's becoming easier and easier,
so I look to things like high blood pressure

00:30:27.859 --> 00:30:34.659
and cholesterol which 20, 30 years ago were
not numbers that the general public was familiar

00:30:34.659 --> 00:30:39.779
with at all. In fact, cholesterol was, there
was a lot of debate whether it even mattered

00:30:39.779 --> 00:30:44.639
for people but now you know, large percentages
of the population know their blood pressure,

00:30:44.639 --> 00:30:48.240
they know their cholesterol count, and they
know which way they want to be driving those

00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:56.139
numbers. I think one interesting thing that
might be relevant to you guys is that, I just

00:30:56.139 --> 00:31:02.359
read this over the weekend, Americans are
now reading three times as much text today

00:31:02.359 --> 00:31:10.080
then they did in 1980. That's not books, that's
not magazines unfortunately, it's just texts.

00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:14.149
It's because of the Internet, right? We are
consuming much more information and I feel,

00:31:14.149 --> 00:31:19.450
that to me, that's a very hopeful sign that
we are becoming more comfortable as a nation

00:31:19.450 --> 00:31:22.799
with the idea of consuming information and
working it into our lives and making choices

00:31:22.799 --> 00:31:23.799
based on it.

00:31:23.799 --> 00:31:27.309
&gt;&gt; So beyond the book, what are you doing
with this information? You're saying that

00:31:27.309 --> 00:31:37.669
as more people engage in their health then
it would improve so is this kind of, is there

00:31:37.669 --> 00:31:46.059
anything being done in terms of trying to
help improve the general populous?

00:31:46.059 --> 00:31:52.279
Thomas Goetz &gt;&gt; So what am I personally doing?
Well, that's a good question. I wrote the

00:31:52.279 --> 00:31:59.340
book. Hopefully, people will read it. That's
part of what I can do, right? I mean, as a

00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:05.309
writer and an author, that's the way I communicate
but I'm also, there are programs like the

00:32:05.309 --> 00:32:11.179
Robert Wood Johnson Foundation which has this
really clever group called the Pioneer Portfolio

00:32:11.179 --> 00:32:19.299
which is trying to identify a lot of the kind
of trends in this book or in what I was talking

00:32:19.299 --> 00:32:27.369
about today and support those groups, so I
am a champion of them. I try to identify the

00:32:27.369 --> 00:32:34.759
kind of precursors of this stuff and you know
to me, it's a trend that; one of the things

00:32:34.759 --> 00:32:42.899
that is fun about working at Wired and about
writing this way is that you are able to help

00:32:42.899 --> 00:32:47.400
people understand how technology is going
to change their life. That's really what I

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:52.279
think the mission of the magazine and the
mission of the book is, that it's not just

00:32:52.279 --> 00:32:55.940
to write about a technology but it's the technology
that is going to kind of really transform

00:32:55.940 --> 00:33:05.139
people's lives and helping people understand
that is what I can do and it's what I'm hoping

00:33:05.139 --> 00:33:08.309
to do. That's something.

00:33:08.309 --> 00:33:14.049
&gt;&gt; So, I actually thought your book was maybe
on something slightly different and I think

00:33:14.049 --> 00:33:20.190
it may cover this area as well so I'll just
go ahead and ask the question. I think the

00:33:20.190 --> 00:33:27.499
things you talked about were in terms of keeping
a healthy weight and not drinking too much

00:33:27.499 --> 00:33:33.690
and not smoking are fairly well established
and you can find consensus everywhere in the

00:33:33.690 --> 00:33:41.489
medical profession, that those are things
to be avoided, but as far as medical decisions

00:33:41.489 --> 00:33:51.119
or dietary decisions that are more marginal,
that are things that are a subject of debate,

00:33:51.119 --> 00:33:57.860
the typical way that has worked in the past
is somebody has talked to a physician and

00:33:57.860 --> 00:34:01.880
the physician has handed down a dictate or
a mandate and said, "This is what you should

00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:08.399
be doing and this is what you shouldn't be
doing", and as I think everyone here is aware

00:34:08.399 --> 00:34:14.490
of, the availability of medical information
online and directly to the individual has

00:34:14.490 --> 00:34:24.179
been increasing for the last twenty or thirty
years. How have you seen this kind of,these

00:34:24.179 --> 00:34:33.179
systems used to influence sort of the well
care that people have been doing for themselves

00:34:33.179 --> 00:34:39.879
for things that may or may not be as cut and
dry as don't smoke? I mean, I know you mentioned

00:34:39.879 --> 00:34:48.260
taking aspirin on an earlier slide. That is
a little bit less universally -

00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:56.909
Thomas Goetz &gt;&gt; Right. So the reason I chose
to focus on things like obesity in this presentation

00:34:56.909 --> 00:35:03.539
is because it really underlines the disconnect
between the way we deliver health information

00:35:03.539 --> 00:35:08.400
and what people actually do, right? So even
though everybody, so there's this great paradox.

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:13.089
Everybody knows what they're supposed to do,
but we don't do it. And so that's the problem

00:35:13.089 --> 00:35:20.349
that is kind of besetting us in terms of our
health, so what I'm trying to do in terms

00:35:20.349 --> 00:35:23.590
of this presentation is nip off a strategy
for dealing with that, so that's why I was

00:35:23.590 --> 00:35:27.970
dealing with those things that are kind of
truisms, but trying to change those truisms

00:35:27.970 --> 00:35:34.460
into something that you can actually effectively
work on. Now in terms of the other stuff that

00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:41.029
is less cut and dried, the book does talk
about it. For instance, screening tests, right?

00:35:41.029 --> 00:35:49.089
So a screening test is a great idea and a
great resource if it's a good test and if

00:35:49.089 --> 00:35:55.190
you are somebody who should be screened for
that disease. So for instance, something like

00:35:55.190 --> 00:36:02.810
prostate cancer, you may wanna-- when you
hit 40 or when you hit 50, men might want

00:36:02.810 --> 00:36:08.940
to get examined for prostate cancer and might
want to get what called a PSA test.

00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:16.160
The question is what course of action should
you take when you get those results? Because

00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:24.339
something like 50 percent of men over age
70 have some trace of prostate cancer. So

00:36:24.339 --> 00:36:30.130
that's a lot but only 10 percent of men will
actually die of prostate cancer, so the question

00:36:30.130 --> 00:36:35.430
is how do you know what fraction you are part
of, right? So you want to go down this road

00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:40.119
of being treated for prostate cancer which
often boils down to radiation or removal,

00:36:40.119 --> 00:36:46.980
both of which carry potential side effects
of impotence and incontinence so serious,

00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:51.720
serious life changing side effects. Do you
want to go down that road even though you

00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:58.869
only probably have on a statistical level
a small percentage of dying of that disease?

00:36:58.869 --> 00:37:02.640
That's a decision that everybody needs to
make for themselves and negotiate those probabilities

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:08.529
and statistics, right? So at every step of
the way, do you get a PSA test to begin with?

00:37:08.529 --> 00:37:15.100
If you show up with a high level of PSA, do
you want to get a biopsy? If you do get a

00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:20.849
biopsy, do you want to actually go radiation
or removal? These are all percentages, right?

00:37:20.849 --> 00:37:25.960
There are statistics behind every one of these
decisions. This is what a decision tree is.

00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:33.809
My hope is that by making it clear that there
are always, that all of these choices have

00:37:33.809 --> 00:37:41.569
very clear numbers behind them and opportunities
to parse the numbers. Actively, proactively,

00:37:41.569 --> 00:37:46.191
that individuals can better go down these
courses and better understand what they are

00:37:46.191 --> 00:37:50.329
getting into. I think right now we, as you
say, look to our doctors to kind of guide

00:37:50.329 --> 00:37:57.309
us but the problem is that isn't the full
bevy of information that's out there. By necessity,

00:37:57.309 --> 00:38:01.799
they are a human filter, right? So we want
to be getting all the information but tailoring

00:38:01.799 --> 00:38:07.230
it to what our circumstances are so again,
that gets into the percentages of where do

00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:13.060
you fall, so to me that's an example of how
we need to be mindful of the fact that this

00:38:13.060 --> 00:38:14.760
is all probabilistic, that there are no sure
things.

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:20.519
&gt;&gt; So as long as I'm up here, I'm going to
follow up with one more,which is--.

00:38:20.519 --> 00:38:27.680
So my experience has indicated that even people
who are otherwise intelligent, have a high

00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:36.279
probability of being enumerate in that when
you present them with something like a statistical

00:38:36.279 --> 00:38:40.819
probability, even beyond just you know the
emotional impact of whatever is being talked

00:38:40.819 --> 00:38:47.260
about, death or debilitation, they are just
not able to understand the mathematics. They

00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:54.039
are not able to understand numbers, and What
are the best things that are being done right

00:38:54.039 --> 00:39:01.390
now in terms of medical information to present
those numbers in a way that is useful to the

00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:04.809
large percentage of people who don't really
see them as useful as numbers?

00:39:04.809 --> 00:39:10.220
Thomas Goetz &gt;&gt; Right, right. So one of the
answers is stuff like those predictive tools,

00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:14.930
those decision tools that I mentioned like
that Lifemath.net. So when you are able to

00:39:14.930 --> 00:39:20.510
process your information and make those statistics
more specifically about you rather than about

00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:26.170
a generic average. That's one gesture. There
are some specific things that people are doing.

00:39:26.170 --> 00:39:30.800
There is a wonderful project out of Dartmouth
University a couple of researchers are trying

00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:37.960
to develop tools that make, for instance,
drug facts much easier to understand, so following

00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:42.750
the footsteps of the nutritional information
label, that kind of box, they are developing

00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:48.480
a drug facts box where all that kind of fine
print of the side effects and the risks of

00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:54.190
a drug that none of us can ever understand.
The drug facts box that they propose reduces

00:39:54.190 --> 00:40:00.349
that to very simple terms of who is this drug
for, what are the potential risks, what are

00:40:00.349 --> 00:40:04.119
the potential side effects, and what are the
odds that it is going to work for you. It's

00:40:04.119 --> 00:40:10.150
these very clearly stated, clearly presentative
information that help people understand exactly

00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:13.369
the pros and cons of a drug, and they've done
studies that have shown that people are much

00:40:13.369 --> 00:40:17.720
more, when they are given information, information
in that form, they are much better able to

00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:22.410
parse the information. More broadly, there's
some great work being done here at Google

00:40:22.410 --> 00:40:25.950
among other places in information design,
right? We are actually, in my mind, we are

00:40:25.950 --> 00:40:30.809
entering this golden age of information design
where we're understanding how to use graphical

00:40:30.809 --> 00:40:37.970
presentation of information to help people
understand. There is a lot of, this goes to

00:40:37.970 --> 00:40:42.450
kind of the behavioral economics approach
on this, is that people are irrational, right?

00:40:42.450 --> 00:40:46.549
And they can't understand numbers and even
they tend to make bad decisions even when

00:40:46.549 --> 00:40:52.849
they are given the good information. I don't
entirely buy that, I agree that it exists

00:40:52.849 --> 00:40:59.609
as a kind of status quo, but I don't buy that
that's where things end. There are a lot of

00:40:59.609 --> 00:41:05.920
efforts such as what's happening at Dartmouth,
such as what's happening. There's this other

00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:10.359
researcher at Cornell called Valerie Reyna
and she's come up with this theory called

00:41:10.359 --> 00:41:15.970
The Fuzzy-trace Theory. The idea is that yes,
when we give people just cold hard numbers

00:41:15.970 --> 00:41:21.299
and we ask them to just engage rationally,
they tend to mess up. They tend to generally

00:41:21.299 --> 00:41:26.569
not understand the numbers, but when you give
them a kind of fuzzy sense of what the numbers

00:41:26.569 --> 00:41:30.760
mean, she calls it the gist, when you give
them the sense of the gist of the data, where

00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:35.289
they are able to kind of draw on their emotional
intuitive reasoning skills as well as their

00:41:35.289 --> 00:41:39.410
rational reasoning skills, they tend to make
much better decisions. And so to me, that's

00:41:39.410 --> 00:41:45.029
incredibly hopeful, that kind of research
that you know it isn't this kind of cold duality

00:41:45.029 --> 00:41:48.681
between our emotional/rational, emotional
and rational selves, but actually that you

00:41:48.681 --> 00:41:54.210
can kind of use both of our sides of the brain
and help people understand information. I

00:41:54.210 --> 00:42:10.460
think that that holds great promise.

00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:15.640
&gt;&gt; With this current generation, and I'm beyond
the current generation, but so many people

00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:19.390
are involved in games, interactive things
that are not only engaging but a lot of fun.

00:42:19.390 --> 00:42:29.609
And how important is fun going to be in involving
people in their own healthcare decisions and

00:42:29.609 --> 00:42:30.950
changing their behavior?

00:42:30.950 --> 00:42:36.009
Thomas Goetz &gt;&gt; That's a great question and
some of the people that are doing some innovative

00:42:36.009 --> 00:42:43.210
stuff about this like a local group called
Hope Lab. They are trying to develop games,

00:42:43.210 --> 00:42:48.680
video games, that help people kind of make
health decisions in a game format. Weight

00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:52.910
Watchers for instance, this point system,
a lot of people play it as a game, right?

00:42:52.910 --> 00:42:57.509
If you are kind of working the numbers and
trying to stay under your points for a day,

00:42:57.509 --> 00:43:02.920
it becomes a game. There is a lot of new research
that's showing that when you are able to kind

00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:07.930
of have people play and work towards goals,
that's one of the cool things about this data,

00:43:07.930 --> 00:43:12.890
right? It's your data, but you're able to
move the numbers and move the targets and

00:43:12.890 --> 00:43:20.279
kind of play with it. So this Fitbit that
I mentioned, you can go and read all the numbers

00:43:20.279 --> 00:43:23.900
and look at the graphs and your progress and
stuff like that, but it also has this very

00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:29.380
easy simple display of a flower that the more
you walk around, the more calories you burn,

00:43:29.380 --> 00:43:36.079
the taller the flower grows. It's a very simple
reward mechanism that is playful and I think

00:43:36.079 --> 00:43:44.930
those are really auspicious roots for helping
people engage in that way, but we need more

00:43:44.930 --> 00:43:53.170
of it. I mean, there is a lot of cool stuff
that could be done in that area.

00:43:53.170 --> 00:43:57.410
Alright, well thank you very much.
I appreciate all your time.

00:43:57.410 --> 00:43:57.510
