When I wake up the next day and I f I just feel like shit. I don't know why I keep doing it. It's a habit I have to break. I am a w I am a one and a half drink alcoholic. I have to have one and a half drinks and get a little buzzed every night. I want to go to a fucking AA meeting and say like, that's my problem. You know, I'll never forget when I started going off the rails when I, uh, I would have, I'd have one m mellow light tall in a can. And, uh, then I'd have a home pour of a whiskey and a, of course after I finished that, I would just stop and I'd go to sleep and the next day I'd wake up and I'd be totally functional and I'd go to work. But I, you know, I'd definitely be a little grouchy. And, uh, that's my story.

Speaker 1:          00:02:44       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:02:45       Okay. Thank you for sharing. Next guy comes up.

Speaker 2:          00:02:55       Right. They'd throw me out of there.

Speaker 2:          00:02:59       They'd be walking up, put down him donuts. I don't know why they all have southern accents in my world. Everyone in AA is from the south. You know why they never got over the war. They're still fighting it down there. South's going to rise again and do what? You're gonna succeed from the Union. You're going to get old stonewall Jackson, junior, junior, junior, Julia, to come back and take over for you. You know what I say to that? I say, good luck dye. Say Good fucking, you know, do it. Just know this. You can't have Florida and if you can't have Florida and you can't go to California, where are you going to take your kids?

Speaker 1:          00:03:38       Huh?

Speaker 2:          00:03:40       Well, they say I, you know when they did fucking sitting there watching your confederate TV,

Speaker 1:          00:03:46       right?

Speaker 2:          00:03:47       And it's a small world comes on, which is even more apropos, whatever the fuck you say it because you just like nine fucking states down there. Whatever the hell you are, right? It's a small world after all. And they're like, you want it? What do they call fathers down in a, what are the, what do they call did it? The GM dad. Oh, I want to go to Disney world. You can't because you seceded from the union. You can't go to Disney land and you can't go to his fucking world. You know what? You can go Talladega. You can go see the Winston Cup series. They got a water slide out there. I don't think they do. They've got a bunch of adults. Skip it around and fucking outfits that scare children. They do not. So let me tell you something fucking there. Mason diction, Mason and Dixon. Why don't you think twice? Think about everything you're going to lose out on a few seceded from the Union, Huh? No more Disneyland. No More Disney world

Speaker 2:          00:04:52       sea worlds down there. You don't get to see those fucking fish that don't want to be there. Yeah, I love that. People think like fish, like don't give a fuck that they're in the tank. You know? Just because they don't have an ability to speak to us that therefore that means they have to have fine with it. We treat fish like immigrants. You know the fish is fucking looking at you. You just like right English. You got a problem with that tank. Spit it out. Fucking sit there staring at me. Yeah, I was on the side of you fucking scaly head. Be happy I didn't eat you. You go get me one more time. I'll cut your fucking head off. I'll roll you into some flower with an egg wash and deep fry you motherfucker. And I'll make your friends watch.

Speaker 1:          00:05:47       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:05:48       Sit there and fucking stare at me like I work for you. I don't work for you. Who here is in a tank? I try. I didn't so I didn't think so. Um, anyways, um, Bill, why you show off the fucking walls today? You know why? Because I, we wrapped at least the script writing part of season two of f is for family, which means I get to go back to being a fucking 14 year old who has no fucking job, no responsibilities, no nothing, just a bunch of beers in my fridge that I'm slowly going to kill. I'll do the elliptical in the morning and then I give it all back with the can of beer and that's what I do right? While I fucking wear out my joints. That's all I'm really doing right now. I'm just maintaining. Um, isn't that what a lot of people in this digital age, you're just trying to do?

Speaker 2:          00:06:45       Aren't they just trying to maintain, just trying to keep their heads above water in this time of change and robots. Um, if they fucking does the election, has that happened yet? Jesus fucking, he ain't go near the Goddamn TV. Everybody's so fucking scared. Oh, it's going to happen. Nothing is going to continue on the way it's supposed to go. And whether the fucking comb-over or the clam gets in the house, it's going to go in the direction that the money wants it to go into. And if it doesn't, okay, they're going to Dallas. Right. And then not going to be in a Tesla. They're going to fucking roll out that 63 fucking stretch Lincoln convertible. That's right. Now you're gonna get the old right there, Fred to there. Fucking Jesus Christ, the two of them. You know what I mean? Their heads. You know what? If I was in secret service, there would be a head size that you could not be above, you know, or, or else the president would have to sign a waiver.

Speaker 2:          00:07:53       Just like, you know, both of them, Hillary and fucking in Trump, they have, they have like, like if you could make sliders out of Ted Kennedy's head, that's what the fuck they have. That is the most amazing thing about Ted Kennedy. He had the biggest fucking head out of all of them and he, nobody ever took them out. You know, you would think that that fucking guy out of all of them, they all had big squashes, right. You know, it's all good looking men do, right? You've got to have a big head, big stupid head with this squared jaw that look in your eye like everything's going to be okay. The kind of thing that make women go, oh, he could pay for all my stuff. Right. One of those heads, well, what's his face? Ted Kennedy was at of his time, no pun intended, right? If you want to know how fat people were gonna get, if you want to know how big sodas we're going to get, if you want to know how fucking ridiculous, you know, mcmansions and all this shit and all this stuff that we were going to by the age of consumerism, right?

Speaker 2:          00:09:01       If you were back in the 1950s trying to guess, you had to wage you, which way is it going to go? Are we going to go back to living on dirt floors and log cabins? Are we going to have kegerators and Fucking, uh, chocolate fountains in our houses? All you had to do is look at Ted Kennedy said it'd be like, there it is. That right there. That's an omen.

Speaker 1:          00:09:20       [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:09:22       you know the interesting thing about Ted Kennedy's had a, it was in his entire time he was alive. It was never backlit ever. People tried, they just was never enough light. You know, there's not even a picture of him like blocking out the fucking, like, not even the sun could reach around either side. It just became night. You walked outside. Hey, I'm saying he had a big head. You know, um, I've got a big head. I got a big kid. I do literally and figuratively. I get a giant head. I got a fucking ego and a half because I got the whole week off. And what am I going to do? I'm going to rest up getting ready for my European tour, like the red fucking headed whore than I am. And I'm gonna fucking Tuesday night I'm going to be at the Steve Allen Theater on Hollywood Boulevard, the boulevard of dreams.

Speaker 2:          00:10:19       Um, I'm going to be there and, uh, just basically saying my shit. So, you know, I just, I'll need to do is just fucking say it a few times, right? Just moderate to myself. Walk around the block, talk to myself, hands in my pocket, vigorously scratching the side of my ball sack. Right. Having the cops come by, having them pull over, asking me what I'm doing. Do I live around here? Are you a vagrant? I'm sorry. Did you guys see Rudy Giuliani speech about the police? Man. That was one of the funniest fucking things I've ever seen in my life. The way he was trying to get that crowd going. You know?

Speaker 4:          00:10:57       That's [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:10:59       all right. I wanted him to keep going. You know, he just basically distract, describe police officers jobs, but I wanted him to keep going and I wanted him to, to, to portray how wealthy he is and, and the influential friends that he has. You know, they come to house,

Speaker 4:          00:11:23       they say you're under arrest, but you have your lawyer made up in the driveway. They say Rodeo turned himself. The charges go away.

Speaker 2:          00:11:39       I wanted, I wanted him to go that far because here's the deal. You know, the way the police would be paid right now is fucking ridiculous. It's the same way, you know, if one comic sucks, then every fucking comic out there has a lampshade on the fucking head. You know what I mean? There's definitely some terrible people that are police officers, but that doesn't mean that they're all bad. Okay? Now, Rudy Giuliani, you can't fucking stand there where you exist in society with your skin color and think that you can accurately describe police officers. You know, and you need somebody a little more mid range. Well maybe it's good that he said that. Okay, now we got the high end right. Black people fucking said their end and then you just need somebody in the middle now. He still can't do it. You still can't do it because of racism.

Speaker 2:          00:12:28       You got to try to balance the whole fucking thing out. Um, I dunno. Hold on. Say Yeah, you think, you know, it'd be great with the, with the fucking cell phone cameras and then the cops filled themselves. What would be great is if somebody fucked up as a cop, if they actually got fired, if they actually fucking were punished and went to jail, they actually murdered somebody. Not like, you know, one or two or three people. If they'd actually just started doing that. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know if there's any fucking solution to it. You know what I mean? It's a hell of a fucking job to have when you've got to walk up to a fucking car, not knowing if you're going to get shot or not. That would make me a little edgy. You know what I mean? And I think a lot of cons can sit in there fucking led living room perfect when they're perfectly safe, being like, oh, you know what I wouldn't do? This is what I would've done. Right? Like when you watch your fucking quarterback throws an interception and then you say, oh, what had dumped it off to the tight end? Oh, is that what [inaudible] that's what you would've done on your fucking couch. [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:13:28       I think it's an impossible job. And I also think that's a, there's an element to that job that fucking statistics psychopaths are attracted to bouncers and all those things. There's a lot of people that just want to beat the shit out of people that go for that job. Then there's other ones that go there. They have their heart in the right fucking place, you know? But they don't really make the news, you know what I mean? It's kind of like comics. Like every night we tell jokes, nobody gets offended and then one cop gets fucking offended and then all of a sudden, is that what it's like bill? Somebody getting unarmed, somebody unarmed getting murdered is like somebody getting in trouble for Caitlyn Jenner joke. GI Bill. Thanks for fucking explaining that one. Dow. Fuck you. It's my podcast. Okay. I choose not to read. I choose not to be informed. That's my choice. Okay. I'm like one of those feminists, you know when they fucking start yelling about that. Oh, tell me what they do with my body. Right. Don't tell me what to do with my podcast. All right. No more podcasts shaming.

Speaker 2:          00:14:33       Oh Shit. I had the fucking greatest set I've had in fucking months. Saturday night at the comedy store in the main room, there was this chunk of material I've been trying to work out. I finally set it in a row the right way and then I came home. I was so confident of it. I played it for my wife and even she, and that's the deal. When you try something new, this is, this is, this is the litmus test. And I mean, know what the fuck that means. I don't even know if I'm saying it right. Litmus Lat, Miss Modal, right. My fucking test is I plan, play it for the lovely Nia. And if she fucking left, you can make your fucking wife get behind the new shit that you're doing. Then you know you're onto something. You know, because in general, what they do when they first meet you, they are like, oh my God, you're amazing. Oh they just fucking pump you up, right? So you start going like, whoa, she's really cool man. Right? And then once they get you,

Speaker 4:          00:15:30       okay,

Speaker 2:          00:15:31       once you fucking in the relationship, once you give him the ring and you get married, then they fucking just grabbed the reigns and shot. You ain't going back. Whoa. Wow. Right. They start yakking the fuck back now cause they're jerks. It's just out of fear.

Speaker 4:          00:15:48       Hmm.

Speaker 2:          00:15:49       He's going to do something new. He's gonna find something new. He's going to find somebody new. That's what they do. Unlike guys, everybody knows that men are totally secure with who they are.

Speaker 5:          00:16:04       Okay?

Speaker 2:          00:16:05       I'm just doing this right now for any guy who's listening to this podcast next to a woman just to listen to her going, oh my God, how could you Ms. Guy such an idiot? Let me tell you something lady. All right. And don't look at him right now cause he's not saying this. I'm talking to you sweetheart. In the background, shaking your fucking head. It's your man who's gonna die before you let him have his labs. Okay? What you feel right fucking now is what a man feels when he comes home and you're walking, you're watching those botox squawk and fucking whores. Okay? Doing the recap of their fucking season with that Andy Cohen or whatever his name is, that fucking genius. He's like bs. Like the Gay Byron Allen. You know where they just found a show where there was no shelf. Everybody was like this no show here.

Speaker 4:          00:16:59       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:16:59       and the genius of that guy to be like, yes there is.

Speaker 4:          00:17:03       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:17:04       it's not enough. Did you got a bunch of screaming hordes yelling at each other that someone's going to sit down and watch it every fucking night. The fact that he then does the recap, it just sits there. You don't have to write anything new. They do it for you. He just sits there in effortlessly host the show. He's a master.

Speaker 4:          00:17:24       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:17:24       He just sits, yes. Is this fucking setlist like a comic? But all it is is to get these women yelling at each other and he just, he just, just watch the brilliance of that man. He just fucking sits there and if it's, if it's fucking Samarin he turns up the heat, you know, you know, in episode four, Kathy, she, she had some choice words in the moment. That's all he has to say. Oh my God. When she called me a fucking con and then she goes and he just fucking lays back like Ali. Right. And when he was fighting George Foreman. And he just lets these women start fucking punching each other out and they run off set and he sits there and this is the brilliance of this man, is he sits there and he actually has a look on his face. Like he truly gives a fuck.

Speaker 2:          00:18:14       Like he actually gives a shit about these people. He's just sitting here going, that's a great TV. And we go, that just sold some toothpaste and he's just fucking raking it. And look at the guy, he looks like 1 million bucks. A lot of people don't know this about that man. He's 83 fucking years old. You know, everybody talking about Dick Clark, how great he looked right to the fucking end. Yeah. Well close to the end that I should've said that, but fucking, you know, whatever. We all go out like that. Right. But um, he's fucking 83 a lot of people don't know that. You think that guy was like, you know, like whatever. What, 37 I have no fucking idea.

Speaker 6:          00:18:52       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:18:52       There's gotta be people hosting real shit that's fucking difficult going. Why the fuck didn't I just do that?

Speaker 6:          00:18:57       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:18:59       What he is is he's doing a sophisticated Jerry Springer. You know, everybody's sitting down, there's no punches thrown. They scream and yell. They cross their legs. This is the one thing I'll say about the real housewives. They're fucking legs are incredible. It's fucking amazing. Their legs are like fucking 22 year olds, their fucking faces. Whoo. You know, Jesus Christ, and I got a lot of fucking nerve saying this. Considering the way I look, considering the way I traveled the world, looking like an albino balding Hellboy minus the working out. Right. I look like the thing. If it was skinny and didn't have that skin disease, you know what I mean? But yet could not go out in the sun. That's what I am. I'm a middleweight thing minus whatever. What's it may not have come on. Come on. Comic cons. You know what he's made out of, you know, he turned into that.

Now he's a fast aunt living in somebody's fucking head, you know, driving a jet ski down to Middle Earth. Jesus Christ. Yes. When you think just when you fucking think that the real housewives is the dumbest fucking thing you're ever gonna Watch, they come out with another stupid fucking superhero movie.

Speaker 4:          00:33:21       Cool.

Speaker 2:          00:33:22       Did you, well, did you, um, Lewis Hamilton wins again? Nico Rosberg came in second and now Lewis Hamilton. That's the, that's the fifth time he won that race and I learned that, uh, he passed our Craig shoemaker stand up comedian and legendary. A fucking f one driver. No, Michael Schumacher. Um, every four, every other Grand Prix drivers. Sounds like the, the guitarist and Scorpions and the Scorpions, I should say. Um, you always fucked up about that. Tran. I don't know shit about this sport. It's just seem whoever was in first like, like the race was to the first turn and then it was just fucking over you. You couldn't get past anybody, you know, who is that fucking lunatic zigzag and behind the red bull. Huh? Going back and forth, he cut off the front of his fucking car. Was it Sebastian Vettel was at Max per stopping.

Speaker 7:          00:34:22       Ladies and gentlemen.

Speaker 2:          00:34:31       Um, Kimmy Raikkonen was the driver of the day. I've, he was in like in fucking 90th place and he moved up to like seventh to some shit. Uh,

Speaker 2:          00:34:42       [inaudible] heads. It's warm. It's race for fourth was really entertaining, but I didn't like how that, you know, there was no way for fucking Nico to even try to pass Lewis. Once he got out in front, that fucking track, it was just, you know, kind of stunk. Like Lewis Hamilton was just driving around and right. The whole fucking time. And you know, they would just show in like the race for fourth and fifth and third and fourth. And then like they were on the final lap and it was so fucking boring out front. They was still back, you know, watching that Guy Zigzag. Hey Formula One fans, I don't understand where they, I like the fucking rules. Well Bill, why don't you look them up? Well, it's easier to ask you guys. It's also funny or if I talk about them and I don't know what I'm talking about, I don't get out when the guy who cut off the front of his car, right. One of the fucking fins. I did find it funny that they were like, yeah, people do that all the time and it doesn't affect the performance of the car. Um, doesn't seem to anyways, um, where they was saying you were only allowed to make one move, like you went to the right and then he came back to the left and then back to the right. And that was considered more than one move. And I was just like, what the fuck? You can't do that.

Speaker 2:          00:35:50       I thought I left this behind with the NFL season you this is like, you know, he's got to make a football move. That fucking guy, when he tried to go around, the other dude didn't do anything that I don't do when I'm on the highway, when I'm behind some fucking Douche driving too fucking slow in the left lane, right?

Speaker 4:          00:36:09       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:36:09       Oh, you know what [inaudible] and I'm in the, I'm in the second to left lane. Right. And there's some guy driving medium speed and then somebody doing that just making a wall. And I'm like, what the fuck? What the fuck? What the fuck? What the fuck? And then you go around to the right.

Speaker 4:          00:36:21       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:36:21       Coming around now when I watched the race, it was Lewis Hamilton, then Rosberg and I remember it was a red bull, then a Ferrari, then a red bull, then a Ferrari. And then today it's saying red bull, Ferrari, Ferrari, red bull. So did somebody get penalized? It's fucking unreal. I don't get it. Like, it's, there's always like, after the fucking, Oh, you thought you won the race, but, uh, somebody said something in ta, don't shift into seventh gear. And they're like, oh, you can't do that. Don't tell him what he shouldn't do. You know, he's only driving a car at 200 fucking miles an hour. One guy spun up, that was it. There wasn't really any crashes or anything like that, but it was funny. I'm actually totally into it. My wife can't stand it. She says when I have it on, it sounds like a bunch of bees flying around, but um, it's still fucking coolest shit.

Speaker 2:          00:37:15       Although that, I dunno, that was probably of all the races I've watched, that's been my least favorite. Um, just because there was all this, like the, the, the start of the race was the most exciting and then it was just a bunch of people in the back trying to go around people and they couldn't do it except for Kimmy. Raikkonen the flying Finn evidently see the flying Finn. I have no fucking idea. Um, anyways, but this is really getting me through the fucking dog days of baseball. I fucking love baseball, but I just, you know, I can't get into it in July and August. I like it in April, you know, into May. You start seeing what's going to happen and then I just fucking veg out. June, July, August, the same way the players do, right? They're just standing up there like, dude, what the fuck? How many fucking games do you have to play in the regular season before we know who deserves to win the division hundred and 62 five. Isn't that, isn't that insane?

Speaker 4:          00:38:12       [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:38:13       that has to be, if you're going to own a professional team, that's gotta be the sport to do it. 162 home games. If your teams selling out the Ballpark, Jesus Christ, those things have to be, I've got to look this up right now. Look at this. I'm actually going to do research professional. See, I know franchises.

Speaker 1:          00:38:39       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:38:40       I should have put sports in there right now. If suddenly going to be fucking talking to being about McDonald's worth the most.

Speaker 1:          00:38:49       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:38:52       Okay. Well, this is everything. Okay. The Dallas cowboys, for whatever reason, are worth $4 billion. Real Madrid, I'm guessing is some sort of football club in Spain is where? Three point $7 billion and then there's another one in Barcelona. Is that also Spain? 3.6 billion. The New York Yankees. There you go. Well that makes sense that like a world football as we call it, soccer would be worth that much money cause that's, that really is when you're winning a world championship, you're winning the World Cup. You're playing against the fucking world, right? It's like an Olympic medal, except you get paid a, then the New York Yankees, 3.4 billion, then man United 3.3 billion. Oh, and then the New England patriots. Everybody's favorite fucking team to hate on 3.2 billion. Then the New York Knicks. What? 3 billion.

Speaker 1:          00:39:58       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:39:58       Jesus Christ. No New York. I'll tell you, that's a fixer upper right. That New York, nextera. A fucking tear down. Oh, this is weird man. Then the Washington Redskins, 2.9 billion

Speaker 8:          00:40:12       invaluable sports team in the world. The NFL. [inaudible] this year's list by force.

Speaker 2:          00:40:16       Shut up.

Speaker 8:          00:40:17       We're feeling good dollars.

Speaker 2:          00:40:18       I hate when this happens. Yeah. Now you've got to figure out where the fuck the voice is coming from.

Speaker 8:          00:40:24       Rankings in 2011 that he soccer.

Speaker 2:          00:40:27       Shut up. Oh, there it is.

Speaker 1:          00:40:29       All right.

Speaker 2:          00:40:32       All right. The Redskins are worth 2.9 billion. Then the giants are 2.8 building, building billion. Then the Lakers a 2.7 the Lakers are worth less than the Knicks. If anything says that this state is going to fall into the ocean one day, it's the fact that the fucking nicks are with more fucking money than the fucking Lakers. Jesus Christ. What are the Celtics worth? Oh my God. Rappaport's gonna fucking love that. Well, you know something that actually makes sense because you know when you move to Manhattan, you fuck. Can you fucking let me get to the site? I hate when fucking sites do this. They just got to suck the fucking information out of you, Forbes, to give you my fucking email. What so time magazine can start fucking spam and me. I don't think so. Why Hillary Clinton should be thankful. Election is not today. I don't know why is there pantsuits all in the fucking dry cleaners.

Speaker 2:          00:41:36       All right, let's uh, let's, let's do sway of where am I? How much time have I done? 41 minutes. You know, some days it feels like work other days that doesn't, um, you know, I've become obsessed with as of last night is, is uh, you know, I've been doing this grip strength thing and I've been fucking doing great man. I can go up a pegboard now at 48 years of age. I can go up a climbing rope leaving my skinny fucking Alabaster fucking albino legs just dangling like a fucking, I don't know, couple of appendixes, right? Jesus. I never had to make that plural. Appendix. Appendix is, um, tits. Today's

Speaker 1:          00:42:20       um,

Speaker 2:          00:42:22       yeah, cause you know what? I got those, those atomic fucking holds. Those motherfuckers better send me some free shit. I'm sick of hyping those guys up, but they, they shit, they are the shit. So now I want to be able to do one of those, is it called a front lever or a front lever? Um, and I watched this guys a youtube video. I'll, I'll repost it. The six easy steps, eh, hey, lovely mia to being able to do a front lever.

Speaker 1:          00:42:47       Um,

Speaker 2:          00:42:49       did you hear about Paula Abdul? No. What? She's, she's a singer and she was a Laker girl.

Speaker 1:          00:43:01       [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:43:02       Paul Abdul at the national job. No, I have to eat my cereal. Oh, okay. I just brought you some of this. Thank you. Come over onto the Mike. Mike. Mike Baby Dude. Why did you do that? About Paula Abdul. Um, cause I love Paula Abdul. I know I liked Megan. I had to pick someone, you know, if I was like, yeah, go. Did you hear about Paula Abdul? Like that's not funny. What is funny? It is funny. And you're going to sit there and act like you're not going to do it to me. That's true. Who would you pick? Hmm? One of your rock icons probably, you know, kind of helps you pick a name. Well, I can't tell you because then it's not going to be a surprise when I do it right? No, it isn't because you already told me you're going to do it. See what I did there?

Speaker 2:          00:43:51       Uh Oh yeah, I guess, but I can flip it. I don't know. It's, it's the morning still here. Drink some of your juice. I brought it for you. Oh thank you. Well I got to do a podcast if you don't mind just journey right now though. No, I people give me shit cause I try not to drink on the mic, but I have to hold the microphone. Just take a sip. All right. Then talk to them while I drink it. Okay. So on my snapchat last night, if you guys follow me on Snapchat, I made my fresh squeeze watermelon juice and I'm giving it to bill. Who loves a wow. He's taking it down like a champ. You give me anything in this glass? I suck it down. Just like my, my juice. I drink at night. Daddy's Madison, Daddy's medicine. Um, all right, I gotta get back to the podcast, Nia.

Speaker 2:          00:44:36       Okay. Alrighty. All right. Okay. What you're talking about, um, I don't really know. This has just been one of these stream of conscious stays. Um, that's their whole podcast. I've talked about some lady with a basket on her head trying to get water once she fought off a cobra. I do remember that. And I also talked about how big the heads are of the people running for president and how I'd be concerned if I was the head of security. Okay. What else? That's all I can remember. Oh, riveting. Okay. All right, I'll see you. Hey neenee do you hear about Lady Gaga?

Speaker 2:          00:45:17       She had a meat dress. Alright, let's get to some of the questions here. Um, oh yeah. So I became obsessed with the, uh, that front lever and uh, this guy has a six step thing on how to do it cause I always wanted to be able to do the human fucking flag. You know, that's just a great thing to be able to do if you're not a gymnast. Cause people just expect you to be able to do it. But if you just like a dad, you've got a couple of kids, you know, you fucking into roofing now that's a physical job. Whatever you fucking build. I don't know. It just be something just funny to do that day that you could actually fucking do that. Just weird people out. Um, you know what that reminds me, I wanted to do a bit on these fucking crossfit people, but I just feel like it's just too hacky and every comics going to have a bid on it.

Speaker 2:          00:46:07       So what, what's, why do these crossfit people, why do they have to like work out in the gym and outside? Why is, it's just so fucking, look at me. We're working out. I work out too. I work out my garage with the fucking door closed. It's the most narcissistic shit you ever see when they just like did fucking run down the street with like a goddamn fucking tire behind them. Right. Somebody show me a picture of a guy doing that. Every tweeted it right. Running down the street, dragging a tire. When you just run up a hill, you fucking moron, you know? Oh cause the tire adds more difficulty when they've run up the hill more times. Increase your reps, you stupid. Fuck well what do you train in for the standards? I was fucking somewhere in Santa Monica. These fucking jerk offs. It's like 10 of them outside and they've got, you know when they got the double fucking ropes, that thing that they do that, the only reason you really need to do that is if you're fighting in the UFC.

Speaker 2:          00:47:11       They're the only people who seem to need to have to do that. Then everybody else wants to be in UFC shape without having to actually have the balls to get in the octagon. All right, so fucking dumb. And the, or even when they're inside, there's like down the street, there's one from me, it's like this giant garage and they just have it open. Like, look at us. We're crossfitting. I talked to Nia about and she was saying like, yeah, it was like all the rage to be on one of those social media things and like, oh I did, you know, take filming yourself, working out Hashtag crossfit. It's just, I dunno when I was a s when I was a kid, if you wanted people to look at you, you got into show business. Okay? You became a male stripper. You told jokes, you joined a band. You know now these fucking assholes that they're making a bunk cake and they got like fucking 80,000 fucking hits and everybody's walking around with the same arrogance that I have. It's, it's not fair people I earned, I earned my Eric, it's um, I'm fucking with you. You want to work outside. You want to run down the street with a fucking tire behind you.

Speaker 1:          00:48:22       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:48:23       You know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:48:25       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:48:26       I don't quite understand when to apply the white privilege thing because I am white and who's kidding who I am one of the widest of all time. You know what I mean? I would say Hitler would not be disappointed if I walked into his office, but I think the red hair, I think I might be out.

Speaker 1:          00:48:44       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:51:34       I've got a, I got a film studies class with one of those pretentious fucking professors that wears young kid clothes to come off cooler than he really is. Yeah. You know what that means? He's gonna fuck us, don't it? I love movies. I've seen plenty of them. That's the reason why I'm taking this class. Well, that's great. Gravitate towards you what you want. Every time before we watch a movie in this class, the professor asks us to raise our hands if we've seen it before. I raised my hand almost every time that I look around to see if anyone else is raising their hand. They rarely are. Sure I'm a nerd. I've seen the fucking movies. Maybe if he didn't play the most standard choices, like Cassa blanket and shit, I wouldn't raise my hand every time. Look at that. You like movies, you're doing your homework, you taking a class on it, you're gravitating towards what you want. Very nice. All right. So anyway, I was just recently hired. I was just recently hired on an employee.

Speaker 2:          00:52:32       Dude, you're killing me. I just recently hired on as an employee. You left out the ass at my theater. Um, who also happens to be a student of my film studies Pref. Oh, you went by an employee. So anyway, I just recently, I was just recently hired by an employee at my theater who also happens to be a student of my film studies professor, but in a different class at a different school. I think I conveyed what you were trying to say that as a joke. One day I asked the kid, so does Mr So-and-so ever talk shit about our class? The kid looks me square in the eye and says, yeah, actually he does. Doctor So-and-so says there's this one kid in your, your your all's class, you mean y'alls class? Who always raises his hand when he asks if he's seen the movie.

Speaker 2:          00:53:25       But really he probably hasn't. And then he looks around the run and makes sure everyone is looking at him to know he's seen the movie before. That's hilarious. This guy's getting insecure. You're making your teacher insecure. So now he's got a Jesus. That's probably why he's wearing the young people's clothes. He's talking shit about the other class to make himself seem cool. Ah, this guy's a fucking, this guy's a bitch. I don't like this teacher. He goes, so there we go. This guy talks shit about me to his other classes when all I'm doing is gently raising my hand after being asked if I've seen the movie or not. In any other case, I'd probably just confront him about this, but I don't want to risk failing the class. There's something petty like that. Am I overthinking this? What should I do here? I'd walked right up to the guy.

Speaker 2:          00:54:14       I just want, who gives a fuck this fucking insecure comment? He'll probably give you a better grade cause what does need to be like? Just walk right up to him. But yeah. Listen man, uh, there seems to be some confusion on your part that you seem to be trying to work out with the other class as to why I raised my hand every time I happen to love movies, I work at a movie theater. Okay. And I've seen all these movies and I look around just to see if anybody else has seen the movies. Cause I love movies and I want to talk to people about movies if he don't want me to keep, you know, raising my hand. Stop doing this paint by numbers. Basic Horse Shit movies that you keep picking. What are you going to have next week? Days of Duh. Huh?

Speaker 1:          00:54:58       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:55:00       You've given me shit. You're going to come in here. Dress like you could go into a fucking, yeah. One of the young kids listened to, I used to just go see the weekend. Is that the right thing? Who's the other guy? Who's the rapper who won all the fucking grammys? Kendrick Lamar. I know who they are. I don't, I know a few of their songs.

Speaker 1:          00:55:21       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:55:22       I know the weekends CD starts off going right.

Speaker 7:          00:55:24       Wait [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:55:32       you can actually play the beginning of the weekend. I think rednecks do it as much as they probably don't like your skin color. They probably play that when they're out. Duck hunting to try to get the young ducks. You know, we're into all this fucking, um, I'm fucking with you. I'm a fan of the weekend. I wasn't rattled a little [inaudible] that anyway, it was hard to write that last y'all guy little Apollo. All right, I'm a Billy calorie count. Thoughts on Melissa Muck. Kathy getting flack for losing weight. Uh, all right, my first thought, I'm Melissa McCarthy. I did a movie with her a number of years ago was called the heat directed by Paul Feig starring Melissa McCarthy, Sandra Bullock. And that's where I first met, uh, Michael Rappaport, you know, um, dropping names all over the place and she is truly one of the most naturally funny fucking hilarious human beings I have ever met and she's an absolute sweetheart. Um, so anyways, I didn't realize people would give him, why would you give somebody flagged for losing weight? Aren't you supposed to say, hey, great job, good for you.

Speaker 10:         00:56:38       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:56:39       You know. Anyway. Say people are saying she's doing it because of Hollywood pressures. That's so fucking dumb. All right. Yeah. People are just add, isn't it? That's not what it is. It's, it's, it's, it's the same towny mentality. When you're, you're finally deciding that, you know, wearing your football jacket and continuing to drink in the local bar, you want more out of life and then all a gong call forgetting a part also. What do you think is smart now? Like all of them, they don't want to see her get her shit together. You know, misery loves fucking company. You know, they would stay here and be out of shape. Good for her. Fucking assholes. What kind of an asshole? When somebody makes a positive move in their life, tries to make it negative. Well me, I'm a comedian. I do that all the time. But besides people like me anyways, these people who always say you should be comfortable in your own body, no matter what you look like, completely ignore basic information like clogged arteries and such.

Speaker 2:          00:57:35       Absolutely. Maybe Melissa Carte McCarthy doesn't want to die of a heart attack because she wants to meet her grandchildren's one day I lost 30 pounds since listening to you fat. Shame everyone. I honestly didn't know I was getting fat. I was never fat ever. But then three years in an office job in college, I'm 24 I put on the gross 30. I recently lost. Yeah Dude. At 24, man, you are headed towards being, you are going to die if you are 30 pounds overweight at 24 that is not a good thing. So congratulations. Anyways, he said I feel a thousand times better. I never looked fat because I'm a tall guy and I carry it well. So I never heard anything from anyone. I did it on my own for myself. These fat defenders are ignorantly judging and assuming thoughts on this. Also, when the fuck do we get to see your gym video, I want to see your pasty legs dangling from a pull up bar like meat hanging in a locker.

Speaker 2:          00:58:27       Ah, you fucking cuts. Uh, no. This is the thing about this business. Uh, the only pressure that it is as far as I'm concerned, the only pressure in this business is what you x. You as an individual choose to accept. All right? And everybody does it to a certain point when you first get into entertainment because you don't know what the fuck you're doing. You come into this business with your hat in hand, you're like, I'll sweep the floors, I'll do whatever you want. Just give me stage time. I'll, I'll drive to another state to do five minutes for no money for $5 gas money. We all do that shit. Um, but at some point you then have to put a value on what the fuck it is you're doing, right? And then you start getting paid. Then what happens is you're like going, fuck.

Speaker 2:          00:59:15       You know, you know, you get in this business, it takes a while to get going and everybody starts creeping into 30. So you start freaking out going, oh, what is, what is the industry casting? What are they looking at? What is the blah, blah, Blah and all that type of shit. Okay. Now, a lot of people do not ever get past that because they don't put a value on that talent. And I'm not even talking monetarily. This is just my own belief system. You have to believe that you have something to say that you know, you know, you can't be married to the results. You just gotta do that Zen thing. Like I'm talking about this shit, I'm doing this and like take me all right? I came in and the business, all right, a fucking redheaded con male, you know? So from day one, there's not going to be a lot of rules for me.

Speaker 2:          01:00:07       There's not a lot of redheaded male leads and shit. You know, I'm the friend, right? That's the deal. That's how it works. The Red Ed and male is not the fucking cool guy. So to make matters worse, I started losing my fucking hair and I was like, ah, fuck. Now what do I go out and get plugs and all that shit and just one day, right? You know, Neil was just, just bus your fucking head down. And I was just like, and I just came to this epiphany of just like, yeah, Bill, why are you walking around like you losing your fucking hair is a big deal. Does that mean you're not funny anymore? Does that mean you know, what were you going to be the next Brad Pitt if you kept your fucking hair right? And then I just said, yeah, fuck it. So then I did it and this and I ever since I had the philosophy of basically this is what I look like and this is what I do.

Speaker 2:          01:01:00       If you want to book me, thank you. If you don't, I understand. The second I went into that mindset, I never fucking stressed again. So I really think that all that whole, you know, the pressures of fucking Hollywood is, I understand that when you're young, but as you're getting older you have to fucking, it really has nothing to do with Hollywood. I also, I think it has more to do with, you know, why you got into this business, you know, the self-loathing, you know, and not liking yourself. I think, and I have to tell you a, this past weekend I watched Allie Wong special and um, it was so fucking great. And I was sitting there with my wife and I was saying like what I loved. She went out there and it just was, she was fucking original. All of us stuff was just, it was just fucking, it was just a great set.

Speaker 2:          01:01:56       It was worthy like this, it really was a standup special. And you know, she's, she went out there, you know, and everybody's making a big fucking deal that like, because she was pregnant that she did it. Oh my goodness. All these fucking questions. And I understand why they did that. Cause no one's ever done that. But there should be more questions about how great the material was. But I was saying to my wife when I was watching this, I go, you see this? She had a special to do and she didn't give a fuck that she was pregnant and she just walked out and then she owned it. And now what she's done is she's established herself that now she can just basically do whatever the fuck she wants. She wants to have another kid. She can literally go on tour while pregnant because she's established that this is who I am.

Speaker 2:          01:02:45       This is what I'm doing. I'm married, I'm starting to fucking family and I'm writing killer jokes. This is what I'm doing now. All these fucking feminist who sit there going alien again. Hollywood love, let you be pregnant. I would argue your giving them way too much fucking power. Way Too much power. Just go out. If every fucking woman out here just started getting pregnant cause they wanted to and continue to go on auditions, the whole fucking business would adjust. You, make it adjust to you rather than the other fucking way around. And um, if you haven't seen her special, you know, you know, a lot of the hype on it is the fact that she did at seven months pregnant. But I'm telling you, just as, uh, someone who still f you know, as long as I've been doing this, a huge fan of standup comedy, you know, um, it's the jokes of a fucking killer.

Speaker 2:          01:03:37       The subject matter, all of it. It was just like, you know, God knows it's a Zillion fucking specials out there, but you know, every once in awhile, you know, someone comes out like with, with that, that was, that was one of the best ones I've seen in awhile. So, um, I guess I would tie all of that back into that. It's like, I would say that she's losing weight. Yeah. She's married, she's got kids and who the fuck doesn't want to lose weight? I'm trying to lose weight. No one wants to walk around being overweight. It's not fun. Your life is easier. And people who, uh, give a shit about that, I would just say, you know, I feel bad for them because I know they don't want to be out of shape too. You know? I mean [inaudible] like being proud to be out of shape. That's like being proud to be like a fucking alcoholic, you know, you know you've got issues. You, your fucking heart isn't fucking excited that you're overweight. Like, that's right.

Speaker 2:          01:04:33       Every pound of fat is five miles of capillaries. You know, you get 20 pounds overweight, your heart's got to fucking go an extra hundred miles every fucking beat. You stupid. It's not, it's not a good thing to be doing. So congratulations to her. Um, and you know, I'm struggling right now to lose fucking weight. Oh, I'll tell you, it's not easy. Well, Billy booze bag. All right. A Christian girls sexual boundaries. Hey Billy Bo Berman. I listen to all your specials multiple times and really loved the advice segments you do on your podcast. I'm back home for the summer from my first year of college and I'm hooking up with this six to 10. Chris, what? Oh six out of 10 Christian girl the last couple of months of school. I barely even just retained any of that cause I was hoping everything that I said came off as positive. And that last thing, um, anyway, let me reread this. I've listened to all your saying that the dad back for the summer. Okay. I'm hooking up with this girl, this six out of 10 Christian girl, the last couple months of school. The encounter is basically consisted of me aggressively finger bla Jeez. Easy finger blasting her to quench her sexual deviancy. Oh, I love how you're just fucking innocent in all this and her giving my, Oh, okay. Okay. Oh, this is a woman rightness and hurricanes are given my carpet. A midnight snack.

Speaker 2:          01:06:01       What? Oh No, this is a guy. Why are you saying your carpet? Giving my carpet a midnight snack while jerking me off. You lost me in that one. What is your carpet? Your pubes. What does the snack cause you come on yourself. I don't even know what's going on here. Anyway, she's a devout Christian so she won't get involved with oral sex or anything further a, the thing is her idea of boundaries are pretty, uh, a morphous. I don't know what that means. Nah, you fucking asshole. Now I gotta look, you know what, actually keep doing this. Maybe I'll get smart one day. A morphous amorphous without a clear, defined shape or form. How did I never hear that? My whole fucking life? There's so many fucking words in English language and then they always say that, but we use like 19 of them. Four of them are curse words. All right? She's begged me to pleasure her with the hilt of my screwdriver. Dude, are you from another century? What the fuck is a hilt? Is that the handle? Don't know why I even had one at college and jerk me off onto her face when we took a late night sleepover shower together.

Speaker 2:          01:07:23       Ah, yeah, but that's not really a facial when the water's right there. You know what I mate, that's like, you know, you're going to run, you're going to go walk on some hot rocks and you just fucking do a running leap and touch one for half a second. You keep going, right? She's also into being, it's like picking up dog shit with the little fucking plastic bag around your hand. You know, you're still touching dog shit, but you feel the warmth of it. But you know, there's a boundary there. Uh, she's also into being choked and tied up to her. Jesus fucking Christ up during dry humping. Apparently that stuff's still Christian enough for her. I've had sex a few times before this. Cute. Why are you judging this girl so harshly? All right. This is this religion thing. This is where she's at. Just fucking relaxed.

Speaker 2:          01:08:02       It seems like you having a hell of a time because I had sex a few times before this girl and know that even protected fucking is infinitely more pleasurable than outsource masturbation. My question to you is, do you think she'll ever realize how ridiculous it is to take a load on her face but not accept kind of Linkous will she ever want premarital sex? I know I should go to a gym, lose this girl, get some sleep and take advantage of the pussy Colosseum. That is my universe camp, university campus, but I'm lazy and want to fuck the low hanging fruit. What can I do to convince her that college, sexist, natural, wholesome. It would make her feel incredible. Thanks so much and go fuck yourself. I would say, you should let this girl go because a, you don't have any feelings for you using as a, you're using her as a fucking blow up doll.

Speaker 2:          01:08:50       You just say, you know, I know I should go meet some other people, but this girl's an easy fucking sex hookup. Um, I dunno, I mean, meantime, is she getting feelings for you? Because if you just sitting there hanging around waiting to be able to fuck her, so then you can then leave, um, you're already saying she's a six out of 10. That's, that doesn't sound like you have feelings for her. So I'd let her go. I'd let her go and I'd find some girl then just, and just let them know, you're young, so I'm not judging you here. What you got to do early on, and this is what nobody ever tells young men, it's just just out of the gate. Tell women what the deal is. All right.

Speaker 2:          01:09:34       Because believe it or not, they can have fun. We eat. They don't flip out when you just say, yeah, there's no way I'm going to marry you. You know, if you say it right from the beginning, the second you meet them, right? If you're not feeling anything but you're just attracted to them, just tell them that and just fucking let them, you know, work that out. And maybe they're in the same place you are and they just want to fuck. They don't want to have a relationship. But if you get into that type of a situation, you've got to make sure that you, you got to have like, you know, you fuck and then you don't call each other or talk or do anything else. You do not hang out and there's gotta be at least 10 days between the fucking hookups or, or somebody starts failing something and then it's a fucking mess.

Speaker 2:          01:10:23       Or they get jealous cause you with somebody else. So whatever. You know what I mean? And this is what you fucking say from day one. You, you tell him that. All right, let's deal, we're going to hook up anything you ever wanted to fucking do. You can do with me. You're not going to get judged. You have to worry about getting judged because it is what it is. Right? And then that's it. We don't call each other. This is what we just fucking use each other for this. Anytime you're feeling already, if you're not in a fucking relationship, I don't give a shit if you date other people, believe it or not. If you come out of the gate with that Shit, you would be surprised how many women are also looking for that. It's a great fuck fuck buddy is. It's the greatest thing ever.

Speaker 2:          01:11:03       Greatest fucking thing ever. It's like having fucking, I don't know, free tickets to Disneyland. You get to ride all the fucking rides. You know you've got VIP parking. It's like ordering a pizza. It's tremendous. And you know what? Women also order a pizza, if you know what I mean. So have fun with that. But let this girl go, man. All right. First Time flying at 30 years of age. Hey, they have Billy the ginger bats. Just want to say I've been a huge fan for over 10 years and have loved every special you had. Well, thank you very much. I'm 30 I've never been on a plane and heights kind of freaked me out to top it off. My flight is on nine 11 and makes two stops in between here, Connecticut in Chicago. I'm going there for my job and I'd really hate to miss out on the opportunity.

Speaker 2:          01:11:51       Basically, I'm just looking for advice and how to not freak out and look like a fucking idiot on the plane. Seeing as how you've had so much experience flying, I'd figured you'd be a good person to talk to. Thanks and go fuck yourself. Um, yeah. It's no big deal. It's completely safe and uh, you know, you're going to be fine. This is the deal. You're going to go up there, right? This is what you do. Get on the plane and then just say to the person next to you yet, believe it or not, this is the first time I've ever flown, hopefully not next to a douche. If they'd seem open, just tell them that. All right. But to believe me, you're not going to, if you ever just stomped on the gas when you've been driving a car and you just get back in your seat, it's just sorta like that and then you fucking up in the air and it's the coolest thing ever.

Speaker 2:          01:12:35       It's fucking great. And you're going to go from fucking Connecticut to Chicago in like fucking two seconds. You know, we got two stops there. Okay, well that's cool. Be Fun, you know, then you'll be a veteran by the end of it and yeah, welcome to the, uh, the, the fucking 21st century. You're going to be fine. Um, what I would say is, you know, just, uh, make sure you eat well before you go to the airport, you know, maybe bring some food to go onto the plane, you know, because the food and the plane sucks. It's fucking overpriced and that type of thing. And uh, you know, that's the only thing I would say. Other than that, you have nothing to worry about. It's going to be great. Get a fucking window seat too, if you can. That's the best, you know, first time you fly, you get to look down.

Speaker 2:          01:13:20       Um, it's actually pretty incredible to be doing that at 30 years of age cause you can actually take it in. You know, I came the first time I flew, I was so young that I don't ever have that. Like, oh, this is what it looks like from the fucking year. Um, you'll be fine. All Right William, I've been dating my girls. This is the last one. And then I gotta I gotta get off my day here of doing absolutely nothing. William William, I've been dating my girl for a few years now and everything started out great. However, over the course of the past few months, I've noticed a sudden change in her behavior and was wondering if he's dealt with anything like this before. Yeah. She's either using drugs or fucking someone else. Um, or she's depressed. I'm fucking with you. Let me read the rest of this. Basically when we hang out lately, she just won't stop asking questions.

Speaker 2:          01:14:00       She may ask, what are you listening to? I might say the bill bird podcast. Then she will ask, why I don't know, because I enjoy it. He says, then she will follow it up with, why don't you listen to the radio or another podcast and down the rabbit hole it goes, oh, I don't like this person already. The thing is, these questions are nonstop and so subjective. It got to the point where I straight up asked her if she was trolling me and she denied it. Everything else in relationship is going well, so I'm not sure what to do. I've talked to her and told her she asked too many questions. She then turns around on me and says, I never want to talk to her. Any. Oh, she turns it, turns it around on me and says that I never want to talk to her anymore.

Speaker 2:          01:14:42       That's not talking. It's just asking a bunch of fucking question. She'll, what should I do? Break up with her. Just answered the questions. What would you do, Bill? Why is your name bill anyways? Why not, Dave? Huh? Why isn't it Dave? Bill, why aren't you answering me? Bill? Don't want to talk anymore. Why is the podcast an hour anyways? Why not an hour, 10 or 50 minutes? Hot Bill. Yeah. All right dude, I just walked in your shoes there. Yeah. Uh, yeah. I, I, I would break up with her. I'd break up with them. Um, I maybe a, but if you really like her, I give her one last chance and just be like, just tell it you're driving me fucking insane. And um, yeah, it just, you're driving me fucking insane. I like everything about you, but that, and if my life with you is going to be that, I'm going to leave.

Speaker 2:          01:15:30       Okay. Um, but I gotta be honest with dude, I don't know how people change. Changing yourself, who the fuck you are is really difficult, so hopefully it'll work out with you. So that's, that's what I would do. I would just say, listen, I like everything but that everything about you is great except for that. But that is so fucking horrific. This is going to walk out that fucking door if you don't cut it up. That's it. That's it. If I could redo my whole dating life, it would have been fucking communicating instead of just being like, Woo, fuck. And then gone out and getting shit faced. What was wrong with USA? No thing. I'm sorry. And then you don't fucking work it out. Hey, we're going out. Okay. All right. That's the podcast for this week. Go fuck yourselves. I'll check it on Thursday. A thank you to everybody who's been listening to the podcast and I'm obviously, I am beyond excited to do this tour. Um, starting, uh, oh my God, the 31st no, it starts the 30th doesn't it?
