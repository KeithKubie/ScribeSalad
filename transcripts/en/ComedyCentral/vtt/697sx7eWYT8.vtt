00:00:10.142 --> 00:00:13.479 line:0%
 First question is, is
 First Date a romcom?

00:00:13.512 --> 00:00:14.613 line:0%
- Yeah.

00:00:14.647 --> 00:00:16.649 line:0%

00:00:45.377 --> 00:00:46.245 size:88% position:44%
  It's huge.

00:00:46.278 --> 00:00:47.847
 It's like that hair
 ate your other hair.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.348
 - Okay, FYI, everyone,

00:00:49.381 --> 00:00:50.650
I'm feeling very insecure today.

00:00:50.683 --> 00:00:52.151
 And you know how I'm normally

00:00:52.184 --> 00:00:53.486 size:88% position:44%
  the most confident

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:54.720
 - Yes. Mm-hmm.

00:00:54.753 --> 00:00:56.589 align:start size:88% position:13%

00:00:56.622 --> 00:00:57.523 size:84% position:42%
  - Gillian Jacobs?

00:00:57.556 --> 00:00:58.558 size:88% position:44%
 Doesn't everybody love her?

00:00:58.591 --> 00:00:59.559 size:88% position:44%

  Hell, no.

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:01.694 size:88% position:44%
 - I kind of think
 she's a sweetheart.

00:01:01.727 --> 00:01:03.129
 - Seems really cool.

00:01:03.162 --> 00:01:04.063 size:84% position:42%

00:01:04.096 --> 00:01:04.730
 She's got a really good smile.

00:01:04.763 --> 00:01:05.698
 - She's really cool.

00:01:05.731 --> 00:01:07.133 size:88% position:44%
  She is a favorite.

00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:08.634 align:start size:88% position:13%

like, my best friend.

00:01:08.667 --> 00:01:09.569
 She's awful.

00:01:09.602 --> 00:01:10.570 size:84% position:42%
  - Oh, wait, that's right.

00:01:10.603 --> 00:01:11.537
You were in that
sitcom with her.

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.173
Uh, Blame it on Baxter.

00:01:14.206 --> 00:01:15.141 size:88% position:44%

00:01:15.174 --> 00:01:15.775 size:88% position:44%

00:01:20.646 --> 00:01:22.415 align:start size:88% position:13%
Like, that was my
given name on the show.

00:01:22.448 --> 00:01:24.550 size:88% position:44%
  It's so fucked up.

00:01:24.583 --> 00:01:25.384 size:88% position:44%
 Oh, my God.

00:01:25.417 --> 00:01:26.219 size:88% position:44%
 - Hey, hey.

00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:27.653 size:84% position:42%
  - I ate a muffin.

00:01:27.686 --> 00:01:28.488 size:84% position:42%
  - It's okay, it's
  okay, it's okay.

00:01:28.521 --> 00:01:29.722 size:88% position:44%
  - Take it.

00:01:29.755 --> 00:01:32.425

  Everyone is here.

00:01:33.792 --> 00:01:34.827
 - Okay, Kevin?

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.462
 Honestly, don't start with me.

00:01:36.495 --> 00:01:39.332
- Mmm, Fatty Fanny's got
her panties in a bunch.

00:01:39.365 --> 00:01:41.400 size:84% position:42%
  Are you ready for
  your big reunion?

00:01:41.433 --> 00:01:43.569
(coughs)

00:01:43.602 --> 00:01:44.537
Porkie?

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.606 size:88% position:44%
  - I cannot even right now.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:48.608
 (lively music)

00:01:48.641 --> 00:01:49.576 size:88% position:44%
 Oh, my God.

00:01:50.809 --> 00:01:51.677

  - [Britney] Gilli.

00:01:52.678 --> 00:01:55.248
 - What a blast from the past.

00:01:55.281 --> 00:01:56.582 size:88% position:44%
 Ow.

00:01:56.615 --> 00:01:58.217 size:88% position:44%

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.819 size:88% position:44%
  Honestly, like, I

00:01:59.852 --> 00:02:00.720 size:88% position:44%

00:02:03.522 --> 00:02:05.791 size:88% position:44% line:0%
 - Oh, my God, your
 skin is so amazing.

00:02:05.824 --> 00:02:07.426 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
 I want to, like, wear
 you like a jacket.

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:08.394 line:0%
- What?

00:02:08.427 --> 00:02:09.529 line:0%
- What?

00:02:09.562 --> 00:02:11.063
Oh, my God, this is so exciting.

00:02:11.096 --> 00:02:12.565
 - Yes, very exciting.

00:02:12.598 --> 00:02:13.466 size:88% position:44% line:0%
 First Date.

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:15.401 line:0%
- I thought it was good.

00:02:15.434 --> 00:02:16.502 line:0%
 - Oh, great.

00:02:16.535 --> 00:02:18.171 line:0%
 I'm so glad.

00:02:18.204 --> 00:02:20.806 align:start position:0% line:0%
 - Totally, like, you know,
 not gonna get a lot of praise.

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:23.743 align:start position:0% line:0%
  It's not gonna, like,
  hurt your career too much.

00:02:23.776 --> 00:02:26.312 line:0%
- I always count on you
to give me straight up--

00:02:26.345 --> 00:02:28.447 size:84% position:42% line:0%
  - Yes, because that's,
  like, our dynamic, right?

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.482 line:0%
 - Yeah. You're a little mean,

00:02:29.515 --> 00:02:30.583 size:88% position:44% line:0%
 and I just take it.

00:02:30.616 --> 00:02:34.554 size:84% position:42% line:0%
  - I finally finished book
  23 of the Glanthor Saga.

00:02:34.587 --> 00:02:35.821
 - Oh, congratulations on that.

00:02:35.854 --> 00:02:37.190
 Am I supposed to be interested

00:02:37.223 --> 00:02:38.324 align:start size:88% position:13%
 in that stupid
 book you're writing

00:02:38.357 --> 00:02:39.825 align:start size:88% position:13%
 in your mom's basement
 about dragons?

00:02:39.858 --> 00:02:42.562 align:start position:0%
 - Alright, they're not
 called "dragons" in Glanthor.

00:02:42.595 --> 00:02:45.131
 They're called "fire slugs."

00:02:45.164 --> 00:02:45.798 size:88% position:44%
 - You alright, man?

00:02:45.831 --> 00:02:47.533
 You don't look so hot.

00:02:47.566 --> 00:02:49.435 size:88% position:44%
  - Do not mix tequila and
  cock fighting, ever, boys.

00:02:49.468 --> 00:02:50.436
 - Well, that's funny,

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:52.405
because I had nine Vodka
crans last night myself,

00:02:52.438 --> 00:02:53.373 size:84% position:42%
  and I feel great.

00:02:53.406 --> 00:02:55.107 align:start size:88% position:13%
I also got up, ran seven
miles, and meditated,

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.444 align:start size:88% position:13%
did a little manscaping,
all before 7 a.m.

00:02:58.477 --> 00:03:01.113
- Did you get your scrotum, too?

00:03:01.146 --> 00:03:02.281
 - Yes.

00:03:02.314 --> 00:03:03.482 size:88% position:44% line:0%
 (lively rock music)

00:03:03.515 --> 00:03:04.383 line:0%
- I brought you a gift.

00:03:04.416 --> 00:03:05.651 size:88% position:44% line:0%
  - [Gillian] What?!

00:03:05.684 --> 00:03:06.586 line:0%
- Don't feel bad if you
didn't get me anything.

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:07.687 size:84% position:42% line:0%
  - I'm so, I'm humiliated.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.288 size:88% position:44% line:0%
  You've really shown me up.

00:03:09.321 --> 00:03:10.356 size:88% position:44% line:0%
 - Okay, here it is.

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:12.559 size:88% position:44% line:0%
  - Ho ho, oh ho ho, my God.

00:03:14.827 --> 00:03:17.029 line:0%
 - So that's us on the
 cover of TV Tonight,

00:03:17.062 --> 00:03:18.297 line:0%
 and that's me way in the front

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:19.599 line:0%
doing my signature pose.

00:03:19.632 --> 00:03:20.700 line:0%
And then that's Gillian.

00:03:20.733 --> 00:03:22.301 line:0%
They put her, like, in the back.

00:03:22.334 --> 00:03:24.537 line:0%
And then the dog's even
in front of Gillian.

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.439 line:0%
- Yeah, this is amazing.

00:03:26.472 --> 00:03:27.673 line:0%
I feel like I should sign this.

00:03:27.706 --> 00:03:30.743 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
 Like, "You'll always
 be Fatty to me."

00:03:30.776 --> 00:03:31.677 line:0%
- (laughs) That's good.

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:32.645 line:0%
 - Do you have a pen?

00:03:32.678 --> 00:03:33.479 line:0%
I'll sign it right now.

00:03:33.512 --> 00:03:34.747 size:84% position:42% line:0%
  - No, no.

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:35.681 size:88% position:44% line:0%
  You don't need to
  put that on there.

00:03:35.714 --> 00:03:37.350
- Can we just put this down here

00:03:37.383 --> 00:03:39.452 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
so it's not in the
frame for the interview?

00:03:39.485 --> 00:03:40.786 size:88% position:44% line:0%
  - Okay, sure, sounds good.

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:42.221
 - Thank you so much.

00:03:42.254 --> 00:03:43.456
 - You know, maybe we
 could put it here.

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:46.192
 - How do you not have
 Wi-Fi at the pool?!

00:03:46.225 --> 00:03:47.493 size:84% position:42%
  - Hey, um, I know
  I'm the new guy,

00:03:47.526 --> 00:03:48.761
so maybe I don't get it,

00:03:48.794 --> 00:03:52.131 size:84% position:42%
  but why are you
  all so miserable?

00:03:52.164 --> 00:03:53.432
 - What are you talking about?

00:03:53.465 --> 00:03:54.800 size:84% position:42%
  - Just get me the
  fucking audition.

00:03:54.833 --> 00:03:56.535
- We get to talk to movie stars

00:03:56.568 --> 00:04:00.006 size:84% position:42%
  in beautiful hotels with
  free food for cash money.

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:01.474 align:start size:88% position:13%
 Most people would
 kill for that chance.

00:04:01.507 --> 00:04:04.010 size:88% position:44%
  - My young, sweet Padawan.

00:04:04.043 --> 00:04:05.211
We'll get you jaded yet.

00:04:05.244 --> 00:04:06.445 size:88% position:44% line:0%
 (lively rock music)

00:04:06.478 --> 00:04:07.747 line:0%
 - Yeah, I guess my big break

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.615 line:0%
 was when I got into Juilliard.

00:04:09.648 --> 00:04:11.617 line:0%
Do you remember when
we auditioned together?

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.052 line:0%
 - Yes.

00:04:13.085 --> 00:04:14.320 size:88% position:44% line:0%
 - Oh, my God, how
 crazy would that be

00:04:14.353 --> 00:04:15.221 size:84% position:42% line:0%
  if you had gotten
  in instead of me?

00:04:15.254 --> 00:04:16.555 line:0%
 We would have just,
 like, swapped lives.

00:04:16.588 --> 00:04:17.590 line:0%
 - Ew. Gross.

00:04:18.757 --> 00:04:20.493 line:0%
 - I always wondered
 why you didn't get in.

00:04:20.526 --> 00:04:22.662 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
Do you think it's 'cause
you can't cry on cue?

00:04:22.695 --> 00:04:24.230 line:0%
- No, I can cry on cue.

00:04:24.263 --> 00:04:25.464 size:88% position:44% line:0%
  - You can?

00:04:25.497 --> 00:04:26.399 line:0%
 - Yeah, I didn't want
 to go to Juilliard.

00:04:26.432 --> 00:04:28.034 line:0%
It was, like, too, bleh, stuffy.

00:04:28.067 --> 00:04:29.335 line:0%
I wanted to go to City College.

00:04:29.368 --> 00:04:31.504 line:0%
 - Why don't you just,
 like, cry on cue now

00:04:31.537 --> 00:04:32.271 size:84% position:42% line:0%
  if you can do it?

00:04:32.305 --> 00:04:35.108 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
 - [Britney] I
 know, I'm going to.

00:04:36.275 --> 00:04:37.510 line:0%
 - You just look like
 you're squinting.

00:04:37.543 --> 00:04:38.378 size:88% position:44% line:0%
  - Hold on.

00:04:39.545 --> 00:04:40.546 size:84% position:42% line:0%
  - Okay, I'm gonna
  give you a hint.

00:04:40.579 --> 00:04:41.614 line:0%
 I do it all the time.

00:04:41.647 --> 00:04:43.316 line:0%
 Just think about your career.

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:44.517 line:0%
 - But you have a great career.

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.552 line:0%
- No, I think about your career.

00:04:46.585 --> 00:04:47.587 line:0%
 It's like...

00:04:52.524 --> 00:04:54.193 line:0%
(sniffs)

00:04:54.226 --> 00:04:55.394 size:88% position:44% line:0%
  I'm sorry.

00:04:55.427 --> 00:04:56.462 size:88% position:44% line:0%
  Like that.

00:04:58.163 --> 00:05:00.499 size:88% position:44% line:0%
  - Um, so it was so
  good to see you.

00:05:00.532 --> 00:05:01.734 size:84% position:42% line:0%
  - Yeah, you, too.

00:05:05.504 --> 00:05:07.373
- Give me that, please.
