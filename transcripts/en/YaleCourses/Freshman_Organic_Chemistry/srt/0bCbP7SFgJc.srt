1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:02,910
So back to business.

2
00:00:02,911 --> 00:00:07,911
We're in a really great position here
because we've gone from one dimension to

3
00:00:09,571 --> 00:00:13,140
three dimensions to get something real,
a real Adam.

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:17,550
And if you take that table from last
time that we got from the old time

5
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:22,020
mathematicians and plug in according
to what you can use together,

6
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:27,210
you get the exact wave function that's
a solution to the shredding or equation

7
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:30,240
for the hydrogen atom for,
or a hydrogen,

8
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:33,630
any Adam that has only one electron.

9
00:00:33,631 --> 00:00:38,460
It can have any nuclear charge you
want, right? So it's the real thing.

10
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,330
People have shown you pictures, which
are some kinds of approximations of this,

11
00:00:42,331 --> 00:00:46,500
but you have the equation,
the actual formula for the,

12
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,010
for the true way function.
And no one has a better one than you have.

13
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,280
That's the real McCoy.
Okay?

14
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,450
And you can check these pictures that
people have drawn to see if there are

15
00:00:57,451 --> 00:01:01,830
realistic grafts or whether or whether
they're just some kind of artist's

16
00:01:01,831 --> 00:01:04,800
impression or somebody who doesn't
know anything's impression.

17
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,530
Maybe he's not even an artist,
right?

18
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:10,960
So you can actually do these and they're,
they're the,

19
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:15,720
the many of them are very simple
functions like to the minus are, right.

20
00:01:15,721 --> 00:01:18,120
You could hardly get easier than that.
Okay.

21
00:01:18,121 --> 00:01:22,950
But you can also draw pictures that
look just like what you can see if the

22
00:01:22,951 --> 00:01:24,570
electron had a color to it.

23
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:29,730
There are done by ray tracing where the
computer pretends it's your eye and sees

24
00:01:30,421 --> 00:01:34,980
how much density it would go through if
it went through this point or that point

25
00:01:34,981 --> 00:01:39,000
or that point along a certain ray from
your eye and puts a color here that's

26
00:01:39,001 --> 00:01:43,020
proportional to how much electron density
and sees it's not the wave function,

27
00:01:43,021 --> 00:01:45,630
it's the square of the wave function,
the electron density,

28
00:01:45,631 --> 00:01:49,190
that adamant of box plots. Okay. So that,

29
00:01:49,191 --> 00:01:51,360
that's what it would really
look like if you could see it.

30
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,940
And if there weren't problems
with wavelength and, and uh,

31
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:58,860
and photons knocking electrons
to kingdom come and so on,

32
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:02,160
that's what it would look like right now.
But it'll be colored,

33
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:05,670
it'll be colored according to the sign.
The wave function has,

34
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,120
it's not the way functions to square the
way functions. So it would be positive,

35
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,020
but it's colored to say the way function
in this region would be positive or in

36
00:02:13,021 --> 00:02:17,190
this region. Negative. And I'll show it
to you in just a second, but first let's,

37
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,950
or a few minutes,
but first let's describe it.

38
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:25,310
So there's lots of information on the
screen that you get with Adam in a box.

39
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:29,880
How many of you have tried
it? Okay, all of you should.

40
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:31,950
Okay.
Okay.

41
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:35,640
First you have the Schrodinger equation
that always appears and it's sort of

42
00:02:35,641 --> 00:02:39,450
silly, but if you need the Schrodinger
equation for reference, there it is.

43
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,630
Uh, then up at the top is the particular
function that's being plotted and it's

44
00:02:45,631 --> 00:02:48,600
given as an l and M,
right?

45
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:53,010
And also the nickname one
s for this particular one,

46
00:02:53,011 --> 00:02:55,950
which is one zero zero for an l and m.

47
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:01,240
And then there's the formula that
that particular wave function has.

48
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,900
And you know what it is, it's a bunch
of constants, which we can forget,

49
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:09,880
but it's e to the minus R,
right? He's not using row here.

50
00:03:09,881 --> 00:03:14,730
Notice he uses actual r and puts in
explicitly the Z and the eight zero

51
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:20,410
a and the twos canceled.
Okay.

52
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:25,060
And then he says what the energy would
be in units of electron volts and

53
00:03:25,061 --> 00:03:28,960
electron volts.
23.06 times as big as a kilo calorie,

54
00:03:28,961 --> 00:03:32,840
which is what we usually
talk in. Uh, now you can, uh,

55
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:35,890
you can look at these
pictures and ask a question,

56
00:03:35,891 --> 00:03:40,090
some fairly simple questions like,
where is the electron density highest?

57
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:43,720
The nucleus is in the center of
this picture. Not surprisingly.

58
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:45,670
So this is not a hard question.

59
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:49,590
Where's the electron density
highest in the middle, right?

60
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:52,390
No big surprise there.
Okay.

61
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,300
How do you know you
take the wave function,

62
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:59,610
you square it and find out
where it has a maximum and eat.

63
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:03,280
The minus distance has a maximum.
When the distance is zero,

64
00:04:03,281 --> 00:04:07,380
the values one falls off
from there. Okay. So the,

65
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,640
so you just to find where
the density is highest,

66
00:04:09,641 --> 00:04:13,870
you just square the wave function
and maximize it. Okay. Now,

67
00:04:13,871 --> 00:04:15,760
but here's a slightly different question.

68
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:19,420
What is the most likely distance?

69
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:21,790
Okay.

70
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:25,420
Can you see why that's a
different question than where
you might think the most

71
00:04:25,421 --> 00:04:29,710
likely distances, wherever the density
is highest, but that's not quite true.

72
00:04:29,711 --> 00:04:30,544
Do you see why?

73
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:35,973
Okay.

74
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:44,660
Cause what's most, yeah. No, it
doesn't have to do with motion.

75
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:49,670
Yeah. Lucas, there's almost
no volume in the center.

76
00:04:49,671 --> 00:04:54,671
If you take the dis say say if you talk
about a point right then there's no

77
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:59,780
volume at all. Okay. But take a little
box and put it in the center or,

78
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:03,860
or actually a sphere of a certain
radius, a small radius, you know,

79
00:05:03,861 --> 00:05:07,880
0.01 angst from say and put
it in the center. Right.

80
00:05:07,881 --> 00:05:11,090
And see how much density is inside.
Okay.

81
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:16,810
But then you could look at one OnX drum
out and now you're looking at a little

82
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:21,620
spherical shell that's
0.01 angst drums thick.

83
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,900
Is everybody clear?
Cause that would,

84
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:27,740
so there could be different directions
in which you have this electron density,

85
00:05:27,741 --> 00:05:30,680
which is at that particular
distance from the nucleus.

86
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:33,140
And the further out you go,

87
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:38,780
the more volume this shell has.
It's always the same thickness.

88
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:43,370
But as you move out, there's more
stuff in it. You see what I mean?

89
00:05:43,371 --> 00:05:47,960
More volume in it. What's it
proportional to as you increase our,

90
00:05:47,961 --> 00:05:50,150
how does the volume of the shell increase?

91
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,630
How does the surface of the
sphere increase as you go out?

92
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:58,880
Not No volume is r cubed
goes with our square.

93
00:05:58,881 --> 00:06:01,340
The surface goes with r squared,
right?

94
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:04,620
So you have to multiply that,

95
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:09,730
the probability density by r squared
to see at what radius you have the most

96
00:06:12,231 --> 00:06:15,050
stuff.
Is that clear to everyone?

97
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:18,830
Because you want to count
everything that's at that radius,

98
00:06:18,831 --> 00:06:21,530
not only in that direction, but also
in that direction, that direction,

99
00:06:21,531 --> 00:06:25,160
that direction and so on.
And the sphere gets bigger as you go out.

100
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,320
So you'll notice that what's given in
this plot here in the bottom right is r

101
00:06:30,321 --> 00:06:34,310
squared times the wave functions squared.

102
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:36,763
Okay?

103
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:41,720
So that'll tell you what's
the most likely distance.

104
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,633
Okay?

105
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:48,620
So you have to do surface waiting
by r squared and it's not zero.

106
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:54,040
It's at the unit that we use
to measure distance in a zero,

107
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,190
which turns out to be a half
an angst from 0.53 [inaudible].

108
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:00,410
Okay,

109
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:04,880
now here's the two s orbital right now,

110
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,580
uh,
which they're here.

111
00:07:07,581 --> 00:07:11,150
Withdraw two different shells
of the same thickness, right?

112
00:07:11,151 --> 00:07:14,540
We'll number them one and two
and we're gonna ask the question,

113
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,610
which one has higher density? Is that,
is that light too much for Ya? Cause it,

114
00:07:19,611 --> 00:07:21,740
can you see? Can you see it? Well,

115
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:26,840
is it better if I do that
or not? Not really. Okay.

116
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:31,700
Okay. Which Shell has
higher density? One or two?

117
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:37,600
One clearly. Okay. Now here's
a different question. Uh,

118
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,500
okay. It's shows one which shell
contains more electron density,

119
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:46,310
more stuff.
Which one has more probability?

120
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:52,490
It's not obvious because one has
higher density, but two is much bigger.

121
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:56,000
Okay.
And in fact the,

122
00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:01,130
the two has about three
times the radius of one.

123
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:05,660
Right? So how much more
volume does that Shell have?

124
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:11,990
About nine times more volume. Not
of the sphere, but of the shell.

125
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:15,290
Okay.
So it's about nine times the volume.

126
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:20,300
So it turns out that actually two has
more stuff and you see that in this plot,

127
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:25,760
right? The red for two is
bigger than the, than the, uh,

128
00:08:25,761 --> 00:08:28,550
than the green for one,
right?

129
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:31,910
So depending on what question you ask,

130
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:36,230
you have to decide whether you have to
weight it by r squared to get the answer

131
00:08:36,231 --> 00:08:40,930
your need. Okay? Now here's another, uh,

132
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:45,950
way of looking at a wave function.
This happens to be, uh, uh, the, uh,

133
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:51,380
it's actually a three d wave
function as you see, not from here,

134
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:54,050
but from here, right? It's three d.

135
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,710
This is the in three dimensions using
that ray tracing the way we talk about,

136
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,220
but you can do,
if you click slice down here,

137
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:07,440
then you get a slice through it. Okay?
So that's a, you know, a two dimensional,

138
00:09:07,441 --> 00:09:09,720
more like the contour
plots we've been using.

139
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:14,280
It's just a slice through the three
d thing. So this is a two d, uh,

140
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,580
not a projection,
but an actual slice of it.

141
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,620
And with this slider here,
you can control where the slice is.

142
00:09:22,621 --> 00:09:25,950
It's in the middle there, so it goes
through the nucleus. But if you want,

143
00:09:25,951 --> 00:09:27,060
you can slide it,

144
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,290
slide it down and see what the slice
would be if it were in front of the screen

145
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:33,720
that you slice this picture.
Everybody got it?

146
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:37,020
So you can look at different
levels that way if you want to,

147
00:09:37,021 --> 00:09:41,100
or you can pretend you're looking at the
whole thing so it can be near or far.

148
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:47,040
Uh, okay. Now let's look
at at this, uh, at this,

149
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,920
these two different,
the two d and the three d pictures,

150
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,230
and look at the pattern of nodes,

151
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:55,620
the shape and the energy
of the three d orbital.

152
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,720
You see here in the,

153
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:02,610
in the that there are diagonal
nodes in this three d orbital.

154
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:07,590
Okay,
so that's three d.

155
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,070
Let's look at this one.

156
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:16,620
Now we still have those two
diagonal nodes. In fact,

157
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:18,510
it turns out that they're,
that they're,

158
00:10:18,511 --> 00:10:21,510
that it's at the nodes are actually cones.

159
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:26,010
This is a slice through a cone
right on the top and on the bottom.

160
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:31,560
Okay? So the nodal surface, bear
in mind that in in one dimension,

161
00:10:31,561 --> 00:10:36,561
a node is a point in two dimensions
and node is align in three dimensions.

162
00:10:37,111 --> 00:10:39,150
A node is a surface,
right?

163
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:44,250
So we're slicing it and seek
an intersection of the, of
the conical surface here,

164
00:10:44,251 --> 00:10:46,950
but the actual node is a cone.
Okay,

165
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:51,610
but is that the only node that you
see in that picture on the right? Oh,

166
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:55,980
hi. Angela says she sees
a circle too, right?

167
00:10:56,430 --> 00:11:00,810
So there are two kinds of nodes
in this orbital. There's both,

168
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:05,040
uh, a conical node, which
we had in the previous one.

169
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:07,830
The three d orbital had a conical node.

170
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:11,370
That's what makes it a d
orbital having a conical node.

171
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:15,030
But this one also has a spherical node,

172
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,020
which is a circle when we slice it.
Okay?

173
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:23,160
So this is this higher energy
or lower energy than the,

174
00:11:23,161 --> 00:11:27,480
than the one we looked at before.
How do you know it's higher?

175
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,430
Has more nodes?

176
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:33,870
Did you ever see a situation before
where you can have two different kinds of

177
00:11:33,871 --> 00:11:38,240
nodes? Here you have
both a certain this, uh,

178
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:41,610
this section,
both the circle and blinds.

179
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:46,710
You ever see anything like that before?
Right.

180
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:52,500
Anyhow, it's higher energy. It's four
D, Not Three D as You said. And it's,

181
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,170
it's like this, right? You have
both circular and diameter nodes,

182
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:59,530
but this is three dimensional.
So you have both sphere and cone.

183
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:03,850
So what can you guess what a
five d orbital would look like?

184
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
We looked at a three d orbital.
This is a 40 orbital.

185
00:12:10,001 --> 00:12:13,750
How about a five Dr Bill Lucas,
whatever the third layer of notice,

186
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:18,250
not a third layer of nodes.
It would have how many more nodes?

187
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:24,730
One more node. And it would
be in the, in the section.

188
00:12:24,731 --> 00:12:26,020
That would be another circle.

189
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:30,400
Or actually it's another sphere
of a different diameter. Okay,

190
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:32,150
so you'll see how you,

191
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:37,170
you can combine cones in this
case or it can be planes too.

192
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:42,160
You have planes for P
orbitals. You can combine, uh,

193
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:46,150
uh, spheres with,

194
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:48,220
with planes or cones.

195
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:54,300
And there you can combine them in
different ways to get the same energy.

196
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:56,651
For example,

197
00:12:56,651 --> 00:13:01,651
you can have a sphere and a cone that
has a certain energy that's a four d the

198
00:13:03,761 --> 00:13:08,020
One we're looking at here.
Or You could have two sets of,

199
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:12,400
of s, forget the sphere,
but have another cone.

200
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:16,680
Does that remind you of anything
and get the same energy?

201
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:22,080
Or you can have a plane and a cone,

202
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:27,750
or you could have a sphere and a plane,

203
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:32,990
or are you can have a sphere and a cone.
I said that already.

204
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,650
Or are you going to have two spheres?
Or You could have two planes.

205
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:40,160
All those are two nodes.
Does everybody see what I'm saying?

206
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:44,180
And they all have the same energy.
Does that remind you of anything?

207
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:47,300
It's not exactly the same,
but it should remind you of something.

208
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:49,800
Okay.

209
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,050
That's what Claude Nissan,

210
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:55,230
I remember you could get
different combinations in
his case of circles and lines

211
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:58,110
and get the same frequency.
Right?

212
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,320
So that's why the two s and the two p
have the same energy or the three ps.

213
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:09,360
The three P and three d
have the same energy. Okay.

214
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:15,570
Uh,
now let's talk about scaling the h.

215
00:14:15,571 --> 00:14:20,490
Like what do we mean by
h? Like it's one electron,

216
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,350
any nuclear charge,
but one electron.

217
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,330
Why incidentally,
do we want it to be one electron?

218
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:34,300
Zach, uh, that will turn
out to be case, but,

219
00:14:34,301 --> 00:14:35,700
but even if that weren't the case,

220
00:14:35,701 --> 00:14:40,440
there's a good reason to start
with one electron. Yeah. Between,

221
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:43,500
yeah, it's, it's true
that we don't want, well,

222
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:46,950
we'll get into big trouble when we get
Coulombe interaction between electrons.

223
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:51,410
It's absolutely right, but we want
to walk before we try to run right.

224
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:54,890
Work with three variables,
not six variables,

225
00:14:54,891 --> 00:14:59,030
which you'd have have two electrons or
three n if you had an electron's. Right.

226
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:00,800
So we want simple
functions at the beginning.

227
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,730
So that's what the h like wave
function is just one electron,

228
00:15:04,731 --> 00:15:09,560
just three variables,
Rho Theta feet or the convenient ones.

229
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,030
Okay. But now we want to see how we scale
it as we changed the nuclear charge.

230
00:15:14,031 --> 00:15:18,110
We already started talking about that
last time when we talked about Roe,

231
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:20,120
but we're going to talk both about all,

232
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:25,150
we're going to talk about size also about
electron density and also about energy

233
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:29,120
and how the energies of these one
electron atoms change as you change the

234
00:15:29,121 --> 00:15:32,210
nuclear charge. Okay. We, this is
what we talked about last time,

235
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:37,880
that if you make the table up the
formulas in row instead of in r,

236
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:43,120
then you could use it for any hydrogen
like Adam because the distance scale,

237
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,260
uh, gets, gets multiplied
by the nuclear charge.

238
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:53,390
That is to say if you have a given row
that's a given size of the function we're

239
00:15:53,391 --> 00:15:58,270
talking about right
given row, then, uh, it,

240
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:03,610
you have that value at shorter
are if you have a higher z,

241
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:08,420
right? A tradeoff betweenZ
and r. If you double Z,

242
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,050
you get the same value at half the are,

243
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:16,070
does that make sense
that as you get z bigger,

244
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:21,260
the distance is get smaller?
Does that make sense? Why?

245
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:23,960
Because the elect,

246
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:28,640
the nucleus pulls the electron in
more and notice that it's linear,

247
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,650
right?
If you double the nuclear charge,

248
00:16:30,651 --> 00:16:35,090
your shrink by a factor of
two in the distance. Okay,

249
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,880
so increasing z shrinks,

250
00:16:37,881 --> 00:16:41,510
the wave function makes are
smaller for the same row.

251
00:16:41,511 --> 00:16:45,980
That is the same height of the wave
function or the same position in the shape

252
00:16:45,981 --> 00:16:46,850
of the wave function.

253
00:16:46,851 --> 00:16:50,420
Because you have to renormalize
if you shrink the wave function.

254
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:52,281
Okay,

255
00:16:52,281 --> 00:16:57,281
so let's compare hydrogen carbon
plus six and potassium plus 19 right?

256
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:04,610
So the, the distance scale, we'll
go one, one sixth, one 19th.

257
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:08,330
So this is what, this is what it looks
like. If a hydrogen atom is that big,

258
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:12,830
this is how big the carbon
one electron atom is.

259
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:15,890
And that's how big the
potassium one electron is.

260
00:17:15,891 --> 00:17:20,310
One 19th as as the linear
distance that's in,

261
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,890
that's in hydrogen. Now how much
does the electron density change?

262
00:17:24,891 --> 00:17:29,840
I think that's the next thing. Uh,
yeah, scaling electron density with z.

263
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,070
You can see that just from
what we just talked about,

264
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:38,840
if you shrink the distance
by a factor of two,

265
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:41,240
how much do you change?
The density

266
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:45,880
factor too is the density.

267
00:17:45,881 --> 00:17:48,980
You get twice as high if you
make the distance half as long.

268
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,173
Right?

269
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:56,490
It's got to be too cute cause your
shrink at this way and this way.

270
00:17:56,491 --> 00:18:00,630
And also this way. So it goes
up with CSI cubed. The density.

271
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:05,220
That means if you have a hydrogen atom,
the electrons are every witch away, right?

272
00:18:05,221 --> 00:18:08,430
All over.
But if you have even a carbon atom,

273
00:18:08,431 --> 00:18:11,880
six times the nuclear charge
for the same one s orbital,

274
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:17,190
the density is eight is six cubed as big.

275
00:18:17,191 --> 00:18:20,970
What's six cube? 36 45 to over 200. Right?

276
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:26,130
So you have 200 times the electron
density for the one s electron in carbon

277
00:18:26,131 --> 00:18:28,170
compared to the one s
electron in hydrogen.

278
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:33,210
Where does that crop up in
experiment that you have such a,

279
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:38,630
so much higher electron density for
carbon than you do for hydrogen and other

280
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:42,120
things are even more so like
potassium. Where does it crop up? Yeah.

281
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:47,280
Of what,
what experiment

282
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:54,180
close what? You can do it by calculation
and you'd see much higher density.

283
00:18:54,181 --> 00:18:55,950
That's what we're talking about is theory.

284
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:59,600
But where do you see it experimentally?
Lucas?

285
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,330
Not Well,
you can do it in a difference,

286
00:19:03,331 --> 00:19:07,960
but if you look at the total
electron density, you don't
see hydrogens, you know,

287
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:12,510
unless you look work really hard
because the density of electrons,

288
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:17,310
which is what you're seeing is so
much higher for other atoms. Okay.

289
00:19:17,311 --> 00:19:21,900
So the normalization, uh, it has
to be one. So if you shrink it,

290
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,820
and that's where that comes in.

291
00:19:23,821 --> 00:19:28,821
We talked about that z over a zero to
the three halves that gets squared before

292
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:30,180
and uh,

293
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:35,180
so that it's the size squared
is proportional disease
cubed and the density of

294
00:19:35,731 --> 00:19:39,780
the one s electron as you go across
these Adams goes from one to two,

295
00:19:39,781 --> 00:19:44,610
16 to 7,000 potassium
is 7,000 times higher.

296
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:48,510
Remember that what we saw that in X-ray,
what a very dark Adam that was.

297
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:54,600
Okay. So it helps x-ray's find
heavier atoms more easily. Uh,

298
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,650
now how about the kinetic energy?
Right?

299
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:02,890
So Sai is a function of are right,

300
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,610
some kind of function of our,
but,

301
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:08,310
but it includes a z.

302
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:11,520
Z times are right because Roe is z.

303
00:20:11,521 --> 00:20:16,521
Times are so now how does
that influence the derivative,

304
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:18,210
right?

305
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:22,470
If you have a function to z of are the
derivative of it is z times the function

306
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:27,180
of z by the derivative of, uh, of uh,

307
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:31,660
let's, yeah, rob La, uh,
I got that wrong. No, I,

308
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:35,340
or do I have it right? That's
right. Yeah, I got it right. Okay.

309
00:20:35,341 --> 00:20:37,050
Now how about the second derivative?

310
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:42,120
It's going to have a z squared in it,
right?

311
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:47,420
So the curvature is going to be z squared
times what the curvature was before,

312
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:53,680
but the value of the wave function
is the same at some saint,

313
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:58,000
the corresponding row. So what's
going to happen to the kinetic energy

314
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:02,050
if you have a bigger nuclear charge,

315
00:21:02,051 --> 00:21:05,650
what's going to happen to the kinetic
energy at any point and a corresponding

316
00:21:05,651 --> 00:21:08,770
points, right? It's going to be
proportional disease squared.

317
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:13,090
The curvature divided by the
value of the wave function, right?

318
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:17,710
So the kinetic energy is going to really
zoom up for a hydrogen like Adam when

319
00:21:17,711 --> 00:21:21,370
you get a heavier Adam, right? So what,

320
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:23,020
let's summarize what we did so far.

321
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:28,140
So distance will shrink according dizzy
electron density will go up according to

322
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:33,070
CSI cubed, and the kinetic
energy will go with z squared.

323
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:37,030
Okay.
Now how about the potential energy?

324
00:21:37,031 --> 00:21:41,560
How will it change as we,
as we changed the nuclear charge?

325
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,200
Well,
if we change the nuclear charge,

326
00:21:44,201 --> 00:21:48,340
cool ohms law includes the nuclear charge,
right?

327
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:51,760
So at the same distance,
right?

328
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:54,040
You'll have z times

329
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:58,900
that whatever it was for
hydrogen, right? Much,

330
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:03,070
much higher or indeed lower
potential energy, more negative,

331
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:06,250
further from zero.
Okay.

332
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:11,380
But at a fixed that's,
that's so at a fixed distance,

333
00:22:11,381 --> 00:22:13,900
the potential energy will
be proportional to z,

334
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:19,000
but the distance shrinks,
right?

335
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:22,930
So if you look at corresponding positions
in the wave function or you look at

336
00:22:22,931 --> 00:22:27,070
the average, uh, potential
energy, it's going to go,

337
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:30,470
it's going to also be, uh,
take into account that,

338
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:34,720
that the distance gets smaller
or gets smaller, right?

339
00:22:34,721 --> 00:22:37,540
Cause of the thing got shrunk,
shrunk, and by a factor of z.

340
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,150
So what happens to the
average potential energy?

341
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:45,100
How is it scale with z?
Maria, you got an idea

342
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,220
and a given distance.

343
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:53,110
The energy according to cool ohms law
will be multiplied by z cause you've got a

344
00:22:53,111 --> 00:22:54,280
bigger nuclear charge,

345
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:59,230
but every distance gets
shrunk by a factorZ ,

346
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:04,330
right? So if you average everything,
what are you going to get?

347
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:11,260
There are two factors of z that
are increasing or decreasing,

348
00:23:11,261 --> 00:23:15,790
making more favorable that the,
the energy, the potential energy,

349
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:18,940
you got that two factors.
So what's going to be

350
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:26,340
z squared? Right? So the
potential energy, well,

351
00:23:26,341 --> 00:23:28,270
what did the kinetic energy go with?

352
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:33,010
Do you remember how the potential
energies that the health department,

353
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:37,300
how the kinetic energy scaled
z squared,

354
00:23:37,301 --> 00:23:38,950
how does the potential energy scale?

355
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:45,800
How about the average potential energy?
If I doubled the nuclear charge,

356
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,500
how much lower is the obvious?
As I increased the charge,

357
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:56,120
the average energy of electrons is
going to get lower, but for two reasons,

358
00:23:56,390 --> 00:24:00,170
because the nuclear charge is bigger
and because of the electron is twice as

359
00:24:00,171 --> 00:24:01,004
close.

360
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:03,403
Okay.

361
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:08,090
So how does it scale the potential energy?
AverageZ squared?

362
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,850
So the kinetic energy
scales with z squared,

363
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:15,920
the potential energy scales with z
squared. How about the total energy?

364
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:19,820
This is a hard one. Z squared, right?

365
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:25,310
Okay. So the potential energy goes
to z squared and the total energy,

366
00:24:25,311 --> 00:24:28,010
here's a big surprise.
It goes with z squared to,

367
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:34,380
it also happens to be one over n squared,
right?

368
00:24:34,381 --> 00:24:35,610
So the energy gets,

369
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,790
uh,
uh,

370
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:44,520
yeah. So as you go up in, you
get less stable. Right? Now,

371
00:24:44,521 --> 00:24:47,850
our turns out to be about
300 kilocalories per mole.

372
00:24:47,851 --> 00:24:49,950
If you want to really get
what the energies are,

373
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:52,230
and here is a plot of the energies.

374
00:24:52,231 --> 00:24:57,231
Here's the the the one s two s or two p
three s or three p or three d four s pdf

375
00:25:01,951 --> 00:25:05,610
and so on, right? But
the distance from zero,

376
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:09,810
the amount of stabilization is
proportional to one over n squared.

377
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:14,960
And we saw the same thing if we did
in the one dimensional Coolum case,

378
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,780
the energy was also one over n

379
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,150
x squared.

380
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:23,390
Okay?

381
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:28,390
Notice it's independent of l and m three
s is the same as three p is the same as

382
00:25:30,381 --> 00:25:34,190
three d does that square with
what you have learned before?

383
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:36,920
What did you learn before

384
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:43,280
Lexi?
Did you learn anything about that before?

385
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:46,670
About the energies of
three s three p three d

386
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:49,483
no.

387
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:55,060
Anybody Chai?

388
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,890
Shy.
Yes,

389
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,670
as lower is lower than p is lower than d.

390
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:07,920
Now how can both of these things be true
that you heard something that was true

391
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:09,840
and I'm telling you they're all the same.

392
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:22,480
Aha.
What you heard about was real outcomes,

393
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:26,590
things that have many electrons.
I'm telling you about.

394
00:26:26,591 --> 00:26:31,060
If the Adam has only one electron,
then s and p and d are the same,

395
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:32,321
okay.

396
00:26:32,321 --> 00:26:35,950
But it'll be different when you have
many electrons and we'll see why shortly.

397
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:41,590
Okay? Cause this is one
electron atoms, okay? So we've,

398
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:45,120
this just summarizes size
goes with one over z.

399
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:47,790
The electron density is proportional,

400
00:26:47,791 --> 00:26:51,810
dizzy cubed and the energy goes with z
squared. Whether you're talking potential,

401
00:26:51,811 --> 00:26:53,160
kinetic or total energy.

402
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:56,910
Uh,
okay.

403
00:26:57,790 --> 00:27:00,160
And it's also one over n squared.

404
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:02,940
Uh,

405
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:06,980
and the size happens to be
an over Z as well. Okay?

406
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:12,020
Now here's a really pretty one
and to do this, to see this,

407
00:27:12,021 --> 00:27:13,910
right,
you want to see the real thing.

408
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:19,100
So notice that this is a two p orbital,
n l m R two,

409
00:27:19,101 --> 00:27:21,230
one, one. Everybody see that?

410
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:24,470
I want to show you the real
program that does that.

411
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:27,110
Let me just see if I
can get it bigger here.

412
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:38,260
Okay, now what I want for the display,

413
00:27:38,261 --> 00:27:42,370
this display is just as if
electrons were all white, okay?

414
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:47,560
But we want to call them according
to the, to the, uh, color of the,

415
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:51,790
uh, uh, this is complicated.
Now I've got to get over here.

416
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:56,260
We want to color them with the
phase, you know, plus minus.

417
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:09,220
That's three d.
The phase keeps changing.

418
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:13,150
That has to do with time dependence,

419
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:17,350
which we're not talking
about. Okay, now that's,

420
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:21,970
that's a three d orbital. We want to
have what we have before we had to pee,

421
00:28:21,971 --> 00:28:26,590
right? So I'll make this instead of a
three, a two. So there's a two p orbital,

422
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:31,900
uh, particular two p orbital
two one zero that term,

423
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:36,700
which one is that? Notice you have
a coordinate system next door there.

424
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:39,490
And I can rotate this thing.
I can grab it and rotate it.

425
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:44,050
The coordinate system rotates.
See that? So I can look at it,

426
00:28:44,051 --> 00:28:48,520
end on if I want to or look at it from
the side. Which p orbital is that?

427
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:53,800
How do you know points
along the z axis? Okay,

428
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:55,930
now let's look up the,
at another,

429
00:28:56,230 --> 00:29:00,550
another two p orbital because we
can make em one instead of zero.

430
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:05,500
So the two one zero is two
peasy. Now what's two? One,

431
00:29:05,501 --> 00:29:06,334
one.

432
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:11,020
Let me look at it this way.

433
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,870
That's time dependence,
right? And that's weird.

434
00:29:16,871 --> 00:29:21,871
And physicists love this sort of thing
because they deal with Adams in isolation

435
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:27,520
and Adams and isolation
have angular momentum,

436
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:32,410
things going around. But Adam's,
when they're in molecules,

437
00:29:32,411 --> 00:29:36,760
when they're with other Adams or
in other things that distort it,

438
00:29:36,761 --> 00:29:39,850
like in an electric field,
they don't behave that way.

439
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:45,010
So use a different way of doing it,
right?

440
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:49,450
It's not that physicists are right and
chemists are wrong or the chemists are

441
00:29:49,451 --> 00:29:50,980
right and physicists are wrong.

442
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:54,550
It's if you're dealing with
isolated Adams or you use one thing.

443
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:57,520
If you're dealing with atoms
interacting with other items,

444
00:29:57,521 --> 00:30:01,210
you should use something else.
And the way you do this,

445
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,550
dealing with something else,
I'll show you here,

446
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:06,760
you do what's called super position.

447
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:12,270
That is you add two functions
in order to get a new function.

448
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:14,710
Okay?

449
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:19,000
And the two functions I'm going to add
when I click superposition here are two

450
00:30:19,001 --> 00:30:19,361
one,

451
00:30:19,361 --> 00:30:24,361
one and the other one I'm going
to use is to one minus one

452
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:29,430
and now what's that?

453
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:36,030
That's the two p orbital. Okay?
Does everybody see what I did?

454
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:41,990
So I can combine two of the physicists
or bottles to get the chemist to p why

455
00:30:42,001 --> 00:30:45,540
orbital Dean Boucher who
wrote this as a physicist.

456
00:30:45,541 --> 00:30:47,850
So he writes physicists programs,
right?

457
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:52,350
But we can trick it to be chemistry
by adding two of his together or by

458
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:54,750
subtracting them.
And when you subtract them,

459
00:30:54,751 --> 00:30:59,460
you have to put an I in imaginary.
So I'm not going to do it right now.

460
00:30:59,461 --> 00:31:02,040
You can do it yourself.
You'll see down here or you can,

461
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:06,060
you can do the phase and so on.
The phase of Pi makes it imaginary.

462
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:10,520
I won't do that. Now
we'll go back to the, uh,

463
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,990
did the PowerPoint.
Whoops, what happened here?

464
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:18,280
I need to shrink it back again

465
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,900
and now do this.

466
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:24,703
There we go.

467
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:29,250
Yeah. Here we are. We're back.
They look the same. Okay. Uh,

468
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:34,280
so superposition of that kind when you
add two functions together to get a new

469
00:31:34,681 --> 00:31:39,120
function for whatever purpose is a
kind of what's called hybrid ization.

470
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:43,620
Now there are other kinds of hybrids. Have
you heard about hybrid orbitals? Right?

471
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:48,030
What that is is adding two
orbitals together to get a
new orbital and let's look

472
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:49,920
about when that would be.
As we said,

473
00:31:49,921 --> 00:31:54,921
this is the physicist to p m equals one
with orbital angular momentum and it has

474
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:00,060
complex numbers involved and
the chemists to p is that some,

475
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:04,020
okay,
now multiplying and adding wave functions.

476
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:08,310
We've already seen a case
where you multiply functions.

477
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,560
Do you remember where we've
seen things be multiplied?

478
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,040
Alison, do you remember? No.

479
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,190
Multiplied which way functions?

480
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:27,450
Let me tell you one place we already
multiplied was squaring away functioned as

481
00:32:27,451 --> 00:32:30,330
a kind of multiplication. They get
probability, but I want a different one.

482
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:33,750
The different different variables.

483
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:37,570
Ah, for separating the
variables, r theta and fee.

484
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:41,480
We had an ar function to say to function
a fee function and we multiply these

485
00:32:41,481 --> 00:32:45,890
pieces together to get the total
wave function for the electron,

486
00:32:45,891 --> 00:32:49,940
the three dimensional wave functions.
So that's one place you multiply. Okay.

487
00:32:49,941 --> 00:32:51,740
To get a one electron wave function,

488
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:56,770
which is we call an orbital and orbital
is a one electron wave function.

489
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:02,390
That's what an orbital is.
Now you can add or,

490
00:33:02,391 --> 00:33:07,070
but alls to create a hybrid orbital.
That's what we just did.

491
00:33:07,071 --> 00:33:09,780
We took,
we took a two physicists,

492
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:14,690
orbitals added them together
and got a new orbital. Okay.

493
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:20,530
2:00 PM Two p y plus two peasy is a
hybrid orbital and orbitals one electron

494
00:33:21,951 --> 00:33:24,770
wave function.
What's the function of,

495
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:31,040
what variables do you put in in order
to get a value out? How many variables?

496
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:35,120
Sovi three.
What are they?

497
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:41,000
The position of that electron.
The one electron,

498
00:33:41,001 --> 00:33:45,170
if it's a one electron orbital, you can
write the orbital as many pieces here.

499
00:33:45,171 --> 00:33:47,000
Two pieces,
right?

500
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:51,260
But it still is a function of
just the position of one electron.

501
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:55,640
It's not a function of six or 18 or
whatever number of variables. It's just,

502
00:33:56,030 --> 00:34:00,470
uh, it's just a function of, it's
an orbital, a one electron function.

503
00:34:00,471 --> 00:34:02,900
So it's a position of one
electron that you plug in.

504
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:08,500
Now you can change orientation
of orbitals by hybridization.

505
00:34:08,511 --> 00:34:11,870
Let's look at that.
So here's the two PZ orbital,

506
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:16,280
I've rotated the coordinate
system. So Z is horizontal. Okay?

507
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:18,800
And here's the two P why orbital,

508
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:23,720
which we already made by adding two
physicist orbitals together. Okay.

509
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:25,130
Now what happens?

510
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:30,370
And notice that two p y surprise as
pointed along the y axis to Pz was pointed

511
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:33,890
along the z axis.
What if I add the two together?

512
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:38,080
Yeah.

513
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:43,060
What if I add two Pz and two p y? Now
let's go back and look at two Pz a second.

514
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:47,950
Notice it's red on the left blue on the
right. Say positive numbers on the left.

515
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,570
Negative numbers on the right,

516
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:53,620
everybody with me because it assigns
numbers to different points in space.

517
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:58,030
Positive numbers on the left,
negative on the right. Let's say.

518
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:02,500
Now this one assigns
positive numbers on the top.

519
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:07,570
Negative numbers on the bottom.
Suppose I add together,

520
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,430
what am I going to get

521
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,033
Andrew?

522
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:14,310
Ah,
it should.

523
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:18,480
They should reinforce in the top left
where they're both positive and in the

524
00:35:18,481 --> 00:35:20,370
bottom right where they're both negative,

525
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:23,550
but in the bottom left and the top right,
they should cancel.

526
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:29,710
So if we add them together
to make a weighted sum it,

527
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:34,220
we don't have to add them 50 50, but
we'll start by adding 50 50. Okay.

528
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:39,600
So if we add them, uh, 50, 50 mixture,

529
00:35:39,601 --> 00:35:43,050
we'll give that just what you said.
Okay.

530
00:35:43,051 --> 00:35:47,790
So we changed the orientation
of the p orbital by,

531
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,820
by adding two,
okay.

532
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:53,160
Now suppose we didn't use 50%.

533
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:56,250
Suppose we used another mixture.

534
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,310
Suppose we use 75% right?

535
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:04,430
Or there's 50% or 25% okay?

536
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:09,150
So you can get any orientation you want
by mixing within that plane though,

537
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:14,010
within the, the, uh, y z
plane by adjusting the ratio.

538
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:20,760
Okay. There's two pui. Now, what
would happen with a two s orbital?

539
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:22,860
If you put it in an electric field,

540
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:27,580
you're changing the rules.

541
00:36:27,581 --> 00:36:32,480
You're changing the potential because now
the electron has a, does, doesn't just,

542
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:35,020
it's energy doesn't depend just
on assistance from the nucleus.

543
00:36:35,021 --> 00:36:37,960
It also depends on where
it is in the field is.

544
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:42,730
So we're changing the
definition of, of, uh, of, um,

545
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:47,500
of the potential energy. So it's a
different quantum mechanical problem.

546
00:36:47,501 --> 00:36:49,480
But I don't want you to think
about quantum mechanics.

547
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:53,650
I just want you to think about what would
happen if you put an electric field on.

548
00:36:53,651 --> 00:36:58,480
What do you think? What
would it move? The Adam? No,

549
00:36:58,481 --> 00:37:03,481
because the Adam is neutral overall
where we'll do a hydrogen atom here.

550
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:06,370
Yeah, Adam's neutral so it won't
move. But what will happen?

551
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:11,710
The electrons will move one way and the
nucleus will move the other and if you

552
00:37:11,711 --> 00:37:15,040
preserve the center of mass right,

553
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,120
then the nucleus will hardly move at all.

554
00:37:17,121 --> 00:37:20,440
I'm the electrons will do
most of the moving. Okay,

555
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:24,520
so you can change the
shape by hybridization.

556
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:27,970
We can get something that will
work in an electric field.

557
00:37:27,971 --> 00:37:32,120
Describe Adam an electric field by
mixing the ones without electric field.

558
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,310
Now let's look how we do that.

559
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:38,380
We make an s p n hybrid orbital.
Have you ever seen that?

560
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:39,400
And as a number,

561
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:44,820
can you give me an example to sp two or
three SB three R S P or n is one right

562
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:50,950
or s p zero have you ever seen that?

563
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,470
S P zero is just ass.

564
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:59,000
This is how much p there is in
it after you square it. That is,

565
00:37:59,001 --> 00:38:01,520
it's a weighted psalm.
This thing you're using,

566
00:38:01,521 --> 00:38:06,350
you've got different values of a and
B and it's weighted, uh, such that,

567
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:08,210
so when you square it,

568
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:13,940
you get a squared fraction of two
s squared. That's the distribution.

569
00:38:13,941 --> 00:38:18,941
Two s would have a B squared of
the way P why would be one squared.

570
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:26,060
But you also get across term to a,
B times two s times two p. Okay?

571
00:38:26,061 --> 00:38:30,260
Now, so n the number you
put in to talk about sp two,

572
00:38:30,261 --> 00:38:34,040
sp three and so on is the square
of be square over a square.

573
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:36,160
So if you have an hybrid,

574
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:40,180
it means equal parts of of s and p.

575
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:41,980
And if you have sp three,

576
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:47,110
it means three times as
much p as s after squaring.

577
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:48,610
Okay?

578
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:52,540
So it's what fraction you have of of
something that looks like two es squared

579
00:38:52,541 --> 00:38:55,570
and two p squared. And then
there's also that part. Okay,

580
00:38:55,571 --> 00:39:00,070
so now let's just look at some
examples here. Suppose n is zero,

581
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:03,190
then you have just pure ass.
Okay?

582
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:07,480
Now suppose you put an electric field
that wants to shift the electrons,

583
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:11,740
it wants to shift. It would push
a positive charge to the right,

584
00:39:11,741 --> 00:39:15,100
but it will push electrons to the left.
Okay,

585
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:20,260
so let's here we went to
0.02 just a tiny amount of p.

586
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:24,880
Let's see how it,
here's back to s and there's spo point,

587
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:30,280
0.02 it shifted the electrons to the left.
What if I go to a higher value

588
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:33,161
point?

589
00:39:33,161 --> 00:39:38,161
4.0 4.0 6.0 9.11 point 18.2 5.33 so what
I'm doing is turning up a dial to make

590
00:39:47,081 --> 00:39:51,730
the electron electric fields stronger
and the electron is shifting by changing

591
00:39:51,731 --> 00:39:56,420
the hybridisation. Okay, 0.5 uh,

592
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:59,080
one there's an sp hybrid.

593
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:04,900
Now what will happen if I keep on
going make an sp two is for example,

594
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:10,300
what do you think will happen?
Guess it'll keep going to the right,

595
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:15,270
wrong. Watch this. There's a,

596
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:19,750
that's the maximum extension is sp.
That's the most you can extend.

597
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:22,120
Now watch what happens
if I make it bigger.

598
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:27,390
Sp Two sp three sp four sp nine

599
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:34,360
s p 24
pure p,

600
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:38,470
right? Cause both pure s
and pure p are symmetrical.

601
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:42,280
The 50 50 mixture is the one
that shifts the most of the left.

602
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:48,160
Okay. Now we're going
to close here, uh, with,

603
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:52,000
with trying to go beyond
what we've already seen.

604
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:55,900
What we've seen is one electron
Adams, right? Hydrogen like Adams.

605
00:40:56,290 --> 00:41:01,290
So we find that we can multiply pieces
are theta fee to create this one electron

606
00:41:02,801 --> 00:41:04,240
wave function,
the orbital.

607
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:08,770
And we can furthermore add these things
to make hybrids that shift things around

608
00:41:08,771 --> 00:41:13,480
in useful ways. We can add orbitals
to make an sp hybrid, for example,

609
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:17,800
as what would happen in an electric field,
but it's still an orbital.

610
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:22,240
So it allows adjusting to new situations,
for example,

611
00:41:22,241 --> 00:41:27,010
an electric field while preserving the
virtues of real solutions of the nuclear

612
00:41:27,011 --> 00:41:27,820
potential.

613
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:32,820
Because you never put on a field as
strong as the field felt by the electron

614
00:41:34,281 --> 00:41:35,450
near a nucleus.

615
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:40,040
Adding the external field by turning
up your dial is just a small change.

616
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:43,730
So you want things to look pretty much
like what they looked originally with the

617
00:41:43,731 --> 00:41:48,020
nucleus. Just a little change. And
you can do that by hybridization.

618
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:53,690
Okay? The big deal is the nuclear
potential at small distances.

619
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:59,210
Now let's try to go to a two
electron wave function. Okay,

620
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:03,980
so what is it a function of? What's a
two electron wave function going to be?

621
00:42:03,981 --> 00:42:05,810
A function of how many variables,

622
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:11,240
right? Six, right? X, Y,

623
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:13,850
Z for one electron and x,
Y,

624
00:42:13,851 --> 00:42:18,851
Z for the other electron or r theta
fee of electron one and r theta fee of

625
00:42:19,791 --> 00:42:22,550
electron two and they're
on the same nucleus.

626
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:24,890
So you measure the distances
from the same point,

627
00:42:24,891 --> 00:42:28,940
but they're two different distances. One,
two, electron, one another to electron to,

628
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:33,560
they couldn't be the same, but they don't
need to be. They can be different. Okay.

629
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:39,800
Now, wouldn't it be neat?
That's the question mark.

630
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:44,810
If we could get that by multiplying
two one electron wave functions,

631
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:47,660
because we have one electron
wave functions cold,

632
00:42:47,661 --> 00:42:50,060
we look in the table and
we've got the exact thing.

633
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:53,510
If we could take two of those
and multiply them together.

634
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:58,720
So orbital a four electron one times or,

635
00:42:59,091 --> 00:43:03,650
but it'll be for electron to remember
what these things are. Just numbers.

636
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:05,300
If you put in some value of,

637
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:10,500
of position of electron one and some value
of position of electron to this first

638
00:43:10,701 --> 00:43:13,670
thing, we'll give you a number. The
second thing, we'll give you a number.

639
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:17,510
If you could multiply those two numbers
together and get the number for the

640
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:21,110
total way function, that
would be really great, right?

641
00:43:21,111 --> 00:43:25,040
Cause then you'd know how to do it. The
question is, can you do that? Remember,

642
00:43:25,041 --> 00:43:27,230
an orbital isn't one
electron wave function.

643
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:32,240
So can we multiply orbitals in order
to get a many electron wave function?

644
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,000
Okay.
If we could,

645
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:39,890
and then of course we would square
it to get probability density.

646
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:42,050
Now it would be a different probability.

647
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:45,740
In the first case it was probability
of electron B one being here.

648
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:50,270
Now it's the joint probability of
electron. One is here and electron too.

649
00:43:50,271 --> 00:43:54,230
At the same time is here. That's the
probability when you have six variables.

650
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:59,960
Okay. Wouldn't that be
great? It's just paradise,

651
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:04,520
right?
Because if we had many electrons,

652
00:44:04,521 --> 00:44:07,040
we could just multiply all
those orbitals together.

653
00:44:07,041 --> 00:44:08,630
A certain normal for electron one,

654
00:44:08,631 --> 00:44:11,180
another robot of electron to
another one for electron three.

655
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:14,990
We know how to write those, multiply
them together. We get the thing. Uh,

656
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:19,340
we find the total energy
is whatever energy electron
one had plus written energy

657
00:44:19,341 --> 00:44:24,230
electron to head. That's great. Uh,
we find the total electron density.

658
00:44:24,350 --> 00:44:27,710
We know how to find the electron
density of each individual electron.

659
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:30,860
So the total electron density
should be just the, some of,

660
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:34,740
so if we were interested in the total
electron density at this particular point,

661
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:39,930
we'd see what the electron density of
electron one is at that point and what the

662
00:44:39,931 --> 00:44:42,900
electron density of electron
to is at that point.

663
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:46,350
And we'd add them together and that
would give the total electron density at

664
00:44:46,351 --> 00:44:50,640
that point. So the total electron
density is a function of x, y, Z.

665
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:54,960
It's whatever this is evaluated at Xyz
plus whatever this plus all the others.

666
00:44:55,350 --> 00:45:00,310
Absolutely. Wonderful. Right? And
then you could write things. Uh,

667
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:03,660
so the whole is the sum of the parts.
Right?

668
00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:08,310
And you could write things like this at
the top that neon has the configuration,

669
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:13,460
two electrons in one s two electrons in
two s two electrons and two px to Bwi

670
00:45:13,681 --> 00:45:16,110
and right. Things like that.
You've seen things like that.

671
00:45:16,770 --> 00:45:21,210
So those are the orbitals in which
electrons are to describe the Neon Adam.

672
00:45:22,370 --> 00:45:23,480
Right now,

673
00:45:25,270 --> 00:45:28,090
uh,
this is a problem in joint probability,

674
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:34,480
so it's like tossing two
coins to try to get two heads.

675
00:45:35,350 --> 00:45:38,590
So I don't know if I can do these at the
same time, but I have two quarters here.

676
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:45,870
I need your back back in your
head. Okay, so I got tails.

677
00:45:45,871 --> 00:45:47,610
When did you get how often?

678
00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:53,340
Half the time that actually,
if I get tails and you get heads,

679
00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:55,260
that's a quarter of the time,

680
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:58,020
but a quarter of the time you'll
get tails and I'll get heads.

681
00:45:58,350 --> 00:46:02,100
So heads tails is half the time.
How about heads heads?

682
00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:06,300
How often or does I now I'll bet you,

683
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:12,320
I'll bet you that I can get head
head half the time actually doing the

684
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:16,620
experiment.
You want to take the bet?

685
00:46:17,550 --> 00:46:21,750
I would advise against it.
Here's what I'm going to do.

686
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:31,633
Okay,

687
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:35,840
two tails.
I lose

688
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:42,550
book two tails I lost again.

689
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:44,710
But I think you can see that
I've been doing a lot of time.

690
00:46:44,711 --> 00:46:49,030
I'm going to win half the time.
Why? Why was the rule wrong?

691
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:54,970
Cause they weren't independent,
right? If they're independent,

692
00:46:54,971 --> 00:46:57,730
the probability of both a and B,

693
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:02,500
that is the probability that a will
be here and at the same time be,

694
00:47:02,501 --> 00:47:06,460
we'll be here is the product
of the probabilities.

695
00:47:06,461 --> 00:47:11,290
But that if you do this,
that's not true anymore, right?

696
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:14,860
So if you have two electron wave function,

697
00:47:15,370 --> 00:47:19,600
you square it to get the
joint probability, right?

698
00:47:19,601 --> 00:47:23,170
That electron one will be
here and electron two will
be here at the same time.

699
00:47:23,650 --> 00:47:28,360
So is that valid to multiply here I'm
multiplying the individual probabilities

700
00:47:28,361 --> 00:47:32,200
that electron is at a certain position.
Electron B is at another position.

701
00:47:32,201 --> 00:47:34,180
Do I get the joint probability that way?

702
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:38,770
Under what conditions do I get the
joint probability that way if they're

703
00:47:38,771 --> 00:47:42,460
independent. Now here's the big
question. Are they independent?

704
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:47,590
Why not positive, cool ohms
law. They repel one another.

705
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:50,950
There's no way they can be independent.
They repel one another.

706
00:47:51,130 --> 00:47:56,130
So orbitals one electron wave functions
to express many electron wave functions

707
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:01,090
cannot be right.

708
00:48:02,830 --> 00:48:07,830
Orbitals are a fiction except
for one electron problems,

709
00:48:09,570 --> 00:48:13,060
right? Hydrogen like Adam's find
we've got hydrogen atoms cold.

710
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:17,830
But if you got more than one electron,
orbitals won't work.

711
00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:23,230
But still we're going to use them.
Right?

712
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:27,860
And that's what you're going to find
out after the exam. Okay, good. Lockton,

713
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:31,990
uh, so that doesn't work.
Good luck on the exam.
