00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.790
A recipe for oatmeal cookies
calls for 2 cups of flour

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.160
for every 3 cups of oatmeal.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.630
How much flour is
needed for a big batch

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:12.592
of cookies that uses
9 cups of oatmeal?

00:00:12.592 --> 00:00:14.300
So let's think about
what they're saying.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.239
They're saying 2 cups of flour.

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:25.345
So 2 cups of flour for
every 3 cups of oatmeal.

00:00:39.349 --> 00:00:40.890
And so they're
saying, how much flour

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.570
is needed for a big
batch of cookies

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.700
that uses 9 cups of oatmeal?

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.200
Now we're going to
go to a situation

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.580
where we are using
9 cups of oatmeal.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:56.187
Let me write it this
way-- 9 cups of oatmeal.

00:00:56.187 --> 00:00:58.020
And I'll show you a
couple of different ways

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.769
to think about it.

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:01.900
And whatever works
for you, that works.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.695
So one way to think about
it, so we're wondering.

00:01:04.695 --> 00:01:06.070
We're going to
say, look, we know

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.130
if we have 3 cups of oatmeal,
we should use 2 cups of flour.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.170
But what we don't know is if
we have 9 cups of oatmeal,

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.220
how many cups of
flour do we use?

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.812
That's what they're asking us.

00:01:15.812 --> 00:01:17.520
But if we're going
from 3 cups of oatmeal

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.330
to 9 cups of oatmeal, how much
more oatmeal are we using?

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.530
Well, we're using three
times more oatmeal, Right?

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.934
We're multiplying by 3.

00:01:26.934 --> 00:01:28.600
3 cups of oatmeal and
9 cups of oatmeal,

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.700
we're using 3 times the oatmeal.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.070
Well, if we want to use
flour in the same proportion,

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.650
we have to use 3
times the flour.

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.190
So then we're also going to
multiply the flour times 3.

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:40.940
We're going to multiply
the flour times 3,

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.220
so we're going to have
to use 6 cups of flour.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.050
Ignore that question mark.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.550
And that answers the question.

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.110
That's how much flour we need
for a big batch of cookies

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:58.840
that uses 9 cups of oatmeal.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.040
The other thing is you
could set up a proportion.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:15.300
You could say 2 cups of
flour over 3 cups of oatmeal

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.060
is equal to question mark.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.610
And instead of
writing question mark,

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.030
I'll put a variable in there.

00:02:23.161 --> 00:02:24.910
Actually, let me put
a question mark there

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.560
just so you really
understand it is

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.530
equal to a question
mark in a box number

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:37.615
cups of flour over
9 cups of oatmeal.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.047
And so I like this
first way we did it

00:02:44.047 --> 00:02:45.630
because it's really
just common sense.

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.370
If we're tripling the
oatmeal, then we're

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.440
going to have to
triple the flour

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.820
to make the recipe in
the same proportion.

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.030
Another way, once you set
up an equation like this,

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.160
is actually to do a
little bit of algebra.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.140
Some people might call
it cross-multiplying,

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.770
but that
cross-multiplying is still

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.420
using a little bit of algebra.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.780
And I'll show you why they're
really the same thing.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.300
In cross-multiplication,
whenever

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.160
you have a proportion
set up like this,

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.920
people will multiply
the diagonals.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.030
So when you use
cross-multiplication,

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:21.020
you'll say that 2 times 9
must be equal to question mark

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:27.620
times 3, must be equal to
whatever is in this question

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.420
mark, the number of
cups of flour times 3.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.750
Or we get 18 is
equal to whatever

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.380
our question mark was times 3.

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.640
So the number of cups of
flour we need to use times 3

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.170
needs to be equal to 18.

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.430
What times 3 is equal 18?

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.180
You might be able to
do that in your head.

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.030
That is 6.

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.400
Or you could divide both sides
by 3, and you will get 6.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.770
So we get question
mark in a box needs

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:59.070
to be equal to 6 cups of flour.

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.575
Same answer we got through
kind of common sense.

00:04:01.575 --> 00:04:02.950
Now, you might be
wondering, hey,

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.530
this cross-multiplying doesn't
make any intuitive sense.

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.090
Why does that work?

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.510
If I have something set up
like this proportion set up,

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.490
why does it work that if I
take the denominator here

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:14.490
and multiply it by the
numerator there that that

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:15.906
needs to be equal
to the numerator

00:04:15.906 --> 00:04:17.560
here times the
denominator there?

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.560
And that comes from
straight up algebra.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.760
And to do that, I'm just going
to rewrite this part as x just

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.580
to simplify the
writing a little bit.

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.350
So we have 2/3 is equal to--
instead of that question mark,

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.110
I'll write x over 9.

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:32.830
And in algebra,
all you're saying

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.500
is that this
quantity over here is

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.850
equal to this
quantity over here.

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:38.840
So if you do anything
to what's on the left,

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.310
if you want it to
still be equal,

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.400
if the thing on the right
still needs to be equal,

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.470
you have to do the
same thing to it.

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.220
Now, what we want to do is we
want to simplify this so all

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.530
we have on the
right-hand side is an x.

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.309
So what can we
multiply this by so

00:04:52.309 --> 00:04:53.600
that we're just left with an x?

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.520
So that we've solved for x?

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.550
Well, if we multiply
this times 9,

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.390
the 9's are going to cancel out.

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:00.970
So let's multiply
the right by 9.

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:02.844
But of course, if we
multiply the right by 9,

00:05:02.844 --> 00:05:04.850
we have to still
multiply the left by 9.

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:06.740
Otherwise they still
wouldn't be equal.

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.470
If they were equal before
being multiplied by 9, for them

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:12.720
to still be equal, you have to
multiply 9 times both sides.

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.760
On the right-hand side,
the 9's cancel out,

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.330
so you're just left with an x.

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:21.490
On the left-hand side, you have
9 times 2/3, or 9/1 times 2/3.

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.770
Or this is equal to 18/3.

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:28.300
And we know that 18/3
is the same thing as 6.

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.440
So these are all
legitimate ways to do it.

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.340
I wanted you to understand
that what I'm doing right here

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:32.840
is algebra.

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.840
That's actually the reasoning
why cross-multiplication works.

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.950
But for a really simple
problem like this,

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:39.740
you could really just
use common sense.

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:43.520
If you're increasing the cups
of oatmeal by a factor of 3,

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.799
then increase the cups of
flour by a factor of 3.
