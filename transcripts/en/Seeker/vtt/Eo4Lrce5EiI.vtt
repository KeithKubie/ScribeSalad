00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:04.600
The Food and Drug Administration recently
announced companies will be required to remove

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:10.000
trans fats from their foods over the next
few years.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.439
But, like, what is a trans fat?

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:22.539
Trans fat gets a lot of bad press, but that's
because fat is a tough cookie; some are good

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:24.179
for you, some are bad for you.

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:28.109
Fat isn't just FAT there's a lot of different
KINDS of fat.

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.390
Each type manifests differently, and…

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.999
#WHEW it's complicated.

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:36.520
Fats coat membranes, store energy, protect
vital organs and insulate tissues.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.190
The word "lipid" is a general term for a group
of hydrocarbons -- that is to say a string

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.590
of carbon atoms surrounded by hydrogen atoms
-- which includes all fats and many other

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.300
basic molecules in the body.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.640
Triglycerides, cholesterols, and Vitamins
like A,D,E, and K are all lipids[1].

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.120
Different fat sources each form chains a little
differently; and those arrangements change

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.800
how your body can process them.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.841
The three main lipids you hear about in the
food world are saturated fats, unsaturated

00:01:03.841 --> 00:01:05.940
fats and trans fats.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:11.530
Picture a parking lot, if the hydrogen atoms
are the cars -- saturated fats are saturated

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.200
-- or FILLED with hydrogen -- all the spots
are full.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.240
Unsaturated fats have some spaces here or
there; and the shape of the molecules determines

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.340
their behavior[2][3].

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.190
Saturated fats are solid at room temperature
because the filled up molecules are more rigid;

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.250
they usually come from animals, but are also
found in coconut oil and palm oil.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:37.360
Whereas unsaturated fats have more room for
hydrogen, which allows the molecules to fold

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.360
over.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.430
This folding allows them to stay liquid at
room temperatures -- we think of them as oils[4]!

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.190
These mostly come from plants, and are sometimes
just called vegetable oils; olive oil, corn

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.060
oil, and peanut oil are all unsaturated fats.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.860
Mono-unsaturated fats are called "good" fats[5].

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.800
They're much easier to produce so companies
came up with a way to convert these liquid

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.620
lipids to solids in a process called HYDROGENATION.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:07.360
Hydrogenated oils have been chemically altered
to move the hydrogen around and fill up more

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.879
of the empty parking spaces in the chain…

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:15.560
They try to make cheaper plant fats look more
like expensive animal fats; think margarine

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.750
or shortening[6].

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.400
Because they have to alter the hydrogen bonds,
these hydrogenated oils, are ALSO known as

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.400
TRANS FATS[7].

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.170
Up until the early 1980s, saturated animal
fats like beef tallow were used to make french

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.620
fries, until it was thought saturated fats
could raise levels of bad or Low-density lipoprotein

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.569
cholesterol -- causing increased risk of heart
disease.

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:43.530
The public was alarmed, so companies switched
to *partially hydrogenated vegetable oil.*

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.860
Recently, studies like one in the Annals of
Internal Medicine from last year[8] -- show

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.629
that saturated fat is not nearly the demon
it was made out to be and might be entirely

00:02:52.629 --> 00:03:00.999
neutral, but that TRANS FAT is TERRIBLE: causing
increases in LDL cholesterol and decreases

00:03:00.999 --> 00:03:03.540
in High-density lipoprotein -- or good cholesterol[9][10].

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.900
In fact, studies have found diets high in
trans fats correlate with memory loss, heart

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.890
disease, and obesity[11].

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.049
Overall the FDA ban might be a little late
to the party.

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:21.430
From 2003 to 2012 the amount of trans fats
consumed has dropped 78 percent, mainly due

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.599
to food labeling, but it's better late than
never.

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:28.800
Commonly, you hear people say, "Everything
in moderation," which works for saturated

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.709
and unsaturated fats, but for trans fat?

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:32.969
None.

00:03:32.969 --> 00:03:37.249
The CDC says to keep "trans fatty acid consumption
as low as possible[12]!"

00:03:37.249 --> 00:03:38.249
Wow.

00:03:38.249 --> 00:03:39.249
That's HUGE!

00:03:39.249 --> 00:03:40.249
Trans fats, not even once.

00:03:40.249 --> 00:03:41.249
What's your favorite type of good fat?

00:03:41.249 --> 00:03:42.249
Avocados?

00:03:42.249 --> 00:03:43.249
Nuts?

00:03:43.249 --> 00:03:44.249
Olive oil?????

00:03:44.249 --> 00:03:45.249
I LUVVV olive oil.

00:03:45.249 --> 00:03:46.249
MMM.

00:03:46.249 --> 00:03:47.249
