00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:02.170
- Well, bladesmiths, your
weapons

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:03.790
will now be put through
a series of three tests.

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:05.960
There will be a strength
test, a sharpness test,

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.380
and up first, the kill test.

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:07.960
Doug.

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:14.120
Bladesmiths, this
is the kill test.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.120
To see what kind of lethal
damage your weapon will do,

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:18.500
I will take your
weapon and deliver

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.250
some slashes and thrusts
on this pig carcass.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:23.710
Ethan, you're up first.
Are you ready?

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:25.920
I am so ready.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.380
I have never made a sword
anywhere near this large

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:30.750
before.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.000
I came in to it with
a mindset of victory,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.250
so we'll see how this goes.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.420
Bladesmiths, please
welcome back Anthony Palmer.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.830
Anthony is one of the chief
instructor of Marcaida Kail,

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.080
and today he will
have the pleasure

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.250
of wielding your weapons.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.330
I was actually hoping
for Dave Baker on a horse,

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:47.420
but this is a good secondary.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.750
[music playing]

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:08.210
All right.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.120
How'd it feel?

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.580
First up, there were
no issues whatsoever

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.420
with your edge over here.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.580
It is sharp.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.620
It lacerates and cuts clean.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.120
Look at that-- razor
cuts right there.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.880
On the thrust, you
have an angle here

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.040
that allowed for a deep
thrust, pulling out

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.710
and slashing on the way out.

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.960
Overall, your weapon will kill.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:32.790
All right, Liam.
Your turn.

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.210
You ready?
- Oh, yeah.

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:35.960
Let's do it.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.710
After a catastrophic fire, loss
of equipment, critical tools,

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.540
still made another blade with
10 hours left on the clock.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.830
I'm happy with the fact
that I got the sword

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.000
done for the challenge.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.080
But so many things
could go wrong.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.170
I don't even know if I was able
to get a good, solid temper

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.670
on this blade.

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.250
I just hope that this
wasn't for nothing.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.620
[music playing]

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.170
Well, Liam, let me say
this-- first up, your presence

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.670
here is a victory.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.380
All the things that
you went through,

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.710
and you still turn
in a blade that's

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.170
beautiful in craftsmanship,
that is very sharp.

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.710
But your blade did break.

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.540
And you can see right
here in the cross section,

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.170
there's a discoloration
down here.

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.710
So something happened in
your heat treating process,

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.710
and it may have micro-fractures.

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:45.380
It is what it is.

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.790
Liam, there was a
flaw in your blade

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.790
that led to a catastrophic
blade failure,

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.000
and we can no longer
continue with testing.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.880
For that reason, I have to ask
you to please leave the forge.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.960
Thank you, gentlemen.

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.580
I'm upset.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.670
The fire really broke down
what I was able to turn in.

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.710
But I didn't give up.

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:15.830
It was something that I was
raised with, with my dad.

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.920
It really sunk in with me
when I was in the military.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.750
Sometimes the best you can
do isn't going to be enough,

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.170
but that doesn't mean
you shouldn't still try.
