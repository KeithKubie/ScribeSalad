00:00:01.201 --> 00:00:05.438
Opposers, I have a shocking
confession: I can't do it all.

00:00:05.471 --> 00:00:07.573
So I always roll

00:00:07.606 --> 00:00:10.243
with my stranger
from another manger-- Jesus.

00:00:10.276 --> 00:00:11.978
(laughter)

00:00:12.011 --> 00:00:13.846
He follows me wherever I go.

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:15.848
That's why I order
two Bloomin' Onions

00:00:15.881 --> 00:00:17.650
when I'm eating alone
at Outback.

00:00:17.683 --> 00:00:19.118
-MAN: Yeah!
-(whooping, scattered applause)

00:00:19.151 --> 00:00:23.322
And like any bro who has my
back, Jesus picks up the tab.

00:00:23.355 --> 00:00:25.058
(laughter)

00:00:25.091 --> 00:00:27.894
I assume.
I bounce, and I don't look back.

00:00:27.927 --> 00:00:32.765
Now, I'm a man, and therefore,
an amazing driver.

00:00:32.798 --> 00:00:37.336
But sometimes the road of life
gets twisty and treacherous.

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:41.140
That's when I sit back
and let Jesus take the wheel.

00:00:41.173 --> 00:00:43.309
(angelic voices singing)

00:00:43.342 --> 00:00:45.278
(applause and cheering)

00:00:47.346 --> 00:00:49.015
Thanks, J.C.

00:00:49.048 --> 00:00:50.783
(laughter)

00:00:50.816 --> 00:00:53.753
Conservatives know that there
are many problems on this earth

00:00:53.786 --> 00:00:57.790
that man just cannot solve,
so we shouldn't try.

00:00:57.823 --> 00:00:59.559
Take teen pregnancy.

00:00:59.592 --> 00:01:02.829
Donald Trump believes
in abstinence-only sex ed.

00:01:02.862 --> 00:01:05.498
And Donald Trump is an expert
on abstinence.

00:01:05.531 --> 00:01:08.701
He always, always waits
until marriage,

00:01:08.734 --> 00:01:11.304
or until his lawyer wires them
130 grand.

00:01:11.337 --> 00:01:12.805
(laughter)

00:01:12.838 --> 00:01:14.907
So Trump pulled the plug
on Obama's

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.877
sinfully comprehensive
teen pregnancy program,

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.313
-which only reduced 
teen pregnancy. -(men booing)

00:01:20.346 --> 00:01:22.348
But Trump wants to eliminate it.

00:01:22.381 --> 00:01:24.383
It's how I live my life.

00:01:24.416 --> 00:01:26.519
When my doctor told me
to reduce my cholesterol,

00:01:26.552 --> 00:01:29.288
I did him one better
and got rid of it completely.

00:01:29.321 --> 00:01:31.023
(laughter)

00:01:31.056 --> 00:01:32.725
Unrelated--
my vision is blurred,

00:01:32.758 --> 00:01:34.627
and I smell burning toast
at all times.

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:35.895
(laughter)

00:01:35.928 --> 00:01:37.396
So when it comes to sex ed,

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:40.466
President Trump
is letting Jesus take the wheel.

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:42.268
WOMAN: The Trump administration
 published its new

00:01:42.301 --> 00:01:45.004
 pregnancy-prevention plan
 last week.

00:01:45.037 --> 00:01:47.340
What's being said now is
the "sexual risk avoidance,"

00:01:47.373 --> 00:01:50.610
which is just a different way
of saying "abstinence only."

00:01:50.643 --> 00:01:53.212
We believe that abstinence-only
education is harmful.

00:01:53.245 --> 00:01:54.881
Wrong, lady.

00:01:54.914 --> 00:01:56.816
You know...
you know what's harmful?

00:01:56.849 --> 00:01:58.451
A bunch of teens running around

00:01:58.484 --> 00:02:00.686
who know more about the vagina
than I do.

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.288
(laughter)

00:02:02.321 --> 00:02:04.957
It's humiliating!

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.226
To get funding
under Trump's new proposal,

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.362
schools are required
to use elements

00:02:09.395 --> 00:02:11.397
from programs like SMARTool,

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.267
a faith-friendly curriculum
that promotes abstinence

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.335
by making kids afraid of sex,

00:02:16.368 --> 00:02:19.605
a tactic they call
"fear arousal."

00:02:19.638 --> 00:02:21.641
(laughter, groaning)

00:02:21.674 --> 00:02:23.509
The idea is
to make teens horny--

00:02:23.542 --> 00:02:25.478
not for sex, but for fear.

00:02:25.511 --> 00:02:27.313
(laughter)

00:02:27.346 --> 00:02:30.116
It's a winning
GOP campaign strategy,

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:32.785
and also
why some jerk keeps (bleep)

00:02:32.818 --> 00:02:34.453
my jack-o'-lantern
every Halloween.

00:02:34.486 --> 00:02:36.622
(laughter)

00:02:36.655 --> 00:02:39.025
(applause)

00:02:39.058 --> 00:02:41.561
To be clear, I'm not saying

00:02:41.594 --> 00:02:43.863
it's wrong
to (bleep) jack-o'-lanterns.

00:02:43.896 --> 00:02:46.265
It's a safe alternative
to actual sex.

00:02:46.298 --> 00:02:48.267
I'm just saying, get your own.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.036
(laughter)

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.939
Thou shalt not covet thy
neighbor's jack-o'-lantern...

00:02:52.972 --> 00:02:54.774
Carl.

00:02:54.807 --> 00:02:56.242
(laughter)

00:02:56.275 --> 00:02:57.643
This is great.

00:02:57.676 --> 00:02:59.779
Contraception has no place
in schools.

00:02:59.812 --> 00:03:02.682
Teens can't see a condom
these days without

00:03:02.715 --> 00:03:05.618
snorting it up their nose.
Look at this.

00:03:05.651 --> 00:03:07.119
(men laughing)

00:03:07.152 --> 00:03:09.121
(laughter, groaning)

00:03:09.154 --> 00:03:11.858
-(audience groaning loudly)
-(men laughing)

00:03:13.092 --> 00:03:16.596
(groaning, laughter)

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:19.665
I am 95% sure

00:03:19.698 --> 00:03:22.068
that's not what you're supposed
to do with condoms.

00:03:22.101 --> 00:03:24.036
(laughter)

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:26.072
Bottom line: the only one

00:03:26.105 --> 00:03:28.474
who should be knocking up
teenage girls is God himself.

00:03:28.507 --> 00:03:31.811
-(some people groaning)
-So, to prevent teen...

00:03:31.844 --> 00:03:34.046
Jesus, guys. Do you ev...?

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:36.616
Mary Magdalene.
Look it up.

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:38.784
So to prevent teen pregnancy,

00:03:38.817 --> 00:03:41.988
forget the birds and the bees
and let Jesus take the wheel.

00:03:42.021 --> 00:03:44.523
-(horn honking)
-(applause and cheering)

00:03:44.556 --> 00:03:47.326
Yes.

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:49.695
Drive, Jesus, drive!

00:03:49.728 --> 00:03:52.498
Drive all the way to the swamp,
Washington, D.C.

00:03:52.531 --> 00:03:55.034
where Donald Trump is under
attack by Deep State forces,

00:03:55.067 --> 00:03:59.405
and Jeff Sessions
and Rod Rosenstein refuse

00:03:59.438 --> 00:04:01.841
to take a samurai blood oath
to protect their president.

00:04:01.874 --> 00:04:04.744
If no one on earth can defend
our president,

00:04:04.777 --> 00:04:07.079
we must call
on divine intervention

00:04:07.112 --> 00:04:09.181
to shield him with prayer.

00:04:09.214 --> 00:04:12.151
Let this fiery televangelist
lead the way.

00:04:12.184 --> 00:04:16.022
God was faithful November 9,
and he spoke to me.

00:04:16.055 --> 00:04:18.491
He showed me the vision
of a dome covering the president

00:04:18.524 --> 00:04:20.159
and the Executive Branch.

00:04:20.192 --> 00:04:22.061
This assignment would be ours--

00:04:22.094 --> 00:04:26.365
to be a strike force,
a spiritual strike force.

00:04:26.398 --> 00:04:27.500
The POTUS shield.

00:04:27.533 --> 00:04:30.636
Feel that charisma! Whoa!

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:33.172
I haven't been this moved
in church since I learned

00:04:33.205 --> 00:04:35.975
that we're allowed
to hurl stones at people.

00:04:36.008 --> 00:04:39.145
But what is this
POTUS shield, you ask?

00:04:39.178 --> 00:04:40.846
Well, who are you?
Robert Mueller?

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:43.482
It's... a prayer-powered
force field

00:04:43.515 --> 00:04:46.485
protecting Donald Trump
and his MAGA mission.

00:04:46.518 --> 00:04:48.688
It's got everything--
swords, lions,

00:04:48.721 --> 00:04:51.791
a lake of fire, for some reason.

00:04:51.824 --> 00:04:54.293 line:0%
And you and I can be part
of the POTUS shield

00:04:54.326 --> 00:04:59.031 line:0%
by purchasing a DVD set
for a $55 donation.

00:04:59.064 --> 00:05:00.399 line:0%
This is real.

00:05:00.432 --> 00:05:03.035
And like all donations,
it's a fixed price

00:05:03.068 --> 00:05:06.505
that you have to pay
if you want the product.

00:05:06.538 --> 00:05:09.508
And boy, do I want that product!
Here, take my money, Jesus.

00:05:09.541 --> 00:05:11.577
Whoo!

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.713
And my... take my prayers.

00:05:13.746 --> 00:05:16.282
And most important,
take the wheel.

00:05:16.315 --> 00:05:18.684 line:0%
(horn blowing)

00:05:18.717 --> 00:05:19.785
(applause, cheering)

00:05:19.818 --> 00:05:22.221
Yeah, Opposers, it...

00:05:22.254 --> 00:05:25.291
it is important
to put our faith in God,

00:05:25.324 --> 00:05:28.227
but sometimes God could use
some second-guessing.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:29.829
Enter Paul Ryan.

00:05:29.862 --> 00:05:31.630 line:0%
NEWSWOMAN: 
 House Democrats and even

00:05:31.663 --> 00:05:35.368 line:0%
some Republicans are angry
over the sudden firing

00:05:35.401 --> 00:05:38.037 line:0%
 of their longtime chaplain
 by Speaker Paul Ryan.

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:39.839 line:0%
NEWSMAN: Ryan's office
 complained last year

00:05:39.872 --> 00:05:42.842 line:0%
 that Conroy got too political
 during a tax cut debate.

00:05:42.875 --> 00:05:44.710 line:0%
NEWSWOMAN: Conroy prayed
 on the House floor,

00:05:44.743 --> 00:05:48.381 line:0%
 urging lawmakers to strive
 for economic equality.

00:05:48.414 --> 00:05:50.282
Yes, good for you, Paul.

00:05:50.315 --> 00:05:53.486
As Jesus said,
"Let thy skin be the thinnest."

00:05:53.519 --> 00:05:55.154
(laughter)

00:05:55.187 --> 00:05:58.157
Now, Ryan says the firing
wasn't politically motivated,

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.593
but that Father Conroy
just hadn't offered

00:06:00.626 --> 00:06:02.795
enough spiritual support
to lawmakers.

00:06:02.828 --> 00:06:04.163
It's a great point.

00:06:04.196 --> 00:06:06.532
Did that chaplain ever once pray

00:06:06.565 --> 00:06:08.934
for the return
of Paul Ryan's missing spine?

00:06:08.967 --> 00:06:11.003
-No.
-(laughter, groaning)

00:06:11.036 --> 00:06:13.639
-He did not. No.
-(applause, cheering)

00:06:13.672 --> 00:06:15.708
No.

00:06:15.741 --> 00:06:18.244
And meanwhile some people
are running around

00:06:18.277 --> 00:06:20.112
with too much spine.

00:06:20.145 --> 00:06:22.481
Like those pesky Parkland kids.

00:06:22.514 --> 00:06:24.850
Why aren't you praying
about that inequality?

00:06:24.883 --> 00:06:26.318
So, Paul Ryan,

00:06:26.351 --> 00:06:29.422
thank you for shit-canning
this man of the cloth,

00:06:29.455 --> 00:06:34.160
and for knowing when Jesus
 shouldn't take the wheel.

00:06:34.193 --> 00:06:35.761
You hear me, JC?

00:06:35.794 --> 00:06:38.531
You turned a few too many waters
into wine, bud.

00:06:38.564 --> 00:06:41.867
I hate to do this,
but, Jesus, give me the keys.

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:43.936
Come on.
Come on, give me the keys.

00:06:43.969 --> 00:06:45.538
Give me the keys, Jesus.

00:06:45.571 --> 00:06:47.940
-(heavenly choir sings)
-Yes. Yes.

00:06:47.973 --> 00:06:49.542
Uh...

00:06:49.575 --> 00:06:52.378
A Yaris? Really?

00:06:52.411 --> 00:06:53.411
Jesus.
