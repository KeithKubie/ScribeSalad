00:00:07.127 --> 00:00:10.915
How do we explain the unexplainable?

00:00:10.915 --> 00:00:13.712
This question has inspired numerous myths,

00:00:13.712 --> 00:00:15.382
religious practices,

00:00:15.382 --> 00:00:17.752
and scientific inquiries.

00:00:17.752 --> 00:00:22.578
But Zen Buddhists practicing throughout 
China from the 9th to 13th century

00:00:22.578 --> 00:00:24.394
asked a different question –

00:00:24.394 --> 00:00:27.265
why do we need an explanation?

00:00:27.265 --> 00:00:31.964
For these monks, blindly seeking answers 
was a vice to overcome,

00:00:31.964 --> 00:00:34.350
and learning to accept
the mysteries of existence

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.558
was the true path to enlightenment.

00:00:37.558 --> 00:00:41.029
But fighting the urge to explain 
the unexplainable can be difficult.

00:00:41.029 --> 00:00:44.166
So to help practice living 
with these mysteries,

00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:49.043
the meditating monks used a collection 
of roughly 1,700 bewildering

00:00:49.043 --> 00:00:53.210
and ambiguous philosophical
thought experiments called kōans.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:01:00.764
The name, originally gong-an in Chinese,
translates to “public record or case."

00:01:00.764 --> 00:01:05.942
But unlike real-world court cases,
kōans were intentionally incomprehensible.

00:01:05.942 --> 00:01:10.869
They were surprising, surreal, 
and frequently contradicted themselves.

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:15.711
On the surface, they contained a proverb
about the Zen Buddhist monastic code -

00:01:15.711 --> 00:01:19.405
such as living without physical
or mental attachments,

00:01:19.405 --> 00:01:21.127
avoiding binary thinking,

00:01:21.127 --> 00:01:25.079
and realizing one’s true “Buddha-nature."

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:27.815
But by framing those lessons 
as illogical anecdotes,

00:01:27.815 --> 00:01:33.955
they became tests to help practicing monks
learn to live with ambiguity and paradox.

00:01:33.955 --> 00:01:36.850
By puzzling through 
these confusing “cases,"

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.231
meditating monks could both internalize 
and practice Buddhist teachings.

00:01:41.231 --> 00:01:44.575
Hopefully, they would let go 
of the search for one true answer

00:01:44.575 --> 00:01:47.456
and trigger a spiritual breakthrough.

00:01:47.456 --> 00:01:50.189
Since these are intentionally 
unexplainable,

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.095
it would be misguided to try 
and decipher these stories ourselves.

00:01:54.095 --> 00:01:56.234
But like the monks before us,

00:01:56.234 --> 00:01:58.074
we can puzzle over them together,

00:01:58.074 --> 00:02:02.122
and investigate just how resistant
they are to simple explanations.

00:02:02.122 --> 00:02:07.070
Consider this kōan illustrating the
practice of no-attachment.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:12.798
Two monks, Tanzan and Ekido,
are traveling together down a muddy road.

00:02:12.798 --> 00:02:17.574
Ahead they see an attractive traveler,
unable to cross the muddy path.

00:02:17.574 --> 00:02:19.631
Tanzan politely offers his help,

00:02:19.631 --> 00:02:22.529
carrying the traveler 
on his back across the street,

00:02:22.529 --> 00:02:24.841
and placing her down without a word.

00:02:24.841 --> 00:02:26.777
Ekido was shocked.

00:02:26.777 --> 00:02:30.249
According to monastic law,
monks were not supposed to go near women,

00:02:30.249 --> 00:02:32.383
let alone touch a beautiful stranger.

00:02:32.383 --> 00:02:36.465
After miles of walking,
Ekido could no longer restrain himself.

00:02:36.465 --> 00:02:38.765
“How could you carry that woman?”

00:02:38.765 --> 00:02:44.640
Tanzan smiled, “I left the traveler there.
Are you still carrying her?”

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.436
Like all kōans, 
this story has numerous interpretations.

00:02:48.436 --> 00:02:50.772
But one popular reading suggests

00:02:50.772 --> 00:02:53.658
that despite never having 
physically carried the traveler,

00:02:53.658 --> 00:02:58.658
Ekido broke monastic law 
by mentally "clinging to" the woman.

00:02:58.658 --> 00:03:00.237
This type of conflict –

00:03:00.237 --> 00:03:04.278
examining the grey area between the letter
of the law and the spirit of the law –

00:03:04.278 --> 00:03:06.861
was common in kōans.

00:03:06.861 --> 00:03:08.994
In addition to exploring ambiguity,

00:03:08.994 --> 00:03:11.199
kōans often ridiculed characters

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:14.841
claiming total understanding 
of the world around them.

00:03:14.841 --> 00:03:17.442
One such example finds three monks

00:03:17.442 --> 00:03:20.505
debating a temple flag 
rippling in the wind.

00:03:20.505 --> 00:03:23.878
The first monk refers to 
the flag as a moving banner,

00:03:23.878 --> 00:03:27.345
while the second monk insists 
that they are not seeing the flag move,

00:03:27.345 --> 00:03:29.761
but rather the wind blowing.

00:03:29.761 --> 00:03:33.884
They argue back and forth, 
until finally, a third monk intervenes,

00:03:33.884 --> 00:03:37.676
“It is not the flag moving, 
nor the wind blowing,

00:03:37.676 --> 00:03:40.838
but rather the movement of your minds!”

00:03:40.838 --> 00:03:45.400
One interpretation of this kōan plays on 
the supposed wisdom of the arguing monks –

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.015
the first asserting the importance 
of the observable world,

00:03:49.015 --> 00:03:53.039
the second favoring deeper knowledge 
we can infer from that world.

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:55.960
But each monk’s commitment 
to his own “answer”

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.065
blinds him to the other’s insight, 
and in doing so,

00:03:59.065 --> 00:04:03.998
defies an essential Buddhist ideal:
abolishing binary thinking.

00:04:03.998 --> 00:04:08.201
The third monk identifies 
their conflict as a perceptual one –

00:04:08.201 --> 00:04:12.150
both arguing monks 
fail to see the larger picture.

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.535
Of course, all these interpretations only
hint at how to wrestle with these kōans.

00:04:17.535 --> 00:04:20.655
Neither the wisdom 
from practicing monks before us,

00:04:20.655 --> 00:04:23.940
nor the supposedly wise characters 
in these stories

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.567
can resolve them for you.

00:04:25.567 --> 00:04:29.752
That’s because the purpose of these kōans
isn’t reaching a simple solution.

00:04:29.752 --> 00:04:33.508
It’s the very act of struggling 
with these paradoxical puzzles

00:04:33.508 --> 00:04:36.245
which challenge our desire for resolution,

00:04:36.245 --> 00:04:39.942
and our understanding 
of understanding itself.
