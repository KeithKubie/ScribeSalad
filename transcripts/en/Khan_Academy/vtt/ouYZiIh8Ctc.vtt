00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:01.900
Welcome back.

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:05.920
Well I'm now going to do just a
bunch of integration by parts

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.110
problems, as many as I can do
in ten minutes without

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.750
confusing you.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.400
So let me just write the
formula for integration by

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.910
parts, and if you ever forget
it-- I mean, it doesn't hurt to

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:15.840
memorize it, but if you ever
forget it-- you just really

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.240
have to just derive it from the
product rule of

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.480
differentiation.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:27.080
But it just says that if we
have an integral of f of x

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:32.320
times g prime of x-- so if you
see, within the integral, sign,

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.590
one function and then you see
the derivative of another

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.640
function, and I think with
practice-- integration by parts

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.150
is really a bit of an art.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:45.480
It's not systematic-- that's g
prime of x-- that equals f of

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.650
access times g of x-- this is
how it's the product rule in

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:56.200
reverse-- minus the integral of
the derivative of the first

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:01.650
function, f prime of x,
times the second function.

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.570
And it kind of easy to
memorize, because there's this

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.605
symmetry to the formula.

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.490
So let's see if we
can apply this.

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.140
And really, once you know that
you should use integration by

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.140
parts, I think you'll find that
it's not that hard to do it.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.510
The hard part is to recognize
when you should use

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:18.890
integration by parts.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.940
From my point of view, it's
kind of my last resort, or once

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.650
you have a lot of practice, you
might recognize, well, if

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.250
there's an e to the x in it, or
if there's a trig function in

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.320
it, and I can't do the reverse
chain rule or integration by

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.370
substitution, then integration
by parts is probably my best

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.580
option, assuming I'm seeing
this on an exam and

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:40.070
not in real life.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.150
In real life, it might be an
unsolvable integral, and

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.800
you'd have to use a computer
or some other technique.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.550
But if you're seeing it on an
exam, you know it's a solvable

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.410
integral, and if you can't
solve it any other way, it's

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.830
probably integration by parts.

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.690
But let's just do
some problems.

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:59.600
Let's say I want to take the
integral of x squared e to dx.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.920
So if I saw this out of the
blue, and I didn't know that

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.660
this was a presentation on the
integration by parts, I would

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.440
first-- clearly this isn't a
polynomial, so I can't just do

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.440
a simple polynomial
antiderivative.

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.190
Then I would try to see, is
there the derivative of

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.310
something, of one function, of
kind of a composite function

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.310
here so I can do the
reverse chain rule.

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.450
The derivative of x here is 1,
so I can't do anything here.

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.290
So I use the chain rule.

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.700
And the way I think about
the chain rule is I

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.310
want to simplify it.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.040
So when I go into this term
right here, I'm going to

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.490
have to pick up my f of x.

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.300
I have to pick my f of x out
of probably one of these two

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.500
functions, so that the f
prime of x is simpler.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:53.700
And I need to pick my g prime
of x, I would guess that either

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.230
x squared is going to be my g
prime of x, or e to the x is

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.790
going to be my g prime of x,
and I want to pick that so that

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.855
when I take the antiderivative
of it, it's going

00:03:02.855 --> 00:03:03.530
to be simpler.

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.030
Or at least, not
more complicated.

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.570
I know that if I take the
derivative of x squared,

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:08.850
that simplifies it.

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.820
And I also know that the-- and
once again, this is one of my,

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.510
to me, a very mind blowing
idea-- but that the

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.740
antiderivative of e to
the x is e to the x.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:23.860
So it's probably a good idea to
say that f of x is equal to--

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.280
it's probably, let me change
colors-- it's probably a good

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.650
idea to make f of x is equal to
x squared, because later I'm

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.310
going to take the derivative of
it, and the derivative of it

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.850
simplifies it, and it's
probably a good idea to make g

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.830
prime of x e to the x, because
later, I'm going to take the

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:41.760
antiderivative of it, and the
antiderivative of e to

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:42.770
the x is e to the x.

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:45.240
It's not going to become
any more complicated.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:52.120
So if we assume what I'm doing
is right, then what did we say?

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.890
Well here, we just multiply the
two real functions, right?

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.550
So when I say the real
functions, I mean not

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.030
the derivatives of
e to one of them.

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.460
So f of x, we're saying
f of x is x squared.

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:07.290
Let me try to stay
color consistent.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.230
And we said g of x-- now don't
get confused-- we're saying g

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.790
prime of x-- let me write it in
a corner down here-- we're

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:22.360
saying that g prime of x
is equal to e to the x.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.050
And of course, if g prime of x
is equal to ex, then g of x

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.520
is also equal to e to the x.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.840
So g of x-- I don't want you
to think that I'm somehow

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.420
putting g prime of x here.

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.550
I've taken the antiderivative,
it just happens to be

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:37.705
the same function.

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:47.500
And then from that, we subtract
the integral, we take the

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:56.890
derivative of x squared, so you
get 2x, and then times the

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:59.980
antiderivative of g prime of x.

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.590
Well, the g prime of x is
e to the x, you take the

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:06.020
antiderivative, it's
still e to the x.

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.955
Actually I should probably stay
at least keep the colors kind

00:05:08.955 --> 00:05:11.870
of consistent, so you know
what I'm hopefully doing.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.540
The example using e to the x
might be a little complicated,

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.030
because it's hard to tell
whether I've taken the

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:19.130
derivative or not.

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.330
And you can kind of keep
reverting back to the top

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:22.405
formula if you get confused.

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:31.650
So it looks like I've
simplified it a little bit.

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:37.460
This integral looks easier to
solve than this integral.

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.760
But once again, when I look
at this, I'm like, well,

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:40.670
how do I solve this?

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:45.230
I can't use the integration by
substitution, because there's

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:48.300
not an embedded function and
then I have the derivative of

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.190
it sitting right
next to it, so.

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:52.900
Maybe I need to do
integration by parts again.

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.030
So let's do that.

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:59.260
So let's say-- let me do it
separately-- let's assume-- I

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.390
think you getting a little bit
of the hang of it-- along the

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:04.990
same vein, that this is f of x,
that this is f of x, and that

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:06.630
this is g prime of x now.

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:09.320
We're kind of doing
integration by parts within

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:10.730
integration by parts.

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:14.070
So if that is the case, that
this integral is going to

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:17.080
equal-- because we have the
minus sign out front, this

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:21.500
minus sign out front-- this
integral is going to equal f

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.540
of x times g of x where
f of x is just 2x.

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:30.530
Our g of x, this is
g prime of x now.

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:32.710
Remember, we're kind of doing
a new problem within the

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:34.560
original big problem.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:38.540
So this is g prime of x, but
g of x is still just e of x.

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.550
I took the
antiderivative of it.

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:47.810
And that's minus the integral
of the derivative of

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:50.050
the first function.

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:51.830
That prime of x.

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:53.530
So that's just 2.

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:57.680
And then the antiderivative
of the second function.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:58.290
Well, that's easy.

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:00.010
The antiderivative of e to
the x is just e to the x.

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:04.310
Interesting.

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:05.890
Now I think you see
where we're going.

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:08.850
This is actually-- let me
write out the whole thing.

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:11.870
Because this is-- x
squared, e to the x.

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:14.680
Just so we don't lose track
of our original problem.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:15.310
Interesting.

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:18.510
Now I think we have an
integral that is pretty

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:20.400
straightforward to solve.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.430
Don't want to forget my dx's.

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:25.840
What's the integral of-- we
could take this 2 out of

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.880
this, and I think it becomes
pretty obvious-- what's the

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:29.120
integral of e to the x?

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.880
This is a scratch-out,
this says dex.

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.830
Just so-- and it's
a little messy.

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:34.980
I don't like this color.

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:36.230
Magenta.

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:38.640
Well the integral of e to the
x, or the antiderivative of e

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:40.970
to the x is e to the x, right?

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:41.780
So let's write that.

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:43.940
So I'm going to rewrite
everything we've done it.

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:58.260
So there's x squared e to the x
minus 2xe to the x, and then

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.150
this minus, you distribute it
so it becomes a plus, so then

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:05.940
it's plus 2-- I just took the
minus, I multiplied it times

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:08.780
this minus, so I got a plus 2--
and then the antiderivative of

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:12.210
e to the x is just e to the x.

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:17.140
And then of course, we should
never forget the plus c.

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:18.560
Pretty fancy, no?

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:24.130
We've figured out the
antiderivative, the indefinite

00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:27.550
integral of x squared e to the
x is this big fancy thing.

00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:29.520
I bet you, before listening to
this video, you would never

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:34.260
imagine that you could tackle
integration like this.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.970
You could actually try x to
the n times e to the x.

00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:38.580
You can try x to the
tenth times e to the x.

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:41.480
It actually turns out you'll
just have to do this many many

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:44.550
many many times, but every time
you do integration by parts,

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:48.670
that the exponent on the x-term
just becomes smaller and

00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:51.490
smaller and smaller until you
get to something that's really

00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:53.640
easy to integrate, and then you
can do it, and you'll have kind

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.430
of this big long expression.

00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:58.550
It might be tedious, it might
be hairy, but at least you have

00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:00.840
a tool kit-- or you have
something in your tool kit--

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:05.180
that you can tackle integral
problems like this.

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:07.850
I'll probably do one more video
on integration by parts, just

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:11.620
because I think this is one of
the harder concepts to really

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:14.930
grasp and feel comfortable
with, and then I'll try to

00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:16.590
do a bunch of examples.

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:19.560
Maybe not soon, but in the
next couple of weeks, on

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:20.670
just a lot of integration.

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:23.210
And I'm going to mix it up so
that hopefully you can get a

00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:27.680
sense of how I try to figure
out which of my integration

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:29.650
tools I should use for a
certain problem when

00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:30.870
I see the problem.
