00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:15.230
&gt;&gt;Female presenter: Welcome. I'm delighted
to be here with Alice Walker. I've spent the

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:22.940
last couple of hours with her already and
I promise you, this will be a delightful session.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.620
Pulitzer Prize winning author, poet, activist.
She grew up in Eatonton, Georgia, where, during

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:31.090
a time of great struggle for the black community
and lots of racism. So, I think it is no secret

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:35.100
that a lot of her inspiration has come from
that time in the world around her. We've been

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.420
talking about how she spent two years at Spellman
College, where she became very active in the

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:42.470
Civil Rights Movement and had the pleasure
and the fortune to meet Dr. Martin Luther

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:53.380
King, Jr. and hear the "I Have a Dream" speech
in person. Ms. Walker went later to Sarah

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.770
Lawrence, where she graduated and really honed
her writing skills, and more importantly,

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:03.410
it was at this time or during this time where
a lot of her writing became not just about

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:09.101
the world around her, but also about her personal
experiences. We're just delighted to have

00:01:09.101 --> 00:01:12.299
her here today and those of you who got here
early enough, got a copy of her new book,

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:18.690
"Hard Times Require Furious Dancing," which
really, I think, is a catalog, I think, the

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.880
way they described it of her life, her challenges
and some of her struggles. And we're just

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.860
delighted to have her here to talk about some
of that, her book and her influences around

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:29.860
her. So, welcome.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:30.860
&gt;&gt;Walker: Thank you.

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.189
[applause]

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:46.439
&gt;&gt;presenter: I have two housekeeping items.
First is technology related and that is cell

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.520
phones on silent or vibrate, please, and laptops
down. Anyone who works in my group also knows

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.430
when I have meetings, laptops are also down,
so it shouldn't be unfamiliar to you. Second

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.159
is also technology related. For those who
are on VC, video conference, you can submit

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:02.110
questions on the Dory page, which is up here,
goto Alice Walker, and then we have Belinda

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:10.190
here, in the audience, who will help go ahead
and ask some of those questions for you. For

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.540
those who are here in the room, in Tunis,
you can obviously queue up here in line where

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.849
the mic is when we get to go to Q&amp;A. So, I
know there's lots of burning questions in

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:22.989
the room, but I have some of my own--

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:23.989
&gt;&gt;Walker: Good.

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:27.069
&gt;&gt;presenter: so I'm gonna start there. And
then we can move to the questions from the

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:34.019
group. So, Ms. Walker, you have your own blog
through Blogger. You also have your own YouTube

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:39.370
channel, Alice Walker Videos, so thank you
for being an avid Google user. We all thank

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:40.370
you for that.

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:41.469
[Walker laughs]

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:42.469
[clapping]

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:47.819
But, you've used that medium in a really powerful
way and I've heard you refer to it as "the

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:52.889
people's medium." So, can you talk a little
bit about how you've seen new media, or the

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:54.999
Internet, really change the way people can
use writing as a literary tool?

00:02:54.999 --> 00:02:57.989
&gt;&gt;Walker: Well, I started, first of all, I'm
really happy to see you and it's really amazing

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:06.739
to be here. I work on a computer all the time.
I use Google all the time and I never think

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:07.739
of where it comes from.

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:08.739
[audience laughter]

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:18.890
So it's lovely to see all of your faces. I
started on a website on the day that Barack

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:31.579
Obama won the election and I'm not sure exactly
why I did it that way, but in case, I did

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:40.059
and so part of the reason was that I wasn't
permitted to use some of my poetry, my previously

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:48.319
published poetry, on the Internet. And I was
so annoyed that I decided to write new poetry

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:54.729
and to put it on the Internet first because
I wanted to go directly to people. You know

00:03:54.729 --> 00:04:00.540
when you publish a book; it takes a whole
year, usually, for it to see the light of

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:07.229
day. You write it, you send it in, they keep
it and they do various things with it and

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:12.339
there's a whole program, but it takes a year
for it to come out. And by the end of the

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:14.379
year, you've forgotten why you wrote it,

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:15.379
[chuckles]

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:22.780
where you were, who you were, everything.
And so, a lot of the joy is lost and it just

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:30.370
seemed to me to be a wonderful thing, a great
idea, to publish directly on the Internet

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:36.419
so that people could see the poems. Because,
I don't know poets there are in the room,

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:43.159
apparently a lot, but when you write a poem,
the feeling is of instant of wanting to share

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:50.389
it because you, automatically I think, think
of poetry as medicine. And this is the medicine

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:55.659
that comes to you in that moment and you just
want somebody else to have it. So, in that

00:04:55.659 --> 00:05:03.110
sense, the Internet is really wonderful and
I haven't missed the old way, although, as

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:08.680
I was mentioning earlier, what has happened
is that as soon as I put my work on the Internet,

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.889
then there appear these publishers who wanted
to publish it anyway.

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:12.889
&gt;&gt;presenter: Hmm.

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:18.310
&gt;&gt;Walker: So, it hasn't been a difficulty
of any sort. It's just been a pleasure.

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.570
&gt;&gt;presenter: It's helped. That's great.

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:21.570
&gt;&gt;Walker: Mmm-hmm.

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:28.099
&gt;&gt;presenter: Last year, you went to Gaza for
International Women's Day and you later wrote

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:31.550
"Overcoming Speechlessness," which was a book
not just about your time over there, but in

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:34.909
other places you've been around the world.
And in this book, you drew a lot of analogies

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:36.510
between slavery and the Civil Rights Movement
and what's happening today. Can you talk a

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:47.199
little bit about some of those analogies and
tell us a little more, what have we learned?

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:50.960
What haven't we learned as a society?

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:56.139
&gt;&gt;Walker: Well, the thing that struck me going
into Gaza, first of all, crossing through

00:05:56.139 --> 00:06:05.050
the Rafah Gate in Egypt was interesting because
the Israelis were still bombing along the

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:12.099
border and it gave me a moment to really consider
my life. And I think that this is one of the

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:22.120
reasons we go to scary places. They help us
hone in on how we're living. So, when I got

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:30.580
into, going into Gaza on the bus, what struck
me was how much it reminded me of going into

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:38.740
segregated Georgia. So, it was actually like
going into my past and just being in that

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:45.009
situation where the, it was basically apartheid
where there's an apartheid system and the

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:51.110
Gazan's don't have rights; they can't even
leave their, that little strip. It was so

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:57.880
much like going back into the past and it
not only, our past in Georgia, Mississippi,

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:06.879
Alabama, Louisiana and Texas, but the past
of South Africa. And it just, it had a double

00:07:06.879 --> 00:07:15.930
effect. Part of it was great horror and distress,
but it also felt comforting because I understood

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:22.180
that. Because I had grown up in an apartheid
system that people in those horrible situations

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:30.990
can also pull together and they can actually
be quite strong and they can develop some

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:38.710
layers of feeling that many people miss. And
for instance, we went to visit the women because

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:43.639
it was International Women's Day and we're
sitting in a little, little library room that

00:07:43.639 --> 00:07:50.569
they had there, that hadn't been bombed, and
they were telling me about the children and

00:07:50.569 --> 00:07:56.879
parents and uncles and everybody that they
had lost. And there was just such grief. And

00:07:56.879 --> 00:08:01.020
one woman, she was mourning the death of her
daughter and she was holding a picture of

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:08.300
her daughter and she couldn't speak. She just
got close to my chair and I put my hand on

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:13.419
her arm. So, as we were telling these, I was
listening to these stories and feeling this

00:08:13.419 --> 00:08:21.900
grief, at some point it just got so intense
that we realized, almost like in a body, that

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:29.599
there wasn't much we could do to help each
other. And somebody said, one of the women

00:08:29.599 --> 00:08:36.690
said, "Let's go next door." And we put on
some music and we just started to dance and

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:50.209
we danced through tears and wailing and grief
and incredible loss and that was our response

00:08:50.209 --> 00:08:56.540
to somehow be together to express all of that
that was really so awful, but in a way that

00:08:56.540 --> 00:09:01.190
was not violent and a way that was revivifying
of the spirit.

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:07.519
&gt;&gt;presenter: That's very powerful. One of
the, when I watched you interview on Democracy

00:09:07.519 --> 00:09:14.480
Now, you talked about the way to bring awareness
is really about just coming and going to see

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:19.540
for yourself. And that's possible for some
people, but not possible for everyone. So,

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:24.690
what are some of the other ways that you're
doing now just to bring awareness to some

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:28.230
of the global issues around human rights that
you care personally about?

00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:33.750
&gt;&gt;Walker: Well, first of all, I think that
all travel is not physical. I feel that I

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:42.360
have spent many a day in the 18th century,
and many a week in the 12th century. I mean,

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:49.530
you can, I have a niece who was telling me
that she couldn't imagine what we had been

00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:56.220
through and I was struck by that because,
to me, imagination is what takes us into all

00:09:56.220 --> 00:10:03.589
the places that we can't otherwise visit.
So, I think that, when I was 13 years old,

00:10:03.589 --> 00:10:09.570
my favorite book was Jane Eyre. And I read
Jane Eyre for, every year for I don't know

00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:15.360
how long. I love it. I love Charlotte Bronte.
I love all, I love Thomas Hardy, and all those

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:22.621
writers who basically take your imagination
and you and you go there where they lead you

00:10:22.621 --> 00:10:29.250
and you experience what is happening to the
people. And then, on the basis of what you

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:35.399
learn about what is happening to the people,
you act where you are. So, that's my understanding

00:10:35.399 --> 00:10:40.190
of how there's no excuse ever for not some
kind of-

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:41.190
[clears throat]

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:46.829
some kind of movement because you can always
visit people. I think, even before I went

00:10:46.829 --> 00:10:54.170
to Gaza, I mean, it's true; I like to personally
go and be there embodied as somebody that

00:10:54.170 --> 00:11:02.750
the people can hug and I can hug them and
we can share a meal or try to find food-

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:03.750
[clears throat]

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:13.600
because sometimes there isn't any. But I also,
when I cannot do that, I try to keep an awareness

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:23.100
by reading, or by the Internet or by some
way because it's important for people not

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:32.079
to feel alone. The junta in Burma, Myanmar,
their program is to keep us from having contact

00:11:32.079 --> 00:11:39.610
with Aung San Suu Kyi, so that when you're
in Burma, even to say her name is punishable

00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:48.389
for the local people. But, as people who care
about democracy and who care about injustice,

00:11:48.389 --> 00:11:54.300
we visit, we mentally we visit and we stand
with her. And there are all kinds of ways

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:57.480
of letting that be known and letting her feel
that actually, even if they don't let her

00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:05.360
get her mail, and even if she can't have a
laptop. And that, it seems to me, is our duty

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:15.310
as human beings; not to let any other human
being that we know of suffer in silence behind

00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:26.399
walls and darkness, like the man who just
won the Nobel Prize in China. I think that's

00:12:26.399 --> 00:12:31.480
so wonderful, Liu Xiaobo is his, I don't,
maybe that's not the right pronunciation,

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:41.500
but you know who I mean. It's so wonderful
that he is acknowledged by other people outside

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:48.720
of China, who may never, like me, ever get
the pronunciation entirely right--

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:49.959
[presenter laughs]

00:12:49.959 --> 00:12:57.420
but in some sense it doesn't matter because
what matters is that he know that he is not

00:12:57.420 --> 00:13:03.500
alone as he tries to address the inequities
of China, as we do here, in this country.

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:04.671
&gt;&gt;presenter: I think that's really powerful,
particularly around acting where you are and

00:13:04.671 --> 00:13:08.240
reading and finding out things about how to
be inspired. What are some of your sources

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:19.630
of inspirations? I think I read somewhere
that Zora Neale Hurston was your literary

00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:24.160
foremother. How would you describe that?

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:33.500
&gt;&gt;Walker: Well, she's a literary foremother
of all of us and it was unbearable, really,

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:40.070
that she had given all of this beautiful work
to the world and nobody knew where she was

00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:45.399
buried and nobody cared. And who are we if
we're like that? I just, I just am appalled.

00:13:45.399 --> 00:13:51.070
I think that, it's interesting though, because
she actually was the kind of person who didn't

00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:58.420
care where she was buried; she was really
that free. But aside from what she was like,

00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:07.290
there is what we are like and what it means
to receive a gift and to say nothing; to have

00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:16.560
no thank you for the person, no awareness
of how they lived or died. But my greatest

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:23.089
wisdom teacher was my mother and this was
because she was someone who was deeply rooted

00:14:23.089 --> 00:14:33.519
in nature. She was, like most African Americans,
very indoctrinated into Christianity and was

00:14:33.519 --> 00:14:39.200
the mother of the church. So, she had a very
strong role in keeping our church going, but

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:45.879
beyond that, she had a very strong Pagan streak,
which she inherited from her Cherokee ancestors

00:14:45.879 --> 00:14:53.639
and her African ancestors, and probably even
her Irish and Scottish ancestors. So, she

00:14:53.639 --> 00:14:59.160
was this woman who just radiated this faith
in the natural world and I loved that. And

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:11.060
in a way it has made me someone who cares
deeply about the Earth and who has written

00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:17.820
more about the Earth, actually I think, than
about probably anything else.

00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:18.820
&gt;&gt;presenter: Mm-hmm.

00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:22.519
&gt;&gt;Walker: I think people get distracted when
you write fiction because they're so focused

00:15:22.519 --> 00:15:25.339
on the humans and their story, but there's
always this story of nature and what the Earth

00:15:25.339 --> 00:15:26.339
is saying and what the Earth is doing. So.

00:15:26.339 --> 00:15:39.480
&gt;&gt;presenter: So, I wanna invite the audience
to come up and start to ask some questions.

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:45.459
As you queue up, just, there's a mic here
in the middle. Why don't we start with the

00:15:45.459 --> 00:15:58.430
first, maybe Dory question so that the people
watching on video conference can get the benefit

00:15:58.430 --> 00:15:59.430
of the first question and then maybe people
can line up behind Belinda.

00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:02.649
&gt;&gt;Belinda: The first question, Ms. Walker,
from the Dory page is, "Alice, with a long

00:16:02.649 --> 00:16:09.740
history of involvement with struggles for
liberation in the US, you have unique perspective

00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:14.770
on our current moment. What is your frank
assessment of the Obama Administration and

00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:18.649
the current political climate in the United
States?"

00:16:18.649 --> 00:16:24.480
&gt;&gt;Walker: I think that Barack Obama is the
best that we could do now in terms of leadership,

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:31.779
but I think he is completely hobbled, maybe
not completely hobbled, but quite hobbled

00:16:31.779 --> 00:16:38.220
by our recalcitrant Republican opposition.
And also, on the Democratic side, not nearly

00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:44.439
enough boldness and courage and just standing
for what you believe in and not worrying so

00:16:44.439 --> 00:16:48.029
much about your job. I think--

00:16:48.029 --> 00:16:49.209
[applause]

00:16:49.209 --> 00:16:56.140
Thank you. I think, I think the planet is
in for such a, well actually, the planet will

00:16:56.140 --> 00:17:04.030
be fine because she will just sail along forever,
but we, as humans, are in the direst situation

00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:10.430
humans have ever been in. We, we're losing
the planet. We're losing a place and we may

00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:15.600
well become extinct and actually, would not
be a bad thing seen from the perspective of

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:21.510
the planet. And I, more and more, see life
from that perspective because I think we have

00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:30.440
not acted in a way that shows we love the
Earth or that we deserve it. So, and also,

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:37.590
I know we care about our country, but in a
sense, the whole idea of separate countries

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:44.070
is obsolete and we should really only be thinking
constantly of the whole thing so that if you

00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:50.490
have a huge flood somewhere, say in for instance,
Pakistan, you don't just shut it out of your

00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:55.090
mind because it's way over there. Because
it's not way over there, it's in your house.

00:17:55.090 --> 00:18:00.860
This is a, this is a collective house and
we should be thinking more and more like that.

00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:07.470
And whatever gets in the way of the survival
of the planet, itself, we have to get rid

00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:17.420
of it. It's our lives and I know we're not
used to thinking so much in this fashion,

00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:24.520
but it will come to that because people will
see that in order for us to survive, we have

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:31.920
to change almost everything. We, we're losing
our top soil, we're losing our water and in

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:41.170
the cities the air is pretty much gone. So,
it calls for some very different responses

00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:48.770
and this is going to mean a lot of rebalancing
within each of us. Those of us who are deeply

00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:56.590
nonviolent, for instance, how is it, how,
what is our way in getting through this period?

00:18:56.590 --> 00:19:05.010
Will we be able to actually save not just
our country, but the whole, the whole system,

00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:11.450
the whole world system? And by that, I don't
mean political system, I mean rivers and oceans

00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:14.770
and forests.

00:19:14.770 --> 00:19:16.420
[pause]

00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:19.730
[small laughter]

00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:29.660
&gt;&gt;Belinda: Does anyone have a question?

00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:38.630
&gt;&gt;Female member #1: I saw you speak in Oakland
last year, and after you returned from Gaza

00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:45.290
and you inspired me to go to Gaza later that
year, so thank you for that. But that day

00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:49.890
the moderator mentioned something you had
said about being taught, about the importance

00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:55.110
of keeping records, and if you keep records
then no one can ever tell you that something

00:19:55.110 --> 00:20:00.771
didn't happen. So, are the tools that we have
now, like Blogger and the Internet, keeping

00:20:00.771 --> 00:20:08.180
enough records about things like Burma, like
Palestine? Can we do more? What, what do you

00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:12.700
feel like that's still an issue today-- the
issue of keeping records?

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:20.660
&gt;&gt;Walker: I feel the biggest danger is too
much information. TMJ, or is it TM--

00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:21.660
&gt;&gt;presenter: TMI

00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:22.660
&gt;&gt;Walker: TMI.

00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:23.660
[presenter laughs]

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:24.660
[laughter]

00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:31.080
Well, TMJ would be "too much junk." But yeah,
I think, I think that there is so much information

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:38.250
that people don't know which records are worth
keeping, or where to keep them or how to keep

00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:45.600
them. And that's a real problem. I don't think,
I don't, I think the mind was not meant to

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:54.090
have so much stuff stuffed into it so that
you just, it's like you're always ingesting,

00:20:54.090 --> 00:20:59.530
but nothing is ever leaving and that's not
exactly healthy and it's not really saving

00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:05.920
anything because you don't, often you don't
even know what you're saving. And, in, on

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:13.220
a personal level, I'm concerned about how
I will continue to save my own records because

00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:23.060
until a couple of years ago, maybe three or
four years ago, I saved everything on paper

00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:29.760
and then I gave all of that to Emory University
in Atlanta and so now it's in an archive.

00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:33.530
And it's there and I like that. I like to
go there and I actually see these old notebooks

00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:43.130
that I wrote in for decades; they're there.
But when I look at my computer, I have saved

00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:49.460
emails, saved files and I'm not sure how you
save those things ultimately. I mean, the

00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:52.280
computer itself seems to be about to crash--

00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:54.400
[laughter]

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:58.811
and when it crashes, what happens to all of
that? What do I do with that? Do I send it

00:21:58.811 --> 00:22:08.380
somewhere? Do I try to copy it? And I'm also
wondering whether, this is something I've

00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:15.571
noticed from television watchers, which may
creep in to laptop users and I'm, of course,

00:22:15.571 --> 00:22:24.880
one of those. But actually seeing something
or experiencing something on a screen is really

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:32.870
not the same thing as actually getting it.
It's more like just looking at something and

00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:40.040
the information it just clicks in there. But
what changes us is the more visceral, the

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:48.700
more visceral connection to reality. And that
is what keeps us human, is the actual ability

00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:56.660
to feel. In the film that I mentioned earlier,
that I was watching last night, The Most Dangerous

00:22:56.660 --> 00:23:02.920
Man in America about Daniel Ellsberg. Part
of what's so chilling is that Nixon and Kissinger

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:12.980
and all these people showed no feeling. They
had no feeling. Nixon was saying to Kissinger

00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:20.250
about Vietnam, "Well, I think we should just
nuke it." And Kissinger says, "Well, no, you

00:23:20.250 --> 00:23:25.860
don't wanna do that because then the world
would think of you as a butcher." But not

00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:33.930
about the people that you're nuking. So, the,
it seems to me the real struggle right now

00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:44.320
is to retain the humanity that develops out
of real passion, out of real solidarity, out

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:53.100
of real love. I've been to places where I've
seen the people up against such a lot and

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:58.640
they're still clinging to being human beings.
They're still clinging to being people who

00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:05.540
share, people who care, people who can dance,
people who will give you a recipe for something.

00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:13.050
This is this is the crux because otherwise,
you run the risk of just having more and more

00:24:13.050 --> 00:24:17.320
people who have no feeling whatsoever. And
the, there's a study by Martha Stout, who

00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:25.820
went to Harvard. I don't think she's there,
but she's a psychologist and she has written

00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:32.671
this wonderful book called The Sociopath Next
Door. And it talks about how 4 % of people

00:24:32.671 --> 00:24:39.160
are actually sociopathic; they're born without
a conscious. Now, this is really something

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:47.010
to think about because we tend to think that
everybody has Buddha nature, however your

00:24:47.010 --> 00:24:54.410
Buddha nature is, like Christ consciousness,
a love in your heart somewhere, but that's

00:24:54.410 --> 00:24:58.920
not necessarily true. And then if that's not
necessarily true then what do you do with

00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:06.470
that 4%? And then, do you start to augment
it by all the other people who are just resisting

00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:18.720
any kind of feeling? So, it's really crucial
that the record-keeping that happens has passion,

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:23.670
it has integrity, it has roots, it has real
meaning. Its record keeping that you can also

00:25:23.670 --> 00:25:32.120
start another world with because we're losing
this one. We need to have, we will have to

00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:35.360
start a new one and so for that you really
do need all those things; courage, passion,

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:38.150
a lot of love.

00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:44.640
&gt;&gt;presenter: I think you had a question.

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:50.720
&gt;&gt;Male member #2: Hi. Thank you for coming
here. I was wondering if you could pick a

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:54.970
poem in your book and maybe walk us through
it and talk to us about the inspiration behind

00:25:54.970 --> 00:25:55.970
it.

00:25:55.970 --> 00:25:56.970
&gt;&gt;Walker: Oh, dear.

00:25:56.970 --> 00:25:57.970
[laughter]

00:25:57.970 --> 00:25:58.970
&gt;&gt;presenter: You knew that was--

00:25:58.970 --> 00:26:01.850
&gt;&gt;member #2: I could bring the book up if
you want.

00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:09.180
&gt;&gt;Walker: Well, why don't you pick a poem
and tell me what page it's on and I'll see

00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:10.180
what I can do.

00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:11.180
&gt;&gt;member #2: Ok.

00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:14.350
&gt;&gt;Walker: It's interesting, I find, I've been
writing now for decades and people who have

00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:20.020
just read something, not not this book, cause
I did just finish this, but people who've

00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:25.150
just read something will say, "Oh, well what
about Josie who went off and did something

00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:30.290
with Samuel and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,"
and I'll think, "Who?"

00:26:30.290 --> 00:26:31.510
[laughter]

00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:33.370
But, ok, where are you?

00:26:33.370 --> 00:26:36.810
&gt;&gt;member #2: Ok, I just opened it randomly.
Page 56, there's a poem called Love is That

00:26:36.810 --> 00:26:37.810
Giant Bag.

00:26:37.810 --> 00:26:41.850
&gt;&gt;Walker: Oh, yeah. Ok. All right. Well, this
one actually.

00:26:41.850 --> 00:26:46.730
[reads]
"Love is that giant bag of everything

00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:54.440
Into which we might disappear
Without a trace and still be found again.

00:26:54.440 --> 00:27:04.000
Even the parent you thought was lost
Father, gone to Spirit, before you reach my

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:10.440
age.
I am your dream of me and more

00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:15.140
And I will carry us, plucked
From love's abyss."

00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:24.370
Ok. The thing about love is that it really
is indestructible, but you can think that

00:27:24.370 --> 00:27:33.320
it's gone and so I'm saying, "Love is that
giant bag of everything into which we might

00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:40.120
disappear without a trace and be found again.
Even the parent you thought was lost." And

00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:45.970
where this connects with my life, is that
my father and I battled constantly when I

00:27:45.970 --> 00:27:53.750
was growing up. Because, even though he understood
racism and fought against it his whole life,

00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:59.490
he didn't have a clue about sexism, which
was so annoying.

00:27:59.490 --> 00:28:00.490
[laughter]

00:28:00.490 --> 00:28:11.220
I cannot tell you. So, we battled constantly
and deeply and it really harmed our relationship.

00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:20.760
And yet, now I think of him with such tenderness,
such love and such emotion and so, in a sense,

00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:33.170
it went into this big bag, lost for a long
time, but found again.

00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:39.340
"And so I will carry us, plucked from love's
abyss."

00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:45.520
Yes? Now, how about this one, though.

00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:46.520
[presenter laughs]

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:47.520
[Walker laughs]

00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:49.010
&gt;&gt;presenter: Keep going!

00:28:49.010 --> 00:28:57.090
&gt;&gt;Walker: Now, this is about hatred. This
is about hatred and, hatred is something you

00:28:57.090 --> 00:29:02.910
really have to work with because it is so
poisonous to you. It's not the other person.

00:29:02.910 --> 00:29:08.530
One of the things you learn as you get older
and you have more experiences with hatred

00:29:08.530 --> 00:29:15.250
and stuff, is that while you are suffering
with it and really, any kind of hatred is

00:29:15.250 --> 00:29:22.850
suffering, you may notice that the person
you're hating is just having the best time.

00:29:22.850 --> 00:29:23.850
[laughter]

00:29:23.850 --> 00:29:28.330
They are just having a wonderful time. They
are happy. So, so, that's to teach you something

00:29:28.330 --> 00:29:35.060
really important, which is that hatred is
totally not necessary. You must learn to get

00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:40.490
rid of it because it basically hurts you.
So, this is called "Watching You Hold Your

00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:41.490
Hatred."

00:29:41.490 --> 00:29:43.630
[reads]
"Watching you hold your hatred for such a

00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:49.300
long time
I wonder, isn't it slippery?

00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:58.940
Might you not someday drop it on yourself?
I wonder, where does it sleep, if ever?

00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:03.350
And where do you deposit it
While you feed your children

00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:08.870
Or sit in the lap of the one who cherishes
you?

00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:13.600
There is no graceful way
To carry hatred.

00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:20.680
While hidden, it is everywhere."

00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:22.370
[pause]

00:30:22.370 --> 00:30:29.130
&gt;&gt;female member #3: Hi.

00:30:29.130 --> 00:30:32.510
&gt;&gt;Walker: Hi.

00:30:32.510 --> 00:30:37.130
&gt;&gt;member #3: Thank you very much for coming.

00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:38.130
&gt;&gt;Walker: Mm-hmm.

00:30:38.130 --> 00:30:39.130
&gt;&gt;member #3: You mentioned before that instead
of spending that year publishing your book,

00:30:39.130 --> 00:30:42.670
you can just publish it right online and have
people read it right away. And it made me

00:30:42.670 --> 00:30:47.660
think about how many times we tweet or we
post something on Facebook, and we have this

00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:52.100
direct response. And I was just wondering
how you think that that changes us as creators

00:30:52.100 --> 00:31:00.070
of art and also just as humans who are becoming
digital narcissists who constantly need this

00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:01.070
feedback?

00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:03.270
&gt;&gt;Walker: I don't accept feedback.

00:31:03.270 --> 00:31:04.530
&gt;&gt;member #3: Ok.

00:31:04.530 --> 00:31:05.530
[laughter]

00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:06.530
&gt;&gt;presenter: Very good.

00:31:06.530 --> 00:31:10.310
&gt;&gt;Walker: I, I don't see that it's, it's necessary,
really.

00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:11.830
&gt;&gt;member #3: That works.

00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:12.830
[laughter]

00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:20.660
And I tell you, it's part of it, I write on
the Internet the same way I wrote when I was

00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:25.060
not writing on the Internet. When you write
a book of poetry, you don't get feedback.

00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:30.170
You just write the book and send it to your
agent and your agent sends it to the publisher.

00:31:30.170 --> 00:31:34.390
You don't get any feedback for a year. And
I think that works for me.

00:31:34.390 --> 00:31:35.420
[laughter]

00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:46.960
But you know something, excuse me. I am curious
about how people deal with that because I

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:47.970
don't think it's good for you.

00:31:47.970 --> 00:31:50.910
&gt;&gt;member #3: That's sort of my idea [inaudible

00:31:50.910 --> 00:31:51.910
&gt;&gt;Walker: It's not.

00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:52.910
&gt;&gt;member #3: [inaudible]

00:31:52.910 --> 00:31:54.170
&gt;&gt;Walker: No, no, no, no.

00:31:54.170 --> 00:31:55.170
&gt;&gt;member #3: [inaudible]

00:31:55.170 --> 00:31:59.580
&gt;&gt;Walker: Exactly. So, let me, let me affirm
what you're feeling.

00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:00.580
[laughter]

00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:06.140
And, and really to tell all of you who are
writing, whatever you're writing, and you

00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:10.090
have that little thing. They have that little
thing where you can get comments, just shut

00:32:10.090 --> 00:32:11.840
that off--

00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:12.840
[laughter]

00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:20.090
because, because you, you are on a journey
and you're trying to grow and six months later,

00:32:20.090 --> 00:32:25.310
you can turn the thing on and see what they
thought, but you don't need to know the minute

00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:31.510
you have finished something because you're
not finished with it. You're actually still,

00:32:31.510 --> 00:32:36.930
you notice how many times you go back sometimes
to change something, or correct something

00:32:36.930 --> 00:32:45.070
and editing something? So, trust more that
you will get it right just the way it needs

00:32:45.070 --> 00:32:52.200
to be without the outside commentary. And
wait. Learn to really wait, like six months

00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:59.740
is not that long, or even three months, but
don't right away feel that you have to know

00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:08.940
what some stranger in God knows where is going
to say. I mean, what do they know about what

00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:12.020
you're doing in your essence? Yes.

00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:20.810
&gt;&gt;female member #4: Thank you so much for
coming. I recently joined a women's writing

00:33:20.810 --> 00:33:26.920
circle and I was wondering if you could give
some advice on. I'm not a great writer, I'm

00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:32.200
not a good writer at all, actually, but I
just would love to get some advice. What type

00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:38.410
of writing exercises would you recommend or
ways to go about writing? I mean, I think

00:33:38.410 --> 00:33:42.220
you're what you just said about feedback is
really, really important, but anything more

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:43.950
to that would be great.

00:33:43.950 --> 00:33:46.980
&gt;&gt;Walker: Well, feedback from me is different.

00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:47.980
[laughter]

00:33:47.980 --> 00:34:00.070
Because I want you to just grow perfectly
as yourself. Period. End of story. I think

00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:05.101
you should just do your, do your reading.
Writing, actually, is more about reading.

00:34:05.101 --> 00:34:10.760
It's not about exercises. It's about reading,
reading, reading, reading everything and everybody

00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:19.669
starting in, I dunno, the whichever century
catches your fancy. And just fall completely

00:34:19.669 --> 00:34:25.800
in love with how words sound and how sentences
make you feel and how paragraphs ring, you

00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:31.109
know? I mean, get one of those two page long
sentences of Faulkner, for instance.

00:34:31.109 --> 00:34:32.109
[laughter]

00:34:32.109 --> 00:34:38.299
And just go all over the country with it.
And, and just fall in love with what it is

00:34:38.299 --> 00:34:41.639
you're doing. I think that's the best way.

00:34:41.639 --> 00:34:43.500
&gt;&gt;member #4: Thank you.

00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:44.500
&gt;&gt;Walker: Mm-hmm.

00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:50.230
&gt;&gt;Male member #5: Hi. So, I had a question
about the MFA programs and the number of [inaudible]

00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:55.789
we have today. So, what do you see the increasing
number of MFA programs, the number of writers

00:34:55.789 --> 00:35:01.779
who go and study, would that result in us
having more appreciation for character driven

00:35:01.779 --> 00:35:05.420
literary fiction in the age where there's
a lot more fiction that's produced?

00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:10.020
&gt;&gt;Walker: I didn't really understand what
you said.

00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:16.020
&gt;&gt;member #5: So there is most of these MFA
programs kind of encourage character driven

00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:20.430
literary fiction and writers who pass out
of MFA programs write literary fiction.

00:35:20.430 --> 00:35:21.430
&gt;&gt;Walker: Yes.

00:35:21.430 --> 00:35:25.279
&gt;&gt;member #5: So, would you think that a lot
of writers doing that would create more of

00:35:25.279 --> 00:35:29.700
an appreciation for character driven literary
fiction?

00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:36.320
&gt;&gt;Walker: I don't know. I, what comes to mind
is though, is this wonderful little tale from

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:40.819
Flannery O'Connor, who said, someone said
to her, "Well, do you think more writers should,

00:35:40.819 --> 00:35:51.079
let's see, do you think universities, academic
life kills writers?" And she said, "Unfortunately,

00:35:51.079 --> 00:35:52.369
not enough of them."

00:35:52.369 --> 00:35:53.369
[laughter]

00:35:53.369 --> 00:36:01.480
So, I don't know how that fits in, but, but
I've always loved it. Which is to say that

00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:12.940
if you really want to write passionate living
words, its better, I think, just to pay attention

00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:23.740
to what you're trying to express rather than
any group thing. That's what I mean. I love,

00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:31.710
I was always someone who loved school and
I loved being in college, but at the moment

00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:39.549
when I could've gotten a grant to go on to
graduate school and study literature in this

00:36:39.549 --> 00:36:47.740
way, in writing courses and writing courses
that have long names and everything. My poetry

00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:56.869
teacher, who I went to to get a recommendation
to get this grant, just refused. She said,

00:36:56.869 --> 00:37:05.349
"Oh, no. I'm not going to sign you away to
graduate school because it will hurt you."

00:37:05.349 --> 00:37:14.420
And I have to say, I was so annoyed and angry
with her, but she was right. So, this may

00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:23.930
or may not be anywhere near the answer that
you need, but it's basically to say stay close

00:37:23.930 --> 00:37:36.559
to the story itself that you want to write.
Don't let it bleed away into a course or some

00:37:36.559 --> 00:37:45.960
organized fiction thing. Don't do that. And,
for some reason, I keep thinking of Arundhati

00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:51.730
Roy's The God of Small Things, which is such
a brilliant book. And I just met her last,

00:37:51.730 --> 00:37:58.809
a few, some months ago, I was in India and
hanging out with her and seeing that this

00:37:58.809 --> 00:38:08.329
spirit, this spirit that wrote this book stayed
deliberately close to, in this case, Kerala,

00:38:08.329 --> 00:38:16.680
in India and the sights and the sounds and
the languages of the people and the stories

00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:24.119
and the other encouragement that she needed
to write this would've come from her own solitary

00:38:24.119 --> 00:38:28.259
study of literature, not from any kind of
conglomerate.

00:38:28.259 --> 00:38:30.350
&gt;&gt;member #5: Thank you.

00:38:30.350 --> 00:38:31.350
[pause]

00:38:31.350 --> 00:38:40.660
&gt;&gt;presenter: So, while Dolores is queuing
up I had a, I did have a question. So we've

00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:41.940
talked about the Internet and how people are
using it to get information and probably,

00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:42.940
Google is responsible for giving us so much
information, but the other thing that's happening

00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:44.809
is that people are really using it to advance
causes.

00:38:44.809 --> 00:38:46.309
&gt;&gt;Walker: Mm-hmm.

00:38:46.309 --> 00:38:56.779
&gt;&gt;presenter: So, there isn't anyone in this
room who probably hasn't supported a cause

00:38:56.779 --> 00:39:03.849
on Facebook or supported a cause and followed
something on Twitter. And as an activist,

00:39:03.849 --> 00:39:07.549
do you really see this as a great medium to
really advance different causes, or is it

00:39:07.549 --> 00:39:13.760
a distraction? Is it really helping, or is
it not helping?

00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:17.740
&gt;&gt;Walker: Oh, I think it's helping a lot.
I like it. I use AVAAZ the, I don't know what

00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:28.740
you call it, but it's an organization that
can send a million signatures to representatives

00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:31.880
of wherever they're doing something awful--

00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:33.140
[presenter laughs]

00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:41.700
which is like, everywhere, but they can do
this in a concerted way, quickly. We can also,

00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:53.849
through them, send money to Haiti, to Pakistan,
to wherever people need help. I love this

00:39:53.849 --> 00:40:00.089
function of the Internet and I actually love,
very much, being able to Google anything.

00:40:00.089 --> 00:40:01.730
I mean, that's, that's fabulous.

00:40:01.730 --> 00:40:04.190
&gt;&gt;presenter: Great. We're glad to hear that.

00:40:04.190 --> 00:40:07.990
&gt;&gt;Walker: Oh, no. I'm not saying that it's
a bad thing, I'm just saying that like everything,

00:40:07.990 --> 00:40:14.749
you have to learn how to use it because if
you just use it in a way that is just the

00:40:14.749 --> 00:40:22.640
information without the heart, you can disfigure
yourself. You can become people who just know

00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:28.839
facts and figures, but you basically, emotionally
you don't grow. You just know a lot of facts

00:40:28.839 --> 00:40:29.980
and figures. And we see where that leads.

00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:40.349
&gt;&gt;Female member #6: Hi. I loved your story
of when you were in Gaza and you, you just

00:40:40.349 --> 00:40:48.109
danced with the women there and I imagine
that took a lot of courage, but there was

00:40:48.109 --> 00:40:51.059
a naturalness to it and in the preface, you
talk about how you learned how to dance through

00:40:51.059 --> 00:40:55.960
the slings and arrows of life and became an
optimist. And I guess I'm curious about what

00:40:55.960 --> 00:41:00.540
advice you have for the rest of us who are
also going through the slings and arrows and

00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:07.569
addressing human nature to have that same
attitude. And I, actually, I'm curious about

00:41:07.569 --> 00:41:09.470
the actual dancing part, too.

00:41:09.470 --> 00:41:10.470
[laughter]

00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:16.319
&gt;&gt;Walker: Yeah, well, we launched this book
Hard Times Require Furious Dancing a couple

00:41:16.319 --> 00:41:24.069
weekends ago at Busboys &amp; Poets in D.C. and
the man who owns it, Andy Shallal, emptied

00:41:24.069 --> 00:41:33.109
the restaurant/bookstore of all the furniture
and tables and everything and people did,

00:41:33.109 --> 00:41:41.420
and just had a DJ, actually, who played a
lot of Al Green and James Brown and Bob Marley

00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:50.869
and people just danced until they felt a lot
better about themselves and everything is

00:41:50.869 --> 00:42:00.759
happening. I've, I think that I was in South
Africa last month and part of the medicine

00:42:00.759 --> 00:42:09.789
of that trip was to talk about how they now
have a president who's just very disturbing

00:42:09.789 --> 00:42:18.049
for them and a very big step backward in terms
of leadership and vision. And the people are

00:42:18.049 --> 00:42:24.270
feeling a lot of despair, especially the women.
And I was saying that part of what we can

00:42:24.270 --> 00:42:34.250
do is start to circle in each other's homes
and let, call up seven or eight of your friends

00:42:34.250 --> 00:42:39.730
and just have a circle without an agenda,
but something that expresses your deepest

00:42:39.730 --> 00:42:46.869
concerns about the state of your country,
the state of your world and the world, and

00:42:46.869 --> 00:42:52.819
that this might be a way for the concentric
circles to finally join and it would be a

00:42:52.819 --> 00:43:06.460
very organic way of transforming the planet.
This is not like trying to do it by doing

00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:12.730
it with Internet. It's similar, but where
the Internet is like this wonderful, I'm an

00:43:12.730 --> 00:43:18.299
Aquarian, so the Internet is perfect for me.
I mean, this circling is, too, but the idea

00:43:18.299 --> 00:43:24.529
of thoughts just going through the air and
transforming things, that's just fabulous.

00:43:24.529 --> 00:43:32.039
It's what I've been waiting for, but also
grounding so that you don't become just, as

00:43:32.039 --> 00:43:40.660
Aquarians can often be, in the air. You need
to be in the ground, you need to be really

00:43:40.660 --> 00:43:47.740
solid. And this way of circling with other
people can help that a lot and also helps

00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:56.450
us to feel more at home with our ideas and
with our fears if we can do that with other

00:43:56.450 --> 00:43:57.710
people.

00:43:57.710 --> 00:44:06.670
&gt;&gt;presenter: Belinda, do you want to ask another
question from the Dory page?

00:44:06.670 --> 00:44:11.619
&gt;&gt;Belinda: Question, "For Colored Girls Who
Considered Suicide When the Rainbow is Enuf"

00:44:11.619 --> 00:44:17.999
has been adapted for screen by Tyler Perry.
Do you see a tension between the benefits

00:44:17.999 --> 00:44:24.029
of bringing works to a larger, mainstream
audience in the loss of artistic control and/or

00:44:24.029 --> 00:44:29.450
message?" And I think we can make parallels
to The Color Purple, too, I imagine, with

00:44:29.450 --> 00:44:30.530
this question.

00:44:30.530 --> 00:44:38.470
&gt;&gt;Walker: There's always a danger in creativity
and sharing it with people because the level

00:44:38.470 --> 00:44:44.700
of understanding differs. People often just
have no idea what you're trying to do. But

00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:53.069
I think it's worth the risk if you are intent
on transforming society. And I think that

00:44:53.069 --> 00:44:58.820
in Ntozake Shange's play, which she wrote
I think 30-something years ago, was very much

00:44:58.820 --> 00:45:03.849
about transforming society and having people
really look at what was happening to these

00:45:03.849 --> 00:45:13.619
seven women of color. So, I hope that the
movie is well done and I've seen some of Tyler

00:45:13.619 --> 00:45:19.660
Perry's movies and some I like a lot; some,
not so much. But some, I think, are really

00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:26.000
very wonderful and warm and thoughtful. And
I'm hoping that he can bring all of that to

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:27.000
this classic work by Shange.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:28.000
&gt;&gt;presenter: Yeah, sure.

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:29.509
&gt;&gt;Female member #7: Hello. Thank you for coming.
I, as you talk about the different places

00:45:29.509 --> 00:45:38.020
where you've travelled to as an activist,
I was wondering, how do you balance the desire

00:45:38.020 --> 00:45:42.839
to change the world and transform the world
and bring healing to different places, but

00:45:42.839 --> 00:45:50.210
also being culturally sensitive to what's
going on in that particular place and not

00:45:50.210 --> 00:45:56.990
imposing something that may not necessarily
be welcomed where you travel?

00:45:56.990 --> 00:46:03.619
&gt;&gt;Walker: Mm-hmm. Well, I'm very small, so--

00:46:03.619 --> 00:46:04.619
[laughter]

00:46:04.619 --> 00:46:14.430
I doubt that I could impose very much. My
intent, also, is just to be there as a witness

00:46:14.430 --> 00:46:21.790
and as a witness to report what it is that
I witnessed. The transformation of the world,

00:46:21.790 --> 00:46:29.359
I understand, is a group effort. I don't see
myself doing it by myself. I think that as

00:46:29.359 --> 00:46:34.950
a writer, and as someone whose parents and
grandparents suffered a great deal so that

00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:43.079
I could be educated, is part of my duty, really,
to use that education to see that other people

00:46:43.079 --> 00:46:49.970
are more happy. I mean that rather is more
like for me, I would like people to be free

00:46:49.970 --> 00:46:57.670
and I want them to really enjoy life. There
will always be people in cultures who don't

00:46:57.670 --> 00:47:04.220
believe that and who don't want to hear it
and who would rather say that you were there

00:47:04.220 --> 00:47:11.279
to destroy them. And I don't know what you
can do about those people. They do exist.

00:47:11.279 --> 00:47:17.470
Now, for instance, with the work that I did
with female genital mutilation, which took,

00:47:17.470 --> 00:47:27.369
I worked on that issue for about a decade
and often, African men and a lot of it was

00:47:27.369 --> 00:47:31.989
in Africa, but this is not something that
just happens in Africa, but the men would

00:47:31.989 --> 00:47:39.789
say things like, "Oh, no. This doesn't happen
at all. You're delusional." And a lot of the

00:47:39.789 --> 00:47:45.819
women couldn't say anything because it was
a taboo in their culture and they could be

00:47:45.819 --> 00:47:57.950
killed. So, what do you do? If you have a
feeling of love and concern for 130 million

00:47:57.950 --> 00:48:03.999
women who've been mutilated, what do you do?
You're having people who can't even talk about

00:48:03.999 --> 00:48:11.799
it in their own culture. What is our responsibility?
And then I think about my own life and the

00:48:11.799 --> 00:48:19.279
lives of my ancestors in Georgia, Mississippi,
Alabama, Louisiana, when they were enslaved

00:48:19.279 --> 00:48:27.809
and they had no rights. They could not speak
about their own enslavement. They, so they

00:48:27.809 --> 00:48:36.239
really, their lives depended on people coming
from other parts of the country to help them.

00:48:36.239 --> 00:48:44.191
And, in fact, we would not have been un-enslaved
if we had not had a lot of help from people

00:48:44.191 --> 00:48:52.890
from the North. So, I factor that in that
often, when people cannot speak for themselves,

00:48:52.890 --> 00:48:58.450
they depend on us to speak for them and then
that leads us to the higher understanding

00:48:58.450 --> 00:49:06.450
that we're not separate. If I speak for you,
it's because I'm speaking for me. I, it's

00:49:06.450 --> 00:49:10.829
what Gandhi said. Someone said to Gandhi,
"Well why do you do all this stuff you do

00:49:10.829 --> 00:49:15.319
for other people?" And he drew himself up,
he was a short man, but he drew himself up

00:49:15.319 --> 00:49:21.990
and he said, "Madam, I don't do it for anyone
else. I do it for myself." And that's what

00:49:21.990 --> 00:49:30.609
you do it for. The idea that people are separate
is really our greatest delusion. We're not.

00:49:30.609 --> 00:49:38.920
I mean, it's just, when you, when you begin
to see that you're not separate the idea that

00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:44.690
people think they're separate is so amusing.
It's like, for instance, if you tell, if I

00:49:44.690 --> 00:49:51.049
tell you a story, I won't do it because it
would be very gruesome and I don't wanna do

00:49:51.049 --> 00:49:57.529
that to the people here, but I could tell
you a story that would be really gruesome

00:49:57.529 --> 00:50:04.960
and you would feel it in your body. That's
how much we are the same. You're one, but

00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:10.920
we just, we get to running around, separately,
we think. But we're really one expression.

00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:11.920
&gt;&gt;member #7: Thank you.

00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:12.920
&gt;&gt;Walker: You're welcome.

00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:13.920
[laughter]

00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:14.920
&gt;&gt;presenter: So, we maybe have time for one
more question, either from the audience or

00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:16.660
from the Dory page before we have to wrap
up. Go ahead.

00:50:16.660 --> 00:50:20.869
&gt;&gt;Belinda: I have my personal--

00:50:20.869 --> 00:50:30.079
&gt;&gt;presenter: Sure, you can ask own Belinda.

00:50:30.079 --> 00:50:39.180
&gt;&gt;Belinda: Ms. Walker, we talked before this
session. I shared with you that I grew up

00:50:39.180 --> 00:50:44.269
in Mississippi, especially during the height
of the Civil Rights Movement as a child and

00:50:44.269 --> 00:50:51.381
I witnessed all the things that, that, that
are chronicled in history books now. And one

00:50:51.381 --> 00:50:57.170
thing that I wanted to bring up is that we
talk about the heavyweights, Martin Luther

00:50:57.170 --> 00:51:07.329
King, Medgar Evers, just a list of names,
but one of my heroes is Fannie, Fannie Lou

00:51:07.329 --> 00:51:16.349
Hamer and she was a woman that just came from
a sharecropper background and she had no formal

00:51:16.349 --> 00:51:22.200
education, but she was really powerful when
she really stood up to the Democratic National

00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:27.700
Committee in 1964. And so, and I think about
her and I think about my grandmother and different

00:51:27.700 --> 00:51:34.660
women who really had no voice to a certain
degree; that lack of formal education and

00:51:34.660 --> 00:51:41.049
confidence. But yet, it's like they're the
unsung heroes. Like, when Rosa Parks was out

00:51:41.049 --> 00:51:48.430
there, when Martin Luther King led the Birmingham
Boycott, it was the maids who, did not go

00:51:48.430 --> 00:51:55.549
to work and sacrifice and then I think about
the times we live in now and where are those

00:51:55.549 --> 00:52:04.410
unsung heroes? I know I see the Tea Party
Movement and I see like moveon.org, even though

00:52:04.410 --> 00:52:11.009
that's an online space, but sometimes it worries
me that where are those unsung heroes who

00:52:11.009 --> 00:52:17.480
really make a difference? Do they, do they
still exist today? Do you see that in your

00:52:17.480 --> 00:52:21.971
travels? Am I just jaded and cynical? Thank
you.

00:52:21.971 --> 00:52:26.940
&gt;&gt;Walker: Well, I was gonna say, who do you
think is getting all these other people out

00:52:26.940 --> 00:52:32.970
of bed? Those are the unsung heroes; the mothers,
fathers, whoever is doing the work of getting

00:52:32.970 --> 00:52:40.150
the rest of the world moving, but you don't
see them and you don't acknowledge them. Those

00:52:40.150 --> 00:52:50.980
are the unsung heroes. Me, for instance, cause
I was saying to you my mother was such a heroic

00:52:50.980 --> 00:52:53.890
woman, but I'm the only person who wrote about
her. But that doesn't mean that she didn't

00:52:53.890 --> 00:52:59.450
exist and she's not existing now. They're
all the people in the world who make it their

00:52:59.450 --> 00:53:10.809
business to see that the rest of us are sitting
in this room. We're all sitting here and somewhere,

00:53:10.809 --> 00:53:19.539
behind each of us, there are these unsung
people who made it possible for us to be here.

00:53:19.539 --> 00:53:20.609
That's who gets it done.

00:53:20.609 --> 00:53:22.310
&gt;&gt;Belinda: Right. And I also think that it's
reflective in many of your works. I talked

00:53:22.310 --> 00:53:28.740
to you about the book you wrote, Meridian,
and that main character and a lot of the things

00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:34.309
that I saw with her, reminded me of people
that I observed when I was a child or grew

00:53:34.309 --> 00:53:42.900
up with. So, I appreciate you and other artists
who think about just regular, everyday people,

00:53:42.900 --> 00:53:48.339
just getting up doing what they have to do
and no one ever acknowledges or thanks them.

00:53:48.339 --> 00:53:53.570
&gt;&gt;Walker: Yes. Well, lemme just say a few
things. One is that the reason I wrote Meridian

00:53:53.570 --> 00:54:01.390
was because I understood that revolutionaries
are often flawed; they're badly flawed. But

00:54:01.390 --> 00:54:06.509
that is not the reason you should not follow
them. I mean, you should follow them precisely

00:54:06.509 --> 00:54:13.400
because they are flawed. And so, this book
is actually looking at the ways in which all

00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:21.430
of these revolutionaries in the 60s in Mississippi
had had something really awry and they kept

00:54:21.430 --> 00:54:30.359
going. And this is the reality of people.
We make the changes in society, whether we

00:54:30.359 --> 00:54:36.859
call ourselves revolutionaries or radicals
or just irritants, but we make the changes

00:54:36.859 --> 00:54:46.380
that transform society. And a few of us will
then be sung. And that's, we accept that.

00:54:46.380 --> 00:54:54.319
We have to. I was gonna try an adopt an African
child and then I realized that I probably

00:54:54.319 --> 00:54:58.349
would not be the best parent at this point,
so I adopted an orphanage--

00:54:58.349 --> 00:54:59.349
[laughter]

00:54:59.349 --> 00:55:10.859
and there are 87 children in this orphanage
and the woman who runs it and I were looking

00:55:10.859 --> 00:55:18.019
at pictures of the children, and she just
said matter of factly, she said, "You know,

00:55:18.019 --> 00:55:25.309
only one in two of these children will actually
develop into what we are imagining." Only

00:55:25.309 --> 00:55:32.809
one in two of them, and the rest? Who knows
what will become of them? But that's it. I

00:55:32.809 --> 00:55:38.720
mean, the rest of them will go on into their
lives; they will do whatever it is. One or

00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:52.509
two will become Mandela or Obama or [inaudible]
or somebody that we envision, or Wangari Maathai,

00:55:52.509 --> 00:56:03.859
or [inaudible]. They will become what, that's
not what happens to most of us and yet, I

00:56:03.859 --> 00:56:11.130
think part of what we do have to do in our
literature and our life is to affirm the person

00:56:11.130 --> 00:56:19.630
who causes the growth of the other person.
There's a Cherokee poet, Marilou Awiakta,

00:56:19.630 --> 00:56:29.960
who says something like, "Every flower has
two parts of it. One is the flower that you

00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:36.349
see and then there's the root where the mother
is often the root that you don't see." That's

00:56:36.349 --> 00:56:41.160
the root; the father that you don't see and
you just see the flower.

00:56:41.160 --> 00:56:43.400
&gt;&gt;Belinda: Thank you very much.

00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:44.400
&gt;&gt;Walker: Mm-hmm.

00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:57.109
&gt;&gt;presenter: Thank you. I think I speak for
everyone when I say that that last comment

00:56:57.109 --> 00:57:02.660
was very powerful and will give us all something
to think about as we think about our roles,

00:57:02.660 --> 00:57:04.470
whether we're sung or whether we're unsung,
and which one matters to us. I've heard you

00:57:04.470 --> 00:57:06.609
say once or twice, that you don't have expectations
and you prefer to live in the moment.

00:57:06.609 --> 00:57:08.019
&gt;&gt;Walker: Mm-hmm.

00:57:08.019 --> 00:57:12.150
&gt;&gt;presenter: I can say that I hope you enjoyed
this moment and I hope that you all enjoyed

00:57:12.150 --> 00:57:13.150
this moment with Ms. Walker, so thank you
for coming.

00:57:13.150 --> 00:57:14.150
&gt;&gt;Walker: Mm-hmm. Thank you. Thank you. Thank
you.

00:57:14.150 --> 00:57:14.151
[applause]
