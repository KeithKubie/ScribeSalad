00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.993
Early stage investors want to invest
in people around them because

00:00:03.993 --> 00:00:04.892
they want to help.

00:00:04.892 --> 00:00:06.698
They want to be there
on a regular basis and

00:00:06.698 --> 00:00:09.470
go through this super difficult
thing of building a startup.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:11.587
So, usually,

00:00:11.587 --> 00:00:15.427
your early investors are going to come
from the immediate vicinity around you.

00:00:15.427 --> 00:00:19.312
If there are no such investors around
you that are aligned with your business

00:00:19.312 --> 00:00:20.949
or you feel you can reach out to,

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:24.181
I think putting yourself in
a position where you can find ways.

00:00:24.181 --> 00:00:28.552
So for example if you are not
in a big metropolitan,

00:00:28.552 --> 00:00:33.342
perhaps going to accelerator program for
a few months.

00:00:33.342 --> 00:00:37.592
Perhaps thinking about where the best
place to set up your business maybe

00:00:37.592 --> 00:00:41.366
closer to your customers that
might be in a large metropolitan.

00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:45.684
I think those are some of the things you
should be thinking about in order to get

00:00:45.684 --> 00:00:47.090
close to the investors.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.301
Because investors, it's not about giving
you a check and wishing you good luck.

00:00:51.301 --> 00:00:52.718
They want to be there for you.

00:00:52.718 --> 00:00:54.226
They want to help you and for

00:00:54.226 --> 00:00:57.910
that they feel they need to be
geographically located next to you.
