00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.280
Removing People From History (Damnatio Memoriae)

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:07.400
Damnatio memoriae (condemnation of memory)
was a punishment reserved for certain people

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.580
the Romans decided to dishonour for one reason
or another.

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.860
Rather impressively, it involved trying to
get rid of all records that the person ever

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:15.860
existed.

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.010
Understandably, historians aren’t aware
of any people to whom this dishonor was successfully

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.480
applied, since if they did, it wouldn’t
have been successful.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.450
They are, however, aware of a number of high
profile cases in which damnatio memoriae was

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:31.769
decreed, but we still know of the individuals
today.

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.829
Before we get ahead of ourselves, we should
discuss what the specifics are behind damnatio

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:40.550
memoriae itself and what one would need to
do to earn such a punishment.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.530
Damnatio memoriae was normally reserved for
those such as Senators and Emperors whose

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.020
acts did not reflect well on Rome, or those
who committed treason or a number of other

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.379
serious crimes.

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:54.789
Brutal or tyrannical emperors were particularly
susceptible to earning a date with the giant

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:56.289
eraser of history.

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:00.809
The methods used to rid the world of any record
of the individual in question included striking

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.350
the individual’s name from all official
records; seizing their possessions; and anything

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.979
bearing their likeness or name (statues, murals,
writings, etc.) would be destroyed or otherwise

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.030
defaced.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.290
To really rub it in, if the person being stricken
from memory just so happened to be dead at

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.460
the time, which was common, their will would
be annulled and their grave defaced.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.720
That said, fully removing some of these high
profile people, such as Emperors, from history

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.180
proved to be exceptionally difficult, and
despite the Roman’s best efforts, at least

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.290
some of the people who suffered damnatio memoriae
as a punishment are still in the history books.

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:40.900
For example, consider Roman Emperor Maxentius
who, despite being a victim of damnatio memoriae

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.840
in 312AD at the hands of Emperor Constantine,
we still know a lot about.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:53.600
Maxentius’ father, Maximian, was also subjected
to damnatio memoriae in 310AD by Emperor Constantine.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.490
However, Constantine changed his mind and
Maximian was instead deified, essentially

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.860
making him a God in the eyes of the Roman
people.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.329
Which we’re sure he would have enjoyed more
if Constantine hadn’t forced him to commit

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:06.009
suicide in 310AD.

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:11.900
A Roman Emperor that was, rather surprisingly,
saved from this fate was the famously mad,

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:12.920
Emperor Caligula.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.430
When Caligula was assassinated in 41 AD, his
successor, Claudius immediately shot down

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.970
the Senate’s attempts at removing his nephew’s
memory from history.

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.260
This is a particularly notable case in that
it is known that the decision to try to remove

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.910
Caligula from history was heavily influenced
by public opinion, suggesting that popular

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.570
opinion played a part in deciding who to punish
via damnatio memoriae.

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:40.030
Perhaps one of the more dark instances of
damnatio memoriae is the story of Publius

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.700
Septimius Geta who was murdered in his mother’s
arms on his older brother, Caracalla’s,

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:45.700
orders.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.270
After the murder of his brother, Caracalla
declared damnatio memoriae on his brother’s

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.880
name and had 20,000 people he didn’t like
executed while he was at it.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.860
By all accounts, Caracalla’s order was incredibly
thorough and few images of Geta survived.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.950
However, there was one thing Caracalla couldn’t
get rid of completely, the millions of coins

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.610
sporting his brother’s face circulating
freely throughout his empire.

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.890
Also, due to Geta’s popularity with the
people of Rome, Caracalla was forced to give

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.410
his brother a lavish funeral.

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.580
Damnatio memoriae is still practiced on occasion
by various people and groups in one form or

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:18.580
another.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.360
For instance Stalin was famous for erasing
people he didn’t like from photos and official

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.417
documents, such as the picture included in
the show notes.

00:03:23.417 --> 00:03:29.230
The disappearing man is Nikolai Yezkov, one
time very powerful head of the NKVD (People’s

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.430
Commissariat for Internal Affairs).

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.100
In his post there, he presided over numerous
tortures and mass-executions during the Great

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.830
Purge, but later fell out of favor and himself
was tortured until he admitted to being a

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.940
traitor; after this, he himself was purged.

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.850
Once this happened, he became “The Vanishing
Commisar” with records of him, including

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:52.670
in photographs, suddenly disappearing, which
was no small feat given the high profile position

00:03:52.670 --> 00:04:07.260
Yezkov had previously held.
