ALEX DANILO: When you're
developing for Google Cast,

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.260
you have to realize it's a true
multiscreen experience, where

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.710
you have a phone or tablet
in your hand connected

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.420
to a big, beautiful
TV in the living room.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.830
Now, I can choose a
video to play on my phone

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:19.970
and send it to the Cast device.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.190
How good is that?

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:24.074
Hold on a sec.

00:00:26.726 --> 00:00:28.100
Now while playing,
I might choose

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.260
to put my phone in my
pocket or walk away.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.150
And if I walk out
of Wi-Fi range,

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.140
I'll loose connection
with the Cast device.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.353
But the video should keep
playing because I haven't

00:00:36.353 --> 00:00:37.478
intentionally disconnected.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.600
[VIDEO PLAYING]

00:00:45.791 --> 00:00:47.582
Now that I've finished
with that treatment,

00:00:47.582 --> 00:00:51.454
I might decide to go back to my
movie and start watching again.

00:00:51.454 --> 00:00:53.620
If I walk back into Wi-Fi
range, the app on my phone

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:54.890
should connect automatically.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.790
We call that reconnection logic.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.670
It's really important
for a good experience

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.470
that your user feels in
control, and reconnection logic

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.160
is core to that principle.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.494
So that's something to remember.

00:01:04.494 --> 00:01:06.493
MALE SPEAKER: Excuse me,
we're trying work here.

00:01:06.493 --> 00:01:07.785
Would you mind keeping it down?

00:01:07.785 --> 00:01:09.368
ALEX DANILO: Whilst
connected, I might

00:01:09.368 --> 00:01:11.099
choose to disconnect
from the Cast device

00:01:11.099 --> 00:01:12.515
and continue
watching on my phone.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.260
Now if I disconnect, what
should happen on the big TV

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.630
is that since no one's
connected to the Cast device,

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.656
the video should stop playing.

00:01:22.656 --> 00:01:24.780
But, on the other hand, we
do have the shared model

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.040
where you can have one
or many people connected

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.320
to the Cast device.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.290
So for example, if
I'm watching YouTube,

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.900
I can Cast content to my TV set.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.340
And then my kid
decides they want

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.080
something else in
the playlist, they

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.360
can connect to add
their selection.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.570
If I then disconnect
from the cast device,

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.060
the video should keep playing
because my kid is still

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.630
connected to the Cast device.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.240
We call that
multisyndicapability.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.390
Looking at it another way, to
avoid the Cast device playing

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.370
back without anyone
in control, you

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.460
should always ensure
at least one user

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.640
is connected to the Cast device.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.385
Adhering to these UX
guidelines will give your users

00:01:59.385 --> 00:02:02.340
a beautiful experience
that will appear magical.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.090
Not only that, but if you
do everything by the book,

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.810
we might even feature your app.

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.030
And that's pretty cool.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.580
