particular but all of us I think agreed
that we need to focus on small farmer

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040
that we need to focus on small farmer
 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.830
that we need to focus on small farmer
production in the smallholders because

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840
production in the smallholders because
 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.389
production in the smallholders because
such a large proportion eighty percent

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399
such a large proportion eighty percent
 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.900
such a large proportion eighty percent
of India's farmers are smallholders many

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910
of India's farmers are smallholders many
 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.290
of India's farmers are smallholders many
of them are also women and so we need to

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300
of them are also women and so we need to
 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.470
of them are also women and so we need to
not only increase infrastructure but we

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480
not only increase infrastructure but we
 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.889
not only increase infrastructure but we
also need to look at the axis of

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899
also need to look at the axis of
 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.880
also need to look at the axis of
smallholders and them in farmers to that

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890
smallholders and them in farmers to that
 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.819

infrastructure we need to focus on

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829
infrastructure we need to focus on
 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.830

technology extension and to marketing
 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.210
technology extension and to marketing
I've also feel that it's very important

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220
I've also feel that it's very important
 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.190
I've also feel that it's very important
to look at aggregation because if you're

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200
to look at aggregation because if you're
 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.780
to look at aggregation because if you're
very small you don't take advantage of

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790
very small you don't take advantage of
 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.480
very small you don't take advantage of
economies of scale so aggregation

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490
economies of scale so aggregation
 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.940
economies of scale so aggregation
requires cooperation and although

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950
requires cooperation and although
 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.440
requires cooperation and although
there's quite a lot of talk about

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450
there's quite a lot of talk about
 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.420
there's quite a lot of talk about
cooperation marketing and that's

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430
cooperation marketing and that's
 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.670
cooperation marketing and that's
certainly very important we also need to

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680
certainly very important we also need to
 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.980
certainly very important we also need to
move beyond that to other aspects of the

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990
move beyond that to other aspects of the
 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.469
move beyond that to other aspects of the
value chain for instance it's extremely

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479
value chain for instance it's extremely
 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.050
value chain for instance it's extremely
important to look at crop planning and

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060
important to look at crop planning and
 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.789
important to look at crop planning and
access to inputs of small farmers and

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799
access to inputs of small farmers and
 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.580
access to inputs of small farmers and
perhaps we can be even more innovative

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590
perhaps we can be even more innovative
 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.100
perhaps we can be even more innovative
and see whether it's possible for small

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110
and see whether it's possible for small
 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.840
and see whether it's possible for small
farmers to come together to pull their

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850
farmers to come together to pull their
 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.380
farmers to come together to pull their
land and farm as groups and those would

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390
land and farm as groups and those would
 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.240
land and farm as groups and those would
enable them to get the advantages that

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250
enable them to get the advantages that
 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.020
enable them to get the advantages that
middle level farmers have there are some

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030
middle level farmers have there are some
 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.590

interesting ideas VI was chairing the

12th plan working group on disadvantaged
 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.179
12th plan working group on disadvantaged
farmers and one of the ideas we put a

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189
farmers and one of the ideas we put a
 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.600
farmers and one of the ideas we put a
cross was the idea of a land bank which

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610
cross was the idea of a land bank which
 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.690
cross was the idea of a land bank which
is at the village level if everybody who

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700
is at the village level if everybody who
 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.910
is at the village level if everybody who

and to lease out could put it into the

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569
and to lease out could put it into the
 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.199
and to lease out could put it into the
bank and get returns from that in

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209
bank and get returns from that in

everybody who wanted to lease inland
 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.850
everybody who wanted to lease inland
could come to the bank and Lee sin and

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860
could come to the bank and Lee sin and
 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.660
could come to the bank and Lee sin and
this would protect the lessor and lessee

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670
this would protect the lessor and lessee
 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.720
this would protect the lessor and lessee
and reduce the transaction costs this

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730
and reduce the transaction costs this
 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.280
and reduce the transaction costs this
should be open particularly to small

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290
should be open particularly to small
 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.720
should be open particularly to small

discussed it a bit but perhaps it needs

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280
discussed it a bit but perhaps it needs
 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.400

much more discussion is that food

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410
much more discussion is that food
 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.009
much more discussion is that food
security is also about nutritional

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019
security is also about nutritional
 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.589
security is also about nutritional
security and in that context we need to

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599
security and in that context we need to
 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:45.110
security and in that context we need to
look at what happens across households

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120
look at what happens across households
 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.759
look at what happens across households
the inequalities across households but

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769
the inequalities across households but
 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:49.130
the inequalities across households but
also what happens within households why

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140
also what happens within households why
 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.600
also what happens within households why
is it that some there is so much

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610
is it that some there is so much
