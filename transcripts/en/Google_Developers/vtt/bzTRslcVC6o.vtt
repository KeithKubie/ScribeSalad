TODD KERPELMAN: We all ready?

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:06.550
Hey, look at that.

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:08.130
We're ready to go.

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.436
Hi, everybody.

00:00:09.436 --> 00:00:10.270
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:12.667
TODD KERPELMAN: Oh, wow.

00:00:12.667 --> 00:00:13.500
Let's do that again.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.500
Hi, everybody.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.756
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:00:15.756 --> 00:00:16.630
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah.

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.720
Wow, I did not think this crowd
would have any energy at 3:00

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.670
on a Friday afternoon,
when everyone's tired

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:22.920
or hungover or both.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.610
But this is great.

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:25.370
So, hi.

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:26.570
I am Todd Kerpelman.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.750
Thank you for attending
the Developing with Google

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.200
on iOS presentation.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.320
I'll be honest, I was worried
giving this talk on iOS

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.924
at Google I/O at 3 o'clock
on a Friday afternoon.

00:00:36.924 --> 00:00:38.340
There was going
to be nobody here.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.220
But like, there's
hundreds of you out here.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.010
This is a big crowd.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.594
You're all here to
see this, right?

00:00:45.594 --> 00:00:46.890
OK.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.516
Man, I wish I'd
known there was going

00:00:48.516 --> 00:00:50.480
to be so many people, because
there's a lot of profanity

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.330
in this thing.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.800
I'm going to edit as we go.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.410
So anyhoo, often
in conversations,

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.640
when I tell people that I
am focused on iOS developer

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.430
products from Google,
the reaction I often get

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.980
is something along the
lines of, like, what?

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.470
Google doesn't do
anything on iOS, do they?

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.010
You must spend your
entire day eating snacks.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.070
But the truth of the
matter is, actually, yes, I

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.580
do mostly snacks.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.486
But also, no.

00:01:19.486 --> 00:01:20.860
Here's the thing
we want to know.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.910
Despite all of the
Android M announcements

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.879
and all the Android
Wear announcements

00:01:25.879 --> 00:01:28.170
and all the Apple versus
Google stories you're probably

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.140
going to see in
the blogosphere, we

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.780
care deeply about
iOS developers.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.220
We care about building
products and services

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.950
that you are all going to use.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.680
And the fact of
the matter is, we

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.610
live in a cross-platform world.

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.669
And we can't provide
you with services

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:44.960
that you're going to find
great unless you can use them

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.980
everywhere you're
building your app.

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.060
And so, to that end,
we have a number

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.740
of Google services
available for iOS developers

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.330
to help you develop your
app, engage with more users,

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.580
and of course, earn
a little money.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.780
Now we've been making
these libraries

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.930
more powerful over
the last few years.

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.050
But more recently, we've
also taken a few steps

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.110
to streamline the
developer experience

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.170
so that it is simpler
for you to add these

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.620
into your iOS project.

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:11.120
Combine that together and you
get something that-- ah, jeez.

00:02:14.027 --> 00:02:15.610
That's a little more
disturbing than I

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.460
thought it was going to be.

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:18.200
Shoo.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.993
Go on.

00:02:18.993 --> 00:02:19.492
Get out.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.370
Point being, we want
to make the power

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.220
of adding Google
to your application

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.420
simpler for all you
developers out there.

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.171
And the first big step we're
taking towards that goal

00:02:31.171 --> 00:02:32.170
is supporting CocoaPods.

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.675
All right, applause.

00:02:38.675 --> 00:02:40.300
Where were you guys
during the keynote?

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.380
We needed you then.

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.981
So a show of hands-- who
here has heard of CocoaPods.

00:02:45.981 --> 00:02:48.972
That's like nearly all of you.

00:02:48.972 --> 00:02:50.180
That's because it is awesome.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.720
But for the benefit of those
of us joining live stream

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.630
on YouTube-- hi, YouTube--
I'm going to just tell you

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:56.810
why CocoaPods is awesome.

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.850
It takes care of a lot
of the steps required

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.390
for adding third-party
libraries to any iOS project.

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.220
So it does things like
grabbing ZIP files

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.030
from around the web or your
favorite GitHub repository,

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.720
extracting the files you need,
adding them to your Xcode

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.830
project-- you can activate
whatever iOS frameworks are

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.120
needed for this library to
work and add any [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.114
compiler flags that you might
need, and blah, blah, blah.

00:03:20.114 --> 00:03:21.780
And of course, if any
of these libraries

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.080
depend on any other
libraries out there,

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.380
CocoaPods will go out,
find those other libraries,

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.140
repeat the entire process
until you have everything you

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:30.660
need for your library to work.

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.950
All these steps are taken
care of with one simple pod

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.346
install command.

00:03:35.346 --> 00:03:36.162
Look at that.

00:03:36.162 --> 00:03:37.870
And of course, if you
ever want to update

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.220
any of these
libraries, CocoaPods

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.678
will also go out
onto the internet,

00:03:40.678 --> 00:03:43.066
see if anything's
changed, and if so,

00:03:43.066 --> 00:03:45.690
reinstall it again and update it
for you with a very simple pod

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.800
update command,
assuming, of course,

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.750
that the pod specs
are up to date.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.200
And that's something
we'll get to in a moment.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.240
So we've talked to our
partners and most of them

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.281
have basically told us,
yeah, this is pretty much

00:03:56.281 --> 00:03:57.150
what we do anyway.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.525
And so we decided,
you know what?

00:03:58.525 --> 00:04:01.310
Let's just make CocoaPods our
primary channel for releasing

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.340
Google services on iOS.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:04.640
And what does that mean?

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.830
Well, for starters,
it means adding this

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:06.860
to our documentation.

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:07.502
So, hooray.

00:04:07.502 --> 00:04:08.960
We have documentation
that reflects

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.620
how you work in the real
world, which is great.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.380
It also means that we are going
to be owning and publishing

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.010
these pod spec files
ourselves instead of relying

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.589
on our loyal fans
on the internet

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:21.170
to do that for us, which we
totally appreciate, by the way.

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:24.460
Thank you very much, all of
you loyal fans on the internet.

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.620
We totally dig your
hipster mustache.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:27.457
But you know what?

00:04:27.457 --> 00:04:29.290
This is really work
that we should be doing,

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.292
so we're going to
take care of that.

00:04:31.292 --> 00:04:33.250
This also means,
incidentally, that this is now

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.240
going to be part of
our build process.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.590
So any time we create a new
build of one of our libraries,

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.380
our build tools
will automatically,

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.390
behind the scenes, create
a brand new, up-to-date pod

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:46.700
spec file so that it is fresh
and up-to-date and ready

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.270
to publish as soon as
the library is, which

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.597
means that you won't have
to sit around saying, hey,

00:04:51.597 --> 00:04:53.180
this new library's
been out for weeks.

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:54.610
Who's going to update
the pod spec file?

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:55.859
Who's in charge of this thing?

00:04:55.859 --> 00:04:57.450
Who do I need to bother?

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:01.450
All of this, our new pod spec
file should be ready to go

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:03.730
and published to the world
as soon as our library is,

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:05.362
which is great.

00:05:05.362 --> 00:05:06.820
I do regret to
inform you, however,

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:09.040
that our actual build
process for iOS libraries

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:13.010
does not involve any giant
robot welding arms-- yet.

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:14.380
Working on it.

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.410
We're also adding
support for pod try.

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:21.050
How many of you out there
know what pod try is?

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:22.525
Yeah, fewer of you.

00:05:22.525 --> 00:05:25.690
Pod try, it's a
lesser-known command

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.510
that is now part of CocoaPods.

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.160
And basically, the
way it works is,

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.660
let's say you're interested
in checking out some library,

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:34.580
but you're not ready
to commit to adding it

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.390
to your actual Xcode project
that you're working on.

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:40.510
The way pod try works is I say,
hey, let's pod try a library.

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:43.590
CocoaPods will go out, it will
find that repository out there

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.910
on the internet,
and it will scan it

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:50.810
for anything resembling
an Xcode, an XE Workspace,

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:53.910
or a project file, preferably
in a directory named something

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:55.860
like Demo, for example.

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.740
If it finds it, it will
download everything

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.240
onto a temporary directory
on your hard drive for you

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.620
and run it with an Xcode.

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:03.600
So you can fiddle
around with the code,

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:07.280
make changes, see how the
library interacts with you,

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:12.490
basically try out your example
really easily without having

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:16.540
to do any other work or add it
to your official Xcode project.

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:19.150
So to make this work, we
have started including

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.780
all of our samples in
the very same libraries

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:23.960
that we're supporting
so that, if you

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.150
ask to pod try any of
Google's libraries,

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:27.180
this should just work.

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:30.944
So you should give
pod try a try.

00:06:30.944 --> 00:06:33.110
Another nice benefit of
using CocoaPods, by the way.

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:34.720
This should reduce
a little space.

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.961
In the past, if we had
Library A and Library B,

00:06:36.961 --> 00:06:39.460
then they'd both require another
library to work, like, say,

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:40.600
a logging library.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.670
Typically, we just bundle
everything together

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:46.680
and do some namespace hacking
to avoid dual include errors.

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.340
But it tended to get these
things a little bloated.

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:50.800
But now that we're
using CocoaPods,

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:51.840
we can say, hey, you know what?

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.381
Both of these
libraries, they're just

00:06:53.381 --> 00:06:55.470
going to list this other
library as a dependency

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:57.930
so that no matter how many
of these others you add,

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:00.090
this logging library
will only be added once

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:03.210
to your project, which is nice.

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:06.000
Right now, this official
CocoaPod process

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.482
has been incorporated by
a number of our libraries.

00:07:08.482 --> 00:07:10.190
And we're working with
many of our others

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:13.729
to insure this number grows
in the future, very soon.

00:07:13.729 --> 00:07:15.270
The other part of
the process that we

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:17.540
want to make easier for you
is configuring everything

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:19.300
when you're first
getting started.

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:21.824
There is a lot of power
behind some of these features

00:07:21.824 --> 00:07:23.990
we are building, particularly
when you start delving

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:25.948
into some of the finer
details around something

00:07:25.948 --> 00:07:27.120
like Google Analytics.

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:29.060
But that's also a
lot of detail you

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:31.579
don't necessarily need when
you're just getting started.

00:07:31.579 --> 00:07:33.370
Ideally, you want to
spend the first couple

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:34.870
minutes of your
project saying, hey,

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:36.660
I would like my app
to use all the things,

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:38.100
please give them to me.

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:40.360
And so that's what
our new configuration

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.049
flow is going to focus on.

00:07:42.049 --> 00:07:44.090
Basically, we're going to
give you all the basics

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:46.280
and provide you with
lots of sensible defaults

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:48.655
so that you have what you need
to start building quickly.

00:07:48.655 --> 00:07:50.363
This is probably
something that is better

00:07:50.363 --> 00:07:51.970
demonstrated in
a video, so we're

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:53.660
going to roll the clip here.

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:56.349
Here I'm going to be
creating an iOS project.

00:07:56.349 --> 00:07:58.390
I'm going to be adding a
bunch of services to it.

00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:02.505
I'm going to add Sign-In and
Analytics and AdMob and App

00:08:02.505 --> 00:08:03.080
Invites.

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:05.289
And you'll notice that,
as I go, it might not

00:08:05.289 --> 00:08:06.330
look like I'm doing much.

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:07.950
I'm just clicking a
bunch of + buttons

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:10.300
and clicking a
bunch of OK buttons,

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:13.100
but this tool is doing a lot of
work behind the scenes for me.

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:16.340
For Sign-In, it's creating
an OAuth client ID-- again,

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:18.070
with sensible defaults.

00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:20.020
I can create a new
Google Analytics property

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:22.700
without having to jump to
the Google Analytics page.

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:24.970
And I can also link
up my AdMob account.

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:27.570
Normally, I would have to go to
two or three different screens

00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:29.020
to get all this stuff working.

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:31.000
Now I can do it all
just from one site.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.150
At the end, I also
get the nice lines

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:35.190
that I can copy and
paste into my pod file

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:37.809
so that I can install all the
libraries that I indicated

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:39.250
I was going to use.

00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:41.350
You might also notice
right before this step,

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:44.410
I downloaded an info.plist file.

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:48.260
The way this works is this
new file in conjunction

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.400
with the Google
pod we have built

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.130
will simplify a few more
steps in the process for you.

00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:55.280
So in the past,
usually when you were

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:57.720
done asking to add
Google Analytics

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.964
or add Google Sign-In,
we gave you constants

00:08:59.964 --> 00:09:01.880
that you had to copy and
paste into your code,

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:04.400
like your analytics tracking
tag or your client ID.

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.310
And so on and so forth.

00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:09.080
But now, our library can
simply read those constants out

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:11.770
of the plist file that
we give you to download.

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:13.800
So it saves a couple
of cutting and pasting

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:17.220
steps and some opportunity
for careless error.

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:19.395
So that'll be nice.

00:09:19.395 --> 00:09:21.520
And of course, when you do
need to go in and adjust

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:25.190
your requests per second per
user quota limit for some API

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:27.850
or activate a certain type of
tracking in Google Analytics,

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:31.020
you can all those pages,
all those consoles.

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:33.827
They're all there for you,
but only when you need them.

00:09:33.827 --> 00:09:35.410
Which is probably
not in the first two

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:37.849
minutes of creating a project.

00:09:37.849 --> 00:09:40.390
If you want to see more, you
can check out our newly released

00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:42.950
developers.google.com/ios page.

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:43.700
Yes, that's right.

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:45.310
We now have an
official landing page

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:48.540
in our documentation for iOS
developers, which is nice.

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:51.171
Isn't that nice?

00:09:51.171 --> 00:09:53.290
Yes, it is.

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:55.280
It's great.

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:57.620
So now that I've
explained what we've

00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:02.170
done to make things a little
more streamlined, let me- ah,

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:03.225
go away.

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:08.992
Good thing I had that with me.

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:16.870
I should have practiced
that bit in rehearsal.

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:17.880
Smells like linen.

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:20.680
I'm going to give you a tour of
what we have available for you.

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:23.820
I'm going to cover about 10 of
these services over the next 20

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:26.042
minutes, mostly focusing
on things that are new.

00:10:26.042 --> 00:10:27.750
Hopefully not too much
of this is review.

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:30.100
But for those of you who
are joining us fresh online,

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:31.660
this should be new
for most of you.

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:32.250
So buckle up.

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:32.749
Here we go.

00:10:32.749 --> 00:10:35.260
We're going to cover 10 services
over the next 20 minutes.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:36.250
And we're going
to start with what

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:37.650
we have to make
it easier for you

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:39.920
to develop a more powerful app.

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:41.920
And we're going to
start with Google Maps.

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:42.370
Hey, look at that.

00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:43.869
Moscone Center,
that's where we are.

00:10:43.869 --> 00:10:45.365
How did it know?

00:10:45.365 --> 00:10:46.550
Magic.

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:49.940
So you probably know about
the Google Maps SDK for iOS--

00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:52.190
like, you can add some
super-fantastic, up-to-date,

00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:54.750
accurate maps to your app, you
can add indoor maps in Street

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:56.470
View, which is always fun.

00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:58.940
But most of this you
probably knew already.

00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:02.120
What might be new to you
here is the Places API.

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:05.630
So Google has a massive database
of over 100 million stores

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:07.350
and restaurants and
bars and coffee shops

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:10.540
and theme parks and convention
centers all over the world.

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:12.250
It's a lot of places.

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:14.780
And you can use this
database to let the user

00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:16.951
share where they are with
the meaningful location.

00:11:16.951 --> 00:11:18.950
So instead of my telling
you, hey, why don't you

00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:22.250
join me for a bite to
eat at 37.788204 latitude

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:23.490
and whatever longitude.

00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:25.140
I could tell you, why don't
you join me for a bite to eat

00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:25.840
at Ryoko's?

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.200
And here's the address and
here's a little embedded map,

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:31.820
which I think the engineer is
showing off here in the demo.

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:34.510
The Places API also includes
a few other nice utilities,

00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:37.210
like a picker UI if you don't
feel like building your own,

00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:39.810
where a user can
select their location

00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:43.210
based on a list of locations
near where they are.

00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:45.220
As well as an
auto-complete feature,

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:48.400
because typing proper names
on a phone is still no fun.

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:50.400
So we've had this on
Android for a little while.

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:52.420
You can do this
now on iOS as well.

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:55.650
This is a sneak preview
of a new app from Pixar,

00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:58.130
where users can use the
Places API to choose

00:11:58.130 --> 00:11:59.520
where a photo was taken.

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:02.810
So apparently we had Left Shark
visiting Google Headquarters.

00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:05.870
He's a big deal
from what I hear.

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:07.110
Let's talk about Cast.

00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:09.419
So you know about Chromecast,
the $35 device that

00:12:09.419 --> 00:12:11.460
lets you put all of your
entertainment on your TV

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:14.329
while you use your phone as the
fanciest remote control ever.

00:12:14.329 --> 00:12:16.370
So there's a whole lot of
Cast devices out there.

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:18.600
Did we not 17 million
at the keynote?

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:19.570
17 million sold?

00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:20.910
It's a lot.

00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:23.970
But I do want to clear up two
misconceptions about Cast.

00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:26.340
First off, it's not just for
use with Android devices.

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:29.080
A large number of our users are
controlling their Cast device

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:30.980
with their iPhones as well.

00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:34.090
And second, it's not just for
binge watching superhero shows.

00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:36.330
It is great for that, I do it.

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:39.410
But Cast can also be great
for playing local multiplayer

00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:39.910
games.

00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:41.326
I mean, If you
think about it, you

00:12:41.326 --> 00:12:44.670
have a TV that is perfect
for displaying a common game

00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:46.420
state to everybody in the room.

00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:48.784
And then every person
also has a phone

00:12:48.784 --> 00:12:50.450
that's ideal for
displaying a little bit

00:12:50.450 --> 00:12:52.780
of private information
and entering commands.

00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:54.900
And if you think about
it, this is basically

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:57.520
the ideal set up for something
like a Texas Hold 'Em game.

00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:00.450
But this also pretty much
describes every good board game

00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:01.250
that's out there.

00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:04.220
We think about it, like Scrabble
or Carcass Zone or Settlers

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:07.290
or House on Haunted Hill or
Dominion or any of those.

00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:10.730
Most really good board games
rely on a public game state

00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:12.780
that everybody can see
and then a little bit

00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:15.630
of private information for
each player and a way for them

00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:16.990
to enter commands.

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:19.360
This is something we really
couldn't do until a couple

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:22.040
years ago when everybody had
supercomputers in their pockets

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:24.650
with awesome displays
and a TV that they

00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:26.260
could control with it.

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.410
And so to that end,
the Chromecast team

00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:31.632
has announced the
Game Manager API.

00:13:31.632 --> 00:13:33.090
And it's basically
here to help you

00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:36.284
deal with all the tedious and
boring setup tasks you always

00:13:36.284 --> 00:13:37.700
have to deal with
with multiplayer

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:40.740
games on any platform, frankly--
things like synchronizing

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:42.930
your game state across
devices and creating

00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:45.440
a getting-started lobby and
dealing with people joining

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:47.290
and leaving and figuring
out who the host is

00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:48.790
and a whole lot more.

00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:50.454
I do encourage you
to check it out,

00:13:50.454 --> 00:13:52.120
particularly if you
are a game developer

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:54.161
and you feel like you have
any kind of board game

00:13:54.161 --> 00:13:57.480
or card game or co-op game that
would fit nicely in this model.

00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:59.921
And it is cross-platform--
it works on Android and iOS,

00:13:59.921 --> 00:14:01.670
because it turns out
we like to play games

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:04.820
with friends no matter what
kind of phone they have.

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:07.480
Also new for game developers
is the Cast Remote Display

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:08.960
for Games SDK.

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:11.647
And basically, to explain
how this one works,

00:14:11.647 --> 00:14:13.230
I should probably
explain a little bit

00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:15.860
around how Cast works, in
case you're not familiar.

00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:18.840
Traditionally, the content
that's displayed on your TV

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:21.410
was powered by the
web browser that lives

00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:22.730
on your little Cast device.

00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:24.000
So hi there, fella.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.280
So you might send commands
to it through your phone.

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:28.272
Say, play, pause,
play this movie.

00:14:28.272 --> 00:14:30.355
But in general, if I'm,
say, streaming a movie off

00:14:30.355 --> 00:14:33.447
of Netflix or Hulu, it's the
browser on the Chrome device

00:14:33.447 --> 00:14:34.530
that's doing all the work.

00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:36.000
It's going out
onto the internet,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.125
it's getting this data
stream, it's downloading it,

00:14:38.125 --> 00:14:40.130
it's displaying it on my TV.

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:42.210
So that means while
the movie's going on,

00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:43.960
I can use my phone
for other things.

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:45.460
I don't have to
keep it on this app.

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:49.350
I can switch over and browse
IMDB or check my email.

00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:51.310
Or even-- and you can
do this in a movie,

00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:53.965
folks-- turn off
my device entirely.

00:14:53.965 --> 00:14:56.090
So I don't have to worry
about my phone's attention

00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:59.040
being elsewhere and
my movie stopping.

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:01.320
My Chromecast will
still plug away.

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:04.140
But there are a few times you
do want your phone to power

00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:07.460
the display on your TV and
games are a really good example.

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:09.170
Like, imagine a
racing game where

00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:11.830
you can use your phone with
its tilt sensor like a steering

00:15:11.830 --> 00:15:12.430
wheel.

00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:15.220
And your phone's fancy
Quad Core GPU chip

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:18.960
with a gazillion processors
is powering the game

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.660
on your giant TV screen.

00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:22.080
And so, for these
kinds of cases,

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:26.680
we're introducing the remote
display for Games SDK for Cast.

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:28.930
And this will let your phone
write to your Cast device

00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:32.020
as if it were another
display on the device.

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:34.970
So this is good for
single-player games as well as

00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:35.839
multiplayer games.

00:15:35.839 --> 00:15:38.380
But if you are building any kind
of game and you're thinking,

00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:39.879
gosh, these graphics
sure look nice.

00:15:39.879 --> 00:15:42.199
I bet they'd look really
good on a 50-inch TV screen.

00:15:42.199 --> 00:15:43.740
You should definitely
look into this.

00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:47.210
Again, available
on iOS and Android.

00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:48.919
I'm going to talk
about Tag Manager next.

00:15:48.919 --> 00:15:50.293
This is the only
library where we

00:15:50.293 --> 00:15:52.010
don't have anything
new to announce here,

00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:53.480
but I just really like it.

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:55.380
And I'm the speaker
and so I get to decide

00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:56.957
these sorts of things.

00:15:56.957 --> 00:15:59.040
How many people have used
Tag Manager, by the way?

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:00.940
For anything?

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:03.360
Yeah, a few of you.

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:05.880
Using it in an apps context--
the best way to think of it

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:09.180
is as a way to configure
your app via the cloud.

00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:11.540
So imagine you've
got a game out there

00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:13.540
and it suddenly starts
getting one-star reviews,

00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:15.840
because people aren't
making it past level five.

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:18.460
And you're like oh, no, I
made level 5 way too hard.

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:20.250
Well, one option
would be to create

00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:21.810
a new build with
some new settings

00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:23.380
and get it uploaded
to the App Store

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:25.060
and approved and
sent out to everyone.

00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:27.060
And hopefully they all
download the new version,

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:29.794
but if you had configured your
game using Google Tag Manager,

00:16:29.794 --> 00:16:31.460
you could change the
difficulty settings

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:34.710
and send that right to the cloud
without any of that kerfuffle.

00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:37.320
And the changes would
happen very quickly.

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:39.697
Tag Manager is also
rules-based, which

00:16:39.697 --> 00:16:41.280
means that if people
with older phones

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:43.490
start complaining that your
game is running too slow,

00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:45.823
you could tweak the number
of particles in your particle

00:16:45.823 --> 00:16:48.710
system just for those people
who have older devices.

00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:52.630
Or if you had managed all of
your apps text using Google Tag

00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:54.730
Manager and then you
suddenly figure out

00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:57.220
that your app is
big in Germany, you

00:16:57.220 --> 00:16:59.050
could add an
entirely new language

00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:00.685
on the fly doing
it all on the Cloud

00:17:00.685 --> 00:17:02.810
without having to upload
a new version of your app.

00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:04.650
So it's pretty neat.

00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:05.540
Also kind of neat?

00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:07.097
Tag Manager lets
you run experiments.

00:17:07.097 --> 00:17:08.680
So you could make
your purchase button

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:11.200
say Purchase on half
the devices out there

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.780
and Buy Now on the other half
and see which converts better.

00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:16.490
This is the kind of thing that
giant companies with server

00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:19.210
engineers and business analysts
have been doing for a while,

00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:21.810
but this is also now something
that a two-person shop can

00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:24.025
try out as well thanks to
tools like Tag Manager.

00:17:24.025 --> 00:17:25.650
So there's some really
fun stuff there.

00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:27.601
I encourage you
to give it a look.

00:17:27.601 --> 00:17:29.350
I'm going to talk
briefly about Cardboard,

00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:31.517
but I guess we announced
iOS support at the keynote.

00:17:31.517 --> 00:17:33.016
So most of you have
heard about this

00:17:33.016 --> 00:17:34.600
and took the wind
out of my sails.

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:36.680
So, thanks guys.

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:40.560
But we realized you
can create a nice VR

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:42.400
device using the
powerful GPU and motion

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:43.840
sensors on your phone.

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:45.549
And you know what else
has a powerful GPU

00:17:45.549 --> 00:17:46.923
and sophisticated
motion sensors?

00:17:46.923 --> 00:17:49.140
Not just Android devices,
but iPhone ones as well.

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:51.360
And so there's
really no reason why

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:54.130
you couldn't run Cardboard
apps on an iPhone,

00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:56.260
except that nobody had
written the SDK yet.

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:58.250
And so that's what our team did.

00:17:58.250 --> 00:18:01.090
They have primarily been
focusing on the Unity plug-in

00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:03.090
so that you can take your
Cardboard-enabled game

00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:06.770
from Unity and port it to
iOS as well as to Android.

00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:08.520
I've played with this
plug-in in the past.

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:10.862
This is a terrible
demo game that I made.

00:18:10.862 --> 00:18:11.820
But it is a lot of fun.

00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:13.480
I encourage you to
check it out and see

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:15.688
if there's snippets of your
game that might work well

00:18:15.688 --> 00:18:17.816
as a 3D interactive experience.

00:18:17.816 --> 00:18:19.940
It doesn't have to be your
entire game, by the way.

00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:22.210
One nice thing about Cardboard
is you can take your phone,

00:18:22.210 --> 00:18:24.168
put it in Cardboard, and
then put it out again.

00:18:24.168 --> 00:18:27.277
So if you're making a base
management game and you think,

00:18:27.277 --> 00:18:28.860
gee, it would be
nice if my user could

00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:32.199
explore the base that they built
in a first-person VR setting.

00:18:32.199 --> 00:18:33.740
You could just take
that part and put

00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:35.239
that it into Cardboard
and not worry

00:18:35.239 --> 00:18:38.052
about converting the entire
UI if you don't want to.

00:18:38.052 --> 00:18:39.510
There are a lot of
design decisions

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:42.599
you should be aware of
when designing for VR.

00:18:42.599 --> 00:18:44.140
And also when
designing for Cardboard

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:49.902
versus a more sophisticated,
sensory-replacement VR system.

00:18:49.902 --> 00:18:51.610
Anyway, if you do
think this is something

00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:53.276
you might be interested
in checking out,

00:18:53.276 --> 00:18:54.997
we had a Make Believe session.

00:18:54.997 --> 00:18:56.580
Make Believe is the
name of the title.

00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:57.970
The session existed.

00:18:57.970 --> 00:18:59.750
That was, I think,
earlier today.

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:04.012
And it has been recorded and
put online, so look for that.

00:19:04.012 --> 00:19:05.720
And now to round out
the Develop section.

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:08.030
We're at, I think,
part five of 10.

00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:09.750
Let's talk about Form.

00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:11.526
Who knows about Form?

00:19:11.526 --> 00:19:13.380
All right, a few of you.

00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:16.160
So Form is unique in that
it is not a library that

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:17.580
makes your app better.

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:20.759
It is a tool to help
you build better apps.

00:19:20.759 --> 00:19:23.300
Basically, it's a really cool
prototyping tool from a company

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:25.020
that Google acquired
back in November

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:28.476
and it's perfect for prototyping
animations and interactions.

00:19:28.476 --> 00:19:29.850
So once you're
done sketching out

00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:32.950
how your app is going to look,
you can take it into Form

00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:35.150
and really start
to work on how it's

00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:38.350
going to feel when your
user starts playing with it.

00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:40.730
So all these animations
and interactions

00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:43.770
are designed using these
elements called patches

00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:45.112
in a flow chart like design.

00:19:45.112 --> 00:19:46.570
And the nice thing
is, this doesn't

00:19:46.570 --> 00:19:49.830
require any sort of Xcode
or programming or anything

00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:50.620
like that.

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:53.030
So your designer can
spend their time tweaking

00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:55.510
and tuning these animations
and adding features

00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:58.290
as they go until everything
just feels right,

00:19:58.290 --> 00:20:01.270
while your engineer can spend
their time browsing Hacker News

00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:03.694
or fixing bugs, as time allows.

00:20:03.694 --> 00:20:05.110
And the great thing
about all this

00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:06.810
is feedback is
nearly instantaneous.

00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:10.650
This format runs on your MacBook
and as you're making changes

00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:12.850
to a view's opacity
or its position

00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:15.600
or the dampening value of a
spring or anything like that,

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:18.890
those changes happen
right away on your device

00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:20.330
that's connected to it.

00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:22.180
I mean, you don't even have
to stop and restart the app.

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:23.721
You just get to see
everything happen

00:20:23.721 --> 00:20:25.470
right away, in real time.

00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:28.860
And I find that super-tight
feedback loop is really useful

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:30.810
when you're trying
to zero in on making

00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:32.370
something feel just right.

00:20:32.370 --> 00:20:35.870
It's really fun and useful.

00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:38.321
So the team is going to be
launching version 1.3 very

00:20:38.321 --> 00:20:38.820
soon.

00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:40.870
I believe it's going through
the approval process now.

00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:43.286
But I can give you a sneak
preview of some of the features

00:20:43.286 --> 00:20:45.517
that they're going to be
announcing in version 1.3.

00:20:45.517 --> 00:20:48.100
First up are some new widgets
or patches for you to play with,

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:50.540
as well as an SDK for you
to write your own custom

00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:51.637
patches, which is cool.

00:20:51.637 --> 00:20:53.720
There are going to be
easier ways for you to share

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:55.031
your prototypes with others.

00:20:55.031 --> 00:20:57.280
There are going to be some
new motion curves, new ways

00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:00.330
to get your view from
point A to point B, as well

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:02.800
as a few different
built-in animation timings.

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:06.160
So different variations of
slow-in, fast-out, fast-in,

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:08.180
slow-out, and so
on and so forth,

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:10.620
as well as support for
more material design.

00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:13.590
Things like the card element
or the ripple effect that

00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:15.619
happens when you touch a view.

00:21:15.619 --> 00:21:17.160
And by the way, this
is another thing

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:18.540
not just for Android devices.

00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:21.560
Try adding a little bit of
material design to your app.

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:24.050
We have and I think
it looks pretty good.

00:21:24.050 --> 00:21:27.820
So Form used to cost $80, but
since the acquisition is now

00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:31.610
free, which is a
savings of-- anybody?

00:21:31.610 --> 00:21:33.830
Shout it out.

00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:34.720
Yeah, $80, right.

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:38.780
You win 20 internet points.

00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:40.260
So yeah, that's Form.

00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:42.040
So building a
compelling app is great.

00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:43.050
But let's look at
what you can do

00:21:43.050 --> 00:21:44.350
to keep your users coming back.

00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:46.090
Let's talk a little
about Engagement.

00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:49.180
And first up, new for
iOS is app indexing.

00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:51.940
So the idea behind app indexing
is, there's a lot of you

00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:53.810
out there who have
apps and also have

00:21:53.810 --> 00:21:56.660
websites that closely mirror
the content of those apps.

00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:59.219
Let's say, for instance, you
are a restaurant review site.

00:21:59.219 --> 00:22:01.010
And I'm searching for
donuts in the Mission

00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:02.500
and your site shows up.

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:03.490
So that's great.

00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:05.240
But what happens when
I click on that link

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:06.690
from inside the
Google search app?

00:22:06.690 --> 00:22:08.400
Well, it takes users
to your website

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:09.900
where you're probably
showing me one

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:10.940
of those annoying interstitials.

00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:12.330
So you go and
check out your app.

00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:13.485
Which, I mean, I get it.

00:22:13.485 --> 00:22:15.860
You've built this nice app,
you want to take users to it.

00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:17.482
But I just want my donut info.

00:22:17.482 --> 00:22:18.940
And you're getting
in the way of me

00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:21.950
and my doughnuts and that
makes me hungry and angry.

00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:24.250
It makes me hangry and
you wouldn't like me

00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:25.330
when I'm hangry.

00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:29.650
So to address this issue, we
take advantage of deep links.

00:22:29.650 --> 00:22:31.400
And if you don't know
what deep links are,

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:33.119
they're basically like URLs.

00:22:33.119 --> 00:22:35.410
But unlike a typical one
that, say, points to a website

00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:38.440
out there, these are URLs
that point to your app.

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:40.810
And you can include all
sorts of data within this URL

00:22:40.810 --> 00:22:44.570
so that your app can
interpret it to, for instance,

00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:47.225
point to specific
content within your app.

00:22:47.225 --> 00:22:49.600
So the way this works, the
way you take advantage of this

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:52.120
is-- for every
page on your site,

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:53.710
you would generate
some metadata that

00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:56.430
includes a deep link that
points to that page's content

00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:58.469
in your iOS and Android apps.

00:22:58.469 --> 00:23:00.260
Then the next time
Google crawls your site,

00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:01.676
it makes a note
of these mappings.

00:23:01.676 --> 00:23:04.240
It says, a-ha, this is where
I can find the same content

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:06.280
in your various apps.

00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:08.750
And then the next time I
search for donuts, Google

00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:10.420
will once again
bring up your site.

00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:12.260
But because it knows
that this content now

00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:14.510
exists within your
app, it will instead

00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:17.420
display a deep link that points
directly to your app right

00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:18.800
within the search results.

00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:20.670
And incidentally,
we only show this

00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:22.800
to users who have
your app installed.

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:25.090
So we can still show
your regular web content

00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:28.037
to users who don't and show your
apps content to users who do.

00:23:28.037 --> 00:23:30.120
Either way, your users now
can get to your content

00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:32.552
with one click, which is great.

00:23:32.552 --> 00:23:34.760
App indexing is something
that we started rolling out

00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:37.424
last week to a small
number of people

00:23:37.424 --> 00:23:39.090
with a small number
of initial partners.

00:23:39.090 --> 00:23:43.580
I believe OpenTable, Zillo,
and Pinterest are among them.

00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:45.557
And we are hoping
to expand this as we

00:23:45.557 --> 00:23:47.140
get further feedback
from our partners

00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:49.420
and our users and
everyone is happy.

00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:51.980
So definitely go check
out the documentation.

00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:53.790
There's a place
for you to sign up

00:23:53.790 --> 00:23:56.150
to get invited into
the app invites list.

00:23:56.150 --> 00:23:59.170
So if this sounds like
something that would fit you,

00:23:59.170 --> 00:24:01.110
definitely check it out.

00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:03.690
Also new for iOS is app invites.

00:24:03.690 --> 00:24:05.450
And this is also
in beta right now.

00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:07.054
But this tool
basically gives you

00:24:07.054 --> 00:24:09.470
what you need to create a nice
word-of-mouth experience so

00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:11.690
that users can share your
app with their friends.

00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:13.600
Because as we all
know, word-of-mouth

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:16.290
is a fantastic way for people
to find out about your app.

00:24:16.290 --> 00:24:18.870
It tends to drive more
conversions than anything else

00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:19.630
out there.

00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:21.040
I think we all
know this, but I'm

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:23.206
going to tell you a story
anyway of my friend Kelly.

00:24:23.206 --> 00:24:26.130
This is her, head
not drawn to scale.

00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:27.680
But every Christmas,
my friend Kelly,

00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:30.520
whose sister works for the Gap,
sends me a friends and family

00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:33.790
coupon code for like
a 20%-off discount.

00:24:33.790 --> 00:24:35.524
And I love this thing.

00:24:35.524 --> 00:24:37.190
Every year, I look
forward to it-- like,

00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:38.330
when's Kelly's email?

00:24:38.330 --> 00:24:39.120
When's it going to get here?

00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:40.470
Why hasn't she
sent it to me yet?

00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:41.230
Am I still her friend?

00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:41.860
Oh no, what's happened.

00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:42.690
Oh yay, it's here.

00:24:42.690 --> 00:24:45.470
And then I go off and I
buy five dozen shirts.

00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:49.350
Which is crazy, because if Gap
send me an email for a 20%-off

00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:50.720
sale, I wouldn't even open it.

00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:52.845
I'd be like, whatever,
marketing, blah, blah, blah.

00:24:52.845 --> 00:24:53.770
And I'd archive it.

00:24:53.770 --> 00:24:55.880
But because this is
from a friend of mine,

00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:58.880
this becomes a special event
that I am looking forward to.

00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:01.060
And that's the power
of friend referrals

00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:03.882
and the kind of thing that
can drive users to your app.

00:25:03.882 --> 00:25:05.590
So app invites gives
you a way to harness

00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:06.920
this same kind of energy.

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:09.670
Let's say I'm done
ordering food online

00:25:09.670 --> 00:25:12.990
through this food ordering
app-- a lot of my examples

00:25:12.990 --> 00:25:14.630
are about food, aren't they?

00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:16.620
I should not write
this during lunch.

00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:19.360
Anyway, I have an opportunity
to send a free meal to a friend.

00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:22.060
So app invites
would bring up a UI

00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:24.870
where the user can choose to
send these app invitations

00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:26.200
to any of their friends.

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:29.191
You can send these messages
via SMS or through email.

00:25:29.191 --> 00:25:30.690
We also include
some recommendations

00:25:30.690 --> 00:25:33.860
based on who people who we
think are hungry, I guess.

00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:36.850
And these invitations
come with a URL

00:25:36.850 --> 00:25:39.330
that expands to include
a deep link-- there

00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:42.500
we are with deep links again--
that takes players to your app

00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:44.875
or prompts them to install
it from the App Store.

00:25:44.875 --> 00:25:46.250
Because it's a
deep link, you can

00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:48.370
include whatever
information you want to

00:25:48.370 --> 00:25:50.570
with it, like a discount code.

00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:52.530
So when the user is
done installing your app

00:25:52.530 --> 00:25:54.550
and they open it
up, your app can

00:25:54.550 --> 00:25:56.601
read in that code that
brought users to your app

00:25:56.601 --> 00:25:58.350
in the first place and
say, oh, hey, look.

00:25:58.350 --> 00:26:00.681
Here's that free meal that
your friend Todd sent you.

00:26:00.681 --> 00:26:02.680
Your user is happy because
they have a free meal

00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:04.140
and you're happy because
you have a new customer.

00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:05.450
And everybody wins.

00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:07.500
And this does work
cross-platform.

00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:10.406
So if you were to open that
same link on an Android device,

00:26:10.406 --> 00:26:12.780
we would take users to the
Play Store version of your app

00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:16.200
instead, because
we're smart like that.

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:18.510
So up next, this is
probably the feature

00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:20.320
I am most excited about.

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:22.180
This is Google Cloud
Massaging and this

00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:25.220
is our revolutionary
new-- wait, I'm sorry.

00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:26.940
What?

00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:28.220
Oh.

00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:31.870
I've actually been informed
this is Google Cloud Messaging.

00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:33.200
Still cool.

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:35.560
Kind of wanted the
backrub, but still cool.

00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:37.070
The way Google Cloud
Messaging works

00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:39.260
is, this is our
service that helps

00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:42.690
you send server-generated
notifications to your users.

00:26:42.690 --> 00:26:45.270
So your server
would send a message

00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:48.060
to the Google Cloud
Messaging-- or GCM

00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:49.650
as the kids say-- server.

00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:51.320
And we would really
those notifications

00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:54.490
to your target's Android
device or your Chrome browser.

00:26:54.490 --> 00:26:57.700
But now if you upload your
APNS certificate to us,

00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:01.002
we can send notifications to
their iOS devices as well.

00:27:01.002 --> 00:27:02.710
Which means you could
send a notification

00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:04.950
to any of these
devices or browsers

00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:07.285
with just one call
instead of three somewhat

00:27:07.285 --> 00:27:08.910
different code paths
that all basically

00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:10.180
end up doing the same thing.

00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:12.870
So hopefully, this should make
your life a whole lot easier.

00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:14.530
Also new with Google
Cloud Messaging

00:27:14.530 --> 00:27:16.202
is the idea of topics.

00:27:16.202 --> 00:27:17.910
Basically, the way
this works is your app

00:27:17.910 --> 00:27:21.140
can subscribe to any number of
topics on behalf of your user.

00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:24.450
I think we allow up to
1,000,000 subscriptions per app.

00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:26.520
So let's say, for instance,
you have a sports app

00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:28.480
and I want to be
notified anytime

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:29.710
the Red Sox are playing.

00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:31.229
Well, in the past,
to do this you'd

00:27:31.229 --> 00:27:32.770
probably have to
record my preference

00:27:32.770 --> 00:27:35.747
in a database somewhere and do
this big select-users-where,

00:27:35.747 --> 00:27:38.080
blah, blah, blah query and
then loop through the results

00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:39.970
and then send notifications
to each of those users

00:27:39.970 --> 00:27:42.053
and then the results,
keeping track of what device

00:27:42.053 --> 00:27:44.270
I had so that you could
call the appropriate call.

00:27:44.270 --> 00:27:46.570
Well, with Google
Cloud Messaging,

00:27:46.570 --> 00:27:49.420
basically my device would
just ask the GCM server, hey,

00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:51.880
please subscribe me to
the Boston baseball topic.

00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:54.830
Then you can simply say,
let's send a notification

00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:56.900
to everybody who has
subscribed to this topic.

00:27:56.900 --> 00:27:59.500
And I, along with all the
other Red Sox fans out

00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:01.750
there, would get
notified with one call.

00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:04.514
You don't need that database to
keep track of it all anymore.

00:28:04.514 --> 00:28:05.930
You can throw it
out unless you're

00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:07.013
using it for other things.

00:28:07.013 --> 00:28:10.570
But you don't need to use it
for this anymore, which is nice.

00:28:10.570 --> 00:28:13.270
Google Cloud Messaging also
supports upstream messages,

00:28:13.270 --> 00:28:16.390
which is a lightweight
way for your client

00:28:16.390 --> 00:28:17.890
to communicate to your server.

00:28:17.890 --> 00:28:20.140
And if you're like me and
you're like, well, why would

00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:22.050
you do this instead of just
communicating with your server

00:28:22.050 --> 00:28:22.680
directly?

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:23.860
How does this help you?

00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:26.260
The answer is
basically this allows

00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:30.140
you to support some lightweight
communication from your users

00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:32.670
without your having to
stand up a full-on server

00:28:32.670 --> 00:28:33.842
on the internet.

00:28:33.842 --> 00:28:36.050
I mean, your server in this
case could basically just

00:28:36.050 --> 00:28:38.460
be your laptop running a
little daemon in the background

00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:40.890
that checks GCM
every once in awhile.

00:28:40.890 --> 00:28:44.070
So if you want to get a
little bit of information

00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:46.230
from your users but
think, gosh, a server

00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:47.690
seems like an
awful lot of work--

00:28:47.690 --> 00:28:50.550
look into Google Cloud
Messaging for that.

00:28:50.550 --> 00:28:53.050
So I think we're down to
the last two, but the most

00:28:53.050 --> 00:28:54.841
important two because
they're the ones that

00:28:54.841 --> 00:28:55.700
help you earn money.

00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:59.169
So yes, because there's a point
in every startup founder's life

00:28:59.169 --> 00:29:01.210
when they would like to
stop eating instant ramen

00:29:01.210 --> 00:29:03.750
and start eating
fancy hipster ramen,

00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:05.670
I guess-- which is delicious.

00:29:05.670 --> 00:29:07.990
And I'm on food again,
I've got to stop that.

00:29:07.990 --> 00:29:09.907
So we're going to start
with Google Analytics.

00:29:09.907 --> 00:29:12.156
And honestly, this could
have gone in any of the three

00:29:12.156 --> 00:29:14.790
categories I discussed earlier,
because analytics has basically

00:29:14.790 --> 00:29:17.020
become the lifeblood
of a lot of apps.

00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:19.570
And there's a lot you can
measure with Google Analytics,

00:29:19.570 --> 00:29:21.520
things like how many
new users I have,

00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:23.710
my active users, where
they're coming from,

00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:24.932
what devices they have.

00:29:24.932 --> 00:29:26.640
You can get real-time
analytics, find out

00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:28.473
how many people are
using your app right now

00:29:28.473 --> 00:29:30.030
and what screens they're on.

00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:31.880
We allow screen
flow, so you can see

00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:34.740
what screens or view
controllers your users

00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:36.240
are spending their
time on and how

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:37.720
they get from one to the next.

00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:39.470
It's also possible to
get some really good

00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:42.730
demographic information, like
the age range or the gender

00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:45.072
or the general interests of
the people using your app.

00:29:45.072 --> 00:29:47.155
So you can find out, is
it guys in their 20's that

00:29:47.155 --> 00:29:48.860
are using my app or is
it women in their 50's,

00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:50.360
because depending
on the answer, you

00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:52.552
might want to market it
a little differently.

00:29:52.552 --> 00:29:54.902
You can also measure
funnels towards goals.

00:29:54.902 --> 00:29:57.360
Here, the developer is seeing
how many people are making it

00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:58.840
to the app rating screen.

00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:00.450
And if this were a
multi-step process,

00:30:00.450 --> 00:30:02.840
you could also figure out
where they were dropping out.

00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:04.610
You can track crashes
and exceptions too,

00:30:04.610 --> 00:30:06.270
across different
versions of your app.

00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:09.429
And track all sorts of custom
events that you wanted to find.

00:30:09.429 --> 00:30:11.720
Here, the developer's keeping
track of how often people

00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:14.980
level up in his or her game.

00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:16.620
But one more recent
feature that we

00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:18.078
added that we're
very excited about

00:30:18.078 --> 00:30:20.030
is App Install Attribution.

00:30:20.030 --> 00:30:21.830
So basically,
Google has partnered

00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:24.000
with over 20 different
ad networks out there

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.350
so you can break out a
lot of your user data

00:30:26.350 --> 00:30:28.960
by the ad network that brought
those users to your app

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:30.290
in the first place.

00:30:30.290 --> 00:30:32.960
So what this means is, instead
of going to 20 different ad

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:36.017
network sites and logging in and
looking at clickthrough rates

00:30:36.017 --> 00:30:38.100
and trying to make something
meaningful out of it,

00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:42.182
you can go to Google
Analytics and in one view,

00:30:42.182 --> 00:30:44.640
see important things, like
which ad networks are giving you

00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:46.256
customers who retain best.

00:30:46.256 --> 00:30:47.630
Or even better,
which ad networks

00:30:47.630 --> 00:30:49.880
are giving you the customers
with the highest lifetime

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:50.670
value.

00:30:50.670 --> 00:30:54.340
Probably something that
we'd all be interested in.

00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:56.500
And last but not
least, we've got AdMob.

00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:58.919
I think probably most of
us know what AdMob is,

00:30:58.919 --> 00:31:00.710
but it's the service
that lets you monetize

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:03.190
your app by displaying
banner ads and interstitial

00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:04.160
ads within it.

00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:07.830
This has been available on
iOS for a few years now,

00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:10.290
but there are a few new features
that the team would like

00:31:10.290 --> 00:31:11.610
to make sure I tell you about.

00:31:11.610 --> 00:31:13.510
First up is native ads.

00:31:13.510 --> 00:31:17.400
So this is in limited beta and
we are gradually rolling it out

00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:18.540
to more folks as we go.

00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:21.240
And if you're not familiar with
this concept, basically the way

00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:23.870
this works is, instead of
your just allocating space

00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:26.790
within your view and we
slap a banner on top of it,

00:31:26.790 --> 00:31:29.410
you would work with
AdMob to specify

00:31:29.410 --> 00:31:32.310
how you would like to style the
ads so that it better fits in

00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:33.860
with your app's look and feel.

00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:36.130
We can give you an ad
that fits your style

00:31:36.130 --> 00:31:38.870
without making some brand
manager somewhere freak out.

00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:40.350
So they get an ad
they still like,

00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:42.141
you get an ad that fits
in a little better,

00:31:42.141 --> 00:31:43.069
and everybody's happy.

00:31:43.069 --> 00:31:45.610
This is really good for ads that
have more of a distinct look

00:31:45.610 --> 00:31:46.111
and feel.

00:31:46.111 --> 00:31:48.610
You can get your ads to feel
like they're a little more part

00:31:48.610 --> 00:31:49.520
of the experience.

00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:52.130
I believe Atari recently added
this to their Roller Coaster

00:31:52.130 --> 00:31:53.990
Tycoon game.

00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:55.066
It's still clearly an ad.

00:31:55.066 --> 00:31:56.690
We don't want to kind
of trick anybody.

00:31:56.690 --> 00:31:59.320
But at the same time, this
is a little more built

00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:02.120
into the experience than if we
just had an ad banner pop up

00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:04.700
from the bottom of the screen.

00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:07.110
The other new feature that
I think is really cool

00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:07.965
is Audience Builder.

00:32:07.965 --> 00:32:09.340
And this is what
happens when you

00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:11.250
add the power of
Google Analytics

00:32:11.250 --> 00:32:12.980
to your ads powered by AdMob.

00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:15.420
It's a really great way
of getting the right ads

00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:16.920
to the right people.

00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:18.440
For example, I think
it's well known

00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:21.190
that in a freemium game
with microtransactions,

00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:23.360
a large number of your
audience is never going

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:25.092
to buy anything, which is sad.

00:32:25.092 --> 00:32:26.550
And you're thinking,
gosh, I'd sure

00:32:26.550 --> 00:32:28.420
like to monetize all
these other people.

00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:30.045
But you're worried
that if you bring up

00:32:30.045 --> 00:32:32.650
something like an
interstitial ad with video,

00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:35.385
that might add just friction
that it might turn off

00:32:35.385 --> 00:32:36.010
a buyer or two.

00:32:36.010 --> 00:32:37.450
And you don't want to do that.

00:32:37.450 --> 00:32:39.590
Well, with Audience
Builder, you could say, hey,

00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:42.410
let's only show these video
interstitial ads to the people

00:32:42.410 --> 00:32:43.717
who haven't bought anything.

00:32:43.717 --> 00:32:46.050
And for those people that
have bought stuff, well, maybe

00:32:46.050 --> 00:32:48.320
you could show them a banner
ad for an in-game item--

00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:50.550
or show them nothing at all.

00:32:50.550 --> 00:32:53.200
It's up to you, use the strategy
that you feel would work best.

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:55.420
But we could get even
crazier than this.

00:32:55.420 --> 00:32:58.610
We could say, hey, maybe I want
to show an ad for a power-up.

00:32:58.610 --> 00:33:01.390
But it doesn't make sense
to show this to everybody.

00:33:01.390 --> 00:33:02.890
You only want to
show it, let's say,

00:33:02.890 --> 00:33:04.973
to the people who have
made it past the first five

00:33:04.973 --> 00:33:06.009
tutorial levels.

00:33:06.009 --> 00:33:07.425
And maybe you also
want to show it

00:33:07.425 --> 00:33:09.280
to people who have had to
restart a level more than three

00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:10.000
times.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.990
These people, they're
getting frustrated.

00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:13.990
They would probably really
appreciate this power

00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:14.780
that you're selling.

00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:16.321
So now you suddenly
have an ad that's

00:33:16.321 --> 00:33:18.470
much more relevant
to these people.

00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:21.630
And we're getting the right
ad to the right people.

00:33:21.630 --> 00:33:24.020
Or let's say, I've
got some players

00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:26.880
that are really competitive
in the player-vs-player stuff.

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:29.896
Well, I'm going to show them
ads for more in-game weapons.

00:33:29.896 --> 00:33:31.270
But for my players
who are really

00:33:31.270 --> 00:33:33.510
into spending their time
dressing up their avatar,

00:33:33.510 --> 00:33:37.070
I can show them house ads
for more awesome hats.

00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:38.880
It's all about
getting the right ads

00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:40.927
to the people who
really appreciate it.

00:33:40.927 --> 00:33:43.010
And there's a lot more,
more than I could probably

00:33:43.010 --> 00:33:43.987
cover in this talk.

00:33:43.987 --> 00:33:45.820
But this is some of the
crazy, awesome power

00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:48.690
you get when you combine
Google Analytics with AdMob.

00:33:48.690 --> 00:33:50.280
So we did it.

00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:53.130
Yes, runner, that was
a lot of libraries.

00:33:53.130 --> 00:33:55.380
So I want to circle back to
the whole reason I'm here.

00:33:55.380 --> 00:33:58.540
Once I explain that, yes,
Google does do a lot on iOS,

00:33:58.540 --> 00:34:01.422
often the next question
I get is, well, why?

00:34:01.422 --> 00:34:03.190
Why would Google
spend any time at all

00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:06.180
on providing services that
make apps better for iOS?

00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:07.870
And the answer is
that-- again, this

00:34:07.870 --> 00:34:09.630
isn't really about
Android versus iOS,

00:34:09.630 --> 00:34:11.750
as much as the press
would like you to believe.

00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:14.370
This whole conference is
really about all of you,

00:34:14.370 --> 00:34:16.020
the developers.

00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:18.340
And so, yes, there has a
lot of Android M and Wear

00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:19.465
and whatever announcements.

00:34:19.465 --> 00:34:21.925
But at the end of the day, I/O
is our developer conference.

00:34:21.925 --> 00:34:23.466
And It's about
celebrating the people

00:34:23.466 --> 00:34:26.524
in this room and everybody
online-- hi, online folks-- who

00:34:26.524 --> 00:34:28.440
are using Google services
to power their apps.

00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:30.460
And we want to make
this experience great.

00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:31.860
And that starts
with building out

00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:33.560
the cross platform part of it.

00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:35.880
Nobody is really that
excited about implementing

00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:38.310
two entirely different sets
of services to make their app

00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:41.000
do the exact same thing on
two different platforms.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:41.790
I'm not.

00:34:41.790 --> 00:34:43.810
And if we can do that
while also making

00:34:43.810 --> 00:34:46.610
the process a little more
streamlined-- no, you go back.

00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:54.478
If we can do that while making
the process more streamlined,

00:34:54.478 --> 00:34:56.519
we can not only give your
app a really great head

00:34:56.519 --> 00:34:59.340
start in the world, but we can
make building it even somewhat

00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:00.610
delightful.

00:35:00.610 --> 00:35:02.620
That said, we're
not quite there yet.

00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:04.940
We do recognize we're
really just getting started.

00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:06.740
And there's a lot more
I think we could do

00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:07.970
and I'm hoping that
I will have more

00:35:07.970 --> 00:35:09.761
to share with you over
the next few months.

00:35:09.761 --> 00:35:11.131
Otherwise, I'm out of a job.

00:35:11.131 --> 00:35:12.630
But in the meantime,
I encourage you

00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:14.140
to check out our documentation.

00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:17.770
Give our new configuration flow
a try-- it is awfully neat.

00:35:17.770 --> 00:35:20.590
Also, shameless plug-- I have
a show in our Google Developers

00:35:20.590 --> 00:35:22.476
channel called Route 85.

00:35:22.476 --> 00:35:25.515
Hey, look-- apparently
I only own one shirt.

00:35:25.515 --> 00:35:26.515
You should check it out.

00:35:30.570 --> 00:35:33.856
Google needs to pay me more
so I can buy a second shirt.

00:35:33.856 --> 00:35:37.240
It is chock-full of iOS info,
including a really fun video

00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:40.720
that we just released a half
an hour ago that talks all

00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:42.584
about CocoaPods in more detail.

00:35:42.584 --> 00:35:44.750
And if you can figure out
where the title came from,

00:35:44.750 --> 00:35:46.990
you win 30 more internet points.

00:35:46.990 --> 00:35:48.689
So thank you so much for coming.

00:35:48.689 --> 00:35:50.230
And now if you'll
excuse me, I really

00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:51.855
need to get back to
eating some snacks.

00:36:01.570 --> 00:36:03.140
We do have some
time for questions,

00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:04.800
but I'll be honest--
I'm still learning

00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:05.925
a lot of this stuff myself.

00:36:05.925 --> 00:36:07.860
So my answer will
probably be, I don't know

00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:09.135
or it's my first day.

00:36:11.930 --> 00:36:14.680
All right, you can
just talk to me after.
