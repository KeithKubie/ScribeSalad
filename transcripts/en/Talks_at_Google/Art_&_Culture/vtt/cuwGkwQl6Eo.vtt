[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.871 --> 00:00:07.620
SHRIYA RAGHUNATHAN:
Today, we have with us

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.950
Pandit Birju Maharaj, who is
the greatest living exponent

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.770
of Kathak classical dance.

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:18.300
And he's the recipient of the
Sangeet Natak Akademi Award,

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.280
as well as the Padma
Vibhushan award awarded

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.170
by the government of India.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.720
And he's from the Kalka-Bindadin
lineage of Kathak dancers.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.560
And he is here for
a very special event

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.260
called Paramapara, which
is a concert happening

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.830
with the other Padma Vibhushan
winner, Ustad Zakir Hussain,

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.330
as well as his family.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:40.810
He's here with his sons and
his grandchildren to perform.

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.710
And so we're in celebration
of his 80th birthday.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.961
So happy birthday, Maharaj-ji.

00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:46.293
PANDIT BIRJU MAHARAJ: Thank you.

00:00:46.293 --> 00:00:46.968
Thank you.

00:00:46.968 --> 00:00:50.454
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:51.244 --> 00:00:53.660
SHRIYA RAGHUNATHAN: So could
you tell us a little bit more

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.055
about what inspired
you to go into Kathak?

00:00:57.055 --> 00:00:58.430
PANDIT BIRJU
MAHARAJ: Actually, I

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.280
belong to that
family who belonged

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.970
about six, seven generations.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.340
So I'm seventh, and
my son is eighth,

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.320
and my granddaughter is ninth.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.790
So everybody is getting Kathak.

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.770
And they are learning
and performing.

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.470
I am so happy.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.610
And here, we perform
together every numbers.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.260
So first time aboard we are
going to perform together.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:25.199
So I'm happy.

00:01:25.199 --> 00:01:26.240
SHRIYA RAGHUNATHAN: Yeah.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.370
That is an incredible,
incredible experience

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.510
to perform with your own family
and to share that with them.

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.850
I know that I've heard
that you learned Kathak

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.197
from your father and your uncle.

00:01:36.197 --> 00:01:37.280
PANDIT BIRJU MAHARAJ: Yes.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.290
My father, Acchan Maharaj.

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.620
But the real [INAUDIBLE]
the Jagannath Prasad.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.450
But he was very good,
so good natured.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.020
So [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.820
So it was like this.

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:53.360
Yes.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.010
And my uncle, Shambhu
Maharaj, and Lachhu Maharaj.

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.400
Lachhu Maharaj was in Bombay
film dance [INAUDIBLE]..

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.900
Many, many films--
"Mughal-e-Azam,"

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.000
"Teesri Kasam"-- many, many.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.270
And Shambhu Maharaj
was with me in Delhi.

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:15.240
He was teaching scholarship,
all those classes.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.970
And I also was to get it.

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.560
And I was teaching it.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.200
The first, I start to
teach the small one.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.870
Then after some time, the big.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.852
All the older girls and
boys came in my classes.

00:02:27.852 --> 00:02:29.310
SHRIYA RAGHUNATHAN:
That's amazing.

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.690
And what is one of the
greatest lessons you've taken

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.214
from your father about Kathak?

00:02:34.214 --> 00:02:35.880
PANDIT BIRJU MAHARAJ:
He was very happy,

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.180
because when I was very
young and my mother always

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.512
forced to my father, you
take your son with you.

00:02:45.512 --> 00:02:46.970
And he was a little,
sometimes, no.

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.120
[CLICKS TONGUE] Yeah.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.895
I was asking [INAUDIBLE],, I was
asking chocolate or something.

00:02:54.895 --> 00:02:56.510
It's [INAUDIBLE] that.

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.320
But my mother forced, always
you take him with you.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.290
At least he will see
your performance,

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.360
and he will learn something.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.760
So always in Calcutta,
Bombay, Delhi,

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.935
many, many places when I
was only eight and a half.

00:03:11.935 --> 00:03:12.650
And I dance.

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.920
You can't believe that
I danced when I was six.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.670
I danced in Rampur stage.

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.470
In UP, that is the only stage.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.891
I danced when I was six.

00:03:24.891 --> 00:03:26.390
I don't know the
fingers or nothing,

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.043
but I was just doing like this.

00:03:28.043 --> 00:03:28.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.000
So I did that.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.880
And [? Nawabs ?] was very happy
to see me and just call him

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.950
to me and sitting on here.

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.810
And so much love from him.

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.030
And 11 rupees month I would
get in that time, you know?

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.676
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:45.676 --> 00:03:47.530
SUSHRI SASWATI SEN: Salary.

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:48.340
Salary.

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.230
PANDIT BIRJU
MAHARAJ: Salary, yes.

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.440
And my father was
there about 35 years.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.220
Lucknow and Rampur,
Lucknow, Rampur, like this.

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.560
SHRIYA RAGHUNATHAN:
And in your family,

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.210
as you've learned about
Kathak over the years,

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:07.460
there's such a difference
in each of the gharanas

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:08.990
and how they teach.

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:11.740
And in the Lucknow gharana,
it's extremely famous

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:14.400
for [NON-ENGLISH] and
how they've brought that.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.700
So how do you bridge the
worlds of [NON-ENGLISH]

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.909
and [NON-ENGLISH] and bringing
the technical with the emotion?

00:04:22.715 --> 00:04:24.340
PANDIT BIRJU MAHARAJ:
I belong Lucknow.

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.200
And my [? Nawab ?] was
[NON-ENGLISH],, was very--

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.330
he was writing [NON-ENGLISH]
and hymns there.

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:37.740
And he likes my
grandfather's [NON-ENGLISH]

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.930
and [NON-ENGLISH],,
but everything.

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.340
But [INAUDIBLE] but doing the
Krishna and [NON-ENGLISH]..

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.130
And while I was thinking,
he's like Krishna.

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:47.960
And all the [INAUDIBLE] go be.

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.100
Like something, something.

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:50.810
Very interesting, yes.

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.690
So that time, my
great grandfather--

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:57.260
great grandfather, Thakur
Prasad, [INAUDIBLE],,

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:01.010
he came to Lucknow and
popular in Lucknow.

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:06.860
So always in the
court, court dancer.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.190
But every year in Lucknow, there
was one temple of [? barrow, ?]

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:12.590
[? barrowji. ?]

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.850
That day, my grandfather was
performing for normal people

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:20.230
who is just a small worker.

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:23.210
I mean, everybody can see you.

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:27.180
But otherwise, nobody
can see other time.

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.140
Not a court dancer, anyway.

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:34.910
So those were horse, four
horse, and this, and buggy.

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:38.990
And 4% of us coming to
take my grandfather,

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:40.750
and grandfather was going to--

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:43.880
in the court, like this.

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:49.340
So from the beginning, my father
liked the rhythms in my mind.

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:52.510
From the beginning,
when I was young,

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:55.550
and I was just doing the
[NON-ENGLISH],, tap tap tap,

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:57.240
but not proper way.

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.800
But I was playing.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:03.690
Then my father would
know, in this boy,

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:05.780
there is a rhythm centered.

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:09.380
And Lucknow especially,
there is a very--

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:16.100
[NON-ENGLISH]---- so everything
to see the beauty, the beauty.

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:20.820
So actually, the turn of
the wrist and the finger,

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:25.080
how the pinkies would come, and
the neck, how to move the neck,

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.930
not to jerk and nothing, no.

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:29.450
So the beauty of Kathak, how--

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:31.170
as much we can--

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:31.670
do.

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:33.330
And still now, I'm trying that.

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:34.334
Still now.

00:06:34.334 --> 00:06:36.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:38.420
SHRIYA RAGHUNATHAN:
And there's so much.

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:40.640
We've seen so many
of your performances.

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:43.820
I'm sure everyone in this
audience are such big fans.

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:47.550
Could you give us a demo, you
and [? Saswati, ?] to show us

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:49.705
a [NON-ENGLISH] or--

00:06:49.705 --> 00:06:51.205
PANDIT BIRJU MAHARAJ:
Yes, yes sure.

00:06:51.205 --> 00:06:54.650
Saswati can tell something,
because she's with me, well,

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:58.042
from 50 years,
more than 50 years.

00:06:58.042 --> 00:06:59.750
SUSHRI SASWATI SEN:
And applaud for that.

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:02.050
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:03.830
Yes, it is my pride.

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:07.820
And the pride is
because God is great.

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:12.620
He has given me that
strength of endurance

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:17.960
and that passion that I have
not tired out of learning.

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.870
Another 50 years,
also, I think my thirst

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:25.490
will be as it was on the
first day of my learning.

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:31.280
And that unbroken link with the
guru is a blessing from heaven.

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:35.270
So I really am so
happy and so privileged

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:40.617
that I can serve the art
under the guidance of my guru.

00:07:40.617 --> 00:07:42.200
SHRIYA RAGHUNATHAN:
That's incredible.

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:46.340
So would you want to show us
a demo of a [NON-ENGLISH]??

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:48.260
SUSHRI SASWATI SEN: Yes.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:53.980
I won't tire of saying
volumes about my guru, my art,

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:59.510
more so because I just
came into this profession.

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:02.390
I don't know from
it was destiny.

00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:06.380
I belong to a family of
doctors, everyone in my family.

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:11.160
And as a child, I was made
to believe that I would also

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:14.120
follow the same tradition.

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:16.570
I was studying medicine

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:20.020
But as a little girl, I had
started learning dance just

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:21.160
as a hobby.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:26.560
Not from him, because he did not
teach young ones, little ones.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:30.580
But I was trained under a
teacher who was a student

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:35.559
of his father in [? atka, ?]
so it was the same tradition.

00:08:35.559 --> 00:08:37.900
And then when I received
the national scholarship

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:41.140
from the government
of India, then

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:45.040
that was the first
time when I realized,

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:48.810
because I was
forced to go to see

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:52.390
a professional guru,
professional training,

00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:54.040
not as a hobby.

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:57.820
But still, somehow,
my parents never

00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:01.750
thought that this would
become an earning for me.

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:06.580
I mean, this wouldn't mean
bread and butter for me,

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:08.860
nor did I look at it like that.

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:14.650
So luckily, I'm happy, in
a way, that, in those days,

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:17.770
we learned art for
the art's sake,

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:22.270
not for any vested interest,
not for becoming something,

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:26.800
not for making any
popularity of oneself.

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.510
It's like you need to study.

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:32.770
You need to learn an art
form for your soul and heart

00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:36.260
and your mind, your joy.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.380
So there was no push.

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:40.990
I was very slowly moving.

00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:45.520
And I really came into a
professional career very late

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:51.610
in life quite unwillingly
against my father's wishes,

00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:53.740
who wanted to see
me as a doctor.

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:57.100
I was not happy, though.

00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:05.290
So I think when I was
20-plus or maybe 24, 25,

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:12.160
that was when I started doing my
first paid performances, which

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:15.970
didn't make me a professional
but at least more seriously

00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:19.710
into the art, into the line.

00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:25.030
And then gradually, one or two
of my performances in Delhi

00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:27.910
were very much talked about.

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:30.220
And people thought so.

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:33.050
My director and
Maharaj-ji and everyone

00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:36.860
explained to my
father and my family.

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:38.560
When I started
really speaking, I

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:41.860
think people would love
to know those times.

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:45.130
I started learning
in the late '50s.

00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:49.390
I'm 65 now, 65 years old.

00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:54.040
But I started when I
was six years or so.

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:56.740
At that time, there
was still a taboo,

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:58.990
and there were
still reservations

00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:01.480
about anyone and
everyone learning

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:06.130
dance, and more so
with women, with girls

00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:09.880
coming from decent
families did not usually--

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:11.860
and even if they
learned, it was only

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:17.620
until a certain age and not in
a professional, serious way.

00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:21.730
When I finished college and
then, of course, I came back,

00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:24.400
I did not complete my
medical studies two years.

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:27.940
And then I came back to Delhi.

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:32.620
Even until that time, when I
was in college, our friends,

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:36.370
especially the boys
around me, said,

00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:39.870
what is all this [NON-ENGLISH]
you are doing every day?

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:42.480
What is it every day
you're going to class,

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:43.990
every day you are learning?

00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:46.790
What is there to
learn every day?

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:48.170
And I used to fight with them.

00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:51.070
But what I want to
make a point is,

00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:53.470
those days were very different.

00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:55.960
To get a performance,
in Delhi, also--

00:11:55.960 --> 00:12:00.220
I think Maharaj-ji and
maybe [NON-ENGLISH] from

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:03.440
the [? baratmatam ?]
school, and a little later,

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:05.560
[? Sonam-ji ?]
from [INAUDIBLE]----

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:07.030
I mean, in a year,
there would be

00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:11.480
maybe one or dance performances
all through the year in Delhi.

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:16.450
So as youngsters, no one
had any scope at all.

00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:20.020
The scenario has changed
so much, so much, and so

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:23.950
fast in the last 25, 30 years.

00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:27.340
Every household
thinks that, yes,

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:32.740
the child should learn some
sort of music or dance.

00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:37.150
So quantitatively,
it has grown a lot,

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:40.220
thanks to people like
Maharaj-ji, Shambhu Maharaj-ji,

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:46.020
who were teaching in Delhi and
Maharaj-ji's outlook towards

00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:49.965
a modern way of
looking at Kathak,

00:12:49.965 --> 00:12:52.410
modern way of seeing rhythm--

00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:55.700
seeing rhythm, not only hearing.

00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:57.930
And I will let Maharaj-ji--

00:12:57.930 --> 00:13:01.790
I will request Maharaj-ji
to define my statement how

00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:05.550
one can see rhythm through
nature, through creatures

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:08.220
around us, through
games, through people,

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:10.230
through interaction of friends.

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:12.780
Everywhere, he sees rhythm.

00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:16.740
And how beautiful
he has made hundreds

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:21.330
of such rhythmic
patterns so the audiences

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:24.750
understand and relate
to it more easily.

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:30.750
Going back to [NON-ENGLISH],,
unless an audience understands

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:34.620
a little bit and shares a little
bit of what is going on stage,

00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:37.450
it'll be [NON-ENGLISH]
for them, also.

00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:41.100
And 15 minutes, 20
minutes, and then they

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:43.660
will think it's repetitive.

00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:47.340
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]-- lines.

00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:50.550
The same lines 15, 20
minutes, and that's

00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:53.910
it, unless there is
a subjective change

00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:58.080
and a variety and a
meaningful interpretation.

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:02.430
And that really is because
of Maharaj-ji, the way

00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:04.560
he has seen rhythm.

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:11.074
Maharaj-ji, [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
nature, creatures?

00:14:11.074 --> 00:14:12.990
PANDIT BIRJU MAHARAJ:
So the first thing I do,

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:16.170
that [NON-ENGLISH], the beauty.

00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:22.600
And still, I'm doing
about that mood.

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:24.540
And before long time,
I was just dancing.

00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:28.920
And everybody likes me.

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:33.090
But I could not think so deep
is the Kathak behind the Kathak.

00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:38.610
So many thoughts can come.

00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:42.270
Then I could find, after
25 years-- when I was 25--

00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:45.260
then it is started.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:48.600
And I could see
that in the nature,

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:51.620
everything is dance and music.

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:54.160
The tree is moving.

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:57.100
The branches and the
leaves are moving.

00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:03.980
When the air is coming,
the whole tree is moving.

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:06.200
And the deer.

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:09.510
This is the rhythm, the
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]..

00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:12.600
I just think, they
speak how to jump.

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:14.730
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:17.250
The line is coming
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]..

00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:23.880
So all the nature, you
know, the air is dancing.

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:25.020
Art is dancing.

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:26.220
[INAUDIBLE] is dancing.

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:27.930
All the [INAUDIBLE] dancing.

00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:30.310
So everything is dancing.

00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:34.530
And my old god,
Krishna, was a dancer.

00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:35.850
Shiva was dancer.

00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:38.350
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:42.926
So everybody, [NON-ENGLISH],,
musician, dancers.

00:15:42.926 --> 00:15:45.662
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:45.662 --> 00:15:51.402
So one [NON-ENGLISH] I tell--

00:15:51.402 --> 00:15:53.270
this is the bird is
coming and giving

00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:57.840
the food to the small one.

00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:58.780
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:02.277
SUSHRI SASWATI SEN:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:16:02.277 --> 00:16:04.480
PANDIT BIRJU MAHARAJ:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Always is

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:05.240
the counting.

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:05.920
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:34.850
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] You
could know only the numbers.

00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:39.485
But I could see a bird, how
the bird is coming, flying

00:16:39.485 --> 00:16:43.509
and coming, and there's the
small one, giving the food.

00:16:43.509 --> 00:16:44.800
SUSHRI SASWATI SEN: Baby birds.

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:45.220
PANDIT BIRJU MAHARAJ: Uh-huh.

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:46.220
So [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:49.720
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:17:03.064 --> 00:17:11.934
BOTH: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:17:11.934 --> 00:17:13.850
PANDIT BIRJU MAHARAJ: I
could see the number--

00:17:13.850 --> 00:17:17.140
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:18.134 --> 00:17:21.678
I used the [NON-ENGLISH]
like the wing, you know?

00:17:21.678 --> 00:17:23.220
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:24.050
You know.

00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:30.380
This the wing from the
neck, the movement of.

00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:32.870
So [NON-ENGLISH].

00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:35.960
So I could see many, many
things [NON-ENGLISH]..

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:38.770
But I did all the phone numbers
in my [INAUDIBLE],, you know?

00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:39.890
Doctor's phone number.

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:41.270
Always.

00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:44.770
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:45.920
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:47.970
But it is of two friends.

00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:50.900
One is very lazy
one is very active.

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:54.080
That's two moods.

00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:56.640
In my language,
the dance language.

00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:00.580
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:02.574
Number one,
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]..

00:18:33.596 --> 00:18:34.595
SHRIYA RAGHUNATHAN: Wow.

00:18:34.595 --> 00:18:37.385
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:37.385 --> 00:18:40.790
SUSHRI SASWATI SEN: Two moods
of lazy and active, just through

00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:43.520
rhythmic bols.

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:46.370
Umpteen number of things
he has made for children,

00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:51.620
for addition, subtraction, to
give them that interest in,

00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:53.030
because they learn in school.

00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:58.070
Then if they do the same through
dance, they connect it better

00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:59.840
and enjoy it better.

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:04.670
So every aspect, rhythm of the
universe, everything, my ideas.

00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:06.140
We're two friends
coming together

00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:07.110
looking for each other.

00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:09.151
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:19:09.151 --> 00:19:10.900
PANDIT BIRJU MAHARAJ:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:13.610
SUSHRI SASWATI SEN: Two
friends get lost and then find

00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:14.940
each other and move together.

00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:15.565
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:19:15.565 --> 00:19:18.174
PANDIT BIRJU MAHARAJ:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:19:18.174 --> 00:19:19.840
SUSHRI SASWATI SEN:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:21.035
PANDIT BIRJU MAHARAJ:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:19:21.035 --> 00:19:22.540
SUSHRI SASWATI SEN:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:23.630
PANDIT BIRJU MAHARAJ:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:24.835
SUSHRI SASWATI SEN:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:19:24.835 --> 00:19:25.790
PANDIT BIRJU MAHARAJ:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:26.900
SUSHRI SASWATI SEN:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:28.250
PANDIT BIRJU MAHARAJ:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:29.090
SUSHRI SASWATI SEN:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:29.870
PANDIT BIRJU MAHARAJ:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:30.630
SUSHRI SASWATI SEN:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:32.380
PANDIT BIRJU MAHARAJ:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:41.038
BOTH: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:19:41.038 --> 00:19:42.990
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:45.680
SUSHRI SASWATI SEN: So it's
just the distance, search,

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:48.110
come close, and then move
towards the same goal.

00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:51.200
PANDIT BIRJU MAHARAJ: So
many things like this.

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:54.460
And all the language, I
think, there is the rhythm.

00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:57.950
If you are taking
correct time words,

00:19:57.950 --> 00:20:00.115
then the meaning will be so.

00:20:00.115 --> 00:20:08.600
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:10.080
SUSHRI SASWATI
SEN: Yeah, it's a--

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:10.670
SHRIYA RAGHUNATHAN:
Cilantro, yeah.

00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:11.520
SUSHRI SASWATI SEN: Spice.

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:11.740
SHRIYA RAGHUNATHAN: Yeah.

00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:12.392
[NON-ENGLISH]

00:20:12.392 --> 00:20:14.600
PANDIT BIRJU MAHARAJ: But
[NON-ENGLISH],, if you say,

00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:17.177
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]--

00:20:17.177 --> 00:20:19.260
SUSHRI SASWATI SEN: Then
no one cannot understand,

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:21.500
because you break a word--

00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:26.250
if you don't speak in the
right speed or the chant of it,

00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:27.470
then it doesn't make sense.

00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:30.590
PANDIT BIRJU MAHARAJ: If you
say together [NON-ENGLISH],, OK.

00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:31.750
But if you [NON-ENGLISH].

00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:36.530
The meaning is changed.

00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:39.590
So like this, I think all
the language has the rhythm

00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:42.110
to say the words.

00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:45.476
And many, many things.

00:20:45.476 --> 00:20:46.920
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:51.692
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:51.692 --> 00:20:52.733
PANDIT BIRJU MAHARAJ: Hm?

00:20:52.733 --> 00:20:54.480
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:56.730
PANDIT BIRJU MAHARAJ: Yes.

00:20:56.730 --> 00:20:59.250
Child, young, and old.

00:20:59.250 --> 00:21:00.390
SUSHRI SASWATI SEN: Old.

00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:01.765
PANDIT BIRJU
MAHARAJ: The rhythm.

00:21:01.765 --> 00:21:03.810
SUSHRI SASWATI SEN:
Just three counts.

00:21:03.810 --> 00:21:05.560
PANDIT BIRJU MAHARAJ:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:08.113
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:15.020
Especially for the art, we have
the very particular time cycle.

00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:19.410
And you have to all the things,
like the canvas, if there is.

00:21:19.410 --> 00:21:20.810
You can't go out.

00:21:20.810 --> 00:21:23.460
You have to-- in the canvas.

00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:27.051
If you are a painter, then
you have to be there, not out.

00:21:27.051 --> 00:21:28.800
Like this, the
[NON-ENGLISH] is like this.

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:30.696
SUSHRI SASWATI SEN: Our
rhythm is the canvas.

00:21:30.696 --> 00:21:32.820
PANDIT BIRJU MAHARAJ: My
[NON-ENGLISH] is a canvas.

00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:35.626
And you have to make
everything in there.

00:21:35.626 --> 00:21:38.244
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:21:38.244 --> 00:21:39.910
SUSHRI SASWATI SEN:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:51.806
PANDIT BIRJU MAHARAJ:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:21:51.806 --> 00:21:54.954
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:55.454 --> 00:21:58.780
By this beat, you can
say, [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]..

00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:12.400
In three lines, all the life,
how the young [INAUDIBLE] old.

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:15.079
So I can see
everywhere, you know.

00:22:15.079 --> 00:22:17.120
SHRIYA RAGHUNATHAN: That's
absolutely incredible.

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:18.730
And I think it's
one of the things

00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:21.460
that you're so renowned
for, the way you've

00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:24.760
taken Kathak as a traditional,
classical art form

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:27.770
and made it understandable
to millions, right?

00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:29.550
You've brought it to America.

00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:32.120
You've brought it
worldwide, globally.

00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:34.929
So what brought
you to that, right?

00:22:34.929 --> 00:22:36.970
How did you take Kathak,
which is so traditional,

00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:41.170
and turn it into translating
it, to seeing rhythm everywhere,

00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:42.060
as you described?

00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:44.510
SUSHRI SASWATI SEN: That
would be my question, also.

00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:49.540
How and when and why did
you think of doing this,

00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:51.790
taking nature as your media?

00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:53.960
And [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:01.576
PANDIT BIRJU MAHARAJ: Few years
before, it came to my mind.

00:23:01.576 --> 00:23:03.950
SUSHRI SASWATI SEN: You're
meaning at least 20, 25 years.

00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:05.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:06.640
Because we are seeing all this.

00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:13.960
PANDIT BIRJU MAHARAJ: I'm
writing a [NON-ENGLISH]..

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:16.700
Because this is the
blessing of my grandfather.

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:21.790
Still, I'm writing and
always doing that song.

00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:25.450
Like this, I feel
that the audience

00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:26.770
would understand if you--

00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:27.790
[INAUDIBLE] you can go.

00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:29.080
SUSHRI SASWATI SEN:
There's a meaning.

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:30.496
PANDIT BIRJU
MAHARAJ: It will give

00:23:30.496 --> 00:23:33.550
the meaning of your patterns
of the rhythm, patterns.

00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:35.040
Then everybody can understand.

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:36.712
Otherwise, after
five minutes, they

00:23:36.712 --> 00:23:39.730
get-- oh, the same
thing is going on.

00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:41.860
Then if you are
giving the meaning

00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:44.750
and the action expression
is coming with that,

00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:46.880
then it's interesting.

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:49.600
Therefore, I started
thinking this.

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:54.820
And it was very popular, and
everybody could understand me.

00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:57.130
Not the dry air rhythm--

00:23:57.130 --> 00:24:01.720
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]---- but
the [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]..

00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:04.340
The music, also--
[IMITATES NOTES]

00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:05.710
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:10.060
So the beats have a
nice cloth on that.

00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:15.130
The cloth is [SINGING NOTES]
That cloth on the beats

00:24:15.130 --> 00:24:16.666
is coming.

00:24:16.666 --> 00:24:17.440
So I feel--

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:19.990
SUSHRI SASWATI SEN: And
may I add something to it?

00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:23.080
When I was traveling with
Maharaj-ji first time when I

00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:27.520
came to America, 1974,
through the Asia Society--

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:29.140
very big company--

00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:32.380
[NON-ENGLISH]---- I
realized, of course,

00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:35.830
Maharaj-ji has been coming
since '60s, early '60s.

00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:40.570
At that time, they realized
much earlier that the two reason

00:24:40.570 --> 00:24:44.500
that has the words, the
particular subject of Krishna,

00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:48.610
Radha, and others,
[NON-ENGLISH],,

00:24:48.610 --> 00:24:53.050
were not so popular and were
not so much well understood

00:24:53.050 --> 00:24:54.329
by the audiences.

00:24:54.329 --> 00:24:55.620
Now, it's a different scenario.

00:24:55.620 --> 00:25:00.670
Now, there's Indians everywhere,
and everyone understands.

00:25:00.670 --> 00:25:06.640
So at that point, these
abstract rhythmic numbers

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:10.630
in a universal feeling,
like the flight of birds

00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:15.460
or the friends coming together,
as he said, or lazy and--

00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:17.080
these are universal.

00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:19.690
These feelings
are not restricted

00:25:19.690 --> 00:25:23.590
to our Indian mythology
or Indian subject.

00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:27.580
Those became very interestingly
understood more than,

00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:33.110
sometimes, [NON-ENGLISH],, more
than the lyrics and words.

00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:38.120
So I think I was quite a
witness to seeing Maharaj-ji

00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:40.840
come into more of these changes.

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:46.570
My little niece, when
she was three years old,

00:25:46.570 --> 00:25:51.580
Maharaj-ji was explaining to
her once one pattern of rhythm--

00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:57.670
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]---- because
my niece is his niece, also.

00:25:57.670 --> 00:26:02.320
We are related through my sister
and his cousin's marriage.

00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:07.620
So he said, OK, learn
from [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]..

00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:10.560
Two, three times, and then
she said, so difficult,

00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:11.430
[NON-ENGLISH].

00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:14.380
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:16.740
That was the first
Maharaj-ji realized.

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:18.970
And he said, OK,
I'll make it easy.

00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:23.390
PANDIT BIRJU MAHARAJ:
Then I asked her,

00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:25.460
you eat [NON-ENGLISH]?

00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:26.160
Yes.

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:26.750
[NON-ENGLISH]?

00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:27.770
Yes.

00:26:27.770 --> 00:26:30.495
Then [NON-ENGLISH],,
how many beats?

00:26:30.495 --> 00:26:31.277
Three.

00:26:31.277 --> 00:26:31.860
[NON-ENGLISH].

00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:33.170
SUSHRI SASWATI SEN:
[CLAPPING ON BEAT]

00:26:33.170 --> 00:26:33.980
PANDIT BIRJU MAHARAJ:
[NON-ENGLISH],, two.

00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:34.410
SUSHRI SASWATI
SEN: [NON-ENGLISH]..

00:26:34.410 --> 00:26:34.910
Mhm.

00:26:34.910 --> 00:26:36.636
PANDIT BIRJU MAHARAJ:
[NON-ENGLISH]..

00:26:36.636 --> 00:26:37.094
SHRIYA RAGHUNATHAN: [LAUGHS]

00:26:37.094 --> 00:26:38.218
PANDIT BIRJU MAHARAJ: Yeah.

00:26:38.218 --> 00:26:39.590
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:26:50.670 --> 00:26:53.180
You know, one minute,
she could understand.

00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:56.181
SUSHRI SASWATI SEN: Within
just one set, she learned it.

00:26:56.181 --> 00:26:56.930
Maharaj-ji's joke.

00:26:56.930 --> 00:26:57.430
OK.

00:26:57.430 --> 00:26:59.140
You learn it like [NON-ENGLISH].

00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:01.310
Later, you can put the
rhythm and words to it.

00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:01.980
PANDIT BIRJU MAHARAJ: And it
made me think [INAUDIBLE]..

00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:04.340
SUSHRI SASWATI SEN: And
then, of course, she's made--

00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:08.330
Maharaj-ji has made hundreds
of such things for little ones,

00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:13.070
for adults, uninitiated
adults who do not

00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:14.460
understand and appreciate.

00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:20.240
So those were the sources,
inspirations, and motivations

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:24.731
that Maharaj-ji got to
make such new changes.

00:27:24.731 --> 00:27:26.730
PANDIT BIRJU MAHARAJ: And
a really special thing

00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:28.790
that the Kathak is--

00:27:28.790 --> 00:27:31.010
daily life, if you're sitting--

00:27:31.010 --> 00:27:35.690
so some people, somebody, they
think like, somebody this way,

00:27:35.690 --> 00:27:39.340
somebody [INAUDIBLE],,
somebody [INAUDIBLE]..

00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:41.930
So different position
of how to sitting.

00:27:41.930 --> 00:27:44.150
And which one is
really beautiful,

00:27:44.150 --> 00:27:46.136
my camera is taking that.

00:27:46.136 --> 00:27:48.684
That is Kathak.

00:27:48.684 --> 00:27:51.110
SUSHRI SASWATI SEN: Kathak
is from the storytelling

00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:53.030
tradition, Katha.

00:27:53.030 --> 00:27:54.122
So it is very natural to--

00:27:54.122 --> 00:27:55.580
PANDIT BIRJU MAHARAJ:
Very natural.

00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:58.310
SUSHRI SASWATI SEN: --human
body language and expression.

00:27:58.310 --> 00:28:00.268
PANDIT BIRJU MAHARAJ:
One might [NON-ENGLISH]..

00:28:00.268 --> 00:28:03.320
[NON-ENGLISH] is a Kathak term.

00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:04.320
I did [NON-ENGLISH].

00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:05.250
[NON-ENGLISH] is this.

00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:05.750
Cheek.

00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:06.230
SUSHRI SASWATI SEN: Cheek.

00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:08.390
PANDIT BIRJU MAHARAJ: And
how to put the hand here.

00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:12.650
Because [NON-ENGLISH],,
the new begum, came.

00:28:12.650 --> 00:28:14.150
And he wanted just to kiss.

00:28:14.150 --> 00:28:18.097
And the begum told, oh, god.

00:28:18.097 --> 00:28:19.430
SUSHRI SASWATI SEN: She was shy.

00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:20.900
PANDIT BIRJU
MAHARAJ: She was shy.

00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:23.350
[NON-ENGLISH].

00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:25.430
[INAUDIBLE] told
to my grandfather,

00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:26.930
make this one get--

00:28:26.930 --> 00:28:29.944
SUSHRI SASWATI SEN:
Because I love the pose.

00:28:29.944 --> 00:28:31.610
PANDIT BIRJU MAHARAJ:
So immediately, we

00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:34.190
are taking from human.

00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:36.180
Naturally, we are learning.

00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:38.240
In any small
[INAUDIBLE],, then I'm

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:40.700
learning how the Krishna was.

00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:45.510
I'm looking, follow-- ah,
the moment of that boy.

00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:50.160
So everything, we are
learning from nature.

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:52.800
SHRIYA RAGHUNATHAN:
That's, again, incredible.

00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:55.230
And I've also heard that
you're pioneering a lot of how

00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:57.060
Kathak is also taught.

00:28:57.060 --> 00:28:58.770
So similar to what
you've described

00:28:58.770 --> 00:29:01.620
of how you've opened
Kathak up to the world,

00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:03.570
you've also opened
it up to how we

00:29:03.570 --> 00:29:06.450
learn as the next generation
who are more disconnected

00:29:06.450 --> 00:29:09.930
and may not have the opportunity
to learn the same way we all

00:29:09.930 --> 00:29:11.550
used to in the past.

00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:15.060
How do you see Kathak
moving in the future?

00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:17.570
How do you see the learning of
Kathak continuing to change?

00:29:17.570 --> 00:29:19.050
PANDIT BIRJU MAHARAJ: Yes.

00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:23.000
I have got my own institution,
Kalashram, in Delhi.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.850
And there is-- about
600, 700 students.

00:29:26.850 --> 00:29:28.440
My daughter is teaching.

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:29.460
Saswati is teaching.

00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:30.850
My son is teaching.

00:29:30.850 --> 00:29:36.270
And I think I'm so happy that
so many children is coming

00:29:36.270 --> 00:29:40.185
to learn Kathak, because they
say, otherwise, they can sit

00:29:40.185 --> 00:29:43.360
and listen to the nightclub.

00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:44.170
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:44.170 --> 00:29:47.640
But they're sending to me.

00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:50.490
You know, this
depend your child.

00:29:50.490 --> 00:29:52.860
You are going to temple, or
you're going to nightclubs,

00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:53.910
you know.

00:29:53.910 --> 00:29:55.540
So many people, no.

00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:58.410
But somebody is coming to me.

00:29:58.410 --> 00:30:05.830
[NON-ENGLISH],, how to bow
to your mother and father,

00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:10.236
how you should talk nicely.

00:30:10.236 --> 00:30:13.780
So we are teaching that, also.

00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:14.510
And painting.

00:30:14.510 --> 00:30:15.850
I'm doing painting.

00:30:15.850 --> 00:30:18.180
So I love to--

00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:21.630
some classes, I will keep
there in my institution.

00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:22.255
Painting, also.

00:30:22.255 --> 00:30:24.190
Yoga, also.

00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:28.140
And singing and
dancing, that is OK.

00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:33.820
But proper way, always,
I'm telling to my student--

00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:35.642
just go with your--

00:30:35.642 --> 00:30:37.770
and you're eating with hand.

00:30:37.770 --> 00:30:39.620
You are walking with your leg.

00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:43.270
But never you say,
thank you, my leg.

00:30:43.270 --> 00:30:46.700
I could reach with you.

00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:48.960
You're my friend.

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:50.850
My eye is my friend.

00:30:50.850 --> 00:30:55.420
Because sometimes, people
are doing this thing

00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:56.510
and doing this.

00:30:56.510 --> 00:31:00.280
So thanks always to your
body that god has given you.

00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:01.660
And yes, you do.

00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:04.650
When I'm doing [INAUDIBLE],,
then I'm doing,

00:31:04.650 --> 00:31:06.890
oh, you did very nicely.

00:31:06.890 --> 00:31:09.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:10.200
So the dance is--

00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:11.616
SUSHRI SASWATI
SEN: These are some

00:31:11.616 --> 00:31:16.620
of the things which the students
and the learners have realized.

00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:20.230
And what he's saying now,
he tells to the students,

00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:25.610
also, that you are
enjoying your body.

00:31:25.610 --> 00:31:29.760
The dancer gets a
beautiful personality, gets

00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:33.250
a very nice, pleasant
way of approaching

00:31:33.250 --> 00:31:44.800
and seeing the people around,
gives to the audience joy.

00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:45.670
All these things.

00:31:45.670 --> 00:31:52.330
And then your personality
grows when you are a dancer.

00:31:52.330 --> 00:31:53.860
Even when the film stars--

00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:56.410
when they come to
Maharaj-ji sometimes,

00:31:56.410 --> 00:31:59.050
and some of our students
who have gone into films

00:31:59.050 --> 00:32:04.330
and serials in India, they say,
because of dance, we were not--

00:32:04.330 --> 00:32:08.140
I mean, no one found
us difficult on screen,

00:32:08.140 --> 00:32:10.900
because we knew how to turn.

00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:14.710
We knew how to bend,
keeping our personality.

00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:20.590
So it adds to not only just that
much of [NON-ENGLISH] dancing,

00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:24.370
but your total appearance,
your total walk,

00:32:24.370 --> 00:32:27.040
how elegantly you can walk.

00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:31.260
I am sometimes telling
these Rampur dancers,

00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:33.390
they are going and taking
training from so and so,

00:32:33.390 --> 00:32:34.480
so and so--

00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:36.570
you, my students, if
you walk on Rampur,

00:32:36.570 --> 00:32:38.340
you will walk so much nicer.

00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:41.200
And there are a few of
my students, adults,

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:45.070
who goes for some
endorsement somewhere,

00:32:45.070 --> 00:32:48.670
[? saties ?] and this and
that, and they say, ma'am,

00:32:48.670 --> 00:32:50.800
they were saying you
walk so elegantly.

00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:54.760
I said, that's
because of your dance.

00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:59.680
So dance gives us so many
things beyond just the learning

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:02.350
and the performances.

00:33:02.350 --> 00:33:06.130
As a human being, you
enjoy from within.

00:33:06.130 --> 00:33:08.240
You enjoy your soul.

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:12.640
It fills your mind, your
soul, your total outlook

00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:17.350
towards society, towards
your people around.

00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:19.810
It changes a lot.

00:33:19.810 --> 00:33:21.120
SHRIYA RAGHUNATHAN: Definitely.

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:23.710
That nicely transitions
into what I had on mind

00:33:23.710 --> 00:33:26.110
next, which is you have
also brought Kathak

00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:30.600
to the forefront of Bollywood
and to Indian cinema.

00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:32.980
And you've worked in a
lot of very famous films,

00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:36.520
including "Bajirao
Mastani," "Vishwaroopam."

00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:40.090
And so how is that transition,
bringing the beauty of Kathak

00:33:40.090 --> 00:33:42.147
into Bollywood?

00:33:42.147 --> 00:33:44.230
PANDIT BIRJU MAHARAJ: My
uncle, Lachhu Maharaj-ji,

00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:47.190
was in, from a long, long time.

00:33:47.190 --> 00:33:50.270
And he called me to join there.

00:33:50.270 --> 00:33:53.840
My mother told, if
you'll go to Bombay,

00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:56.822
you will be changed, because
Bombay is [? style. ?] No.

00:33:56.822 --> 00:33:58.530
Bombay [? style. ?]
The Kathak was there.

00:33:58.530 --> 00:34:00.363
SUSHRI SASWATI SEN:
Don't go and live there.

00:34:00.363 --> 00:34:02.560
Just work for some
time and come back.

00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:05.600
PANDIT BIRJU MAHARAJ: There will
be more house building and cars

00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:06.600
and everything.

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:07.440
You'll come.

00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:09.920
I'm going, Mother, don't go.

00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:12.119
Otherwise, you've
lost your tradition.

00:34:12.119 --> 00:34:13.300
But I didn't go there.

00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:17.620
So for the first time
with Satyajit Ray,

00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:20.909
the great director,
when he offered,

00:34:20.909 --> 00:34:24.639
then I was happy that
I would try to do.

00:34:24.639 --> 00:34:28.480
I sang that song [NON-ENGLISH]
and [NON-ENGLISH],,

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:30.856
did that [INAUDIBLE],,
[NON-ENGLISH]..

00:34:30.856 --> 00:34:32.442
SUSHRI SASWATI SEN: In the film.

00:34:32.442 --> 00:34:34.150
PANDIT BIRJU MAHARAJ:
And I was so happy.

00:34:34.150 --> 00:34:37.120
And he told me, I
don't want to film it.

00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:42.489
You know tradition type
[NON-ENGLISH],, not film.

00:34:42.489 --> 00:34:44.570
So he told me like this,
and I was so happy.

00:34:44.570 --> 00:34:45.659
I'm going to go, OK.

00:34:45.659 --> 00:34:47.739
Then I will do like that.

00:34:47.739 --> 00:34:50.980
That was very popular,
[NON-ENGLISH]..

00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:55.820
That [NON-ENGLISH] written, that
[NON-ENGLISH],, my grandfather.

00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:58.840
SUSHRI SASWATI SEN: I'm
sure you search anywhere,

00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:02.360
Google would help find
everyone that "Shatranj Ke

00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:04.090
Khiladi" dance, which is--

00:35:04.090 --> 00:35:06.340
I mean, Sanjay
Leela Bhansali-ji,

00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:11.590
when we met him first, Sanjay
said, you know, Saswati?

00:35:11.590 --> 00:35:15.480
I was almost in love with when
I saw "Shatranj Ke Khiladi."

00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:17.280
I said, oh, I wish I knew that.

00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:19.220
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:23.830
So many people, even today,
when I see myself in that film,

00:35:23.830 --> 00:35:24.990
it's so beautifully done.

00:35:24.990 --> 00:35:28.400
Satyajit Ray has done
such an incredible job.

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:30.990
The costume, the
ambience, and everything.

00:35:30.990 --> 00:35:36.390
So that gave Maharaj-ji
that joy of working,

00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:39.840
yet not compromising,
with his style.

00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:43.220
And that, I think, came with
two or three more directors,

00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:44.650
like Sanjay-ji.

00:35:44.650 --> 00:35:47.370
PANDIT BIRJU MAHARAJ: You
could see, in [INAUDIBLE] also,

00:35:47.370 --> 00:35:49.170
I did Kathak bow.

00:35:49.170 --> 00:35:51.085
[NON-ENGLISH].

00:35:51.085 --> 00:35:52.710
SUSHRI SASWATI SEN:
[? Majira, ?] also.

00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:54.543
PANDIT BIRJU MAHARAJ:
That [NON-ENGLISH] was

00:35:54.543 --> 00:35:55.280
my grandfather.

00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:58.080
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:02.740
And between, there are some
poetry that I wrote that.

00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:06.540
So like this, you
know, [INAUDIBLE]..

00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:09.010
The song goes very nicely.

00:36:09.010 --> 00:36:12.170
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:13.017
Very nice.

00:36:13.017 --> 00:36:14.850
SUSHRI SASWATI SEN: And
it was so wonderful,

00:36:14.850 --> 00:36:19.410
that Kamal-ji, having so
many dance forms in the south

00:36:19.410 --> 00:36:22.470
and he being so
popular with them.

00:36:22.470 --> 00:36:24.750
He chose-- of course,
I think the theme

00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:29.370
was like he was hiding,
camouflaging his personality.

00:36:29.370 --> 00:36:32.810
But he came day after
day, learning Maharaj-ji.

00:36:32.810 --> 00:36:34.530
And he said, Maharaj-ji,
please check me.

00:36:34.530 --> 00:36:36.710
Please scold me.

00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:37.860
Make me correct.

00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:42.330
So the desire to learn--

00:36:42.330 --> 00:36:44.030
Deepika, similarly.

00:36:44.030 --> 00:36:46.920
My god, the first day
when she started working,

00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:50.760
she was so scared, so
nervous, so unsure.

00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:51.802
But within a day or two--

00:36:51.802 --> 00:36:53.635
PANDIT BIRJU MAHARAJ:
After two, three days.

00:36:53.635 --> 00:36:56.010
SUSHRI SASWATI SEN: --she
was enjoying so much.

00:36:56.010 --> 00:36:59.070
It didn't feel like she had
never learned Kathak before.

00:36:59.070 --> 00:37:01.590
It was so easy with her.

00:37:01.590 --> 00:37:04.770
So Maharaj-ji made it
so easy and beautiful.

00:37:04.770 --> 00:37:06.700
PANDIT BIRJU MAHARAJ:
But I didn't do that

00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:08.174
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:37:08.174 --> 00:37:10.102
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:10.102 --> 00:37:12.750
Not from here, not from here.

00:37:12.750 --> 00:37:18.060
I did Kathak and the turning
body and looking, eyes.

00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:20.500
And that, I did.

00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:24.040
And for future [INAUDIBLE],,
if somebody would ask me--

00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:27.060
nice costume, nice movement.

00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:28.357
Then I would do.

00:37:28.357 --> 00:37:30.190
SHRIYA RAGHUNATHAN: And
how do you preserve?

00:37:30.190 --> 00:37:32.280
How do you find it difficult,
like you mentioned,

00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:36.120
as there's so much pressure
to kind of modernize

00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:38.560
every classical art
form, whether it's music,

00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:40.230
whether it's dance and art?

00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:41.686
How do you preserve Kathak?

00:37:41.686 --> 00:37:42.560
Or how do you do it?

00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:49.345
PANDIT BIRJU MAHARAJ: I love
Kathak, and I believe that.

00:37:49.345 --> 00:37:52.550
And that's so much deeper.

00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:55.600
If you think, then
you can go very deep.

00:37:55.600 --> 00:38:02.800
And you don't do it like, I
have my own circle, very big.

00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:04.050
Why should I go across that?

00:38:04.050 --> 00:38:04.550
No.

00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:05.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:09.230
I can create so many
things, you know.

00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:10.840
So I will not--

00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:12.710
other people,
you'll come with me,

00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:14.630
then you help me,
then I will go.

00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:16.270
No.

00:38:16.270 --> 00:38:18.980
SUSHRI SASWATI SEN: The language
of Kathak and all these art

00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:21.940
forms are so complete,
they don't need to borrow.

00:38:21.940 --> 00:38:25.690
People who say they
do fusion because they

00:38:25.690 --> 00:38:29.080
think there's limitation within
the style, that's not true.

00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:31.630
Because they do not
know the style in depth.

00:38:31.630 --> 00:38:35.380
They are not competent
enough to search from what--

00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:38.830
look, not only in
the classical--

00:38:38.830 --> 00:38:41.200
I mean, not only the
solo forms of stage.

00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:44.620
Maharaj-ji has done such
wonderful group choreographies

00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:47.620
with so many
contemporary themes.

00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:48.910
Some of them are so popular.

00:38:48.910 --> 00:38:53.200
We even came to the American
Dance Festival quite some time

00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:55.335
back, maybe 25 years or so.

00:38:55.335 --> 00:38:55.960
AUDIENCE: 1991.

00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:57.001
SUSHRI SASWATI SEN: Yeah.

00:38:57.001 --> 00:38:57.920
OK.

00:38:57.920 --> 00:39:02.420
And there was a choreography.

00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:03.710
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:10.090
The autobiography of
a piece of iron ore,

00:39:10.090 --> 00:39:13.020
what it wanted to become.

00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:17.560
It was turned into weapons.

00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:21.220
Someone took it up
and put it in the kiln

00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:23.200
and made weapons out of it.

00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:24.160
And the iron says--

00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:26.050
PANDIT BIRJU MAHARAJ:
I can say in Hindi.

00:39:26.050 --> 00:39:26.580
SUSHRI SASWATI SEN: Yes.

00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:27.990
PANDIT BIRJU MAHARAJ:
[NON-ENGLISH]..

00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:29.060
SUSHRI SASWATI SEN: The poetry.

00:39:29.060 --> 00:39:30.434
PANDIT BIRJU
MAHARAJ: The poetry.

00:39:30.434 --> 00:39:41.264
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:39:41.264 --> 00:39:43.180
SUSHRI SASWATI SEN: When
bad man picked me up.

00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:49.027
PANDIT BIRJU MAHARAJ:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:39:49.027 --> 00:39:50.360
SUSHRI SASWATI SEN: In the kiln.

00:39:50.360 --> 00:40:03.580
PANDIT BIRJU MAHARAJ:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Another

00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:09.640
person has taken the other
piece, makes other material,

00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:11.860
and make a round shape.

00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:16.120
It was [NON-ENGLISH]
in the temple.

00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:17.710
The sword was
broken and finished

00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:20.710
until the last sword is setting.

00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:25.370
I could not make like you.

00:40:25.370 --> 00:40:26.982
The sound came down.

00:40:26.982 --> 00:40:28.190
SUSHRI SASWATI SEN: He said--

00:40:28.190 --> 00:40:31.880
the last word is, I wish
someone made me like you.

00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:33.655
I did not want to
become what I became.

00:40:33.655 --> 00:40:34.560
PANDIT BIRJU MAHARAJ: So
this poetry, I wrote that,

00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:35.780
and I composed that.

00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:39.032
And I made the painting, also.

00:40:39.032 --> 00:40:40.490
SUSHRI SASWATI SEN:
Yes, Maharaj-ji

00:40:40.490 --> 00:40:41.449
is a wonderful painter.

00:40:41.449 --> 00:40:43.115
SHRIYA RAGHUNATHAN:
That's so beautiful.

00:40:43.115 --> 00:40:45.440
SUSHRI SASWATI SEN:
Everything that he imagines,

00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:48.830
he puts on canvas and then
starts to choreograph, now,

00:40:48.830 --> 00:40:50.480
over the last 25, 30 years.

00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:52.230
PANDIT BIRJU MAHARAJ:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:40:52.230 --> 00:40:55.830
SUSHRI SASWATI SEN:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:40:55.830 --> 00:40:57.660
PANDIT BIRJU MAHARAJ:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:40:57.660 --> 00:41:00.037
SUSHRI SASWATI SEN:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:41:00.037 --> 00:41:02.370
PANDIT BIRJU MAHARAJ: A small
movement of the [? bow. ?]

00:41:02.370 --> 00:41:03.760
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:05.330
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:41:05.330 --> 00:41:07.918
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:10.105 --> 00:41:11.170
Could be anything.

00:41:11.170 --> 00:41:20.000
SUSHRI SASWATI SEN:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.800
PANDIT BIRJU MAHARAJ:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:25.118
SUSHRI SASWATI SEN:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:41:25.118 --> 00:41:26.868
PANDIT BIRJU MAHARAJ:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:41:26.868 --> 00:41:30.354
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:35.747 --> 00:41:37.830
SUSHRI SASWATI SEN: It's
a [NON-ENGLISH] like that

00:41:37.830 --> 00:41:38.630
of so many.

00:41:41.250 --> 00:41:44.180
It talks about Krishna's--
the first part of it is about

00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:46.260
Krishna's playfulness.

00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:47.890
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:53.750
Look, Krishna holds
me, holds my hand,

00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:56.140
on the way in front of everyone.

00:41:56.140 --> 00:41:58.610
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:41:58.610 --> 00:42:01.784
I went to fetch
water in the well.

00:42:01.784 --> 00:42:05.350
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:42:05.350 --> 00:42:08.560
I saw the mischievous Krishna.

00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:12.380
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:14.229
I was afraid, because
he was smiling--

00:42:14.229 --> 00:42:15.520
PANDIT BIRJU MAHARAJ: Laughing.

00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:17.990
SUSHRI SASWATI SEN: --very sly.

00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:20.880
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:22.700
Pull at my scarf.

00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:26.550
Guerrilla guy, [NON-ENGLISH],,
embraced me in public.

00:42:26.550 --> 00:42:29.030
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:34.910
And then the friends react to
his mischief, and they said--

00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:37.180
they get together and catch him.

00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:39.820
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:42:39.820 --> 00:42:40.880
Let him not escape.

00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:42.410
Let's catch him.

00:42:42.410 --> 00:42:44.840
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:47.384
Let's deck him up like a woman.

00:42:47.384 --> 00:42:48.550
PANDIT BIRJU MAHARAJ: Woman.

00:42:48.550 --> 00:42:50.300
SUSHRI SASWATI SEN:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]..

00:42:54.730 --> 00:42:56.900
Let's adorn him.

00:42:56.900 --> 00:42:59.249
And then the poet,
Bindadin Maharaj, says--

00:42:59.249 --> 00:43:00.790
PANDIT BIRJU MAHARAJ:
My grandfather.

00:43:00.790 --> 00:43:03.680
SUSHRI SASWATI SEN:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]..

00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:08.150
Even as a woman, he was so
mesmerizing and so beautiful.

00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:09.910
And then, of course,
the last piece.

00:43:09.910 --> 00:43:11.420
[NON-ENGLISH].

00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:14.060
Can I come here?

00:43:14.060 --> 00:43:15.050
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:43:15.050 --> 00:43:18.124
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:43:35.484 --> 00:43:48.032
PANDIT BIRJU MAHARAJ:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:43:48.032 --> 00:43:56.220
SUSHRI SASWATI SEN:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:43:56.220 --> 00:44:08.534
PANDIT BIRJU MAHARAJ:
[NON-ENGLISH SINGING]

00:44:08.534 --> 00:44:11.246
BOTH: [NON-ENGLISH SINGING]

00:44:11.246 --> 00:45:20.435
PANDIT BIRJU MAHARAJ:
[NON-ENGLISH SINGING]

00:45:20.435 --> 00:45:22.487
BOTH: [NON-ENGLISH SINGING]

00:45:22.487 --> 00:45:31.220
PANDIT BIRJU MAHARAJ:
[NON-ENGLISH SINGING]

00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:34.065
BOTH: [NON-ENGLISH SINGING]

00:45:34.065 --> 00:46:27.096
PANDIT BIRJU MAHARAJ:
[NON-ENGLISH SINGING]

00:46:27.096 --> 00:46:33.570
BOTH: [NON-ENGLISH SINGING]

00:46:33.570 --> 00:46:37.056
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:41.449 --> 00:46:43.490
SHRIYA RAGHUNATHAN: We
are so lucky that you just

00:46:43.490 --> 00:46:44.600
did that performance.

00:46:47.370 --> 00:46:50.360
So as another
question for you, how

00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:53.150
do you see the
role of technology

00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:56.150
in helping Kathak and
Indian classical art

00:46:56.150 --> 00:46:59.630
forms in helping move it forward
so that the next generation

00:46:59.630 --> 00:47:01.230
of people can get access?

00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:02.840
And how do you see
the role of Google

00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:05.900
and how we can help better
bring Kathak to more people?

00:47:05.900 --> 00:47:08.840
SUSHRI SASWATI SEN: I'm already
sure when this will go on air,

00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:11.990
there'll be thousands of likes
of people liking it and seeing

00:47:11.990 --> 00:47:13.040
us.

00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:16.250
Technology has helped immensely.

00:47:16.250 --> 00:47:23.380
Actually, sometimes, we are
also afraid of our youngsters

00:47:23.380 --> 00:47:26.560
going too much towards
only technology

00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:30.067
and not learning things--

00:47:30.067 --> 00:47:30.775
I mean, directly.

00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:37.030
Both are important.

00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:40.120
Use of technology
for preservation

00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:44.860
for wider promotions
and all is important.

00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:53.900
But certain things should
be learned in person, person

00:47:53.900 --> 00:47:56.660
to person.

00:47:56.660 --> 00:48:00.500
PANDIT BIRJU MAHARAJ: I remember
when my uncle, [INAUDIBLE],,

00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:04.600
when the lighting came, the
spotlights [NON-ENGLISH],,

00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:09.020
then the light man asked, you
want amber one or yellow one

00:48:09.020 --> 00:48:13.710
or red one or-- what
kind for your dance?

00:48:13.710 --> 00:48:17.670
Look, don't give only
white light you give me.

00:48:17.670 --> 00:48:21.860
This color I will think, that
color will go on the stage.

00:48:21.860 --> 00:48:25.470
From my eyes, from my
action, that color will come.

00:48:25.470 --> 00:48:27.410
Don't give only white, huh?

00:48:27.410 --> 00:48:29.420
Don't put anything.

00:48:29.420 --> 00:48:30.950
And that time was--

00:48:30.950 --> 00:48:32.630
this time was, yeah.

00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:37.850
Now, everybody needs-- how
you give to my nose, my knee.

00:48:37.850 --> 00:48:39.637
So many problems, no?

00:48:39.637 --> 00:48:41.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:42.675
[INAUDIBLE] problem.

00:48:42.675 --> 00:48:44.990
SUSHRI SASWATI SEN:
So we are becoming

00:48:44.990 --> 00:48:49.280
a little too dependent
and too weak in our own

00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:53.590
strength of bringing
out things from within.

00:48:53.590 --> 00:48:57.380
And just as I said, as
soon as this goes on air,

00:48:57.380 --> 00:49:00.860
people will see it, and
I will become known.

00:49:00.860 --> 00:49:03.990
People will see it, and
it will become popular.

00:49:03.990 --> 00:49:07.940
But I can promise you,
people who are here,

00:49:07.940 --> 00:49:09.920
the way they enjoyed
it here, they

00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:12.630
will not enjoy it
through whatever means

00:49:12.630 --> 00:49:15.320
they would see on a machine.

00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:22.200
So that human life,
especially in these art forms,

00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:27.490
like playing a sitar or
a tabla and playing it

00:49:27.490 --> 00:49:31.910
through these
instruments, the machines,

00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:33.530
doesn't give the
same feeling, doesn't

00:49:33.530 --> 00:49:37.240
give the same resonance.

00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:39.530
It may be very close
and very perfect.

00:49:39.530 --> 00:49:42.080
PANDIT BIRJU MAHARAJ:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]..

00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:44.950
The feeling of the song of
your teacher, what is the sound

00:49:44.950 --> 00:49:47.090
is coming, how
they're teaching--

00:49:47.090 --> 00:49:50.690
that particularly,
then you feel more.

00:49:50.690 --> 00:49:52.040
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:49:55.610 --> 00:49:57.679
So I don't believe
in technology, but--

00:49:57.679 --> 00:49:59.720
SUSHRI SASWATI SEN: I
would be very happy to have

00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:01.580
some of my friends who--

00:50:01.580 --> 00:50:06.820
I would be very happy to narrate
a small story, an anecdote,

00:50:06.820 --> 00:50:08.570
a story, a real--

00:50:08.570 --> 00:50:10.220
[? Jeeva ?]
[? Paani-ji, ?] a director,

00:50:10.220 --> 00:50:15.920
when he came to America many,
many years ago for a very--

00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:17.930
he was a very learned person.

00:50:17.930 --> 00:50:23.390
So there was a very special
dinner with all the scholars.

00:50:23.390 --> 00:50:26.540
And he went, washed
his hands, and then

00:50:26.540 --> 00:50:28.430
started eating with his hands.

00:50:28.430 --> 00:50:31.580
Then someone commented,
oh Mr. [? Paani, ?]

00:50:31.580 --> 00:50:33.860
you're not used to
the knife and fork,

00:50:33.860 --> 00:50:37.730
and you don't enjoy
your food with that.

00:50:37.730 --> 00:50:41.750
He said, yes, I'm used to
knife and fork when I need.

00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:46.130
But I enjoy eating
with my fingers,

00:50:46.130 --> 00:50:50.390
because it gives me more flavor,
just as I enjoy making love

00:50:50.390 --> 00:50:53.990
with my wife through my body
and not with instruments

00:50:53.990 --> 00:50:55.770
and gloves in my hands.

00:50:55.770 --> 00:50:59.660
So my food is very dear to me.

00:50:59.660 --> 00:51:00.640
I know I've washed my--

00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:03.890
they said, are you
sure your hands--

00:51:03.890 --> 00:51:07.700
he said, yes, I've washed
my hands, and so it's clean.

00:51:07.700 --> 00:51:11.970
But are you sure your fork
has been cleaned properly?

00:51:11.970 --> 00:51:15.830
Then everyone said, oh,
leave aside all forks.

00:51:15.830 --> 00:51:21.050
So something natural
is really beautiful--

00:51:21.050 --> 00:51:26.210
a tree growing naturally,
the fruit that it bears.

00:51:26.210 --> 00:51:33.210
And if you put all the imitation
into it, all those bad things

00:51:33.210 --> 00:51:37.700
into making it grow better
or giving [INAUDIBLE],,

00:51:37.700 --> 00:51:39.869
is not the same.

00:51:39.869 --> 00:51:41.660
SHRIYA RAGHUNATHAN:
That's very, very true.

00:51:41.660 --> 00:51:44.960
And even meeting you in person
has been so enlightening.

00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:46.410
We've learned so much.

00:51:46.410 --> 00:51:49.220
And I wanted to say thank
you for being such a pioneer

00:51:49.220 --> 00:51:52.730
in helping women come
back into dance form.

00:51:52.730 --> 00:51:56.240
My own grandmother went through
something similar [INAUDIBLE]..

00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:58.730
And we've seen a lot of
how you've brought Kathak

00:51:58.730 --> 00:52:01.160
to all of us, both in terms
of how you've brought it

00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:03.860
