00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:01.730
- [Instructor] So let's review a situation

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:03.670
that we've seen multiple times

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.580
when we are analyzing a monopoly firm.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.630
Let's say that this is the demand curve

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.920
and the cost structure for a monopoly firm

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.200
where it's the only hotel in town.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.990
So it definitely has a
monopoly on hotel rooms.

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.710
So it is a hotel, and all of
its guest rooms are identical.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.460
Now you can see the demand curve.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.320
If the price per night is high,

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.230
very few people are going to
demand staying at that hotel,

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.060
but if the price per night is low,

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.430
a lot of people are going to
demand staying at that hotel.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.590
And we also see the marginal cost

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.920
and the average total cost,
where the average total cost

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:40.760
is at the minimum point

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.000
where it intersects the
marginal cost curve.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.850
And we've thought about in the past

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.970
what the marginal revenue
curve would look like.

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:50.900
Pause this video and see if
you can refresh your memory.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.610
What does the marginal revenue curve

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.360
typically look like for
this type of monopoly firm?

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.560
Well, if we assume a situation,

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.920
let's say room number one,

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.670
if they were only putting one room out,

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.100
there might be a very high
willingness to pay for that.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.752
Someone out there is willing to pay

00:01:08.752 --> 00:01:12.940
$500 per night for that room.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.730
But we know that as soon as
you get to room number two,

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:17.990
room number two, there
might not be someone

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.650
who's willing to pay $500 for that room.

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.400
Maybe someone's willing
to pay $400 per night

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.400
for that room.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.570
And so what is the marginal revenue

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.150
when you go from room one to room two?

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.870
Well, you might be
tempted to say, it is $400

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.100
because they're getting incremental 400.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.610
But what's typical in a lot of markets is,

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.160
whatever price you give to one customer,

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.180
you have to give to all the customers.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.070
So room number one would
have to go for $400 as well.

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.280
So instead of making $500,
you're now making $800.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.730
So the marginal revenue,
the incremental revenue,

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.760
is $300, not $400.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.700
And we've seen that in multiple videos,

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.830
and that's why we have this phenomenon

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.030
where the marginal revenue curve goes down

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.820
at a steeper slope than the demand curve,

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.430
'cause every incremental unit

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.680
when you produce more and more quantity,

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.150
not only does it force its price down,

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.070
but all of the units in the
markets, the price goes down.

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.120
So this is the marginal revenue.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.600
And we have studied this in some detail.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.270
The rational quantity
for this firm to produce.

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.920
I'll put that right over there, Q sub M.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.420
This is a monopoly firm.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.160
This would be the rational
price at which to operate.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.530
And we can think about things like,

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.850
well, what is going to be the
economic profit for this firm?

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.450
Well, it's going to be at that quantity,

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.130
the difference between
the marginal revenue

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.001
and the average total cost,

00:02:47.001 --> 00:02:48.540
I'm gonna do this in a different color,

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.260
times the quantity,

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.350
and so the economic profit

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.020
would be this area right over here.

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.840
We've seen that in multiple videos.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.190
What would be the consumer surplus?

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.380
Well, the consumer surplus
is all of the benefit

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:05.720
that the consumers are going to get

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.160
above and beyond the
price they have to pay.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.420
So we have this quantity.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.950
This is the price that
the consumers are paying,

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.410
and they get this quantity.

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.220
And this demand curve, you can say,

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.720
hey, this first unit, someone
got that much benefit.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.400
Then the next unit, someone
got that much benefit.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.240
And so this total area right over here

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.790
is the consumer surplus.

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.550
It has a nice consumer surplus.

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.100
But we've also talked about an issue.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.710
It's not allocatively efficient.

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:33.660
If it was allocatively efficient,

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.570
we would produce up to the quantity

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:38.730
where marginal cost is equal to demand,

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.050
but we don't do that because
the marginal revenue curve

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.210
is below the demand curve.

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:48.210
So all of this region right
over here is dead weight loss.

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:50.930
Dead weight loss.

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.590
So an interesting question is,

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.150
is there anything that
this hotel company could do

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.400
to maybe capture some of the surplus

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.880
and maybe not have as
much dead weight loss?

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.320
Well, let's imagine an extreme scenario,

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.560
something that's probably not
possible in the real world,

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.730
but in the real world,
people could approach it.

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.320
Let's imagine this same hotel,

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.190
but it doesn't have to
abide by this notion

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.520
that whatever price it
charges to one guest

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:18.850
it has to charge to all the guests.

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.950
And this phenomenon that
we're going to talk about

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.883
is known as price discrimination.

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.010
And it might sound bad.

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:28.830
In general, we don't like the idea

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.780
of discriminating against someone.

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.040
But price discrimination is a
completely legitimate thing.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.820
Sometimes you might see products

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.700
that don't have perfect
price discrimination,

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.840
but they'll do something,
like it's essentially

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.890
the same soda or the same car,

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:44.410
but they make one look
a little bit fancier

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:45.670
and they're able to charge more to it

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:47.710
for people who have a
higher willingness to pay.

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.980
And so perfect price discrimination

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:51.930
in the case of the hotel owner

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.890
would be every time
someone calls and says,

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:56.210
hey, how much is going to be for a room,

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.870
that that hotel owner
has some magic computer

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.400
that can perfectly predict

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.340
what that person's willingness to pay is,

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.380
and it quotes them that price.

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.520
And so in that situation,

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.040
when the person for room number
one calls and says how much,

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.210
they'll say, okay, I see your
willingness to pay is 500.

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.200
I'm going to charge you 500.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.530
And person two calls and says,
oh your willingness to pay,

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:21.350
the magic computer says their
willingness to pay is 350.

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:22.870
Well, I'm gonna charge you 350.

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.420
They're further out here
on the demand curve.

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:30.320
If for room number
three, room number three,

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.180
someone calls and the computer says,

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.520
hey, that person's
willingness to pay is $450,

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:35.480
so quote them that.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:39.690
And so the hotel owner quotes them $450.

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:44.120
So in that situation, for
every incremental room,

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.810
you don't have to lower the
price on everything else.

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:49.940
So in that world, you don't
have a marginal revenue curve

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:52.580
that goes down at a faster
rate than the demand curve.

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:56.350
The demand curve actually is
the marginal revenue curve

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:58.090
in that situation.

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:01.540
The rational quantity
for this firm to produce

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:03.680
would be where the marginal cost curve

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.010
intersects the demand curve

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:07.580
because it is the marginal
revenue curve in that situation

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.870
with perfect price discrimination.

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:14.870
And so, you have this quantity
that it is going to produce.

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:18.280
Now I have an interesting
set of questions for you.

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.540
Pause this video and think about,

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:21.980
where would we put price here?

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:23.840
Is there an equilibrium price?

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.150
And how would we think about
the firm's economic profit,

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:28.650
the consumer surplus,
and the dead weight loss

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:30.240
in this scenario?

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.770
All right, now let's
work through it together.

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:34.020
Now, you might be tempted to
just go through the motions

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:35.920
that you've done in multiple other videos.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.520
We would say, okay, that looks like

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.680
an equilibrium price in the market,

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.460
and then that price minus
the average total cost

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:44.160
is the amount that they are able

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.810
to make an economic profit per unit,

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:49.130
and then you multiply that
times the number of units.

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:52.550
And then this area gives
that firm's economic profit.

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:53.795
But the flaw in there is that

00:06:53.795 --> 00:06:57.000
there is no one market price here.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.040
The firm's able to
charge a different price

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:00.340
for every single unit,

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:02.510
and it's definitely not
the same for every unit.

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:06.320
So this analysis would be incorrect.

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:09.220
What's actually going on
is, for every single unit,

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.880
the firm is able to capture the difference

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.130
between the average total cost

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:15.560
when we're producing at this quantity,

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.340
so our average total
cost is right over here,

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:22.400
and the marginal revenue,
which is the demand curve.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.710
So that's actually
going to be all of this,

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:27.410
is going to be the economic profit,

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:30.690
the economic profit for the firm.

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:33.610
So this is all economic profit.

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:35.410
The firm is doing very well

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:37.350
by doing this price discrimination.

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:40.550
And notice, there is no
dead weight loss anymore.

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:42.040
We are allocatively efficient.

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:43.560
We're producing a quantity

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:46.580
where marginal cost is equal to demand.

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:48.390
Now, if you're a consumer in this market,

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:51.520
you might not be so happy
because the consumer surplus

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.100
in this perfect price discrimination,

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:56.720
this is an idealized
version, has disappeared.

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:59.220
Because in every case,
this clairvoyant computer

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:01.600
is able to say, hey,
that willingness to pay,

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:04.290
you're willing to pay 450,
we're gonna charge you 450.

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:06.480
So you're not getting a lot of benefit

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:08.280
above and beyond what
you're willing to pay.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:10.420
That would be the consumer surplus,

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:12.210
the extra benefit for you.

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:14.260
So you're not able to do that.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:15.890
Now as I mentioned, in the real world,

00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:19.080
this is difficult, but
things like hotel owners

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:21.270
and airlines, they actually try to do

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:22.740
some form of price discrimination.

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:25.760
That's why when you go to
a hotel, it's very unlikely

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:27.430
that you're paying the exact same rate

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:29.870
as a person who's in an
identical room next to you.

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:32.510
Or if you sit in a
plane, it's very unlikely

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:34.300
that you paid the same
price as someone else

00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:36.310
because they have fancy
computer algorithms

00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:38.300
that are trying to charge everyone

00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:40.830
as close to their willingness
to pay as possible.

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:43.590
Now, their curve would not
look exactly like this,

00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:45.900
where demand is equal to marginal revenue,

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:48.040
but the better and better a firm gets

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:49.460
at price discrimination,

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:51.410
the more that the marginal revenue curve

00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:54.520
will start to get closer and
closer to the demand curve.

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:58.380
It won't slope down twice as
fast as we see in the situation

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:01.353
where you have to charge
the same rate to everyone.
