00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.990
So now that we have our report done with,

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:03.920
we can go to create a Dashboard off of it.

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:05.000
&gt;&gt; Okay, how do I do that?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.380
&gt;&gt; So, if you go back to the top, one of the tabs is Dashboards.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.380
So, we're going to want to create a new Dashboard. And a Dashboard itself is

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.380
a layout for a bunch of different dashboard components. And so the report that

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.110
we just made is going to create

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.796
one dashboard component, which is one Gauge Chart.

00:00:23.796 --> 00:00:24.110
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:25.610
&gt;&gt; And Dashboards can be a culmination

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.020
of several dashboard components so you can see

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.780
snapshots of a bunch of different stuff at once.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.520
&gt;&gt; Okay. And if I, if my,

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.850
&gt;&gt; Intuition is right?

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.620
&gt;&gt; Yeah, intuition, that's the word. I'm going to drag some things.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.320
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so drop that guy in, looks just like a little odometer or gauge.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.140
&gt;&gt; Okay, so like a data source here, okay.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.750
&gt;&gt; So the report that we created is

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.150
a data source and there are a couple different

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:47.920
data sources you can create, but that's the

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.700
easiest one to make, which is point and click.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.510
&gt;&gt; So, I'm going to click Data Source,

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.230
open Reports &gt; My Personal Custom Reports. Oh,

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.250
wow, this is actually really easy. Isn't this exciting?

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.370
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know, the anticipation is killing me.

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.370
&gt;&gt;

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.798
[LAUGH]

00:01:01.798 --> 00:01:06.250
Hey, cool. Alright so I obviously want to change some of these things.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.740
I want to set some milestones or something. So what should we do?

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.630
&gt;&gt; So, the first thing that we need to do, is scroll up and click the Wrench.

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.310
&gt;&gt; Oh yeah, always the Wrench.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.860
&gt;&gt; So what we're going is setting the different areas

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.340
of the gauge chart so it shows red, yellow, and green.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:22.220
&gt;&gt; Gotcha.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.960
&gt;&gt; So what's our goal, Andy, for the event?

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.750
&gt;&gt; well we've,

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.564
we're kind of making this up. Let's say the goal is $200,000.

00:01:31.564 --> 00:01:32.570
&gt;&gt; Sounds good.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.740
&gt;&gt; so then that's, well that'll be the yellow

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.930
to green threshold, let's say. So that we then, if

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.260
we make more on that, we can still see

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.079
it go beyond that. I'm going to make this one 300,000.

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:48.922
&gt;&gt; Okay, and so then that red would be 100,000. Yup.

00:01:48.922 --> 00:01:50.160
&gt;&gt; Oh, cool.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.910
&gt;&gt; So usually these thresholds would be based off of real metrics.

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:54.003
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:54.003 --> 00:01:59.120
&gt;&gt; In this case we just made it up but you can see where the progress is on

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.400
the right. And there's actually, it turns into a

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.810
smaller number in order to make it fit. And so

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.130
it says 100, 200, 300 but you can see the sum of the total spent is really in

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.710
the thousands here. Now if you go to the

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:15.780
Component Data you can change how it's showing this gauge.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.202
&gt;&gt; I can do Whole Units, and then it overlaps and it looks crappy so we'll

00:02:19.202 --> 00:02:20.850
do, I think thousands is fine.

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.580
&gt;&gt; Thousands looks good. you can also change the value

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.130
so maybe you don't want track the actually total spent.

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.520
Maybe you just want to spent, see how many different records

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.370
there were. if you, I mean we don't in this case.

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.620
&gt;&gt; No

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.210
&gt;&gt; But I'm just saying, like there, there are option here for you

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.745
to be able to work with the same rapport but display different data.

00:02:37.745 --> 00:02:40.930
&gt;&gt; Okay, cool. And so let's pretend, if this were

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.810
a real festival. The, this first threshold, 100,000, would be like,

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.130
that's your cost, that's just recuperating your cost. Maybe 200,000

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.930
is your goal, and then that's a bonus or something.

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.490
&gt;&gt; But really, immediately, we see off of those like couple hundred records,

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.410
hey, we have a lot more to go before we hit our goal.

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:57.410
&gt;&gt; Okay, that's pretty cool.
