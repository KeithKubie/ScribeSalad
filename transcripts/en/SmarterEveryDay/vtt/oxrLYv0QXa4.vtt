[Music]

00:00:09.384 --> 00:00:13.091
Okay, today we're going to try
to figure out how wagon...

00:00:13.116 --> 00:00:16.291
Today we're going to try to figure
out how dragonfly wings work

00:00:16.316 --> 00:00:21.559
So Phil has a dragonfly that I
caught last night on our night walk,

00:00:21.584 --> 00:00:25.519
and we have a high speed camera,

00:00:25.544 --> 00:00:31.633
and we are set up the macro lens
to try to collect that exact spot.

00:00:31.658 --> 00:00:33.954
So tell me when to trigger.

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:35.864
(Phil) Let's go.
(Destin) You got it?

00:00:40.496 --> 00:00:42.931
(Destin) Holy cow.
- Looks cool, doesn't it?

00:00:42.956 --> 00:00:44.683
- Oh man.
- Yeah?

00:00:44.716 --> 00:00:46.214
- We got it.
- Awesome.

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:48.974
[Music]

00:01:16.882 --> 00:01:19.163
(Destin) Alright, so you have one
of your entomology books here?

00:01:19.188 --> 00:01:22.713
- You know it.
- Which book is it?

00:01:22.738 --> 00:01:25.462
- Borro and DeLong's Intro
to the Study of Insects.

00:01:25.487 --> 00:01:27.251
This is a classic entomology book.

00:01:27.276 --> 00:01:29.236
 So with these guys the
muscles are actually

00:01:29.261 --> 00:01:31.302
pulling directly on the base of the wing.

00:01:31.327 --> 00:01:35.769
So it's a direct flight mechanism. Um...
- So what's an indirect flight mechanism?

00:01:35.794 --> 00:01:40.764
- Indirect flight mechanism, it actually
just pulls on the body wall of the thorax

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:44.609
and the collapse or expansion
causes the wings to then move.

00:01:44.634 --> 00:01:47.271
- So we're going to go from the rainforest
to a rainy day in my home town.

00:01:47.296 --> 00:01:49.455
Now, we have all different
kinds of art projects here

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.309
and the one I really want to show
you is the dragonfly project.

00:01:52.334 --> 00:01:54.224
What they've done is they've
given metal dragonflies

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:55.911
to all the different
organizations in the town

00:01:55.936 --> 00:01:57.546
and they let them paint
them however they want.

00:01:57.571 --> 00:01:59.255
What I think is cool about the dragonfly

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.183
 is that the wing attaches to the body in a
completely different way than most insects.

00:02:03.208 --> 00:02:06.157
To explain this I've decided
to become a dragonfly muscle.

00:02:06.182 --> 00:02:07.500
This is a wasp.

00:02:07.525 --> 00:02:10.931
To see how normal insects operate their
wings we need to cut the thorax in half

00:02:10.956 --> 00:02:13.637
so we can see the muscles
operating on the inside.

00:02:13.662 --> 00:02:16.599
Eeugh, it's uglier than I thought. Anyway,

00:02:16.624 --> 00:02:19.083
The wings of most flying
bugs use this method,

00:02:19.108 --> 00:02:21.217
which is called indirect musculature.

00:02:21.242 --> 00:02:25.023
The muscles pull on the body wall of the
thorax instead of on the wing itself.

00:02:25.048 --> 00:02:26.696
The shell then pushes on the wing,

00:02:26.721 --> 00:02:29.463
which seesaws on a pivot
point and moves up and down.

00:02:29.488 --> 00:02:32.327
The problem is muscles
pull - they don't push.

00:02:32.352 --> 00:02:34.084
So how does the wing return?

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:36.643
If you would've imagined that the
thorax was shaped like a football,

00:02:36.668 --> 00:02:39.210
the big muscles would be squishing
the ball in on the middle.

00:02:39.235 --> 00:02:41.530
When you turn it on its side you
can see that this little muscle

00:02:41.555 --> 00:02:45.356
 runs the length of the football and
pulls in longways from the inside.

00:02:45.381 --> 00:02:48.642
This makes the middle bulge back
out, which moves the wing down.

00:02:48.667 --> 00:02:50.724
Dragonflies, however, operate differently.

00:02:50.749 --> 00:02:52.155
When we look inside a dragonfly

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.346
we can see that they have what's
called direct musculature.

00:02:55.371 --> 00:02:58.065
Their muscles pull directly on the
wings and are able to operate

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.787
each wing independently in both directions.

00:03:00.812 --> 00:03:01.825
This is a big deal,

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.832
 and this is why completely
dominate the insect flying world.

00:03:04.857 --> 00:03:06.290
If you look back at the high speed,

00:03:06.315 --> 00:03:10.559
 in those little cracks you can see muscles
wiggling and pulling directly on the wings.

00:03:10.584 --> 00:03:11.968
That's pretty awesome, huh?

00:03:11.993 --> 00:03:15.457
(Phil) So, they say "in many
Odonata," which are dragonflies,

00:03:15.482 --> 00:03:17.903
"the front and hind wings
move independently,

00:03:17.928 --> 00:03:20.977
and there is a phase difference in the
movements of the two pairs; that is,

00:03:21.002 --> 00:03:24.099
when one pair is moving up, the
other pair is moving down.

00:03:24.124 --> 00:03:27.914
Okay, Dr. Jim Usherwood in the UK
and his colleagues discovered that

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:31.608
because dragonflies have two sets of wings,
for the most part they're inefficient.

00:03:31.633 --> 00:03:34.531
More inefficient than just normal
insect flight with two wings.

00:03:34.563 --> 00:03:36.701
They made a robot with two pairs of wings

00:03:36.726 --> 00:03:38.887
and they would vary the timing
between the two, and they found

00:03:38.912 --> 00:03:41.979
that at a certain timing they
could get 20% more efficiency

00:03:42.004 --> 00:03:43.860
than they could with just two wings.

00:03:43.885 --> 00:03:46.298
Dragonfly wings have something
on them called the pterostigma,

00:03:46.323 --> 00:03:47.878
 which is latin for "wing mark".

00:03:47.903 --> 00:03:50.136
You may have seen them before.
This is a dark cell

00:03:50.161 --> 00:03:52.996
on the leading edge of the wing that's
heavier than the rest of the wing.

00:03:53.021 --> 00:03:55.887
At a certain velocty, thin wings
begin to automatically vibrate,

00:03:55.912 --> 00:03:57.799
which makes it impossible to glide quickly.

00:03:57.824 --> 00:04:00.290
With the added weight at this
particular spot on the wing,

00:04:00.315 --> 00:04:03.031
these vibrations don't start
till a much higher airspeed,

00:04:03.056 --> 00:04:05.777
which means dragonflies
can now move much faster.

00:04:05.802 --> 00:04:08.116
Turns out it's a complex
aerodynamic structure

00:04:08.141 --> 00:04:10.727
built right into the design of
the wing to help them glide.

00:04:10.752 --> 00:04:14.123
Every time I see a dragonfly I
always try to spot that spot.

00:04:14.148 --> 00:04:17.411
Wait a second, have you ever
seen a dragonfly glide?

00:04:17.436 --> 00:04:19.811
Okay, in this last video you
can see that we're in a canoe,

00:04:19.836 --> 00:04:22.234
we have a Phantom Miro high speed
camera and we're trying to capture

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:24.736
 these dragonflies as they
lift up off the grass.

00:04:24.761 --> 00:04:27.995
Now, you cool thing about it is you can
see that he uses his wings to hover,

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.402
but he also uses them as a way of gliding.

00:04:30.427 --> 00:04:32.579
It's incredible, 'cause can see
him feather the front wing

00:04:32.604 --> 00:04:35.032
and allow it to glide the
air over the second wing.

00:04:35.057 --> 00:04:37.075
I've never seen anything like this.
Check it out.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.712

00:05:07.474 --> 00:05:09.888

(Destin) What happened to your tooth?

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:27.529
(Sadie) [Unintelligible]

00:05:27.554 --> 00:05:29.171
- Don't tell them what I payed for it.

00:05:29.196 --> 00:05:34.359
[Kids laughing]
(Destin) [Laughing] Stop. Stop.

00:05:34.384 --> 00:05:35.920
Okay, in this last...
[Train nearing]

00:05:35.945 --> 00:05:38.404
There's a train. It's loud everywhere here.

00:05:38.429 --> 00:05:41.383
Okay, in this last video we've got the
Miro high speed camera in the canoe

00:05:41.408 --> 00:05:42.957
and we're looking at a dragonfly,

00:05:42.982 --> 00:05:45.317
and we get to see it lift
up off a piece of grass...

00:05:45.342 --> 00:05:47.335
[Sniff]
Dripping snot.

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:51.808
Man. Waiting on dragonflies.
It's kind of boring.

00:05:51.833 --> 00:05:55.865
