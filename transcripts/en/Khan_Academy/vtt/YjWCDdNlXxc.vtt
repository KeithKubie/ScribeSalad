00:00:00.409 --> 00:00:03.064
- [Instructor] Find the
area of the semicircle.

00:00:03.064 --> 00:00:05.700
So pause this video and see
if you can figure it out.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.270
So let's see.

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:09.510
We know that the area of a circle

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.843
is equal to pi times our radius squared.

00:00:14.725 --> 00:00:16.845
So, if we think about the entire circle,

00:00:16.845 --> 00:00:19.167
what is the area going to be?

00:00:19.167 --> 00:00:21.009
Well, they tell us what our radius is.

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:22.682
Our radius is equal to two,

00:00:22.682 --> 00:00:25.876
so the area, if we're talking
about the whole circle,

00:00:25.876 --> 00:00:30.073
it would be equal to pi times two squared.

00:00:30.073 --> 00:00:31.823
Pi times two squared.

00:00:32.859 --> 00:00:34.737
Two squared is of course two times two,

00:00:34.737 --> 00:00:35.930
which is equal to four,

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.923
so our area is going to
be equal to four times pi.

00:00:40.923 --> 00:00:42.961
Now, I wouldn't put four pi here,

00:00:42.961 --> 00:00:45.251
because that would be the entire circle.

00:00:45.251 --> 00:00:47.885
They want the area of just the semicircle,

00:00:47.885 --> 00:00:50.899
of just this region right over here.

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:53.163
Well, the semicircle
is half of the circle,

00:00:53.163 --> 00:00:55.215
so if I want the area of the semicircle,

00:00:55.215 --> 00:00:56.651
this is gonna be half this.

00:00:56.651 --> 00:00:58.099
So instead of four pi,

00:00:58.099 --> 00:01:01.999
it is going to be two pi square units.

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:03.938
That's the area of the semicircle.

00:01:03.938 --> 00:01:06.021
Let's do another example.

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.416
So here, instead of area,

00:01:09.416 --> 00:01:12.839
we're asked to find the arc
length of the partial circle,

00:01:12.839 --> 00:01:15.467
and that's we have here
in this bluish color

00:01:15.467 --> 00:01:18.200
right over here, find this arc length.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.460
And you can see this
is going three fourths

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.915
of the way around the circle,

00:01:22.915 --> 00:01:25.173
so this arc length is going to be

00:01:25.173 --> 00:01:27.597
three fourths of the circumference.

00:01:27.597 --> 00:01:29.374
So what is the circumference?

00:01:29.374 --> 00:01:31.132
Well, we know the circumference

00:01:31.132 --> 00:01:34.132
is equal to two pi times the radius.

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.950
They tell us what the radius is.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.552
It's equal to four, so our circumference

00:01:40.552 --> 00:01:43.052
is equal to two pi times four.

00:01:47.734 --> 00:01:50.049
Let's see, we can just change
the order in which we multiply

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:52.205
so it's two times four times pi.

00:01:52.205 --> 00:01:55.107
This is going to be equal to eight pi.

00:01:55.107 --> 00:01:57.796
This is going to be equal to eight pi.

00:01:57.796 --> 00:02:01.137
Now, that is the circumference
of the entire circle.

00:02:01.137 --> 00:02:03.332
If we care about this arc length,

00:02:03.332 --> 00:02:05.426
it's going to be three fourths times

00:02:05.426 --> 00:02:07.603
the circumference of the entire circle.

00:02:07.603 --> 00:02:10.436
So three over four times eight pi.

00:02:12.298 --> 00:02:14.264
What is that going to be?

00:02:14.264 --> 00:02:17.470
Well, what's three fourths times eight?

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.135
Well, three times eight is
24 divided by four is six.

00:02:22.135 --> 00:02:25.417
So this is going to be equal to six pi.

00:02:25.417 --> 00:02:26.735
Another way to think about it,

00:02:26.735 --> 00:02:28.116
one fourth of eight is two,

00:02:28.116 --> 00:02:31.303
so three fourths is going to be six.

00:02:31.303 --> 00:02:32.462
Or another way to think about it is,

00:02:32.462 --> 00:02:34.941
one fourth of eight pi is two pi,

00:02:34.941 --> 00:02:38.799
and so three of those is
going to be equal to six pi.

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:43.065
So the arc length of the
partial circle is six pi,

00:02:43.065 --> 00:02:44.062
and once again we knew that

00:02:44.062 --> 00:02:45.695
because it was three
fourths of the way around.

00:02:45.695 --> 00:02:46.945
The way that I knew it was three fourths

00:02:46.945 --> 00:02:48.673
is that this is a 90 degree angle.

00:02:48.673 --> 00:02:51.323
This is 90 degrees, which is one fourth

00:02:51.323 --> 00:02:52.997
of the way around a circle,

00:02:52.997 --> 00:02:54.179
so the arc length that we care about

00:02:54.179 --> 00:02:57.679
is the three fourths of our circumference.
