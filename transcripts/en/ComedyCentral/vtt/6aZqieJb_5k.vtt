YESTERDAY, AMERICA DROPPED DOWN

ARGUMENTS THAT COULD SETTLE THE
QUESTION OF MARRIAGE EQUALITY

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:18.718 align:start position:0% line:85%
FOR GAY PEOPLE.

00:00:18.751 --> 00:00:21.687 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THE COURT WILL ANSWER TWO
QUESTIONS-- CAN STATES REFUSE TO

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.491 align:start position:0% line:91%
ISSUE MARRIAGE LICENSES TO
SAME-SEX COUPLES, AND CAN THEY

00:00:25.524 --> 00:00:29.729 line:91%
DECLINE TO RECOGNIZE SAME-SEX
MARRIAGES THAT WERE LEGALLY

00:00:29.762 --> 00:00:32.498 align:start position:0% line:85%
GRANTED SOMEWHERE ELSE.

00:00:32.531 --> 00:00:33.499 line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: AND CAN THE COURT ANSWER
THOSE WHILE TRAVELING THE WORLD.

00:00:33.532 --> 00:00:35.101 align:start position:0% line:91%
THAT'S RIGHT, THE
SUPREME COURT IS HEARING THOSE

00:00:35.134 --> 00:00:39.405 size:88% position:44% line:91%
CASES WHILE PARTICIPATING IN
THIS YEAR'S "AMAZING RACE."

COMFORTABLE ON A ZIP LINE.

00:00:43.042 --> 00:00:44.911 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
OF COURSE, AN ISSUE THIS

00:00:44.944 --> 00:00:47.847 align:start position:0% line:91%
IMPORTANT WAS BOUND TO DRAW A
CROWD, MAKING THEIR FINAL

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.015 align:start position:0% line:85%
ARGUMENTS.

00:00:49.048 --> 00:00:53.786 line:91%
THE PROGAY MARRIAGE CAMP WENT
WITH HOW CAN A JUST GOD NOT

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:56.456 align:start position:0% line:91%
ALLOW TWO MEN THIS INTO BEARD
CARE NOT BE TOGETHER?

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.393 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHILE THE ANTIGAY MARRIAGE CROWD
WENT WITH WHY DON'T WE SUMMON

00:01:00.426 --> 00:01:03.029 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE ANCIENT HEBREWS AND SEE WHAT
THEY SAY?

00:01:03.062 --> 00:01:07.100 align:start position:0% line:91%
BY THE WAY, YES, THAT IS A
SHOFAR, AND YES, THE ANTIGAY MAN

00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:08.801 align:start position:0% line:85%
IS BLOWING IT.

00:01:08.834 --> 00:01:10.803 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )

00:01:10.836 --> 00:01:11.904 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT, IT WOULDN'T -- IRONY. ALL
RIGHT. 

00:01:11.937 --> 00:01:20.980 align:start position:0% line:91%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
BUT IT WOULDN'T BE UP TO THOSE

00:01:21.013 --> 00:01:22.214 align:start position:0% line:85%
OUTSIDE THE COURT.

00:01:22.248 --> 00:01:26.686 line:91%
&gt;&gt; THIS WILL, IN ALL LIKELIHOOD
COME DOWN TO JUSTICE KENNEDY.

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:28.454 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  KENNEDY, KENNEDY,
KENNEDY!

00:01:28.487 --> 00:01:33.826 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE ONLY JUSTICE ANYONE
EVER CARES ABOUT IS KENNEDY.

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:37.563 align:start size:94% position:6% line:91%
HE'S THE MARCIA TO THE
SUPREME COURT'S EIGHT JANS.

00:01:37.596 --> 00:01:38.497 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT TUESDAY'S SESSION WAS MAINLY
A FORUM FOR

00:01:38.531 --> 00:01:40.133 align:start position:0% line:91%
GAY MARRIAGE
OPPONENTS TO AIR THEIR BEST AND

00:01:40.166 --> 00:01:45.938 align:start position:0% line:91%
FINAL ARGUMENTS WHICH WE LOOK AT
IN TONIGHT'S SEGMENT, YOU GOT

00:01:45.971 --> 00:01:48.574 line:91%
NOTHING, SO-CALLED BECAUSE
OPPONENTS OF GAY MARRIAGE GOT

00:01:48.607 --> 00:01:49.675 align:start position:0% line:85%
NOTHING.

00:01:49.708 --> 00:01:51.410 size:88% position:44% line:91%
AND THEY TRIED EVERYTHING,
STARTING WITH THE GOOD, OLD,

00:01:51.443 --> 00:01:52.678 align:start position:0% line:85%
CLASSIC SLIPPERY SLOPE.

00:01:52.711 --> 00:01:59.352 line:91%
&gt;&gt; SUPPOSE WE RULE IN YOUR FAVOR
IN THIS CASE, AND AFTER THAT, A

00:01:59.385 --> 00:02:03.723 line:91%
GROUP CONSISTING OF TWO MEN AND
TWO WOMEN APPLY FOR A MARRIAGE

00:02:03.756 --> 00:02:04.824 align:start position:0% line:85%
LICENSE.

00:02:04.857 --> 00:02:07.426 align:start position:0% line:91%
WOULD THERE BE ANY GROUND FOR
DENYING THEM A LICENSE?

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:09.428 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  WHY SHOULD GAY
PEOPLE HAVE TO ACCOUNT FOR

00:02:09.461 --> 00:02:11.998 align:start position:0% line:91%
ANYONE WHO IS EVER GOING TO WANT
TO GET MARRIED AFTER THEY GET

00:02:12.031 --> 00:02:15.401 align:start position:0% line:85%
THE RIGHT TO MARRY?

00:02:15.434 --> 00:02:20.106 line:91%
WHEN WOMEN FOUGHT FOR SUFFRAGE
NO WAS ONE LIKE WHAT IF ONE DAY

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:21.507 align:start position:0% line:85%
A DOG WANTS TO VOTE.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.242 align:start position:0% line:85%
HOW ABOUT THAT, LADIES?

00:02:23.275 --> 00:02:28.648 align:start position:0% line:91%
BECAUSE NEXT THING YOU KNOW THE
STATE OF OUR UNION IS...

00:02:28.681 --> 00:02:29.616 align:start position:0% line:85%
( BARK )

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:30.216 align:start position:0% line:91%
BY THE WAY, I LIKE THAT THE
SPEAKER IS A CAT.

00:02:30.249 --> 00:02:32.084 size:78% position:39% line:85%
I DON'T KNOW WHY THAT IS.

00:02:32.117 --> 00:02:33.185 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO THAT WAS ONE DUMB ARGUMENT
BUT HARDLY THE ONLY ONE.

00:02:33.218 --> 00:02:37.757 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IF YOU PREVAIL HERE, THERE
WILL BE NO MORE DEBATE.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.959 line:91%
I MEAN, CLOSING THE DEBATE CAN
CLOSE MINDS, AND IT WILL HAVE A

00:02:39.992 --> 00:02:47.099 size:84% position:42% line:91%
CONSEQUENCE ON HOW THIS NEW
INSTITUTION IS ACCEPTED.

00:02:47.132 --> 00:02:49.202 line:91%
PEOPLE FEEL VERY DIFFERENTLY
ABOUT SOMETHING IF THEY HAVE A

00:02:49.235 --> 00:02:53.839 align:start position:0% line:91%
CHANCE TO VOTE ON IT THAN IF
IT'S IMPOSED ON THEM BY-- BY THE

00:02:53.872 --> 00:02:54.640 align:start position:0% line:85%
COURTS.

00:02:54.673 --> 00:02:55.374 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  SURE, NO, THAT MAKES
SENSE.

00:02:55.407 --> 00:02:58.311 align:start position:0% line:91%
IF YOU DON'T IMPOSE GAY
MARRIAGE

00:02:58.344 --> 00:03:01.647 align:start position:0% line:91%
FOLKS LIKE THIS WILL BE MORE
OPEN MINDED.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.583 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
TO EVOLVING THEIR POSITION.

00:03:03.616 --> 00:03:06.118 align:start position:0% line:85%
YEAH, THERE YOU GO.

00:03:06.151 --> 00:03:06.718 align:start position:0% line:85%
SEE.

00:03:06.752 --> 00:03:08.020 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )

00:03:08.053 --> 00:03:08.587 align:start position:0% line:85%
YEAH.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.559 size:75% position:38% line:85%
BUT THE POINT WAS CLEAR.

00:03:13.592 --> 00:03:16.095 align:start position:0% line:91%
THIS CASE THREATENS NOT JUST
MARRIAGE BUT OUR VERY DEMOCRACY.

00:03:16.128 --> 00:03:19.332 line:91%
&gt;&gt; WHEN YOU ENACT SOCIAL CHANGE
OF THIS MAGNITUDE THROUGH THE

00:03:19.365 --> 00:03:22.201 line:91%
FEDERAL COURTS THAT'S NOT THE
WAY THAT OUR DEMOCRATIC PROCESS

00:03:22.234 --> 00:03:25.371 align:start position:0% line:91%
IS SUPPOSED TO WORK, AND THERE
ARE LONG-TERM HARMS TO OUR

00:03:25.404 --> 00:03:29.575 align:start position:0% line:91%
COUNTRY AND TO THAT FUNDAMENTAL
LIBERTY INTEREST TO GOVERN

00:03:29.608 --> 00:03:30.709 align:start position:0% line:85%
OURSELVES.

00:03:30.743 --> 00:03:34.513 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  FIRST OF ALL, LET
ME JUST SAY I LOVE YOUR LAWYER

00:03:34.546 --> 00:03:35.113 align:start position:0% line:85%
COSTUME.

00:03:35.147 --> 00:03:42.555 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )

00:03:42.588 --> 00:03:45.625 align:start position:0% line:91%
SECONDLY, IT'S BALLS FOR A YOUNG
GUY TO WALK INTO THE SUPREME

00:03:45.658 --> 00:03:49.295 line:91%
COURT AND SAY I KNOW YOU THINK
MARBURY VERSUS MADISON GIVES

00:03:49.328 --> 00:03:51.097 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU THE RIGHT TO DECIDE THE
CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTIONS BUT I

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:52.865 line:85%
SAY WE'RE A DIRECT DEMOCRACY.

00:03:52.898 --> 00:03:58.838 line:91%
NOW, WHICH ONE OF YOU PRICKS IS
GOING TO BUY ME BOOZE, I'M 19?

00:03:58.871 --> 00:03:59.972 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
BUT HERE'S THE THING.

00:04:00.006 --> 00:04:03.175 line:91%
WE HAVE BOTH A FUNDAMENTAL
LIBERTY TO GOVERN AND A COURT

00:04:03.208 --> 00:04:07.847 align:start position:0% line:91%
EMPOWERED TO STOP US FROM
ABUSING THAT LIBERTY TO TAKE

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:08.848 align:start position:0% line:85%
OTHER PEOPLE'S LIBERTY.

00:04:08.881 --> 00:04:10.116 size:88% position:44% line:85%
THAT'S HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS.

00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:12.184 line:91%
AND IF YOU DON'T AGREE WITH THE
COURT'S DECISION, WELL THEN YOU

00:04:12.217 --> 00:04:15.254 size:78% position:39% line:91%
JUST HAVE TO SUCK IT UP,
SOMETIMES FOR YEARS, WITH

00:04:15.287 --> 00:04:17.290 align:start position:0% line:85%
HORRIBLE CONSEQUENCES.

00:04:17.323 --> 00:04:20.393 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )

00:04:20.426 --> 00:04:21.794 line:85%
SO ENOUGH WITH THE DEMOCRACY!

00:04:21.827 --> 00:04:24.797 align:start position:0% line:85%
ENOUGH!

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.701 line:91%
CAN A BROTHER GET A LAME APPEAL
TO HISTORY ARGUMENT UP IN HERE?

00:04:28.734 --> 00:04:31.904 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; EVERY DEFINITION THAT I
LOOKED UP PRIOR TO ABOUT A DOZEN

00:04:31.937 --> 00:04:35.441 size:81% position:41% line:91%
YEARS AGO DEFINED MARRIAGE
AS THE UNITY BETWEEN A MAN

00:04:35.474 --> 00:04:37.276 line:85%
AND A WOMAN AS HUSBAND AND WIFE.

00:04:37.309 --> 00:04:40.946 line:91%
OBVIOUSLY, IF YOU SUCCEED, THAT
CORE DEFINITION WILL NO LONGER

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:41.847 align:start position:0% line:85%
BE OPERABLE.

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.383 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU'RE NOT SEEKING TO JOIN
THE INSTITUTION.

00:04:44.416 --> 00:04:46.819 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU'RE SEEKING TO CHANGE WHAT
THE INSTITUTION IS.

00:04:46.852 --> 00:04:51.457 line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  THE INSTITUTION OF
MARRIAGE HAS ALMOST NEVER NOT

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:52.591 align:start position:0% line:85%
BEEN CHANGING.

00:04:52.625 --> 00:04:54.994 align:start position:0% line:91%
BEFORE THE LAST CENTURY,
MARRIAGE WASN'T ONE MAN AND ONE

00:04:55.027 --> 00:04:56.062 align:start position:0% line:85%
WOMAN.

00:04:56.095 --> 00:04:59.732 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT WAS ONE MAN AND HIS NEW PIECE
OF VAGINA PROPERTY.

00:04:59.765 --> 00:05:01.801 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
CHANGE CAN BE GOOD.

00:05:01.834 --> 00:05:06.572 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
BUT THE ANTIGAY CRAY-CRAY--

00:05:06.605 --> 00:05:08.374 align:start position:0% line:91%
( APPLAUSE )
PROBABLY PEAKED WITH THIS

00:05:08.407 --> 00:05:10.009 align:start position:0% line:91%
DISCUSSION ABOUT THE POINT OF
MARRIAGE ITSELF.

00:05:10.042 --> 00:05:13.212 align:start size:94% position:6% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IF YOU'RE CHANGING THE
MEANING OF MARRIAGE FROM ONE

00:05:13.245 --> 00:05:16.315 line:91%
WHERE IT'S BASED ON THE
BIOLOGICAL BOND TO ONE

00:05:16.348 --> 00:05:19.018 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHERE IT'S BASED ON EMOTIONAL
COMMITMENT, THEN ADULTS

00:05:19.051 --> 00:05:23.022 align:start position:0% line:91%
COULD THINK, RIGHTLY, THAT THIS
RELATIONSHIP IS MORE ABOUT

00:05:23.055 --> 00:05:23.422 line:85%
ADULTS AND NOT ABOUT THE KIDS.

00:05:23.456 --> 00:05:24.323 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  WHOA!

00:05:24.357 --> 00:05:28.728 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
GAY MARRIAGE ISN'T ABOUT KIDS?

00:05:28.761 --> 00:05:33.733 align:start position:0% line:91%
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO PARK
SLOPE?

00:05:33.766 --> 00:05:35.067 align:start position:0% line:85%
OH, LOOK!

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:40.072 size:84% position:42% line:91%
THE ELIZABETHS HAVE THE NEW
DYSON UPPA BABY XL HOVER

00:05:40.105 --> 00:05:41.273 align:start position:0% line:85%
CARRIAGE.

00:05:41.306 --> 00:05:44.310 align:start position:0% line:91%
THAT WON'T BE HARD TO CLIMB OVER
TO GET INTO BEANS AND SUCH.

00:05:44.343 --> 00:05:48.981 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
BUT, ALL RIGHT, LET'S PLAY THIS

00:05:49.014 --> 00:05:49.915 align:start position:0% line:85%
OUT.

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:52.918 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; SUPPOSE THAT THERE'S A STATE
WITH A VERY

00:05:52.951 --> 00:05:54.553 align:start position:0% line:91%
PRO-CREATION-CENTERED VIEW OF
MARRIAGE OF THE KIND THAT YOU'RE

00:05:54.586 --> 00:05:55.721 align:start position:0% line:85%
TALKING ABOUT.

00:05:55.754 --> 00:05:57.690 line:91%
SO WHEN PEOPLE COME IN AND ASK
FOR A MARRIAGE LICENSE, THEY

00:05:57.723 --> 00:06:00.025 align:start position:0% line:91%
JUST ASK A SIMPLE QUESTION, "DO
YOU WANT CHILDREN?"

00:06:00.058 --> 00:06:03.129 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND IF THE ANSWER IS NO, THE
STATE SAYS, "NO MARRIAGE LICENSE

00:06:03.162 --> 00:06:04.230 align:start position:0% line:85%
FOR YOU."

00:06:04.263 --> 00:06:06.098 line:85%
WOULD THAT BE CONSTITUTIONAL?

00:06:06.131 --> 00:06:09.602 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  OH SNAP, THAT WAS VERY
RABBINICAL.

00:06:09.635 --> 00:06:10.703 align:start position:0% line:85%
SOMEWHAT OBTUSE.

00:06:10.736 --> 00:06:17.309 size:81% position:41% line:91%
ANYONE WANT TO TAKE A MORE
PRACTICAL SWING AT THIS?

00:06:17.342 --> 00:06:20.846 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; SUPPOSE A 70-YEAR-OLD COUPLE
COMES IN AND THEY WANT--

( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )

00:06:24.082 --> 00:06:30.923 align:start position:0% line:91%

&gt;&gt; Jon:  AND THIS

00:06:30.956 --> 00:06:34.860 line:91%
70-YEAR-OLD COUPLE, NO MATTER
HOW MUCH THEY'RE ( BLEEP ), AND

00:06:34.893 --> 00:06:41.534 line:91%
THEY'RE ( BLEEP ) A LOT -- IN
THE SIT-DOWN SHOWER, ON THAT--

00:06:41.567 --> 00:06:48.307 line:91%
ON THAT ELECTRIC STAIR CHAIR,

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:50.276 size:75% position:38% line:85%
THEY'RE NOT HAVING KIDS.

00:06:50.309 --> 00:06:57.416 align:start position:0% line:91%
IS THEIRS NOT A CONSTITUTIONALLY
WORTHY ( BLEEP )-FEST FILLED

00:06:57.449 --> 00:07:00.152 align:start position:0% line:85%
LOVE AS WELL?

00:07:00.185 --> 00:07:03.722 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
BUT FAIR QUESTION.

00:07:03.755 --> 00:07:08.160 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHAT IF-- WHAT IF A COUPLE OF
70-YEAR-OLDS WANT TO GET
