Ang, no, he has no clue.

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.772
I can't wait to see his face.

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:07.674
 I know, okay,
 we're in the other room.

00:00:07.841 --> 00:00:08.875
 I'm gonna bring everybody in
 in just a minute.

00:00:09.042 --> 00:00:10.377
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

00:00:10.543 --> 00:00:11.378
Okay, I have to go,
thank you.

00:00:11.544 --> 00:00:13.113
Okay, bye.

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:14.914
(man)
Happy birthday, bro.

00:00:15.081 --> 00:00:16.516
Huh, check it out.

00:00:16.683 --> 00:00:18.418
(man 2)
Yeah, wow, thanks, man.

00:00:18.585 --> 00:00:20.553
(man)
Hey, it's too bad
Amy couldn't be here, right?

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.322
Hey, are you gonna make it
official with her soon?

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:23.857
(man 2)
What?

00:00:24.024 --> 00:00:25.158
(man)
Come on, old man,

00:00:25.325 --> 00:00:26.593
seven years is a long time.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:27.827
(man 2)
No.

00:00:27.994 --> 00:00:29.596
I mean, at this point,

00:00:29.763 --> 00:00:30.964
I feel like Amy's more
just like a friend.

00:00:31.131 --> 00:00:33.166
Yeah.

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:35.502
I don't know,
something just changed.

00:00:35.668 --> 00:00:37.170
Like, I'm just done.

00:00:37.337 --> 00:00:39.005
You ever feel like
you're just done?

00:00:39.172 --> 00:00:39.939
Yeah, is it because
of all the weight she gained?

00:00:40.106 --> 00:00:41.674
No.

00:00:41.841 --> 00:00:43.643
I mean, she's definitely
put on some pounds,

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:45.145
but that's not even it.

00:00:45.311 --> 00:00:46.813
Yeah.
Is it the long distance?

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.982
No, long distance
is the only reason

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:50.050
we're still together now.

00:00:50.216 --> 00:00:51.918
Yeah, oh, man.

00:00:52.085 --> 00:00:53.820
It just-- something turned,

00:00:53.987 --> 00:00:55.855
you know, just everything
about her makes me sick.

00:00:56.022 --> 00:00:57.323
Just like, shut up.

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:58.858
I can't take it.

00:00:59.025 --> 00:01:00.260
(Angie)
Come in, everybody.

00:01:00.427 --> 00:01:01.561
(man 2)
Hey, Angie.

00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:02.929
(man)
What's this?

00:01:03.096 --> 00:01:04.531
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no...

00:01:04.697 --> 00:01:05.799
(Angie)
Come on, get ready, okay?

00:01:05.965 --> 00:01:07.267
Ready? One, two, three.

00:01:07.434 --> 00:01:08.601

♪ Happy Birth-- ♪

00:01:08.768 --> 00:01:09.836
Amy?

00:01:10.003 --> 00:01:11.371
What are you doing here?

00:01:11.538 --> 00:01:12.672
When did you
get back from Iraq?

00:01:12.839 --> 00:01:15.208
This isn't working for me.

00:01:15.375 --> 00:01:18.478
I, I think we should
see other people.

00:01:18.645 --> 00:01:20.547
I met somebody else.

00:01:20.713 --> 00:01:22.849
And so I made the decision,

00:01:23.016 --> 00:01:24.584
I don't wanna
see you any more.

00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:27.220
And this was over.

00:01:27.387 --> 00:01:28.922
I paid for this,
I'm bringing it.

00:01:29.089 --> 00:01:30.090
No.

00:01:30.256 --> 00:01:33.093
Step away from it!

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:36.262
I'm having somebody
come back and get this.
