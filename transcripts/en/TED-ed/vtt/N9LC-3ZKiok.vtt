00:00:06.585 --> 00:00:08.826
What if I told you that all illnesses,

00:00:08.826 --> 00:00:11.920
things like the cold, 
the flu, strep throat,

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.960
came from wandering 
clouds of poisonous vapor?

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.812
You'd probably think that absurd,
and, don't worry, it's completely wrong.

00:00:19.812 --> 00:00:25.083
Yet that's actually what people thought
caused diseases for several centuries.

00:00:25.083 --> 00:00:26.831
They called it miasma theory,

00:00:26.831 --> 00:00:30.969
and everyone from the public
to the medical establishment accepted it.

00:00:30.969 --> 00:00:35.785
But by the 1840s, in the midst of
devastating cholera outbreaks in London,

00:00:35.785 --> 00:00:39.227
a small group of scientists 
had grown skeptical.

00:00:39.227 --> 00:00:43.464
Early microscopes had revealed
the existence of tiny microorganisms,

00:00:43.464 --> 00:00:48.513
and they proposed that it was actually
these germs that cause diseases,

00:00:48.513 --> 00:00:50.877
hence the name germ theory.

00:00:50.877 --> 00:00:53.154
Though most people held 
onto their assumptions

00:00:53.154 --> 00:00:55.316
and strongly resisted this theory,

00:00:55.316 --> 00:00:58.169
its supporters were determined 
to prove them wrong

00:00:58.169 --> 00:01:00.222
by collecting compelling data.

00:01:00.222 --> 00:01:04.152
Leading the charge was a physician
named Dr. John Snow.

00:01:04.152 --> 00:01:07.734
Dr. Snow observed that 
cholera-infected patients

00:01:07.734 --> 00:01:11.375
experienced severe vomiting and diarrhea,

00:01:11.375 --> 00:01:14.514
symptoms of the gut 
as opposed to the lungs,

00:01:14.514 --> 00:01:18.777
and thought that perhaps the disease
was transmitted through food or drink,

00:01:18.777 --> 00:01:20.353
not the air.

00:01:20.353 --> 00:01:22.417
After investigating previous outbreaks,

00:01:22.417 --> 00:01:23.602
he became convinced

00:01:23.602 --> 00:01:28.230
that cholera was spread
through contaminated water sources.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.827
Then, late in the summer of 1854

00:01:30.827 --> 00:01:34.013
when cholera suddenly struck
the Soho district,

00:01:34.013 --> 00:01:36.743
a neighborhood in London
very close to his own,

00:01:36.743 --> 00:01:39.695
Dr. Snow was hot on its trail.

00:01:39.695 --> 00:01:41.879
He requested the records for the deceased,

00:01:41.879 --> 00:01:46.730
and within the first week,
there had already been 83 deaths.

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.369
He mapped out where each 
of the deceased had lived

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:55.697
and found that 73 of them resided
close to the water pump on Broad Street.

00:01:55.697 --> 00:01:58.649
Dr. Snow strongly recommended 
shutting down the pump,

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.242
and because he knew how unpopular
germ theory was,

00:02:02.242 --> 00:02:05.839
he suggested that cholera was spread
through a poison in the water

00:02:05.839 --> 00:02:07.749
instead of microorganisms,

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:11.210
when presenting his case
to governmental officials.

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:12.552
They were unconvinced,

00:02:12.552 --> 00:02:16.604
but agreed to shut down the pump
as an extra precaution.

00:02:16.604 --> 00:02:21.129
Almost immediately, 
new cases of infection subsided.

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:22.742
Bolstered by his success,

00:02:22.742 --> 00:02:26.363
Dr. Snow was determined to connect
the contaminated pump water

00:02:26.363 --> 00:02:28.042
to the disease.

00:02:28.042 --> 00:02:31.183
He found the story of a widow 
who had died of cholera

00:02:31.183 --> 00:02:33.469
and lived far away from Soho,

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:38.209
but had a servant bring her water
from the Broad Street pump daily

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.339
because she liked the taste.

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:41.748
He also discovered a workhouse

00:02:41.748 --> 00:02:44.803
located around the corner 
from the Broad Street pump

00:02:44.803 --> 00:02:49.106
that housed hundreds of people,
but only a handful had become infected,

00:02:49.106 --> 00:02:51.360
which Dr. Snow attributed to the fact

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.699
that the workhouse 
had its own private well.

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:57.462
Finally, Dr. Snow heard of an infant

00:02:57.462 --> 00:03:01.255
who may have been one 
of the earliest victims of the outbreak.

00:03:01.255 --> 00:03:03.374
He learned that the child's dirty diapers

00:03:03.374 --> 00:03:05.462
had been thrown into a cesspool

00:03:05.462 --> 00:03:09.546
right next to the public water pump
on Broad Street.

00:03:09.546 --> 00:03:12.232
Again, Dr. Snow presented his case,

00:03:12.232 --> 00:03:15.284
but even then, 
city officials spurned his theory,

00:03:15.284 --> 00:03:20.133
not wanting to admit that there 
was human waste in London's water supply,

00:03:20.133 --> 00:03:22.862
or that they were wrong 
about miasma theory,

00:03:22.862 --> 00:03:25.817
which was, after all, 
hundreds of years old.

00:03:25.817 --> 00:03:29.609
It wasn't until 1884 
that Dr. Snow's efforts

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:32.473
were vindicated by Dr. Robert Koch,

00:03:32.473 --> 00:03:35.324
who isolated 
the cholera-causing bacterium.

00:03:35.324 --> 00:03:39.020
Koch developed a technique 
to grow pure cultures,

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:40.907
and through a series of experiments,

00:03:40.907 --> 00:03:44.125
definitively proved 
that a specific bacterium

00:03:44.125 --> 00:03:46.888
directly cause disease.

00:03:46.888 --> 00:03:48.620
Major contributions to germ theory

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.347
also came from prolific scientist 
Louis Pasteur,

00:03:52.347 --> 00:03:57.453
whose study of microorganisms led
to the development of the first vaccines.

00:03:57.453 --> 00:04:00.061
By challenging assumptions 
with data-driven research,

00:04:00.061 --> 00:04:03.302
these scientists discredited
an age-old theory

00:04:03.302 --> 00:04:08.438
and sparked a revolution that was
incredibly beneficial to public health.

00:04:08.438 --> 00:04:10.136
But all of this raises the question,

00:04:10.136 --> 00:04:14.242
what are the widely held 
scientific beliefs of today

00:04:14.242 --> 00:04:17.271
that our descendants will find ridiculous?

00:04:17.271 --> 00:04:19.724
And as any scientist would tell you,

00:04:19.724 --> 00:04:22.924
a question is an excellent place to start.
