00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.940
Let's say that we've
got some function

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:09.410
f that is continuous
on the interval a to b.

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:12.480
So let's try to see if
we can visualize that.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.816
So this is my y-axis.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.600
This right over here, I
want to make it my t-axis.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.050
We'll use x little bit later.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.820
So I'll call this my t-axis.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:26.720
And then let's say that
this right over here

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.025
is the graph of y
is equal to f of t.

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.670
And we're saying it's continuous
on the interval from a to b.

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.880
So this is t is equal to a.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.800
This is t is equal to b.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.320
So we're saying that
it is continuous

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.350
over this whole interval.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:51.580
Now, for fun, let's define
a function capital F of x.

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.670
And I will do it in blue.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.810
Let's define capital F of x as
equal to the definite integral

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:06.630
from a is a lower
bound to x of f of t--

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.460
let me do that in--
of f of t dt, where

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:19.500
x is in this interval, where
a is less than or equal to x

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.371
is less than or equal to b.

00:01:21.371 --> 00:01:22.870
Or that's just
another way of saying

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.390
that x is in this
interval right over here.

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.360
Now, when you see this,
you might say, oh,

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.017
the definite integral, this
has to do with differentiation

00:01:31.017 --> 00:01:32.350
an antiderivatives and all that.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:33.910
But we don't know that yet.

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.890
All we know right
now is that this

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:43.150
is the area under the curve f
between a and x, so between a,

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.250
and let's say this
right over here is x.

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:53.620
So f of x is just this
area right over here.

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.660
That's all we know about it.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.560
We don't know it has anything
to do with antiderivatives just

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.060
yet.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.800
That's what we're going to
try to prove in this video.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.312
So just for fun, let's
take the derivative of f.

00:02:06.312 --> 00:02:07.770
And we're going to
do it just using

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.949
the definition of
derivatives and see

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:12.520
what we get when we take
the derivative using

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.950
the definition of derivatives.

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.230
So the derivative, f prime
of x-- well this definition

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.790
of derivatives, it's the
limit as delta x approaches

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:31.940
0 of capital F of x
plus delta x minus f

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.620
of x, all of that over delta x.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.450
This is just the definition
of the derivative.

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.611
Now, what is this equal to?

00:02:43.611 --> 00:02:46.110
Well, let me rewrite it using
these integrals right up here.

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.620
This is going to be
equal to the limit

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:58.790
as delta x approaches 0 of--
what's f of x plus delta x?

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.670
Well, put x in right over here.

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.330
You're going to get the definite
integral from a to x plus delta

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.360
x of f of t dt.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.990
And then from
that, you are going

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:17.450
to subtract this business,
f of x, which we've already

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:24.870
written as the definite integral
from a to x of f of t dt,

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.700
and then all of that
is over delta x.

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:34.866
Now, what does this represent?

00:03:34.866 --> 00:03:37.240
Remember, we don't know anything
about definite integrals

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.560
or somehow dealing
with something

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.060
with an antiderivative
and all that.

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.870
We just know this is
another way of saying

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.630
the area under the curve f
between a and x plus delta x.

00:03:53.630 --> 00:04:00.620
So it's this entire
area right over here.

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.460
So that's this part.

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:06.090
We already know what
this blue stuff is.

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.830
Let me do it in that
same shade of blue.

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.420
So this blue stuff
right over here,

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.650
this is equal to all
of this business.

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:15.920
We've already shaded this in.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.070
It's equal to all of this
business right over here.

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.130
So if you were to take all
of this green area, which

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.730
is from a to x plus
delta x, and subtract out

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:26.500
the blue area, which
is exactly what we're

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.420
doing in the numerator
what are you're left with?

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.450
Well, you're going to
be left with-- what

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.280
color have I not used yet?

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.381
Maybe I will use
this pink color.

00:04:36.381 --> 00:04:37.630
Well, no, I already used that.

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:38.754
I'll use this purple color.

00:04:38.754 --> 00:04:43.340
You're going to be left with
this area right over here.

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.490
So what's another
way of writing that?

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.450
Well, another way of writing
this area right over here

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:51.870
is the definite
integral between x and x

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:58.550
plus delta x of f of t dt.

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.350
So we can rewrite this entire
expression, the derivative

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.020
of capital F of x--
this is capital F

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.960
prime of x-- we can rewrite it
now as being equal to the limit

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.530
as delta x approaches
0-- this I can write as 1

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.932
over delta x times
the numerator.

00:05:16.932 --> 00:05:18.640
And we already figured
out the numerator.

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:22.170
The green area minus the blue
area is just the purple area,

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:24.510
and another way of
denoting that area

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:26.520
is this expression
right over here.

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.680
So 1 over delta x times
the definite integral

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:38.200
from x to x plus
delta x of f of t dt.

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.650
Now, this expression
is interesting.

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.680
This might look familiar
from the mean value

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.220
theorem of definite integrals.

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:48.570
The mean value theorem
of definite integrals

00:05:48.570 --> 00:06:10.360
tells us there exists
a c in the interval

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.990
see where-- I'll
write it this way--

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:18.394
where a is less than or equal
to c, which is less than--

00:06:18.394 --> 00:06:19.810
or actually, let
me make it clear.

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:22.110
The interval that we care
about is between x and x

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:26.620
plus delta x--
where x is less than

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:28.370
or equal to c,
which is less than

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:36.940
or equal to x plus delta x,
such that the function evaluated

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:40.710
at c-- so let me draw this c.

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:43.210
So there's a c
someplace over here--

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:46.240
so if I were take the
function evaluated at this c--

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.999
so that's f of c
right over here.

00:06:48.999 --> 00:06:50.790
So if I were to take
the function evaluated

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:52.206
at this c, which
would essentially

00:06:52.206 --> 00:06:55.520
be the height of this line,
and I multiply times the base,

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.960
this interval, if I multiply
it times the interval--

00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:59.860
and this interval
is just delta x. x

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:02.420
plus delta x minus
x is just delta x.

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:07.140
So if we just multiply
the height times the base,

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:14.180
this is going to be equal to
the area under the curve, which

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:24.010
is the definite integral from x
to x plus delta x of f of t dt.

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:27.320
This is what the mean value
theorem of integrals tells us.

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:29.160
If f is a continuous
function, there

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:34.460
exists a c in this interval
between our two end points

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:37.820
where the function evaluated
at the c is essentially,

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:39.530
you could view it
as the mean height.

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:41.650
And if you take that mean
value of the function

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:43.180
and you multiply
it times the base,

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:44.810
you're going to get
the area of the curve.

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:46.184
Or another way of
rewriting this,

00:07:46.184 --> 00:07:49.770
you could say that there exists
a c in that interval where

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:53.450
f of c is equal to 1 over
delta x-- I'm just dividing

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:57.840
both sides by delta x-- times
the definite integral from x

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:02.530
to x plus delta x of f of t dt.

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:05.024
And this is often
viewed as the mean value

00:08:05.024 --> 00:08:06.440
of the function
over the interval.

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:07.410
Why is that?

00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:11.410
Well, this part right over
here gives you the area,

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:13.170
and then you divide
the area by the base,

00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:14.892
and you get the mean height.

00:08:14.892 --> 00:08:16.350
Or another way you
could say it is,

00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:18.850
if you were to take the height
right over here, multiply it

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:20.790
times the base, you
get a rectangle that

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:24.560
has the exact same area as
the area under the curve.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.330
Well, this is
useful, because this

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:30.430
is exactly what we got as the
derivative of f prime of x.

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:34.330
So there must exist
a c such that f of c

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:35.370
is equal to this stuff.

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:38.770
Or we could say that the limit--
and let me rewrite all of this

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:39.919
now in a new color.

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:47.640
So there exists a
c in the interval

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:56.250
x to x plus delta x where
f prime of x, which we know

00:08:56.250 --> 00:09:00.330
is equal to this, we can now
say is now equal to the limit

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:02.920
as delta x approaches 0.

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:04.420
And instead of
writing this, we know

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:07.920
that there's some c that's
equal to all of this business,

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:10.420
of f of c.

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:12.370
Now we're in the home stretch.

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:14.870
We just have to figure out
what the limit as delta x

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:17.790
approaches 0 of f of c is.

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:20.570
And the main realization is
this part right over here.

00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:24.690
We know that c is always
sandwiched in between x and x

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:25.960
plus delta x.

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:27.750
And intuitively, you
can tell that, look,

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:33.450
as delta x approaches 0, as
this green line right over here

00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:36.800
moves more and more to
the left, as it approaches

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:43.750
this blue line, the c
has to be in between,

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:46.280
and so the c is
going to approach x.

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:51.180
So we know intuitively
that c approaches

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:56.890
x as delta x approaches 0.

00:09:56.890 --> 00:10:00.120
Or another way of
saying it is that f of c

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:07.200
is going to approach f of
x as delta x approaches 0.

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:09.350
And so intuitively,
we could say that this

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:14.129
is going to be equal to f of x.

00:10:14.129 --> 00:10:15.920
Now, you might say,
OK, that's intuitively,

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.086
but we're kind of working
on a little bit of a proof

00:10:18.086 --> 00:10:18.880
here, Sal.

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:21.310
Let me know for sure that
x is going to approach c.

00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:23.846
Don't just do this little thing
where you drew this diagram

00:10:23.846 --> 00:10:25.220
and it makes sense
that c's going

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:26.950
to have to get closer
and closer to x.

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:28.650
And if you want
that, you could just

00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:30.449
resort to the squeeze theorem.

00:10:30.449 --> 00:10:31.990
And to resort to
the squeeze theorem,

00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:34.610
you just have to view c
as a function of delta x.

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:35.340
And it really is.

00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:37.923
Depending on your delta x, c's
going to be further to the left

00:10:37.923 --> 00:10:39.470
or to the right, possibly.

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:41.450
And so I can just
rewrite this expression

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:46.980
as x is less than or equal to c
as a function of delta x, which

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:50.030
is less than or equal
to x plus delta x.

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:53.020
So now you see that c is always
sandwiched between x and x

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:54.320
plus delta x.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:58.775
But what's the limit of x
as delta x approaches 0?

00:10:58.775 --> 00:11:01.040
Well, x isn't dependent
on delta x in any way,

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:03.500
so this is just going
to be equal to x.

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:10.600
What's the limit of x plus
delta x as delta x approaches 0?

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:12.200
Well, as delta x
approaches 0, this

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:14.150
is just going to be equal to x.

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:17.370
So if this approaches
as delta x approaches 0,

00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:19.190
and it's less than
this function,

00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:22.080
and if this approaches x
as delta x approaches 0,

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:23.950
and it's always
greater than this,

00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:27.000
then we know from the squeeze
theorem or the sandwich theorem

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.860
that the limit as
delta x approaches

00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:34.180
0 of c as a function
of delta x is

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:38.480
going to be equal to x as well.

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:40.940
It has to approach the same
thing that that and that is.

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:42.950
It's sandwiched in between.

00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:45.160
And so that's a slight--
we resort to the sandwich

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:46.951
theorem-- it's a little
bit more rigorous--

00:11:46.951 --> 00:11:48.580
to get to this exact result.

00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:52.820
As delta x approaches
0, c approaches x.

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:57.910
If c is approaching x, then f of
c is going to approach f of x.

00:11:57.910 --> 00:12:00.850
And then we essentially
have our proof.

00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:02.250
F is a continuous function.

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:06.820
We defined capital
F in this way,

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:10.500
and we were able to use just
the definition of the derivative

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:14.130
to figure out that the
derivative of capital F of x

00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:21.500
is equal to f of x.

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:25.080
And once again, why
is this a big deal?

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:27.770
Well, it tells you that if you
have any continuous function

00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:29.090
f-- and that's what we assume.

00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:32.880
We assume that f is continuous
over the interval-- there

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:35.460
exists some function--
you can just

00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:37.340
define the function
this way as the area

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:41.170
under the curve between some
endpoint, or the beginning

00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:43.450
of the interval, and
sum x-- if you define

00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:46.190
a function in that way, the
derivative of this function

00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:49.130
is going to be equal to
your continuous function.

00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:51.610
Or another way of saying
it is that you always

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:55.020
have an antiderivative, that
any continuous function has

00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:56.440
an antiderivative.

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:58.070
And so it's a couple
of cool things.

00:12:58.070 --> 00:13:00.250
Any continuous function
has an antiderivative.

00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:03.925
It's going to be
that capital F of x.

00:13:03.925 --> 00:13:06.050
And this is why it's called
the fundamental theorem

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:07.090
of calculus.

00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:09.500
It ties together
these two ideas.

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:11.250
And you have
differential calculus.

00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:14.760
You have the idea
of a derivative.

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:16.210
And then in integral
calculus, you

00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:17.910
have the idea of an integral.

00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:20.670
Before this proof, all
we viewed an integral

00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:22.596
as is the area under the curve.

00:13:22.596 --> 00:13:24.220
It was just literally
a notation to say

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:26.330
the area under the curve.

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:29.050
But now we've been able to
make a connection that there's

00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:31.670
a connection between the
integral and the derivative,

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:34.680
or a connection between the
integral and the antiderivative

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:35.510
in particular.

00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:40.170
So it connects all of calculus
together in a very, very, very

00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:42.490
powerful-- and we're
so used to it now,

00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:44.694
and now we can say almost
a somewhat obvious way,

00:13:44.694 --> 00:13:45.610
but it wasn't obvious.

00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:47.060
Remember, we always
think of integrals

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:48.518
as somehow doing
an antiderivative,

00:13:48.518 --> 00:13:49.620
but it wasn't clear.

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:51.662
If you just viewed an
integral as only an area,

00:13:51.662 --> 00:13:53.370
you would have to go
through this process

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:57.600
to say, wow, no, it's connected
to the process of taking

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.450
a derivative.
