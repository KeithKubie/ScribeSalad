00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.400
"Stand": Peace on this planet

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.400
Or guns glowing hot,

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.080
We lay there as if we were

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.620
Getting something done. It

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.280
Felt like planting

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.180
A garden or planning

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:17.640
A meal for a people

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.460
Who still need feeding,

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.320
All that touching or

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.258
Barely touching, not

00:00:24.258 --> 00:00:27.520
Saying much, not adding

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.920
Anything. The cushion

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.700
Of it, the skin and

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.160
Occasional sigh, all

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.980
Seemed like work worth

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.140
Mastering. I'm sure

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.200
Somebody died while

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.340
We made love. Some-

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.240
Body killed somebody

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.840
Black. I thought then

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.380
Of holding you

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.560
As a political act.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.320
I May as well have

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.120
Held myself. We didn't

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.220
Stand for one thought,

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.600
Didn't do a damn thing,

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.240
And though you left me,

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.820
I'm glad we
didn't.
