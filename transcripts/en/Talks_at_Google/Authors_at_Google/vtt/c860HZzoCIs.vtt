00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.968
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:11.302 --> 00:00:12.260
JOSHUA HUNT: Thank you.

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:17.930
So I want to begin with a
little exercise in imagination.

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.070
I want you guys to imagine, if
you can, what a huge scandal

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.560
it might be if "The New
York Times" discovered

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.370
that the CEO of Google
had been quietly paying

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:33.170
$40,000 a year directly towards
the salary of the president

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.670
of a major American public
research university.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.740
I think there would
probably be a lot of outrage

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.770
over a story like that.

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.580
I think there would be headlines
about unchecked corporate power

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.610
and overreach in Silicon Valley.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.940
And I think journalists
would begin reporting on

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.380
whether or not the president
of this hypothetical university

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:04.019
might have done things, made
decisions, or crafted policy

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.380
that was more in favor
of Google's interests

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.850
than the interests of his
faculty or his students.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.920
After all, this
hypothetical university

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.340
has some very lucrative
business dealings with Google

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.970
in this imaginary scenario.

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.840
Now we're going to imagine
something even more concerning.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.420
The university
president that we're

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.620
imagining runs a nonprofit
organization that's

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.000
dedicated to funding research to
find a cure for a disease that

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.290
has already killed two of his
daughters and that will kill--

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.610
he's told by doctors-- will
kill his last living daughter.

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.150
And it turns out
the CEO of Google

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.650
has been secretly giving
money to this nonprofit

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.830
directly, sometimes $1 million
a year, sometimes $2 million

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.940
a year, directly towards this
nonprofit organization that

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.700
is doing good work,
but that is directly

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.240
benefiting the president of
this university in a very

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.120
personal capacity.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.600
These financial
gifts are secret,

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.540
even though the
university president

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.030
is in charge of a
public institution

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.959
and even though he
is supposed to be--

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:21.500
even though his
dealings are supposed

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.410
to be open to public scrutiny.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.380
And now the most
alarming part of all,

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.070
a member of this university
president's own family--

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.700
sorry, household-- a member
of this university president's

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.230
household has come forward and
said that this public servant

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.270
once took sides
against his own student

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:46.680
body and his own faculty simply
because the CEO that was giving

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.720
all this money to his
nonprofit organization

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.090
said the flow of
funds would stop

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.060
if he didn't put an
end to these protests

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.130
on campus, which were aimed
at highlighting his company's

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.134
poor human rights
record overseas.

00:03:03.134 --> 00:03:04.550
This is the part
where we can stop

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.330
relying on our imagination,
because the company was not

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.070
Google, but Nike.

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.290
The university was
not hypothetical.

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.230
It was the University of Oregon.

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.710
The university
president was a man

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:19.370
named Dave Frohnmayer, a former
attorney general of Oregon

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.060
whose face you might recognize
if you watched the documentary

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.860
"Wild Wild Country" on Netflix.

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.050
All of this really happened.

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.530
And it began unfolding
about two decades ago,

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.280
two and a half decades
ago, after Oregonians

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.100
passed a really crippling piece
of legislation called Ballot

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.960
Measure 5, which was aimed at
slashing property taxes, which

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.320
up until that point had done
most of the heavy lifting

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.960
in terms of funding public
education in Oregon.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.380
This pitted K
through 12 education,

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:59.360
public K through 12 education,
against public higher education

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.400
in Oregon, and it led Dave
Frohnmayer and the University

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.960
of Oregon to go looking for
private funds-- outside money,

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.280
as he called it--

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.730
in order to fund the
university that he ran.

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.640
And in this case, the
donor that he courted

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.660
was Nike and its
CEO, Phil Knight,

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.260
who was the most illustrious
and successful alum

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.430
of the University of Oregon.

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.650
Outside of Silicon Valley,
and I suppose outside of here

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.890
in Kirkland, a lot
of fun has been

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:39.810
had over Google's old
slogan, Don't Be Evil,

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.270
but I think it's
interesting to consider

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.336
why a corporation
founded in 1998

00:04:45.336 --> 00:04:46.710
might have felt
the need for such

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.280
a mantra in the first place.

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.710
One possible explanation,
I would argue,

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.230
might be suggested by
the passage from my book

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:00.760
that I'm about to read, which
explains a bit about Nike's

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:01.960
reputation at that time.

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:10.690
"The shoes that Nguyen
Thi Thu Phuong died making

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:12.190
were designed at
Nike's headquarters

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.170
in Beaverton, Oregon.

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:16.510
The plans for the shoes were
then relayed by satellite

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:19.540
to a computer-aided
manufacturing desk in Taiwan,

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:22.700
where prototypes were
developed and tested.

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.710
Once the shoe's
blueprints were approved,

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:26.360
they were sent by
fax to the factory

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.430
where Phuong
worked, in Bien Hoa,

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.070
northeast of Ho Chi Minh City.

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:32.720
There the shoe's
three main parts--

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.850
the outsole, the
midsole, and the upper--

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:36.890
were produced individually,
then assembled

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:39.980
in a labor-intensive process
that was difficult to automate,

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:43.340
and therefore relied
on manual labor.

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:46.840
It was a summer day in 1997,
and Phuong was making midsoles,

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.390
carefully trimming away the
excess synthetic material

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:52.690
overflowing from molds that
had just come out of an oven.

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.700
Nearby, a co-worker's
sewing machine

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.710
suddenly broke down,
spraying metal parts

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.060
across the factory floor.

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.190
A piece of shrapnel
pierced Phuong's heart,

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:02.750
killing her instantly.

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:04.670
She was 23.

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:07.190
Nike's response to the young
woman's death was to boldly

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:10.580
claim, 'We don't make shoes.'

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.040
Knight and his team of
self-proclaimed shoe dogs,

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.380
whose origin story was tied to
making prototype soles in Bill

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:18.604
Bowerman's waffle
iron, now claimed

00:06:18.604 --> 00:06:20.270
they were little more
than the designers

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:24.040
and marketers of shoes
made by other companies.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.350
The backlash against
Nike amplified just

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:28.900
as the company was expanding
its retail operations

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:32.380
by opening its upscale
Niketown retail outlets

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:34.250
around the country.

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:36.740
Picketers and news cameras
showed up at store openings,

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:39.860
including one in San Francisco,
where NFL wide receiver Jerry

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.710
Rice was assailed with questions
about sweatshops and child

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:44.370
labor.

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:46.100
This was a major
problem for Knight,

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:49.940
who planned to open three
more Niketown shops in 1998.

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:52.310
They weren't just retail
outlets, but brand awareness

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:55.090
generators that helped
increase Nike's sales

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:58.140
at other retailers,
like Foot Locker.

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:00.750
And key Niketown locations,
like the one in London,

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:02.460
would help give the
company the foothold

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:04.170
it needed as it
sought to make inroads

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:05.640
into the European soccer market.

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:11.900
Michael Jordan faced his own
tough questions about Nike

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:14.330
sweatshops during
a press conference,

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:16.670
but even worse things
were in store for Knight,

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:19.310
who learned that documentary
filmmaker Michael Moore was set

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:22.190
to release a new film
'The Big One,' focused

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:25.820
on Nike's misadventures
in offshore manufacturing.

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:28.340
Wall Street took notice,
and throughout 1997 it

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:31.070
was not uncommon to find
stock analyst reports filled

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:33.140
with summaries of
the latest news

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:35.630
reports on the condition
of Nike's factories

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:37.910
throughout Asia, and
the extent to which

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:41.170
the company and its
shareholders were exposed.

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:42.910
For the first time
in years, analysts

00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:46.750
began downgrading Nike stock
and lowering its expectations

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:49.570
for the company's outlook.

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:52.370
When Knight at last looked
outside his company for help,

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:55.720
he turned to afford a firm
called GoodWorks International,

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:58.780
owned by Andrew Young, a former
mayor of Atlanta who had also

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:02.310
been the US ambassador
to the United Nations.

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:06.390
He hired GoodWorks to evaluate
Nike's operations in 1997,

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:07.980
and Young himself
went to Asia to meet

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:11.190
with some of Nike's suppliers
and contractors there.

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:14.075
When Young issued his report on
Nike's use of overseas labor,

00:08:14.075 --> 00:08:16.200
it was hard to imagine that
Dusty Kidd and the rest

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:19.140
of Nike's public relations
staff could have done more

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:22.080
to polish what was
clearly a rotten apple.

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:24.060
Knight was so pleased
with Young's conclusions

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:26.880
that he took out full-page
newspaper advertisements

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:28.260
highlighting them.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.990
'It is my sincere belief that
Nike is doing a good job,' one

00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:33.240
advertisement in 'The
New York Times' read.

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:36.700
'But Nike can and
should do better.'

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:38.590
Knight was also pleased
with another aspect

00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:40.210
of Young's evaluation.

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:43.090
While third-party monitoring
of Nike's overseas factories

00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:44.920
was a good idea,
it should be left

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:48.790
to a company like his own firm,
GoodWorks, Young felt, and not

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:51.940
to global labor and human
rights organizations.

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:53.586
The benefits of this
approach for Nike

00:08:53.586 --> 00:08:55.210
were evident from
the amount of control

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:57.850
the company was able to exert
over the Young report, which

00:08:57.850 --> 00:09:01.240
completely ignored the key
issues of wages for factory

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:03.040
workers.

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:06.130
Young had also relied
entirely on Nike interpreters

00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:08.200
during his 10 days of
interviews with the workers

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:12.160
making Nike shoes at
factories in Asia.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:14.110
The widely criticized
Andrew Young report

00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:16.570
was further undermined
in November 1997,

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:19.000
when a disgruntled
Nike employee leaked

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.670
some highlights from a
series of formal audits

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:24.940
Nike had commissioned
Ernst &amp; Young to prepare.

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:26.650
The accounting
firm had, in fact,

00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:31.216
been auditing Nike factories
in Indonesia since 1994,

00:09:31.216 --> 00:09:33.340
but Knight had managed to
keep these less forgiving

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:37.340
assessments quiet up until the
November 1997 leak of an Ernst

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:39.160
&amp; Young report
recommending improvements

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:43.390
to a factory just north of
Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam.

00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:46.930
The factory where Nguyen Thi Thu
Phuong died making Nike shoes,

00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:50.740
Ernst &amp; Young found, did
not have safety equipment

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:52.900
or training for its
workers, who were forced

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:54.820
to work more hours
than allowed by law,

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:56.980
making them more likely to
become injured or killed

00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:58.810
on the job.

00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:00.940
For months, Nike
had known exactly

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:03.310
which measures needed to
be taken to prevent others

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:04.750
from dying like Phuong had.

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:06.730
But instead of
focusing on solutions

00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:09.130
for the problems Ernst &amp; Young
had found at its factories

00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:12.580
in Asia, Nike instead promoted
the much rosier portrait

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:15.220
that Andrew Young had
painted in his report, which

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:18.790
was conducted the same
summer that Phuong died--

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:20.710
a picture of a
company doing its best

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:23.200
and coming up a little
short, as even the best

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:27.610
athletes sometimes do; a
story rather than a solution;

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:31.330
or, as Jordan might say,
a dream to be sold rather

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:34.550
than a problem to be fixed."

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:39.560
And from here I'm going to shift
into a passage that describes

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:44.090
this burgeoning campus protest
movement that was developing

00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:49.970
at the time, that was centered
around anti-sweatshop labor,

00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:52.130
the anti-sweatshop
labor movement.

00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:53.870
It's sort of hard
to imagine now.

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:57.470
I mean, we're seeing a
resurgence in campus protest

00:10:57.470 --> 00:11:04.970
movements now, I think,
centered on things like the NRA,

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:06.920
#MeToo, issues like this.

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:11.630
We're seeing a return
to campus protest.

00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:15.740
But for a long time,
basically since the wars

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:18.480
in Iraq and Afghanistan
started, campus protest

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:21.770
has been largely about anti-war,
because we've basically been

00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:23.600
at war ever since.

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:27.065
But prior to that, this
anti-sweatshop movement

00:11:27.065 --> 00:11:28.590
was a big deal.

00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:33.260
And it was, in fact, maybe the
most successful mass protest

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:37.430
movement in America since
the anti-apartheid movement.

00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:43.600
And here's what it looked like
at the University of Oregon.

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:45.670
"On the afternoon
of April 4, 2000,

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:47.140
six University of
Oregon students

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:48.640
locked arms and
blocked the entrance

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:51.730
to Johnson Hall, a stately
100-year-old building that

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:55.090
housed the offices of the
school's top administrators.

00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:56.890
A heaving mass of
protesters came

00:11:56.890 --> 00:11:59.320
with them, swarming the
six stone columns framing

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:01.150
the entrance to the
red brick facade, which

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:06.610
sits on 295 immaculately
kept acres of campus,

00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:09.400
bordered by the Willamette River
and stippled with some 3,000

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:10.880
trees.

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:13.370
From the window of his office,
Dave Frohnmayer could see

00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:15.620
the messages students
had written to him,

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:19.190
spelled out on the sidewalk
in bright pink chalk,

00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:22.610
'Take a hike, Nike,' with the
company's signature swoosh logo

00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:25.310
standing in for its name.

00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:27.770
It was the University of
Oregon's first major student

00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:29.920
sit-in since the anti-war
demonstrations that

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:33.020
began in 1969 and carried on
into the following year, when

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:35.120
four members of a
self-described student women's

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:38.690
militia hurled buckets of fresh
animal blood on army recruiters

00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:40.340
while chanting
slogans of protest

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:43.520
against the My Lai
Massacre in Vietnam.

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:45.770
Oregon's campus protests
against the war in Vietnam

00:12:45.770 --> 00:12:47.720
intensified just as
Frohnmayer arrived

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:49.220
at the University
as a law professor

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:52.790
and legal counsel to then
president Robert D. Clark.

00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:55.850
In many ways, Clark had
it easier than Frohnmayer.

00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:58.280
Had he sided with protesters
and kicked recruiters

00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:01.334
off his campus, he'd only
have angered the US Army.

00:13:01.334 --> 00:13:02.750
Frohnmayer, on the
other hand, had

00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:05.554
to worry about
angering Phil Knight.

00:13:05.554 --> 00:13:07.970
In the three decades since
Frohnmayer had moved to Eugene,

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:09.386
the college by the
river had grown

00:13:09.386 --> 00:13:11.150
to become Eugene's
largest employer,

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:13.520
with 10,000 Oregonians
depending on the school

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:15.034
for their livelihood.

00:13:15.034 --> 00:13:16.700
And in the handful
of years since Knight

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:19.332
had begun paying for
new buildings on campus,

00:13:19.332 --> 00:13:21.290
he'd become more than
just an important booster

00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:22.940
for Oregon athletics.

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:24.980
He was the school's most
important benefactor,

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:27.140
which made him, in
a sense, the town's

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:29.330
most important benefactor.

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:31.790
On campus, not everyone was
comfortable with the influence

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:34.190
Knight seemed to have, or
the school's renewed focus

00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:37.280
on athletics over academics.

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:39.170
These developments
coincided with a moment

00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:41.480
in which student activism
was regaining its voice,

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:44.480
particularly when it came to
labor and human rights issues.

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:46.790
And Nike, which was
facing intensifying calls

00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:50.240
for independent monitoring
at its overseas factories,

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:52.297
had a target on its back.

00:13:52.297 --> 00:13:54.380
It was a major problem for
Knight's company, which

00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:56.990
was losing ground to Adidas
and couldn't afford to give up

00:13:56.990 --> 00:13:59.240
its position as the shoe
and apparel supplier

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:01.970
to America's top universities.

00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:05.150
Nike's war to maintain its grip
on America's college campuses

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:07.427
began in earnest
in late 1997, when

00:14:07.427 --> 00:14:09.260
students at the University
of North Carolina

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.690
protested the
company's $7.2 million

00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:14.090
endorsement deal
with the school.

00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:16.880
In early 1998, the movement
gained a powerful voice

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:19.520
in Jim Keady, an
assistant soccer coach

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:21.350
at St. John's
University, who decided

00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:24.050
to publicly quit his job
rather than wear the Nike gear

00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:26.932
his school's contract demanded.

00:14:26.932 --> 00:14:29.390
'I don't want to be a billboard
for a company that would do

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:31.850
these things,' Keady said
of Nike's overseas labor

00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:33.650
practices.

00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:36.380
In 1999, the pressure
on Nike intensified

00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:37.790
after student
activists took over

00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:40.910
buildings at Duke, Georgetown,
the University of Michigan,

00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:43.700
and the University of
Wisconsin, and staged sit-ins

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:45.470
at many other schools.

00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:48.500
Just before Christmas in 2000,
student carolers strode through

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:50.870
the halls of Harvard
University's administrative

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:53.780
building singing
'Away in a Sweatshop.'

00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:56.690
It was becoming more than just
an image problem for Nike.

00:14:56.690 --> 00:14:59.630
When a factory worker was fired
by one of Nike's contractors

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:02.060
in Honduras, student
activists organized

00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:03.890
such effective protests
that the company

00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:06.500
was forced to rehire the woman.

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:08.960
Nike's university shoe
and apparel contracts

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:11.810
became the common battleground
shared by activists concerned

00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:14.600
over issues ranging from
sweatshop labor and China trade

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:17.720
policy to college athletics,
which increasingly took

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:21.400
precedence over
academic excellence

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:23.730
at schools around the country.

00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:26.210
And it wasn't just contracts
with athletics departments

00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:27.950
that were under fire.

00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:30.440
Nike was facing
significant backlash

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:33.050
over the branded apparel it
had so successfully marketed

00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:36.230
to ordinary university students
through its College Colors

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:37.520
program.

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:39.890
'It really is quite
sick,' said Tom Wheatley,

00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:42.920
a student and organizer at
the University of Wisconsin.

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:45.890
'14-year-old girls are working
100-hour weeks and earning

00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:49.220
poverty-level wages to
make my college T-shirts.

00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:51.300
That's unconscionable.'

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:53.870
At a growing number of
campuses around the country,

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:56.450
organizations like United
Students Against Sweatshops

00:15:56.450 --> 00:15:58.340
and the Movement for
Democracy and Education

00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:01.070
collaborated with the National
Labor Committee and the Worker

00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:03.140
Rights Consortium.

00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:05.900
The student-led WRC proved
to be especially effective

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:08.990
at recruiting universities to
the cause, first by protesting

00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:12.110
and then by lobbying students,
faculty, and university

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:14.780
presidents to sign
its pledge censoring

00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:17.720
corporations for using
sweatshop labor to produce

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:19.730
athletic apparel and shoes.

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:22.100
By April 2000, the
months-old organization

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:24.770
had already gained the backing
of 45 different universities

00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:27.410
around the country, which
frustrated and angered Knight,

00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:30.650
because joining the WRC meant
publicly criticizing Nike

00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:33.530
for failing to allow, among
other things, surprise

00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:35.390
inspections at its
overseas factories

00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:37.160
where its shoes were made.

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:40.040
Knight, meanwhile, was trying to
pressure Nike's partner schools

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:42.980
into ignoring the WRC, steering
them toward the relatively

00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:45.290
toothless Fair
Labor Association,

00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:47.180
which had executives
from various apparel

00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:49.670
companies sitting on its board.

00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:52.190
The campus wars came to
a head in April of 2000,

00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:54.440
when Knight abruptly
ended negotiations

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:56.240
to renew his company's
sports equipment

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:59.480
contract with the University
of Michigan, a deal that

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:02.390
would have been worth
as much as $26 million,

00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:05.869
making it the largest of its
kind up until that point.

00:17:05.869 --> 00:17:08.030
Michigan's administrators
and athletics departments

00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:11.089
stood firm, issuing an unusually
pointed statement aimed

00:17:11.089 --> 00:17:14.240
at Nike's retaliatory tactics.

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:16.790
'Nike has chosen to strike
out at universities committed

00:17:16.790 --> 00:17:20.119
to finding appropriate ways
to safeguard and respect human

00:17:20.119 --> 00:17:22.790
rights,' the school said."

00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:24.470
And I'll stop that
section there.

00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:30.276
This basically leads
up to the situation

00:17:30.276 --> 00:17:32.150
that I described at the
beginning of my talk,

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:36.470
which I think you can infer
from what I've said so far how

00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:41.690
that situation turns out, and
who comes out the victor when

00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:44.600
students or faculty, or
even administrators, go up

00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:49.520
against a big time corporate
benefactor like Phil Knight.

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:53.120
But I want to talk briefly,
before opening it up

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:56.720
to questions from you guys,
about how the book came

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:59.540
to be in the first place,
and sort of the ground

00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:06.860
that it covers, because it
didn't start out as a book.

00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:10.820
It actually began in
the spring of 2014

00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:14.480
as just a couple of
newspaper articles

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:17.160
for "The New York Times."

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:19.250
The sports editor for
"The New York Times,"

00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:22.100
a guy named Jason
Stallman, sent me to Eugene

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:26.480
to cover this scandal
that was unfolding there

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:29.450
at the University of
Oregon, where a freshman

00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:33.860
had reported that she had been
raped by three of the school's

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:35.930
basketball players.

00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:41.300
And it was unusual and worth the
coverage, I thought, because--

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:46.460
the reason I heard about
it in the first place

00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:48.380
was because of a
police report that

00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:50.120
had been leaked to the press.

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:52.220
And the police report
was two months old,

00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:56.860
and I thought, why is this--

00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:59.740
why are these guys still playing
basketball, first of all?

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:03.274
I mean, why haven't we heard
anything about this yet?

00:19:03.274 --> 00:19:04.690
And the reason,
it turned out, was

00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:09.130
because the school had chosen
to treat this girl's report

00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:12.272
of being sexually assaulted--

00:19:12.272 --> 00:19:13.480
rather brutally, I might add.

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:17.650
It was a very graphic
police report.

00:19:17.650 --> 00:19:20.290
They decided to treat this
like a public relations

00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:25.330
issue rather than a serious
legal and ethical and moral

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:26.540
issue.

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:32.740
And so I was left with a
lot of questions by the way

00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:35.420
the school handled this case.

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:42.830
In the end, they
suspended the players.

00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:45.700
The players all went off
to other universities,

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:49.630
and the university
president resigned in shame,

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:54.290
took with him nearly a million
dollars in severance pay.

00:19:54.290 --> 00:19:58.270
And meanwhile the student, as
I followed the case for years--

00:19:58.270 --> 00:20:02.620
I ended up going off to
Columbia journalism school

00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:07.210
later that year, where I
was a fellow at the Stabile

00:20:07.210 --> 00:20:08.860
Center for Investigative
Journalism,

00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:13.840
and I chose to follow this
as my master's project there.

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:16.480
And as I followed along
with what happened,

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:19.720
things just got worse and worse
for the victim in this case,

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:22.760
for the woman who
filed this report.

00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:26.970
I mean, the school really
treated this girl very badly.

00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:32.520
One administrator encouraged
her to seek counseling.

00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:35.050
They gave all these
interviews in the press

00:20:35.050 --> 00:20:37.180
after the story
broke about how they

00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:40.540
have all these resources
for students and counseling

00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:41.080
available.

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:44.920
So then this girl who filed
this report, and who had it

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:47.830
ignored while the school
allowed these guys

00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:53.000
to keep playing basketball
through the NCAA tournament--

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.280
and after she went
to counseling,

00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:59.660
the person in charge of the
student counseling center,

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:03.440
who herself was a
licensed psychologist,

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:06.830
instructed her subordinates
to steal the notes

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:09.290
from her sessions, from
her therapy sessions,

00:21:09.290 --> 00:21:11.180
so that they could
use them against her

00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:13.220
in the event of a lawsuit.

00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:17.930
And eventually they ended up
settling the whole thing out

00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:19.460
of court.

00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:23.330
But I learned that
stuff like this goes on,

00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:27.420
and it's not rare.

00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:28.660
It happens everywhere.

00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:30.810
And, as I argue in
the book it's really

00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:33.930
compounded when universities
have corporate partners

00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:36.630
like Nike and they
become more concerned

00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:38.400
with protecting
their brand than they

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:40.230
do with following the rules.

00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:44.490
I mean, in this case alone,
state public records laws

00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:46.620
were broken.

00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:49.920
I think some federal
laws regarding Title IX

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:55.260
and regarding the Clery Act
were also violated, I argue.

00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:59.460
So that's sort of how I
came to work on this book.

00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:03.330
And what I learned
as I looked back

00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:06.330
is that the story is
one that we should all

00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:08.790
be paying attention to no
matter what state we live in,

00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:10.560
because this--

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:12.600
I thought I was writing--

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:15.240
I told a guy at "The New
York Times" in an interview,

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:18.060
I thought I was writing a book
about something that happened

00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:20.617
at the University of Oregon,
and instead, what it turned out

00:22:20.617 --> 00:22:22.575
I was writing was a book
about something that's

00:22:22.575 --> 00:22:24.000
happening everywhere.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.930
Because this all began for
Oregonians back in 1990,

00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:30.630
when they passed this
piece of legislation that

00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:37.460
defunded public higher education
and sent university presidents

00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:40.910
and administrators scrambling,
looking for outside money.

00:22:40.910 --> 00:22:42.820
But it didn't stop with Oregon.

00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:44.360
Oregon was just
ahead of the curve.

00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:47.300
And so Oregon started
doing that in 1990,

00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:50.750
and a few years later, states
are doing it everywhere.

00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:54.980
And so now everyone is.

00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:58.280
Believe it or not, as
horrible as this all sounds,

00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:01.340
this seems attractive to a lot
of university administrators,

00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:05.210
because university
presidents tend

00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:07.620
to be very short-term
in their thinking.

00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:10.890
They're around usually
for four or five years.

00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:15.140
And the blueprint for them
is to sort of come in, build

00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:16.580
something and put
their name on it

00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:18.296
or have their name
associated with it,

00:23:18.296 --> 00:23:20.420
and then move on to another
university and a bigger

00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:20.919
paycheck.

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:26.640
So for them, I
described in the book,

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:28.530
for example, the
University of Maryland,

00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:33.650
where Kevin Plank, the founder
of Under Armour, is an alum.

00:23:33.650 --> 00:23:37.190
I mean, they basically look
at this as a blueprint,

00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:38.070
as a road to follow.

00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:40.700
Yeah, this is great,
because it will

00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:44.450
allow us to build some fancy
new buildings on campus.

00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:48.620
And meanwhile,
student tuition still

00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:52.850
goes up, because when you have
a big time corporate donor

00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:55.250
like Phil Knight at
your school, it's

00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:58.310
really the equivalent of having
a credit card with a limit

00:23:58.310 --> 00:24:00.725
that you just shouldn't have.

00:24:00.725 --> 00:24:04.550
It allows universities to
spend well beyond their means,

00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:07.130
and they spend on the things
that those donors want,

00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:09.910
like a big stadium
or what have you.

00:24:09.910 --> 00:24:14.750
And what those donors tend not
to care about is academics,

00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:16.100
is--

00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:18.830
well, one of the
things that makes

00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:23.360
the American public
universities such a great idea

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:25.550
and so good for society
is that it's always

00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:29.330
been a path for lower
and middle class people

00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:31.560
to work their way up.

00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:33.827
I mean, my mother
worked in a cannery

00:24:33.827 --> 00:24:35.660
and my father was a
fisherman, and I grew up

00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:37.280
in a tiny town in Alaska.

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:43.660
And it's because of a
public state university,

00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:47.090
it's because of that access
to an affordable degree

00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:51.445
that I was able to
work my way up and get

00:24:51.445 --> 00:24:52.320
where I wanted to go.

00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:55.970
So this is not just--

00:24:55.970 --> 00:24:57.560
this is not some
small thing that's

00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:04.452
imperiled when we abandon a
public institution like this

00:25:04.452 --> 00:25:08.510
to corporate interests and
allow them to call the shots,

00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:10.640
because what we're
abandoning is not

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:14.180
just an important public
institution, but an institution

00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:19.100
that really provides in a
way that nothing else can,

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:23.600
I would argue, a path to
upward social mobility.

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:27.440
And so, again, as
I told this guy

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:30.650
at "The New York Times" who
interviewed me, why should

00:25:30.650 --> 00:25:32.360
people read this book.

00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:35.990
I told him, well, I think now is
the perfect time for Americans

00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:40.130
to understand, to
fully understand

00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:44.900
the consequences of abandoning
our public institutions

00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:48.230
in order to save a few
dollars on our taxes,

00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:51.770
and leaving them up
to private interests

00:25:51.770 --> 00:25:53.930
to come in and save
them, because that's

00:25:53.930 --> 00:25:54.870
what will happen.

00:25:54.870 --> 00:26:01.580
I mean, these institutions
aren't just going to fade away.

00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:03.920
If we as citizens
aren't interested,

00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:07.370
other interests will come
in and will take over,

00:26:07.370 --> 00:26:09.080
and will steer the ship.

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:11.350
And we're seeing
in our government

00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:14.270
what that's like right now.

00:26:14.270 --> 00:26:17.330
But this is a very
in-depth case study

00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:19.850
of what that looks
like over time,

00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:23.330
and of how that really
infects every aspect

00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:26.040
of the institution.

00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:31.380
And I guess now I will
start taking some questions,

00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:33.190
if you guys have any.

00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:41.860
So to repeat the question, how
can students who are protesting

00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:44.590
on their campuses
be more effective

00:26:44.590 --> 00:26:49.180
and have an impact
when universities

00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:55.360
and their benefactors are
trying to manage them, I guess.

00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:56.780
And it's interesting.

00:26:56.780 --> 00:26:57.880
One of the things--

00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:03.120
I mean, I think
one of the reasons

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:07.320
why I talk for a few
chapters about the importance

00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:10.770
of this anti-sweatshop
protest movement

00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:14.430
is because I think there's a
lot of really valuable lessons

00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:17.550
there and there's some
important history there, too.

00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:21.280
One of the valuable lessons is
that protesting really works.

00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:25.110
I mean, Nike's--

00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:27.000
I mean, I'm not going
to go out there and say

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.458
Nike is doing everything they
should be doing when it comes

00:27:29.458 --> 00:27:32.260
to overseas labor at this point,
but they're doing a lot better.

00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:34.200
And they didn't
just wake up one day

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:37.680
and say, oh, we have a moral
obligation to these people that

00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:40.590
are dying in Vietnam or
wherever making our shoes.

00:27:40.590 --> 00:27:44.960
They did it because the
protesters were just so--

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:49.470
were organizing so
effectively, and part

00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:51.007
of the reason they
were so effective

00:27:51.007 --> 00:27:52.840
is because there was a
lot of collaboration.

00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:55.790
So you had--

00:27:55.790 --> 00:27:58.290
I mean, there was
human rights groups,

00:27:58.290 --> 00:28:00.450
international human rights
groups collaborating

00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:03.750
with American labor
and union groups,

00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:06.210
collaborating with
church groups.

00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:08.610
I mean, there were some
cases back then where

00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:11.640
you had outright
communists organizing

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:16.470
with old church ladies, which
is fascinating to think about.

00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:18.150
I mean, you can really
accomplish things

00:28:18.150 --> 00:28:22.638
when you can bring together old
church ladies and communists.

00:28:22.638 --> 00:28:24.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:30.760
I mean, that's really
effective organization.

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:35.650
I argue also in the
book that they were so--

00:28:35.650 --> 00:28:38.630
the network they
built up was so strong

00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:40.760
that when the wind shifted
and suddenly everyone

00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:44.330
started protesting the wars
in Iraq and Afghanistan,

00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:46.430
part of the reason those
protests came together

00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:48.380
so quickly is because
there were already

00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:51.140
these sort of radical
left wing networks at all

00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:56.780
these campuses, people who were
on the same page politically.

00:28:56.780 --> 00:28:57.810
So even though the--

00:28:57.810 --> 00:28:59.810
I mean, you might say,
well, we're still at war,

00:28:59.810 --> 00:29:01.690
so what did those protests do?

00:29:01.690 --> 00:29:04.820
But they got attention,
and they were big,

00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:08.750
and people's voices were heard.

00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:12.800
Today, actually, some reviewers
who have read the book

00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:17.510
and who have interviewed me have
said, it's kind of a dark book.

00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:20.742
Do you think-- are you hopeful?

00:29:20.742 --> 00:29:22.700
You talk about all this
bad stuff that goes on.

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:24.500
Do you have any reason for hope?

00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:27.050
And I tell them one thing
that makes me hopeful

00:29:27.050 --> 00:29:31.790
is this resurgence in the campus
protest movement and the fact

00:29:31.790 --> 00:29:35.150
that there does seem to be
this spirit of collaboration

00:29:35.150 --> 00:29:41.540
out there where there's
people whose issue is gun

00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:47.750
control, collaborating with
people whose issue is raising

00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:50.450
the minimum wage or whatever,
or whether it's #MeToo,

00:29:50.450 --> 00:29:53.960
or whether it's sort of
just anti-Trump, generally.

00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:58.850
But there seems to be
a lot of collaboration.

00:29:58.850 --> 00:30:00.367
I think the protests
against the NRA

00:30:00.367 --> 00:30:02.450
are especially inspiring,
because that's something

00:30:02.450 --> 00:30:05.340
that for years, we've
heard people say,

00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:09.410
oh well, I mean, basically,
the left threw in the towel

00:30:09.410 --> 00:30:12.501
on that issue, saying it was
impossible, a non-starter.

00:30:12.501 --> 00:30:14.000
And all of a sudden
there's these 18

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.970
and 19-year-olds really
making the NRA sweat

00:30:16.970 --> 00:30:19.640
and really pushing people.

00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:21.890
I get emails all the time
from different chapters

00:30:21.890 --> 00:30:24.440
of the Democratic Socialists
of America saying,

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:27.290
oh, we'd love to have you
for an event or whatever.

00:30:27.290 --> 00:30:31.130
That tells me there's all these
young people out there who

00:30:31.130 --> 00:30:34.880
are deeply committed to change
and willing to fight for it,

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:37.394
and they don't have these
same lines in the sand

00:30:37.394 --> 00:30:38.810
that we used to,
where we thought,

00:30:38.810 --> 00:30:40.820
oh, well, that's
too much to ask for,

00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:43.280
so we just won't ask for it.

00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:46.400
I mean, they're asking for
socialism, for Christ sakes.

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:48.440
That's something
that no one would

00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:51.880
have thought to seriously
ask for a few years ago.

00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:52.940
Yep.

00:30:52.940 --> 00:30:57.860
So the question is are
there processes or systems

00:30:57.860 --> 00:31:01.730
that universities
can have to prevent

00:31:01.730 --> 00:31:05.660
against the kinds of abuses
that I describe in the book,

00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:08.240
some sort of systemic
ways of dealing

00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:11.630
with the problem of
overreach by corporate donors

00:31:11.630 --> 00:31:12.710
at universities.

00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:14.510
I think there's a few things.

00:31:14.510 --> 00:31:21.200
The sort of biggest picture
thing is more of a government

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:23.420
slash society thing,
not a university thing.

00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:28.670
And that is that, in addition
to we as citizens recognizing

00:31:28.670 --> 00:31:30.920
the value of our
public universities

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:35.000
and supporting them however
we can with our taxes

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.489
or what have you,
I think, also, we

00:31:37.489 --> 00:31:39.530
should make sure that our
corporations are paying

00:31:39.530 --> 00:31:41.000
their fair share of taxes.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:48.070
And so if a corporation does
need to support a university,

00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:50.360
it can do so with its
tax dollars in a way

00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:53.300
that's transparent
and that doesn't

00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:55.580
lead to these kind
of private fiefdoms

00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:58.730
that we see with Nike and
the University of Oregon,

00:31:58.730 --> 00:32:02.960
or Under Armor and University
of Maryland, or in Oklahoma

00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:06.590
with T. Boone Pickens,
the oil billionaire.

00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:09.950
The other thing
is a lot of what I

00:32:09.950 --> 00:32:14.030
describe in the book
are abuses of processes

00:32:14.030 --> 00:32:16.130
that already are in place.

00:32:16.130 --> 00:32:20.450
And so, for instance,
public records law in Oregon

00:32:20.450 --> 00:32:26.630
is pretty strong, and it
really demands that the public

00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:27.680
be able to scrutinize.

00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:30.560
I mean, any public
university, any university

00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:34.220
that gets federal funding,
the records are public.

00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:37.280
Basically, every record created
that university is public

00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:41.370
unless it infringes on a
student's privacy or someone's

00:32:41.370 --> 00:32:45.660
medical privacy or personal
privacy or something like this.

00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:54.540
So for instance, when a
student reports a rape,

00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:56.610
if university
administrators start

00:32:56.610 --> 00:32:59.670
talking about that on email,
or text messages on their work

00:32:59.670 --> 00:33:02.850
phones, with crisis
communicators and PR

00:33:02.850 --> 00:33:06.300
professionals and saying
how do we handle this,

00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:10.020
or the day that the police
report of a rape on campus

00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:13.500
leaks and they start passing
emails back and forth

00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:16.770
saying, oh, my god, what
are we going to do--

00:33:16.770 --> 00:33:17.850
those are public records.

00:33:17.850 --> 00:33:20.910
Those are records I tried
to get and that they really

00:33:20.910 --> 00:33:26.710
fought to hide, because those
records revealed that they were

00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:28.060
not thinking about the victim.

00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:29.976
They were not thinking
about the student body.

00:33:29.976 --> 00:33:32.860
They were thinking about
their image and their brand,

00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:35.090
and their paychecks, basically.

00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:39.190
And so one thing is
to make sure that we

00:33:39.190 --> 00:33:42.490
have strong enforcement for
things like open records laws

00:33:42.490 --> 00:33:46.450
and to really demand that
these people follow the rules

00:33:46.450 --> 00:33:48.570
and to demand that they--

00:33:48.570 --> 00:33:50.960
I mean, not just the
rules, but the law.

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:54.490
Respect the processes that are
in place, because transparency

00:33:54.490 --> 00:33:57.640
is the biggest thing
that we can have.

00:33:57.640 --> 00:34:00.910
Someone at a luncheon
recently said,

00:34:00.910 --> 00:34:04.460
you know, this is why integrity
and leadership matter so much.

00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:06.100
And I said, no, I disagree.

00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:09.370
Integrity is a gamble.

00:34:09.370 --> 00:34:17.050
It's a gamble to bet on
your CEO having integrity.

00:34:17.050 --> 00:34:21.100
And everyone's fallible also,
so even people of integrity

00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:22.690
can be compromised.

00:34:22.690 --> 00:34:26.500
What's important is
transparency and accountability.

00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:28.300
Follow-up question.

00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:32.590
Big philanthropy, should
there be more oversight.

00:34:32.590 --> 00:34:34.798
Yes.

00:34:34.798 --> 00:34:36.355
It's tricky, though because--

00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:41.730
I think if there
were more oversight--

00:34:41.730 --> 00:34:43.960
I mean, I think, yes, there
should be more oversight.

00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:47.020
There should be
more accountability.

00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:49.770
But I also, I
think we'll see how

00:34:49.770 --> 00:34:54.239
generous people really are when
there's actual accountability

00:34:54.239 --> 00:34:57.519
and when this stuff is all
out in the open because--

00:34:57.519 --> 00:34:59.310
and, again, it goes
back to that tax issue.

00:34:59.310 --> 00:35:01.230
Just make corporations
pay their taxes,

00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:08.040
because all this valorizing of
billionaires giving money away,

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:12.000
I mean, mostly it's a
tax write off for them.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.490
And mostly their money
comes with strings

00:35:14.490 --> 00:35:18.060
attached, as it certainly
does in the cases

00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:20.640
that I describe in my book.

00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:23.070
So it's a tricky question.

00:35:23.070 --> 00:35:24.030
It's a tricky question.

00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:26.910
Yes, we should, but
what will happen

00:35:26.910 --> 00:35:28.950
to the philanthropy industry?

00:35:28.950 --> 00:35:32.440
Because it is an industry
and it is kind of--

00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:36.940
I describe it in my book not
as gifts but as investments.

00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:39.280
I mean, I think
that's how people--

00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:41.410
I think that's how
philanthropy really works, is

00:35:41.410 --> 00:35:44.610
it's a kind of investment.

00:35:44.610 --> 00:35:47.570
The question is
regarding these students

00:35:47.570 --> 00:35:52.040
as employees movement,
this endless controversy

00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:58.340
about whether student athletes
ought to be paid or not paid.

00:35:58.340 --> 00:36:02.450
I describe in my
book, at some point

00:36:02.450 --> 00:36:11.280
I describe how that came to
pass, and basically let me--

00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:11.780
yeah.

00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:14.610
In fact, I'll just
read this brief passage

00:36:14.610 --> 00:36:21.585
about the first sort of rule
book for college football.

00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:26.630
And it was decided--

00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:34.911
these were decided
on in 1860, so--

00:36:34.911 --> 00:36:35.410
sorry.

00:36:35.410 --> 00:36:39.370
1869 was this
important game when

00:36:39.370 --> 00:36:41.320
Rutgers beat Princeton
that sort of led

00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:45.190
to the flowering of
college football.

00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:51.130
And then in 1898, "In
February, 1898 Brown University

00:36:51.130 --> 00:36:53.880
hosted a conference
focused on, quote,

00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:55.870
'the discussion of
questions arising out

00:36:55.870 --> 00:36:59.770
of intercollegiate contests
and the objectionable features

00:36:59.770 --> 00:37:02.320
connected with them,"
end quote, which

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:05.600
drew delegates from Columbia,
Cornell, Dartmouth, Harvard,

00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:08.440
Princeton, and the
University of Pennsylvania.

00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:11.500
These delegates argued on a
set of eligibility requirements

00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:13.480
known as the Providence
Rules, and they

00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:15.520
advanced an idea that
remains among the most

00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:18.790
enduring and controversial
aspects of college sports.

00:37:18.790 --> 00:37:20.890
'It is obvious,' they
wrote in their report,

00:37:20.890 --> 00:37:23.990
'that no student should be
paid for his athletics.'"

00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:24.490
OK.

00:37:24.490 --> 00:37:26.740
So let me just
read again the name

00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:29.890
of the colleges that
decided that it would

00:37:29.890 --> 00:37:35.770
be ungentlemanly to pay
student athletes for their work

00:37:35.770 --> 00:37:39.430
on behalf of the school,
Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth,

00:37:39.430 --> 00:37:43.060
Harvard, Princeton, and the
University of Pennsylvania.

00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:51.970
This is a turn of the
century Ivy League thing.

00:37:51.970 --> 00:37:56.850
They were very-- there was this
obsession with what they called

00:37:56.850 --> 00:37:58.680
the athletes code of honor.

00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:01.620
And the really
funny thing is it--

00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:03.360
well, I'll just read on.

00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:06.660
After the passage it is
obvious that no student should

00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:09.870
be paid for his
athletics, I say,

00:38:09.870 --> 00:38:11.640
"Market forces
prevailed, however,

00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:14.160
giving college football its
first cheating scandal, just

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:17.370
one year after the Brown
Conference gave it a rulebook.

00:38:17.370 --> 00:38:21.720
Desperate to beat rival
school Yale, unable to find

00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:26.850
11 men of weight and muscle
among his university's 2,100

00:38:26.850 --> 00:38:29.100
male students, Columbia's
head football coach,

00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:33.210
George Foster Sanford,
resorted to hiring ringers.

00:38:33.210 --> 00:38:35.490
The university tried to pin
the scandal on a departing

00:38:35.490 --> 00:38:37.500
assistant coach, but
years later Sanford

00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:42.120
would blame his unprecedented
$5,000 coaching salary.

00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:45.000
The lure of quick money, the
unexpected pressure that came

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.750
with it, and, quote, 'the
virus of the game,' he said,

00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:50.550
had nearly destroyed him."

00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:54.240
I mean, I think has
anything changed?

00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:57.360
I mean, that's sort
of what happens

00:38:57.360 --> 00:39:02.250
when you have something,
this institution where

00:39:02.250 --> 00:39:06.240
the stakes are so high and
there's so much money pouring

00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:09.932
into it, and everyone is
getting paid but the students,

00:39:09.932 --> 00:39:11.640
of course there's
going to be corruption.

00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:13.950
Of course there is
going to be scandal.

00:39:13.950 --> 00:39:19.450
I mean, this corruption,
it's laughable

00:39:19.450 --> 00:39:23.460
that the only thing these people
are getting convicted of now

00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:25.890
is paying athletes.

00:39:25.890 --> 00:39:28.830
I mean, that seems silly to me.

00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:35.675
In short, it seems to me that
this system doesn't work.

00:39:35.675 --> 00:39:38.420
It's, at best,
deeply hypocritical

00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:40.820
and highly unrealistic.

00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:43.340
It's going to be rife
with corruption and crime.

00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:45.957
If it goes on this way,
they should probably

00:39:45.957 --> 00:39:46.790
change the rulebook.

00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:49.010
And, by the way, it's not
like the NCAA has ever

00:39:49.010 --> 00:39:50.090
changed a rule before.

00:39:50.090 --> 00:39:53.480
One thing I discuss in the
book is the whole reason

00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:56.960
that Nike and Adidas and
these other shoe and apparel

00:39:56.960 --> 00:40:01.430
companies can make all-school
deals with universities

00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:05.360
is because Nike did an
end-run around the rules

00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:07.760
back in the day, back
in the late '70s.

00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:10.370
Up until 1986, there
was no such provision

00:40:10.370 --> 00:40:12.320
for having an all-school deal.

00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:15.020
So what they did
was Nike realized,

00:40:15.020 --> 00:40:16.910
oh, we just buy the coaches.

00:40:16.910 --> 00:40:19.190
So they would go
directly to the coach,

00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:23.000
pay the coach $5,000
or $10,000, and say,

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:24.080
we're going to pay you.

00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:28.490
We're going to give you, Mr.
Basketball Coach, a contract.

00:40:28.490 --> 00:40:30.240
We'll pay you $5,000
or $10,000 a year,

00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:33.030
and you're going to
exclusively wear Nike shoes.

00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:34.784
And, by the way,
we're also going

00:40:34.784 --> 00:40:36.950
to give you a free pair of
shoes for-- how many guys

00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:37.991
do you have on your team?

00:40:37.991 --> 00:40:38.930
OK, that many guys.

00:40:38.930 --> 00:40:41.320
And if you let us know
what sizes to get them in,

00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:44.270
we'll make sure they're the
right size for the guys.

00:40:44.270 --> 00:40:47.360
And if all goes well, we'll give
you the same amount of money

00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:50.780
next year, too, and the year
after that, in perpetuity.

00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:53.360
And it's like a quarter
of what the coaches--

00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:55.820
I mean, in the end, they were
getting more money from Nike

00:40:55.820 --> 00:40:58.153
or Adidas, whoever their part
shoe partner was than they

00:40:58.153 --> 00:41:01.300
were from their university.

00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:06.770
And so that's, by 1986--

00:41:06.770 --> 00:41:08.810
They couldn't legally
require the coach

00:41:08.810 --> 00:41:11.839
to make his players
wear the shoes,

00:41:11.839 --> 00:41:13.380
but if you know that
you're not going

00:41:13.380 --> 00:41:16.347
to get that $10,000 next
year unless Nike's happy,

00:41:16.347 --> 00:41:17.930
and you know what
will make Nike happy

00:41:17.930 --> 00:41:19.670
is to make your
players wear the shoes,

00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:21.870
they're going to wear
the shoes, and they did.

00:41:21.870 --> 00:41:25.550
And so that's why in 1986,
the NCAA said, screw it.

00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:29.340
Let's just commodify the
game and change the rules.

00:41:29.340 --> 00:41:31.760
And that's why we
have all-school deals.

00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:35.060
They could do something
similar to-- they

00:41:35.060 --> 00:41:38.690
could change the rules in
favor of paying players

00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:42.380
or something like this.

00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:45.600
They just don't have
any incentive to do it,

00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:48.270
or they think they don't
have an incentive to do it.

00:41:48.270 --> 00:41:55.470
So the question is,
is there a corporation

00:41:55.470 --> 00:41:57.630
that has a relationship
with the university

00:41:57.630 --> 00:42:01.110
that I think is ideal and
that is some kind of model?

00:42:01.110 --> 00:42:02.520
AUDIENCE: Besides Google's.

00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:05.070
JOSHUA HUNT: Besides--
besides Google's.

00:42:05.070 --> 00:42:09.180
I mean, my book largely focuses
on the relationships that

00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:12.330
haven't, that have
spectacularly not worked out.

00:42:12.330 --> 00:42:14.880
I mean, Berkeley
and Novartis comes

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:25.735
to mind, Berkeley and
BP Oil, and, of course,

00:42:25.735 --> 00:42:30.000
the big apparel and shoemakers.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:37.820
I think as a journalist,
it's not really

00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:42.250
my place to sort
of advise on policy

00:42:42.250 --> 00:42:47.800
or think too much about
how things ought to be.

00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:50.640
But I do think that--

00:42:53.250 --> 00:42:55.590
I do maintain that whatever--

00:42:55.590 --> 00:42:58.920
because, look, I
think basically,

00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:01.980
I don't subscribe to this myth
of good and bad corporations.

00:43:01.980 --> 00:43:02.760
I just don't.

00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:06.880
I really do think that's a myth.

00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:13.020
And I think that corporations
that act appropriately

00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:17.910
are corporations where power
is somewhat evenly distributed,

00:43:17.910 --> 00:43:20.840
where there's a good
corporate culture, where there

00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:23.310
is incentives to do the
right thing as opposed

00:43:23.310 --> 00:43:28.410
to doing the wrong thing,
where diversity and inclusion

00:43:28.410 --> 00:43:33.540
are important, and where
there's transparency.

00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:37.620
I mean, where there's
transparency and equally

00:43:37.620 --> 00:43:42.240
important, accountability--
where those things are

00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:46.170
paramount, I think you
just can't go wrong,

00:43:46.170 --> 00:43:48.600
because otherwise--

00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:51.270
The problem isn't just
what a corporation

00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:55.110
might make a university do,
might force a university do.

00:43:55.110 --> 00:43:57.480
In Nike's case,
everything from--

00:43:57.480 --> 00:43:59.820
I mean, Phil Knight has
had people hired and fired

00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:02.820
from the athletics department at
the University of Oregon, which

00:44:02.820 --> 00:44:04.830
is crazy.

00:44:04.830 --> 00:44:09.780
But it's also about
what universities

00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:12.390
might think their corporate
benefactor would want them

00:44:12.390 --> 00:44:18.675
to do and how they might
change their behavior

00:44:18.675 --> 00:44:20.269
without any direct
cues from someone

00:44:20.269 --> 00:44:21.310
that's giving them money.

00:44:21.310 --> 00:44:23.040
They might just
say, oh, well, we

00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:25.650
don't want this headache
so we'll act this way

00:44:25.650 --> 00:44:27.240
or act that way.

00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:31.200
That can be really harmful, too.

00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:36.270
Say the corporation is doing
their best to do things really

00:44:36.270 --> 00:44:40.320
ethically, and, in the
case of this partnership,

00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:43.740
things can still go bad if
the university sort of thinks

00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:46.446
they need to cover up this
or hide that or make things,

00:44:46.446 --> 00:44:47.820
if they're worried
about spooking

00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:48.778
the corporate sponsors.

00:44:48.778 --> 00:44:50.700
So transparency is key.

00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:53.100
And that's tricky with--

00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:56.670
so one thing I talk about near
the end of the book is this

00:44:56.670 --> 00:45:00.420
thing called the Knight Campus
for Advancing Scientific

00:45:00.420 --> 00:45:03.990
Impact, which is, to me, a very
Silicon Valley-sounding sort

00:45:03.990 --> 00:45:04.890
of--

00:45:04.890 --> 00:45:08.850
it sounds like an incubator or
something-- at the University

00:45:08.850 --> 00:45:11.440
of Oregon that's being funded.

00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:12.900
It's a billion
dollar campus being

00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:17.040
funded with a $500 million
gift from Phil Knight, which

00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:20.310
is another thing about
big time philanthropy.

00:45:20.310 --> 00:45:22.650
When someone hands
you $500 million

00:45:22.650 --> 00:45:24.242
for a billion dollar
project, they're

00:45:24.242 --> 00:45:25.950
also handing you a
bill for $500 million,

00:45:25.950 --> 00:45:29.290
and it's tough to
raise that money.

00:45:29.290 --> 00:45:31.050
And so now the
University of Oregon

00:45:31.050 --> 00:45:33.570
is looking into
state bonds and stuff

00:45:33.570 --> 00:45:35.220
like that to finish the project.

00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:37.920
And a big concern for
me is if they get down

00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:42.810
to that last $100 million
that they need, what are you

00:45:42.810 --> 00:45:45.520
going to be willing to do if
you're a university president

00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:50.460
and you can go out with
a big win or a big loss,

00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:53.047
depending on whether you
get this campus completed?

00:45:53.047 --> 00:45:54.630
What are you going
to be willing to do

00:45:54.630 --> 00:45:58.681
for the person that's going to
put up that last $100 million?

00:45:58.681 --> 00:46:01.320
Probably a lot.

00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:04.620
And when it comes to--

00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:06.900
these issues just
get more complex

00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:10.980
because there's not been
any transparency about what

00:46:10.980 --> 00:46:14.820
kind of corporate partners are
going to be involved in doing

00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:16.800
research at the Knight campus.

00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:19.034
But a lot of people
think it's probably going

00:46:19.034 --> 00:46:21.810
to be pharmaceutical companies.

00:46:21.810 --> 00:46:26.850
I mean, it could be Google
or someone doing AI research.

00:46:26.850 --> 00:46:29.250
Whatever the case
may be, there are

00:46:29.250 --> 00:46:32.370
loopholes in Oregon's
public records law

00:46:32.370 --> 00:46:35.220
which allow people to keep
secret communications that

00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:38.460
might infringe on some
kind of trade secret.

00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:40.500
That's a big problem
because how do you

00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:43.920
protect, how does a
corporation legitimately

00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:47.239
protect their trade secrets
without that being abused?

00:46:47.239 --> 00:46:48.780
I mean, before long
you've got people

00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:51.900
maybe talking about
illegal activities

00:46:51.900 --> 00:46:56.100
between some researcher and some
pharmaceutical company head.

00:46:56.100 --> 00:46:58.830
Maybe they're trying to
cover up some ill effect that

00:46:58.830 --> 00:47:01.830
was discovered through
some study or something.

00:47:01.830 --> 00:47:04.300
And they can do it by exploiting
this loophole, by saying,

00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:06.720
oh, well, these emails we
won't give to journalists

00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:08.670
or to the public
because they might

00:47:08.670 --> 00:47:11.040
infringe on trade secrets.

00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:11.850
That's concerning.

00:47:11.850 --> 00:47:15.606
So, again, transparency
is the thing.

00:47:15.606 --> 00:47:16.980
So the question
is, where would I

00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:21.780
rank Phil Knight among
all the awful CEOs?

00:47:21.780 --> 00:47:25.350
Again, my answer is maybe
a little bit unsexy,

00:47:25.350 --> 00:47:30.810
but I don't--

00:47:30.810 --> 00:47:32.970
for me, it's not a
matter of corporations

00:47:32.970 --> 00:47:34.710
being evil or good.

00:47:34.710 --> 00:47:39.720
It's about them being
totally amoral, 100% amoral,

00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:44.640
guided by nothing more
than, I mean, maybe loosely,

00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:48.580
some founding
principle or some--

00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:53.760
I mean, if it's a corporation
that's founded by engineers,

00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:59.370
then they're more likely to
have maybe some drive that's--

00:47:59.370 --> 00:48:01.230
whether they're obsessed
with AI or whatever

00:48:01.230 --> 00:48:05.880
it is, but more or less they're
driven by achieving their goal

00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:09.030
and making a lot of money
for their shareholders

00:48:09.030 --> 00:48:09.690
while doing it.

00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:16.050
Or just making enough money
to keep the boat going.

00:48:16.050 --> 00:48:18.840
I mean, look at
Theranos, you know.

00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:25.410
So for me it's not really about
like, oh, CEOs are so evil

00:48:25.410 --> 00:48:27.560
and corporations are so bad.

00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:32.580
It's just that, to my mind,
they will all more or less

00:48:32.580 --> 00:48:35.980
do what they can get away with.

00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:39.210
And when I say what
they can get away with,

00:48:39.210 --> 00:48:45.060
I mean within their
corporate structure,

00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:47.310
within their society, within--

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.440
I'm really-- my
next book is going

00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:54.990
to be about global
counterfeiting

00:48:54.990 --> 00:48:57.180
and international
crime, and that's

00:48:57.180 --> 00:48:59.670
really connected to the
offshore manufacturing

00:48:59.670 --> 00:49:02.410
boom of the 1980s.

00:49:02.410 --> 00:49:05.900
And so I'm really obsessed
with that right now,

00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:10.180
and I think one of the things
that's interesting about it

00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:14.140
to me is these companies, these
multinational corporations that

00:49:14.140 --> 00:49:17.830
are all victims of
counterfeiters now.

00:49:17.830 --> 00:49:20.710
They've created this
problem for themselves,

00:49:20.710 --> 00:49:25.060
because they set up their
manufacturing explicitly

00:49:25.060 --> 00:49:27.160
in countries not only
where labor was cheap,

00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:30.370
but where there were really
weak protections for workers

00:49:30.370 --> 00:49:34.850
so they could just exploit
people to the maximum.

00:49:34.850 --> 00:49:36.819
And places where the
rule of law is weak

00:49:36.819 --> 00:49:38.860
and they could sort of
push around the government

00:49:38.860 --> 00:49:39.755
a little bit.

00:49:39.755 --> 00:49:40.820
And, hey, guess what?

00:49:40.820 --> 00:49:42.910
You can't push around
China so easily now

00:49:42.910 --> 00:49:44.860
as you could maybe
back in the 1980s,

00:49:44.860 --> 00:49:47.050
if you're some
American corporation.

00:49:50.350 --> 00:49:55.000
So I hesitate to
rank Phil Knight

00:49:55.000 --> 00:50:01.780
among all the other
bad guy CEOs out there.

00:50:01.780 --> 00:50:05.170
I will say one reason I thought
this book was especially

00:50:05.170 --> 00:50:07.000
important to write
now is because there's

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:12.520
this whole generation, I
think, who are growing up

00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:18.040
afraid of Facebook
or afraid of--

00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:20.120
or they hate Elon Musk.

00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:23.420
This sort of anti-corporate
type of person

00:50:23.420 --> 00:50:25.940
these days is pretty
focused on tech companies.

00:50:25.940 --> 00:50:28.625
The exposes and all that are
mostly about tech companies,

00:50:28.625 --> 00:50:30.920
and I think it's
important to remind people

00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:36.270
that capitalism is basically
always been this way.

00:50:36.270 --> 00:50:40.100
And the way of
protecting civil society

00:50:40.100 --> 00:50:46.740
from unchecked capitalism is the
same ways as it's always been.

00:50:46.740 --> 00:50:47.650
Yep.

00:50:47.650 --> 00:50:49.274
AUDIENCE: Why do you
think universities

00:50:49.274 --> 00:50:52.084
take this kind of
poisoned money that

00:50:52.084 --> 00:50:54.500
has-- because a lot of times
they get these donations that

00:50:54.500 --> 00:50:56.635
say if you match half
a billion dollars,

00:50:56.635 --> 00:50:58.235
we'll pay the other half.

00:50:58.235 --> 00:51:01.015
If they don't have
the money, why do they

00:51:01.015 --> 00:51:02.500
take it in the first place?

00:51:02.500 --> 00:51:04.195
JOSHUA HUNT: I mean,
the same reason

00:51:04.195 --> 00:51:07.450
a company would take some
venture capital if they're

00:51:07.450 --> 00:51:08.680
not all the way there, right?

00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:10.111
They want to keep going.

00:51:10.111 --> 00:51:11.110
They want to keep going.

00:51:11.110 --> 00:51:12.484
They don't want
the party to end.

00:51:12.484 --> 00:51:16.310
I mean, maybe they really
believe in their idea,

00:51:16.310 --> 00:51:20.830
or maybe they really
believe they can get there.

00:51:20.830 --> 00:51:21.580
Maybe they don't.

00:51:21.580 --> 00:51:26.410
Either way, now always seems
like a bad time to stop,

00:51:26.410 --> 00:51:28.390
I think, to people,
whether you're in tech

00:51:28.390 --> 00:51:31.930
or whether you're in
the university world.

00:51:31.930 --> 00:51:34.837
In the case of
university administrators

00:51:34.837 --> 00:51:37.420
and in the University of Oregon,
in the case of the University

00:51:37.420 --> 00:51:39.010
of Oregon, in
particular, they've

00:51:39.010 --> 00:51:41.770
been bailed out so
many times by taxpayers

00:51:41.770 --> 00:51:43.780
that I think they're
just used to, oh, we'll

00:51:43.780 --> 00:51:48.760
get the money from the
taxpayers if we need to.

00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:54.340
Basically, whatever Phil
Knight doesn't pay for

00:51:54.340 --> 00:51:56.830
and whatever they can't get
other donors to shore up

00:51:56.830 --> 00:52:00.400
the money for-- which is hard,
by the way, because if you've

00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:03.250
got to raise $500 million for
something called the Knight

00:52:03.250 --> 00:52:06.640
Campus, I mean, no one else is
getting their name on there.

00:52:09.290 --> 00:52:11.330
There's less of an
incentive for people

00:52:11.330 --> 00:52:14.990
to give big money, big dollar
gifts to a project like that

00:52:14.990 --> 00:52:19.020
unless they have a specific
research interest or something.

00:52:19.020 --> 00:52:21.369
And so what they do is the
president of the University

00:52:21.369 --> 00:52:22.910
of Oregon, Michael
Schill, is already

00:52:22.910 --> 00:52:24.470
begging the
legislature in Oregon

00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:27.380
to issue these state bonds,
which come with hefty interest

00:52:27.380 --> 00:52:28.580
payments.

00:52:28.580 --> 00:52:31.220
And that's basically
their answer is,

00:52:31.220 --> 00:52:34.490
oh, give us $100 million
more in state bonds, please.

00:52:34.490 --> 00:52:36.737
And the legislature has so
far been fairly skeptical.

00:52:36.737 --> 00:52:39.320
I mean, they've given them some
of the money they've asked for

00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:40.740
but not all of it.

00:52:40.740 --> 00:52:43.689
So, again, the
question for me becomes

00:52:43.689 --> 00:52:45.230
when it comes down
to the point where

00:52:45.230 --> 00:52:48.710
they need to raise that last
$200 million, $100 million,

00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:50.996
what are they going
to be willing to do?

00:52:50.996 --> 00:52:54.080
I fear to find out
what the answer is.

00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:57.170
Or, at the very least, I hope
we find out what the answer is,

00:52:57.170 --> 00:53:00.597
fearful as it may be.

00:53:00.597 --> 00:53:02.180
AUDIENCE: Let's thank
Josh for coming.

00:53:02.180 --> 00:53:05.230
