00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:04.000
&gt;&gt; So, how will this course help you become a design-minded developer?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.380
&gt;&gt; Well, we're going to go through four lessons.

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.760
The first lesson is what is UX? We're going to

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.080
learn about the difference between UI and UX,

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.300
because there's a lot of misinformation out there. The

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.500
second lesson is about how to create applications

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.810
for specific users. And we're going to use tools called

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.350
personas and use cases. The third lesson is

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.510
about mobile design constraints. Because after all, this course

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.150
is for mobile developers. And in lesson

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:29.880
four, you're going to learn how to leverage

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.950
the power of the Android platform to

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.890
make applications that Android users really love.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.580
&gt;&gt; Yeah, in each lesson your going to be introduced

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.760
to new concepts and ideas. That you will have

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.010
an opportunity to put into practice at the end

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.780
of every lesson, in the form of an assignment.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.500
&gt;&gt; And the assignments are going to be

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.730
led by a Udacity course designer named Andy.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:48.380
&gt;&gt; Hello, Andy.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.880
&gt;&gt; Hey, Andy. So Nelsman,

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.330
let's briefly talk about a few things

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.560
that we're not going to cover in this course.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.210
&gt;&gt; So we're not going to teach you how to

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.850
code. You're developers after all. In fact, we have an

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.100
Android class made by Udacity. The link is in

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.840
the notes below, if you want to take that class.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:06.980
&gt;&gt; And we're also not going to cover

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.890
any Android specific UI elements. So now, let's dive

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.485
into what you're going to learn in lesson

00:01:12.485 --> 00:01:16.559
lesson. First, we're going to define, what is user experience?

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.270
Then, we're going to talk about the difference

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.290
between UI and UX. Then we're going to give

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.820
you two concrete examples of how you can improve your apps today. But before we

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.960
get to all this, let's leave the world of software design. And I want to show

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.550
you, a really awesome personal example of

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.120
something that captures really amazing user experience design.
