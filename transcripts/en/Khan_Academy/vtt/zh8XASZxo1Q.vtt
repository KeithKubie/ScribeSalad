00:00:00.779 --> 00:00:02.286
Narrator: In the last
video we took a look at

00:00:02.286 --> 00:00:05.336
what is probably the
simplest possible economy

00:00:05.336 --> 00:00:07.739
and it's not even clear
that this economy is

00:00:07.739 --> 00:00:10.342
even possible; this one person economy.

00:00:10.342 --> 00:00:13.778
To make it more analogous
to the real world

00:00:13.778 --> 00:00:16.137
where we have household and we have firms.

00:00:16.137 --> 00:00:19.499
In this one island this guy set up a firm

00:00:19.499 --> 00:00:21.924
and he essentially leashed
out all of the factors

00:00:21.924 --> 00:00:25.057
of production to that firm,
including his own labor.

00:00:25.057 --> 00:00:27.528
He leased it out, the rent on his labor

00:00:27.528 --> 00:00:29.925
is essentially his
wages and then he bought

00:00:29.925 --> 00:00:31.924
all of the goods and services he needed

00:00:31.924 --> 00:00:33.994
from that same firm.

00:00:33.994 --> 00:00:37.527
So, his expenditures would be the revenue

00:00:37.527 --> 00:00:40.195
of that firm and then
the revenue of that firm

00:00:40.195 --> 00:00:42.866
would be turned into the expenses

00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:45.209
and the profit of the
firm, so whatever the

00:00:45.209 --> 00:00:47.198
revenue wasn't used in expenses ended up

00:00:47.198 --> 00:00:48.001
being profit.

00:00:48.001 --> 00:00:50.119
Then all of that went back to that one

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:52.119
household as income.

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:54.280
When we talked about how we would measure

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.389
the economic activity in this island

00:00:57.389 --> 00:00:58.879
right over here, how would we measure its

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:00.164
gross domestic product, we said,

00:01:00.164 --> 00:01:02.193
well look we could measure it in multiple

00:01:02.193 --> 00:01:03.133
different ways.

00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:05.629
As it's leaving his
hands, the dollars that is

00:01:05.629 --> 00:01:07.653
going to the firm, you
could view it as the

00:01:07.653 --> 00:01:09.796
total expenditures, or as it's approaching

00:01:09.796 --> 00:01:11.723
the firm that's the
same thing as the total

00:01:11.723 --> 00:01:15.468
revenue for this firm,
total revenue for this

00:01:15.468 --> 00:01:18.795
simplified, one firm economy.

00:01:18.795 --> 00:01:21.136
That total revenue is
the same thing as the

00:01:21.136 --> 00:01:24.991
total expenses plus the
profit for that firm.

00:01:24.991 --> 00:01:27.050
That's the same thing as this one

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:28.320
households income.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.657
So, let me write this down.

00:01:29.657 --> 00:01:30.985
The way we looked at it in the last video,

00:01:30.985 --> 00:01:34.654
in the very simple
example, GDP was equal to

00:01:34.654 --> 00:01:39.098
household, household
expenditures which was equal

00:01:39.098 --> 00:01:46.110
to firm, firm revenues
which was equal to firm

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.201
expenses, expenses plus profit,

00:01:51.201 --> 00:01:54.664
which is equal to household income.

00:01:54.664 --> 00:01:57.518
(writing) household income, household ..

00:01:57.518 --> 00:02:00.813
I'll just write inc for
income, household income.

00:02:00.813 --> 00:02:02.654
and of course household income is then,

00:02:02.654 --> 00:02:04.229
at least in this case right over here,

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.530
it ended up being equal
to household expenses.

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.315
What I want to do in this video now is

00:02:10.315 --> 00:02:11.922
think about it in more general terms.

00:02:11.922 --> 00:02:13.779
Let's extend it to a more complex economy,

00:02:13.779 --> 00:02:16.562
to the world we live in and
with that I want to look

00:02:16.562 --> 00:02:19.677
at the more formal definition for GDP.

00:02:19.677 --> 00:02:23.097
This is the more formal definition of GDP,

00:02:23.097 --> 00:02:25.785
or I guess you could say
the definition of GDP

00:02:25.785 --> 00:02:29.718
and it's the market
value of all final goods

00:02:29.718 --> 00:02:31.527
and services, and we're
going to talk about what

00:02:31.527 --> 00:02:34.257
each of these things
mean ... of all, of all

00:02:34.257 --> 00:02:36.196
final goods and services.

00:02:36.196 --> 00:02:40.988
I'll underline all
separately, all final goods

00:02:40.988 --> 00:02:42.385
and services.

00:02:42.385 --> 00:02:44.318
Let me do that in a different color.

00:02:44.318 --> 00:02:48.311
... all final goods and
services produced within

00:02:48.311 --> 00:02:51.116
a country, produced within a country

00:02:51.116 --> 00:02:52.941
in a given period.

00:02:52.941 --> 00:02:54.914
You can have a GDP for a month,

00:02:54.914 --> 00:02:57.648
you could have a GDP
for a quarter of a year

00:02:57.648 --> 00:02:59.455
which would be three
months or you could have

00:02:59.455 --> 00:03:01.385
the GDP in a given year.

00:03:01.385 --> 00:03:02.660
I guess you could even have GDP over a

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.366
10 year period, but it tends to be

00:03:04.366 --> 00:03:06.320
we always think of GDP
in terms of annual GDP

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.517
or quarterly GDP or sometimes even ...

00:03:08.517 --> 00:03:10.448
so there are some estimates
of even monthly GDP

00:03:10.448 --> 00:03:13.657
but it tends to be annually or quarterly.

00:03:13.657 --> 00:03:15.390
Let's parse a little
bit more because these

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:16.928
little terms can be interesting.

00:03:16.928 --> 00:03:19.280
The first one I'd like
to parse is the idea of

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.655
market value.

00:03:20.655 --> 00:03:22.943
(writing) Market value.

00:03:22.943 --> 00:03:25.454
What this is saying is we
need someway to measure

00:03:25.454 --> 00:03:28.500
what we've produced
and the best way we can

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:29.783
do it is say, how much
benefit are people getting

00:03:29.783 --> 00:03:31.450
and what they're willing
to pay for it in the

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:32.945
market is the best way that we can measure

00:03:32.945 --> 00:03:34.988
how much benefit they're actually getting

00:03:34.988 --> 00:03:35.992
out of it.

00:03:35.992 --> 00:03:40.717
For example, if someone in the year,

00:03:40.717 --> 00:03:46.119
I don't know, if an avocado was produced,

00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:49.864
if an avocado is produced in some farm

00:03:49.864 --> 00:03:53.363
and also an orange is produced,

00:03:53.363 --> 00:03:55.791
and an orange is produced,

00:03:55.791 --> 00:03:58.388
we won't say that for each of these,

00:03:58.388 --> 00:04:00.918
we won't say, oh GDP is
increased to buy one fruit

00:04:00.918 --> 00:04:02.529
we'd look at the market value for it.

00:04:02.529 --> 00:04:04.384
If the market value of this avocado is

00:04:04.384 --> 00:04:08.992
$1 and the market value of
this orange is 0.50 cents

00:04:08.992 --> 00:04:13.704
then by producing this fruit the GDP has

00:04:13.704 --> 00:04:15.781
increased by 0.50 cents by producing this

00:04:15.781 --> 00:04:18.971
avocado its GDP has increased by a dollar.

00:04:18.971 --> 00:04:22.652
In the next year, maybe there's whatever,

00:04:22.652 --> 00:04:25.057
demand for avocado's goes down or whatever

00:04:25.057 --> 00:04:27.525
and people pay less for
it and the market value

00:04:27.525 --> 00:04:30.051
of an incremental avocado is 0.50 cents,

00:04:30.051 --> 00:04:32.921
then in the next year
even though the actual

00:04:32.921 --> 00:04:35.331
number of fruit that
was produced is the same

00:04:35.331 --> 00:04:37.531
as the previous year, now all of a sudden

00:04:37.531 --> 00:04:39.534
the contribution from
avocado's might be the same

00:04:39.534 --> 00:04:41.414
as a contribution from oranges.

00:04:41.414 --> 00:04:44.267
It really depends on the market value.

00:04:44.267 --> 00:04:48.698
Then we can focus on this
all, the market value of all

00:04:48.698 --> 00:04:51.603
goods and services,
all goods and services.

00:04:51.603 --> 00:04:53.668
We would do all the different avocado's

00:04:53.668 --> 00:04:55.906
and oranges, but we would do computers,

00:04:55.906 --> 00:04:59.051
we would do cars, we would do tires,

00:04:59.051 --> 00:05:02.789
and we're doing services,
so if you have help

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:04.667
at home, if you go to the doctor;

00:05:04.667 --> 00:05:07.664
the market value of all of
those things are going to

00:05:07.664 --> 00:05:10.061
be put in to GDP.

00:05:10.061 --> 00:05:12.268
This won't include some things.

00:05:12.268 --> 00:05:16.132
This does not include,
this does not include

00:05:16.132 --> 00:05:17.669
illegal things.

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:19.076
If someone sells someone else drugs

00:05:19.076 --> 00:05:19.931
we're not keeping track of it.

00:05:19.931 --> 00:05:21.260
Some would argue that maybe it should be

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.062
kept track of in some
way, that you have this

00:05:23.062 --> 00:05:25.371
kind of black market in things,

00:05:25.371 --> 00:05:28.316
but you're not keeping track of illegal,

00:05:28.316 --> 00:05:30.222
(writing) illegal activity.

00:05:30.222 --> 00:05:32.268
And you're also not keeping track of goods

00:05:32.268 --> 00:05:34.338
and services that are produced within

00:05:34.338 --> 00:05:37.137
the household and consumed
within the household.

00:05:37.137 --> 00:05:42.145
For example, if you hire an outside person

00:05:42.145 --> 00:05:46.325
to babysit your child
that would be considered

00:05:46.325 --> 00:05:49.003
part of GDP, that is
a service that you are

00:05:49.003 --> 00:05:52.480
paying for, but if you,
yourself, are babysitting

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.813
your children that is not
going to be considered

00:05:54.813 --> 00:05:56.230
in GDP.

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:58.143
If I start a lawn-mowing business

00:05:58.143 --> 00:05:59.806
and I go mow other people's lawns,

00:05:59.806 --> 00:06:03.070
or maybe before my wife and I were dating,

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:05.736
she used to pay me to mow my lawns

00:06:05.736 --> 00:06:07.342
then it would be included in GDP,

00:06:07.342 --> 00:06:09.742
but maybe once we get
married I just mow her lawn

00:06:09.742 --> 00:06:12.878
because we're in the same family now

00:06:12.878 --> 00:06:15.069
then it will not be included in GDP.

00:06:15.069 --> 00:06:18.266
All does include pretty
much everything that

00:06:18.266 --> 00:06:21.952
can be tracked, anything where there is an

00:06:21.952 --> 00:06:24.052
exchange of money, there's some payment

00:06:24.052 --> 00:06:27.364
between two parties for
that good or service.

00:06:27.364 --> 00:06:28.727
Now a really interesting thing

00:06:28.727 --> 00:06:30.183
and this is something I
used to find confusing

00:06:30.183 --> 00:06:32.202
when I first got exposed to GDP,

00:06:32.202 --> 00:06:35.114
is the whole notion of
final goods and services.

00:06:35.114 --> 00:06:37.786
To understand this, let's think about,

00:06:37.786 --> 00:06:41.490
let's think about how
jeans might be produced.

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:45.725
You have a cotton farmer, a cotton farmer

00:06:45.725 --> 00:06:48.452
and there's some service
that needs to be performed

00:06:48.452 --> 00:06:52.114
so whatever some farming,
some labor that needs

00:06:52.114 --> 00:06:53.286
to be performed.

00:06:53.286 --> 00:06:55.927
Let's say that that is $5 of labor

00:06:55.927 --> 00:06:58.799
and let's say that some
land has to be rented.

00:06:58.799 --> 00:07:01.481
Let's say that that is $5
of ... I'll just make it

00:07:01.481 --> 00:07:04.710
a different number, $4 of land.

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:05.059
(writing) $4 of land.

00:07:05.059 --> 00:07:06.526
There are other inputs,
but we don't have to

00:07:06.526 --> 00:07:07.523
go into all the details.

00:07:07.523 --> 00:07:09.388
With that, there's going
to be some electricity

00:07:09.388 --> 00:07:11.659
and things like that, but
we won't count all of it.

00:07:11.659 --> 00:07:15.191
You can produce some cotton,
just the plant cotton.

00:07:15.191 --> 00:07:17.444
(writing) you can produce,
you can produce some

00:07:17.444 --> 00:07:18.857
cotton, some raw cotton.

00:07:18.857 --> 00:07:22.251
That raw cotton is worth,
the market value of that

00:07:22.251 --> 00:07:25.448
raw cotton is worth,
let's say it's worth $10.

00:07:25.448 --> 00:07:28.660
So, it's $10 worth of raw cotton.

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:32.552
Then you can take that raw cotton

00:07:32.552 --> 00:07:35.662
and you could combine
it with some more labor

00:07:35.662 --> 00:07:37.269
(writing) with some more labor

00:07:37.269 --> 00:07:39.131
so let's say you combine
that with another,

00:07:39.131 --> 00:07:41.160
I don't know, $6 of labor.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:44.077
(writing) $6 of labor

00:07:44.077 --> 00:07:45.933
and it would also probably require some

00:07:45.933 --> 00:07:47.744
machinery and electricity
and things like that,

00:07:47.744 --> 00:07:50.001
but I won't factor all of
those things in just now.

00:07:50.001 --> 00:07:52.571
We don't need them to
get the point across.

00:07:52.571 --> 00:07:54.995
If I do that, if I combine the $10,

00:07:54.995 --> 00:07:58.527
this intermediate good
with the $6 of labor

00:07:58.527 --> 00:08:01.468
then all of a sudden I
can produce cotton thread.

00:08:01.468 --> 00:08:05.321
(writing) I can produce, I
can produce cotton thread.

00:08:05.321 --> 00:08:07.528
That cotton, the worth of the market value

00:08:07.528 --> 00:08:10.198
of that cotton thread
let's say is now $20.

00:08:10.198 --> 00:08:12.203
(writing) is now $20

00:08:12.203 --> 00:08:13.742
And maybe there is another
intermediate good there,

00:08:13.742 --> 00:08:15.404
maybe it's some dye.

00:08:15.404 --> 00:08:18.266
We'll put the dye in
later, let's do the dye

00:08:18.266 --> 00:08:19.064
in later.

00:08:19.064 --> 00:08:21.532
I have a $20 thread,
and let's say I can take

00:08:21.532 --> 00:08:22.793
that $20 thread.

00:08:22.793 --> 00:08:25.175
(writing) I can take that $20 thread,

00:08:25.175 --> 00:08:28.196
stay with white just
because I started there.

00:08:28.196 --> 00:08:31.546
I can take that $20
thread and I can put in

00:08:31.546 --> 00:08:34.286
some more labor, maybe
I can take $10 of labor

00:08:34.286 --> 00:08:36.752
(writing) $10 of labor

00:08:36.752 --> 00:08:39.008
and then I can essentially create,

00:08:39.008 --> 00:08:42.105
it will essentially create $30 worth of,

00:08:42.105 --> 00:08:44.051
$30 of cotton fabric.

00:08:44.051 --> 00:08:47.072
(writing) $30 worth of cotton fabric.

00:08:47.072 --> 00:08:49.411
Then I can take that $30
worth of cotton fabric

00:08:49.411 --> 00:08:51.593
(writing) $30 worth of cotton fabric

00:08:51.593 --> 00:08:55.737
plus some more labor, let's
say another $5 of labor.

00:08:55.737 --> 00:08:57.861
(writing) $5 of labor

00:08:57.861 --> 00:08:59.996
and let's say we're also going to put in

00:08:59.996 --> 00:09:01.745
$1 of dye.

00:09:01.745 --> 00:09:04.743
(writing) $1 of dye right over here.

00:09:04.743 --> 00:09:06.735
In the process I can create,

00:09:06.735 --> 00:09:09.936
I can create the market value,

00:09:09.936 --> 00:09:11.742
let's say this is $50 worth of blue jeans.

00:09:11.742 --> 00:09:16.821
(writing) $50 worth, worth of, blue jeans,

00:09:16.821 --> 00:09:18.260
blue jeans.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.075
I do this all over the course of the year,

00:09:21.075 --> 00:09:22.570
so the period in question.

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:24.127
So the period for this
one I'll assume the period

00:09:24.127 --> 00:09:26.863
is a year, so it's all
happening over the course

00:09:26.863 --> 00:09:28.796
of the period in question.

00:09:28.796 --> 00:09:31.330
We're talking about the GDP in 2012,

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:33.461
this is all happening in 2012.

00:09:33.461 --> 00:09:36.664
What would be the contribution to GDP.

00:09:36.664 --> 00:09:38.465
If we didn't have the word final here,

00:09:38.465 --> 00:09:40.456
we just had the market value of all goods

00:09:40.456 --> 00:09:42.791
and services then we would add this $5

00:09:42.791 --> 00:09:45.403
to this $4 to this $10 to this $6

00:09:45.403 --> 00:09:48.193
and because of the
production of this jeans

00:09:48.193 --> 00:09:50.128
we would get a very, very large number,

00:09:50.128 --> 00:09:52.826
a very, very large contribution to GDP.

00:09:52.826 --> 00:09:54.992
But that would be, not
even double counting

00:09:54.992 --> 00:09:56.261
that would be triple, or quadrupling,

00:09:56.261 --> 00:09:58.771
or quintuple counting
the value that's actually

00:09:58.771 --> 00:09:59.934
being created because all of this value

00:09:59.934 --> 00:10:04.277
is essentially being
created for in this end $50.

00:10:04.277 --> 00:10:07.605
The actual contribution
to GDP you would only put

00:10:07.605 --> 00:10:10.603
the final good, so you
wouldn't include all of these

00:10:10.603 --> 00:10:12.684
other intermediary goods and services,

00:10:12.684 --> 00:10:15.121
you would just say this
whole chain of event

00:10:15.121 --> 00:10:20.196
results in a $50 increase in GDP.

00:10:20.196 --> 00:10:21.993
In another video we'll
talk about what happens

00:10:21.993 --> 00:10:24.130
if they don't get to this
point during the course

00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:26.404
of the year, if we just stop at one of the

00:10:26.404 --> 00:10:27.608
intermediary goods.

00:10:27.608 --> 00:10:29.605
Assuming you get to this
point, you just include

00:10:29.605 --> 00:10:31.790
the final good in GDP.

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:36.459
This last part of it is,
produced within a country.

00:10:36.459 --> 00:10:38.082
(writing) produced within a country.

00:10:38.082 --> 00:10:40.149
This is, you might have heard GNP,

00:10:40.149 --> 00:10:41.496
gross national product and that's the

00:10:41.496 --> 00:10:42.417
main difference.

00:10:42.417 --> 00:10:45.619
GDP says, let's say
we're talking about the

00:10:45.619 --> 00:10:48.209
United States, that's my best attempt at

00:10:48.209 --> 00:10:49.185
drawing the United States.

00:10:49.185 --> 00:10:51.686
GDP says look, if it was produced inside

00:10:51.686 --> 00:10:54.257
the country, if it was
produced inside the country,

00:10:54.257 --> 00:10:56.033
we don't care who it was produced by.

00:10:56.033 --> 00:10:57.853
It could have been
produced by someone from

00:10:57.853 --> 00:10:59.395
Mexico, or it could have been produced by

00:10:59.395 --> 00:11:01.307
someone from Canada, it
could have been a factory

00:11:01.307 --> 00:11:03.549
that's owned by the Chinese, but if it was

00:11:03.549 --> 00:11:06.803
produced within the borders
of the United States

00:11:06.803 --> 00:11:08.918
it gets counted as GDP.

00:11:08.918 --> 00:11:11.522
(writing) It gets counted as GDP.

00:11:11.522 --> 00:11:13.801
If an American, if an American who's an

00:11:13.801 --> 00:11:15.796
American national goes overseas

00:11:15.796 --> 00:11:18.055
and produces something,
that is not counted

00:11:18.055 --> 00:11:19.131
as GDP.

00:11:19.131 --> 00:11:21.966
If an American owns a
firm in another country

00:11:21.966 --> 00:11:24.387
and that firm in the
other country produces

00:11:24.387 --> 00:11:26.383
something, that is not the GDP.

00:11:26.383 --> 00:11:28.321
When you focus on peoples' nationality

00:11:28.321 --> 00:11:30.050
that is GNP.

00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:32.798
Not to confuse things,
but if you wanted to

00:11:32.798 --> 00:11:36.054
focus on GNP then you do
care about the earnings

00:11:36.054 --> 00:11:38.721
of American nationals and so you wouldn't

00:11:38.721 --> 00:11:40.803
count the Canadian, but you would include

00:11:40.803 --> 00:11:43.553
the American who's making money overseas.

00:11:43.553 --> 00:11:46.446
GDP fairly simple idea,
you say what's being

00:11:46.446 --> 00:11:47.928
produced within these boundaries,

00:11:47.928 --> 00:11:50.146
we don't care who's doing the producing

00:11:50.146 --> 00:11:52.142
and what their actual nationality is,

00:11:52.142 --> 00:11:54.555
and we're going to ignore production by

00:11:54.555 --> 00:11:58.153
that nationality outside of these borders.
