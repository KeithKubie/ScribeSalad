the holodeck and the question is when
 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.440
the holodeck and the question is when
will we be able to enter a room and

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450
will we be able to enter a room and
 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.730
will we be able to enter a room and

first of all in the future the internet
 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.410
first of all in the future the internet
will be in your contact lens you will

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420
will be in your contact lens you will
 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.990
will be in your contact lens you will
blink and you will go online you will

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000
blink and you will go online you will
 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.540
blink and you will go online you will
see individuals and their biography will

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550
see individuals and their biography will
 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.780
see individuals and their biography will
appear and subtitles will appear if they

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790
appear and subtitles will appear if they
 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.479
appear and subtitles will appear if they
speak in Chinese so you will always know

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489
speak in Chinese so you will always know
 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.940

language now think about this if you

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540
language now think about this if you
 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.840
language now think about this if you
have internet contact lenses then you

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850
have internet contact lenses then you
 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.880
have internet contact lenses then you
can imagine and conjure up different

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890
can imagine and conjure up different
 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.310
can imagine and conjure up different
kinds of bizarre universes just like in

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320
kinds of bizarre universes just like in
 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.950
kinds of bizarre universes just like in
the matrix you can be thrust into an

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960
the matrix you can be thrust into an
 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.810
the matrix you can be thrust into an
alien environment you could have

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820
alien environment you could have
 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.240

sorts of wondrous things take place

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719
sorts of wondrous things take place
 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.470
sorts of wondrous things take place
inside your contact lens but then the

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480
inside your contact lens but then the
 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.750
inside your contact lens but then the
trick is what happens if you move what

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760
trick is what happens if you move what
 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.060
trick is what happens if you move what
happens to be touch things well the

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070

called omnidirectional treadmills

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000
called omnidirectional treadmills
 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.870
called omnidirectional treadmills
it's a treadmill in any direction now I

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880
it's a treadmill in any direction now I
 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.850
it's a treadmill in any direction now I
had a chance to take a film crew from

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860
had a chance to take a film crew from
 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.160
had a chance to take a film crew from
the Science Channel down to Fort Benning

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170
the Science Channel down to Fort Benning
 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.910

Georgia where we filmed me inside the

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920
Georgia where we filmed me inside the
 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.010
Georgia where we filmed me inside the
omnidirectional treadmill I was

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020
omnidirectional treadmill I was
 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.539
omnidirectional treadmill I was
surrounded by 360-degree screens showing

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549
surrounded by 360-degree screens showing
 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.539
surrounded by 360-degree screens showing
the image of Baghdad I had a backpack

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549
the image of Baghdad I had a backpack
 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.929
the image of Baghdad I had a backpack
and then as I walked I could walk in any

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939
and then as I walked I could walk in any
 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.899
and then as I walked I could walk in any
direction and always wind up in the same

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909
direction and always wind up in the same
 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.260
direction and always wind up in the same
place but as I moved everything around

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270
place but as I moved everything around
 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.319
place but as I moved everything around
me moved the streets of Baghdad changed

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329
me moved the streets of Baghdad changed
 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.230
me moved the streets of Baghdad changed
every time I ran in any direction the

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240
every time I ran in any direction the
 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.030
every time I ran in any direction the
last thing that's missing is a sense of

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040
last thing that's missing is a sense of
 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.539
last thing that's missing is a sense of
touch

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549
touch
 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.380
touch
that's where haptic technology comes in

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390
that's where haptic technology comes in
 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.240
that's where haptic technology comes in
haptic technology is the ability to

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250
haptic technology is the ability to
 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.020
haptic technology is the ability to
create the feel of a virtual reality now

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030
create the feel of a virtual reality now
 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.569
create the feel of a virtual reality now
how does that work let's say you have a

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579
how does that work let's say you have a
 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.469
how does that work let's say you have a
platform with thousands of vertical pins

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479
platform with thousands of vertical pins
 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:05.480
platform with thousands of vertical pins
such that when you put your hand on this

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490
such that when you put your hand on this
 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.270
such that when you put your hand on this
platform the pins then conform to the

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280
platform the pins then conform to the
 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.160
platform the pins then conform to the
fingers because each pin is governed by

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170
fingers because each pin is governed by
 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.320
fingers because each pin is governed by
a computer therefore if you put your

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330
a computer therefore if you put your
 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.120
a computer therefore if you put your
hand on this set of pins

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130
hand on this set of pins
 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.330
hand on this set of pins
you can duplicate any texture that you

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340
you can duplicate any texture that you
 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.010
you can duplicate any texture that you
want so in some sense if you're

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020
want so in some sense if you're
 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.080
want so in some sense if you're
surrounded by these haptic devices

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090
surrounded by these haptic devices
 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.130
surrounded by these haptic devices
you'll be able to touch objects and

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140
you'll be able to touch objects and
 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.450
you'll be able to touch objects and
think that you were actually touching

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460
think that you were actually touching
 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.350
think that you were actually touching
skin or touching wood or touching metal

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360
skin or touching wood or touching metal
 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.540
skin or touching wood or touching metal
and then you have the Internet contact

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550
and then you have the Internet contact
 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.630
and then you have the Internet contact
lens and then you're surrounded by

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640
lens and then you're surrounded by
 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.890
lens and then you're surrounded by
360-degree screens with an

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900
360-degree screens with an
 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.050
360-degree screens with an
omnidirectional treadmill you're getting

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060
omnidirectional treadmill you're getting
 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.150
omnidirectional treadmill you're getting
awfully close to the matrix
