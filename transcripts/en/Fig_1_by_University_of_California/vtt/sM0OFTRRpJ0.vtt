00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.319
One of the cool things about superheroes
is that they rarely win battles

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.410
based on their superpowers alone and the
most common denominator that you see in

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.450
the movies that i think is often
overlooked is the usage of science and

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.179
engineering and technology and the story
behind the Captain America shield

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:23.560
according to the comics is that during
fighting of the Panzer Division tanks in

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.800
WW2, FDR tasked army scientist
named Myron MacLain for making a new steel

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.270
to make their tanks out of and he was
trying to make a tank hatch in a cast

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.280
shape and while he was doing the
experiment a mystery element fell in and

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.039
that mystery element ended up solidifying the material into what would later

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:48.320
become the shield. Captain America's
shield is an amazing piece of the comic book universe.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.440
It's one of the most
indestructible things and as an engineer

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.760
and as a scientist I seek to design
materials that can live in these

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.070
extremes especially with
transportation applications. If we can

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.030
get lighter and stronger then we get
more fuel-efficient.  There's been a major

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.550
example and that is the Ford F 150 which
is the most popular truck in North America.

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.780
Last year's Ford Model shifted
from using a steel frame to an aluminum frame.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.990
Which saves a lot of mileage and
increases the fuel economy of the

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.190
vehicle by taking over 700lbs out of
the frame of the vehicle and as we

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:31.610
continue to do this our vehicles will
become more and more efficient.

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.650
Myron MacLain gave up too easy

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.180
he was never able to duplicate the
shield and its microstructure and

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.460
for a material scientists or a researcher
to say "I found something cool I'm not

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.840
able to do it again" is not a thing
that anyone should be saying now.  As a

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.890
scientist we can look at individual
atoms of a material.  We have

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.400
computational codes that let us predict
things that we're not able to see.  I feel like

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.400
as a scientist I'm able to tackle
problems that society can't tackle alone.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.520
I feel that it's really really interesting
to get into science and see science in

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.810
the movies and I hope that people out
there could recognize that there's a lot

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.890
of opportunities to do those same kind
of things the superheroes do.
