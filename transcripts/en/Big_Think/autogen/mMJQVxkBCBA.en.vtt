so consciousness is one of the deepest
 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.839
so consciousness is one of the deepest
mysteries that we have ever attempted to

mysteries that we have ever attempted to
 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.909

studying consciousness is that it's very

studying consciousness is that it's very
 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.560
studying consciousness is that it's very
difficult to measure but there's we do

there's evidence that consciousness is

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360
of a continuous progression but in
 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.440
of a continuous progression but in
reality that can't be a continuous

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450
reality that can't be a continuous
 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.230
reality that can't be a continuous
progression because it's the taps that

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240
progression because it's the taps that
 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.170
progression because it's the taps that
came later that determined where you

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180
came later that determined where you

came later that determined where you
felt that the previous taps were

felt that the previous taps were
 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.940
felt that the previous taps were
occurring and if you think of something

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950
occurring and if you think of something
 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.870
occurring and if you think of something
like speech you're probably not aware of

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880
like speech you're probably not aware of
 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.430

my speech and a syllable by syllable
word by word manner you seems to be that

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390
word by word manner you seems to be that
 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.020
word by word manner you seems to be that
that we become conscious of

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030
that we become conscious of
 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.280
that we become conscious of
events all around us sort of in chunks

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290
events all around us sort of in chunks
 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.930
events all around us sort of in chunks
in which your unconscious mind reaches a

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940
in which your unconscious mind reaches a
 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.390
in which your unconscious mind reaches a
point of analysis by taking in sampling

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400
point of analysis by taking in sampling
 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.740
point of analysis by taking in sampling
everything that's happening around it

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750
everything that's happening around it
 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.370

before a subjective experience is

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380
before a subjective experience is
 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.690
before a subjective experience is
delivered into your conscious mind so I

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700
delivered into your conscious mind so I
 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.600
delivered into your conscious mind so I
think there's some suggestions that the

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610
think there's some suggestions that the
 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.610
think there's some suggestions that the
unconscious brain is continuously taking

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620
unconscious brain is continuously taking
 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.699
unconscious brain is continuously taking
in sampling events from through its

in sampling events from through its

in sampling events from through its
sensory organs waiting to appropriate

sensory organs waiting to appropriate
 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.330
sensory organs waiting to appropriate
points in the narrative to deliver

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340
points in the narrative to deliver
 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.970
points in the narrative to deliver
something a nice narrative of the world

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980
something a nice narrative of the world
 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.140
something a nice narrative of the world
around us into our conscious mind so in

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150
around us into our conscious mind so in
 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.199
around us into our conscious mind so in
the case of speech for example we don't

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209
the case of speech for example we don't
 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.930
the case of speech for example we don't
have an experience of a brief every

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940
have an experience of a brief every
 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.390
have an experience of a brief every
syllable syllable by syllable every word

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400
syllable syllable by syllable every word
 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.930
syllable syllable by syllable every word
by word but sometimes we have this

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940
by word but sometimes we have this
 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.750
by word but sometimes we have this
chunking that happens so for example if

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760
chunking that happens so for example if
 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.690
chunking that happens so for example if
I say the mousepad was beside the

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700
I say the mousepad was beside the
 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.350
I say the mousepad was beside the
computer in that case the mouse could

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360
computer in that case the mouse could
 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.759
computer in that case the mouse could
have another meaning the mouse could

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769
have another meaning the mouse could
 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:23.130
have another meaning the mouse could
mean a rodent or it could be the

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140
mean a rodent or it could be the
 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.080
mean a rodent or it could be the
mousepad of a computer but you only knew

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090
mousepad of a computer but you only knew
 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.240
mousepad of a computer but you only knew
the meaning of the word Mouse with the

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250
the meaning of the word Mouse with the
 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.160
the meaning of the word Mouse with the
word in this case that came after the

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170
word in this case that came after the
 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.440
word in this case that came after the
word Mouse so the mousepad I could have

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450
word Mouse so the mousepad I could have
 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.080
word Mouse so the mousepad I could have
said the mouse was hungry so the meaning

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090
said the mouse was hungry so the meaning
 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.259
said the mouse was hungry so the meaning
of the word Mouse can only be understood

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269
of the word Mouse can only be understood
 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.289
of the word Mouse can only be understood
based on what comes after that so it

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:40.299
based on what comes after that so it
 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:44.240
based on what comes after that so it
seems that when people understand that

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250
seems that when people understand that
 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.920
seems that when people understand that
they are seeing might have to wait to

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930
they are seeing might have to wait to
 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.300
they are seeing might have to wait to
the appropriate time to create a

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310
the appropriate time to create a
 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.090
the appropriate time to create a
conscious perception or a conscious

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100
conscious perception or a conscious
 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.039
conscious perception or a conscious
interpretation of what we're listening

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049
interpretation of what we're listening
 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:55.620
interpretation of what we're listening
to so I think there's mounting evidence

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630
to so I think there's mounting evidence
 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.310
to so I think there's mounting evidence
that consciousness is not a linear flow

00:03:59.310 --> 00:03:59.320
that consciousness is not a linear flow
 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.740
that consciousness is not a linear flow
of what's happening around us but sort

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.759
