1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:01,843
Yeah.

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:05,300
Hey, what's going on? Is Bill Burn?
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

3
00:00:05,301 --> 00:00:08,240
Just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast and

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,090
[inaudible] just checking
in. Are you? Hey,

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,880
what's going on?
How's your week going?

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,330
Is it going good?
That is good.

7
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:25,070
You're keeping your head
above the fucking water. Um,

8
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:29,090
I'm having, it's a great, we,
I'm having the best of times.

9
00:00:29,091 --> 00:00:33,710
I'm having the worst of times.
My fucking phone, my phone.

10
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:37,670
I don't know what's going on with it.
Nothing on it says it needs to be updated,

11
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:41,120
but it keeps saying that it needs to be
updated and now it won't connect to my,

12
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:46,400
my wireless cell phone carrier.
Sometimes it does.

13
00:00:46,401 --> 00:00:49,430
Sometimes it doesn't. Oh, I'll look
at it. Oh, what is it doing now?

14
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:54,140
What is it doing now?
I can't tell if I fucking fixed it or not.

15
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:59,060
You know what? These fucking assholes
at apple do these fucking assholes.

16
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:03,830
Do you remember back in the day you could
opt out and not update your phone and

17
00:01:03,831 --> 00:01:08,810
you could keep it forever? So
they're like, oh God forbid God. God,

18
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,700
that did one fucking nickel.

19
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:16,280
Those cheap fucking money grubbing
corporate cons. God for fucking bid.

20
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:20,870
One fucking nickel rolls out the
window that they feel belongs,

21
00:01:20,871 --> 00:01:24,050
rightfully belongs in their pocket.
So now where do they do now?

22
00:01:24,051 --> 00:01:25,700
You can't opt out of the update.

23
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:30,350
Now you have to update the phone and it's
all designed to fill up your old phone,

24
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:33,680
right? So then you fucking bring
the fucking thing in. Yeah.

25
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,640
And then you got to get
the one that like take,

26
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:39,080
takes a picture of your
face or whatever it does.

27
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,610
And then now we will take
your old phone until what?

28
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:48,770
Give it to the poor bastard in Philippines
that had a fucking put the thing

29
00:01:48,771 --> 00:01:53,260
together.
Here's your reward.

30
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:54,350
Yeah.

31
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:57,560
For working in our fucking factory
for 20 fucking hours a day,

32
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:02,600
making these new iPhone 19 so we're
going to give you the old iPhone seven

33
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:07,680
way to go there, buddy. You know, and
then, and if you don't do that, yeah,

34
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:10,420
just fucking throw the things out.
And they end up in the fucking ocean.

35
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:13,810
And like somehow these people
aren't the fucking problem.

36
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:18,010
These people are let, let's go to
the other fucking side of the world.

37
00:02:18,011 --> 00:02:19,780
Blow $1 billion a fucking month,

38
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,960
fighting 3,500 jerk offs
on a fucking jungle gym.

39
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:27,850
But these cunts who are polluting the
ocean have poisoned the fucking food

40
00:02:27,851 --> 00:02:30,100
supply.
Turned it into God knows what.

41
00:02:30,101 --> 00:02:33,100
You got nine year olds walking around
with fucking mustaches cause there's so

42
00:02:33,101 --> 00:02:35,350
much fucking human growth hormone,

43
00:02:35,351 --> 00:02:39,730
whatever the fuck they're putting in the
Goddamn Shit, right? And not the problem.

44
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,370
Really.
That's all fucking isis has to do.

45
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:47,730
Just spend 300 grand on a
fucking chicken Parmesan plate to

46
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,293
okay.

47
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,470
Help finance your fucking campaign.

48
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,320
Then they're in the clear that's
all they need to do. Sorry.

49
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:59,620
That's how far I take it with a
fucking update on my phone. Hey Bill,

50
00:02:59,621 --> 00:03:02,590
why don't you just give in man,
everybody's gonna do it, man.

51
00:03:02,591 --> 00:03:05,530
Go get the fucking phone with you
if you have your face recognition.

52
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:08,230
I'm in plain like this.
Mental tennis.

53
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,510
I keep threatening to leave
apple like fuck these guys.

54
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:17,800
Cause my laptop's almost
full. My, uh, my cell phone.

55
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,000
I don't know what's going on with it.

56
00:03:19,001 --> 00:03:23,740
It seems to be working when I'm
around my house, but it's Hilarious,

57
00:03:23,741 --> 00:03:26,080
right when I need the fucking thing,
it shuts off,

58
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:30,580
which makes me feel like the computer
content in it is looking at my calendar.

59
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:34,960
Oh, he needs, he needs to do a radio
tour. You know the phones just like, God,

60
00:03:34,961 --> 00:03:36,460
I think we'll just shut down now.

61
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:41,590
Last night I had to call in the fucking
sports gambling podcast was Sean Green

62
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:46,240
and Ryan Kramer.
All right.

63
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,130
Which still be playing
on this show tonight.

64
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,060
Actually, no, I'm sorry. I'll be
playing it later on in my podcast.

65
00:03:54,061 --> 00:03:54,751
Right before the,

66
00:03:54,751 --> 00:03:57,840
the throwback episode we'll be playing
and after I'm done ranting about my

67
00:03:57,841 --> 00:04:00,000
fucking phone,
um,

68
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:05,880
you know, I'm actually
considering leaving, but then,
you know, somebody said,

69
00:04:05,881 --> 00:04:10,140
well apple actually pushed back against
the FBI, you know, on the privacy thing.

70
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:13,250
And it's just like, what?
Then they're also doing all
this fucking creepy shit. I,

71
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,570
you know, the worst fucking move I
ever made was getting a smartphone.

72
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:22,270
All right. I should have stayed with the
flip phone, but now I got the smartphone.

73
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,600
You know, it's like you're riding first
class and I, you have to go back to coach.

74
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:31,390
But I'm really considering considering,
you know,

75
00:04:31,391 --> 00:04:34,720
maybe I'll get like a second phone for
all these fucking radio tour things that

76
00:04:34,721 --> 00:04:36,190
I have to do that I love doing.

77
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,580
Calling in all these great shows
that it helped me promote my shows.

78
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:42,610
Maybe I'll just do that because I'd never
heard of anybody talking about their

79
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:46,180
day flip phone fucking crapping out.
Really. Does that make me a hipster?

80
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:50,620
If I get one of those?
Um, I dunno, you know,

81
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:52,270
Goddamn well it'd be down the apple store.

82
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:56,470
Here's the iPhone 10 show us your face.
Okay.

83
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:58,010
Yeah,

84
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:00,710
I'm trusting you won't do
anything elicit with that.

85
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:05,780
Everything's above board even though
you're not concerned with polluting the

86
00:05:05,781 --> 00:05:09,920
fucking environment. I mean, to be honest
with you, like with these corporations,

87
00:05:09,921 --> 00:05:12,800
like when, when, when does it
fucking stop these fucking bankers?

88
00:05:12,801 --> 00:05:16,580
When does it fucking stop?
It's unreal and you can't say anything.

89
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:19,730
You fucking say anything. They
label you as socialist. It's like,

90
00:05:19,731 --> 00:05:23,120
I'm not the one pollutant, the fucking
oceans. I'm fine with this phone.

91
00:05:23,121 --> 00:05:25,040
How much better does
the camera have to be?

92
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:28,790
We're going to be able to count the
pores on my fucking relatives faces.

93
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:33,050
It's fine. You did a bang
up job. How about this?

94
00:05:33,051 --> 00:05:35,150
How about you own the phone and
I'll fucking rented from you.

95
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:37,810
Okay.

96
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:42,110
Every read much more forward.
Everything must be a little bit better.

97
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:43,503
Okay.

98
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:48,070
Someone shows up to work.
They have the better phone.

99
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:49,860
Yeah.

100
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:54,390
It makes the others feel less than,
um,

101
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:58,310
anyways, so that I got, I got rid of the
worst part of week, which is that shit.

102
00:05:58,311 --> 00:05:59,810
And of course I have to um,

103
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:05,720
fly out early tomorrow morning to go
to Saginaw, Michigan, which by the way,

104
00:06:05,721 --> 00:06:08,130
I just found out from some
of my relatives than, uh,

105
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,900
my great grandparents had a house
out there like a hundred years ago.

106
00:06:11,901 --> 00:06:16,160
So I have the address. No,
I won't be saying it. Yes,

107
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:18,380
I put it in my phone.
Yes.

108
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:22,970
Steve jobs from beyond the grave is
already fucking in fucking drone with his

109
00:06:22,971 --> 00:06:25,400
spirit hovering over it so
they can capture me there.

110
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:30,930
There's some fucking face recognition
about the top of my head, whatever the,

111
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,330
whatever the fuck those creeps
are trying to do over there.

112
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:35,930
Like some of these people,

113
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,590
they literally have to put nets outside
their factory to prevent people from

114
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,790
leaping to their fucking deaths.
And for some reason they're not a problem.

115
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,850
It's not a fucking problem. Look, the
other fucking way, I don't get it. Um,

116
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:56,000
um, anyways, plowing ahead. So
I'll be in Saginaw, Michigan,

117
00:06:56,001 --> 00:06:58,370
which I've never performed there,
so I'm very excited.

118
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:00,560
MMM.

119
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,390
To go there. Uh, my hour,

120
00:07:03,391 --> 00:07:06,200
I got an hour and a half right now and
it is more than ready to be recorded.

121
00:07:06,201 --> 00:07:08,600
So freckles got to figure out when
he's going to do is next special.

122
00:07:08,601 --> 00:07:11,300
Cause last night I did a private Gig,
um,

123
00:07:11,301 --> 00:07:14,810
for this Jewish community and ed and um,

124
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:18,520
but I had such a great time.
I was only supposed to do a half hour.

125
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:21,590
I felt like I was on stage for 20 minutes
and I looked down and I had done an

126
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:26,410
hour. So then the psych, right. This
is, uh, it's time, it's time to go.

127
00:07:26,411 --> 00:07:31,090
But I had such a good time at
that fucking Gig, you know,

128
00:07:31,091 --> 00:07:35,560
usually I don't like to perform in front
of like all like one group of people,

129
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,293
you know?

130
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:38,480
Yeah.

131
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,480
Cause everybody has the same perspective
and then it kind of closes down what

132
00:07:41,481 --> 00:07:46,480
you can talk about. Um, but this crowd
last night was day. What they were, uh,

133
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:50,690
they anywhere they were amazing. You
know, his buddy of mine book the thing

134
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:55,330
and uh, we were backstage
and he had cigars and shit.
It was just like, what am I,

135
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:59,840
one of my favorite gigs
of the year. And, um,

136
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:02,750
I gotta be honest with you,
like I've, I've really fucking,

137
00:08:02,751 --> 00:08:06,470
I'm learning how not to get in
arguments with people, you know,

138
00:08:06,471 --> 00:08:09,260
cause we were just talking about
all this shit and then he brings up,

139
00:08:09,261 --> 00:08:12,800
what do you think about Israel?
I'm like, oh, I get sick, dude.

140
00:08:12,801 --> 00:08:14,210
I'm not gonna fucking
get into this with you.

141
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:21,860
What to think about it. I mean, what
do you want foot? It's like everything.

142
00:08:21,861 --> 00:08:25,790
It starts with a good idea how it's
executed. Is that the best idea? I don't,

143
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:29,210
I don't know. I think there's
mistakes made up both sides.

144
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:32,750
And then it's literally like trying to
talk to a sports fan when they can't see

145
00:08:32,751 --> 00:08:34,340
anything that their team does wrong.

146
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,970
So he started to get into it and
I was just like, you know what?

147
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:41,750
Fair enough. What do you think
about the red sox Astros? Like,

148
00:08:41,751 --> 00:08:43,610
I'm not going to get into
this fucking debate with you.

149
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:46,990
You know?
Um,

150
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:52,100
and we avoided this huge fucking
debate on something that I have.

151
00:08:52,101 --> 00:08:54,680
I'm not really well read on,
but the old me,

152
00:08:54,681 --> 00:08:58,740
I would dove right in both fucking feet,
you know what I mean?

153
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:02,340
Comparing this country
with the native Americans,

154
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:05,550
I was prepared to do all of that,
none of which I'm well read on.

155
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,140
And I was just like,
you know what pill?

156
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:10,290
Why don't you just shut the fuck up
and smoke your cigar? So I just said,

157
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:14,040
you know, fair enough. Why am I
going to get this guy all stirred up,

158
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:19,640
speaking in third of a fact that I
overheard and a fucking airport and let it

159
00:09:20,221 --> 00:09:24,240
go. And it was great. You know,
here's another great part of my week.

160
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:29,270
The fucking Red Sox beat the New York
Yankees and another playoff series that's

161
00:09:30,061 --> 00:09:33,670
two in a row. You know,
we're on a hell of a run.

162
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:36,850
I think they beat us like while I guess
not the place, but you know what I mean.

163
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,640
They beat us up.
I think this is our century.

164
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:45,933
MMM.

165
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:49,760
All right. Here's the deal. You know,
but you know me, I don't fucking rub it.

166
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,400
All right.
I want to congratulate the Yankees on a,

167
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:57,490
on a hundred wins season and the direction
that they are going in because those

168
00:09:58,161 --> 00:10:01,400
guys, they're going to be a
force and asthma for Yankee fans.

169
00:10:01,401 --> 00:10:04,220
As much as this one hurt.
Um,

170
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:08,840
it's going to make like
those your team feeling,

171
00:10:08,841 --> 00:10:12,500
that feeling of fucking losing,
they're not gonna want to feel it again.

172
00:10:12,501 --> 00:10:16,070
And I already thought that they
were, they were playing great. Um,

173
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:20,770
and I'm not going to sit there and act
like I'm a GM and I know what PC you need.

174
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:26,080
Um, oh, now what to say. Now look at, look
at, look at my fucking now my computer.

175
00:10:26,081 --> 00:10:29,980
One fucking start back up. All
right, here we go. Um, but, uh,

176
00:10:29,981 --> 00:10:32,500
it was just a great series and,
um,

177
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:36,830
being a,
I dunno,

178
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:40,010
it's just grateful baseball when
those two teams come together and uh,

179
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:45,170
yeah. And I realized when I was watching
it that I don't hate the Yankees.

180
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,730
I mean it, how can you hate the greatest
fucking organization, 27 championships?

181
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:53,240
You can't get mad at that, you know,
and I don't even hate their fans.

182
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:58,390
It's just that small segment
of fan that if they won,

183
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,553
you know,

184
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:05,300
the amount of shit that they would've
talked would have been just like,

185
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,600
I'm like,
did you see like in the eighth inning,

186
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:13,630
right when we loaded up the basis in the
clincher and that stud came out for the

187
00:11:14,241 --> 00:11:17,010
Yankees and he just pitched him
out of the situation or whatever.

188
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,310
And you're out of the situation. He
put himself in, I can't even remember.

189
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:20,330
It was a fucking blur.

190
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,920
And when he struck out that
dude with the bases loaded,

191
00:11:24,921 --> 00:11:26,180
when he went to the Dugout,

192
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,720
those two fat fucks like
ringing up the last batter act.

193
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:35,140
Like those are the more on
say like, Oh damn. Oh Damn.

194
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:37,813
Yeah.

195
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:40,740
Those fucking mouth breathing morons.

196
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:46,140
Those are the ones straight across the
board in sports that patriots have those

197
00:11:46,141 --> 00:11:48,720
fans, red sox have of, you know,
I'm not saying all of their fans,

198
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:53,500
they just have those fucking
people and they're the ones that,

199
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:58,640
um, they're the ones that
ruin it. You know, like the,

200
00:11:58,641 --> 00:12:02,570
those are the ones that like if I actually
sat across from them when they got

201
00:12:02,571 --> 00:12:05,900
over the fact that I was a red sox fan
and I wanted to talk to the rivalry,

202
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,930
I could never get past like a,

203
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:11,720
a bug. They bufo a Joe, his fucking stupid

204
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,280
like those people. It's
just like, all right.

205
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:18,810
So that was the only time I felt
hate in that series. What is,

206
00:12:18,811 --> 00:12:22,290
when I saw those fucking idiots, and
I gotta be honest with you, dude,

207
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:25,600
uh,
this is embarrassing to say,

208
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:30,870
but the level of mouth breather when
they painted the crowd in Yankee Stadium

209
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:34,600
and at Fenway Park is just unparalleled.

210
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:40,770
It's in Philly too. I don't know
what it is. You know what I mean?

211
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:45,690
It goes down south. He got the southern
bell, yet the fucking good old boy.

212
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:50,040
You go out Midwest, you get those people
dress like Pete Carroll, you know,

213
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:52,800
just like how does a person
in their 20s dress like that?

214
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,780
Then you go out to the west coast,
they got their own vibe, you know,

215
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:03,570
and, but like I'm telling the east coast
like I gotta I gotta be honest with you.

216
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:06,730
Like we,
we have corner.

217
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:10,030
It's so weird cause you have some of
the smartest fucking people like Boston,

218
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:15,040
New York have a real similarity there
where both cities are re really ride on

219
00:13:17,751 --> 00:13:21,230
the coattails of the amount of
smart people that moved to the city.

220
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:27,420
You know, Boston has, they have
high avid, they got fucking MIT,

221
00:13:27,421 --> 00:13:31,050
they got bu, Emerson College, all
these places where all these smart,

222
00:13:31,051 --> 00:13:33,750
talented kids come into the city

223
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:40,410
juxtaposed to the locals
in New York.

224
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:42,060
You got all that bridge and tunnel,

225
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:46,260
all these fucking people that
move into Manhattan, you know,

226
00:13:46,261 --> 00:13:48,180
and really make it what it is.

227
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:53,420
And then he's dead dead.
He's dodged.

228
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:59,490
Oh do these fucking morons sweatpants,

229
00:13:59,491 --> 00:14:03,390
Hoodie,
fucking tad stake Eaton fucking mouth.

230
00:14:03,391 --> 00:14:07,590
Breathing mouth breathing fucking morons.
Um,

231
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,980
I got a kick out of that and I am one
of those fucking morons, by the way.

232
00:14:10,981 --> 00:14:11,221
I'm not,

233
00:14:11,221 --> 00:14:14,220
I'm not trying to be a Goddamn elitists
tier now that he moved out the fucking

234
00:14:14,221 --> 00:14:19,040
phony ass Hollywood. I'm not looking
down my adorable little nose at,

235
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:23,110
you know, I am not. I was that guy.

236
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:25,100
I was that guy out in
the fucking outfield.

237
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:28,210
We wanted to make his section laugh
who was loud fucking drunk. I did that.

238
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:33,100
Plenty of games. It's gotta be some sort
of security footage out there of it.

239
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:38,740
Um, anyways, so sale comes in
the eighth inning and just,

240
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:42,280
I mean for a red sox fan
versus the Yankees, I mean,

241
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:46,120
I don't think you ever get over fucking
2003 the seventh and eighth fucking

242
00:14:46,121 --> 00:14:49,750
innings and then it's just
like those innings, you know,

243
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:54,380
all the way back to Bucky
makes you fucking nervous and

244
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,433
okay,

245
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,200
he fucking just cruise right through
the eighth inning and like, oh my God,

246
00:14:59,201 --> 00:15:00,610
we have a three run fucking lead.

247
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:05,460
And then I see Cam roll up and I'm
just like, don't put that guy in.

248
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:09,630
How about the fucking guy in the seventh
inning with the Bob Stanley Torso.

249
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,730
I don't know anybody's fucking
names anymore. I've got a kid,

250
00:15:11,731 --> 00:15:15,440
I don't have time to figure this shit out.
I was going like, oh this motherfucker,

251
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:20,210
look at this. How is he
decide to shape with all the,

252
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:21,950
all the exercise videos out there,

253
00:15:21,951 --> 00:15:25,970
all the fucking nutritionist all
look at this guy. Look at this guy.

254
00:15:25,971 --> 00:15:29,960
He should have that fucking cop utility
belt on when he's out there pitching.

255
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:36,130
So anyways,
he does great fucking sales.

256
00:15:36,131 --> 00:15:37,150
Shuts them down.

257
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:41,980
Then Kimberly comes out and what it
proceeds to load the fucking basis.

258
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:44,410
And I'm telling you,
I thought I was past it.

259
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:47,530
I kept telling him all I wanted
to see him do was when it wants.

260
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:52,060
They've won it three times.
Come on down from three three Oh you know,

261
00:15:52,061 --> 00:15:55,560
all three took to win.
You know,

262
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:59,370
biggest comeback in baseball
history. I'm good. I,

263
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,310
I really thought that. I
believe that. And then I just,

264
00:16:02,311 --> 00:16:04,350
the night that he came and I
could not stay in the room,

265
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,790
I want to apologize

266
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:12,230
to Kimbro for all this shit I
said about him in that Anagen

267
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:18,891
uh,
God,

268
00:16:18,891 --> 00:16:23,330
I was out in the kitchen between pitches
and I would run and I poked my head in

269
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,360
another ball and have you then I would
just Tourette's walking out and my

270
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:29,090
daughter was asleep. So I'm like
whispering, she's fucking pushed off.

271
00:16:29,091 --> 00:16:33,560
Fucking strike you fucking cunt, right?
You fucking red baron and fucking God.

272
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,590
What the fuck would Julie
fucking style in there?

273
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:38,643
Okay.

274
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:43,360
So anyways,
when that's they,

275
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:47,870
they then it's forwarded to, then it's
fucking 40th. He, it's a fucking bad.

276
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:51,910
Or to make it four to two hits,
a batter with the bases loaded,

277
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:54,250
walks in a fucking run basically,
or whatever.

278
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:58,870
He hits a bad run in Dennis sac fly.
Now it's four to fucking three.

279
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:05,220
Those fat mouth breathers, I can see a
fucking freaking out the jelly bodies.

280
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,690
And then there's a slow dribbler
down to the third baseline.

281
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,890
And I'm like, oh my God, this
going to be an infield hit.

282
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:19,030
And then he calls the fucking dude
out and I did the most embarrassing

283
00:17:19,031 --> 00:17:23,500
celebration dance and um,
dental,

284
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,980
like it's under review. And I'm
like, oh my God, is this game tied?

285
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,260
Are they going to tell me that
this fucking game is tied?

286
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:34,240
And then of course they came back and
said that it wasn't, but Jesus Christ,

287
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:39,420
I can't believe how much I still care.
It's fucking ridiculous.

288
00:17:39,421 --> 00:17:44,190
So then I texted a buddy of mine from
back in the day and I was just like,

289
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:48,090
did you ever think you'd see the red sox
drink champagne in the fucking Yankee

290
00:17:48,091 --> 00:17:52,320
stadiums you twice in your life?
This is unbelievable.

291
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:56,910
And then he wrote back to me,
it's dead. It's really dead.

292
00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:01,530
All that fucking Bucky dent shit is dead.
And I laugh.

293
00:18:01,531 --> 00:18:05,970
And I was like, yeah, but guys like you
and me are still going to have, you know,

294
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:11,250
post traumatic stress disorder from
all of those times where it wasn't.

295
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:16,170
And he was like laughing going, yeah. So
I think there's like this weird sort of,

296
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:18,810
um,

297
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:23,160
it's schism the word between
red sox fans right now.

298
00:18:23,161 --> 00:18:27,840
There's the people that lived through it
and the people that don't know anything

299
00:18:27,841 --> 00:18:31,410
but what's going on right now.
And I like being around those people.

300
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,080
The second ones,
the ones who are just thinking positive,

301
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,630
cause I actually found
myself saying positive shit.

302
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:41,310
He's going to strike this palm out. Come
on now. Go ahead and break their hearts.

303
00:18:41,311 --> 00:18:42,300
They're all fucking chairman.

304
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,460
I remember when Yankee Stadium
used to get really loud,

305
00:18:44,461 --> 00:18:46,380
I would get all fucking nervous going out.
God,

306
00:18:46,381 --> 00:18:49,170
they just gonna we'll them in there.
What's fucking jade are going to do,

307
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:52,620
you know? Um, so anyways,

308
00:18:52,621 --> 00:18:55,380
I can't believe that we want it and I
really thought that we were going to lose

309
00:18:55,381 --> 00:18:58,560
that series.
And I also feel that if we fucking blue,

310
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:04,320
if we blew game four, I didn't see
us coming back winning game five. Um,

311
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,191
I just didn't.

312
00:19:05,191 --> 00:19:08,670
So now we're under the fucking Houston
Astros who nobody is talking about for

313
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:11,370
whatever God damn reason
went through the Indians,

314
00:19:11,371 --> 00:19:16,200
like a buzz saw and scary Terry Francona.
Um,

315
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:23,130
I dunno, l today and all of these
fucking guys, these guys are like,

316
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:28,680
these guys had dialed in. So we will
see how we do and we need fucking price

317
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:32,580
to, uh, to finally get a victory.

318
00:19:32,581 --> 00:19:36,120
I know a lot of you guys do what's with
this we stuff, I hate people who say we,

319
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:40,470
well, I'll tell you why I
say we cause people go, if
you say we won, they're like,

320
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:44,820
oh you didn't win. But if you fucking
lose it's like yeah, you guys suck.

321
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:50,370
You know, you guys fucking suck. You guys
choked. You guys fucking blew it. Right?

322
00:19:50,371 --> 00:19:53,280
But then all of a sudden you win if he
say if you use the Pronoun [inaudible]

323
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:57,510
right.
Can you still use that Pronoun by the way?

324
00:19:57,511 --> 00:20:01,270
Or did somebody who wants to fucking have
that balls put on their knee and their

325
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:06,190
deck on their ear? Fucking we, who's we?

326
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:11,160
Me and my Dick and my balls.
I'm sorry.

327
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:16,140
Anyways, plowing ahead. So like
I mentioned, I'm in Saginaw,

328
00:20:16,141 --> 00:20:20,790
Michigan and this is all leading up to uh,

329
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:24,210
my last big shows of the year,
November 7th.

330
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:29,100
I am going to be at Madison Square Garden.
I am going to be recording that night,

331
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:33,270
hopefully successfully this
time to put out a goddamn album.

332
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,310
Last time.
As you remember,

333
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:40,460
I had the set of my life and they didn't
understand what I was trying to do and

334
00:20:40,501 --> 00:20:42,570
they only took the sound from the board.

335
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,660
So it was just me really
loud on my microphone.

336
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,040
Sounding ridiculously in front of

337
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:52,480
about eight people. Um, so I'm gonna try,

338
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,070
I'm gonna try to fucking do that again.

339
00:20:54,071 --> 00:20:57,640
And then after that I have three nights
at the unbelievable Chicago theater,

340
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,800
arguably the greatest marquis.

341
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:03,790
I think it's the greatest marquis
and all these show business. Um,

342
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:09,860
and with that I would read
some advertising. There we
go. Um, oh look who's here,

343
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:14,230
right? All me go. Oh. Migo oh, me go.

344
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:17,310
Oh my go.
I'm never going to know how to say this.

345
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,480
A revolutionary toilet seat replacement.

346
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:24,010
Are you anal about
cleanliness in the bathroom?

347
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:29,710
What if I told you I could change
the way you poop? Jesus Christ.

348
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,500
Um,
have you ever really thought about poop?

349
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:35,620
That just sounds like a wet one coming
right out of your ass. You know,

350
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,880
it sounds like the noise it makes.

351
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,060
Have you ever really thought
about wiping with toilet paper?

352
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:44,380
Like really thought about it.
I'll give you a chance right now.

353
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:51,700
Motivate your audience. Talk about
your experience with all me. Go.

354
00:21:51,701 --> 00:21:56,020
Oh my go. Uh, I haven't used it
yet. It sounds like the poor man's,

355
00:21:56,230 --> 00:22:00,340
but a choose one to two copy points
to rotate in your spot. All right.

356
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:03,610
Washes you in all the right places.
Yo.

357
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:07,480
You take a shit you can wipe
your ass cheek all you want,

358
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:10,390
but that's not going to
fix the problem. Uh, that,

359
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:15,130
that's what they're doing in Washington.
Um, that would be my campaign slogan.

360
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,080
I think it's tying this country.

361
00:22:17,081 --> 00:22:21,660
Stop wiping their ass cheeks and I got
down to business. What's the asshole? Oh,

362
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:25,780
I like this guy. He makes
sense. Pick talks like me.

363
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:29,950
Adjust the water temperature position,
pressure with movement.

364
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:32,680
Feels like you just took a shower.
I gotta tell you some,

365
00:22:32,681 --> 00:22:36,460
I've used a bad day before. It was fuck
made me laugh my ass off, no pun intended.

366
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:41,260
But I cannot even begin to tell you the
fresh feeling I fed afterwards, you know.

367
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:46,360
Anyways, it feels like you just took
a shower. It features a heated seat,

368
00:22:46,361 --> 00:22:50,760
a nightlife, soft closing,
air, dry, remote control.

369
00:22:50,761 --> 00:22:55,300
Deodorize carbon filter eliminates odors.

370
00:22:56,890 --> 00:23:00,850
Say Goodbye to toilet paper, save
trees, water and electricity.

371
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:05,260
US alone uses 36 million rolls
of toilet paper in one day.

372
00:23:05,261 --> 00:23:07,810
It's quick and easy. I've come around
to these guys, you know what I mean?

373
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:11,800
Cause I know that that thing uses a bunch
of energy with the electricity and all

374
00:23:11,801 --> 00:23:13,000
of that type of shit.
But you know,

375
00:23:13,001 --> 00:23:15,850
there's not a bunch of paper going
into the water. At least this,

376
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,690
no separating that you have
to do down at the fucking Mil.

377
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:23,200
Whatever the hell they do anyways. Plus
you can install it in just 20 minutes,

378
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,940
20 minutes. Well, if you just
have an analog toilet seat,

379
00:23:27,941 --> 00:23:32,200
I mean you can put it in about fucking
two minutes, but we'll it wash your ass.

380
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:35,370
You know, you can't have your
cake and eat it. People, uh,

381
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:40,060
do your business at Omi
go, oh Amigo. Oh my go. Uh,

382
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:45,310

when you go to m. Y. O, m, I,

383
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:49,940
g. O, d. O, t, c o m. Slash. B. U. R. R.

384
00:23:49,941 --> 00:23:52,700
That's all me go. Oh my go. Oh,

385
00:23:52,701 --> 00:23:56,120
am I a g o go to all me,

386
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:59,930
Dot Com slash burger at $100 off.
The future's weird at first.

387
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:04,160
Let it be weird. Ooh, get a little
creepy there in the end. All right.

388
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:08,750
Legal Zoom, legal, zoom. Uh,

389
00:24:08,751 --> 00:24:11,570
you know the saying time is money.
It's true,

390
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,490
especially when you run your own business.

391
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:17,090
But running a successful business
involves taxes, contracts,

392
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:21,080
and a whole lot of fine print things
that eat up too much of your time. Well,

393
00:24:21,081 --> 00:24:24,620
it's time to turn to legal zoom.

408
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:24,830
Oh, last but not least. Oh, I
like these guys. Butcher box,

409
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:28,910
butcher blocks, dude. Um,

410
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:33,860
butcher box delivers healthy 100% grass
fed and grass finished beef free range,

411
00:25:33,861 --> 00:25:36,890
organic chicken and heritage, bread, pork.

412
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:41,950
The greatest fucking meat I've
ever tasted in my life in my house.

413
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:46,430
I felt like a five star chef for those
who don't know what heritage bread,

414
00:25:46,431 --> 00:25:49,340
pork is, that, that,
that is uh, that is um,

415
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:54,400
pure bred pigs that they can trace
their bloodline back to Europe.

416
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,950
All right. This is, this is the like,

417
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:00,860
I can't tell you [inaudible] just going
to compare it to fuck, I can't do that.

418
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:05,960
Cause then they going to be like,
can you please not compare us to the clan?

419
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:08,990
Um,
yeah.

420
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:13,550
If you want to get racist with your pork
or it'd be a little nice if you want to

421
00:26:13,551 --> 00:26:15,890
go Westminster with your pork.
That's I'm telling you dude,

422
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:20,330
you fucking make to sear it on both sides.
Finish it in the oven in a skillet.

423
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:24,710
You bring it back out. A little rosemary
butter bath. Oh, forget about it.

424
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:25,500
Unbelievable.

425
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:29,270
The incredible quality of butcher box
meat starts with the commitment to raising

426
00:26:29,271 --> 00:26:33,680
animals humanely and free of antibiotics
and hormones before they kill them.

427
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:36,890

nine to 11 pounds of meat,

meals. Unless you're a glutton is fat.

449
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:54,160
You know what the one that when Peter
always shows those things about animals,

450
00:27:54,161 --> 00:27:56,470
you don't want one that really
fucking got me the other day.

451
00:27:56,471 --> 00:27:58,900
I can't remember if I mentioned
this on the Monday morning podcast.

452
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:03,400
I was driving down to this
gig in Bridgeport and right
next to the place that I

453
00:28:03,401 --> 00:28:04,234
was playing,

454
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:09,660
they had this sign would that showed a
cow and then it's calf and the calf was

455
00:28:10,211 --> 00:28:12,880
like touching face with its with
its mother, you know what I mean?

456
00:28:12,881 --> 00:28:17,560
Like this beautiful, you know,
mother kid fucking type of vibe.

457
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:23,100
And it said this is this calves first
day and last day with his mother,

458
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:28,740
please stop drinking milk.
And I was like, Jesus Christ.

459
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,900
You know, now I'm, I'm
separating families,

460
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:34,793
you know,

461
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,870
I dunno. I Dunno what's going on with
the fucking world right now. Right.

462
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,331
But I,

463
00:28:39,331 --> 00:28:44,100
I'm gonna I'm starting
with the cut in the mirror.

464
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:46,590
MMM MMM.

465
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:49,410
Asking him to change his freckles.

466
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:56,190
Those were the original lyrics. I actually
wrote that and I sent it to Michael.

467
00:28:56,191 --> 00:28:59,730
He's like, oh, it seems a little
ginger specific. And I said,

468
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:01,980
don't use that word around me

469
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:07,610
or I'll do something offensive to your
race if I could figure out what the fuck.

470
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:12,260
Um,
yeah,

471
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:16,590
I am. I am working on
my temper. I am, I am.

472
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:20,160
I'm not going to get into arguments
about people with their fucking belief

473
00:29:20,161 --> 00:29:23,280
system. I would like to fucking, you know,

474
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:26,520
I'm not saying that we're going to become
vegetarian, but like I would like to,

475
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:30,840
where do they continue to promote more
companies that at least they're saying

476
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,380
they're doing this. I hope
they're not fucking lion. And uh,

477
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,410
I gotta be honest with you, man, I've
switched over to fucking almond milk.

478
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:41,650
But here's the thing about almonds.
They take up so much goddamn water grow

479
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:44,380
and then, you know, there's
just too many fucking people.

480
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:49,180
It always comes down to that.
How do we live on this planet?

481
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:53,420
We need to get the fucking
population Dachau, right?

482
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:56,070
That's what we need to do.
Okay.

483
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:58,540
We need to stop fighting
about the goop in the ground.

484
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:02,380
We just stop fucking screaming and
yelling at each other. We got it.

485
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:05,380
It's like we have an a tug of war
when we should just fucking, I dunno,

486
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,750
you can't do it.
How do you get on the same page?

487
00:30:07,751 --> 00:30:10,300
How do you get everybody to start
pulling in the same fucking direction?

488
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:13,061
Do you know,

489
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:16,630
like when they take a black light and
they go through like a fucking hotel room

490
00:30:16,631 --> 00:30:18,450
to see where all the fucking Jesus,

491
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:24,340
if they could come up with one of those
lights for socio paths and I don't know

492
00:30:24,341 --> 00:30:26,350
what you would do with those people.
I mean,

493
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:30,610
I think you've got to take them out and
you certainly can't stick them on an

494
00:30:30,611 --> 00:30:33,790
island and have all of those fucking
lunatics there at the same time.

495
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:37,660
There's another great Scifi movie,

496
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:43,690
somebody invents at Tj's
light for fucking sociopaths.

497
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:47,020
They weed them all out,
but there's, but they're,

498
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:49,930
they're big flaw in their
system is their fucking liberal.

499
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:54,730
So they can't flip the switch
and electrocute him and
they stick them all on the

500
00:30:54,731 --> 00:30:59,731
same island and then they just
create a master race of socio paths.

501
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:06,340
And then they had this war,
like psychotic fucking people.

502
00:31:06,341 --> 00:31:10,810
And then they get in their goddamn viking
ships and they start coming over to

503
00:31:10,811 --> 00:31:14,460
everybody else walking around with
their Beta energy in their Birkenstocks.

504
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,610
All right.

505
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:21,580
And of course there's one good
one over there. I Dunno why.

506
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:24,610
Somehow there's some sort of fucking
lefty gene. It's, it's Hollywood.

507
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:28,270
It's going to have to be the lefties
saved, saving the fucking day. Right? Um,

508
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:33,910
he gets over there and he warns him and
he has to teach all of these fucking

509
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:39,270
Bergen stocked fucking leftys how to
fight fire with fire and become warlike.

510
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:41,953
All right.

511
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:47,200
It's basically empire strikes
back meets police academy.

512
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,540
That's how I would pitch it.

513
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:51,733
All right.

514
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:54,850
With a sprinkle of the Dave Matthews band.

515
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:04,360
All right. That's your dump
Scifi movie of the week. Um,

516
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,670
all right. Now as a red
sox fan, I have one more.

517
00:32:09,671 --> 00:32:11,970
I got to tip my cap one more time out.

518
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:15,430
Up on a percent respect for the
Yankees in their organization.

519
00:32:15,431 --> 00:32:20,431
Do you realize that if the New York
Yankees do not win the world series next

520
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:22,360
year,

521
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:27,360
this will only be the second
decade since the 1920s that they,

522
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:32,200
that they didn't win a world series?
Do you want to stand? Let's, let's,

523
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:35,200
let's fucking look this up
here for a second. All right.

524
00:32:35,201 --> 00:32:37,690
If you want to get jealous
as a fucking sports fan,

525
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:43,710
New New York Yankees.

526
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:46,230
Don't you will see fucking
sang about New Jersey. Frank,

527
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:48,210
just as a fuck you to New York.

528
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,460
They never thought he was good
enough until he was good enough.

529
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:55,380
Then they took him in as
their own. Um, you know,

530
00:32:56,040 --> 00:33:00,460
I want to wake up and a city
that fucking rakes, right?

531
00:33:00,461 --> 00:33:05,461
He's singing about Newark and
fight dom bridge and tunnel

532
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:10,980
to noon. I will sleep. Sorry.
Had to rhyme. All right. New York

533
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:16,860
Yankees. Where the fuck, let me hit pause
so this doesn't take forever. All right.

534
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:21,800
I only had to put a pause for two
seconds. All right. The 1920s. All right.

535
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:27,580
1919 they get babe Ruth. Okay.
The 1920s they won three titles.

536
00:33:27,581 --> 00:33:31,510
19 231927192080,

537
00:33:31,511 --> 00:33:36,220
here come the 1930s they one night
they went one, two, three, four,

538
00:33:36,221 --> 00:33:37,054
five,

539
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:42,630
1930 to 1936 93719381939
including four in a row.

540
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:47,060
They want to half the fucking
world series in that decade.

541
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:51,590
1940s they won one,

542
00:33:51,591 --> 00:33:55,520
two three four.
They had an off decade.

543
00:33:55,550 --> 00:34:00,550
They only won four 1940 94319471949 and
then here come the 1950s where they one,

544
00:34:04,791 --> 00:34:08,210
one, two, three four five,

545
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:10,640
six including five in a row.

546
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:15,640
If you count 1949 cause they already
won 1949 then they want 95019511952 and

547
00:34:16,641 --> 00:34:21,641
1953 then they won 1956
and 1958 by the way,

548
00:34:23,241 --> 00:34:27,470
honorable mention to the Cleveland
Indians when they won in 1946 I believe,

549
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:30,620
or was it 48 I can't remember.
48 I think. All right.

550
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:36,760
Then the 1960s they want to 1961 1962
then the 70s they want to 1977 1978 now

551
00:34:43,381 --> 00:34:45,090
granted now this like fucking,
you know,

552
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:51,150
25 30 teams in the league and there's
still one in the 80s they don't win any

553
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:53,340
silly one twenties thirties forties

554
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:57,720
fifties sixties seventies
six fucking decades in a row.

555
00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:03,410
2000 they come right back and they
went 390690890 nine to 2000 they,

556
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:10,410
when they won in 2000 2009 they want to,
how do you count the decades by the way?

557
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:14,750
You count it from sometimes. Is
it 81 to 90? I don't know. I,

558
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:18,210
when the odometer flips, that's
how I count it. All right?

559
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:22,500
So they have yet to win one this decade.
So they've basically,

560
00:35:22,501 --> 00:35:27,501
one of the last nine decades
they won a championship.

561
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:31,230
Like a drought for them is
not winning in a decade.

562
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:34,560
It's fucking ridiculous.
It really is ridiculous.

563
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:37,650
And they have more titles than the
Celtics. More titles, the Lakers,

564
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:39,300
more titles than the fucking,

565
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:40,773
okay.

566
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:42,151
Montreal Canadians,

567
00:35:42,151 --> 00:35:46,920
more titles than the fucking Green Bay
packers with all of their Superbowls in

568
00:35:46,921 --> 00:35:48,960
all of their fucking super bowl titles and

569
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,960
the Pittsburgh Steelers Superbowls
thrown in. So there you go. And,

570
00:35:53,961 --> 00:35:56,670
and I think that they're going to win
one here in the next couple of years,

571
00:35:56,671 --> 00:35:59,100
the direction that they're going. So, uh,

572
00:35:59,101 --> 00:36:01,560
I'm very happy that we were able
to beat them. And like I said,

573
00:36:01,561 --> 00:36:05,310
I don't fucking rub it in. I got nothing
but respect for him. That's the podcast.

574
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:09,300
Um, be sure to listen now
to do my, my fucking picks,

575
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:14,030
my NFL picks for the week,
which uh, you know, I barely,

576
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:16,070
you know, I don't have
time to pay a to, I should,

577
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:18,890
I really should start playing fantasy
football so I know who some of the fucking

578
00:36:18,891 --> 00:36:20,960
people are in the league.
Um,

579
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:24,920
so I'm on the on green and Ryan Kramer
show the sports gambling podcast.

580
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:28,930
Um, and that's it. Other than that,

581
00:36:28,931 --> 00:36:33,070
after that we'll have a little bit of
music and then a throwback from a podcast

582
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:37,060
from a Thursday going by earlier this
year or God knows when. All right,

583
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:40,020
that's it. Go Red Sox. Uh,

584
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,690
go pats and all of this stupid mouth
breathers and shit that I watch.

585
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:04,890
[inaudible] hey we,
we got him,

586
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:14,070
we stopped.
We can be

587
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,370
[inaudible] [inaudible]

Dot. Agee joining us on the line.

593
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:07,603
Bill Burr.
Bill,

594
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:11,910
your red socks just defeated the
Yankees in the alds three to one. How,

595
00:38:11,911 --> 00:38:13,770
how excited are you for them to move on?

596
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:19,550
I can't believe how much I still care.
I was trying to lie to him cause I didn't,

597
00:38:19,551 --> 00:38:21,660
I don't feel, you know, the
rent price was touching.

598
00:38:21,661 --> 00:38:24,750
I was like you need a one to or not
the great teams like the Yankees out.

599
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:27,390
And I was just,
you know,

600
00:38:27,391 --> 00:38:31,380
all I wanted to see him was one and once
the movie was over and roll credits,

601
00:38:31,381 --> 00:38:33,660
I mean what are they going to do?
Chat 2013 at me.

602
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:36,070
I said all of that stuff
and I couldn't believe

603
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:38,820
how much,
you know what it is.

604
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:41,220
It's not the Yankees
and it's not the worst

605
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:44,980
and association. It's their fans. It's

606
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:47,160
really,
and it's not even all of this fans.

607
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:52,260
It's those mouth breathing morons
that those mole fans, you know,

608
00:38:52,261 --> 00:38:54,630
the guys who like ducked
down when they lose.

609
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:57,480
And then pop their head up when they,
when I literally have a friend,

610
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:59,880
I'm not going to sign up front. I
got a coworker, another comedian.

611
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:05,210
I didn't hear from that guy since game
three to 2014 I'm 2004 I didn't hear from

612
00:39:06,301 --> 00:39:10,320
him again until the red sox blew that
lead with Bobby Valentine and September in

613
00:39:10,321 --> 00:39:15,321
2012 like nine years later he popped
his head up to start talking trash.

614
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:18,120
The next year we won the world series.
I haven't heard from him again.

615
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:23,220
Cabling guarantee you if the Yankees won
this thing that I would have heard from.

616
00:39:23,221 --> 00:39:26,340
That's only time I hear from this guy
is when the Yankees beat the red sox.

617
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,900
Well, yeah. Why not? Why
not? I mean, I do agree.

618
00:39:29,901 --> 00:39:33,200
There was a great shot during the game
last night where they had this trio of

619
00:39:33,201 --> 00:39:36,670
like just straight from the
Bronx like slightly before.

620
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:38,340
Yeah. When he struck that guy out, will

621
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:42,160
they, they honestly, they
make me, I mean as a Yang,

622
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:45,790
I grew up in New Jersey as a Yankee Fan.
It did make me kind of question like,

623
00:39:45,791 --> 00:39:48,790
man, I'm associating with these
neanderthals. Like there is,

624
00:39:48,791 --> 00:39:53,560
there is a certain element
of the, the annoyance of the,
the, the casual bandwagon.

625
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:54,753
Yankee.

626
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,350
One thing we have in common though,

627
00:39:56,351 --> 00:40:00,600
red sox and Yankees is the
level of mouth breathing.

628
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,440
I mean when they,
when they cut to the crowd,

629
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,640
but they're jealous just hanging open.

630
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:11,620
It's like wholesome looking or whatever.
The west coast has their own vibe.

631
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:15,550
Florida in the south, you're
lucky if they even show up. Right.

632
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:20,370
But like you get to the east coast,
Philly, New York, Boston, we are,

633
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,820
we're animals and you can't
even deny it or just animal

634
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:30,070
I, and as someone who's lived now
in California for about 15 years,

635
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:33,010
you really start to notice it.
The longer you're away from it,

636
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:37,110
it stops being normal. And you go back
home and you're like, oh my God, this is,

637
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:40,870
having said that you can get stabbed
to death at a game on the west coast.

638
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:45,370
Yeah. That's all. They skipped the
whole dump in the beer over your head.

639
00:40:45,371 --> 00:40:48,370
They just don't write
up, you know, a homicide.

640
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:51,850
Yeah, that's, that's the
thing. As an eagles fan, we
always get so much shit. Oh,

641
00:40:51,851 --> 00:40:53,980
you guys are the worst fans.
You guys are mean.

642
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:56,800
You guys booed Santa Claus
in through Sovos. Meanwhile,

643
00:40:56,801 --> 00:41:01,801
Dodgers fans are putting guys in comas
and and stabbing people died over,

644
00:41:03,071 --> 00:41:08,020
over, over a Dodgers game, a game that
you know, barely the city cares about.

645
00:41:08,021 --> 00:41:11,350
What's going to choice for Philadelphia
is the d cell battery and that's,

646
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:16,270
that's honorable. Not a,
not a knife. What's wrong?
Medium. That's medium security.

647
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:19,060
If you go to jail. Yeah, yeah.

648
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:22,430
No.
They had the jail at Eagle Eagle Stadium.

649
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:25,700
If they had one out here in a would
have to be, you have to be a prison.

650
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:28,820
I was the crime that was committed.
It wouldn't be like some,

651
00:41:28,821 --> 00:41:30,560
some silly drunken behavior.

652
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:35,060
Yeah. You're not getting a couple of days.
You're going away for a good long time.

653
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:39,380
Yeah, exactly. And the crazy Dodgers
stadium, you can't even tailgate.

654
00:41:39,381 --> 00:41:44,000
They won't let you drink beer. Sir. If you
could move on to the stadium. Thank you.

655
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:44,361
Yeah.

656
00:41:44,361 --> 00:41:47,360
The one time I had a couple of beers in
the parking lot was playing some wiffle

657
00:41:47,361 --> 00:41:47,631
ball.

658
00:41:47,631 --> 00:41:51,560
Assuming that's kind of what you do
before a baseball game and a guy in a golf

659
00:41:51,561 --> 00:41:55,770
cart came up, took my id and said
I was on the list. So I dunno.

660
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:59,440
What list would list them on at dodger
stadium? Why did you give him your id?

661
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:03,740
You know what? I should have a, I should
have just said, who the fuck are you?

662
00:42:03,741 --> 00:42:06,790
Why would I give, listen, I
was, I was confronted. I was

663
00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:12,990
hopping cars have doors. Yeah. Yo,

664
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:13,710
I don't know how

665
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:14,940
combustion engines,

666
00:42:15,210 --> 00:42:18,940
why don't you go back to a criminal
justice school and get your degree there?

667
00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:22,250
Yeah. I don't know how
would even determine. Yeah,

668
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,930
it's unclear how you would detain me.

669
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:27,350
You put me back where the golf clubs
are supposed to be and like tie me in.

670
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:32,410
Very unclear. Oh yeah. I Dunno. I Dunno.

671
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:35,720
Show, so that's exciting. Let's talk.

672
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:37,910
Let's talk about the
national football league.

673
00:42:37,911 --> 00:42:41,090
Of course that bill's going to be
making some pics. He's on the line,

674
00:42:41,091 --> 00:42:43,890
courtesy of my bookie dad, agg,
the official online sports.

675
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:45,890
Look at the sports game like podcasts,

676
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:50,090
hundred percent deposit bonus
using the Promo Code bill bets.

677
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:55,390
First game that we got here to select
is a the eagles minus three edit into

678
00:42:55,931 --> 00:43:00,680
giant stadium. Nscs doesn't look
great. Eagle can give mouth breathers.

679
00:43:00,681 --> 00:43:04,130
Yeah, there's going to be a lot of mouth
breathing going on. All the eagles,

680
00:43:04,131 --> 00:43:08,930
two and three giants, one in for the
NFC east, not looking great bill. Uh,

681
00:43:08,931 --> 00:43:13,830
which way you lean in this game?
I were take the giants were, oh,

682
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:18,140
okay. I get in three. Yep. They're a,
they're the home guys. Two or three

683
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,220
and I'm going to, I just, you know,

684
00:43:20,221 --> 00:43:25,130
those division rivalry games that they
lost the giant foster heartbreaker last

685
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:27,870
year. I mean they, they should, they
should be two orders. What does it really,

686
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:31,470
one in four. So they should be
a, it was at two and three. Yeah.

687
00:43:31,471 --> 00:43:34,910
They're not as bad as their
record. And uh, I don't know.

688
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:38,580
I don't know much about the eagles by
imagine. After they won a Superbowl,

689
00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:41,760
a bunch of guys in their team went out
and got that free agency money and some

690
00:43:41,761 --> 00:43:42,481
coaches left.

691
00:43:42,481 --> 00:43:45,870
So there's always a bit of a hangover
trying to figure out who you all after

692
00:43:45,871 --> 00:43:49,650
that. Speaking as a patriots
fan considerably want so
many this century, you know,

693
00:43:49,651 --> 00:43:51,450
I can actually speak
with this with authority.

694
00:43:52,290 --> 00:43:55,600
Um, yeah. I mean it's not a
good sign when I, you know,

695
00:43:55,601 --> 00:44:00,430
there's multiple book tours going for
like I read a backup quarterback's book in

696
00:44:00,431 --> 00:44:02,320
the off season,
so that's maybe the,

697
00:44:02,350 --> 00:44:04,420
maybe the team did get a little
ahead of themselves there.

698
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:06,080
Yeah, there's still celebrate. Yeah,

699
00:44:06,270 --> 00:44:09,980
they'd probably hanging out with the
Vatican if can you believe we want it to

700
00:44:11,170 --> 00:44:15,590
um, to doing beer bottles.
Take A, I would shake, uh,

701
00:44:16,050 --> 00:44:19,000
Eli in the points at, Huh? Alright.
Kramer. I'm guessing you're rowing,

702
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:21,300
you're going giants. Why are
you going? Gee Man. Well,

703
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:24,550
I mean it's the same thing we've told
the defense doesn't play as well on the

704
00:44:24,551 --> 00:44:25,960
road.
And Carson Wentz,

705
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:31,000
just like the doctor said he's got
all the way back and the offense is,

706
00:44:31,470 --> 00:44:34,320
there's no magic.
Like the head coach is not,

707
00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:38,730
he's not having those magical fourth
down Philly Philly calls and yeah,

708
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,400
like bill said,
giants not as bad.

709
00:44:41,510 --> 00:44:44,100
They've got hosed by the rafts
and an awesome kick last week.

710
00:44:44,101 --> 00:44:47,370
So of course I'm on the
giants. Home team is Fay. Hey,

711
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:51,120
home team is called covered every home
Thursday night game. So that, that's true.

712
00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:55,410
But here's what I'll say.
Eagles 16 and four in the last 20,

713
00:44:55,411 --> 00:44:59,040
they have eli Manning's number
also. You Brian, your giants.

714
00:44:59,070 --> 00:45:02,210
What are they horrible at covering
the tight end. A lot of sense. Yeah.

715
00:45:02,330 --> 00:45:05,530
Well exactly. But Zach
hurts. He's uh, you know,

716
00:45:05,610 --> 00:45:10,470
he's The star right now on offense
your nation, Bro. You're reaching,

717
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:13,680
no, I, I, I think they go in,
this is a must win for the eagles.

718
00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:16,590
I just don't think this
giants offensive line,

719
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:19,680
we'll be able to keep the Eagles'
defensive line, which has been struggling.

720
00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:22,330
No such thing as a must win for the ego.
So just won the,

721
00:45:22,850 --> 00:45:25,060
all right, go ahead. I
know that's the problem.

722
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:28,000
They got a free pass for
the rest of my life, but I,

723
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:31,630
I wear or the dog mass that they're gone.
They're not the dog anymore.

724
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:33,760
They're the targeted.
So they are the road favor

725
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:38,570
defending champs and they got their feet
up. Take the points. Nah, I'm saying,

726
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:39,550
I'm saying eagles.

727
00:45:39,850 --> 00:45:43,220
Mine is three road victory. No
sweat here. All right, here's the,

728
00:45:43,221 --> 00:45:46,310
here's an interesting one.
Played Out in Wembley Stadium,

729
00:45:46,790 --> 00:45:48,740
the Seahawks minus three,

730
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:52,640
I guess technically a home game
for the Raiders. They're fine.

731
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:56,140
They're playing some real
football out in London. Bill, uh,

732
00:45:56,150 --> 00:45:57,380
which way you lean in on this game?

733
00:45:59,870 --> 00:46:01,370
Well,
I love John Grown,

734
00:46:01,371 --> 00:46:05,150
but I still don't think he's gotten
his team where it needs to be.

735
00:46:05,690 --> 00:46:10,400
And uh, Pete Carroll is a
beast and I just, I, you know,

736
00:46:10,401 --> 00:46:13,640
I don't even think we were playing
over in Europe last time and coached.

737
00:46:13,850 --> 00:46:18,260
He's got the oldest team in the NFL. They
going to be all cranky from the flight.

738
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:23,090
I don't know. I, I've taken, um, what,
what's the, see, what am I see asks, given

739
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:24,740
Seahawks are only laying three.

740
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:26,080
Yeah.

741
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:27,740
Only that I don't like you just said only.
Yeah.

742
00:46:28,230 --> 00:46:31,250
Awesome. That's a wrap already. I'm
already tipping my hand, I guess.

743
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:33,560
I think, uh, yeah,

744
00:46:33,561 --> 00:46:36,110
I think they're going to have problems
contained in their quarterback.

745
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:39,140
They'd Raiders left from obtaining
their, uh, their quarterback is, I,

746
00:46:39,141 --> 00:46:40,520
I'm going to go to Seattle.

747
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:44,280
Yeah. I mean, I just want, I want
to see the, I just want to see this,

748
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:48,410
the documentary on Gruden in London.
That's all John Gruden said. Quote,

749
00:46:48,490 --> 00:46:53,410
he's not a good flier and
gets anxious online. Long
plane rides. Interesting fact.

750
00:46:53,411 --> 00:46:56,830
The Raiders, uh, they're not
flying out to London till Friday,

751
00:46:56,831 --> 00:47:01,510
which I always feel is a bad sign.
Carol, he got on the plane, uh,

752
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:04,810
you know, a couple of days early. So the
Seahawks are already out in London. I,

753
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:05,963
I think that's

754
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:11,700
already walked around. Buckingham Palace
gone. Whew. Anytime anything could happen.

755
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:13,053
Yes.
The ric flair.

756
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:16,260
He is kind of scary when a,

757
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,430
when a old guy choose that much
gum and has that much energy, it's,

758
00:47:19,431 --> 00:47:20,550
it's a little unsettling.

759
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:24,550
Okay. What's on real? He's the oldest
coach in the NFL. He looks great.

760
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:27,850
He looks great. Dude. He's
like the Dick Clark or coaches.

761
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:30,390
Yeah. He's almost, he's kind
of reminds me of Jack Lane.

762
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:35,050
Just like an old guy. Gray
hair. Super jacked. Tons of
energy. He must be juicing.

763
00:47:35,110 --> 00:47:36,990
Yeah. Or something. Juice
in the positive way.

764
00:47:38,370 --> 00:47:43,110
Yeah. Classic Classic Seattle Guy. I
listen, I know you don't want to say,

765
00:47:43,410 --> 00:47:47,580
uh, the Seahawks, that was kind of their
super bowl ad home against the rams.

766
00:47:47,581 --> 00:47:51,020
They lost that game. That
was a tough loss. Maybe they,

767
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:52,750
maybe they don't get up for this game,
but I,

768
00:47:52,751 --> 00:47:55,350
I just don't think this
or Raiders team is right.

769
00:47:56,190 --> 00:47:58,800
Gruden I think is having trouble
adjusting to the modern game.

770
00:47:58,801 --> 00:48:03,510
He hasn't been able to fix car. I just
don't see the Raiders showing up short.

771
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:04,860
When's the last time you flew?

772
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:09,030
Like a nine hour flight and then
you play a game 18 hours later.

773
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:10,170
But that doesn't seem right.

774
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:13,600
I usually have to sleep for a
solid eight to 10 hours out. Yeah.

775
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:17,370
Still buy a thing is that they're,
they're avoiding London's food.

776
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:21,270
That's a good thing that that could
play to their advantage. Yeah.

777
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:24,600
Any of them are listening. Go there and
get the Indian food accounts standing.

778
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:29,280
Avoid the accident. Yeah. Yeah.
Avoid the food. They actually make

779
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:33,810
John Gruden with a giant
plate of bangers and mash

780
00:48:34,670 --> 00:48:39,060
tires in Macedonia. English, breakfast or
anything. Just give a couple of Fridays

781
00:48:40,730 --> 00:48:45,390
blood pudding. Oh yeah. Super Gross.
Sounds. Sounds delicious. Yeah, I just, I,

782
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:49,030
I think there's plenty of science and
I'm sure grins not up on the science. I,

783
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:51,980
there's plenty of science on
why you want to get there early.

784
00:48:52,310 --> 00:48:55,820
So just knowing that I love the Seahawks.
Yeah.

785
00:48:56,210 --> 00:48:58,340
Good spot for the Seahawks.
Good matchup.

786
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:01,730
Final game of the three
we're picking with bill here,

787
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:05,090
the Kansas City chiefs head into New
England for Sunday night football.

788
00:49:05,091 --> 00:49:08,750
Right now the pats
coming off the long rest,

789
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:13,220
three and a half point home favorites
against the Kansas City chiefs

790
00:49:13,890 --> 00:49:16,080
if favorites.
You know what?

791
00:49:16,081 --> 00:49:21,081
This is such a weird game because the
Jag was manhandled the patrons and then

792
00:49:24,091 --> 00:49:29,091
Kansas City planted the jags like a month
later and Blake Bortles look like he

793
00:49:30,091 --> 00:49:31,530
shouldn't even be in the NFL.

794
00:49:31,590 --> 00:49:35,640
So it's one of those things was like
when the Patriots played the Jaguars was

795
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:40,820
where the Patriots not as bad as they
seem in the Jaguar's worn is good or this

796
00:49:40,830 --> 00:49:42,150
Kansas City.
That's good.

797
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:44,153
MMM.

798
00:49:44,290 --> 00:49:48,310
Oh three points at home. This is the
thing why I'm going to take the Patriots,

799
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:53,590
which this makes me nervous.
Yeah. I wouldn't have a
tease this game either. Um,

800
00:49:53,770 --> 00:49:58,510
the only thing that you don't like,
the thing that's tipping it is that uh,

801
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:01,270
Kansas City has the worst defense.

802
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:02,660
Yeah.

803
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:07,220
And I I'm not buying last week even though
they look solid. Um, just not buy out.

804
00:50:07,221 --> 00:50:09,190
I don't know cause I don't think are,

805
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:13,490
I don't think our defense is good and
I was kind of making fun of how much,

806
00:50:13,550 --> 00:50:16,570
you know, the attach Oklahoma's,
I mean the way the hype and the,

807
00:50:16,650 --> 00:50:20,850
he is said Brady has
rings show tie my homes.

808
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:26,990
I hope you want allows what you just
thought that I stopped at five to that a

809
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:31,400
thousand. Everybody relax. I think
it's cause Brady's going to leave soon.

810
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:34,040
Drew Brees, he's going to leave
soon and they, they, they, they're,

811
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:37,940
they need somebody to, uh, to step it up.

812
00:50:37,941 --> 00:50:41,450
And I think that guy
will step it up. Um, uh,

813
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:45,170
and they also shall act as a year ago.
Does.

814
00:50:45,230 --> 00:50:48,680
But are there enough guys left
on the team that care? Um,

815
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:53,110
Brady Brady cares and he's got
Adelman back and he stepped up.

816
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:57,310
The guy that likes to have a
few from Cleveland. Josh Gordon.

817
00:50:58,150 --> 00:51:01,090
Yeah. Good Lord. What are you, you know
what? I'm going to go with the Patriots.

818
00:51:01,091 --> 00:51:04,840
I can't, I can't take them. I just let
people listen. Don't take that as advice.

819
00:51:04,841 --> 00:51:05,674
That's my art time.

820
00:51:05,790 --> 00:51:09,700
This is a really great time to sell
the chief stock. And Sean, you,

821
00:51:09,701 --> 00:51:11,980
we like to look at what
the public's up to. Yes.

822
00:51:12,030 --> 00:51:16,880
68% of the tickets on the chiefs and yet
this line has gone from three to three

823
00:51:16,881 --> 00:51:20,600
and a half. What does that tell you?
Sharp. Smart money is on the Patriots.

824
00:51:21,110 --> 00:51:24,230
The Hook is there to scare you.
Lay the hook. Come on. This is,

825
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:26,900
this is the classic like, Hey, Andy, read,

826
00:51:26,901 --> 00:51:29,210
beat the shit out of bill
Belichick week one last year.

827
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:32,290
You think Bella check doesn't
remember that. Yeah, I just don't see

828
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:36,890
Canton street is a monster in September.
The last guy you want to run into,

829
00:51:36,891 --> 00:51:40,400
what steps you actually look in
January. He's, he's a little tired.

830
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:45,320
He's kind of a monster year
round. Big Fella. But uh,

831
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:47,661
Oh man,

832
00:51:47,661 --> 00:51:51,980
I always crack up the way that the Koolaid
Gif of him running through the wall

833
00:51:51,981 --> 00:51:56,090
or the punt pass and kick that they
always show of him going up against other

834
00:51:56,091 --> 00:51:57,430
eight nine year olds when he was eight,

835
00:51:57,460 --> 00:52:00,880
nine and he was still like twice
their size. Listen, Andy Reid, great.

836
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,600
He competed in one of those.

837
00:52:03,730 --> 00:52:07,450
Oh yeah, I'll have to send you the
video. It's, it's an all time classic.

838
00:52:07,530 --> 00:52:10,660
He's literally two and a half times
the size of all the other kids.

839
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:14,400
God bless him.
He's a kid,

840
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:20,140
he's a good coach. But the pets,
they have that extra rest. Uh,

841
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:23,410
and I think they kind of figured
out their offense and the chiefs,

842
00:52:23,411 --> 00:52:25,000
the defensive backfield is not right.

843
00:52:25,001 --> 00:52:29,050
Like the jags offense on the
road is way different than uh,

844
00:52:29,110 --> 00:52:32,860
than the pets at home. So,
uh, I think the patriots,

845
00:52:32,861 --> 00:52:34,750
they covered the three and a half.
Yeah.

846
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:37,420
I think. How would you play a different
defense when you're on the road?

847
00:52:37,421 --> 00:52:39,960
They do you, do you honestly
think that crowd makes that they,

848
00:52:39,970 --> 00:52:41,010
I don't understand this.

849
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:45,680
Those guys have like literally 300 pound
people running at a metaphor for like,

850
00:52:46,070 --> 00:52:48,800
and they're worried about some
guy dressed up like Boba Fett.

851
00:52:49,870 --> 00:52:54,210
Oh my God. That face paint threw me off.
I think really what it is is a, they,

852
00:52:54,211 --> 00:52:58,480
they talk so much about how the snap
count makes a huge difference where the

853
00:52:58,481 --> 00:53:00,730
office that they're going up
against when they're at home,

854
00:53:00,790 --> 00:53:02,930
they have to go on silent
count a lot and it's,

855
00:53:02,950 --> 00:53:06,970
it's much easier to get a better jump on
the ball when you're on the road. The,

856
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:09,880
the crowd noise is against
you. And a, I think it makes,

857
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:12,910
and not to mention it's though those
late nights cause you're on the road,

858
00:53:12,911 --> 00:53:16,900
which means you're probably dabbling in
some side action. Lawrence Taylor style,

859
00:53:16,901 --> 00:53:18,490
the prostitutes come into the hotel.

860
00:53:19,370 --> 00:53:21,930
I don't know if you can do that
now with cell phone cameras.

861
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:26,610
That's true. That's true. That's a real,
it's a simpler back when lt could just,

862
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:29,010
every team has a ray Donovan.
I'm sure of that.

863
00:53:30,430 --> 00:53:34,230
It does seem like there's, there's
probably some still shenanigans going on.

864
00:53:34,890 --> 00:53:38,130
Kramer close things out here. Are
you on the paths as well? Yeah, no,

865
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:41,100
I'm definitely, I think,
you know, I like to play,

866
00:53:41,101 --> 00:53:44,280
I play against the market and I think
everyone sees the chiefs and like bill was

867
00:53:44,281 --> 00:53:47,100
saying like Pat Ma homes can do no wrong.
Yeah,

868
00:53:47,101 --> 00:53:51,050
he's the greatest thing
since exactly the luck.

869
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:54,750
The reaction to the lefthanded
throw was like, Oh man,

870
00:53:54,850 --> 00:53:57,850
he has three of those in his career.
Like that's not a sign of a great app.

871
00:53:59,510 --> 00:54:04,500
He came in as a ledger, like five
stars. It's already a legend.

872
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:08,590
So, and now their comparison
comparing him to Steph curry and it's,

873
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:10,870
it's a little bit like, no one's
willing to say it, but like,

874
00:54:10,871 --> 00:54:13,390
are we just saying this
because he's light skinned all,

875
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:16,270
I mean it's a light skinned black guy
with curly hair and all of a sudden

876
00:54:16,271 --> 00:54:19,330
they're the same play and nothing.
Nothing like Steph curry at all.

877
00:54:19,331 --> 00:54:21,970
Like how is slinging 80
mile an hour fastball?

878
00:54:22,430 --> 00:54:26,250
Football's anything like shooting a three
pointer. Nothing. I, anyway, good. Sorry.

879
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:29,820
Good time to sell on the pats or
sorry, sell. In this case, the chiefs,

880
00:54:29,821 --> 00:54:31,350
I'm buying the patch.
I Pat,

881
00:54:31,450 --> 00:54:34,410
you could've gotten the pats to win
that division a week or two ago for like

882
00:54:34,411 --> 00:54:37,890
minus 300. It's now
minus 900 Sean. Ah Man.

883
00:54:38,350 --> 00:54:40,760
See you said easy money every year.
Oh,

884
00:54:41,010 --> 00:54:43,290
he's just passing up on the
pats to win the division. Just,

885
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:46,590
it's better than any sort of stack
you can invest in. All right, Bill,

886
00:54:46,591 --> 00:54:51,150
before we let you go, throw at a,
uh, throw it a lock for a week,

887
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:52,800
six here in the NFL.

888
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:57,760
Ah, God, I didn't have a chance to look
at it. So I gotta go outside the lock.

889
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:03,080
I Dunno. Any, any other sort of
a lead pipe predictions that you

890
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:08,260
for this weekend patriots beat Kansas
Shitty will then be odds on favorite to

891
00:55:08,261 --> 00:55:12,070
win the Superbowl we lose to Kansas City.

892
00:55:12,071 --> 00:55:16,570
They'll start asking is this
Brady's last year? That's my lock.

893
00:55:17,390 --> 00:55:19,580
Lock it up. I like it. Has
he fallen off the clay?

894
00:55:19,581 --> 00:55:22,700
Wouldn't be the first time the chiefs
we achieved defeat of the Patriots.

895
00:55:22,701 --> 00:55:26,380
Turned into is this the end for Brady? Is
this the end? It's got to end sometime.

896
00:55:26,450 --> 00:55:30,140
Could this be the year and he's, he's got
that trainer. He'll be good for awhile.

897
00:55:30,170 --> 00:55:31,240
Yeah,
him and Greg got it

898
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:34,540
figured out. Spongy muscle.
I've heard about that.

899
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:36,710
It's not all hard and
all tight and everything.

900
00:55:37,090 --> 00:55:39,080
It's like when you know when
you're going to do the dishes,

901
00:55:39,081 --> 00:55:42,140
you know that little sponge.
It's like malleable.

902
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:44,650
It's Tom Brady's name.
Go Watch this dude.

903
00:55:44,651 --> 00:55:48,850
Run the 40 at the combine and tell me
he's not a better athlete at 41 like what?

904
00:55:49,060 --> 00:55:53,110
What somethings is going on. Come
on, something's going on. He's,

905
00:55:53,111 --> 00:55:56,900
he's getting younger as time goes
on. But, uh, yeah, clearly the

906
00:55:57,220 --> 00:56:00,470
Pat's aren't done. Colby thing. He
probably got his blood spun. Yeah.

907
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:03,690
Got some stem cells in there, a
couple of embryos. He, you know,

908
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:07,040
he uses that as a pillow or something.
I don't know what he's doing.

909
00:56:07,041 --> 00:56:07,874
He looks amazing.

910
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:13,030
Sure does. All right, we'll uh, bill,

Hey,

920
00:56:52,510 --> 00:56:53,343
we can be

921
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:05,230
[inaudible]
is that time?

922
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:15,150
What's going on? It's bill burr and it's
the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

923
00:57:15,450 --> 00:57:20,370
October 11th, 2010. How the hell
are you? Are you doing good?

924
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:23,370
Well that's good.
Um,

925
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:26,610
I had all this shit that I wanted to talk
about and then I was looking at these

926
00:57:26,611 --> 00:57:31,611
fucking emails and right off the
Bat I got one from Lo and behold,

927
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:36,960
douche bag or the fucking week.
Guy's name's Brad course.

928
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:41,550
It's fucking names. Brad,
you know what else? What?

929
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:45,760
What a what a mother and
father name a Douche bag baby.

930
00:57:45,761 --> 00:57:49,020
Other than Brad. This is from Brad. Bill.

931
00:57:49,021 --> 00:57:52,200
I was hoping that I could
find your podcast on iTunes.

932
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:56,550
Yet another week passes by where your
fans can not listen to your show.

933
00:57:56,970 --> 00:57:59,100
No problem with that. Right
to there. Then he goes,

934
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:02,520
you might want to make that
a priority sometime too.

935
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:08,040
I can just fucking see his bare
feet and his fucking penny loafers.

936
00:58:08,130 --> 00:58:12,170
What are you leaning on my
cubicle? You fucking cunt. Really?

937
00:58:12,171 --> 00:58:14,240
Do I really want to make that a priority?
You dumb.

938
00:58:14,241 --> 00:58:16,760
Fuck you don't think I'm not
trying to contact iTunes.

939
00:58:17,530 --> 00:58:20,320
They don't have a fucking
person who answers their phones.

940
00:58:20,470 --> 00:58:24,370
They ignore my God damn emails. What am
I supposed to do? Go down to main street,

941
00:58:24,730 --> 00:58:28,960
right down on main street to the fucking
mom and pop fucking Mr Mrs Itunes store.

942
00:58:28,961 --> 00:58:31,150
It doesn't exist.
You douche.

943
00:58:32,090 --> 00:58:34,820
You might want to make that
a priority fucking soon.

944
00:58:34,940 --> 00:58:37,970
I want to slap you
right in your privilege.

945
00:58:38,150 --> 00:58:42,110
Fucking Connecticut white face and I
don't give a fuck if you're not white and

946
00:58:42,111 --> 00:58:46,060
even not from Connecticut cause you
should be what? That fucking tone. What?

947
00:58:46,061 --> 00:58:49,220
I can't contact
the week Brad,

948
00:58:50,170 --> 00:58:53,650
go fuck yourself. All right. I'm trying
to get this thing back up on iTunes.

949
00:58:54,070 --> 00:58:56,470
They're not responding to me.
What am I supposed to do?

950
00:58:56,990 --> 00:58:58,340
They don't have a location.

951
00:58:58,970 --> 00:59:02,090
This is the exact shit I've been
fucking trying to tell you guys about.

952
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:06,320
It starts with those Goddamn automated
machines down at the fucking grocery

953
00:59:06,321 --> 00:59:08,960
store.
You're siding with the fucking robots.

954
00:59:12,620 --> 00:59:17,340
Some of that made sense. You know what
did seriously, this is the future.

955
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:18,870
This is what a store is going to be.

956
00:59:20,230 --> 00:59:22,370
You're not going to be able to
get in contact with anybody.

957
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:26,060
You're going to have a problem and you
can basically go fuck yourself and then

958
00:59:26,061 --> 00:59:30,140
some other fucking nerd whose only job
is going to be fucking greasy elbow with

959
00:59:30,141 --> 00:59:33,050
a fucking robot that took his
job is going to send me an email.

960
00:59:33,051 --> 00:59:34,940
Tell me that I need to
make something a priority.

961
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:37,460
Why don't you go fuck yourself
buddy there that why don't you?

962
00:59:37,461 --> 00:59:39,980
Why don't you make that a priority
sometimes soon. All right.

963
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:44,970
What? Fuck it. I swear to God you are.

964
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:48,710
You might want to make that a
priority sometimes soon. Oh,

965
00:59:48,711 --> 00:59:53,000
the fucking stuffed shirt.
Fucking hang you by your goddamn tie,

966
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:56,870
Brad. You fucking cunt. Go Fuck Yourself.

967
00:59:56,990 --> 01:00:00,740
I'm glad you told all your friends to
listen to it and now they can't. Huh?

968
01:00:00,770 --> 01:00:03,020
What's that fucking with
you and your God Damn Ego.

969
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:07,130
Do you have a position at work?
Little fucking corner office. Brad

970
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:12,560
fucking moron telling me I need

971
01:00:14,170 --> 01:00:14,810
breathing.

972
01:00:14,810 --> 01:00:17,690
You might want to make that a priority
once you tell me something fucking else

973
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:21,920
obvious. All right, there you go.
There's your head of steam for the week.

974
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:28,010
Douche bag of the week. Good
old bread. I had no idea really.

975
01:00:28,011 --> 01:00:30,920
If it wasn't on iTunes and people
couldn't download in anymore,

976
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:34,250
like that would present some sort of
a problem and dropped my listenership.

977
01:00:34,350 --> 01:00:38,210
You think? I don't realize
that Brad, you fucking Dick

978
01:00:42,170 --> 01:00:43,100
on Columbus Day.

979
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:46,430
Can you believe I'm in this kind of a
fucking move on Columbus Day? You know,

980
01:00:46,580 --> 01:00:51,580
this is a great day and sort of white
history when that Spaniard came over here,

981
01:00:52,311 --> 01:00:56,450
who kind of look white because of his
brown hair. Did he have brown hair?

982
01:00:56,600 --> 01:01:00,010
Wasn't he Spanish or did he just
sail for the Spanish? I can't even,

983
01:01:00,011 --> 01:01:04,430
I can't even fucking keep the
damn story straight. All right.

984
01:01:04,730 --> 01:01:08,960
In my fucking history book,
he had yellow hair, you know,

985
01:01:09,020 --> 01:01:12,500
and shiny teeth in a fucking,
you know,

986
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:18,920
he was in shape. Then all of a
sudden they make a movie of vitamins.

987
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:21,680
Jerrad Deborah Dude.
And he play him that French fuck.

988
01:01:21,710 --> 01:01:24,680
He played him and he didn't
even land in Florida.

989
01:01:25,790 --> 01:01:27,860
He lands a islands down in the,
uh,

990
01:01:28,070 --> 01:01:30,080
the Caribbean starts
cutting people's hands off.

991
01:01:30,270 --> 01:01:34,990
Cause then I'd find him blood diamonds.
So, which was it? You don't want to.

992
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,540
I love, I love like when they have like
a, like a story. Everybody's going by,

993
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:43,460
right about some shit that
happened fucking 500 years ago,

994
01:01:43,470 --> 01:01:46,400
whatever thousand years ago.
Then out of nowhere,

995
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:51,760
there'll be a show on TV and they'll
say new evidence suggests new evidence.

996
01:01:53,031 --> 01:01:56,030
Five something from 500 years
and yet new evidence. Really?

997
01:01:57,410 --> 01:01:58,300
Where the fuck did you find it?

998
01:01:58,420 --> 01:02:01,880
That that Christopher Columbus write
something down on a cocktail napkin in a

999
01:02:01,881 --> 01:02:04,100
bar and somebody finally
cleaned out the fucking,

1000
01:02:04,310 --> 01:02:07,470
those rubber mats that they
stand on and they found it. Oh,

1001
01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:13,060
this evidently he went down to the
Caribbean and chop people's hands off for

1002
01:02:13,551 --> 01:02:18,320
some reason. Wrote it all over
this cocktail napkin. You know,

1003
01:02:18,410 --> 01:02:21,450
I see some stuff. You know, where
we thought the world was flat.

1004
01:02:23,850 --> 01:02:27,540
New evidence suggests that maybe he
didn't sail off the edge of the world.

1005
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:32,550
Maybe his fucking boat sank in a storm. I
can see that, that sort of new evidence,

1006
01:02:32,551 --> 01:02:36,470
but I mean, what, what sort of
new evidence did you find? Huh?

1007
01:02:37,650 --> 01:02:39,660
Some fucking old lady used to bang,

1008
01:02:40,290 --> 01:02:44,610
I guess when she was fucking not
even a fetus and she's still alive.

1009
01:02:45,540 --> 01:02:49,980
I actually knew Christopher Columbus.
He was a murderer in son of a bitch.

1010
01:02:51,390 --> 01:02:54,510
I don't know who the fuck
knows what happened. I just
like bringing that shit up.

1011
01:02:54,511 --> 01:02:57,810
So then people who were into that stuff
can then send me a five page email,

1012
01:02:58,380 --> 01:03:02,310
you know, or the lazy ones who
then just search it, find it,

1013
01:03:02,311 --> 01:03:04,560
and then paste the link
like they're an expert.

1014
01:03:05,610 --> 01:03:08,880
I'm lashing out at everybody this week.
It's Christopher Columbus Day. Everybody,

1015
01:03:09,510 --> 01:03:13,590
you know, and thank God he
discovered America or else
we wouldn't have been here.

1016
01:03:13,591 --> 01:03:15,120
Think about what would have happened.

1017
01:03:15,540 --> 01:03:19,770
What wouldn't have happened if he
didn't come over here? You know,

1018
01:03:22,020 --> 01:03:24,930
from slavery to cheesecake factory's,

1019
01:03:24,931 --> 01:03:27,710
none of that would have
been a possibility here.

1020
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:35,100
If that fucking greedy son of a bitch.
They actually took a lot of balls.

1021
01:03:35,101 --> 01:03:37,950
He, I think he's the first x
Gamer. You know what I mean?

1022
01:03:39,990 --> 01:03:42,510
He just said fun. Is that
really is, was he a scientist?

1023
01:03:42,810 --> 01:03:46,050
Where did Christopher Columbus get the
balls? Because I'll tell you right now,

1024
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:51,200
me being the afraid of technology
person that I am afraid of change.

1025
01:03:51,780 --> 01:03:55,770
You know there's no fucking way
I would've gotten that boat.

1026
01:03:57,780 --> 01:03:58,830
There's no goddamn way.

1027
01:04:00,060 --> 01:04:02,670
I know the world's round and I
won't get on a fucking boat today.

1028
01:04:02,820 --> 01:04:03,720
What do you think about that?

1029
01:04:05,910 --> 01:04:10,380
Are you afraid that it's going to sink
bill? Yes I am. That's what I'm afraid of.

1030
01:04:10,381 --> 01:04:14,910
I'm afraid I'm going to survive it and
then sit there and pray that hypothermia

1031
01:04:14,911 --> 01:04:19,790
sets in in numbs me up so I don't feel
it when the fucking tiger shark starts

1032
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:22,710
nibbling on one of my
fucking pasty thighs.

1033
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:26,580
I'm sorry guys.
This is really fucking angry.

1034
01:04:26,581 --> 01:04:30,480
That guy just really set me off where
the devacy exact fucking reason why I

1035
01:04:30,481 --> 01:04:31,830
became a goddamn comedian,

1036
01:04:32,010 --> 01:04:35,640
cause I don't want to ever be in a
position where some douche comes over,

1037
01:04:35,790 --> 01:04:39,870
leans over into my life and tells me
what I might want to make a fucking

1038
01:04:39,871 --> 01:04:43,650
priority. You condescending. Fuck.

1039
01:04:45,270 --> 01:04:47,910
What kind of a mouse of
a woman did you marry?

1040
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:51,190
She's probably downstairs
right now making a Voodoo doll.

1041
01:04:51,210 --> 01:04:55,200
You and your fucking Docker's
the affect gut hanging out.

1042
01:04:55,410 --> 01:04:58,150
You wouldn't have those guys. Huh? Yo,

1043
01:04:58,280 --> 01:05:01,950
he's got to wear the sport coat and no
one knows how fat you are until till they

1044
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:06,120
have the office fucking let's go play
Frisbee party and then you show up with

1045
01:05:06,121 --> 01:05:10,200
your fucking man tits,
heart disease buddy.

1046
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:13,920
That's what I wish on you. Go Fuck
Yourself. Listen to another podcast.

1047
01:05:13,921 --> 01:05:16,830
You might want to make that a priority.
All right,

1048
01:05:17,050 --> 01:05:20,350
so let's get on with the hyping
for this week. I have, um,

1049
01:05:22,570 --> 01:05:27,190
I have a new show. Did, I actually
haven't even hyped on here. Uh,

1050
01:05:27,250 --> 01:05:31,510
it's the last second. I'm going to
be at the Wilbur Theater in Boston,

1051
01:05:31,511 --> 01:05:36,511
Massachusetts and I am doing a comedy
show actually from my brother who was

1052
01:05:38,530 --> 01:05:41,170
running for state Senate in Massachusetts.

1053
01:05:41,740 --> 01:05:46,740
And a all proceeds will go after
we paid for the theater and uh,

1054
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:51,280
the state tax at a though, you know,
God knows what else you got to pay,

1055
01:05:51,281 --> 01:05:53,820
but all the proceeds are
going to go towards, uh,

1056
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:57,790
helping him out with his campaign. So, um,

1057
01:05:58,930 --> 01:06:00,370
that's it.
All right.

1058
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:05,400
It's going to be October 20th
at the Wilbur Theater in,

1059
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:09,100
uh, Boston, Massachusetts.
So come on down,

1060
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:14,700
come on down and watch me dance around
like a monkey for a fucking hour and a,

1061
01:06:17,460 --> 01:06:20,920
and we'll raise some money
for my brother's campaign.
There you go. There you go.

1062
01:06:22,750 --> 01:06:24,790
You know,
you might want to make that a priority.

1063
01:06:24,791 --> 01:06:27,130
I'm not gonna be able to get
that out of my fucking head.

1064
01:06:28,540 --> 01:06:30,190
That's the exact reason.
That's why I worked in,

1065
01:06:30,220 --> 01:06:32,050
that's why I worked in the warehouse.

1066
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:36,400
I never went into the carpeted area
because I saw those fucking people.

1067
01:06:36,550 --> 01:06:39,370
They had to sit there at that
Goddamn desk. And you just saw,

1068
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:43,150
he saw the back of their necks when
you came, you said, you know, Hey Mike,

1069
01:06:43,690 --> 01:06:46,510
he just saw the shoulders come up a little
bit because they thought it was that

1070
01:06:46,540 --> 01:06:50,290
cunt in the office who leans over to
tell them what they might want to make a

1071
01:06:50,291 --> 01:06:53,770
fucking priority.
All right.

1072
01:06:55,060 --> 01:06:59,950
Okay, I am back. Um,
let's talk NFL football.

1073
01:06:59,951 --> 01:07:04,780
Everybody. Let's fucking just drive
that subject into the Goddamn ground,

1074
01:07:04,781 --> 01:07:08,380
shall we? Um, now fuck that. We'll
get to that a little bit later.

1075
01:07:09,940 --> 01:07:11,980
Um, let's talk about
online banking. Shall We?

1076
01:07:12,790 --> 01:07:17,740
[inaudible] was listening to am
radio this week. You know why?

1077
01:07:17,980 --> 01:07:19,750
Cause I'm a big fan of
the fill Henry show.

1078
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:24,700
So I was listening to that and I just
woke up the next day and I still had it on

1079
01:07:24,701 --> 01:07:27,580
that. And uh, you know,

1080
01:07:27,581 --> 01:07:32,440
there was this one show with this
guy was as left as Fox is right.

1081
01:07:32,441 --> 01:07:34,330
And it was just,
it was completely asinine.

1082
01:07:34,690 --> 01:07:38,740
And he was making the usual
statements that idiots make who,

1083
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:42,670
who host those shows or
listened to those shows.

1084
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:46,840
He started saying something
dumb about like, uh, you know,

1085
01:07:46,841 --> 01:07:51,070
when Republicans lie in Washington, no
one cares. Nobody does anything about it.

1086
01:07:51,071 --> 01:07:54,400
But if a Democrat, Lars, they just
hold their feet to the fire, you know,

1087
01:07:54,401 --> 01:07:57,520
that dumb shit. You know,
they could do whatever they
want, but if we do something,

1088
01:07:57,521 --> 01:07:58,690
but it's like really,

1089
01:07:58,810 --> 01:08:01,920
you don't think that you're so
far to one side that maybe you're,

1090
01:08:02,140 --> 01:08:04,300
you're just a little bit
clouded in your vision.

1091
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:09,220
You don't really fucking notice
like a sports fan, you know,

1092
01:08:10,780 --> 01:08:12,250
like a Yankee Fan,
right?

1093
01:08:12,790 --> 01:08:16,370
Some fucking eight year old pulls
a routine fly ball into the stands.

1094
01:08:16,790 --> 01:08:19,910
As long as it's a home run for your
team, you don't give a fuck. Right?

1095
01:08:20,780 --> 01:08:23,450
Then all of a sudden if someone on
the other team is fucking around,

1096
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:25,250
then it's a major God damn problem.

1097
01:08:25,430 --> 01:08:29,180
Like every fan I should've just picked
on the Yankee fans should I have,

1098
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:32,300
I'll tell you, that was an amazing victory
they had over the twins. You see that?

1099
01:08:32,301 --> 01:08:34,940
They fucking swept those sons of bitches
right on the rug. How'd you like that?

1100
01:08:34,941 --> 01:08:37,160
Minnesota with the new stadium.
Uh,

1101
01:08:37,260 --> 01:08:38,630
what'd you think that was
going to make a difference?

1102
01:08:38,900 --> 01:08:43,670
Maybe if we play outside we won't get
our asses kicked. Do you understand that?

1103
01:08:43,671 --> 01:08:47,360
You're a mom and pop store out there
and you're going up against Walmart.

1104
01:08:47,820 --> 01:08:52,550
All right. Get your grandmother
off the front porch with a shotgun.

1105
01:08:52,551 --> 01:08:55,670
It's fucking over.
Um,

1106
01:08:57,350 --> 01:08:59,090
this is how much I don't watch baseball.

1107
01:08:59,150 --> 01:09:02,780
I thought the reds were in last place
like they have been for like the last 10

1108
01:09:02,781 --> 01:09:06,800
years. So it was kind of exciting to
see them in a first, uh, you know,

1109
01:09:06,830 --> 01:09:08,840
playing in the playoffs a little.

1110
01:09:08,841 --> 01:09:12,830
The Phillies were spanking
their fucking ass. I know,

1111
01:09:13,310 --> 01:09:17,270
I got a weird relationship with
Cincinnati. They beat my red sox in 1975.

1112
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:20,900
So one of the first memories
I have of being a sports fan,

1113
01:09:21,230 --> 01:09:22,760
I didn't really know what was going on.

1114
01:09:22,761 --> 01:09:27,380
I just remember hearing my dad's
screaming at the fucking TV. Um,

1115
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:34,280
so they beat us then, but then I don't,
I kinda liked him. I always liked, uh,

1116
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:36,830
I love was a big national
league fan in the 80s.

1117
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:41,780
I like the astroturf people stole basis.
I thought, I thought astro turf was cool.

1118
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:46,580
That's how much of a child of the
70s and eighties I was. But um,

1119
01:09:48,410 --> 01:09:50,930
I don't know.
Now they're back kind of rooting for them.

1120
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:55,010
But I had such a shit weekend last time
I was out there and fucking nor Kentucky

1121
01:09:56,350 --> 01:09:59,990
and being in downtown Cincinnati where
there was just absolutely nothing going

1122
01:09:59,991 --> 01:10:04,070
on plus past 5:00 PM that you want
to be involved in. So I don't know.

1123
01:10:04,071 --> 01:10:08,780
I think I'm rooting for the
Phillies. Does that, my team,

1124
01:10:08,870 --> 01:10:12,620
obviously anybody who plays the fucking
Yankees I'm going to root against,

1125
01:10:13,460 --> 01:10:16,430
but you know, uh, you son of a bitch.

1126
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:21,290
You guys want to hear me take a phone
call? Huh? Business phone call. Hello?

1127
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:25,940
What's going on, Josh? How are you?

1128
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:30,480
Do I sound odd right
now it's because I'm a,

1129
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:32,480
I'm in the middle of doing my podcast

1130
01:10:36,290 --> 01:10:37,670
and you're not really on the air.
You're,

1131
01:10:37,671 --> 01:10:40,280
you're up to my ear so no
one can really hear anything.

1132
01:10:40,310 --> 01:10:43,770
So if you want to trash these fucking
morons, then I'm morons. You know,

1133
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:45,170
it was just one person pissed me off,

1134
01:10:45,171 --> 01:10:49,250
told me something that I need to make
a priority on my podcast and suddenly I

1135
01:10:49,251 --> 01:10:50,540
felt like I had a day job.

1136
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:55,340
You want to email me those flights and
that stuff and I'll look at it after the

1137
01:10:55,341 --> 01:10:56,174
podcast.

1138
01:11:00,380 --> 01:11:02,840
Oh, Jesus. Okay.

1139
01:11:09,790 --> 01:11:12,830
All right. Hang on one second.
Hang on. Hang on. Hang on. Hang on.

1140
01:11:15,260 --> 01:11:18,540
All right, I'm back. Sorry. That
turned out to be way more important.

1141
01:11:18,541 --> 01:11:20,610
I thought it was going to say,
do you want to fly to Seattle?

1142
01:11:20,611 --> 01:11:25,170
At this hour or this hour. Um, and he was,

1143
01:11:25,171 --> 01:11:28,320
what the hell was I talking about?
God dammit.

1144
01:11:29,490 --> 01:11:32,970
Just talking about Democrats,
Republicans at Javits. Who gives a fuck?

1145
01:11:32,971 --> 01:11:36,150
Let's talk about, oh, it's talking
about baseball. Talk about, basically,

1146
01:11:36,151 --> 01:11:37,530
I don't even know what's
going on in there.

1147
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:41,340
I know Mariano Rivera Rivera's still
playing, right? He still comes out.

1148
01:11:41,550 --> 01:11:44,280
They play a little enter Sandman. You
know, he doesn't even like that song.

1149
01:11:44,340 --> 01:11:48,480
I'll fucking funny. Is it? Huh? Um, Bill,

1150
01:11:48,481 --> 01:11:49,410
it's actually not funny.

1151
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:52,860
Kind of like the last three
minutes of this fucking
podcast. Oh, right. All right.

1152
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:56,010
All right, let's, let's, uh, let's
move on with some subjects here.

1153
01:11:57,180 --> 01:12:00,210
Do I have anything? How
about we talk about, um,

1154
01:12:01,300 --> 01:12:03,600
just talk about Randy Moss
getting fucking traded

1155
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:08,490
by the Goddamn patriots. This is, um,

1156
01:12:10,830 --> 01:12:12,600
I dunno what the fuck I was like,
she's going to say there,

1157
01:12:13,350 --> 01:12:16,230
I'm looking at like 15 different things
right now. People. That's what I need.

1158
01:12:16,260 --> 01:12:20,090
I need to regroup. All
right. First of all,

1159
01:12:20,140 --> 01:12:23,880
he had a weird weekend football cause
this week my team had a by, you know,

1160
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:25,770
and it's just such like a fucking,
I don't know,

1161
01:12:25,771 --> 01:12:29,100
it's the weirdest guide is like
that Phantom Limb Syndrome.

1162
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:33,060
You're reaching for it and it's
just not fucking there. You know?

1163
01:12:33,450 --> 01:12:36,270
I like when you go to a mall and you
can't remember where the fuck you parked.

1164
01:12:36,490 --> 01:12:38,760
He just spend enough God
damn hour just searching,

1165
01:12:40,410 --> 01:12:43,260
riding around in a golf cart
with that fucking security guard.

1166
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:48,240
Presti alarm key. Pressy lumpy.
You'd think I'm not doing that.

1167
01:12:48,270 --> 01:12:51,960
You think I'm not doing
that? Um, so anyways, yeah,

1168
01:12:51,961 --> 01:12:53,400
the Patriots Traded Randy Moss,

1169
01:12:53,401 --> 01:12:57,840
so I got a bunch of emails from the
happy jet fans and they're sitting there

1170
01:12:57,841 --> 01:12:58,730
going like this.

1171
01:12:58,770 --> 01:13:02,370
What are they fucking morons with the
fuck would you fucking build fucking

1172
01:13:02,371 --> 01:13:06,120
fucking net for?
And I think it's the obvious.

1173
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:10,620
I think he was a, I think he was being
a problem in the fucking locker room.

1174
01:13:10,860 --> 01:13:12,180
Why else would you trade him?

1175
01:13:12,330 --> 01:13:16,920
Why would you trade Randy Moss
for a fucking third round pick?

1176
01:13:16,921 --> 01:13:17,820
Why would you do that?

1177
01:13:17,940 --> 01:13:21,840
What level of account would you have
to be in order to make that happen?

1178
01:13:21,970 --> 01:13:23,980
I know what a lot of people are gonna say.
Well the Patriots,

1179
01:13:24,050 --> 01:13:25,430
you say we never had a
fucking problem with it.

1180
01:13:25,530 --> 01:13:26,730
What do you think they're going to say?

1181
01:13:28,350 --> 01:13:32,340
They're trying to get that out
of their fucking locker room.

1182
01:13:34,650 --> 01:13:37,680
So I actually haven't had this big back
and forth with this dude cause I was

1183
01:13:37,681 --> 01:13:42,270
trying to talk to him about like he was
trying to tell me how fucking dumb it

1184
01:13:42,271 --> 01:13:46,560
was that the Patriots traded that
guy. And I'm just, it's just like,

1185
01:13:46,561 --> 01:13:50,400
haven't you seen tos?
Haven't you seen Stephon Marbury is,

1186
01:13:50,401 --> 01:13:53,160
you haven't seen these guys. They've
got all the talent in the fucking world,

1187
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:54,353
but they don't,
they're,

1188
01:13:54,490 --> 01:13:56,610
they're not even focused on
whether they're winning or losing.

1189
01:13:56,730 --> 01:14:00,630
They're just looking at their fucking
stats. And when half time comes around,

1190
01:14:00,750 --> 01:14:04,320
if they don't have their fucking 15
points already or they're five fucking

1191
01:14:04,770 --> 01:14:06,570
catchers or somebody else
has more catches in them,

1192
01:14:06,720 --> 01:14:11,520
they start acting cunty
which affects the mood in,

1193
01:14:11,521 --> 01:14:13,060
in, in the, in the goddamn locker room.

1194
01:14:13,070 --> 01:14:15,910
So I was talking to sue about team
chemistry fucking intangibles,

1195
01:14:15,911 --> 01:14:18,610
which he thought was ridiculous.
He's like,

1196
01:14:18,611 --> 01:14:22,150
are you one of these people who talks
about intangibles? It doesn't matter.

1197
01:14:22,151 --> 01:14:24,220
It's all about what you
do on the fucking field.

1198
01:14:25,450 --> 01:14:30,450
Really intangibles was the reason why
I knew Peyton manning wasn't as good as

1199
01:14:30,701 --> 01:14:34,420
Tom Brady when it really came down to it,

1200
01:14:36,100 --> 01:14:39,820
because that guy is far as dropping back,
throwing a ball,

1201
01:14:40,060 --> 01:14:43,060
making a completion, has
it all over. Tom Brady.

1202
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:47,530
He's at least 30% better
in all of those categories.

1203
01:14:47,860 --> 01:14:50,140
His stats are as leads 30% better,

1204
01:14:50,740 --> 01:14:55,740
but the fucking intangible is what goes
on between your fucking ears when the

1205
01:14:55,931 --> 01:15:00,580
pressure is on and all of a
sudden it fucking counts in.

1206
01:15:00,581 --> 01:15:03,460
The whole season's on the line.
What do you do?

1207
01:15:03,610 --> 01:15:07,510
Do you drive your team down for a score
or do you throw a fucking pick six?

1208
01:15:08,020 --> 01:15:11,740
Do you lead your team to victory or do
you lose to the eight and eight chargers?

1209
01:15:12,430 --> 01:15:13,570
If you're frustrated,

1210
01:15:13,900 --> 01:15:17,530
do you fucking hold it in and turn it
into something positive and lead your team

1211
01:15:17,590 --> 01:15:19,060
or do you openly show it?

1212
01:15:19,061 --> 01:15:22,870
Like I saw him do again yesterday
against the Kansas City chiefs.

1213
01:15:22,990 --> 01:15:27,430
He had Peyton face. Oh, I can't
get the ball where I work.

1214
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:32,370
Yeah, why don't you a bitch again
and get a new fucking rule chain.

1215
01:15:32,371 --> 01:15:34,600
So Kansas City can't play
fucking defense on you.

1216
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:38,110
Did you guys notice Kansas City has
Romeo, Carmel, and Charlie Weiss.

1217
01:15:38,140 --> 01:15:41,800
They basically have our
offensive and defensive
coordinator from back in the day.

1218
01:15:42,190 --> 01:15:43,660
Smart sons of bitches over there.

1219
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:46,420
And they were doing the exact same
shit that the patriots used to do.

1220
01:15:46,540 --> 01:15:49,300
They just didn't have the personnel
to do it for 60 fucking minutes.

1221
01:15:49,301 --> 01:15:54,250
And Peyton had the exact same fucking
look on his face that he had from o two o

1222
01:15:54,251 --> 01:15:56,800
three Oh four when he couldn't
beat the fucking patriots.

1223
01:15:57,820 --> 01:16:00,400
That sir is what I'm talking about.

1224
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:05,680
That's why people say Derek Jeter is
better than a rod despite a rods fucking

1225
01:16:05,681 --> 01:16:10,390
stats. I'm telling you,
Derek Jeter, I would, I,

1226
01:16:10,391 --> 01:16:13,660
you can build a team around that.
Can't build a team around fucking a rod.

1227
01:16:14,620 --> 01:16:17,440
You know, they're in the moment
when he's supposed to be getting,

1228
01:16:17,441 --> 01:16:18,251
you know he's supposed to,
you know,

1229
01:16:18,251 --> 01:16:21,730
you don't have three game fucking losing
streak and you need the captain to step

1230
01:16:21,731 --> 01:16:24,810
up. You know, say something.

1231
01:16:24,830 --> 01:16:28,360
Get the guys go and ea rods over in
the corner putting fucking lip balm on.

1232
01:16:29,110 --> 01:16:30,220
It's not a Goddamn leader.

1233
01:16:31,060 --> 01:16:33,310
He's over there staring at
himself in the fucking mirror.

1234
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:37,180
I don't know the fuck are
you going to say no, look,

1235
01:16:37,181 --> 01:16:38,290
this is what this how I look at it.

1236
01:16:38,530 --> 01:16:43,330
If you trade a guy is good as Randy Moss
for a third round pick out of fucking

1237
01:16:43,331 --> 01:16:47,500
nowhere, he did something so conti
that they just said, you know what,

1238
01:16:48,220 --> 01:16:51,250
it's like the lock,
the door test in a Bronx tale.

1239
01:16:51,730 --> 01:16:54,400
He did something and this was
just the tip of the iceberg.

1240
01:16:54,401 --> 01:16:58,450
We're fucking out and you
know, didn't, you know, deepen
your heart, Patriot's fan.

1241
01:16:58,690 --> 01:17:03,520
Didn't you know that? Eventually it,
does it ever end good with Randy.

1242
01:17:03,521 --> 01:17:08,470
Has he ended well with any team member?
With the Vikings?

1243
01:17:09,110 --> 01:17:12,620
Yeah. I take a few plays off, you know,

1244
01:17:12,660 --> 01:17:16,330
goes out to Oakland cause they're
like, oh, this guy's a headcase.

1245
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:19,840
We always take on head cases and then
all of a sudden they become good guys.

1246
01:17:19,841 --> 01:17:23,020
He for fucking problem there. And
he did the same thing out here. So,

1247
01:17:24,220 --> 01:17:26,660
so what are you going to do
the fuck you going to do?

1248
01:17:26,661 --> 01:17:28,990
What do you think the Patriots were going
to win it? Every scene. Our defense,

1249
01:17:28,991 --> 01:17:30,430
even though we beat the fucking dolphins,

1250
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:33,130
didn't we looked like we were in a
prevent defense from the fucking first

1251
01:17:33,131 --> 01:17:37,380
quarter on. So, um, I dunno,

1252
01:17:37,410 --> 01:17:41,970
I'm not that fucking freaked out about
it considering when I look at the

1253
01:17:41,971 --> 01:17:44,580
receivers that we had
when we won super bowls,

1254
01:17:45,430 --> 01:17:47,810
we didn't have a Jerry Rice level.
Okay.

1255
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:51,920
Unless you think David Patton
was that guy. I, man, I
don't fucking know. Whatever.

1256
01:17:51,950 --> 01:17:54,380
We have a goddamn system.
You have to, bottom line is,

1257
01:17:54,530 --> 01:17:59,530
is Randy's a fucking headcase and
the Patriots are an arrogant miserly

1258
01:17:59,601 --> 01:18:04,550
franchise. Okay. So we don't
tolerate looking at, we like,

1259
01:18:04,551 --> 01:18:08,890
I, the Patriots don't fucking tolerate you
being a cut in the locker room. And, uh,

1260
01:18:10,020 --> 01:18:13,410
I think he was done the second he had
that stupid fucking press conference

1261
01:18:14,100 --> 01:18:14,611
saying,

1262
01:18:14,611 --> 01:18:19,611
I think there's people here in New England
that don't want to see me do well out

1263
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:20,791
Jesus Christ.

1264
01:18:20,791 --> 01:18:25,410
Go take your fucking Goddamn
tampons and go to fucking Minnesota.

1265
01:18:25,620 --> 01:18:28,320
And you know what he's going to do out
there tonight? You think? I don't know.

1266
01:18:28,321 --> 01:18:30,540
He's not going to get 180
fucking yards tonight.

1267
01:18:30,900 --> 01:18:33,480
He's going to do exactly what Manny
did when he went to the Dodgers.

1268
01:18:33,481 --> 01:18:37,740
He's going to try for like fucking six
weeks because he wants to PR, you know,

1269
01:18:37,741 --> 01:18:40,200
show everybody.
He's not the guy that he fucking is,

1270
01:18:40,530 --> 01:18:44,840
but eventually that'll all go south.
You know Jesus.

1271
01:18:44,841 --> 01:18:48,620
What a cluster fuck tonight
is, Huh? Randy Moss is in town.

1272
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:52,780
You got Rex Ryan, you've talked
to all that shit. And uh,

1273
01:18:52,820 --> 01:18:54,620
Brett Farve showed everybody his dick.

1274
01:19:01,860 --> 01:19:03,780
I know what a lot of you
will probably thinking.

1275
01:19:03,781 --> 01:19:08,781
How fucking stupid do you have to
be this day and age to be famous?

1276
01:19:09,350 --> 01:19:12,590
Take a picture of your unit and
fucking send it to somebody.

1277
01:19:12,591 --> 01:19:15,680
How fucking dumb do you have to be?
I'm telling you right now.

1278
01:19:15,681 --> 01:19:18,840
You're looking at it the wrong way.
All right?

1279
01:19:18,841 --> 01:19:23,841
What you really have to see is the
level of ass that you get when you play

1280
01:19:26,401 --> 01:19:29,580
quarterback for football team.
What you see in Brett Farve

1281
01:19:31,340 --> 01:19:34,220
because my first thing was like
when he did that, I was just like,

1282
01:19:34,370 --> 01:19:38,680
well why didn't he just fucking
verbally closed the deal?

1283
01:19:38,681 --> 01:19:40,930
Why don't you just go up, talk
some shit, make her laugh,

1284
01:19:40,931 --> 01:19:45,230
get her fucking number and then
go out with her. I'm Brett Farve.

1285
01:19:45,231 --> 01:19:48,320
I like wrangler jeans. You want
to see my Dick? I mean like what?

1286
01:19:48,420 --> 01:19:49,730
What kind of fucking game?

1287
01:19:50,020 --> 01:19:53,960
And then I mean it was like this guy has
no fucking game with women because he

1288
01:19:53,961 --> 01:19:58,900
never had to.
He's Jesus like the classic.

1289
01:19:58,901 --> 01:20:03,730
All American fucking Dudley do right
face and he's the quarterback of the team

1290
01:20:03,731 --> 01:20:07,680
probably from junior high on
chicks would just up to him.

1291
01:20:08,420 --> 01:20:13,010
Oh my God. Bread. I got
it. God is that farm bread.

1292
01:20:13,011 --> 01:20:14,140
How did you do that?

1293
01:20:14,410 --> 01:20:19,130
Thank you. Thank you. Won't see my
deck. Where's he from? Mississippi.

1294
01:20:19,160 --> 01:20:20,840
You can do that still in Mississippi.

1295
01:20:20,841 --> 01:20:23,330
You can walk down the street with your
Dick hanging out of your overalls.

1296
01:20:23,331 --> 01:20:27,500
No one gives a shit. Yeah.
More to Dick hanging out. Shit,

1297
01:20:28,190 --> 01:20:30,590
you want to go fishing?
They don't give a shit

1298
01:20:32,390 --> 01:20:36,710
this whole fucking career. He's been the
fucking man. And when you're the man,

1299
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:40,360
the fucking who is,
don't give a shit.

1300
01:20:41,660 --> 01:20:45,570
They take, they take fucking
stampede. You. I bet that,

1301
01:20:45,571 --> 01:20:49,440
I bet that that was his game.
Just like fucking Ben Roethlisberger.

1302
01:20:49,441 --> 01:20:51,990
I'm starting to think that that
guy wasn't a goddamn sex offender.

1303
01:20:52,110 --> 01:20:56,280
I just think he's been the quarterback.
He's been the man, so he has no game.

1304
01:20:56,560 --> 01:21:00,640
So he just walks into a bar and he's
like tits and he just reaches over and

1305
01:21:00,641 --> 01:21:01,474
grabs them.

1306
01:21:03,740 --> 01:21:04,573
Okay.

1307
01:21:05,690 --> 01:21:09,770
So, uh, I don't think that those guys
are morons. I look at them the same way.

1308
01:21:09,771 --> 01:21:14,080
When people look at someone who
grew up in the inner city, you know,

1309
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:17,440
and they didn't have
access to, to the, to the,

1310
01:21:17,470 --> 01:21:20,560
to the good books in their
school was a fucking war zone.

1311
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:22,390
And if you stuck anybody in there,

1312
01:21:23,380 --> 01:21:26,440
they also would come out and would
it be at a fucking, you know,

1313
01:21:26,441 --> 01:21:28,930
seventh grade reading level,
right?

1314
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:33,750
The same way with me or anybody else.
If I was the fucking man,

1315
01:21:33,751 --> 01:21:37,470
if I was the quarterback from
fucking junior high on, oh,

1316
01:21:37,730 --> 01:21:41,170
I'd be hanging out at Hooters,
just grab and titties.

1317
01:21:42,070 --> 01:21:42,920
Oh you want to see mine

1318
01:21:42,970 --> 01:21:47,830
dick?
I loved that he did that.

1319
01:21:48,170 --> 01:21:49,430
I love that he did that.
You know,

1320
01:21:49,610 --> 01:21:52,250
cause you see him do all that shit
on TV and you're like, Jesus Christ,

1321
01:21:53,700 --> 01:21:56,970
I couldn't hit a golf ball as far as
that guy can throw a fucking football.

1322
01:21:56,980 --> 01:21:59,820
What happened to me genetically?
What the fuck is wrong with me?

1323
01:22:00,030 --> 01:22:05,030
And then Brett Farve does something like
daddy takes a picture of his Dick and

1324
01:22:05,161 --> 01:22:09,640
then sends it to somebody and
it's just like a, I dunno,

1325
01:22:11,310 --> 01:22:15,640
you know, it's just, there's something,
uh, it's just fucking hilarious.

1326
01:22:17,410 --> 01:22:20,680
So evidently they going to do these
stupid pink uniforms for the rest of the,

1327
01:22:20,681 --> 01:22:25,590
I mean, how are you not aware of, of
breast cancer at this point? You know,

1328
01:22:28,900 --> 01:22:32,440
Goddamn Nfl, don't you have
enough fans? Yeah, we'll, we'll,

1329
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:37,480
we'll even appeal to fucking women
with breast cancer show that we care.

1330
01:22:37,740 --> 01:22:40,470
You know, it's a fucking, you know what
saying? I know that sounds fucking mean,

1331
01:22:40,590 --> 01:22:43,830
but I'm telling you that was
how that decision was made.

1332
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:47,500
And I know because I
wasn't in the meeting,

1333
01:22:48,700 --> 01:22:53,230
I just lump all corporations into the
same shit bag. That's what I do. Um,

1334
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:56,290
all right. Here's a guy actually says a
underrated overrated this week. He said,

1335
01:22:57,100 --> 01:23:00,100
uh, he, and he's talking about
the Shit Shit. He was saying, um,

1336
01:23:00,680 --> 01:23:04,360
over rate of breast cancer is a terrible
thing, but why does it take precedent?

1337
01:23:05,290 --> 01:23:05,830
Oh,
uh,

1338
01:23:05,830 --> 01:23:10,120
over all other forms of cancer to the
point where everyone in the NFL has to

1339
01:23:10,121 --> 01:23:14,320
spend a month of October looking
like they're in the heart foundation,

1340
01:23:14,830 --> 01:23:18,640
all for the sake of breast cancer
awareness. Who isn't aware?

1341
01:23:19,570 --> 01:23:23,500
It's the number one killer of
women were told apparently though,

1342
01:23:23,501 --> 01:23:28,501
it's actually number seven behind six
under six other things that men also die

1343
01:23:28,781 --> 01:23:31,330
of. Oh, that's interesting.

1344
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:36,070
So I guess they mean it's the number
one killer of women only. I don't know.

1345
01:23:36,071 --> 01:23:40,590
Granted, men do in rare cases
also get breast cancer, but uh,

1346
01:23:42,310 --> 01:23:44,980
it's clearly not about them.
I don't think anyone could get,

1347
01:23:44,981 --> 01:23:49,420
go to go through a benefit for a man
with breast cancer without giggling a

1348
01:23:49,421 --> 01:23:53,170
little. Uh, what's the number one
killer of men? I have no idea.

1349
01:23:53,171 --> 01:23:56,200
No one does prostate cancer.
September is prostate,

1350
01:23:56,380 --> 01:24:00,220
prostate cancer awareness month,
which I didn't know until I googled it.

1351
01:24:00,221 --> 01:24:05,170
Prostate cancer needs the breast
cancer PR team, uh, colon cancer,

1352
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:10,420
they get a brown ribbon to quote my
friend Nate, can you think of a more,

1353
01:24:10,780 --> 01:24:15,040
I don't give a shit color than Brown.
So there you go. Yeah. You know,

1354
01:24:15,041 --> 01:24:17,920
I thought it was cool last year that
they did it, but it's like every year,

1355
01:24:17,930 --> 01:24:21,160
are they going to be wearing pink?
You know,

1356
01:24:23,580 --> 01:24:27,010
I just, you know, with the fucking,
every given he's got a goddamn ribbon.

1357
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:32,260
You know what's funny is when they did
it last year, it actually had effect,

1358
01:24:33,700 --> 01:24:36,850
you know, where I was just like, oh,
what the, what the fuck are they wearing?

1359
01:24:36,851 --> 01:24:39,700
Pink for Oh, breast cancer
awareness. And then, then it's over,

1360
01:24:40,450 --> 01:24:45,220
then it's over and now you're making
jaws two and no one gives a shit, right?

1361
01:24:45,221 --> 01:24:48,760
Spielberg isn't directing. It's over.
It's over. We got it. We're aware.

1362
01:24:49,630 --> 01:24:53,080
We are aware of, all right.
Overrated. Uh, the Foa,

1363
01:24:53,080 --> 01:24:54,970
Harris fohawk style.

1364
01:24:56,110 --> 01:24:58,420
The only reason it's overrated
is because you don't,

1365
01:24:58,660 --> 01:25:01,930
you don't have a segment on
your podcast called fucking gay.

1366
01:25:04,240 --> 01:25:08,560
If you want a Mohawk, that's cool.
Just man up and do it the right way.

1367
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:13,060
So there you go. There you go. I
got to MIT guys. You know what?

1368
01:25:13,810 --> 01:25:17,470
For the last 10 minutes, I felt like I
had absolutely nothing to talk about.

1369
01:25:18,310 --> 01:25:20,950
I know what's going on in my life.
I'm thinking about buying a fucking house.

1370
01:25:21,170 --> 01:25:22,390
Let's talk about my life for a second.

1371
01:25:22,391 --> 01:25:24,070
I'm thinking about buying
a fucking house out here.

1372
01:25:24,071 --> 01:25:27,940
And I live in a bankrupt state in a city
that technically has no water supply

1373
01:25:28,300 --> 01:25:33,300
and they want about 1.2 to one point $4
million for anything remotely fucking

1374
01:25:33,521 --> 01:25:37,520
decent out here. And uh, um, I,

1375
01:25:37,640 --> 01:25:42,630
I can't do it. I'm not,
do you know what? Fuck it.

1376
01:25:44,650 --> 01:25:48,700
I'm not going to be one point
something million dollars in debt.

1377
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:52,750
I'll be on the road for the
rest of my fucking life.

1378
01:25:54,100 --> 01:25:57,490
So I've been going on the Internet
and I've been looking at places,

1379
01:25:59,290 --> 01:26:00,550
um,
in the middle of nowhere,

1380
01:26:01,060 --> 01:26:04,070
and I've been trying to figure out how
I can live in the middle of fucking

1381
01:26:04,071 --> 01:26:09,071
nowhere without a losing my mind and be
somehow still existing in this business.

1382
01:26:11,451 --> 01:26:15,620
And I realize I can't fucking do it.
You know

1383
01:26:18,290 --> 01:26:20,990
how many movie stars
live in Fucking Wyoming?

1384
01:26:22,010 --> 01:26:23,840
I know they got ranches out there,

1385
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:27,660
but they wait til they're fucking
famous before they go out to Anna.

1386
01:26:27,670 --> 01:26:31,430
What the fuck I'm going to do?
God dammit.

1387
01:26:33,140 --> 01:26:34,610
I'm a typical fucking American.

1388
01:26:34,611 --> 01:26:37,430
You know what you think I want some
little ass fucking house. I don't.

1389
01:26:37,431 --> 01:26:39,110
I want to fuck and spread.

1390
01:26:39,860 --> 01:26:42,530
I want a big ass God damn house.

1391
01:26:43,730 --> 01:26:47,060
I want a fucking pool inside and outside.

1392
01:26:49,490 --> 01:26:50,480
I want a god damn.

1393
01:26:52,370 --> 01:26:57,020
I know what I want and it's going
to be fucking ridiculous. But,

1394
01:26:57,470 --> 01:27:00,650
uh, you know what's funny is you, if, if,

1395
01:27:01,190 --> 01:27:05,300
whatever your job is, if it doesn't
involve you having to be there,

1396
01:27:05,570 --> 01:27:08,090
like these people who work
from home on their computers,

1397
01:27:08,330 --> 01:27:13,310
you can actually have an
MTV cribs level house.

1398
01:27:13,550 --> 01:27:17,870
You just have to live in like fucking,
you know,

1399
01:27:17,871 --> 01:27:22,400
the upper east corner of Montana.
You know,

1400
01:27:22,430 --> 01:27:24,680
granted you're going to get
attacked by a fucking bobcat.

1401
01:27:24,681 --> 01:27:26,760
Every time he'd go out to try
to fucking grill a hot dog.

1402
01:27:30,710 --> 01:27:34,370
Ah, fuck. Yeah. What the
fuck you going to do?

1403
01:27:34,371 --> 01:27:37,520
You guys wanted some youtube
videos for the week, do yet? Well,

1404
01:27:37,521 --> 01:27:40,730
I don't give a shit if you don't because
here they come. All right. Youtube, uh,

1405
01:27:40,940 --> 01:27:43,360
and our l gets knocked out.
Um,

1406
01:27:43,370 --> 01:27:46,670
this is a referee getting
knocked out and a,

1407
01:27:46,671 --> 01:27:51,560
I think it's rugby and you got to see
this because the guy who knocks out

1408
01:27:51,590 --> 01:27:56,130
inadvertently knocks out the referee
might be one of the most unathletic I on

1409
01:27:56,131 --> 01:27:58,670
athletic guys I've ever seen in my life.

1410
01:27:59,690 --> 01:28:03,650
He looks like some guy in times square
who's trying to charge you too much for a

1411
01:28:03,651 --> 01:28:08,651
fucking digital camera and
he's got a fat round face.

1412
01:28:09,980 --> 01:28:12,290
If he had any sort of athletic ability,

1413
01:28:12,291 --> 01:28:16,010
he would have been able to jump over the
ref instead of kneeing him in the back

1414
01:28:16,011 --> 01:28:20,960
of the fucking,
well,

1415
01:28:20,961 --> 01:28:24,110
I got to tell you something.
This unathletic Douche bag,

1416
01:28:24,140 --> 01:28:28,820
he knocks this ref the fuck out.
Like I'm surprised this guy didn't die.

1417
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:34,600
This fucking pudgy jackass is running
full speed and it's the most pathetic

1418
01:28:35,181 --> 01:28:36,560
attempt to hurdle.

1419
01:28:36,561 --> 01:28:40,540
This guy couldn't hurdle of fucking
tube sock and he's trying to hurt his

1420
01:28:40,550 --> 01:28:44,970
fucking get it and they just, Ah,

1421
01:28:45,710 --> 01:28:47,130
you know, when you know,
you know, you know the,

1422
01:28:47,240 --> 01:28:50,510
the form you have when your hurdle one
legs outstretched and the other one's

1423
01:28:50,511 --> 01:28:55,310
bent, it's the bent knee and he's got
all that fucking pudgy wait, come in.

1424
01:28:55,311 --> 01:28:58,190
And he just fucking knees and right in
the back of the head and that guy just

1425
01:28:58,191 --> 01:29:02,700
goes limp. Um, all right,

1426
01:29:02,730 --> 01:29:03,563
this is one,

1427
01:29:03,570 --> 01:29:08,280
this one is actually funny and scary
is called a Turkish guy goes bananas.

1428
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:10,590
And,
uh,

1429
01:29:10,620 --> 01:29:15,620
I believe he screams a lot and he
looks like he attempts to do that.

1430
01:29:16,050 --> 01:29:17,640
You ever see those people?
Uh,

1431
01:29:18,210 --> 01:29:22,170
like the break dancers or whatever the
fuck they are or dancers in general.

1432
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:25,650
And they do that thing where they
jump up in the air like sideways,

1433
01:29:25,651 --> 01:29:28,350
like a deer and sort
of do like a three 60,

1434
01:29:28,980 --> 01:29:32,910
they'll almost like parallel to the
ground and then they somehow land and they

1435
01:29:32,911 --> 01:29:34,200
jump up and they do it again.

1436
01:29:34,230 --> 01:29:37,590
This guy is basically doing that
but he's too fat and out of shape.

1437
01:29:37,591 --> 01:29:38,460
So he's just sort of,

1438
01:29:41,640 --> 01:29:43,860
he's just sort of rolling
around on the ground,

1439
01:29:44,490 --> 01:29:49,050
but he gets his legs and his arms
out. It's a pretty, uh, he's very, uh,

1440
01:29:49,570 --> 01:29:54,060
sorta Belushi ask where he's Pudgy,
but he's very light on his feet. Um,

1441
01:29:54,180 --> 01:29:57,120
is another great one.
This is about as rock and roll as it gets.

1442
01:29:57,390 --> 01:30:02,010
Swedish singer vomits during performance.
It's just phenomenal.

1443
01:30:02,040 --> 01:30:06,100
The type of music he's singing,
the fact that he doesn't stop the,

1444
01:30:06,750 --> 01:30:09,320
he's singing like that death metal,
like order draw Bra.

1445
01:30:10,050 --> 01:30:13,620
And then occasionally he'd
be like [inaudible] and then
he actually is puking as

1446
01:30:13,621 --> 01:30:18,510
he's going. That's awesome.
Um, loud car, horn prank.

1447
01:30:18,930 --> 01:30:21,750
These are all things that you can
search or you can also also go to the

1448
01:30:22,020 --> 01:30:25,200
[inaudible] podcast.com and we'll
have all of these, the official,

1449
01:30:25,680 --> 01:30:27,510
the MM podcast.com,

1450
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:31,920
the official fan webpage on the Monday
morning podcast that is no longer on

1451
01:30:31,921 --> 01:30:35,730
iTunes. Okay. I don't know
what else I'm supposed to do.

1452
01:30:36,090 --> 01:30:38,340
We've called these people,
we've emailed them,

1453
01:30:38,370 --> 01:30:41,490
they have not gotten back
to us and they're probably,

1454
01:30:41,730 --> 01:30:44,880
I'm going to get served some sort of
papers for stocking at this point.

1455
01:30:45,270 --> 01:30:49,260
Cause that's what I feel like.
I feel like it was a girl that I went out.

1456
01:30:49,320 --> 01:30:53,370
I had a good time. Evidently
she didn't. And um,

1457
01:30:54,540 --> 01:30:58,260
you know, I went through the
whole roommate lying to me phase,

1458
01:30:59,640 --> 01:31:03,030
you know. Hello? Yeah. Hey,
it's bill. Is iTunes there?

1459
01:31:03,750 --> 01:31:06,740
I yeah. No. Um,

1460
01:31:06,770 --> 01:31:11,280
I tunes in the shower. Oh yeah.
Dina, do you know when, when,

1461
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:15,050
when they're going to be
out? Oh, I dunno. It's

1462
01:31:16,710 --> 01:31:20,700
29 minutes. Why did I say 20? Fuck. Yeah.

1463
01:31:20,730 --> 01:31:25,590
29 minutes. Okay. Fucking half hour later.

1464
01:31:25,620 --> 01:31:30,300
Hey, age, let's bill.
He's I tubes there. Um,

1465
01:31:30,330 --> 01:31:33,900
yeah, no, they're still in the shower

1466
01:31:35,820 --> 01:31:38,790
but doing that for fucking
two weeks and uh, you know,

1467
01:31:38,791 --> 01:31:43,710
it's that classic classic fucking
corporate shit where they have themselves

1468
01:31:43,711 --> 01:31:48,420
completely insulated. We'll get back
to you if we fucking feel like it.

1469
01:31:49,140 --> 01:31:53,860
Itunes, we own the tunes. Fucking cons.

1470
01:31:55,150 --> 01:31:58,620
Do you know, I saw, I think, um, when
I was listening on am radio. Dot. Even,

1471
01:31:58,710 --> 01:32:01,090
did I already talk about this or
did I start to talk about this?

1472
01:32:01,630 --> 01:32:04,900
They were talking about online
banking. Okay. The Shit.

1473
01:32:04,901 --> 01:32:07,540
Remember back in the day when
I was talking about that going,

1474
01:32:07,570 --> 01:32:12,570
you have to be out of your fucking mind
to pay bills or to do any sort of online

1475
01:32:13,931 --> 01:32:17,500
banking because someone's going to steal
your identity and take all the money

1476
01:32:17,501 --> 01:32:21,820
out of your bank account. Well, guess
what? That's exactly what's happening.

1477
01:32:23,800 --> 01:32:26,260
All these morons who sent me emails going,
dude,

1478
01:32:26,590 --> 01:32:30,310
I don't even have to go to
the post office. I don't
have to lick a fucking stamp.

1479
01:32:30,311 --> 01:32:33,580
It's so fucking easy.
That's what I love about computers.

1480
01:32:33,980 --> 01:32:37,270
Everything so fucking easy.
And then you get raped in the ass

1481
01:32:38,890 --> 01:32:42,730
and then they then, then no one ever
addresses it is that goes, hey, maybe,

1482
01:32:42,760 --> 01:32:46,030
maybe back in the day it
was a little bit better.

1483
01:32:46,031 --> 01:32:47,610
Like people sitting there going,
uh,

1484
01:32:48,490 --> 01:32:52,050
they were talking about when I
was bitching about that going,

1485
01:32:52,060 --> 01:32:53,950
I don't pay bills online.

1486
01:32:53,951 --> 01:32:58,660
I'm not having all that information
online for any fucker in the world who has

1487
01:32:59,530 --> 01:33:03,460
an ability to hack into
shit to come after my stuff.

1488
01:33:03,461 --> 01:33:06,730
I just don't want that to happen. And
then these fucking morons are going, well,

1489
01:33:06,731 --> 01:33:11,710
what about the guy down the post office?
Like,

1490
01:33:11,711 --> 01:33:15,430
that guy has access to the entire
fucking world down the post office.

1491
01:33:15,460 --> 01:33:17,740
Even though he does
have access to my shit.

1492
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:21,490
There's actually cameras on those
people. And Yeah, he might get me,

1493
01:33:21,580 --> 01:33:22,690
but they're going to get him.

1494
01:33:23,050 --> 01:33:27,190
They get those guys and those guys go
to fucking jail as opposed to someone on

1495
01:33:27,191 --> 01:33:30,880
the Internet who can look at everybody
shit once they break into it.

1496
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:36,000
So evidently they're saying that if
you are dumb enough to bank online that

1497
01:33:41,050 --> 01:33:46,050
they're saying don't use
the same computer that uh,

1498
01:33:47,530 --> 01:33:50,860
that you bank with tea
to do like email with.

1499
01:33:51,100 --> 01:33:53,470
Cause evidently that's how they get in.
I have no idea.

1500
01:33:53,471 --> 01:33:56,830
But someone told me awhile ago that
all my information is already up on the

1501
01:33:56,831 --> 01:34:01,831
fucking Internet anyways
because my country bank put
it up there just in case I

1502
01:34:02,801 --> 01:34:05,020
want to, I want to bank
online. It's like, no,

1503
01:34:05,021 --> 01:34:09,490
it's not just in case it's cause you're
phasing out fucking cash and this is the

1504
01:34:09,491 --> 01:34:11,590
direction you've taken my money.

1505
01:34:14,050 --> 01:34:18,850
I don't know man. I have a real like got
a real fucking problem with banks. Egg.

1506
01:34:19,780 --> 01:34:22,930
What's, what are you laughing at?
Nia is here. Everybody come on in.

1507
01:34:22,931 --> 01:34:25,750
I this has just been a
real negative podcasts.

1508
01:34:27,910 --> 01:34:32,230
Come over here. You just had
a what? I just had a great
conversation with so many,

1509
01:34:32,830 --> 01:34:34,900
so, oh yeah. Did they
tell you that you know,

1510
01:34:34,901 --> 01:34:38,860
you needed to make anything a
priority? No, they didn't. Okay.

1511
01:34:38,861 --> 01:34:39,830
Who were you talking to?

1512
01:34:40,170 --> 01:34:45,170
Talking to her and an actress and she
was just positive and awesome and it was

1513
01:34:45,491 --> 01:34:47,650
great. I know you're doing, you're
fine. Can I ask you a question?

1514
01:34:47,651 --> 01:34:51,400
Why are you with me? Why am I,
yeah, why are you fucking with me?

1515
01:34:51,401 --> 01:34:53,290
I'm fucking like this
curmudgeonly old man.

1516
01:34:53,470 --> 01:34:57,590
I'm sitting here going off
on online banking and I
realize I got halfway through

1517
01:34:57,591 --> 01:35:01,340
it that I really didn't have enough facts
and am radio one the other day and I

1518
01:35:01,341 --> 01:35:06,080
felt like I knew something. Yeah. I don't
know. Why am I with you? I love you.

1519
01:35:06,590 --> 01:35:09,410
Jesus. Get out of here. Wow. Huh?

1520
01:35:10,020 --> 01:35:14,600
Well it's supposed to be funny.
Yes. It's supposed to be funny.

1521
01:35:14,860 --> 01:35:18,770
Oh, okay. So I'm supposed to say something
clever. I think the moment passed.

1522
01:35:18,771 --> 01:35:21,920
I think the moment past, the moment
passed. All right, well that's great.

1523
01:35:21,921 --> 01:35:25,670
You had a nice positive [inaudible]
going to do now. Eat something healthy.

1524
01:35:27,290 --> 01:35:30,440
Okay.
Say a load of the bobcat's.

1525
01:35:32,350 --> 01:35:35,390
Uh, she hates me right now. The,

1526
01:35:35,400 --> 01:35:37,370
I thought you were going to
come over and trashed me.

1527
01:35:37,371 --> 01:35:40,460
That's your job on the podcast and I
supposed to come over and tell me you love

1528
01:35:40,461 --> 01:35:45,020
me. All right. You know something.

1529
01:35:45,170 --> 01:35:48,470
This podcast started
out with such promise,

1530
01:35:49,260 --> 01:35:53,300
kind of like Randy Moss.
You know we went 16 at, Oh,

1531
01:35:53,580 --> 01:35:58,040
here we go.
We're going to fucking undefeated season.

1532
01:35:58,490 --> 01:36:02,660
Oh fuck 18 and one. Well, whatever.

1533
01:36:02,661 --> 01:36:07,640
There's next year. Tom Brady
gets his knee blown out. Fuck.

1534
01:36:08,340 --> 01:36:12,710
All right, Tom Brady's coming back. We
get raped by the fucking ravens. Wait,

1535
01:36:12,711 --> 01:36:14,090
this is actually a patriots thing.

1536
01:36:14,170 --> 01:36:19,160
I'm starting off with Randy Moss and
then Randy starts fucking pouty with his

1537
01:36:19,161 --> 01:36:22,850
itchy God damn beard.
What a fucking moron.

1538
01:36:24,650 --> 01:36:28,580
You know, who knows? Maybe he'll become
a great analyst like he Shawn Johnson.

1539
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:32,660
Keyshawn Johnson was the greatest one I
ever saw where Tampa Bay just sent him

1540
01:36:32,661 --> 01:36:36,090
home. They didn't even try to get anything
for him. They were just like, yeah.

1541
01:36:36,550 --> 01:36:40,940
Keyshawn why don't you just
leave? Just fucking, just go home.

1542
01:36:42,650 --> 01:36:45,920
What like for the rest of the
day now for good. Just just go.

1543
01:36:46,600 --> 01:36:50,150
Then I saw him later on that night on
ESPN and he was wearing like a USC Jersey

1544
01:36:50,151 --> 01:36:54,740
and he completely could give a fuck and a,
it was just,

1545
01:36:54,741 --> 01:36:57,470
you know, but then turned out to
be a great analyst. All right,

1546
01:36:57,471 --> 01:37:00,650
let's continue with the Youtube
Shit. A loud car. Horn prank.

1547
01:37:01,850 --> 01:37:04,520
A woman's segway crash is a great one.

1548
01:37:05,720 --> 01:37:08,450
If you always wanted to punch your woman
but didn't want to go to jail for it,

1549
01:37:08,451 --> 01:37:13,010
you can at least watch one. Basically
Punch herself with the floor of a hotel.

1550
01:37:14,630 --> 01:37:19,520
Um, and gay hipster fight. That's
a great one. Gay hipster fight.

1551
01:37:19,521 --> 01:37:23,210
Evidently that's a got a ton of hits.
Uh, let's get back to the fucking,

1552
01:37:23,750 --> 01:37:26,750
let's just try and go with some topics
and maybe I can pull myself out of the

1553
01:37:26,751 --> 01:37:29,030
mud here.
Um,

1554
01:37:29,150 --> 01:37:32,150
this was called Dick at work bill.

1555
01:37:32,151 --> 01:37:35,540
I work with a hoarder on top of that.
Uh,

1556
01:37:35,541 --> 01:37:39,530
the dude seems to pride himself on saying
deuce chilling stuff that makes your

1557
01:37:39,531 --> 01:37:40,364
head shake.

1558
01:37:40,700 --> 01:37:44,630
He's also one of those guys that throws
everyone else under the bus when he's

1559
01:37:44,631 --> 01:37:47,510
called out by the manager for his mess.

1560
01:37:48,230 --> 01:37:51,110
Example of Douche chilling sayings.
The first day,

1561
01:37:52,430 --> 01:37:54,020
the first day we were
in our current office,

1562
01:37:54,021 --> 01:37:56,610
he walks up to a group of us
and sees that we're doing the,

1563
01:37:56,611 --> 01:37:59,220
getting to know you banter.
He opens up with a,

1564
01:37:59,700 --> 01:38:04,150
suppose it's story from his frat days
that ended up with him naked with,

1565
01:38:04,470 --> 01:38:06,060
with a Manet's jar.

1566
01:38:06,750 --> 01:38:07,040
Okay.

1567
01:38:07,040 --> 01:38:12,040
Jesus Christ example I like of this guy
is just really very efficient example of

1568
01:38:13,741 --> 01:38:17,830
under the bus throwing.
Yeah.

1569
01:38:19,350 --> 01:38:23,130
Commencing example of under, under the
bus throwing. All right. Here we go.

1570
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:27,360
When he was told why he has so much stuff.
MMM.

1571
01:38:27,560 --> 01:38:31,550
When he was told why he has so much stuff,
he pointed out my friends cubicle. Oh.

1572
01:38:31,551 --> 01:38:34,040
When he was asked, do you mean when he
was asked why? There's so much stuff,

1573
01:38:34,041 --> 01:38:36,170
I guess in his work area.

1574
01:38:36,870 --> 01:38:40,500
He pointed out my friends cubicle
that had a bunch of Batman stuff,

1575
01:38:40,710 --> 01:38:43,440
tastefully decorating the desk and wall.

1576
01:38:44,630 --> 01:38:48,310
Someone else had Mickey mouse
stuff, uh, in the same way,

1577
01:38:48,311 --> 01:38:52,240
which he dismissed as Disneyland.
Always one of those guys.

1578
01:38:52,270 --> 01:38:56,810
He's like Coby Bryan.
Well, Shaq rapes girls too.

1579
01:38:57,370 --> 01:39:01,700
Remember that fucking cunt.
MMM.

1580
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:05,670
To, first of all, can we get
to your friends who have, uh,

1581
01:39:05,671 --> 01:39:09,330
I can see if a female has Mickey
mouse stuff. You know what I mean?

1582
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:13,480
That's always creepy, isn't
it? You know that the,

1583
01:39:13,490 --> 01:39:15,840
the girl whose adult fully developed,

1584
01:39:15,841 --> 01:39:19,770
gone through puberty and actually has a
car payment and still act like they're

1585
01:39:19,771 --> 01:39:23,840
fucking eight years old. And uh, I
always thought that that was creepy.

1586
01:39:23,841 --> 01:39:26,900
You go and you go to hook up with them
and they have stuffed animals on their

1587
01:39:26,901 --> 01:39:30,450
baby, a Wookiee pokey,
right. And there was just,

1588
01:39:30,451 --> 01:39:34,090
you felt like a fucking pedophile.
So listen to this,

1589
01:39:34,091 --> 01:39:37,790
last week I did love line with a d um,

1590
01:39:38,290 --> 01:39:40,180
psycho Mike and Dr drew.

1591
01:39:41,100 --> 01:39:44,680
I had a great time on the show and uh,

1592
01:39:44,681 --> 01:39:47,890
I was absolutely fucking blown away.

1593
01:39:49,620 --> 01:39:50,453
Bye.

1594
01:39:51,210 --> 01:39:55,080
Just the advice Dr drew gives and how he
gets right to the root of the problem.

1595
01:39:55,081 --> 01:39:58,320
And then like his Hannibal Lecter ability,
remember the,

1596
01:39:58,321 --> 01:40:02,370
remember the fucking silence of the lambs
where he would just look at somebody's

1597
01:40:02,371 --> 01:40:05,730
shoes and could tell what the fuck
happened to them when they were like 11.

1598
01:40:06,550 --> 01:40:11,300
Like doctor drew was doing that shit.
Like some girl called up, ah fuck it.

1599
01:40:11,301 --> 01:40:14,180
I might as well tell the story. She
calls up and they're like, yeah,

1600
01:40:14,181 --> 01:40:16,700
you're on love line. You know what's
going on? And then she just say,

1601
01:40:16,780 --> 01:40:17,613
yeah,

1602
01:40:19,850 --> 01:40:24,830
it really hurts it like,
like really alien heads

1603
01:40:25,680 --> 01:40:29,640
and right off the bat he goes,
what happened to you when you were six?

1604
01:40:32,830 --> 01:40:37,830
And basically figured out that right
around that she didn't admit it.

1605
01:40:38,231 --> 01:40:40,580
She asked if she had ever been touched.
Hurry,

1606
01:40:40,581 --> 01:40:43,290
I'm laughing at fucking being molested.
I'm not laughing at this shit.

1607
01:40:43,291 --> 01:40:47,520
I was just blown away. He asked
her, he said no, and she's like,

1608
01:40:47,550 --> 01:40:52,080
I like tags. But my, my cousin Rick had
said I hadn't gotten a trial and funding

1609
01:40:52,910 --> 01:40:55,430
and asked him. I was like, how the
fuck did you do that? And it goes,

1610
01:40:55,431 --> 01:40:59,090
when I heard her, I heard a six
year old, the way she talked,

1611
01:40:59,300 --> 01:41:03,450
I heard a fucking six year
old. And sometimes when
that shit happens, you know,

1612
01:41:03,451 --> 01:41:08,070
it's so overwhelming that
they just arrested development
or something is what he

1613
01:41:08,071 --> 01:41:11,730
said.
So having seen that,

1614
01:41:12,830 --> 01:41:16,650
I mean maybe I'm now the, you know,
typical moron. That's what I do.

1615
01:41:16,651 --> 01:41:20,400
I stand next to a smart guy for 30
seconds and then try to rephrase what the

1616
01:41:20,401 --> 01:41:23,160
fuck he just said.
And I tried to appear smart myself,

1617
01:41:23,340 --> 01:41:27,850
but now there's a whole new level
of being creeped out when you know,

1618
01:41:28,030 --> 01:41:32,770
you see girls like that and uh,
yeah,

1619
01:41:33,700 --> 01:41:38,230
that was always the vibe I felt like,
can you feel like, you know those you go,

1620
01:41:38,320 --> 01:41:43,320
you go into their fucking bedroom and
it's like a little girl's room and it's

1621
01:41:44,341 --> 01:41:48,030
like, can you get that
fucking stuff off of your bed?

1622
01:41:49,510 --> 01:41:53,750
Like the whole thing is like
pink. I mean, I dunno if I,

1623
01:41:53,850 --> 01:41:55,140
if I'm just fucking,
you know,

1624
01:41:55,170 --> 01:41:57,930
just connecting dots now that
don't even fucking exist.

1625
01:41:57,931 --> 01:42:02,010
But now I'm looking back and all these
fucking, all these horrors that you see,

1626
01:42:03,290 --> 01:42:04,530
uh, on those, the, that, that,

1627
01:42:04,840 --> 01:42:08,740
that fucking old guy to playboy
mansion who have those state,

1628
01:42:08,741 --> 01:42:09,670
they walk around with that,

1629
01:42:09,720 --> 01:42:14,010
those stupid fucking high
heels with the Fuzzy Pink Shit.

1630
01:42:14,100 --> 01:42:17,860
The fur on it talking like they're,
they're little girls

1631
01:42:19,800 --> 01:42:24,710
does. Is that what that means? Ah, it's
just, it's, it's fucking beyond creepy.

1632
01:42:25,810 --> 01:42:29,400
Okay. So at this point, because
of that little moment on Loveline,

1633
01:42:29,410 --> 01:42:33,490
if I saw somebody and they had like a
bunch of Mickey Mouse Shit, I would,

1634
01:42:33,491 --> 01:42:37,650
I would first figure out if,
if I don't, I don't know,

1635
01:42:39,250 --> 01:42:42,560
like what's with the Batman
thing? Yeah. What's with that guy

1636
01:42:44,120 --> 01:42:45,300
as all this Batman stuff?

1637
01:42:45,301 --> 01:42:48,270
Did he get fucking diddled when he was
reading a comic book when he was nine?

1638
01:42:52,200 --> 01:42:57,200
So now he has this arrested development
that now he's actually fucking at work

1639
01:42:58,470 --> 01:43:03,210
any sitting in there doing this
adult job. Wow. But in his head,

1640
01:43:03,240 --> 01:43:06,660
just trying to block out the trauma
that happened in his head. He just has

1641
01:43:07,630 --> 01:43:09,090
Dan Nnn, nnn, nnn, nnn.

1642
01:43:09,220 --> 01:43:10,450
Just playing on a loop.

1643
01:43:10,660 --> 01:43:14,740
Non fucking Stop Batman.

1644
01:43:16,120 --> 01:43:19,340
You know, there's man in there, Batman,

1645
01:43:21,430 --> 01:43:25,760
Batman. That's just fucking weird
to me. Do I have anything like that?

1646
01:43:28,290 --> 01:43:32,740
I don't. Oh, there goes that fucking
theory. All right. Plowing ahead.

1647
01:43:33,430 --> 01:43:34,510
Um,
as to the hoarding,

1648
01:43:34,900 --> 01:43:39,070
his work area is ridiculous and
something of a tourist highlight.

1649
01:43:39,370 --> 01:43:43,840
And when anyone visits are, uh, are
off something of a tourist highlight.

1650
01:43:43,841 --> 01:43:46,860
When anyone visits our office,
we work in a, in a four man.

1651
01:43:46,990 --> 01:43:50,620
We work in four main areas and sets.
No one wants to sit with them.

1652
01:43:50,900 --> 01:43:55,670
He's taking the initiative to expand
his rubbish empire over the entire area.

1653
01:43:56,090 --> 01:44:00,110
The dude has a problem since our last
supervised advisor tried to make an

1654
01:44:00,111 --> 01:44:02,110
example of him by banishing him to the Er,

1655
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:06,300
to a work site with no desks and
just the locker. Lo and behold,

1656
01:44:06,450 --> 01:44:11,280
word got back to us that he started
a new nest of garbage by the lockers.

1657
01:44:11,281 --> 01:44:15,800
Why don't they just fire this
guy? Yeah, I dunno. Whatever.

1658
01:44:15,830 --> 01:44:18,860
It just keeps going on and on with this
fucking guy and he's got damn trash.

1659
01:44:19,100 --> 01:44:21,320
You know what? This reminds you
guys of a haze. Anybody at work?

1660
01:44:21,980 --> 01:44:24,950
I used to work in this
warehouse and we were,

1661
01:44:24,951 --> 01:44:28,940
we were a bunch of fucking maniacs and
all day long, all we did was break balls.

1662
01:44:30,230 --> 01:44:30,231
Um,

1663
01:44:30,231 --> 01:44:34,820
I've told you this shit before because
we were basically mentally smart enough

1664
01:44:35,440 --> 01:44:38,590
to work in a warehouse by the time you
went third grade, you know what I mean?

1665
01:44:38,950 --> 01:44:42,690
Supposed to be 10 boxes according to the
packing list. One, two, three, four, five,

1666
01:44:42,691 --> 01:44:46,710
six, seven, eight, nine, 10.
There you go. One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight,

1667
01:44:46,711 --> 01:44:51,000
nine, 10, 11, 12. Sorry,
sesame street, flashback. Um,

1668
01:44:52,440 --> 01:44:52,550
yeah.

1669
01:44:52,550 --> 01:44:56,300
So we used to fuck around all the time
and our manager had no control over us.

1670
01:44:56,630 --> 01:45:00,080
You know, we didn't respect him.
We knew he wasn't going to in fire.

1671
01:45:00,110 --> 01:45:02,300
We wasn't going to fire us.
He didn't have the goddamn heart.

1672
01:45:02,301 --> 01:45:04,160
And at the end of the day
we got a fucking job done.

1673
01:45:04,430 --> 01:45:08,060
So he decides that were the problem is,
is that we're all too fucking young.

1674
01:45:08,210 --> 01:45:09,860
There's a level of immaturity out there.

1675
01:45:10,010 --> 01:45:13,820
Cause we were all in our early twenties
that we, uh, that he should hire.

1676
01:45:14,210 --> 01:45:18,490
He hired this 38 year old guy.
MMM.

1677
01:45:19,030 --> 01:45:22,270
I actually remember his name, but I'm not
gonna, I don't name names on this shit.

1678
01:45:22,330 --> 01:45:25,480
And, uh, Jesus Christ, that
fucking guys almost 60,

1679
01:45:26,950 --> 01:45:30,490
he was like 38 and that was
22 fucking years ago. He's 60.

1680
01:45:32,100 --> 01:45:34,530
What the fuck?
So anyways,

1681
01:45:34,531 --> 01:45:39,531
this guy drove a fucking sky blue
Chevy cavalier stationwagon four door

1682
01:45:42,930 --> 01:45:47,040
barebones factory fucking rims.
The car was like three years old.

1683
01:45:47,041 --> 01:45:50,730
He had 8,000 miles on it.
All right?

1684
01:45:51,210 --> 01:45:55,300
And this guy was a Weirdo and
he had these fucking glasses,

1685
01:45:55,301 --> 01:45:58,510
these black frame glasses
that nobody wore in the 80s.

1686
01:45:59,140 --> 01:46:03,550
So we immediately started
calling him woody. We'd be, Hey,

1687
01:46:03,830 --> 01:46:07,540
what are you, uh, how many boxes we get
over there? And this guy was just bizarre.

1688
01:46:07,600 --> 01:46:10,720
And he'd come over, why call me woody?
Oh, you're trying to bring me down.

1689
01:46:11,320 --> 01:46:12,790
So he kept saying,
you're trying to bring me down.

1690
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,730
Did I already tell this fucking story?
This sounds oddly familiar to me.

1691
01:46:17,150 --> 01:46:21,020
So we would just fuck with them.
We would just be like, okay,

1692
01:46:21,021 --> 01:46:24,700
at four 31 today, everybody just
stopped going. What do you, what do you,

1693
01:46:24,701 --> 01:46:26,860
what do you, what are you in?
That's what we would do. He would be

1694
01:46:28,840 --> 01:46:30,830
picking orders down in the,

1695
01:46:30,831 --> 01:46:33,770
in the warehouse area and we would
all be picking orders with them.

1696
01:46:33,771 --> 01:46:34,910
And then out of nowhere

1697
01:46:35,720 --> 01:46:37,570
we would just start going, where do you,
what do you, what do you, what do you,

1698
01:46:37,571 --> 01:46:38,730
what do you, what do, what
do you, what are you doing

1699
01:46:38,810 --> 01:46:43,330
top of our fucking lungs.
I know it's fucking am as sophomores,

1700
01:46:44,150 --> 01:46:46,430
but it would find, and what,
we wouldn't say it to him,

1701
01:46:47,890 --> 01:46:51,390
we were just fucking be sick was really
passive aggressive cause he already

1702
01:46:51,391 --> 01:46:54,210
talked to management about us calling
him woody. So it's like, dude,

1703
01:46:54,211 --> 01:46:56,000
we're not calling you woody.
We're just going on

1704
01:46:56,020 --> 01:46:57,280
woody, woody, woody, woody, woody,

1705
01:46:57,540 --> 01:47:01,920
look in your vicinity. So we do the same
thing. You're trying to bring me down.

1706
01:47:01,980 --> 01:47:02,641
You're trying to bring me down.

1707
01:47:02,641 --> 01:47:05,790
So eventually we haze this guy so
much that he fucking quit, right?

1708
01:47:05,820 --> 01:47:09,600
He and his little Chevy Cavalier fucking
four door sky blue bare bone station

1709
01:47:09,601 --> 01:47:13,190
wagon drove right out. And the back
of my head, I was like, you know what,

1710
01:47:13,270 --> 01:47:17,890
I've got a bad feeling that mother
fuckers coming back is right,

1711
01:47:17,900 --> 01:47:20,240
right around the time when people
first started going postal.

1712
01:47:21,410 --> 01:47:25,400
So it wasn't enough that that we
actually drove this guy out of work.

1713
01:47:25,401 --> 01:47:29,900
What are they fucking maniacs I worked
with somehow got the guys home phone

1714
01:47:29,901 --> 01:47:34,901
number and the following week he still
didn't have a job and he picked up the

1715
01:47:35,321 --> 01:47:37,200
phone. He's like, hello.

1716
01:47:37,470 --> 01:47:40,080
And there was 10 of us standing
around the phone and we all go,

1717
01:47:40,500 --> 01:47:41,550
what do you, what do
you, what do you want?

1718
01:47:44,360 --> 01:47:49,020
And I always pictured him slamming the
phone down and then looking up like that

1719
01:47:49,021 --> 01:47:52,980
dude in a clockwork orange
when he realizes the dude
who came and fucking kick

1720
01:47:52,981 --> 01:47:56,880
the shit out of him and
raped his wife came back. Um,

1721
01:47:56,881 --> 01:47:58,590
that's kind of an ugly story,
isn't it?

1722
01:47:59,830 --> 01:48:00,300
Yeah.

1723
01:48:00,300 --> 01:48:00,831
You know, for, you know,

1724
01:48:00,831 --> 01:48:03,920
for as much as people sit there and they
talk about this cyber bullying and all

1725
01:48:03,921 --> 01:48:06,050
this type of shit and how
fucking horrible it is,

1726
01:48:06,980 --> 01:48:09,800
which it is obviously a,
you know,

1727
01:48:10,190 --> 01:48:12,830
I don't like how everybody tries
to act like they were a victim.

1728
01:48:15,330 --> 01:48:19,850
Well, I mean weren't you a little bit of
both? Cause I know I used to get bullied.

1729
01:48:20,790 --> 01:48:25,100
Jesus Christ walking up the street
looking like fucking that kid on the, uh,

1730
01:48:25,220 --> 01:48:28,480
the f family Griffith.
What the fuck is that?

1731
01:48:30,660 --> 01:48:35,130
The honey Andy Griffith. How did
I come up with a family? Griffith.

1732
01:48:35,770 --> 01:48:40,180
Ah, my fucking brain is
mush. Um, yeah, people,

1733
01:48:40,181 --> 01:48:42,520
you immediately came walking up
the street. My fucking might,

1734
01:48:42,530 --> 01:48:44,350
my hair was orange when I was growing up.

1735
01:48:44,500 --> 01:48:48,390
I think I didn't get the shit kicked
out of me. Yup. But then, you know,

1736
01:48:48,391 --> 01:48:51,420
I got a little bit bigger.
I've got a couple more freckles.

1737
01:48:51,421 --> 01:48:54,420
I got got some more confidence and I
just started picking on kids who were

1738
01:48:54,660 --> 01:48:55,590
younger than I was.

1739
01:48:56,370 --> 01:49:00,340
So now whenever I see
those goddamn stories,

1740
01:49:02,510 --> 01:49:07,320
mmm. I, I just, I dunno,
I, I see both sides of it.

1741
01:49:07,520 --> 01:49:09,590
I just see like, yeah, you
shouldn't have fucking done that,

1742
01:49:09,591 --> 01:49:12,260
but I don't judge the bully
because I did shit like that.

1743
01:49:14,350 --> 01:49:17,380
Now you guys didn't do shit like that.
Eh? Go fuck yourselves. All right.

1744
01:49:17,381 --> 01:49:19,740
Why don't you guys, do you know what,
that's the theme of this whole podcast.

1745
01:49:19,960 --> 01:49:21,010
Everybody can go fuck themselves.

1746
01:49:21,870 --> 01:49:24,240
That can just put me off
in such a goddamn move. A,

1747
01:49:24,241 --> 01:49:28,480
you might want to make that a
priority. Okay. Um, anyways,

1784
01:51:39,461 --> 01:51:44,461

inside and outside and then just sit there

1785
01:51:44,471 --> 01:51:48,490
and still be sad and depressed and
realize that I need to work on myself.

1786
01:51:48,520 --> 01:51:50,740
That's the goal. People,

please do not go.

1795

1796
01:52:24,701 --> 01:52:27,340
And then after that,

I had Atlanta first
Cleveland given three points.

1809
01:53:20,240 --> 01:53:23,930
It's like there's no way the browns are
going to win two weeks in a row and fuck

1810
01:53:23,931 --> 01:53:24,770
that man.
Genie,

1811
01:53:24,771 --> 01:53:29,590
that Rhett cunt who sat in the Goddamn
getaway car during the bank robbery and

1812
01:53:29,600 --> 01:53:34,220
then read it out. The guys in the
bank, that fucking rat bastard. So, uh,

1813
01:53:34,221 --> 01:53:37,910
I took Atlanta. I won that game.
Then I had two, four o'clock games.

1814
01:53:37,911 --> 01:53:42,080
I had the Tennessee titans getting
seven points. First, the cowboys,

1815
01:53:42,710 --> 01:53:47,120
right? It's my buddy Paul verse.
He says, he's told me, he goes,

1816
01:53:47,121 --> 01:53:51,470
all Vince young does is win. And I dunno,
Tony Romo just doesn't do it for me.

1817
01:53:51,471 --> 01:53:53,840
He just fails at a very high level,

1818
01:53:54,350 --> 01:53:57,380
throws for 300 5,400 yards
and they still somehow lose.

1819
01:53:57,381 --> 01:54:00,230
Although another one of my buddies
is telling me it's the play calling.

1820
01:54:00,230 --> 01:54:01,041
It's not his fault,

1821
01:54:01,041 --> 01:54:04,790
but I just felt like a seven
points was a lot of fucking points.

1822
01:54:05,270 --> 01:54:08,630
So now I'm 2.0 and I'm like,
Holy Shit,

1823
01:54:09,590 --> 01:54:13,070
I got to Goddamn San Diego
chargers getting six points first.

1824
01:54:13,071 --> 01:54:15,980
The Oakland Raiders,
I might go three you know,

1825
01:54:16,100 --> 01:54:18,800
and actually start
gambling for fucking real.

1826
01:54:20,330 --> 01:54:22,370
If I can pick them like this.
This is ridiculous.

1827
01:54:22,371 --> 01:54:24,470
So San Diego has the fucking ball.

1828
01:54:24,870 --> 01:54:28,820
They're down by one point and they're
Ron like Oakland's 10 yard line and I'm

1829
01:54:28,821 --> 01:54:32,480
just sitting there already. Got
My arms in the air. I'm like,

1830
01:54:33,050 --> 01:54:37,100
worst case scenario, they kick
a field goal. They miss it.

1831
01:54:38,150 --> 01:54:41,450
They're only down by one and Oakland's
just going to run out the clock.

1832
01:54:41,480 --> 01:54:43,880
I'm going to win this. I'm getting
six points. Either fucking way.

1833
01:54:43,881 --> 01:54:46,670
San Diego kicks the Goddamn Ball.
I'm going to win by eight.

1834
01:54:47,180 --> 01:54:48,890
They missed the field goal,
they run it out.

1835
01:54:48,950 --> 01:54:53,720
I'll still clear my bed by five
points and this is why I don't gamble.

1836
01:54:55,250 --> 01:54:58,970
Fucking Philip Rivers goes back to pass,
brings his arm back.

1837
01:54:58,971 --> 01:55:03,470
Some defense events slaps the fucking
ball out of his hand. It's a fumble.

1838
01:55:04,040 --> 01:55:09,040
Somebody from the Raiders picks the ball
up and runs like fucking 90 yards for a

1839
01:55:09,771 --> 01:55:13,640
touchdown.
And I ended up losing the Goddamn bet.

1840
01:55:13,641 --> 01:55:18,641
And I'm gonna tell you right now people
that right there is why I don't gamble.

1841
01:55:19,580 --> 01:55:20,720
That's why I don't gamble.

1842
01:55:20,721 --> 01:55:24,020
So well let me see if I would
have one even if I teased it.

1843
01:55:24,170 --> 01:55:28,970
Cause if you tease it on three teen
tease, don't you get like nine points? Um,

1844
01:55:29,300 --> 01:55:31,100
cause I would have wanted my
first week and I still think,

1845
01:55:31,101 --> 01:55:35,390
I think I would have won.
Right. Hang on one second.

1846
01:55:35,750 --> 01:55:40,550
So they ended up losing by eight points.
Yeah,

1847
01:55:40,551 --> 01:55:44,360
I would've won if I teased it.
I still want a fucking one one night.

1848
01:55:44,370 --> 01:55:47,670
Don't you get nine points on a three t
and t's I should have fucking done that

1849
01:55:47,671 --> 01:55:51,390
man. I would've won two out
of three weeks. All right,

1850
01:55:51,840 --> 01:55:53,610
I'm going to start putting
my picks up on the uh,

1851
01:55:53,611 --> 01:55:56,730
the m podcast.com so you
guys can follow along.

1852
01:55:56,731 --> 01:55:59,220
I might even ask version if we'll,
we'll put both of ours up.

1853
01:55:59,221 --> 01:56:03,630
And you can watch right now we're
both five and four for the year. Uh,

1854
01:56:03,720 --> 01:56:06,470
so I went to and one this God damn week.
And uh,

1855
01:56:06,480 --> 01:56:09,300
as far as the Monday night game tonight,
who do you like?

1856
01:56:10,260 --> 01:56:15,260
Who Do you like the jets or the Vikings?

1857
01:56:16,201 --> 01:56:18,750
I got to go with the jets.
I just think,

1858
01:56:18,751 --> 01:56:22,140
you know Brett Farve still trying
to tuck his goddamn unit away.

1859
01:56:23,910 --> 01:56:27,210
But I think Randy Moss,
I dunno,

1860
01:56:29,070 --> 01:56:32,640
I dunno. Is Reavis back, is
he back from Reavis island?

1861
01:56:33,540 --> 01:56:36,390
Fucking fag.
Randy BB.

1862
01:56:36,391 --> 01:56:40,050
Is he going to grab for
his fucking hamstring again
when fucking Randy beats him

1863
01:56:40,051 --> 01:56:43,680
again over the top when he has
no help when he's one on one.

1864
01:56:44,340 --> 01:56:47,010
That was my favorite player of
the year watching Randy Moss.

1865
01:56:47,011 --> 01:56:51,750
Just skipping down the sandy
beaches of fucking Reavis island,

1866
01:56:54,350 --> 01:56:56,730
that insecure bastard.
Who would ever come up with that

1867
01:56:58,230 --> 01:57:02,400
because you could win because when
you come to Reavis island, there's,

1868
01:57:02,520 --> 01:57:07,510
there's no way to get off unless
you have a boat. Oh, okay.

1869
01:57:07,770 --> 01:57:10,950
They are reverse. Um, anyways,

1870
01:57:10,951 --> 01:57:14,220
I think that that's the podcast
for this week. Uh, please, um,

1871
01:57:14,221 --> 01:57:17,100
if you're in the Boston area
and you want to come down, uh,

1872
01:57:17,490 --> 01:57:19,620
it helps support my brother's campaign.
That's a big thing.

1873
01:57:19,621 --> 01:57:21,420
This is a last second
date that we're adding.

1874
01:57:21,421 --> 01:57:24,660
So we're trying to hope we can get as
many people as we humanly possibly can.

1875
01:57:26,580 --> 01:57:30,750
Um, get down to the theater. And uh,
for those of you living in Chicago,

1876
01:57:30,751 --> 01:57:33,510
there's about 50 tickets left
and same thing in Minneapolis.

1877
01:57:33,511 --> 01:57:37,260
So I want to thank everybody ahead of
time for the unbelievable fucking support.

1878
01:57:38,450 --> 01:57:39,440
Uh,
isn't actually a hilarious,

1879
01:57:39,520 --> 01:57:42,330
I'm playing a theater in Minneapolis next
week and I'm not picking them against

1880
01:57:42,331 --> 01:57:45,690
the jets. Um, whatever.

1881
01:57:45,720 --> 01:57:49,630
I just want to thank all you guys for
supporting me and my comedy and a,

1882
01:57:49,760 --> 01:57:53,340
I'm going to thank the Penn state
Nittany lions for losing this week,

1883
01:57:53,341 --> 01:57:56,520
getting their fucking asses kicked because
I'm going to be at the Columbus funny

1884
01:57:56,521 --> 01:57:59,970
bone and obviously Columbus,
Ohio on 11th,

1885
01:58:00,150 --> 01:58:05,150
November 12th through the 14th and all
the Iowa state buckeyes are playing Penn

1886
01:58:05,851 --> 01:58:09,720
state and it's to be announced,
but with their two losses,

1887
01:58:09,721 --> 01:58:11,100
I think it'll be in the afternoon.

1888
01:58:11,610 --> 01:58:14,610
I think it's official at this point that
they won't be contending for anything.

1889
01:58:15,180 --> 01:58:18,450
And uh, I was really nervous that that
game was going to be at eight o'clock,

1890
01:58:18,600 --> 01:58:21,990
which would mean that a,
I don't get to go to the game and B,

1891
01:58:22,020 --> 01:58:25,560
no one will be at my show because
all be out there going, Oh,

1892
01:58:25,561 --> 01:58:30,540
h Oh mother fucker. Um, and that's it.

1893
01:58:30,541 --> 01:58:32,790
How about my Boston Bruins?
Huh? You like that shit.

1894
01:58:33,240 --> 01:58:38,240
You like that anybody can just fly to
fucking Saint Louis or Dallas and get

1895
01:58:39,241 --> 01:58:40,530
their first loss of the year.

1896
01:58:40,531 --> 01:58:45,460
It takes a team to fly all the way over
to Prague to get your fucking ass is

1897
01:58:45,461 --> 01:58:49,640
kicked to start the year
off. Right. Um, can I be,

1898
01:58:49,641 --> 01:58:53,830
explain to me why they keep doing fucking,
uh, American sports over there in,

1899
01:58:53,831 --> 01:58:56,110
in Europe.
Like they give a shit,

1900
01:58:56,111 --> 01:58:58,730
like they're going to start
buying it up like our genes. Okay.

1901
01:58:59,030 --> 01:59:03,340
Like every year the NFL does that
fucking Goddamn game in Wembley Stadium.

1902
01:59:04,770 --> 01:59:09,230
I don't, I don't, I guess it sells
out. I Dunno. But if you go over there,

1903
01:59:09,231 --> 01:59:10,510
they don't give a fuck.
They were in debt.

1904
01:59:10,660 --> 01:59:14,980
They were into soccer or their version
of football. Absolutely. Fuck it.

1905
01:59:14,981 --> 01:59:18,120
I don't know. Oh, Jesus. You know,

1906
01:59:18,150 --> 01:59:21,050
this is the greatest way to end this
fucking podcast right now with just like,

1907
01:59:21,250 --> 01:59:24,920
I came in there, you know what this, this,
this podcast is like march, you know,

1908
01:59:25,090 --> 01:59:28,690

a lamb. I'm going out like a lamb here.

1909
01:59:28,960 --> 01:59:33,310
All right. That's it. Everybody
have a great God damn week.
I hope to see you. Uh,

1910
01:59:33,760 --> 01:59:37,450
next Wednesday, October 20th at the
Wilbur Theater in Boston, Massachusetts.

1911
01:59:37,630 --> 01:59:42,400
Helped my brother out. Um, and that's it.
God bless all you. I'll talk to you next.

1912
01:59:42,480 --> 01:59:43,313
[inaudible]

1913
02:00:09,550 --> 02:00:09,550
[inaudible].
