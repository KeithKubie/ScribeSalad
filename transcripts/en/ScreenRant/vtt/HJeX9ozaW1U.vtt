knowledge on - and this time, it has a special
theme.

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:18.130
Coming up are ten questions about some of
the most well-known Disney movies - both modern

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:24.670
and classic - and only true Disney fans will

section below! Make sure you tell the truth

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:33.120
though, or we'll rain down hell on you like
a classic Disney villain!This is the latest

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.120
instalment of Screen Rant's Ultimate Movie
Quiz series - the Disney Edition.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.860
Fantasia
Fantasia remains one of Disney's most iconic

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.690
and successful movies to date but, upon its
original release, not only was it critically

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:50.010
panned, it was also unable to make any kind
of financial profit. What is the reason behind

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.680
this?
A - Parents deemed it too scary for their

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.829
children
B - World War II cut off its distribution

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.620
to the European market
C - Walt Disney himself hated it and pulled

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:07.649
it for some major tweaking
Due to the film's high production costs, and

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:12.220
the expense of leasing theatres and installing
the Fantasound equipment for the roadshow

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.049
presentations, Fantasia was unable to make
a profit without being distributed in Europe.

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:20.970
Unfortunately, upon its initial release, the
war prevented that from happening and it was

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.841
a commercial failure.
Song of the South

00:01:22.841 --> 00:01:26.979
The controversial (and now banned) Disney
movie, Song of South, was based on the popular

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.759
African-American folk tales of Uncle Remus.
James Baskett starred as the character in

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:34.299
the movie, but why couldn't he attend its
premiere?

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:37.860
A - He was ill due to complications related
to diabetes

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.830
B - He was getting married
C - It was in Atlanta, which was racially

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:48.220
segregated by law
Shockingly, the movie's main star, James Baskett,

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.290
wasn't even allowed to attend the premiere
in Atlanta, Georgia, because he was black!

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.190
No hotel in the city would give him a room
because of the racial segregation laws that

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.502
were in practise at the time.
The Sword in the Stone

00:02:00.502 --> 00:02:04.740
The Sword in the Stone is a Disney movie based
around Arthurian legend and features characters

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.079
from said legend like King Arthur, Merlin
and Sir Ector. But the character of Arthur

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:13.730
in the movie was weirdly inconsistent throughout.
In what way was this the case?

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.799
A - A number of different artists drew him,
making his appearance change throughout

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:20.859
B - More than one voice actor portrayed him
in the movie

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:26.190
C - The colour of his hair kept changing
Arthur was actually voiced by three different

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.640
young actors in the movie - Rickie Sorensen,
Richard Reitherman and Robert Reitherman.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.010
The changes are extremely noticeable, as Arthur's
voice keeps alternating from being broken

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.900
to unbroken, sometimes in the same scene.
Bedknobs and Broomsticks

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.140
In Bedknobs and Broomsticks, the character
of Carrie - played by Cindy O'Callaghan - admires

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.630
a selection of dolls in the nursery of Professor
Brown's house. What were some of these dolls

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.329
modelled after?
A - Barbie and her friends

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:51.949
B - The puppets in Disney's "Small World"
ride

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:56.620
C - Russian nesting dolls
Several of the dolls that Carrie takes an

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.519
interest in, in the nursery of Professor Brown's
house, are modelled after the international

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:04.350
puppets in the Small World ride that can be
found at various Disney theme parks around

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.570
the world.
Robin Hood

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:10.799
In Disney's 1973 animated adaptation of Robin
Hood, the character of Friar Tuck - voiced

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:15.320
by Andy Devine - was depicted as a badger.
But what animal was the character originally

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.479
intended to be depicted as?
A - A pig

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:20.630
B - A mole
C - A rooster

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.919
Originally, the character of Friar Tuck in
this adaptation of Robin Hood was going to

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:31.190
be a pig, but it was changed to being a badger
to avoid insulting certain religious sensibilities.

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.380
Pocahontas
Pocahontas featured an impressive voice cast

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:39.010
that included the likes of Irene Bedard, Mel
Gibson, Christian Bale, Billy Connolly and

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:44.790
Frank Welker. It also initially included an
actor who died in 1994, whose role sadly had

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.630
to be scrapped as a result. Which late actor
was that?

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.880
A - John Candy
B - Telly Savalas

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:57.290
C - Peter Cushing
The late, great John Candy had actually provided

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:02.109
a large amount of voice work for a turkey
character named "Redfeather", who would have

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:06.769
been Pocahontas' sidekick. However, after
his tragic death from a heart attack, the

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:08.510
role was scrapped.
Toy Story

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.369
In Disney Pixar's modern classic Toy Story,
the two main characters - Woody and Buzz Lightyear

00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:18.290
- were inspired by director John Lasseter's
own childhood toys. But which specific toys

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.630
from his childhood were they inspired by?
A - A Jack-in-the-Box and Batman

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:28.840
B - A Bozo the Clown doll and Action Man
C - A Casper doll and G.I. Joe

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.910
Woody and Buzz Lightyear were actually inspired
by Lasseter's pull-string Casper doll and

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.591
his G.I. Joe figures. Once he grew out of
his Casper, he moved onto G.I. Joe, which

00:04:37.591 --> 00:04:43.510
was a very flashy toy at the time of his childhood.
Frozen

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:48.030
During the early developmental stage of 2013's
Frozen, the character of Elsa was actually

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.190
meant to be the villain of the movie. When
that was still the case, do you know which

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.530
famous actress the design of Elsa was going
to be inspired by?

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.160
A - Glenn Close
B - Meryl Streep

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.750
C - Bette Midler
That's right - at the stage of Frozen's development

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.260
when Elsa was still meant to be the villain
of the film, the design of the character was

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.380
actually inspired by none other than Bette
Midler.

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.090
Finding Dory
Every major Disney and Pixar character has

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.280
their own official Facebook page, but Finding
Dory's main character - the titular Dory - has

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.380
the most "likes" out of any of them, thanks
to the movie's massive success. How many likes

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:19.530
does she actually have?
A - 15 million

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:23.710
B - 20 million
C - 25 million

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:28.250
With a whopping 25 million likes on her official
page, Dory is the most liked character on

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:32.410
Facebook from any Disney or Pixar film - which
is pretty impressive, considering the strong

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:34.890
competition she has.
Beauty and the Beast

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:39.120
2017's live action adaptation of Beauty and
the Beast will feature all the classic characters,

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.350
including Belle, the Beast and Gaston. But
it will also feature some new ones. Stanley

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:47.180
Tucci, for example, will play a talking grand
piano. What will his name be?

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.390
A - Cadenza
B - Timbre

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:53.960
C - Overture
Back in 2015, it was announced that the brilliant

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:58.490
Stanley Tucci would be playing Cadenza, a
grand piano, and an original character created

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:02.430
specifically for this new live action version
of Beauty and the Beast.

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:06.590
