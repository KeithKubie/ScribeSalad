[MUSIC "BILL NYE THE SCIENCE GUY
 THEME SONG"]

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.710
BILL NYE: Love that song.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:14.210
Yes.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:21.420
Can we use these?

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.781
Is this OK?

00:00:22.781 --> 00:00:23.780
VIKRAM BAJAJ: I hope so.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:24.700
BILL NYE: Let's hope they work.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.150
There's a lot of
gravity up here.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:27.320
I can feel it.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.970
Look at this guy on
the picture, man.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.776
He will mess you up.

00:00:31.776 --> 00:00:34.110
Wow.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.830
It's big.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.370
It's the big picture.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.000
Yes, Vik, greetings.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.880
VIKRAM BAJAJ: Very
nice to meet you.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.510
So I'd like to
begin by taking you

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.090
through some really depressing
slides, if you don't mind.

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:47.310
I'm sorry about this.

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:51.680
BILL NYE: Yeah, that'd be great,
because I was really upbeat.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.164
Let's knock that down.

00:00:53.164 --> 00:00:54.580
VIKRAM BAJAJ: Click
through these.

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:58.270
BILL NYE: Oh, yeah.

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.000
Oh, yeah.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.580
VIKRAM BAJAJ: So
we're very concerned

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.559
about public perceptions
of science, as are you.

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.350
And there's some really
depressing numbers.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.100
I'm just going to go
through them rapidly.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.370
So first of all, only
40-some percent of Americans

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.850
right now believe
that global warming

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.354
is caused by human activity.

00:01:16.354 --> 00:01:18.020
BILL NYE: Less than
half is our problem.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.440
VIKRAM BAJAJ: Less than half.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.140
BILL NYE: When it comes to
elections, that's a big deal.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.130
VIKRAM BAJAJ: Oh.

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.120
BILL NYE: No, it is.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.370
That's what I'm talking about.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.350
VIKRAM BAJAJ: And as
a consequence of that,

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.080
very few people actually
believe that this is a problem

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.760
that we'll face
in our lifetimes.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:31.945
And--

00:01:31.945 --> 00:01:34.240
BILL NYE: Oh, you'll see.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.115
Yeah.

00:01:35.115 --> 00:01:35.865
VIKRAM BAJAJ: So--

00:01:35.865 --> 00:01:37.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.130
BILL NYE: No, I mean,
it's a big deal.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.590
VIKRAM BAJAJ: In the
case of human evolution,

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.220
we also have a similar problem.

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.140
Only 19% of Americans,
according to Gallup,

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.630
believe in the unfettered
human evolution

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.910
driven by natural physical laws.

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.610
There's about 30% who
believe in something called

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.030
intelligent design, and
about a constant number

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.530
who believe that
we were all created

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.150
6,000 years ago, in an instant.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.840
And another consequence
of this is really

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.900
how it's being
taught in schools.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.120
Here in red, you
see all the states

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.960
where there is no mention
of human evolution

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.650
in the formal school curricula.

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.670
Some mention biological
evolution, but not

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.115
human evolution, not
evolution of mankind.

00:02:24.115 --> 00:02:24.615
And--

00:02:24.615 --> 00:02:25.823
BILL NYE: He means humankind.

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.700
No, I mean, it's
just a new habit.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.100
For example, my mom was a
woman, just for example.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.920
She's right there.

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:44.000
It's not unusual.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.305
No.

00:02:46.305 --> 00:02:50.910
VIKRAM BAJAJ: But we'll ask
you about her later, actually.

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.600
So there's also a
depressing trend

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.680
to use public taxpayer
money, taxpayer dollars,

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.260
to fund creation education
in public schools

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.200
in several states, in charter
schools, in voucher schools.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.240
And of course, there are
mainstream politicians

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.890
who don't believe
in this at all.

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.057
Now--

00:03:09.057 --> 00:03:10.890
BILL NYE: You have the
picture of the guys--

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.570
how many of you running for
president believe in evolution?

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:15.710
Three of them don't.

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:16.460
VIKRAM BAJAJ: Yes.

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:17.090
BILL NYE: Can you imagine--

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.298
VIKRAM BAJAJ: Three of the
four Republican governors.

00:03:19.298 --> 00:03:23.069
BILL NYE: --if these guys
got to be in charge-- well,

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:23.860
they are in charge.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:24.610
They're governors.

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:29.570
The most technically
advanced-- at least

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.459
the biggest innovations, like
Google, come out of the US.

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.000
And to have people
that don't believe

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.950
in the process of
science running the show

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.579
is just a formula for disaster.

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:40.620
VIKRAM BAJAJ: Absolutely.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:41.880
BILL NYE: It is.

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.570
VIKRAM BAJAJ: So Google
is a scientific company.

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.420
We're very science
driven, quantitative.

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.650
And this is particularly
depressing to us.

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.204
Here's belief in evolution--

00:03:53.204 --> 00:03:54.578
BILL NYE: Oh,
gosh, look at this.

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.610
VIKRAM BAJAJ: And I know that
some of your recent criticism

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.790
of pseudo science,
in general, really

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.680
is based on arguments of
economic competitiveness.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.500
BILL NYE: For me, it is, yeah.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.300
Like you guys-- how many of you
watch "The Science Guy" show?

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:16.486
AUDIENCE: [CHEERING]

00:04:16.486 --> 00:04:19.066
BILL NYE: I love
you, man, woman.

00:04:19.066 --> 00:04:23.820
No, so if we produce a
generation of science students

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.820
that don't believe
in science, you're

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.319
not going to have the next
Google, whatever that is.

00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:30.860
You will not have
the next generation

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.750
of employees at Google.

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.360
Texas Instruments had to
advertise for, I guess,

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.970
engineers in Maryland,
because they were concerned--

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.685
Texas Instruments is not called
Maryland Instruments-- because

00:04:44.685 --> 00:04:49.405
of the quality of the Maryland
school system in comparison.

00:04:49.405 --> 00:04:50.740
VIKRAM BAJAJ: Absolutely.

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.944
So hopefully, you'll
help us, you'll arm us--

00:04:52.944 --> 00:04:53.860
BILL NYE: It's all me.

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:54.360
Yeah.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.520
VIKRAM BAJAJ: with
instruments to fight this,

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.290
because our reaction
in observing this

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:02.320
is to be pretty depressed.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.360
We don't know how exactly
to counteract these forces.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:06.930
We hope you'll
teach us about that.

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.940
Maybe, actually, this
would be more appropriate,

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.520
considering the subject
of our conversation today.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.270
BILL NYE: For those
of you who don't know,

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:18.360
that's my old boss there.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.850
VIKRAM BAJAJ: So
let's begin there.

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:25.270
We can remove our
friend from the screen.

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.610
BILL NYE: That's not
really my old boss.

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:31.360
It's a guy I used
to sit next to.

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.870
VIKRAM BAJAJ: So my first
question is really an easy one.

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:35.240
You've seen the numbers.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.810
Now, you're a science educator.

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:37.970
I'm a scientist.

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:40.690
Are those dismal
numbers a failure

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:42.180
of my profession or yours?

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:43.260
BILL NYE: Oh, it's me.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.850
It's all me.

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:48.860
What's happened in the
US is the people teaching

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:52.790
or asked to teach science
are not especially qualified

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:55.819
to teach it, because the
money's just not very good.

00:05:55.819 --> 00:05:57.360
If you come out of
engineering school

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.320
and you can get a job making
what you guys make here

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.290
or get a job making a third
of that going to a facility

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:08.250
where the paint's peeling
and it smells like urine

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:13.170
and some people literally
are carrying weapons,

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:13.970
what would you do?

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:17.340
I mean, if I were
king of the forest.

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:18.650
And I'm not.

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:21.440
But the longest journey
starts with a single step.

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.750
So our first problem is
educating science educators.

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:29.449
But if you have school
boards-- in other words,

00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:30.990
we have to do
everything all at once.

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:34.430
If you have school boards who
are insisting that creationism

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:40.659
be put in textbooks, then
that's a hard row to hoe.

00:06:40.659 --> 00:06:41.450
VIKRAM BAJAJ: Yeah.

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:42.864
BILL NYE: But
we've got to do it.

00:06:42.864 --> 00:06:44.280
VIKRAM BAJAJ: Well,
to what extent

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:47.319
is this actually a uniquely
American phenomenon?

00:06:47.319 --> 00:06:48.860
Has this happened
in other countries?

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:50.520
BILL NYE: Doesn't seem to.

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:55.560
And you can see on that
gross domestic product chart,

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:59.980
or handwritten graph-- no,
really, whatever you call it.

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:02.020
The thing.

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:03.420
How do we use the word "chart?"

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:04.130
It's a graph.

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:05.520
It's a depiction.

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:08.694
You see that industrialized
countries, in general,

00:07:08.694 --> 00:07:10.110
believe in the
process of science,

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:12.359
and evolution is the main
idea in all of life science,

00:07:12.359 --> 00:07:14.540
so they believe in that, too.

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:17.100
But as I say, evolution
is not something

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:19.720
you can choose
not to believe in.

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:24.330
I mean, this gets to
be sarcastic and weird.

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:28.675
You can choose not to believe
in gravity for a few moments.

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:36.510
But you'll see pretty quickly,
if you jump off a building,

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:40.266
you'll see right away,
you're headed for trouble.

00:07:40.266 --> 00:07:41.140
VIKRAM BAJAJ: Indeed.

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:42.598
BILL NYE: It's not
the fall, right?

00:07:42.598 --> 00:07:44.442
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

00:07:44.442 --> 00:07:46.120
It's the sudden stop.

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:50.310
VIKRAM BAJAJ: So let's
get into the topic

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:52.620
of your book a little bit now.

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:54.360
So you wrote this book--

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:56.500
BILL NYE: No, I'm
really proud of it, man.

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:58.833
VIKRAM BAJAJ: --partly to
address that problem, I think.

00:07:58.833 --> 00:07:59.830
But who's the audience?

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:00.650
Who do you want to read this--

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:02.275
BILL NYE: Everybody
in the whole world.

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:07.675
So I'll tell the story.

00:08:07.675 --> 00:08:11.540
It's not very long,
thank goodness.

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:16.250
So my friends call
me Shiny Object Man.

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:18.040
It's a little bit of a problem.

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.970
So when you go to sit down
to write a book that's

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:25.130
going to have 100,000 words
or something in a row,

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:26.590
you have to be disciplined.

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:29.740
So I was looking for
an editor to help me.

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:32.470
And the guy I came across
through mutual acquaintances

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:35.880
in the business, a guy
named Corey Powell.

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:36.860
And he's a cool guy.

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:38.790
He was editor of
"Discover Magazine"

00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:42.140
and contributes to
"Scientific American."

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:44.720
He also contributes
to another magazine

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:47.790
you may not know called
"American Scientist."

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:51.400
And he said, what we've
got to do is bottle,

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:55.000
bottle what you talk about,
and put it in a book.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.840
And that worked out really well.

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:00.220
But when he was trying
to decide whether or not

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:03.490
to work with Shiny
Object Man over dinner,

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:05.690
he asked me why I
was writing the book,

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:10.920
because according to him-- and
when I watch other television

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:14.520
shows, people write
books just for the sake

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:16.505
of having written a book.

00:09:16.505 --> 00:09:18.380
But he asked me, why
did you write this book?

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:20.336
And I told him I want
to change the world.

00:09:20.336 --> 00:09:21.460
I want to change the world.

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:22.940
Is that so wrong?

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:24.810
And that's when he
decided to get on board.

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:26.550
So I wrote it for everybody.

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:29.950
And I wrote it in English,
as that's my native tongue.

00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:31.110
No, I mean, really.

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:37.980
And I wrote it in this way that
involves me telling stories

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:41.840
or anecdotes or
my point of view.

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:43.590
And there's a reason for that.

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:48.660
First of all, it sounds like me,
which appeals to some people.

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:50.860
And then the other
thing is, I remember

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:53.125
the time I met Ivan the gorilla.

00:09:53.125 --> 00:09:54.520
No, you don't.

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:55.190
Yeah, I do.

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:56.760
Yes, I do remember.

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:59.730
And so when you talk
about how you feel,

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:01.475
people can't disagree with that.

00:10:01.475 --> 00:10:06.160
VIKRAM BAJAJ: So I think
the entrenched opponents

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:09.610
to your worldview, which is
the evolutionary worldview,

00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:12.500
the worldview that also
believes in gravity--

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:13.800
BILL NYE: Yeah.

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:16.360
VIKRAM BAJAJ: --they may not be
your customers for this book.

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:18.860
But certainly,
people like us, who

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:22.040
may have occasion to
persuade some of them,

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:24.170
can really benefit
from reading it.

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:25.600
BILL NYE: Well,
the other thing is

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:32.160
people who are anxious about
it, who are troubled by the idea

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:36.120
that we are all descendant
from species that

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:38.470
came before-- 90% of
everything that's ever lived

00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:42.340
has disappeared-- people
who are troubled by that,

00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:44.640
I hope they read
the book, because I

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:46.060
think it's empowering.

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:48.900
And the process of evolution
fills me with reverence.

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:52.070
I mean, my goodness.

00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:58.980
Just to drop another name, I
had astronomy from Carl Sagan.

00:10:58.980 --> 00:10:59.480
And--

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:01.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:04.430
I did.

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:07.100
Look, you guys, I was just some
guy in the back of the room.

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:09.558
"The Solar System"-- that was
the name of the course, still

00:11:09.558 --> 00:11:11.160
is the name of course.

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:12.930
And I was in the
back of the room.

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:15.140
I did OK.

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:15.670
No, I did.

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:17.086
I was not, like,
the star student.

00:11:17.086 --> 00:11:19.090
I did OK.

00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:23.010
But he was the guy who
really imbued in me,

00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:25.130
or gave me the
fundamental understanding

00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:28.750
that, since you and I
are made of exploded

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:34.830
stars, the dust of exploded
stars, you and I, all of us,

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:39.180
are somehow at least one
way that the universe has

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:41.980
come to know itself.

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:44.730
And that is amazing.

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:46.190
That is amazing.

00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:49.920
And every day, it fills
me with reverence.

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:55.614
And maybe more to the point,
it, like, freaks me out.

00:11:55.614 --> 00:11:57.780
VIKRAM BAJAJ: So your choice
of the word "reverence"

00:11:57.780 --> 00:11:58.980
is interesting.

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:02.190
You debated, in
February, I think,

00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:07.410
Ken Ham, the noted, or
infamous, creationist.

00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:10.640
Did your arguments fill
him with reverence?

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:17.170
BILL NYE: Well, I would like
to think that I lit a spark.

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:20.480
And keep in mind, everybody,
that in that debate,

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:22.720
in that room, I was
not going to convince

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:24.430
Ken Ham-- how many
people saw it?

00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:25.230
Anybody saw it?

00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:26.200
Wow, look at you guys.

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:29.580
I love you, man, woman.

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:34.150
I was not going to change his
mind in two and a half hours.

00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:37.880
He's made a career, he's
made quite a living,

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:43.610
on this idea that the
Earth is 6,000 years old.

00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:47.190
But my audience was you
all, was people online.

00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:51.030
And I've met many, many science
teachers the last few months

00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:54.850
who told me that they
use the debate in class.

00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:56.760
And that's pretty cool.

00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:00.250
I mean, that's
reaching somebody.

00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:03.510
So what I always
say, many of you

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:06.975
probably know or have family
members who are creationists,

00:13:06.975 --> 00:13:08.600
or if they're not
creationists, they're

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:13.200
deeply troubled by the
idea that we are descendant

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:18.940
from somebody who is not human.

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:24.974
Even, again, on old boss joke
could be put right there.

00:13:24.974 --> 00:13:26.640
Some people are deeply
troubled by that.

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:29.730
You're not going to change
their minds in one sitting.

00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:31.420
It's a process.

00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:33.247
So I hope this book
is part of that.

00:13:33.247 --> 00:13:35.080
VIKRAM BAJAJ: Well,
let's get into the book,

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:37.310
since the book began
in that debate.

00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:42.998
Perhaps you can start by taking
us back to the 1830s, where--

00:13:42.998 --> 00:13:44.453
BILL NYE: Ah, yes.

00:13:44.453 --> 00:13:45.953
VIKRAM BAJAJ: Not
literally, please.

00:13:45.953 --> 00:13:49.965
BILL NYE: Vik, I wasn't there.

00:13:49.965 --> 00:13:50.815
VIKRAM BAJAJ: No.

00:13:50.815 --> 00:13:51.990
But you wrote about it--

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:52.570
BILL NYE: Yeah, yeah.

00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:53.100
VIKRAM BAJAJ: --recently.

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:55.610
BILL NYE: But by the way,
Ken Ham, one of his things

00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:59.000
is historical science and
observational science.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:13:59.750
VIKRAM BAJAJ: Yes.

00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:01.400
BILL NYE: So if you weren't
there to observe it,

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:02.030
it doesn't count.

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:02.790
VIKRAM BAJAJ: All bets are off.

00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:03.810
BILL NYE: Yeah.

00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:09.570
So I'm like, dude, have you
ever seen "CSI-- Louisville?"

00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:11.470
Or do they have that now?

00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:12.800
They probably do.

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:14.500
Is there a Louisville,
Kentucky, CSI?

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:15.020
I think so.

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:16.650
I think there is.

00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:18.306
There's so many.

00:14:18.306 --> 00:14:20.365
I know Fargo is coming.

00:14:20.365 --> 00:14:21.240
But you were saying--

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:24.990
VIKRAM BAJAJ: So that's exactly
the most interesting point.

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:28.820
How could Darwin, just with his
collection of observations from

00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:31.787
a five-year voyage, without
the benefit of Illumina--

00:14:31.787 --> 00:14:32.370
BILL NYE: DNA.

00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:33.710
He knew nothing of DNA.

00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:34.030
VIKRAM BAJAJ: Exactly.

00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:34.560
Yes.

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:37.510
How could he have come up
with such a far-ranging theory

00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:40.270
of such predictive value?

00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:42.620
BILL NYE: He was thoughtful.

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:45.890
And what's striking is, as so
many people have commented,

00:14:45.890 --> 00:14:48.820
why didn't anybody else
think of it before?

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:52.480
And it shows you how
many-- or notice it

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:55.370
before-- how many
expectations must

00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:59.450
be built into each of us,
how many assumptions we make

00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:01.610
about the universe
and our relationship

00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:03.360
to it, the cosmos
and our relationship

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:07.650
to it, that are just wrong,
and we don't even know it.

00:15:07.650 --> 00:15:13.210
But I did tell the story,
my grandmother lived in,

00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:15.630
looking back, a pretty big
house in Washington, DC.

00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:17.340
It had three bedrooms,
which at that time

00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:18.980
is a pretty big house.

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:23.790
And so she had boarders,
people who would rent rooms,

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:28.006
after my uncle and my
dad left the house.

00:15:28.006 --> 00:15:29.380
And there was some
guy that would

00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:32.860
sit at the dinner table
talking about chicken bones.

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:35.200
And "look how the knee is
just like the human knee,

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:35.950
but it's reversed.

00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:36.700
And isn't this cool?

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:37.825
And look at this cartilage.

00:15:37.825 --> 00:15:39.210
It's just like human cartilage."

00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:41.890
And my grandmother, who was
quite the naturalist-- she

00:15:41.890 --> 00:15:43.870
would collect wild
flowers; she was really

00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:45.960
something-- thought
that was cool.

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:49.200
But my grandfather was somehow
deeply troubled by this.

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:54.400
He went to church and stuff
in a very traditional way.

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:57.310
But even this guy noticed
these connections.

00:15:57.310 --> 00:15:59.880
Why didn't anybody else notice
these connections before?

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:01.780
It was really quite a thing.

00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:03.880
And Darwin realized,
apparently--

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:05.960
I'm not an expert on
Darwin-- but he apparently

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:12.130
spent a lot of time making sure
he had everything worked out.

00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:15.439
I don't know if you've ever
read "The Origin of Species

00:16:15.439 --> 00:16:16.730
by Means of Natural Selection."

00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:21.910
But he did all these
experiments with roses and bees

00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:27.430
and barnacles-- he was just
really into it-- to make sure

00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:30.170
what he was observing, his
hypothesis, was correct.

00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:34.340
And then this guy Russel
Wallace-- and there's

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:37.110
a whole bunch of people, and
I'm right there with you,

00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:40.372
who celebrate Russel Wallace,
as he came up with the same idea

00:16:40.372 --> 00:16:41.080
at the same time.

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:43.140
And why isn't there a
Russel Wallace Society,

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:45.220
and when will we have
Russel Wallace day,

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:47.350
and why isn't Russell
Wallace on our dollar bills?

00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:49.190
OK.

00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:52.080
He was 16 years
younger than Darwin.

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:54.730
Darwin had a little
head start on him.

00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:59.070
And Darwin's book, where
he's got both the hypothesis,

00:16:59.070 --> 00:17:01.550
or the theory, of evolution
and the experiments

00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:03.170
backing it up in one volume.

00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:06.045
That's way Darwin's name
is so closely tied--

00:17:06.045 --> 00:17:08.420
VIKRAM BAJAJ: And it's a very
accessible book even today.

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:09.045
BILL NYE: Yeah.

00:17:09.045 --> 00:17:11.810
Even now, it's very readable.

00:17:11.810 --> 00:17:14.099
VIKRAM BAJAJ: Well, why
isn't Darwin on any currency?

00:17:14.099 --> 00:17:15.599
BILL NYE: Well,
he is in Britain.

00:17:15.599 --> 00:17:16.829
VIKRAM BAJAJ: Is he?

00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:21.180
BILL NYE: Darwin's on
dollar-- on dollar bills--

00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:23.951
on bills in Britain.

00:17:23.951 --> 00:17:25.200
VIKRAM BAJAJ: Oh, interesting.

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:27.190
So can you take us
through some of the more

00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:29.650
contemporary evidence
for Darwin's theories?

00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:31.910
Let's start with geology
and the fossil record.

00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:33.618
I know you do this
very well in the book.

00:17:33.618 --> 00:17:38.430
BILL NYE: Well, you guys, I went
to school in Ithaca, New York.

00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:40.510
And you can walk
around in Ithaca--

00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:43.930
you don't have to be any
sort of amazing geology guy--

00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:47.700
and you can find trilobite
fossils, zillions of them.

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:51.120
Trilobites lived something
like 238 million years--

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:55.520
way longer than humans have been
on Earth by a factor of 100,

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:59.124
I guess-- factor of 100,
not 100, a factor of 100.

00:17:59.124 --> 00:18:00.540
And so you find
all those fossils.

00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:03.630
Well, how'd they all get
there, for crying out loud?

00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:05.450
And then Darwin
wrestled with this.

00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:09.910
And how does a new species
come into existence?

00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:13.142
And it's just a cool story.

00:18:13.142 --> 00:18:15.600
I don't know if you know about
the mosquitoes in the London

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:18.220
Underground, the Tube.

00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:21.215
So apparently, the mosquitoes
were living in the underground

00:18:21.215 --> 00:18:24.070
when they dug all these
tunnels in the late 1800s.

00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:25.980
There were mosquitoes
living down there.

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:29.797
And they would feed on
people like you and me.

00:18:29.797 --> 00:18:32.130
And they would generally-- I
mean, if you're a mosquito,

00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:34.440
you feed on a few people, and
then they close the subway, you

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:36.850
go back upstairs at night and
feed on some other people.

00:18:36.850 --> 00:18:40.300
But then, when World
War II came along,

00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:45.449
they used the underground
stations as bomb shelters.

00:18:45.449 --> 00:18:46.490
And it's quite effective.

00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:50.540
I mean, getting
bombed kind of sucks.

00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:51.740
But it was quite effective.

00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:58.850
But this really accelerated
the certain mosquitoes.

00:18:58.850 --> 00:19:01.790
Pipiens has become molestus.

00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:05.300
The mosquitoes that
buzzes, pipien,

00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:08.420
has become the
mosquito that annoys.

00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:10.780
So there's apparently
a new species

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:15.640
of mosquito evolving in the
London Underground right now.

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:19.060
And furthermore, you
can see the spectrum.

00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:21.920
Most of the underground
mosquitoes cannot breed with

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:22.670
the above grounds.

00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:26.960
So the pipiens cannot
breed with the molestus.

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:30.400
But there are a
few that still can.

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:34.210
Like you can see that there's
a spectrum of this new species

00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:35.960
coming into existence,
like in real time,

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:38.800
like in one person's lifetime.

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:40.480
And that's amazing.

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:41.150
That's amazing.

00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:44.850
It's not surprising,
really, but it's amazing.

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:47.809
VIKRAM BAJAJ: So what connects
these contemporary examples

00:19:47.809 --> 00:19:50.100
of speciation-- and there
are a couple that you go over

00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:52.990
in your book,
including evolution

00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:55.280
of antibiotic resistance
and other things short

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:56.960
of speciation--
what connects that

00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:58.990
with this historical
fossil record?

00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:00.750
Is it DNA evidence?

00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:02.747
How do you know how
old the fossils are?

00:20:02.747 --> 00:20:03.580
BILL NYE: Oh, I see.

00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:07.470
Well, yeah, how many people
have not taken geology?

00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:08.720
I don't know you guys.

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:11.040
I don't know how you live.

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:14.290
I don't know anything
about your habits.

00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:19.080
But you'll find that the older
dirty clothes that you've

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:24.210
discarded on the floor are
underneath the more recent

00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:24.975
dirty clothes.

00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:36.920
And the same is true in geology
with respect to sediments

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:38.159
and overlays and so on.

00:20:38.159 --> 00:20:39.950
And I'm not the world's
foremost geologist,

00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:42.241
but I can tell you the stuff
at the bottom of the Grand

00:20:42.241 --> 00:20:45.570
Canyon's older than
the stuff at the top.

00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:48.510
I don't make the
rules, as we say.

00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:53.350
The other just amazing thing
that was sort of discovered,

00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:58.140
really, in my father's lifetime,
my grandfather's lifetime,

00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:01.204
is radioactivity and how
you can work backwards.

00:21:01.204 --> 00:21:03.120
And people throw out the
word "carbon dating."

00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:04.786
Carbon dating, it's
fine, but that's not

00:21:04.786 --> 00:21:05.990
what we're talking about.

00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:08.610
Carbon dating is good on, like,
tens of thousands of years.

00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:11.930
Radiometric dating,
where you have-- I mean,

00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:14.710
who doesn't love
rubidium and strontium?

00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:17.460
These are elements
that are out there.

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:19.250
And they're radioactive.

00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:21.410
And I like that
one in many ways.

00:21:21.410 --> 00:21:26.160
First of all, its half-life
of rubidium becoming strontium

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:32.520
is 48.8 billion years--
b-- billion years.

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:37.650
And it's a case where one
of the neutrons in rubidium

00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:38.950
becomes a proton.

00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:41.640
It goes up the periodic table,
giving off some electrons

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:42.400
and neutrinos.

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:45.330
Who wouldn't?

00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:48.500
And so then these
things are chemically

00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:52.660
in the same column on the
periodic table as calcium

00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:56.270
and sodium so that, in
the melt, as these guys

00:21:56.270 --> 00:21:58.050
love-- who doesn't
love the melt?

00:21:58.050 --> 00:22:00.050
The melt-- you're talking
about molten rocks.

00:22:00.050 --> 00:22:02.141
You're talking about
Hawaii or someplace.

00:22:02.141 --> 00:22:03.390
These things are all mixed in.

00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:06.320
But once they freeze,
once it cools off,

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:09.620
then, chemically,
some of the rubidium,

00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:11.120
some of the
strontium, is replaced

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:14.780
by some of the sodium,
some of the calcium.

00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:17.120
And then you can work
this clock backwards.

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:19.510
This is amazing, It's amazing.

00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:22.530
And that was discovered
long after Darwin's writing

00:22:22.530 --> 00:22:23.890
this book.

00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:26.430
I mean, it's just cool.

00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:28.360
Just think what else
we just don't know

00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:31.280
anything about, right
under our noses.

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:31.780
Wow.

00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:33.780
VIKRAM BAJAJ: Of course,
to believe in that, you

00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:34.630
have to believe in--

00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:34.890
BILL NYE: Everything.

00:22:34.890 --> 00:22:36.265
VIKRAM BAJAJ:
--the inviolability

00:22:36.265 --> 00:22:40.740
of physical laws, which,
as we saw in your debate,

00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:42.074
that's not always been the case.

00:22:42.074 --> 00:22:42.698
BILL NYE: Yeah.

00:22:42.698 --> 00:22:44.180
So one of the
extraordinary claims

00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:46.660
this guy makes,
these people make,

00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:49.290
is that physical
laws are mutable,

00:22:49.290 --> 00:22:50.840
you can just change them.

00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:54.260
Super-guy shows up and
goes, the speed of light,

00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:58.780
I'm going to quintuple it for
awhile, without telling anyone.

00:22:58.780 --> 00:22:59.640
It's unreasonable.

00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:02.120
And this wouldn't
matter, Vik, would not

00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:05.240
matter-- this guy can spend
his millions of dollars

00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:09.060
and build his thing and
run around doing his stuff.

00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:12.940
But they have this
enormous program

00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:17.720
to indoctrinate kids,
people in kindergarten,

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:19.360
that the Earth is
6,000 years old

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:23.090
and all these things on how
to defend your otherwise

00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:25.810
completely unreasonable
belief and so on.

00:23:25.810 --> 00:23:28.300
And that's what's
really troubling.

00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:29.240
VIKRAM BAJAJ: I agree.

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:32.540
So tell us a bit-- and you
outlined this in your book

00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:35.630
in greater detail-- about the
parallel line of evidence from

00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:38.720
modern DNA sequencing methods
that also establishes--

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:39.780
BILL NYE: Oh, yeah.

00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:39.910
VIKRAM BAJAJ: --age of life.

00:23:39.910 --> 00:23:40.868
BILL NYE: It's amazing.

00:23:40.868 --> 00:23:44.504
So you guys, there's mutations
that happen natural-- I mean,

00:23:44.504 --> 00:23:45.920
every time you try
to make a copy,

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:47.600
there's going to be a change.

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:49.250
Sometimes, the change
is significant.

00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:50.374
Most of the time, it's not.

00:23:50.374 --> 00:23:52.890
It's just in the-- what
do you guys call it?

00:23:52.890 --> 00:23:56.220
Healthy software?

00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:57.220
Healthy code.

00:23:57.220 --> 00:23:57.845
Healthy coding.

00:23:57.845 --> 00:23:58.761
VIKRAM BAJAJ: Ah, yes.

00:23:58.761 --> 00:24:01.300
BILL NYE: Yeah, where you just
leave old code in the thing

00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:02.925
because you don't
want to mess with it.

00:24:02.925 --> 00:24:05.650
Then it turns out there's
some bug in there-- bah!

00:24:05.650 --> 00:24:08.990
Smoke comes out.

00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:14.380
Yeah, so there's apparently
a lot of leftover DNA

00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:16.940
that doesn't do--
we can't figure out

00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:18.030
what it does right now.

00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:20.070
It doesn't seem to
make any change.

00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:22.670
But there are very
significant changes.

00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:26.180
These things happen
regularly, like a clock.

00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:30.230
So you can assess the speed
at which DNA is changing,

00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:33.140
and then you can work back to
when the Neanderthals and us

00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:38.520
were apparently hunting the
same game and interacting.

00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:41.380
Can we say "interacting" here?

00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:43.210
VIKRAM BAJAJ: Yes.

00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:44.931
In fact, you need not
use the euphemism.

00:24:44.931 --> 00:24:45.430
But--

00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:46.638
BILL NYE: They were doing it.

00:24:46.638 --> 00:24:48.400
They were jumping each other.

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:50.270
They were having sex.

00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:52.645
They had sexual intercourse.

00:24:52.645 --> 00:24:54.020
VIKRAM BAJAJ: So
actually, that--

00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:55.670
BILL NYE: Interaction.

00:24:55.670 --> 00:24:58.552
That whole interact
culture that's emerged now.

00:24:58.552 --> 00:25:00.510
VIKRAM BAJAJ: It brings
me to my next question.

00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:02.400
And it's an important
topic in evolution.

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:05.510
I think you spend the
majority of the book on this.

00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:07.269
So I'd like to read
from one chapter.

00:25:07.269 --> 00:25:08.310
BILL NYE: Oh, I love you.

00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:10.200
He's reading.

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:11.020
No, that's worthy.

00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:12.436
VIKRAM BAJAJ: The
chapter's called

00:25:12.436 --> 00:25:19.920
"My Prom and Sexual Selection."

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:26.040
So it begins, "Being
a nerd, I did not

00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:28.290
anticipate going to
my high school prom."

00:25:28.290 --> 00:25:29.162
BILL NYE: It's true.

00:25:29.162 --> 00:25:30.620
VIKRAM BAJAJ:
"Nevertheless, I did.

00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:32.560
I was driven to
do so, apparently,

00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:34.344
by the shape of Leith's legs"--

00:25:34.344 --> 00:25:35.010
BILL NYE: Leith.

00:25:35.010 --> 00:25:35.843
VIKRAM BAJAJ: Leith.

00:25:35.843 --> 00:25:36.830
Excuse me.

00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:38.750
--"a clearly female classmate.

00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:41.510
This fascination with sex
is, near as anyone can tell,

00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:43.400
not something we get to choose.

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:45.550
Our ancestors
bequeathed it to us.

00:25:45.550 --> 00:25:48.080
It is another one of those
deeply shared evolutionary

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:51.100
traits, a drive that
we cannot disengage."

00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:54.380
So what's the role of sexual
reproduction in evolution?

00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:57.030
BILL NYE: That's an old mystery.

00:25:57.030 --> 00:26:02.460
But we have an excellent theory
as to why sex is so popular.

00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:06.284
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:10.120
And not just among people.

00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:13.830
Dandelions and sea
jellies, barnacles, they're

00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:17.530
all doing it like
crazy out there.

00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:19.030
And so it's complicated.

00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:22.815
You know, one of the
things I often reflect on,

00:26:22.815 --> 00:26:26.260
it's "The lilies of the
field, they do not toil,

00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:27.640
nor do they sow."

00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:29.000
They don't do anything.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.610
Actually, if you're a lily,
you are busting your empennage

00:26:32.610 --> 00:26:34.640
to make flowers.

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:39.980
All the energy you put into
making ova, eggs and pollen,

00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:41.550
it's a tremendous
amount of work.

00:26:41.550 --> 00:26:44.030
And the reason it's
done, apparently,

00:26:44.030 --> 00:26:46.710
is because of parasites.

00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:50.490
So if you're a meta
multicellular organism,

00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:53.940
like us, your enemy,
in general, is not

00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:56.580
a lion, a tiger, or a bear.

00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:59.310
Those, of course, are trouble,
as well documented in the film.

00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:06.100
But your main problem
is germs and parasites.

00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:13.490
So germs, if they're bacteria,
they're reproducing like crazy.

00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:15.330
They double in just a few hours.

00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:21.030
You'll have-- unchecked--
enormous populations of germs.

00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:23.530
But us, it takes us months.

00:27:23.530 --> 00:27:26.190
And after all the negotiation,
the going out to dinner,

00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:32.180
and all that stuff-- no,
it takes a long time.

00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:36.000
And then, when the kid's born,
you're looking at nothing.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.030
You've got years more
on top of that, right?

00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:43.750
So apparently, sex
is a way to come up

00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:47.350
with a new combination of genes
that the germs, parasites, just

00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:49.940
can't quite keep up with.

00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:53.560
And this is charmingly referred
to as the theory of the Red

00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:55.180
Queen.

00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:57.250
But the guy was British,
so the Red Queen.

00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:04.580
Alice of "Alice
in Wonderland" is

00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:07.170
in "Through the Looking
Glass," the second book.

00:28:07.170 --> 00:28:10.880
And she meets the Red Queen,
who's-- from my understanding,

00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:13.250
Lewis Carroll, I don't
know if he smoked dope,

00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:14.190
but he probably did.

00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:19.760
And so the Red Queen is like
this chess piece person.

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:22.964
And she's sliding around
on the chessboard of life.

00:28:22.964 --> 00:28:24.380
And so when you're
talking to her,

00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:25.730
you have to run all the time.

00:28:25.730 --> 00:28:29.520
But it's not explained
about the queen's legs

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:32.482
or her felt bottom,
whatever chess pieces have.

00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:37.630
And so Alice says, "You
know, where I come from,

00:28:37.630 --> 00:28:40.289
if you run all day, you'll
end up somewhere else."

00:28:40.289 --> 00:28:41.830
And the queen says,
"Well, that seems

00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:44.670
like a very slow
sort of country."

00:28:44.670 --> 00:28:48.510
And so this is the
idea of evolution.

00:28:48.510 --> 00:28:51.660
If you stop running, you will
fall off the treadmill of life.

00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:53.210
You will disappear.

00:28:53.210 --> 00:28:55.370
So this having sex, new
combination of genes,

00:28:55.370 --> 00:28:57.920
new combination of genes,
is how you stay in the game.

00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:01.890
And the predictive quality of
the theory of evolution just

00:29:01.890 --> 00:29:02.980
really comes into play.

00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:04.355
And I mentioned
this in Kentucky,

00:29:04.355 --> 00:29:06.640
and I mention it
again in the book.

00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:07.827
These crazy fish--

00:29:07.827 --> 00:29:08.910
VIKRAM BAJAJ: The minnows.

00:29:08.910 --> 00:29:10.534
BILL NYE: --in Mexico--
the top minnows

00:29:10.534 --> 00:29:17.390
is how we say it in English--
when there are not enough mates

00:29:17.390 --> 00:29:21.142
around, they just become
what Darwin called asexual.

00:29:21.142 --> 00:29:22.600
But we might call
it double-sexual.

00:29:25.150 --> 00:29:30.580
They just start reproducing
without doing it.

00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:33.540
And then those
reproduced fish are

00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:35.792
more susceptible to parasites.

00:29:35.792 --> 00:29:37.500
But then, when it
rains again and there's

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:39.980
a whole bunch of ponds
to swim around in

00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:41.620
and the fish population
gets big again,

00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:44.980
then they go back to
sexual reproduction.

00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:46.630
Crazy.

00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:49.750
Humans don't do that.

00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:51.530
I mean, a lot is said
about it nowadays,

00:29:51.530 --> 00:29:52.630
but humans don't do that.

00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:53.700
It's not the thing.

00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:56.350
VIKRAM BAJAJ: There's actually
one aspect of human sexuality,

00:29:56.350 --> 00:29:57.865
I think, that you
don't touch upon--

00:29:57.865 --> 00:29:58.490
BILL NYE: What?

00:29:58.490 --> 00:29:59.656
VIKRAM BAJAJ: --in the book.

00:29:59.656 --> 00:30:00.740
Just one.

00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:02.198
BILL NYE: Because
it fascinates me.

00:30:02.198 --> 00:30:02.750
Yeah.

00:30:02.750 --> 00:30:05.970
VIKRAM BAJAJ: And of course,
for thousands of years,

00:30:05.970 --> 00:30:08.420
we've known that same-sex
relationships are

00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:10.390
perfectly normal, documented.

00:30:10.390 --> 00:30:12.740
And there's an increasing
body of literature

00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:14.745
which suggests some
genetic causes, as well

00:30:14.745 --> 00:30:15.620
as epigenetic causes.

00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:15.925
BILL NYE: Oh, yeah.

00:30:15.925 --> 00:30:16.550
Oh, absolutely.

00:30:16.550 --> 00:30:18.730
VIKRAM BAJAJ: So what's the
evolutionary theoretical

00:30:18.730 --> 00:30:20.630
thinking on homosexuality?

00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:22.780
BILL NYE: Well, I'm
not an expert on this.

00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:25.590
But I can tell you-- and
the word people throw around

00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:27.720
nowadays, it's a spectrum.

00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:33.600
I think being a homosexual
guy is clearly not

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:35.410
genetically lethal.

00:30:35.410 --> 00:30:40.540
Homosexual guys have babies,
have kids, all the time.

00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:42.370
And so there's some blur.

00:30:42.370 --> 00:30:45.170
And also, my understanding--
I'm not an expert on this--

00:30:45.170 --> 00:30:47.700
but apparently, it's a
very common-- people always

00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:51.610
presume that human
female sexuality

00:30:51.610 --> 00:30:53.190
is more fluid than
male sexuality.

00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:59.100
But apparently, human
male homosexuals often

00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:01.840
have a period of having
a crush or a thing

00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:04.470
for a woman, a female human.

00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:08.750
So it must be-- because
it doesn't kill you,

00:31:08.750 --> 00:31:10.880
because it doesn't keep
you from having babies,

00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:11.770
it's still out there.

00:31:11.770 --> 00:31:12.710
Or it's out there.

00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:15.660
Or it's out there-- it's
always been out there.

00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:16.910
But I'm not an expert on that.

00:31:16.910 --> 00:31:21.940
And I'm telling you there's
an evolutionary reason for it.

00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:23.139
There's got to be.

00:31:23.139 --> 00:31:24.180
VIKRAM BAJAJ: Absolutely.

00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:25.830
BILL NYE: It's got to be
consistent with the theory

00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:27.601
of evolution, whatever
it turns out to be.

00:31:27.601 --> 00:31:29.850
VIKRAM BAJAJ: There have
been some papers and articles

00:31:29.850 --> 00:31:35.190
recently on the subject relating
to kin selection and altruism,

00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:37.580
which are some of the
counterintuitive aspects

00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:38.560
of evolutionary theory.

00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:40.085
Maybe we could get
into those now.

00:31:40.085 --> 00:31:40.360
BILL NYE: At first.

00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:41.526
VIKRAM BAJAJ: At first, yes.

00:31:41.526 --> 00:31:45.770
So proponents of
creationism, they often

00:31:45.770 --> 00:31:49.190
claim that there is no altruism
in the evolutionary model.

00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:50.780
Perhaps you can
explain how that's--

00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:51.110
BILL NYE: Oh, without them.

00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:53.030
Without the religion,
there'd be no altruism.

00:31:53.030 --> 00:31:53.415
VIKRAM BAJAJ: Yes.

00:31:53.415 --> 00:31:54.040
BILL NYE: Yeah.

00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:56.979
No, apparently, altruism
is-- for those of you--

00:31:56.979 --> 00:31:58.395
it's a word not
everybody uses all

00:31:58.395 --> 00:32:01.330
the time-- the drive to
help somebody else out,

00:32:01.330 --> 00:32:05.280
to help out another
member of your species.

00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:11.210
And the example that I just
am charmed by are the bats.

00:32:11.210 --> 00:32:15.070
Did anybody see the
Bill Nye caves show?

00:32:15.070 --> 00:32:15.990
That was a great one.

00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:17.960
It was really good.

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:20.210
It was later on,
and we had a budget.

00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:26.220
And so we flew to Carlsbad
Cavern in New Mexico.

00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:27.750
And it was just cool.

00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:31.820
But we were able to be
right there with the bats.

00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:33.440
And there are a lot
of bats, you guys.

00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:36.640
So apparently, the bats go out,
they eat mosquitoes all night.

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:40.730
Not everybody is a good
mosquito hunter, bat-wise.

00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:43.880
And so if a bat comes
back to the roost

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:46.350
and has not had enough to
eat, one of the other bats

00:32:46.350 --> 00:32:50.960
will, out of courtesy,
barf up some mosquito barf

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:52.487
and feed the other guy.

00:32:52.487 --> 00:32:53.570
VIKRAM BAJAJ: Interesting.

00:32:53.570 --> 00:32:55.170
BILL NYE: Now, why
would they do that?

00:32:55.170 --> 00:32:59.785
And as I say in the
book, that hungry bat

00:32:59.785 --> 00:33:01.660
should not have been
wearing those headphones

00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:03.480
and listening to that
rock 'n' roll music.

00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:08.800
He should've been echolocating
and eating mosquitoes

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:10.611
at very high speed and so on.

00:33:10.611 --> 00:33:11.610
But why do they do that?

00:33:11.610 --> 00:33:13.220
Well, apparently,
it's to preserve

00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:19.630
their tribe, their
roost, their rookery.

00:33:19.630 --> 00:33:22.110
And it's a heck of a thing.

00:33:22.110 --> 00:33:25.150
And I talk about humans.

00:33:25.150 --> 00:33:28.870
You guys can do this
thought experiment.

00:33:28.870 --> 00:33:31.610
And it's an experiment, OK?

00:33:31.610 --> 00:33:32.750
I mean, it's a game.

00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:33.810
It's a game theory.

00:33:33.810 --> 00:33:35.570
It's creepy.

00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:38.810
House is on fire, you're only
allowed to save one person.

00:33:38.810 --> 00:33:40.380
That's a rule.

00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:44.630
Do you save your
mother or-- let's

00:33:44.630 --> 00:33:46.750
see, let me just--
hang on-- do you save

00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:49.720
your grandmother, your
mother, or your own kid?

00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:52.120
And you save your own
kid, because you're

00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:56.480
driven to reach as far into
the genetic future as possible.

00:33:56.480 --> 00:34:00.930
With that said, humans are
always helping out other humans

00:34:00.930 --> 00:34:04.990
without nearly that close
of a genetic connection.

00:34:07.630 --> 00:34:09.840
You remember when this
building was burning in Texas

00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:12.210
and this construction
worker was there

00:34:12.210 --> 00:34:14.449
and they got the fire truck
ladder right up to it,

00:34:14.449 --> 00:34:16.250
and the guy jumped
off-- whoa-- and then

00:34:16.250 --> 00:34:18.010
the building
collapsed-- [WHOOSH].

00:34:18.010 --> 00:34:21.434
And nobody said, well he
should he have done that?

00:34:21.434 --> 00:34:22.920
That was very dangerous.

00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:23.760
No.

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:24.679
It's what humans do.

00:34:24.679 --> 00:34:25.929
We just help out other humans.

00:34:25.929 --> 00:34:28.469
And apparently,
that's deep within us.

00:34:28.469 --> 00:34:30.310
And I don't want to
cause no trouble.

00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:34.130
But that seems to
be deeper within us

00:34:34.130 --> 00:34:39.389
and older than the
invention or discovery

00:34:39.389 --> 00:34:41.729
or whatever the expression
is of religions.

00:34:41.729 --> 00:34:42.520
VIKRAM BAJAJ: Sure.

00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:45.029
BILL NYE: So it's not clear
the cause and effect there.

00:34:45.029 --> 00:34:46.070
VIKRAM BAJAJ: Absolutely.

00:34:46.070 --> 00:34:49.610
So perhaps we can go over
one or two other really

00:34:49.610 --> 00:34:51.969
counterintuitive
aspects of evolution.

00:34:51.969 --> 00:34:54.367
So one that you describe--

00:34:54.367 --> 00:34:55.950
BILL NYE: God, you
read the book, Vik.

00:34:55.950 --> 00:34:56.920
I love you, man.

00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:57.972
VIKRAM BAJAJ: I did.

00:34:57.972 --> 00:34:59.570
BILL NYE: No, a lot of times,
you get interviewed by people,

00:34:59.570 --> 00:35:01.486
and the majority didn't
actually read the book

00:35:01.486 --> 00:35:03.502
because they've got stuff to do.

00:35:03.502 --> 00:35:05.210
And they just look at
the chapter titles.

00:35:08.310 --> 00:35:09.070
Go ahead.

00:35:09.070 --> 00:35:10.592
VIKRAM BAJAJ: So biodiversity.

00:35:10.592 --> 00:35:11.550
BILL NYE: Biodiversity.

00:35:11.550 --> 00:35:14.200
VIKRAM BAJAJ: Yeah, how does it
fit into evolutionary theory?

00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:19.910
BILL NYE: Well, it is reasonable
that the longer life has

00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:23.010
been in any one place, the
more diverse it becomes.

00:35:23.010 --> 00:35:29.370
The longer species have been
generating, interacting,

00:35:29.370 --> 00:35:32.100
with humans in the
subway or what have you,

00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:34.240
the more species you get.

00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:37.100
And not surprisingly,
where there's

00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:40.160
the most sunlight, the
most energy coming in

00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:42.565
from outer space, that's
where the most diversity is,

00:35:42.565 --> 00:35:45.110
at the equator, or
near the equator.

00:35:45.110 --> 00:35:48.200
In tropical rainforests is where
you have the most diversity.

00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:50.620
Then, as you go north or
south from the equator,

00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:52.390
there's less diversity.

00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:54.900
With that said, it
doesn't mean that there

00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:57.830
are fewer individuals.

00:35:57.830 --> 00:36:02.550
If you've ever flown over the
forest in Canada or Pacific

00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:06.950
Northwest, there's just trees
and trees and trees and trees.

00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:08.830
But there's actually
less diversity

00:36:08.830 --> 00:36:11.840
of trees, less different
types of plants and animals

00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:14.800
there, than in the Amazon.

00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:17.540
And that's absolutely
consistent with the way

00:36:17.540 --> 00:36:19.120
species come to be.

00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:20.529
It's what you'd expect.

00:36:20.529 --> 00:36:22.320
Now, one of the great
mysteries right now--

00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:25.940
and you guys may be alive when
this is figured out-- well,

00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:28.350
of course, the fundamental
mystery is how did it all gets

00:36:28.350 --> 00:36:30.150
started.

00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:31.705
Like, where did
we come from, man?

00:36:31.705 --> 00:36:33.942
Like, dude.

00:36:33.942 --> 00:36:36.400
And I talk about this all the
time with the planetary side.

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:38.770
Where did we come
from, and are we alone?

00:36:38.770 --> 00:36:40.480
Those are the deep,
deep questions.

00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:44.720
But it's very reasonable that
life started in the deep sea,

00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:47.490
in one of these hydrothermal
vents, where there's

00:36:47.490 --> 00:36:50.920
all this hot water and
salt and nutrients--

00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:56.882
I mean hot water and
nutrients and heat.

00:36:56.882 --> 00:36:58.840
I guess hot water would
have heat, wouldn't it?

00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:00.580
OK, thank you, Bill.

00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:03.350
Or did it start on land
with lightning strikes

00:37:03.350 --> 00:37:05.710
from a scraping atmosphere
on the Earth's surface

00:37:05.710 --> 00:37:06.240
and roiling?

00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:12.990
I tell the story, I walked
into-- at Cornell University--

00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:14.350
I went to Cornell, you guys.

00:37:14.350 --> 00:37:15.850
Don't bust their chops.

00:37:15.850 --> 00:37:17.540
Go, Big Red.

00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:20.460
But I'm sure it was a
mistake on their part.

00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:22.800
They did not intend to let me.

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:26.180
Once I was there, they
were kind of stuck.

00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:27.740
But there's a whole
building called

00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:30.840
Space Sciences, made
of cinder block.

00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:32.790
It's not a great
looking building.

00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:36.110
But on the third floor,
I walked in one day

00:37:36.110 --> 00:37:37.442
on the Urey-Miller experiment.

00:37:37.442 --> 00:37:39.900
Now, I was a mechanical-- I
still am-- mechanical engineer.

00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:42.960
I have a license, people.

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:44.800
But I walked in there.

00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:46.720
And if you've never
heard of this thing,

00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:49.110
the Urey-Miller experiment
is where these guys

00:37:49.110 --> 00:37:51.950
tried to reproduce the
primordial atmosphere

00:37:51.950 --> 00:37:55.387
of the Earth and then
spark it with lightning

00:37:55.387 --> 00:37:56.720
to see if anything would happen.

00:37:56.720 --> 00:38:00.720
And indeed, they got
one zillion amino acids,

00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:05.230
carbon with oxygen-oxygen on it.

00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:07.110
And so I went, wow,
that's evidence of life.

00:38:07.110 --> 00:38:09.450
Wow, it could be, but
it's not quite alive.

00:38:09.450 --> 00:38:14.100
And so these questions go
back, where'd we all come from?

00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:16.300
So did it start on
the surface, or did it

00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:17.810
start on the deep ocean?

00:38:17.810 --> 00:38:19.800
Maybe you guys will
figure that out.

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:20.800
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo.

00:38:23.015 --> 00:38:24.390
VIKRAM BAJAJ:
Actually, I do want

00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:26.690
to discuss the work of
your planetary society.

00:38:26.690 --> 00:38:28.100
Let me--

00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:29.940
BILL NYE: I love you, man.

00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:31.930
VIKRAM BAJAJ:
--introduce that again.

00:38:31.930 --> 00:38:34.940
I think it's a natural correlate
of evolutionary thinking.

00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:38.180
So you write, at the
end of your book,

00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:40.250
"At the end of the
journey of this book,

00:38:40.250 --> 00:38:43.290
I find myself thinking about
the end journey of evolution

00:38:43.290 --> 00:38:45.510
itself, not just
human evolution,

00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:47.270
but the process as a whole.

00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:49.060
I have long wondered
whether there

00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:51.470
is some kind of cosmic
imperative for life

00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:54.020
to spread from world to world.

00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:57.870
On Earth, we see that organisms
colonize every possible niche.

00:38:57.870 --> 00:39:00.050
We see that living things
move into new environments

00:39:00.050 --> 00:39:01.800
and beget new species.

00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:04.910
Is life destined to colonize
the solar system, the Milky Way,

00:39:04.910 --> 00:39:09.030
and ultimately to spread out
through the whole universe?"

00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:10.600
So you don't answer
the question.

00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:13.220
BILL NYE: I don't know, man.

00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:15.930
So you guys were
living at a time

00:39:15.930 --> 00:39:20.200
where-- so you guys are all big,
successful engineers, right?

00:39:22.850 --> 00:39:25.675
When I left, it was Fortran 7.

00:39:28.470 --> 00:39:31.940
When I went to school,
we had punch cards.

00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:38.776
And I had a slide
rule. [COUGHING]

00:39:38.776 --> 00:39:40.150
And that's not
the good old days.

00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:41.691
But where would you
be working if you

00:39:41.691 --> 00:39:43.260
weren't working at Google?

00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:44.106
SpaceX, right?

00:39:44.106 --> 00:39:45.230
You want to work at SpaceX.

00:39:48.510 --> 00:39:50.280
I know, I know, I know.

00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:54.620
But I just tell everybody--
do you guys know

00:39:54.620 --> 00:39:58.600
the motto of the
state of California?

00:39:58.600 --> 00:39:59.473
Anybody?

00:39:59.473 --> 00:40:00.282
AUDIENCE: Eureka.

00:40:00.282 --> 00:40:00.990
BILL NYE: Eureka.

00:40:00.990 --> 00:40:01.490
Yeah.

00:40:01.490 --> 00:40:03.000
Eureka-- I found it.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.430
And so these European
people come over the hill.

00:40:06.430 --> 00:40:09.810
And there are salmon in the
Sacramento River, like this.

00:40:09.810 --> 00:40:11.800
I mean, it's all the
protein you'd ever want.

00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:15.350
Apparently, the first
American, first nation people

00:40:15.350 --> 00:40:18.400
from the Pacific
Northwest are generally,

00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:24.320
by archaeologists,
considered the richest people

00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:27.100
in the Americas, because
they had all these salmon.

00:40:27.100 --> 00:40:29.270
They had just infinite protein.

00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:33.720
So they could just mess
around with other projects.

00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:36.010
But these guys
come over the hill,

00:40:36.010 --> 00:40:38.300
and orange trees are like weeds.

00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:40.120
And then, at one
point in California,

00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:42.310
the rocks are made of gold.

00:40:42.310 --> 00:40:44.520
Like the rocks are gold.

00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:48.210
We still have the San Francisco
49ers, for crying out loud.

00:40:48.210 --> 00:40:52.400
But when you go to Mars, you
guys, it ain't like that.

00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:54.630
I'm sorry.

00:40:54.630 --> 00:40:56.350
It's hostile.

00:40:56.350 --> 00:40:58.340
It's freezing cold.

00:40:58.340 --> 00:41:00.050
There is no liquid water.

00:41:00.050 --> 00:41:02.480
And when you open the
door of the spaceship,

00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:07.240
you will find out right
away, you cannot breathe.

00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:09.850
You will notice that.

00:41:09.850 --> 00:41:14.710
And so I want to go to Mars,
but I want to come back.

00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:17.060
I want to go look for
signs of life on Mars.

00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:18.030
Yes, yes, yes.

00:41:18.030 --> 00:41:20.850
If we discovered life on
another world in our lifetime,

00:41:20.850 --> 00:41:23.670
it would utterly, utterly
change this world.

00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:25.280
It would change
the way everybody

00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:27.200
thinks about everything.

00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:29.870
And we can do it, you
guys, for $2 billion.

00:41:29.870 --> 00:41:31.420
Let's go.

00:41:31.420 --> 00:41:34.190
We can go out there
and have a look.

00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:36.980
VIKRAM BAJAJ: Let's talk
about Mars a little bit more.

00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:39.460
There's flowing water on Mars.

00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:43.060
There's, perhaps, good
reason to believe that life,

00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:45.140
maybe even as we know
it, existed there.

00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:47.400
How would you find it?

00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:50.060
BILL NYE: So a couple things.

00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:51.660
I mean, don't get me wrong.

00:41:51.660 --> 00:41:53.965
My father was quite
the rock hound.

00:41:53.965 --> 00:41:56.470
You know this expression
"some of my best friends."

00:41:56.470 --> 00:41:59.640
Some of my best friends
are geologists, really.

00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:00.910
And I love rocks.

00:42:00.910 --> 00:42:03.770
Every rock tells a story.

00:42:03.770 --> 00:42:06.560
But what we're doing right now,
we spend about $1.5 billion

00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:08.990
a year on planetary science.

00:42:08.990 --> 00:42:12.330
Now, to put that in
perspective, the NASA budget

00:42:12.330 --> 00:42:16.710
is $17.7 billion a year.

00:42:16.710 --> 00:42:20.270
And if you ask people
on the street, what

00:42:20.270 --> 00:42:23.670
percentage of the US federal
budget is the NASA budget,

00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:26.460
somebody'll say, 10%.

00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:28.870
It's 0.4%.

00:42:28.870 --> 00:42:34.270
So $1.5 billion is 9% of 0.4%.

00:42:34.270 --> 00:42:38.710
And if we were to just up that a
little so that-- the expression

00:42:38.710 --> 00:42:42.000
that these guys love is
the landing ellipse-- so

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.020
that the spacecraft could
be targeted to Mars more

00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:49.160
accurately, then-- whoa--
then 60-kilometer-long-- whoa,

00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:51.026
that's pretty close.

00:42:51.026 --> 00:42:53.526
Let me tell you guys, if you're
looking for something to eat

00:42:53.526 --> 00:42:56.715
and you're off by 60 kilometers,
you're going to be hungry.

00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:02.100
So what if we spent
more money and tightened

00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:05.520
that up and then made these
cool, extraordinary robots that

00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:08.890
could repel, in rock
climber fashion,

00:43:08.890 --> 00:43:11.570
down the side of a hill on Mars
and get where there might be

00:43:11.570 --> 00:43:15.560
super salty slushy water
on a Martian summer day,

00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:18.130
and then maybe you'd
find fossil microbes?

00:43:18.130 --> 00:43:22.768
But wait, maybe there'd
be something still alive.

00:43:22.768 --> 00:43:25.570
Bahahaha.

00:43:25.570 --> 00:43:29.660
And we could do that,
you know, $1.8 billion

00:43:29.660 --> 00:43:31.370
a year for 10 or 12 years.

00:43:31.370 --> 00:43:32.640
We could do that.

00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:34.540
We just have to be motivated.

00:43:34.540 --> 00:43:37.700
And let alone if we spend
Apollo kind of money on it,

00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:39.610
we could get 'er done.

00:43:39.610 --> 00:43:42.105
And it would change
the freaking world.

00:43:42.105 --> 00:43:43.980
It would absolutely
change the world.

00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:45.710
And this is the
romance of it for me.

00:43:45.710 --> 00:43:48.510
And we are uniquely
qualified to do this.

00:43:48.510 --> 00:43:50.740
Well, we should be
paying teacher salaries,

00:43:50.740 --> 00:43:53.810
and we should be-- yes.

00:43:53.810 --> 00:43:56.720
If you're a politician,
the problem is not,

00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:59.550
should we pay teachers,
should we go to Mars?

00:43:59.550 --> 00:44:01.580
We have to do it all.

00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:04.390
And the other thing I'd
just remind you guys--

00:44:04.390 --> 00:44:05.730
and I know we're in New York.

00:44:05.730 --> 00:44:07.890
We're all a bunch of
progressive, bleeding heart,

00:44:07.890 --> 00:44:11.430
liberal, crazy people--
but remind you guys

00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:15.790
that when you invest in
space exploration especially,

00:44:15.790 --> 00:44:18.840
the return on it
is extraordinary.

00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:21.720
You guys would not have jobs
without the space program.

00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:27.280
The internet would not exist
without the US space program.

00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:29.750
And then you talk about all
the materials-- everybody

00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:31.620
loves his Teflon and
this Velcro and stuff.

00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:34.720
But it's the
expectation that you

00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:38.270
can get things done
in a big way, that's

00:44:38.270 --> 00:44:41.130
what the space
exploration brings to us.

00:44:41.130 --> 00:44:43.140
So that's why I advocate
for it right now.

00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:47.070
And then, along that line,
I'd just remind everybody

00:44:47.070 --> 00:44:49.400
that climate change, in
the modern era-- I mean,

00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:55.300
it was discovered in the
19th century, really.

00:44:55.300 --> 00:44:57.340
And Benjamin Franklin
speculated about it.

00:44:57.340 --> 00:45:00.590
But in the modern
era, climate change

00:45:00.590 --> 00:45:04.410
was discovered, really, on
Venus, the planet Venus.

00:45:04.410 --> 00:45:08.754
And so space exploration just
brings out the best in us.

00:45:08.754 --> 00:45:09.420
And that's why--

00:45:09.420 --> 00:45:11.230
VIKRAM BAJAJ: Including Carl
Sagan and others, Jim Hansen.

00:45:11.230 --> 00:45:12.605
BILL NYE: Well,
Carl Sagan-- so I

00:45:12.605 --> 00:45:15.260
like to say-- yeah, James
Hansen-- the computer models

00:45:15.260 --> 00:45:19.440
that we use even today
for climate modeling

00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:22.730
are based, really, on the
original ones from the 1970s.

00:45:22.730 --> 00:45:24.760
And right around
the year 1980 is

00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:27.050
when people really-- where
you guys even freaking

00:45:27.050 --> 00:45:28.090
born in 1980?

00:45:28.090 --> 00:45:30.520
I suck.

00:45:30.520 --> 00:45:35.340
It was right there where
disco was giving way

00:45:35.340 --> 00:45:40.830
to punk and new wave and
the important work of Sid

00:45:40.830 --> 00:45:44.134
Vicious and the Sex Pistols.

00:45:44.134 --> 00:45:45.050
Sorry, I don't get it.

00:45:45.050 --> 00:45:45.674
I never got it.

00:45:45.674 --> 00:45:46.425
Not my thing.

00:45:46.425 --> 00:45:47.490
VIKRAM BAJAJ: So the
subject is actually

00:45:47.490 --> 00:45:50.140
related to some of the questions
that the audience is raising.

00:45:50.140 --> 00:45:51.770
BILL NYE: Oh, here
we are, tweeting.

00:45:51.770 --> 00:45:53.000
That's how we roll.

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:54.690
VIKRAM BAJAJ: It's
our version of that.

00:45:54.690 --> 00:45:55.390
BILL NYE: Oh, sorry, sorry.

00:45:55.390 --> 00:45:55.889
My bad.

00:45:55.889 --> 00:45:57.144
Ooh.

00:45:57.144 --> 00:45:59.560
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:45:59.560 --> 00:46:00.330
We're geeking.

00:46:00.330 --> 00:46:04.230
VIKRAM BAJAJ: Whose name
I forget, I must admit.

00:46:04.230 --> 00:46:07.062
So we don't have
an Apollo program.

00:46:07.062 --> 00:46:08.520
Some of us who grew
up in the '80s,

00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:11.200
we were nevertheless motivated
by space exploration,

00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:12.410
human space flight.

00:46:12.410 --> 00:46:16.690
Now we're faced with really
existential problems, where

00:46:16.690 --> 00:46:18.880
science is the only solution.

00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:21.320
But there's nothing
really to motivate

00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:23.000
people to go into science as--

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.272
BILL NYE: Well, that's
our job here at Google.

00:46:25.272 --> 00:46:26.980
VIKRAM BAJAJ: What's
the role for Google,

00:46:26.980 --> 00:46:28.938
and what's the role for
big government science?

00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:33.490
BILL NYE: OK.

00:46:33.490 --> 00:46:34.640
I have an issue now.

00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:37.390
There are people
in elected office

00:46:37.390 --> 00:46:40.850
who feel that government is bad.

00:46:40.850 --> 00:46:43.855
Like, why did you
take this gig, man?

00:46:43.855 --> 00:46:45.500
They feel that
government should be

00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:48.520
shrunk as much as
possible and destroyed.

00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:51.820
As that guy, the anti-tax
guy, says, to put in a bathtub

00:46:51.820 --> 00:46:53.020
and drown.

00:46:53.020 --> 00:46:54.910
I just really
disagree with that.

00:46:54.910 --> 00:46:58.860
The New York City subway takes
a billion passengers a year.

00:46:58.860 --> 00:47:02.630
You absolutely could not do
that in the libertarian society.

00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:03.840
You just couldn't.

00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:05.070
Sorry, man.

00:47:05.070 --> 00:47:08.380
And I don't want
two sets of sewers,

00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:13.290
two sets of phone lines,
two sets of cell towers.

00:47:13.290 --> 00:47:15.470
Phone lines, sorry,
older reference.

00:47:15.470 --> 00:47:16.444
Sorry.

00:47:16.444 --> 00:47:18.110
I don't know if you
knew this, but there

00:47:18.110 --> 00:47:23.690
used to be copper wires
that transmitted voice.

00:47:23.690 --> 00:47:24.660
It was OK.

00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:25.510
Not much bandwidth.

00:47:25.510 --> 00:47:26.640
It was all right.

00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:28.595
It was all right.

00:47:28.595 --> 00:47:29.770
It was a long time ago.

00:47:33.780 --> 00:47:37.720
It was more than
two years ago, yeah.

00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:43.620
They're still in the '10s,
the 2010s, 20 aughts.

00:47:43.620 --> 00:47:47.150
So one of the
things about climate

00:47:47.150 --> 00:47:51.180
change that is something
for everybody to consider,

00:47:51.180 --> 00:47:55.770
people who are against
government intrusion,

00:47:55.770 --> 00:47:59.670
government getting
into your business,

00:47:59.670 --> 00:48:04.760
I think they're really going
to be troubled by what's

00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:07.560
going to be required to
address climate change.

00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:11.450
And the model for this is in
my parents' day, World War II.

00:48:11.450 --> 00:48:15.460
You couldn't just buy
tires for your car.

00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:17.500
You couldn't just buy meat.

00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:19.562
You couldn't buy
certain vegetables,

00:48:19.562 --> 00:48:21.020
especially at
certain times a year.

00:48:21.020 --> 00:48:21.769
You just couldn't.

00:48:21.769 --> 00:48:25.690
They weren't available, because
the man stepped in and sent it

00:48:25.690 --> 00:48:29.870
to the boys to conduct the war.

00:48:29.870 --> 00:48:32.770
And that was government
intrusion in a way

00:48:32.770 --> 00:48:36.512
that-- people talk about
the greatest generation.

00:48:36.512 --> 00:48:38.595
Part of the reason that
people considered it great

00:48:38.595 --> 00:48:40.200
is because they worked together.

00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:41.710
And to address
climate change, it's

00:48:41.710 --> 00:48:44.030
going to be that same deal.

00:48:44.030 --> 00:48:46.830
The sooner we get started,
the better, for me.

00:48:46.830 --> 00:48:49.380
VIKRAM BAJAJ: And what role
do you see, more specifically,

00:48:49.380 --> 00:48:51.844
for large corporations,
like Google?

00:48:51.844 --> 00:48:52.760
BILL NYE: Like Google?

00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:53.350
Man.

00:48:53.350 --> 00:48:53.680
VIKRAM BAJAJ: What
do you want us to do?

00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:55.179
BILL NYE: No, the
key to the future,

00:48:55.179 --> 00:48:57.270
kids, peoples, you are it.

00:48:57.270 --> 00:48:58.781
You are IT.

00:48:58.781 --> 00:48:59.280
Wait.

00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:03.650
No.

00:49:03.650 --> 00:49:06.440
No, you are it, because
the key to the future

00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:09.150
is not just to do less.

00:49:09.150 --> 00:49:13.730
I grew up-- I'm so old-- I
remember the very first Earth

00:49:13.730 --> 00:49:14.820
Day.

00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:22.000
The very first Earth Day was
in 1970, before Motown really

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:25.220
was called Motown.

00:49:25.220 --> 00:49:28.755
The Motor City existed, but
the music, although it existed,

00:49:28.755 --> 00:49:29.880
didn't have that sobriquet.

00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:32.460
Anyway-- digress, me?

00:49:34.630 --> 00:49:36.630
VIKRAM BAJAJ: Or perhaps
there's no easy answer.

00:49:36.630 --> 00:49:37.338
BILL NYE: No, no.

00:49:37.338 --> 00:49:40.950
So in those days, everybody
wanted you to do less,

00:49:40.950 --> 00:49:46.620
to drive your car less,
to use less clean water,

00:49:46.620 --> 00:49:48.650
so wear dirty clothes.

00:49:48.650 --> 00:49:50.110
And humans are bad.

00:49:50.110 --> 00:49:52.070
Humans don't belong
in the ecosystem,

00:49:52.070 --> 00:49:56.270
humans have nothing to do with
nature, get rid of humans.

00:49:56.270 --> 00:49:58.560
In fact, if you
can, just don't eat.

00:49:58.560 --> 00:49:59.830
Don't even eat, really.

00:49:59.830 --> 00:50:01.288
And that's turned
out to be, as you

00:50:01.288 --> 00:50:03.290
might imagine, not
especially popular.

00:50:03.290 --> 00:50:06.150
And so the key to the
future is not to do less.

00:50:06.150 --> 00:50:09.290
The key is to do more with less.

00:50:09.290 --> 00:50:11.020
And that's where
companies like Google

00:50:11.020 --> 00:50:14.150
enable this in an amazing way.

00:50:14.150 --> 00:50:17.030
Do you know how many
hours people my age

00:50:17.030 --> 00:50:19.560
spent in the freaking library?

00:50:19.560 --> 00:50:21.840
I mean, going to look
things up in a card catalog

00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:23.950
was a skill you developed.

00:50:23.950 --> 00:50:26.495
But the difference was,
when you found stuff

00:50:26.495 --> 00:50:28.130
in the encyclopedia--
if you found

00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:34.000
the atomic number
of strontium-- 38--

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.740
in the Encyclopedia
Britannica, it

00:50:36.740 --> 00:50:38.540
was almost certainly correct.

00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:40.160
There was no issue with that.

00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:42.615
Whereas now, when you
look on Wikipedia,

00:50:42.615 --> 00:50:44.490
you just don't know what
you're going to get.

00:50:44.490 --> 00:50:48.720
So it's a new skill that
students have to develop,

00:50:48.720 --> 00:50:52.750
is how to sift through this
greater volume of lower quality

00:50:52.750 --> 00:50:53.340
information.

00:50:53.340 --> 00:50:56.190
But the world will be better,
because not everybody has

00:50:56.190 --> 00:50:58.350
to get in the car or
the subway to commute.

00:50:58.350 --> 00:51:02.234
People can commute
from their phone.

00:51:02.234 --> 00:51:04.150
The planetary side,
people are extraordinarily

00:51:04.150 --> 00:51:06.794
productive without ever coming
into the office, I have to say.

00:51:06.794 --> 00:51:08.210
But that doesn't
mean I don't want

00:51:08.210 --> 00:51:09.370
you coming into the
office, you guys.

00:51:09.370 --> 00:51:10.680
I'm sorry, if you're out there.

00:51:13.260 --> 00:51:18.690
And so Google is a key
to doing more with less.

00:51:18.690 --> 00:51:20.830
But somewhere along
the line, you guys,

00:51:20.830 --> 00:51:23.630
somebody's going to have
to make electricity.

00:51:23.630 --> 00:51:25.560
You can have all the
server farms you want,

00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:30.240
but if you can't plug them
in, we're in bad shape.

00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:32.820
And this is when-- is
it true that robots

00:51:32.820 --> 00:51:36.330
are going to take
over the world?

00:51:36.330 --> 00:51:38.870
I mean, if somebody keeps
shoveling coal for them,

00:51:38.870 --> 00:51:40.760
I guess.

00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:42.280
But if you stop
making electricity,

00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:44.960
the robots will really have
a hard time of it, generally.

00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:46.770
No, they'll make
nuclear power plants.

00:51:46.770 --> 00:51:48.600
OK, all right, maybe.

00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:50.980
It's not so simple.

00:51:50.980 --> 00:51:51.820
So go ahead.

00:51:51.820 --> 00:51:54.180
Sorry.

00:51:54.180 --> 00:51:54.720
Hold it.

00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:57.670
It says right here, we're
not going to do any-- whoa,

00:51:57.670 --> 00:51:58.610
I've blown it.

00:51:58.610 --> 00:51:59.210
Sorry.

00:51:59.210 --> 00:51:59.580
Go ahead.

00:51:59.580 --> 00:52:01.320
VIKRAM BAJAJ: So there
is really no easy answer.

00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:03.540
It's something that we
all have to struggle to--

00:52:03.540 --> 00:52:06.500
BILL NYE: Well, when it comes to
climate change, in my opinion,

00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:11.540
the answer is to do everything
we possibly can, all at once.

00:52:11.540 --> 00:52:13.410
How's that?

00:52:13.410 --> 00:52:16.590
More efficient electricity,
more efficient trans--

00:52:16.590 --> 00:52:18.590
transportation is a
huge cost, especially

00:52:18.590 --> 00:52:24.870
in the US-- more efficient
cities, more efficient farms,

00:52:24.870 --> 00:52:28.310
in the biggest picture,
and of course, raising

00:52:28.310 --> 00:52:32.330
the quality of life,
especially of women and girls,

00:52:32.330 --> 00:52:35.750
because deep within
this problem--

00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:42.610
when I was here at the
World's Fair, in 1965,

00:52:42.610 --> 00:52:45.920
I was nine years old,
the world had just

00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:48.847
gotten 3 billion people.

00:52:48.847 --> 00:52:50.180
Well, a few days ago, I checked.

00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:52.720
We're at 7.2 billion people.

00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:54.450
And that's it.

00:52:54.450 --> 00:52:56.350
You've more than doubled
the number of humans

00:52:56.350 --> 00:52:59.420
burning and breathing the
atmosphere in the last two

00:52:59.420 --> 00:53:00.120
decades.

00:53:00.120 --> 00:53:01.570
That's your problem.

00:53:01.570 --> 00:53:06.410
So we need to reduce
the human population.

00:53:06.410 --> 00:53:07.120
We do.

00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:10.120
But I mean, this is--
you guys, we don't do it.

00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:14.290
By the way, war is
completely ineffective.

00:53:14.290 --> 00:53:16.510
Ebola will not do it.

00:53:16.510 --> 00:53:18.270
No.

00:53:18.270 --> 00:53:19.690
And you can see it historically.

00:53:19.690 --> 00:53:21.320
The scale of the
problem is huge.

00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:24.620
Well, if you raise the standard
of living of women and girls,

00:53:24.620 --> 00:53:26.830
over the next
century and a half,

00:53:26.830 --> 00:53:29.059
the human population will
stabilize and go down.

00:53:29.059 --> 00:53:29.850
VIKRAM BAJAJ: Sure.

00:53:29.850 --> 00:53:32.590
BILL NYE: And the way to do that
is to educate women and girls.

00:53:32.590 --> 00:53:35.080
This is a really huge problem.

00:53:35.080 --> 00:53:36.520
But let's get going, people.

00:53:36.520 --> 00:53:38.764
We can change the world.

00:53:38.764 --> 00:53:40.240
AUDIENCE: Whoo, yeah.

00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:43.684
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:47.975 --> 00:53:49.100
BILL NYE: Thanks, you guys.

00:53:49.100 --> 00:53:50.060
I love you guys.

00:53:50.060 --> 00:53:54.720
VIKRAM BAJAJ: So we don't have
time for audience questions,

00:53:54.720 --> 00:53:55.527
for live questions.

00:53:55.527 --> 00:53:57.610
But there was one last
question that I wanted to--

00:53:57.610 --> 00:53:58.940
BILL NYE: The dead questions
are very troubling.

00:53:58.940 --> 00:53:59.440
Yeah.

00:54:01.689 --> 00:54:03.980
VIKRAM BAJAJ: There's one
last question from the screen

00:54:03.980 --> 00:54:07.440
that I wanted to
discuss with you.

00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:10.650
It's really, again, on
the subject of evolution.

00:54:10.650 --> 00:54:14.380
How can individuals debate
their family members, others,

00:54:14.380 --> 00:54:16.980
who are creationists
or who don't

00:54:16.980 --> 00:54:19.020
understand evolutionary theory?

00:54:19.020 --> 00:54:22.870
BILL NYE: So you guys,
that is your job.

00:54:22.870 --> 00:54:27.140
People ask me-- I see a few
of these questions-- what's

00:54:27.140 --> 00:54:28.940
the most important
thing you could do?

00:54:28.940 --> 00:54:30.430
What's a single-- if
you had to do one thing,

00:54:30.430 --> 00:54:31.179
what would you do?

00:54:31.179 --> 00:54:34.130
Who's the target audience--
[INTENTIONALLY MUMBLES]

00:54:34.130 --> 00:54:36.640
Oh, I see the Higgs boson.

00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:39.520
Let me just say, you
guys, I'm not so sure.

00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:41.580
5 sigma is good.

00:54:41.580 --> 00:54:42.615
But it ain't 9 sigma.

00:54:42.615 --> 00:54:44.970
It ain't 7 sigma.

00:54:44.970 --> 00:54:46.160
I've said it, OK?

00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:48.210
I've said it.

00:54:48.210 --> 00:54:50.900
I believe in 5 sigma,
but compare a Toyota

00:54:50.900 --> 00:54:53.500
to a Detroit car.

00:54:53.500 --> 00:54:56.780
Toyota designs at 5 sigma,
Detroit designs at 3.

00:54:56.780 --> 00:54:58.440
Compare and contrast.

00:54:58.440 --> 00:55:00.930
VIKRAM BAJAJ: There may have
to be some retractions now.

00:55:00.930 --> 00:55:02.179
BILL NYE: No, I'm just saying.

00:55:02.179 --> 00:55:05.630
So the single most
important thing

00:55:05.630 --> 00:55:07.960
we can all do right
now, I believe,

00:55:07.960 --> 00:55:11.190
is talk about climate change.

00:55:11.190 --> 00:55:12.500
Just raise awareness.

00:55:12.500 --> 00:55:15.830
Just make it part of our
everyday conversation,

00:55:15.830 --> 00:55:19.640
because we are all living
in a little bit of denial

00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:20.540
of climate change.

00:55:20.540 --> 00:55:23.340
And I'm the first
to say, me too.

00:55:23.340 --> 00:55:24.040
I, as well.

00:55:24.040 --> 00:55:25.630
Mea culpa.

00:55:25.630 --> 00:55:27.600
By raising awareness
of climate change,

00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:29.150
we will get something done.

00:55:29.150 --> 00:55:32.880
Now, just by way
of example, my dad

00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:38.050
took a job in 1941
on Wake Island.

00:55:38.050 --> 00:55:39.790
I don't know if you've
ever heard of it.

00:55:39.790 --> 00:55:41.730
You go to Hawaii, and
then you go about that

00:55:41.730 --> 00:55:44.770
far again to Wake.

00:55:44.770 --> 00:55:46.730
It's still a tactically
important place.

00:55:46.730 --> 00:55:51.060
There are about 700 US Air Force
landings, airplane landings,

00:55:51.060 --> 00:55:51.980
every year.

00:55:51.980 --> 00:55:53.900
When you went to
Asia, in the old days,

00:55:53.900 --> 00:55:58.700
you'd fly from San Francisco
to Pearl Harbor to Wake

00:55:58.700 --> 00:56:02.170
and then on to Midway,
usually, in Shanghai, in China.

00:56:02.170 --> 00:56:05.400
But without Wake Island,
you couldn't make that trip.

00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:09.980
Anyway, everybody thought,
well, things are going to be OK.

00:56:09.980 --> 00:56:13.160
There's never going to
be a war in the Pacific.

00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:15.420
World War II is never
going to come to the US.

00:56:15.420 --> 00:56:17.380
Everything's going to be fine.

00:56:17.380 --> 00:56:20.260
And my dad took that job, and
then he ended up in prison camp

00:56:20.260 --> 00:56:21.130
for four years.

00:56:21.130 --> 00:56:23.410
And so I don't recommend
that, by the way.

00:56:23.410 --> 00:56:27.110
But people in the US, just
looking at it historically--

00:56:27.110 --> 00:56:30.000
and this new movie came out
about Turing, Alan Turing,

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:34.560
and everything-- people
thought the problem is so big,

00:56:34.560 --> 00:56:36.380
it won't happen.

00:56:36.380 --> 00:56:40.690
And I think we're all doing that
with respect to climate change.

00:56:40.690 --> 00:56:41.800
So talk about it.

00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:43.000
Talk about climate change.

00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:44.100
Talk about evolution.

00:56:44.100 --> 00:56:47.680
Get in fights over the Isaac
Newton's birthday holiday

00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:50.075
Christmas table.

00:56:50.075 --> 00:56:51.700
Isaac Newton was born
on Christmas day,

00:56:51.700 --> 00:56:54.680
by the way, as
reckoned in Britain.

00:56:54.680 --> 00:56:56.710
In Italy, it was the
fourth of January.

00:56:56.710 --> 00:56:58.900
They were still not
agreeing on the calendar.

00:56:58.900 --> 00:57:01.240
But I always say,
Isaac Newton's mom

00:57:01.240 --> 00:57:03.790
thought it was Christmas
day, for crying out loud.

00:57:03.790 --> 00:57:07.670
So you guys, just talk
about climate change.

00:57:07.670 --> 00:57:09.600
And then, together,
I strongly believe,

00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:11.780
as I look at history and
the greatest generation

00:57:11.780 --> 00:57:14.670
and what have you,
we can do this.

00:57:14.670 --> 00:57:16.360
We can change the world.

00:57:16.360 --> 00:57:17.730
So thank you all so much.

00:57:17.730 --> 00:57:18.630
Thank you for coming.

00:57:18.630 --> 00:57:22.880
[APPLAUSE]
