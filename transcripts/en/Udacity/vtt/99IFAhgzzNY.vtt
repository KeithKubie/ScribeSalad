00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So what I'd like you to do is update the play_pig function

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
so that it looks at the result that comes back from the strategy function,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and make sure that it's either hold or roll

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and if it's not one of those, then let's decide that what we do

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
is that that strategy automatically loses a game.

00:00:19.000 --> 09:59:59.000
So if you make an illegal move, you lose the game right there.
