due for China and and I have to go and
work on it this morning but maybe at

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080
work on it this morning but maybe at
 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.160

we can talk informally if you're

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910
we can talk informally if you're
 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.660
we can talk informally if you're
interested anyway I'm going to talk

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670
interested anyway I'm going to talk
 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.380
interested anyway I'm going to talk
about the question of infrastructure and

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390
 
 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.779
 
and of course through some of the the

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789
and of course through some of the the
 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.549
and of course through some of the the
projects that we've been involved with

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559
projects that we've been involved with
 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.100
projects that we've been involved with
principally in the in the Earth

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110
principally in the in the Earth
 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.180
principally in the in the Earth
Institute I don't know have you had the

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190
Institute I don't know have you had the
 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.849
Institute I don't know have you had the
introduction yet to know all you did

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859
introduction yet to know all you did
 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.920
introduction yet to know all you did
yeah ok steve is sort of involved with a

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930
yeah ok steve is sort of involved with a
 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.469
yeah ok steve is sort of involved with a
different set of issues and I'll explain

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479
different set of issues and I'll explain
 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.410
different set of issues and I'll explain
what we're doing in a minute but anyway

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420
what we're doing in a minute but anyway
 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.990
what we're doing in a minute but anyway
in general I mean we're in a new phase

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000
in general I mean we're in a new phase
 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.230
in general I mean we're in a new phase
as you know of global urbanization and

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240
as you know of global urbanization and
 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.780
as you know of global urbanization and
so I think we're also in a new phase of

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790
so I think we're also in a new phase of
 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.399
so I think we're also in a new phase of
trying to understand this phenomenon

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409
trying to understand this phenomenon
 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.640
trying to understand this phenomenon
which is is of course quite different

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650
which is is of course quite different
 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.660
which is is of course quite different
than then historical precedents so the

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670
than then historical precedents so the
 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.219
than then historical precedents so the
question of infrastructures is

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229
question of infrastructures is
 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.770
question of infrastructures is
fundamental and in our understanding of

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780
fundamental and in our understanding of
 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.830
fundamental and in our understanding of
infrastructure of courses has changed he

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840
infrastructure of courses has changed he
 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.740
infrastructure of courses has changed he
is changing a great deal so we will look

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750
is changing a great deal so we will look
 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:54.640
is changing a great deal so we will look
at a number of concerns

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:54.650
 
 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.700
 
basically the the lab is connected with

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710
basically the the lab is connected with
 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.830
basically the the lab is connected with
a postgraduate program in the

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840
a postgraduate program in the
 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.620
a postgraduate program in the
architecture school and with another

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630
architecture school and with another
 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.290
architecture school and with another
post graduate school a program in the

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300
post graduate school a program in the
 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.430
post graduate school a program in the
School of Engineering and Applied

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440
School of Engineering and Applied
 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.310
School of Engineering and Applied
Sciences so first of all from an

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320
Sciences so first of all from an
 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.310
Sciences so first of all from an
academic point of view it's it's really

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.320
academic point of view it's it's really
 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.910
academic point of view it's it's really
a new he represents a new series of

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920
a new he represents a new series of
 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.190
a new he represents a new series of
connections in the University and and I

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200
connections in the University and and I
 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.190
connections in the University and and I
would say in general that universities

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200
would say in general that universities
 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.540
would say in general that universities
are having to respond rather quickly too

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550
are having to respond rather quickly too
 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.360
are having to respond rather quickly too
of course changing demands in terms of

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370
of course changing demands in terms of
 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.730
of course changing demands in terms of
what we're asked to do and of course how

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740
what we're asked to do and of course how
 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.850
what we're asked to do and of course how
how especially for the urban field how

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860
how especially for the urban field how
 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.380
how especially for the urban field how
things are evolving in general so what

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390
things are evolving in general so what
 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.140
things are evolving in general so what
we're doing represents an interesting

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150
we're doing represents an interesting
 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.690
we're doing represents an interesting
case here at Columbia in terms of how to

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700
case here at Columbia in terms of how to
 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:52.010
case here at Columbia in terms of how to
to respond to the new realities we will

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020
to respond to the new realities we will
 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.570
to respond to the new realities we will
look basically at a number of precedence

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580
look basically at a number of precedence
 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.010
look basically at a number of precedence
in terms of some of the work we've been

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020
in terms of some of the work we've been
 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.500
in terms of some of the work we've been
doing this is applied research it's

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510
doing this is applied research it's
 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.340
doing this is applied research it's
messy research were kind of think tank

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350
messy research were kind of think tank
 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.890
messy research were kind of think tank
but we're also as they say a do tank

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900
but we're also as they say a do tank
 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.410
but we're also as they say a do tank
we're very involved with problem solving

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420
we're very involved with problem solving
 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:16.070
we're very involved with problem solving
of all kinds of different problems were

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080
of all kinds of different problems were
 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.050
of all kinds of different problems were
not specialize in the sense that the

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060
not specialize in the sense that the
 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.120
not specialize in the sense that the
Natural Sciences are specialized we come

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130
Natural Sciences are specialized we come
 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.949
Natural Sciences are specialized we come
up out of course the Earth Institute

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959
up out of course the Earth Institute
 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.290
up out of course the Earth Institute
which originated with the Natural

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300
which originated with the Natural
 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.860
which originated with the Natural
Sciences but what we're about is

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870
Sciences but what we're about is
 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.800
Sciences but what we're about is
something quite different and I think

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810
something quite different and I think
 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.300
something quite different and I think
without saying too much about it of

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310
without saying too much about it of
 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.699
without saying too much about it of
course as designers were very much

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709
course as designers were very much
 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.750
course as designers were very much
involved with synthesis of managing all

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760
involved with synthesis of managing all
 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.530
involved with synthesis of managing all
kinds of information not as specialists

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540
kinds of information not as specialists
 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.259
kinds of information not as specialists
in terms of the information itself but

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269
in terms of the information itself but
 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:47.270
in terms of the information itself but
as specialists in terms of the

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280
as specialists in terms of the
 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.940
as specialists in terms of the
management and of course the problem

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950
management and of course the problem
 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.910
management and of course the problem
solving aspect of what we what we do so

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920
solving aspect of what we what we do so
 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.870
solving aspect of what we what we do so
we're basically going to look at region

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880
we're basically going to look at region
 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.620
we're basically going to look at region
urban scale and then four questions

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630
urban scale and then four questions
 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:01.360
urban scale and then four questions
which are

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370
which are
 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.640
which are
is important to any city anywhere in the

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650
is important to any city anywhere in the
 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.640
is important to any city anywhere in the
world that is waste water energy and

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650
world that is waste water energy and
 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.210
world that is waste water energy and
health and and the infrastructure needs

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220
health and and the infrastructure needs
 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:15.240
health and and the infrastructure needs
but for all of these of course are

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250
 
 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:23.830
 
evolving quickly all right the origins

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840
evolving quickly all right the origins
 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.530
evolving quickly all right the origins
yeah you can probably quite read this

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:26.540
yeah you can probably quite read this
 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.790
yeah you can probably quite read this
but I'll just explain it you don't have

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800
but I'll just explain it you don't have
 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:36.250
but I'll just explain it you don't have
to memorize but the the earth institute

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260
to memorize but the the earth institute
 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.230
to memorize but the the earth institute
starts in what 94 I think so it's about

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240
starts in what 94 I think so it's about
 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.460
starts in what 94 I think so it's about
16 17 years ago by very interesting vice

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470
16 17 years ago by very interesting vice
 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.460
16 17 years ago by very interesting vice
provost in the university micro who's

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470
provost in the university micro who's
 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.650
provost in the university micro who's
now president of variable pairs on the

state he moved on to Arizona State's
 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.939
state he moved on to Arizona State's
doing some interesting work there but

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:54.949
doing some interesting work there but
 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:58.480
doing some interesting work there but
this was a very early response I think

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490
this was a very early response I think
 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.090
this was a very early response I think
in this country to the need for academic

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:01.100
in this country to the need for academic
 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.150
in this country to the need for academic
reorganization in the sciences and of

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160
reorganization in the sciences and of
 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.210
reorganization in the sciences and of
course this is a continuing topic and of

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:07.220
course this is a continuing topic and of
 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.580
course this is a continuing topic and of
course is growing in a kind of frenzied

densification overdevelopment of course

00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:37.060
densification overdevelopment of course
 

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:39.540
densification overdevelopment of course
there's been a lot of work done on

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:39.550
there's been a lot of work done on
 

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:41.819
there's been a lot of work done on
cleaning the river itself but that seems

00:10:41.819 --> 00:10:41.829
cleaning the river itself but that seems
 

00:10:41.829 --> 00:10:44.519
cleaning the river itself but that seems
to reach the ceiling in terms of

00:10:44.519 --> 00:10:44.529
to reach the ceiling in terms of
 

00:10:44.529 --> 00:10:46.949
to reach the ceiling in terms of
effectiveness so there's a whole

00:10:46.949 --> 00:10:46.959
effectiveness so there's a whole
 

00:10:46.959 --> 00:10:49.110
effectiveness so there's a whole
question of what's what's next and this

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:49.120
question of what's what's next and this
 

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.910
question of what's what's next and this
is very complicated because they're

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:50.920
is very complicated because they're
 

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:55.110

there is in fact no single database for

00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:55.120
there is in fact no single database for
 

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:58.620
there is in fact no single database for
this corridor so that's the fundamental

00:10:58.620 --> 00:10:58.630
this corridor so that's the fundamental
 

00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:00.360
this corridor so that's the fundamental
first problem which gives to the

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:00.370
first problem which gives to the
 

00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:05.519
first problem which gives to the
question of in fact the need for the

00:11:05.519 --> 00:11:05.529
question of in fact the need for the
 

00:11:05.529 --> 00:11:10.819
question of in fact the need for the
evolution of tools to do what we do and

00:11:10.819 --> 00:11:10.829
evolution of tools to do what we do and
 

00:11:10.829 --> 00:11:13.650
evolution of tools to do what we do and
amazingly you have an urbanized corridor

00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:13.660
amazingly you have an urbanized corridor
 

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:18.120
amazingly you have an urbanized corridor

its study comprehensively so of course

00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:20.860
its study comprehensively so of course

its study comprehensively so of course
in this case we were looking at the

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:23.050
in this case we were looking at the
 

00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:25.819
in this case we were looking at the
options for developing those tools

00:11:25.819 --> 00:11:25.829
options for developing those tools
 

00:11:25.829 --> 00:11:28.769
options for developing those tools
you've probably got 40 or 50 different

00:11:28.769 --> 00:11:28.779

related to urbanization has to do with

00:11:47.749 --> 00:11:47.759
related to urbanization has to do with
 

00:11:47.759 --> 00:11:51.409
related to urbanization has to do with
where the storm water outlets are on the

00:11:51.409 --> 00:11:51.419
where the storm water outlets are on the
 

00:11:51.419 --> 00:11:53.780
where the storm water outlets are on the
river so so you get a connection between

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:53.790
river so so you get a connection between
 

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:56.210
river so so you get a connection between
of course water quality and urbanization

00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:56.220
of course water quality and urbanization
 

00:11:56.220 --> 00:12:03.049
of course water quality and urbanization
which is a very new connection relative

00:12:03.049 --> 00:12:03.059
which is a very new connection relative
 

00:12:03.059 --> 00:12:08.269

Rhine Valley study which is very

00:12:14.239 --> 00:12:14.249
Rhine Valley study which is very
 

00:12:14.249 --> 00:12:17.859
Rhine Valley study which is very
interesting in Europe there's some work

00:12:17.859 --> 00:12:17.869
interesting in Europe there's some work
 

00:12:17.869 --> 00:12:21.289
interesting in Europe there's some work
in California but anyway the basic tool

00:12:21.289 --> 00:12:21.299
in California but anyway the basic tool
 

00:12:21.299 --> 00:12:23.869
in California but anyway the basic tool
is going to develop as we're speaking is

00:12:23.869 --> 00:12:23.879

sensing which the Earth Institute has a
 

00:12:28.649 --> 00:12:30.710
sensing which the Earth Institute has a
big capacity for but the connection

00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:30.720
big capacity for but the connection
 

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:33.439

between remote sensing and direct GIS

00:12:33.439 --> 00:12:33.449
between remote sensing and direct GIS
 

00:12:33.449 --> 00:12:37.129

satellite sensing so of course in the

00:12:40.489 --> 00:12:40.499
satellite sensing so of course in the
 

00:12:40.499 --> 00:12:43.519
satellite sensing so of course in the
military you can now use satellites to

00:12:43.519 --> 00:12:43.529
military you can now use satellites to
 

00:12:43.529 --> 00:12:47.299
military you can now use satellites to
read people's license plates etc as we

00:12:47.299 --> 00:12:47.309
read people's license plates etc as we
 

00:12:47.309 --> 00:12:54.159

know why I'm very careful about my life

00:12:54.159 --> 00:12:54.169
know why I'm very careful about my life
 

00:12:54.169 --> 00:12:57.139
know why I'm very careful about my life
but the question is for planning

00:12:57.139 --> 00:12:57.149
but the question is for planning
 

00:12:57.149 --> 00:13:00.829
but the question is for planning
purposes how do you move from that kind

00:13:00.829 --> 00:13:00.839
purposes how do you move from that kind
 

00:13:00.839 --> 00:13:04.599
purposes how do you move from that kind
of very raw data into manipulable

00:13:04.599 --> 00:13:04.609
of very raw data into manipulable
 

00:13:04.609 --> 00:13:09.409
of very raw data into manipulable
modeling and that right now is a hand I

00:13:09.409 --> 00:13:09.419
modeling and that right now is a hand I
 

00:13:09.419 --> 00:13:12.619
modeling and that right now is a hand I
process so of course that the next

00:13:12.619 --> 00:13:12.629
process so of course that the next
 

00:13:12.629 --> 00:13:15.319
process so of course that the next
generation of planning software will be

00:13:15.319 --> 00:13:15.329
generation of planning software will be
 

00:13:15.329 --> 00:13:20.269
generation of planning software will be
able to do that automatically so you get

00:13:20.269 --> 00:13:20.279
able to do that automatically so you get
 

00:13:20.279 --> 00:13:23.379
able to do that automatically so you get
from the satellite image to some kind of

00:13:23.379 --> 00:13:23.389
from the satellite image to some kind of
 

00:13:23.389 --> 00:13:27.679
from the satellite image to some kind of
planning model without the handwork but

00:13:27.679 --> 00:13:27.689
planning model without the handwork but
 

00:13:27.689 --> 00:13:30.169
planning model without the handwork but
I mean to put it very simply there's an

00:13:30.169 --> 00:13:30.179
I mean to put it very simply there's an
 

00:13:30.179 --> 00:13:32.389
I mean to put it very simply there's an
interesting group in berkeley that's now

00:13:32.389 --> 00:13:32.399
interesting group in berkeley that's now
 

00:13:32.399 --> 00:13:34.460
interesting group in berkeley that's now
gotten pretty far along with us so i

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:34.470
gotten pretty far along with us so i
 

00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:37.579
gotten pretty far along with us so i
suspect in five years we will be able to

00:13:37.579 --> 00:13:37.589
suspect in five years we will be able to
 

00:13:37.589 --> 00:13:39.199
suspect in five years we will be able to
deal with this problem which of course

00:13:39.199 --> 00:13:39.209
deal with this problem which of course
 

00:13:39.209 --> 00:13:40.600
deal with this problem which of course
we can't deal with it

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:40.610
we can't deal with it
 

00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:45.340
we can't deal with it
the moment here probably anywhere so

00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:45.350
the moment here probably anywhere so
 

00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:48.389
the moment here probably anywhere so
that's one kind of very large scale

00:13:48.389 --> 00:13:48.399
that's one kind of very large scale
 

00:13:48.399 --> 00:13:57.100
that's one kind of very large scale
involvement worse than some other things

00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:57.110
involvement worse than some other things
 

00:13:57.110 --> 00:14:09.370
involvement worse than some other things
oops just resistive one yeah yeah we

00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:09.380
oops just resistive one yeah yeah we
 

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:12.280
oops just resistive one yeah yeah we
work of course with the the postgraduate

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:12.290
work of course with the the postgraduate
 

00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:16.690
work of course with the the postgraduate
students and in this case just to show

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:16.700
students and in this case just to show
 

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:19.060
students and in this case just to show
the kind of breadth of issues this was a

00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:19.070
the kind of breadth of issues this was a
 

00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:23.440
the kind of breadth of issues this was a
study for the city of Vienna it was

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:23.450
study for the city of Vienna it was
 

00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:27.130
study for the city of Vienna it was
quite interesting because Vienna has a

00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:27.140
quite interesting because Vienna has a
 

00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:29.350
quite interesting because Vienna has a
very large planning capacity of course I

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:29.360
very large planning capacity of course I
 

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:32.650
very large planning capacity of course I
was probably 250 people working in their

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:37.960
was probably 250 people working in their
municipal planning department so one

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:37.970
municipal planning department so one
 

00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:40.660

somebody's you know involvement but the

00:14:51.579 --> 00:14:51.589
somebody's you know involvement but the
 

00:14:51.589 --> 00:14:54.040
somebody's you know involvement but the
question for them that that it turns out

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:54.050
question for them that that it turns out
 

00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:56.710
question for them that that it turns out
we could have quite a bit to say about

00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:56.720
we could have quite a bit to say about
 

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:58.449
we could have quite a bit to say about
was actually the periphery of the city

00:14:58.449 --> 00:14:58.459

the removal of course the the old border
 

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:15.550
the removal of course the the old border
after the fall of the Berlin Wall so

00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:15.560
after the fall of the Berlin Wall so
 

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:18.519
after the fall of the Berlin Wall so
they are experiencing an enormous amount

00:15:18.519 --> 00:15:18.529
they are experiencing an enormous amount
 

00:15:18.529 --> 00:15:21.130
they are experiencing an enormous amount
of sprawl and basically the connection

00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:21.140
of sprawl and basically the connection
 

00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:24.009
of sprawl and basically the connection
of the two cities without very much

00:15:24.009 --> 00:15:24.019
of the two cities without very much
 

00:15:24.019 --> 00:15:26.139
of the two cities without very much
experience and in spite of their very

that or even conceptualize it so that's
 

00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:39.819
that or even conceptualize it so that's
another I think general question I mean

00:15:39.819 --> 00:15:39.829
another I think general question I mean
 

00:15:39.829 --> 00:15:41.829
another I think general question I mean
these are all questions that face cities

they don't have they very difficult for
 

00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:34.269
they don't have they very difficult for
them to connect the dots for complex

00:19:34.269 --> 00:19:34.279
them to connect the dots for complex
 

00:19:34.279 --> 00:19:40.779
them to connect the dots for complex
reasons so I think that the in our case

00:19:40.779 --> 00:19:40.789
reasons so I think that the in our case
 

00:19:40.789 --> 00:19:45.909
reasons so I think that the in our case
that the first place to start is in how

yeah we almost did this in Washington DC

00:37:34.019 --> 00:37:34.029
yeah we almost did this in Washington DC
 

00:37:34.029 --> 00:37:37.289
yeah we almost did this in Washington DC
but they got cold feet at the end due to

00:37:37.289 --> 00:37:37.299
but they got cold feet at the end due to
 

00:37:37.299 --> 00:37:41.789
but they got cold feet at the end due to
course public space issues but one of

00:37:41.789 --> 00:37:41.799
course public space issues but one of
 

00:37:41.799 --> 00:37:43.349

these pods can be built for three

00:37:43.349 --> 00:37:43.359
these pods can be built for three
 

00:37:43.359 --> 00:37:45.839
these pods can be built for three
thousand dollars this was very carefully

00:37:45.839 --> 00:37:45.849
thousand dollars this was very carefully
 

00:37:45.849 --> 00:37:52.400
thousand dollars this was very carefully
engineered this is interesting this is a

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:52.410
 
 

00:37:52.410 --> 00:37:57.630
 
the application of new artificial tree

00:37:57.630 --> 00:37:57.640
the application of new artificial tree
 

00:37:57.640 --> 00:37:59.910
the application of new artificial tree
technology which has been developed in

hearing in the Earth Institute and they

00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:07.480
hearing in the Earth Institute and they
 

00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:11.390
hearing in the Earth Institute and they
there gotten pretty far along with

00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:11.400
there gotten pretty far along with
 

00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:14.010
there gotten pretty far along with
artificial trees that is machines that

00:38:14.010 --> 00:38:14.020
artificial trees that is machines that
 

00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:17.010
artificial trees that is machines that
can process co2 back into oxygen more

00:38:17.010 --> 00:38:17.020
can process co2 back into oxygen more
 

00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:19.740
can process co2 back into oxygen more
efficiently than an actual natural tree

00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:19.750
efficiently than an actual natural tree
 

00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:21.390
efficiently than an actual natural tree
so the question what but unfortunately

00:38:21.390 --> 00:38:21.400
so the question what but unfortunately
 

00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:24.120
so the question what but unfortunately
they're very ugly and of course they

00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:24.130
they're very ugly and of course they
 

00:38:24.130 --> 00:38:26.010
they're very ugly and of course they
have no sense of what to do with these

00:38:26.010 --> 00:38:26.020
have no sense of what to do with these
 

00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:28.440
have no sense of what to do with these
things in an actual place where people

00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:28.450
things in an actual place where people
 

00:38:28.450 --> 00:38:30.360
things in an actual place where people
would want to look at them so the

00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:30.370
would want to look at them so the
 

00:38:30.370 --> 00:38:32.550
would want to look at them so the
question was how then to incorporate

00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:32.560
question was how then to incorporate
 

00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:36.330
question was how then to incorporate
that technology into a public space and

00:38:36.330 --> 00:38:36.340
that technology into a public space and
 

00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:38.430
that technology into a public space and
incorporate it with rainwater harvesting

00:38:38.430 --> 00:38:38.440
incorporate it with rainwater harvesting
 

00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:41.450
incorporate it with rainwater harvesting
with natural growth this sort of thing

00:38:41.450 --> 00:38:41.460
with natural growth this sort of thing
 

00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:44.820
with natural growth this sort of thing
so I'll go very quickly here here's a

00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:44.830
so I'll go very quickly here here's a
 

00:38:44.830 --> 00:38:50.870
so I'll go very quickly here here's a
prototype for a multi scalar composting

Broadway University was very interested
in this and then they got cold feet

00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:14.370
in this and then they got cold feet
 

00:39:14.370 --> 00:39:16.650
in this and then they got cold feet
again there's always the cold feet

00:39:16.650 --> 00:39:16.660
again there's always the cold feet
 

00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:21.270
again there's always the cold feet

sooner the question what's next in terms
 

00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:53.880
sooner the question what's next in terms
of production especially of housing so

of production especially of housing so
 

00:39:53.890 --> 00:39:54.680
of production especially of housing so
that's and

00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:54.690
that's and
 

00:39:54.690 --> 00:39:57.720
that's and
here's the gas drilling thing with the

00:39:57.720 --> 00:39:57.730
here's the gas drilling thing with the
 

00:39:57.730 --> 00:39:59.820
here's the gas drilling thing with the
conflict between energy and water now

00:39:59.820 --> 00:39:59.830

for the first time in New York City

00:40:01.530 --> 00:40:01.540
for the first time in New York City
 

00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:05.370

history we always had water energy and

00:40:05.370 --> 00:40:05.380
history we always had water energy and
 

00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:08.610

with the gas drilling this is what one

00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:13.210
with the gas drilling this is what one
 

00:40:13.210 --> 00:40:15.150
with the gas drilling this is what one
of those gas fields would look like out

00:40:15.150 --> 00:40:15.160
of those gas fields would look like out
 

00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:19.500
of those gas fields would look like out
here and then finally just a couple more

00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:19.510
here and then finally just a couple more

mean no CD exists without a food system

00:40:32.210 --> 00:40:32.220
mean no CD exists without a food system
 

00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:37.920
mean no CD exists without a food system
and in the case of our work on food

00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:37.930
and in the case of our work on food
 

00:40:37.930 --> 00:40:39.840

now the last four years we started with
looking at the childhood obesity

00:40:46.770 --> 00:40:46.780
looking at the childhood obesity
 

00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:51.140
looking at the childhood obesity
question in the US which is enormous and

00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:51.150
question in the US which is enormous and
 

00:40:51.150 --> 00:40:55.770
question in the US which is enormous and
of course a huge threat to let's say the

00:40:55.770 --> 00:40:55.780
of course a huge threat to let's say the
 

00:40:55.780 --> 00:40:57.990
of course a huge threat to let's say the
health system in general because of the

00:40:57.990 --> 00:40:58.000

eight or nine years old who has diabetes
through to 65 or 70 I mean these are

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:09.010
through to 65 or 70 I mean these are
 

00:41:09.010 --> 00:41:11.180
through to 65 or 70 I mean these are
huge questions so we were asked by

00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:11.190
huge questions so we were asked by
 

00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:13.200
huge questions so we were asked by
United Health which is one of the

00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:13.210
United Health which is one of the
 

00:41:13.210 --> 00:41:15.870
United Health which is one of the
largest health providers the country to

00:41:15.870 --> 00:41:15.880
largest health providers the country to
 

00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:18.450
largest health providers the country to
look at this so why should we look at

00:41:18.450 --> 00:41:18.460
look at this so why should we look at
 

00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:22.110
look at this so why should we look at
this one you ask the doctors and they

00:41:22.110 --> 00:41:22.120
this one you ask the doctors and they
 

00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:23.820
this one you ask the doctors and they
say well we already asked the doctors

00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:23.830
say well we already asked the doctors
 

00:41:23.830 --> 00:41:25.230
say well we already asked the doctors
and they don't seem to have any good

00:41:25.230 --> 00:41:25.240
and they don't seem to have any good
 

00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:28.250
and they don't seem to have any good
answers so we might as well ask you guys

00:41:28.250 --> 00:41:28.260
answers so we might as well ask you guys
 

00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:32.160
answers so we might as well ask you guys
and of course so we move from the

00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:32.170
and of course so we move from the
 

00:41:32.170 --> 00:41:34.680
and of course so we move from the
obesity question itself which the

00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:34.690
obesity question itself which the
 

00:41:34.690 --> 00:41:36.750
obesity question itself which the
medical profession tends to blame the

00:41:36.750 --> 00:41:36.760
medical profession tends to blame the
 

00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:39.570
medical profession tends to blame the
victims saying well they shouldn't eat

00:41:39.570 --> 00:41:39.580
victims saying well they shouldn't eat
 

00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:44.430
victims saying well they shouldn't eat
so much or they should exercise war so

00:41:44.430 --> 00:41:44.440
so much or they should exercise war so
 

00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:47.460
so much or they should exercise war so
we move from that mentality to the food

00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:47.470
we move from that mentality to the food
 

00:41:47.470 --> 00:41:50.490
we move from that mentality to the food
system itself which is highly

00:41:50.490 --> 00:41:50.500
system itself which is highly
 

00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:53.000
system itself which is highly
problematic in this country

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:53.010
problematic in this country
 

00:41:53.010 --> 00:41:57.740
problematic in this country
it is elsewhere and and we move them to

00:41:57.740 --> 00:41:57.750
it is elsewhere and and we move them to
 

00:41:57.750 --> 00:42:02.990
it is elsewhere and and we move them to
the food system of New York and the the

00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:03.000
the food system of New York and the the
 

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:04.910
the food system of New York and the the
food chat of the city this was the

00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:04.920
food chat of the city this was the
 

00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:08.320
food chat of the city this was the
traditional food chat of the city until

00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:08.330
traditional food chat of the city until
 

00:42:08.330 --> 00:42:11.900
traditional food chat of the city until
the turn of the 20th century then of

00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:11.910
