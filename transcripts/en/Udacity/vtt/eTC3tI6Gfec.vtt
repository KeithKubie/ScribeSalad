00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:04.590
Here are the steps we'll employ for Phase 2 in the TextBrowser example. First

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:09.030
we're going to choose an architectural style. For the check, tech, TextBrowser,

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.340
we're going to choose a layered, implicit invocation architectural style.

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.340
We're then going to assign the components to layers in the layered architecture.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.000
Typically users events are at the bottom and percepts are at the top.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.300
Now we're going to determine dependencies among the layers, and

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.340
we're going to update the OCL into a, an equivalent, but what's called

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.380
a constructive format in which there's a single variable on the left hand side.
