00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:05.970
Okay so I know most of you guys are
probably nursing a hangover from last

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.970
night but I really need you to pay
attention for the next 10 minutes it's

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:19.289
pretty important okay there is a
question that every single person

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.199
graduating tomorrow knows the answer to
some of us more certain of this question

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:31.289
than others and many of us actually come
to Harvard to figure this out but even

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.910
if we don't know the answer it's a
question that we ask ourselves often and

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.390
it's something we spend four years
trying to figure out what am I gonna do

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.219
with my talents some of us are gonna
change lives and classrooms around the

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.860
world reimagining how education is
practiced and theorized some will use

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.449
their talents to take your patience and
cure disease many are going to become

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:03.650
lawyers and legislators still others
writers actors comics and heads of state

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:10.860
and I'd be lying if I didn't think about
this question myself but I felt more

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.409
lost about this question this is because
I like so many other students at this

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:22.500
university was lost about my place at
Harvard whether I belonged and what I

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:29.330
could possibly hope to contribute to
such a vast and hallowed institution I

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.900
am one of the nation's eleven point
three million undocumented immigrants my

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.490
father finds work as a line cook in
restaurants across New York City and my

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.380
mother finds work in beauty salons so if
you've ever eaten at a Korean restaurant

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.890
or receive the mani-pedi in New York
City congratulations

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.090
like it or not you may have partially
subsidized the education of what Fox

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:58.250
News would call an illegal alien my
parents are actually here today

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:18.470
mo- thank you, papa - don't cry I knew

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.810
early on that my talents were merely a
testament to their sacrifice a product

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.730
of their original dream to secure a
better life for me and so I knew most of

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:34.070
all that my talents were not my own
they were molded by my parents labor

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:39.830
shaped by their bowed legs and their
blistered hands my talents are

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.260
indistinguishable from their labor they
are one in the same

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.470
thus this perspective I brought with me
to Harvard gave new meaning to the

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.440
question of what am I going to do with
my talents

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.450
I felt bound to my community I felt
beholding to my undocumented people

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:02.390
particularly those in my home in Queens
my immigration status is always affected

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.200
the way that I see the world affected
the way that I envision my place in

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:12.470
society and by extension what I wanted
to do with my so-called talents and so I

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:18.920
wondered what am I gonna do with my
talents in the face of this impossible

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:25.580
question I searched for my answer at the
center of all human knowledge Widener

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:30.709
Library to be specific under Widener
there's a small yet indispensable part

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.070
of Harvard called the Pussey archives
which is home to many of the private

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:38.600
documents of distinguished Harvard
faculty I found the answer to this

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:44.030
question buried in the personal library
of John Rawls a famous political

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:49.010
philosopher at Harvard who according to
President Clinton helped the whole

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:54.860
generation of Americans revive their
faith and democracy itself and this is

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:59.690
definitely true for me at a time when
the President of the United States

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:05.180
believes that I don't belong here John
Rawls helped me envision in America

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:13.519
shaped by principles of justice fair
inclusion and human equality so Rawls

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:18.230
tells us that there's a sense in which
this question we all ask ourselves what

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:21.660
am I going to
do with my talents has hidden within it

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:27.870
a false assumption this assumption is
the commonly held belief that our

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:34.590
talents are gifts of intelligence health
wealth charm wit and abilities is

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:40.470
something we can claim as our own Rawls
challenges us to question whether our

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.599
talents are something we can truly claim
ownership over like D Hall plates or

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:49.979
that last piece of chicken breasts blow
the grill closes indeed Rawls says that

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:55.470
one's talents are merely the product of
luck an arbitrary force dispensed to

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:01.080
humans based on no moral standard
thus he argued we must think about our

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:07.050
talents as a collective asset a common
asset that must be leveraged as part of

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:12.270
a well-regulated political union ok so
now to be sure some of you were thinking

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:18.389
but these are my talents I was the one
who worked to cultivate them I was the

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:23.190
one who spent all those hours at Lamont
and I was the one who shed sweat tears

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:28.259
and peppermint Rubinoff to perfect my
abilities I deserve what flows from my

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:33.810
talents why should I think about it as a
common asset like a public restroom or

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:37.770
John Harvard's foot now hear me out hear
me out what I'm saying

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:42.750
is that thinking about our talents as a
collective asset helps us escape the

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:45.599
language that often surrounds the
conversations that we have with each

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:52.199
other at Harvard we often swim in a
culture that says talented people get

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:58.199
what they deserve right that those with
higher GPAs are smarter that those who

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:02.550
get punched by final clubs are cooler
than those who do not that those who

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:06.479
work at Goldman are more brilliant than
those who do not alright maybe that's my

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:11.310
last what isn't true but we swim in this
culture that says what you get is tied

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:20.219
to your talents in reality our talents
are products of social collaboration our

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:26.550
intelligence charm and abilities only
blossom when others believe and invest

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:30.830
in us I think this is clearest at
Harvard

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:36.050
the only thing I would venture to say is
true for every single person in our

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:42.560
class is that not one of us could have
gotten to this point on our own dining

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:46.490
hall workers nourish our bodies
librarians and archivists preserve the

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:50.810
knowledge and heritage we rely on to
write our papers and landscapers and

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:54.530
custodial staff make our campus a
beautiful place for us to completely

00:06:54.530 --> 00:07:00.110
ignore as we swipe away on tinder our TFs and professors sit down with us time

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:05.120
and time again to explain for the
hundredth time things like how a

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:10.039
protease inhibitor works or why the hell
Nietzsche was so angry indeed our

00:07:10.039 --> 00:07:14.990
talents are developed through
interaction with others in a web what

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:19.789
Rawls called a close knitted an
interconnected political community

00:07:19.789 --> 00:07:26.419
composed both of people you know but
more by people you do not and once we

00:07:26.419 --> 00:07:31.360
accept this there's no reason why the
duties we have to those we know

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:37.460
shouldn't also extend to those we do not
indeed there's no reason why the close

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:43.880
bonds of fellowship we often feel to our
family and friends shouldn't also extend

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:50.870
to those we don't know in our political
union and that's why Rawls is vision of

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:57.680
society as a political community is more
than a catchphrase when we share a

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:04.340
society your life affects mine whether
we know each other or not and we have to

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:10.509
evaluate this joint project by the hole
because if you think about it our

00:08:10.509 --> 00:08:16.310
particular positions within the web of
society come to us most of all through

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:24.289
fortune not desert therefore how we
treat everyone in our union not just

00:08:24.289 --> 00:08:30.080
those who are talented is really a
reflection of our personal values who we

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:37.519
want to care about who we want to
include and who we want to protect at

00:08:37.519 --> 00:08:41.539
Harvard we can often be blind to the
fact that we have duties to one another

00:08:41.539 --> 00:08:43.900
that demand
more from us than simple

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:50.210
non-interference, non-interference that
says i'll do with my talents what I will

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:56.600
and you do with your talents what you
will non-interference that says we

00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:00.680
should draw the line of membership in
our society only around those who

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:08.230
possess talents on the contrary we have
a positive responsibility to others a

00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:15.230
duty to liberate those who are unable to
wonder what am I going to do with my

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:20.690
talents and I know this isn't easy it's
not easy because it demands that we

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:26.840
reject this notion that we can truly own
our talents it demands that we step up

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:34.610
and own our good fortune enough to give
its fruits away but if it's any

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:38.930
consolation there's a reason that the
inscription facing you as you leave the

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:47.180
yard says depart to serve better thy
country and mankind not depart to serve

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:55.880
better thyself and I can thus I believe
truly taking this adage seriously and

00:09:55.880 --> 00:10:01.490
taking it to heart requires us to ask
ourselves a slightly different form of

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:05.950
the question we all know the answer to

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:15.730
what am I going to do for others with my
talents thank you

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:20.730
you
