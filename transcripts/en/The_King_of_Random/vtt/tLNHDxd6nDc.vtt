You've probably seen dry-ice before, but did
you know you can make it? In this project

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:18.180
you'll learn how to make some portable and
"on-demand" dry ice using a pillow case and

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.720
a fire extinguisher.

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:40.350
For this project, I picked up this CO2 fire
extinguisher from a local fire equipment servicing

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.820
company. It's a 15lb extinguisher they had
sitting in storage, and they said I could

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.100
have it for free. It even came fully charged
with 15 lbs of food grade CO2. Now these are special

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.429
extinguishers typically found in restaurant
kitchens, mechanical rooms, or rooms with

00:00:55.429 --> 00:00:59.589
sensitive equipment like computers. You can
know they're charged with carbon dioxide by

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:04.140
stickers like these, or by holes punched in
the servicing label. They also tend to have

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.729
an extremely large discharge horn and no pressure
gauges. The operation is pretty simple. Just

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:13.870
remove the locking pin from the handle, and
squeeze down when ready. The tank is full

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:19.530
of liquid CO2, but it comes out as a gas and
little chunks of dry-ice snow. All the residue

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.670
quickly evaporates leaving everything as clean
as when you started. It just makes it a little

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.140
harder to breathe. Ok, now here's the trick
to making dry ice. Take a cloth bag like a

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.680
pillow case, and wrap it over the end of the
discharge horn, pulling up all the loose material,

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.590
then go ahead and give it a blast. The vapor
is really cold, and gets trapped at the bottom

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.270
of the sack. There's also some dry-ice sticking
to the discharge horn, so wipe that off as

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.320
you're pulling it out. Alright, let's see
what we got. Now it's probably a good idea

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:53.500
to be wearing insulated gloves when handling
dry-ice because it's -78ÂºC. It is extremely

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.100
cold, but I found if I move it around quickly
enough, it doesn't sit in one place long enough

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.230
to give me a frost-bite. Digging down to the
bottom of the sack you'll find larger clumps

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:06.360
that look something like a dry-ice snowball.
Now these are sublimating directly from a

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.500
solid to a gas, so to preserve them a little
longer I'm going to transfer them into a little

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.540
bowl like this one. This should make them
a bit more convenient to work with, as well

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.580
as keep the overall temperature low enough
to slow down the reaction. Alright, the bowl

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.370
is full, and there's our batch of dry-ice
ready for experiments. Using something like

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.930
the bottom of a glass or a jar, we can compact
the snow to make it as dense as possible,

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.370
then gently set a lid overtop. If you put
the lid on too tight, the pressure of the

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.330
gas will build and blow it off. Let's try
the classic experiment of placing a few chunks

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.760
in a container and adding some water. This
is how we get the flowing fog you'd see in

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.700
something like a halloween witches brew. This
can also be poured out for a cascading waterfall

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.790
effect. And look, there's no mess to clean
up. If we add some dry ice to a container

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.450
of warm water, and screw on a lid with a small
vent hole in it, we get a little CO2 geyser

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.709
rocketing out of the top. Shaking it will
speed up the reaction and increase it to a

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.120
pressure that could possibly be used to drive
a small motor. Well now you know how to make

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.459
dry-ice whenever you need it, as long as you've
got access to a carbon dioxide fire extinguisher.

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:14.069
Now making fog is great, but there are crazier
things that you can do with dry-ice that you'll

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:18.730
find in another project. Like making a poor
mans version of liquid nitrogen, that's cold

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.349
enough to flash freeze an orange. You'll also
see how dry-ice is used in making a tasty

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:28.150
batch of carbonated ice-cream. Well that's
it for now. If you liked this project, perhaps

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.550
you'll like some of my others. Check them
