00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.440
Emotions can be intense and overwhelming.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.000
When prolonged, these feelings can develop into anxiety and depression.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.080
Blurring our judgement, this can affect the individual's ability to make decisions.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:27.860
Unfortunately, when things feel like too much, the individual may develop unhealthy escapist tendencies, some of which involve self-harm.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:35.080
This is considered a maladaptive coping strategy, which only serves to continue the disorder, rather than healing it.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:42.520
According to Mental Health America, roughly 15 percent of teens and adolescents have reported committing self-injury.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.080
If you believe someone may be self harming, we pray that things will get better for them, and encourage you to help them.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:55.680
In our description box below, we've provided some resources that may come in handy, such as the crisis text line.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.860
Here are five signs of self harming that might not always be obvious.

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:08.360
1. They wear long sleeve shirts and pants in hot weather

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.660
Although people may wear these articles of clothing to prevent getting sunburns or mosquito bites,

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:19.689
if someone does it consistently, even when they go swimming, then it might indicate they're trying to hide their wounds.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:27.260
People who self-harm may be ashamed of their actions, and often have a hard time receiving help, fearing that they will be judged.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:34.240
So, they do whatever it takes to keep it a secret, even if it means wearing a jacket when it's 90 degrees outside.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.860
2. They scratch or rub at certain body areas

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.520
This indicates that there's more going on than just a small cut.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:50.820
People who self-harm on a regular basis develop wounds that take a long time to heal, because they may keep agitating it.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.610
As scar tissue forms, the wounded area often becomes itchy.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.240
They may also be selective and choose a specific area to self-harm,

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:05.640
such as their wrists, arm, or thigh, to get the same feeling of release each time they hurt themselves.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.480
3. They have unpredictable mood swings, and trouble controlling their impulses

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.640
People who experience psychological conditions such as mood disorders and trauma

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.000
are more likely to self-harm, because it's hard for them to regulate their emotions.

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:28.260
Signs include: getting agitated often, breaking down frequently, or seeming easily offended.

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:35.100
It's also important to take notice if they crack jokes about self-harm, because chances are they're being serious.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.440
4. They start to withdraw themselves from you and others

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:48.440
People who self-harm often start to isolate themselves from their friends and family, but it's not just their social life they put on pause.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:54.260
If you catch them stop doing their favorite hobbies, this is also a strong indicator that something is wrong.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.220
5. They have frequent episodes of existential crises

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:07.620
When someone keeps asking themselves who they are or what the meaning of life is, they aren't doing it to be drama queens or kings.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.980
Inside, something has snapped that is preventing them from feeling stable.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:18.280
People who self-harm often struggle with low self-esteem issues, and have a hard time finding hope.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.080
They might feel unmotivated, confused, lonely, and misunderstood.

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.800
If you notice that their symptoms of anxiety and depression have worsened,

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.040
please don't leave their side, and let them know that professional help is available.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.240
