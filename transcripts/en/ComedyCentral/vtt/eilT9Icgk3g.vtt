WE'RE BACK IN TALKING WITH
THE FIRST MINISTER OF

00:00:03.069 --> 00:00:04.537 size:75% position:38% line:85%
SCOTLAND, NICOLA STUGON.

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:07.940 size:75% position:38% line:91%
NOW DAVID CAMERON IS THE
HEAD OF THE CONSERVATIVE

00:00:07.973 --> 00:00:09.375 align:start position:0% line:85%
PARTY.

00:00:09.408 --> 00:00:12.412 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU HAVE BROUGHT, FIRST OF
ALL, DEMOLISHED LABOUR

00:00:12.445 --> 00:00:22.688 line:91%
ED MILLI BAND AND THE LABOUR
PARTY, ARE THEY ANGRY AT SNP OR

00:00:22.721 --> 00:00:24.924 align:start position:0% line:91%
ARE THEY MORE DISAPPOINTED
IN SNP AND MILLIBAND.

00:00:24.957 --> 00:00:27.627 align:start position:0% line:85%
DID YOU OUTFLANK THEM?

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.961 align:start position:0% line:85%
HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?

00:00:28.994 --> 00:00:32.298 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WELL, THEY'RE
DISAPPOINTED IN MILLIBAND,

00:00:32.331 --> 00:00:36.269 size:88% position:44% line:91%
BUT THEY ARE EXPRESSING THAT
BY AT THE SNP IT IS EASIER

00:00:36.302 --> 00:00:39.238 line:91%
TO BLAME THE SNP THAT WE GOT
DEMOLISHED IN THE ELECTION THAN

00:00:39.271 --> 00:00:41.674 align:start position:0% line:91%
TO SPEAK UP FOR THE REASONS WHY
THEY GOT DEMOLISHED.

00:00:41.707 --> 00:00:46.679 size:88% position:44% line:91%
WHAT DOES THE SNP DO TO BEAT
LABOR SO COMPREHENSIVELY, WE

00:00:46.712 --> 00:00:48.381 size:75% position:38% line:91%
STARTED ACTING MORE LIKE
PEOPLE EXPECT THE LABOUR

00:00:48.414 --> 00:00:50.116 align:start position:0% line:85%
PARTY TO ASK.

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:52.985 line:85%
WE STOOD UP AGAINST AUSTERITY.

00:00:53.018 --> 00:00:56.322 align:start position:0% line:91%
WE SAID, YOU KNOW, WAHAT? 
DON'T WANT TO SPEND $100 BILLION

00:00:56.355 --> 00:00:57.757 align:start position:0% line:91%
ON NEW TRIDENT NUCLEAR
MISSILES.

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.860 line:91%
WE'D RATHER DO SOMETHING RADICAL
AND INVEST THAT IN HEALTHCARE,

00:01:00.893 --> 00:01:04.263 align:start position:0% line:91%
IN EDUCATION, IN GIVING KIDS
THE BEST START IN LIFE.

00:01:04.296 --> 00:01:07.333 size:88% position:44% line:91%
YOU HAVE TO GO BACK 10 OR 20
YEARS, THESE ARE THE THINGS

00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:10.303 line:91%
LABOROUR POLITICIANS USED TO 
SAY IN THE U.K., BUT NOT ANY

00:01:10.336 --> 00:01:11.704 align:start position:0% line:85%
MORE. 

00:01:11.737 --> 00:01:13.439 align:start position:0% line:91%
THEY OUT RIGHT-WING THE
CONSERVATIVES, AND THAT HASN'T

00:01:13.472 --> 00:01:15.808 align:start position:0% line:85%
WORKED FOR THEM.

00:01:15.841 --> 00:01:19.712 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: THEIR STRATEGY HAS BEEN
TO PAINT SNP AS VERY NAIVE,

00:01:19.745 --> 00:01:22.381 align:start position:0% line:91%
THAT YOU WILL NEVER BE ABLE
TO SURVIVE WITHOUT US.

00:01:22.414 --> 00:01:25.685 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO
DELIVER ON THE PROMISES THAT

00:01:25.718 --> 00:01:26.986 align:start position:0% line:85%
YOU HAVE MADE.

00:01:27.019 --> 00:01:30.123 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHAT HAS BEEN FROM THE
ELECTION UNTIL NOW, WHAT HAS

00:01:30.156 --> 00:01:33.793 size:84% position:42% line:91%
BEEN THE MOST CHALLENGING
PART OF DELIVERING ON THOSE

00:01:33.826 --> 00:01:37.330 size:81% position:41% line:91%
PROMISES AND WHAT HAS BEEN
THE PART THAT HAS GONE AS

00:01:37.363 --> 00:01:38.598 size:84% position:42% line:85%
SMOOTHLY AS YOU WOULD LIKE.

00:01:38.631 --> 00:01:40.800 line:91%
&gt;&gt; IT'S ONLY A FEW WE CANS FROM
THE ELECTION, ONE OF THE THINGS

00:01:40.833 --> 00:01:43.569 align:start position:0% line:91%
WE DIDN'T EXPECT, NOBODY ACROSS
THE U.K. DID EXPECT EXPECTE

00:01:43.602 --> 00:01:44.704 align:start position:0% line:91%
DAVID CAMERON TO HAVE A
MAJORITY.

00:01:44.737 --> 00:01:46.806 size:84% position:42% line:91%
WE THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE A
HOME PARLIAMENT WHERE THE

00:01:46.839 --> 00:01:49.342 align:start position:0% line:91%
SNP MIGHT HOLD THE BALANCE,
DAVID CAMERON'S GOT A MAJORITY,

00:01:49.375 --> 00:01:53.179 align:start position:0% line:91%
THAT'S GOING TO  BE MORE
DIFFICULT TO WIN REAL PROGRESS,

00:01:53.212 --> 00:01:56.549 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT WE HAVE A CLEVER, TALENTED
BUNCH OF MPs THAT WILL MAKE

00:01:56.582 --> 00:02:03.623 size:84% position:42% line:91%
SCOTLAND'S VOICE HEARD AND
WE-- YOU KNOW, THE SNP WITH

00:02:03.656 --> 00:02:07.593 size:88% position:44% line:91%
THE GOVERNMENT IN SCOTLAND
AND THE DEVOLVED PARLIAMENT,

00:02:07.626 --> 00:02:11.797 align:start position:0% line:91%
WE'VE BEEN THE GOVERNMENT FOR
EIGHT YEARS, AND WE'VE KEPT MOST

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.867 align:start position:0% line:91%
OF OUR PROMISES, DONE REALLY
GOOD THINGS FOR SCOTLAND.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.837 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND IN EACH ELECTION, WE SEEM
TO GET MORE POPULAR.

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.573 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO WE KEEP TRYING TO DO OUR
BEST FOR SCOTLAND, AND HOPEFULLY

00:02:20.606 --> 00:02:21.741 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE PEOPLE OF SCOTLAND WILL KEEP
VOTING FOR US.

00:02:21.774 --> 00:02:25.111 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: IF THE DREAM COMES TO
PASS FOR YOU, AND --

00:02:25.144 --> 00:02:26.746 size:81% position:41% line:85%
&gt;&gt; THIS IS THE DREAM, JON.

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:33.019 align:start position:0% line:85%
(APPLAUSE)

00:02:33.052 --> 00:02:34.921 size:84% position:42% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: MAY I SAY SOMETHING
TO YOU AN I MEAN THIS FROM

00:02:34.954 --> 00:02:36.255 align:start position:0% line:85%
THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART.

00:02:36.288 --> 00:02:40.560 align:start position:0% line:85%
DREAM BIGGER.

00:02:40.593 --> 00:02:41.694 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; YOU'RE SO HUMBLE.

00:02:41.728 --> 00:02:43.629 size:88% position:44% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: WHEN YOU DID BACK TO
SCOTLAND, I DON'T EVEN THINK

00:02:43.662 --> 00:02:44.630 align:start position:0% line:85%
IT'S AVAILABLE THERE.

00:02:44.663 --> 00:02:45.731 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IT'S  ABOUT 4:00 IN THE
MORNING.

00:02:45.764 --> 00:02:49.802 size:84% position:42% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: I KNOW THAT, I HAVE
MY CLOCKS HERE ALL SET FOR

00:02:49.835 --> 00:02:51.003 align:start position:0% line:85%
SCOTISH TIME.

00:02:51.036 --> 00:02:51.904 line:91%
&gt;&gt; BUT YOU CAN EXPECT A SURGE
OF VIEWERS IN SCOTLAND AND THE

00:02:51.937 --> 00:02:54.840 align:start position:0% line:91%
U.K., WITH ALL ALL MY POLITICAL
OPPONENTS.

00:02:54.873 --> 00:02:57.043 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: THEY'RE GOING TO BE
TRYING TO FIND --

00:02:57.076 --> 00:02:59.045 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; LOOKING FOR WAYS TO HUMILIATE
ME.

00:02:59.078 --> 00:03:01.080 size:78% position:39% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: THIS IS EXCITING.

00:03:01.113 --> 00:03:03.783 align:start position:0% line:91%
OH, YEAH, WELL, YOU'RE
GOING DOWN.

00:03:03.816 --> 00:03:06.419 align:start position:0% line:85%
I GOT NOTHING.

00:03:06.452 --> 00:03:09.021 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT IT IS, I FIND IT
INTERESTING, IF THE DREAM

00:03:09.054 --> 00:03:12.959 size:88% position:44% line:91%
LIVES, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE HAVE
TO BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO THIS

00:03:12.992 --> 00:03:17.997 align:start position:0% line:91%
IDEA THAT THEY STILL,
SCOTLAND GETS MORE MONEY,

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.266 align:start position:0% line:91%
DOESN'T IT, FROM ENGLAND,
FROM WESTMINSTER.

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:25.671 size:88% position:44% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, THE U.K. LIKE
AMERICA WAS IN DEFICIT SO WE

00:03:25.704 --> 00:03:28.474 size:84% position:42% line:91%
SPEND MORE THAN WE BRING IN
IN TAXES. SCOTLAND IS IN

00:03:28.507 --> 00:03:30.409 size:88% position:44% line:91%
THE SAME POSITION, BUT THAT
DOESN'T MEAN IT'S SUBSIDIZED

00:03:30.442 --> 00:03:33.246 align:start position:0% line:85%
BY WESTMINSTER.

00:03:33.279 --> 00:03:35.948 align:start position:0% line:91%
EVERY SINGLE YEAR, FOR
ABOUT 30 YEARS NOW, WE IN

00:03:35.981 --> 00:03:39.318 line:91%
SCOTLAND HAVE GENERATED MORE
TAX PER HEAD OF POPULATION THAN

00:03:39.351 --> 00:03:42.154 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE U.K. BECAUSE WE'VE GOT A  
STRONG PRODUCTIVE ECONOMY.

00:03:42.187 --> 00:03:43.956 align:start position:0% line:85%
WE WORK PRETTY HARD.

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:45.358 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt;  Jon: 1.9% TO, I BELIEVE,
.9%.

00:03:45.391 --> 00:03:47.526 size:75% position:38% line:85%
&gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT SUBSIDIZED.

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:49.462 align:start position:0% line:91%
WE'RE MORE THAN CAPABLE OF
STANDING ON OUR OWN.

00:03:49.495 --> 00:03:51.063 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: DO YOU LIKE THE
STATS.

00:03:51.096 --> 00:03:52.465 size:81% position:41% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I HAVE NO IDEA IF THEY
ARE TRUE, I THINK YOU JUST

00:03:52.498 --> 00:03:54.367 align:start position:0% line:85%
MADE THEM UP.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.569 size:81% position:41% line:85%
YOU COULD BE A POLITICIAN.

00:03:56.602 --> 00:03:58.638 line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: LET ME TELL YOU THIS,
I BELIEVE WE MADE THEM UP.

00:03:58.671 --> 00:03:59.739 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YOU WOULD BE A REALLY
GREAT POLITICIAN.

00:03:59.772 --> 00:04:02.041 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: THANK YOU VERY MUCH,
I APPRECIATE THAT.

00:04:02.074 --> 00:04:05.645 align:start position:0% line:91%
IF YOU WERE TO GET THE
DREAM-- DO STILL DREAM OF

00:04:05.678 --> 00:04:07.446 align:start position:0% line:91%
THAT SELF-DETERMINATION,
WOULD YOU STILL BE A PART OF

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:10.283 size:88% position:44% line:91%
U.K., A PART OF THE EUROPEAN
UNION WHAT WOULD YOU WANT TO

00:04:10.316 --> 00:04:11.450 align:start position:0% line:85%
DO.

00:04:11.483 --> 00:04:13.986 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YES TO BE PART OF THE
EUROPEAN UNION.

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:15.588 size:81% position:41% line:91%
ONE OF THE REALLY WORRYING
THINGS ABOUT DAVID CAMERON

00:04:15.621 --> 00:04:19.125 size:81% position:41% line:91%
MIGHT BE ABOUT TO TAKE THE
U.K. OUT OF THE EUROPEAN

00:04:19.158 --> 00:04:20.259 align:start position:0% line:85%
UNION.

00:04:20.292 --> 00:04:22.028 size:78% position:39% line:91%
THAT WOULD BE DEVASTATING
FOR SCOTLAND AND THE U.K.

00:04:22.061 --> 00:04:24.563 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO HE WITH WANT TO BE PART
OF THE EUROPEAN UNION.

00:04:24.596 --> 00:04:27.166 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND IF SCOTLAND BECAME
INDEPENDENT WE WOULDN'T BE

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:30.403 size:88% position:44% line:91%
PART OF THE UNITED KINGDOM
ANY MORE, BUT WE WOULD STILL

00:04:30.436 --> 00:04:31.837 align:start position:0% line:91%
BE PART OF THE BRITISH
AISLES.

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.807 size:88% position:44% line:91%
SO SCOTLAND, WALES, ENGLAND,
NORTHERN ISLAND, A FAMILY OF

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.010 align:start position:0% line:91%
NATIONS AND WE CAN BE A
FAMILY OF NATIONS EVEN IF

00:04:38.043 --> 00:04:39.345 size:75% position:38% line:85%
SCOTLAND IS INDEPENDENT.

00:04:39.378 --> 00:04:42.281 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU KNOW MY GRANDMOTHER WAS
ENGLISH, MANY PEOPLE IN

00:04:42.314 --> 00:04:43.616 align:start position:0% line:91%
SCOTLAND HAVE FAMILY IN
ENGLAND.

00:04:43.649 --> 00:04:46.085 align:start position:0% line:91%
LOTS OF PEOPLE IN ENGLAND HAVE
FAMILY IN SCOTLAND.

00:04:46.118 --> 00:04:47.620 align:start position:0% line:91%
WE'VE GOT REALLY STRONG
LINKS.

00:04:47.653 --> 00:04:49.388 size:78% position:39% line:85%
WE'VE GOT SHARED HISTORY.

00:04:49.421 --> 00:04:50.422 align:start position:0% line:91%
THOSE LINKS WILL NEVER BE
BROKEN.

00:04:50.456 --> 00:04:52.458 align:start position:0% line:91%
WE JUST WANT TO STAND ON OUR
OWN TWO FEET AND MAKE

00:04:52.491 --> 00:04:53.492 align:start position:0% line:85%
OUR OWN DECISIONS.

00:04:53.526 --> 00:04:55.795 size:78% position:39% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: WE FEEL THAT WAY
HERE ABOUT NEW JERSEY AND

00:04:55.828 --> 00:05:02.702 size:84% position:42% line:91%
WHERE WE'RE-- WE HAVE A LOT
OF BLOOD TIES BUT THE TRUTH

00:05:02.735 --> 00:05:08.040 size:84% position:42% line:85%
IS, IF WE LOST THEM -- MEH.

00:05:08.073 --> 00:05:09.308 size:75% position:38% line:85%
&gt;&gt; I THINK IT'S A SHAME.

00:05:09.341 --> 00:05:11.310 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: IT IS A BIT OF A
SHAME.

00:05:11.343 --> 00:05:13.779 size:84% position:42% line:85%
ARE YOU GOING TO GO TO D.C.

00:05:13.812 --> 00:05:18.818 size:88% position:44% line:91%
AND TALK TO OUR POLITICIANS,
WHAT IS YOUR-- TO TALK ABOUT

00:05:18.851 --> 00:05:22.121 align:start position:0% line:91%
HOW AUSTERITY DEVASTATES THE
COUNTRY, HOW IT IS A

00:05:22.154 --> 00:05:23.956 size:84% position:42% line:91%
DIFFICULT POLICY, HOW IT IS
ONE THAT IS NOT THE RIGHT

00:05:23.989 --> 00:05:24.924 align:start position:0% line:85%
WAY OUT.

00:05:24.957 --> 00:05:26.058 align:start position:0% line:91%
ENGLAND HAS SUFFERED AND
AUSTERITY.

00:05:26.092 --> 00:05:28.461 size:84% position:42% line:91%
THE THING THAT STRUCK ME AS
THE MOST UNUSUAL ABOUT THIS

00:05:28.494 --> 00:05:31.764 align:start position:0% line:91%
ELECTION WAS AUSTERITY
POLICIES SEEM VERY UNPOPULAR

00:05:31.797 --> 00:05:35.735 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND YET CAMERON AND THE TORYS
WON.

00:05:35.768 --> 00:05:38.137 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THAT'S BECAUSE ED
MILLIBAND AND LABOUR DIDN'T

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:40.439 align:start position:0% line:91%
STAND UP AND GIVE AN
ALTERNATIVE.

00:05:40.472 --> 00:05:42.775 align:start position:0% line:91%
THEY PROMISED MORE OF THE
SAME, MORE OR LESS.

00:05:42.808 --> 00:05:44.343 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND PEOPLE WANTED AN ALTERNATIVE
TO THAT.

00:05:44.376 --> 00:05:47.513 size:88% position:44% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: DOW REMEMBER, IN THE
ELECTION WHERE AL GORE LOST

00:05:47.546 --> 00:05:53.486 align:start position:0% line:91%
TO GEORGE W. BUSH, OR THEY
TIED, NOT THAT IT HAD

00:05:53.519 --> 00:05:54.320 size:84% position:42% line:85%
CONSEQUENCES FOR THE WORLD.

00:05:54.353 --> 00:05:55.421 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; NOT VERY MANY.

00:05:55.454 --> 00:05:57.857 size:84% position:42% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: BUT RALPH NADER WAS
THE SPOILER, AND EVERYBODY

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:00.893 align:start position:0% line:91%
WAS MAD AT RALPH NADER, ARE
YOU GUYS IN THE SPOILER

00:06:00.926 --> 00:06:04.964 align:start position:0% line:91%
POSITION, COULD CAMERON HAVE
GOTTEN THAT MAJORITY.

00:06:04.997 --> 00:06:07.433 size:78% position:39% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THERE WERE NO HANGING
CHADS IN THE U.K. GENERAL

00:06:07.466 --> 00:06:08.567 align:start position:0% line:85%
ELECTION.

00:06:08.601 --> 00:06:13.105 size:88% position:44% line:91%
EVEN IF LABOUR HAD WON EVERY
SINGLE SEAT IN SCOTLAND, IF

00:06:13.138 --> 00:06:15.975 size:84% position:42% line:91%
