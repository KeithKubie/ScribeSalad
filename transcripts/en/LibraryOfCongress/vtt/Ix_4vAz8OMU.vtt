00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:19.770
&gt;&gt; I'm Jennifer Cutting,
folklife specialist

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.060
at the American Folklife Center
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.820
It's September 20, 2018 and
we're here interviewing some

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.940
of our artists from tonight's
Homegrown Series Archive

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.140
Challenge Sampler Concert that's
taking place tonight at 7:30

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.350
in the Coolidge Auditorium.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.760
And we have with us the group
that's going to be first

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.920
up in the concert, the
Ship's Company Chanteymen.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.690
And we only have two
of the Chanteymen,

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.520
we'll talk about
the others later

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.280
but with us right now
is the business manager

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.280
of Ship's Company
Chanteymen, Myron Peterson.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.550
We also have folklife
specialist and writer/editor

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.870
from the American Folklife
Center, Steve Winick,

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.070
who's going to guest
tonight with Ship's Company.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.370
So welcome.

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:13.670
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:14.970
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.140
&gt;&gt; And I guess the first
question I had for you Myron,

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.270
is I understand that Ship's
Company Chanteymen is part

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.090
of a larger organization
called Ship's Company,

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.970
and I was wondering if you could
tell us what the relationship is

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.980
between Ship's Company
Chanteymen and Ship's Company,

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.780
the larger organization.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.000
And how Ship's Company
Chanteymen came to be.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.660
&gt;&gt; Ship's Company Incorporated
is a non-profit organization,

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:43.980
incorporate in the
state of Maryland,

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:49.010
and we do historic presentations
and, centered around the life

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.820
of the sailor from
the early wars period,

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.020
the American Revolution,
predominantly now the War

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.470
of 1812, and also for
the American Civil War.

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.450
And this started about 35
years ago on, doing programs

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.190
on the Constellation in
Baltimore, and at that time,

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.910
the ship was considered
the original 1797 frigate.

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.900
We know now that that is
not the case, it's a rebuild

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.230
from the 1850's, and so the
ship did see service during the

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.000
American Civil War
so the group decided

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.600
to expand out into Civil War.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.430
And for a while that almost
become the primary focus

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:26.730
but there were a number of us

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.670
who really enjoyed
the early wars period,

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.310
and as the bicentennial of
the War of 1812 approached,

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:38.040
we got a much better research
and understanding of the navy

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.400
of the War of 1812, building

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.320
on what it was during
the American Revolution,

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.500
during the Quasi-War with France
during the first Tripolitan War.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.800
&gt;&gt; Mm hmm.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.090
&gt;&gt; In between shows
on Constellation

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.790
and in the early days when we
were still doing Quasi-War,

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.200
some of us would you
know, spend the time

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.570
between our doing gun drill,
which was the predominant show,

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.790
just singing to entertain
ourselves and it was to say hey,

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.570
we actually don't sound too bad

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:06.180
and so a small group
of that got together.

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.790
We shanghaied a few other
people from the folk community,

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.640
notably K.C. King who had been
a member of the Boarding Party.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.940
&gt;&gt; Oh yes.

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.880
&gt;&gt; And formed the Ship's
Company Chanteymen in 1996.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.150
So, and we started you know,
the usual, we'll do this for fun

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.800
and exposure, and now you know,

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.240
we do this for money,
we're mercenaries.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.760
&gt;&gt; Okay, and what kind of
repertoire do you focus on?

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.900
&gt;&gt; We focus on nautical
songs, we like songs

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.600
with a relationship to sailing,
the sea, and they can be modern

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.820
so we can go into steam and
diesel as well, we don't mind.

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.950
But that, we like
that relationship

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:52.450
between the sailors
and the song.

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.130
Now some of it is, a tavern
song from the early periods,

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.500
you'll see that occasionally
where we're singing.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.920
What was popular because sea
chanteys as we understand it,

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.030
mostly evolved in the later
part of the 19th century.

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.270
There are very few chanteys
from the very early periods.

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:14.160
A chantey is used to
coordinate work onboard ship,

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.020
navy ships especially;
they didn't like them,

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:19.530
because the first command
in the navy is silence.

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.740
So you've got to be able to hear
commands and they had man power.

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.130
The merchant ships
on the other hand,

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.250
didn't have the man power
you know, a lot of people,

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:29.650
so they had to coordinate
the work more

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.170
and that's the chanteyman and --

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:32.710
&gt;&gt; Oh, I see.

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.370
Now I understand that
you were in the navy

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.280
for over 20 years yourself.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.580
&gt;&gt; That's correct.

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:39.880
&gt;&gt; As, what was your position?

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.360
&gt;&gt; I was a Russian interpreter
for the navy, I was trained

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.050
by the navy, and attend the
rank of chief petty officer.

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.010
I retired in 1996 so just before
the Chanteymen started so,

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.260
a little more free with my time.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.500
Before that I was deploying
at the will of the navy,

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.420
on board various ships,
a lot of submarines.

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:03.020
&gt;&gt; I was wondering was music
part of your daily life

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.340
in any way while
you were in the nav?

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.730
&gt;&gt; Not particularly
although on one

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:12.580
or two trips there would be
people who would get together

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.570
and you know, somebody would
have a guitar, and they'd sing

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:17.570
and you know, it was a
way to pass the time,

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:21.590
especially when you're working,
in my case, working twelve hours

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.900
with twelve hours off every
day, but there's nothing to do.

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.200
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.940
&gt;&gt; So singing, like I
said, but it was very rare.

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:33.500
Most everybody, the music
involved, later especially,

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.800
of a set of headsets and a tape.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.390
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Gotcha.

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:44.520
Well, moving over the Steve
now, I know that you did most

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:49.450
of the research for tonight's
performance, which is convenient

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:52.580
because you work in the
American Folklife Center.

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:56.250
Tell me a little about
the collections you used

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:59.480
and why you chose the
songs that you did.

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.910
&gt;&gt; Alright I'll say, first off,
that I am the writer and editor

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:06.010
in the American Folklife Center
here at the Library of Congress,

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:08.550
but I'm also a long-time member
of Ship's Company Chanteymen.

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:11.650
I've been kind of on the
inactive list for a while

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:13.750
so I haven't been doing a
lot of gigs with the group,

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.950
but I have been a
member of the group

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:18.580
for over 10 years now I guess.

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:22.370
And because of that,
when this idea came

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:26.460
up to have the Chanteymen
in the Archive Challenge,

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:27.770
it sort of made sense
because I was kind

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:29.120
of the inside guy, right?

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.400
I already worked here and
I knew the collections

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:36.690
so the question was, what would
be the best songs for us to do.

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:40.740
Two of them come from the James
Madison Carpenter collection

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:44.290
and that's partly because that
collection has been getting more

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:46.820
attention lately because
it's been digitized

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:49.950
by The American Folklife
Center, and placed online

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:53.420
at the Ralph Vaughan Williams
Memorial Library in England,

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:56.300
which is part of the English
Folk Dance and Song Society,

00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:00.640
and so during that process
of them putting it online

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:03.340
and us getting them the
digital files, we were all kind

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.900
of working with the
collection somewhat.

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:09.290
And so I became familiar with
some of the pieces in there

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:11.500
and they were really
interesting pieces.

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:15.220
Carpenter was an American
who collected both in the US

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:19.090
and in Britain in the late '20s
and early '30s, which is kind

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:22.560
of an underrepresented time
in folklore collecting.

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:25.430
And the two songs that I chose,

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:29.220
one is a very interesting
version of Blow the Man Down,

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:32.310
which is a well-known sea
chantey that everyone does

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:34.170
in the sea chantey scene

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:35.810
but it's a completely
different version

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:38.140
than anyone else ever does.

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:42.440
Because Carpenter was very
interested in sea chanteys

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.700
and in fact wrote his doctoral
dissertation on nautical songs,

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:48.730
but his professor that he
was writing this doctoral

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:51.790
dissertation for, was
George Lyman Kittredge

00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:54.780
who was the student of
Francis James Child,

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:58.180
who was the preeminent ballad
scholar of the 19th century

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:01.340
after whom we even have a
category of ballads names,

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:05.610
so we all talk about the Child
ballads in folklore circles.

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:09.570
And so what Carpenter discovered
was that one of these versions

00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:13.340
of Blow the Man Down,
has lyrics of the verses

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:16.300
that are a Child ballad, a Child
ballad was actually adapted

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:18.340
into a version of
Blow the Man Down.

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:19.640
And this interested him so much,

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:21.790
he collected it three
times actually;

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:24.870
twice in New York
and once in Wales.

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:28.000
And so that was one
that I thought stood

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.880
out from the collection
for all those reasons.

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:33.770
Partly because everyone would
be somewhat familiar with it,

00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:36.470
but not familiar at
all with this version.

00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:42.140
&gt;&gt; And you have blended verses
from different field recordings

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:44.510
to create the version that
you're going to perform tonight.

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:48.910
&gt;&gt; Yes, in fact, this was
early in Carpenter's career

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:52.100
and he mostly collected this
one in writing as opposed

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:57.320
to on cylinders and so
we have written text

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:59.080
and transcriptions of it.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.380
But yeah--

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:02.870
&gt;&gt; And it looks like they
were all collected in 1928.

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:04.420
&gt;&gt; Yes, interestingly enough.

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:07.130
And that kind of shows you
that it might have been a sort

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:12.520
of micro-era in that chantey's
life when this version existed

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:13.970
and then kind of faded quickly.

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:16.280
These three men, certainly
two of them knew each other,

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:17.580
because they were both retired.

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:18.880
&gt;&gt; Because they were both
at Sailor's Snug Harbor.

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:22.090
&gt;&gt; Exactly, which is a sailors'
rest home in Staten Island

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:23.850
in New York, and
it's quite possible

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:25.300
that they knew the
third guy as well

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:28.610
because these crews were
often international.

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:30.210
&gt;&gt; And the other guy
was Richard Warner

00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:33.110
from Cardiff, in South Wales.

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:34.620
&gt;&gt; Cardiff in South
Wales, right.

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:37.200
So yeah, I combined some
verses from all of them,

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.620
primarily I'm doing a
version that he recorded

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:43.330
from Dennis O'Connor's in
Sailor's Snug Harbor but I put

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:45.730
in a couple of verses
from others.

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:49.250
&gt;&gt; Okay, we've got three more
songs to cover in 5 minutes,

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:53.030
so yeah, let's go ahead and talk
about On Board the [inaudible],

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:54.710
the other song from the
Carpenter collection.

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:57.520
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's an interesting
one too, which Carpenter,

00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:03.070
as I said, he wrote his
dissertation on sea music and so

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:06.710
when we were going
through his collection,

00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:10.080
there were some items
that we have notebooks

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:11.990
with tunes written down,

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:14.150
but we don't have the
words for those tunes.

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:16.050
And it turns out that
this is one of those,

00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:19.030
so I found the tune
in his collection,

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:20.900
but then when looking at
his doctoral dissertation,

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:22.200
I found that the
words are in there.

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.260
So we were able to
match those up together.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.010
And I was actually alerted to
this by our friend Bob Walser,

00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:29.300
who's been working with
the collection quite a bit,

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:35.080
and it appealed to me because
it's a song that tells the story

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:37.400
of a fishing trip
from Massachusetts

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:39.750
up to Atlantic Canada
and I've heard the tune

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:41.050
up in Atlantic Canada.

00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:43.380
It's still an oral tradition
but not with these words.

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:45.130
So I thought that was an
interesting piece as well

00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:46.570
and we put that one together.

00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:48.280
&gt;&gt; So this is a great reunion.

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:49.580
&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.

00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:52.720
&gt;&gt; The reunion of the
tune and the words.

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:57.100
Now let's jump to William
Derflinger's [phonetic]

00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:59.340
collection of Patrick Taylor.

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:04.180
From that collection,
you chose Reuben Ranzo.

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:07.120
&gt;&gt; Yeah and that's
only because I mean,

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:10.000
Taylor was an incredible
singer and chantey man

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.140
but also a great story teller.

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:15.570
And he gave these incredible
introductions for some

00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:17.950
of his songs including
Reuben Ranzo,

00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:20.430
so we decided we'd play a
piece of his introduction--

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:21.730
&gt;&gt; Using that tonight.

00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:25.090
&gt;&gt; Using so we'll hear Taylor's
voice introducing the song

00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:27.010
and then Myron's actually
going to sing that one.

00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:30.080
But it's another very
well-known sea chantey which is

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:33.300
about a tailor who goes to sea.

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:35.420
Sailors often made fun
of tailors and a lot

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:36.720
of people did in those days.

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:38.020
Tailors had the kind

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:40.510
of stereotypical
repetition of being wimps.

00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:42.590
That's sort of the joke
that is always being told

00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:45.770
about tailors in that era.

00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:48.610
&gt;&gt; And over to Jolly
Roving Tar from the Anne

00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:50.110
and Frank Warner collection.

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:54.110
&gt;&gt; So that is a song again,
that all nautical groups know.

00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:57.960
It's very well-known in this
community but what nobody knows,

00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:01.340
or very few people know, is
that everybody knows that song

00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:04.600
because of a single field
recording that's in our archive.

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:07.230
And that was a recording
made by Anne and Frank Warner

00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:08.770
of Lena Born Fish [phonetic],

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:13.390
in East Jaffrey New
Hampshire in 1940.

00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:15.290
&gt;&gt; Nineteen-forty, mm hmm.

00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:17.780
&gt;&gt; So when I learned that that
was the case and I learned

00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:19.370
that actually from
Jeff and Garrett Warner

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:22.280
who were here just a few
weeks ago, I thought wow,

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:25.770
that would be a great fourth
song to do in our set and we put

00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:27.600
that one together as well.

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:30.750
&gt;&gt; And did Ship's Company
already sing a version

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:32.450
of Jolly Roving Tar?

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:34.640
&gt;&gt; Yes, that's one that's
in our general repertoire.

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:35.940
&gt;&gt; In your repertoire.

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:37.240
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:38.660
&gt;&gt; And the interesting
thing being

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:42.250
that you probably learned it
from someone who learned it

00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:43.640
from someone else,
who learned it

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:47.090
from the Lena Born Fish
the field recording.

00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:48.620
&gt;&gt; Yes, so the way
that worked was

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:51.490
that the Warner's were good
friends with the Lomax's

00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:54.310
and they played this field
recording for the Lomax's

00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:56.570
who put it in one of their
books and so a transcription

00:12:56.570 --> 00:13:00.310
of this was released in a book
and so it was then learned

00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:02.260
by a lot of people
in the folk revival.

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.160
But another thing that
none of those people knew,

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:06.290
the Lomax's didn't know it,
the Warner's didn't know it,

00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:08.370
and Lena Born Fish didn't
know it, she had learned it

00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:10.780
from a retired whaling sailor.

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:12.080
But none of these people knew

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:14.550
that it was actually a
stage song that was written

00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:18.200
by Ned Harrigan of
Harrigan and Hart fame.

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:20.080
But it wasn't written
with Hart, it was written

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:22.620
with his father-in-law,
a man named Dave Brahm.

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:26.460
And they wrote it for a play
called Old Lavender which was

00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:33.150
on Broadway, and it was you
know, it became popular not only

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:37.130
with you know, everyday
popular culture,

00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:39.250
but it became popular
with sailors.

00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:43.810
And so it went to sea and was
then collected from sailors

00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:45.890
by Lena Born Fish,
among other people.

00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:50.150
And so it's a great story of one
of those kind of dramatic songs

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:52.720
about sailing life that
actually caught on with sailors.

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:54.020
And that wasn't uncommon.

00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:55.320
&gt;&gt; And made its way
into the oral tradition.

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:56.620
&gt;&gt; Right. That wasn't uncommon,

00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:59.900
that did happen quite a
bit in the tradition so.

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:01.650
&gt;&gt; Well, we're looking
forward to hearing all

00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:03.750
of these four songs tonight

00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:06.440
in the Archive Challenge
Sampler Concert

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:08.720
from the Homegrown
Concert Series

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:10.510
in the American Folklife Center

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:12.880
in the Coolidge Auditorium
tonight at 7:30.

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:15.930
Thank you gentlemen for being
with us for this interview.

00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:17.280
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

&gt;&gt; Thank you.
