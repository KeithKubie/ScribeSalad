00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The connection between angle and time is what's known as angular velocity,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
which we give this symbol ω--it looks sort of like a funny w.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
In this quantity describes how quickly in radians we progress around this circle

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and so it's units are in radians/second and the equation that describes this

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.000
is that the angle is equal to the ω&lt;i&gt;t--the angular velocity times the elapsed time.&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I should put a Δ here. This is how much you've changed your angle.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
So let's say we started an angle of 0 degrees, 0 radians were down here,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and I have an angular velocity--let's keep it simple of 1 radian/sec.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So what I want to know is how long will it take to complete one cycle

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and you'll have to remember what one cycle means in radians when four cycle

00:00:44.000 --> 99:59:59.000
given an angular velocity of 1 radian/second--enter your answer here.
