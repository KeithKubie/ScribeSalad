Hi, I'm John Green, and this is not Crash Course.

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:05.940
Instead, I'm here to talk about why we're hitting the pause button

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.060
on our human geography series to go back and rework it.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.420
In the last few months, we've been trying to grow Crash Course,

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:12.940
both on the curricular side of things

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.380
and in terms of the number of videos we make per week

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.700
without increases to our budget or staffing, and that was a mistake.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.840
It led to a rushed production schedule, inadequately edited and vetted scripts

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.320
and the Human Geography videos had factual mistakes as well as too strident a tone.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.100
We wrongly lumped Jared Diamond in with racist colonial geographers

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:36.040
and we did a bad job of explaining what environmental determinism was

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.460
before saying that it had been wholly debunked, which is not accurate.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.220
Crash Course needs to have a point of view,

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.540
but it also needs to be intellectually rigorous and to acknowledge the diversity of opinion

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.460
and research within a field, and we didn't do that.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.780
So we've taken the videos down, and we will be back with the geography series in the future

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.280
that better reflects the diversity of contemporary approaches to the study of geography.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.380
Our biggest takeaway from this experience is that Crash Course needs to work

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:05.040
with a larger team of educators and experts and spend more time vetting scripts

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.100
so that's going to be the first change we make.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.360
That will slow down our production schedule

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.100
but ultimately I think it will also improve our videos.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.900
I also want to say, "Thank you," to the many people

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.100
who shared reasoned, thoughtful, and constructive criticisms of Crash Course videos.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.860
You make the channel better for us and for all those who watch it.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.020
Snarky or abusive comments that don't come from a place of generosity

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.260
are really hard to respond to with anything but defensiveness, but we've been very lucky

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.960
at Crash Course that there are so many kind and careful critiques, and we're very grateful for them.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.360
Last thing – I want to be clear that the fault for this lies with Stan and me

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.500
not with anyone else who works for Crash Course

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.700
and certainly not with the presenter of the videos, Miriam.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.560
This one is entirely on us – mostly me – so I am the person you should be mad at.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.640
I want to thank all of our staff and hosts for doing everything they can

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.380
to make high quality educational videos quickly and on a tight budget

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.040
and thanks to all of you for watching.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.560
Human Geography, again, will be back in a few months.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.320
In the meantime, there's still lots of great Crash Course to watch.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.740
Thanks, bye.
