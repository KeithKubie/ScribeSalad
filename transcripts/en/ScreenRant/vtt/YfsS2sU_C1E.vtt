00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:11.460
The most effective methods to get ideas across
in cinema are usually the subtlest ones. Rather

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.560
than characters stating ideas on religion
and social commentary through dialogue, these

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.840
messages are better expressed through allegories,
metaphors, and symbols that infer subliminal

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.690
meanings in the viewer.&nbsp;
Here are 10 Secret Subliminal Messages In

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.720
Famous Movies
Star Wars&nbsp;

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.660
While it may be easy to say any film with
a quote unquote “chosen one” is based

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.520
on the story of Jesus, there’s much more
than that in Star Wars that reinforces Christian

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.000
beliefs and teachings. For example, Anakin
demonstrates several of the deadly sins, particularly

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.900
pride and anger, which set him on the path
to the dark side. Despite his terrible sins,

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.000
Luke never loses faith in his father and Anakin
ultimately redeems himself by sacrificing

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.150
his life for his son’s. It was Luke’s
strong faith and forgiveness that saved his

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.640
own life and his father’s immortal soul.
Preach it George.&nbsp;

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.860
The Departed&nbsp;
When the characters start dropping like flies

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.280
in The Departed, you really begin to feel
like anyone could be next. However there are

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.190
visual cues placed throughout that let you
know which characters are going to get nixed.

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.220
Scorsese placed X’s throughout the film,
usually appearing behind characters who have

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.990
an axe over their head. This is no coincidence,
especially when you consider that one never

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.100
appears behind Dignam, who’s pretty much
the only one who gets out alive. This is also

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.890
Scorsese’s nod to Howard Hawks Scarface,
a 1932 film in which an X appears onscreen

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.230
whenever a murder is about to occur.&nbsp;
The Shining&nbsp;

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:34.970
If you break it down, The Shining is probably
one of the densest horror film ever made.

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.370
Kubrick crafted a layered film that has inspired
hundreds of interpretations and theories,

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.050
some more far fetched than others. One that
many seem to agree on is the underlying theme

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.930
of the European’s genocide against Native
Americans that has gone unpunished. It’s

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.840
mentioned early on that the hotel was built
over an Indian burial ground, an offence they

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.670
seem proud of as images of native americans
and native american art are placed throughout

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.010
the hotel. Kubrick placed subtle references
to the country’s first inhabitants in everything

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.230
from set decoration, to wardrobe, to the score.
Some of have see the buckets of blood pouring

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:07.500
from the elevator as literally bringing up
the past buried below the hotel. It’s also

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.879
no coincidence that the final image shows
jack at&nbsp;a July 4th celebration, the holiday

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:17.330
that best represents the European’s false
claim of the land.&nbsp;

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.689
The Wizard of Oz
At the outset, it seems like The Wizard of

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:24.819
Oz is a film that would fall nicely in line
with many Christian beliefs. Dorothy and her

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:29.590
friends follow a clear path to receive enlightenment
from a god-like figure. However when it’s

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.060
revealed that the Wizard’s a fake, some
saw this as a critique on faith and the worship

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.230
of false gods. In the mid 80s, a group of
Christian fundamentalist in Tennessee even

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.859
tried to get the book banned from the school
curriculum because it suggests that humanity’s

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:47.840
strength comes from within instead of being
handed down by god. While some consider the

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.099
Wizard of Oz a case for atheism, others claim
to have actually SEEN God while watching the

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:55.629
film synced up with Pink Floyd’s Dark Side
of the Moon.&nbsp;

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:59.069
X Men
If you ever wonder why the X Men movies often

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:03.139
get caught up in the politics of Mutant Rights,
that’s because the issues facing these characters

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:07.760
and how people treat them are meant to mirror
actual experiences of marginalized groups,

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.430
particularly the LGBT community. It’s an
issue that hits close to home for director

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.650
Brian Singer, who included scenes of mutants
“coming out” to&nbsp; parents who react with

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:23.950
fear and anger. Their powers usually manifest
around the same time as puberty, causing many

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.930
young mutants to feel shame and conceal their
abilities. Colonel Stryker is the best example

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.010
of the prejudices and mutant-phobia that run
rampant in this world. When so many have been

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.790
forced to live a lie, you can see why characters
like Magneto are angry with the treatment

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.799
of mutants and fight for worldwide Mutant
Pride.&nbsp;

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:42.739
Aliens&nbsp;
In the same way Ridley Scott brought the horror

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:47.659
genre into space with the first Alien, James
Cameron set his sci sequel apart by bringing

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:52.540
the Vietnam war into space. For Aliens, Cameron
created fear and unease by using imagery that

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.180
subliminally recalled images of America’s
unpopular war. Once the government sends in

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.689
the marines, the over armed, over confident,
trigger happy soldiers quickly become scared

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:06.260
sitting ducks. Much of the action plays out
over monitors as others look on helplessly.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.659
Vietnam is sometimes referred to as The Television
War because it was the first war people could

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:15.359
watch unfold on TV. In the end the massive
casualties were the fault of the corrupt politicians

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:18.730
who sent the ill prepared soldiers there.
We’ll leave it up to you to decide if that

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:24.840
last point was about the movie or the war.&nbsp;
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.520
When the Harry Potter books and films were
first gaining popularity, some religious groups

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.449
boycotted it for celebrating the occult and
witchcraft. However, those who stuck with

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:36.440
the series all the way to the end could see
clear parallels between the story’s hero

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.970
and Jesus Christ. Harry has humble beginnings
yet is told from a very young age that he’s

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.270
“the chosen one”. In the Deathly Hollows
part 2, Potter sets out on his own quest in

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.280
the wilderness where he overcomes temptation.
In the end he accepts that he must sacrifice

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.610
himself for the greater good and is struck
down. He visits a heavenly place and speaks

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.370
with a wise bearded man in white before returning
to his earthly body and defeating evil. Apparently

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.430
when looking for ways to conclude Harry’s
saga, J.K. Rowling looked no further than

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.050
the greatest story ever told.&nbsp;
The Matrix Reloaded

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.790
If you’ve studied The Matrix, you know that
nothing that made it into those final movies

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:13.389
is there by mistake. In The Matrix Reloaded,
eagle eye viewers may have noticed that Agent

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:18.930
Smith pimped out his ride with some sweet
vanity plates. ‘IS 5416’ might just look

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.620
like random letters and numbers, but good
Christians will know that this is a reference

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:28.889
to the Bible, Isaiah 54:16 which reads “Behold,
I Myself have created the smith who blows

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:33.540
the fire of coals And brings out a weapon
for its work; And I have created the destroyer

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:40.330
to ruin.” This is basically Agent Smith’s
Ezekiel 25:17, it sounds cool but a bit long

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.631
to fit onto a license plate.&nbsp;
The Truman Show

00:05:43.631 --> 00:05:49.150
Do you ever feel like some omniscient begin
is watching over your every move? Some call

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:53.129
this feeling God, but if you’ve seen The
Truman Show, you’ve probably imagined an

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:57.361
Ed Harris-like producer overseeing and orchestrating
your life’s events at some point. While

00:05:57.361 --> 00:06:01.990
on the surface it’s a film about voyeurism
and reality TV, The Truman show also brilliantly

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:07.039
incorporated deeper ideas of free will and
God’s plan. Truman questions Ed Harris’

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:11.830
all seeing show runner and defies his plan,
thereby achieving personal freedom. What begins

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:16.129
as a light comedy, actually turns into a subliminally
subversive narrative that could have people

00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:20.069
doubting their own beliefs. In The Truman
Show, God turns out to be just another man

00:06:20.069 --> 00:06:25.280
behind a curtain. &nbsp;
Captain America: The Winter Soldier

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:29.360
If you’ve ever heard conspiracy theorists
throw around names of organizations like Illuminati

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:33.669
and New World Order and wonder what the heck
they’re talking about, then look no further

00:06:33.669 --> 00:06:38.289
than Hydra in Captain American: Winter Soldier.
When the filmmakers decided to take inspiration

00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:42.189
from political thrillers, a secret agency
with tentacles in high levels of government

00:06:42.189 --> 00:06:46.180
made for the perfect villain. Like Hydra,
many believe the Illuminati to be tied to

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:50.530
post-war Nazism and is made up some of the
most powerful people in the world who secretly

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:57.009
manipulate everything. It’s been said they
even employ mind control tactics. Pierce’s

00:06:57.009 --> 00:07:01.120
line in Winter Soldier about a tearing the
old world down to create a better one is basically

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.990
the basis for what people refer to as the
New World Order. What’s fact and what’s

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:07.539
fiction here remains to be seen.&nbsp;
These are just a few examples we found of

00:07:07.539 --> 00:07:12.669
subtle messages hidden our favourite movies.
