00:00:01.634 --> 00:00:02.702
- IT'S THE VIEW OUTSIDE
PEOPLE'S DOORS AND WINDOWS

00:00:02.735 --> 00:00:04.337
THAT HAS WALNUT CREEK NEIGHBORS
DOING DOUBLE TAKES.

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.473
YES, THAT'S A GUY WITH A RIFLE
STRAPPED ACROSS HIS BACK

00:00:07.506 --> 00:00:09.108
WALKING DOWN THE SIDEWALK.

00:00:09.141 --> 00:00:12.345
- THIS IS MY GRANDDAD'S GUN
FROM WORLD WAR II.

00:00:12.378 --> 00:00:15.014
- 19-YEAR-OLD JOHN SCHULTZ
ALSO WEARS A BULLETPROOF VEST,

00:00:15.047 --> 00:00:16.983
CARRIES AMMO, AND KEEPS A KNIFE.

00:00:17.016 --> 00:00:19.318
- I HAVE ZIP TIES ON AS WELL,
JUST IN CASE.

00:00:19.351 --> 00:00:21.754
- MY KIDS DON'T EVEN
COME OUTSIDE

00:00:21.787 --> 00:00:22.755
'CAUSE THEY'RE SCARED.

00:00:22.788 --> 00:00:25.758
- HIS WALKS VARY, DAY AND NIGHT.

00:00:25.791 --> 00:00:27.894
IT'S MOSTLY FOR PICKING UP
GARBAGE.

00:00:27.927 --> 00:00:30.196
- IT'S NOTHING TO DO
WITH THE GUN OR THE BODY ARMOR.

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:31.764
IT'S THE PERSON.

00:00:31.797 --> 00:00:33.466
- BUT THERE'S TILL THE GUN
AND THE BODY ARMOR.

00:00:33.499 --> 00:00:35.868
- YEAH, IT JUST SO HAPPENS
TO BE THERE.

00:00:35.901 --> 00:00:38.471
- GUNS WERE SO COOL
BEFORE NERDY WHITE KIDS

00:00:38.504 --> 00:00:40.373
STARTED USING THEM TO GET EVEN.

00:00:40.406 --> 00:00:43.509
THAT'S G.I. JOHN, AND SO
HELP YOU GOD IF YOU LITTER

00:00:43.542 --> 00:00:46.612
IN HIS PREDOMINANTLY
COLORED...FUL NEIGHBORHOOD.

00:00:46.645 --> 00:00:50.983
JOHN IS WHAT WE Y.A. FANS
WOULD CLASSIFY AS A DAUNTLESS.

00:00:51.016 --> 00:00:52.952
WE WOULD'VE AIRED THIS
REDEMPTION A FEW WEEKS AGO,

00:00:52.985 --> 00:00:55.154
HAD IT NOT BEEN
FOR A MUCH MORE DISTURBING

00:00:55.187 --> 00:00:57.056
GUN-TOTING LUNATIC ON THE NEWS.

00:00:57.089 --> 00:00:58.324
WHAT KIND OF COUNTRY
DO WE LIVE IN

00:00:58.357 --> 00:00:59.859
WHERE AN ASSHOLE COMEDIAN
LIKE ME

00:00:59.892 --> 00:01:03.062
IS PULLING BITS OFF THE AIR
OUT OF RESPECT?

00:01:03.095 --> 00:01:04.864
EVERYONE SHOULD FEEL COMFORTABLE

00:01:04.897 --> 00:01:07.366
AS LONG AS JOHN
AVOIDS CHURCHES, MALLS,

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:09.869
ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS,
AND MOVIE THEATERS...

00:01:09.902 --> 00:01:11.704
OR VIRGINIA TECH.

00:01:11.737 --> 00:01:13.706
I KNOW PIRATING MOVIES
IS A CRIME,

00:01:13.739 --> 00:01:15.374
BUT DIVING
ON TOP OF MY GIRLFRIEND

00:01:15.407 --> 00:01:18.044
TO KEEP HER FROM GETTING SHOT
SEEMS A LOT WORSE.

00:01:18.077 --> 00:01:20.513
WHY IS IT THE FOLKS
WHO WANT GUNS FOR PROTECTION

00:01:20.546 --> 00:01:21.814
HAVE THE LEAST TO PROTECT?

00:01:21.847 --> 00:01:23.916
NOBODY IS TRYING TO STEAL
YOUR BOWLING TROPHIES

00:01:23.949 --> 00:01:26.219
OR YOUR 46-INCH VIZIO.

00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:28.788
POLICE GET A FREE GUN JUST
FOR DROPPING OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL

00:01:28.821 --> 00:01:30.656
AND COMPLETING
AN OBSTACLE COURSE.

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.192
AS SOON AS PRESIDENT TRUMP
LOOKS INTO IT,

00:01:33.225 --> 00:01:35.828
GUN VIOLENCE
WON'T BE A PROBLEM ANYMORE.

00:01:35.861 --> 00:01:41.033
HE'S NOT SURE HOW OR WHEN,
"BUT IT'S GONNA BE TREMENDOUS."

00:01:41.066 --> 00:01:44.303
GUNS ARE THE ONLY WAY
STUPID PEOPLE CAN WIN ARGUMENTS.

00:01:44.336 --> 00:01:46.305
THEY'RE LIKE
UNCIRCUMCISED PENISES.

00:01:46.338 --> 00:01:47.640
I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE
HAVE THEM,

00:01:47.673 --> 00:01:50.476
BUT WHEN I HOLD ONE,
I'M UNCOMFORTABLE.

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:52.879
BUT DESPITE THE RIFLE,
BODY ARMOR,

00:01:52.912 --> 00:01:54.280
AND ARYAN-NATION HAIRCUT,

00:01:54.313 --> 00:01:55.748
JOHN MAKES A LOT OF SENSE.

00:01:55.781 --> 00:01:57.016
THAT'S WHY I FLEW HIM
TO HOLLYWOOD,

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:59.085
WHERE LIBERAL CELEBS
WHO HATE GUNS

00:01:59.118 --> 00:02:01.554
GET RICH MAKING MOVIES
THAT GLORIFY THEM

00:02:01.587 --> 00:02:02.822
IN THIS WEEK'S WEB REDEMPTION.

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.260
[UPBEAT MUSIC]

00:02:07.293 --> 00:02:08.261
THANK YOU.

00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:10.163
I'M EXCITED TO BE AROUND ME TOO.

00:02:10.196 --> 00:02:13.332
METEOROLOGISTS PREDICT
A STRONG EL NIÃ‘O THIS YEAR.

00:02:13.365 --> 00:02:16.469
WITH A NAME LIKE THAT,
DONALD TRUMP THINKS THAT MEANS

00:02:16.502 --> 00:02:18.671
IT WILL GROW UP TO BE A CRIMINAL
AND A RAPIST.

00:02:18.704 --> 00:02:20.673
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:20.706 --> 00:02:21.908
I KID THE DONALD.

00:02:21.941 --> 00:02:23.242
LET'S MEET OUR PANEL.

00:02:23.275 --> 00:02:26.245

00:02:50.002 --> 00:02:51.771
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S GET STARTED.

00:02:51.804 --> 00:02:53.072
- I HAVE AN IDEA.

00:02:53.105 --> 00:02:55.274
WHY DON'T YOU PRACTICE
YOUR HORRIBLE MONOLOGUE

00:02:55.307 --> 00:02:57.210
IN FRONT OF A MIRROR
BEFORE THE SHOW

00:02:57.243 --> 00:02:58.878
SO IT DOESN'T
CRACK YOU UP SO MUCH?

00:02:58.911 --> 00:02:59.946 align:start size:22% position:78%
- NICE.

00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:01.447 align:end position:100%
I'M GLAD YOU GREW
YOUR HAIR OUT.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.448 align:start size:78% position:22%
YOU LOOK LESS CREEPY NOW.

00:03:02.481 --> 00:03:03.649 align:start position:0%
- OH, YEAH.

00:03:03.682 --> 00:03:05.284 align:end position:100%
- HOW OFTEN DO YOU PATROL
YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD?

00:03:05.317 --> 00:03:06.419 align:start position:0%
- WHEN I'M BORED.

00:03:06.452 --> 00:03:08.221 align:end position:100%
- SO HOW MANY TIMES A WEEK?
ONCE A WEEK?

00:03:08.254 --> 00:03:10.089 align:start position:0%
- PROBABLY THREE OR FOUR
TIMES A DAY.

00:03:10.122 --> 00:03:11.557 size:88% position:56%
- THREE OR FOUR TIMES A DAY.

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.993
- IT CAN BE, YOU KNOW, 3:00 A.M.

00:03:14.026 --> 00:03:19.799 align:end position:100%
- YOU PATROL AT 3:00 A.M.
WITH A LOADED RIFLE?

00:03:19.832 --> 00:03:21.767 align:start position:0%
- IN THE VIDEO,
YOU SEE THE BOLT OPEN.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.338 align:start position:0%
I'VE ACTUALLY HAD POLICE
COME TO ME AND SAY,

00:03:25.371 --> 00:03:28.708
"IT'S NOT SMART TO BE WALKING
AROUND WITH AN UNLOADED GUN,"

00:03:28.741 --> 00:03:31.244 align:start position:0%
AND THEY'VE TAKEN IT FROM ME
AND LOADED IT AND SAID,

00:03:31.277 --> 00:03:33.713 align:start position:0%
"YOU'RE WALKING AROUND
WITH A BRICK, ESSENTIALLY."

00:03:33.746 --> 00:03:35.948 align:end position:100%
- WHICH ALSO COULD
DO A LOT OF DAMAGE.

00:03:35.981 --> 00:03:37.984
- HAVE YOU EVER TRIED
TO SWITCH THINGS UP

00:03:38.017 --> 00:03:41.053
AND ACTUALLY, LIKE,
THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?

00:03:41.086 --> 00:03:43.322
YOU KNOW, JUST FOR--
JUST FOR A CHANGE.

00:03:43.355 --> 00:03:45.725 align:end position:100%
- IS YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD
PREDOMINANTLY BLACK?

00:03:45.758 --> 00:03:46.726 align:start position:0%
- YES.

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:48.361 align:start size:59% position:41%
- DO YOU UNDERSTAND

00:03:48.394 --> 00:03:52.131 align:end position:100%
WHY BLACK PEOPLE WOULD BE
A LITTLE CREEPED OUT

00:03:52.164 --> 00:03:55.935 align:end position:100%
BY A WHITE GUY WALKING AROUND
WITH A RIFLE?

00:03:55.968 --> 00:03:56.969 align:start position:0%
- OH, YEAH.

00:03:57.002 --> 00:03:57.970 align:start position:0%
I UNDERSTAND,

00:03:58.003 --> 00:04:00.606 align:start position:0%
BUT, YOU KNOW,
I'M NOT GONNA STOP.

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:03.676
YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT
IT'S PART OF THE CONSTITUTION

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:05.544 align:start position:0%
AND THE BILL OF RIGHTS
THAT, YOU KNOW,

00:04:05.577 --> 00:04:08.047
WE NEED TO SERIOUSLY STEP UP.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.181
- DO YOU RACIALLY PROFILE?

00:04:09.214 --> 00:04:10.716

THEY PULLED UP.

00:04:20.326 --> 00:04:21.627 align:start position:0%
THEY WERE LEAVING
TO GO KAYAKING.

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:22.995

00:04:23.028 --> 00:04:24.030 align:start position:0%
- OH, HELL YEAH.

00:04:24.063 --> 00:04:25.331 align:start size:56% position:44%

IS THE GREATEST THING
I'VE EVER HEARD.

00:04:26.932 --> 00:04:29.268

00:04:32.304 --> 00:04:35.374 align:end position:100%
THE RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS
OR THE PART ABOUT MILITIAS?

00:04:35.407 --> 00:04:36.542 align:start position:0%
- MILITIA.

00:04:36.575 --> 00:04:37.943 size:88% position:56%

00:04:41.747 --> 00:04:43.549
- YOU'RE PREACHING TO THE CHOIR.

00:04:43.582 --> 00:04:44.583 align:start size:13% position:88%
UGH.

00:04:44.616 --> 00:04:46.152 align:start size:75% position:25%
POLLEN WILL RUIN MY DAY.

00:04:46.185 --> 00:04:48.354

AND THE BULLETPROOF VEST--
DO YOU THINK THAT'S A BIT MUCH?

00:04:52.358 --> 00:04:53.793 align:start position:0%

00:04:53.826 --> 00:04:55.628

GOING ON IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD?

00:04:55.661 --> 00:04:56.629 align:start position:0%
