influencing a dropout rate well I like

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400
influencing a dropout rate well I like

to remind people of is dropping out as a
 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.670
to remind people of is dropping out as a
symptom of a larger problem and if you

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680
symptom of a larger problem and if you
 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.170
symptom of a larger problem and if you
don't get addressed the underlying

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180
don't get addressed the underlying
 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.330
don't get addressed the underlying
causes then you never can solve that

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340

from school show up much earlier and the
problem is that schools don't intervene

they are graduating where they are
 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.030
they are graduating where they are
thriving and what we don't do is learn

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040
thriving and what we don't do is learn
 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.590
thriving and what we don't do is learn
from those schools and do more of what

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600
from those schools and do more of what
 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.890
from those schools and do more of what
they do and what works and what you find

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900
they do and what works and what you find
 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.860
they do and what works and what you find
in those schools and generally is strong

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870
in those schools and generally is strong
 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.479

students a real clear sense of mission

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920
students a real clear sense of mission
 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.550
students a real clear sense of mission
about why they're there

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560
about why they're there
 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.150
about why they're there
understanding of how to make the

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160
understanding of how to make the
 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.530
understanding of how to make the
curriculum relevant to the lives of

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540
curriculum relevant to the lives of
 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.690
curriculum relevant to the lives of
those students all the things that are

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700
those students all the things that are
 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.810
those students all the things that are
lacking typically you find present and

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820
lacking typically you find present and
 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.540
lacking typically you find present and
so it's not as though it's as hard as it

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:39.550
so it's not as though it's as hard as it
 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:41.310
so it's not as though it's as hard as it
sometimes seems I think right now we

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320
sometimes seems I think right now we
 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.280
sometimes seems I think right now we
have policymakers who are kind of you

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290
have policymakers who are kind of you
 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.479
have policymakers who are kind of you
know banging their heads thinking what

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489
know banging their heads thinking what
 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:47.010
know banging their heads thinking what
will it take to reduce the dropout rate

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:47.020
will it take to reduce the dropout rate
 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:48.750
will it take to reduce the dropout rate
and I keep saying we'll look at the

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760
and I keep saying we'll look at the
 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.370
and I keep saying we'll look at the
places where you have low dropout rates

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380
places where you have low dropout rates
 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.619
places where you have low dropout rates
and do more of that

00:03:55.619 --> 00:03:55.629
 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:59.459
well I think it in the the factors are

00:03:59.459 --> 00:03:59.469
well I think it in the the factors are
 

00:03:59.469 --> 00:04:01.739
well I think it in the the factors are
internal and external so for example

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:01.749
internal and external so for example
 

00:04:01.749 --> 00:04:03.330
internal and external so for example
doing work in Newark right now in Newark

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.690
doing work in Newark right now in Newark

not open doors so what starts to happen

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690
not open doors so what starts to happen
 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.080
not open doors so what starts to happen
is there's a sense within the community

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090
is there's a sense within the community
 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.689
is there's a sense within the community
that education is not the pathway to

that education is not the pathway to
 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:48.240
that education is not the pathway to
success and that's born out of

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250
success and that's born out of

and so what you need to do is you need

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740
and so what you need to do is you need
 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.490
and so what you need to do is you need
to start to create a different reality

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500
to start to create a different reality
 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.159

by creating some schools that do in fact

00:04:59.159 --> 00:04:59.169
by creating some schools that do in fact
 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:01.230
by creating some schools that do in fact
open doors and create pathways to

opportunity for kids

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:06.789
 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:09.839
well money is certainly important you

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:09.849
well money is certainly important you

know in this country we consistently
 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.409
know in this country we consistently
spend the most money on the most

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:13.419
spend the most money on the most
 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:15.390
spend the most money on the most
affluent kids and the least money on the

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.400
affluent kids and the least money on the
 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.489
affluent kids and the least money on the
poorest kids so I would say if money

00:05:17.489 --> 00:05:17.499
poorest kids so I would say if money
 

00:05:17.499 --> 00:05:18.659

didn't matter then why don't we just

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:18.669
didn't matter then why don't we just
 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:20.820
didn't matter then why don't we just
reverse it for a while and see try it

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830
reverse it for a while and see try it
 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.159
reverse it for a while and see try it
out but nobody is interested in that at

least not in the affluent communities
 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:27.510
least not in the affluent communities
but nonetheless it's not simply about

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520
but nonetheless it's not simply about
 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.230

money there are schools in high poverty

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240
money there are schools in high poverty
 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.629

areas that have resources and you see

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:33.639
areas that have resources and you see
 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:35.879

so it's money is important but by itself
 

00:05:39.309 --> 00:05:40.139
so it's money is important but by itself
is not a solution

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:40.149
is not a solution

it's how the money's applied it's both

00:05:42.899 --> 00:05:42.909
it's how the money's applied it's both
 

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:45.480
it's how the money's applied it's both
the efficient use of resources but also

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:45.490
the efficient use of resources but also
 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:48.269
the efficient use of resources but also
the effective use I you know and and

we've retreated from that some of that

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:10.710
we've retreated from that some of that
 

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:12.530
we've retreated from that some of that
is because of the courts a lot of that

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:12.540
is because of the courts a lot of that
 

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:13.810
is because of the courts a lot of that
is because the lack of political will

00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:13.820
is because the lack of political will
 

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:16.180
is because the lack of political will
where we are now as a country is

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:16.190
where we are now as a country is
 

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:19.310
where we are now as a country is
accepting the idea of segregated schools

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:19.320
accepting the idea of segregated schools
 

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:22.760
accepting the idea of segregated schools
and and I think it's like Plessy but the

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:22.770
and and I think it's like Plessy but the
 

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:24.530
and and I think it's like Plessy but the
idea of Plessy versus Ferguson was

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:24.540
idea of Plessy versus Ferguson was
 

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:26.780
idea of Plessy versus Ferguson was
separate but equal I think that's where

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:26.790
separate but equal I think that's where
 

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:28.730
separate but equal I think that's where
we are now we're still not an equal but

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:28.740
we are now we're still not an equal but
 

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:31.670
we are now we're still not an equal but
I think that many people are satisfied

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:31.680
I think that many people are satisfied
 

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.860
I think that many people are satisfied
with separate I think that that is a

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:33.870
with separate I think that that is a
 

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:35.750
with separate I think that that is a
huge political problem

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:35.760
huge political problem
 

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:37.610
huge political problem
I think there's it they will never be

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:37.620
I think there's it they will never be
 

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:41.570
I think there's it they will never be
equal because the the way we educate our

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:41.580
equal because the the way we educate our
 

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:44.450
equal because the the way we educate our
kids is directly related to the way we

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:44.460
kids is directly related to the way we
 

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:47.420
kids is directly related to the way we
value not only the children but also

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:47.430
value not only the children but also
 

00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:48.620
value not only the children but also
their parents and the communities they

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:48.630
their parents and the communities they
 

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:49.010
their parents and the communities they
live in

00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:49.020
live in
 

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:51.290
live in
and so I see this is a major political

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:51.300
and so I see this is a major political
 

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:52.960
and so I see this is a major political
challenge that there's not much

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:52.970
challenge that there's not much
 

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:58.450
challenge that there's not much
leadership to address right now

00:09:58.450 --> 00:09:58.460
 

00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:00.880
well I think we've had major setbacks in

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:00.890
well I think we've had major setbacks in
 

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:02.769
well I think we've had major setbacks in
the courts which have limited the

00:10:02.769 --> 00:10:02.779
the courts which have limited the
 

00:10:02.779 --> 00:10:07.060
the courts which have limited the
ability to integrate schools so you

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:07.070
ability to integrate schools so you
 

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:09.070
ability to integrate schools so you
can't cross district lines for example

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:09.080
can't cross district lines for example
 

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:13.420
can't cross district lines for example
to create more diverse schools so there

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:13.430
to create more diverse schools so there
 

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:15.820
to create more diverse schools so there
are there are legal limitations out

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:15.830
are there are legal limitations out
 

00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:19.540
are there are legal limitations out
there but beyond that one of the major

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:19.550
there but beyond that one of the major
 

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:21.519
there but beyond that one of the major
reasons why schools are so segregated is

00:10:21.519 --> 00:10:21.529
reasons why schools are so segregated is
 

00:10:21.529 --> 00:10:24.940
reasons why schools are so segregated is
because in many cities this public

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:24.950
because in many cities this public
 

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:26.470
because in many cities this public
schools disproportionate serve the

00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:26.480
schools disproportionate serve the
 

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:28.780
schools disproportionate serve the
poorest kids and what ends up happening

00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:28.790
poorest kids and what ends up happening
 

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:31.180
poorest kids and what ends up happening
when that's the case is that middle

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:31.190
when that's the case is that middle
 

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:32.829
when that's the case is that middle
class people affluent people don't put

00:10:32.829 --> 00:10:32.839
class people affluent people don't put
 

00:10:32.839 --> 00:10:34.570
class people affluent people don't put
their kids in the public schools so you

00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:34.580
their kids in the public schools so you
 

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:36.040
their kids in the public schools so you
end up with a two-tiered system a

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:36.050
end up with a two-tiered system a
 

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:37.990
end up with a two-tiered system a
private one for the white and the

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:38.000
private one for the white and the
 

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.570
private one for the white and the
affluent and a public one for the poor

00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:40.580
affluent and a public one for the poor
 

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:42.100
affluent and a public one for the poor
that's New York City that's Chicago

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:42.110
that's New York City that's Chicago
 

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:43.900
that's New York City that's Chicago
that's most cities across the United

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:43.910
that's most cities across the United
 

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:45.940
that's most cities across the United
States the only way to address that is

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:45.950
States the only way to address that is
 

00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:49.269
States the only way to address that is
to significantly invest in the public

00:10:49.269 --> 00:10:49.279
to significantly invest in the public
 

00:10:49.279 --> 00:10:51.820
to significantly invest in the public
schools so that the public schools can

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:51.830
schools so that the public schools can
 

00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:53.350
schools so that the public schools can
really offer an education that the

00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:53.360
really offer an education that the
 

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:55.900
really offer an education that the
middle class would choose for their

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:55.910
middle class would choose for their
 

00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:58.630
middle class would choose for their
children so I think that's got it before

00:10:58.630 --> 00:10:58.640
children so I think that's got it before
 

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:00.820
children so I think that's got it before
the strategy you can't attract white

00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:00.830
the strategy you can't attract white
 

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:02.650
the strategy you can't attract white
middle-class parents unless you address

00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:02.660
middle-class parents unless you address
 

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:04.390
middle-class parents unless you address
the quality of schools now it's also

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:04.400
the quality of schools now it's also
 

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:05.920
the quality of schools now it's also
true that there's still bias this

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:05.930
true that there's still bias this
 

00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:07.540
true that there's still bias this
prejudice and there are a lot of white

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:07.550
prejudice and there are a lot of white
 

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:08.980
prejudice and there are a lot of white
parents who don't want their kids in

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:08.990
parents who don't want their kids in
 

00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:10.900
parents who don't want their kids in
school with poor black and brown kids

00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:10.910
school with poor black and brown kids
 

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:13.269
school with poor black and brown kids
and so I mean there are creative ways

00:11:13.269 --> 00:11:13.279
and so I mean there are creative ways
 

00:11:13.279 --> 00:11:14.620
and so I mean there are creative ways
you can address that through magnet

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:14.630
you can address that through magnet
 

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:17.590
you can address that through magnet
programs and other issues but ultimately

00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:17.600
programs and other issues but ultimately
 

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.690
programs and other issues but ultimately
it does take change of beliefs and my

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:19.700
it does take change of beliefs and my
 

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:21.790
it does take change of beliefs and my
hope is that with time some of those

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:21.800
hope is that with time some of those
 

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:25.759
hope is that with time some of those
attitudes will change too

00:11:25.759 --> 00:11:25.769
 

00:11:25.769 --> 00:11:28.790
I think there's a there's a lot of

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:28.800
I think there's a there's a lot of
 

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.410
I think there's a there's a lot of
continuity from Bush to Obama in terms

major changes wait and I'm disappointed

00:11:35.479 --> 00:11:35.489
major changes wait and I'm disappointed
 

00:11:35.489 --> 00:11:39.499
major changes wait and I'm disappointed
about that I think that neither the

00:11:39.499 --> 00:11:39.509
about that I think that neither the
 

00:11:39.509 --> 00:11:41.269
about that I think that neither the
president nor the Secretary's clear what

00:11:41.269 --> 00:11:41.279
president nor the Secretary's clear what
 

00:11:41.279 --> 00:11:45.470
president nor the Secretary's clear what
was wrong with no chelev behind and what

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:45.480
was wrong with no chelev behind and what
 

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:47.419
was wrong with no chelev behind and what
I see coming from the administration so

00:11:47.419 --> 00:11:47.429
I see coming from the administration so
 

00:11:47.429 --> 00:11:49.910
I see coming from the administration so
far is too much emphasis on charter

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:49.920
far is too much emphasis on charter
 

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:54.199
far is too much emphasis on charter
schools and and and a tendency to frame

00:11:54.199 --> 00:11:54.209
schools and and and a tendency to frame
 

00:11:54.209 --> 00:11:56.329
schools and and and a tendency to frame
it as a competition between charters and

00:11:56.329 --> 00:11:56.339
it as a competition between charters and
 

00:11:56.339 --> 00:11:58.489
it as a competition between charters and
traditional public schools when you

00:11:58.489 --> 00:11:58.499
traditional public schools when you
 

00:11:58.499 --> 00:11:59.749
traditional public schools when you
consider the fact that the vast majority

00:11:59.749 --> 00:11:59.759
consider the fact that the vast majority
 

00:11:59.759 --> 00:12:01.910
consider the fact that the vast majority
of kids are in public schools I think

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:01.920
of kids are in public schools I think
 

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:04.460
of kids are in public schools I think
that's a big mistake I just think if you

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:04.470
that's a big mistake I just think if you
 

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:06.410
that's a big mistake I just think if you
don't have a strategy for addressing the

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:06.420
don't have a strategy for addressing the
 

00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:08.119
don't have a strategy for addressing the
quality of education and we still

00:12:08.119 --> 00:12:08.129
quality of education and we still
 

00:12:08.129 --> 00:12:10.280
quality of education and we still
receive in public schools then you don't

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:10.290
receive in public schools then you don't
 

00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:12.769
receive in public schools then you don't
really you can't really innovate and

00:12:12.769 --> 00:12:12.779
really you can't really innovate and
 

00:12:12.779 --> 00:12:15.199
really you can't really innovate and
improve those schools and so far I

00:12:15.199 --> 00:12:15.209
improve those schools and so far I
 

00:12:15.209 --> 00:12:17.210
improve those schools and so far I
haven't heard the administration come up

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:17.220
haven't heard the administration come up
 

00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:19.970
haven't heard the administration come up
with any ideas that sound particularly

00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:19.980
with any ideas that sound particularly
 

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:21.590
with any ideas that sound particularly
innovative they say they want encourage

00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:21.600
innovative they say they want encourage
 

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.269
innovative they say they want encourage
innovation they never define what that

00:12:23.269 --> 00:12:23.279
innovation they never define what that
 

00:12:23.279 --> 00:12:25.069
innovation they never define what that
means or what it looks like or anything

00:12:25.069 --> 00:12:25.079
means or what it looks like or anything
 

00:12:25.079 --> 00:12:29.790
means or what it looks like or anything
else

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:29.800
 

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:32.330
well at the state and federal level

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:32.340
well at the state and federal level
 

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:34.740
well at the state and federal level
basically what we need are ways to

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:34.750
basically what we need are ways to
 

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:37.860
basically what we need are ways to
intervene more effectively in schools

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:37.870
intervene more effectively in schools
 

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:40.560
intervene more effectively in schools
that are floundering that the

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:40.570
that are floundering that the
 

00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:43.500
that are floundering that the
chronically failing schools shutting

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:43.510
chronically failing schools shutting
 

00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:45.000
chronically failing schools shutting
them down is not a strategy for

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:45.010
them down is not a strategy for
 

00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:48.120
them down is not a strategy for
improving them it may be an option that

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:48.130
improving them it may be an option that
 

00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:51.060
improving them it may be an option that
we have to consider but we first of all

00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:51.070
we have to consider but we first of all
 

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:52.230
we have to consider but we first of all
need to figure out why were they failing

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:52.240
need to figure out why were they failing
 

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:54.240
need to figure out why were they failing
in the first place and get at the root

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:54.250
in the first place and get at the root
 

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:56.850
in the first place and get at the root
causes of failure and I think that I

00:12:56.850 --> 00:12:56.860
causes of failure and I think that I
 

00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:58.770
causes of failure and I think that I
don't know of any state governments much

00:12:58.770 --> 00:12:58.780
don't know of any state governments much
 

00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:00.000
don't know of any state governments much
less the federal government that has

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:00.010
less the federal government that has
 

00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:01.740
less the federal government that has
figured out a strategy for doing that

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:01.750
figured out a strategy for doing that
 

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:04.140
figured out a strategy for doing that
effectively and so I would say that

00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:04.150
effectively and so I would say that
 

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:06.060
effectively and so I would say that
would be one big thing they could do the

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:06.070
would be one big thing they could do the
 

00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:07.470
would be one big thing they could do the
other big thing that's both the state

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:07.480
other big thing that's both the state
 

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:09.030
other big thing that's both the state
and federal government have to do is to

00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:09.040
and federal government have to do is to
 

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:12.620
and federal government have to do is to
think about creative ways of linking

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:12.630
think about creative ways of linking
 

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:15.510
think about creative ways of linking
educational efforts to economic

00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:15.520
educational efforts to economic
 

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:17.850
educational efforts to economic
development efforts if you could if

00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:17.860
development efforts if you could if
 

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:19.710
development efforts if you could if
you'd want to improve schools in Detroit

00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:19.720
you'd want to improve schools in Detroit
 

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:21.840
you'd want to improve schools in Detroit
you have to think what are the what jobs

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:21.850
you have to think what are the what jobs
 

00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:24.060
you have to think what are the what jobs
are we preparing kids for in Detroit it

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:24.070
are we preparing kids for in Detroit it
 

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:25.500
are we preparing kids for in Detroit it
was not going to be manufacturing cars

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:25.510
was not going to be manufacturing cars
 

00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:27.650
was not going to be manufacturing cars
then with any something else otherwise

00:13:27.650 --> 00:13:27.660
then with any something else otherwise
 

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:29.910
then with any something else otherwise
you're gonna continue to have a mass

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:29.920
you're gonna continue to have a mass
 

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:32.040
you're gonna continue to have a mass
exodus of people from Detroit or

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:32.050
exodus of people from Detroit or
 

00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:34.410
exodus of people from Detroit or
Cleveland or any of the other major

00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:34.420
Cleveland or any of the other major
 

00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:37.320
Cleveland or any of the other major
industrial areas in the Midwest and

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:37.330
industrial areas in the Midwest and
 

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:40.410
industrial areas in the Midwest and
Northeast so we need to think creatively

00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:40.420
Northeast so we need to think creatively
 

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:42.450
Northeast so we need to think creatively
and strategically what are the jobs of

00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:42.460
and strategically what are the jobs of
 

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:43.800
and strategically what are the jobs of
the future how do we make sure we're

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:43.810
the future how do we make sure we're
 

00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:45.900
the future how do we make sure we're
preparing young people for the jobs of

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:45.910
preparing young people for the jobs of
 

00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:47.550
preparing young people for the jobs of
the future and that's where state and

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:47.560
the future and that's where state and
 

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:48.960
the future and that's where state and
federal leadership I think could come in

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:48.970
federal leadership I think could come in
 

00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:54.530
federal leadership I think could come in
much more than it has right now

00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:54.540
 

00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:57.650
unions need to make it very clear that

00:13:57.650 --> 00:13:57.660
unions need to make it very clear that
 

00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:00.290
unions need to make it very clear that
the interest of the teachers are aligned

00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:00.300
the interest of the teachers are aligned
 

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:02.110
the interest of the teachers are aligned
with the interests of the children

00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:02.120
with the interests of the children
 

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:04.070
with the interests of the children
whatever's good for the teachers better

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:04.080
whatever's good for the teachers better
 

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:05.900
whatever's good for the teachers better
also be good for the children and if

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:05.910
also be good for the children and if
 

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:08.810
also be good for the children and if
it's not then it's a problem it should

00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:08.820
it's not then it's a problem it should
 

00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:10.870
it's not then it's a problem it should
be the case that parents and children

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:10.880
be the case that parents and children
 

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:13.460
be the case that parents and children
are in total solidarity with their

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:13.470
are in total solidarity with their
 

00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:15.530
are in total solidarity with their
teachers because they recognize that

00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:15.540
teachers because they recognize that
 

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:18.350
teachers because they recognize that
when teachers work improves that they

00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:18.360
when teachers work improves that they
 

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:20.240
when teachers work improves that they
also benefit right now in too many

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:20.250
also benefit right now in too many
 

00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:22.940
also benefit right now in too many
places that's not the case that the

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:22.950
places that's not the case that the
 

00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:26.200
places that's not the case that the
teachers union has defined its interest

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:26.210
teachers union has defined its interest
 

00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:29.750
teachers union has defined its interest
in terms that are often antithetical

00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:29.760
in terms that are often antithetical
 

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:31.820
in terms that are often antithetical
with the children's interest and that's

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:31.830
with the children's interest and that's
 

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:33.260
with the children's interest and that's
a huge problem it's a problem for the

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:33.270
a huge problem it's a problem for the
 

00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:34.970
a huge problem it's a problem for the
unions because it means a lot of times

00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:34.980
unions because it means a lot of times
 

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:36.110
unions because it means a lot of times
they're not getting this political

00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:36.120
they're not getting this political
 

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:38.480
they're not getting this political
support they need and it's a problem for

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:38.490
support they need and it's a problem for
 

00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:40.340
support they need and it's a problem for
the schools because - or from the

00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:40.350
the schools because - or from the
 

00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:41.840
the schools because - or from the
school's work for the adults and not for

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:41.850
school's work for the adults and not for
 

00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:45.380
school's work for the adults and not for
the children

00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:45.390
 

00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:47.420
I think just the fact that it's so

00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:47.430
I think just the fact that it's so
 

00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:49.610
I think just the fact that it's so
difficult to remove ineffective teachers

00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:49.620
difficult to remove ineffective teachers
 

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:52.190
difficult to remove ineffective teachers
is a real problem it should not be that

00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:52.200
is a real problem it should not be that
 

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:54.530
is a real problem it should not be that
hard to get rid of people that we've

00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:54.540
hard to get rid of people that we've
 

00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:56.690
hard to get rid of people that we've
evaluated and that we know are not

00:14:56.690 --> 00:14:56.700
evaluated and that we know are not
 

00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:58.970
evaluated and that we know are not
effective it should not be that you have

00:14:58.970 --> 00:14:58.980
effective it should not be that you have
 

00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:00.710
effective it should not be that you have
a job for life just becoming to become a

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:00.720
a job for life just becoming to become a
 

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:03.530
a job for life just becoming to become a
teacher it's too important a job and

00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:03.540
teacher it's too important a job and
 

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:05.750
teacher it's too important a job and
that not only when you when you when you

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:05.760
that not only when you when you when you
 

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:08.060
that not only when you when you when you
allow ineffective teachers to remain in

00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:08.070
allow ineffective teachers to remain in
 

00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:09.920
allow ineffective teachers to remain in
schools in classrooms and that only

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:09.930
schools in classrooms and that only
 

00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:11.840
