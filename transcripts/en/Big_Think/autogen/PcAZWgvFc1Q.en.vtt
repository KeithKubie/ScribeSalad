what is it that distinguishes us from

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220
what is it that distinguishes us from
 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.789
what is it that distinguishes us from
you know cavemen

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799
you know cavemen
 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.220
you know cavemen
I would say it's the level of

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230
I would say it's the level of
 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.669
I would say it's the level of
abstraction that we can reach and you

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679
abstraction that we can reach and you
 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.999
abstraction that we can reach and you
know to give a simple example it used to

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009
know to give a simple example it used to
 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.650
know to give a simple example it used to
be that there was barter trading so you

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660
be that there was barter trading so you
 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.160
be that there was barter trading so you
would exchange you know you know wheat

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170
would exchange you know you know wheat
 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.620
would exchange you know you know wheat
for for meat or something like this but

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630
for for meat or something like this but
 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:22.910
for for meat or something like this but
then eventually there was an abstract

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920
then eventually there was an abstract
 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.939
then eventually there was an abstract
idea the idea of money of illnesses like

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949
idea the idea of money of illnesses like
 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.500
idea the idea of money of illnesses like
piece of paper but this piece of paper

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510
piece of paper but this piece of paper
 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.689
piece of paper but this piece of paper
actually signifies has certain value and

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699
actually signifies has certain value and
 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:30.859
actually signifies has certain value and
you can exchange it for goods and

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869
you can exchange it for goods and
 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.959
you can exchange it for goods and
services so that's the next level of

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969
services so that's the next level of
 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.360
services so that's the next level of
abstraction but now we are dealing with

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370
abstraction but now we are dealing with
 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.729
abstraction but now we are dealing with
even higher level abstraction because we

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739
even higher level abstraction because we
 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.799
even higher level abstraction because we
don't actually see money that much I see

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809
don't actually see money that much I see
 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.900
don't actually see money that much I see
the piece of plastic credit card so I

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910
the piece of plastic credit card so I
 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.030
the piece of plastic credit card so I
swiped my credit card so suddenly that's

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040
swiped my credit card so suddenly that's
 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.920
swiped my credit card so suddenly that's
the next level of abstraction so this

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930
the next level of abstraction so this
 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.869
the next level of abstraction so this
credit card somehow has become this

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879
credit card somehow has become this
 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.610
credit card somehow has become this
abstract entity which carries money

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620
abstract entity which carries money
 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.100
abstract entity which carries money
which itself carries certain wealth

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110
which itself carries certain wealth
 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.639
which itself carries certain wealth
right and now we're going even deeper

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:54.649
right and now we're going even deeper
 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:58.700
right and now we're going even deeper
now money could be nothing but a line of

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710
now money could be nothing but a line of
 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.790
now money could be nothing but a line of
code which appears in the Bitcoin ledger

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800
code which appears in the Bitcoin ledger
 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.009
code which appears in the Bitcoin ledger
so that's the kind of progression that's

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019
so that's the kind of progression that's
 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.750
so that's the kind of progression that's
the kind of you know evolution that I'm

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760
the kind of you know evolution that I'm
 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.910
the kind of you know evolution that I'm
talking about evolution of abstraction

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920
talking about evolution of abstraction
 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.910
talking about evolution of abstraction
and so abstraction is king in this brave

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920
and so abstraction is king in this brave
 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.910
and so abstraction is king in this brave
new world and the key to abstraction is

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920
new world and the key to abstraction is
 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.920
new world and the key to abstraction is
mathematics and I do believe that we

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930
mathematics and I do believe that we
 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.560
mathematics and I do believe that we
will have a better free society one when

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570
will have a better free society one when
 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.929
will have a better free society one when
we have less math ignorant and we have

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939
we have less math ignorant and we have
 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.700
we have less math ignorant and we have
less more understanding of mathematics

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710
less more understanding of mathematics
 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:26.960
less more understanding of mathematics
and of course I'm not saying everyone

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970
and of course I'm not saying everyone
 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.340
and of course I'm not saying everyone
should become a mathematician

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350
should become a mathematician
 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.050
should become a mathematician
on the contrary but what I would what I

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060
on the contrary but what I would what I
 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.810
on the contrary but what I would what I
dream of is a society in which if

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820
dream of is a society in which if
 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.420
dream of is a society in which if
mathematics is brought up people don't

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430
mathematics is brought up people don't
 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.270
mathematics is brought up people don't
run away from it it don't say oh my gosh

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280
run away from it it don't say oh my gosh
 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.240
run away from it it don't say oh my gosh
this is terrible I hate mathematics I

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250
this is terrible I hate mathematics I
 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.800
this is terrible I hate mathematics I
don't want to talk about it I'm scared

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810
don't want to talk about it I'm scared
 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.420
don't want to talk about it I'm scared
I'm frightened and I understand why

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430
I'm frightened and I understand why
 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.340
I'm frightened and I understand why
people are scared and frightened it's

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350
people are scared and frightened it's
 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.060
people are scared and frightened it's
not their fault

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070
not their fault
 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.800
not their fault
it's because of how mathematics is

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810
it's because of how mathematics is
 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.460
it's because of how mathematics is
taught in our schools but and it's a

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470
taught in our schools but and it's a
 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.200
taught in our schools but and it's a
very unfortunate situation when you

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210
very unfortunate situation when you
 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.539
very unfortunate situation when you
can't even begin a conversation about

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549
can't even begin a conversation about
 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.910
can't even begin a conversation about
mathematics without people saying oh my

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920
mathematics without people saying oh my
 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.499
mathematics without people saying oh my
gosh I don't wanna talk about it and

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509
gosh I don't wanna talk about it and
 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.630
gosh I don't wanna talk about it and
it's kind of strange because nobody

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640
it's kind of strange because nobody
 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.490
it's kind of strange because nobody
would ever say I hate literature or a

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500
would ever say I hate literature or a
 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.289
would ever say I hate literature or a
hit art or I hate music at least

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299
hit art or I hate music at least
 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.700
hit art or I hate music at least
intelligent people would never say that

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710
intelligent people would never say that
 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.740
intelligent people would never say that
it's kind of shameful to say that but

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750
it's kind of shameful to say that but
 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.390
it's kind of shameful to say that but
it's perfectly okay in our society to

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400
it's perfectly okay in our society to
 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.250
it's perfectly okay in our society to
say I

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260
say I
 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.460
say I
heat mathematics so so that's where I

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470
heat mathematics so so that's where I
 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.589
heat mathematics so so that's where I
think with so much work that can be done

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599
think with so much work that can be done
 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:19.809
think with so much work that can be done
and needs to be done and so what I dream

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819
and needs to be done and so what I dream
 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:21.850
and needs to be done and so what I dream
over the society in which not it's not

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860
over the society in which not it's not
 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.080
over the society in which not it's not
that everyone has a PhD in mathematics

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090
that everyone has a PhD in mathematics
 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.500
that everyone has a PhD in mathematics
but rather I would like to live in a

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510
but rather I would like to live in a
 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:27.970
but rather I would like to live in a
society in which if a mathematics is

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980
society in which if a mathematics is
 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.559
society in which if a mathematics is
brought up someone would say Oh

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569
brought up someone would say Oh
 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:32.110
brought up someone would say Oh
mathematics interesting how do I find

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120
mathematics interesting how do I find
 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.970
mathematics interesting how do I find
out more can you give me a gist of the

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980
out more can you give me a gist of the
 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.800
out more can you give me a gist of the
idea I'm not scared of it I'm curious

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810
idea I'm not scared of it I'm curious
 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.229
idea I'm not scared of it I'm curious
about it the way I'm curious about solar

aware of how mathematics invades our
