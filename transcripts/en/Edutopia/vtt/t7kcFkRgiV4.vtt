00:00:08.046 --> 00:00:10.206
&gt;&gt;My name is Connie.

00:00:10.536 --> 00:00:16.466
I was the founding principle
of Mesquite Elementary.

00:00:16.646 --> 00:00:22.096
I began my teaching career here
in Vail at Acacia Elementary

00:00:22.096 --> 00:00:24.086
and I was there for about four years.

00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:30.036
I thought oh if I could do my
dream school what would I do?

00:00:30.626 --> 00:00:34.276
And then when I was asked to be the
planning principal for this school

00:00:34.276 --> 00:00:37.806
and help plan it I was thinking,
you know, what can we do different?

00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:40.976
What can we do to really
help children?

00:00:47.046 --> 00:00:50.476
And then as we went into our
second and third year, you know,

00:00:50.476 --> 00:00:53.856
the state testing became
more and more and more.

00:00:53.856 --> 00:00:58.916
When the test scores came in
we just, you know, were really,

00:00:58.916 --> 00:01:02.706
really devastated to see
that say for instance

00:01:02.706 --> 00:01:04.596
that fifth grade I remember we were

00:01:04.596 --> 00:01:07.966
like in the thirty-ninth
percentile in math.

00:01:08.046 --> 00:01:12.446
You know, you think you're teaching
and that you're doing a good job,

00:01:12.446 --> 00:01:15.576
but then when we see that we knew
that something had to change.

00:01:17.156 --> 00:01:18.486
&gt;&gt;Katie: Well let's go
ahead and get started.

00:01:18.486 --> 00:01:20.756
In the enrichment strategies,
of course Jen,

00:01:20.756 --> 00:01:23.086
it's going to play an
important part with that.

00:01:23.196 --> 00:01:26.326
&gt;&gt;Connie: We just started, you
know, talking here as a team

00:01:26.396 --> 00:01:28.486
and we came up with a plan.

00:01:28.486 --> 00:01:31.016
We were going to start
implementing Reteach and Enrich

00:01:31.086 --> 00:01:33.976
in the second semester
which we did do.

00:01:34.136 --> 00:01:37.966
&gt;&gt;When the new system came and
we started all collaborating,

00:01:37.966 --> 00:01:40.856
the tracks were gone, the
collaboration was occurring,

00:01:41.316 --> 00:01:46.286
the sharing of ideas, so there has
been this great collaboration piece

00:01:46.756 --> 00:01:49.196
where we all really help each other.

00:01:49.256 --> 00:01:50.756
&gt;&gt;The staff came together.

00:01:50.786 --> 00:01:53.636
We were able to design the
Reteach and Enrich program

00:01:54.056 --> 00:01:56.786
and it was just amazing
what happened.

00:01:57.056 --> 00:02:01.086
&gt;&gt;So these formatives are a
way of assessing everything

00:02:01.086 --> 00:02:03.166
that you have learned about
prime and composite numbers.

00:02:03.636 --> 00:02:07.926
&gt;&gt;We wanted to give students an
opportunity to be retaught skills

00:02:07.926 --> 00:02:11.476
that they did not learn, so
what we did is we made sure

00:02:11.476 --> 00:02:15.556
that we had a time in the day where
if students did not master the skill

00:02:15.556 --> 00:02:19.396
that was previously taught, we
gave them time to master that.

00:02:19.396 --> 00:02:22.996
&gt;&gt;Connie: And the math scores jumped
tremendously when we got them back

00:02:23.526 --> 00:02:25.436
after that aims test and we went

00:02:25.436 --> 00:02:29.386
from a performing school
to an excelling school.

00:02:29.476 --> 00:02:30.946
It was the key to moving us up.

00:02:34.376 --> 00:02:39.696
The leadership in Vail, you know,
starts out with people like Katie.

00:02:41.466 --> 00:02:42.636
&gt;&gt;Katie: Connie was my mentor.

00:02:42.636 --> 00:02:46.866
I worked for her as a teacher
and really kind of followed

00:02:47.026 --> 00:02:49.896
in the footsteps of what
Connie started at Mesquite

00:02:49.896 --> 00:02:52.386
and have just expanded upon that.

00:02:52.386 --> 00:02:53.336
I'm Katie.

00:02:53.446 --> 00:02:55.436
I'm the principal of
Mesquite Elementary

00:02:55.436 --> 00:02:57.676
in the Vail School
District in Tucson, Arizona.

00:02:58.386 --> 00:03:02.986
&gt;&gt;Calvin: Connie was promoted and
Katie's name popped to the surface

00:03:03.116 --> 00:03:06.286
because leadership is not
something that comes with the title.

00:03:06.756 --> 00:03:09.316
Leadership is enhanced with a title.

00:03:09.766 --> 00:03:11.896
&gt;&gt;Katie: We're a team in
the Vail School District,

00:03:11.896 --> 00:03:15.386
and just as our teachers collaborate
and work together and share ideas,

00:03:15.776 --> 00:03:17.336
we do that at a district level.

00:03:18.866 --> 00:03:24.226
I really believe that it's exciting
to be a part of something successful.

00:03:24.476 --> 00:03:27.086
And I can go home every
night and know

00:03:27.086 --> 00:03:30.516
that we have positively
impacted the life of a child,

00:03:30.816 --> 00:03:34.676
and that what we're doing, we're
doing the best that we can for kids

00:03:35.186 --> 00:03:37.226
and so that helps me
go to sleep at night

00:03:37.306 --> 00:03:39.236
but it's also what gets
me up in the morning.
