The answer, even though you came in thinking you're about 2 meters tall, is definitely 1.97 meters.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Since these numbers are all so much closer to the average value of 1.97, I have more trust in this

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
doctor's ability to make measurements compared to this where the numbers are really far from 2.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
How do I quantify that trust in a measurement? We've already talked about taking an average.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Let's take what's called an average deviation, and this number measures on average

00:00:27.000 --> 99:59:59.000
how far each is your data points is away from the mean. So let's do an example.
