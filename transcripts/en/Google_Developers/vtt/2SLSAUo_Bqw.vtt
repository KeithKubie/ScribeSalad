LOUIS GRAY: Welcome to Google
Developers Weekly for

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.330
September 4, 2013, our highlight
reel of what's

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:16.210
happening in the world
of Google Developers

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:17.830
on the set and off.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.250
Before the Labor Day holiday
here in the United States, we

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.230
had a big week in our studios.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.090
So let's shake those cobwebs off
of our three-day weekend,

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.280
get back to work, and go
to those highlights.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.820
It's one thing to know how to
code, but it's quite another

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.760
to take that leap and start your
own company based on one

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.620
of your many brilliant ideas.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.100
Our good friends Martin Omander
and Don Dodge helped

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.160
us out with a pair of shows from
root access, covering how

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.550
startups can incorporate
and get funded.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.340
So you can go from having a
great idea to affording to eat

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.010
in between all those
all-nighters.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.930
Once you've started that company
and are building that

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.640
incredible app, you want to make
sure it looks good and

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.320
feels just right.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.750
That's why we brought in our
Dev UX team, led by Nazmul,

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.620
and they spoke to us on how to
be thinking about great design

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.490
when creating new
applications.

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.010
This week, they also showed us
how to invite the world to

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.630
your application through adding
social integration

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.690
through many social networks.

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.190
Also, as I said last week,
the best shows

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:14.590
are made into trilogies.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.130
I was lucky to have Chicago's
own Brian Fitzpatrick in

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.870
Mountain View for three
high-quality events to help

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.620
you take control of your career
and of your data.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.140
We started with everybody's
favorite, organizational

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.210
manipulation.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.740
We joined the data liberation
front, and we wrapped with a

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.750
deep dive into Google's
transparency report.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.510
Fitz Week might be over, but
the memories live on in

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.960
YouTube, and on the Google
Developers Live website.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.550
Here at GDL, when we're not
watching YouTube, you might

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.380
find us catching up on the
day's news with CNN.

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.290
Resident Glass guy Timothy
Jordan hosted Jeff Eddings of

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.320
CNN to talk about the
network's Glass app.

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.930
Timothy also taught the rest
of us about some cool new

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.420
options for commanding Glass
with your voice, including

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.800
integrations with social network
path and Evernote.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:00.505
OK, Glass.

00:02:00.505 --> 00:02:03.860
Send my information to path.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.655
Well beyond our Mountain View
campus, from Tel Aviv, Ido

00:02:06.655 --> 00:02:10.539
Green taught us how to debug
Node.js applications using

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.040
Chrome dev tools.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.015
Alberto Rossi in Milan showed
us how to build Android apps

00:02:15.015 --> 00:02:17.140
with HTML5 and JavaScript.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.280
And from Buenos Aires,
[INAUDIBLE]

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.110
presented on Google+ Sign In.

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.040
Live from New York, it was the
App Script team, taking your

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.680
questions in another edition
of Google Apps Unscripted,

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.710
while Ibraham Ulukaya partnered
up with Roman Nurik

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:36.195
to tackle best practices from
the YouTube APIs on Android

00:02:36.195 --> 00:02:38.030
and Android design.

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.230
Our users and developers span
the globe, so our studios and

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.360
engineers do, too.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.850
Away from our Google Developers
Live studios, the

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.910
GDGx team of talented engineers
has produced a new

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.800
Google Developer Groups app
for Android devices.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.740
This app provides direct access
to your favorite GDL

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.540
shows, along with news and
information about your local

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.310
GDG, and even achievements
that you can unlock.

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.520
That's not just GDGx,
that's GDG extreme.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.440
Promises have come to Chrome.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.530
In the HTML document object
model, a promise provides

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.180
asynchronous access to the
result of an operation,

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.710
whether it already took
place or not.

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:19.260
Francois Beaufort posted about
how promises come true in

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.120
Chrome 30 beta.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.972
We've come a long way.

00:03:22.972 --> 00:03:26.470
And Android developers, Android
Studio marches on.

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.530
The team has released version
0.2.6 with various bug fixes

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:31.760
to smooth your work.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.360
Be sure to update your Android
studio to take advantage of

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.480
the latest.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.290
And to make sure you take
advantage of the latest and

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.780
never miss a thing from the
world of Google Developers,

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.350
subscribe to Google Developers
on YouTube and check out the

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.860
GDL schedule at

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.220
I'm Louis Gray, and I'll
see you in the studio.
