00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.412
Hey it's me Destin, welcome
back to Smarter Every Day.

00:00:02.437 --> 00:00:04.349
I want to do something a
little bit different today,

00:00:04.374 --> 00:00:07.219
let's start with a story. Once there
was a kingdom where wealth was

00:00:07.244 --> 00:00:11.876
determined by what sheep you owned. There
was a rich man who had many, many sheep.

00:00:11.901 --> 00:00:15.467
Even his sheep were rich. There was
also a peasant family who only had

00:00:15.492 --> 00:00:18.151
one sheep but they loved her very much.

00:00:18.176 --> 00:00:20.624
The father of the house wanted
her to be the very best

00:00:20.649 --> 00:00:23.214
sheep she could be, so he
spent lots of time with her.

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:27.346
The sheep was basically a part of the family
and it participated in almost every aspect

00:00:27.371 --> 00:00:30.404
of their lives. One day a
traveller came to town to visit

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:32.741
the rich man and they
became business partners.

00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:34.862
That evening they were
hungry but the rich man was

00:00:34.887 --> 00:00:37.649
unwilling to take from his
own flock so the traveller

00:00:37.674 --> 00:00:41.335
pointed out to the peasant sheep. The
rich man's cook then took the sheep and

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.039
cut out the tasty parts. Together the
rich man and the traveller enjoyed

00:00:45.064 --> 00:00:47.382
the feast and their bellies were full.

00:00:47.407 --> 00:00:50.464
This crushed the family. The father
asked the rich man for another

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.856
sheep but he was ignored.
Oh man, that's sad.

00:00:53.881 --> 00:00:56.955
But it's real. The sheep is your
YouTube video, and the rich

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.063
man is Facebook. The traveller
is someone who uploads your

00:01:00.088 --> 00:01:03.049
video to Facebook so the two of
them can use what's yours and

00:01:03.074 --> 00:01:06.044
make money off of it. How do
internet videos make money?

00:01:06.069 --> 00:01:08.079
You've seen the ads at the
beginning of the video

00:01:08.104 --> 00:01:10.541
and you've heard that people
make a living on YouTube right?

00:01:10.566 --> 00:01:14.076
But what you don't know is it takes
a ridiculous number of these ads

00:01:14.101 --> 00:01:18.455
in order to make any kind of significant income.
This is why people jump at the opportunity

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.282
to get a sponsor for their videos.

00:01:20.307 --> 00:01:24.304
In fact there will be a sponsor
at the end of this very video.

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:27.845
Sometimes the videos themselves take
a lot of time and money to create.

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.894
Other times people just upload a video on a
whim and have a viral success on their hands.

00:01:31.919 --> 00:01:35.133
Either way the people made the
video and they deserve to reap any

00:01:35.158 --> 00:01:38.821
success or profit that comes from it right?
Here's the problem though.

00:01:38.846 --> 00:01:43.836
Sometimes people will steal a video and then
re-upload it as if they created it themselves.

00:01:43.861 --> 00:01:47.711
Flula is a German DJ friend of mine
who uploaded this hilarious video

00:01:47.736 --> 00:01:52.537
to YouTube called Jennifer is a Party Pooper.
This thing got over five million views in

00:01:52.562 --> 00:01:55.684
four years, which sounds
awesome until you realize that

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:59.394
a verified Facebook page downloaded
this video and then re-uploaded

00:01:59.419 --> 00:02:04.079
it into the Facebook player where it
received the same five million views

00:02:04.104 --> 00:02:08.466
in four days. Facebook's algorithm
prefers videos that are

00:02:08.491 --> 00:02:13.654
uploaded into its video player. Facebook
ran ads on five million views of

00:02:13.679 --> 00:02:18.438
Flula's video and made money off of it. I
wonder what Flula has to say about this.

00:02:18.463 --> 00:02:23.181
It's like I made a present for my friends
but then another person stole my present,

00:02:23.213 --> 00:02:25.963
wrapped it up and said "Hey
everyone, look at this present

00:02:25.988 --> 00:02:29.543
I made for you!". Doh.

00:02:30.554 --> 00:02:33.644
They ate his sheep. Eventually he
got Facebook to take the video

00:02:33.669 --> 00:02:35.306
down and I'm sure they were happy to do it

00:02:35.331 --> 00:02:39.038
because they had already made their money.
This is a serious issue and it's worth talking

00:02:39.063 --> 00:02:41.913
about. It's even been given
a name by Brady Haran

00:02:41.938 --> 00:02:44.352
from Hello Internet. - Freebooting.

00:02:44.933 --> 00:02:47.192
- Freebooting. - Freebooting.

00:02:47.217 --> 00:02:50.941
- Freebooting is the act of taking a
creation that someone else has made

00:02:50.966 --> 00:02:54.000
and then using it as if you
made it, in order to profit.

00:02:54.025 --> 00:02:57.741
Brady has a dozen channels that are really
high quality so he's freebooted often.

00:02:57.766 --> 00:03:01.110
This is a video he created of his
dog Audrey playing with bubbles.

00:03:01.135 --> 00:03:04.884
You'll notice that somebody else uploaded
it, and Facebook's running ads on it.

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:09.912
150,000 people have seen this. This
one's been viewed 1.2 million times but

00:03:09.937 --> 00:03:15.036
it's been shared 34,000 times.
That's about 34.5 views per share.

00:03:15.061 --> 00:03:16.869
This one doesn't even
have a view count on it.

00:03:16.894 --> 00:03:20.143
If you look, it's been shared over a
quarter million times and if we multiply

00:03:20.168 --> 00:03:25.354
times that previous ratio,
that's over 9.1 million views.

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:28.436
What is happening? Smarter Every
Day has also been a victim to

00:03:28.461 --> 00:03:30.915
this. In September I
uploaded the tattoo in slow

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.783
motion video and it was my
largest success to date.

00:03:33.808 --> 00:03:36.819
The largest privately owned
publishing company in Europe

00:03:36.844 --> 00:03:42.517
called Bauer Media Group, downloaded the
video, cut out all the educational content,

00:03:42.542 --> 00:03:46.193
cut out my sponsor, and cut out all
links back to Smarter Every Day

00:03:46.218 --> 00:03:49.020
and then re-uploaded it to
their verified Facebook page.

00:03:49.045 --> 00:03:53.804
I filled out forms, I sent emails, I
exhausted every option given to me by both

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:56.112
of these multi-billion dollar corporations.

00:03:56.137 --> 00:03:59.057
It was the most successful post
ever made to their Facebook page.

00:03:59.082 --> 00:04:01.282
So as I'm trying to get
it taken down over here,

00:04:01.307 --> 00:04:04.177
someone within the company is
re-uploading it and saying

00:04:04.202 --> 00:04:07.574
"In case you missed it". It wasn't
until the followers of Smarter Every

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:10.791
Day on Twitter re-tweeted this
tweet over 100 times that

00:04:10.816 --> 00:04:13.179
Facebook responded. Which is interesting.

00:04:13.204 --> 00:04:15.408
The slower and more drawn
out the process is,

00:04:15.433 --> 00:04:18.636
the more ads they can run against the
video before they finally shut it down.

00:04:18.661 --> 00:04:22.890
By the time it was eventually taken down,
the video had been viewed on Facebook over

00:04:22.915 --> 00:04:27.049
17 million times. I can tell you this.

00:04:27.074 --> 00:04:32.540
17 million views would have been some
serious, serious college fund money.

00:04:32.565 --> 00:04:36.143
So after 17 million views, this email was
sent from Dwayne at community operations at

00:04:36.168 --> 00:04:40.170
Facebook. "We understand
this action to resolve your

00:04:40.195 --> 00:04:44.637
intellectual property issue." Facebook
is currently designed so that when

00:04:44.662 --> 00:04:49.013
you finally do get that viral video, you
can see all of the financial benefit that

00:04:49.038 --> 00:04:51.970
you've dreamed of whisked away
in other people's Facebook news

00:04:51.995 --> 00:04:55.708
feeds and you'll be stuck
with an email saying that

00:04:55.733 --> 00:04:59.808
they understand that they've solved
your intellectual property issue.

00:04:59.833 --> 00:05:02.719
I am not trying to get you to
feel sorry for Smarter Every Day.

00:05:02.744 --> 00:05:07.414
I am so incredibly blessed and I am grateful
for everything that I have been entrusted

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:11.235
with. But I understand
also that not everyone has

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:16.782
a channel with 2 million intelligent subscribers.
So this happens thousands of times every day

00:05:16.807 --> 00:05:20.202
to people who have no voice
and they have no recourse.

00:05:20.227 --> 00:05:23.194
They try to make this sound all
complicated, but it's not.

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:25.621
Even my children can understand
what's going on here.

00:05:25.646 --> 00:05:28.497
(Destin) But they were hungry, so it's OK?
- No it's not.

00:05:28.522 --> 00:05:32.142
- Why not?
- Because it's someone else's sheep.

00:05:32.167 --> 00:05:36.652
- Yeah but they were hungry.
- And they should replace it, the traveller

00:05:36.677 --> 00:05:38.824
should.
- Why should the traveller replace it?

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:44.835
- Because he pointed it out.
- But what if I told you that every single

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:51.389
day the rich man gets another traveller to
bring him somebody else's sheep. What do

00:05:51.414 --> 00:05:55.846
you think about that?
- That is enough to go to jail.

00:05:55.871 --> 00:05:58.909
- Why? - Because he's stealing every day.

00:05:58.934 --> 00:06:02.175
- Oh. It's pretty simple isn't it.
- But what if there is no jails?

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.259
- You know he's got a good point. What if
there are no consequences for freebooting

00:06:05.284 --> 00:06:07.857
other people's content? I mean
people are telling me that there's

00:06:07.882 --> 00:06:11.608
no way an individual like you or me can go
up against multiple multi-billion dollar

00:06:11.633 --> 00:06:14.195
organizations. But is that true?

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.705
And we're gonna be ruined financially.
Really?

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:20.815
I mean if a six year old and an eight year old
can understand the social injustice that's

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.573
occurred, we have laws.

00:06:22.598 --> 00:06:24.803
Don't you think a court of
law can do the same thing?

00:06:24.828 --> 00:06:27.900
Maybe it's just that doing the right
thing is sometimes difficult,

00:06:27.925 --> 00:06:31.254
and scary. As of the upload
of this video, the two people

00:06:31.279 --> 00:06:33.582
that ate my sheep, the rich man
and the traveller, have refused

00:06:33.607 --> 00:06:36.487
to compensate, which I get.
That's really smart actually.

00:06:36.512 --> 00:06:40.033
Drag it out, make it hurt, hope that
the offended party loses interest.

00:06:40.058 --> 00:06:43.711
Facebook freebooting has got
to stop, and you can help.

00:06:43.736 --> 00:06:47.642
Any time you see freebooted content, anywhere
on the internet, do these three things.

00:06:47.667 --> 00:06:52.069
Capture, comment, contact. Capture
the freebooting. Take a screen shot

00:06:52.094 --> 00:06:55.622
or if you really want to document it, video
screen capture the freebooter stealing the

00:06:55.647 --> 00:06:57.950
content. Comment on the
freebooted material.

00:06:57.975 --> 00:07:01.211
State that it's stolen and point
people back to the original source.

00:07:01.236 --> 00:07:04.710
Contact the content creator and then
give them the freebooting evidence

00:07:04.735 --> 00:07:08.462
as well as the link to the freebooting. The
creator can then decide what legal action

00:07:08.487 --> 00:07:10.964
to take. Doing this will let
the content creator spend

00:07:10.989 --> 00:07:14.475
more time with their sheep. I apologize
if you detected any negativity

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:15.723
in this video, that's not the intent.

00:07:15.748 --> 00:07:17.614
I just want to be a voice
for people without a voice.

00:07:17.639 --> 00:07:20.812
For example Gordon, the guy that
creates music for Smarter Every Day.

00:07:20.837 --> 00:07:24.819
His music was also freebooted and as you
can see here it makes him really sad.

00:07:24.844 --> 00:07:27.997
Here's the deal. I pay Gordon so
we're gonna pay the bills right now

00:07:28.022 --> 00:07:33.248
with our sponsor, which is Audible.com. If you
want to support us go to audible.com/smarter,

00:07:33.273 --> 00:07:37.493
download any audio book you choose. I
recommend Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card.

00:07:37.518 --> 00:07:40.249
Let me tell you why. When I was
getting ready to make this video

00:07:40.274 --> 00:07:42.665
I listened to Ender's Game
and it totally pumped me up.

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:44.975
Ender is a weak little boy
that doesn't like to fight

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.122
but people always try to get after him. He
uses his superior intellect, even though

00:07:49.147 --> 00:07:52.019
he's weaker, to defeat these
foes, and he's so good at

00:07:52.044 --> 00:07:55.755
it that the whole human
race selects him to use

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:58.130
techniques, tactics and
procedures to defend them

00:07:58.155 --> 00:08:02.673
against an invading alien species. It's
so well written that the United States

00:08:02.698 --> 00:08:05.367
Marine Corps uses it as a recommended book.

00:08:05.392 --> 00:08:09.506
It's amazing. So, go get Ender's
Game by Orson Scott Card.

00:08:09.539 --> 00:08:13.200
It really helped me understand how
a weak man could even approach

00:08:13.225 --> 00:08:17.094
a superior foe. I recommend it.
Even if you just read it.

00:08:17.119 --> 00:08:20.654
Just go experience Ender's
Game by Orson Scott Card.

00:08:20.679 --> 00:08:25.981
You can get it for free at audible.com/smarter.
Again, thank you for sticking with me.

00:08:26.006 --> 00:08:29.172
I'm Destin, you're getting Smarter
Every Day. Have a good one.
