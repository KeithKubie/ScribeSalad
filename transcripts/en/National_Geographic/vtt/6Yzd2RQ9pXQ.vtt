00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.950
I want to take people out of their heads

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:17.490
I want origins to inject people with a

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:20.820
sense of wonder origins is the journey

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.760
of humankind it's basically show that

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.160
reinvents the sort of historical epic

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.550
from a modern perspective so through a

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.669
modern lens we look back at our origins

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:36.030
essentially how we became who we became

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:39.360
with episodes such as the origin of fire

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.540
and how that made us human or the origin

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.510
of war or the origin of Medicine how

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.789
these were transformative pivotal events

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.910
in human history so essentially the

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.860
origins of what made us human

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.449
if people have seen brain games they're

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:59.910
obviously aware that I'm very passionate

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:02.309
about making complex ideas accessible i

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.619
think when people watch origins they're

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.200
going to recognize a lot of what they've

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.920
seen me doing on the web expanded into

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.200
long-form the idea is to help people

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.150
transcend the the been there and done

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.040
that of the adults mind the sense that

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.570
we know it all the sense that we've seen

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.790
it all the sense that we understand at

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.939
all and it's gonna be like epic and

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.790
explosive and heady and it's gonna blow

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:33.669
people's minds

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:33.669
