00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.810
Let's do a few more examples of
solving radical equations.

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:11.120
Let's say I have the square root
of x plus 2 minus 2 is

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.740
equal to 0.

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.980
So just like I said in the last
video, we always want to

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.170
isolate the radical.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.890
And the best way I can think
of doing it over here, is

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.930
adding 2 to both sides
of this equation.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.400
So if you add 2 to both sides of
this equation, we are left

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.390
with the square root of x plus
2-- on the left-hand side this

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.630
cancels out --is equal to 2.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.100
And once you isolate one of
the radicals, then you're

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.980
ready to essentially, square
both sides of this.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.840
If we're dealing with a
square root, we square

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.080
both sides of this.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.510
Let's do that.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.460
So let's square both sides
of that equation.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.400
And then we get-- square root of
x plus 2 squared is just x

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.410
plus 2 is equal to 2 squared.

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.780
Is equal to 4.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.360
Subtract 2 from both sides
of this equation.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.730
We're left with x-- these 2's
cancel out --is equal to 2.

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.450
Now let's validate that this
is truly the case.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.090
That it works when we're taking
the principal root, not

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.670
both square roots or the
negative square root.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.910
Let's see, when we take the
principal root we get the

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:26.360
square root of 2-- that's our
answer --plus this 2, minus 2,

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.010
should be equal to 0.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:29.160
This is 4.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.070
The principal root of 4 is 2.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.350
2 minus 2 does indeed equal 0.

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.170
So this is a valid solution.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.190
It's not an extraneous
solution.

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.280
It works with the
principal root.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.940
Let's do one that doesn't
involve a square root.

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.500
Let's do one with a
higher power root.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:56.320
Let's say we have the fourth
root of x squared minus 9 is

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.310
equal to 2.

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.220
So you say, gee, Sal,
what do I do here?

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.130
Fourth root?

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.910
That's crazy.

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:03.460
How do we deal with
the fourth root?

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:04.830
And it's the same process.

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.700
When you had a square
root we squared it.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.039
When you have the fourth
root, we take it

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.620
to the fourth power.

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:12.490
And just as a bit of a review,
this could be completely

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:13.870
written like this.

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.680
Another way to write it would
be x squared minus 9 to the

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.750
1/4 power is equal to 2.

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.390
These are equivalent statements,
just different

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.010
ways of writing the
fourth root.

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.140
Now, if we raise both sides to
the fourth power, what happens

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.550
to this exponent right here?

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.010
If we raise something to an
exponent, and then raise that

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.520
to another exponent, we multiply
the exponents.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.500
So 1/4 times 4 is 1.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.190
So this just becomes x squared
minus 9 to the first power.

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.490
Or we could just write
x squared minus 9.

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.340
And that's going to be equal
to 2 to the fourth power.

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.060
2 to the fourth power
is, what?

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.020
2 times 2 is 4.

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.900
Times 2 is 8.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.870
Times 2 is 16.

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.930
There's two ways we can do it
actually at this point.

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.000
We can add 9 to both sides
of this equation.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.310
I'll do it this way in yellow.

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.730
So if you add 9 you get x
squared is equal to 25.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.855
Take the square root, not just
the principal square root,

00:03:11.855 --> 00:03:15.260
take the positive and negative
square root of both sides of

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.430
this equation and you get x is
equal to plus or minus 5.

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:21.470
That's one way.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.140
The other way-- sometimes it's
confusing, people forget to

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.660
take the positive and negative
square roots --is to do it the

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.420
way we've been doing all along
through solving traditional

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.015
quadratics, setting
them equal to 0.

00:03:31.015 --> 00:03:33.320
So what you do is you subtract
16 from both

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:34.590
sides of this equation.

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:40.180
If you do that you get x
squared minus 25, if we

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.230
subtract 16 from both sides,
is equal to 0.

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.410
So these two are equivalent.

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.000
Essentially, we're just
moving the 25 onto

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.780
the left-hand side.

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.490
We're just subtracting
25 from both sides

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:51.130
of this to get that.

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.620
But what this does is it puts us
in the form of a difference

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:54.370
of squares.

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:00.620
We know we can rewrite this as
x plus 5 times x minus 5.

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.390
We went over that several
videos ago.

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.120
And that will be equal to 0.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.120
And if the product of two
numbers is equal to 0, that

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.090
means that either one or both
of them is equal to 0.

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:18.390
So x plus 5 is equal to 0 or
x minus 5 is equal to 0.

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.530
And we get x is equal to
negative 5 or x is equal to

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.800
positive 5, which is what
we got right there.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.620
Now, the one thing we want to
make sure once again, is that

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.230
neither of these are extraneous
solutions.

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.060
Because when you're taking a
fourth root or when you take

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.520
something to the fourth
power, negative

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.520
numbers also disappear.

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.140
You can kind of view it as a
principal fourth root that

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.970
we're taking here.

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.070
A negative version of this could
have also been valid.

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.250
So let's make sure that
they both work.

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.630
Well, whether we put negative
5 or positive 5 here, this

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.240
right here is going to be 25.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.900
So you get the fourth root of
25 minus 9, which is the

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.930
fourth root of 16.

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.160
So this is the fourth root of
16, which is equal to 16 to

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.810
the 1/4 power.

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.060
Which is indeed, 2.

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.630
So both of these work.

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:14.850
When you square either of these,
you do indeed, get 25.
