00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.260 align:start position:0%

mean<00:01:01.260><c> you</c><00:01:01.410><c> had</c><00:01:01.620><c> some</c><00:01:01.890><c> ideas</c><00:01:02.399><c> about</c><00:01:02.579><c> certain</c>

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 align:start position:0%
mean you had some ideas about certain
 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.230 align:start position:0%
mean you had some ideas about certain
surface<00:01:03.719><c> structures</c><00:01:04.290><c> but</c><00:01:04.979><c> you</c><00:01:05.159><c> never</c><00:01:05.370><c> saw</c><00:01:06.090><c> it</c>

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 align:start position:0%

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.050 align:start position:0%

in<00:01:06.479><c> so</c><00:01:07.320><c> to</c><00:01:07.380><c> speak</c><00:01:07.650><c> in</c><00:01:08.100><c> real</c><00:01:08.310><c> space</c><00:01:09.170><c> so</c><00:01:11.060><c> it's</c>

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 align:start position:0%
in so to speak in real space so it's
 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.320 align:start position:0%
in so to speak in real space so it's
just<00:01:12.299><c> like</c><00:01:12.479><c> if</c><00:01:12.690><c> you</c><00:01:12.840><c> would</c><00:01:13.670><c> trace</c><00:01:14.670><c> a</c><00:01:14.700><c> surface</c>

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 align:start position:0%

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.170 align:start position:0%
just like if you would trace a surface

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 align:start position:0%
with your finger you see so you see it
 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.130 align:start position:0%
with your finger you see so you see it
in<00:01:18.360><c> the</c><00:01:18.450><c> real</c><00:01:18.570><c> space</c><00:01:18.869><c> and</c><00:01:19.440><c> then</c><00:01:20.190><c> of</c><00:01:20.340><c> course</c>

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 align:start position:0%
in the real space and then of course
 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.800 align:start position:0%
in the real space and then of course
actually<00:01:22.140><c> you</c><00:01:22.470><c> see</c><00:01:22.710><c> the</c><00:01:22.920><c> electrons</c><00:01:23.549><c> on</c><00:01:24.479><c> the</c>

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 align:start position:0%
actually you see the electrons on the
 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.260 align:start position:0%
actually you see the electrons on the
surface<00:01:25.020><c> it's</c><00:01:25.560><c> it's</c><00:01:26.250><c> electronic</c><00:01:27.060><c> wave</c>

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 align:start position:0%
surface it's it's electronic wave
 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.440 align:start position:0%
surface it's it's electronic wave
functions<00:01:27.930><c> and</c><00:01:28.140><c> and</c><00:01:28.440><c> so</c><00:01:29.369><c> you</c><00:01:29.430><c> also</c><00:01:29.790><c> can</c><00:01:30.000><c> see</c>

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 align:start position:0%
functions and and so you also can see
 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:41.980 align:start position:0%
functions and and so you also can see
certain<00:01:30.990><c> properties</c><00:01:34.130><c> you</c><00:01:35.130><c> can</c><00:01:35.460><c> see</c><00:01:37.790><c> you</c><00:01:38.790><c> can</c>

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.380 align:start position:0%
 
you<00:01:42.990><c> can</c><00:01:43.320><c> test</c><00:01:43.650><c> the</c><00:01:43.860><c> hardness</c><00:01:44.460><c> of</c><00:01:44.670><c> a</c><00:01:44.850><c> surface</c>

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 align:start position:0%
you can test the hardness of a surface
 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.050 align:start position:0%
you can test the hardness of a surface
but<00:01:46.170><c> then</c><00:01:46.409><c> of</c><00:01:46.530><c> course</c><00:01:46.560><c> in</c><00:01:47.070><c> this</c><00:01:47.280><c> in</c><00:01:47.610><c> the</c><00:01:47.790><c> same</c>

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 align:start position:0%
but then of course in this in the same
 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.130 align:start position:0%
but then of course in this in the same
way<00:01:48.330><c> you</c><00:01:49.110><c> also</c><00:01:49.290><c> can</c><00:01:49.710><c> take</c><00:01:50.310><c> atoms</c><00:01:51.140><c> the</c>

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 align:start position:0%
way you also can take atoms the
 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.140 align:start position:0%
way you also can take atoms the
principle<00:01:52.680><c> is</c><00:01:52.740><c> the</c><00:01:52.770><c> same</c><00:01:52.920><c> as</c><00:01:53.310><c> if</c><00:01:53.520><c> you</c><00:01:53.729><c> take</c>

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 align:start position:0%
principle is the same as if you take
 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:55.940 align:start position:0%
principle is the same as if you take

the<00:02:36.640><c> first</c><00:02:36.909><c> surprise</c><00:02:37.720><c> was</c><00:02:37.750><c> that</c><00:02:38.230><c> video</c><00:02:38.379><c> they</c>

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 align:start position:0%
the first surprise was that video they
 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.220 align:start position:0%
the first surprise was that video they

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 align:start position:0%
could do it with atomic resolution you
 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.240 align:start position:0%
could do it with atomic resolution you

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 align:start position:0%
see actually that you can do it with
 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.179 align:start position:0%

only may need to work yeah and then see
 

00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:20.100 align:start position:0%
only may need to work yeah and then see
a<00:24:18.280><c> lot</c><00:24:18.550><c> of</c><00:24:18.580><c> people</c><00:24:19.120><c> that</c><00:24:19.270><c> are</c><00:24:19.360><c> very</c><00:24:19.510><c> skeptic</c>

a lot of people that are very skeptic
that's<00:24:20.290><c> right</c><00:24:20.500><c> yeah</c><00:24:20.740><c> but</c><00:24:20.980><c> okay</c><00:24:21.400><c> that</c><00:24:21.880><c> that</c><00:24:22.810><c> was</c>

00:24:23.010 --> 00:24:23.020 align:start position:0%

00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:28.150 align:start position:0%
their problem and so what wonderful

00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:34.660 align:start position:0%
devil-may-care and I mean we knew what
 

00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:38.190 align:start position:0%
devil-may-care and I mean we knew what

00:24:38.190 --> 00:24:38.200 align:start position:0%
we were doing doing that was real and if
 

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:40.440 align:start position:0%
we were doing doing that was real and if
people<00:24:38.500><c> thought</c><00:24:38.980><c> that</c><00:24:39.280><c> you</c><00:24:39.580><c> cannot</c><00:24:40.030><c> do</c><00:24:40.270><c> it</c>

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:40.450 align:start position:0%
people thought that you cannot do it
 

00:24:40.450 --> 00:24:43.350 align:start position:0%
people thought that you cannot do it
even<00:24:40.810><c> if</c><00:24:40.930><c> you</c><00:24:41.080><c> could</c><00:24:41.320><c> do</c><00:24:41.530><c> it</c><00:24:41.740><c> that's</c><00:24:42.490><c> I</c><00:24:42.940><c> think</c>

00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:43.360 align:start position:0%
even if you could do it that's I think
 

00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:50.070 align:start position:0%
even if you could do it that's I think
that's<00:24:43.600><c> their</c><00:24:43.870><c> problem</c><00:24:45.690><c> okay</c><00:24:46.720><c> and</c><00:24:47.940><c> in</c><00:24:48.940><c> 1986</c>

00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
that's their problem okay and in 1986

00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:31.960 align:start position:0%

that's<00:25:32.770><c> aa</c><00:25:32.950><c> little</c><00:25:33.160><c> bit</c><00:25:33.370><c> different</c><00:25:34.560><c> how</c><00:25:35.560><c> do</c>

00:25:35.610 --> 00:25:35.620 align:start position:0%
that's aa little bit different how do
 

00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:39.780 align:start position:0%
that's aa little bit different how do
you<00:25:35.740><c> say</c><00:25:37.140><c> extra</c><00:25:38.140><c> elevation</c><00:25:38.620><c> yes</c><00:25:38.830><c> yes</c><00:25:39.280><c> that's</c>

00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:39.790 align:start position:0%
you say extra elevation yes yes that's
 

00:25:39.790 --> 00:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
you say extra elevation yes yes that's
so<00:25:40.150><c> but</c><00:25:40.390><c> on</c><00:25:40.630><c> the</c><00:25:40.810><c> other</c><00:25:40.900><c> hand</c><00:25:41.050><c> I</c><00:25:42.060><c> mean</c><00:25:43.060><c> you</c>

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:43.210 align:start position:0%
so but on the other hand I mean you
 

00:25:43.210 --> 00:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
so but on the other hand I mean you
haven't<00:25:43.540><c> been</c><00:25:43.630><c> something</c><00:25:44.260><c> different</c><00:25:44.410><c> you</c>

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:52.170 align:start position:0%
