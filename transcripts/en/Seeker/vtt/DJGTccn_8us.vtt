00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.710
This episode of DNews is brought to you by
Norton.

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:06.670
As the old saying goes, "On the the Internet,
no one know you're an *beep*," and science

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:18.420
is showing, cyberbullying has some long-lasting
effects.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.939
Our parents had bullies, they stole their
lunch money on the walk to school and beat

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:27.679
them up out of sight of the teachers, but
cyberbullies don't have to go far to get out

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:29.279
of sight or find a victim.

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.570
A study in School Psychology Quarterly found
when it comes to bullying: girls were more

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.739
likely to be victims of verbal or relational
assaults, while boys were more likely to be

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:45.710
physically bullied, and as kids age the physical
bullying peters out, but cyberbullying increases.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.899
According to research in Psicothema, one in
four teens were cyber-bullied in the year

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:52.559
prior to the study.

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.629
And unlike old school bullying, the internet
is in your pocket all the time thanks to smartphones.

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.089
63 percent of the teens said they never shut
off their phones, so they can be bullied anywhere,

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:07.110
and as more people carry devices like phones
and laptops the numbers will grow.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.180
The long-term effects of this round-the-clock
bullying are just beginning to be studied.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.360
According to the same Psicothema study, with
most, the cyberbullying lasted less than a

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.390
month; but four percent of teens said they'd
been regularly cyber-bullied for three to

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.580
six months and three percent for more than
a year!

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.210
That's a LOT of bullying!

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.680
And it doesn't stop there, the Boston Children's
Hospital released a study earlier this year,

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.840
that says even though the bullying stops,
the harm sticks around forever.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.530
People who experienced harrassment at any
age experienced worse mental and physical

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.000
health later in life, plus increased depressive
symptoms and lower self-worth.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.399
Another study in the Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences found victims of bullying

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:54.820
had increases in anxiety disorders, panic
disorder, and depression, additionally, people

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.869
who were bullied had higher levels of C-reactive
protein, a biomarker which has been linked

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:01.979
to higher cardiovascular risks.

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.030
Bullies, they had lower levels of that protein.

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.030
Jerks.

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.640
Anyway, the reasons aren't clear, but a study
by the Family Institute at Northwestern University

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.950
said teenagers have more difficulty processing
and dealing with cyber bullying, than classic

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.330
bullying simply because online is more solitary.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.060
No one comes to the victim's defence, and
it's difficult for a victim to work out differences

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.420
with the bully.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.230
This isn't just a kids issue either, climate
scientists are cyberbullied constantly.

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.950
Gavin Schmidt, a climate scientist for NASA,
told Scientific American he gets a lot of

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.610
hate mail and intimidating letters.

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.800
Journalists, myself included, also experience
bullying on a regular basis.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.780
It's not easy to put your face on YouTube,
knowing that everything you say or do will

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.360
be commented on; usually negatively.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.940
Again, females have it worse than males, as
exposed by the current #GamerGate bullcrap.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.920
But that's neither here nor there.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.120
Cyberbullying is truly horrible to the people
it affects, and it's becoming such a growing

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.650
problem a 13-year-old from Chicago entered
a project in the Google Science Fair that

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.950
cut bullying comments by 93.43 percent -- her
invention?

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.260
A piece of software that identifies a mean
comment and simply asks if they're sure they

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.780
want to post it.

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.160
Almost everyone tested reconsidered.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.770
Luckily thereâ€™s already software out there
to protect you from cyberbullying and other

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:22.810
online dangers out there -

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.481
so a big thank you to Norton for protecting
the vulnerable AND for sponsoring the show.

00:03:27.481 --> 00:03:29.560
Have you ever been a victim of cyberbullying?

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.620
Bullies in general?

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:42.260
We're here for you, we're a community.
