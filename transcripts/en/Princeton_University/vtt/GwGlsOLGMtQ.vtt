TYLER SIMKO: My research
focuses on local politics,

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.740
like the people that serve on
your school board and the city

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:07.320
council.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.970
And these people have more of an
immediate impact on your life.

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:13.940
And I think that they
get too frequently ignored

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:15.140
in the literature.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:16.730
My name is Tyler Simko.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.710
I'm a senior in the
politics department

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.320
and in the Program for
Statistics and Machine

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.030
Learning.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.420
This year during my
second term on the board,

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.720
I was elected as president
of the South Amboy

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.310
Board of Education,
which has been

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.800
a very exciting new
opportunity for me.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.940
I'm involved in the budget,
the education, the staffing,

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:39.930
the policies.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.390
I'm the one that leads
all the public meetings.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.000
And I try to go to all
the events and the games.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.490
It's trying to be a
face for the board

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:52.410
and to show them that we're not
this scary, abstract body that

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.520
makes all the decisions.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.076
But we're there to serve
the students and the public.

00:00:57.076 --> 00:00:58.950
JORGE DIAZ: It's an
honor not only for myself

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.520
as a superintendent to have
Tyler, who was not too long

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.090
ago a student here.

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:07.530
He's a product of our community
not only as a student,

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.130
but also as a valedictorian.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.030
So I think as a community, we're
very proud of not only what

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.738
he accomplished here
as student, but what

00:01:13.738 --> 00:01:16.350
he's accomplishing as a
student at Princeton University

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.704
and now serving in a leadership
capacity on our school board.

00:01:19.704 --> 00:01:21.370
TYLER SIMKO: So at
every door you go to,

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.752
you'll start with the script,
you'll read it through.

00:01:24.752 --> 00:01:25.460
But you'll only --

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.300
KOSUKE IMAI: Tyler
found very interesting

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.550
the idea of using
statistics and data

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.940
analysis to study political
problems and social science

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:33.780
problems.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.550
When he run for the education
board in his hometown,

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.940
he ran the randomized
experiment on trying

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.310
to examine how different
campaign messages affect

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:46.170
the voters.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.040
I hope that other students
will take from Tyler's story

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.840
that there are so
many things you

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.500
can do if you take all the
opportunities seriously

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.450
and work hard.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.669
Through the senior thesis
and junior papers,

00:01:59.669 --> 00:02:01.335
you can actually make
a huge difference.

00:02:01.335 --> 00:02:03.779

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:06.320
TYLER SIMKO: I decided to teach
through the Freshmen Scholars

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.289
Institute because I think
it's very important for places

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.960
like Princeton to
ensure that students

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.790
from all different
types of backgrounds

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.660
can succeed at Princeton.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.120
Oh it's one's story
to have the experience

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.270
to be accepted to Princeton.

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.360
But trying to succeed
once they get here

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.310
is an entirely different story.

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.620
Programs like FSI
introduce students

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.010
to a community of
students that are going

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.940
through the same types of things
as them and can support them,

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.840
both during the program
and then afterwards.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.540
The most important thing that
you can do for other students

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:43.880
is to be a mentor.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.740
Students that come from either
first-generation backgrounds

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.231
or from schools like
ours that don't always

00:02:49.231 --> 00:02:50.730
send kids to Princeton,
I don't think

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.890
that those students
should have to figure out

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.480
the whole process on their own.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.761
If I can help them in some
way with my own experiences,

00:02:57.761 --> 00:02:58.260
I will.
