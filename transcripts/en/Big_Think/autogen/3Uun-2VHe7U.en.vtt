wasn't any serious knowledge about the

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529
wasn't any serious knowledge about the
 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.939
wasn't any serious knowledge about the
mechanistic nature of the human brain

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:18.949
mechanistic nature of the human brain
 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:23.660
mechanistic nature of the human brain
and now we know of ton we know how their

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670
and now we know of ton we know how their
 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.580
and now we know of ton we know how their
brain is organized we know that it comes

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590
brain is organized we know that it comes
 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.560

with structure we know that as knowledge

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570
with structure we know that as knowledge
 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.259
with structure we know that as knowledge
in it we know how we're learning more

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269
in it we know how we're learning more
 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.139
in it we know how we're learning more
and more each day how it makes decisions

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149
and more each day how it makes decisions
 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.130
and more each day how it makes decisions
in other words we're learning how the

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140
in other words we're learning how the
 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.139
in other words we're learning how the
thing works so if you think about it

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149
thing works so if you think about it
 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.590

and then looking at how they work you

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840
and then looking at how they work you
 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.049
