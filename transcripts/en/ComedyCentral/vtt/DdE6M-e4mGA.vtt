00:00:01.567 --> 00:00:04.537
I wrote it, I sent it, I'm ****d

00:00:12.344 --> 00:00:14.447 align:start size:97% position:3%
- My world was turned upside
down when my very first

00:00:14.447 --> 00:00:16.916
boyfriend ever, Hey Nick,
changed his relationship

00:00:16.916 --> 00:00:20.253 align:start size:97% position:3%
status from in a relationship,
to it's complicated,

00:00:20.253 --> 00:00:21.787
without even telling me.

00:00:21.787 --> 00:00:23.589
I didn't call him about it.

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:28.027
I sent him a five page email
that was full of expletives,

00:00:28.027 --> 00:00:31.797 align:start size:97% position:3%
all caps, enraged, humiliated,
as if what he had done

00:00:31.797 --> 00:00:34.434
was sent like a press release
to every major news outlet

00:00:34.434 --> 00:00:36.803
in the country, and I
was the last to know.

00:00:36.803 --> 00:00:39.071
It was horrible, I reacted
totally inappropriately.

00:00:39.071 --> 00:00:40.707 align:start size:94% position:6%
And I kept sending emails,
he never responded.

00:00:40.707 --> 00:00:42.275 align:start size:94% position:6%
I'd send another one,
'cause, you know, you keep

00:00:42.275 --> 00:00:44.043
thinking of things to say.

00:00:44.043 --> 00:00:47.113
And then at the end of it, it
was just totally humiliating,

00:00:47.113 --> 00:00:50.749
and I said, (laughs) "We'll
talk later, I have a board

00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:53.453 align:start size:88% position:13%
"meeting tonight", which
was technically true.

00:00:53.453 --> 00:00:55.955
I was a temp at a place
that had a board meeting,

00:00:55.955 --> 00:00:57.289 align:start size:84% position:16%
but I was just
taking notes there.

00:00:57.289 --> 00:00:58.792 line:0%
And, we never talked again.

00:00:58.792 --> 00:01:02.662 line:0%
I ended the relationship,
because he changed it.

00:01:02.662 --> 00:01:06.799 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
So, Protip, don't use all
caps ever when sending emails,

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:10.637
because it just makes you
look crazy and unhinged.

00:01:10.637 --> 00:01:11.638
Just be cool.
