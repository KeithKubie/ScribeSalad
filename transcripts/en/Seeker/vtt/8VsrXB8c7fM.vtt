00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.980
I think we can all agree that fighter jets
are pretty sweet.

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:09.110
But sweet as they are, almost all of them
still lack one amazing feature of their whirlygig

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:11.209
helicopter cousins; the ability to hover.

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:21.020
Come on, it’s 2017 people, where are the
hovering jets?

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.000
The problem is a fundamental one.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.590
You can think of the rotors of a helicopter
as wings.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.279
They’re constantly moving through the air,
generating lift, even when the chopper is

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.839
hovering in place.

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:34.590
But jets, with their airfoils fixed in place,
need to keep moving forward.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.040
If they don’t go fast enough their wings
don’t generate enough lift, and the jet

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.560
is essentially a very expensive rock.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.680
But there is a way around this.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.590
Why bother using the wings at all?

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:49.240
Heck you’ve got a mighty jet engine underneath
you, just point it at the ground and blast

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.630
off!

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.840
Over the years engineers have tried a few
different approaches, but the most successful

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.440
idea was to use thrust vectoring, like on
the Boeing AV-8B Harrier II.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.140
The Harrier’s engine has four nozzles that
can swivel.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.810
They can be pointed downward for vertical
takeoff, landing, and hovering.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.579
Or they can be pointed backwards, and the
Harrier flies like any other jet.

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:13.390
That doesn’t mean all the problems are solved.

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.920
Unlike a helicopter, whose spinning blades
act like a gyroscope and stabilize it, a hovering

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.689
Harrier has to be balanced on its thrust,
which is no easy feat.

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.189
Worse, since there’s no air passing over
the wings, the normal control surfaces are

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.189
useless.

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:31.499
Cleverly, the Harrier sends compressed air
from its engine out of the nose, tail, and

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:35.499
wingtips so the pilot can still control the
aircraft while in a hover.

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:40.130
The next generation of fighter, the F-35B,
will also have the ability to hover using

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.250
its thrust-vectored jet engine and a giant
fan tucked behind the pilot.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.520
But because of the engineering challenge and
the skill needed to fly them, it’s no surprise

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.109
that hovering jets are the exception, not
the norm.
