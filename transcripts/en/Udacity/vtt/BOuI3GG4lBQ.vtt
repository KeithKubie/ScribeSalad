Side A is 10 m.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
There's a variety of ways you could have done this.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
You could have compared A to B or A to C.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
In fact, you could have used some other tricks.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
You could have used the Pythagorean Theorem

00:00:12.000 --> 99:59:59.000
or compared across these triangles, but we're not going to worry about that right now.
