00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:02.680
&gt;&gt;Rocky Garff: Alright, well let's get started.
I'd like to welcome everyone out to this Leading

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:08.450
at Google series talk. My name's Rocky Garff
I'm a manager in the Media and Platform Solutions

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.320
Group here at Google and it's my pleasure
to welcome Liz Wiseman and Greg McKeown, the

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.619
authors of the-the Multipliers book.

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:20.630
I actually met Greg a couple years ago when
I moved into his neighborhood and over the

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.890
course of the last years I've actually talked
with him and Liz about the ideas in this book.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.350
I've heard them present and I-I really think
it's gonna be interesting for a lot of you

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.140
so.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:37.130
The book came out about a week ago and has
made a run to, it hit the top-top 25 on Amazon

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:42.180
and it's-it's in the top 10 for the leadership
category on Amazon so it's been well received

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.210
by the market and just glad to have you guys
here with us today and-and turn the time over

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:48.210
to you.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.990
[applause]

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:59.050
&gt;&gt;Liz Wiseman: Well good afternoon. I am Liz
Wiseman and I'm the author of Multipliers.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.570
I'm the President of a little company called
Wiseman Group, and I'm here with my partner,

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.570
Greg McKeown.

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:11.890
The work that we do is really to develop executive
talent, a lot of that here in Silicon Valley,

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:17.040
and to build multiplier leadership around
the world. We're really excited to be here

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.040
with you.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.440
Greg is originally from London, England, which
you will hear in a few minutes when you hear

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.670
him talk. He came out to the States to go
to business school at Stanford, and he and

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.670
I have been working together ever since.

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:37.130
Our remarks today are gonna be focused on
a very simple idea. And the idea is that leaders

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:43.230
can be multipliers. That in their role as
leaders and what they do as a leader they

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:50.180
can make people more capable, more productive,
and we would venture to say smarter.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.490
They can actually be multipliers.

00:01:52.490 --> 00:02:00.650
I want to start with a very simple question.

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.050
[pause]

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:10.090
What is the fate of the smart and the talented?
What do we do with our smartest, most talented,

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.959
most capable people inside organizations.
What do we do with them?

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:14.959
[pause]

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:15.959
Louder.

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:16.959
&gt;&gt;voice in audience: More work.

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.269
&gt;&gt;Liz Wiseman: We give 'em more work.

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:24.290
What do we do with the smartest and the most
talented people inside organizations? Quite

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:30.200
often organizations promote them, and they
promote them into management. But the problem

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.540
is that many of these leaders have spent years
being reinforced for their own ideas, their

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.739
own intelligence, their own capability. And
sometimes these leaders don't look beyond

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:47.629
their own capability to really see and use
the genius that sits on their team.

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:52.471
Leaders who don't make this transition can
end up draining intelligence and capability

00:02:52.471 --> 00:02:57.799
from people around them, and they can actually
become what call "diminishers" -- diminishers

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:00.730
of talent and capability.

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.739
Now through our research we have seen a different
model of leadership. We've seen a model where

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:13.280
leaders use their smarts and their intellect
to amplify the intelligence of people around

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.969
them. And we called these leaders "multipliers."

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:22.790
And what you're gonna see today is what our
research showed that these leaders don't get

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.980
a little bit more from the people they work
with, they get vastly more. In fact they get

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.930
up to twice the capability from people around
them.

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.469
As Greg and I are-are sharing our thoughts
with you today, I'd you to do a couple things.

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:40.849
I'd like you to think about a leader that
you've worked with; someone around whom you

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:46.150
were, you were brilliant, you were capable,
you did your best work, you solved hard, complex

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.079
problems.

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:53.120
And then think about another leader around
whom you struggled to do tough things; someone

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.159
that made you question your own intelligence.
Maybe around someone that you ended up holding

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:02.309
back, you couldn't give your full capability.

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:08.370
I'd also like you to think about your own
tendencies as a leader. I'd like you to think,

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:14.459
"Are you a multiplier, someone who uses their
intelligence to amplify the intelligence of

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:21.220
others, or are you like many of us who maybe
have a little bit of diminisher in you?" And

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.530
I'd like you to think about that as we go
through our remarks.

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:30.159
First let me introduce you to some of these
leaders that we studied. We did a global research

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:33.580
project over two years and these are some
of the leaders that we encountered.

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:41.370
Lutz Ziob, General Manager of Microsoft Learning.
His people say of Lutz, "Lutz creates an environment

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:48.780
where good things happen. He hires great people,
he allows them to make mistakes, and he ferociously

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:54.229
debates the most important decisions with
his management team and his whole organization."

00:04:54.229 --> 00:05:02.430
Sue Siegel, former President of Affymetrix,
whose partner says of Sue, she's now a venture

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:09.110
capitalist at Mohr Davidow Ventures. Her partner
says of Sue, "There's a Sue Effect. Everyone

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:15.941
around her grows and companies grow under
her guidance." He says, "I've often wonder

00:05:15.941 --> 00:05:19.960
what people are like when they're not around
Sue."

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.620
Greg and I went to go interview her. We had
this fabulous interview. We walked out of

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.300
the parking lot we're like, "Oh that was a
great question! Oh that was funny! You were

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.659
funny! We were so smart!"

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:30.659
[laughter]

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:37.050
And then we're like, "Oh, that wasn't really
us." [laughs] She was smart and we felt brilliant

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.289
around Sue. We kinda joked that we got Sued.

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:46.539
But there is this Sue Effect that people are
at their best around Sue Siegel.

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:52.629
Narayana Murthy, former CEO, former Chairman
of the Board of Infosys, one of the jewels

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:59.139
of India, who built a five billion dollar
company, 100,000 people strong, and he built

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:05.400
it on the idea of hiring really smart people,
smarter than himself, and building a management

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.460
team that could secede him.

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:12.930
He turned the reins over to Nandan Nilekani
years before it was time for him to step down,

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:17.370
and then Nandan Nilekani did the same thing,
turning the reins over to someone else with

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:20.500
that organization continuing and not skipping
a beat.

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:27.479
KR Sridhar, CEO of Bloom Energy, the innovators
of the Bloom Box which has gotten a lot of

00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:32.389
media attention lately, and I guess there
are probably a rack of Bloom Boxes here on

00:06:32.389 --> 00:06:37.050
this campus. It's a green tech firm that builds
a clean fuel source.

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:46.569
KR is a brilliant scientist himself. In fact
he literally is a former NASA rocket scientist.

00:06:46.569 --> 00:06:52.280
But what he does is he creates an environment
where people can experiment and he creates

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:58.460
an environment of a lot of pressure, but absolutely
no stress.

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:05.139
How do you create an environment with lots
of pressure but no stress? How would you do

00:07:05.139 --> 00:07:06.139
that?

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:12.900
[pause]

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:14.189
Lots of pressure, no stress.

00:07:14.189 --> 00:07:19.550
He holds people absolutely accountable for
running the experiments -- run the experiments

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:23.340
 -- test the science, but he doesn't hold
them accountable for the outcome.

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:26.160
[pause]

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:32.969
And lastly, Bill Campbell. Bill Campbell who
is well known as the former CEO of Intuit,

00:07:32.969 --> 00:07:40.250
a fellow who's a former Columbia football
coach turned business executive, who's not

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:45.770
a technologist but has a reputation for working
well with technologists because in his words,

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:51.050
"They have a genius that I don't have." He
sees that genius, he admires that genius,

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:57.340
and he's able to bring out that intelligence
and use it inside the organization.

00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:03.199
But maybe not so well known as the former
CEO of Intuit, he has become the coach to

00:08:03.199 --> 00:08:09.460
some of Silicon Valley's top executives: Steve
Jobs at Apple, Eric Schmidt here at Google,

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:12.310
and many others at Google and-and other companies.

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:17.169
We're gonna talk a little bit more about Bill
later.

00:08:17.169 --> 00:08:23.939
We discovered these multipliers, these people
as Greg and I embarked on our research journey

00:08:23.939 --> 00:08:30.830
that started in a very simple observation.
It, so it's an observation based on my 17

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:35.600
years at Oracle where I ran the corporate
university and got to work with the top executive

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:36.600
team.

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:41.370
And Oracle was known for hiring really, really
smart people. And I looked out at this executive

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:47.760
team and they were all brilliant. It's one
they all had in common. But they didn't all

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:50.090
bring out brilliance in people around them.

00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:54.870
I noticed that some of these leaders didn't
have what you might consider to be viral or

00:08:54.870 --> 00:09:00.530
contagious intelligence. They were brilliant,
but no one else around them got to be so smart.

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:03.980
They had a way of dumbing down people around
them.

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:08.970
Yet other leaders amplified the intelligence
of others and I asked this question, "Why

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:15.950
are we geniuses around some but not around
others?"

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:20.190
As we looked at these two types of leaders,
Greg and I were determined to find out why.

00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:24.780
I was out coaching a number of executives
in Silicon Valley, and I saw this pattern

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:31.600
again and again and we wanted to know why.
Why do some leaders amplify intelligence and

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.290
others drain it?

00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:39.410
Over the course of two years we studied 150
leaders in 35 different companies all across

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:43.960
four continents trying to answer this question.

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:48.840
In pursuit of that, people told us their stories.
They told us about people they worked with

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:54.910
around whom they were smart, they did their
very best work. And they told us about people

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:59.210
that they had worked with where they shut
down and they became incapable.

00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:04.620
One of these stories that caught my attention
was told to me by one of my clients, now a

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:12.681
CEO of an Internet startup, but he told this
story about being 18 years old; I call this

00:10:12.681 --> 00:10:18.390
story a change in command. It started when
he was 18 years old living in Israel.

00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:20.200
And do 18 year olds in Israel do?

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:22.290
[pause]

00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:26.560
They go into the military. So Gabi like all
of his peers goes into the military, he goes

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:32.910
into a boot camp program and he is slated
to go in and learn to be a tank commander.

00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:37.410
So he's gonna through the tank commander training
program. He does six months of boot camp.

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:43.700
He and two of his fellow soldiers do such
a great job in boot camp that they're actually

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:48.290
tapped on the shoulder and assigned to go
out to real combat duty. So they're deployed

00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:52.830
up to the North, they've been training in
the Golan Heights, they're sent up to help

00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:58.970
patrol this kind of questionable border between
Israel and Lebanon, and they're gonna be out

00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:00.930
in real combat conditions.

00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:05.490
In these combat conditions with six months
of boot camp training Gabi does extraordinarily

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:11.420
well. He navigates well, he operates the tank
well, he works well with his fellow soldiers,

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:17.450
he works well with his commanding officers,
he handles the ambiguity and the complexity

00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:20.180
of the battlefield extraordinarily well.

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:25.870
Well after three months they go back to Israel,
and they rejoin the group that's just now

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:31.790
finished boot camp. They're now gonna enter
the tank commander training program and rejoin

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:35.620
their peer group. But at the time they do
that and they're sent down to the South of

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:39.180
Israel they experience a change in command.

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:44.770
Now Gabi will go, was going to be performing
and learning under a new commanding officer

00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:50.850
whose name was Uval. Now Uval had to leave
the Air Force for health reasons. He comes

00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:56.080
in, he's a quick study on tank operations,
he's now a new commanding officer, but he

00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:00.990
seems like he has something to prove. And
then specifically he's got something to prove

00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:01.990
to Gabi.

00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:02.990
[pause]

00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:09.310
Gabi does well in the classroom, but every
time he goes out into the field with Uval

00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:14.290
at the command he struggles. His team goes
out to perform navigational exercises, they

00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:17.930
have to find waypoints and return those way
points back. They start to struggle.

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:24.170
Uval points out all the mistakes, singles
out this group's performance, and they go

00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:29.260
from being good navigators to suddenly they're
now returning in the bottom 20 percent.

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:35.390
Gabi does great in the classroom, but every
time he gets in the tank with Uval supervising

00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:40.390
him, he starts to struggle. Struggle with
things he had no problem doing out in combat.

00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:45.070
Now it won't surprise you when you see how
these-these tanks are set up. So you've got

00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:50.500
right here, right there this is the tank commander.
So that's where Gabi sits. This is the very

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:55.110
unfortunate guy whose head is like a foot
out of the tank. There's a, there's a gunner

00:12:55.110 --> 00:13:02.130
and there's a navigator, and then seated right
here, right here there's a steel chair bolted

00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:07.160
to the top of the tank. That's where the training
officer sits with a clipboard on his thigh

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:11.740
to take notes and document all of the mistakes
that are made.

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:17.970
So this-this guy Uval is literally sitting
10 inches above his head. So for those of

00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:21.560
you who think you had a boss who kinda has
hovered over you --

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:22.560
[laughter]

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:25.820
this is nothing. So you can feel this guy
breathing down here.

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:33.180
Well Gabi starts to struggle. Every time he
goes out in the tank with Uval in the chair,

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:38.830
he can't operate. He starts to fail maneuvers,
he doesn't just fail one, he fails two and

00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:44.630
three, and quickly Gabi is failing every one
of his tank maneuvers.

00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:48.750
So Uval goes to the company commander whose
name is Lior and says, "We have a soldier

00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:52.790
that needs to be dismissed from the tank commander
training program."

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:57.170
Well this is a huge deal, this is the end
of his military career. It's not a great way

00:13:57.170 --> 00:14:04.240
for a young man to get off to-to start of
his career. But protocol necessitates that

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:09.860
before he can be dismissed from the program,
he needs to perform a single maneuver out

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:16.320
in the field with the company commander, this
young officer named Lior.

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:21.260
Well Gabi's friends are kind of wishing him
luck on this very ill-fated task 'cause they

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:25.690
know he's probably gonna fail at this maneuver
and be booted from the program.

00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:30.431
Well Lior takes him and before they get in
the tank Lior kinda walks him up to the tank

00:14:30.431 --> 00:14:36.500
and he stops at this model of the battlefield;
it's like a table top about yay high. And

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:41.280
he stops him and he says, "Gabi now what are
you gonna do when we get to this part of the

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:45.300
terrain?" And Gabi goes, "Well I think I kinda
know, I'll probably do this and I'll navigate

00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:49.260
here and there." "Now what about if the enemy
comes at you from this angle, what are you

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:54.240
gonna do? What about if the enemy is firing
from over here, what will you do?"

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:59.760
And so Gabi and Lior take a few minutes to
kind of prep. They get into the tank and not

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:06.730
only does Gabi perform that maneuver well
he performs the maneuver perfectly, which

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:12.120
incidentally was the toughest maneuver in
the entire test suite. A maneuver where all

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:17.540
conditions change, nothing can be predicted,
it's nothing but ambiguity and on the fly

00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:19.470
kinds of decisions.

00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:24.240
They get done, they come down from the tank,
Lior turns to him and he says, "Gabi you are

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:31.310
not dismissed." He stays in the program, graduates
in the top ten percent, goes on to officer

00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:37.390
training, graduates again in the ten percent,
and is asked to become a gnan, which is the

00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:43.420
Hebrew term for an officer that cultivates
the talent of other officers.

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:48.701
When Gabi told me this story and shared this
experience with me, it reminded me of something

00:15:48.701 --> 00:15:54.350
we all know to be true -- that it's often
within change of command comes a change in

00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:56.580
capability.

00:15:56.580 --> 00:16:03.300
We can be smart and capable and at our best
around some leaders, but yet other leaders

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:09.220
can cause us to doubt ourselves and to hold
back. And in Gabi's case be stupefied with

00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:10.220
fear.

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:12.820
[pause]

00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:19.740
Why is that? Why would some leaders amplify
intelligence while others drain it? What were

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:20.740
your predictions be?

00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:25.170
[pause]

00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:26.170
What would you predict?

00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:32.200
&gt;&gt;male in audience: If somebody has confidence
in you.

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:35.180
&gt;&gt;Liz Wiseman: If somebody has confidence
in you. What else? Another prediction.

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:36.180
Right here.

00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:39.720
&gt;&gt;female in audience: They point, they point
out the things you do well versus the mistakes

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:41.050
that you're making or are about to make.

00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:43.250
&gt;&gt;Liz Wiseman: They'd point out what you do
well. Another thought?

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:45.560
&gt;&gt;male in audience: They would encourage you
not dismiss you.

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:50.420
&gt;&gt;Liz Wiseman: Encouraging and not dismissive.
What else would you predict would be why some

00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:53.060
leaders amplify intelligence in others?

00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:54.060
In the back.

00:16:54.060 --> 00:17:01.174
&gt;&gt;male in audience: People who are self conscious
[unintelligible]other than thinking about

00:17:01.174 --> 00:17:02.174
yourself.

00:17:02.174 --> 00:17:04.670
&gt;&gt;Liz Wiseman: People who are self conscious
don't perform well so they take that extreme

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:07.220
orientation off of you. Okay.

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:12.890
Here's, we're gonna do a little exercise.
I want you to think about two different leaders

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:19.650
that you've worked for, one around, one who
was a diminisher to you, one who was a multiplier.

00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:25.189
You've got a piece of paper and there's a
number of pencil, pens and pencils down there.

00:17:25.189 --> 00:17:33.640
I want you to take two minutes and consider
a diminisher, what did they do? Just write

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:40.061
down one thing that they did that was characteristic
of their leadership approach. How did they

00:17:40.061 --> 00:17:42.980
manage?

00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:46.950
And we want you to write down something that
the multiplier did. Okay.

00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:51.990
Then a little tougher question, which was
really the backbone of our research: what

00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:57.630
percentage of your capability did each of
these leaders get? Okay.

00:17:57.630 --> 00:18:04.100
This is not how hard were you working. It's
with what you know, your capability, your

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:11.270
skills, what you had to offer, how much of
that did they really get from you? Okay. A

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:15.980
percentage, somewhere between 1 and 100, 100
is they got everything from you. Okay.

00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:20.140
I want you to take minute or two to do that
and we're gonna ask to hear from a few of

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:21.140
you.

00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:26.370
[pause]

00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:30.490
Okay. We wanna hear from a few of you. Who's
got one for me? I'll come find you.

00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:32.490
Right here, Yvonne.

00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:38.300
&gt;&gt;Yvonne: Okay. So the diminisher, what they
did was they took credit for my work and limited

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:42.840
my exposure. The percentage of the capability
was 70 percent.

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:47.030
The multiplier put me in stretch spots and
believed in me --

00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:48.590
&gt;&gt;Liz Wiseman: Okay.

00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:49.590
&gt;&gt;Yvonne: and got 110.

00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:55.220
&gt;&gt;Liz Wiseman: So the mul, diminisher took
credit, multiplier believed in you, 70 percent

00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:56.440
and a 110 percent.

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:59.890
Okay I'm gonna need some people who are gonna
help me with the math on this.

00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:03.940
Now we did, we're gonna do a little bit of
informal research. I need two people who are

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:05.300
fast on the calculator.

00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:07.540
[pause]

00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:11.610
Got their laptops up who can do this is like
a moment's notice. Okay I a couple-couple

00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:14.190
math people. I'd ask Greg to do it but he
claims to not be very good at math.

00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:19.210
[pause]

00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:24.910
Anyone? Anyone fast on the math?

00:19:24.910 --> 00:19:29.320
Because you are first to offer you can add
up the multiplier scores. And right here I'm

00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:34.510
gonna ask you add up the diminisher scores.
We have 70 and we have 110. Right over here.

00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:35.710
Okay.

00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:36.710
You're multiplier.

00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:41.380
&gt;&gt;male in audience: So my multiplier expressed
interest and encouragement, celebrated victories.

00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:42.380
&gt;&gt;Liz Wiseman: Okay.

00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:48.740
&gt;&gt;male in audience: And the diminisher doubted
my capabilities, dismissed accomplishments.

00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:53.100
&gt;&gt;Liz Wiseman: Okay diminisher doubted, multiplier
expressed -

00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:55.541
&gt;&gt;male in audience: Interest and encouragement.

00:19:55.541 --> 00:19:56.890
&gt;&gt;Liz Wiseman: interest and encouragement
and the numbers are diminisher?

00:19:56.890 --> 00:19:58.110
&gt;&gt;male in audience: Forty.

00:19:58.110 --> 00:20:01.040
&gt;&gt;Liz Wiseman: Got forty percent. And the
multiplier got?

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:02.611
&gt;&gt;male in audience: Ninety.

00:20:02.611 --> 00:20:04.800
&gt;&gt;Liz Wiseman: Ninety percent. Okay. Another
one from over here.

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:06.780
Right here.

00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:10.270
Start with your multiplier.

00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:13.420
&gt;&gt;male in audience: Multiplier believed in
me, trusted me, left me alone to do the work

00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:18.240
and the diminisher only, kind of like only
let, let their opinions be counted and put

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:21.610
myself, put the whole group down and didn't
listen to anybody.

00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:26.630
&gt;&gt;Liz Wiseman: Yeah. Did you hear that? The
multiplier trusted me and left me alone to

00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:32.960
do my work. It's one of the big things we
found. These people give others space. They

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:38.250
give 'em a ton of space. They give 'em hard
things and they leave them alone. Okay.

00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:39.250
Multiplier got?

00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:45.710
&gt;&gt;male in audience: I mean I said 120 percent
because it made me smarter, hundred doesn't

00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:47.810
make, and the diminisher 10 percent.

00:20:47.810 --> 00:20:50.630
&gt;&gt;Liz Wiseman: Okay, multiplier 120, diminisher
10. Okay.

00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:58.130
Who else has got numbers between one, zero
and 100 for me?

00:20:58.130 --> 00:21:01.420
Thank you. He's telling us an important story.
We're gonna get back to this.

00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:03.041
Who else? I need one or two more.

00:21:03.041 --> 00:21:04.080
[pause]

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:06.680
Over here, thank you.

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:07.750
Start with your multiplier.

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:15.120
&gt;&gt;male in audience: The multiplier explained
the needs and the diminisher, and the diminisher

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:16.530
assigned tasks.

00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:21.020
&gt;&gt;Liz Wiseman: Okay one explains the need,
they explain the why. It's a big part of what

00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:26.050
multipliers do is they explain the why behind
the work 'cause when people tell us why, we

00:21:26.050 --> 00:21:29.720
can be really smart. The diminisher assigned
the tasks.

00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:30.940
Give us your numbers, multiplier?

00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:33.090
&gt;&gt;male in audience: A hundred percent.

00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:34.090
&gt;&gt;Liz Wiseman: A hundred percent.

00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:35.180
Did you have 110 written down?

00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:36.180
&gt;&gt;male in audience: I did not.

00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:37.800
&gt;&gt;Liz Wiseman: You did not, okay. [laughs]

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:38.800
And the diminisher?

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:39.800
&gt;&gt;male in audience: Twenty five.

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:44.059
&gt;&gt;Liz Wiseman: Twenty five. Okay. Up here,
your multiplier and then diminisher.

00:21:44.059 --> 00:21:46.690
&gt;&gt;male in audience: The multiplier created
a lot of excitement about the project whereas

00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:52.670
the diminisher really seemed kind of bored
with the, my work and with what the group

00:21:52.670 --> 00:21:53.670
was doing.

00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:56.760
&gt;&gt;Liz Wiseman: Yeah. So excitement on the
multiplier, boredom on the diminisher.

00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:58.390
And your numbers are for the multiplier?

00:21:58.390 --> 00:21:59.390
&gt;&gt;male in audience: One hundred.

00:21:59.390 --> 00:22:00.390
&gt;&gt;Liz Wiseman: One hundred.

00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:01.390
&gt;&gt;male in audience: Sixty-six.

00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:02.540
&gt;&gt;Liz Wiseman: And sixty-six. Okay.

00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:07.340
I want just a few more shout outs on these
numbers. Let's take this group kind of right

00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:09.580
here. Give me your number on your multipliers.

00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:11.670
&gt;&gt;female in audience: Eighty-five.

00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:12.670
&gt;&gt;Liz Wiseman: Eighty-five.

00:22:12.670 --> 00:22:13.670
&gt;&gt;male in audience: A hundred.

00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:14.670
&gt;&gt;Liz Wiseman: A hundred.

00:22:14.670 --> 00:22:15.670
&gt;&gt;male in audience: Ninety.

00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:16.670
&gt;&gt;Liz Wiseman: Ninety. And?

00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:17.891
&gt;&gt;male in audience: Ninety.

00:22:17.891 --> 00:22:18.891
&gt;&gt;Liz Wiseman: Ninety.

00:22:18.891 --> 00:22:19.891
Okay, one more.

00:22:19.891 --> 00:22:20.891
&gt;&gt;male in audience: Also ninety.

00:22:20.891 --> 00:22:21.891
&gt;&gt;Liz Wiseman: Also ninety. Okay.

00:22:21.891 --> 00:22:24.271
How 'bout diminishers? Someone do some shout
outs of your diminishers.

00:22:24.271 --> 00:22:26.450
&gt;&gt;male in audience: [unintelligible]

00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:29.330
&gt;&gt;Liz Wiseman: Ten percent. Ten percent of
what he was able to give.

00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:30.591
&gt;&gt;male in audience: Forty.

00:22:30.591 --> 00:22:31.591
&gt;&gt;Liz Wiseman: Forty.

00:22:31.591 --> 00:22:32.591
&gt;&gt;female in audience: Seventy.

00:22:32.591 --> 00:22:33.591
&gt;&gt;Liz Wiseman: Seventy.

00:22:33.591 --> 00:22:34.591
&gt;&gt;male in audience: Eighty-five.

00:22:34.591 --> 00:22:35.591
&gt;&gt;Liz Wiseman: Eighty-five.

00:22:35.591 --> 00:22:36.591
&gt;&gt;female in audience: Fifty.

00:22:36.591 --> 00:22:37.591
&gt;&gt;Liz Wiseman: Fifty percent.

00:22:37.591 --> 00:22:38.591
[pause]

00:22:38.591 --> 00:22:40.170
&gt;&gt;male in audience: Ten.

00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:41.170
&gt;&gt;Liz Wiseman: Ten percent. Okay.

00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:43.210
How 'bout one more? A shout out. In the back.

00:22:43.210 --> 00:22:44.450
&gt;&gt;male in audience: Forty.

00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:45.860
&gt;&gt;Liz Wiseman: Forty percent. Okay.

00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:52.590
Now our math geniuses here are gonna be adding
that up as we look at this. We found very

00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:56.800
consistently these multipliers and diminishers
do different things. When you've got these

00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:59.970
numbers let us know. Let me know.

00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:00.970
Multiplier?

00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:01.970
&gt;&gt;male in audience: Do you want a sum?

00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:06.390
&gt;&gt;Liz Wiseman: I want an average. I did not
explain that well. I want an average.

00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:07.390
Okay.

00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:08.930
[pause]

00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:16.170
Here's what we found in our research and Greg
is gonna take you through the-the-the nuts

00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:22.850
and bolts of our finding. We found that these
multipliers really get more from people, and

00:23:22.850 --> 00:23:25.309
they do things differently.

00:23:25.309 --> 00:23:30.890
Diminishers tend to be geniuses; people who
find strength in their own intelligence. It's

00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:35.220
what they rely on, they rely on their own
intelligence to get their job done.

00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:41.080
Multipliers tend to be genius makers. They
themselves might be brilliant and capable,

00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:46.630
but they see their role as a leader as to
create and amplify intelligence around them.

00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:47.630
[pause]

00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:50.400
Do we have our numbers?

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:51.400
&gt;&gt;male in audience: Yes.

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:52.400
&gt;&gt;Liz Wiseman: Average for our diminishers?

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:53.400
&gt;&gt;male in audience: Forty-three.

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:57.309
&gt;&gt;Liz Wiseman: Forty-three percent. And do
we have an average for our multiplier?

00:23:57.309 --> 00:24:00.270
&gt;&gt;male in audience: Not yet.

00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:01.700
&gt;&gt;Liz Wiseman: Not yet. Okay.

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:03.590
Greg, Greg will query it from you.

00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:04.620
[pause]

00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:12.290
&gt;&gt;Greg McKeown: So what did we find? We found
that diminishers and multipliers actually

00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:20.120
do a lot of things the same, really similar.
But they do a few things really differently

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:23.170
that makes a really big difference.

00:24:23.170 --> 00:24:28.350
So what is the most important difference we
found? It was the assumptions that they held.

00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:34.890
So whereas diminishers seemed to have this
sense of scarcity around intelligence, that

00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:40.380
people will never be able to figure this out
without me. It's like one of the executives

00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:46.400
that confessed after a meeting this 4,000
engineers in his group he says, "There's just

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:51.220
one or two people that I find worth listening
to around here. What do you need from all

00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:54.750
the rest of them, these people they're just
not smart enough for me to really take them

00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:56.080
seriously."

00:24:56.080 --> 00:25:01.220
Contrast that with multipliers who have this
sense of abundance that it's not you're either

00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:08.520
smart or you're dumb, it's about in what way
are you smart. A sense of abundance in intelligence

00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:13.330
and capability, particularly this idea that
people are smart and they'll figure this out.

00:25:13.330 --> 00:25:17.040
Give them a chance, they'll work it out. Show
them what the problem is, they'll work it

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:21.360
out. Give them that space.

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:29.410
These assumptions lead to five particular
differences between diminishers and multipliers.

00:25:29.410 --> 00:25:36.340
First of all, diminishers tended to work as
empire builders so they were more interested

00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:41.870
in building their empires than they were in
building other people's careers. So as an

00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:47.250
example of this you could compare two Stanford
professors -- one who was so interested in

00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:52.670
his own thinking, his own research that he's
busy writing his blogs and writing his next

00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:57.930
paper and so on, that the people underneath
said, "I just never even get to see him. I

00:25:57.930 --> 00:26:02.550
mean he's brilliant, yes everyone knows that,
but I just get no-no time, no face time, no-no

00:26:02.550 --> 00:26:03.790
opportunity."

00:26:03.790 --> 00:26:10.950
Contrast this with the late Rajeev Motwani,
who of course was Sergey and Larry's advisor

00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:16.630
at Stanford. Sergey Brin wrote that, "When
his interest turned to data mining Rajeev,

00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:20.890
who had specialized in the field, helped to
coordinate a regular meeting group on the

00:26:20.890 --> 00:26:21.890
subject.

00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:25.870
Later when Larry and I began to work together
on the research that would lead to Google,

00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:31.330
Rajeev was there to support us, guide us through
challenges both technical and organizational.

00:26:31.330 --> 00:26:36.690
Eventually as Google emerged from Stanford,
Rajeev remained a friend and advisor, as he

00:26:36.690 --> 00:26:39.270
has with many people and start ups since."

00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:48.120
You just think of what happened because this
multiplier Motwani was not obsessed with his

00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:53.940
own knowledge and his own agenda, that he
could be aware of the knowledge and insight

00:26:53.940 --> 00:27:00.450
and interest and intelligence in his students.
And of course every one of us is impacted

00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:05.560
by his genius. He wasn't a genius, he was
a genius maker. He wasn't obsessed with his

00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:12.350
own intellectual empire but in really accelerating
the careers in the people around him.

00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:19.010
Secondly, we found that diminishers tended
to be tyrants, while multipliers tended to

00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:25.210
be liberators. It's just the difference between
creating a tense climate that stifles people

00:27:25.210 --> 00:27:29.480
and an intense climate that draws out people's
very best and boldest thinking.

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:35.929
Third, we found that diminishers tended to
be know-it-alls. I mean they just, just thought

00:27:35.929 --> 00:27:39.320
that what they knew was the most important
thing, they had to be the smartest person

00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:41.900
in the room versus multipliers who are challengers.

00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:48.440
We heard about that, these stretch assignments
that really push people beyond what they know

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:52.440
how to do. It's really just the difference
between thinking that your job is to have

00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:59.080
the right answer versus thinking that your
job is to have the right question. It's a

00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:00.990
big orientation difference.

00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:06.570
Fourth, diminishers tended to be decision
makers. The idea is they thought, "Well listen

00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:11.560
if I could just make the decision fast enough
then we'll quickly get on to being able to

00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:14.850
execute this, so I'll just make all the decisions
fast, fast, fast." They'll go and do it.

00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:20.110
They thought that they could skip the debate,
somehow we'll just miss that and then we'll

00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:23.640
just get on to execution. But what we learned
as we studied this is that you can't just

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:29.960
skip debate, you can't choose if debate happens,
you all know this is true. You go to a meeting

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:33.210
and nobody really talks about it and the real
meeting happens after the meeting has taken

00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:36.460
place. The debate happens.

00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:41.001
What multipliers learn is that you just have
to figure out when to do it, how to do it,

00:28:41.001 --> 00:28:46.799
so that it can actually help make a really
smart decision, drive a sound decision. And

00:28:46.799 --> 00:28:50.140
this is what we found. They were debate makers,
they would frame how those decisions were

00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:53.030
made and how the debate took place.

00:28:53.030 --> 00:28:59.429
And fifth, they were, the difference between
being a micromanager, think of one manager

00:28:59.429 --> 00:29:02.950
we studied who at two o'clock everyday would
walk around the cubicles just to see what

00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:07.240
was on someone's screen, "What are they doing?
I gotta be here, they won't get on with work

00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:09.160
if I'm not around hovering there."

00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:15.330
And another multiplier the, which at the time
John Chambers hired his first VP and he said,

00:29:15.330 --> 00:29:20.330
"Listen," he said, "this is how it's gonna
work from here on out. You're gonna be in

00:29:20.330 --> 00:29:25.591
charge of this. Everything in your area 51
percent, I'm in charge 49 percent. You come

00:29:25.591 --> 00:29:30.860
to me, I'll advise you, I want to have input,
but you own this." And so he had this sense

00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:35.370
of ownership that he was now really in charge,
and he shifted the burden of thinking from

00:29:35.370 --> 00:29:36.670
himself onto his team.

00:29:36.670 --> 00:29:42.301
And so of course what does this lead to? They
get a lot more capability and intelligence

00:29:42.301 --> 00:29:46.150
out of their people. Let's talk about how
much more. What did you get here?

00:29:46.150 --> 00:29:47.890
&gt;&gt;male in audience: Ninety-eight percent.

00:29:47.890 --> 00:29:48.890
&gt;&gt;Greg McKeown: Ninety-eight percent. What
did you say?

00:29:48.890 --> 00:29:50.230
&gt;&gt;male in audience: Forty-three percent.

00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:52.620
&gt;&gt;Greg McKeown: Forty-three to ninety-eight.
Doesn't take a math genius to work out the

00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:57.890
approximate ratio is? Two X.

00:29:57.890 --> 00:30:01.030
If you're a diminisher you tend to get about
50 percent of the intelligent, intelligence

00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:07.370
that's available as an average. As a multiplier
you get twice that capability, you get everything.

00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:12.070
And these 110 and 120s originally the idea
was, "Well this is kind of off the chart.

00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:16.230
This is just an outline, let's not use it."
But then after a time when we talked to people

00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:22.679
and really asked them they said, "No, I got
smarter." Intelligence could be grown, could

00:30:22.679 --> 00:30:23.679
be expanded.

00:30:23.679 --> 00:30:29.870
What are the implications of this to organizations?

00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:35.410
First, diminishers are expensive. I mean they
take twice the resources to get the same job

00:30:35.410 --> 00:30:42.790
done. Twice the resources at least to get
the same intellectual brain trust. For once

00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:49.240
the CFO and the HR executive agree. This is
a kind of leader that we want inside of organizations.

00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:54.010
And the second implication is the other side
of the same point which is that multipliers

00:30:54.010 --> 00:31:00.419
get so much more brain power from their people
that they essentially doubled the intellectual

00:31:00.419 --> 00:31:01.640
workforce for free.

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:05.720
[pause]

00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:14.799
A question was put by a-a-an article that
was published in United Arab Emirates recently,

00:31:14.799 --> 00:31:22.260
"What kind of leader are you?" What kind are
you? What kind am I? Diminisher, multiplier?

00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:27.310
And then the second question, "What kind of
leader do you aspire to be?"

00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:31.429
[pause]

00:31:31.429 --> 00:31:41.200
The activist and lead singer for U2, Bono,
said, "It has been said that after meeting

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:46.290
the great British Prime Minister William Ewart
Gladstone, you left feel-feeling that you

00:31:46.290 --> 00:31:51.220
had met the smartest person in the world,
but after meeting his rival Benjamin Disraeli,

00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:54.549
you left thinking you were the smartest person."

00:31:54.549 --> 00:32:00.320
This seems to us to be a very succinct synopsis
of the contrast between these two types of

00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:03.549
leaders and their approach.

00:32:03.549 --> 00:32:04.630
[pause]

00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:13.660
&gt;&gt;Liz Wiseman: So we ask you to reflect for
a just a few minutes on what kind of leader

00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:22.750
do you want to be? A genius or a genius maker?
One rooted in his or her own capabilities,

00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:29.350
the center of attention, and perhaps the limiting
force for the growth of your team or one who

00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:35.650
unleashes genius inside your or-organization?
Someone who leads an army of geniuses.

00:32:35.650 --> 00:32:36.650
[pause]

00:32:36.650 --> 00:32:42.970
In a recent Tweet this was I think from-from
was last week one of the-the people who got

00:32:42.970 --> 00:32:48.250
an early copy of the book, a blogger said,
"The person sitting at the apex of the intelligence

00:32:48.250 --> 00:32:55.130
hierarchy is the genius maker, not the genius."
That was his take away in these ideas. It's

00:32:55.130 --> 00:32:57.559
at the apex of the genius hierarchy.

00:32:57.559 --> 00:33:09.290
We'd like to kind of move to a thought around
how do you become a multiplier? Many of us

00:33:09.290 --> 00:33:13.809
are already there, but many of us probably
have some seeds of diminisher in our leadership

00:33:13.809 --> 00:33:16.040
based on how we kinda have grown up in our
career.

00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:19.309
Can you become a multiplier? And how do you
become one?

00:33:19.309 --> 00:33:25.130
I'd like to just start with Bill Campbell
as an example. I mentioned Bill Campbell,

00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:32.490
multiplier, CEO of Intuit, and now coach to
Steve Jobs, Eric Schmidt, Larry, Sergey, but

00:33:32.490 --> 00:33:36.990
he didn't start out this way. When we went
to interview Bill Campbell someone said, "Oh

00:33:36.990 --> 00:33:41.350
Liz you need to talk to Bill Campbell. He's
a massive multiplier."

00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:47.669
So I went down, Greg and I went down, we sat
with him in his office and he said, "Oh no.

00:33:47.669 --> 00:33:52.830
I'm not a multiplier. Well maybe now, but
I didn't start this way." He said, "Let me

00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:58.360
tell you how I started my career. I began
my career as a diminisher. I came outta Columbia,

00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:02.740
I was the head football coach, I was all about
telling people what to do. I was calling all

00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:03.740
the plays.

00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:08.569
I went to work for Kodak as a marketing manager.
I bossed everyone around. I told people what

00:34:08.569 --> 00:34:13.429
to do. When the sales people didn't have their
sales plans right, I just rewrote 'em for

00:34:13.429 --> 00:34:14.429
'em."

00:34:14.429 --> 00:34:20.000
He then went to Apple, worked under John Sculley,
was taught that his job was to be a micromanager,

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:25.829
to know every detail, and to check on every
detail in the people around him.

00:34:25.829 --> 00:34:31.210
He started to grow out of this, he started
Claris, he was doing a good job, but then

00:34:31.210 --> 00:34:37.819
one day someone came to him and they said,
"Bill, you're back to your old ways. You're

00:34:37.819 --> 00:34:43.559
telling everyone what to do, you're bossing
us around. We can't do our work." This was

00:34:43.559 --> 00:34:49.619
Donna Dubinsky who went on to then head Palm
and she said, "Bill, we need some space. We

00:34:49.619 --> 00:34:55.169
came here because we believe in you, but you're
telling everyone to do, like the leash. [laughs]

00:34:55.169 --> 00:34:59.009
It's like a choke hold on the leash. We need
more space."

00:34:59.009 --> 00:35:04.329
And this little near mutiny was a wakeup call
for Bill and he said, "I realize that now

00:35:04.329 --> 00:35:07.440
in your terms I was a diminisher."

00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:13.749
He learned to really see and utilize the pep-the
intelligence in people around him. He went

00:35:13.749 --> 00:35:21.130
on to be CEO of Inuit. And then not only is
he a multiplier today, he's what we call a

00:35:21.130 --> 00:35:26.520
"multiplier of multipliers." He's been the
one to help Jeffery Bezos figure out how to

00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:32.979
scale Amazon. Marc Andreessen, Ben Horowitz,
the team here at Google and at Apple; he is

00:35:32.979 --> 00:35:39.680
the one that helps these technologists figure
out how to lead in a way that harnesses all

00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:45.319
the intelligence available to them in their
organization.

00:35:45.319 --> 00:35:52.809
Now one can pursue the path of Bill Campbell
and take 20, 25, maybe 30 years to make this

00:35:52.809 --> 00:35:57.789
journey. We asked the question, "Can this
be accelerated?"

00:35:57.789 --> 00:36:04.150
Now Greg and I admit that in our study, in
our research of 150 leaders we studied the

00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:09.731
extremes. We studied the extreme diminisher,
the extreme multiplier. The kind of people

00:36:09.731 --> 00:36:17.210
you thought about when we asked you to identify
two leaders. But in reality there's a bell

00:36:17.210 --> 00:36:23.240
curve between this and most of us don't sit
at these polar extremes. There's a few people

00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:27.550
here, we love 'em, we study them, we wrote
about them. We wrote about a lot of these

00:36:27.550 --> 00:36:31.940
folks too. We took their names out of the
book [laughs] kinda the witness protection

00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:32.940
program.

00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:40.190
But most of us sit right here in the middle
and the most interesting group from our perspective

00:36:40.190 --> 00:36:46.430
is not the raging diminisher, it's the accidental
diminisher. It's the-the good leader, the

00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:52.839
good manager who wants to do a good job, but
is following popular management practice,

00:36:52.839 --> 00:36:58.570
following what they see, and they might accidentally
be diminishing people around them.

00:36:58.570 --> 00:37:05.849
What are some ways that you might accidentally
be diminishing people around you?

00:37:05.849 --> 00:37:08.569
[pause]

00:37:08.569 --> 00:37:09.569
Something you might do?

00:37:09.569 --> 00:37:16.739
How 'bout visionaries. Big thinkers, do we
have any big thinkers in here? Sometimes people

00:37:16.739 --> 00:37:21.470
can be such big thinkers that they don't leave
space for anyone else.

00:37:21.470 --> 00:37:23.410
Is there anyone here who has the gift of gab?

00:37:23.410 --> 00:37:26.500
[pause]

00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:31.609
Sometimes our enthusiasm, how 'bout idea people?
People who are like ideas just come to you

00:37:31.609 --> 00:37:37.380
like this? When you come into work every day
with a new idea what does it do to people

00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:38.380
around you?

00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:40.670
[pause]

00:37:40.670 --> 00:37:47.479
Have you ever had a boss who came into work
every day with, "Oh, let's try this. Let's

00:37:47.479 --> 00:37:53.220
consider this. What about this?" What does
that boss think he or she is doing by spouting

00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:58.170
out these ideas? What's their intention?

00:37:58.170 --> 00:38:02.710
They're inspiring people 'cause we've talked
to these people. "I'm inspiring people. I'm

00:38:02.710 --> 00:38:06.920
stimulating innovation." What are they really
doing to their organization?

00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:09.249
&gt;&gt;male in audience: [unintelligible]daily
basis.

00:38:09.249 --> 00:38:14.299
&gt;&gt;Liz Wiseman: They're changing direction
on a daily basis and you run and follow them,

00:38:14.299 --> 00:38:18.950
and then there's a new idea and then you run
this way, and then you go this way, and you

00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:24.839
spend all of your mental energy chasing these
people around in circles. What else do they

00:38:24.839 --> 00:38:25.839
do?

00:38:25.839 --> 00:38:27.319
&gt;&gt;voice in audience: [unintelligible]

00:38:27.319 --> 00:38:35.019
&gt;&gt;Liz Wiseman: Okay. How about answer guys?
Who are people who are just quick with an

00:38:35.019 --> 00:38:38.681
answer? Can solve a problem fast in their
head and pretty quick with that answer?

00:38:38.681 --> 00:38:39.780
[pause]

00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:47.119
Okay. I'm kinda one. I admit it. A little
bit of an answer guy. When you're quick with

00:38:47.119 --> 00:38:50.690
an answer what does it do to the people around
you?

00:38:50.690 --> 00:38:54.770
&gt;&gt;male in audience: It keeps them from responding.

00:38:54.770 --> 00:38:56.140
&gt;&gt;Liz Wiseman: It keeps them responding?

00:38:56.140 --> 00:38:57.589
&gt;&gt;male in audience: From responding.

00:38:57.589 --> 00:38:58.589
&gt;&gt;Liz Wiseman: It keeps them from responding,
right.

00:38:58.589 --> 00:39:01.900
If I work with someone who's fast with an
answer what do I do when there's a question?

00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:03.900
&gt;&gt;female in audience: You go to them [unintelligible]

00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:08.140
&gt;&gt;Liz Wiseman: I let them answer it. I've
think, "You know what?" And I've done this,

00:39:08.140 --> 00:39:12.979
and the years I spent at Oracle was very much
like I'm-I'm sure many of you feel here. I

00:39:12.979 --> 00:39:21.829
work with geniuses. And sometimes we defer,
we defer to people who are fast with an answer.

00:39:21.829 --> 00:39:25.619
As Greg said these ideas are kind of getting
out there. We're interested to hear what people

00:39:25.619 --> 00:39:27.380
around the world are saying about them.

00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:33.680
This is from a-a paper in-in Nairobi saying,
"What are, these, yes we understand there

00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:37.569
are multipliers and diminishers, but how do
you become a multiplier? Are there some simple

00:39:37.569 --> 00:39:39.269
ways to do that?"

00:39:39.269 --> 00:39:46.589
And what Greg and I would like to do is leave
you with one very simple idea. And that is

00:39:46.589 --> 00:39:52.859
to move from answers to questions. Now most
of us here, particularly technologists, their

00:39:52.859 --> 00:39:59.249
value early in their career coming out of
school, early in the career of a technologist

00:39:59.249 --> 00:40:03.349
is to have the answers. It's what people were
hired for.

00:40:03.349 --> 00:40:09.380
But the value of having those answers diminishes
over time. Some leaders never figure this

00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:15.739
out. They don't figure out that their role
as a leader is less about having answers,

00:40:15.739 --> 00:40:20.911
particularly as they lead large organizations
where they can't know everything. But they

00:40:20.911 --> 00:40:26.219
need to add a layer, a growing layer of having
the right questions.

00:40:26.219 --> 00:40:32.460
And truly as we've studied executives -- the
best executives have the right questions not

00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:33.930
the right answers.

00:40:33.930 --> 00:40:40.729
So if you're looking for a simple starting
point to leading more like a multiplier, it's

00:40:40.729 --> 00:40:48.259
learn to think in questions. Use your intellect
and your smarts to formulate hard questions

00:40:48.259 --> 00:40:54.460
that cause other people to stop and to think
and then to respond. Shift the burden of thinking

00:40:54.460 --> 00:41:01.420
from you as the leader to find the answers
and shift that burden out into your organization,

00:41:01.420 --> 00:41:03.950
so your organization has permission to think.

00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:10.219
Kind of a final thought we would leave you
with: how many people here saw the documentary

00:41:10.219 --> 00:41:13.710
Man On Wire? Yeah. Couple of people here.

00:41:13.710 --> 00:41:23.420
It chronicles Frenchman Philippe Petit, his
outrageous act of illegally stringing a cable

00:41:23.420 --> 00:41:29.729
across the then standing World Trade towers
back in 1974; stringing this cable across

00:41:29.729 --> 00:41:40.469
140 foot expanse between the towers, 100,
no 1,400 feet up in the air, no nets, no harnesses,

00:41:40.469 --> 00:41:44.219
just a tightrope artist and his pole.

00:41:44.219 --> 00:41:52.009
Now the image that most people remember is
this image; the man out on the wire by himself

00:41:52.009 --> 00:41:57.329
with no support up in the air. And what did
he do once he got out on that wire? Did he

00:41:57.329 --> 00:42:00.620
just kinda scurry across and declare victory?
What did he do?

00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:01.989
&gt;&gt;voice in audience: [unintelligible] dance.

00:42:01.989 --> 00:42:08.020
&gt;&gt;Liz Wiseman: He danced. He like kinda rolled
around on the wire; he laid down. He played,

00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:12.599
he was out there for like a half an hour,
he was playing and having fun because once

00:42:12.599 --> 00:42:17.249
he got out on that wire he knew what to do.
Okay.

00:42:17.249 --> 00:42:23.230
Now that's what most people remember. But
I saw him on Colbert actually, and this is

00:42:23.230 --> 00:42:28.670
what I remember. This is the image that stands
out in my mind. This is the image of him taking

00:42:28.670 --> 00:42:31.219
a single step.

00:42:31.219 --> 00:42:37.369
And I was so struck by what he said, he, I
think it was Colbert that said, "Wh-what caused

00:42:37.369 --> 00:42:40.519
you to do this thing? What caused you to go
out on the wire?" He goes, "You know being

00:42:40.519 --> 00:42:46.849
out on the wire wasn't hard." He said, "What
was hard was the moment of truth when I stood

00:42:46.849 --> 00:42:54.059
there on the building on the edge of the building
with one foot anchored safely to the building

00:42:54.059 --> 00:42:56.830
and the other foot out on the wire."

00:42:56.830 --> 00:43:04.219
He said, "I had to make a decision: do I shift
my weight from the foot that's anchored to

00:43:04.219 --> 00:43:11.040
the building and do I shift my weight out
on that wire?" He said, "Something I could

00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:17.279
not resist called me out on that wire, and
I shifted my weight."

00:43:17.279 --> 00:43:23.859
So perhaps at the conclusion of our remarks
you think, "You know I'm pretty comfortable

00:43:23.859 --> 00:43:30.200
in how I lead." You might be comfortably standing
on that building, but perhaps you're intrigued

00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:36.079
with this idea that you can be a multiplier
and that you might be able to get more from

00:43:36.079 --> 00:43:41.099
other people and create for them an exhilarating
experience. And perhaps you've got that one

00:43:41.099 --> 00:43:43.150
foot out on the wire.

00:43:43.150 --> 00:43:53.640
Imagine what you could do if you had double
the brain power inside your organization.

00:43:53.640 --> 00:44:02.619
What hard problems could you solve? What opportunities
could be met? What would be possible? What

00:44:02.619 --> 00:44:11.369
could a team of smart, talented people do
if they were operating at 100 percent brainpower?

00:44:11.369 --> 00:44:17.619
So as you think of that, we simply ask you
the question: will you shift your weight and

00:44:17.619 --> 00:44:19.719
lead more like a multiplier?

00:44:19.719 --> 00:44:22.641
Thank you for having Greg and me here at Google.
Thank you.

00:44:22.641 --> 00:44:27.500
[applause]

00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:32.039
Are there any questions? I know people probably
have to go to meetings, but we are very happy

00:44:32.039 --> 00:44:34.210
to hear comments, questions --

00:44:34.210 --> 00:44:35.369
[pause]

00:44:35.369 --> 00:44:38.160
I'll bring the microphone to you if you would
like.

00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:45.021
&gt;&gt;male in audience: I'd like to hear what
you guys think about Steve Jobs. Is he a diminisher

00:44:45.021 --> 00:44:46.021
or a multiplier?

00:44:46.021 --> 00:44:49.890
&gt;&gt;Liz Wiseman: You know Greg I was gonna hand
the mic to you on the first question, do want

00:44:49.890 --> 00:44:50.950
me to take it or do you want it?

00:44:50.950 --> 00:44:52.609
&gt;&gt;Greg McKeown: Go ahead.

00:44:52.609 --> 00:44:53.859
&gt;&gt;Liz Wiseman: [laughs]

00:44:53.859 --> 00:44:54.859
[laughter]

00:44:54.859 --> 00:44:59.400
We get this question just about everywhere
we go, Steve Jobs. If someone were just looking

00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:04.630
at what is publicly reported and the sort
of persona of Steve Jobs, you might conclude

00:45:04.630 --> 00:45:06.891
that Steve has some characteristics of a diminisher.

00:45:06.891 --> 00:45:14.519
But when you talk to people who work for him,
you will probably conclude that Steve is brilliantly

00:45:14.519 --> 00:45:20.609
a multiplier in a small circle inside of Apple
and with a certain set of people.

00:45:20.609 --> 00:45:26.890
And what Steve has figured out is he has,
he's absolutely a multiplier to those people.

00:45:26.890 --> 00:45:32.450
I've talked to a number of 'em who work for
him that say, "I do my best work around Steve."

00:45:32.450 --> 00:45:37.329
I don't think he's figured out how to do this
broadly across his organization to be frank,

00:45:37.329 --> 00:45:43.059
but what he's done is he has brilliantly hired
Tim Cook who's the COO, and he was the interim

00:45:43.059 --> 00:45:49.819
CEO when Steve was out ill. And Tim is absolutely
a multiplier who thinks scale.

00:45:49.819 --> 00:45:53.289
So I think Steve balances himself well. That's
my opinion on it.

00:45:53.289 --> 00:45:54.289
Other questions?

00:45:54.289 --> 00:45:55.289
[pause]

00:45:55.289 --> 00:45:59.069
Go right to the jugular with the Steve Jobs
question.

00:45:59.069 --> 00:46:00.069
[laughter]

00:46:00.069 --> 00:46:01.069
I like that one.

00:46:01.069 --> 00:46:02.229
[pause]

00:46:02.229 --> 00:46:04.960
Or just thoughts, yeah.

00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:09.829
&gt;&gt;male in audience: So you're categorizing
like multipliers and diminishers, what about

00:46:09.829 --> 00:46:14.640
the people who are in the middle like you
were talkin' about, like who are diminishers

00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:20.160
in one factor and multipliers in a different
situation? How do you characterize, like when

00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:25.202
do you find out what-what situation you are
multiplier and diminisher in?

00:46:25.202 --> 00:46:28.559
&gt;&gt;Greg McKeown: Yeah, so I think the question
is how do you assess where you are on this

00:46:28.559 --> 00:46:34.069
continuum? We-we have three different assessments
you can do. There's one that's actually free

00:46:34.069 --> 00:46:42.759
online, it's called multipliersquiz.com, multipliersquiz.com.
It's ten questions. It'll be focused directly

00:46:42.759 --> 00:46:48.260
at this question, which we think is a really
great question because most of us fall in

00:46:48.260 --> 00:46:49.569
between somewhere.

00:46:49.569 --> 00:46:54.460
So you can't just say, "Well, hey listen I'm
not one of these tyrants so therefore it doesn't

00:46:54.460 --> 00:46:59.220
apply." Most of us are in the middle. We mean
to access everything, but we accidentally

00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:02.680
don't. So this is where I would begin. That'd
be my suggestion, multipliersquiz.com. There

00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:07.920
are more advanced assessments for people that
are interested in going a bit further than

00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:08.920
that.

00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:09.920
Thank you.

00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:10.920
What other questions do you have?

00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:11.920
[pause]

00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:18.640
&gt;&gt;male in audience: I know that this isn't
exactly the direct focus of what your book

00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:25.242
is, but you-you noted that a lot of times
leaders remember in the past that they had

00:47:25.242 --> 00:47:31.509
to provide all the answers, and then they
don't really have that much, I mean they have

00:47:31.509 --> 00:47:36.219
a lot of difficulty transitioning over to
the questions? So then what happens, or I

00:47:36.219 --> 00:47:41.009
don't know if you guys know what happens to
the people who start out with all the questions

00:47:41.009 --> 00:47:44.960
and then move, and then try to move up. Like
how-how do they go ahead with that?

00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:49.589
Has you, have you had like any experiences
of leaders who have been multipliers from

00:47:49.589 --> 00:47:50.589
the start?

00:47:50.589 --> 00:47:54.829
&gt;&gt;Liz Wiseman: From the start? [unintelligible]

00:47:54.829 --> 00:47:55.829
[pause]

00:47:55.829 --> 00:48:01.950
&gt;&gt;Greg McKeown: So I think you're question
is about somebody that makes the other transition,

00:48:01.950 --> 00:48:04.459
goes from multiplier to --

00:48:04.459 --> 00:48:06.240
&gt;&gt;male in audience: No if they start out a
multiplier what would they do?

00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:09.380
&gt;&gt;Liz Wiseman: Yeah, I think the question
is what about leaders who start asking those

00:48:09.380 --> 00:48:14.720
questions early on. And now that you've asked
that it does make me think of-of people who

00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:20.519
start out, they may start out in large corporations,
but I think these are people who come into

00:48:20.519 --> 00:48:25.329
their work with an entrepreneurial mindset
and I think if you actually, I can't claim

00:48:25.329 --> 00:48:31.260
to have studied this, but if you study great
entrepreneurs they very early in their career

00:48:31.260 --> 00:48:36.060
start asking hard questions. They may have
brilliant technical know-how, but they couple

00:48:36.060 --> 00:48:42.890
it with asking about what's possible. And
I think if you study a lot of the large companies

00:48:42.890 --> 00:48:46.569
here and the most innovative companies in
the Valley, you'll see that these are people

00:48:46.569 --> 00:48:51.829
who early, early in their career questioned
assumptions, asked what was possible, and

00:48:51.829 --> 00:48:57.519
really challenged the status quo. And I think
they think in terms of questions. But they

00:48:57.519 --> 00:49:02.249
add that on top of like deep technical know-how.

00:49:02.249 --> 00:49:03.249
Okay, we'll go here and then over --

00:49:03.249 --> 00:49:08.599
&gt;&gt;male in audience: So I started to think
your talk about multipliers in particular,

00:49:08.599 --> 00:49:13.670
I was reminded of what I read in the book
Built to Last by Jerry Porras and others.

00:49:13.670 --> 00:49:19.789
And one of the important characteristics they
had there was it was I'll paraphrase it as

00:49:19.789 --> 00:49:21.450
lack of ego.

00:49:21.450 --> 00:49:25.359
I mean they were thinking about the organization
building it. Although they were not tough

00:49:25.359 --> 00:49:31.089
but they didn't have that ego gratification,
that drive to promote themselves. Is that

00:49:31.089 --> 00:49:34.520
kind of a crucial characteristic, that's kind
of why I think the question about Steve Jobs

00:49:34.520 --> 00:49:38.050
came up because one doesn't associate less
ego with Steve Jobs.

00:49:38.050 --> 00:49:39.050
[pause]

00:49:39.050 --> 00:49:43.829
&gt;&gt;Greg McKeown: Yeah, I mean this question
when-when we were studying this phenomenon

00:49:43.829 --> 00:49:49.539
we were looking for something very complex
in a way that would distinguish the two groups

00:49:49.539 --> 00:49:50.539
of people.

00:49:50.539 --> 00:49:55.309
But in the end we started finding ourselves
increasingly saying, "No part of the difference

00:49:55.309 --> 00:50:00.660
may be a core difference is that they just
don't center on themselves." So they just

00:50:00.660 --> 00:50:05.140
aren't so obsessed with having to prove that
they're the smartest person; that they just

00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:07.190
are able to see other people around them.

00:50:07.190 --> 00:50:11.709
So instead of having to get their own career
moving they just go, "Oh, I'm okay, I'm smart,

00:50:11.709 --> 00:50:15.890
I'm gonna figure this stuff out. I'll be promoted.
No worries about that. Let me just focus on

00:50:15.890 --> 00:50:19.190
other people," did seem to be one of the critical
differences.

00:50:19.190 --> 00:50:20.190
[pause]

00:50:20.190 --> 00:50:24.981
&gt;&gt;Liz Wiseman: Let me add to what Greg said.
One of the concerns that we had is that people

00:50:24.981 --> 00:50:29.660
might read this book or there's a, there's
a Harvard Business Review article, we brought

00:50:29.660 --> 00:50:35.680
a few copies for anyone who wants that, that
they might take these ideas at a cursory level

00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:41.069
and they might come to the conclusion that
says, "For me to be a multiplier I can't be

00:50:41.069 --> 00:50:46.119
the smart one. I have to kind of recede into
the background. I have to be the guy with

00:50:46.119 --> 00:50:50.029
the questions." And it's absolutely not the
case.

00:50:50.029 --> 00:50:56.180
What multipliers do is they use all of their
own intelligence too. They know that their

00:50:56.180 --> 00:51:02.200
brain power is important so they in some ways
 -- you could look at it as a lack of ego

00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:06.539
or you could look at the flip side of that
coin which is they have utter confidence in

00:51:06.539 --> 00:51:11.709
their own capability and their own intelligence.
They use it, they use it to frame questions

00:51:11.709 --> 00:51:16.809
and to frame challenges and know the hard
things to ask and to know what's technically

00:51:16.809 --> 00:51:21.709
possible and impossible. So they're using
all of their brainpower but they have enough

00:51:21.709 --> 00:51:27.650
confidence that they don't limit the group
to that. They use their brainpower in full

00:51:27.650 --> 00:51:29.690
to spark intelligence in people around them.

00:51:29.690 --> 00:51:35.979
Any other questions or comments? And a comment
is as great as a question.

00:51:35.979 --> 00:51:40.109
&gt;&gt;male in audience: In thinking about this
idea of the multipliers of multipliers, it

00:51:40.109 --> 00:51:45.450
seems like you would wind up with clusters
of multipliers and in a, in a sense I think

00:51:45.450 --> 00:51:50.069
I wouldn't if I was working for a diminisher
I would become a diminisher myself. So do

00:51:50.069 --> 00:51:58.209
you find these kinds of clusters of orgs that
are multiplier culture-wise and diminisher

00:51:58.209 --> 00:51:59.209
culture-wise?

00:51:59.209 --> 00:52:03.660
&gt;&gt;Liz Wiseman: Yeah the question is do we
find that these multipliers cluster together?

00:52:03.660 --> 00:52:09.809
We certainly find that people flock to work
for multipliers. And-and I absolutely believe

00:52:09.809 --> 00:52:14.979
I think most people who study leadership would
say that it does trickle down that people

00:52:14.979 --> 00:52:16.849
emulate what they see.

00:52:16.849 --> 00:52:24.700
We know for a, this is what we know for a
fact is that a lot of well intended leaders

00:52:24.700 --> 00:52:29.329
have the heart of a multiplier and even maybe
like the mind and the heart of a multiplier,

00:52:29.329 --> 00:52:33.660
but they've worked for a diminisher for so
long or they've worked in a diminishing culture

00:52:33.660 --> 00:52:39.190
for so long that they've lost their way and
they become what Greg and I call "this accidental

00:52:39.190 --> 00:52:40.190
diminisher."

00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:46.410
So we know that diminisher leadership breeds
diminishers. But it breeds accidental diminishers

00:52:46.410 --> 00:52:48.670
not the raging kind.

00:52:48.670 --> 00:52:53.270
We haven't yet studied like do multipliers
sort of like breed other multipliers. We know

00:52:53.270 --> 00:52:54.799
people flock to them.

00:52:54.799 --> 00:52:56.009
Greg any other thoughts on that?

00:52:56.009 --> 00:52:57.339
If not, there's another question.

00:52:57.339 --> 00:52:58.369
[pause]

00:52:58.369 --> 00:53:05.029
&gt;&gt;male in audience: I have what might be a
related question. You mentioned a bell curve,

00:53:05.029 --> 00:53:09.289
did your research show a bell curve or is
that an assumption? Because I, sometimes I

00:53:09.289 --> 00:53:11.160
think it might be worse than that.

00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:12.160
[laughter]

00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:13.160
[pause]

00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:18.650
&gt;&gt;Greg McKeown: Yeah, we-we didn't study it
in terms of a bell curve. It is an assumption.

00:53:18.650 --> 00:53:23.269
We don't know where the-the-the gravity pull
really lies on this. It's an interesting question

00:53:23.269 --> 00:53:27.119
though. We imagined there'd be further research
that could be done.

00:53:27.119 --> 00:53:28.119
Thank you.

00:53:28.119 --> 00:53:31.729
&gt;&gt;Liz Wiseman: We certainly know it's a spectrum
and we assume its bell curve like, but it's

00:53:31.729 --> 00:53:32.729
an assumption.

00:53:32.729 --> 00:53:34.289
&gt;&gt;Greg McKeown: Any final questions here?

00:53:34.289 --> 00:53:35.289
[pause]

00:53:35.289 --> 00:53:36.770
Thank you.

00:53:36.770 --> 00:53:43.650
&gt;&gt;male in audience: We don't always get to
be leaders. In every group there's usually

00:53:43.650 --> 00:53:49.789
one at least a minority of the group would
be leaders and most of them would be following

00:53:49.789 --> 00:53:56.839
a leader, and every question asked would eventually
have to be answered by someone, but you seem

00:53:56.839 --> 00:54:02.980
to be saying, "Okay we should think in questions
and not in answers then."

00:54:02.980 --> 00:54:12.029
I mean, I-I-I see, I see something not coming
together here like eventually who is to answer

00:54:12.029 --> 00:54:19.980
the questions and are we, are we not valuing
those who are answering the questions enough?

00:54:19.980 --> 00:54:21.049
[pause]

00:54:21.049 --> 00:54:28.700
&gt;&gt;Liz Wiseman: So the question is, is if we
breed multipliers, do we end up with a lot

00:54:28.700 --> 00:54:34.760
of people who ask questions but no one that
answers them? And I don't think so because

00:54:34.760 --> 00:54:40.299
multipliers they're asking that question wanting
an answer, and they're gonna ask it in a way

00:54:40.299 --> 00:54:46.499
that people, people are, it's a natural gravitational
pull to wanna be knowledgeable and to wanna

00:54:46.499 --> 00:54:52.920
be smart and I think you might be surprised
that you can actually serve as a multiplier

00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:58.789
as a direct boss, you can do it as a peer,
you can do as a so-called subordinate. You

00:54:58.789 --> 00:55:04.619
can be a multiplier to your boss. And I think
you'll find that if you ask those questions

00:55:04.619 --> 00:55:07.769
people will step in to answer them.

00:55:07.769 --> 00:55:13.109
I think one of the things we found is that
these multipliers create this space, and it's

00:55:13.109 --> 00:55:17.170
almost this uncomfortable space. They ask
hard questions, they give big challenges,

00:55:17.170 --> 00:55:25.549
and they create this vacuum that people have
to close. People have to find answers to these

00:55:25.549 --> 00:55:27.630
questions.

00:55:27.630 --> 00:55:28.640
Any other final comments?

00:55:28.640 --> 00:55:29.640
Yes.

00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:30.640
[pause]

00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:36.559
&gt;&gt;male in audience: Can everyone become a
multiplier or is aren't there people who cannot

00:55:36.559 --> 00:55:41.059
be multipliers just like the great question
can everyone, anyone become a leader?

00:55:41.059 --> 00:55:42.059
[pause]

00:55:42.059 --> 00:55:47.660
&gt;&gt;Greg McKeown: Yeah, the question is, is,
can everyone really make this transition?

00:55:47.660 --> 00:55:52.869
And our position on this is that there may
be a few people who are so entrenched and

00:55:52.869 --> 00:55:57.619
rewarded for their diminisher approaches or
are so blind to their diminisher approaches

00:55:57.619 --> 00:56:01.680
that they just are really not ever likely
to make that transition, but we think it's

00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:03.400
very few and far between.

00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:07.860
So there was a, one of the people that we've
worked with who was known as an arch diminisher.

00:56:07.860 --> 00:56:13.829
His organization after he went through sort
of a six month, twelve month process of really

00:56:13.829 --> 00:56:17.979
understanding what was going on, he moved
to a different company and there with those

00:56:17.979 --> 00:56:23.269
new assumptions and approaches was known as
a multiplier. So it was a shift that really

00:56:23.269 --> 00:56:25.250
did happen for this individual.

00:56:25.250 --> 00:56:29.359
So we believe anecdotally that there may be
a few people that can't, but they're few and

00:56:29.359 --> 00:56:30.359
far between.

00:56:30.359 --> 00:56:31.359
Thank you.

00:56:31.359 --> 00:56:36.150
&gt;&gt;Liz Wiseman: It really is. Multiplier leadership
is something that can be learned, you can

00:56:36.150 --> 00:56:40.459
do it from all angles whether you're in a
formal management job and, or whether you

00:56:40.459 --> 00:56:45.789
the most junior person on the team. So everyone
can lead like a multiplier. We encourage you

00:56:45.789 --> 00:56:51.749
to think about ways that you might do more.
We've got resources here to support you.

00:56:51.749 --> 00:56:55.750
Greg and I would like to thank you for having
us here. It's wonderful to be down here. We

00:56:55.750 --> 00:57:00.370
love coming to the campus. I love everything
about it except the Aloe water, so thank you

00:57:00.370 --> 00:57:01.450
very much for having us.

00:57:01.450 --> 00:57:02.279
[applause]
