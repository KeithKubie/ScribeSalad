00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.900
Where we left off in the last
video, Napoleon was doing

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:03.860
pretty well.

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:09.410
In 1804, just as a bit of
review, he declared himself

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.750
Emperor Napoleon I.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.810
And then, the whole last video
was about the Third Coalition

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:19.160
that formed in 1805.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.030
And we saw that at the end of
1805, after the Battle of

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:31.880
Austerlitz, Napoleon was able to
crush the Third Coalition,

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.880
which was mainly made up
of Russia and Austria.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:35.580
And this is all review.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:36.920
We saw this in the last video.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.660
And the big by-product of that,
other than the fact that

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.800
it just made everyone think gee,
this Napoleon guy, he's

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.880
pretty formidable, is that it
ended the Holy Roman Empire.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.860
Which you remember was
neither holy, nor

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.290
Roman, nor an empire.

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.360
It was really just
a collection of

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.880
German speaking states.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:04.050
But it ended the official
Holy Roman Empire.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.360
And Napoleon felt so good about
himself at this point,

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.890
especially after crushing the
Austrian and Russian forces at

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.330
Austerlitz, that he had the Arc
de Triomphe, which if you

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.950
go to Paris right now,
it's one of the

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.230
things you should see.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:26.490
He had this built.

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.240
And now it's to commemorate all
of the soldiers who have

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.040
died for France.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.720
But it was originally built
by Napoleon, or it was

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.640
commissioned by Napoleon, to
celebrate his victory at

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.210
Austerlitz.

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.030
So this is the Arc
de Triomphe.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.750
My spelling is always
a little weak.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.280
But it's especially weak
when I'm spelling

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.530
something in French.

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.210
And that's right there.

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.630
So Napoleon was doing
pretty well.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.010
Now, on the other side of the
equation, you could imagine

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.130
that the other major powers of
Europe were kind of licking

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.780
their wounds.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.820
They weren't sure what was
going on and they were

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.310
starting to feel threatened.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.800
And in particular, this guy
started to feel especially

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.540
threatened.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:18.300
This is Frederick-- once again
my spelling is not the

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.160
strongest, especially when I'm
doing something in German--

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.540
Frederick Wilhelm III.

00:02:25.445 --> 00:02:28.040
It actually took me a long time
to realize that Wilhelm

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.550
and William are the
same names.

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.350
And William is just the
English version of it.

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.060
But this is Frederick
Wilhelm III and he

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.310
is the King of Prussia.

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.570
And he stayed out of the action

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.080
during the Third Coalition.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.220
And even now, Prussia is
a major European power.

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.250
And he gets threatened by this
rising power of Napoleon, who

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.880
was able to break up, or almost
take away Austria's

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.590
influence from the Holy
Roman Empire.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.510
And now it kind of becomes this

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:58.820
Confederation of the Rhine.

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.850
Let me show you the map.

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.515
So this whole area over here.

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.770
All of this right over here,
which is now mainly modern day

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:20.090
Germany, that used to be the
Holy Roman Empire, it's

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.840
emperor was the King of
Austria, who wasn't

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.790
necessarily in it, but it kind
of implies some type of

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.030
allegiance.

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:30.370
This is France right here.

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.170
Once he was able to trounce
Austria in Austerlitz--

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.240
Austria and Russia-- then
this becomes the

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.630
Confederation of the Rhine.

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.290
Let me highlight this
a little bit better.

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.850
So this general area.

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.720
Holy Roman Empire no
longer exists.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.730
And it now becomes kind of a
satellite region of France.

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.120
France has a huge amount
of control.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.670
So you could imagine that the
King of Prussia starts getting

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:55.350
a little bit threatened.

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.740
France is on its borders, it has
shown itself to be able to

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.890
defeat other great
powers with ease.

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.880
So this guy gets a little
paranoid whether he feels that

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.630
France might kind of threaten
Prussia's power.

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:10.440
Or maybe on the other side of
the equation, that he just

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.910
didn't like this upstart who was
not related to all of the

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.870
other royalty of Europe.

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.790
He maybe wanted to put
him in his place.

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:23.250
So Frederick Wilhelm
III declares war.

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:28.430
We're now in 1806.

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:41.320
We have Prussia declares
war on France.

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.420
And you're going to see this
pattern multiple times.

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.430
And the one thing to kind of
remember, if you just want to

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.340
remember kind of major themes.

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.210
We're always talking about the
First Coalition, Second

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:50.430
Coalition, Third Coalition,
Fourth

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:51.190
Coalition, all of these.

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.310
And it's always some combination
of Britain.

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.780
And Britain has kind of already
dominated the ocean.

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.480
So when we talk about these
battles on land, we're not

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:00.250
talking about Britain much.

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.700
But this whole time, Britain is
in the background trying to

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.990
be a pain in France's neck.

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:06.560
And then all the other
coalitions are some

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.900
combination of Prussia,
Austria, and Russia.

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.390
And some other countries
here and there.

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:13.550
But you see one after another
that they keep challenging

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:14.750
Napoleon up to this point.

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.930
And Napoleon keeps trouncing
them, takes more and more land

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:19.340
and territory and
power from them.

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.550
And they get even more insecure
and then they want to

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.080
form other coalitions.

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.690
So this happens again.

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.770
And this is the start of
the Fourth Coalition.

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:28.370
In the last video,
it was the third.

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:32.650
This is now the formation
of the fourth.

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.890
And essentially, the coalition
forms as soon as someone else

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:37.520
other than Great Britain
joins the fight.

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.290
Because Great Britain is kind
of in a continuous war with

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:43.370
Napoleon over this entire
time period.

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:46.000
So we've got this Fourth
Coalition that forms. We've

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.050
got Prussia, we've got Great
Britain, and Russia wants to

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.890
join the fight again.

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:54.240
So as you can imagine, the end
of the Third Coalition didn't

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.960
keep Russia out of the
fight for long.

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:57.850
Let me write it down.

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:03.510
You have Prussia, Russia,
and Great Britain.

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:05.840
There's always some other
actors, but these are the

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.550
major ones.

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:10.730
And it was kind of silly
on the part of Prussia.

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:13.510
Because Prussia would've been in
a much better situation if

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:15.520
it had helped the
Third Coalition.

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.960
Maybe that would have
changed the outcome.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.160
But now they're kind of taking
on Napoleon, at least

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.110
initially on their own.

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:25.510
Because Russia is always kind of
behind Austria or Prussia,

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.130
depending which coalition
you're talking about.

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:28.940
So Prussia and Austria
are always the

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:29.830
first line of offense.

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:32.250
In this case, in the Fourth
Coalition, it's Prussia.

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:38.550
And they get trounced
in Jena-Auerstedt.

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:39.530
Let me show you where that is.

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:42.600
So this is actually Napoleon
getting the troops together at

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.080
Jena-Auerstedt.

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:47.190
This right here is a charge of
the French troops there.

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:48.440
Let me write this down.

00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:01.440
Two cities close by each
other in Germany.

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:06.010
They are roughly around here.

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:09.300
Let's see, this map is a little
difficult to read.

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:13.210
But they're roughly in that
area right there.

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:15.740
Napoleon, once again,
he trounces Prussia.

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:17.780
So Prussia is just
out of the way.

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:27.420
That's in October of 1806.

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:30.890
And then Napoleon essentially
chases the Russians through

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:32.275
most of what's now Poland.

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:41.110
He has this hugely bloody
stalemate at Eylau.

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:42.250
I don't even know
how to say that.

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:44.390
It's right around there.

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:46.265
If I read my maps correctly.

00:07:46.265 --> 00:07:47.515
So a stalemate.

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:53.830
This is in 1807.

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:59.780
Stalemate, February 1807
at-- let me get the

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:03.020
spelling right, E-Y-L-A-U.

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:03.900
Super bloody.

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:05.000
They actually win the battle.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.130
But they aren't able to
decisively defeat the Russian

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:10.130
troops, or the Russian army.

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:12.220
And there are estimates that
in that one battle, there's

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:15.520
anywhere from 15,000 to 25,000
casualties on both sides.

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.490
Which was huge at that time.

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:20.440
Even now, if you think about
even modern wars, that's a

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:22.260
major amount of casualties
to have in

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.600
just one single battle.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:28.730
But Napoleon persists, and
he's eventually able to

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:34.159
decisively meet the Russians at
Friedland, which is right

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:35.409
about there.

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:45.500
That is in June of 1807.

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:48.400
And then he's able
to decisively

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.680
defeat the Fourth Coalition.

00:08:50.680 --> 00:09:01.150
So here we we're kind of
at the summer of 1807.

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:03.930
We're talking about June is
when Friedland occurs,

00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:05.875
Russians decisively defeated.

00:09:05.875 --> 00:09:09.530
The Prussians were already
trounced several months ago.

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:20.380
And then in July of '07, July
of 1807, you have France

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:22.060
signing the Treaties
of Tilsit.

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:30.540
And it's called the Treaties
of Tilsit, instead of the

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:34.150
Treaty of Tilsit, because he
signed separate treaties with

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:35.880
Russia and Prussia.

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.750
At this point, Napoleon
had kind of lost

00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:39.560
all respect for Prussia.

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:40.650
And he wanted to show it.

00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:43.040
So he had a separate treaty with
Prussia and a separate

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.190
treaty with Russia.

00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:46.170
The one with Russia was a
lot more respectable.

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:48.960
It had all this language about
how Napoleon and Tsar

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:51.120
Alexander I are now friends.

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:54.530
This is Tsar Alexander
I right here.

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:01.220
And as you'll see, this
friendship is very temporary.

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:03.620
As you could imagine, I mean
this is the guy Napoleon

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:05.940
defeated at Austerlitz
not too long ago.

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:09.380
So all this friendship should
probably be written in quotes.

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:11.920
But the treaty with Russia
was very friendly.

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:17.280
And I think Napoleon still
respected Russia's power.

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:22.835
So friendly with Russia, it
declared them allies.

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:33.600
But the other Treaty of Tilsit
with Prussia carved it up.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:38.010
Carved up Prussia.

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:40.720
And the main thing it did, if we
look at this map here, this

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:43.250
is a map of central Europe.

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:47.720
Or I guess Prussia and Austria
and France at the end of the

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:48.780
Third Coalition.

00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:51.250
The main thing it did, it took
the territory west of the

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:53.750
river Elbe from Prussia.

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:57.070
So this is the river
Elbe right here.

00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:02.720
The blue is Prussia after
the Third Coalition.

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:06.150
So all of this stuff gets
taken away from Prussia.

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:09.310
And most of it turns into a
French satellite kingdom

00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:11.600
called the Kingdom
of Westphalia.

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:15.000
So this is part of the Prussian
Treaty of Tilsit.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.400
So you have the Kingdom
of Westphalia.

00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:26.130
And to really emphasize,
it really is a

00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:27.370
French satellite state.

00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:31.470
And to add insult to injury to
the Prussians, Napoleon puts

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:33.140
his brother Jerome as king.

00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:47.290
So it really is a satellite
state of France.

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:49.790
So here at the end of this,
the other powers in Europe

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:53.790
haven't learned that this
Napoleon character with his

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:56.490
grand army, this huge army that
he's been able to raise

00:11:56.490 --> 00:12:00.550
and his military tactics, really
is someone formidable

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:01.270
to deal with.

00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:04.000
So they keep, Third Coalition,
and then they lose territory.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.190
Then the Fourth Coalition,
then they

00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:07.050
lose even more territory.

00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:09.790
So what happens at the end of
this Fourth Coalition, and

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:13.360
actually during the Fourth
Coalition, after Napoleon

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:15.460
defeated Prussia, he realized
gee, you know what?

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:20.300
I have, I'm in either direct
control or indirect control of

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:22.160
a significant part of Europe.

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:24.880
And at the same time, he knew
that Britain had complete

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:26.110
domination of the oceans.

00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:29.410
And it was this kind of rising
industrial power.

00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:33.100
It was the beginning of the
Industrial Revolution.

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:40.950
So Napoleon's ideas, well I
can't defeat Great Britain on

00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:41.730
the waters.

00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:42.490
Did I say Russia?

00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:46.140
No I've been saying-- the whole
point is that Great

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:48.090
Britain is dominant
on the oceans.

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:50.580
And Napoleon realizes
that he can't invade

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:52.050
Great Britain by sea.

00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:56.630
He can't do anything in the
water with Great Britain kind

00:12:56.630 --> 00:12:57.950
of pestering him.

00:12:57.950 --> 00:13:02.280
So what he tries to do is
declare economic warfare on

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:02.730
Great Britain.

00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:08.740
And he institutes at
the end of 1806,

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:09.940
the Continental System.

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:11.180
So I'll put this right here.

00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:13.550
This is in November of 1806.

00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:16.400
So this is right after he
trounces the Prussians at

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:19.120
Jena-Auerstedt.

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:23.560
This is in November of 1806,
where he's feeling really good

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:26.930
about his strength on the
actual continent.

00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:29.050
He institutes what he calls
the Continental System.

00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:37.040
And this is really just the
notion of economic warfare

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:37.850
with Great Britain.

00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:41.770
That hey, if you are either a
part of the French Empire,

00:13:41.770 --> 00:13:45.370
controlled by the French Empire,
or aligned with the

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:47.670
French Empire, you embargo
Great Britain.

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:50.610
This little island, it controls
the waters, but it is

00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:51.730
dependant on trade.

00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:54.580
So Napoleon's idea through this
Continental System is to

00:13:54.580 --> 00:14:02.185
embargo the United Kingdom of
Great Britain, whatever we

00:14:02.185 --> 00:14:02.770
want to call it.

00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:04.320
Embargo Great Britain.

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:11.150
And one thing he got out of
the Russians, this was

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:13.990
actually a huge concession,
because Russia was a major

00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:15.510
power at the time.

00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:20.640
He got them, through the Treaty
of Tilsit, to also join

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:21.890
the Continental System.

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:26.380
Let me write that in a color
that'll actually show up.

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:36.730
And in return, he also got some
land, some islands, the

00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:39.790
Ionian Islands off the western
coast of Greece.

00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:43.630
And some of the land off the
Dalmatian coast. Let me show

00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:44.450
you right there.

00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:46.760
So this area over here.

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:49.830
And Russia in return, and it's
pretty good because Russia

00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:52.660
essentially lost the war, but in
return they were allowed to

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:54.460
do whatever they want with
the Ottoman Empire.

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:56.760
And we'll talk more about the
Ottoman Empire in future

00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:59.110
videos, but if you want to have
a general view of what

00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:04.040
the Ottoman Empire is, I guess
the last remnant of it is what

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:05.550
is today modern Turkey.

00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:08.500
But obviously it was an
empire at that time.

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:11.010
But Russia and the Ottoman
Empire were kind of that at

00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:11.960
odds with each other.

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:14.310
So it was great for Russia to
say hey, I'm going to be able

00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:16.730
to do whatever I want with
the Ottoman Empire.

00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:20.380
Because before this, Napoleon
was nominally

00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:22.170
aligned with the Ottomans.

00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:25.360
So this was actually a big
concession for Russia.

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:28.550
So at the end of this, we have
a situation once again, I

00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:31.100
guess the other powers
don't realize it.

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:36.070
Over and over, Third Coalition,
Napoleon, he really

00:15:36.070 --> 00:15:39.080
takes care of the Russians
and the Austrians.

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:41.190
Destroys the Holy Roman
Empire, makes it the

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:44.930
Confederation of the Rhine
under Napoleon's control.

00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:48.290
Prussia wants to put
down Napoleon.

00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:50.660
Declares war again,
Fourth Coalition.

00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:55.070
The only by-product of that is
now they lose this land.

00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:57.140
Napoleon becomes
even stronger.

00:15:57.140 --> 00:16:02.380
Puts his brother as king in
the kingdom of Westphalia.

00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:06.020
And now he has Russia
as an ally to help

00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:07.780
his embargo on England.

00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:11.820
So really, after the end of the
Fourth Coalition, a lot of

00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:14.980
historians view this as kind
of the height of Napoleon's

00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:17.480
power in Europe.
