00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.730
Deflation is literally
just a lowering of prices,

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:06.980
or a general
decrease in the level

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:08.759
of prices for
goods and services.

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:10.800
Or another way to think
about it, since inflation

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.030
is an increase in
the level of prices,

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:18.690
you can just view it
as negative inflation.

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.500
And so, let's say we're the
folks at the Bureau of Labor

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.400
Statistics, and we're trying
to compute the CPI index.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.490
And in one period-- let's call
this period one over here--

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.520
we have our CPI index
for urban consumers.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.416
And that's the one
that's quoted most often.

00:00:34.416 --> 00:00:35.790
And we have this
basket of goods.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.190
And it'll have housing in it.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.060
Let me write that a
little bit neater.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.440
It'll have housing in it.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.360
It'll have transportation in it.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.150
It'll have a fuel in it.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.800
It might have some
proxy for entertainment

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.570
or whatever else inside of it.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.450
And that basket of goods,
let's say in period one--

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.500
and this is a
simplification-- runs

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.030
that urban consumer
on average $100.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.350
And then we go to
period two, and we

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.330
look at that same
basket of goods.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.090
Maybe we're adjusting
certain things,

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.770
maybe some products
have become obsolete

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.650
and we have to
replace, or there has

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.627
to be some adjustments
for technology.

00:01:12.627 --> 00:01:14.960
And that's all under debate,
how you should adjust them.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.330
But given that,
assuming everything else

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.210
is equal, that same basket of
goods is now running at $98.

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.070
And so the total cost
of goods and services

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:30.330
for this kind of average
consumer has gone down by $2.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.540
Or we could say that
we've experienced

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.720
negative 2% inflation,
which is really

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:44.720
just another way of saying that
we have experienced deflation.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.220
Now, deflation is not
the norm, especially

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.960
for growing economies,
the way that

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.230
our current economic systems
runs, although it does happen.

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.280
And Japan in
particular is probably

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.100
the most recent, most
famous case of deflation.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.750
And the main reason
why economists really

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.150
don't like deflation-- or
I should say in particular,

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.560
while central bankers really
don't like deflation--

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.400
is that it makes it much
harder to control the economy

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.990
or to fuel the economy
with interest rates

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.290
alone, or actually just
with printing money alone.

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.956
And I'll go into a
little bit more depth

00:02:16.956 --> 00:02:18.456
with that in future videos.

00:02:18.456 --> 00:02:19.830
One thing I do
want to make clear

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.730
is although deflation
isn't what we normally

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.020
see in the broader
economy as a whole,

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.480
it does happen very frequently
in specific sectors.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.750
And the most common one is
in the technology sector,

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.810
specifically hardware.

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.980
We've all experienced buying
a laptop at one period--

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:42.050
so right now you buy the
laptop for maybe $1,000--

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.450
and then six months
later you see

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.041
that exact same laptop for $500.

00:02:49.041 --> 00:02:51.540
And that's just because the
rate of technological innovation

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.280
is going so fast
that they can produce

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.890
the same amount of memory
and processing power

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.292
for a lot cheaper now.

00:02:57.292 --> 00:02:58.750
Or for the same
amount of money you

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.140
can get much more memory
and processing power,

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.640
and all of the rest.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.350
And you see this with laptops
and with a big screen TVs

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.980
and phones and all the rest.
