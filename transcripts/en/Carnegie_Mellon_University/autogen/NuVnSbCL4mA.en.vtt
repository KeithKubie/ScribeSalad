skating is pretty much all physics when

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210
skating is pretty much all physics when
 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.870
skating is pretty much all physics when
I'm starting the spin I would start with

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880
I'm starting the spin I would start with
 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.139
I'm starting the spin I would start with
my arms out and then slowly bring my

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149
my arms out and then slowly bring my
 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.959
my arms out and then slowly bring my
arms in and this increases the speed

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969
arms in and this increases the speed
 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.510
arms in and this increases the speed
because I'm decreasing my moment of

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520
because I'm decreasing my moment of
 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.470
because I'm decreasing my moment of
inertia and because of the mathematical

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480
inertia and because of the mathematical
 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.020
inertia and because of the mathematical
equations that lie behind this

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030
equations that lie behind this
 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.209

I am also increasing my angular velocity

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219
I am also increasing my angular velocity
 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.470
I am also increasing my angular velocity
and therefore spinning a lot faster my

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480
and therefore spinning a lot faster my
 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.090
