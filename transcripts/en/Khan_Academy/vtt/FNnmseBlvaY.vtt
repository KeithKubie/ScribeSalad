00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.750
Now we have a very, very,
very hairy expression.

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:09.375
And once again, I'm going to
see if you can simplify this.

00:00:09.375 --> 00:00:11.000
And I'll give you
little time to do it.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.480
So this one is even crazier than
the last few we've looked at.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.960
We've got y's and
xy's, and x squared

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.730
and x's, well more just xy's and
y squared and on and on and on.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.370
And there will be a temptation,
because you see a y here

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:29.940
and a y here to
say, oh, maybe I can

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.549
add this negative
3y plus this 4xy

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:34.830
somehow since I see a y and a y.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.360
But the important
thing to realize here

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.380
is that a y is
different than an xy.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:41.810
Think about it
they were numbers.

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:46.672
If y was 3 and an x was a
2, then a y would be a 3

00:00:46.672 --> 00:00:49.270
while an xy would have been a 6.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.010
And a y is very different
than a y squared.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.710
Once again, if the why it
took on the value 3, then

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.270
the y squared would
be the value 9.

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.580
So even though you see
the same letter here,

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.640
they aren't the same-- I
guess you cannot add these two

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.480
or subtract these two terms.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.610
A y is different
than a y squared,

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.860
is different than an xy.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.640
Now with that said, let's
see if there is anything

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.480
that we can simplify.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.700
So first, let's think
about the y terms.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.060
So you have a negative 3y there.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.140
Do we have any more y term?

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.710
Yes, we do.

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.889
We have this 2y
right over there.

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:24.930
So I'll just write it
out-- I'll just reorder it.

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.860
So we have negative 3y plus 2y.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.770
Now, let's think
about-- and I'm just

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.380
going in an arbitrary order,
but since our next term is an xy

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.970
term-- let's think about
all of the xy terms.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.945
So we have plus 4xy
right over here.

00:01:41.945 --> 00:01:43.570
So let me just write
it down-- I'm just

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.200
reordering the whole
expression-- plus 4xy.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.990
And then I have minus
4xy right over here.

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.550
Then let's go to
the x squared terms.

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.810
I have negative 2 times x
squared, or minus 2x squared.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.830
So let's look at this.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.590
So I have minus 2x squared.

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.360
Do I have any other x squared?

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.080
Yes, I do.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.240
I have this 3x squared
right over there.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.720
So plus 3x squared.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.990
And then let's see, I have
an x term right over here,

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.220
and that actually looks
like the only x term.

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.390
So that's plus 2x.

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.190
And then I only
have one y squared

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.320
term-- I'll circle that in
orange-- so plus y squared.

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.880
So all I have done is I've
reordered the statement

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.820
and I've color coded it based
on the type of term we have.

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.160
And now it should be
a little bit simpler.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.740
So let's try it out.

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.580
If I have negative
3 of something

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.524
plus 2 of that something,
what do I have?

00:02:43.524 --> 00:02:45.690
Or another way to say it,
if I have two of something

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.730
and I subtract 3 of that,
what am I left with?

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.940
Well, I'm left with negative
1 of that something.

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.872
So I could write negative 1y, or
I could just write negative y.

00:02:55.872 --> 00:02:57.580
And another way you
could think about it,

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.496
but I like to think about
it intuitively more,

00:02:59.496 --> 00:03:00.960
is what's the coefficient here?

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.254
It is negative 3.

00:03:02.254 --> 00:03:03.420
What's the coefficient here?

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:04.160
It's 2.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.576
Where obviously
both are dealing--

00:03:05.576 --> 00:03:07.440
they're both y
terms, not xy terms,

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.880
not y squared terms, just y.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.560
And so negative 3
plus 2 is negative 1,

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.000
or negative 1y is the
same thing as negative y.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.300
So those simplify to
this right over here.

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.180
Now let's look at the xy terms.

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.560
If I have 4 of
this, 4 xy's and I

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.060
were to take away 4 xy's,
how many xy's am I left with?

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.890
Well, I'm left with no xy's.

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.170
Or you could say add
the coefficients,

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.740
4 plus negative 4,
gives you 0 xy's.

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:39.450
Either way, these
two cancel out.

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.120
If I have 4 of something
and I take away

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.350
those 4 of that something,
I'm left with none of them.

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.940
And so I'm left with no xy's.

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.830
And then I have
right over here--

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.910
I could have written
0xy, but that

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.420
seems unnecessary--
then right over here

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.160
I have my x squared terms.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.700
Negative 2 plus 3 is 1.

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.240
Or another way of saying
it, if I have 3x squared

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.830
and I were to take
away 2 of those x

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.540
squared, so I'm left
with the 1x squared.

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.140
So this right over here
simplifies to 1x squared.

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.950
Or I could literally
just write x squared.

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.450
1x squared is the same
thing as x squared.

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.779
So plus x squared,
and then these there's

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:18.260
nothing really left to simplify.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:23.675
So plus 2x plus y squared.

00:04:27.365 --> 00:04:27.990
And we're done.

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.000
And obviously you
might have gotten

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.250
an answer in some other
order, but the order

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.059
in which I write these
terms don't matter.

00:04:33.059 --> 00:04:35.100
It just matters that you
were able to simplify it

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.535
to these four terms.
