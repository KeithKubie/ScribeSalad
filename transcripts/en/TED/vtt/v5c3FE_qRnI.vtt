00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.416
I'm here to tell you not just my story

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.456
but stories of exceptional women
from India whom I've met.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.616
They continue to inspire me,

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.976
teach me, guide me
in my journey of my life.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.056
These are incredible women.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.176
They never had an opportunity
to go to school,

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.976
they had no degrees,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.160
no travel, no exposure.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.696
Ordinary women
who did extraordinary things

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.856
with the greatest of their courage,

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.920
wisdom and humility.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.120
These are my teachers.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.896
For the last three decades,

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.336
I've been working,
staying and living in India

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.320
and working with women in rural India.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.160
I was born and brought up in Mumbai.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.696
When I was in college,

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.936
I met Jayaprakash Narayan,

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.256
famous Gandhian leader

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.400
who inspired youth to work in rural India.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.616
I went into the villages
to work in rural India.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.416
I was part of land rights movement,

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.936
farmers' movement

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.320
and women's movement.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.696
On the same line,

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.696
I ended up in a very small village,

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:33.136
fell in love with a young, handsome,
dynamic young farmer-leader

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.496
who was not very educated,

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.856
but he could pull the crowd.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.456
And so in the passion of youth,

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.336
I married him

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.816
and left Mumbai,

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.016
and went to a small village
which did not have running water

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.320
and no toilet.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.136
Honestly, my family
and friends were horrified.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.310
(Laughter)

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.736
I was staying with my family,

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.376
with my three children in the village,

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.176
and one day,

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.456
a few years later one day,

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.280
a woman called Kantabai came to me.

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:14.296
Kantabai said, "I want
to open a saving account.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.520
I want to save."

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.096
I asked Kantabai:

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.576
"You are doing business of blacksmith.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.576
Do you have enough money to save?

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.976
You are staying on the street.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.256
Can you save?"

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.216
Kantabai was insistent.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:34.456
She said, "I want to save
because I want to buy a plastic sheet

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.136
before the monsoons arrive.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.720
I want to save my family from rain."

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.416
I went with Kantabai to the bank.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.456
Kantabai wanted to save 10 rupees a day --

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.640
less than 15 cents.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.976
Bank manager refused to open
the account of Kantabai.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.936
He said Kantabai's amount is too small

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.560
and it's not worth his time.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.656
Kantabai was not asking
any loan from the bank.

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.016
She was not asking any subsidy
or grant from the government.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.976
What she was asking
was to have a safe place

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.096
to save her hard-earned money.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.720
And that was her right.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.696
And I went --

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.176
I said if banks are not opening
the account of Kantabai,

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.336
why not start the bank

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.440
which will give an opportunity
for women like Kantabai to save?

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.880
And I applied for the banking license
to Reserve Bank of India.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.240
(Applause)

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.536
No, it was not an easy task.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.576
Our license was rejected --

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:44.976
(Laughter)

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.216
on the grounds --

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.176
Reserve Bank said
that we cannot issue a license

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.680
to the bank whose promoting
members who are nonliterate.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:54.896
I was terrified.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.336
I was crying.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.256
And by coming back home,

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.216
I was continuously crying.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.616
I told Kantabai and other women

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.520
that we couldn't get the license
because our women are nonliterate.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.400
Our women said, "Stop crying.

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.536
We will learn to read and write

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.576
and apply again, so what?"

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:20.000
(Applause)

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.056
We started our literacy classes.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.616
Every day our women would come.

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.375
They were so determined
that after working the whole day,

00:04:30.399 --> 00:04:33.856
they would come to the class
and learn to read and write.

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.256
After five months,

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.816
we applied again,

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.856
but this time I didn't go alone.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.240
Fifteen women accompanied me
to Reserve Bank of India.

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.456
Our women told
the officer of Reserve Bank,

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.856
"You rejected the license
because we cannot read and write.

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.976
You rejected the license
because we are nonliterate."

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.816
But they said, "There were no schools
when we were growing,

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.840
so we are not responsible
for our noneducation."

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.456
And they said, "We cannot read and write,

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:05.856
but we can count."

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.896
(Laughter)

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.776
(Applause)

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.680
And they challenged the officer.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.696
"Then tell us to calculate
the interest of any principal amount."

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:17.736
(Laughter)

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.536
"If we are unable to do it,

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.416
don't give us license.

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.016
Tell your officers to do it
without a calculator

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.616
and see who can calculate faster."

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.400
(Applause)

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.016
Needless to say,

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.896
we got the banking license.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.616
(Laughter)

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:40.880
(Applause)

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.576
Today, more than 100,000
women are banking with us

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.456
and we have more
than 20 million dollars of capital.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.896
This is all women's savings,

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.336
women capital,

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.256
no outside investors
asking for a business plan.

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.496
No.

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.416
It's our own rural women's savings.

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.800
(Applause)

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.336
I also want to say that yes,

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.456
after we got the license,

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:15.376
today Kantabai has her own house

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.016
and is staying with her family

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:20.440
in her own house
for herself and her family.

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:26.056
(Applause)

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.376
When we started our banking operations,

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.816
I could see that our women
were not able to come to the bank

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.136
because they used to lose the working day.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.776
I thought if women
are not coming to the bank,

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.216
bank will go to them,

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.400
and we started doorstep banking.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.440
Recently, we starting digital banking.

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.936
Digital banking required
to remember a PIN number.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:51.576
Our women said,
"We don't want a PIN number.

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.256
That's not a good idea."

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:54.816
And we tried to explain to them

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.336
that maybe you should
remember the PIN number;

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.696
we will help you
to remember the PIN number.

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:00.936
They were firm.

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:02.776
They said, "suggest something else,"

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.016
and they --

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.896
(Laughter)

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.280
and they said, "What about thumb?"

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.656
I thought that's a great idea.

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:16.136
We'll link that digital banking
with biometric,

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.736
and now women use the digital
financial transaction

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:21.296
by using the thumb.

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:22.880
And you know what they said?

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.256
They said, "Anybody
can steal my PIN number

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.416
and take away my hard-earned money,

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.416
but nobody can steal my thumb."

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:34.816
(Applause)

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:39.816
That reinforced the teaching
which I have always learned from women:

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.880
never provide poor solutions
to poor people.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.016
They are smart.

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:50.520
(Applause)

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.976
A few months later,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.016
another woman came to the bank --

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:58.576
Kerabai.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:02.016
She mortgaged her gold and took the loan.

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:06.736
I asked Kerabai, "Why are you
mortgaging your precious jewelry

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:08.456
and taking a loan?"

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:12.456
Kerabai said, "Don't you realize
that it's a terrible drought?

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:15.976
There's no food or fodder for the animals.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.376
No water.

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:21.896
I'm mortgaging gold to buy
food and fodder for my animals."

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:26.696
And then she asks me,
"Can I mortgage gold and get water?"

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:27.920
I had no answer.

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:32.016
Kerabai challenged me:
"You're working in the village

00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:33.936
with women and finance,

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:37.416
but what if one day there's no water?

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:38.776
If you leave this village,

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:40.680
with whom are you going to do banking?"

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.976
Kerabai had a valid question,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.456
so in this drought,

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:49.080
we decided to start
the cattle camp in the area.

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:53.736
It's where farmers can bring
their animals to one place

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:56.159
and get fodder and water.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:58.856
It didn't rain.

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:01.736
Cattle camp was extended for 18 months.

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:05.056
Kerabai used to move around
in the cattle camp

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:08.216
and sing the songs of encouragement.

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.960
Kerabai became very popular.

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:14.616
It rained and cattle camp was ended,

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:16.536
but after cattle camp ended,

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:18.736
Kerabai came to our radio --

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:20.696
we have community radio

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:23.776
which has more than 100,000 listeners.

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:27.240
She said, "I want to have
a regular show on the radio."

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:32.656
Our radio manager said,
"Kerabai, you cannot read and write.

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:34.736
How will you write the script?"

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:36.376
You know what she replied?

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:37.976
"I cannot read and write,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.416
but I can sing.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:40.696
What's the big deal?"

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.456
(Laughter)

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:43.736
And today,

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:47.016
Kerabai is doing a regular radio program,

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:48.416
and not only that,

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:51.456
she's become a famous radio jockey

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:54.176
and she has been
invited by all of the radios,

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:55.776
even from Mumbai.

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:58.736
She gets the invitation
and she does the show.

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:04.136
(Applause)

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.776
Kerabai has become a local celebrity.

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:08.496
One day I asked Kerabai,

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:10.320
"How did you end up singing?"

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:14.616
She said, "Shall I tell you the real fact?

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:17.456
When I was pregnant with my first child,

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:19.216
I was always hungry.

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:21.176
I did not have enough food to eat.

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:24.056
I did not have enough money to buy food,

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:28.080
and so to forget my hunger,
I started singing."

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:30.920
So strong and wise, no?

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:36.576
I always think that our women
overcome so many obstacles --

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:39.736
cultural, social, financial --

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:42.440
and they find out their ways.

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:45.736
I would like to share another story:

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:47.616
Sunita Kamble.

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:51.696
She has taken a course
in a business school,

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.496
and she has become a veterinary doctor.

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:55.736
She's Dalit;

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:57.856
she comes from an untouchable caste,

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:01.080
but she does artificial
insemination in goats.

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:04.136
It is a very male-dominated profession

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.816
and it is all the more
difficult for Sunita

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:09.336
because Sunita comes
from an untouchable caste.

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:11.016
But she worked very hard.

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:15.496
She did successful
goat deliveries in the region

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:17.720
and she became a famous goat doctor.

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:21.160
Recently, she got a national award.

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:25.296
I went to Sunita's house to celebrate --

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:26.936
to congratulate her.

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:28.336
When I entered the village,

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:31.016
I saw a big cutout of Sunita.

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:33.336
Sunita was smiling on that picture.

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:36.856
I was really surprised
to see an untouchable,

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:38.376
coming from the village,

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:41.120
having a big cutout
at the entrance of the village.

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:43.376
When I went to her house,

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:45.536
I was even more amazed

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:47.856
because upper caste leaders --

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:50.616
men -- were sitting
in the house, in her house,

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:52.976
and having chai and water,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.016
which is very rare in India.

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:57.856
Upper caste leaders
do not go to an untouchable's house

00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:59.696
and have chai or water.

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:01.616
And they were requesting her

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:04.600
to come and address
the gathering of the village.

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:10.920
Sunita broke centuries-old
caste conditioning in India.

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:17.696
(Applause)

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:20.280
Let me come to what
the younger generations do.

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:22.776
As I'm standing here --

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:25.296
I'm so proud as I stand here,

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:27.320
from Mhaswad to Vancouver.

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:31.216
Back home, Sarita Bhise --

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:34.056
she's not even 16 years old.

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:36.336
She's preparing herself --

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:38.456
she's a part of our sports program,

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:39.800
Champions' program.

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:44.816
She's preparing herself
to represent India in field hockey.

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:47.136
And you know where she's going?

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:52.696
She's going to represent
in 2020 Olympics, Tokyo.

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:57.976
(Applause)

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.080
Sarita comes from
a very poor shepherd community.

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:05.480
I am just -- I couldn't be
more proud of her.

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:11.576
There are millions of women
like Sarita, Kerabai, Sunita,

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:13.616
who can be around you also.

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:15.736
They can be all over the world,

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:20.416
but at first glance you may think
that they do not have anything to say,

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:22.576
they do not have anything to share.

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:24.656
You would be so wrong.

00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:28.456
I am so lucky that I'm working
with these women.

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:31.016
They are sharing their stories with me,

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:33.696
they are sharing their wisdom with me,

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:37.320
and I'm just lucky to be with them.

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:39.480
20 years before --

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:42.016
and I'm so proud --

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:44.136
we went to Reserve Bank of India

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:46.840
and we set up the first
rural women's bank.

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:51.816
Today they are pushing me
to go to National Stock Exchange

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:57.616
to set up the first fund dedicated
to micro rural women entrepreneurs.

00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:00.176
They are pushing me to set up

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:03.320
the first small finance
women's bank in the world.

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:06.176
And as one of them said,

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:08.536
"My courage is my capital."

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:10.296
And I say here,

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:13.040
their courage is my capital.

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.216
And if you want,

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:16.960
it can be yours also.

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:18.736
Thank you.

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:23.520
(Applause)
