You are listening to radiolab radio lash

2
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.500
from w.N y.

3
00:00:07.501 --> 00:00:11.670
S. E. N. N. P. R.

4
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.830
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad and I'm Robert Krulwich and today on the podcast.

5
00:00:16.831 --> 00:00:19.400
Hey Robert, can you scoot back a little bit from the mic? Don't worry.

6
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.640
We have a cloak and dagger maritime adventure in secrecy and truth from reporter

7
00:00:23.641 --> 00:00:24.500
Julia Barton. Jeff,

8
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.790
maybe first you could start off just by introducing yourself. Yeah,

9
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.510
so the story for me begins with this guy. Yeah. My name is Jeff Larson.

10
00:00:30.511 --> 00:00:32.790
I'm the data editor at Propublica.

11
00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.450
Pro Public has this investigative journalism outfit and Jeff does a lot of their

12
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.790
data based reporting. So in any case,

13
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.620
it was summer of 2013 you know that big story about how the NSA had just been

14
00:00:43.621 --> 00:00:47.160
monitoring billions of Verizon customers that just came out.

15
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.140
Jeff's watching the story like all of us are,

16
00:00:49.141 --> 00:00:51.600
and then the thought occurred to him, Geez,

17
00:00:51.601 --> 00:00:54.810
they're monitoring all of these people. Hey, does that include me?

18
00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:56.773
<v 1>Mm.</v>

19
00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.760
<v 0>So he goes over to the NSA's website.</v>

20
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.430
He was surprised to find that right there on the site.

21
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.280
<v 2>You could file a privacy act request for your metadata.</v>

22
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.050
They have a little online form right there,

23
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.870
this service that they offer to everybody.

24
00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.560
And so I went ahead and did that and said, this is yourself, you're requesting,

25
00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:16.460
you're saying, what do you,

26
00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.720
what do you know about who I called and who I heard from? Yes, exactly.

27
00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.490
What were you expecting? A, the best case scenario would be just a, you know,

28
00:01:25.491 --> 00:01:29.900
a page of all of the communications actually to my wife.

29
00:01:29.901 --> 00:01:32.900
My wife's a Verizon customer and I'm in a t and t customer,

30
00:01:32.901 --> 00:01:37.460
so all my phone calls to my wife, I guess I didn't think that I would ever know,

31
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.430
<v 0>um, any response back so that we hit submit expecting nothing to happen.</v>

32
00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:44.523
Right.

33
00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.000
<v 2>It was actually really, really quick.</v>

34
00:01:49.001 --> 00:01:53.080
I think it was on the order of 10 or 12 days. Um,

35
00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.720
you know, it came to my home, uh, addressed sort of a Manila envelope. You know,

36
00:01:58.721 --> 00:02:02.260
my wife called me immediately when she picked up the mail and said, hey,

37
00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:03.020
you know,

38
00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.100
you gotta you got a letter from the national security agency and there was

39
00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.720
complete panic in her voice.

40
00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.100
So now she's looking at the cabinets for small little beeping objects. Yeah,

41
00:02:12.101 --> 00:02:15.250
right, exactly. And when he opened up the letter, cause he read it. Yeah,

42
00:02:15.251 --> 00:02:16.870
I have, I actually have it up right now.

43
00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.880
<v 0>The letter said we cannot acknowledge the existence or nonexistence of such</v>

44
00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.960
metadata or call detail records pertaining to the telephone numbers that you

45
00:02:26.961 --> 00:02:27.794
provided.

46
00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.900
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

47
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.610
<v 0>exactly. What does one know when one hears that response? I don't know.</v>

48
00:02:34.611 --> 00:02:38.570
I mean, when you're a reporter and you hear that it's sort of the,

49
00:02:38.571 --> 00:02:39.980
it puts you in this weird place.

50
00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.700
So Jeff takes the letter into work the next day and he shows it to a colleague

51
00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.450
who had been doing a lot of reporting on drone strikes in Guantanamo.

52
00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.630
And he's like, what the hell is this? Does it mean something?

53
00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.910
And she said that was a Glomar response.

54
00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:54.483
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

55
00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.440
<v 0>How do you spell, how do you say is? How do you spell Glomar or Glomar?</v>

56
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.840
Glomar is a, g.

57
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.590
L. O. M. A. R. Glomar.

58
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.290
What did you think just of the word I thought it was.

59
00:03:08.291 --> 00:03:13.090
I thought it was a some lawyer named [inaudible] who had a argued associate,

60
00:03:13.091 --> 00:03:17.320
successfully argued the case because it sounded like a bit of legal ease.

61
00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.260
I didn't know the fascinating story behind it,

62
00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.890
so I started looking into it and right away found this nutty story involving a

63
00:03:25.991 --> 00:03:29.080
nuke, a claw, a billionaire, some manganese,

64
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:34.710
and this classic tension between secrets being really necessary and really

65
00:03:34.721 --> 00:03:38.890
harmful. Some manganese, but to get there you have to start with this guy. Okay.

66
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.880
Let's just start out by getting your name and how we should identify you. Well,

67
00:03:42.881 --> 00:03:46.420
my name is David Sharp. That's my real name.

68
00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.610
This makes it all much more mysterious.

69
00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.010
What have been some of your other name during the mission?

70
00:03:54.011 --> 00:03:56.320
My Name was David Scholz,

71
00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.050
so in the late sixties David was working at the CIA.

72
00:03:59.051 --> 00:04:03.670
He'd been there for awhile and he got called onto this new thing called project

73
00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.230
Azorian. A yes.

74
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:09.730
I started the program in 1969 here's what you need to know.

75
00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:12.060
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

76
00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.770
<v 0>in the late sixties the u s and the USSR were playing this high stakes chess</v>

77
00:04:16.771 --> 00:04:21.000
game with their nuclear submarines cruising around international waters.

78
00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.960
There was a lot of harassment that went on inching on each other's territories.

79
00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.120
In fact, in January,

80
00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.170
1968 a US naval ship was captured after leaving Japan and everyone was worried

81
00:04:31.171 --> 00:04:35.010
that the Soviets had our code books and there was an interest in getting even,

82
00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.581
well,

83
00:04:35.581 --> 00:04:40.581
two months later in March of 1968 a Soviet sub called the k one 29 just

84
00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.680
vanished. We don't know exactly why it's sunk.

85
00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:50.100
There's all kinds of conspiracy theories about what might have happened.

86
00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:55.310
It just sank to the bottom of the ocean and once the Soviets sent their search

87
00:04:55.591 --> 00:04:59.070
crews out trying to locate it and failed,

88
00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:04.490
we came in and somehow through our sensor technology or whatever reason,

89
00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.950
your conspiracy theory of choice might tell you we found the boat.

90
00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.930
So then the thought was if we could get inside that thing,

91
00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.950
such a bonanza, there was a lot to be learned.

92
00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.750
Whether it would be the code books, the cryptographic equipment or,

93
00:05:21.751 --> 00:05:24.720
and this is the big one of the nuclear missiles. It hadn't,

94
00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:28.530
it had nuclear missiles on board. Yep. The chief of naval operations,

95
00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:33.180
he really wanted to see if we couldn't recover that submarine, the whole thing.

96
00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:37.440
The problem was that the sub was three miles below the surface of the ocean and

97
00:05:37.441 --> 00:05:39.540
the pressures at that depth according to David,

98
00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.830
are roughly 7,500 pounds per square inch, which meant to get the whole thing up.

99
00:05:43.831 --> 00:05:47.130
They were looking at scenarios where they'd have to live something like 14

100
00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.280
million pounds. That's all. No Big One.

101
00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:54.870
So their solution is to get a room full of top secret engineers together and

102
00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.610
just start spitballing ideas.

103
00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:00.720
Like what if we just went down there and attach rockets to it and

104
00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:05.520
last the target up to the surface. Uh, we'll wait.

105
00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:09.420
How do we catch it when it comes back down? Cause heavy. What if we, okay,

106
00:06:09.421 --> 00:06:10.970
we could, we could put these um,

107
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000
pawn tunes or gas filled bags and float the target up except that we can't get

108
00:06:16.231 --> 00:06:18.090
the gas in there because of the pressure.

109
00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:21.680
<v 5>Boy, these must have been amazing meetings where you could say anything.</v>

110
00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:23.090
You could say that.

111
00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:28.080
<v 4>So in the end they settled on a claw,</v>

112
00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:33.440
a claw. The idea was to build this Gargantuan eight fingered claw and,

113
00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:37.770
and a boat. And then you would put the claw in the boat,

114
00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:39.690
bring it out on the high seas,

115
00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:44.870
and then you would lower the claw on a three mile long piece of pipe string.

116
00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:48.600
And then like one of those carnival games, you know where you,

117
00:06:48.601 --> 00:06:51.270
you have to grab the toy by remote control.

118
00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:55.470
You would position the claw over the submarine and exactly. So,

119
00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:59.250
and then you would yank it off the bottom of the ocean,

120
00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:00.720
pull it back into the boat.

121
00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:04.350
Gates would open on the bottom of the boat in the claw and the submarine would

122
00:07:04.351 --> 00:07:08.880
come into a chamber and you'd have it. And you're not making any of this up.

123
00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:13.790
<v 0>I am totally not making it up. The CIA made it up because it just sounds weird,</v>

124
00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:17.210
but they did it. They got the money, they got the approval from the president,

125
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:21.250
but they still needed a cover story. So they called up Howard Hughes,

126
00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:25.280
the billionaire. Yup. And they ask him or probably his people.

127
00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:29.630
Do you guys think you could just pretend to have this sudden interest in

128
00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:33.410
manganese mining from the bottom of the ocean? That was the cover story. Yes.

129
00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:37.610
Partly because Howard Hughes was a known inventor.

130
00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:41.900
<v 5>It wasn't in Howard Hughes at this point, living in isolation in Las Vegas,</v>

131
00:07:41.901 --> 00:07:45.650
his fingernails growing inches long and being pretty bizarre.

132
00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:48.110
<v 0>You know, I don't know if he was living in Las Vegas,</v>

133
00:07:48.111 --> 00:07:51.900
but the rest of that I think is probably pretty accurate. Anyway,

134
00:07:51.901 --> 00:07:55.490
so they ended up building this massive ship. The Hughes Glomar explorer,

135
00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:59.210
the ship was called Glomar. That's where the word comes from. Yeah. It was

136
00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:04.440
<v 4>by this company called Global Marine Global Marine Glo Mar.</v>

137
00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.930
<v 0>Oh. And in July of 1974</v>

138
00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:13.310
they get the boat out there and they lower the claw.

139
00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:19.070
The Claude descends three miles to the bottom of the ocean where the sub is and

140
00:08:19.071 --> 00:08:22.400
the claw had lights and cameras on it so they could see what was happening.

141
00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:25.640
Do you remember when you first saw it? Yeah, I do.

142
00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:30.560
It was a very badly mangled hole and we could see it very well.

143
00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:35.780
They actually could watch as the clock wrapped its massive claw hand around this

144
00:08:35.781 --> 00:08:39.530
sub and began to pull it back up 14,000 feet,

145
00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:44.390
12,000 feet, about 9,000 feet from the surface.

146
00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:50.050
We were beginning to feel some cautious optimism that we might just pull this

147
00:08:50.091 --> 00:08:54.260
thing off after all. And then I felt a little, just a little,

148
00:08:55.320 --> 00:09:00.320
a little bump in the ship and we went to the control center and everything

149
00:09:02.041 --> 00:09:04.290
looked normal on the television screens.

150
00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:08.760
But then it suddenly occurred to the operators that these, uh,

151
00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:12.000
television images had not been refreshed. In other words,

152
00:09:12.001 --> 00:09:16.910
they were television images taken maybe 15 minutes ago. And, uh,

153
00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:21.480
when they refresh those images and got the real time picture of what was going

154
00:09:21.481 --> 00:09:25.860
on, it showed that we had lost, we'd lost most of the submarine,

155
00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:31.300
<v 4>basically the part of the sub with nukes, with the missiles,</v>

156
00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:35.710
maybe with the code books and all the stuff they wanted.

157
00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:39.640
That part broke off. And years of work,

158
00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:43.810
millions of dollars just lowly sank to the bottom of the ocean.

159
00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:46.100
<v 6>Did your heart go Ooh,</v>

160
00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:46.480
<v 1>yeah,</v>

161
00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:50.040
<v 0>yeah, yeah. It did. It, uh, it was, it was in</v>

162
00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:51.943
<v 1>no</v>

163
00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:53.200
<v 0>intensely, uh,</v>

164
00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:55.830
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

165
00:09:55.830 --> 00:10:00.480
<v 4>emotional. And in the end, did they find anything? We still don't really know.</v>

166
00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:04.410
They've never actually disclosed what they found in that piece.

167
00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:07.770
From David's description, it sounds like they didn't get a lot.

168
00:10:07.771 --> 00:10:10.200
But here's the whole reason I'm telling you this.

169
00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:15.840
It's because not long after that, like intense moment of disappointment,

170
00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.150
the story starts to break in the press.

171
00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:21.060
Journalists are starting to call up the CIA.

172
00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:24.630
They're asking all these intense questions, they're onto it.

173
00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:29.040
And the CIA has to figure out what to say and what not to say.

174
00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:32.340
<v 6>It's the debts. It's a dilemma. There's no question about that.</v>

175
00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:37.020
Which brings us to Walt, Walt Logan, which is just to be clear,

176
00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:39.360
not your actual name. It's a pseudonym. Okay,

177
00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:42.690
so in 1975 Walt was a lawyer at the CIA.

178
00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:47.580
At that time I was the associate general counsel and as the story was breaking

179
00:10:47.581 --> 00:10:49.800
and all these journalists were asking questions,

180
00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:53.100
it became his job to develop the response.

181
00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:57.810
Simple except not so simple. Yes,

182
00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:02.460
there is a diplomatic element of what's going on in here that isn't so obvious

183
00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:07.580
and that is that you have the Soviet Union and the United States at odds

184
00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:12.680
<v 0>and the problem was that we didn't want the Soviets to know either what we had</v>

185
00:11:13.771 --> 00:11:16.230
found out or what we hadn't found out.

186
00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:18.390
Either way would have been bad since David Sharp.

187
00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:23.310
If we said that we didn't recover any information on Soviet missiles,

188
00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:24.210
which was the truth,

189
00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:27.480
then that would tell the Soviets that they don't have to worry about the

190
00:11:27.481 --> 00:11:31.380
security regarding their warheads. David says, we wanted them to worry.

191
00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:34.380
This is the Cold War. We might as well make them think. We found something.

192
00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:35.763
On the other hand,

193
00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:40.820
if we said that we did recover information on the missiles,

194
00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:44.880
but we're not going to tell you that would be line and they couldn't do that.

195
00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:46.280
We don't.

196
00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:50.360
<v 6>Governments lie all the time. Why couldn't they lie? Well, because this is 1974</v>

197
00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:54.490
this is the year of Watergate.

198
00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:57.340
<v 4>This is the year that Congress Raikes,</v>

199
00:11:57.341 --> 00:12:00.490
the entire federal security apparatus over the coals.

200
00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:05.860
This is also the year they revisit something called the freedom of Information

201
00:12:05.861 --> 00:12:06.694
Act.

202
00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:07.763
<v 7>Well, [inaudible]</v>

203
00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:13.230
<v 4>brilliant for, yeah. Actually you had been around for awhile,</v>

204
00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:17.640
but that's when Foya finally got some teeth. The law says anybody,

205
00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:21.210
any American should be able to ask the government for documents and the

206
00:12:21.211 --> 00:12:25.560
government has to respond. Right? It has to fork over that information.

207
00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:31.390
<v 6>You put it this way. Well, it's not a huge fan of this law.</v>

208
00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:36.450
The Glomar was a tremendous investment of time and resources and to Willy Nilly,

209
00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:41.460
give it over to somebody who writes a letter to the agency is,

210
00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:43.300
is preposterous

211
00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:44.320
<v 4>the way wall sees it.</v>

212
00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:49.270
The CIA's job is to keep secrets and keeping secrets keeps America safe.

213
00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:53.650
Yes. In fact, every CIA employee is legally bound to protect them

214
00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:57.740
<v 6>being called intelligence sources and methods. It's not an option. It's a law.</v>

215
00:12:58.400 --> 00:12:59.960
Hence his dilemma.

216
00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:05.530
<v 4>So there he was between a rock and a hard spot under the foil law,</v>

217
00:13:05.531 --> 00:13:09.480
the public has a right to know. On the other hand, under Walt's oath,

218
00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:12.550
he has a legal obligation to not tell.

219
00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:16.600
It's like the classic tension of our times. Exactly. Walt has to say something.

220
00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:18.790
He has to be truthful when he says it,

221
00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:22.900
but he also cannot reveal anything. That's correct.

222
00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:27.390
And people at the agency had been trying to figure this out for months,

223
00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:29.220
which is why they brought in Walt.

224
00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:33.120
And how long did it take you to come up with this kind of response?

225
00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:35.740
<v 6>I would say probably a half an hour.</v>

226
00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:37.963
<v 4>Wow.</v>

227
00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:43.090
That half an hour of work has tortured journalists and lawyers for almost four

228
00:13:43.731 --> 00:13:45.680
decades. Here's what he came up with.

229
00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:49.350
<v 6>The Glomar response was basically the following. We can either</v>

230
00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:54.370
<v 8>confirm nor deny the existence of the information requested button.</v>

231
00:13:56.840 --> 00:14:00.800
Hypothetically, have such daily work to exist.

232
00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:05.170
<v 6>The subject matter would be classified and could not be disclosed.</v>

233
00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:09.970
Very straightforward. Now think about that. That's,

234
00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:13.900
that addresses what we were, you were just trying to put your finger on.

235
00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:18.130
You can't confirm it, which would be giving up secrets nor deny it,

236
00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:21.940
which would be a lie, but if it was classified, it couldn't be revealed. Anyway,

237
00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:23.283
suckers.

238
00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:27.590
<v 4>As you could imagine, people who filed these foyer requests,</v>

239
00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:31.670
when they got a response like that, they were like, that's not going to stand.

240
00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:36.170
You are the sucker. They fought it in court and the fight went on for years.

241
00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:39.500
Knock down, drag out, but eventually the government wins.

242
00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:41.570
The judge ruled in their favor. Well,

243
00:14:41.571 --> 00:14:46.571
the judge agreed to their logic that sometimes revealing even the existence of

244
00:14:47.481 --> 00:14:51.930
documents in dangers, national security, rock man, listen

245
00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:52.670
<v 0>to,</v>

246
00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:57.260
to make a long story short use of this kind of response exploded to the point

247
00:14:57.261 --> 00:14:59.690
where now you hear actors like will Smith using it.

248
00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:02.930
I can neither confirm nor deny,

249
00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:07.490
nor denied or hear Pixar characters using it. Hollywood publicist.

250
00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:12.230
I can neither confirm nor deny the rumors x Congressman Anthony Wiener,

251
00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:16.770
<v 9>Congressman Wiener told John Carl that the [inaudible] could neither confirm nor</v>

252
00:15:16.771 --> 00:15:18.810
deny that the photo of was him.

253
00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:23.060
<v 0>It's become this total boilerplate phrase of our time. I'm gonna,</v>

254
00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:27.330
I'm gonna ask you guys [inaudible] you had personal experience was with Viagara

255
00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:32.310
have, you can't confirm or deny that that was Zac Efron on Conan, but,

256
00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:34.380
but on a much more serious note,

257
00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:40.620
since that initial Glomar response in 1975 more and more government agencies

258
00:15:40.621 --> 00:15:44.280
have begun to use it surprisingly, and not the obvious ones.

259
00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:48.060
We found some from the Department of Commerce, Department of the Treasury,

260
00:15:48.090 --> 00:15:51.390
Department of Energy. It makes you wonder how they got along before then,

261
00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:52.830
centers for disease control.

262
00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:56.100
I was amazed at this thing has legs and it makes you wonder,

263
00:15:56.310 --> 00:16:01.140
why does this thing have legs? Why now? It is weird.

264
00:16:01.141 --> 00:16:06.090
Like that guy, that Propublica guy you, you started with Jeff Larson. Yeah,

265
00:16:06.091 --> 00:16:09.450
that guy. All he's asking is what do you know about who I'd call?

266
00:16:09.451 --> 00:16:12.120
And the only answer he's expecting to get is like, well, you know,

267
00:16:12.121 --> 00:16:15.450
you call your wife, why would they Glomar that?

268
00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:20.480
Well they told them in that letter that if they confirm or deny the existence or

269
00:16:20.491 --> 00:16:22.710
nonexistence of those records,

270
00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:26.250
it would help are the average areas of the United States.

271
00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:30.870
And just just show that I can empathize with the United States of America for a

272
00:16:30.871 --> 00:16:32.850
moment. Why would that be right?

273
00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:36.600
Like if they said you called your wife on Monday at three o'clock,

274
00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:39.900
Thursday at four 30, she called you back at six 15,

275
00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:43.830
what would an enemy then learn? You spoke, I guess that they,

276
00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:46.570
they would learn that, um,

277
00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:49.110
they have records of me calling my wife.

278
00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:52.160
So the statutory reason why I'm,

279
00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:56.760
I've read that your sort of foyas are denied with a Glomar request. Is that,

280
00:16:57.270 --> 00:17:02.100
um, if you say someone is under surveillance by acknowledging records or you say

281
00:17:02.101 --> 00:17:06.210
they're not under surveillance by acknowledging no records, either way,

282
00:17:06.211 --> 00:17:08.940
it outlines the contour of the program.

283
00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:13.940
It's a tiny crack through which people can sort of puncture the wall and get

284
00:17:14.131 --> 00:17:16.420
information about the larger program you go,

285
00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:19.770
you've just given us the government's position. That makes perfect sense to me.

286
00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:22.590
I mean, look, if a thief were to come up and say to me, I'm a cop,

287
00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:26.850
are you investigating me? If I say yes, then he can hide. If I say no,

288
00:17:26.851 --> 00:17:28.560
then he'll go rob another bank, right?

289
00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:32.010
Or the other Roberts will know that I missed a really good bank robber and I'm

290
00:17:32.011 --> 00:17:36.720
terrible at it in any way. I seem like I feel suddenly dangerously exposed.

291
00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:37.890
I don't know. It's all very,

292
00:17:37.891 --> 00:17:41.610
very confusing and you could wrap your brain around it and never get to sleep

293
00:17:41.611 --> 00:17:43.710
for the rest of your life if you thought about it really hard.

294
00:17:46.910 --> 00:17:48.030
And by the way, there is a,

295
00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:52.380
we should say a good argument against that argument from the government that

296
00:17:52.381 --> 00:17:57.320
transparency is a good thing. If you have an agency that uh,

297
00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:01.470
doesn't have any sort of constraints on it or doesn't have the proper oversight,

298
00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:02.400
it oversteps.

299
00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:06.750
And I think that's Dina Temple Rasta in counter terrorism correspondent for NPR.

300
00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:08.790
As Julia was reporting her story,

301
00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:13.260
we ended up calling Dina just to sound her out because she has been glomarred on

302
00:18:13.261 --> 00:18:17.100
drones. She's been glomarred on terrorism investigations. I, I,

303
00:18:17.101 --> 00:18:20.610
I've never actually heard it as being glomarred I have to say.

304
00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:24.600
And she told us something interesting that this whole non denial,

305
00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:29.630
denial state of weirdness has created some very unique situations for her as a

306
00:18:30.511 --> 00:18:33.750
reporter, like say on on any given Monday she sits down,

307
00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:37.650
writes a foyer request about the drone program, which will get glomarred.

308
00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:41.480
Then on Tuesday the government will turn around,

309
00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:44.970
organize a meeting for reporters about the drone program.

310
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:50.000
Let's say a story about a drone target is out and it seems incorrect to the

311
00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:53.760
White House in a big enough way that they feel they need to correct the record.

312
00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:58.290
So they will often conduct a conference call on background with a number of

313
00:18:58.291 --> 00:19:01.980
reporters from a number of different organizations and basically say to those

314
00:19:01.981 --> 00:19:02.970
reporters, okay,

315
00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:06.210
here are the following people who are talking to you but you are not allowed to

316
00:19:06.211 --> 00:19:09.990
say who they are and they're going to put this in context for you.

317
00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:13.650
And you can quote them as, and they usually set the ground rules, you know,

318
00:19:13.651 --> 00:19:17.670
senior administration official or administration official familiar with the

319
00:19:17.671 --> 00:19:19.650
program or something like that.

320
00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:24.270
And what then happens is they get to correct the record without officially

321
00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:26.550
confirming that something is going on.

322
00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:29.980
I mean there's an interesting thing about the White House and government that

323
00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:33.390
they believe that they still have deniability.

324
00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:36.270
If a high ranking official who is unnamed

325
00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:40.460
<v 4>says something is going on and as soon as the name is attached to that,</v>

326
00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:44.120
then the information in their view fundamentally changes.

327
00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:46.340
It suddenly becomes concrete.

328
00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:49.900
And actually that's kind of what happened with the project oriented.

329
00:19:49.901 --> 00:19:53.000
That Glomar mission from the 70s even now,

330
00:19:53.001 --> 00:19:56.780
the only reason that we know half of what we know about this whole thing is

331
00:19:56.781 --> 00:20:01.760
because some historians were really dogged with their foyer requests and they

332
00:20:01.761 --> 00:20:05.870
found out about this whole series of internal CIA newsletters.

333
00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:08.870
And in one of those newsletters, there was a,

334
00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:12.620
an article with a title that clued them in that this was about the Glomar

335
00:20:12.621 --> 00:20:15.470
mission. They foyer that specific article. Oh,

336
00:20:15.471 --> 00:20:17.660
and that's what ultimately sprung loose. Yeah.

337
00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:19.670
When they have a name of an article,

338
00:20:19.671 --> 00:20:23.400
then they can foyer that and then it's really hard for them to say no documents

339
00:20:23.401 --> 00:20:27.480
exist because they have the actual title of it. It gets specific. Yes.

340
00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:31.080
So CIA released this article, but I mean by now,

341
00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:36.740
decades have passed and that's what people now say about the Glomar response is

342
00:20:37.591 --> 00:20:42.300
that it's just a delaying tactic because Congress in 2000 I talked to this one

343
00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:43.410
guy, Jameel Jaffer,

344
00:20:43.411 --> 00:20:47.010
he's the deputy legal director of the ACLU and they get glomarred all the,

345
00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:48.280
we've come to expect

346
00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:51.940
<v 0>them now, unfortunately. He says, you know, I mean, when they get a Glomar,</v>

347
00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:54.490
they don't get upset. They just think, okay,

348
00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:57.340
well we've got another two years in court. That's what it means. It means,

349
00:20:57.341 --> 00:21:00.970
it means you have two years of litigation before you even get to the point of

350
00:21:00.971 --> 00:21:04.330
arguing over whether the government has a right to withhold the information.

351
00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:09.250
W what's happening with this two years? Well, they're trying to strategize.

352
00:21:09.251 --> 00:21:12.580
So if they really want to know about a program and they really want to get those

353
00:21:12.581 --> 00:21:13.414
documents,

354
00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:18.550
they will look for any sort of mention of those documents by public officials in

355
00:21:18.551 --> 00:21:19.420
the same agency.

356
00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:24.910
So say you have a pen and you love this pen,

357
00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:27.460
but you don't want anyone to know about it.

358
00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:30.690
Someone asks you if it exists and you say, hell no. Okay, confirm or deny.

359
00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:34.870
Right? And then you're at a party and you just mentioned it in passing.

360
00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:38.170
You can't help yourself love this pen. She check out this pen, right? Well,

361
00:21:38.171 --> 00:21:41.920
I was nearby. Now I take it to a judge and I say, look,

362
00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:44.860
he's talking about this pen at a party. He's bragging about it.

363
00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:48.400
He can't refuse to confirm or deny its existence anymore.

364
00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:52.420
So they're looking for cracks in the Glomar yeah, over those two years. Yeah.

365
00:21:52.421 --> 00:21:56.590
And it's really expensive legal strategy that most people can't even get to.

366
00:21:57.010 --> 00:21:59.860
Only big outfits like the HCLU can even challenge them.

367
00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:03.130
And the government may ultimately lose in all of these cases,

368
00:22:03.131 --> 00:22:06.730
but it will lose at a time when the public debate will have moved on to

369
00:22:06.731 --> 00:22:09.160
something else. And that's one of the real dangers here.

370
00:22:09.161 --> 00:22:12.820
He says it's that by the time the truth finally comes out

371
00:22:15.050 --> 00:22:15.140
<v 8>[inaudible]</v>

372
00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:17.720
<v 0>we don't actually care anymore. It's ancient history</v>

373
00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:21.100
<v 8>[inaudible]</v>

374
00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:23.380
<v 0>but not for everyone. We'll the divers</v>

375
00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:28.090
who are specially trained going back to that Glomar mission,

376
00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:29.590
the original Glomar mission for a second,

377
00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:34.870
David Sharp says after they were able to pull that last fragment of the sub out

378
00:22:34.871 --> 00:22:38.200
of the water, they were able ultimately to look inside.

379
00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:39.580
And were there people in there?

380
00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:40.980
<v 8>[inaudible]</v>

381
00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:42.990
<v 0>there were, there were, uh,</v>

382
00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:47.850
there were three crew members that were basically a

383
00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:52.530
<v 10>whole and recognizable</v>

384
00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:57.640
and there were major parts of another three crew members,

385
00:22:57.641 --> 00:23:01.600
but they were, they were given the full,

386
00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:07.290
full respect that I think these Soviet Navy would have conferred upon their own

387
00:23:07.511 --> 00:23:10.420
people under those conditions.

388
00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:16.140
The problem was we were keeping the whole thing secret and that allowed the

389
00:23:16.141 --> 00:23:18.180
Soviet government to do the same thing.

390
00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:22.500
They probably didn't want the embarrassment of acknowledging that they'd lost

391
00:23:22.501 --> 00:23:23.910
this really important submarine.

392
00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:27.300
They also didn't want to derail arms talks that we were having with [inaudible].

393
00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:32.740
<v 0>And for a bunch of other reasons, they just pretended it never happened,</v>

394
00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:38.160
but they had to say something to the families of the sailors who died on that

395
00:23:38.441 --> 00:23:40.110
submarine. Isn't that though?

396
00:23:40.250 --> 00:23:45.020
After you [inaudible] here's the widow of the second in command on the k one 29

397
00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:46.490
name is Irina

398
00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:50.600
<v 4>[inaudible]. Yep. And a while ago she was interviewed on Russian television.</v>

399
00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:55.190
She's showing the death certificate for her husband, and then she reads it, not

400
00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:58.730
[inaudible]. I'll translate it as best as I can.

401
00:23:58.850 --> 00:24:03.260
So he did [inaudible] death certificate, but he cheated as smear too.

402
00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:08.350
But he's numb on me or show cause of death. Presumed dead. What?

403
00:24:09.530 --> 00:24:13.540
This [inaudible]. CDM.

404
00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:18.620
Horrible. Inhumane death certificate. Yeah. But if she needs, after

405
00:24:21.890 --> 00:24:24.920
[inaudible] cover the Columbian, I don't know who is the author.

406
00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:28.010
I've wanted to know for 30 years who is the author of this horrible,

407
00:24:28.011 --> 00:24:31.760
inhumane document. If I would say to him, the commander Muslim treats it clear,

408
00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:35.960
this is what we've been living with for 30 years. They wrote cause of death,

409
00:24:35.961 --> 00:24:40.610
presumed dead on the death certificate. Yeah. Doesn't even make any sense.

410
00:24:40.670 --> 00:24:43.970
And that that's cruel. Yeah. In this context, it's cruelty.

411
00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:50.480
<v 10>Uh, that's what she's saying. Giving an answer that says nothing</v>

412
00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:54.140
can be worse than just silence.
