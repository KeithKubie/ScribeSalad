This is your weekly update
on the coolest developer

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:08.010
news from Google.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.610
We recently launched a brand
new free e-learning platform

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.440
to help you understand
the best practices

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.630
and Play Console features
to grow your audience,

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.240
understand performance metrics,
increase revenue, and more.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.690

00:00:23.296 --> 00:00:25.620
The Firebase Summit happened
this week in Prague,

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.570
and the team announced
the Firebase Management

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.600
API, enhanced face
detection with ML Kit,

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.000
local emulators for Cloud
Firestore and the Real Time

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.022
Database, and a whole lot more.

00:00:35.022 --> 00:00:37.230
For all the updates and a
link to the session videos,

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.440
head on over to the post.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.390
We recently introduced the Cloud
Key Management Service secrets

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.700
engine for the
HashiCorp Vault. Which

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.320
means, if you're
a Vault user, you

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.620
can now manage Cloud KMS keys,
encrypt and decrypt data,

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.550
and sign and verify data
using a familiar Vault API.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.770
For more details and
some example commands,

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.730
take a look at the post.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.660
You can now use Google Cloud
DNS as the authoritative name

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.090
server to resolve your
domains on the internet

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.180
through public DNS zones,
and use private DNS zones

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.190
to perform internal
DNS resolutions

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.280
for your private GCP networks.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.650

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.590

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.670
There are a whole bunch of
new updates in Chrome 71 Beta,

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.730
including relative time
formats, the persistent storage

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.150
property for the permission
API, async touchpad pinch zoom

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.570
events, and more.

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.630

00:01:36.155 --> 00:01:37.950

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.640

thumbs up to two thumbs up.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.434
