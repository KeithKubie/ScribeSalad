00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.302
According
to the<i> American Tribune,</i>

00:00:03.335 --> 00:00:05.738
Green Party candidate and
president-no-so-elect Jill Stein

00:00:05.771 --> 00:00:07.440
has been arrested
for embezzling funds

00:00:07.473 --> 00:00:09.008
from her election recount money

00:00:09.041 --> 00:00:11.344
to throw a massive
marijuana-themed party

00:00:11.377 --> 00:00:13.913
-in California, which is Spanish
for "marijuana." -(laughter)

00:00:13.946 --> 00:00:16.382
Her guest list allegedly
included some of the quote,

00:00:16.415 --> 00:00:18.384
"richest liberals
in Los Angeles,"

00:00:18.417 --> 00:00:20.219
also know
as the<i> @midnight</i> writers.

00:00:20.252 --> 00:00:21.554
-No.
-(laughter)

00:00:21.587 --> 00:00:22.989
So, comedians,
what are some things

00:00:23.022 --> 00:00:25.992
you might overhear
at Jill Stein's pot party?

00:00:26.025 --> 00:00:28.061
(laughter)

00:00:28.094 --> 00:00:30.363
Never had someone buzz in
for someone else before.

00:00:30.396 --> 00:00:34.333
-Kristen Schaal.
-Thank you so much.

00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:36.936
Uh, I need to get higher
so that I can forget

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:39.906
that a toke for Stein
is a toke for Trump!

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:41.874
-HARDWICK: All right.
-(laughter)

00:00:41.907 --> 00:00:44.177
-Points for that. Rich Fulcher.
-(applause and cheering)

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.781
Uh, which one is Jill Stein?

00:00:48.814 --> 00:00:51.951
-(laughter, applause &amp; cheering)
-Points.

00:00:51.984 --> 00:00:54.454
-Noah Fielding.
-I like how Rich's stoned voice

00:00:54.487 --> 00:00:55.788
is the same as his normal voice.

00:00:55.821 --> 00:00:57.056
It's the same
as his regular voice.

00:00:57.089 --> 00:00:59.292
-Shut up! Just shut up!
-Oh, my God.

00:00:59.325 --> 00:01:01.694
That scene was... That scene was
just called "Rich Fulcher..."

00:01:01.727 --> 00:01:04.197
I knew you'd embarrass me.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:05.731
HARDWICK: That scene was just
called "Rich Fulcher

00:01:05.764 --> 00:01:08.601
-at Jill Stein's pot party,"
though... -(laughter)

00:01:08.634 --> 00:01:10.403
-Even though they've both been,
do I still need to buzz? -Yeah.

00:01:10.436 --> 00:01:11.938
-You can, or you don't have to?
-Yeah?

00:01:11.971 --> 00:01:14.407
Oh, (bleep).

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.142
-I'm gonna do an impression
of Rich Fulcher. -Please.

00:01:16.175 --> 00:01:19.045
(slowly, in strained voice): "I
hope Donald Trump gets in there.

00:01:19.078 --> 00:01:21.944
Then we can fashion a bong out
of his hair."
