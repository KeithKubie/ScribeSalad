00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.980
So, what else is happening?

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.580
Well, when I said Britain was all alone,

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:16.940
that wasn't entirely true.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.500
Many commonwealth nations and other allied colonies

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.960
had joined the war in Britain's support.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.780
They would play a key role throughout the war.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.340
Particularly in the African, and Italian Campaigns

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.680
On the Axis side,

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.200
Germany, Italy and Japan

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.720
signed the defensive Tripartite Pact, (Axis Powers)

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.880
bringing their military alliance even closer together.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.180
The Soviet Union's war against Finland (Winter War) should have been an easy victory,

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.100
but it became a humiliating struggle,

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.360
and their military ineptitude was put on full display.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.420
In the end, they did force the Fins to sue for peace.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.860
Then, they continued their honourable campaign of pushing around much smaller countries

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.220
by annexing the Baltic States,

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.300
and part of northern Romania.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.920
France's colonies in Equatorial Africa were like, 'Heck no! We're not going to join the Germans!'

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.020
and they all pledged their alliegance to Free France.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.780
Except for Gabon, which had to be taken by military force.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.360
The Allies also tried to capture the strategic port of Dakar,

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.760
but that ended in failure.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.720
Mussolini had seen Hitler's successes,

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.860
and he thought now it was Italy's time to shine.

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.580
So he tried to take British Somaliland,

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:07.460
and that went pretty well.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:08.740
Then he tried to take Egypt,

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:09.840
and that went less well.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.020
Then he tried to take Greece,

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.500
and that went really badly.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.280
Churchill began referring to Italy as 'Europe's Soft Underbelly'.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.500
"OHHHHHH"

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.060
He began favouring a military campaign from the south,

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.760
and started sending British troops to Greece.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.540
All of this had Hitler pretty concerned,

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.300
and he moved to protect his southern flank.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.640
He had been getting friendly with Hungary,

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.760
and had twisted their arm into signing the Tripartite Pact,

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:30.940
and joining the Axis powers.

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.820
Romania was also eager to join for protection against the Soviet Union.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.060
The Tripartite Pact was designed to stop any other countries from joining the Allies.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.260
Specifically, Britain's old ally the pesky United States of America.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.900
When the war first broke out, American public opinion was strongly against joining in.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.760
In 1940, there was an election.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.340
The Republican candidate said, 'I will not send any young Americans to die in Europe.'

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.340
And sitting President Franklin D. Roosevelt said, 'I will also not send any young Americans to die in Europe.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:56.360
Unless I have to.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.220
Then I might.'

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:58.300
And Roosevelt won.

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.560
Churchill asked him to join the war,

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:00.260
but Roosevelt said,

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:01.280
'No can do, Winston.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.040
But you know what?

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.360
Here, have some weapons.'

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.220
America began supplying the Allies with food and munitions,

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:07.340
but there was one problem.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.240
German u-boats were sinking thousands of Allied supply ships in the Atlantic,

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.620
including American ones.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.740
If the Germans could sever Britain's supply line,

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:15.840
the UK would starve.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.840
Throughout the war, the Allies had to come up with better technology to fight the u-boats.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:19.660
Improved radar,

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:20.880
aircrafts with longer range,

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.440
better weaponry and convoy tactics,

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.520
at one point, a man even called a meeting and said, 'Pykrete.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.160
You take some wood. You take some ice.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.080
You put them together.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.900
You get pykrete.'

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.100
And then he pulled out a gun and shot some wood and it shattered,

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.640
and then he shot some pykrete and the bullet ricotcheted off and hit someone else in the conference room.

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:35.740
[applause]

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.720
And then they tried to make a pykrete aircraft carrier,

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:38.860
but that idea was scrapped

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.260
because that's a really dumb idea.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.560
In the end, Alan Turing and his team of code-breakers

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.760
cracked Germany's enigma code

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.280
and the u-boats gradually became less and less of a threat.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.120
Back in Africa,

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.880
Britain decided to push Italy out of Egypt.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.160
'Hey, that was pretty easy!'

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.120
So they kept going.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.180
Hitler realised he was going to have to finally step in and do something.

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.220
He went to Bulgaria and Yugoslavia and said,

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.300
'Hey. I'm going to move troops through you to get to Greece,

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.980
so either join us, or, you know, be invaded.'

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.260
Bulgaria opted to join them.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.040
Yugoslavia opted to be invaded.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.020
Then Greece finally fell to the joint German-Italian invasion.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.640
The British had moved troops from North Africa to fight in Greece,

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.580
which helped Rommel and his tank divisions push the British back to Egypt.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:13.740
And they could have kept going,

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.720
but a small, mostly Australian force

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.680
held out under siege for 8 months in Tobruk,

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.900
denying the Germans a strategic port city and disrupting their supply line.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.920
Despite having some success in the Middle East,

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.900
the British didn't seem like any real threat for now.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.400
'Hey. Soviet Union.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:27.440
Look out.'

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.060
With 3 million troops, Hitler launched the largest ground invasion in history, (Operation Barbarossa)

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.780
and Stalin was far from ready.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.500
Both Churchill and Roosevelt had warned him of an impending attack,

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.340
but he dug his head in the sand and the Soviets didn't stand a chance.

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.120
Germany made staggering progress,

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.100
with huge encircling movements capturing mind-boggling numbers of Russian troops.

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.100
A quarter million at Bialystok-Minsk,

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:48.980
300,000 at Smolensk,

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.000
nearly 700,000 at Kiev,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.580
and again at Vyazma and Bryansk.

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.540
Leningrad was put under a siege that would last an insufferable four years.

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.420
The invasion of Russia had been Hitler's main ideological goal from the beginning,

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.220
and his hatred for the ethnic peoples there was now unleashed

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.240
in all its fury.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.260
The Eastern Front of the Second World War

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.340
was brutal for all that endured it.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.140
The Germans were now inside of Moscow,

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.860
and that's it, it's all over.

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.360
But then, it happened.

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:14.380
It got cold.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.140
Stupid cold.

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.460
Hitler had hoped the Soviets would give up before winter, but they kept fighting.

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:23.220
His commanders came to him and said, 'Can we please dig in for the winter and wait until spring?'

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.460
'No. Keep going.'

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.700
'But oil is literally freezing inside our vehicles.'

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.100
'That's fine. Keep going.'

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.000
'We're having to leave the corpses of our frozen horses by the side of the road

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.460
so we can still find our way in the snowdrift.'

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.500
'Perfectly normal. Keep going.'

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.300
Hitler hadn't given his millions of men winter clothing and supplies,

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:38.960
because he thought he really should have won by now.

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.540
Then, Stalin called in troops from the Siberian front,

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.720
specially trained to fight in the extreme cold,

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.240
and the Germans were no match.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.840
They were now being pushed back.

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.440
They had no choice but to dig in and wait for winter to end.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.920
Germany's victories were staggering,

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.160
and Japan was eager not to miss the victory bus.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.280
Their war in China had come to a standstill,

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.200
but they wanted to keep expending their sphere of influence and getting those sweet, sweet raw materials.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.580
They began making plans to expand southward, (Nanshin-Ron Doctrine)

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:03.460
but there was a problem.

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.620
South-East Asia was heavily colonised by America and Great Britain.

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:07.920
It was also full of ocean.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.400
Ocean meant naval combat,

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.220
and there was no way the Japanese navy could stand up to the US and the UK.

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.300
So they thought, 'Wouldn't it be nice if we could destroy their navies before we begin our conquest?'

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:18.600
And so it was.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.280
On December 7th 1941,

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.900
the Japanese launched a surprise air raid on the US Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor,

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:25.720
and inflicted a huge amount of damage.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.120
They also attacked British colonies in South-East Asia.

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.980
Roosevelt had no choice but to declare war on Japan,

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:32.080
and so did Churchill.

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.600
Hitler then declared war on America,

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.300
even though he totally didn't have to.

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.020
The attack on Pearl Harbor seemed like a big Japanese victory,

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.220
but they didn't attack any of the naval repair yards,

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.160
fuel storage tanks, or the submarine base.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.940
Meaning the Pacific Fleet would be up and running again pretty soon.

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:47.680
In the meantime though, the Japanese were able to begin their conquest.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.320
They took Guam, the Gilbert Islands,

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:50.120
Wake Island,

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.500
Hong Kong and the Philippines,

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.460
they forced Thailand to join them so they could march their troops through to Malaya,

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:55.540
they swept through Singapore,

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:56.320
North Borneo,

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:57.240
the East Indies,

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:57.840
New Guinea,

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:58.600
the Solomons,

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.540
and they were now threatening northern Australia, (Bombing of Darwin)

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:01.640
and the borders of India.

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.060
Japan's victory had been as staggering as the Germans',

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:08.100
and it reinforced the Japanese idea that this was a divine war which they were destined to win.

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:09.840
But their victories had been based on speed,

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:10.560
not power.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.680
And power would eventually catch up with them.

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.040
For now though, in all occupied nations,

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.360
the people suffered.

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:22.020
Persecution, forced labour, harsh punishments for any who spoke out against their occupiers.

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.660
In Europe, the Nazis were rounding up ethnic minorities

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:26.940
and other unwanted groups and individuals.

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:27.780
In particular,

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:31.700
millions of Jewish people would suffer through the terrible events of the Holocaust.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.420
Brave resistance movements rose up in defiance of their invaders,

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:37.120
while the people held out for hope.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:38.760
And hope was coming.

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:42.140
Winter was over, and Hitler could continue his push eastward.

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:44.100
But this time, he switched up his strategy.

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:45.660
He wanted to focus on the south.

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:47.860
His plan was to cut off the Russian armies in the Caucasus,

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:49.120
an area full of oil,

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.480
and then invade the Caucasus,

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:51.280
and take all the oil.

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:54.480
His forces moved across the north with ease, and Hitler got cocky.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:57.040
He rerouted the 4th Panzer Army south early,

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.920
leaving the 6th Army to complete the encircling movement alone.

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:03.380
To do so, the 6th army had to reach and take the key Soviet city

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:04.220
of Stalingrad.

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:06.040
The Russians defended it fiercely,

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:09.340
and Stalingrad saw some of the harshest fighting of the entire war.

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:11.540
The Soviets held up the German advance for five months,

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:13.180
as they battled in the war-torn city,

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:14.620
which bought them valuable time.

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:17.060
When the Germans had first launched their invasion a year earlier,

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:18.980
the Soviets had moved their factories to the east.

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:21.960
Those factories had been building a butt ton of tons and aircraft,

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:23.760
and getting the Soviet army up to scratch.

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:24.360
Now,

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:25.280
it was ready.

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.940
Stalin gathered his new and improved forces around the city,

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:31.000
and in an attack that resembled Hitler's own encirclement tactics,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.640
they began surrounding the 6th army.

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:34.680
Hitler's commanders came to him and said,

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:35.180
'Hey.

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:36.300
Maybe we should retreat.'

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:37.020
But Hitler said,

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:37.640
'No, no.

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:38.520
You stay.'

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:45.460
The entire 6th army was trapped and had to surrender.

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:47.180
With complete air superiority,

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:49.120
the Soviets started pushing westward.

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.220
For Stalin, it was a resounding victory.

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:53.300
For Hitler, an absolute catastrophe.

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.940
Things also weren't looking too good for Hitler elsewhere.

00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:57.260
With America now in the war,

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.220
Allied bombing over German cities reached devastating levels.

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:02.440
In Africa, the British had pushed Rommel back again,

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.080
then they were pushed back again,

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:06.520
then finally, after a decisive battle at El Alamein,

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:08.860
and with American and British troops arriving in the west,

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:11.080
the Germans and Italians were squeezed out of Africa.

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:14.120
Japan was also seeing its rapid success being turned around.

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.760
They attempted to take the island of Midway,

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:17.720
but the US Navy was ready of the attack,

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:19.020
and they sank Japan's carrier.

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:20.500
Actually, they sank a lot of them.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:23.420
It was a battle from which the Japanese Navy would never recover.

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:27.020
British and Chinese troops held the line in the harsh jungle terrain of Burma,

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:30.160
and the Japanese suffered losses in the Solomon Islands and New Guinea.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.300
They began to realise they were not invincible.

00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:33.720
With the Axis out of Africa,

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:35.380
the Allies had to decide their next move.

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:37.260
Churchill still wanted to attack from the south,

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:40.240
while the Americans preferred a full sea invasion in northern France.

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.320
'Alright,' said the Americans. 'We'll do it your way.'

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:44.620
Allied forces successfully landed in Sicily,

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:45.700
and began moving north.

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:47.500
They also carried out bombing raids over Rome.

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:48.180
The thing was,

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:50.820
many of the people in Sicily had relatives living in America,

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:52.820
and they greeted the American troops quite warmly.

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:54.620
With the war reaching home territory,

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:56.620
most Italians just weren't that into it,

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:58.920
and Mussolini was suddenly very unpopular.

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:02.360
He was voted out from his own fascist grand council and was toppled from power.

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.960
Italy immediately began negotiations for surrender.

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:08.400
Hitler wasn't surprised, and had already sent reinforcements southward.

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:11.100
In an operation he ironically called Operation Axis,

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:13.340
German troops quickly disarmed Italian troops in the north.

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:15.580
The Allies continued fighting the Germans up through Italy,

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:16.620
but then winter set in,

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:18.920
meaning mud, and everything slowed to a halt.

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:21.880
'Alright,' said the Americans. 'Let's do it our way as well.'

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:23.880
Germany had made itself a lot of enemies,

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:26.100
and millions of Allied troops had been gathering in England

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:27.460
as factories worked around the clock

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:29.820
producing the war material needed for a super crazy massive

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:32.060
the likes of which the world has never seen before invasion of Europe.

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:34.320
The Germans new an Allied invasion would come,

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.580
but they didn't know where it would land.

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:37.300
Thanks to Allied deception tactics,

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:39.520
they thought there was a pretty good chance it would come at Calais.

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:41.380
But the Allies were really going to land in Normandy,

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:42.540
because it was less fortified

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:43.820
and the beaches were nicer.

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:46.160
Under the careful planning of General Dwight D. Eisenhower,

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:49.240
the invasion that had been long in the making was just about ready to go.

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:50.960
Just one thing was preventing the launch.

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:51.760
The British weather.

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:54.320
For a short while, everyone sat around waiting for a decent day.

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:55.600
And then, it came.

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:56.900
On the night of June 5th,

00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:59.680
over a thousand bombers took off and raided coastline defences,

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:02.680
while paratroopers were dropped inland in a bit of a chaotic operation,

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:04.280
tasked with sabotaging defences

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:06.960
and capturing key bridges to stop any German reinforcements

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:07.900
from reaching the beaches.

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:08.960
Early the next morning,

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:09.760
the barrage came,

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.620
as Allied ships fired a huge number of shells

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:12.920
at the German fortifications.

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:13.940
And then, the landings.

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:15.480
The Americans at Utah and Omaha,

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:16.780
the British at Gold and Sword,

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:18.140
and the Canadians at Juno.

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:20.480
It was a tremendous struggle with a great loss of life,

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.020
particularly at Omaha,

00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:23.720
but the Allied troops captured the beaches

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:25.140
and the landings were a success.

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:26.720
Then they began their movements inland.

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.040
They took the port of Cherbourg,

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:29.040
and the city of Caen.

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.940
The Americans moved south to capture Brittany.

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:33.200
Then, in a massive disaster for the Germans,

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:36.080
British and Canadian troops from the north and Americans from the south

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:37.400
trapped the German 7th Army

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:39.100
in a near-wipeout encircle movement.

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:42.400
In August, Allied troops landed in the south of France to little resistance.

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:45.200
On one beach, all they found was a French man handing out champagne.

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:46.340
Paris was liberated,

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:47.920
and the Germans were pushed out of France

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:49.140
as the Allies entered Belgium.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:50.300
In the far east,

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:52.420
the Allies started to push the Japanese out of Burma,

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:55.280
as the Americans launched a two-pronged offensive in the Pacific.

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:55.980
In the south,

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:58.480
General MacArthur lead the push to liberate the Philippines,

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:01.480
while General Nimitz oversaw the brutal island-hopping campaign.

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:04.800
American forces had to make hard-fought landing after hard-fought landing

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:06.700
on fiercely defended small islands,

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:09.360
as they moved steadily towards the Japanese mainland.

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:11.820
The Japanese believed that the greatest thing a person could do

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:12.980
was to die in battle.

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:14.220
And the most dishonourable act

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:15.200
was to surrender.

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:18.100
As a result, they fought ferociously to the very end.

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:19.860
And the closer the Americans got to the mainland,

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:21.820
the more ferocious the resistance became.

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:23.240
In February 1945,

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:25.200
the Americans captured the island of Iwo Jima,

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:28.560
and an intense fire-bombing campaign of Japan's wooden cities began.

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:30.440
The Allies suffered some setbacks

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:31.620
trying to liberate the Netherlands.

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:33.020
But they were making progress,

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:35.700
and were now threatening the industrial heartland of Germany.

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:38.080
Hitler's health, both mentally and physically

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:39.540
was rapidly deteriorating.

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:41.300
Things were looking bad, and he was desperate.

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:42.920
He said, 'We need to turn this thing around.

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:44.060
And I have just the trick.

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:46.640
Remember a few years back when we Blitzkrieged through the Ardennes

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:47.980
and trapped the Allied forces in Belgium?

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:49.720
Well I'm going to do the exact same thing.

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:51.020
Again.'

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:52.400
He gathered his forces,

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:54.140
and tried to pound them through the Ardennes.

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:56.020
He used up the remainder of Germany's strength

00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:56.600
and resources,

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:58.420
and he managed to create quite a nice bulge.

00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:01.520
He also trapped some American forces in the Belgian town of Bastogne.

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:03.280
The Germans sent the trapped Americans a message,

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:05.260
saying, 'Surrender or be annihilated.'

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:06.860
When it was read out to the commanding officer,

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:07.360
he said,

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:08.560
'They want to surrender?'

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:10.480
'No sir, they want us to surrender.'

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:11.760
'Nuts!'

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:13.840
And that's what they sent off as their official reply.

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:15.140
General Patton's 3rd Army

00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:17.040
then managed to break the siege from the south-west,

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:18.460
and the Germans were pushed back.

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:20.360
Hitler's last-ditch attempt had failed,

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:22.920
and what followed was a total collapse of the German forces.

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:24.980
The Allies pushed into Germany from both sides.

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:26.420
The Soviet Union took Warsaw,

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:27.580
and kept pushing to Berlin.

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:30.400
In his bunker, Hitler realised all hope was lost.

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:31.360
Berlin fell,

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:33.980
and with it, Hitler's dreams of a great German empire.

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:35.980
Two of the Axis nations had been knocked out -

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:36.820
one to go.

00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:39.000
The Americans began their assault on Okinawa,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.640
the last island before they would reach the Japanese mainland.

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:43.400
The desperate Japanese fought hard,

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:45.560
launching kamikaze attacks on the US ships.

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:48.400
The citizens of Okinawa suffered through the terrible fighting,

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.380
but in two months, the island was captured.

00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:51.940
The Allies now had to make a choice.

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:55.100
Either continue the devastating struggle up the Japanese mainland, (Operation Downfall)

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:58.120
or they could try to coerce the Japanese into surrendering now.

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:01.560
In July, the first successful atomic bomb test took place in New Mexico,

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:03.600
and the destructive weapon was ready for use.

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:06.020
America and the UK were also seeing the Soviet Union

00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:08.880
not so much liberating as occupying its captured territory,

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:10.940
and so they wanted to put on a show of force.

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:11.980
On August 6th,

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:13.680
the A-bomb fell on Hiroshima.

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:15.380
Then, on the 9th,

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:16.640
Nagasaki.

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:20.600
The cities were reduced to rubble,

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:22.100
and for the people living there,

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:23.460
it was a terrible fate.

00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:24.340
But for the Allies,

00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:25.860
it achieved their main aim.

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:26.800
In September,

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:28.600
the Emperor announced Japan's surrender,

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:32.660
saying, 'The war situation has developed not necessarily to Japan's advantage.'

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:33.800
After six years,

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:35.500
war was finally over.

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.660
The Allies occupied Japan for eight years.

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:39.420
The Emperor was allowed to keep his position,

00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:42.680
but General MacArthur made sure this picture was printed in the Japanese press,

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:44.840
to display to the Japanese people that their Emperor

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:47.240
was not the divine, powerful being they had believed.

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:49.160
Germany was divided between America,

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:49.940
the UK,

00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:51.280
France, and the Soviet Union.

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:52.320
In 1949,

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:54.580
the Allied sectors were united into West Germany.

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:55.760
The Second World War

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:56.960
had been more terrible

00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:57.780
and destructive

00:13:57.780 --> 00:13:58.600
than the First.

00:13:58.820 --> 00:13:59.960
In its aftermath,

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:01.180
two major superpowers

00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:02.880
with two very different ideologies

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:03.820
had come out victorious.

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:05.320
And the tension between the two of them

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:06.760
would create a new kind of war.

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:09.640
A very, very cold one.

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:11.900
'Wow, Churchill.

00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:13.040
That looks just like me.

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:14.520
