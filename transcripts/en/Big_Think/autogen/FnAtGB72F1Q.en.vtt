what we've learned lately is that there

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179
what we've learned lately is that there
 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.900
what we've learned lately is that there
are 17 triggers for flow these are

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910
are 17 triggers for flow these are
 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.540
are 17 triggers for flow these are
preconditions that bring on more flow

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550
preconditions that bring on more flow
 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.259
preconditions that bring on more flow
and when you strip them all down flow

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269
and when you strip them all down flow
 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.480
and when you strip them all down flow
follows focus right it is a state that

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490
follows focus right it is a state that
 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.250
follows focus right it is a state that
can only show up in the now and the

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260
can only show up in the now and the
 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.260
can only show up in the now and the
present tense so what all these triggers

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270
present tense so what all these triggers
 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.689
present tense so what all these triggers
are our ways of driving our attention

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699
are our ways of driving our attention
 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.460
are our ways of driving our attention
into the now to put it more formally

their lives around these triggers so let

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770
their lives around these triggers so let
 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.740
their lives around these triggers so let
me give you a couple examples there are

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750
me give you a couple examples there are
 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.410
me give you a couple examples there are
three environmental triggers or external

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420
three environmental triggers or external
 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.479
three environmental triggers or external
triggers that precipitate flow the first

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489
triggers that precipitate flow the first
 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:51.889
triggers that precipitate flow the first
to them is most obvious its high

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899
to them is most obvious its high
 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.200
to them is most obvious its high
consequences when there's a lot of risk

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210
consequences when there's a lot of risk
 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.119
consequences when there's a lot of risk
in the environment we pay more attention

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129
in the environment we pay more attention
 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.090
in the environment we pay more attention
to what's going on this is obvious in

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100
to what's going on this is obvious in
 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.920
to what's going on this is obvious in
action adventure sports which are very

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930
action adventure sports which are very
 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.200
action adventure sports which are very
very high in flow produce a lot of flow

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210
very high in flow produce a lot of flow
 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.359
very high in flow produce a lot of flow
obviously a lot of high consequences in

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369
obviously a lot of high consequences in
 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.800
obviously a lot of high consequences in
action adventure sports I'm going to

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810
action adventure sports I'm going to
 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.990
action adventure sports I'm going to
talk to people who are not athletes who

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000
talk to people who are not athletes who
 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.219
talk to people who are not athletes who
are not interested in this the

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229
are not interested in this the
 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.050
are not interested in this the
interesting thing is you don't need

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060
interesting thing is you don't need
 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.000
interesting thing is you don't need
physical risk you do need risk because

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010
physical risk you do need risk because
 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.980
physical risk you do need risk because
it focuses attention but you can replace

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990
it focuses attention but you can replace
 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.020
it focuses attention but you can replace
the physical risk with emotional risk

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030
the physical risk with emotional risk
 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.120
the physical risk with emotional risk
intellectual risk creative risk social

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130
intellectual risk creative risk social
 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.609

because the brain cannot tell the
 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.080
because the brain cannot tell the
difference between social fear and

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090
difference between social fear and
 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.179
difference between social fear and
social pain and physical fear and

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189
social pain and physical fear and
 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.130
social pain and physical fear and
physical pain the processed in the exact
