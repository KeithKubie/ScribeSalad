00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:00.840
Hey, what's up guys?

00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.660
I'm at the hot springs today with my doer [?] of liquid nitrogen and we got a pool over here

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.180
that's a hundred and four degrees Fahrenheit.

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.420
What does liquid nitrogen do when it hits hot water?

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:10.900
You're about to find out.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.060
Now, this liquid nitrogen is -321° Fahrenheit and the water in these hot springs today is 104° Fahrenheit.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.140
You do the math on that.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.580
This is what happens when you pour liquid nitrogen Into hot water:

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.600
(Children shout and laugh excitedly)

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.720
(Children shout and laugh excitedly)

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.460
Yeah, what's really cool about this is as the nitrogen hits the water it kind of flows over it like a rolling tide.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.360
And that mist you see is actually water vapor

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:52.680
Yeah!

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.220
Check out these beads, these are so cool!

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.220
You can even grab them with your hands.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.320
The thing that I noticed is the water is still incredibly warm and that's because water has got a really high thermal mass.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.420
It takes a lot of energy to cool it down so a little liquid nitrogen is no big deal.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.800
My little buddy Reece-Man wants a turn; what are you going to do right now?

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.000
I'm'll [?] let the nitrogen in!

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.440
All right, let's do it. Let's check it out.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.940
Job. Good job, buddy, good job.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.360
Wow!

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.660
That was amazing, Reece!

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.800
The water is fine!

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.120
What do you think of all this craziness?

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.720
It was great.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:37.560
Feels so good!

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.080
Feels like I'm in a cloud.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.080
It looks like you're in a cloud!

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.880
Well guys, that was super awesome,

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.120
and I'm pretty sure nobody has ever done something like this at these hot springs before.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.500
Super fun to have you along for the ride and I'll be looking for you in the next video.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.520
Talk to you then.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.540
Can you pour liquid nitrogen down water slide while I'm going down?

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.400
Not liquid nitrogen but maybe we can do some dry ice.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.100
Oh yeah, yeah! Yeah, dry ice!

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.020
I can't believe they let us do that!

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.380
(Laughter)
