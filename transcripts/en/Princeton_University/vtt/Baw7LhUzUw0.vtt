I spent a lot of time thinking that things would not get better.

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:18.609 position:69%
I felt very weird, I felt very out of place.

It could've been me killing myself when I was 13.

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:23.570 position:77%
I know what it feels like to be in an environment

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.660 position:98%
that feels oppressive. Throughout middle school I always felt different

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.910 position:89%

You can get to a place where you love yourself, where you feel good about who you are.

Things will get better with every year.

Rodrigo:
It's getting better every day.

Because it does get better.

Walk purposefully to a place -- THE place -- where it will get better, for you.
