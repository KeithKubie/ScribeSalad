00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.920
HUGH THOMPSON: Welcome,
everybody.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.109
Thanks so much for taking
the time to be here.

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:08.800
I'm Hugh Thompson.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.210
BOB SULLIVAN: And I'm
Bob Sullivan.

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:12.810
I've worked for NBC News
for almost 15 years.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:15.140
Most of that time I've spent
writing about technology and

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.620
computer hackers and virus and
the computer underground.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:19.800
So I know a little bit
about this world.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.870
But in this building, I'm kind
of out of my league.

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:23.160
So I'm going to turn
it over right away

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.400
to Doctor Hugh Thompson.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.750
HUGH THOMPSON: Wow, man.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:26.245
Thanks.

00:00:26.245 --> 00:00:28.910
You usually don't show that
kind of deference.

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.890
BOB SULLIVAN: I don't mean it.

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:31.550
HUGH THOMPSON: Oh,
OK, all right.

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.670
That makes me feel better.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.280
This book was a really
great journey for us.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.380
We ended up talking to a lot
of people in a lot of

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:40.880
different diverse fields.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.370
And we'll spend some
time talking

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:43.880
about the plateau effect.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.390
But to begin, I wanted to set
the stage with a personal

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.090
plateau story.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.480
And so I've taught at Columbia
University for about five

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.130
years, computer security.

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:55.740
Many of my students
are at Google.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.170
So if anybody's out
there, hey.

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.940
This happened, wow, I guess,
maybe 10 years ago.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.060
I was on a flight from Las Vegas
to Orlando which is a

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.550
pretty long flight.

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.270
And I brought my laptop there,
expected to get a

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.640
bunch of work done.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.020
Two hours into the flight,
disaster happens, and I run

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.280
out of battery.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.350
And I'm scrambling around,
figuring out what to do.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.200
Luckily, the plane had one
of these in-flight

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.570
entertainment systems.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.440
How many people have ever
flown with one of these

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.000
in-flight--

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.430
all right, yeah, pretty much
everybody has now.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.290
Back then they were
kind of unique.

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.600
And so I pull this thing up.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.560
Oprah's got a terrible
guest on.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.980
Doctor Phil I just can't do.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.290
And, finally, I turn my
attention to the games.

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.230
And these are incredibly
cheesy games.

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.720
I don't know if you've ever
played any of these things.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.080
And one looks strikingly
similar to the classic

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.040
strategy game Tetris but
was called [? Fatris ?]

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.020
I guess for copyright reasons.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.010
So I pull this thing up.

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.270
And I'm playing for a while,
and I'm a pretty advanced

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:02.780
Tetris player.

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.590
I'm sure I'm not alone
in this crowd.

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.080
And so I went to the options
configuration screen which was

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.060
ambitiously worded because
it was only one option.

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.620
And the option was how many
blocks would you like to see

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:19.760
in advance?

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.620
So for anybody's who has played
Tetris, you know the

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.930
more blocks you can see in
advance before they come, you

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.540
can plan because you're waiting
on that big four block

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.450
line to come down.

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.170
So it had a touch screen
control, a plus-minus control

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.260
on the screen.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.090
And I keep hitting plus.

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.550
And the maximum value
that this thing

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.170
would take was four.

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.460
Right.

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.040
So that's the maximum number
of blocks that

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.410
you can see in advance.

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.870
And so I asked the question I'm
sure any of you would have

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.520
asked in a similar circumstance,
what can I do to

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.350
increment this value
beyond four?

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.160
Again, I had an hour
left on the flight.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.920
And so I noticed that there was
a phone console attached

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.840
to this in-flight entertainment
system.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.180
You know you swipe your credit
card and make $23 a minute

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.840
calls to friends and family.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.100
So I picked this thing up and
I see that it's connected to

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.740
this entertainment system.

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.556
So I select the four.

00:03:13.556 --> 00:03:16.210
I kind of hold it down,
it gets highlighted.

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.460
And I try and type in 10.

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.410
Very disappointing, it changed
to one and then it

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:22.340
changed to a 0.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.430
Both of which are
legal values.

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.960
And so then I thought, OK, well,
maybe there's a single

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.330
digit constraint here.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.000
So I tried an eight.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.835
Again, very disappointing.

00:03:30.835 --> 00:03:32.650
It didn't do anything.

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.430
So then I thought OK, one of
the most common errors in

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.470
coding is to be off by one.

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.820
Right?

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.460
So you're meant to write the
code that says this value

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.440
shall be less than five, but you
accidentally write, this

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.600
value shall be less than
or equal to five.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.460
Boundary value testing.

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:53.660
So I put in a five,
and it took it.

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.200
And I'm sitting there, it's the
most excited I think I've

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.160
ever been on a plane.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.360
I go back to the touch screen
control, and I hit plus, and

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.610
it increments to six.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.540
Now my guess is the logic around
the plus control said

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.380
something like if four
do not increment.

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:15.290
Well, it wasn't four.

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:16.140
It was five.

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.660
So it happily went up.

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.339
So I'm sitting there in the
chair, pulse, pulse, pulse,

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:23.750
pulse, pulse, pulse, pulse,
until I get to 127 and pause

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.550
for a moment of reflection.

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:30.190
Now 127 is a number very near
and dear to my heart as I'm

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:31.840
sure it is for many of you.

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.730
It's the upper band of a single
byte signed integer.

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:38.792
And so normal math, and my PhD
is in math so I can attest to

00:04:38.792 --> 00:04:42.580
this, says that 127
plus 1 equals 128.

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:47.510
But sometimes 127 plus 1 equals,
anybody remember?

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:48.800
Negative 128.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.990
Right?

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.710
It will wrap around to the
most negative value.

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.860
So I think about this
for a second and

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.230
consider where I am.

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:56.960
BOB SULLIVAN: 30,000
feet in the air.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:57.820
HUGH THOMPSON: 33,000.

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:58.610
BOB SULLIVAN: Sorry.

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.350
HUGH THOMPSON: Don't
undersell it.

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:05.460
But in the name of science,
I hit plus one more time.

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.170
The screen flashes negative
128 just for a second.

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:12.340
And then, proof, screen
goes black.

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:12.900
Proof.

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.200
Guy's screen next to
me goes black.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.590
The entire plane entertainment
system goes down.

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.110
And I'm sitting like this
in the chair hoping that

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.180
something doesn't go
off to the left.

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.580
Now it's interesting to
think about this.

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.570
And as somebody who's done a lot
of software testing, and

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:33.070
I've written a bunch of books
on secure coding, a book

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:34.680
called "How To Break Software
Security," a

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.860
software testing book.

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.970
That is the first time
that I ever ran

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:40.420
into the plateau effect.

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:44.150
If you sit a tester down and
say, I need you to break this.

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:45.680
I need you to find bugs.

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.230
You find a lot of bugs right
at the beginning.

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:52.340
And then quickly your rate of
bug finding plateaus off.

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:55.690
It turns out that that plateau
curve, like the natural

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:00.270
logarithm, shows up in almost
every area of our lives.

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.350
And that's what the plateau
effect is about.

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:07.411
Why do you sometimes
get more for less?

00:06:07.411 --> 00:06:10.155
BOB SULLIVAN: So I have not
broken any airplane's

00:06:10.155 --> 00:06:11.600
in-flight entertainment
system.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:12.450
HUGH THOMPSON: Good.

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:12.600
Good.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.150
It's like a support meeting.

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.870
BOB SULLIVAN: Yet, yet.

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:15.620
I have an excellent
trainer, though.

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:16.410
HUGH THOMPSON: Don't
do it, man.

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:17.800
I strongly advise against it.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.220
BOB SULLIVAN: So what was the
odds-- somewhere in your brain

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:22.500
you thought, is this
plane going down?

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:23.400
HUGH THOMPSON: Oh,
no it's not.

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:23.900
It wasn't.

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:25.700
I had faith in the--

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:27.980
BOB SULLIVAN: So the point of
the testing story is that,

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:30.220
again, if you keep doing the
same kind of things over and

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:32.710
over again your returns
get less and less.

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:34.280
And we all know those people
who have ever tried to lose

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:38.060
weight or body build are very
familiar with what the concept

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:39.160
of the plateau effect is.

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:40.560
It hits testing.

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.570
It hits people who try learning
to play the piano.

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:43.530
It hits marriages.

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:45.000
It hits businesses.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.120
Things that you do that were
formally effective suddenly

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.860
become less and less
effective.

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:50.910
So in testing, for example,
it's a really good answer.

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:53.040
Testers have come up with a
spectacular answer for this

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.390
which is fuzzing.

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:56.810
So instead of hiring testers,
you hire piano players.

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:58.470
You hire random people
off the street.

00:06:58.470 --> 00:06:59.760
And they do unexpected things.

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:02.030
And those unexpected things are
actually what break you

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:03.000
through this plateau.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.300
But the problem is,
and it's funny--

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:05.800
I just met with an
old colleague.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.130
I can't say who he was, but
he is the head of a very

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:10.060
important news organization.

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:12.030
And we were talking about how
when you stay at the same

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:14.860
place for 20 years or more, it's
a lot more like you're

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:16.470
running on a treadmill
instead of running

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:17.660
out in the real world.

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:19.090
And you can get very, very
good at running on a

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:21.030
treadmill, you can
be the world's

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:22.180
fastest treadmill runner.

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:23.490
But that doesn't mean you're
going to be any good at

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:24.800
running in the real world.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.640
So that's the problem with doing
the same thing over and

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:28.080
over again.

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.946
It ceases to work.

00:07:29.946 --> 00:07:34.090
HUGH THOMPSON: And it's
incredible, this curve, and,

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:37.000
again, you can think of this,
well, natural log

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.070
is similar to this.

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:41.190
But this curve pops
up in almost every

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:43.170
area of human endeavor.

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:45.840
If you're in medicine, for
example, this looks like the

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.540
dose response curve.

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:49.400
The point at which
medicine becomes

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.890
ineffective as doses increase.

00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:54.480
If you look at somebody who's
trying to lose weight, for

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:56.400
example, same thing happens.

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.100
They plateau off.

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:02.700
So this curve, we spent three
years talking to people in

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:07.590
psychology, medicine, venture
capital, folks even as diverse

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:10.720
as cooks and culinary artists,
I didn't realize they were

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:12.300
called artists.

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:17.900
And this same curve shows up
over and over and over again.

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:21.180
So the question that the book
tries to answer is are there

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:24.000
commonalities to plateaus?

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.590
Are there sets of underlying
conditions, causes that are

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:30.950
the same if you're trying to
break a piece of software or

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:33.280
you're trying to lose weight
or you're trying to start a

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:34.830
business or you're trying
to get your

00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:37.200
business to the next level?

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.630
And we spent, like I said, about
three years trying to

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:40.809
answer this question.

00:08:40.809 --> 00:08:42.549
And we found that there
are these eight

00:08:42.549 --> 00:08:46.570
causal factors of plateaus.

00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:50.010
But talk about the book scene
and where it starts.

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:52.190
BOB SULLIVAN: So before we
tell you what the eight

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:54.040
factors are, we want to give you
another example of what a

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:55.740
plateau is like.

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:57.770
I'm sure some of you have spent
some time in your life

00:08:57.770 --> 00:08:59.310
in the Bay Area, here.

00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:00.440
Right?

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:02.590
Have any of you eaten at this
restaurant, The Stinking Rose?

00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:03.630
You all familiar with it?

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:06.740
The Stinking Rose is probably
the most famous garlic

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:08.680
restaurant, maybe even
in the world.

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:08.870
Right?

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:10.530
Everything on the
menu is garlic.

00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:12.010
They have garlic ice cream.

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:16.320
The Stinking Rose, well,
stinks of garlic.

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.800
You can smell it
down the block.

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:22.080
The most overpowering sensory
experience you might have ever

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:25.080
with your nose is walking
into The Stinking Rose.

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:27.010
And you walk in, they sit you
at your table, you sit down,

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:28.590
they hand you a menu.

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:31.190
And what happens to that garlic
smell as you sit there

00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:33.540
looking at the menu?

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:34.895
It disappears.

00:09:34.895 --> 00:09:36.620
It's gone.

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:37.890
Did the garlic all go away?

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:38.140
No.

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:39.570
Your nose just stopped
smelling it.

00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:42.430
Your nose got what's
called acclimated.

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:45.480
Acclimation is a part of
all of our biologies.

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:46.530
It's built into us.

00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:47.940
Our bodies are literally
designed

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:49.810
to ignore the familiar.

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:52.710
So even something as powerful as
a garlic-filled restaurant

00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:55.740
suddenly becomes familiar and
effectively disappears from

00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:56.950
your consciousness.

00:09:56.950 --> 00:09:58.270
That's the power
of acclimation.

00:09:58.270 --> 00:10:00.800
And acclimation is one of the
main causes, one of the first

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.560
causes of a plateau.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:04.730
We get used to things
that are familiar.

00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:08.240
And slowly but surely our
sensory experience of them

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:09.440
disappears.

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:11.990
If you actually plot acclimation
on a graph from

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:14.600
your nasal olfactory nerves,
it follows that

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.110
plateau curve exactly.

00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:18.450
So anyone who's ever experienced
walking into a

00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:20.200
locker room and saying,
oh this is horrible.

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:22.750
And then suddenly
you can bear it.

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:25.500
Then you know precisely what
the plateau is and why your

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:28.270
body is actually working against
you so that whatever

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:30.790
you do every day, you slowly
but surely get

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:32.381
less good at it.

00:10:32.381 --> 00:10:34.720
HUGH THOMPSON: Yeah, thank
goodness for that plateau.

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:37.290
By the way, mention Bob and Hugh
at The Stinking Rose for

00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:38.826
a 10% discount.

00:10:38.826 --> 00:10:40.310
No, just kidding.

00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:41.740
Actually, we should
set that up.

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:42.470
BOB SULLIVAN: That's
a really good idea.

00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:42.800
Marketing.

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:46.460
HUGH THOMPSON: So what is
the plateau effect?

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:49.620
Essentially, it's the law
of diminishing returns.

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:53.050
We get less and less for
applying the same thing over

00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:53.750
and over again.

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:56.080
But it's more than just that.

00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:00.730
I think if you don't know that
the plateau effect exists in a

00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:03.280
particular pursuit,
you give up.

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:04.800
You think that you've
peaked out.

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:05.830
You've topped off.

00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:09.360
It's the maximum amount that you
can ever get out of this

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:10.750
particular endeavor.

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:14.640
I'm just thinking about the
shift in testing that happened

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:18.130
when we went from free form
exploratory testing and

00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:20.780
automated testing
over to fuzzing.

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:22.740
So, of course, we
still do both.

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:26.290
But if you look at most of
the major vulnerabilities

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:29.920
discovered in software today,
they're found by fuzzing.

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:33.890
And fuzzing is like an
amphetamine-laden monkey,

00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:37.230
right, that you just kind of sat
off in front of a keyboard

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:39.810
and hoped for the best
and see what happens.

00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:41.940
It's because systems
are so complex.

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:45.630
It's very difficult sometimes
to reason through the exact

00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:48.250
set of inputs that may
cause it to fail.

00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:51.680
That idea of applying diversity,
or fuzzing, to

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:57.170
other areas of your life has,
we found, applied in things

00:11:57.170 --> 00:12:00.380
like weight loss, things
like muscle building.

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:02.130
I don't know if anybody
here has ever tried

00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:03.970
cross fit, for example.

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:06.900
But the whole premise of cross
fit is based on fuzzing.

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:10.730
Doing different things every
single day to try and get your

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:14.380
body surprised or shocked
into change.

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:17.150
So we mentioned these eight
elements of plateaus.

00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:19.490
We won't have time to go
into all of them today.

00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:20.760
That's what the book is for.

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:22.850
And the book is much longer.

00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:25.500
Or the audio book which
is only eight hours.

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:27.820
So consider that for
your weekend.

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:30.700
It's a denial of weekend
attack--

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:33.270
DOW, DOW.

00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:37.310
Or you can listen to two,
and then it's a DDOW.

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:40.240
But these are the eight
causes that we found.

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:43.370
You see immunity as the
base at the bottom.

00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:45.950
And I think that there's a
threat of immunity that goes

00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:47.050
through all of these.

00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:50.530
We just naturally get used
to certain stimulus.

00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:53.480
And we talked about
immunity already.

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:56.070
We talked about it in
the testing space.

00:12:56.070 --> 00:13:01.690
We found that immunity is such
a common cause of plateaus in

00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:05.500
other areas of our life like
sports, for example.

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:08.515
Still, that Derek Jeter
thing shocks me.

00:13:08.515 --> 00:13:10.980
BOB SULLIVAN: So there's this
great story of Derek Jeter,

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:12.790
who I think most of you
are familiar with.

00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:15.270
He is either the best or the
worst shortstop ever depending

00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:19.600
on what East Coast city
you are from.

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:20.840
I'm not here to argue
that point.

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:21.740
Obviously, he's the best.

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:23.690
HUGH THOMPSON: Worst.

00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:24.290
Terrible.

00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:26.470
BOB SULLIVAN: But one
fascinating thing about his

00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:30.130
career is that at about age 35
even Derek Jeter heard all the

00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:31.920
criticism that he was a
particularly bad defensive

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:34.880
shortstop and specifically very
bad at going to his left.

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:38.040
And he went to this advanced
athletic training institute in

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:41.000
Florida where they identified
the fact that when in baseball

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.700
as a right-handed hitter, you
swing like this roughly about

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:46.450
2 million times by the time
you're a 35 year old shortstop

00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:50.670
for the New York Yankees which
made his left hip lock much

00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:51.630
more quickly than
it should have.

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:54.940
And it cost him about 1/10 of a
second every single time he

00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:56.730
had to make that critical
crossover step

00:13:56.730 --> 00:13:57.740
going to the middle.

00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:00.520
So he worked with a trainer
named Kevin Connolly who

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:02.890
literally made him take
his first steps

00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:03.870
over and over again.

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:05.760
It turned Derek Jeter
into a 2-year-old.

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:08.350
He attached weights to his body
so that he literally had

00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:09.710
to learn from the beginning.

00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:12.020
They deconstructed the way that
he walked and then the

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:13.120
way that he ran.

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:15.520
And the next year, he won a Gold
Glove at shortstop, the

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:16.950
oldest Gold Glove winner
at shortstop

00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:18.390
in the last 50 years.

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:19.820
So that's Derek Jeter's story.

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:21.360
But I'm much more interested in
talking to you about this

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:24.200
graphic here.

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:26.050
The other part of-- my name is
Bob Sullivan so all of you

00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:29.800
should assume that somewhere in
my family lineage I had a

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:31.560
cousin, aunt, uncle,
grandfather, who

00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:32.350
owned an Irish bar.

00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:34.390
In fact, I've had several.

00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:36.270
So I know something
about Irish bars.

00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:38.680
And all of you here have had
this experience, probably the

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:41.280
first month of your freshman
year at college, where you got

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:45.020
very, very drunk on a beer and
a half during orientation.

00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:47.360
And then by the end of the
month, you needed a fifth of

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:50.120
Jack, a 12 pack, and
maybe a couple of

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:51.292
others shots of vodka.

00:14:51.292 --> 00:14:53.240
HUGH THOMPSON: A fifth of
Jack and a 12 pack?

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:53.740
BOB SULLIVAN: Maybe
that's just me.

00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:56.265
HUGH THOMPSON: What college
did you go to?

00:14:56.265 --> 00:14:57.730
Geesh.

00:14:57.730 --> 00:14:59.410
BOB SULLIVAN: We'll discuss
college partying later.

00:14:59.410 --> 00:15:02.110
But immunity is seen
by all of us.

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:05.590
People who are in the hospital
and are there for a long stay

00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:07.550
and have some kind of extensive
surgery, morphine

00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:08.550
dosage goes up and up.

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:10.240
Because our tolerance
goes up an up.

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:12.490
But tolerance is related
to acclimation

00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:13.710
is related to immunity.

00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:16.350
And all of us have experienced
tolerance and acclimation and

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:18.180
immunity when drinking.

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:20.415
So a good thing to keep in mind,
and as we discussed at

00:15:20.415 --> 00:15:23.570
our fine plateau party
last Wednesday--

00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:24.385
HUGH THOMPSON: Ransom
empirical.

00:15:24.385 --> 00:15:27.370
BOB SULLIVAN: If you're slowly
drinking Bud Lights and

00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:31.055
starting to feel that you've
topped out and you're--

00:15:31.055 --> 00:15:32.730
HUGH THOMPSON: If you're slowing
drinking Bud Lights

00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:35.141
you need to leave the party.

00:15:35.141 --> 00:15:36.490
BOB SULLIVAN: Well,
my parties anyway.

00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:39.955
But the best way to break that
plateau is maybe goading one

00:15:39.955 --> 00:15:42.190
of your friends into a shot of
something that breaks through

00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:43.400
your plateau.

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:43.850
But that's--

00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:45.040
HUGH THOMPSON: This is
not the takeaway--

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:46.460
BOB SULLIVAN: Enough
about Irish bars.

00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:47.150
Yes.

00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:48.470
Clearly, that's my role
in our partnership.

00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:52.880
HUGH THOMPSON: The
second element

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:54.510
is the greedy algorithm.

00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:57.140
Anybody here that has ever
studied math has run into the

00:15:57.140 --> 00:15:58.140
greedy algorithm.

00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:03.140
It basically says we take the
locally optimal solution.

00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:06.020
So whenever seems like the place
that we make the most

00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:08.200
progress immediately we take.

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:11.050
And we have a scene in the
book where we talk about,

00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:13.060
because Bob and I have suffered
through this so many

00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:16.440
times, you've got to get
20 blocks in Manhattan,

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:17.670
how do you do it?

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:20.510
Well, somebody who's following
the greedy algorithm says, OK,

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:23.430
look, I probably have to wait
two minutes to flag down a

00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:25.050
cab, and during those
two minutes,

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:26.860
I'm making zero progress.

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:29.810
Or I could go to the subway stop
which might be two blocks

00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:31.130
in the wrong direction.

00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:33.440
In that case, I'm making
negative progress.

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.310
I'm getting further and further
away from where I'm

00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:36.380
supposed to go.

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:39.150
Or if you're following the
greedy algorithm, you just

00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:40.370
start walking.

00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:43.390
Because instantly you're making
immediate progress.

00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:47.570
If somebody looked at you a
minute after you began this

00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:51.950
quest, the person who started
walking towards the goal looks

00:16:51.950 --> 00:16:53.540
like he's made progress.

00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:55.560
He's getting closer.

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:58.220
But everybody who's ever lived
in New York knows that the

00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:02.380
fastest way to get anywhere,
most of the time, well,

00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:04.589
fingers crossed,
is the subway.

00:17:04.589 --> 00:17:07.910
And the subway often requires
you to make something that we

00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:09.829
call retrograde progress.

00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:12.890
Sometimes you have to go in
completely the opposite

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:15.910
direction to make a bigger
leap forward.

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:19.420
It turns out that the greedy
algorithm occurs all the time

00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:20.660
in other areas too.

00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:23.410
In business, we see it
happen all the time.

00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:27.020
Publicly traded companies,
they're subject to 90 day

00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:30.360
windows of performance when
earnings come out.

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:34.400
So if you're a publicly traded
company, you have to follow

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:37.170
the 90 day window greedy
algorithm.

00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:39.770
You have to optimize
for profit.

00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:42.620
You have to optimize for revenue
during that period

00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:46.000
even though that may not be in
the best interest of the long

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.140
term health of the company.

00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:52.330
So this greedy algorithm we
found is a very common reason

00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:53.640
why people reach plateau.

00:17:57.197 --> 00:17:59.520
BOB SULLIVAN: Meanwhile, timing
is also a very, very

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:00.480
important issue.

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:02.820
And timing gets into our lives,
of course, you can

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:04.120
think of comedic timing.

00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:05.220
You can think of a
good time to have

00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:06.120
children in your family.

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:10.300
You can think of a good time to
book some sales so you can

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:11.870
pump up your quarterly
numbers.

00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:14.790
But timing is a really
interesting element.

00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:16.800
This is a really interesting
time for time right now in

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:17.980
human history.

00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:21.180
We spent a lot of time with a
group called the Quantified

00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:22.300
Self Movement in the book.

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:24.900
Has anybody here heard of the
Quantified Self Movement.

00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:26.020
HUGH THOMPSON: Have you ever
been to a meeting?

00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:27.260
Has anybody here ever
been to a meeting?

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:28.010
Just out of curiosity.

00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:28.265
OK.

00:18:28.265 --> 00:18:30.210
BOB SULLIVAN: There are
chapters of Quantified

00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:33.420
Selfers, they are called QSers,
all over the world.

00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:34.990
One of the largest is actually
in New York.

00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:35.390
They are in Brooklyn.

00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:37.110
And so we went to a couple
of their meetings

00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:38.190
and got to know them.

00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:40.820
These are people who watch
what you guys do.

00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:42.240
You guys are counting
everything, observing

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:46.120
everything that we do, big data
about the world, studying

00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:47.920
it, maximizing efficiencies.

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:50.020
And they're doing that
about themselves.

00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:52.880
So these people in the world
of a million little sensors

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:55.550
that are all connected, they
put sensors on their body.

00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:56.960
They put sensors
on their wrist.

00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:58.570
And they count how many breaths
they take during the

00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:01.390
day, what their heart rate is
every five seconds or over the

00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:02.640
course of an entire day.

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:04.470
They plot their oxygen intake.

00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:07.150
And then they measure that
against things like what kind

00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:08.070
of a mood am I in?

00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:09.280
How well did I run?

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:11.520
A lot of them are performance
related.

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:12.900
A lot of them are runners
in particular.

00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:15.220
And if you talk to any of them,
they will tell you, I

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:17.520
know that the best time for me
to start a five mile run is

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:20.060
exactly at 7:37 in the
morning when it's

00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:22.670
between 60 and 65 degrees.

00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:26.320
Now, a lot of this feels like
they're just enhancing their

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:28.670
own OCD tendencies.

00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:30.650
HUGH THOMPSON: They were in
better shape than we were.

00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:31.350
BOB SULLIVAN: They were
in much better shape.

00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:32.850
It was a very intimidating
room to be in.

00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:33.610
Let me tell you.

00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:33.935
Yeah

00:19:33.935 --> 00:19:36.565
HUGH THOMPSON: It's
on a high bar.

00:19:36.565 --> 00:19:39.950
BOB SULLIVAN: But this might
seem extreme right now.

00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:41.610
But a lot of this is becoming
more and more popular.

00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:44.690
There's a whole technology now
called slumber tech where

00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:47.310
people are attaching devices to
themselves and doing what

00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:49.400
only high-end hospitals used
to do, which is seeing what

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:50.300
kind of a sleep am I getting.

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:51.990
How much REM sleep
am I getting?

00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:54.870
You attach something to your
wrist, or you wear a shirt

00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:56.470
that attaches to an iPhone.

00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:58.450
It downloads to a website which
then in a week or two

00:19:58.450 --> 00:20:00.540
analyzes whether or not you
need to sleep more.

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:05.060
So we are actually starting
to get a grasp on time and

00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:06.710
figuring out is this
a good time or a

00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:08.200
bad time to do things?

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:11.890
Now, timing, of course, has been
this human quest forever.

00:20:11.890 --> 00:20:14.500
But a lot of people have
studied time in these

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:16.370
incredibly detailed ways.

00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:18.890
And the one that we talk about
a lot in the book, because

00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:21.270
there's a good time and a bad
time for things, is in

00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:22.550
memorization.

00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:24.035
So do you want to talk about
memorization, or do you want

00:20:24.035 --> 00:20:24.800
me to go ahead?

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:25.250
HUGH THOMPSON: Yeah.

00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:25.510
Yeah.

00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:25.850
Sure.

00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:25.905
Go.

00:20:25.905 --> 00:20:26.230
Go.

00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:26.970
BOB SULLIVAN: We can
talk about this.

00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:29.730
And so the Ebbinghaus Spacing
Effect, which maybe some of

00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:33.150
you encountered in your studies,
says basically this,

00:20:33.150 --> 00:20:36.010
ever since we were little kids,
we were told there's one

00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:38.410
way to learn multiplication
tables.

00:20:38.410 --> 00:20:39.690
Beat it into your head.

00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:41.460
Repetition over and
over again.

00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:44.290
And if you went to a modern
school in the last 20 years or

00:20:44.290 --> 00:20:46.300
so they might have said,
repetition is horrible.

00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:47.110
It beats kids up.

00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:47.580
It's no good.

00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:50.580
So there's this rote
memorization, anti-rote

00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:51.480
memorization school.

00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:53.920
And of course both of them are
wrong and ineffective.

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:56.730
But what we have found
and what [? Henrik ?]

00:20:56.730 --> 00:21:01.140
Ebbinghaus found 100 years ago
is that it's not repeating

00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:03.610
something over and over again,
it's when you repeat it.

00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:07.630
So there's this very specific
curve which suggests that

00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:09.450
constant repetition
becomes very, very

00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:10.400
ineffective very quickly.

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:12.330
You could sit down, I'm sure
you've had this experience,

00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:13.570
you meet someone at a party.

00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:14.600
His name is Bob.

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:15.180
His name is Bob.

00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:15.370
His name is Bob.

00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:15.670
I'm going to remember.

00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:17.010
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:17.985
His name is Bob.

00:21:17.985 --> 00:21:19.890
Oh, Hugh, how you doing?

00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:21.430
What was that guy's name?

00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:23.200
It happens constantly, right?

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:26.420
And it's because it's not
effective to repeat it over

00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:27.510
and over again.

00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:30.650
But it turns out, if you start
to forget something and then

00:21:30.650 --> 00:21:34.070
you remind yourself of that, you
pop it up to the surface

00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:34.590
of your memory.

00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:36.500
And then you do it again.

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:37.220
And then you do it again.

00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:39.070
And if you do it at these very
in particular spaced

00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:40.780
repetitions, they are different
for everybody, but

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:42.530
it's something like this.

00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:44.650
two seconds afterwards, 10
seconds afterwards, a minute

00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:46.880
afterwards, five minutes
afterwards, 10 minutes

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:52.030
afterwards, half an hour, two
hours, 12 hours, two days.

00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:53.830
Picture a ball floating
on top of water.

00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:56.630
And just as it's about to sink
below the surface, just as

00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:58.670
you're about to forget
something, pop it back up

00:21:58.670 --> 00:21:59.840
above the surface again.

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:02.040
You do that seven or eight times
in this very particular

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:03.630
sequence, you will
never forget it.

00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:05.840
That's how things are burned
into your brain.

00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:07.640
That's how our brains
are built.

00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:08.680
It's called the Spacing
Effect.

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:09.750
And it's far more efficient.

00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:11.820
You could memorize something
only repeating it 10 or 11

00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:14.640
times instead of 1,000 times,
you might do it in a very

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:16.090
compressed amount of time.

00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:18.230
So that's how you can
hack the code of

00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:20.240
your own brain's timing.

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:22.550
And timing is just one example
of a whole bunch we have in

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:25.990
the book about taking control of
timing, studying timing in

00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:29.150
yourself or your business or
your relationship and figuring

00:22:29.150 --> 00:22:30.760
out when is the best
time to do things.

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:33.990
There a great story in the
book about a parole board

00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:36.830
where someone examined over the
course of the year whether

00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:39.650
or not this parole board was
likely or less likely to grant

00:22:39.650 --> 00:22:43.600
parole to criminals,
to inmates.

00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:46.170
And basically the results were
after lunch when they felt

00:22:46.170 --> 00:22:48.730
like going home, they granted
parole to everybody.

00:22:48.730 --> 00:22:50.720
The last thing in the world you
wanted to be was the first

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:53.200
case they saw in the morning
when everybody was focused and

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:54.700
really hard on the inmates.

00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:57.410
So all the lawyers who figured
this out made sure to schedule

00:22:57.410 --> 00:23:00.050
all of their hearings at the end
of the day, had a massive

00:23:00.050 --> 00:23:01.040
success rate.

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:04.516
So timing is a really critical
factor in success.

00:23:04.516 --> 00:23:06.830
HUGH THOMPSON: I just noticed
that so many of your stories

00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:08.320
start in a bar.

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:10.370
You could have easily said when
you meet somebody at a

00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:10.695
conference.

00:23:10.695 --> 00:23:12.290
BOB SULLIVAN: I am
an Irishman.

00:23:12.290 --> 00:23:14.570
HUGH THOMPSON: It's
just a side note.

00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:19.370
So the next element that we
found in plateaus have to do

00:23:19.370 --> 00:23:20.890
with flow issues.

00:23:20.890 --> 00:23:22.280
And we've got a couple
of different

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:25.120
sections inside flow issues.

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:28.640
One of the biggest causes
of problems with flow is

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:30.230
something called erosion.

00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:34.140
Erosion is where you deplete
a resource over time.

00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:35.800
So I grew up in the Bahamas.

00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:37.160
Born and raised there.

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:39.740
Wonderful place if anybody's
planning a vacation.

00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:41.920
We need your tourist dollars.

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:45.770
But I used to go on a Easter
egg hunt every Easter.

00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:49.710
And it was on this isolated
island just set up for an

00:23:49.710 --> 00:23:50.800
Easter egg hunt.

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:51.760
And it's amazing.

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:55.260
As a 10-year-old, you'd find
half of the eggs that you'd

00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:58.080
find for the entire day in
the first five minutes.

00:23:58.080 --> 00:23:59.220
Because they are plentiful.

00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:00.500
They're everywhere.

00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:04.300
But as more kids start to find
more eggs, your rate of egg

00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:07.620
finding follows this
plateau curve.

00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:11.250
And it's interesting, any time
you're consuming a resource

00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:14.640
that is fixed, you hit
a plateau naturally.

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:18.390
Because they're less and less
of those objects available.

00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:21.730
We also talk a lot about
step functions.

00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:26.080
So step functions are where you
have to make a big leap in

00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:27.140
a resource.

00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:28.950
Think about Cloud for example.

00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:31.480
Cloud has actually
solved the step

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:33.440
function for many companies.

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:37.260
Before, to move from the step of
not being in business on a

00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:39.860
web company to being in
business, you had to buy

00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:40.870
expensive servers.

00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:42.710
You had to house
them somewhere.

00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:45.060
You had to have somebody to
run and maintain them.

00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:48.160
The Cloud lets you take
spin up of VM, and

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:50.090
you're going in seconds.

00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:54.990
And you can incrementally rent
capacity when you need it.

00:24:54.990 --> 00:24:58.490
It turns out that same function
of smoothing things

00:24:58.490 --> 00:25:00.980
is happening in other
areas of our lives.

00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:03.300
It's happening in car
rentals for example.

00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:03.960
Zipcar.

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:06.040
I don't need something
for 24 hours.

00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:07.890
I just need it for an hour.

00:25:07.890 --> 00:25:12.280
And it gets into this bigger
issue of unused capacity.

00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:15.890
What unused capacity do
we have in our lives?

00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:16.910
Maybe you own a car.

00:25:16.910 --> 00:25:20.150
You drive it to work in the
morning at 9:00 AM and then

00:25:20.150 --> 00:25:21.730
you leave at 5:00 PM.

00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:24.860
What's happening to the car
between 9:00 and 5:00?

00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:26.180
It's just sitting there.

00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:29.300
If there was a way that you
could incrementally rent that

00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:33.110
car out to someone else and knew
it would be back at 5:00.

00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:35.170
You had all the right
insurances, all the right

00:25:35.170 --> 00:25:37.540
protection, you trusted
that person.

00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:38.150
You'd do it.

00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:40.530
It's a way to monetize
a fixed asset.

00:25:40.530 --> 00:25:44.270
And we're moving more and more
into this service economy

00:25:44.270 --> 00:25:46.110
where we're getting
out of steps,

00:25:46.110 --> 00:25:49.300
moving into smooth functions.

00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:51.260
Another area is a choke point.

00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:54.240
And a choke point, you can think
of it as the thing that

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:55.530
fails first.

00:25:55.530 --> 00:25:59.510
So not to get too in depth here,
but how many people have

00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:02.160
followed some of the distributed
denial of service

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:05.820
attacks against the financial
services institutions over

00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:07.470
these last 12 months?

00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:09.850
It's interesting to see
how many of these

00:26:09.850 --> 00:26:12.040
DDoS attacks go down.

00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:15.670
Before it just used to be
requests, essentially

00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:17.300
refreshing the page.

00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:20.980
Now a lot of the DDoS attacks
that we're seeing are

00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:22.580
application aware.

00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:25.940
They're actually trying to
stress out say the off system

00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:29.670
on the back end by being aware
of the page, actually entering

00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:32.970
characters into a user name
password field, and then

00:26:32.970 --> 00:26:35.840
causing the off to spin
on the back end

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:37.025
instead of just the refresh.

00:26:37.025 --> 00:26:40.650
And the reason for that is that
back end system that's

00:26:40.650 --> 00:26:43.630
doing the authentication
is the choke point.

00:26:43.630 --> 00:26:46.590
It's the place that's likely
to fail first.

00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:49.610
And we're seeing attackers
become very aware that choke

00:26:49.610 --> 00:26:51.360
points exist in systems.

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:53.760
And instead of going brute
force, they're more

00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:56.830
intelligent about how they
look for failures.

00:26:56.830 --> 00:27:00.270
So I want to talk about a choke
point that I'm sure is

00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:02.980
very near and dear
to your heart.

00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:05.010
And it's the CAPTCHA.

00:27:05.010 --> 00:27:08.270
So CAPTCHAs are a fascinating

00:27:08.270 --> 00:27:11.065
phenomenon of computer science.

00:27:11.065 --> 00:27:14.290
I've known Luis von Ahn for a
long time who was one of the

00:27:14.290 --> 00:27:15.970
creators of the CAPTCHA.

00:27:15.970 --> 00:27:19.280
And to me the CAPTCHA
is a choke point.

00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:21.990
Whenever I have to go into a
site, I get the user name and

00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:24.670
password wrong three or four
times, CAPTCHA comes up.

00:27:24.670 --> 00:27:25.830
I've got to type it in.

00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:29.310
They've gotten so complex now
that most of the time, I can't

00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:32.140
even figure out what they were
and have to go through two or

00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:33.410
three of them.

00:27:33.410 --> 00:27:36.235
But we often think about
CAPTCHAs from our perspective,

00:27:36.235 --> 00:27:39.710
but you never think about the
pain and turmoil this has

00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:43.640
caused for the bad guys, the
emotional disruption.

00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:47.430
So these guys had invested
a fortune in script

00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:50.910
infrastructure that went out and
bought all the tickets at

00:27:50.910 --> 00:27:53.320
Ticketmaster or went
out and created

00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:55.770
50,000 free email accounts.

00:27:55.770 --> 00:27:59.070
And suddenly one day when the
CAPTCHA was introduced, the

00:27:59.070 --> 00:28:00.560
scripts didn't work anymore.

00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:03.080
Because there was a test to
see if this person is a

00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:05.540
computer or are they a person?

00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:09.460
But it's interesting to see how
the security community and

00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:11.840
the hacking community,
in particular,

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:13.700
responded to CAPTCHAs.

00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:15.440
The first thing that
they tried to do--

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:18.140
I don't know if anybody
remembers this, but the very

00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:21.280
first thing was to try and
create optical character

00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:25.200
recognition software to
outwit the CAPTCHA.

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:27.030
Couple big CAPTCHAs fell.

00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:29.500
But still CAPTCHAs got more
and more complex.

00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:31.810
So that didn't seem to
be a viable route.

00:28:31.810 --> 00:28:35.750
The next option was to hire
people in low average income

00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:38.210
countries to fill
out CAPTCHAs.

00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:38.610
Right.

00:28:38.610 --> 00:28:41.430
And even today, if anybody's
interested, afterwards come up

00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:43.820
to me, and I'll hook you up
to the right vendors.

00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:48.180
You can go on the weekend and
make a couple extra bucks by

00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:49.490
filling in CAPTCHAs.

00:28:49.490 --> 00:28:52.640
I think it's now up to 1/100
of a cent per CAPTCHA.

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:54.690
So, again, if things
are tight here at

00:28:54.690 --> 00:28:57.530
Google, just let me know.

00:28:57.530 --> 00:28:59.050
But even that doesn't scale.

00:28:59.050 --> 00:29:03.320
If you have to try 100,000
password attempts, for

00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:05.465
example, that gets kind
of expensive.

00:29:05.465 --> 00:29:08.590
You might as well buy a stolen
credit card number for that

00:29:08.590 --> 00:29:09.980
investment.

00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:14.190
But then they did something
truly revolutionary to get rid

00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:17.020
of the choke point
of the CAPTCHA.

00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:19.340
They leveraged the
most powerful

00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:21.180
force on the internet.

00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:27.330
The force that included
image tags in HTML.

00:29:27.330 --> 00:29:31.280
The force that pushed the
balance of database search and

00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:32.840
access time.

00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:37.270
The force that picked
VHS over Betamax.

00:29:37.270 --> 00:29:39.010
Pornography.

00:29:39.010 --> 00:29:42.880
So they created pornographic
servers, most of the time

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:45.270
specialty pornographic
servers.

00:29:45.270 --> 00:29:48.160
And to get to the next image or
next video, you didn't have

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:51.460
to sign up, no credit
card required.

00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:55.800
All you had to do was fill
in five CAPTCHAs.

00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:56.790
That's it.

00:29:56.790 --> 00:29:58.130
Probably very quickly.

00:29:58.130 --> 00:29:58.820
That's my guess.

00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:00.040
I don't know.

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:01.060
This is all theoretical.

00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:03.500
But it's interesting.

00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:06.110
Because they were getting
thousands of these things

00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:09.220
filled out for free every
single minute.

00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:12.860
It's a pretty sad commentary
on society actually.

00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:17.320
But this was a solution to the
choke point problem that

00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:18.590
really scaled.

00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:18.870
Right.

00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:23.970
There is no CAPTCHA, even
RECAPTCHA can't get around

00:30:23.970 --> 00:30:28.480
this problem of a motivated
person filling in CAPTCHAs.

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:32.580
And what they would do is take
these CAPTCHAs real time from

00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:35.580
the sites that they were
trying to get into.

00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:38.410
And so they had this elaborate
infrastructure on how they

00:30:38.410 --> 00:30:40.040
delivered the CAPTCHAs
so it was in the

00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:41.790
right window of time.

00:30:41.790 --> 00:30:43.590
Truly, truly amazing.

00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:46.420
So that's one of our
inspirations in the book.

00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:47.820
If that can be an inspiration.

00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:50.880
And this is a less ambitious--

00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:53.335
this wasn't like five CAPTCHAs
for the next image.

00:30:53.335 --> 00:30:55.600
This was one CAPTCHA
per article

00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:57.030
of clothing or something.

00:30:57.030 --> 00:30:58.380
Appropriately censored.

00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:00.030
Appropriately censored.

00:31:00.030 --> 00:31:02.380
BOB SULLIVAN: Specialized
pornographic servers?

00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:05.990
HUGH THOMPSON: That's what
it said in the article.

00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:08.611
BOB SULLIVAN: We'll discuss
that later.

00:31:08.611 --> 00:31:10.410
HUGH THOMPSON: It
was researched.

00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:12.930
The Colombia students told me.

00:31:12.930 --> 00:31:15.320
BOB SULLIVAN: So another one
of the things that really

00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:17.350
makes small businesses plateau,
we have a lot of

00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:19.860
stuff about small businesses and
small enterprises within

00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:21.100
large businesses.

00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:23.770
The worst thing that could
possibly happen when you're

00:31:23.770 --> 00:31:25.510
starting out at some adventure
is for you

00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:28.290
to succeed a little.

00:31:28.290 --> 00:31:30.810
And then succeed maybe a little
bit more, and then

00:31:30.810 --> 00:31:33.370
slowly but surely whatever
technology that you have, it

00:31:33.370 --> 00:31:34.450
kind of keeps going.

00:31:34.450 --> 00:31:36.790
I always think of AOL when
I think about this.

00:31:36.790 --> 00:31:37.310
HUGH THOMPSON: Oh, wow.

00:31:37.310 --> 00:31:38.960
AOL is a blast from the past.

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:41.170
BOB SULLIVAN: Specifically
AOL's dial up service.

00:31:41.170 --> 00:31:41.860
Right.

00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:44.320
So failing slow is the biggest
problem that a lot of

00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:45.260
companies can have.

00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:47.740
The opposite of failing slow,
of course, is failing fast

00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:48.540
which is what you want to do.

00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:49.870
If you're starting
a new adventure,

00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:50.690
you have some money.

00:31:50.690 --> 00:31:51.690
You have some ideas.

00:31:51.690 --> 00:31:54.590
What you want to do is touch
customers as soon as possible.

00:31:54.590 --> 00:31:55.780
Get feedback as soon
as possible.

00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:58.100
And find out if your idea stinks
or there is some fatal

00:31:58.100 --> 00:31:59.050
flaw to it.

00:31:59.050 --> 00:32:01.410
Because if it succeeds a little
and you chug along,

00:32:01.410 --> 00:32:03.480
three or four years can go by
and next thing you know,

00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:04.311
everybody's past you by.

00:32:04.311 --> 00:32:06.460
And everyone's way too
emotionally invested in this

00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:08.370
specific idea that you have.

00:32:08.370 --> 00:32:12.900
Now failing fast was invented
really as a term by your

00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:13.985
friend Alberto.

00:32:13.985 --> 00:32:15.160
HUGH THOMPSON: Oh, yeah,
Alberto Savioa.

00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:17.200
I don't know if anybody
here knows Alberto.

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:20.010
So he was the Engineering
Director for AdWords for a

00:32:20.010 --> 00:32:21.450
long time here at Google.

00:32:21.450 --> 00:32:25.440
BOB SULLIVAN: So talk about
the pretotyping.

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:27.735
HUGH THOMPSON: Yeah, so he had
this fascinating concept.

00:32:27.735 --> 00:32:31.360
And he really applied it while
he was here, this idea of

00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:32.470
pretotyping.

00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:36.120
So pretotyping is create
a pre prototype.

00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:37.130
Even if it doesn't work.

00:32:37.130 --> 00:32:40.590
Even if there's humans in the
back end filling out forms and

00:32:40.590 --> 00:32:42.200
giving you responses.

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:46.010
The idea behind a pretotype is
you'll quickly know if there's

00:32:46.010 --> 00:32:49.590
a response to it by the
user community.

00:32:49.590 --> 00:32:53.830
Pretotyping is becoming a very,
very powerful way for

00:32:53.830 --> 00:32:56.300
startups to get validation,
for example.

00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:58.290
I live in Silicon Valley now.

00:32:58.290 --> 00:33:00.670
And it's fascinating the
things that would-be

00:33:00.670 --> 00:33:02.110
entrepreneurs will do.

00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:05.500
This one guy pulled me aside,
I had coffee with him a

00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:06.750
couple years ago.

00:33:06.750 --> 00:33:10.500
And he said their method for
rolling out a new product or

00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:14.320
service is to create essentially
a storefront that

00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:17.650
looks like the service
exists on the web.

00:33:17.650 --> 00:33:20.440
And they wait till they get to
the point where they're asking

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:22.640
for somebody's credit
card number.

00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:24.320
They let the credit
card number be

00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:26.150
entered and hit submit.

00:33:26.150 --> 00:33:29.010
And then it just sends them
to a 404 error page.

00:33:29.010 --> 00:33:31.370
Because they've actually
not built the service.

00:33:31.370 --> 00:33:34.240
But then they take and count the
number of people that have

00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:37.180
gotten to that point and then go
to the venture capitalists

00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:39.960
and say, hey, see how many
people would have signed up

00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:42.360
for this thing if it
really existed.

00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:47.280
So this idea of pretotyping is
a very powerful one in other

00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:48.760
areas of your life too.

00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:51.180
It doesn't just have to be
startups and businesses.

00:33:51.180 --> 00:33:53.740
BOB SULLIVAN: And we want to
be respectful of your time.

00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:54.260
So we know this.

00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:55.570
We're going to leave a couple
of minutes for questions.

00:33:55.570 --> 00:33:57.190
We just have a couple
more slides.

00:33:57.190 --> 00:33:59.380
And then we'll leave some time
so that you can ask questions

00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:00.420
or run off too.

00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:01.820
I'm sure there are very
important things

00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:02.950
that you have to do.

00:34:02.950 --> 00:34:04.860
But just one last of the
elements that we're going to

00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:06.660
go through, distorted data.

00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:09.429
We just did a segment with CNBC
yesterday about a concept

00:34:09.429 --> 00:34:10.980
we call data idolatry.

00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:12.199
We love big data.

00:34:12.199 --> 00:34:13.070
I'm a sports fan.

00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:14.350
I love sabermetrics.

00:34:14.350 --> 00:34:17.090
But at the same time, there's
all sorts of evidence to show

00:34:17.090 --> 00:34:19.310
that people are giving way too
much credence to data which is

00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:23.310
always backward looking and
losing the strength of their

00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:25.670
intuition and their
judgment muscle.

00:34:25.670 --> 00:34:27.100
And all decision should
be made as a

00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:28.300
combination of those things.

00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:30.670
And right now we sort of have a
lot of high priests of data.

00:34:30.670 --> 00:34:33.060
And there's a lot of ways that
data can lie just like

00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:33.840
statistics can lie.

00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:35.739
And just like I'm in
the media business.

00:34:35.739 --> 00:34:37.610
And for a long time, we didn't
think photographs can lie.

00:34:37.610 --> 00:34:40.110
Photographs are among the most
famous liars in history.

00:34:40.110 --> 00:34:41.860
So you want to keep
that in mind.

00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:43.270
And then, I think we
should wrap up

00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:43.944
and ask some questions.

00:34:43.944 --> 00:34:44.750
What do you think?

00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:45.310
HUGH THOMPSON: Yeah.

00:34:45.310 --> 00:34:46.380
Yeah sure.

00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:51.199
Well, I'll just go to this
last public service

00:34:51.199 --> 00:34:51.589
announcement.

00:34:51.589 --> 00:34:52.320
BOB SULLIVAN: Please do.

00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:52.489
That's important.

00:34:52.489 --> 00:34:53.100
HUGH THOMPSON: Now
before we leave.

00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:56.290
And this is related to
the data problem.

00:34:56.290 --> 00:34:57.810
And, again, it's coming
up summer.

00:34:57.810 --> 00:34:59.420
Many people are considering
a vacation,

00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:01.710
somewhere tropical to go.

00:35:01.710 --> 00:35:05.080
Just wanted to let you know that
there's a very serious

00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:08.220
issue occurring out there
in the world called

00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:09.540
Sharkmageddon.

00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:11.390
Now I don't know if
you've seen this.

00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:13.890
But there's been a dramatic
increase in

00:35:13.890 --> 00:35:16.650
worldwide shark attacks.

00:35:16.650 --> 00:35:21.170
If you look at the headlines
that came out of this increase

00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:25.140
a couple years ago, you've got
this one from MSNBC.com.

00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:27.790
BOB SULLIVAN: A very important
news service.

00:35:27.790 --> 00:35:30.120
HUGH THOMPSON: But note the
exceptionally scary

00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:31.090
picture of a shark.

00:35:31.090 --> 00:35:34.850
Shark attacks rose 25% last
year across the globe.

00:35:34.850 --> 00:35:37.630
"LA Times," a more docile
looking shark.

00:35:37.630 --> 00:35:40.030
But still concerning.

00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:43.810
"Huffington Post," they've got
people closing beaches signs

00:35:43.810 --> 00:35:46.180
going up about these
shark attacks.

00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:47.690
BOB SULLIVAN: 25% again.

00:35:47.690 --> 00:35:48.470
HUGH THOMPSON: 25%.

00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:48.940
BOB SULLIVAN: It's huge.

00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:49.410
HUGH THOMPSON: Really serious.

00:35:49.410 --> 00:35:50.490
That's a big increase man.

00:35:50.490 --> 00:35:53.100
That's like "The Birds" but
for sharks or something.

00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:53.860
I don't know.

00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:58.810
But if you look behind the
numbers, it's fascinating.

00:35:58.810 --> 00:36:03.370
The number of shark attacks
worldwide, so this is for

00:36:03.370 --> 00:36:07.570
every person who went
in the ocean in 2010

00:36:07.570 --> 00:36:10.060
went from 63% to 79%.

00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:11.035
BOB SULLIVAN: That is 25%.

00:36:11.035 --> 00:36:12.620
HUGH THOMPSON: It is 25%.

00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:13.070
I agree.

00:36:13.070 --> 00:36:17.570
But your personal chances of
getting bitten by a shark are

00:36:17.570 --> 00:36:23.210
less than you being hit by a
buss painted like a shark on

00:36:23.210 --> 00:36:25.576
the way to the beach.

00:36:25.576 --> 00:36:26.965
And statistically--

00:36:26.965 --> 00:36:27.900
and I'm statistician.

00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:28.331
BOB SULLIVAN: That's
very-- yeah.

00:36:28.331 --> 00:36:28.380
Yeah.

00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:32.340
HUGH THOMPSON: And it's
interesting much of the

00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:35.120
increase was due to two very
angry sharks in Egypt.

00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:37.370
BOB SULLIVAN: Who were
responsible for 12 or 13 of

00:36:37.370 --> 00:36:38.120
the attacks or something.

00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:39.110
HUGH THOMPSON: Which
proves something

00:36:39.110 --> 00:36:40.110
we've known all along.

00:36:40.110 --> 00:36:43.120
One shark can make
a difference.

00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:44.230
Sorry, I had to throw that.

00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:44.430
Sorry.

00:36:44.430 --> 00:36:45.150
Sorry.

00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:48.550
But yeah, we would like to leave
time to talk a little

00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:49.180
bit about this.

00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:51.620
And, of course, there's a lot
more in the book around what

00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:54.370
these specific areas
are that cause

00:36:54.370 --> 00:36:55.675
plateaus and lead to plateaus.

00:36:55.675 --> 00:36:57.300
BOB SULLIVAN: And hopefully how
they can help you in what

00:36:57.300 --> 00:36:59.100
you're doing here or at
home or trying to

00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:00.430
learn how to play guitar.

00:37:00.430 --> 00:37:01.570
I know there's some
books in the back.

00:37:01.570 --> 00:37:03.070
We're happy to hang around
too and sign some

00:37:03.070 --> 00:37:03.950
books if you want to.

00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:06.640
But thank you for all of your
attention, and we'd love to

00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:08.990
take some questions now.

00:37:08.990 --> 00:37:10.440
Apparently there's two
microphones on

00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:11.410
either side of the back.

00:37:11.410 --> 00:37:13.760
And they are recording it, so it
would be best if you could

00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:17.890
walk up to the microphone
and ask your question.

00:37:17.890 --> 00:37:18.190
Hi.

00:37:18.190 --> 00:37:18.880
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:19.370
Thanks for your talk.

00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:20.530
I really enjoyed it.

00:37:20.530 --> 00:37:22.850
So I find it persuasive the way
you present as far as an

00:37:22.850 --> 00:37:25.690
individual's growth that we
all reach these plateaus.

00:37:25.690 --> 00:37:27.082
And we have to take these
other measures to

00:37:27.082 --> 00:37:28.100
change things up.

00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:34.050
Switch to from one profession
or attempt to another.

00:37:34.050 --> 00:37:35.690
But it seems like there's
another side of the coin,

00:37:35.690 --> 00:37:38.450
which is somebody maybe spends
20 years in a profession doing

00:37:38.450 --> 00:37:41.230
something, becomes the greatest
treadmill runner,

00:37:41.230 --> 00:37:43.900
they may not grow as much, but
they'll be better at their job

00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:44.880
than someone else.

00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:47.340
So is there a way to combine
the best of both?

00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:49.360
BOB SULLIVAN: I think that's
a really great point.

00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:51.800
And in our time right
now, you're talking

00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:52.860
about mastery, right?

00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:55.350
And this is sort of the 10,000
hours thing that Malcolm

00:37:55.350 --> 00:37:56.280
Gladwell always talks about.

00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:58.970
It takes 10,000 hours, by the
way, I always compute this in

00:37:58.970 --> 00:38:01.200
my head, is basically 10
years, of hard work.

00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:03.290
So it takes 10 years to
get good at something.

00:38:03.290 --> 00:38:05.110
And we live in this economy now
where we tend to get rid

00:38:05.110 --> 00:38:07.160
of people who then are
good at things.

00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:09.980
So I absolutely think
that you're right.

00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:11.950
We are talking about one
half of this equation.

00:38:11.950 --> 00:38:15.070
So I'm a musician so I talk
about this a lot.

00:38:15.070 --> 00:38:17.500
If you're a classical guitarist,
and you've topped

00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:19.970
out in where you're going, one
of the best things you can do

00:38:19.970 --> 00:38:23.160
is take six months and plug
in and play rock and roll.

00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:24.330
Teaches some whole
new techniques.

00:38:24.330 --> 00:38:26.230
It stimulates other parts
of the brain.

00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:27.930
And that's one of the ways that
you can move forward.

00:38:27.930 --> 00:38:30.230
I am very personally concerned
about what you're saying

00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:34.490
though, which is if you are a
master in your field, we don't

00:38:34.490 --> 00:38:37.730
really, I think, regard mastery
just like we kind of

00:38:37.730 --> 00:38:40.660
don't regard age in the United
States in a lot of situations.

00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:40.940
Right?

00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:43.770
So maybe he's giving us an
idea for our next book.

00:38:43.770 --> 00:38:44.060
HUGH THOMPSON: Oh, yeah.

00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:44.785
A sequel.

00:38:44.785 --> 00:38:45.390
BOB SULLIVAN: Yeah.

00:38:45.390 --> 00:38:45.840
Yeah.

00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:49.200
No, but I think the lesson that
our book would have for

00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:52.270
someone in that situation is you
don't have to necessarily,

00:38:52.270 --> 00:38:53.820
like the music example
I just gave you.

00:38:53.820 --> 00:38:56.230
We're not saying that a fireman
should go try to be a

00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:57.660
software engineer.

00:38:57.660 --> 00:38:59.910
But we're saying that within
your discipline, there are

00:38:59.910 --> 00:39:03.290
ways for you to try very,
very new things.

00:39:03.290 --> 00:39:07.290
And it's funny, if you look at
food and you look at music,

00:39:07.290 --> 00:39:10.290
fusion is actually the trend
in almost all of these

00:39:10.290 --> 00:39:11.220
disciplines.

00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:17.640
So like Indian, and I mean
Indian subcontinent, jazz, for

00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:19.110
example, is really popular
in alternative

00:39:19.110 --> 00:39:19.980
music for right now.

00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:21.270
So musical fusions.

00:39:21.270 --> 00:39:22.940
And restaurants, I go to
restaurants all the

00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:25.810
time now that are--

00:39:25.810 --> 00:39:28.360
well, you see this a lot
in the Latin community.

00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:31.720
They'll be Spanish restaurants
that have ceviche from Latin

00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:32.790
America, for example.

00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:36.480
Or even Korean restaurants that
are integrating some of

00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:37.690
this Latin American flavors.

00:39:37.690 --> 00:39:40.940
And so combining talents, I
think, is really where people

00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:45.130
can and not necessarily
abandoning fields they're in,

00:39:45.130 --> 00:39:47.940
but plucking out things from
brand new fields and applying

00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:49.870
them to what they're doing
right now is probably the

00:39:49.870 --> 00:39:53.970
fastest way to accelerate even
if you are sort of stuck at

00:39:53.970 --> 00:39:55.915
the high end of that
plateau curve.

00:39:55.915 --> 00:39:58.910
HUGH THOMPSON: And just add
something to that, I think

00:39:58.910 --> 00:40:02.460
there's areas in your life where
you want to be a master.

00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:06.330
If you're writing Java code or
C-sharp, probably Java you

00:40:06.330 --> 00:40:08.140
know that's fine.

00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:12.020
If you're writing code then
every incremental improvement

00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:15.350
even if it's small compared
to where you were is good.

00:40:15.350 --> 00:40:18.480
Because that's an area where
you want to have mastery.

00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:21.730
There's so many other areas of
our lives though where we just

00:40:21.730 --> 00:40:24.570
want to get to a level
that's good enough.

00:40:24.570 --> 00:40:28.680
And the question is to move
from good enough to master

00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:30.730
that might be a 10 year gap.

00:40:30.730 --> 00:40:34.280
But to move from nothing to good
enough might be a very

00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:35.330
small amount of time.

00:40:35.330 --> 00:40:37.860
So the question is which areas
in your life do you want

00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:40.070
mastery and which areas in your
life do you want to get

00:40:40.070 --> 00:40:42.185
to that point?

00:40:42.185 --> 00:40:42.840
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:43.150
HUGH THOMPSON: Great.

00:40:43.150 --> 00:40:43.460
Thanks.

00:40:43.460 --> 00:40:46.142
BOB SULLIVAN: Thanks
for the question.

00:40:46.142 --> 00:40:47.200
HUGH THOMPSON: Questions?

00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:49.620
BOB SULLIVAN: This curious room
full of Googlers, there

00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:50.210
must be questions.

00:40:50.210 --> 00:40:51.800
HUGH THOMPSON: Comments?

00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:55.160
Personal issues at home you'd
like to share in a supportive

00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:56.945
group of other peers?

00:40:56.945 --> 00:40:58.665
BOB SULLIVAN: Don't ever get
on an airplane with him.

00:40:58.665 --> 00:40:59.300
HUGH THOMPSON: No.

00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:03.380
Dude, I'm sworn off
of that stuff.

00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:04.900
BOB SULLIVAN: Well, if there's
no questions, we'll just hang

00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:06.210
around the back and then
may be we can take them

00:41:06.210 --> 00:41:07.230
individually or sign
some books.

00:41:07.230 --> 00:41:08.180
Thanks again for your time.

00:41:08.180 --> 00:41:08.780
HUGH THOMPSON: Thanks a lot.

00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:10.030
Appreciate it.
