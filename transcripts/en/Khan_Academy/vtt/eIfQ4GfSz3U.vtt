00:00:00.391 --> 00:00:02.235
Narrator: As we'll see in this video

00:00:02.235 --> 00:00:06.099
and in others, the roots
of a lot of the current

00:00:06.099 --> 00:00:08.615
disagreements in the Middle East

00:00:08.615 --> 00:00:10.069
and a lot of the conflict
in the Middle East

00:00:10.069 --> 00:00:13.495
can actually be traced
back to World War I.

00:00:13.495 --> 00:00:15.893
I realize this is an
incredibly touchy subject

00:00:15.893 --> 00:00:17.405
that there are people who
have very strong feelings

00:00:17.405 --> 00:00:20.077
on either side of it and
my goal here is to really

00:00:20.077 --> 00:00:24.872
give my best attempt at
what really happened.

00:00:24.872 --> 00:00:28.102
I encourage you to doubt any of this

00:00:28.102 --> 00:00:31.247
and look it up yourself and come, frankly,

00:00:31.247 --> 00:00:32.810
to your own conclusions.

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.465
Let's rewind back to October of 1915,

00:00:36.465 --> 00:00:38.069
or 1915 in particular.

00:00:38.069 --> 00:00:41.046
The British were already
at war with the Ottoman's.

00:00:41.046 --> 00:00:42.403
Just as a reminder of
some of what happened

00:00:42.403 --> 00:00:45.131
in 1915, the Gallipoli campaign,

00:00:45.131 --> 00:00:47.003
by the end of 1915 it was pretty clear

00:00:47.003 --> 00:00:49.132
that this was a disaster for the allies.

00:00:49.132 --> 00:00:51.287
The Ottoman's were able
to fend off the allies,

00:00:51.287 --> 00:00:52.953
they were in retreat.

00:00:52.953 --> 00:00:55.398
The British were able to
fend off the Ottoman's

00:00:55.398 --> 00:00:58.662
when they tried to attack
the Suez canal in 1915.

00:00:58.662 --> 00:01:00.936
This is the background,
you can imagine the British

00:01:00.936 --> 00:01:04.013
are eager to get any other allies they can

00:01:04.013 --> 00:01:07.584
in their battle against the Ottoman's.

00:01:07.584 --> 00:01:09.010
In particular, they are
eager to get the help

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.403
of the Arab's who have been under the rule

00:01:11.403 --> 00:01:13.823
of the Ottoman's for hundreds of years.

00:01:13.823 --> 00:01:15.668
That's the backdrop where you have

00:01:15.668 --> 00:01:17.812
this correspondence between
the high commissioner

00:01:17.812 --> 00:01:19.669
in Egypt, the British high commissioner,

00:01:19.669 --> 00:01:22.667
Sir Henry McMahon and the Sharif of Mecca,

00:01:22.667 --> 00:01:25.709
Hussein bin Ê¿Ali, who
had his own aspirations

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:28.564
to essentially be the
king of an independent

00:01:28.564 --> 00:01:30.079
Arab state.

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:32.601
They kept going back
and forth from mid 1915

00:01:32.601 --> 00:01:36.561
to early 1916 talking about
what the state could be.

00:01:36.561 --> 00:01:38.066
Obviously the British want his support,

00:01:38.066 --> 00:01:43.004
wants him to lead a revolt
against the Ottoman's.

00:01:43.004 --> 00:01:46.077
He's already articulated the boundaries

00:01:46.077 --> 00:01:48.891
for a state that he would like to see.

00:01:48.891 --> 00:01:50.929
So, that gives us a context
for this correspondence

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:52.819
in October of 1915.

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:55.727
This is from Sir Henry McMahon to Hussein.

00:01:55.727 --> 00:01:57.944
"... it is with great pleasure
that I communicate to you

00:01:57.944 --> 00:02:00.475
"on their behalf," the
British government's behalf,

00:02:00.475 --> 00:02:02.559
"the following statement,
which I am confident

00:02:02.559 --> 00:02:04.196
"you will receive with satisfaction.

00:02:04.196 --> 00:02:08.535
"The two districts of
Mersina and Alexandretta

00:02:08.535 --> 00:02:10.182
"and portions of Syria lying to the west

00:02:10.182 --> 00:02:12.581
"of the districts of Damascus, Homs, Hama,

00:02:12.581 --> 00:02:15.331
"and Aleppo cannot be
said to be purely Arab,

00:02:15.331 --> 00:02:17.912
"and should be excluded
from the limits demanded."

00:02:17.912 --> 00:02:19.980
This is referring to the limits that

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.072
Hussein bin Ali had demanded

00:02:22.072 --> 00:02:23.750
in previous correspondence.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.684
"With the above modifications,"
so just that region

00:02:25.684 --> 00:02:28.569
right over there, this right over here is

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:31.404
Mersina, Alexandretta, this is Hama,

00:02:31.404 --> 00:02:34.979
Homs, Damascus, so really
what he's referring to

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:39.338
is this region, the west,
the west of those cities

00:02:39.338 --> 00:02:40.408
right over here.

00:02:40.408 --> 00:02:42.068
He's saying look, you
can't really consider

00:02:42.068 --> 00:02:44.067
this to be purely Arab,
I'm going to exclude

00:02:44.067 --> 00:02:46.228
this out of the boundaries
of this potential

00:02:46.228 --> 00:02:48.738
independent Arab state.

00:02:48.738 --> 00:02:51.204
"With the above modification,
and without prejudice

00:02:51.204 --> 00:02:52.871
"to our existing treaties with Arab chiefs

00:02:52.871 --> 00:02:56.945
"we accept those limits,"
we accept those limits.

00:02:56.945 --> 00:02:59.616
"As for those regions lying
within those frontiers

00:02:59.616 --> 00:03:01.390
"wherein Great Britain is free to act

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.721
"without determinant to
the interest of her ally,

00:03:03.721 --> 00:03:05.707
"France," so as long as
I'm not getting in trouble

00:03:05.707 --> 00:03:07.872
with France, "I'm empowered in the name of

00:03:07.872 --> 00:03:09.796
"the Government of Great
Britain to give the following

00:03:09.796 --> 00:03:12.957
"assurances and make the following reply

00:03:12.957 --> 00:03:15.739
"to your letter; Subject to
the above modifications,"

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:19.212
so taking this part out,
"Great Britain is prepared

00:03:19.212 --> 00:03:22.727
"to recognize and support the independence

00:03:22.727 --> 00:03:25.992
"of the Arabs in all the
regions within the limits

00:03:25.992 --> 00:03:27.527
"demanded by the Sharif of Mecca."

00:03:27.527 --> 00:03:30.285
So, essentially it
included all of this region

00:03:30.285 --> 00:03:32.707
and actually much beyond
what I'm showing here,

00:03:32.707 --> 00:03:36.055
kind of present day Syria, Jordan, Iraq,

00:03:36.055 --> 00:03:38.659
parts of present day Saudi Arabia.

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:40.700
All of that is essentially,
the British are saying,

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.202
yeah we're going to
allow you to have that,

00:03:43.202 --> 00:03:44.758
an independent state there.

00:03:44.758 --> 00:03:46.681
"Great Britain will
guarantee the Holy Places

00:03:46.681 --> 00:03:48.120
"against all external aggression

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.121
"and will recognize their inviolability.

00:03:50.121 --> 00:03:52.654
"... I am convinced that
this declaration will assure

00:03:52.654 --> 00:03:54.656
"you beyond all possible doubt,"

00:03:54.656 --> 00:03:57.593
beyond all possible
doubt, "of the sympathy

00:03:57.593 --> 00:04:00.878
"of Great Britain towards
the aspiration of her friends

00:04:00.878 --> 00:04:03.022
"the Arabs, and will result in a firm

00:04:03.022 --> 00:04:06.275
"and lasting alliance,
the immediate results

00:04:06.275 --> 00:04:08.124
"of which will be the
expulsion of the Turks

00:04:08.124 --> 00:04:10.204
"from the Arab countries and the freeing

00:04:10.204 --> 00:04:12.098
"of the Arab peoples
from the Turkish yoke,

00:04:12.098 --> 00:04:14.600
"which for so many years
has pressed heavily

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.255
"upon them."

00:04:16.255 --> 00:04:18.690
This actually does help
to convince the Arab's

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.455
to rise up against the Turks,

00:04:21.455 --> 00:04:23.796
against the Ottoman Empire,
they play a significant

00:04:23.796 --> 00:04:25.470
role in the Palestine Campaign,

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.454
they rise up in June of 1916.

00:04:28.454 --> 00:04:30.620
Now, the video that I did
on the Palestine Campaign,

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.349
I got several comments
of people being cynical

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:35.842
about Britain's intentions
and it does look like

00:04:35.842 --> 00:04:38.342
the British were, indeed, cynical.

00:04:38.342 --> 00:04:41.387
T.E. Lawrence famous
for Lawrence of Arabia

00:04:41.387 --> 00:04:44.346
was often depicted as
this mystical fellow,

00:04:44.346 --> 00:04:47.127
this guy who had this
kinship with the Arab's.

00:04:47.127 --> 00:04:48.939
His actual correspondence with the

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:51.550
British government actually
do show that he did have

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.096
a kind of ... he was doing, I guess,

00:04:55.096 --> 00:04:56.863
in the words of George
W. Bush, a little bit of

00:04:56.863 --> 00:04:59.225
strategery, he had a more cynical view

00:04:59.225 --> 00:05:01.922
of this relationship with the Arab's.

00:05:01.922 --> 00:05:03.294
This is some correspondence that he wrote

00:05:03.294 --> 00:05:06.466
in early 1916, so right
about the same time

00:05:06.466 --> 00:05:08.375
that all of this was going on.

00:05:08.375 --> 00:05:11.070
This says he's referring
to a possible Arab revolt,

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:12.221
or Hussein's activity.

00:05:12.221 --> 00:05:15.578
"Hussein's activity
seems beneficial to us,

00:05:15.578 --> 00:05:17.561
"because it matches
with our immediate aims,

00:05:17.561 --> 00:05:20.247
"the break-up of the Islamic 'bloc'

00:05:20.247 --> 00:05:22.030
"and the defeat and disruption of the

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:23.521
"Ottoman Empire."

00:05:23.521 --> 00:05:24.966
Assuming he didn't really talk about this,

00:05:24.966 --> 00:05:28.025
this being one of the
... the British didn't

00:05:28.025 --> 00:05:30.321
talk about that when they
were talking to Hussein.

00:05:30.321 --> 00:05:32.404
"If we can arrange that
this political change

00:05:32.404 --> 00:05:35.036
"shall be a violent one,
we will have abolished

00:05:35.036 --> 00:05:38.278
"the threat of Islam, by
dividing it against itself,

00:05:38.278 --> 00:05:39.487
"in its very heart."

00:05:39.487 --> 00:05:41.276
"There will then be a Khalifa,"

00:05:41.276 --> 00:05:42.789
kind of a seat of Islam, "in Turkey

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:47.001
"and a Khalifa in Arabia,
in theological warfare."

00:05:47.001 --> 00:05:48.751
This is T.E. Lawrence, I got this from

00:05:48.751 --> 00:05:50.122
The Golden Warrior: The Life and Legend

00:05:50.122 --> 00:05:51.932
of Lawrence of Arabia.

00:05:51.932 --> 00:05:54.540
Even this, somewhat
portrayed as a heroic figure,

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.382
was doing things in very strategic,

00:05:57.382 --> 00:05:59.298
strategic terms.

00:05:59.298 --> 00:06:01.761
To make things worse for the Arab's,

00:06:01.761 --> 00:06:04.246
while the British were
trying to convince them

00:06:04.246 --> 00:06:06.210
to revolt, they were also
in secret negotiations

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:08.656
with the French on how they would divide

00:06:08.656 --> 00:06:11.701
the Middle East if they were able

00:06:11.701 --> 00:06:13.448
to beat the Ottoman's.

00:06:13.448 --> 00:06:15.601
At this point in the war
the British were already

00:06:15.601 --> 00:06:17.697
making some progress in Mesopotamia,

00:06:17.697 --> 00:06:19.715
but they really hadn't really started

00:06:19.715 --> 00:06:22.055
on the Palestine Campaign right here.

00:06:22.055 --> 00:06:23.564
So, this was all conjecture.

00:06:23.564 --> 00:06:25.720
The British representatives was Sykes,

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.718
the French representative was Picot,

00:06:27.718 --> 00:06:29.822
this was done with the
consent of the Russian's.

00:06:29.822 --> 00:06:32.240
You didn't have a revolution in Russia

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:37.572
as of now, so in early
1916, in May this agreement

00:06:37.572 --> 00:06:39.046
was concluded, this secret agreement.

00:06:39.046 --> 00:06:46.221
You have the Sykes-Picot Agreement,

00:06:46.221 --> 00:06:47.518
it's secret.

00:06:47.518 --> 00:06:49.053
Let me write that, it
is a secret agreement

00:06:49.053 --> 00:06:52.397
between Britain and France
and essentially they are

00:06:52.397 --> 00:06:54.717
carving up the entire
Middle East between them.

00:06:54.717 --> 00:06:56.884
This blue area right here,
this would be occupied

00:06:56.884 --> 00:06:59.719
by the French, part of eastern Turkey

00:06:59.719 --> 00:07:01.880
or modern day eastern
Turkey would be given

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.428
to the Russian's.

00:07:03.428 --> 00:07:06.238
The British would be able to occupy,

00:07:06.238 --> 00:07:09.051
would occupy southern Mesopotamia

00:07:09.051 --> 00:07:12.264
essentially insuring protection of the oil

00:07:12.264 --> 00:07:13.929
that is coming out of Persia.

00:07:13.929 --> 00:07:15.589
Oil is becoming more
and more of a relevant

00:07:15.589 --> 00:07:18.060
factor in kind of global power.

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:19.545
Then you have these two protectorates

00:07:19.545 --> 00:07:20.985
right over here, which in theory could be

00:07:20.985 --> 00:07:23.129
independent or an independent Arab state,

00:07:23.129 --> 00:07:25.886
or two independent Arab
states under the protection.

00:07:25.886 --> 00:07:27.484
Let me put that in quotes,

00:07:27.484 --> 00:07:29.892
because "protectorate"
is always not as nice

00:07:29.892 --> 00:07:32.722
as it sounds, under the
protection of the French

00:07:32.722 --> 00:07:33.948
or the British which means,

00:07:33.948 --> 00:07:35.518
"Hey you're an independent
state, but we will

00:07:35.518 --> 00:07:38.304
"protect you in case
anyone wants to invade."

00:07:38.304 --> 00:07:40.669
The reality of protectorate
is that it usually involves

00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:44.198
the people doing the protecting have all

00:07:44.198 --> 00:07:47.629
the real power and all the real influence.

00:07:47.629 --> 00:07:49.597
The Sykes-Picot Agreement
also give this little

00:07:49.597 --> 00:07:52.095
carve out to Britain so
they would have access

00:07:52.095 --> 00:07:53.513
to the Mediterranean.

00:07:53.513 --> 00:07:57.041
Palestine, or the Roman Kingdom of Judea,

00:07:57.041 --> 00:08:04.472
this is carved out as a
separate international property

00:08:04.472 --> 00:08:06.547
something that would be
administered by multiple

00:08:06.547 --> 00:08:08.470
states and I guess the argument would be,

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:09.863
this is where the Holy Land's are,

00:08:09.863 --> 00:08:12.557
multiple religions have
some of their holiest sites

00:08:12.557 --> 00:08:15.539
within here and so they
carved it out like this.

00:08:15.539 --> 00:08:17.349
Once again, this is all in secret,

00:08:17.349 --> 00:08:19.270
they obviously don't want
the Arab's to find out

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:21.102
because they're about
to convince the Arab's

00:08:21.102 --> 00:08:24.167
to join in a revolt against the Ottoman's.

00:08:24.167 --> 00:08:27.689
Now, to make things ... once
again, this was all secret

00:08:27.689 --> 00:08:30.839
up to this point in 1916
when it was all agreed on.

00:08:30.839 --> 00:08:34.871
Then you forward to 1917 where we have

00:08:34.871 --> 00:08:36.672
the famous Balfour Declaration.

00:08:36.672 --> 00:08:42.068
This right over here is
the Balfour Declaration

00:08:42.068 --> 00:08:43.888
and it was essentially a letter from

00:08:43.888 --> 00:08:47.674
the Foreign Secretary
of the U.K., Balfour,

00:08:47.674 --> 00:08:52.869
to Lord Rothschild who was
a leading [Briticizen] ,

00:08:52.869 --> 00:08:54.701
a leading member of the Jewish community.

00:08:54.701 --> 00:08:57.670
In it he writes, "Dear Lord Rothschild,

00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:59.864
"I have much pleasure in conveying to you,

00:08:59.864 --> 00:09:01.454
"on behalf of His Majesty's Government,

00:09:01.454 --> 00:09:03.680
"the following declaration of sympathy

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:06.792
"with Jewish Zionist
aspirations which has been

00:09:06.792 --> 00:09:09.490
"submitted to, and
approved by, the Cabinet.

00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:12.423
"His Majesty's Government view with favor

00:09:12.423 --> 00:09:15.515
"the establishment in
Palestine of a national home,"

00:09:15.515 --> 00:09:18.418
of a national home,
"for the Jewish people,

00:09:18.418 --> 00:09:20.408
"and will use their best
endeavors to facilitate

00:09:20.408 --> 00:09:22.328
"the achievement of this objective.

00:09:22.328 --> 00:09:25.046
"It being clearly understood
that nothing shall be done

00:09:25.046 --> 00:09:27.718
"which may prejudice the
civil and religious rights

00:09:27.718 --> 00:09:31.086
"of existing non-Jewish
communities in Palestine,

00:09:31.086 --> 00:09:34.285
"or the rights and political
status enjoyed by Jews

00:09:34.285 --> 00:09:35.868
"in any other country.

00:09:35.868 --> 00:09:37.204
"I should be grateful if you would bring

00:09:37.204 --> 00:09:38.832
"this declaration to the knowledge of the

00:09:38.832 --> 00:09:40.275
"Zionist Federation."

00:09:40.275 --> 00:09:42.415
Signed Artur Balfour.

00:09:42.415 --> 00:09:44.196
In here, he's not explicitly saying ...

00:09:44.196 --> 00:09:45.780
and they're being very careful here,

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:49.502
he's not saying we're supporting a state

00:09:49.502 --> 00:09:51.000
for the Jewish people, but he's saying

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.513
he is supporting the
return of national home

00:09:53.513 --> 00:09:55.010
for the Jewish people,
but at the same time,

00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:57.035
he's saying that it
being clearly understood

00:09:57.035 --> 00:09:59.237
that nothing shall be
done which may prejudice

00:09:59.237 --> 00:10:01.025
the civil and religious
rights of the existing

00:10:01.025 --> 00:10:02.825
non-Jewish communities in Palestine.

00:10:02.825 --> 00:10:05.293
Needless to say, you
can imagine that this is

00:10:05.293 --> 00:10:08.255
making the Arab's fairly uncomfortable.

00:10:08.255 --> 00:10:10.983
On one side it seems, based on some of the

00:10:10.983 --> 00:10:14.541
McMahon-Hussein
correspondences that were ...

00:10:14.541 --> 00:10:17.241
especially in 1915, that
they were being promised

00:10:17.241 --> 00:10:19.414
an independent Arab state which included

00:10:19.414 --> 00:10:21.561
much of this territory,
but at the same time,

00:10:21.561 --> 00:10:23.742
in the Balfour Declaration
the British were promising

00:10:23.742 --> 00:10:27.593
to, kind of the Jewish diaspora,

00:10:27.593 --> 00:10:29.304
that they could have a homeland there

00:10:29.304 --> 00:10:31.845
and it might one day, who
knows, it might one day

00:10:31.845 --> 00:10:34.534
turn in to some type of a state.

00:10:34.534 --> 00:10:36.524
To make the Arab's even
more uncomfortable,

00:10:36.524 --> 00:10:39.267
this was in November 2, 1917.

00:10:39.267 --> 00:10:40.992
By the end of November,
you have to remember

00:10:40.992 --> 00:10:44.357
that 1917 you first had a revolution,

00:10:44.357 --> 00:10:46.332
in Russia the Czar was
overthrown in February

00:10:46.332 --> 00:10:48.747
and in March of 1917, and October

00:10:48.747 --> 00:10:50.339
the Bolshevik's take over.

00:10:50.339 --> 00:10:52.691
They want to get out of the war,

00:10:52.691 --> 00:10:53.995
they don't like all these secret deals,

00:10:53.995 --> 00:10:56.260
not clear that they
would even get what they

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:57.348
were entitled to these secret deals,

00:10:57.348 --> 00:11:00.430
so they actually release
all the entire text

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:02.694
of the Sykes-Picot Agreement.

00:11:02.694 --> 00:11:04.025
They released this, so in the same month

00:11:04.025 --> 00:11:06.479
you have the Arab's and the Ottoman's

00:11:06.479 --> 00:11:08.029
and the Ottoman's were
very happy to see this

00:11:08.029 --> 00:11:12.494
because it would undermine
the Arab's belief

00:11:12.494 --> 00:11:14.354
in maybe supporting the allies,

00:11:14.354 --> 00:11:16.904
but in one month you have
the Arab's finding out

00:11:16.904 --> 00:11:18.764
about the Balfour Declaration,
which was a pulbic

00:11:18.764 --> 00:11:20.439
declaration and then later that month

00:11:20.439 --> 00:11:22.861
because of the Russian release of it,

00:11:22.861 --> 00:11:25.680
the formally secret Sykes-Picot Agreement,

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:28.026
so it makes them very,
or at least a little bit

00:11:28.026 --> 00:11:29.408
more suspicious.

00:11:29.408 --> 00:11:33.040
So you can imagine the British Empire

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:35.041
trying to have it both
ways, to kind of have

00:11:35.041 --> 00:11:37.255
support from the Jewish Diaspora

00:11:37.255 --> 00:11:39.699
while at the same time have
support from the Arab's

00:11:39.699 --> 00:11:41.596
in their revolt against the Ottoman's

00:11:41.596 --> 00:11:44.069
would lead to very significant conflicts

00:11:44.069 --> 00:11:45.849
over the decades to come.

00:11:45.849 --> 00:11:47.625
Regardless of which side
of the issue you fall on,

00:11:47.625 --> 00:11:51.012
a lot of the seed is
happening right around now,

00:11:51.012 --> 00:11:52.358
right around World War I.

00:11:52.358 --> 00:11:54.544
This has been admitted by
the British government.

00:11:54.544 --> 00:11:57.633
This is right here, this was the then

00:11:57.633 --> 00:11:59.670
Secretary, or Foreign
Secretary Jack Straw,

00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:01.691
U.K Foreign Secretary in 2002.

00:12:01.691 --> 00:12:03.831
This is a statement he made to the

00:12:03.831 --> 00:12:07.095
News Statesman Magazine in 2002.

00:12:07.095 --> 00:12:09.615
"A lot of the problems we
are having to deal with now,

00:12:09.615 --> 00:12:11.365
"I have to deal with now,"

00:12:11.365 --> 00:12:12.996
he's the Foreign Secretary,
"are a consequence

00:12:12.996 --> 00:12:14.667
"of our colonial past ..."

00:12:14.667 --> 00:12:16.563
Consequence of our colonial past.

00:12:16.563 --> 00:12:19.332
"The Balfour Declaration
and the contradictory

00:12:19.332 --> 00:12:22.116
assurances," "and the
contradictory assurances

00:12:22.116 --> 00:12:25.313
"which were being given to Palestinian's

00:12:25.313 --> 00:12:27.519
"in private at the same time as they were

00:12:27.519 --> 00:12:29.154
"being given to the Israelis ...

00:12:29.154 --> 00:12:32.597
"again, an interesting history for us,

00:12:32.597 --> 00:12:34.419
"but not an honorable one."

00:12:34.419 --> 00:12:35.572
This is really just the beginning

00:12:35.572 --> 00:12:37.591
as we'll see in future
videos as we go to the

00:12:37.591 --> 00:12:41.577
Interwar period, the British
kind of go back and forth

00:12:41.577 --> 00:12:44.610
on this issue over, over, and over again,

00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:47.595
but needless to say,
it's lead to a very messy

00:12:47.595 --> 00:12:50.917
situation in the modern Middle East.
