00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:02.440
You should definitely speak two languages.

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:06.060
Partly because speaking another language makes
you think more rationally, but also because

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.130
sexy accents make people totally irrational.

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:17.060
Hola everyone, I’m Julian and willkomen,
bienvenue, welcome to DNews.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.660
Before we start I want to pose to you a question.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.289
Lets say I gave you 15 dollars and then started
flipping a coin.

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:28.760
Lets say you had the choice to bet a dollar
each time, and if you win you get a dollar

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.770
and 50 cents, but if you lose I take your
dollar.

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.149
How often would you bet?

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:38.460
It seems straightforward, but your answer
probably depends on where you’re from.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.649
More specifically, it probably depends on
whether or not I asked you that question in

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:43.879
your native language.

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:48.469
The science says if you speak english, you
probably bet about 54% of the time.

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:52.149
But I know there’s a lot of you from outside
the U.S. because I get a lot of angry comments

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:56.339
every time I use the imperial system, and
if you’re from a non-english speaking country

00:00:56.339 --> 00:00:59.409
you probably bet about 72% of the time.

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:04.199
Well you’re gonna hate this my fellow Americans,
but betting every time is the right choice.

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.250
Statistically speaking you’re almost definitely
going to be making money in the long term.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.810
So why did native english speakers pick wrong
more often?

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.990
Well the current hypothesis is having to think
in a foreign language requires more cognitive

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.090
power, and by having to think it through more
thoroughly, you’re more likely to make a

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.100
rational decision.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.659
This experiment was first done by researchers
from the University of Chicago in 2012.

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:30.070
It took place on 3 continents and participants
were english-speakers who had learned japanese,

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.520
french or spanish; and Koreans who had learned
english.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.530
So it’s not like it’s just english speakers
who declined to bet more, it really does depend

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.869
if you’re asked to bet in your mother tongue.

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.210
The researchers extrapolated this information
to more common scenarios.

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.659
One researcher, Albert Costa, mused that maybe
this is why people switch to their native

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:52.649
language in a heated argument, and maybe that’s
also why they tend to say more hurtful things

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.820
they’re going to regret after the switch.

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.319
The researchers also didn’t believe that
the cognitive improvement is lessened with

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:03.030
proficiency, noting that when people understand
complex nuances of languages like idioms,

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.609
taboo words, and expressions of love, they
still react less emotionally.

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:12.820
This just adds another reason to the long,
long list of why being bilingual is awesome.

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.590
And yes the delayed onset of alzheimers is
rad, and being able to survive in a foreign

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.540
land is cool, but I’m telling you dude,
chicks dig accents.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.900
So does being bilingual make you smarter or
does being smarter make you better at languages?

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.500
Trace and our guest Alice have the answer
to that over here.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.280
And did you bet when I posed you that question?

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.640
Or have you learned a second language and
noticed a difference in how you think?

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.590
I’m always interested in hearing about stuff
like this because I grew up in America and

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.550
I’m just now getting the hang of speaking
the english talk.

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.730
So let us know in the comments and I’ll
see you next time on DNews
