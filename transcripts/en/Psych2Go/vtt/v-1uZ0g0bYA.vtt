00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.890
Narcissism is a serious personality disorder
that has many damaging effects.

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:10.320
It seems like common sense to stay away from
those who exhibit excessive selfish behavior,

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.590
but what if they're your own parents?

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.940
Here are Seven Subtle Signs of Narcissistic
Parenting.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.970
Number one: They're self-centered and make
you join the show too.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.539
Everyone is self-cautious and cares to a certain
degree what other people think about them,

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.010
that's human nature.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.050
But do you ever wonder why your parents act
so differently at home than they're out in

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.500
public?

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.960
Even for narcissist, their slips and the mask
comes off.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.180
Narcissistic parents take pride in flaunting
their social status, physical appearance,

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.580
material possessions and accomplishments.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:48.060
But when they no longer have an audience once
they pull up in the driveway, they stop with

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.960
the nice act. They either criticize or talk
about others behind their back.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.520
Number two: You can't receive gifts without
feeling like there're strings attached.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.090
Giving presents is supposed to be a selfless
deed.

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.460
It's about celebrating the other person's
who's receiving the gift; whether it's on

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.700
their birthday, graduation or just because.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.290
So why does it feel like there are consequences
when you receive one from a narcissist?

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.240
The narcissistic parent knows how to guilt
trip you if you don't love or use their gift.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.840
And when it comes to buying presents for them,
forget having to brainstorm, they usually

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.850
tell you or demand for what they want in return.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:31.170
Number three: When you try to set boundaries,
they get offensive.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.799
If there's one thing a narcissistic parent
loves is control.

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:35.829
Why?

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:39.570
Because treating the child like an equal would
mean they aren't superior or above them.

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.270
If you live with a narcissistic parent, some
of these might sound familiar; they go through

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.479
your room without your permission and throw
away some of your possessions.

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:54.470
They dictate your extracurricular activities
or classes you can take and they set unrealistic

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.950
expectations on you without hearing what you
have to say first.

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:03.759
But when you do stand up for yourself, they
get easily hurt or are offensive and use excuses

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:09.619
like; it was just spring cleaning or I’m
just doing what's best for you.

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.450
Number four: You feel like you're their puppet
more than you are their child.

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.010
Dress-up and make-believe is fun as a kid,
but narcissistic mothers take that to a whole

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.500
‘nother serious level.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.510
Patients of narcissistic parents were interviewed
by psychologists and one of them said her

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:31.090
mom used to love dolling her up in cute dresses
even though she was a tomboy by nature.

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.080
She believe that [?] her mom's
self-worth when she will receive compliments

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.750
for her parents.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.879
Under eyes of a narcissistic parent, the child
acts as a medium they can live through.

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:47.040
This is how the child's individuality becomes
diminished, replacing it with their own selfish

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.500
desires.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.080
Number five: They feel hurt when you don't
include them in your decisions.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.900
Psychotherapist Daniel Sobel says that a narcissistic
parent operates from self-protection, and

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.671
if the ego is bruised or they feel the decision
was made they could not control, they become

00:03:03.671 --> 00:03:05.970
cruel, blaming and offensive.

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:11.260
A healthy parent decides how many sweets their
child can have after dinner but a narcissistic

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:17.019
parent will want to govern everything; what
kind of career you can have, who you can date

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:18.900
and when you can move out.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.300
Nothing scares them more than when we start
thinking for yourself and no longer need their

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:25.310
validation.

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.330
Number six: You feel like you can't make good
decisions without them.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:35.060
Narcissistic parenting creates a codependent
relationship between the parent and child.

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.209
This can make the child anxious and feel lost
without the parents help.

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.200
But that's exactly what they want.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.870
Often, the child will grow feeling confused
and invalidated when their thoughts and feelings

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:47.950
were ignored.

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:53.090
Often, the child will grow up feeling confused
and invalidated when their thoughts and feelings

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:54.200
were ignored.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.040
Although going through puberty is already
a dizzying experience, a narcissistic parent

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.769
will make sure to tear down your self-identity
too, leaving you feeling more helpless than

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:04.769
ever.

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:10.060
By doing this, they make me depend on them
to feel your own self-worth.

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.750
Number seven: They know how to turn the table
and play the victim.

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:20.000
No matter how reasonable or logical your argument
is, the narcissistic parent will find a way

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.240
to manipulate you and point fingers.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.960
Narcissists never take responsibility for
their actions and marginalize your needs and

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.020
feelings.

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.860
This is how they play mind games with you,
but they get off easy because they play their

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.500
victim card well.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.030
Not anymore though, now that you know about
these signs, you no longer have to participate

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:39.520
in the cruelty.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.320
