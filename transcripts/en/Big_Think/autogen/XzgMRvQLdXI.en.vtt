now the paradox is but wait a minute if

the world is flat why are people moving

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610
the world is flat why are people moving
 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.980
the world is flat why are people moving
more and more rapidly into cities you

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990
more and more rapidly into cities you
 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.410
more and more rapidly into cities you
know and I think that at the end of the

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420
know and I think that at the end of the
 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.840
know and I think that at the end of the
day there's there's elements of truth in

both of these but I what is driving and

both of these but I what is driving and

both of these but I what is driving and
from our perspective this movement into

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180
from our perspective this movement into
 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.330
from our perspective this movement into
cities there are many many factors at

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340
cities there are many many factors at
 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.510
cities there are many many factors at
work but one of them is I think a lot of

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520
work but one of them is I think a lot of

us have an intuitive sense that we're
 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.710
us have an intuitive sense that we're
going to learn faster in a city

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720
going to learn faster in a city
 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.719
going to learn faster in a city
surrounded by other people that have

similar a complementary talents to us
 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:44.510
similar a complementary talents to us
but we're gonna learn much faster than

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520
but we're gonna learn much faster than
 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.280
but we're gonna learn much faster than
in that kind of environment than we

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290
in that kind of environment than we
 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.310
in that kind of environment than we
would out in some rural area even if we

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320
would out in some rural area even if we
 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.880
would out in some rural area even if we
can plug in to the network and connect

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890
can plug in to the network and connect
 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.100
can plug in to the network and connect
virtually with anybody we want that

virtually with anybody we want that
notion in particular of these unexpected

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110
notion in particular of these unexpected
 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.980
notion in particular of these unexpected
encounters that you have in cities you

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990
encounters that you have in cities you
 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.020
encounters that you have in cities you
know walking down the street sitting in

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030
know walking down the street sitting in
 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.510
know walking down the street sitting in
a coffee shop at the soccer game with

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520
a coffee shop at the soccer game with
 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.570
a coffee shop at the soccer game with
your kids talking to somebody that you

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580
your kids talking to somebody that you
 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.510
your kids talking to somebody that you
never knew before but when you strike up

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520
never knew before but when you strike up
 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.940
never knew before but when you strike up
a conversation comes up

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950
a conversation comes up
 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.250
a conversation comes up
the really interesting insight helps you

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260
the really interesting insight helps you
 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.540
the really interesting insight helps you
to get through a problem you've been

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550
to get through a problem you've been
 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.610
to get through a problem you've been
wrestling with those kinds of

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620
wrestling with those kinds of
 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.690
wrestling with those kinds of
opportunities occur much more richly and

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700
opportunities occur much more richly and
 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.930
opportunities occur much more richly and
frequently in cities than they do in

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940
frequently in cities than they do in
 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.540
frequently in cities than they do in
rural areas so I think at least

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550
rural areas so I think at least
 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.880
rural areas so I think at least
intuitively we have a sense that with

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890
intuitively we have a sense that with
 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.470
intuitively we have a sense that with
all that digital technology

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480
all that digital technology
 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.030
all that digital technology
infrastructure and all the ability to

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040
infrastructure and all the ability to
 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.309
infrastructure and all the ability to
connect we're gonna be much better off

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319
connect we're gonna be much better off
 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:40.150
connect we're gonna be much better off
learn faster in cities than we could on

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160
learn faster in cities than we could on
 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.220
learn faster in cities than we could on
our own and we have again an intuitive

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230
our own and we have again an intuitive
 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.729
our own and we have again an intuitive
sense that learning faster is becoming

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739
sense that learning faster is becoming
 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:47.410
sense that learning faster is becoming
more and more important but no matter

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420
more and more important but no matter
 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.360
more and more important but no matter
how much skill we have how much talent

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370
how much skill we have how much talent
 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.780
how much skill we have how much talent
we have at this point in time if we

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790
we have at this point in time if we
 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.610
we have at this point in time if we
don't continue to develop that talent

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620
don't continue to develop that talent
 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.830
don't continue to develop that talent
and skill we're gonna become vulnerable

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840
and skill we're gonna become vulnerable
 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.370
and skill we're gonna become vulnerable
and so that's a powerful motivation to

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380
and so that's a powerful motivation to
 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.410
and so that's a powerful motivation to
come into cities and to stay in two

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420
come into cities and to stay in two
 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.690
come into cities and to stay in two
