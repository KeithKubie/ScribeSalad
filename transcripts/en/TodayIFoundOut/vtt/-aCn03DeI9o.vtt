00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:05.540
The date was April 3, 1919.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.780
The location was the South Side Pavilion in
sunny Jacksonville, Florida.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.660
The occasion was a much-hyped competition
of gastronomical strength between Ping Bodie,

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:20.259
the five foot eight and 190 pound New York
Yankee outfielder, versus the “world’s

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:23.449
greatest eater,” an ostrich named Percy.

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:27.529
They were to engage in a spaghetti-eating
contest to determine, once and for all, who

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:31.630
was Earth’s most prolific eater- man or
ostrich.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.670
But before we recap how Bodie fared when he
went beak to beak with his feathered foe,

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.910
let’s see how we got here – to how and
why a baseball player named Ping Bodie faced

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.679
an ostrich in a spaghetti eating contest.

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:49.609
Ping Bodie was actually born Francito Sanguenitta
Pezzolo to an Italian-American immigrant family

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:52.810
in San Francisco on October 8, 1887.

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:57.910
There seems to be several different tales
on how Francito earned the name “Ping Bodie.”

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.559
Bodie himself said once that the name came
from a family friend who had been nicknamed

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.879
that, but didn’t like it and pawned it off
to little Francito.

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.070
Other stories claim that he received the nickname
because that was the sound the ball made as

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.150
it came off his mammoth 52 ounce bat, though
of course wood bats don’t make that noise,

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.000
so we’ll trust Francito on this one.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.970
As for the surname “Bodie,” Ping’s brother,
Dave, explained in a February, 1912 letter

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.050
to the editor of the magazine Sporting Life
that “Ping” wanted to change his name

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.970
to something less ethnic because he felt was
going to be“ridiculed.”

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.430
After all, he was one of the first Italian-Americans
to reach the major leagues.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.750
So, he chose Bodie – the name of a silver
mining town known for its salons and gunfights

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.080
that his father and uncle lived in for a time.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.080
W.O.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.530
McGeehan, the famous New York Herald Tribune
sports writer who also originally hailed from

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.470
San Francisco, claimed that Bodie built up
his strength at an early age by rolling heavy

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.670
rocks down Telegraph Hill to “keep their
territory free from invaders.”

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.660
Ping was a slugger from the start, beginning
his professional baseball career in the California

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.960
League in 1908 and then joining the legendary
San Francisco Seals (the DiMaggios played

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.780
for them as well, albeit 24 years later) in
1909.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.130
He was called up by the Chicago White Sox
in 1911 when the owner, Charles Comiskey,

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.129
complained the Sox weren’t hitting; Bodie
went into his office and told him, “You

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:11.039
want some hitting, put me in the lineup.”

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.010
He did and Bodie hit, earning the nickname
“Fence-Buster.”

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.870
He soon clashed with with the White Sox manager
and was traded back to the Seals before finding

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.010
his way to the Philadelphia A’s, where he
once told the press that the A’s were so

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.270
bad that “I and the Liberty Bell are the
only attractions in Philadelphia.”

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.710
Always modest, he was finally traded to the
New York Yankees.

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:35.510
As you might guess from all this, Bodie was
naturally gregarious and loved being the center

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:36.510
of attention.

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.740
So, he was paired up with another larger than
life personality as a roommate – Babe Ruth.

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:46.720
The Babe was, already by then, well-known
for his tendency to hit the town.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:52.410
So, when a reporter asked Ping what was it
like to room with the biggest star in the

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.790
game, his response was honest, “I room with
his suitcase.”

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.650
He’s also credited as being the inspiration
for the ballplayer in the book (and, eventually,

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.030
comic strip) You Know Me Al by Ring Lardner.

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.540
The book consisted of “letters” written
by a fictitious White Sox pitcher named Jack

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:07.760
Keefe to his friend.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.940
In the letters, he reveals to Al all the shenanigans
that went with being a baseball player and

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.530
his obliviousness to the fact that he was
being taken advantage of by everyone around

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:17.530
him.

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.750
As for Percy, he was probably Jacksonville’s
most famous ostrich.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.490
He had been touted by the Jacksonville Chamber
of Commerce as the “world’s greatest eater,”

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:27.920
likely as a way to promote the city’s zoo,
which had only opened five years prior in

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:28.920
1914.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.240
In fact, Jacksonville was in the midst of
it’s run as the “Winter Film Capital of

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.240
the World.”

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.750
Before Los Angeles became the center of movie
production, silent movies were filmed either

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.300
in New York during the summer months or Jacksonville,
Florida in the winter.

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.580
It’s warm climate, exotic-looking locations,
rail access, and cheap labor encouraged over

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.990
thirty silent film studios to be established
in the small northeast Florida city during

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.990
that time.

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:52.790
Additionally, Jacksonville had been home to
spring training baseball since 1898 and the

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.100
residents loved having the ballplayers in
town.

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.780
So, when the co-owner of the Yankees, Colonel
T.L.

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:03.180
(Cap) Huston, heard that the city was touting
their long and slender ostrich as the best

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.470
eater in the world, he knew they would play
along when he offered up a challenger in the

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:07.910
form of Ping Bodie.

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.530
The match wasn’t widely advertised due to
the fear that it would arouse anger from animal

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:17.430
lovers, but by all accounts the local Jacksonville
hall was packed with spectators for the vent.

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.859
Bodie, given that he was the challenger, was
allowed to choose the food.

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:22.569
Percy raised no objection.

00:04:22.569 --> 00:04:24.919
Bodie’s choice was spaghetti.

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:29.270
Members of Jacksonville’s Chamber of Commerce
who had wagered quite heavily on Percy did

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.809
not like this pick.

00:04:30.809 --> 00:04:34.569
After the first three bowls, man and ostrich
were neck and neck.

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:38.129
It was said that Percy “gobbled his third
bowl of spaghetti with such gusto that he

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:42.419
accidentally swallowed (the manager’s) pocket
watch and chain while the manager was timing

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:43.419
him.”

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:45.960
By the fourth bowl, “Percy’s sides had
begun to swell visibly.”

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:52.039
At the sixth bowl, several female spectators
headed for the exit not wanting to see what

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:53.440
would happen to the poor bird.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.960
By the eighth bowl, it was becoming clear
that Bodie was going to win the battle.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.280
But, still, the bird kept going.

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.469
During the tenth bowl of spaghetti, a spectator
supposedly yelled “Do you want your bird

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:04.469
killed?”

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:08.650
Finally, as Percy ate his eleventh bowl of
pasta, he stopped eating, staggered off and

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:09.650
collapsed.

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:13.599
Bodie finished his bowl, emerging the victor,
supposedly stating “When the timekeeper

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:17.669
counted to ten, the ostrich keeled over, never
to rise again.”

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:20.349
The ostrich supposedly died.

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:23.779
Of course, whether that’s exactly what really
happened or that the victory was slightly

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:27.180
embellished by those covering the event for
effect is up for debate.

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:31.860
For instance, I’m *guessing* Percy didn’t
actually eat the manager’s watch.

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.469
And it seems odd that the ostrich would choose
to eat itself to death, rather than just stop

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:37.819
when it was full up.

00:05:37.819 --> 00:05:41.960
But an ostrich staggering away and keeling
over does make for a better story than one

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.430
that simply stops eating.

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:47.449
For reference, ostriches typically eat about
8 pounds of food per day, processing it in

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:50.979
their three stomachs, including a gizzard
which seemingly would have little trouble

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:52.069
grinding up pasta.

00:05:52.069 --> 00:05:56.770
Their gizzard can hold at any given time about
2-4 pounds, nearly half of which is generally

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:59.189
rocks and sand used for grinding the food.

00:05:59.189 --> 00:06:02.600
They also aren’t super picky about what
they eat, consuming plants, seeds, roots,

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.539
insects, and small animals- pretty much whatever
plant or animal they can fit in their gullet,

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:07.550
they may try to eat if they feel so inclined.

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:12.070
Whether the ostrich actually died from the
event or not, reports all agree that Bodie

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:17.009
won (possibly more to do with lack of competitive
spirit in the ostrich than that Bodie’s

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:18.860
stomach could hold more than the ostrich’s.

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:22.819
But perhaps the massive amount of pasta really
didn’t agree with Percy’s digestive system

00:06:22.819 --> 00:06:24.169
in some severe way.

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:27.949
Given ostriches eat grains just fine, this
seems unlikely though.

00:06:27.949 --> 00:06:31.569
Any ostrich experts out there, please do ring
in on this one in the comments below).

00:06:31.569 --> 00:06:35.919
Bodie made his last Major League Baseball
appearance with the New York Yankees in 1921.

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:40.509
He played for several more seasons for his
hometown Seals until retiring for good and

00:06:40.509 --> 00:06:42.240
moving south, to Los Angeles.

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:46.650
He became a Hollywood electrician mostly on
the Universal Lot and even dabbled in acting

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:47.650
in a few films.

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:51.819
He was rumored to be friends with many members
of Hollywood royalty, including Carole Lombard

00:06:51.819 --> 00:06:53.560
and Lon Chaney Jr.

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:58.069
To the day he died, in 1961, he still loved
talking about how he could “whale the old

00:06:58.069 --> 00:07:00.159
apple and smack the old onion.”

00:07:00.159 --> 00:07:02.499
Presumably, this means hitting a baseball.

00:07:02.499 --> 00:07:15.090
But to others he will always be known as the
ball player who beat an ostrich in a spaghetti-eating

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:22.999
contest.
