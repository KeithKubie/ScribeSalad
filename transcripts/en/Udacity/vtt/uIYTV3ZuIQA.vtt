What do I mean by multiplicity? Well, we've seen with class models,

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:08.050
that we can adorn the associations, with stars and numbers and

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:12.800
so on. And this indicates, how the number of instances of one class,

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.179
is related to the number of instances in another class. For example,

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:22.070
we could have 1 to 1 associations, like spouses. Okay,

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:27.690
we could have 1-m, 1 to multiple associations, like a parent and

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:32.549
the parent's children. Or we could have m to n,

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:36.690
multiple to multiple associations, like we might have between students and

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.110
courses. That is, a student could take multiple courses, and a course could have

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.870
multiple students in it. There's the ability in UML to express each of those

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:53.140
possibilities by, adorning the ends of the association with numbers or stars and

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.330
so on. In UML, when multiplicity is used,

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:03.990
the result of navigating is some kind of collection. It might be a set.

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:09.980
It might be a bag, it might be a sequence. And, UML, and

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:14.870
OCL in particular, has a notation, that allows you to po,

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.760
perform operations on those collections. The notation is

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.380
a hyphen followed by a greater than. You can think of this as an arrow.
