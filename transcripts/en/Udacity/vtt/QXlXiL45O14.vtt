00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.380
Viruses is perhaps the best
known type of malware.

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.080
A virus infects a program,
by modifying the program code so

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.530
that when a program runs,
the virus code also runs.

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:17.180
It then self-copy into other programs,
and thus, spreads itself.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.350
There are many four stages in
the life cycle of a virus.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:23.910
The first is a dormant phase.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.240
This is the phase when a program has
just been infected by a virus but

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.119
program has not run yet so the virus
has not been triggered or spread.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.250
The second stage is propagation.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.790
This is when the malware's
being sent around or spread.

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.880
For example, the malware can
come as an email attachment and

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.070
the email attachment is
being sent to many users.

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.420
The third phase is the triggering phase.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.270
This is when the host
program is being run.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.730
And as a result,
the virus is also triggered to run.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.230
For example, when a user clicks an email
attachment that contains a virus,

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.960
it's triggering
the virus to run as well.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.550
The fourth stage is the execution phase.

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:09.220
This is when the virus code runs,
performs some malicious activities, and

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.270
most importantly, it looks for
targets to infect so that it can spread.

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.805
For example,
in a case of email attachment,

00:01:16.805 --> 00:01:21.330
when the virus runs it can search for
users in the address book, and

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.650
then send email attachment with
the virus to users in the address book.

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.340
And that's how he can be propagated,
triggered, executed, and

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.760
again propagated,
triggered, and executed.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.940
And this is how virus spreads
