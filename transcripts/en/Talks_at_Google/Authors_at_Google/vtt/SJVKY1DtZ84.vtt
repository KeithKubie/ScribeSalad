[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.478 --> 00:00:08.964
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:08.964 --> 00:00:12.990
JEREMY HYLTON: So I
just finished the book

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:19.740
over the weekend, and I really
appreciated all the stories.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.770
You have been
firsthand participant

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.500
and talked to lots
of other people

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.120
who are about the evolution
of this from a crazy idea

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.450
that a handful of
small teams worked on.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.240
And so I really
loved all the stories

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.210
and just getting to know
the peoples, someone

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.890
you might hear
about in the news.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.910
And I just loved the way
you told the stories.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.280
So I thought since this
is-- we're at Google--

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.110
this is a book about
the driverless car,

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.660
maybe a fun story
to jump into would

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.410
be to tell everybody a
little about your first ride

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.374
in a chauffeur car.

00:00:56.374 --> 00:00:58.290
LAWRENCE D. BURNS: Yeah,
I'm happy to do that.

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.060
And thanks, everybody,
for coming today.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.420
It's a real pleasure.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.440
It's a pleasure to be part
of your team actually.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.700
I was at General
Motors until 2009.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.960
We had competed in the DARPA
Urban Challenge in 2007.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.410
That was a race of robotic
cars, and the first prize

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:17.490
was $2 million dollars.

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.320
And GM was starting to
hit the wall at that time,

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.590
so I figured we
needed the money.

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.090
We better go out
and win this race.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.100
[LAUGHING]

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.130
But we sponsored
Carnegie Mellon's team

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.840
and Chris Urmson, who
subsequently led this program

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.020
for Google self-driving
cars, reached out to me

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.980
after I left GM.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.950
They were looking for a
gray-beard auto executive

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.330
that could help them out.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.960
So I came out in 2010.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.850
The deal was I'd come
out and talk to them

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.050
if I could ride in the car.

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.250
And they had 13 Priuses, and
it was remarkable progress.

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.470
Because at the
Urban Challenge, we

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.470
had a Chevy Tahoe sport
utility vehicle that

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.365
was just loaded with hardware.

00:01:58.365 --> 00:02:01.590
You could barely squeeze
one person into the vehicle.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.160
And by the time they were doing
the testing in 2009 and '10,

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.990
they had it in a Prius.

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.120
Most of all the hardware
was in the trunk

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.760
of the Prius plus the
sensors on the outside.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.900
So at that time could ride
on 101 in the vehicle.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.150
And it's basically
an Expressway.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.440
So I drove the car out.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.470
I had a technician next to
me in the passenger seat,

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.180
and I had an engineer
in the back seat,

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.070
and I had a big red panic
button on the console.

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:31.110
So this is late
2010, early 2011,

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.970
and they said,
OK, just engage it

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.380
like you would cruise control.

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.210
I was in the middle
lane of the freeway,

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.580
and my hands are shaking
over the steering wheel.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:39.640
My feet are shaking.

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.370
I'm thinking this is crazy.

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.070
But once I engaged it
within about a couple

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.000
of minutes, Jeremy, it
started feeling natural.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.530
The car was intuitive even
at that point in time.

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.630
A Volkswagen Beetle
came up on my left

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.714
and cut it in front of me, and
I realized the car I was in

00:02:54.714 --> 00:02:56.130
had already backed
off and started

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.030
to create a gap for that
vehicle to get into.

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.650
And you would never be able
to do that as a driver.

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.899
This technology is like
eagle-eye vision with eyes

00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:04.940
in the back of your head.

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.125
Later on, a big semi
truck came up on my right,

00:03:07.125 --> 00:03:09.900
and sure enough my car
was nudging over a bit.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.950
But what I found so fascinating
was after the first 10 minutes,

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.990
I was so relaxed, I
was even worried about

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:17.830
whether traffic backed
up in front of me.

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.788
I never thought about
jumping to the right lane

00:03:19.788 --> 00:03:22.230
or left lane to get
in front of someone.

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.190
It just took all the road rage
and stress out of driving.

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:26.640
So I was sold.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.340
And that was a remarkable
accomplishment and just

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.770
a real testament to how good
this team was that you had

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.000
at Google self-driving cars.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.517
JEREMY HYLTON: Yeah, it was
really striking to hear the--

00:03:36.517 --> 00:03:38.100
there's a story you
tell about I think

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.445
riding in one of the early
Carnegie Mellon cars.

00:03:41.445 --> 00:03:43.560
LAWRENCE D. BURNS:
Yeah, well, I--

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.280
because General Motors was the
sponsor of the Carnegie Mellon

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.850
boss--

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.180
we call the boss
La Chevy Tahoe--

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.750
I thought it was
important that I--

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:52.860
being head of R&amp;D--

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.860
go out and put in an appearance
and get to know the team.

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.890
We had some of our engineers
embedded with the team.

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.480
And so I went out,
and they handed out

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.010
on their test track,
which was a real old steel

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.650
plant that had been--

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.395
they just grabbed it
and started using.

00:04:08.395 --> 00:04:10.270
I don't know if they
had permission to do it,

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.360
but it was rutted
roads and everything.

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.520
And they were showing
me how the vehicle

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.720
would operate autonomously.

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.140
And I said I'd
like a ride in it.

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.980
And they looked
at me and smiled.

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.509
They didn't say no, but
I said, yeah, I really

00:04:22.509 --> 00:04:23.550
would like to ride in it.

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.730
So they squeeze me in that one
area that you could fit into.

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:30.390
Well, this vehicle wasn't
designed for a human.

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.030
This vehicle was designed
to run a self-driving car.

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.510
So it accelerated very
aggressively, stopped very

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.370
aggressively, cornered
very aggressively.

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.006
And within about 30 seconds,
I'm getting so carsick,

00:04:42.006 --> 00:04:44.820
and they're all laughing
about this because they really

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:45.940
put one over on me.

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.340
But that was an important point.

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.090
The Carnegie Mellon
team felt that by being

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:54.000
an aggressive driver, we were
more like an X Games athlete

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.440
in this competition.

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.690
We knew Stanford was going to
be more like figure skater.

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.260
And they were going to have a
really smooth, nice, precise

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:05.400
vehicle.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.920
But we knew enough
about the race

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.730
that we thought we could pick
up six minutes by accelerating

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:10.780
hard and braking hard.

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.810
And we won the
race by 20 minutes,

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:14.707
so that was an important
part of our car.

00:05:14.707 --> 00:05:15.540
JEREMY HYLTON: Yeah.

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:16.360
Yeah.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.480
You mentioned riding in the
chauffeur car the first time.

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:23.350
You pretty quickly were relaxed
and not worried about things.

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:26.810
Then you comment
that there actually--

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:28.240
they're different
strategies being

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.420
pursued in the marketplace
today about how do we

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:34.400
deploy this technology, how do
we bring it to a mass audience?

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:39.130
And one is this
driver-assist version,

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.380
and the other is
more of a service.

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:43.972
And you observe that--

00:05:43.972 --> 00:05:44.680
what did you say?

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.710
I think that the
driver-assist version

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:50.887
says you don't need to
pay attention to the road.

00:05:50.887 --> 00:05:52.470
Except that because
it's an assistant,

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:55.780
it also says you need to be
paying attention at all times

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.010
in order to take over.

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:58.810
And I wonder if
you want to comment

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:00.297
a little bit about that.

00:06:00.297 --> 00:06:02.380
LAWRENCE D. BURNS: The
Google the self-driving car

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:05.280
team I think made two
really big decisions.

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.080
They made a lot of great
decisions, but early on they

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.580
made the decision
that they wanted

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:12.400
to create a car that
didn't rely on what's

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.070
called vehicle-to-vehicle
or vehicle-to-infrastructure

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:16.360
communication.

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.190
So a lot of people
on this field thought

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:20.330
that if you get cars
talking to each other,

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.360
they could avoid each other.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.000
But I think the Google
self-driving car

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.860
team realized that you'd
have to have all cars capable

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.200
and would take forever
to get to that point.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.890
They also believe because
of your background mapping

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:35.530
and because of their knowledge
of the sensors that they

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:38.710
could actually do a
standalone self-driving car.

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:41.440
And that was
critically important.

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:44.027
They began to develop this
technology that I experienced

00:06:44.027 --> 00:06:45.610
on the freeway, and
they thought maybe

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:48.730
they could do an initial
product called a highway assist.

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:51.460
And they did a dog
fooding exercise

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:54.990
with the local Mountain
View Google employees,

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:57.040
asked them to use the
vehicle on weekends.

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.350
They had to promise to pay
attention to their driving,

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:01.308
but they could take it
to Lake Tahoe and stuff.

00:07:01.308 --> 00:07:04.060
Well, lo and behold,
within the first few weeks,

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:08.080
we realized that these people
were totally distracted.

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.264
One individual even fell asleep.

00:07:10.264 --> 00:07:12.430
And you would never have
been able to re-engage them

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:14.630
if something came up.

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:16.570
And Nathaniel
Fairfield on a team,

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:18.380
he reached an
important conclusion

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:19.630
I think shared with all of us.

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:22.540
He said, if we always keep
the driver in the loop,

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:24.640
we're never going to be
safer than the driver.

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:28.000
Ninety percent of the crashes
are due to human error,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.900
so they concluded these
driver assist, Jeremy, was not

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:33.430
consistent with
their goal, which

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:36.550
was to eliminate car
crashes all together

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:39.340
and made the second
really important decision

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:42.280
their commitment was
to totally autonomous

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:44.650
where a person would never
be asked to take over.

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:46.930
Now you can imagine
what a challenge that

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:50.890
is because you have to discover
all those really unusual things

00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:53.740
that happen in everyday
driving or every year

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:57.310
driving, the long
tail, and that's

00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:00.900
part of what's going on right
now is it's continued learning.

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:03.370
But it's also part of the
reason why Waymo has such a head

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:05.080
start on everyone
because they've

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:07.070
been doing this a long time.

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:09.852
And they've accumulated
a lot of experience.

00:08:09.852 --> 00:08:13.345
JEREMY HYLTON: I was curious
as far as reducing the fatality

00:08:13.345 --> 00:08:14.110
rate, I checked.

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:17.650
It sounds like there's
a little over one

00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:23.090
fatality per 100 million
miles driven or something.

00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:25.885
So to get a sense on
whether really safer,

00:08:25.885 --> 00:08:28.360
does that mean we need to get
a few hundred million miles

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.460
driven with these cars?

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:32.230
LAWRENCE D. BURNS:
You have to or--

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:34.390
and-- I would say
and supplement that

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:39.070
with AI and machine learning
and great simulation models.

00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:42.549
So this isn't about
any one sensor.

00:08:42.549 --> 00:08:45.370
It's not about any one
enabling technology.

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:49.670
It's this combination of maps,
sensors, onboard processor

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:52.270
software, and then in
the development process

00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:55.359
to be able to go out there
and capture a lot of data

00:08:55.359 --> 00:08:57.400
when you encounter something
unusual on the road,

00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:01.030
bring that back to the
lab and simulate it--

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:05.380
virtually simulate it in reality
and learn about the edge cases

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:07.180
and get confident
that you've dealt

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:09.770
not just with the unusual
thing that you observe.

00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:12.820
So take traffic
circles, for example.

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:15.590
We've all-- you've all probably
been in a traffic circle.

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:18.340
Have you been in two lane
traffic circles or three lane

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:19.330
traffic circles?

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:21.460
And you have to
capture everything

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:23.600
about all of those
in the real world

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:26.110
or can you model that
and get to the edge cases

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:27.610
and move yourself forward?

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:29.680
JEREMY HYLTON: Yeah, I
hadn't thought about that.

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:31.480
So part of it is
real world driving.

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:33.580
Part of it is taking
the data you've

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:35.650
collected from those
drives and simulating.

00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:38.065
And that gets us closer
to those 100 millions.

00:09:38.065 --> 00:09:40.900
LAWRENCE D. BURNS: So
you say why might Google

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:43.960
get into this because
we're not a car

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:50.090
company but extraordinary deep
knowledge of computer science

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:53.710
and robotics, the best
servers in the world,

00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:57.670
the best mapping system in
the world, great AI teams.

00:09:57.670 --> 00:10:00.310
And it's really a
fundamental shift

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:02.470
in what are the core
competencies required

00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:05.530
to be a leader in
transportation in the future

00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:06.665
versus the historic ones.

00:10:06.665 --> 00:10:08.290
And the historic
ones, which we covered

00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:12.700
quite a bit in the book,
really 130 years of history

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:14.890
of combustion-based
vehicles that

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:17.770
are energized by
oil, that are human

00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:21.790
controlled with the controls
being hydraulic, and electronic

00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:22.750
primarily.

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:27.970
And those competencies were
about combustion and the driver

00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:30.820
interface to get the
ultimate driving machine.

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:33.240
And we're going to have in
the future the ultimate riding

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:35.210
machines, not the
ultimate driving machines.

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:40.120
So this is a profound shift in
the fundamental competencies

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:42.520
to be a leader in
transportation.

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:44.680
JEREMY HYLTON: Yeah,
I think you explain

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:47.540
that there are three trends
that are coming together.

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:52.480
There's the software and
the driverless technology.

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:54.586
And there is electric
vehicles, which

00:10:54.586 --> 00:10:55.960
have some advantages
like they're

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.640
much easier for
software to control

00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:59.320
than an all-mechanical one.

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:03.430
And then there's this idea of
transportation as a service

00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:05.440
rather than personal ownership.

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:07.547
And those are like
the three factors

00:11:07.547 --> 00:11:08.755
that are all coming together.

00:11:08.755 --> 00:11:09.380
LAWRENCE D. BURNS: Yeah.

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:10.720
Yeah, they've all come together.

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:13.150
Two of them are really
technology enabled,

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:15.800
and the other one is a
business model innovation.

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.930
So, again, it's not
about one thing.

00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:20.879
It's about several things
combining at the same time.

00:11:20.879 --> 00:11:22.420
I like to call that
the power of and.

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:24.380
That's the connecting
of the dots.

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:26.560
And here's how this logic goes.

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:29.710
When you have an
autonomous vehicle,

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:33.470
suddenly you don't need to pay
a person to drive the vehicle

00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:35.270
and reposition it.

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:38.890
And that makes
selling transportation

00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:41.950
as a service a pretty compelling
opportunity because you've

00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:45.070
lowered the cost then of
getting high utilization out

00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:45.810
of a vehicle.

00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:48.640
So it can pick me up,
take me to my destination,

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:51.880
drop me off, and then,
without any labor costs,

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:54.010
go a couple of blocks and
pick you up and take you

00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:56.110
to your destination and
drop you off and keep

00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:57.360
doing that throughout the day.

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:00.130
And you get very high
utilization of that fleet.

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:02.870
Today most cars are used
about 12,000 miles a year.

00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:04.820
These transportation
service business models

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:07.780
suggest it'll be
75,000 miles a year.

00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:11.200
The cars are parked
90% to 95% of the time.

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:14.170
What I just described means the
vehicle is en route to pick you

00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:15.970
up rather than being parked.

00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:19.390
But what you do then is,
because it's autonomous

00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:23.150
and it's a service, you want
to optimize the cost per mile.

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:24.880
The car industry
has been focused

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:26.950
on optimizing the
price of a new car

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:29.470
at a dealership when you go
there and fall in love with it

00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:30.580
to buy it.

00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:32.120
When you optimize
the cost per mile,

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:35.560
it turns out electric drive
is a really good deal.

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:38.470
Because a fleet
optimized cost for mile,

00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:40.900
you want the vehicle to
last about 300,000 miles.

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:44.320
An electric drive can save
you $0.05 to $0.10 a mile.

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:47.690
That's $15,000 to $30,000
over the lifetime,

00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:51.370
which is more than enough to
pay for the electric drive.

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:54.362
So the funny thing about this
is it's autonomous vehicles

00:12:54.362 --> 00:12:56.320
I think that's going to
get us past the tipping

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:58.420
point for electric vehicles.

00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:01.030
Now to make the
story even better,

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:04.060
80% of the trips we make as
Americans are one and two

00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:07.480
person trips, but our cars
and trucks are designed-- way

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:10.270
overdesigned-- for
the occasional trip.

00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:13.060
When you tailor design this
autonomous electric vehicle

00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:16.850
for this transportation service
and the most typical trips,

00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:20.330
it probably wants to be
a two-person vehicle.

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:23.300
It's probably going to have
about 1/10 as many parts in it

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:27.460
as a conventional car, and
that is really important

00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:30.220
to understand if you're
in the car industry.

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:32.372
So it's the simplicity
of electric drive.

00:13:32.372 --> 00:13:33.580
You don't have transmissions.

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:35.200
You don't have exhaust systems.

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:36.250
You have gasoline tanks.

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:37.958
You don't have all
those mechanical parts

00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:39.020
in the engine moving.

00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:41.610
And you get rid of all the
parts with a driver interface.

00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:44.055
So boom, it's really
transformational.

00:13:44.055 --> 00:13:45.430
JEREMY HYLTON:
One of the stories

00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:48.890
that actually was one of my
favorite in the book I think

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:51.850
it was when Byron McCormick
brought you out to the vehicle

00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:53.260
assessment center.

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.150
And he showed you--

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:57.130
maybe you want to describe
what that was like.

00:13:57.130 --> 00:13:58.300
LAWRENCE D. BURNS: Yeah.

00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:01.900
In 1988, I was asked to lead
an initiative at GM called

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:04.210
Design for Manufacturing.

00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:07.550
And we had a lot of
different products,

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:10.030
and our cars just seemed
like they were harder to put

00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:11.720
together than our competitors'.

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:15.190
And so we decided to tear
apart our competitors' cars,

00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:18.359
lay out all the parts,
and then conceive of how

00:14:18.359 --> 00:14:19.525
they're building their cars.

00:14:19.525 --> 00:14:23.410
And lo and behold, we
were way uncompetitive.

00:14:23.410 --> 00:14:25.810
So this teardown center
became an important place

00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:27.640
for a lot of the
leaders at GM to begin

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:29.890
to visualize what was going on.

00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:32.230
Byron McCormick,
who reported to me,

00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:33.970
was one of the
best technologists

00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:35.730
I've ever worked with.

00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:40.000
He ran the battery
plant for GMZV1.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.100
He was one of the
pioneers of what's

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:44.530
now called stability control.

00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:47.840
But very importantly, he led
our fuel cell program as well.

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:50.320
And Byron and his
team conceived of what

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:53.200
we call a vehicle platform
called e-flex, which

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:56.950
was based on these principles of
electric motors in the wheels,

00:14:56.950 --> 00:15:01.090
energy storage in the platform,
almost like a skateboard,

00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:03.300
and then by wire steering,
by wire breaking,

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:05.780
and really optimized
route software.

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:08.320
And when he had them-- a
prototype done and laid

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:11.000
out all the parts
in a torn down way,

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.480
in the same place where he
took apart a Chevy Malibu,

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:17.270
he took about a Prius
and laid those parts out.

00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:19.040
Well, the Prius had
more parts than Malibu

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:20.630
because it was a hybrid.

00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:23.150
But the e-flex had
radically fewer.

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:25.996
You could really see
where the industry was

00:15:25.996 --> 00:15:28.120
going to head when it was
going to be an electrical

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:30.260
and electronically controlled.

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.150
So we brought my
boss Rick Wagner in,

00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:34.460
who is the chairman
and CEO of GM.

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:36.260
He had to see this,
and he got it.

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:39.389
He understood it wasn't
just all the fewer parts

00:15:39.389 --> 00:15:41.930
because the parts that you have
to design, engineer, release,

00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:44.180
manufacture, tool, they
drive the cost structure

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:45.520
of a car company.

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:49.680
But it also was the software,
and that was just so important.

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:52.640
And I think a lesson out of
that is when you have an idea

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:54.140
and you're trying
to communicate it,

00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:56.330
getting to rapid
prototyping and making

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:59.030
it visible for a lot of
people I think really

00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:00.590
helps get your
idea communicated.

00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:01.423
JEREMY HYLTON: Yeah.

00:16:01.423 --> 00:16:05.840
Yeah, I love the visual
of seeing the car exploded

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:09.380
and all the parts of the Malibu
and then the electric vehicle

00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:11.150
with radically fewer parts.

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:15.360
Just a great way to
get your point across.

00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:19.700
One of the things
I found fascinating

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:23.710
was that it sounds
like maybe 2010, 2011,

00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:25.670
I think you were at
Columbia, and you were

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:27.260
modeling how this would work.

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.600
I think you picked Ann
Arbor and a few other cities

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:34.400
and found that you can offer
this service with actually not

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:36.800
that many cars relative
to the number of cars

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:40.450
that people actually park in
their driveways in Ann Arbor.

00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:42.890
LAWRENCE D. BURNS: Yeah,
there was a famous economics

00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:45.050
professor at Columbia
named Jeff Sachs,

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:47.090
and he had written the
book, "End of Poverty,"

00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:50.570
and he was running an Institute
called the Earth Institute.

00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:53.480
And when GM was going bankrupt,
he came and visited us,

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:56.390
and I gave him an overview
of some of the thinking we

00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:57.260
had longer term.

00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:59.870
And Jeff and I hit it
off, and when I left GM,

00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:01.880
he asked me if I would
lead Columbia's program

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:05.480
for a sustainable mobility,
which I decided to do.

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:08.210
And what we were really
interested in is--

00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:12.079
no kidding-- what
would a city look

00:17:12.079 --> 00:17:16.280
like if you combined
tailor-designed vehicles

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:18.680
for the two-person,
one-person trip

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:22.520
with electric drive that are
autonomous and partly shared.

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:24.950
How many would you need to
meet all the transportation

00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:29.000
requirements of a city,
and how much would it cost?

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.470
So we decided to model this.

00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:32.775
And at that time there was
a really neat database--

00:17:32.775 --> 00:17:36.230
it was a 2009
household travel survey

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:37.580
from the federal government.

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:39.620
And it gave us a good
idea of how many cars

00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:43.550
were in cities like Ann Arbor,
Austin, or Columbus, Ohio,

00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:47.900
Rochester, New York, Manhattan,
Palm Beach County, Florida.

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:51.830
So we sat down and
started to model this.

00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:55.190
And there were 200,000
cars in Ann Arbor.

00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:59.600
About 120,000 of them stayed
within the metropolitan area.

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:01.460
And our modeling
came back and said

00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:03.650
we could get all of the
trips that those cars are

00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:05.610
making done with 50--

00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:12.410
18,000 shared vehicles, just
15% of the cars that were there.

00:18:12.410 --> 00:18:14.900
We thought we had to be wrong
because at the same time

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:17.210
we concluded we could
get to the customers

00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:19.640
quickly within minutes
and that the fleet would

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:20.860
be highly utilized.

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:22.700
And we kept studying
this, convinced we

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:24.290
didn't have it right.

00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:26.990
But finally we understood the
population density of places

00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:29.870
like Ann Arbor was high
enough such that the trip

00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:32.750
frequency throughout the
14 busy hours of the day

00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:35.270
was high enough such that
just after they dropped me

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:37.830
off somewhere in Ann
Arbor, sure enough,

00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:40.280
there was a high probability
someone a couple of blocks

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:42.440
away was requesting a ride.

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:44.160
And that's how the
math worked out,

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:47.660
and that was the moment and
then when we said what was this

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:50.660
cost, the electricity
cost, the insurance,

00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:54.470
the cost of the vehicle being
depreciated, finance costs,

00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:57.260
both your time costs
and out-of-pocket costs,

00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:59.750
we thought we could get
something on the order of $0.20

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:00.440
a mile.

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:03.920
And that's compared to owning
and operating a car at about

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:07.340
$1.50 including your time cost.

00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:10.610
So you bounce that against
the 3 trillion miles a year

00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:14.700
that Americans drive, and
that's a $4 trillion disruption.

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:17.560
And that that was
a pretty big a ha.

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:20.660
We went about getting this story
told, and it was lot of fun.

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:21.630
JEREMY HYLTON: Yeah.

00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:26.180
Yeah, and so how much
of that $4.5 trillion

00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:29.005
is spent on fossil fuels?

00:19:29.005 --> 00:19:33.950
LAWRENCE D. BURNS: Well, we
use about 180 billion gallons

00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:42.286
of gasoline a year, so $3
I'd say about $500 billion.

00:19:42.286 --> 00:19:44.484
JEREMY HYLTON: So
if this works out,

00:19:44.484 --> 00:19:46.400
it's going to really
significantly changed the

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:46.490
[INAUDIBLE]

00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:48.073
LAWRENCE D. BURNS:
Very significantly.

00:19:48.073 --> 00:19:50.180
And an interesting
irony is-- sad irony

00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:55.610
about that is the year
General Motors went bankrupt,

00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:58.970
embarrassingly we
lost $32 billion.

00:19:58.970 --> 00:20:01.760
Exxon Mobil made $45 billion.

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:06.605
That year, oil prices had
gone to $1.60 a barrel.

00:20:06.605 --> 00:20:09.340
I'm sorry, $160 a barrel.

00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:12.039
You count 160, and
they make $45 billion.

00:20:12.039 --> 00:20:13.580
That was the highest
profit ever made

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:16.000
by a company at
that point in time.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.010
And the sad thing about
that oil consumption

00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:21.710
is when you refine
it to make gasoline

00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:25.490
and you burn it in a
combustion engine, about 75%

00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:27.250
of that energy is--

00:20:27.250 --> 00:20:29.540
let's say 75% to 80%--

00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:32.930
it gets lost as heat
and friction and sound,

00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:34.440
that kind of a thing.

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:37.400
So about 20% to
30% creates torque.

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:39.680
That turns the
wheels of the car.

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:41.940
The cars weigh 3,000
to 4,000 pounds,

00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:44.560
and people weigh
120 to 200 pounds.

00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:47.210
Jeremy, the bottom
line is just 1% or 2%

00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:51.150
of the energy in that gallon of
gasoline moves you the driver.

00:20:51.150 --> 00:20:54.440
And here's this company that
makes $45 billion dollars,

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:56.030
and the only way
ExxonMobil could

00:20:56.030 --> 00:20:58.910
have done that is because GM
was in the business of building

00:20:58.910 --> 00:21:02.000
and selling cars
that relied on oil.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.210
JEREMY HYLTON: Yeah, so it's
a disruption in a lot of ways.

00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:08.210
LAWRENCE D. BURNS: Well,
it's a huge disruption.

00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:13.700
It's a disruption to the
people who drive for a living.

00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:15.560
I understand that,
and I respect that.

00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:18.050
If my profession was
being disrupted by this,

00:21:18.050 --> 00:21:21.260
I don't think I would feel
comfortable about that.

00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:23.270
But also it's a disruption
to the auto industry

00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:28.130
because far fewer parts mean far
fewer employees in the supply

00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:32.030
base and at the original
equipment manufacturing

00:21:32.030 --> 00:21:34.280
base but also far fewer
engineers because you

00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:36.320
have to design fewer parts.

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:39.140
It's a disruption to the
corner gas station operator

00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:41.840
because these vehicles
will be supplied probably

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:42.920
through fleets.

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:45.200
By the way, you can have
one for your dedicated use.

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:47.960
Please don't think
the only solution here

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:50.480
is a shared vehicle like
an Uber without a driver.

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:51.980
You certainly can
subscribe to one

00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:55.100
and have it for your own
personal dispatch desires.

00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:56.840
But at the end of
the day, you're

00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:59.580
not going to want to stop to
refuel that or recharge it.

00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:01.950
So this recharging's going
to be done at a depot,

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:03.410
not at a corner gas station.

00:22:03.410 --> 00:22:07.130
The beauty of that is it lets
us introduce alternatives to oil

00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:10.340
without having to have
170,000 gas stations.

00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:14.000
So you pull that string,
parking gets impacted,

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.170
dealers get impacted, land use
and real estate gets impacted,

00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:20.570
the entire economy gets
impacted quite frankly.

00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:26.420
JEREMY HYLTON: It was
fascinating to enter

00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:28.850
into that analysis in the book.

00:22:28.850 --> 00:22:32.450
I was also thinking we're
here in New York City.

00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:36.560
So I think the recent news is
that the city is considering

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:41.380
putting a limit on the number
of Uber and Lyft drivers.

00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:45.050
And I wonder what your
take on that policy

00:22:45.050 --> 00:22:47.285
issue in the short term is.

00:22:47.285 --> 00:22:51.530
LAWRENCE D. BURNS:
Well, I believe

00:22:51.530 --> 00:22:54.160
it's an important issue because
you have an awful lot of people

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:57.620
out there trying to make
money as an Uber driver.

00:22:57.620 --> 00:22:59.960
And there needs to be this
balance between supply

00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:01.070
and demand.

00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:04.190
And if you have too many
people out there and not

00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:06.870
enough customers, you're going
to have more cars on the road

00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:08.370
not really creating value.

00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:09.950
So that's problematic.

00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:12.170
I do worry about
governments thinking

00:23:12.170 --> 00:23:14.870
they can regulate that
rather than the market,

00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:16.850
finding that right balance.

00:23:16.850 --> 00:23:18.650
So I am concerned about that.

00:23:18.650 --> 00:23:21.320
When you do get to
driverless cars,

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:24.260
your whole goal will be to
have high fleet utilization

00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:26.150
because that's key
to making money.

00:23:26.150 --> 00:23:28.660
You're going to optimize
the size of your fleet

00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:32.000
so that you have high
utilization, low empty miles,

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.030
and fast response times.

00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:35.840
And so I don't think
that carries over

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:37.700
to the driverless discussion.

00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:40.800
Fortunately, the regulators
at the local, state,

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:44.660
and federal level
for driverless cars

00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:46.460
have understood
that the only way

00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:49.970
we're going to get to this
goal of fully driverless

00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:52.070
is to learn on public roads.

00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:54.970
So they haven't stepped up
and said you can't do this.

00:23:54.970 --> 00:23:57.320
And by the way, that's a big
difference between General

00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:59.600
Motors and Google.

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:02.480
Sebastian Thrun and Chris
Urmson and their team,

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:04.760
when they started
their project, they

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:06.260
wanted to learn on public roads.

00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:08.600
And so they wondered
if they could do it

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:10.316
in the law in
California said you

00:24:10.316 --> 00:24:12.190
needed to have a driver
in the driver's seat.

00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:13.565
It didn't say you
needed to touch

00:24:13.565 --> 00:24:16.410
the steering wheel, the brake
pedal, or the accelerator.

00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:18.050
So they just went
off and did it.

00:24:18.050 --> 00:24:21.020
My general counsel at General
Motors would say no way.

00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:24.150
You can only test
in a proving ground.

00:24:24.150 --> 00:24:26.060
So they had to get
on public roads.

00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:28.075
And this is a technology.

00:24:28.075 --> 00:24:28.700
Think about it.

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:31.910
You eliminate 90% of the
crashes in the world.

00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:34.010
There's 1.3 million
people a year

00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:35.480
dying on the world's roadways.

00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:37.580
That is epidemic in scale.

00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:40.930
Get rid of 90% of that,
that's a million lives a year.

00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:44.570
Divide that by 365,
that's 3,000 lives a day.

00:24:44.570 --> 00:24:48.230
If we get to this end
goal one day sooner,

00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:50.480
we're going to say 3,000 lives.

00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:52.910
So I think the biggest risk
is not moving fast enough.

00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:57.640
And the regulators
fortunately haven't said stop,

00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:00.380
haven't said you can't
learn on public roads and.

00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:01.650
We're making good progress.

00:25:01.650 --> 00:25:06.860
We need to be open, share
the data, and learn together.

00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:08.360
But I think we'll
take that journey,

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:09.526
and we'll get there, Jeremy.

00:25:09.526 --> 00:25:10.966
I really do.

00:25:10.966 --> 00:25:13.800
JEREMY HYLTON: It reminds
me of another funny story

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:15.540
in the book.

00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:18.360
I think from early on with
the Carnegie Mellon team

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:22.770
that they were posting videos
on their blog of testing

00:25:22.770 --> 00:25:23.920
the vehicle, stopping.

00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:26.640
And someone-- somewhere on
your team a middle manager

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:27.960
saw it and thought, oh, my god.

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:29.800
I can't believe GM
is funding this.

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:31.050
We've got to put an end to it.

00:25:31.050 --> 00:25:33.341
LAWRENCE D. BURNS: Yeah,
very, very different cultures.

00:25:33.341 --> 00:25:35.730
We had a sad stretch
in the late 80s

00:25:35.730 --> 00:25:38.850
and early 90s of too many
fatalities in our plants.

00:25:38.850 --> 00:25:41.100
These were our employees.

00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:43.300
Maybe they had to do
maintenance on a robot,

00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:47.130
and they didn't lock out the
robot and they got in there

00:25:47.130 --> 00:25:49.240
and got electrocuted
or something.

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:50.800
So we said enough is enough.

00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:53.070
So we went and benchmarked
the best in the world.

00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:57.000
Alcoa, Dupont, and we want to
be the benchmark safest company

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:57.720
to work for.

00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:01.440
So safety was really ingrained
into everybody at GM.

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:03.570
So when this individual
who reported to me

00:26:03.570 --> 00:26:07.050
saw how our Carnegie Mellon
team was testing the vehicles,

00:26:07.050 --> 00:26:11.430
he felt it was way outside the
envelope on our safety culture

00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:14.190
and felt we needed to
shut down the program.

00:26:14.190 --> 00:26:15.150
We worked through that.

00:26:15.150 --> 00:26:18.810
Chris Urmson did a good
job with some diplomacy.

00:26:18.810 --> 00:26:22.260
But really I can't
overemphasize that safety

00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:25.530
has to be the overriding
priority for any organization.

00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:29.100
And I so admire what the
Google self-driving car

00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:30.780
team has accomplished,
and they've

00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:33.630
done it with a tremendous
safety culture.

00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:36.060
They've got this group,
we call it the ops group.

00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:40.740
And every morning, they
shake down all the cars,

00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:45.060
make sure the car is physically
ready to go out on the road,

00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:47.010
put their cell phones
in their locker.

00:26:47.010 --> 00:26:51.690
They go out, and they're
highly trained people following

00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:53.370
standardized processes.

00:26:53.370 --> 00:26:55.710
And they really, really
take their job seriously.

00:26:55.710 --> 00:26:58.680
Whenever you have-- if you ever
have a chance to be in the area

00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:01.740
where they work, you almost feel
like it's the same discipline

00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:05.010
you would see in
military operations.

00:27:05.010 --> 00:27:07.140
It's that serious, and
it's paid off for us.

00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:09.980
Waymo has had one
at-fault crash.

00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:12.450
Was a two-mile-per-hour
fender bender.

00:27:12.450 --> 00:27:14.671
We've had some others, and
in all those other cases,

00:27:14.671 --> 00:27:16.920
it was the other driver--
it was the human driver that

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:17.520
caused it.

00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:24.960
JEREMY HYLTON: I've
been curious about what

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:30.190
the limits of unexpected
things you can plan for are.

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:36.900
Thinking to a story from the
Urban Mobility Challenge,

00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:39.810
what happens if your
autonomous vehicle pulls

00:27:39.810 --> 00:27:43.979
up next to the Jumbotron
and that disables the GPS?

00:27:43.979 --> 00:27:46.020
LAWRENCE D. BURNS: This
is one of these moments--

00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:50.350
the Carnegie Mellon team had
some challenges along the way.

00:27:50.350 --> 00:27:51.930
The first race
was in the desert,

00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:53.790
and part of their
development work

00:27:53.790 --> 00:27:56.340
they rolled their Hummer,
which was their development

00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:57.180
vehicle, over.

00:27:57.180 --> 00:28:00.550
And that caused some
problem with sensors,

00:28:00.550 --> 00:28:02.640
and we think that's why
it only went seven miles.

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:04.110
In the second race,
lo and behold,

00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:05.443
they have the same thing happen.

00:28:05.443 --> 00:28:07.215
They had two vehicles
in that race.

00:28:07.215 --> 00:28:12.620
The one that really was probably
the best vehicle had a fuel--

00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:14.910
or it actually an
electromagnetic interference

00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:16.630
since we found out later on--

00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:20.800
damaged, and it was causing
strange things with the fuel.

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:25.799
And so the-- lost my train
of thought again, Jeremy.

00:28:25.799 --> 00:28:26.590
What was the point?

00:28:26.590 --> 00:28:28.120
JEREMY HYLTON: I was
thinking about the-- and then

00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:29.575
in the Urban
Mobility Challenge--

00:28:29.575 --> 00:28:30.820
LAWRENCE D. BURNS: Yeah.

00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:35.490
And then in the actual
DARPA Urban Challenge,

00:28:35.490 --> 00:28:36.540
we were the favorite.

00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:38.490
We thought we were
going to win this race.

00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:41.940
We felt real good
about all of our tests.

00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:43.740
And through the
preliminary heats,

00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:45.990
they sort it down
to 14 finalists,

00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:48.840
and we were in
the pole position.

00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:52.410
And that meant we got to
go out on the track first.

00:28:52.410 --> 00:28:55.830
And we couldn't get
the GPS to calibrate.

00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:59.010
Something just wouldn't lock in.

00:28:59.010 --> 00:29:01.650
And everyone's
panicking, and they

00:29:01.650 --> 00:29:03.450
go to get another GPS unit.

00:29:03.450 --> 00:29:07.670
And it turns out ESPN
was covering the event,

00:29:07.670 --> 00:29:10.020
and they had a huge
Jumbotron located right next

00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:11.100
to our vehicle.

00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:13.530
And the person from the Defense
Advanced Research Projects

00:29:13.530 --> 00:29:17.290
Agency, DARPA, who sponsored
it, Tony Tether, said,

00:29:17.290 --> 00:29:18.580
turn off the Jumbotron.

00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:22.400
As soon as they turned it
off, our GPS calibrated,

00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:23.970
and we were back in the race.

00:29:23.970 --> 00:29:25.500
So, yes, there are--

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:27.540
those are learning things.

00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:30.480
I dedicate this
book to engineers

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:32.100
who make what's possible real.

00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:35.490
How many of you here today are
engineers or computer science

00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:37.560
or technical backgrounds?

00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:39.260
That's really what we do.

00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:41.220
And I am an engineer
from the top of my head

00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:42.750
to the tips of my toes.

00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:47.880
And as long as the principles
of science are followed,

00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:50.460
I think an engineer can
accomplish almost anything

00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:52.962
if you give them the
right learning cycles.

00:29:52.962 --> 00:29:54.420
But who would have
thought we would

00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:57.360
have had this interference,
but now we know.

00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:59.880
And that's what
this is all about,

00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:02.340
learning way out on the
tail of the distribution

00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:03.952
on learning cycles.

00:30:03.952 --> 00:30:06.160
And that was one of those
great examples of learning.

00:30:08.902 --> 00:30:11.370
JEREMY HYLTON: Great
example of what's

00:30:11.370 --> 00:30:13.250
going to go wrong in
the real world when we--

00:30:13.250 --> 00:30:14.350
LAWRENCE D. BURNS: Yes.

00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:17.580
Yes, things will go
wrong in the real world.

00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:20.430
Sadly, they go wrong and
kill 40,000 Americans a year

00:30:20.430 --> 00:30:21.340
right now.

00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:24.630
And I have to be
really candid with you.

00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:27.934
Every time I read about
someone going the wrong way

00:30:27.934 --> 00:30:29.850
on the interstate and
having a head on killing

00:30:29.850 --> 00:30:31.890
four or five people,
it just breaks my heart

00:30:31.890 --> 00:30:35.430
because I know the technology
exists to prevent that.

00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:38.670
And my daughters are 30
and 27, so I took them

00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:41.640
through a driver's training and
it was an absolute nightmare

00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:44.550
to see an inexperienced driver.

00:30:44.550 --> 00:30:48.442
Next time you do-- go-- drive
through a busy intersection--

00:30:48.442 --> 00:30:49.650
you're an experienced driver.

00:30:49.650 --> 00:30:51.900
Think of what you're
sorting out, all

00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:54.210
of the visual
clutter that's there

00:30:54.210 --> 00:30:55.935
and what you really
have to pay attention

00:30:55.935 --> 00:30:57.785
to to get through that
intersection safely.

00:30:57.785 --> 00:31:01.830
And now you take a 15-year-old
kid who's never done it before.

00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:04.020
It's a learning curve, Jeremy.

00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:06.730
And we've got to do
better than this.

00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:09.250
We absolutely have to do
better than those fatalities.

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:14.640
JEREMY HYLTON: I
did like the way

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:19.451
you can contrast the engineering
cultures in Detroit and Silicon

00:31:19.451 --> 00:31:20.450
Valley through the book.

00:31:20.450 --> 00:31:23.700
And they each have their
strengths, and I think you--

00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:27.630
I'm pretty sympathetic to the
Google software engineering

00:31:27.630 --> 00:31:32.040
culture, but you pointed out
how maybe some of the Googlers

00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:34.720
needed to come to terms with the
thing Detroit is good at, too.

00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:35.720
LAWRENCE D. BURNS: Yeah.

00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:38.040
Yeah.

00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:41.010
The original title of
the book was "The Race

00:31:41.010 --> 00:31:43.240
to Build the Driverless Car."

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:47.370
And Echo, who's our publisher,
and Denise, who's the editor

00:31:47.370 --> 00:31:47.870
is here--

00:31:47.870 --> 00:31:49.495
Denise you may want
to raise your hand.

00:31:49.495 --> 00:31:52.620
But she said maybe you out
to write it about the quest.

00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:54.900
And that was really
an important moment

00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:57.150
for myself and Chris
Shulgan because suddenly we

00:31:57.150 --> 00:32:01.590
realized maybe this isn't
Silicon Valley versus Detroit.

00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:04.650
Maybe it's a bigger
story than that.

00:32:04.650 --> 00:32:08.210
Early on when I first arrived
as the gray-haired executive

00:32:08.210 --> 00:32:11.520
at Google Self-driving
Cars, there

00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:14.310
was I would say an
arrogance in the team

00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:17.160
about Silicon Valley being able
to handle these great world

00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:18.960
challenges at light speed.

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:22.200
And the auto industry had
lost its way on innovation

00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:25.320
and really, really was
no longer imaginative.

00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:28.740
At the same time when Chris
Urmson and Anthony Levandowski

00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:32.550
first went to Detroit looking
for car companies and suppliers

00:32:32.550 --> 00:32:34.170
to collaborate
with, they basically

00:32:34.170 --> 00:32:36.120
threw them out the door.

00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:38.250
Thought they were
irresponsible developing cars

00:32:38.250 --> 00:32:39.030
on public roads.

00:32:39.030 --> 00:32:42.270
So there is this tension between
the Silicon Valley culture

00:32:42.270 --> 00:32:44.070
and the Detroit culture.

00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:47.190
Where the story stands now,
where this quest stands now,

00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:47.800
its an and.

00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:49.440
It's not an or.

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:52.530
I think by hiring John
Krafcik to lead the Waymo,

00:32:52.530 --> 00:32:55.590
it was a recognition by
Alphabet's leadership

00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:58.290
that they needed somebody
with a lot of car experience

00:32:58.290 --> 00:33:01.050
to take this forward
and commercialize it.

00:33:01.050 --> 00:33:04.590
And John was really, really
deep in his experience.

00:33:04.590 --> 00:33:07.562
And at the same time, I
think Ford and General Motors

00:33:07.562 --> 00:33:10.020
realized that they're going to
have to reach out to Silicon

00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:13.320
Valley to outsource their
research and development

00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:14.730
and autonomous vehicle systems.

00:33:14.730 --> 00:33:17.400
So GM acquired
Cruise Automation.

00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:21.060
And then Argo AI was
acquired by Ford.

00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:22.710
So they've come together.

00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:24.540
It's a Silicon
Valley and Detroit

00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:25.997
that will lead this forward.

00:33:25.997 --> 00:33:26.830
JEREMY HYLTON: Yeah.

00:33:26.830 --> 00:33:27.330
Yeah.

00:33:27.330 --> 00:33:28.300
Quite fascinating.

00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:31.950
I think another thing
that move this story along

00:33:31.950 --> 00:33:37.710
was some combination of
visionaries and setting

00:33:37.710 --> 00:33:41.340
really audacious goals, these
challenges, both DARPA's

00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:45.240
challenges and then I
guess Larry and Sergei

00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:47.700
setting challenges
with Sebastian

00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:48.915
through and in others.

00:33:48.915 --> 00:33:51.490
What can you make happen here?

00:33:51.490 --> 00:33:53.740
LAWRENCE D. BURNS: It's a
great management principles,

00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:55.440
setting stretch goals.

00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:58.260
When you're the person who has
to reach this stretch goal,

00:33:58.260 --> 00:34:00.694
sometimes it can be a
little bit frightening.

00:34:00.694 --> 00:34:01.860
But think about it this way.

00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:05.165
You could say you're--

00:34:05.165 --> 00:34:08.429
you want to accomplish
something on a scale of 10,

00:34:08.429 --> 00:34:14.580
and you can set your goal
at six and get to seven

00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:16.290
and feel good about it.

00:34:16.290 --> 00:34:19.739
Or you could have set your
goal at nine and get to eight

00:34:19.739 --> 00:34:21.480
and not get there.

00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:23.310
You'd rather be at
eight than seven.

00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:26.159
So stretch goal is an
important principle.

00:34:26.159 --> 00:34:28.699
The Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency, DARPA,

00:34:28.699 --> 00:34:32.520
set stretch goals for the Desert
Challenge of which are two,

00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:35.310
and then the goal for the
Urban Challenge with 60

00:34:35.310 --> 00:34:37.500
miles in the city setting
with no one in the car,

00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:40.710
no remote control,
obey all traffic laws,

00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:42.679
get it done in six hours.

00:34:42.679 --> 00:34:44.860
And nobody thought
it could be done.

00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:47.280
So the DARPA challenge ends.

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:49.260
Everybody's feeling
great about it.

00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:51.880
Tony Tether, the head of DARPA,
says mission accomplished.

00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:53.989
You guys have proven
this can be done.

00:34:53.989 --> 00:34:56.320
It's up to the commercial
sector to run with it.

00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:58.380
And we all thought people
would be falling all

00:34:58.380 --> 00:35:01.080
over themselves wanting to
take the next step to make

00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:03.420
it commercial, and
nothing happened.

00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:06.060
Caterpillar reached
out and started

00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:08.010
doing some work for
mining applications,

00:35:08.010 --> 00:35:12.020
but we wanted to change the
whole world of automobiles.

00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:16.610
Larry and Sergei were the only
two leaders that stepped up.

00:35:16.610 --> 00:35:19.850
Larry and Sergei, they
were at that race.

00:35:19.850 --> 00:35:22.120
They had a passion
for this subject.

00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:25.130
And Larry had a
great conversation

00:35:25.130 --> 00:35:29.720
with Sebastian Thrun
and said Sebastian

00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:31.310
told Larry we can't do this.

00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:32.150
We shouldn't do it.

00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:34.940
Sebastian told Larry, I'm
the best in this field.

00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:36.290
I know what I'm talking about.

00:35:36.290 --> 00:35:37.331
We shouldn't get into it.

00:35:37.331 --> 00:35:40.610
And Larry said I have
to tell Eric and Sergei

00:35:40.610 --> 00:35:42.410
a real reason why we can do it.

00:35:42.410 --> 00:35:44.510
So he sends Sebastian
back the third time,

00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:47.780
and finally Sebastian came
said, well, maybe we can.

00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:50.040
And then they set
these stretch goals.

00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:53.240
Think about this as
a form of leadership.

00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:56.640
Larry wanted it to go on
every road in California.

00:35:56.640 --> 00:36:01.260
So they negotiated that they
would pick 10 100-mile routes.

00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:03.710
And you know who
laid out the routes?

00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:06.160
Larry and Sergei.

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:08.240
And they put a bonus
in place for the team

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:10.220
to get this done in two years.

00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:12.380
So Sebastian negotiates
another goal,

00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:14.720
100,000 miles on public roads
because they want at least

00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:16.400
get a little bit of payment.

00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:18.650
This is really
impressive leadership.

00:36:18.650 --> 00:36:22.930
And then they stuck with the
team, and the team got it done.

00:36:22.930 --> 00:36:24.590
So there's a
management lesson here.

00:36:24.590 --> 00:36:27.500
You have to set it
far enough out where

00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:30.230
it's really hard to get
there but not so far out

00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:31.910
that it's impossible.

00:36:31.910 --> 00:36:35.226
And they've subsequently put
additional goals on the Waymo

00:36:35.226 --> 00:36:36.600
team that they're
working really,

00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:39.890
really hard on right now
in Chandler, Arizona,

00:36:39.890 --> 00:36:43.350
tied to do people like
riding in these cars?

00:36:43.350 --> 00:36:44.840
Can you do it safely?

00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:45.870
Is a business here?

00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:48.220
All of that stuff but
it's really a good lesson

00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:49.335
in the management.

00:36:49.335 --> 00:36:53.540
JEREMY HYLTON: I
guess Tony at DARPA

00:36:53.540 --> 00:36:56.264
had the most challenging one.

00:36:56.264 --> 00:36:57.680
He really had to
stick to his guns

00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:00.380
because after the first Urban
Challenge-- or the first Desert

00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:03.680
Challenge was supposed to be
150 miles, and the best car did,

00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:04.430
what seven miles.

00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:05.330
LAWRENCE D. BURNS:
Came in seven miles

00:37:05.330 --> 00:37:07.890
and he had all those media
stacked up at the finish line,

00:37:07.890 --> 00:37:09.290
and nobody got there.

00:37:09.290 --> 00:37:12.590
So Tony goes to the finish line,
and he says I got great news.

00:37:12.590 --> 00:37:14.360
The next race-- and he's--

00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:18.678
is on this date and the
prize is $2 million.

00:37:18.678 --> 00:37:19.636
He really pivoted well.

00:37:19.636 --> 00:37:20.975
JEREMY HYLTON: That's got guts.

00:37:20.975 --> 00:37:22.100
LAWRENCE D. BURNS:
But this is a lot

00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:24.475
of money for these young
teams competing for it.

00:37:24.475 --> 00:37:25.425
JEREMY HYLTON: Yeah.

00:37:25.425 --> 00:37:27.534
I thought that
was a great story.

00:37:27.534 --> 00:37:28.575
Stick with this approach.

00:37:32.270 --> 00:37:33.210
I was also curious--

00:37:33.210 --> 00:37:38.900
like the engineering cultures
are coming to appreciate the--

00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:40.400
what they have to
offer each other.

00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:45.260
But you also I think made a
point, at least in Detroit,

00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:47.550
there's actually a hierarchy
of engineering teams.

00:37:47.550 --> 00:37:50.780
So the parts manufacturers and
some of the parts manufacturers

00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:56.210
are as big as the auto companies
that sell the brand name.

00:37:56.210 --> 00:37:59.360
And so I wonder what
kind of hierarchy

00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:02.650
are we going to
see in the future?

00:38:02.650 --> 00:38:06.020
Is Uber the brand we're going
to know or Lyft or Waymo?

00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:08.747
Is it going to be Toyota.

00:38:08.747 --> 00:38:10.955
Is there going to be a lot
of competition about that?

00:38:10.955 --> 00:38:11.900
LAWRENCE D. BURNS: Yes.

00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:13.040
There's going to be competition.

00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:14.873
First of all, there's
a lot of different use

00:38:14.873 --> 00:38:16.350
cases for these brands.

00:38:16.350 --> 00:38:19.510
There's the use case of
Ubers, Lyfts without drivers.

00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:23.270
There's the use case of you
basically leasing an autonomous

00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:25.490
vehicle and having a
subscription service so

00:38:25.490 --> 00:38:26.740
that you're controlling it.

00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:28.150
So think about that.

00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:30.480
You say I want one of
these for 12 months,

00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:33.170
and I'm going to subscribe
for 30,000 miles.

00:38:33.170 --> 00:38:34.670
It takes you to
work, drops you off.

00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:38.240
You then dispatch it to
go pick up your spouse,

00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:40.700
take him or her to
work, drop them off,

00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:44.060
and your spouse dispatches it
to go pick up your kid at school

00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:46.771
for soccer practice and
then mother-in-law for Meals

00:38:46.771 --> 00:38:47.270
on Wheels.

00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:51.350
So you may use this one
dedicated vehicle to the point

00:38:51.350 --> 00:38:53.390
where you don't need
that second or third car,

00:38:53.390 --> 00:38:55.980
but you're still going to have
that control that you have.

00:38:55.980 --> 00:38:57.440
So you've got that use case.

00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:59.360
Don't forget goods movement.

00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:01.970
Over the road trucking--
the shortage of truck

00:39:01.970 --> 00:39:07.040
drivers or truck drivers, $0.64
a mile in benefits and wages.

00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:08.817
And it's a tedious job.

00:39:08.817 --> 00:39:10.400
It takes people away
from their homes,

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:12.660
so there's real value
to be created there.

00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:15.470
And then finally, that
last mile of delivery.

00:39:15.470 --> 00:39:17.390
My goodness, I work
out of my home office.

00:39:17.390 --> 00:39:21.020
I've had two times
were the UPS and FedEx

00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:23.730
truck were in my driveway
at the same time.

00:39:23.730 --> 00:39:25.530
I came home from
golfing two weeks ago,

00:39:25.530 --> 00:39:27.050
I had nine boxes on my porch.

00:39:27.050 --> 00:39:28.302
My wife has been busy.

00:39:28.302 --> 00:39:29.135
She's a her stylist.

00:39:29.135 --> 00:39:32.090
She really likes to get all
this stuff over the internet,

00:39:32.090 --> 00:39:35.510
but that last mile, if
you can get the driver out

00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:38.250
of the local delivery system,
whether it's with drones or you

00:39:38.250 --> 00:39:38.750
name it.

00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:41.040
So a wide range of use cases.

00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:43.660
How are you going to
brand that is important.

00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:45.710
What are the experiences
you're going to deliver?

00:39:45.710 --> 00:39:48.510
It's not just going
from point A to point B

00:39:48.510 --> 00:39:49.820
and getting there safely.

00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:52.120
It's does it pick me up
at my precise location,

00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:55.592
drop me off precisely,
is the ride so nice

00:39:55.592 --> 00:39:57.050
that when I get
out of the vehicle,

00:39:57.050 --> 00:39:59.270
I feel better than
when I got in to it?

00:39:59.270 --> 00:40:02.930
Can I get to more places
with brand A versus brand B?

00:40:02.930 --> 00:40:05.240
That's going to be a
basis of competition.

00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:07.010
But the one place
I think you want

00:40:07.010 --> 00:40:10.900
to be beyond anything else
in this future ecosystem

00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:14.110
is to have the world's best
driver because the world's best

00:40:14.110 --> 00:40:17.320
driver can play on every
one of those use cases.

00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:20.770
And it's typically more
than half the cost per mile

00:40:20.770 --> 00:40:23.020
that we incur today.

00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:24.290
So that's a big opportunity.

00:40:24.290 --> 00:40:26.950
Now does this play out in a
Microsoft kind of a business

00:40:26.950 --> 00:40:28.900
model or an Intel
Inside business

00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:31.240
model or an arm business model?

00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:32.880
Those decisions
haven't been made yet.

00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:37.420
There's still a lot of work to
do before you start scaling.

00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:39.610
I think the experience
as it get branded.

00:40:39.610 --> 00:40:41.110
I personally think
the car companies

00:40:41.110 --> 00:40:43.240
are going to have
a tough time saying

00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:46.574
Chevrolet is the right brand
for a mobility service.

00:40:46.574 --> 00:40:48.490
I think that's going to
be a bit of a stretch.

00:40:48.490 --> 00:40:50.925
So I think you're going to
see some rebranding going on.

00:40:50.925 --> 00:40:51.800
It's going to be fun.

00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:53.140
JEREMY HYLTON: Yeah.

00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:54.309
All right.

00:40:54.309 --> 00:40:55.600
It's been great talking to you.

00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:57.530
I think I have to let everyone
else ask some questions.

00:40:57.530 --> 00:40:58.090
LAWRENCE D. BURNS:
Well, thank you.

00:40:58.090 --> 00:40:58.510
Thank you.

00:40:58.510 --> 00:40:59.620
Thank you for reading the book.

00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:00.870
Your questions were excellent.

00:41:00.870 --> 00:41:04.030
And certainly when
you're an author,

00:41:04.030 --> 00:41:06.410
you love it when someone
would give you some

00:41:06.410 --> 00:41:07.660
of your time over the weekend.

00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:09.493
It's really nice, Jeremy,
that you did that.

00:41:09.493 --> 00:41:10.340
JEREMY HYLTON: Yeah.

00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:12.010
It was great fun to read.

00:41:12.010 --> 00:41:12.680
Great stories.

00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:15.010
LAWRENCE D. BURNS: Just
one thing for the Q&amp;A.

00:41:15.010 --> 00:41:16.605
I lost my hearing 20 years ago.

00:41:16.605 --> 00:41:20.290
I hear with cochlear implants,
and it's same technology

00:41:20.290 --> 00:41:21.480
as autonomous cars.

00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:25.960
Its batteries and sensors and
software and all of that stuff.

00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:28.540
I think I'll hear you fine,
but if not, Jeremy will help me

00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:29.331
with the questions.

00:41:29.331 --> 00:41:29.905
Go ahead.

00:41:29.905 --> 00:41:33.020
AUDIENCE: Hey, Larry, thanks
for coming to talk to us.

00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:36.960
I have a three-year-old at home,
and I think about in 13 years,

00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:38.830
he's going to get
his driver's license.

00:41:38.830 --> 00:41:40.205
What are the odds
that he's going

00:41:40.205 --> 00:41:42.160
to get his driver's license?

00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:44.570
LAWRENCE D. BURNS: I think
the odds are pretty low.

00:41:44.570 --> 00:41:47.470
There's a lot of people who
are enthusiastic about driving,

00:41:47.470 --> 00:41:49.410
and 100 years ago, there
were a lot of people

00:41:49.410 --> 00:41:51.400
enthusiastic about horses.

00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:52.240
And--

00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:53.650
[LAUGHING]

00:41:53.650 --> 00:41:54.910
They're still horse racing.

00:41:54.910 --> 00:41:58.480
They're still equestrian-- the
important message right now

00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:02.200
is not that we're going
to say you can't drive,

00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:03.745
but for a lot of
people, we're going

00:42:03.745 --> 00:42:05.995
to say you're going to get
the accessibility, mobility

00:42:05.995 --> 00:42:10.040
benefits of owning and operating
a car and not have to drive.

00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:14.020
So your child is going to
be able to make a choice

00:42:14.020 --> 00:42:16.600
by the time they're 15 or 16.

00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:18.940
There's a lot of negatives
with owning and operating

00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:20.380
a car beyond the safety risk.

00:42:20.380 --> 00:42:22.637
Having to stop to buy gas,
having to find parking,

00:42:22.637 --> 00:42:24.220
and having to get
your car maintained,

00:42:24.220 --> 00:42:26.740
having to shop for
it, have it insured

00:42:26.740 --> 00:42:29.780
and finance it and you
put all that together

00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:31.420
and you say, man,
that's a real hassle.

00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:33.430
And this industry's
existed for a century

00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:38.110
assuming you're willing to do
that and pay $35,000 for a car.

00:42:38.110 --> 00:42:40.340
So I think that world's
going to change quite a bit.

00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:41.173
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:42:41.173 --> 00:42:42.550
LAWRENCE D. BURNS: Thank you.

00:42:42.550 --> 00:42:43.270
Over here.

00:42:43.270 --> 00:42:46.760
AUDIENCE: So I actually
have two questions.

00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:49.510
The first one is a big
downside of electric vehicles

00:42:49.510 --> 00:42:51.929
has always been
distance per charge.

00:42:51.929 --> 00:42:53.470
What about taking
a trip in the world

00:42:53.470 --> 00:42:55.300
that you were describing here?

00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:58.000
How would I go from New
York City to Buffalo

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.370
to get some Buffalo
wings for the weekend?

00:43:00.370 --> 00:43:02.500
How does that play
into what you're

00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:05.961
talking about, which is more
daily travel, commuting,

00:43:05.961 --> 00:43:06.460
et cetera.

00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:07.460
LAWRENCE D. BURNS: Yeah.

00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:08.350
Yeah.

00:43:08.350 --> 00:43:09.610
That's an exciting question.

00:43:09.610 --> 00:43:12.940
The range of the batteries
has increased significantly.

00:43:12.940 --> 00:43:16.910
The Chevrolet Bolt, for example,
has about a 230-mile range.

00:43:16.910 --> 00:43:19.060
So we think the
battery is sufficient

00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:22.900
for the everyday community
usage in this shared model.

00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:26.020
Going between
communities, you may

00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:32.470
have like a range extender that
you could associate with this,

00:43:32.470 --> 00:43:35.350
almost like a pod that
snaps on the back that's

00:43:35.350 --> 00:43:38.440
extra battery just when you
need to make that trip that

00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:41.950
can extend your range and
extend your power to do that.

00:43:41.950 --> 00:43:44.740
I wouldn't totally rule
out hydrogen or fuel cells.

00:43:44.740 --> 00:43:47.740
I wish I never uttered the word
fuel cell because this is just

00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:48.455
hydrogen battery.

00:43:48.455 --> 00:43:50.500
It's another kind of a battery.

00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:53.320
But that's its real advantage
is you can fill up with hydrogen

00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:55.270
and have significant range.

00:43:55.270 --> 00:43:57.391
I do think when
the market's there,

00:43:57.391 --> 00:43:59.140
we're going to have
the solutions in place

00:43:59.140 --> 00:44:02.670
to get you from Buffalo
to New York City

00:44:02.670 --> 00:44:04.010
if that's where you want to go.

00:44:04.010 --> 00:44:06.992
One way ticket to
Buffalo though.

00:44:06.992 --> 00:44:07.950
AUDIENCE: That's right.

00:44:07.950 --> 00:44:10.330
We can plug it in
when we get there.

00:44:10.330 --> 00:44:13.540
So we saw in the late
90s, early 2000s with EV1,

00:44:13.540 --> 00:44:16.150
for example, as you mentioned
the effect of the oil and gas

00:44:16.150 --> 00:44:20.170
lobbies and their
effect on the saturation

00:44:20.170 --> 00:44:22.990
of the electric vehicle as a
whole in the United States.

00:44:22.990 --> 00:44:24.510
Has that changed at all?

00:44:24.510 --> 00:44:29.950
Are we at a point where we're
ready to see gas and oil

00:44:29.950 --> 00:44:31.990
cars off the road?

00:44:31.990 --> 00:44:34.144
Or are we still fighting
that same battle?

00:44:34.144 --> 00:44:35.560
LAWRENCE D. BURNS:
I certainly can

00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:38.710
see a pathway to not
need oil any longer

00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:40.060
in the transportation sector.

00:44:40.060 --> 00:44:41.440
I hesitate a bit.

00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:45.580
Diesel is a really good way
to move 80,000-pounds loads,

00:44:45.580 --> 00:44:47.410
so there may be some
applications there.

00:44:47.410 --> 00:44:51.460
But I think for about 80% of
the oil, we can get off of that.

00:44:51.460 --> 00:44:53.221
Will we?

00:44:53.221 --> 00:44:55.470
The thing that keeps me up
at night, quite honestly, I

00:44:55.470 --> 00:44:57.053
think what's going
to gate all of this

00:44:57.053 --> 00:44:58.840
are those very
powerful voices that

00:44:58.840 --> 00:45:03.220
have a vested interest in the
130-year-old automobile roadway

00:45:03.220 --> 00:45:05.080
transportation system.

00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:08.280
The easiest thing to do in
Washington DC is say no,

00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:11.700
and these companies who have
something to lose from this

00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:14.490
are very good at
knowing how to say no.

00:45:14.490 --> 00:45:18.210
So that does concern
me, but technologically

00:45:18.210 --> 00:45:19.110
I think we're there.

00:45:19.110 --> 00:45:21.240
I think in terms of
value proposition

00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:23.730
for all of us living our
everyday lives, I think where

00:45:23.730 --> 00:45:24.810
their.

00:45:24.810 --> 00:45:27.180
Business model,
investors wanting

00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:28.890
to put the money
in this new future

00:45:28.890 --> 00:45:31.780
rather than where we've
been, I think we're there.

00:45:31.780 --> 00:45:35.040
Now it's just a matter of
almost like the baseball movie

00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:38.050
"Field of Dreams," if I
build it, they will come.

00:45:38.050 --> 00:45:41.047
And that's why I'm so proud to
be part of Waymo as an advisor

00:45:41.047 --> 00:45:43.380
because that's what they're
doing in Chandler as they're

00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:44.550
proving this thing out.

00:45:44.550 --> 00:45:45.230
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:45:45.230 --> 00:45:45.910
Thank you very much.

00:45:45.910 --> 00:45:46.500
LAWRENCE D. BURNS: Thank you.

00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:46.950
Thank you.

00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:47.449
Yes.

00:45:47.449 --> 00:45:48.360
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:51.090
You mentioned that
you view this market

00:45:51.090 --> 00:45:53.400
as being very competitive,
and I was just

00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:55.380
wondering how you
think about network

00:45:55.380 --> 00:45:57.180
effects of like Uber and Lyft.

00:45:57.180 --> 00:45:58.981
Basically their
entire business model

00:45:58.981 --> 00:46:00.480
is just if you have
all the drivers,

00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:01.854
then you have all
the passengers,

00:46:01.854 --> 00:46:04.560
and you can be a monopoly.

00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:08.010
I guess how do you think
about what the market will

00:46:08.010 --> 00:46:09.550
look like whether you--

00:46:09.550 --> 00:46:11.820
transportation is
centralizing and what

00:46:11.820 --> 00:46:13.287
regulatory other options--

00:46:13.287 --> 00:46:15.120
LAWRENCE D. BURNS: Very
important questions.

00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:17.080
And one of the
interesting part--

00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:18.870
results from the work
I do the Columbia,

00:46:18.870 --> 00:46:21.840
not only did we get this
$0.20-per-mile opportunity

00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:26.790
identified, it turns out scale
economies are reached at about

00:46:26.790 --> 00:46:30.070
10% of the miles
driven in a community.

00:46:30.070 --> 00:46:33.060
What I mean by that is if I
had a shared fleet that I was

00:46:33.060 --> 00:46:36.390
running in Ann Arbor and
I had 10% market share

00:46:36.390 --> 00:46:41.210
then I went to 11%, my cost per
mile wasn't going down anymore.

00:46:41.210 --> 00:46:43.830
That suggests that
you don't need

00:46:43.830 --> 00:46:47.730
to have the entire market in
order to have scale and be

00:46:47.730 --> 00:46:48.480
competitive.

00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:51.230
With that said, there's
definitely network effects,

00:46:51.230 --> 00:46:53.540
so there's definitely
scaling effects.

00:46:53.540 --> 00:46:54.690
There's learning effects.

00:46:54.690 --> 00:46:56.640
I talk about having the
world's best driver.

00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:58.620
One of the best
ways to do that is

00:46:58.620 --> 00:47:00.870
to be learning from more
and more and more vehicles

00:47:00.870 --> 00:47:02.580
on the road every day.

00:47:02.580 --> 00:47:04.940
And when-- the beauty
of a driverless car

00:47:04.940 --> 00:47:08.179
is when I learn
something from one car,

00:47:08.179 --> 00:47:10.470
I can put it in all the other
cars and make all of them

00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:11.610
safer.

00:47:11.610 --> 00:47:13.920
When I learn something as
a human driver about how

00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:15.870
to do something better,
I have no mechanism

00:47:15.870 --> 00:47:17.940
for transferring that
to other human drivers.

00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:19.660
So these things
are real important,

00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:21.660
and I think they're going
to have to be watched.

00:47:21.660 --> 00:47:23.570
Certainly not a reason
not to go forward

00:47:23.570 --> 00:47:26.340
but they're going to have
to be managed for sure.

00:47:26.340 --> 00:47:26.900
Over here.

00:47:26.900 --> 00:47:27.130
Yes.

00:47:27.130 --> 00:47:27.590
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:47:27.590 --> 00:47:28.090
Hi.

00:47:28.090 --> 00:47:30.330
I'm very excited
about driverless cars,

00:47:30.330 --> 00:47:33.840
and certainly there's
tremendous future.

00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:35.550
There's one thing that
worries me about--

00:47:35.550 --> 00:47:37.000
its impact on freedom--

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:41.730
because car was the
greatest vehicle

00:47:41.730 --> 00:47:44.160
for freedom and opportunity.

00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:49.960
Ability to go someplace is
a great boon for humans.

00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:53.760
But now the way the driverless
cars are being actual

00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:57.600
designed and implemented means
we depend on cloud services

00:47:57.600 --> 00:48:01.110
and on provider
of cloud services

00:48:01.110 --> 00:48:04.560
desire to enable my trip.

00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:08.480
Google decides not
to map certain area,

00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:12.540
the cars will not
go to that area.

00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:14.820
Google or better yet
the government decides

00:48:14.820 --> 00:48:19.710
that certain event is
not good, they can easily

00:48:19.710 --> 00:48:24.300
make cars not go to that event.

00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:27.462
And this is because
we have no other way

00:48:27.462 --> 00:48:29.670
of doing things other than
through the cloud service.

00:48:32.410 --> 00:48:38.790
We will not really own anything
even if we buy the car.

00:48:38.790 --> 00:48:41.364
LAWRENCE D. BURNS: Yeah.

00:48:41.364 --> 00:48:42.780
First of all, the
title of my book

00:48:42.780 --> 00:48:45.030
is "Autonomy" because I
believe this future is

00:48:45.030 --> 00:48:47.260
going to bring more freedom.

00:48:47.260 --> 00:48:48.690
There's a lot of
people today that

00:48:48.690 --> 00:48:52.200
can't benefit from owning
and operating an automobile.

00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:53.450
They're too young to drive it.

00:48:53.450 --> 00:48:54.490
They're too old.

00:48:54.490 --> 00:48:56.790
They're not capable
physically to do it.

00:48:56.790 --> 00:48:58.230
They can't afford it.

00:48:58.230 --> 00:48:59.195
Whatever it might be.

00:48:59.195 --> 00:49:01.320
So we really think were
going to bring more freedom

00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:03.430
to a lot more people with this.

00:49:03.430 --> 00:49:06.090
If the concern that you
raise, which is really

00:49:06.090 --> 00:49:08.585
my area of expertise, if
you're concerned about that,

00:49:08.585 --> 00:49:10.710
I'd encourage you to go
out and start working on it

00:49:10.710 --> 00:49:14.580
because we want this to be an
enabler of much greater freedom

00:49:14.580 --> 00:49:17.126
rather than a
constraint or a freedom.

00:49:17.126 --> 00:49:19.500
I think when you look at the
100-year history of the auto

00:49:19.500 --> 00:49:22.136
industry, a lot of that stuff
was playing out as well.

00:49:22.136 --> 00:49:23.760
Where were you going
to build the road,

00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:25.480
and we're going to
build a parking lot?

00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:28.510
And who pays for the
roads and all of that?

00:49:28.510 --> 00:49:31.950
And I think we have
created an extensive amount

00:49:31.950 --> 00:49:37.740
of uneven access and inequality
in our mobility systems.

00:49:37.740 --> 00:49:41.040
I live north of Detroit, and
our neighborhoods in Detroit

00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:43.110
still have a lot of poverty.

00:49:43.110 --> 00:49:45.450
And these people can't break
out of the cycle of poverty

00:49:45.450 --> 00:49:47.190
because we don't have
any transportation

00:49:47.190 --> 00:49:48.530
alternatives other than a car.

00:49:48.530 --> 00:49:50.250
And the car insurance
is off the chart.

00:49:50.250 --> 00:49:51.190
It's expensive.

00:49:51.190 --> 00:49:54.510
So all of this has to be
managed and talked about.

00:49:54.510 --> 00:49:56.580
And I'd encourage the
dialogue to continue.

00:49:56.580 --> 00:49:58.790
I think great observation.

00:49:58.790 --> 00:49:59.470
Yes.

00:49:59.470 --> 00:50:00.210
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:50:00.210 --> 00:50:03.120
I was wondering if you thought
that the influx of autonomous

00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:06.750
vehicles in cities will
result in cities becoming

00:50:06.750 --> 00:50:10.240
more multimodal, more walkable,
more bikable, more mass

00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:13.090
transit with first, last mile
or if you thought it would just

00:50:13.090 --> 00:50:15.910
increase car dependence,
increase the widening of roads,

00:50:15.910 --> 00:50:16.750
et cetera.

00:50:16.750 --> 00:50:19.390
LAWRENCE D. BURNS: I think
it's going to be the former.

00:50:19.390 --> 00:50:21.520
There's three parking
spaces dedicated

00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:23.170
to every car in
the United States,

00:50:23.170 --> 00:50:25.270
and there's 250 million cars.

00:50:25.270 --> 00:50:29.110
So that's a lot of
parking, and that parking

00:50:29.110 --> 00:50:31.770
constrains densification.

00:50:31.770 --> 00:50:33.820
I do want to make
a point though.

00:50:33.820 --> 00:50:36.550
Only 26% of Americans
live in cities.

00:50:36.550 --> 00:50:39.480
Fifty-three percent of
Americans live in suburbs.

00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:42.876
And that parking issue is
even more severe there.

00:50:42.876 --> 00:50:44.950
I'm on the board of a
real estate development

00:50:44.950 --> 00:50:47.410
company in Florida, and
we had a parcel of land

00:50:47.410 --> 00:50:51.760
that we were developing along
I-75 south of Tampa, St.

00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:53.680
Petersburg.

00:50:53.680 --> 00:51:00.370
And they ended up putting
a Walmart on that site.

00:51:00.370 --> 00:51:02.050
But the amount of
land for parking

00:51:02.050 --> 00:51:05.000
was twice the amount of
land for the building.

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:06.020
And this is nuts.

00:51:06.020 --> 00:51:08.380
And so I think this
is an opportunity

00:51:08.380 --> 00:51:10.610
to really drive densification.

00:51:10.610 --> 00:51:14.320
And secondly the vehicles
are dramatically better

00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:17.980
at detecting pedestrians,
detecting bicyclists,

00:51:17.980 --> 00:51:21.070
and taking a lot of the
risk out of the system

00:51:21.070 --> 00:51:23.680
for vulnerable roadway users.

00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:26.030
I sometimes talk about
this con-- for the concept

00:51:26.030 --> 00:51:27.190
of the secondhand smoke.

00:51:27.190 --> 00:51:29.080
I like to talk about
secondhand physics.

00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:32.110
For some reason, there's a
belief that somebody can drive

00:51:32.110 --> 00:51:35.770
a 5,000-pound Cadillac
Escalade on one of the streets

00:51:35.770 --> 00:51:39.370
in Manhattan and go 45
miles an hour, and it's--

00:51:39.370 --> 00:51:41.550
that's second hand physics.

00:51:41.550 --> 00:51:42.697
It's just kinetic energy.

00:51:42.697 --> 00:51:44.030
So we've got to work through it.

00:51:44.030 --> 00:51:45.520
But I'm in the
camp where I think

00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:47.020
we're going to make
cities more livable,

00:51:47.020 --> 00:51:48.728
but very importantly,
I think we're going

00:51:48.728 --> 00:51:50.245
to improve suburbs a lot, too.

00:51:50.245 --> 00:51:53.110
AUDIENCE: So the whole
driverless car thing seems--

00:51:53.110 --> 00:51:55.835
reminds me a lot of the
internet in the 1980s, 1990s

00:51:55.835 --> 00:51:56.960
LAWRENCE D. BURNS: It does.

00:51:56.960 --> 00:51:59.050
AUDIENCE: A lot of
innovation, exciting things.

00:51:59.050 --> 00:52:01.990
One of the things that happened
after that time in the internet

00:52:01.990 --> 00:52:07.365
is we discovered there's a
lot of malefactors out there.

00:52:07.365 --> 00:52:10.690
And one of the things that
I haven't heard anyone

00:52:10.690 --> 00:52:12.610
in this industry really
talking about too much

00:52:12.610 --> 00:52:19.660
is how do you defend and
make secure your driverless

00:52:19.660 --> 00:52:22.330
car not only against the kind
of attacks that are already

00:52:22.330 --> 00:52:27.310
taking place against
automated but driver-full cars

00:52:27.310 --> 00:52:31.120
but against jamming or other
kinds of attacks on the sensors

00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:35.025
and things like that, which
nobody's doing that now.

00:52:35.025 --> 00:52:35.650
It's wonderful.

00:52:35.650 --> 00:52:39.840
Everybody's cooperating mostly,
but that doesn't last forever.

00:52:39.840 --> 00:52:40.840
LAWRENCE D. BURNS: Yeah.

00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:42.060
Yeah.

00:52:42.060 --> 00:52:46.120
The whole cyber security area,
again, is not my expertise.

00:52:46.120 --> 00:52:49.166
I talk to people who
understand it better than I do.

00:52:49.166 --> 00:52:51.290
And we've got a lot of
people working on that hard.

00:52:51.290 --> 00:52:54.100
It's not an issue that's
unique to driverless cars.

00:52:54.100 --> 00:52:56.380
It also exists in
human-driven cars.

00:52:56.380 --> 00:53:00.200
Our current curves are very
vulnerable to being hacked.

00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:02.500
It's part of the
other systems we

00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:04.420
use in our daily
lives, the airline

00:53:04.420 --> 00:53:05.740
system and other things.

00:53:05.740 --> 00:53:11.020
And so I share the
concern, but not to--

00:53:11.020 --> 00:53:13.204
and I'm not implying
you're suggesting this--

00:53:13.204 --> 00:53:14.620
but not to the
point where it says

00:53:14.620 --> 00:53:17.950
we shouldn't be pushing
this opportunity to it's

00:53:17.950 --> 00:53:18.920
full extent.

00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:22.390
I believe the way to go
at this is to think big.

00:53:22.390 --> 00:53:24.310
And certainly Google
Self-driving Cars

00:53:24.310 --> 00:53:26.110
and Google and
Alphabet are thinking

00:53:26.110 --> 00:53:27.490
very big in this space.

00:53:27.490 --> 00:53:30.850
Start small-- 13 Priuses
get out and start learning

00:53:30.850 --> 00:53:32.980
on public roads, learn fast.

00:53:32.980 --> 00:53:35.520
We've been learning fast
now for almost a decade,

00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:38.140
and it's been
extraordinary insights.

00:53:38.140 --> 00:53:40.241
And then scale smart.

00:53:40.241 --> 00:53:41.740
I don't think
anyone's going to want

00:53:41.740 --> 00:53:44.200
to scale a system that
has the vulnerabilities

00:53:44.200 --> 00:53:46.000
that you're concerned with.

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:47.950
We're going to have to
have solutions to that.

00:53:47.950 --> 00:53:50.410
Should that be the
first problem to fix?

00:53:50.410 --> 00:53:51.610
I don't know.

00:53:51.610 --> 00:53:55.870
I don't think solving snowstorms
on Loveland Pass at night time

00:53:55.870 --> 00:53:58.300
was the first thing to
work on on driverless cars.

00:53:58.300 --> 00:53:59.710
We may never solve that one.

00:53:59.710 --> 00:54:01.690
But I think we got to
get out there and learn.

00:54:01.690 --> 00:54:02.575
So one more question.

00:54:02.575 --> 00:54:03.950
JEREMY HYLTON:
One more question.

00:54:03.950 --> 00:54:05.550
LAWRENCE D. BURNS:
One more please.

00:54:05.550 --> 00:54:10.000
AUDIENCE: So just where does
it start in a big way I mean?

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:13.960
Of course, it makes sense
to focus on the desired end

00:54:13.960 --> 00:54:18.170
state of changing the car
experience for Americans.

00:54:18.170 --> 00:54:22.240
But does it actually start
in some more limited domain?

00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:23.957
I don't know,
long-haul trucking or--

00:54:23.957 --> 00:54:25.290
LAWRENCE D. BURNS: Yes, it does.

00:54:25.290 --> 00:54:27.340
AUDIENCE: Enthusiasts,
early adopters,

00:54:27.340 --> 00:54:30.850
or city centers where
there's restricted access

00:54:30.850 --> 00:54:32.564
for other kind of
vehicles or what?

00:54:32.564 --> 00:54:34.480
LAWRENCE D. BURNS: I
think those use cases are

00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:36.520
very exciting places to start--

00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:41.007
gated communities, campuses,
low-speed applications.

00:54:41.007 --> 00:54:43.090
The interesting thing about
over-the-road trucking

00:54:43.090 --> 00:54:46.550
is not all freeway links
are created the same.

00:54:46.550 --> 00:54:53.410
Some are flat, straight, nice
weather, low-traffic density,

00:54:53.410 --> 00:54:55.810
much easier to get
started with his business

00:54:55.810 --> 00:54:59.020
than some of the curvier
higher-traffic areas.

00:54:59.020 --> 00:55:02.500
So it's not going to be just
we suddenly take and deploy it

00:55:02.500 --> 00:55:05.050
on a large scale in a
major metropolitan area.

00:55:05.050 --> 00:55:07.970
I think you're going to see a
whole bunch of these smaller

00:55:07.970 --> 00:55:10.880
plays done as we work hard.

00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:13.410
Again, no one's saying we're
ready to commercialize this

00:55:13.410 --> 00:55:14.660
at scale.

00:55:14.660 --> 00:55:18.080
What we are saying is we believe
the technology is reaching

00:55:18.080 --> 00:55:20.720
a point where there's
commercial-- consumer value

00:55:20.720 --> 00:55:22.170
to be had.

00:55:22.170 --> 00:55:24.769
And I think with any startup,
you want to get to that point.

00:55:24.769 --> 00:55:26.060
You want to get real customers.

00:55:26.060 --> 00:55:27.920
You want to get real
money coming in.

00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:30.630
That's what we're doing
the business to do.

00:55:30.630 --> 00:55:34.745
But I think these opportunities
you talk about are there.

00:55:34.745 --> 00:55:36.110
JEREMY HYLTON: All right, great.

00:55:36.110 --> 00:55:36.770
Thanks so much.

00:55:36.770 --> 00:55:37.340
LAWRENCE D. BURNS:
Thanks everybody.

00:55:37.340 --> 00:55:38.298
I really appreciate it.

00:55:38.298 --> 00:55:40.690
[APPLAUSE]
