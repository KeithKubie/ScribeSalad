00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:01.680
Welcome back.

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.470
Now I think that hopefully you
have some intuition, and maybe

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:07.090
you can figure this out
on your own, but I'll

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:07.760
show how to do it.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.920
We spent a lot of time on how
fast did I throw the ball--

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.050
how fast was it when it left my
hand-- so let's figure out

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:14.970
how high did it go, because
that's kind of a cool thing to

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:17.110
know, as well.

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:23.070
We figured out that the final
velocity-- actually, the

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.840
initial velocity-- is just
equal to minus the

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.530
acceleration of gravity
times time over 2.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.650
If we say that the acceleration
of gravity is

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.530
minus 10 meters per second
squared, then this becomes

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.970
5t-- so that's initial velocity,
and the final

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.695
velocity is just the negative
of the initial velocity.

00:00:46.695 --> 00:00:50.140
It's going back to what
we were doing before.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.260
The initial velocity--
we want to figure out

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.140
how high did we go?

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.970
Let's just go back to our
basic-- we want to figure out

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:57.700
this point, and we want
to figure out how high

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.820
did this thing go.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.650
That's actually the for vertex
of this parabola, and if you

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.739
know the formula for a vertex of
parabola, you could do it--

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.010
once again, I like to do it
intuitively, as opposed to

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:08.440
memorizing formulas.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.200
We want to figure out how
high did this go--

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.440
let's call that h.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.030
So what happens?

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:20.880
I'm going from an initial
velocity of vi, and I'm going

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.620
to a final velocity-- well, not
a final velocity, you can

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.940
call this an intermediate
velocity-- a velocity of 0.

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.020
It takes a time of t sub naught
over 2-- that doesn't

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:44.660
look too good-- it takes
t over 2, or t

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.150
sub naught over 2.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.520
I know it gets confusing when
it's t sub naught-- t sub

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.260
naught just says this is an
actual constant t as opposed

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.220
to just the variable t,
and that's all it is.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.810
I know it can get confusing
sometimes.

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.710
So, the initial velocity is
equal to minus g times

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:00.990
whatever we time, or
whatever time your

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.790
friend gets on the timer.

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.060
But we also know that between
time 0 and t sub naught over

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.350
2-- so half the time that your
friend has on the timer-- the

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:16.100
velocity went from this
velocity to 0.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.070
The average velocity over that
time-- not the average

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.780
velocity over the entire time,
the average velocity over just

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:30.650
this first interval-- the
average velocity here would

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:39.770
just be v sub i plus 0, because
we're kind of this

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:45.070
intermediate velocity, because
we're stationary up here, so

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.440
we divide that by 2.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.760
v sub i is just this, so if we
take this, and substitute

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:59.270
here, we get their average
velocity over this time

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:04.810
interval is equal to
minus g times t sub

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.440
naught over 4, now.

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.830
Remember, this is only the
average velocity over this

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.760
time period-- the average
velocity over the entire time

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.310
period over t sub naught is
actually 0, because we start

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.200
and end at the same place.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.630
This is kind of an interesting
point as to how speed and

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.250
velocity is different.

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.560
You're probably thinking--
hey, Sal, how could the

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.530
average velocity over the entire
time be 0, when the

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.450
ball was clearly going quite
fast most of the time?

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:33.820
That's the difference between
speed and velocity.

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.960
It turns out that the speed was,
I agree with you, quite

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.080
fast the entire time, but when
you take the average velocity,

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.490
all the times that the velocity
was positive, is

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:47.760
balanced off by the times that
the velocity is negative.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.580
Over the entire period, the
average of the velocity is 0,

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.960
and that makes sense because,
the ball didn't go anywhere--

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.500
it just came back to where it
started, and so that's an

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.030
interesting distinction between
speed and velocity.

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.840
Anyway-- going back, and I hope
I'm not confusing you--

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:11.440
the average velocity over this
time period is minus g times t

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.540
sub naught over 4.

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.250
If we were to graph it here,
that would be right here-- it

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:21.574
would be essentially this,
at this point.

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.140
This is our average velocity
over half the time period, and

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.270
it would be equal to
v sub i over 2,

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.050
which is equal to this.

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.360
We know our average velocity
over this time period, and we

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.500
also know the time-- the time is
t sub naught over 2, so we

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.710
can just say change in distance
is equal to average

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.030
velocity times time.

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.610
What's the average velocity?

00:04:51.610 --> 00:05:05.660
It's all this stuff minus
gt sub naught over 4.

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:15.090
The average velocity is this,
and what's the time?

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.250
We're saying the average
velocity over t sub naught

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:21.960
over 2, not the whole t sub
naught-- maybe if I do some

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.625
examples with numbers, this
won't be as confusing.

00:05:24.625 --> 00:05:28.150
So, the time is t sub
naught over 2.

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:35.350
So t sub naught over 2.

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:37.470
That's the time.

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:43.235
And so the distance we traveled,
h, is equal to-- if

00:05:43.235 --> 00:05:54.840
we multiply it out-- minus gt
sub naught squared over 8.

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.170
That's interesting.

00:05:56.170 --> 00:06:00.950
If I throw a ball, and so this
is h-- I know I'm making this

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:09.360
really crowded-- if I throw a
ball, and it takes 5 seconds

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:14.560
to go all the way up, and
go all the way down.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.330
If I just substituted in this
equation so that it takes 5

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:22.420
seconds to go all the way up,
and all the way down-- once

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:25.950
again, this is minus g, so if
gravity is actually a minus 10

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:29.190
meters per second, so this
becomes a positive.

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:34.840
Going back, if I say h is
equal to-- so minus g is

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:38.850
positive 10 meters per second
times 5 seconds.

00:06:41.725 --> 00:06:52.630
It's 10 times 5 over 8, so
40 over 8 equals 50--

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:53.755
oh, sorry, t squared.

00:06:53.755 --> 00:06:55.180
I was about to say something,
because that's

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:58.300
not right-- t squared.

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:02.230
It's minus g t naught
squared over 8.

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:04.050
So what's 10 times 25?

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:13.880
It's 250 over 8, so that's
30 something meters--

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:15.430
it's like 31 meters.

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:18.420
So if I can throw a ball, and
it stays in the air for a

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:22.150
total of 5 seconds, I threw it
31 meters into the air-- that

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:28.280
might not sound high, but
31 meters is 93 feet.

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.490
That's equivalent to a nine
story building, so that

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:32.120
actually is pretty high.

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:36.260
If you can if you can keep a
ball in the air for 5 seconds,

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.240
you're pretty strong.

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:39.800
I want to show you something
else that's kind of

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:42.020
interesting, or at least
interesting to me.

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:43.880
Let me erase some of this,
just because I think it's

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.315
getting really crazy now.

00:07:46.315 --> 00:07:48.200
Let me erase this stuff.

00:07:54.164 --> 00:07:58.030
See, I'll even erase
this stuff.

00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:00.340
I think you get it now, and
you can just back up and

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:02.990
rewatch it-- that's the beauty
of these videos.

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:06.710
You don't really have to take
notes, but just back it up and

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:07.960
rewatch the video.

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:12.230
OK.

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:15.350
I think I have a clean
space now.

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:18.080
So let me just do a
nice color, and

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.260
back to the pen tool.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:28.250
We got that the height is
equal to minus gt naught

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:35.059
squared over 8, but we could
have also written this as--

00:08:35.059 --> 00:08:37.710
I'm just playing around with
this algebraically-- this is

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:49.870
the same thing as minus g over
2 times t naught squared-- t

00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:51.370
naught over 2 squared.

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:54.220
This is just the exact
same thing.

00:08:54.220 --> 00:09:00.030
I was wondering, does this
concept look familiar?

00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:00.600
Well, sure.

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:04.130
This is in our distance equation
that we did before,

00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:10.500
where we just say that that
change in distance is equal to

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:17.460
the initial velocity times time
plus at squared over 2.

00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:26.780
This term right here looks an
awfully lot like this term,

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:30.170
and this would be equivalent
to this equation if this

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:32.670
initial velocity was 0.

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:36.090
So how does this relate?

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:40.440
Another way to think about it
is this distance that you're

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:48.990
traveling up, it's also the same
distance-- maybe just the

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:52.045
negative-- of the distance
that you travel down.

00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:02.520
If we said that we're starting
at this point, at this point

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:05.540
the ball is stationary, so it's
identical to just taking

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:09.660
that ball, and dropping it.

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:13.300
If we say that we're going to
drop a ball from height h, how

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:15.000
long does it take?

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.240
Then we can use this formula.

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:21.200
If I drop a ball from height h,
the change in distance is

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:24.710
going to be minus h, because
it's going to go from height h

00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:29.460
to 0, and so we could say that
minus h is equal to-- the

00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:32.930
initial velocity is
going to be 0.

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:33.260
Whoops!

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:34.860
I'm over time.
