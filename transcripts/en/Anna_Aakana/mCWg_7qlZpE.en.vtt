00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.360
You know what I love?

00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:03.420
*holy music* Yasss

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.200
Oh my God!  Ohhh!

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.160
High-five girl!

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.680
Yes, self esteem is great, but even more than that

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.680
I love hanging out with my homies.

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.400
So when I go on Facebook and I see that they have all hung out without me,

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:16.380
I get sad.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.500
*Haunted house piano*

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.820
Sometimes my feelings of being left out are totally justified.

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.780
Why wasn't I invited to the family reunion?

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.500
And sometimes they're not.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.420
Why wasn't I invited to your bachelor party?

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:30.720
You're...not a dude?

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.300
I get so worried about being, like, excluded from something or forgotten about

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.860
that sometimes I try to preemptively get myself invited to things.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.060
Oh yeah, I heard about this really cool place in Malibu where you can do Go-karts.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.620
*gasps*

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:42.800
Oh my God!  That sounds like so much fun!

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.620
We should do it!  We should all go together like, as friends

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:45.720
and hang out and do that.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:46.220
Lets do it.

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.380
Why don't we put it on the books right now?

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.780
Like, I have Tuesday night free.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:49.520
What about you guys?

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.080
Get out your phones.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.820
Look at your schedules.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:51.600
Lets make a plan!

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.040
But then I realize how stupid this is

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.100
because none of my friends are going to intentionally exclude me from anything.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.020
Like, if they don't invite me maybe they just don't think its my jam

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:00.540
or maybe it was a mistake.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:01.800
I know these things can happen.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.680
People just forget!

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.820
Cause I forgot 2 days ago.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.060
I was throwing a party and my friend heard about it and messaged me

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.900
and she was like hey I heard you were having this party and I'm not invited.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.420
Totally understand if you don't want me there

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.040
But I think you just forgot about me?

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.740
And she was right!

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.940
I totally did and I felt so bad and I apologized and invited her.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.460
But it kind of changed the way that I think about it, you know?

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.340
I was like: "Oh

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.060
now instead of feeling sad and left out when people forget to invite me to things,

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.660
I'm just going to plan as many activities as possible

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.840
so that I'm constantly hanging out with people as much as I can stand them.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:34.340
*Evil sound plays*

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:35.540
Is this good advice?

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:36.300
I don't know!

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.460
But it's really working for me right now!

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:39.820
I'm Anna Akana.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.480
