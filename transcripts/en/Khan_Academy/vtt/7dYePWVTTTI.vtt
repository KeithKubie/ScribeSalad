00:00:00.462 --> 00:00:01.530
- [Voiceover] Hello, grammarians!

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:02.705
Hello, Paige!
- [Voiceover] Hi, David.

00:00:02.705 --> 00:00:03.802
So today we're gonna be talking about

00:00:03.802 --> 00:00:05.802
commas in space and time

00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:10.246
because commas have basically
one function, which is--

00:00:10.246 --> 00:00:11.674
- [Voiceover] Separating
parts of sentences.

00:00:11.674 --> 00:00:14.182
- [Voiceover] Separating
parts of sentences.

00:00:14.182 --> 00:00:16.039
And what's neat is that we can use commas

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:19.116
to separate stuff out in space

00:00:19.116 --> 00:00:21.310
and separate stuff out in time.

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.433
So I'm gonna handle space;
Paige is gonna do time.

00:00:24.433 --> 00:00:26.152
It's gonna be sweet.

00:00:26.152 --> 00:00:29.263
So first of all, one way
in which you can use commas

00:00:29.263 --> 00:00:33.176
to separate space is by
talking about addresses,

00:00:33.176 --> 00:00:36.542
people's physical addresses in space.

00:00:36.542 --> 00:00:40.542
So the fictitious private
detective, Nero Wolfe,

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.356
one of my very favorites,

00:00:44.356 --> 00:00:46.745
is supposed to live at

00:00:46.745 --> 00:00:49.589
454 West 35th Street in New York.

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:51.807
So if I wanted to write
Mister Wolfe a letter,

00:00:51.807 --> 00:00:53.385
and I would write him a letter
because he hates talking

00:00:53.385 --> 00:00:55.649
on the phone, I would address it like so,

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.562
separating all elements of
his address with commas.

00:00:59.562 --> 00:01:01.312
So Nero Wolfe, comma,

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:04.400
454 West 35th Street,

00:01:09.965 --> 00:01:10.798
comma,

00:01:13.389 --> 00:01:14.556
New York City,

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.929
or just New York, comma,

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:18.762
New York.

00:01:21.017 --> 00:01:25.184
And then I would put the zip
code, which I think is 10001,

00:01:26.195 --> 00:01:28.088
but I'm not sure if they had zip codes

00:01:28.088 --> 00:01:30.723
when those stories took
place, but it doesn't matter.

00:01:30.723 --> 00:01:33.261
You separate out all of these elements

00:01:33.261 --> 00:01:34.261
with commas.

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.357
And this isn't just for writing addresses;

00:01:37.357 --> 00:01:41.065
this is for referring to any
point in space on the Planet.

00:01:41.065 --> 00:01:43.247
So if I wanted to tell you
the name of my favorite city

00:01:43.247 --> 00:01:45.349
on the Planet, I would say:

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:46.516
"Ouagadougou",

00:01:49.412 --> 00:01:51.245
comma, "Burkina Faso."

00:01:54.568 --> 00:01:55.401
Real place.

00:01:55.401 --> 00:01:56.234
I've never been there.

00:01:56.234 --> 00:01:58.120
I would like to go someday.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.835
And that is how you use commas in space.

00:02:01.835 --> 00:02:04.752
Paige, how are commas used in time?

00:02:05.608 --> 00:02:09.049
- [Voiceover] So commas are used in dates.

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:10.100
- [Voiceover] OK.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.024
- [Voiceover] So,

00:02:12.024 --> 00:02:14.024
I could say: on Tuesday,

00:02:15.198 --> 00:02:16.948
comma, October fifth,

00:02:18.321 --> 00:02:19.321
comma, 2010,

00:02:21.688 --> 00:02:23.605
comma, I ate a cricket.

00:02:26.448 --> 00:02:30.581
So, as you can see, we've
separated the day of the week

00:02:30.581 --> 00:02:33.998
from the day of the month, October fifth,

00:02:34.981 --> 00:02:37.245
from the year, 2010,

00:02:37.245 --> 00:02:39.753
and then separated all that
from the rest of the sentence:

00:02:39.753 --> 00:02:40.786
I ate a cricket.

00:02:40.786 --> 00:02:42.516
- [Voiceover] Because all of
this is like a prepositional

00:02:42.516 --> 00:02:46.336
phrase that is modifying the word ate.

00:02:46.336 --> 00:02:47.230
- [Voiceover] True.

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:48.724
- [Voiceover] So we wanna
make sure that all of it

00:02:48.724 --> 00:02:51.557
is separated out from
the rest of the sentence;

00:02:51.557 --> 00:02:54.727
and we separate it out
using our friend, the comma.

00:02:54.727 --> 00:02:55.560
- [Voiceover] Of course.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.118
- [Voiceover] So if you
want to express a kind of

00:02:57.118 --> 00:02:59.928
complicated relationship
in time or in space,

00:02:59.928 --> 00:03:03.121
you wanna make sure a letter
gets to a very specific place,

00:03:03.121 --> 00:03:04.944
you wanna talk about a very specific city

00:03:04.944 --> 00:03:08.241
in a very specific
country, you use commas.

00:03:08.241 --> 00:03:11.085
You wanna talk about a very
specific time, you use commas.

00:03:11.085 --> 00:03:14.661
That's commas in space
and time, my grammarians.

00:03:14.661 --> 00:03:15.938
You can learn anything.

00:03:15.938 --> 00:03:16.771
David out.

00:03:16.771 --> 00:03:18.456
- [Voiceover] Paige out.
