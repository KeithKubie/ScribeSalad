00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:11.110
The best movie twists are the ones that change
everything that came before it.

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:14.520
Ones that make you want to immediately go
back and rewatch the movie for clues you may

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.520
have missed.&nbsp;

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:21.210
Movies like this are the reason spoiler warnings
were invented, so consider yourself warned.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.670
However these twists were so good that they’ve
become common pop culture knowledge and required

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.320
viewing for any film fan.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.529
So if you still don’t know who Luke Skywalker’s
father is, we apologize in advance.&nbsp;

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.100
Here are 10 shocking plot twists you never
saw coming

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.500
Empire Strikes Back

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.300
The first Star Wars film set up one of cinema’s
all time greatest villains.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.760
Not only did we see Darth Vader is willing
to decimate entire planets, we also learned

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:51.449
that he was directly responsible for the death
of our hero’s father.

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.109
Fans who lined up around the block to see
Luke take on Vader had no idea what was in

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:56.109
store for them.&nbsp;

00:00:56.109 --> 00:00:59.539
Can you imagine what would have happened if
Empire Strikes Back had come out in the internet

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:03.659
age?

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:07.560
One of the all-time greatest movie plot twists
probably would have been spoiled for millions

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.630
by fanboys who had just had their minds blown.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.960
Considered by many to be the definitive Star
Wars movie, Empire set the bar for franchise

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:23.130
plot twists.&nbsp;

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.190
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows&nbsp;

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:26.190
You have to give J.K.

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.150
Rowling credit for keeping a secret for seven
books and seven movies.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.840
Snape was always one of the most interesting
characters in the Harry Potter universe, but

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.860
we had no idea how important his role would
be until the story’s final instalment.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.219
Clearly never a fan of Potter’s, we never
knew if the professor was a full fledged practitioner

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:44.670
of the dark arts, or just kind of a dick.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.509
When he killed Dumbledore at the end of Harry
Potter and the Half Blood Prince,&nbsp; that question

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.749
seemed to have a pretty definitive answer.&nbsp;

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:54.590
In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows it’s
revealed that this was all part of an elaborate

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.369
plan Snape and Dumbledore concocted and Snape
has been helping Harry all along, it changes

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.869
everything you thought you knew about the
character.

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:05.670
Acting out of an unrequited love for Harry’s
mother, it’s Snape who sacrifices the most

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.950
to rid the world of Voldemort.&nbsp;

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.630
Oldboy&nbsp;

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.170
Is there a more messed up, harder hitting
twist ending than Oldboy?

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.460
I don’t think so.

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:20.019
When Dae-Su Oh finally learns the reason behind
his mysterious 16 year incarceration and the

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:23.920
strange string of events that followed, he
probably wished he’d never gotten out of

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:24.970
that hotel room.

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.410
An elaborate revenge plot involving hypnosis
and incest make this one of the most shocking

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.920
movie endings of all time.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.530
The Force Awakens&nbsp;
With The Force Awakens now on Blu-ray, Star

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.739
Wars fans have had ample opportunity to see
it.

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.080
The cat’s out of the bag.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.350
Our favourite smuggler bit the dust at the
hands of his own son.

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.569
This development had people talking in hushed
tones when the film was first released for

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:49.920
fear of spoiling it for anyone who hadn’t
seen it yet.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.519
It was the best kept secret in a film with
many secrets and surprises.

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.310
With much of the movie based around Solo,
it felt like a proper sendoff while also setting

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.870
up Kylo Ren as a heartless villain.

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.519
If only Han had known that walking out onto
a bridge like that never ends well in Star

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.409
Wars.&nbsp;

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:05.620
The Departed&nbsp;

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.010
The ending of The Departed confused many people.

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.159
The movie had so many double crosses that
you’re left with a pile of rats with their

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:12.430
tales in one big knot.

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.909
Mark Wahlberg’s character seemed to be the
only honest cop, until the film’s last scene

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:19.079
when we see him take out Matt Damon’s character
gangland style.

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:22.750
While Wahlberg is still acting in the interest
of the police, he’s employing the other

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.739
side’s tactics to get the job done.&nbsp;

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:26.830
Book of Eli&nbsp;

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:30.990
The Book of Eli did an excellent of foreshadowing
its twist without giving it away.

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:35.350
As we follow Denzel Washington’s Eli through
this post apocalyptic world, nobody else seems

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:40.239
better equipped to handle its threats.

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:43.940
More than capable of defending himself against
cannibals and other enemies, it’s revealed

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.459
at the end that he has been navigating these
dangers without the benefit of sight.

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.360
If you watch the film with this knowledge
you’ll notice him listening and feeling

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.209
his way through scenes as Eli takes a page
out of Daredevil’s book by using his other

00:03:54.209 --> 00:04:06.790
heightened senses to survive.&nbsp;

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.409
The Usual Suspects&nbsp;

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:12.870
The Usual Suspects is about a mastermind criminal
pulling the wool over a detective’s eyes,

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.799
and fooling all of us in the process.

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:18.900
Director Brian Singer crafted such an elaborate
web of lies that even the most of the cast

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:26.070
didn’t know who the real Keyser Soze was
until they saw the film.

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.360
Singer pulls a real cinematic magic trick
by having us look one way and believe Gabriel

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.210
Byrne’s Keaton had orchestrated the film’s
events before revealing that the real puppet

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:36.910
master was in front of us all along.

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.090
You can’t blame Detective Dave Kujan for
not suspecting the crippled Verbal Kint, Kevin

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:50.250
Spacey’s performance was so convincing that
he won an actor for his role.&nbsp;

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:51.750
The Sixth Sense&nbsp;

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.850
Sixth Sense is known for having one of the
best twist endings of all time.

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:58.420
It was so good that writer/ director M. Night
Shyamalan has been trying to match it ever

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.870
since with very little luck.

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.130
Watching the movie now, it seems painfully
obvious that Bruce Willis’s character dies

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:07.360
in the first scene and is a ghost for the
rest of the film, but seeing it for the first

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.470
time in 1999 had audiences getting right back
in line to find the clues they missed the

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:17.420
first time around.&nbsp;

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:18.420
Fight Club

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:22.820
The first rule of Fight Club is: you do not
talk about Fight Club’s ending with someone

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:23.850
who hasn’t seen it.

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:26.980
The second rule of Fight Club is: expect the
unexpected.

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:31.320
This explosive, mind-bending action comedy
helped the 90s go out with a bang by pitting

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:37.190
Edward Norton’s narrator against his alter
ego Tyler Durden.

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:41.160
Once you realize the two are one in the same,
it seems so illogical that revisiting the

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:47.350
film would surely disprove this left turn,
yet scrutinizing Fight Club only reveals that

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:50.760
David Fincher knew exactly what he was doing
the entire time.

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.120
Shutter Island&nbsp;

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.800
The name Shutter Island is an anagram for
“Truth and Lies”, which is quite fitting

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.490
for the story that sees Leonardo DiCaprio’s
detective character Teddy Daniels investigating

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:03.850
a patient missing from a hospital for the
criminally insane.

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:08.440
Much like Fight Club, the delusional protagonist
turns out to be his own antagonist, as Daniels

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:15.850
learns that he is in fact the missing the
patient and what we’ve been watching is

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:20.270
an elaborate fantasy the character created
to deal with past trauma.&nbsp;

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:23.850

plot twists you never saw coming.
