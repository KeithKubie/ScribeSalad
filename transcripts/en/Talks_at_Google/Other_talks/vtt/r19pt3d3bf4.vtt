&gt;&gt;Peter Fortenbaugh: Alright, good afternoon
everybody.

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:04.430
My name's Peter Fortenbaugh.

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.540
I'm executive director of the Boys and Girls
Clubs of Peninsula and I wanna thank you for

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:09.630
having us here today.

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.380
A special thanks to David Lawee who arranged
it.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.820
I really appreciate it and Patty and Cindy
for doing all this and Cliff behind the scenes

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.310
for making this possible.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:20.619
So thank you very much.

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:25.439
As I was coming here today I was thinking
about Google and the Boys and Girls Clubs

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.339
and I realized that we actually have a very
fundamentally shared value, or fundamentally

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:34.970
shared important value which is the idea of
creating opportunities for everybody and making

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.450
the world more flat and creating opportunities
for people who maybe used to be disenfranchised.

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.960
And you think about Google's mission to really
democratize information and to make information

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.230
available to people that it didn't used to
be so they now have opportunities that didn't

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:49.800
used to be possible.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.210
At the Boys and Girls Club, our vision is
for all of our youth to grow up to become

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.610
self sufficient adults.

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.660
Now there's a challenge there because today,
right here in the heart of Silicon Valley,

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.869
just four miles from where we're sitting,
over half the kids are dropping out of high

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:08.390
school and that's the challenge that we face
at the Boys and Girls Clubs, that's the problem

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.760
that we're addressing, that we're trying to
solve.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:16.440
We do that through two ways, the first step
we have is to bring our members in to track

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.440
the youth and provide them a sense of belonging
and to give them a place where they can be

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.780
safe, have relationships with adults and really
get a sense that someone cares about them

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.340
and they belong.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.700
The second thing we do is we help instill
in them, help them develop, the academic and

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.350
life skills they need to thrive.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.840
So I thought what we'd do today is share with
you some of the stories of some of our amazing

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.960
members so you can hear from them directly
how growing up in circumstances that are very

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:48.200
challenging, they've persevered, they thrived
and they've really developed the skills required

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.650
to be successful and are amazing, amazing
young men and women.

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:56.340
So, before they actually speak we're gonna
show a video that was created by a teen in

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.650
Redwood City, it's a partnership with Adobe
as well as the Black Eyed Peas and the Peapod

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:01.810
Academy.

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.280
And this is a video and a song that our teen
created, wrote themselves and I think it gives

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.530
you a good insight into their lives and where
they're, where they see themselves breaking

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.810
a pattern and becoming very successful.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.630
This is called "Be the Difference."

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.640

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.280

I am the difference.

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:09.460
Poverty, the issue of the ages, you and I
can change this, we write the pages.

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:10.460
Homeless sleepin' on the street, layin' on
the concrete shiverin' to death cause they

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:11.460
can't afford some socks on they feet.

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:12.460
A random act of kindness can help cure the
blindness.

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:13.460
We need to be the voice cause it's time to
break the silence.

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:14.460
You and I can save them.

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:15.460
We don't need to blame them.

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:16.460
Pray to God to give us strength, in Jesus
name, Amen.

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:17.460
You can be the greatest, education makes you
greater.

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:18.460
More knowledge, more ways to get paper, flawless,
yeah, straight out of college, now that's

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:19.460
the real definition of ballin'.

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:20.460
And average of 32 percent graduate, the percentage
of dropouts, 68.

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:21.460
All you gotta do stay in school stay focused.

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:22.460
You can be a part of 32 and you know.

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:23.460

I am the difference.

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:40.460
On the streets a place where you're brutalized,
it says in the Bible that God had already

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:41.460
visualized his sons and daughters on planet
earth with transgression.

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:42.460
Livin' on the street but they could never
confess it.

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:43.460
Now it's time to change the hood and how we
livin', I'm the change in my neighborhood

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:44.460
always stand above it.

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:45.460
Murder rates decreased, now increase the peace.

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:46.460
If you down with the change then follow me.

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:47.460
All I see is is guys with gang signs on they
chest tryin' follow up they older brother's

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:48.460
ghetto footsteps.

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:49.460
I'm gonna tell you like this do you and no
one else, try to set a good example to those

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:50.460
who need help and just know you ain't alone
you got family that got your back, see I'm

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:51.460
a role model keepin' my young bros on track.

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:52.460
Yeah, I'm a changed man but you can call me
the difference, a role model quick to teach

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:53.460
you in an instant.

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:54.460
I am the difference, future lookin' bright
green.

There's nobody like me.

Know what I'm sayin'?

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:57.460
I am the difference, I take the lead.

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:58.460
You can get beside me.

I am the difference.

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:07.460
Nobody can hold us down you know, you know,
you know.

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:08.460
Nobody can hold us back you know, you know.

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:09.460
They don't believe in me but that's a steamin'
me, the motivation that keeps me on the feet.

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.130
That's because the difference is me.

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:17.817
I am the difference, future lookin' bright
green.

00:05:17.817 --> 00:05:18.817
There's nobody like me.

[Music plays]

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:23.710
&gt;&gt;Peter Fortenbaugh: So hopefully that gives
you a sense of the emotional energy that's

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:24.710
created at the Boys and Girls Clubs.

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:25.710
You saw some footage there from a Redwood
City clubhouse where a lot of our members,

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:26.710
who are here today, recorded that.

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:30.230
And that sense of belonging they get and such
a purpose that they get with our programs.

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:37.800
Next up I'd like to introduce our youth of
the year from 2011, last year, this is Ms.

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:41.820
Nancy Orosio who's gonna share with you her
story about being a member at the Boys and

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:43.860
Girls Clubs.

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:45.500
[Applause]

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:52.050
&gt;&gt;Nancy Orosio: Thank you.

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:56.760
So, good evening, I'm sorry, good afternoon
everyone I'm Nancy.

00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:00.100
I am currently a sophomore attending Santa
Clara University.

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:06.819
I graduated from Sacred Heart Preparatory
in Atherton in 2011 and, I'm studying political

00:07:06.819 --> 00:07:09.150
science.

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:14.419
So Peter asked me if I could come here and
share my story with you and, in reality, I

00:07:14.419 --> 00:07:19.630
had no idea what I was supposed to talk about
because my story entails a lot of different,

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:24.460
I would say, aspects and so I'm gonna go ahead
and give you a very raw, like, outline of

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:28.580
the things I've been through and where I'm
going from there.

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:30.100
I'm the oldest of three children.

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:32.770
I am born to immigrant parents.

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:36.910
I was born in Mexico and I came to the US
when I was 11 months old, so I've grown up

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:38.410
here since.

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:47.880
I know no other home and I grew up with my
mom as my biggest mentor and neither of my

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:49.880
parents finished middle school.

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:56.349
So that gives you an idea of how much guidance
I had in terms of what education looked like.

00:07:56.349 --> 00:08:02.669
And my mother whom didn't finish seventh grade
kept telling, "You need to go to school and

00:08:02.669 --> 00:08:05.979
you need to graduate from High School and
you need to go to college and you're gonna

00:08:05.979 --> 00:08:10.230
be whatever you wanna be when you grow up
as long as you work hard and as long as you

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:11.480
stay in school."

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:18.449
Now, those words meant something that I didn't
really grasp the meaning of at the time and

00:08:18.449 --> 00:08:22.340
now I know that they've made all the difference
in the world because when you have parents

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:26.479
that care, you have a foundation set for you.

00:08:26.479 --> 00:08:31.610
And that is something that I was very lucky
to have that a lot of my friends in the community

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:34.159
that you saw in the video, didn't have.

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:40.469
I had parents who cared and I had parents
who pushed me and who believed that even though

00:08:40.469 --> 00:08:44.399
they didn't speak English and even though
they didn't have an education themselves,

00:08:44.399 --> 00:08:50.300
they could provide me with something that
they weren't able, they didn't have the opportunity

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:51.600
to.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:56.910
So when I was in middle school I remember
going to school and talking to friends and

00:08:56.910 --> 00:09:02.639
our, I think the one thing that we looked
forward was always after school because we

00:09:02.639 --> 00:09:10.019
would hang out and go do maybe things that
we weren't supposed to do and that was the

00:09:10.019 --> 00:09:11.889
best time of our day.

00:09:11.889 --> 00:09:17.509
It wasn't really being in school and it wasn't
really being about th-, sorry, thinking about

00:09:17.509 --> 00:09:21.300
college or thinking about what we wanted to
do as a career.

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:27.329
I was very lucky because I was lured into
the Boys and Girls Club and there I found

00:09:27.329 --> 00:09:34.239
people who talked about college and talked
about a career and talked about an education

00:09:34.239 --> 00:09:37.480
and how you could be someone in the world
and how you could be a difference and how

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:44.350
you could change the world but it took a lot
of support and it took a lot of people for

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:46.790
me to realize what that meant.

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:50.850
And I thought it was really cool that you
could be a leader in your community but I

00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:53.329
didn't really know what that looked like.

00:09:53.329 --> 00:09:59.149
And I thought that I could change the world
but I didn't know how I wanted to do that.

00:09:59.149 --> 00:10:08.509
So my mentors, Tracy being one of them, were
really crucial and I'm talking about mentors

00:10:08.509 --> 00:10:14.329
including my mom and the Boys and Girls Club
and at school because, essentially, even though

00:10:14.329 --> 00:10:18.879
I had it in me and even though I had the desire
I wouldn’t have, I wouldn't have gotten

00:10:18.879 --> 00:10:22.429
to college if it wasn't for them and I wouldn't
have got to Sacred Heart.

00:10:22.429 --> 00:10:31.069
So, basically, I grew up in a place where
gangs, drugs, alcohol and graffiti were an

00:10:31.069 --> 00:10:32.220
everyday thing.

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:36.319
You would see it everywhere, you would see
it in your friends, in your family and it

00:10:36.319 --> 00:10:38.029
was kind of like the norm.

00:10:38.029 --> 00:10:42.759
And very few people were even expected to
graduate from high school and even middle

00:10:42.759 --> 00:10:43.759
school.

00:10:43.759 --> 00:10:48.350
I had a cousin and a friend who never graduated
from middle school.

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:55.000
So if high school was the objective some people
didn't even get there.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:04.050
So, lucky for me, as I mentioned earlier,
I got to the Boys and Girls Club and I applied

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:09.879
to Sacred Heart and when I got to Sacred Heart
I thought that was one of the biggest accomplishments,

00:11:09.879 --> 00:11:12.079
going to a private Catholic school.

00:11:12.079 --> 00:11:17.569
But then I realized that the expectations
there were very different than in my neighborhood.

00:11:17.569 --> 00:11:22.480
In my neighborhood, if you graduated from
middle school you were cool, you were alright,

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:29.160
you were set ,whereas, at Sacred Heart it
was about getting to an Ivy League school,

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:34.220
something that had never even crossed my mind.

00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:42.320
It took a lot of people for me to realize
that I could do it and sometimes, as much

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:45.320
as I wanted to, I didn't see the path.

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:52.049
I had to reach out to other people to remind
me what it took and it takes hard work, it

00:11:52.049 --> 00:11:59.379
takes my mother's encouragement, it takes
an organization like the Boys and Girls Club

00:11:59.379 --> 00:12:05.249
and it takes, basically, people to believe
in you, because I was not very different than

00:12:05.249 --> 00:12:07.319
my friends in middle school.

00:12:07.319 --> 00:12:13.829
I was not special, I was not smarter, I was
not any richer, I didn't have anything other

00:12:13.829 --> 00:12:19.680
than my mother and people who cared about
me and that was what made a difference for

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:20.779
me.

00:12:20.779 --> 00:12:26.980
And I think my best friend in middle school,
who now has two babies, could have had the

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:33.859
same opportunities that I did but she didn't
because circumstances were different for her

00:12:33.859 --> 00:12:37.319
and she didn't have a support network like
the Boys and Girls Club.

00:12:37.319 --> 00:12:41.170
She didn't have a mom who cared and who would
tell her you can do anything in the world

00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:45.149
if you only go to school.

00:12:45.149 --> 00:12:55.850
So, I guess where I'm going with this is that
you don't have to be rich, you don't have

00:12:55.850 --> 00:13:00.449
to be superwoman to make a difference in someone's
life.

00:13:00.449 --> 00:13:08.810
You only need some time, commitment and that's
all that it took for me because I realized

00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:14.889
that the people that I grew up with had very
little faith in themselves.

00:13:14.889 --> 00:13:18.699
And sometimes when you don't have faith in
yourself it takes someone else to tell you,

00:13:18.699 --> 00:13:22.189
you can do it, and I had that.

00:13:22.189 --> 00:13:29.470
I had that and I also had the desire, meaning,
because I saw how hard my parents grew up.

00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:36.109
And seeing my mom be a housekeeper and my
dad a construction worker coming home everyday

00:13:36.109 --> 00:13:40.100
really late made me realize that I didn't
want a future like that for myself and my

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:41.980
own children.

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:50.040
And that was one of the things that, that
really drove me to stay at Sacred Heart, do

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:52.820
the work that it required and to get to Santa
Clara.

00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:58.540
Now, it wasn't easy and especially because
I didn't have parents with an education, I

00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:04.459
didn't have parents who knew how to navigate
an education sys-, the education system but

00:14:04.459 --> 00:14:05.999
I asked for help.

00:14:05.999 --> 00:14:11.000
And I asked for tutors and I asked for mentors
and I asked, I asked people to help me because

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.660
I cared and because they seemed to care for
me as well.

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:24.839
And one of the things that one of my mentors
once told me was that educating and mentoring

00:14:24.839 --> 00:14:31.440
a child like me was not only an investment
of time in me but it was an investment in

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:36.459
a community and when you dedicate time to
one child you're making a difference, not

00:14:36.459 --> 00:14:43.160
only in one person's life but you're also
making a difference in a community.

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:49.060
So I hope that leaves you with a little bit
of something to think about and that you feel

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:54.279
a little compelled to come to the Boys and
Girls Club and to mentor children or to find

00:14:54.279 --> 00:14:59.889
someone who is willing to do the work that
it requires to be successful.

00:14:59.889 --> 00:15:02.779
Thank you.

00:15:02.779 --> 00:15:04.230
[Applause]

00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:10.939
&gt;&gt;Peter Fortenbaugh: Now I'd like to share
the story or the voice of one of the Boys

00:15:10.939 --> 00:15:12.799
and Girls Clubs staff.

00:15:12.799 --> 00:15:19.660
At the Boys and Girls Clubs we serve about
1,100 kids every single day about 1,800 kids

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:25.439
come at least 50 times or more a year, basically
around once a week across nine different locations

00:15:25.439 --> 00:15:31.379
all in East Palo Alto, Eastern Menlo Park
and unincorporated part of Redwood City.

00:15:31.379 --> 00:15:39.319
So we have about 180 employees who work with
us 45 full time and about 135 or so part time.

00:15:39.319 --> 00:15:43.470
The employees are really, the staff is really
where the magic happens because what we do

00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:47.769
with the youth, folks like Nancy, it's not
about a new program, it's not about a new

00:15:47.769 --> 00:15:50.470
technology, it's about relationships.

00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:54.499
And the only way you can really help these
young people achieve their potential is by

00:15:54.499 --> 00:15:57.240
connecting with them and they have to trust
you.

00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:00.109
And it's only through a meaningful relationship
that that can happen.

00:16:00.109 --> 00:16:03.790
So the most important thing for us at the
Boys and Girls Clubs is having the right staff

00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:10.089
and I'm gonna introduce the woman Miss Cherie
Kabba who runs our computer club house in

00:16:10.089 --> 00:16:11.199
East Palo Alto.

00:16:11.199 --> 00:16:17.109
She's absolutely one of our star staff because
she's an amazing technologist, she could be

00:16:17.109 --> 00:16:20.910
working here at Google if she wanted to, she
knows everything about technology there is

00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:27.940
to know but even more importantly she's a
kid magnet and you'll know why.

00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:32.420
And she gets the kids and they get her and
she's able to use the technology but then

00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:37.381
more importantly has a relationship to influence
the kids in East Palo Alto community, to stay

00:16:37.381 --> 00:16:39.990
in school, to make the right choices.

00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:44.839
So I'd like to ask Miss Chillin to come share
her perspective of why she's a Boys and Girls

00:16:44.839 --> 00:16:46.639
Club staff person.

00:16:46.639 --> 00:16:47.839
[Applause]

00:16:47.839 --> 00:16:51.689
&gt;&gt;Cherie Kabba: Thank you very much.

00:16:51.689 --> 00:16:53.249
I am Cherie Kabba.

00:16:53.249 --> 00:16:56.410
The kids call me Miss Chillin', my stage name
is Chillin the conscious poet.

00:16:56.410 --> 00:17:03.000
I'm a retired poet, been on stage 25 years
and I like to think that I work for one of

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.220
the most amazing nonprofit organizations in
the country.

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:10.949
And the reason why I say that is not cause
of the awesome staff but it's because of the

00:17:10.949 --> 00:17:11.949
kids.

00:17:11.949 --> 00:17:14.569
This is the fourth state that I've lived in,
California.

00:17:14.569 --> 00:17:19.620
The community that I work in, East Palo Alto,
reflects the community that I come from in

00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:24.189
inner city Chicago and I'm just really blessed
to have the opportunity to share the space

00:17:24.189 --> 00:17:25.189
with them.

00:17:25.189 --> 00:17:29.270
I believe nothing happens by mistake and so
I'm there for a reason and I'm there till

00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:31.860
the Creator tells me that it's time to leave.

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:33.890
So I wanna share with you a story.

00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:39.460
I was sittin in a meeting with my supervisors,
Michael Jones and, of course, Peter Fortenbaugh

00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:40.590
and he asked me one question.

00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:47.549
He said, "Why do you do what you do in the
ICC?" and my response is simple, "I love my

00:17:47.549 --> 00:17:52.909
J-O-B" You see, I teach the youth to fall
in love with technology, metaphorically, I

00:17:52.909 --> 00:17:55.780
play cupid and my arrow is imagery.

00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:57.720
Please allow me to explain.

00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:04.330
In the stages of infancy even a craftsman
chooses a topic to study and develops a disciplined

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:05.610
of mastery.

00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:10.950
You see, in truth, I lure the young people
in the ICC by bringing life to originality

00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:16.789
then secretly I teach them how to increase
their vocabulary through spoken words.

00:18:16.789 --> 00:18:21.840
I curb their appetite of profanity with new
phrases and verses of opportunities.

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:26.610
I find other ways than scrolls and lily pads
to tell stories of struggles of not having

00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:27.610
a dad.

00:18:27.610 --> 00:18:31.830
We color inside the lines with the fine tunings
of rhythm and rhymes.

00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:37.049
I am a modern day griot and I combine the
West African traditions with our initiatives

00:18:37.049 --> 00:18:38.409
and missions.

00:18:38.409 --> 00:18:44.870
That village in the Proverbs that they speak
of to raise a family is calling us to a higher

00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:45.890
place of creativity.

00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:49.539
You see, this J-O-B allows me to be me.

00:18:49.539 --> 00:18:55.010
And when the Most High has given you the gift
to work with babies there's no time for complacency.

00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:58.830
You gotta bring ya "A" game to the table with
lots of energy.

00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:03.450
There's no clock to punch cause a 9 to 5 is
unheard of when paid by salary.

00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:08.980
And if the truth were told, there's no dollar
amount or silver and gold that could compensate

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:10.370
me for my competency.

00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:14.630
I don't do this for the money and I don't
do this just to be doin' something, see, as

00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:20.750
a matter of fact, I don't have one but two
Master's degrees but humbly I share my story

00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:22.990
to explain what I do is not for everybody.

00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:29.169
At a young age my purpose was spelled out
for me combining spoken word and technology

00:19:29.169 --> 00:19:30.850
is why I'm here, see.

00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:36.299
Case and point remember now, I play cupid
and Alfi, a young man I shot with imagery,

00:19:36.299 --> 00:19:38.350
he enters my department daily.

00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:44.490
His afternoons begins with givin' me a hug
and then briefly he brings life to his truths

00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:45.490
with sincerity.

00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:52.120
I listen intently as his non verbal speak
directly and though I am exploring the possibilities

00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:57.630
of how to capture this moment with Adobe and
how not to exploit but to document his story,

00:19:57.630 --> 00:20:02.700
his words are spoken with vitality and by
the time he takes a breath and begins to breathe

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:06.010
freely
[Takes a deep breath]

00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:11.460
&gt;&gt;Cherie Kabba: in one hand I placed a camera,
in the other a tri P-O-D.

00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:16.889
You see, Alfi now has my media crew and my
quest to continue this journey is never complete

00:20:16.889 --> 00:20:22.419
cause the reality of this J-O-B is it's not
a job but a lifestyle for myself and others

00:20:22.419 --> 00:20:28.279
like me and it is my responsibility to my
ancestors to carry the oral traditions until

00:20:28.279 --> 00:20:29.279
infinity.

00:20:29.279 --> 00:20:33.750
Now, don't get all caught up in this delivery
cause for a couple of decades I been doin'

00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:34.750
me.

00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:39.350
Don't mistake my words for hustle and flows,
aint no pimp in me, just L-O-V-E.

00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:46.799
And until technology is mandatory universally
my quest will forever be incomplete.

00:20:46.799 --> 00:20:52.440
So Pete, increasing literacy via technology
is why I do what I do in the ICC.

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:53.929
Thank you.

00:20:53.929 --> 00:20:55.419
[Applause]
[Cheering]

00:20:55.419 --> 00:20:59.149
&gt;&gt;Peter Fortenbaugh: Ms. Chillin', unbelievable.

00:20:59.149 --> 00:21:04.660
That's why I go to work every day.

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:05.660
Fantastic.

00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:09.070
Now I'd like to ask two of our fine young
gentlemen from the Redwood City Clubhouse

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:11.970
are gonna come up and share their stories.

00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:19.429
So [Lalo Salvadra] and Diamante Horton are
two of our Peapod Academy music stars and

00:21:19.429 --> 00:21:23.600
they're gonna share their story and then after
they share their story we're gonna be treated

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:27.409
to another song, another video and then a
live song they're gonna sing for us.

00:21:27.409 --> 00:21:29.199
Lalo, you first.

00:21:29.199 --> 00:21:32.629
&gt;&gt; [Jose Salvadra]: So, thank you Peter.

00:21:32.629 --> 00:21:35.490
My name is [Jose Salvadra].

00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:40.860
I'm 19 years old and I am currently enrolled
in Cosway Polytechnical College and I am a

00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:45.330
former member of the Boys and Girls Club of
the Peninsula, Mervin G. Morris Clubhouse

00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:46.669
to be specific.

00:21:46.669 --> 00:21:53.680
I first became involved with the club about
3 and a half years ago.

00:21:53.680 --> 00:22:01.000
I was really interested in music as a child
and also in high school and I began experimenting

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:07.340
with music at home just free downloadable
software, actually creating the music and

00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:11.919
I showed one of my projects to one of my friends
not knowing that she was a member of the Boys

00:22:11.919 --> 00:22:12.919
and Girls Club.

00:22:12.919 --> 00:22:16.350
So when she heard it she told me, she was
like, "Oh, well you should come to the Boys

00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:19.970
and Girls Club" and I was like, "Well, what's
at the Boys and Girls Club?

00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:24.750
Isn't it just like a place to take your kids
to babysit?" and she was like, "No, you know,

00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:29.269
they have a music studio, they have a bunch
of other programs and it's very teen oriented

00:22:29.269 --> 00:22:30.940
unlike what most people think."

00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:35.299
And a lot of people did think that it was
like a place to babysit kids and so as soon

00:22:35.299 --> 00:22:39.890
as she mentioned the studio I was like, "Oh,
you know, I've been dying to get the experience

00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:44.679
to be in an actual professional studio, what
the environments like."

00:22:44.679 --> 00:22:50.360
So I went and as soon as I walked in everyone
was welcoming me, "Oh, hello how you doing?

00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:51.409
What's your name?

00:22:51.409 --> 00:22:52.649
Oh, I'm so and so."

00:22:52.649 --> 00:22:58.367
So I was just like, "Wow, you don't even know
me why are you talking to me?"

00:22:58.367 --> 00:23:02.080
So I spent the whole day there and I really
enjoyed my time there and I was like, "Wow,

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:05.210
these people are asking about me and they
don't even know who I am.

00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:09.419
They actually showed interest to find out
who I am, what I do."

00:23:09.419 --> 00:23:16.650
So, you know, over time I started going once,
twice a week, three times a week, four times

00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:20.629
a week, I was there all week, they had to
start kicking me out when it was closing time

00:23:20.629 --> 00:23:22.440
and I would always be in the studio.

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:25.460
Now at this time I had just lost somebody.

00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:32.450
A dear friend of mine who I grew up with and
I really didn't know how to deal with it and

00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:36.950
then this was prior to joining the Boys and
Girls Club so I was kind of lost, didn't really

00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:42.240
know where to go, my personal life suffered
dearly as well as my academics.

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:48.059
But, being at the Boys and Girls Club really,
really, they really showed me that support

00:23:48.059 --> 00:23:54.629
because, like, I'd go in daylight in the studio
and I'd come out, like, and it was already

00:23:54.629 --> 00:23:55.629
dark.

00:23:55.629 --> 00:24:00.779
I started joining other programs such as the
Keystone program and the College Bound program.

00:24:00.779 --> 00:24:07.110
And the Boys and Girls Club found out that
I wasn't doing so hot with my academics and

00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:11.490
this is what really drew me in is that they're
very academic based so they said, "If you

00:24:11.490 --> 00:24:13.559
don't get your grades right you can't go into
the studio."

00:24:13.559 --> 00:24:17.759
So, me being me, I was like, "No, I have to
be in the studio."

00:24:17.759 --> 00:24:24.520
So that gave me an incentive, they found my
weak point and they made it my forte and I

00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:29.690
started working and I started working on my
academics, my grades increased and, you know,

00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:34.360
I was just very involved and, you know, kept
me out of trouble.

00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:40.820
A couple years passed by, graduation's coming
up and, you know, there was that support,

00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:41.820
you know, "You got this.

00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:43.249
You're gonna graduate."

00:24:43.249 --> 00:24:47.960
And with all my involvement, all the events,
just all my involvement with the Boys and

00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:53.020
Girls Club I was able to unknowingly build
a portfolio for myself.

00:24:53.020 --> 00:25:00.659
So this is what ultimately, you know, led
me to college and now what I plan to do is,

00:25:00.659 --> 00:25:07.281
within a year and a half, obtain my Bachelor's
degree and further pursue a Master's degree

00:25:07.281 --> 00:25:14.419
in music business and production and entrepreneurship
and what I wanna do is just take everything

00:25:14.419 --> 00:25:18.419
that the Boys and Girls Club did for me, through
the obstacles that I came over the past few

00:25:18.419 --> 00:25:24.019
years and I wanna be able to give back and
give back the same feeling, the same positivity,

00:25:24.019 --> 00:25:27.799
the same difference in the community that
they gave to me, to somebody else, for the

00:25:27.799 --> 00:25:30.669
next generation.

00:25:30.669 --> 00:25:33.360
[Applause]

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:41.450
&gt;&gt;Diamante Horton: Hello.

00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:43.530
I'm Diamante Horton.

00:25:43.530 --> 00:25:49.462
I was born in Portland, Oregon and then I
had moved down to Washington and then down

00:25:49.462 --> 00:25:56.860
to California, Redwood City and then I moved
to Patterson but between all that I kept a

00:25:56.860 --> 00:26:02.960
real strong bond with the Redwood City Boys
and Girls Club.

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:09.509
I was raised in a low income family.

00:26:09.509 --> 00:26:14.980
I was living in like an apartment, like one
bedroom.

00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:20.549
My mother slept on the floor and she gave
me the mattress.

00:26:20.549 --> 00:26:28.610
I was like so broke, so young that I didn't
notice what rich or what wealthy or a middle

00:26:28.610 --> 00:26:33.039
class family looked like I just thought I
was, I just thought I had it all.

00:26:33.039 --> 00:26:37.970
I was real happy with just nothing.

00:26:37.970 --> 00:26:45.029
Let me see, when I was in third grade my mother
had, she didn't want me out on the streets

00:26:45.029 --> 00:26:49.780
so she had signed me up for the Boys and Girls
Club but out of rebellion I would just, like,

00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:56.409
leave, I would just skip Boys and Girls Club.

00:26:56.409 --> 00:27:04.370
I did that all the way to middle school and
I'm a real shy person but ironically I was

00:27:04.370 --> 00:27:11.289
with an outgoing crowd that was really up
to no good.

00:27:11.289 --> 00:27:21.139
I've been like firsthand witness to drug abuse
and just a lot of violence, gang violence,

00:27:21.139 --> 00:27:29.409
gang affiliation, shootings; break ins, just
like it's a real twisted life.

00:27:29.409 --> 00:27:36.169
Like your own sister's, like, a sex slave
and it's just crazy.

00:27:36.169 --> 00:27:43.789
Like, you're not, you're not, I don't know,
you're just not a kid.

00:27:43.789 --> 00:27:47.970
Like everyone would look at you and be like,
"Oh, there's this kid" like things happen

00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:49.980
in your mind.

00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:55.880
Like, it just changes your perspective of
life so I didn't really feel like I had a

00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:58.940
path to go anywhere.

00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:06.120
So one day, since I wouldn't, I was shy so
I wouldn't speak a lot I would just start

00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:07.120
writing.

00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:14.320
I wrote lyrics because I didn't know how to,
I didn't know how to ask for help, I didn't

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:19.149
know, I didn't know if I should say anything
so I just wrote lyrics and that was my outlet,

00:28:19.149 --> 00:28:21.820
I felt better.

00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:26.389
Pretty soon, like, in a matter of minutes
it became an obsession, it was like my drug,

00:28:26.389 --> 00:28:27.730
I needed to write lyrics.

00:28:27.730 --> 00:28:34.059
I used to fill notebooks up, front and back
just one page a night or something, maybe

00:28:34.059 --> 00:28:36.919
two.

00:28:36.919 --> 00:28:42.529
And then my, I went back, my mother had signed
up my siblings for the Boys and Girls Club,

00:28:42.529 --> 00:28:47.269
so I went back, one day I went to go pick
up my sister and I had seen they had a music

00:28:47.269 --> 00:28:50.860
studio and I was like, "Oh man.

00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:52.909
I need to look at that."

00:28:52.909 --> 00:28:57.230
So I signed up, I went back to the Boys and
Girls Club as a member.

00:28:57.230 --> 00:29:02.529
I got into the music.

00:29:02.529 --> 00:29:11.639
My grades were really low and they were like,
"You need to have at least a 2.5 to be able

00:29:11.639 --> 00:29:16.369
to use the music equipment" and, you know,
my grades just shot up.

00:29:16.369 --> 00:29:24.230
Like, I was, like all throughout my academic
years my teachers would say, "You know, your

00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:26.029
son might have to repeat my grade."

00:29:26.029 --> 00:29:30.210
Like every year the teacher would tell my
mom that your son might have to repeat my

00:29:30.210 --> 00:29:32.690
class and my mom was just so worried.

00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:38.419
So that was cool how they were like, "Yeah,
you gotta do well" and they had tutors, they

00:29:38.419 --> 00:29:41.710
had, they had everything you need.

00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:44.059
So they really helped me.

00:29:44.059 --> 00:29:53.240
I went from that shy kid with that street
life to; I traded all that in for the knowledge

00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:57.970
of music and to pave a better road to positivity.

00:29:57.970 --> 00:30:07.289
So now I'm attending Cogswell Polytechnical
College in Sunnyvale, double majoring in audio

00:30:07.289 --> 00:30:18.019
engineering and entrepreneurship and I just
wanna say that even, not even your friends

00:30:18.019 --> 00:30:27.590
can try to persuade, what do I wanna say,
not even people around you could be a negative

00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:32.450
influence, you know, you have to take it upon
yourself to choose the right path.

00:30:32.450 --> 00:30:35.289
Thank you.

00:30:35.289 --> 00:30:36.720
[Applause]

00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:43.450
&gt;&gt;Peter Fortenbaugh: I'd like to share with
you one other video.

00:30:43.450 --> 00:30:50.639
It's called Vision 20/20 and this video came
about when President Obama declared and initiative

00:30:50.639 --> 00:30:54.919
for America to have the most college graduates
per capita of any country since we've fallen

00:30:54.919 --> 00:30:56.409
so far behind.

00:30:56.409 --> 00:31:00.059
And then Adobe, one of our major partners,
reached out to us and asked us if we would

00:31:00.059 --> 00:31:04.149
create a video to capture the importance of
education.

00:31:04.149 --> 00:31:09.789
And originally we were gonna show this video,
create this video just for the Bay Area Tour,

00:31:09.789 --> 00:31:14.889
just for the Bay Area visit but then they
saw this video and it was so successful, they

00:31:14.889 --> 00:31:16.629
liked it so much, they used it across country.

00:31:16.629 --> 00:31:21.049
And then it was so great and performed by
these gentlemen here that they actually got

00:31:21.049 --> 00:31:27.549
to fly out to Washington D.C. to perform it
at Howard University with Arne Duncan at a

00:31:27.549 --> 00:31:28.549
conference.

00:31:28.549 --> 00:31:31.850
So just to give you a flavor, Arne Duncan
is the Secretary of Education.

00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:37.179
So, you know, Lalo mentioned earlier how the
Boys and Girls Club has a perception of just

00:31:37.179 --> 00:31:41.190
being a place for kids to hang out and certainly
kids do hang out there and there's an element

00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:44.940
of daycare with the Boys and Girls Club but
it's so much more than that.

00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:49.520
And we really have evolved dramatically over
the last five years becoming much more of

00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:54.200
a learning center and much more of an extended
learning day program in partnership with schools

00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:55.200
and families.

00:31:55.200 --> 00:32:00.200
And we now run programs, not only in our three
clubhouses, but at six school sites on campus.

00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:06.489
We partner very closely with principals, superintendents,
teachers and really make sure that our curriculum

00:32:06.489 --> 00:32:11.090
is an extension of the school day and so that
the teacher looks at it as really having a

00:32:11.090 --> 00:32:16.450
school that goes from 8 in the morning until
6 at night as opposed to an add on school.

00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:21.570
And I think that this video will address that
and give you a flavor of the role of education.

00:32:21.570 --> 00:32:24.659
So, this is Vision 20/20.

00:32:24.659 --> 00:32:28.669
[Music plays]

00:32:28.669 --> 00:32:44.700
&gt;&gt;Lyrics: 20/20 vision, wear my cap and gown.

00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:53.509
We can see our futures taking off the ground.

00:32:53.509 --> 00:33:01.360
20/20 vision never been so clear, on the road
to success great futures start here.

00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:06.669
Just imagine if our education system was better.

00:33:06.669 --> 00:33:15.350
Do you think everybody would treat school
like whatever?

00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:16.350
Nah.

00:33:16.350 --> 00:33:29.850
Surprise, surprise the more knowledge, more
better, see we are the naked birds and education

00:33:29.850 --> 00:33:32.749
is the feathers.

00:33:32.749 --> 00:33:41.059
Yeah, what if every education in the world
was the same and private schools didn't cost

00:33:41.059 --> 00:33:43.320
money so we wouldn't pay.

00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:47.850
See, every mother and father wants their children
to learn.

00:33:47.850 --> 00:33:53.809
Without a fair chance money gets hard to earn.

00:33:53.809 --> 00:34:06.369
What if all teachers cared and didn't compare
the color, the race or the clothes that we

00:34:06.369 --> 00:34:07.619
wear?

00:34:07.619 --> 00:34:23.460
And wouldn't be scared of all of them problems
that we shared.

00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:38.940
Many open wounds throughout our whole life
we bared, listen.

00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:48.399
I got a plan, no more weapons of mass destruction;
still we help education succeed and watch

00:34:48.399 --> 00:34:49.770
this plan function.

00:34:49.770 --> 00:34:59.190
[Cannot understand] lights shinin' from down
below this is our idea, it's up to ya'll to

00:34:59.190 --> 00:35:01.630
make it grow.

00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:10.550
What if our fathers never left us when times
got hard?

00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:15.869
What if our mothers always told us we could
shoot for the stars?

00:35:15.869 --> 00:35:20.300
What if our brothers fight for literacy instead
of the hood?

00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:31.930
What if our sisters understood being smart
looks good?

00:35:31.930 --> 00:35:44.859
What if you lead by example and pave the way?

00:35:44.859 --> 00:37:04.359
A clear path for my siblings, I hope they
stay, I hope they open their eyes to a brighter

00:37:04.359 --> 00:37:10.400
day and greater future to come is impossible
to fail with faith.

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:11.400
Cause knowledge is power and power is love
and love is a family only sent from above.

00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:12.400
You can't rely on the system alone; we need
a family support to make education a part

00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:13.400
of our home.

00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:14.400
Part of our home.

00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:15.400
&gt;&gt;male #1: I need advice from my parents.

00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:16.400
&gt;&gt;female #1: I need my independence.

00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:17.400
&gt;&gt;female #2: As parents we need give a lot
of love and encouragement to our children

00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:18.400
in order for them to be successful in school.

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:19.400
&gt;&gt;female #3: Family needs to be more involved
academically with their children.

00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:20.400
&gt;&gt;male #2: Remember the most important job
is the one at home.

00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:21.400
&gt;&gt;female #4: I need encouragement and support
from my mom.

00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:22.400
&gt;&gt;female #5: I think the best way to support
our kids is to communicate with them and just

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:23.400
check and verify their work and make sure
they stay on track.

00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:24.400
&gt;&gt;Lyrics: Sex Ed can't be given but definitely
taken.

00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:25.400
We makin' staircases so you step up and take
it.

00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:26.400
Knowledge be my transportation, motivation
got us racin'.

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:27.400
Communities, a pile of leaves and congregation
must be rakin'.

00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:28.400
Think about dropouts and seats that remain
vacant.

00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:29.400
It's just precious education wasted.

00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:30.400
What's goin' on with the subject?

00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:31.400
What's next I ask myself what if?

00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:32.400
What if?

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:33.400
What if?

00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:34.400
What if?

00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:35.400
What if we excel in persistence and decisions
cause it takes a village just for one to be

00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:36.400
risen.

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:37.400
I can pinpoint what everybody else's eyes
are missin'.

00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:38.400
I can see a bright future comin', 20/20 vision.

00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:39.400
20/20 vision, wear my cap and gown.

00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:40.400
We can see our futures takin' off the ground.

00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:41.400
20/20 vision's never been so clear.

00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:42.400
We're on the road to success, great futures
start here.

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:43.400
20/20 vision, wear my cap and gown.

00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:44.400
We can see our future takin' off the ground.

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:45.400
Takin' off the ground.

00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:46.400
We can see our future takin' off the ground.

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:47.400
[Music plays]

00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:48.400
&gt;&gt;Peter Fortenbaugh: So the only way that
we can possibly top that is with a live performance

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:49.400
today from our three stars.

00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:50.400
So I'd ask Diamante and Lalo to join us back
again and PJ's gonna join them up here as

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:51.400
well with a little guitar and they're gonna
perform a song that they've written just for,

00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:52.400
just for this afternoon.

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:53.400
So this is a premier of their new song.

00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:54.400
[Guitar playing]

00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:55.400
&gt;&gt;Lyrics: Close your eyes.

00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:56.400
Try to imagine what it's like to be tossed
into this world alone and broken inside.

00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:57.400
To have life beat you senseless and still
expect you to thrive.

00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:58.400
Now picture tryin' to take flight with clipped
wings as your dreams whisper in your ear beggin'

00:37:58.400 --> 00:37:59.400
you to fly.

00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:03.030
You take a breath, you clear your mind and
with all odds against you somehow you manage

00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:04.030
to rise.

00:38:04.030 --> 00:38:05.160
I know it's crazy, right?

00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:08.980
You might be wonderin' if I'm the one that
this message applies to.

00:38:08.980 --> 00:38:11.460
Well you're right but this isn't just a story.

00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:15.240
This is my life, let's take a walk down memory
lane, just see what I see.

00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:18.220
I grew up with no money; I'm humble with a
lot of pride.

00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:20.829
Came up from nothing, from the bottom I climbed.

00:38:20.829 --> 00:38:23.750
I didn't know until the world it opened my
eyes.

00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:30.549
At 15 I lost someone for the very first time.

00:38:30.549 --> 00:38:39.119
[Guitar playing]
&gt;&gt;Lyrics: And let's not mention I was exposed

00:38:39.119 --> 00:38:40.210
to drugs in junior high.

00:38:40.210 --> 00:38:43.730
Exposed to all the violence surrounding our
community with positive unity was something

00:38:43.730 --> 00:38:45.130
that you couldn't find.

00:38:45.130 --> 00:38:50.740
Where safety was an issue and violence was
a pride, yo, I felt my momma's pain every

00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:55.869
time I saw her cry and I felt my father's
stress from workin' late night overtime.

00:38:55.869 --> 00:39:01.700
So I take these liabilities and turn them
into allies to make a change.

00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:04.580
But I see one digit when I'm in the bank.

00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:10.880
I see one digit when I'm in the bank.

00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:13.930
Yeah, but I see one digit when I'm in the
bank.

00:39:13.930 --> 00:39:21.540
Mixed emotions make it hard to think, make
it hard to think.

00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:22.540
Yeah.

00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:24.760
Lord forbid I fall from the agony that it
brings.

00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:27.050
Blind to accessories and ice and the gadgets.

00:39:27.050 --> 00:39:32.420
Now without it I ball like Dwight from the
Magics, overkill, that means I barely see

00:39:32.420 --> 00:39:35.869
the mattress comin' from the wrong road to
see right where the path is.

00:39:35.869 --> 00:39:40.700
Allen Poe wrote some crow thinkin' like psychopathic,
empty stomach tryin to stick a flashlight

00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:41.700
through the cabinets.

00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:43.650
Silence [cannot understand] so I'm fightin'
all these classes.

00:39:43.650 --> 00:39:47.260
I be up and down the wings takin' flight throughout
the campus.

00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:51.799
Tryin' to picture life's moments with a light
between cameras, shadows around me only emphasize

00:39:51.799 --> 00:39:52.869
what has happened.

00:39:52.869 --> 00:39:56.950
[Guitar playing]
&gt;&gt;Lyrics: Tryin' to be where I traveled then

00:39:56.950 --> 00:39:58.990
you might need an atlas.

00:39:58.990 --> 00:40:00.800
But I could prob'ly take you there.

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:05.220
The past is the past just to make it here.

00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:06.930
Make it clear.

00:40:06.930 --> 00:40:10.049
You know what I've been through just to make
it here.

00:40:10.049 --> 00:40:13.920
You know how much I make in a year?

00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:15.510
You prolly don't wanna take it there.

00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:19.700
I'm talkin' EBT's and empty kitchens there's
only one way you can get it.

00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:20.780
One lick away from riches, yeah.

00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:26.559
Who are you when you get your plate from someone
else because behind that mask you know you

00:40:26.559 --> 00:40:28.260
someone else?

00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:31.320
I'm free fallin' with nothin' to catch the
fall and even when you have nothin' they expect

00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:35.660
you give your all and the way I float these
folks think we in the same boat but nope.

00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:37.900
See, it's more like an abandoned ship.

00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:44.430
It's a different ball game with no ref around
but somehow I managed to make it to the championship.

00:40:44.430 --> 00:40:47.770
Thank you.

00:40:47.770 --> 00:40:54.460
[Guitar playing]
Thank you.

00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:56.130
[Applause]

00:40:56.130 --> 00:41:01.150
&gt;&gt;Peter Fortenbaugh: Alright.

00:41:01.150 --> 00:41:02.200
Thank you so much.

00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:06.069
That was a first time premier you just heard
right there.

00:41:06.069 --> 00:41:09.580
So the last thing we just wanna mention today
is how you can get involved.

00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:15.570
How, what kind of support we could use to
help these amazing young people and others

00:41:15.570 --> 00:41:18.630
like them graduate from high school ready
for college and career.

00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:21.040
There are four ways that you can get involved.

00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:24.760
First, advocate, people don't know about the
Boys and Girls Clubs.

00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:28.770
If they've heard about it they think we're
a place that kids hang out, a swim in gym,

00:41:28.770 --> 00:41:34.590
nice daycare, come by and visit, bring some
friends, bring some peers, check it out.

00:41:34.590 --> 00:41:38.500
You'll see things that'll amaze you I'm confident
and you'll meet some amazing, amazing young

00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:39.500
people.

00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:40.500
Spread the word.

00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:44.420
Number two, we gotta pay the bills, we always
love financial support.

00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:46.160
You kinda get that one.

00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:50.200
Number three is help with exposure.

00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:54.220
We really need to help with exposure and provide
opportunities for these kids.

00:41:54.220 --> 00:42:01.289
You know, so many kids today in Silicon Valley
get their resume built by doing free summer

00:42:01.289 --> 00:42:02.490
jobs, free internships, right?

00:42:02.490 --> 00:42:04.079
They get their foot in the door.

00:42:04.079 --> 00:42:08.220
Maybe their Dad or Uncle works at Google and
gets them a job at YouTube or something like

00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:09.220
that.

00:42:09.220 --> 00:42:10.619
That's kind of how it works a lot of times
these days.

00:42:10.619 --> 00:42:12.980
Well, not everyone has those opportunities.

00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:17.849
You have an internship this summer, I can
think of four fantastic candidates, really

00:42:17.849 --> 00:42:20.309
close that'd be willing to interview.

00:42:20.309 --> 00:42:23.550
So could you host a fieldtrip?

00:42:23.550 --> 00:42:28.710
You know a lot of these folks in our clubs
that grow up not knowing what some basic jobs

00:42:28.710 --> 00:42:29.710
are.

00:42:29.710 --> 00:42:33.280
You know, all of our members know what rap
stars are or basketball stars are but do they

00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:34.530
know what a Google engineer does?

00:42:34.530 --> 00:42:35.730
Or a Google tech guy?

00:42:35.730 --> 00:42:38.020
How about a Google person in office services?

00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:39.290
How about a Google chef?

00:42:39.290 --> 00:42:43.880
You know, right here at Google you have pretty
much every occupation that's ever been created,

00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:48.430
a masseuse, dry cleaning, I don't know, I
can't imagine, car mechanics.

00:42:48.430 --> 00:42:51.130
You know, bring some of our members over here
for a field trip.

00:42:51.130 --> 00:42:52.270
Help expose them.

00:42:52.270 --> 00:42:55.050
And then lastly, fourthly, volunteer.

00:42:55.050 --> 00:43:00.599
If you have any time, any opportunity or any
friends that are interested, come spend time

00:43:00.599 --> 00:43:01.599
at the clubs.

00:43:01.599 --> 00:43:06.869
You heard the story from Nancy early on about
how she was influenced by some positive voices,

00:43:06.869 --> 00:43:10.609
some positive, she found some positive influences
in her life.

00:43:10.609 --> 00:43:12.369
All of our members need that.

00:43:12.369 --> 00:43:18.569
We have 1,900 members who come at least 50
times a year, we need 1,900 mentors.

00:43:18.569 --> 00:43:21.530
So come by, check us out, we're open till
8 o'clock at night.

00:43:21.530 --> 00:43:26.619
So you can work half a Google day, leave at
6, we're literally four miles away, right?

00:43:26.619 --> 00:43:31.839
You can stay off the 101 just take East Bay
Shore, go right up and you'll be there and

00:43:31.839 --> 00:43:35.579
you can volunteer from 6:30 to 8 and then
you can come back and start the second half

00:43:35.579 --> 00:43:37.160
of your day.

00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:39.470
Or bring them here for dinner, whatever, there's
lots of great opportunities.

00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:40.780
So that's the Boys and Girls Clubs.

00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:44.510
I wanna thank you so much for having us here,
David and his team and Patty.

00:43:44.510 --> 00:43:49.809
If anyone has any questions for either me
or more interestingly any of our kids we'd

00:43:49.809 --> 00:43:51.599
be happy to take them.

00:43:51.599 --> 00:43:54.040
Otherwise just thank you so much for having
us here today.

00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:54.160
[Applause]
