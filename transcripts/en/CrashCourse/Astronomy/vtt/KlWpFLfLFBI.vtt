00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:07.240
Y’know, if Shakespeare had been an astronomer,
he’d have said that “there is a tide in

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.380
the affairs of the Universe, and on such a
full sea are we now afloat.”

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:15.210
He would’ve been right. You might just think
of tides as the ocean going in and out every

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.350
day, but in fact what astronomers call tides
are a subtle but inexorable force that have

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:22.990
literally shaped most objects in the Universe.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.810
And to understand tides, we start with gravity.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.300
Gravity is a force, and it weakens with distance.
An important thing to note is that we measure

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.300
gravity from the center of mass of an object,
not its surface. One way to think of the center

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.250
of mass of an object is the average position
in an object of all its mass. For an evenly

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.520
distributed sphere, that’s it’s center.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.239
Right now, unless you’re an astronaut, you’re
about 6400 kilometers from the center of the

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.879
Earth. If you stand up, your head is a couple
of meters farther away from the Earth’s

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:04.439
center than your feet. Since gravity weakens
with distance, the force of Earth’s gravity

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.699
on your head is an eensy weensy bit less than
it is on your feet. How much less? A mere

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.820
0.00005%. And that’s way too small for you
to ever notice.

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.660
But what if you were taller? Well, the taller
you are, the farther your head is from the

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:25.380
Earth’s center, and the weaker force it
will feel. If you were, say, about 300 kilometers

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.580
tall, the force of gravity would drop by about
10% at your head. That probably would be enough

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.130
to notice, if you weren’t dying from asphyxiation
and, y’know, being 300 kilometers tall.

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.070
This change in the force of gravity over distance
is what astronomers call the tidal force.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.180
When you have a massive object affecting another
object with its gravity, its tidal force depends

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.220
on several factors. For one thing, it depends
on how strong the gravity is from the first

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.180
object; the stronger the force of gravity, the stronger
stronger the tidal force will be on the affected object.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.620
It also depends on how wide the affected object
is. The wider it is, the more the force of

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.740
gravity from the first object changes across
it, and the bigger the tidal force.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.009
Finally, it depends on how far the affected
object is from the first object. The farther

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:12.180
away the affected object is, the lower the
tidal force will be. Tides depend on gravity,

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.470
and if gravity is weaker, so is the tidal
force.

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.010
The overall effect of the tidal force is to
stretch an object. You’re applying a stronger

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.090
force on one end than you are on the other,
so you’re pulling harder on one end. That’ll

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.790
stretch it! And this is where tidal forces
become very important.

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.950
Look at the Moon. It has gravity, but much
less than the Earth because it’s less massive.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.959
It’s 380,000 kilometers away, so the gravitational
force it has on you is pretty small. And you’re

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.599
pretty small compared to that distance, just
a couple of meters long from head to feet.

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:46.830
But the Earth is big! It’s nearly 13,000
kilometers across. That means the side of

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.140
the Earth facing the Moon is about 13,000
kilometers closer to the Moon than the other

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.200
side of the Earth. This is a pretty big distance,
enough for tides to become important. The

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.800
side of the Earth facing the Moon is pulled
harder by the Moon than the other side of

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.860
the Earth, so the Earth stretches. It becomes
ever so slightly football-shaped, like a sphere

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.390
with two bulges, one pointing toward the Moon,
and one pointing away.

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.040
This is probably the weirdest thing about
tidal forces. You might expect only one bulge,

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.980
on the side of the Earth facing the Moon.
But remember, we measure gravity from the

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.920
centers of objects. The side of the Earth
facing the Moon feels a stronger pull toward

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.900
the Moon than the Earth’s center, so it’s
pulled away from the center.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.240
But the side facing away from the Moon feels
a weaker force toward the Moon than the Earth’s

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.780
center. This means the center of the Earth
is being pulled away from the far side. This

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.940
is exactly the same as if the far side is
being pulled away from the center, and that’s

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.760
why you get two bulges on opposite sides of
the Earth.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.909
The tidal force is therefore strongest on
the sides of the Earth facing toward and away

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:46.650
from the Moon, and weakest halfway in between
them on each side.

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.970
A lot of the Earth is covered in water, and
water responds to this changing force, this

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.900
stretching. The water bulges up where the
tidal force is strongest, on opposite sides

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:58.330
of the Earth. If there’s a beach on one
of those spots, the water will cover it, and

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.390
we say it’s high tide. If a beach is where
the tidal force is low, the water’s been

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.330
pulled away from it, and it’s low tide.

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.500
But wait a second: The Earth is spinning!
If you’re on the part of the Earth facing

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.330
the Moon, you’re at high tide. Six hours
later, a quarter of a day, the Earth’s rotation

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.039
has swept you around to the spot where it’s
low tide. Six hours after that you’re at

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:20.190
high tide again, and then another six hours
later you’re at low tide for the second

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.490
time that day. Finally, a day after you started,
you’re back at high tide once more.

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:29.350
And that’s why we have two high tides and
two low tides every day. Very generally speaking,

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:34.169
the ocean tide causes the sea level to rise
and fall by a meter or two, every day.

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:37.729
Incidentally, the solid Earth can bulge as
well. It’s not as fluid as water, but it

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:42.750
can move. The tidal force stretches the solid
Earth by about 30 centimeters. If you just

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:47.320
sit in your house all day, you move up and
down by about that much...twice!

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.020
Like the saying goes, a rising tide lifts
all… surfaces.

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.360
The Earth’s spin has another effect. Lag
in the water flow means the water can’t

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.240
respond instantly to the tidal force from
the Moon. The Earth’s spin actually sweeps

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.720
the bulges forward a bit along the Earth.
So picture this: the bulge nearest the Moon

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.539
is actually a bit ahead of the Earth-Moon
line.

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:12.120
That bulge has mass; not a lot, but some.
Since it has mass, it has gravity, and that

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.680
pulls on the Moon. It pulls the Moon forward
in its orbit a bit, like pulling on a dog’s

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.710
leash, accelerating it. The Moon responds
to this tug by going into a higher orbit:

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:25.539
The Moon is actually moving away from the
Earth! The rate of recession of the moon has

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:29.789
been measured and it’s something like a
few centimeters per year, roughly the same

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:31.660
speed your fingernails grow.

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:37.000
Now get this: the Moon has gravity. Just as
the bulge is pulling the Moon ahead, the Moon

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.050
is pulling the bulge back, slowing it down.
Because of friction with the rest of the Earth,

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:46.870
this slowing of the bulge is actually slowing
the rotation of the Earth itself, making the

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.789
day longer. The effect is small, but again
it’s measurable.

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:54.780
OK, let’s get a little change of perspective.
Everything I’ve said about the Moon’s

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:58.639
tidal effect on the Earth works the other
way, too. The Moon feels tides from the Earth,

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:02.229
and they’re pretty strong because the Earth
is more massive and has more gravity than

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:07.380
the Moon. Just like Earth, there are two tidal bulges on
the Moon; one facing the Earth and one facing away.

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:12.280
Long ago, the Moon was closer to the Earth,
and spinning rapidly. The Moon’s tidal bulges

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:16.169
didn’t align with the Earth, and the Earth’s
gravity tugged on them, slowing the Moon’s

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:20.580
spin and moving it farther away. As it moved
farther away, the time it took to orbit once

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:25.789
around the Earth increased: Its orbital period
got longer. Eventually, the lengthening rotation

00:06:25.789 --> 00:06:29.940
of the Moon matched how long it took to go
around the Earth. When that happened, the

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:32.639
axis of the bulges pointed right at the Earth.

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:37.699
That’s why the Moon only shows one face
to us! It spins once per month, and goes around

00:06:37.699 --> 00:06:41.419
us once per month. If it didn’t spin at
all, over that month we’d see the entire

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:46.520
lunar surface. But since it does spin once
per orbit, we only ever see one face.

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:50.620
This is called tidal locking, and it’s worked
on nearly every big moon in the solar system;

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:54.919
tides from their home planet have matched
their spin and orbital period. These moons

00:06:54.919 --> 00:06:57.479
all show the same face toward their planet!

00:06:57.479 --> 00:07:02.090
Now wait a second. If the Moon has gravity,
which causes tides, and is the root cause

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:06.230
behind all these shenanigans, what about the
Sun? It’s even bigger than the Moon!

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:10.660
Tides depends on the gravity from an object,
and your distance from it. The Sun is far

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:14.949
more massive than the Moon, but much farther
away. These two effects largely cancel each

00:07:14.949 --> 00:07:19.610
other out, and when you do the math, you find
the Sun’s tidal force on the Earth is just

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:23.960
about half that of the Moon’s. The way the
Sun’s tidal force and the Moon’s tidal

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:28.789
force interact on Earth depends on their geometry,
which changes as the Moon orbits us.

00:07:28.789 --> 00:07:33.530
At new Moon, the Earth, Moon, and Sun are
in a line. The Moon’s tidal force aligns

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:38.580
with the Sun’s, reinforcing it. This means
we get an extra high high tide and an extra

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:41.940
low low tide on Earth. We call this the spring
tide.

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:46.479
When the Moon is at first quarter, the tidal
bulge from the Moon is 90° around from the

00:07:46.479 --> 00:07:51.500
Sun’s; high tide from the Moon overlaps
low tide from the Sun. We get a slightly lower

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:55.830
high tide, and a slightly higher low tide.
We call those neap tides.

00:07:55.830 --> 00:08:00.410
The pattern repeats when the Moon is full;
the Moon, Earth, and Sun fall along a line

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:05.420
again, and we get spring tides. A week later the Moon
has moved around, and we get neap tides again.

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:10.060
Not only that, the Moon orbits the Earth on
an ellipse. When it’s closest to us we feel

00:08:10.069 --> 00:08:15.660
a stronger effect. If that also happens at
New or Full Moon, we get an added kick to

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:20.540
the spring tides. This is called the proxigean tide,
and can lead to flooding in low-lying areas.

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:24.780
Unless you live on the coast, I bet you had
no idea tides were so complex!

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:29.860
Tides are universal; they work wherever there’s
gravity. If two stars orbit each other, each

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:33.830
raises a tide in the other. Just like the
Earth and Moon, that can slow their spin and

00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:38.930
increase their separation. Many planets orbiting
other stars may be tidally locked to those

00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:43.740
stars. Near a black hole, where the gravity
is incredibly intense, the tides are so strong

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:48.880
they would pull you like taffy into a long,
thin string. Astronomers call this effect…

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:52.120
spaghettification. No, seriously, that’s
what we call it!

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:55.740
Today you learned that tides are due to the
changing force of gravity over distance. The

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:59.920
strength of the tidal force from an object
depends on the gravity of the object, and

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:04.700
the size of and distance to the second object.
Tides raise two bulges in an object, creating

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:10.010
two high tides and two low tides per day on
Earth. Tides have slowed the Earth’s rotation,

00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:14.010
moved the Moon away from the Earth, and locked
the Moon’s rotation and orbit so that the

00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:16.150
Moon always has one side facing us.

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:21.860
So. Tide goes in. Tide goes out. It turns
out, I can explain that. Now you can too.
