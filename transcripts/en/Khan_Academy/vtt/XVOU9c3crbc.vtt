00:00:00.279 --> 00:00:02.412
- [Voiceover] You've
probably heard the term acid

00:00:02.412 --> 00:00:04.800
used in your everyday life.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:05.998
But what we want to do in this video

00:00:05.998 --> 00:00:08.091
is get a more formal
definition of an acid.

00:00:08.091 --> 00:00:09.452
And particular, we'll focus on the one

00:00:09.452 --> 00:00:11.240
that is most typically used.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.414
Although we'll see future
videos that there's

00:00:13.414 --> 00:00:16.543
other fairly common definitions
of acids used as well

00:00:16.543 --> 00:00:18.209
beyond the one that
we're going to see here.

00:00:18.209 --> 00:00:19.468
But the one that we're going to focus on

00:00:19.468 --> 00:00:22.883
is the Bronsted-Lowry definition.

00:00:22.883 --> 00:00:26.048
The Bronsted-Lowry definition
of acids and bases.

00:00:26.048 --> 00:00:27.531
And this is a picture of Bronsted.

00:00:27.531 --> 00:00:28.771
This is a picture of Lowry.

00:00:28.771 --> 00:00:31.554
And they came up with
this acid-base definition

00:00:31.554 --> 00:00:33.410
in the 1920s.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.786
So, we're going to do the Bronsted-Lowry,

00:00:35.786 --> 00:00:38.976
Bronsted-Lowry definition,

00:00:38.976 --> 00:00:41.150
definition of acids and bases.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.953
So, according to them, according to them,

00:00:43.953 --> 00:00:48.953
an acid, an acid is a proton,

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:50.069
proton,

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:51.633
or instead of writing proton
we could actually write

00:00:51.633 --> 00:00:54.620
hydrogen ion donor.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.640
So why is a proton and a
hydrogen ion the same thing?

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.014
Well, in the most common
isotope of hydrogen,

00:01:01.014 --> 00:01:03.005
we would, in it's nucleus, we would find

00:01:03.005 --> 00:01:05.829
just a proton and no neutron.

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:09.384
And if it's neutral, you
would have an electron

00:01:09.384 --> 00:01:12.452
buzzing around, jumping
around in its orbital.

00:01:12.452 --> 00:01:14.321
So, you would have it's
electron jumping around

00:01:14.321 --> 00:01:16.009
in its orbital.

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:17.470
But if you were to ionize it,

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.380
you're getting rid of its electron.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.615
So, if you're getting
rid of it's electron,

00:01:21.615 --> 00:01:23.159
so, if you're getting rid of this,

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.739
all you're going to be
left with is a proton.

00:01:25.739 --> 00:01:28.381
So that's why a proton, an H plus,

00:01:28.381 --> 00:01:31.266
is usually referring to the exact same,

00:01:31.266 --> 00:01:33.968
is referring to the exact same thing.

00:01:33.968 --> 00:01:35.085
So, that's what an acid is.

00:01:35.085 --> 00:01:36.533
So what would a base be?

00:01:36.533 --> 00:01:38.783
Well, you could imagine by this definition

00:01:38.783 --> 00:01:42.805
A base, a base would be a proton,

00:01:42.805 --> 00:01:45.322
would be a proton, or you could say

00:01:45.322 --> 00:01:49.772
a hydrogen ion acceptor, acceptor.

00:01:49.772 --> 00:01:51.458
So let's make this a
little bit more tangible

00:01:51.458 --> 00:01:52.901
with some examples.

00:01:52.901 --> 00:01:54.851
So one of the stronger acids we know

00:01:54.851 --> 00:01:57.004
is hydrochloric acid.

00:01:57.004 --> 00:01:59.402
Let me, let me draw.

00:01:59.402 --> 00:02:04.219
So, it's a hydrogen having
a, having a covalent bond.

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:08.179
Having a covalent bond with chlorine.

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.354
With chlorine, with
chlorine right over there.

00:02:12.354 --> 00:02:13.417
And if we want to,

00:02:13.417 --> 00:02:15.217
let's draw actually chlorine's lone pairs.

00:02:15.217 --> 00:02:18.733
So outside of the electron
that is contributing

00:02:18.733 --> 00:02:20.623
to this pair in the covalent bond.

00:02:20.623 --> 00:02:25.174
It also has, it also has
three other lone pairs.

00:02:25.174 --> 00:02:28.090
It also has three other
lone pairs, just like that.

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.731
So, if you were to take hydrochloric acid,

00:02:30.731 --> 00:02:33.942
place it in an aqueous solution,

00:02:33.942 --> 00:02:37.518
so it's in an aqueous
solution right over here.

00:02:37.518 --> 00:02:38.512
And actually an aqueous solution,

00:02:38.512 --> 00:02:40.341
you'll see this written like that.

00:02:40.341 --> 00:02:42.497
That just means it's
in a solution of water.

00:02:42.497 --> 00:02:44.811
So you could write like
this, you could write hey,

00:02:44.811 --> 00:02:47.596
hydrochloric acid in an aqueous solution

00:02:47.596 --> 00:02:50.256
if you want to make it a
little bit more explicit.

00:02:50.256 --> 00:02:51.454
You could say hey, look,
this is going to be

00:02:51.454 --> 00:02:55.497
around some water molecules
in its liquid form.

00:02:55.497 --> 00:02:58.768
Aqueous solution just means
it's dissolved in liquid water.

00:02:58.768 --> 00:03:02.569
So, some water molecules
in their liquid form.

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:04.985
So, this is a water molecule.

00:03:04.985 --> 00:03:07.404
Whoops, water molecule.

00:03:07.404 --> 00:03:10.999
Right over here.

00:03:10.999 --> 00:03:14.485
So, an oxygen bonded to two hydrogens.

00:03:14.485 --> 00:03:16.805
And sometimes you'll see
it written like this,

00:03:16.805 --> 00:03:20.297
that it's in its liquid,
it's in its liquid form.

00:03:20.297 --> 00:03:23.040
Well, what do you think
is going to happen?

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.436
Well, I already said that
this is a strong acid

00:03:25.436 --> 00:03:26.513
right over here.

00:03:26.513 --> 00:03:30.212
So this is going to really
want to donate protons.

00:03:30.212 --> 00:03:32.648
It's really going to want
to donate this hydrogen,

00:03:32.648 --> 00:03:34.863
but not let the hydrogen
keep its electrons.

00:03:34.863 --> 00:03:36.834
So what's likely to happen here?

00:03:36.834 --> 00:03:39.617
Well, the both of these
electrons in this pair

00:03:39.617 --> 00:03:42.888
are going to be grabbed by this chlorine.

00:03:42.888 --> 00:03:45.511
And then this hydrogen ion,

00:03:45.511 --> 00:03:47.378
because its electron was grabbed,

00:03:47.378 --> 00:03:51.462
well this could be nabbed by
some water molecule passing by.

00:03:51.462 --> 00:03:54.073
Remember, in a real solution,

00:03:54.073 --> 00:03:55.718
it's not like they know what to do.

00:03:55.718 --> 00:03:57.039
They're just all bumping past each other.

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:58.989
And based on how badly
they want to do things,

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:00.919
these reactions happen.

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:03.845
And so you can imagine this
lone pair right over here,

00:04:03.845 --> 00:04:07.461
well maybe it's able
to form a covalent bond

00:04:07.461 --> 00:04:08.437
with this hydrogen.

00:04:08.437 --> 00:04:10.428
And so what's going to happen?

00:04:10.428 --> 00:04:11.200
What's going to happen?

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.500
And I'll draw it with just an arrow

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.284
because this reaction favorably goes,

00:04:15.284 --> 00:04:17.193
very strongly goes to the right,

00:04:17.193 --> 00:04:19.835
because this is such a strong acid.

00:04:19.835 --> 00:04:21.643
Well, then you're going to be left with,

00:04:21.643 --> 00:04:24.345
you're gonna be left with,

00:04:24.345 --> 00:04:29.140
the chlorine is now going
to have its three lone pairs

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.846
that it had before.

00:04:30.846 --> 00:04:33.813
And then it also grabbed
these two electrons

00:04:33.813 --> 00:04:34.869
right over here.

00:04:34.869 --> 00:04:37.633
It also grabbed those two
electrons right over there,

00:04:37.633 --> 00:04:39.089
so it gained an extra electron.

00:04:39.089 --> 00:04:40.863
It now has a negative charge.

00:04:40.863 --> 00:04:43.506
It is now the chloride anion.

00:04:43.506 --> 00:04:45.274
So it has a negative charge.

00:04:45.274 --> 00:04:47.407
And what about this water molecule?

00:04:47.407 --> 00:04:49.012
Well this water molecule,

00:04:49.012 --> 00:04:50.759
you have your oxygen,

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:54.521
you have your hydrogens,
you have your hydrogens,

00:04:54.521 --> 00:04:56.284
but now you don't just have two hydrogens,

00:04:56.284 --> 00:04:58.072
you grabbed this hydrogen right over here.

00:04:58.072 --> 00:04:59.291
And maybe I'll do this hydrogen

00:04:59.291 --> 00:05:00.225
in a slightly different color

00:05:00.225 --> 00:05:03.171
so that you could keep track of it.

00:05:03.171 --> 00:05:05.813
You have this hydrogen right over there.

00:05:05.813 --> 00:05:09.988
And this lone pair, this
lone pair you can view it

00:05:09.988 --> 00:05:12.791
as now forming this covalent bond.

00:05:12.791 --> 00:05:14.376
You had your other two covalent bonds

00:05:14.376 --> 00:05:16.123
to the other two hydrogens.

00:05:16.123 --> 00:05:19.455
And then you still have this
lone pair right over here.

00:05:19.455 --> 00:05:22.950
You still have that lone pair
sitting right over there.

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:24.536
And what just happened?

00:05:24.536 --> 00:05:27.257
Well, this water molecule
just gained a proton.

00:05:27.257 --> 00:05:30.395
This hydrogen did not
come with an electron.

00:05:30.395 --> 00:05:32.711
So if you just gain a proton, you are now,

00:05:32.711 --> 00:05:33.950
if you were neutral before,

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:37.445
you are now going to
have a positive charge.

00:05:37.445 --> 00:05:38.826
So what just happened?

00:05:38.826 --> 00:05:43.013
You put hydrochloric
acid in a water solution,

00:05:43.013 --> 00:05:44.860
in an aqueous solution,

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:49.086
this thing has donated a
proton to a water molecule.

00:05:49.086 --> 00:05:52.012
And so, what is the acid
and what is the base here?

00:05:52.012 --> 00:05:54.551
Well, when we look at
the reaction this way,

00:05:54.551 --> 00:05:59.203
we see that this is the acid,

00:05:59.203 --> 00:06:00.523
the hydrochloric acid,

00:06:00.523 --> 00:06:02.575
it's literally called hydrochloric acid.

00:06:02.575 --> 00:06:06.131
And here, water is acting as a base.

00:06:06.131 --> 00:06:09.138
Water is acting as a base.

00:06:09.138 --> 00:06:09.767
And as you could see,

00:06:09.767 --> 00:06:12.673
water can actually act
as an acid or a base.

00:06:12.673 --> 00:06:15.335
So, water is acting as a base.

00:06:15.335 --> 00:06:16.737
Now you might be saying, okay,

00:06:16.737 --> 00:06:19.418
this reaction goes strongly to the right,

00:06:19.418 --> 00:06:21.003
hey, but like you know, I could imagine

00:06:21.003 --> 00:06:25.073
in certain circumstances
where chloride might accept

00:06:25.073 --> 00:06:27.393
a proton because it has
this negative charge.

00:06:27.393 --> 00:06:28.226
And you would be right.

00:06:28.226 --> 00:06:30.604
This reaction goes strongly to the right,

00:06:30.604 --> 00:06:33.429
but once an acid has donated its proton,

00:06:33.429 --> 00:06:35.073
the thing that is left over,

00:06:35.073 --> 00:06:37.654
this is called a conjugate base.

00:06:37.654 --> 00:06:38.730
And I'll do the same color.

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:42.489
So, this is the conjugate
base of hydrochloric acid.

00:06:42.489 --> 00:06:44.927
The chloride anion.

00:06:44.927 --> 00:06:49.927
Conjugate, conjugate base

00:06:50.026 --> 00:06:53.521
of hydrochloric acid.

00:06:53.521 --> 00:06:56.487
And this right over here
is the conjugate acid

00:06:56.487 --> 00:06:59.027
because you could imagine
this hydronium ion,

00:06:59.027 --> 00:07:01.303
this could, under the right circumstances,

00:07:01.303 --> 00:07:03.965
donate protons to other things.

00:07:03.965 --> 00:07:07.854
Donate a hydrogen without
donating electron to other things.

00:07:07.854 --> 00:07:12.710
And so this is actually
the conjugate acid of H2O.

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:17.710
Conjugate acid of water,

00:07:18.837 --> 00:07:20.319
of a water molecule.

00:07:20.319 --> 00:07:23.976
And as we'll see, water can
act as an acid or a base.

00:07:23.976 --> 00:07:27.044
But this this gives you a
kind of a baseline of at least

00:07:27.044 --> 00:07:31.290
the Bronsted-Lowry definition
of acids and bases.

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:32.957
And actually, one other
thing I want to add.

00:07:32.957 --> 00:07:36.107
In some books here, so
over here I said, hey,

00:07:36.107 --> 00:07:38.159
put this in an aqueous
solution you're gonna form

00:07:38.159 --> 00:07:41.430
some hydronium, sometimes
you'll see it written like this.

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:43.909
And I'll just write it a
little bit, a little bit,

00:07:43.909 --> 00:07:46.896
sometimes you'll see it like this.

00:07:46.896 --> 00:07:48.622
So you have your hydrochloric acid,

00:07:48.622 --> 00:07:50.877
and I won't draw the details this time,

00:07:50.877 --> 00:07:52.807
in an aqueous solution.

00:07:52.807 --> 00:07:54.819
So it's in a solution of water.

00:07:54.819 --> 00:07:57.095
And they'll just draw the
reaction going like this,

00:07:57.095 --> 00:07:58.943
where they say hey,
you're gonna be left with,

00:07:58.943 --> 00:08:02.986
you're gonna be left
with some hydrogen ions,

00:08:02.986 --> 00:08:04.368
these protons.

00:08:04.368 --> 00:08:08.148
And you're going to be left with,

00:08:08.148 --> 00:08:09.128
and actually we could say

00:08:09.128 --> 00:08:11.462
it's gonna be in a aqueous solution,

00:08:11.462 --> 00:08:12.640
aqueous solution.

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:16.222
And you're gonna be left
with some chloride anions.

00:08:16.222 --> 00:08:21.222
Some chloride anions and
it's in an aqueous solution.

00:08:21.458 --> 00:08:24.120
Now this isn't incorrect,
but it's important to realize

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:25.582
what they're talking
about when they're talking

00:08:25.582 --> 00:08:27.439
about these hydrogen ions right over here.

00:08:27.439 --> 00:08:29.552
We know that if you have the hydrogen ions

00:08:29.552 --> 00:08:30.568
in an aqueous solution they don't just

00:08:30.568 --> 00:08:32.091
hang out by themselves.

00:08:32.091 --> 00:08:33.819
They get grabbed by a water molecule

00:08:33.819 --> 00:08:35.403
and they form hydronium.

00:08:35.403 --> 00:08:40.056
So, it's much more, I guess,
it's much more close to

00:08:40.056 --> 00:08:41.602
the actual of what's happening,

00:08:41.602 --> 00:08:44.099
is if you actually talk
about hydronium forming.

00:08:44.099 --> 00:08:45.501
As opposed to just the protons.

00:08:45.501 --> 00:08:47.329
'Cause these protons
in an aqueous solution,

00:08:47.329 --> 00:08:49.097
in a water solution,
they're gonna be grabbed

00:08:49.097 --> 00:08:52.185
by a water molecule to form hydronium.

00:08:52.185 --> 00:08:55.300
And that's why I did it
the way, this way up here.
