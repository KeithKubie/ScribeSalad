00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.490
As you just saw on the quiz, there's three kinds of view we can take with regard to running time.

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:12.220
We can take a best-case view and assume that all the inputs that we're getting are the ones that

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:16.930
make our algorithms run the fastest or we can take the very opposite view

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:23.460
and say that the running time of our algorithm is going to be determined by the worst possible input

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.980
that it can receive or we can define running time as the average time that our algorithm will take

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.040
over a number of inputs.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.660
Which one of the three are we going to choose in this course?

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:42.090
Best-case running time as you've seen in the previous quiz is often rather trivial or meaningless.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:48.700
So for example, if we use best-case running time for our algorithm that counts the number of As,

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.370
it would only be valid for strings that contain no A at all so we're not going to take this.

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.870
For the average-case view, actually that could be a very interesting view and practice

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.810
because when we run the algorithm a couple of times we might not care about

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:07.860
how much that algorithm runs on a single run but over many inputs.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.000
But as you've just seen in the quiz, it's actually quite hard to define what an average input looks like.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.220
And also when we do the analysis of an algorithm

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.460
sometimes we might not even know what kinds of input the algorithm receives.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.540
Average-case analysis is very interesting sometimes.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.870
But here, it's actually not that suitable. Now, worst-case analysis.

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.640
Well we always assume that the algorithm receives an input that

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.450
makes it run as long as possible might seem a bit pessimistic to you.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.520
It's almost like we had a mean adversary who was trying to give us the worst possible inputs.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:51.000
But on the other hand, the advantage of worst-case analysis is that it offers guarantees.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.690
What I mean by that is when we take a worst-case view we know that our algorithm

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.640
will not run longer than the worst-case analysis suggests no matter what happens.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:06.860
And this is actually what we're interested in in this course so we are going to use worst-case analysis.

00:02:06.860 --> 99:59:59.000
Meaning, we're always going to state the time of our algorithm for the worst possible input.
