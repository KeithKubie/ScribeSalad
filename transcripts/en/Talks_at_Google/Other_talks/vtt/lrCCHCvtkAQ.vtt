00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:07.840
FEMALE SPEAKER: It really means
a lot to us for you to

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.330
come in here for this next 45
minutes and be with us.

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.590
So I just wanted to start out
with asking Sarah, how did you

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.650
first hear about this story?

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.080
SARAH BURNS: Well, I was too
young in 1989 to have known

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.330
about this case.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:28.660
And so I didn't learn about it
until 2003, when I was in

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.380
college, and I spent a summer
working for a civil rights

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.470
lawyer who was involved
in the civil suit

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.050
that's now ongoing still.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.080
In 2003, it had not been filed
yet, and today it is

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.500
almost 10 years old.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.250
But I learned about
the case then by

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.140
working with these lawyers.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.970
And I actually met Raymond
and Kevin that summer.

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.510
And I was just so outraged by
the story, and so interested,

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.360
and it sort of fit with
what I was studying.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.520
And so I ended up writing
my senior essay in

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:58.750
college about it.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.520
And then a couple years later
decided that I wanted to know

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.950
more about it, and really
tell the story.

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.440
And so I wrote the book.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.580
And pretty early on in that
process, then we decided--

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.590
documentary filmmaking is the
family business for me.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.380
And so it was so obvious that we
had to make this film, that

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.010
this was such an important
story, and one that people

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.280
really didn't know.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.310
People often think they know
something about it.

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.300
They've heard some of it.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.630
But the fact that the
convictions were vacated in

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.410
this case, most people we talked
to didn't know that.

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.090
And so we felt it was really
important just to, if nothing

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.080
else, set the record straight
about what happened here.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.870
But I think there are also
a lot of really important

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.460
lessons to be learned from
this story about false

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.770
confessions, about this sort of
rush to judgment that came

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.295
in the media, and really for
everyone that sort of bought

00:01:53.295 --> 00:01:56.690
this story that the police
provided and

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:57.370
really believed it.

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:01.770
And so I think that trying to
understand those forces are

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.450
really important, not just for
understanding this case but

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.699
for thinking about how this
happens and why it happens and

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:13.560
how we can prevent it from
happening again.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.070
FEMALE SPEAKER: Korey, what did
you think when Sarah came

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.530
to you and said that she wanted
to write the book?

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.370
KOREY WISE: Well, she had called
me, and when she had

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.350
called me, I was just so caught
up in my own little

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.670
world, I didn't remember our
conversation until she had

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.110
reminded me.

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.110
And I said, sure.

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.870
FEMALE SPEAKER: What
about you, Raymond?

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.220
What was your first reaction?

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.920
RAYMOND SANTANA: Well,
basically, because I had met

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.230
Sarah back in '03, and she had
done the paper, through

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:55.910
conversation and her knowledge
of all the facts in the case,

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.490
and then going into the book, we
had developed a friendship

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.790
by that time, and so the trust
was already there.

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.800
And we knew that the movie was
going to be told right,

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.810
because Sarah knew
all the facts.

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.030
She really did her research.

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.895
And we were really impressed
with this young lady that took

00:03:15.895 --> 00:03:18.610
an interest and stood out.

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.670
And she was willing to put her
life kind of on hold to help

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.120
us out, and we were very
grateful for that.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.350
FEMALE SPEAKER: And we're going
to see a clip in just a

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.660
few minutes that shows a little
bit more about what

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.310
happened where the film left off
when all of you boys were

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.180
picked up-- boys at the time,
14 to 16 years old.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.650
But Sarah, could you talk
a little bit more--

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.990
I mean, we set up the climate
in New York at the time, but

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:48.800
what was it like?

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.070
What explains that
this happened?

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:52.320
SARAH BURNS: Yeah.

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.500
What you've seen here is
basically just meeting the

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.950
characters in our story, these
five men and also the City of

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.060
New York, which is a really
important character.

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.940
And I think you see
here it's very

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:12.170
different than it is today.

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.760
I don't know how many of you
were living here in '89, but

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.529
it was a very different city.

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:20.529
And so I think part of
understanding the reaction to

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:24.290
the case is understanding what
was going on-- these sort of

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.780
incidents that had happened in
the decade leading up to it

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.370
that had sort of increased
racial tension and made people

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.030
very aware of this sort of
us-versus-them thing that was

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:39.170
happening in the city that this
case really fit into.

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:40.540
Basically, what happens--

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.050
I guess I'll kind of catch you
up just a little bit to the

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.750
clip that we're going
to see next.

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.180
This group of teenagers,
including our five, go into

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.560
the park this night
in April 1989.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:01.230
And some of them are arrested
leaving the park because some

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:03.890
people in this larger group
had harassed, and in some

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:07.820
cases, assaulted some joggers
and bicyclists in the park.

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.510
And not everyone in
the group and--

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:13.310
but there were a few crimes
that were committed there.

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:15.890
And so some of these
kids are picked up.

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:21.650
And then a few hours later, the
police discover a woman

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:25.210
who had been jogging in the park
who was found near death,

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.290
who had been brutally
raped and beaten.

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:29.520
And it's a miracle that
she survived.

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.250
It was really a horrific
crime.

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.020
And so they jumped to the
conclusion that these kids who

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.390
had been in the park were
responsible for this crime,

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:40.840
and they began interrogating
them with that assumption,

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:45.090
certain that they were talking
to the guilty parties and

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:49.070
using every tactic they had
in their arsenal to get

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:50.360
confessions.

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.860
FEMALE SPEAKER: And we'll see
that clip in a moment.

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.110
But just to reiterate, so you
guys didn't know each other,

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.902
necessarily--

00:05:54.902 --> 00:05:55.300
KOREY WISE: No.

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:55.880
FEMALE SPEAKER: --that night.

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:56.590
Did you, Raymond?

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:58.780
Had you kind of seen the
other four guys, or?

00:05:58.780 --> 00:05:59.420
RAYMOND SANTANA: No.

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:02.280
I didn't know any of
them on that night.

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.750
So that's why when you look back
at the statements and how

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:09.140
the whole case unraveled, it's
pretty easy to see how that

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.150
can happen, especially when
you don't know them.

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:14.680
In Korey's instance,
he knew Yusef.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.830
And so they were really
good friends.

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:20.546
And you'll see the clip-- well,
I don't know if you guys

00:06:20.546 --> 00:06:22.320
will see the clip in the movie,
but if you get to see

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:25.450
the movie, it tells you how
the police stopped Yusef.

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:28.420
And they have his name on a
list, but Korey's name isn't

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:29.940
on the list.

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:34.140
And because their friendship
was so strong, the police

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:36.390
said, well, just come with
him, and you'll be back.

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:38.910
And he wound up coming
back 13 years later.

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:40.290
So--

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:42.510
FEMALE SPEAKER: There's these
four different confessions

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:44.690
that are totally mismatching.

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:48.880
How does it end up that
they end up in prison?

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:49.350
SARAH BURNS: Right.

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:52.170
Ultimately, this is just a
portion of what happens in the

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:54.010
interrogations.

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:58.520
Later, they pick up Korey and
Yusef and interrogate them.

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.840
And ultimately, four of the
five that we're getting to

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:05.910
know give these videotaped
statements, which end up being

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:07.710
this really powerful
piece of evidence.

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:10.240
They're these sort of
rehearsed things.

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.400
They've already given written
statements, the police have

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:15.740
sort of fed all of the
information, and they give

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:18.070
these statements, and
that's what gets

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:19.580
presented to the jury.

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:21.630
And it's very convincing.

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:23.770
It's hard for people to
understand why someone would

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:24.680
falsely confess.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:28.010
And so it was really important
to us in the film to really

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:29.670
try to understand--

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:31.730
and these guys explained
it so well--

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:33.740
try to understand how
that could happen.

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:37.700
Because the jury looked at that
and believed it, even

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:42.020
though, as he has said, the
details were wrong.

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:45.680
Antron talks about describing
a different person than what

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:46.240
he was wearing.

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.980
That's not what the jogger
was wearing.

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:50.680
They get the location
of the attack--

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.720
everything is wrong.

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:55.360
And the amazing thing is that
people so wanted to believe

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.470
this story.

00:07:56.470 --> 00:07:57.960
The police wanted
to believe it.

00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:59.450
They wanted to have
the right guys.

00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:02.460
And they shared this with the
media as if it were fact, and

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:04.160
people just bought it.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.460
And so later on, they
start getting

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:08.040
forensic evidence back.

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:10.540
DNA tests are negative.

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:13.110
There's no blood anywhere
in this incredibly

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:13.970
bloody crime scene.

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:17.420
There's no blood anywhere
on any of these guys.

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:21.550
And they just plow ahead,
with really terrifying

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:22.930
consequences.

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:24.730
FEMALE SPEAKER: Raymond, during
the trial, you must

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:27.860
have been thinking, like,
there's no way that this is

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:28.780
going to happen, right?

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:30.820
RAYMOND SANTANA: Well,
basically, because we were

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:33.010
still young, it kind
of goes over your

00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:33.909
head, the whole scene.

00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:35.320
You're kind of numb to it.

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:39.490
And there was a part during
trial where the lawyers took

00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:43.250
us in the back and they said,
you know, we're looking to get

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:46.850
a plea deal because we're
going to lose this case.

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:51.560
And so they wanted to negotiate
a plea deal, but it

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:53.000
had to be all three
of us, which is

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.030
me, Yusef, and Antron.

00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:58.680
And we looked at each other,
and were like, no.

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:00.510
We're not taking a plea deal.

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:01.250
We didn't do it.

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:04.780
And I remember Yusef was--

00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:08.420
and at that point, I had
over a year and a half

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:09.770
incarcerated.

00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:11.860
And so I would have benefited
if I would have

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:12.710
taken a plea deal.

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:16.675
But I remember Yusef was really
gung-ho, and he stuck

00:09:16.675 --> 00:09:18.160
to his guns and he
was like, no.

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:21.710
They can give me my life
and a day, and I'm

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:22.170
just going to do it.

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:23.690
But I'm not going to cop
out to something

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:24.880
that we didn't do.

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:26.520
And we were like, yeah,
you're right.

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:27.773
And we stuck to it.

00:09:27.773 --> 00:09:28.560
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:31.580
And then you two, Korey and
Raymond, end up spending 7 to

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:34.310
13 years in prison.

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:36.844
KOREY WISE: Did the Rikers
Island thing--

00:09:36.844 --> 00:09:37.256
RAYMOND SANTANA: Yeah.

00:09:37.256 --> 00:09:37.670
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:40.220
KOREY WISE: --for about,
what, two years.

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:47.310
And it was mainly just
that, just going back

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:48.560
and forth to court.

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:55.320
Learning whatever I
could learn about

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:58.326
myself and the case.

00:09:58.326 --> 00:09:58.770
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:01.870
And you talk a lot in the film
about having to grow up, and

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:03.420
that's no way to grow up--

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:06.410
being boys in there
amongst other men.

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:08.400
KOREY WISE: No.

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:10.760
FEMALE SPEAKER: So if you, of
course-- and I want to make

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:12.360
sure we get a chance
to take questions--

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:15.500
but fast forward in the film,
and you heard the voice of

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:17.060
Matthias Reyes at the beginning

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:19.290
confessing to the crime.

00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:25.070
Korey, you actually ended up
having two encounters with him

00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:25.750
when you were in prison.

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:28.000
Could you tell us about that?

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.850
KOREY WISE: Oh, boy, boy, boy.

00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:32.170
My boy, destiny.

00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:33.630
That's what it was--

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:34.880
destiny.

00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:40.550
"Good Day New York" would
have a great one.

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:41.800
Destiny.

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:52.680
When I was on the streets as
a kid, I watched a program

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:56.690
called "Video Music Box" with
Ralph McDaniels, who would do

00:10:56.690 --> 00:11:00.200
hip hop and R&amp;B. So I
was very into that.

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:04.350
That's the only thing that's
good for the neighborhood.

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:08.360
So I brought it with me to
Rikers Island, unexpectedly,

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:12.606
but I brought it with me, just
the mind state of "Video Music

00:11:12.606 --> 00:11:16.230
Box."

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:18.460
I became a porter there.

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:20.650
I lived in a box in the Bronx.

00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:26.530
The box is called
23 Hour Lock In.

00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:32.900
So the officers, for my two
years I was there, when they

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:36.720
got to work, about 10 to 3:00,
they let me out of my cell.

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:38.790
So every time I came out of my
cell, I thanked them for doing

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:41.020
it, because they
didn't have to.

00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:45.850
So I came out, cleaned
up, and [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:49.190
And it was also called
CMC housing--

00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:51.510
Centrally Monitored Case.

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:55.780
And I had quite a few people
down there with me.

00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:57.870
So I came out.

00:11:57.870 --> 00:12:02.580
I went to the day room door,
opened it up, and they had

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:04.390
hollered at the bubble where
the officer was at, so they

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:06.020
could put the television on.

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:07.170
So they did that.

00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:11.000
So I had turned on the channel
of "Video Music Box." But it

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:11.720
didn't come on yet.

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:14.570
It was about a good five minutes
before it came on.

00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:20.620
So I did that, turned it up
a little bit, and get the

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:24.260
cleaning stuff ready to clean
up before dinner come in.

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:32.320
So as I'm doing my cleaning,
I'm hearing doors open up,

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.280
cells over my head open up.

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:38.210
So 3:00, they came in, and I'm
hearing "Video Music Box"

00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:40.440
going on in the day room.

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:45.040
So the two end gates for the
north and south opens out,

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:48.690
because some of my CMC
colleagues was on the other

00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:53.210
side on their way to my
side, to the day room.

00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:57.140
So I didn't hear the
music no more.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.150
I don't know whether I wasn't
paying attention to it or not,

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:05.310
but I didn't hear the music.

00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:11.020
So I stopped what I was doing,
and I went on to the day room.

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:17.760
And when I got to the day room
door, my destiny was standing

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:19.460
in front of television.

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:20.770
FEMALE SPEAKER: And that
was Matthias Reyes--

00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:21.440
KOREY WISE: Right.

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:22.340
FEMALE SPEAKER: Who
was another--

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:24.520
KOREY WISE: And I just told him,
I said, excuse me, can

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:27.140
you put it back on the channel
that was there?

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:29.710
He said, I'm not
watching that.

00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:30.940
So I said, I was.

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:33.040
But you're doing something.

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:34.100
Don't worry about
what I'm doing.

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:36.620
Please put it back
and just relax.

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:41.000
And long story short,
we went to blows.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:48.500
And so after we went
to blows, I guess--

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:52.170
but when I saw him about
a year or two ago--

00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:53.450
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah,
so then about, what?

00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:54.280
10 years later--

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:54.560
SARAH BURNS: 13, yeah.

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:55.400
FEMALE SPEAKER: --you end up--

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:56.010
13 years later--

00:13:56.010 --> 00:13:56.480
KOREY WISE: Yeah.

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:58.320
FEMALE SPEAKER: --you end
up seeing him again.

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:01.180
KOREY WISE: Well, I saw him,
and when I saw him, he was

00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:02.680
playing stick ball.

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:05.030
So he was in--

00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:10.510
and I guess, when he did
come see me, I guess

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:11.660
word got back to him.

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:12.690
I don't know.

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:16.930
But when he did see me, he
just said, hey, Wise.

00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:21.546
I was on the basketball court
just waiting for those doors

00:14:21.546 --> 00:14:23.000
to open up, because we
all just came out

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.100
of the program there.

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:27.300
It was about 5,000 of
us out in the yard.

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:30.780
And when he called me,
I looked at him.

00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:31.740
He said, yo, Wise.

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:33.110
I said, hey, what's up?

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:34.350
So, you're Wise?

00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:34.810
Yeah.

00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:37.440
You got mail for me?

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:38.870
He said, no.

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:41.140
I'd like to apologize to you.

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:43.866
He had his own intentions.

00:14:43.866 --> 00:14:46.510
But I said, apologize
to me for what?

00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:49.075
No, because we had a fight
over the television.

00:14:49.075 --> 00:14:52.860
Oh, don't worry about it.

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:54.300
We're here, don't
worry about it.

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:55.980
It's not going to do
nothing with me.

00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:57.120
Don't worry about it.

00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:59.690
No, you always maintain,
you know.

00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:04.430
But I didn't know he was going
to be the destiny to this.

00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:04.735
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:15:04.735 --> 00:15:07.040
So shortly after that, he
ends up confessing.

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:09.590
SARAH BURNS: Soon after he
apologized to Korey about that

00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:13.180
incident, he started asking
around and talking to people

00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:17.210
in the prison and ultimately
confessed that he had raped

00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:20.300
the Central Park Jogger and
that he had done it alone.

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:23.630
And that began an exhaustive
reinvestigation by the

00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:27.200
district attorney's office
into his story.

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:30.380
And they tested his DNA, and it
matched the single sample

00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:33.960
of DNA that had been present
at the crime scene from the

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:38.090
beginning that had, of course,
matched none of the five.

00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:39.525
And it matched Reyes.

00:15:39.525 --> 00:15:43.360
And they checked out his story,
and it fit the details

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:46.490
of the crime in a way that these
statements taken within

00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:49.120
days had not.

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:51.640
And so ultimately, the district
attorney's office

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:55.100
joined in a motion to vacate
the convictions, which

00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:57.220
happened in 2002.

00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:59.090
FEMALE SPEAKER: Raymond,
what was it like when--

00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:03.080
how did you find out that the
convictions had been vacated?

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:05.490
RAYMOND SANTANA: Well, was I was
serving a three and a half

00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:09.190
to seven year sentence at
Franklin Correction Facility

00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:13.770
for possession with the
intent to distribute.

00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:20.510
And they brought me back down
to Downstate, which is

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:22.830
indoctrination into the
Department of Corrections.

00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:26.790
And so it was there that
they brought me--

00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:28.890
and I didn't know it was
officers at first.

00:16:28.890 --> 00:16:31.040
And they were trying to conduct
an interview with me.

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:35.620
And their line, their reason was
that they wanted to change

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:36.670
juvenile laws.

00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:38.550
So they looked at our case,
and they just wanted some

00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:40.220
information.

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:42.170
But they kept asking about
Patricia Meili.

00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:45.430
And so I kept asking why, and
they wouldn't tell me.

00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:48.530
So we went on with
the meeting.

00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:51.000
And then afterwards, I wind
up calling my dad.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.430
And I said, you know, they
brought me back down here, and

00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:55.140
they're asking about the case.

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:57.250
But, at that point, he
had known already.

00:16:57.250 --> 00:16:58.580
The information got to him.

00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:00.040
But I didn't know.

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:01.440
And so he says, well,
you know sit down.

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:02.210
I've got something
to tell you.

00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:03.560
And I'm like, well what
you got to tell me?

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:05.019
And he's like, just sit down.

00:17:05.019 --> 00:17:05.869
I'm like, well, what?

00:17:05.869 --> 00:17:07.079
What is it?

00:17:07.079 --> 00:17:08.652
We've got six minutes
on this phone.

00:17:08.652 --> 00:17:11.430
SARAH BURNS: Right.

00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:13.380
RAYMOND SANTANA: And he goes,
well, you know, they found the

00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:14.980
guy that did your case.

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:15.780
And I'm like, what?

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:17.020
What are you talking about?

00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:17.859
And he says, yeah.

00:17:17.859 --> 00:17:19.450
They found the guy that
did your case.

00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:20.849
You're going to be
coming home soon.

00:17:20.849 --> 00:17:24.260
And I don't want to go into--
and so what happens is I

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:25.760
didn't believe him.

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:26.970
I was like, what?

00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:27.339
Get out.

00:17:27.339 --> 00:17:28.369
And I said, you know what?

00:17:28.369 --> 00:17:29.240
I'll talk to you later.

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:30.410
And I really hung up on him.

00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:31.120
FEMALE SPEAKER: He
hung up on him.

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:32.610
RAYMOND SANTANA: I
hung up on him.

00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:35.650
And I went back to my cell and
I thought about it, and I was

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:37.395
like, well, did they really
find this dude?

00:17:37.395 --> 00:17:38.850
And it's been so long.

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:40.670
And I was really doubtful.

00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:43.070
And I thought that they would
just try to make him the sixth

00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:46.400
man and then just try to
sweep it under the rug.

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:51.023
And I was in denial all the way
until almost my release.

00:17:51.023 --> 00:17:51.790
Yeah.

00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:54.550
FEMALE SPEAKER: And not only had
Matthias Reyes raped other

00:17:54.550 --> 00:17:57.820
women and beat them before the
night that you see in the

00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:01.720
film, but having gone free, he
went on to do that in the

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:04.970
weeks after, too.

00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:12.780
RAYMOND SANTANA: To add on to
what you just said, when he

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:14.560
went and confessed to the
district attorney's office

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:16.830
during the investigation,
they didn't believe him.

00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:19.490
And so what he did was he went
on to solve, like, four

00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:21.180
unsolved cases.

00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:22.710
And then that's when they
took him serious.

00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:23.070
SARAH BURNS: Right.

00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:27.580
He had been arrested later in
1989 and eventually pled

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:31.870
guilty to a series of rapes,
including a rape-murder that

00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:34.440
he committed, unrelated to
this case, that he had

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:35.750
committed through that
same summer.

00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:40.130
And so he was serving a life
sentence starting at around

00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:40.950
that same time.

00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:45.070
But the fact that they had
overlooked this evidence that

00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:49.360
was there, that existed even
in those days, that he was

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:53.120
responsible for the Central
Park Jogger rape not only

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:56.850
meant that these guys spent
many years in prison for

00:18:56.850 --> 00:19:00.440
something they didn't do but
also that Reyes was left on

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:02.770
the street to commit these
other crimes that he was

00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:04.040
eventually convicted of.

00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:05.230
Yeah.

00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:07.020
FEMALE SPEAKER: So I want to see
if anybody in the audience

00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:09.140
wants to ask any questions, and
I'll probably just repeat

00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:10.390
it so that it can be heard.

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:15.614
RAYMOND SANTANA: Don't all
raise your hand at once.

00:19:15.614 --> 00:19:16.096
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:19:16.096 --> 00:19:18.988
AUDIENCE: I'm just wondering
when was the first time that

00:19:18.988 --> 00:19:22.844
attorneys became involved,
like during questioning?

00:19:22.844 --> 00:19:23.500
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:25.880
The question is, did you have
any attorneys during

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:27.990
questioning, like when you were
being interrogated when

00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:30.940
they first picked you up?

00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:31.540
KOREY WISE: No.

00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:32.770
RAYMOND SANTANA: No.

00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:36.820
Basically, at that point,
because we were so young, a

00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:38.220
lot of that goes
over your head.

00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:41.000
You don't know what Miranda
Rights are.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.130
You don't know to say, hold
on, I need an attorney.

00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:44.720
All you're saying is
where's my dad?

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:45.490
Where's my mom?

00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:48.560
That's the first person
you're looking for.

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:51.270
And even when they come, the
police have a way of

00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:54.390
maneuvering around that, which
you'll see in the film.

00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:57.530
So if they want you that bad,
they're going to do everything

00:19:57.530 --> 00:19:58.440
they have to.

00:19:58.440 --> 00:19:58.750
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:01.600
And you talked about in the
film, Sarah, the immense

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:05.660
pressure to make sure
that someone

00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:06.720
was brought to justice.

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:07.200
SARAH BURNS: Sure.

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:10.180
I mean, I think the police knew
right away that this was

00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:14.410
going to be a big story, that
it happened in Central Park,

00:20:14.410 --> 00:20:15.920
and the sort of nature
of the crime.

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:20.630
I think there was an immediate
understanding that this was a

00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:23.150
case that they were going to be
under a lot of pressure to

00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:23.780
solve quickly.

00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:26.270
And they were determined
to do that.

00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:30.630
They had this idea, and they
went with it, and they used

00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:32.240
all their tricks.

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:35.900
And the power dynamic in an
interrogation room between

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:39.340
seasoned homicide detectives
with 20 years of experience

00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:45.350
and a 14-, 15-, or 16-year-old
is pretty extraordinary.

00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:50.780
They were all read their Miranda
Rights, but people

00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:52.810
don't understand what
that means.

00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:55.160
And this is sort of before the
days of "Law &amp; Order" even,

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:58.750
when everyone is kind of
familiar with these rituals.

00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:01.580
You don't know what that means
when you're a kid, and you

00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:02.470
don't have the support.

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:04.160
And the police are telling
you that you're

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:05.190
not really in trouble.

00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:06.820
We just need to ask you
a few questions.

00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:09.450
And they have these ways of
sort of glossing over this

00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:14.220
stuff and keeping the parents
at bay and sort of keeping

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:16.360
everyone in the dark
about what their

00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:17.530
intentions really are.

00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:21.375
And the interesting thing is
that there were a large group

00:21:21.375 --> 00:21:22.930
of kids who had gone to the park
that night, and most of

00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:24.990
them, at some point over these
couple of days, were brought

00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:26.410
in and interrogated.

00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:29.710
And some of those kids had
records or had been in trouble

00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:32.470
before, or some of them
had parents who--

00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:34.950
someone's parents worked in
corrections and sort of knew a

00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:36.240
little bit more about
this system.

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:40.610
And so those were the kids who
said, I want a lawyer, or I'm

00:21:40.610 --> 00:21:42.500
not going to say anything.

00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:45.110
And so ultimately, people
sometimes ask me, well, why

00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:48.780
did the police target these five
out of all these kids?

00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:54.080
They targeted everyone, and I
think that these guys were, in

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:59.580
some ways because of their
innocence, the most

00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:00.480
vulnerable.

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:03.170
They were the ones who hadn't
been arrested, who hadn't been

00:22:03.170 --> 00:22:05.920
in trouble, who didn't know how
to navigate the system.

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:08.705
And their parents and guardians,
to the extent that

00:22:08.705 --> 00:22:11.280
they were there, didn't know
that either, didn't have

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:13.360
experience with that, and didn't
know what to do or how

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:14.626
to help them.

00:22:14.626 --> 00:22:15.844
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yep.

00:22:15.844 --> 00:22:16.515
Other questions?

00:22:16.515 --> 00:22:16.780
Yeah.

00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:17.563
Over here.

00:22:17.563 --> 00:22:18.290
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:22:18.290 --> 00:22:19.800
I'm curious--

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:26.500
given that you were so young
when you were arrested, you

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:28.920
weren't finished school
by that time.

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:29.950
Have you been able to
finish school since?

00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:35.355
And also, when you were in
prison, was there any attempt

00:22:35.355 --> 00:22:39.392
to give you the schooling that
you were missing by not being

00:22:39.392 --> 00:22:40.110
on the outside?

00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:41.630
RAYMOND SANTANA: Yeah.

00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:45.140
I was going to the ninth
grade at that time.

00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:48.270
And so I was in eighth grade.

00:22:48.270 --> 00:22:54.020
And I wound up doing the rest of
the eighth grade in SPOFIT.

00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:58.740
And then I remember my junior
high school graduated me to

00:22:58.740 --> 00:22:59.610
high school.

00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:02.420
And so I was in with
[INAUDIBLE].

00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:03.810
My father was was receiving
cut cards

00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:05.380
when I was in prison.

00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:05.980
FEMALE SPEAKER: Oh, jeez.

00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:06.450
RAYMOND SANTANA: Yeah.

00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:11.100
And so after I was convicted
and I reached Goshen Secure

00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:14.830
Center, there was a program that
I was able to get my GED,

00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:17.120
and I was able to go to college
and get an associate's

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:20.202
degree before Pataki
cut the program.

00:23:20.202 --> 00:23:21.468
Yeah.

00:23:21.468 --> 00:23:22.410
FEMALE SPEAKER: I think we
have time for one more

00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:23.910
question, then we'll
have to wrap it up.

00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:25.790
AUDIENCE: What about
you, [INAUDIBLE]?

00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:26.340
FEMALE SPEAKER: Oh, excuse me.

00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:28.440
Korey?

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:29.650
SARAH BURNS: You got
a GED, right?

00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:29.930
Yeah.

00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:35.500
KOREY WISE: Right before I got
kidnapped, I got it in

00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:38.870
Stevenson High School
in the Bronx.

00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:42.730
And then later on, as I went
through, they were still

00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:45.130
trying to make me do the whole
high school thing again

00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:46.770
because they had--

00:23:46.770 --> 00:23:49.660
well, when you transition
like that, you have

00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:51.660
to start brand new.

00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:56.490
So shortly after that, I found
myself trying to do the

00:23:56.490 --> 00:23:58.630
college before the Pataki
took it out.

00:23:58.630 --> 00:23:58.970
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:01.260
And they ended up stopping
the education program.

00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:01.700
RAYMOND SANTANA: Right.

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:02.950
SARAH BURNS: They cut funding
for the program

00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:05.570
that made that possible.

00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:07.070
FEMALE SPEAKER: One
more question.

00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:08.956
AUDIENCE: What do you want the
audience to take away from the

00:24:08.956 --> 00:24:10.740
film, and what's been
the reaction?

00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:13.220
SARAH BURNS: Well, we actually
just had a really amazing

00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:18.590
screening last night as part of
the DOC NYC Film Festival,

00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:23.010
where we had all five of the
Central Park Five together on

00:24:23.010 --> 00:24:25.950
stage, and together in the same
place for the first time

00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:30.810
since they were arraigned in
1989, which was a pretty

00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:32.320
amazing experience.

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:33.490
I know it was for me.

00:24:33.490 --> 00:24:35.020
I think it was for the
audience, too.

00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:35.800
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:38.130
SARAH BURNS: And we've really
been having a great experience

00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:41.000
showing it to some audiences
and having--

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.660
I mean, you guys can talk about
a little bit of what

00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:45.600
that feels like for you,
to get that kind of

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:46.500
response that you have.

00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:48.670
But as far as what I
would hope people

00:24:48.670 --> 00:24:50.360
take away from it--

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:51.890
as I said before, part
of this is about

00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:53.210
just informing people.

00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:54.850
This is what happened.

00:24:54.850 --> 00:24:58.630
But we always made this film
not as a whodunit.

00:24:58.630 --> 00:24:59.840
This wasn't a question.

00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:02.020
We learned about this
case knowing that

00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:04.100
these guys were innocent.

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:06.060
But as a how did this happen.

00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:09.540
And so I think understanding
the ways that this happened

00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:12.640
and the sort of mechanisms by
which a miscarriage of justice

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:16.420
like this happens is a really
important first step, and

00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:18.720
hopefully the beginning of a
conversation about how do we

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:20.620
fix those things and how
do we prevent this

00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:21.890
from happening again?

00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:24.900
Because I think that despite the
fact that New York is very

00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:28.240
different now than it was then,
I think that not enough

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:30.510
has changed, and certainly
something like this, I

00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:32.270
believe, could happen again.

00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:36.360
The interrogation tactics
are exactly the same.

00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:40.100
And there's still, to this day,
no sense among the NYPD

00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:42.960
that they even did anything
wrong or even that they got

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:44.360
this wrong.

00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:47.040
They've resisted even the idea
that the convictions should

00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:47.880
have been vacated.

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:48.305
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:25:48.305 --> 00:25:48.730
RAYMOND SANTANA: Yeah.

00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:50.880
SARAH BURNS: So I say we still
need to be talking about this.

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:53.120
FEMALE SPEAKER: Korey and
Raymond, what has it been like

00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:55.800
having to relive and
retell this story?

00:26:02.490 --> 00:26:02.950
KOREY WISE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:08.240
to my destiny, it's really
still beyond me.

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:10.820
I'm still walking on
clouds right now.

00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:12.930
Because [? real ?] talk.

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:24.040
I have no animosity towards my
brothers, but there was far

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:25.710
from a [? model ?]
on Rikers Island.

00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:28.900
I just responded.

00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:29.970
I just responded.

00:26:29.970 --> 00:26:39.980
And as of now, I'm glad that
I'm alive, as well as my

00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:42.740
brother, Raymond, and the
rest of the guys,

00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:45.150
Kevin, Yusef, McCray.

00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:48.370
I'm glad we're all
alive to tell our

00:26:48.370 --> 00:26:50.400
own individual stories.

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:54.920
And so the world, who's been
hearing so much of the nasty

00:26:54.920 --> 00:27:01.220
of it, they can finally see and
they can put this to rest.

00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:01.690
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:27:01.690 --> 00:27:02.630
Raymond?

00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:06.830
RAYMOND SANTANA: For me,
basically, back in 1989, we

00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:10.510
were 14-, 15-, and 16-year-olds

00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:12.450
when this story happened.

00:27:12.450 --> 00:27:16.010
And we were taken away-- our
voices were gone, also,

00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:17.120
through the whole process.

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:20.895
So you never got to hear
Raymond, Korey, and the rest

00:27:20.895 --> 00:27:21.960
of the guys' stories.

00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:25.000
All you got to read was what
the media put together, the

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.470
interviews that they conducted
in our neighborhoods, and how

00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:31.010
they dissected our lives, but
you never got to hear us.

00:27:31.010 --> 00:27:35.730
And then we were also replaced
with Wild Thing, Urban

00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:38.640
Terrorists, rapists,
Wolf Pack.

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:41.750
And so that became what was
associated with us.

00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:44.790
The Central Park Five label was
something really negative.

00:27:44.790 --> 00:27:49.820
And so what this movie does for
us is restore us and gives

00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:52.490
us back our voices.

00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:56.270
And what you guys do for us is
when you watch this movie and

00:27:56.270 --> 00:28:00.300
you respond and you engage in
conversation with us and you

00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:03.870
talk about how you feel and how
it makes you outraged, and

00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:06.490
that's part of the healing
process for us--

00:28:06.490 --> 00:28:09.440
to see the response that we get
from you guys now, because

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:12.160
in '89, there was nothing
but negative responses.

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:15.690
And now, in 2012, it's
nothing but positive.

00:28:15.690 --> 00:28:17.340
And so it helps us
a great deal.

00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:20.800
And what we want you guys to
take away from the movie is

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:24.940
also that we're not animals,
that we are human beings and

00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:25.650
we were kids.

00:28:25.650 --> 00:28:31.670
And we want you to indulge in
discussions with other people,

00:28:31.670 --> 00:28:34.510
like Sarah said, and
find ways of how we

00:28:34.510 --> 00:28:36.760
can put this to rest.

00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:37.350
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:39.930
Go ahead, Korey.

00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:44.080
KOREY WISE: As a hip hop fan,
the world Wild Thing that I'm

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:48.770
hearing so much about, it came
from a hip hop artist by the

00:28:48.770 --> 00:28:50.065
name of Tone Loc.

00:28:50.065 --> 00:28:52.180
He's more West Coast.

00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:57.010
He had an old song called "Wild
Thing." and it went from

00:28:57.010 --> 00:29:00.640
there to commercials, and it
started talking about food.

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:08.170
But when I was in Central
Bookings, I was hearing--

00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:13.140
I don't know where I was hearing
it from, but I was

00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:15.800
hearing "Wild Thing."
I was hearing it.

00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:23.290
So when I was hearing it later
on, it was picked up and made

00:29:23.290 --> 00:29:25.140
a negative out it.

00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:27.110
It was positive, made a
negative out of it.

00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:29.735
But it was picked up.

00:29:29.735 --> 00:29:33.350
The media, they made
a negative--

00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:35.200
that was out there,
[? "Wild Thing." ?]

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:38.210
So that's about it.

00:29:38.210 --> 00:29:38.720
RAYMOND SANTANA: Yeah.

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:41.970
FEMALE SPEAKER: And I know that
there's nothing that can

00:29:41.970 --> 00:29:45.870
give back what you
were taken away.

00:29:45.870 --> 00:29:50.370
But if people do want to help,
there is an ongoing case.

00:29:50.370 --> 00:29:52.310
It's now been nine years--

00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:54.410
a civil suit against the city.

00:29:54.410 --> 00:29:57.290
And I know that you guys can't
talk about it too much, but

00:29:57.290 --> 00:30:00.010
the hearing is upcoming
on December 17.

00:30:00.010 --> 00:30:02.910
And if you are moved by this,
you can write letters to Mayor

00:30:02.910 --> 00:30:07.640
Bloomberg and others to let them
know that we all know the

00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:09.850
truth about what happened.

00:30:09.850 --> 00:30:10.070
RAYMOND SANTANA: Yeah.

00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:12.630
It's all about the numbers
at the end of the day.

00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:13.800
That's what they respect--

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:17.310
how do people come out, how you
support, how you react,

00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:18.420
what's your feedback.

00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:21.850
We have a Facebook page, The
Central Park Five, that is

00:30:21.850 --> 00:30:23.190
growing daily.

00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:26.300
We're always on Facebook
and Twitter trying to

00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:28.170
put the word out.

00:30:28.170 --> 00:30:30.730
So we encourage you guys to come
on out and stand with us.

00:30:30.730 --> 00:30:33.670
KOREY WISE: Every month that I
find myself in this federal

00:30:33.670 --> 00:30:38.710
building without my coworkers
with me--

00:30:38.710 --> 00:30:42.210
codefendants with me--

00:30:42.210 --> 00:30:44.110
this city loves it.

00:30:44.110 --> 00:30:48.900
They love not seeing no
media or supporters.

00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:50.130
They love it.

00:30:50.130 --> 00:30:50.530
RAYMOND SANTANA: Yeah.

00:30:50.530 --> 00:30:52.060
KOREY WISE: They love it.

00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:53.090
They love it.

00:30:53.090 --> 00:31:01.090
And recently, when people have
been coming out, the city's

00:31:01.090 --> 00:31:04.350
been getting nervous.

00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:06.480
Trust me.

00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:13.720
And for the first time, when I
saw the judge, when he came

00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:18.235
out from his chambers to the
courtroom and he saw, he had

00:31:18.235 --> 00:31:19.440
to take a double take.

00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:21.460
He damn near caught a
heart attack that he

00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:23.200
didn't expect that.

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:24.750
He said, what--

00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:25.885
did I miss something here?

00:31:25.885 --> 00:31:27.124
What's happening?

00:31:27.124 --> 00:31:27.988
FEMALE SPEAKER: I bet.

00:31:27.988 --> 00:31:28.420
RAYMOND SANTANA: Yeah.

00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:31.070
KOREY WISE: So it helps.

00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:34.060
And like I said, with
it, I pray.

00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:37.790
As a spiritual person, I pray
that within my soul for

00:31:37.790 --> 00:31:40.470
something like that to come
about because it was just

00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:43.430
eating me up alive
for so long.

00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:47.270
Coming up in there, there's no
rhythm going on up there.

00:31:47.270 --> 00:31:50.300
They're just dragging.

00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:52.590
The city's just dragging,
talking about nothing.

00:31:52.590 --> 00:31:54.210
They're just dragging.

00:31:54.210 --> 00:31:54.610
Nothing.

00:31:54.610 --> 00:31:55.010
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:31:55.010 --> 00:31:58.030
Well, thank you for telling your
story, and the film, and

00:31:58.030 --> 00:31:59.860
the book, and being here.

00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:01.450
I'm sure it's really difficult,
but we really

00:32:01.450 --> 00:32:02.170
appreciate it.

00:32:02.170 --> 00:32:02.910
And thank you, Sarah.

00:32:02.910 --> 00:32:05.970
And she made the film with
her husband Dave

00:32:05.970 --> 00:32:06.950
and her father Ken.

00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:09.350
Thanks to you all for making
the story happen.

00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:10.600
SARAH BURNS: Thank you.
