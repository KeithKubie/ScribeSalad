the thing that drives me crazy when to
reinvestigate stories there are about a

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:11.360
reinvestigate stories there are about a
 

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.330
reinvestigate stories there are about a
hundred deaths linked to this or there

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:13.340
hundred deaths linked to this or there
 

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:15.279
hundred deaths linked to this or there
there are estimated to be one hundred

00:07:15.279 --> 00:07:15.289
there are estimated to be one hundred
 

00:07:15.289 --> 00:07:17.379
there are estimated to be one hundred
and you know dust linked us what I'd

00:07:17.379 --> 00:07:17.389
and you know dust linked us what I'd
 

00:07:17.389 --> 00:07:18.820
and you know dust linked us what I'd
like to do is come and say there were 97

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:18.830
like to do is come and say there were 97
 

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:20.649
like to do is come and say there were 97
deaths linked to this I like the

00:07:20.649 --> 00:07:20.659
deaths linked to this I like the
 

00:07:20.659 --> 00:07:22.029
deaths linked to this I like the
precision you know the precision

00:07:22.029 --> 00:07:22.039
precision you know the precision
 

00:07:22.039 --> 00:07:23.830
precision you know the precision
journalism so what I look for is a way

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:23.840
journalism so what I look for is a way
 

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:25.269
journalism so what I look for is a way
to quantify so in the state of

00:07:25.269 --> 00:07:25.279
to quantify so in the state of
 

00:07:25.279 --> 00:07:26.980
to quantify so in the state of
Washington we're fortunate because death

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:26.990
Washington we're fortunate because death
 

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:29.110
Washington we're fortunate because death
certificates are public records and so

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:29.120
certificates are public records and so
 

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.629
certificates are public records and so
we obtained the database of every death

00:07:31.629 --> 00:07:31.639
we obtained the database of every death
 

00:07:31.639 --> 00:07:33.399
we obtained the database of every death
for ten years in the state of Washington

00:07:33.399 --> 00:07:33.409
for ten years in the state of Washington
 

00:07:33.409 --> 00:07:35.769
for ten years in the state of Washington
is approximately 40,000 plus dust a year

00:07:35.769 --> 00:07:35.779
is approximately 40,000 plus dust a year
 

00:07:35.779 --> 00:07:39.339
is approximately 40,000 plus dust a year
and with each computer entry I got

00:07:39.339 --> 00:07:39.349
and with each computer entry I got
 

00:07:39.349 --> 00:07:41.439
and with each computer entry I got
probably 30 40 pieces of information

00:07:41.439 --> 00:07:41.449
probably 30 40 pieces of information
 

00:07:41.449 --> 00:07:42.939
probably 30 40 pieces of information
about every death what was the primary

00:07:42.939 --> 00:07:42.949
about every death what was the primary
 

00:07:42.949 --> 00:07:44.769
about every death what was the primary
cause of death was accidental or

00:07:44.769 --> 00:07:44.779
cause of death was accidental or
 

00:07:44.779 --> 00:07:46.929
cause of death was accidental or
intentional was there a crime involved

00:07:46.929 --> 00:07:46.939
intentional was there a crime involved
 

00:07:46.939 --> 00:07:48.339
intentional was there a crime involved
what we're drumming up there was drugs

00:07:48.339 --> 00:07:48.349
what we're drumming up there was drugs
 

00:07:48.349 --> 00:07:49.929
what we're drumming up there was drugs
if it was an overdose death it would

00:07:49.929 --> 00:07:49.939
if it was an overdose death it would
 

00:07:49.939 --> 00:07:51.700
if it was an overdose death it would
tell me what the primary drug was an

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:51.710
tell me what the primary drug was an
 

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:53.350
tell me what the primary drug was an
abaya show me any secondary or third

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:53.360
abaya show me any secondary or third
 

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.420
abaya show me any secondary or third
drugs so by putting them into a database

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:55.430
drugs so by putting them into a database
 

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:57.760
drugs so by putting them into a database
I was able to look at every person who

00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:57.770
I was able to look at every person who
 

00:07:57.770 --> 00:07:59.740
I was able to look at every person who
had methadone in their body at the time

00:07:59.740 --> 00:07:59.750
had methadone in their body at the time
 

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:01.659
had methadone in their body at the time
of death and whether methadone was the

00:08:01.659 --> 00:08:01.669
of death and whether methadone was the
 

00:08:01.669 --> 00:08:03.429
of death and whether methadone was the
sole drug in their body or whether there

00:08:03.429 --> 00:08:03.439
sole drug in their body or whether there
 

00:08:03.439 --> 00:08:06.059
sole drug in their body or whether there
were other drugs such as you know

00:08:06.059 --> 00:08:06.069
were other drugs such as you know
 

00:08:06.069 --> 00:08:08.110
were other drugs such as you know
benzodiazepines which are often common

00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:08.120
benzodiazepines which are often common
 

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.879
benzodiazepines which are often common
for depression are those kinds of other

00:08:09.879 --> 00:08:09.889
for depression are those kinds of other
 

00:08:09.889 --> 00:08:11.610
for depression are those kinds of other
issues so we were able to very quickly

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:11.620
issues so we were able to very quickly
 

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:14.679
issues so we were able to very quickly
categorize that the population of desk

00:08:14.679 --> 00:08:14.689
categorize that the population of desk
 

00:08:14.689 --> 00:08:17.110
categorize that the population of desk
then when did you have the idea to map

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:17.120
then when did you have the idea to map
 

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:19.629
then when did you have the idea to map
those deaths to put those that you know

00:08:19.629 --> 00:08:19.639
those deaths to put those that you know
 

00:08:19.639 --> 00:08:21.519
those deaths to put those that you know
to mark the addresses of those who had

00:08:21.519 --> 00:08:21.529
to mark the addresses of those who had
 

00:08:21.529 --> 00:08:23.279
to mark the addresses of those who had
died which was you know the map mouri

00:08:23.279 --> 00:08:23.289
died which was you know the map mouri
 

00:08:23.289 --> 00:08:25.629
died which was you know the map mouri
the man when do we have the idea for

00:08:25.629 --> 00:08:25.639
the man when do we have the idea for
 

00:08:25.639 --> 00:08:27.100
the man when do we have the idea for
mapping it was right away very from the

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:27.110
mapping it was right away very from the
 

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:28.450
mapping it was right away very from the
beginning let's show people where the

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:28.460
beginning let's show people where the
 

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:30.459
beginning let's show people where the
desks are and part of the reasoning for

00:08:30.459 --> 00:08:30.469
desks are and part of the reasoning for
 

00:08:30.469 --> 00:08:32.409
desks are and part of the reasoning for
us and start off is just a simple dot

00:08:32.409 --> 00:08:32.419
us and start off is just a simple dot
 

00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:34.569
us and start off is just a simple dot

which came later as we started learning

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:36.500
which came later as we started learning
 

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:38.649
which came later as we started learning
more about this but the visually I just

00:08:38.649 --> 00:08:38.659
more about this but the visually I just
 

00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:40.420
more about this but the visually I just
like the every project I do I just like

00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:40.430
like the every project I do I just like
 

00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:42.279
like the every project I do I just like
to show people where is it at and what I

00:08:42.279 --> 00:08:42.289
to show people where is it at and what I
 

00:08:42.289 --> 00:08:44.680
to show people where is it at and what I
like to do for the reader is this isn't

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:44.690
like to do for the reader is this isn't
 

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:46.840
like to do for the reader is this isn't
some esoteric topic that affects you

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:46.850
some esoteric topic that affects you
 

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:48.430
some esoteric topic that affects you
know other people here's someone

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:48.440
know other people here's someone
 

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:50.259
know other people here's someone
probably in your neighborhood you know

00:08:50.259 --> 00:08:50.269
probably in your neighborhood you know
 

00:08:50.269 --> 00:08:52.150
probably in your neighborhood you know
here's someone in your zip code and that

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:52.160
here's someone in your zip code and that
 

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.670
here's someone in your zip code and that
was the first purpose of the dot map was

00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:54.680
was the first purpose of the dot map was
 

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:56.259
was the first purpose of the dot map was
to say here's here's where the people

00:08:56.259 --> 00:08:56.269
to say here's here's where the people
 

00:08:56.269 --> 00:08:58.030
to say here's here's where the people
are this is real you know these are our

00:08:58.030 --> 00:08:58.040
are this is real you know these are our
 

00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:59.290
are this is real you know these are our
neighbors and these are people make a

00:08:59.290 --> 00:08:59.300
neighbors and these are people make a
 

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:00.780
neighbors and these are people make a
letter to come and show us

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:00.790
letter to come and show us
 

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:04.200
letter to come and show us
okay so this is the dot map and and what

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:04.210
okay so this is the dot map and and what
 

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:06.630
okay so this is the dot map and and what
we did is made it interactive so that

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:06.640
we did is made it interactive so that
 

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:09.240
we did is made it interactive so that
you got beyond just the one surface

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:09.250
you got beyond just the one surface
 

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:11.430
you got beyond just the one surface
level here's where they at and we tried

00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:11.440
level here's where they at and we tried
 

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:13.740
level here's where they at and we tried
to show here's here's the the

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:13.750
to show here's here's the the
 

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:15.990
to show here's here's the the
differentiation and income and this came

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:16.000
differentiation and income and this came
 

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.400
differentiation and income and this came
towards the end of the project is we

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:17.410
towards the end of the project is we
 

00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:20.070
towards the end of the project is we
realized that the state program that

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:20.080
realized that the state program that
 

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:22.260
realized that the state program that
picks which drugs people have to take

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:22.270
picks which drugs people have to take
 

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:24.630
picks which drugs people have to take
our is a state program that primarily

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:24.640
our is a state program that primarily
 

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:27.030
our is a state program that primarily
catters caters to Medicaid recipients

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:27.040
catters caters to Medicaid recipients
 

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:28.770
catters caters to Medicaid recipients
and so we started wondering why I wonder

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:28.780
and so we started wondering why I wonder
 

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:30.420
and so we started wondering why I wonder
if most of the deaths that are Medicaid

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:30.430
if most of the deaths that are Medicaid
 

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:32.490
if most of the deaths that are Medicaid
desk even though any doctor can

00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:32.500
desk even though any doctor can
 

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:34.680
desk even though any doctor can
subscribe methadone if they have a

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:34.690
subscribe methadone if they have a
 

00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:36.780
subscribe methadone if they have a
choice is method on the first choice or

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:36.790
choice is method on the first choice or
 

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:39.150
choice is method on the first choice or
not and so when we started mapping this

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:39.160
not and so when we started mapping this
 

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.490
not and so when we started mapping this
we started color coding the areas and

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:41.500
we started color coding the areas and
 

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:44.640
we started color coding the areas and
basically the darker areas are the

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:44.650
basically the darker areas are the
 

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:47.070
basically the darker areas are the
wealthy areas in state of Washington and

00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:47.080
wealthy areas in state of Washington and
 

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:49.470
wealthy areas in state of Washington and
the lighter areas of the low-income and

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:49.480
the lighter areas of the low-income and
 

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:52.020
the lighter areas of the low-income and
so let's take a look here here's Mercer

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:52.030
so let's take a look here here's Mercer
 

00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:55.260
so let's take a look here here's Mercer
Island so if you click on the island you

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:55.270
Island so if you click on the island you
 

00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:58.560
Island so if you click on the island you
can see here we have a pop-up that shows

00:09:58.560 --> 00:09:58.570
can see here we have a pop-up that shows
 

00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:01.140
can see here we have a pop-up that shows
that this is a 1000 to 185 thousand

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:01.150
that this is a 1000 to 185 thousand
 

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:03.390
that this is a 1000 to 185 thousand
dollar medium income based on census

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:03.400
dollar medium income based on census
 

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:05.100
dollar medium income based on census
data and as you can see there's not a

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:05.110
data and as you can see there's not a
 

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:07.290
data and as you can see there's not a
single dot and mercer island but you go

00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:07.300
single dot and mercer island but you go
 

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:08.510
single dot and mercer island but you go
over here where there's a lot of dots

00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:08.520
over here where there's a lot of dots
 

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:12.120
over here where there's a lot of dots
and you'll see that this is zero to

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:12.130
and you'll see that this is zero to
 

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:14.250
and you'll see that this is zero to
forty five thousand dollar census tract

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:14.260
forty five thousand dollar census tract
 

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:15.600
forty five thousand dollar census tract
and then when you click on the

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:15.610
and then when you click on the
 

00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:17.910
and then when you click on the
individual dots you were able to see

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:17.920
individual dots you were able to see

unnecessary hurt the family so we only
allow people to drill so far down but

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:45.880
allow people to drill so far down but
