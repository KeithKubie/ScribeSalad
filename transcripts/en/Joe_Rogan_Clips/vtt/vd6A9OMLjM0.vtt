WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.730
The Joe Rogan experience.
Right.
And then who did Doonesbury?

2
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.580
That's like the political one,
right?
Is that his name?
Maybe?
Yeah.

3
00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:17.670
What the fuck?
Who the fuck was Zit Trudeau?
What's his first name?
Gary Trudeau.

4
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.530
Isn't that,
what's the name?
The Guy who runs Canada.
Justin.

5
00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.550
Justin.
That guy?
Yeah.
I never got to and Sperry.
I never like,

6
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.020
it was like too clever.
I was just like,
okay.
They're like,

7
00:00:29.021 --> 00:00:31.110
I guess they're taken down Ronald Reagan or something,

8
00:00:31.111 --> 00:00:32.490
but I don't know what the fuck they're talking about.

9
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.940
Doonesbury's weird too because they basically,

10
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.650
they pigeonholed hunter s Thompson and turned him into this.

11
00:00:40.651 --> 00:00:45.300
They had a character that they were doing.
I think he wound up suing them.
Yeah.

12
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.900
There's this character is basically the exact same guy,

13
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.800
just slightly different and he was always like shooting off guns and doing a

14
00:00:52.801 --> 00:00:56.310
bunch of crazy shit.
I forget his name.

15
00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.150
I forget the name of the guy.
They gave him a different name,

16
00:01:00.151 --> 00:01:04.080
like uncle something or another.
Yeah,
but that was there.

17
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.070
I mean that was Garry Trudeau's take on hunter s Thompson and it wound up

18
00:01:08.071 --> 00:01:11.370
driving hunters Thompson nuts.
Is this still real?

19
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.080
He's still doing like he's doing Trump this.

20
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.150
That's 2017.
Wow.
Wow.

21
00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:23.070
Yeah.
But he,
um,

22
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.920
so he created this character that was basically the most exaggerated versions of

23
00:01:28.921 --> 00:01:32.790
hunter s Thompson one hunters Thompson was fucking around and it sort of defined

24
00:01:32.791 --> 00:01:34.110
who hunter s Thompson was too.

25
00:01:34.111 --> 00:01:38.210
A lot of people because instead of being this brilliant journalist who,
you know,

26
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.330
those great writer,

27
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:45.230
he also became this kind of like guy just shoots guns and Zoe's drunk and then

28
00:01:46.561 --> 00:01:47.970
you fall into that trap.

29
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.430
I think comedians that have a persona like oftentimes fall,

30
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.930
like you know,
dice that's not,
you know,

31
00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.980
his real name is Andrew Silverstein and the dice character was a part of his

32
00:02:01.111 --> 00:02:04.080
act.
He's had a bunch of different things.
You do impressions.

33
00:02:04.081 --> 00:02:08.310
We did Travolta impression.
Yeah.
Phenomenal.
Yeah,
phenomenal Travolta impression.

34
00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.580
And then the dice man became like a part of his act and then he just decided

35
00:02:14.071 --> 00:02:16.740
that's the best part.
So I'm just going to do dice all the time.

36
00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.410
And then he decided,
you know what?
Fuck live in like a regular person.

37
00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.270
It was going to be dice all the time.

38
00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.780
So he became the guy in his act.
I mean,

39
00:02:24.781 --> 00:02:28.140
that's who he is like most of the time.
Oh yeah,
yeah.

40
00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.020
Kinison Kennison and similar,
similar situation.

41
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.560
I'd never met Kinison Kinison I mean,
he died well before I got into stand up,

42
00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.850
but I'd never met dice.
And I've always like sang his praises.
Like,

43
00:02:37.851 --> 00:02:40.890
I think the day the laughter died is one of the greatest comedy albums of all

44
00:02:40.891 --> 00:02:45.630
time.
Uh,
and uh,
and I've just never met him.
He's great.
Yeah.

45
00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.420
I'll introduce you next time I see him at the store if you're there.

46
00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.230
I've heard great stories.
He must like,
he must know who I am.
Oh yeah.

47
00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.420
Yeah.
I wants to govern.
What if he wasn't what?
You'd be mad?
I wouldn't be mad.

48
00:02:57.421 --> 00:03:01.450
I'd be surprised is because I've spoken him publicly that like if he was,

49
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.270
if he was wondering why he sold like a thousand copies of the day,

50
00:03:04.271 --> 00:03:06.790
the laughter died after I like talked about it on a podcast.

51
00:03:06.791 --> 00:03:09.520
Like he would hear that,
you know,
someone says something nice about you,

52
00:03:09.521 --> 00:03:13.060
you find out.
Um,
but,
uh,
uh,

53
00:03:13.061 --> 00:03:15.220
I was at governor's once and they were like all probably were like,

54
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.090
dice was here last weekend and he left one of his gloves,
you know,

55
00:03:19.091 --> 00:03:22.600
the fingerless gloves.
And I was just like,
give it to me.
Like,

56
00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.120
what do I have to do to take this glove home that I'd still have Alec where'd

57
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.480
around wet around.
Sometimes it's fun.
Do you read it and write jokes with it?
Oh,

58
00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.130
well I'll walk around like just doing the,
doing a little,

59
00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.890
there's a little o's but smoking cigarettes like blues.
Yeah.

60
00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.640
But uh,
but yeah,
love,
love dies.

61
00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.960
But those characters from guys get lumped into a character when you get locked

62
00:03:43.961 --> 00:03:47.040
into that,
it can be very self defining,
you know?

63
00:03:47.041 --> 00:03:49.900
Of course we're Kennison I think it was very self defined.
Oh,
big time.

64
00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.350
I thought about that when I was like creating my persona.
It was like,

65
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.690
what's going to age?
Well,
you know,

66
00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.130
like not like I think of a guy like Nick Swardson,
you know,

67
00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.040
who's just like party all the time.
Like he's a college kid forever.
Right?

68
00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.490
It's like,
how long can you do that for?
You know what I mean?

69
00:04:06.491 --> 00:04:09.550
It's like still kind of asked to do it and it's still great,
but I'm like,

70
00:04:09.551 --> 00:04:11.530
are you enjoying this?
You know,

71
00:04:11.531 --> 00:04:16.360
like I want to be able to like kind of hold on to my dignity.
You know,

72
00:04:16.361 --> 00:04:19.570
he's the best version of it.
Emo Phillips.
Yes.

73
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.660
That's the best example because it's like wow.
Like,

74
00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:25.660
cause when he was a young sort of cute guy,

75
00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.620
it was kind of strange to watch them do calm medical.

76
00:04:29.621 --> 00:04:34.090
I plus when you're 60 though and you're doing that,
people are like,
hey man,

77
00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.160
this is just weird.
Yeah.

78
00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.280
Like bobcat talked about that like that bobcat had this moment where he stopped

79
00:04:41.501 --> 00:04:45.460
being bobcat and people,
they came and how can we not do the scream?
He's like,

80
00:04:45.461 --> 00:04:49.990
fuck you,
I'm not doing it.
I hate told me the best story ever.
He said,
he's in a,

81
00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.980
he's at a comedy,

82
00:04:50.981 --> 00:04:55.390
works in Denver doing a weekend and he's eating shit every show and every show

83
00:04:55.391 --> 00:04:58.540
he's just bombing and everyone's going to do the voice,
do the voice.

84
00:04:58.541 --> 00:05:00.370
And he was like,
no,
I'm not.
I don't do the voice anymore.

85
00:05:00.371 --> 00:05:05.030
I'm not doing the voice late show Saturday.
Uh,
someone in the back yells,

86
00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:09.370
we're from Aurora,
do the voice for us.
And he goes,
Oh,
you're from Aurora.

87
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.380
At least you learn to sit in the back.
And he said,

88
00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.220
and this is like a year after the shooting of the movie there.
Yes.

89
00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.880
A year after that.
And he said,
the entire audience,

90
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.290
the entire audience just pretended he didn't say it,

91
00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:31.630
they didn't boo,
they didn't laugh.
They just acted like nothing had happened.

92
00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.690
And he did the rest of the show when he said it made the whole weekend worth of

93
00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:38.110
fun
just to say that,
just to say that.
