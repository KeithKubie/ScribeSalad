Hello everyone.

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:22.060
Thanks for coming out on
a rainy Tuesday afternoon.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:23.860
My name is Rob Casper.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.160
I'm the head of the Poetry
and Literature Center here

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.630
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.210
And I'm delighted to welcome
you to our kick-off event.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.970
What is, what was, what
is, and what will be.

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.880
A cross-genre look
at Afrofuturism.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.320
Part of Celebration of
Afrofuturism that will go

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.280
into the evening and
across the street.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.050
Over to the Folger
Shakespeare Library.

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.330
Before I go further, let
me tell you a little bit

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.200
about the Poetry and
Literature Center

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.350
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.110
The Center is home to the
Poet Laureate and Poet-- .

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.310
The only federally-funded
position

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.350
for a literary artist
in this country.

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.350
It also hosts, hosts a range
of programs such as this one,

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.900
mostly here at the library.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.120
But also at the Hill
Center and around town.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.140
And really, around the country.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.530
If you want to find out
more about our programs,

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.820
you can go to our website,
www.LOC.gov/poetry.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.790
You can also sign
the sign-up sheet

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.400
which is outside in the foyer.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.550
And we have surveys
on the chairs.

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.270
We'd love to have
you fill them out.

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:32.880
I'll remind you at the
end of the program.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.620
But please do so.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:35.920
You can hand them to me.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.220
You can leave them on the seats.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.520
You can leave them on the table.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.980
Wherever you leave them, we
will find them and report

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.410
on what you have to say.

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:48.140
It seem like eons ago when
dear Teri Cross Davis,

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.800
the force behind the
Folger Shakespeare Library's

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.870
[inaudible] Poetry Series
contacted our office

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.850
with the idea of
celebrating Afrofuturism.

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.870
And for those of you who
now Teri, that's no surprise

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.430
that she had a visionary
plan in mind.

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.090
As she often does.

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.870
Much thanks to Teri,
who's been so much fun

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.380
to work with over the years.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.900
For all that you've done.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.320
For all your behind-the-scenes
work to make this happen.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.740
There was a lot of negotiating,

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.320
figuring out and
what made sense.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.620
And how we were going to do it.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.220
And I couldn't be happier
at what we have in store

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.190
for us this afternoon
and this evening.

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.610
As I said, there's an
event at 7:30PM just

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:30.910
down the street at the Folger.

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.330
Featuring our presenters.

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.080
You should note that
advance tickets are sold out.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.710
But especially because the
weather is not so great,

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.410
there'll be a standby line.

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.940
And when tickets, should
they become available,

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.240
you can pick them up.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.520
That stand, standby
line starts at 6:30PM.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.330
So if you don't have
tickets, I'd say try your luck

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.450
and hopefully your
luck will be good.

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.420
I also want to thank our,
our other presenting partner,

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.520

There she is.

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.790
Thanks, Shahenda for all that
you did making this happen.

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.290

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.080

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.080
&gt;&gt; Gwydion Suilebhan:
Hi, everybody!

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.230
Nice to see you all.

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.190
Yeah, the rain did
not stop this crowd.

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:41.490
That's great.

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:45.240
My sincere thanks to the Library
of Congress and to the Folger

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.540
for making everything happen.

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:47.840
We are really honored

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.290
to be partnered tonight,
today and tonight.

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.070
At, at PEN/Faulkner, we
work to ensure that stories

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.380
and storytellers of
all ages flourish.

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.460
Both in D.C. and all
over the country.

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.360
We give out the PEN/Faulkner
Award for Fiction,

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.530
one of the top three literary
prizes in the United States.

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.970
And the PEN/Malamud Award
for the short story.

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:14.810
We, also here in D.C., we, our
Writers in Schools program.

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.470
We bring free books and
authors into D.C. public

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.010
and public charter schools to
inspire the next generation

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:23.880
of readers and writers.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.820
And then we also host
events like this one.

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.730
In which we invite
writers to help us.

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.580
In the words of the
great performance artist

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:33.880
and playwright Taylor Mac,

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.230
to help us "dream
the culture forward."

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:38.510
We're going to be hearing

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.900
from three very inspiring
artists tonight.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.960
And the conversation they
kick off will be incomplete.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.810
Unless you all help us
carry it forward from here.

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.510
So ask questions during the Q&amp;A.

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.680
Talk about what we
hear tonight, today.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:55.980
With the people you
came here with.

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.510
And better yet, talk about it

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:00.800
with the people you're sitting
next to who you don't know.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.900
Let's make it a robust
conversation

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:04.930
that leaves this room.

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.230
And goes out into the world.

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:11.250
So now I want to introduce
tonight's moderator.

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.660
Or today's moderator,
Sheree Renee Thomas.

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.100

She's an award-winning

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:22.170
and her worth is, work is
inspired by myth and folklore.

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:24.660
By natural science and conjure.

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.560
Her roots in Memphis and
the genius culture created

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.660
in the Mississippi Delta.

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.510
Thank you so much,
Sheree, and welcome.

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:40.090

And thank you to Teri
who is a fellow poet.

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:48.300

in her own rights.

So thank you so much.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.490
I am honored to introduce
these fabulous writers.

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:55.990
This is a cross-genre
conversation

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:57.490
that we're going to have.

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.760
These writers write
science fiction, fantasy.

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.450
They write horror,
they write in stories,

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:06.690
they write novels,
and they write poems.

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:10.420
And new forms that we haven't
quite given a name to, as well.

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:15.510
So the first writer I'm going
to introduce is Tananarive Due.

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:27.040

of having Jordan
Peele visit her class.

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:04.350
Which she documented as well.

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:05.650
You can see that online.

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:06.950
It was amazing.

It was called Freedom in the
Family: A mother/daughter memoir

of the fight for civil rights.

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:08.850
Patricia Stephens
Due is historic.

00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:11.600
Because she took part in
the nation's first jail-in

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:13.480
which happened in 1960.

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:17.930
And she spent 49 days in
jail in Tallahassee Florida.

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:21.300

the Woolworth Lunch Counter.

an amazing family.

short horror film: Danger Word.

00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:44.800

to science fiction,
to the undefinable.

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:14.340
Her themes include resistance to
oppression, the inseverability

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:18.790
of the liminal, and the
coolness of stuff blowing up.

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:20.090

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:38.400
&gt;&gt; Sheree Renee Thomas: So our
conversation today is going

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:40.140
to be about a field of work

00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:42.510
which seems new to
lots of people.

00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:46.950
But has been evolving since,
basically since we've come

00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:49.090
through the Middle Passage.

00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:51.220
Since we, I mean,
literally it has.

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:55.650
[Laughter] It's a part of, it's
a body of work that has come

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:58.220
out of colonialism,

00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:01.050
post-colonialism,
neo-colonialism.

00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:07.070
As well as in the African
American experience of slavery.

00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:10.320
And it is now a, a body of work

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:12.320
that have evolved
around the world.

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:15.460
It is global in its
conversation.

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:16.910
It takes on many, many forms.

00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:19.430
I think of it as
a moveable feast.

00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:21.100
A moveable feast in
which there are lots

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:23.360
of different afrofutures.

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:26.050
And one of the things I
would love for us to talk

00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:30.930
about today is what is each
author's experience of the word?

00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:34.420
Because I wouldn't assume that
everyone embraces it equally.

00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:37.510
Because there are a lot
of spaces it covers.

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:41.210
And in some spaces that it
leaves, unseen and invisible.

00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:42.890
That we still have to explore.

00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:45.160
So we just want to take each
author and have a chance

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:48.800
to describe what Afrofuturism
is or is not to them.

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:52.380
&gt;&gt; Would you like me to start?

00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:55.140
I view Afrofuturism, borrowing

00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:59.800
from Alandrine Nelson's
essay some time ago.

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:04.050
Where she talked about the
ontology of multiplicity.

00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:08.370
And I believe that as we
kind of consider afrofutures,

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:12.880
the black body, both
in present-future-past.

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:15.730
We have to consider
the ways in which we

00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:20.340
as authors can make the
space/time continuum collapse.

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:23.360
How we can look back,
look forward,

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:25.290
and be present at the same time.

00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:28.050
And I'm very interested in
that inside almost any text.

00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:29.350
It doesn't have to be poetry.

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:32.290
Any test, prose, poetry.

00:14:32.290 --> 00:14:38.120
How do we think about
identity as something

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:43.040
that dissolves rather than
something that hardens?

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:47.620
And Afrofuturism at least for
me allows that opportunity,

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:49.850
the opportunity to
be many and one.

00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:52.650
The opportunity to
be forward and back.

00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:55.550
And also the opportunity
to think about,

00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:57.400
at least my person, myself.

00:14:57.400 --> 00:15:01.170
As something other
than what currently is.

00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:06.110
The imagination as a powerful
force in, in oppression

00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:09.500
which is what the black
experience in America has been.

00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:15.570
&gt;&gt; That was beautiful.

00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:21.680
[Laughter] Wow .I'm thinking a
lot about how I use Afrofuturism

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:26.240
in terms of processing
trauma as a horror writer.

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:28.040
And that's something
I got from my mother.

00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:29.930
So I co-signed to all of that.

00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:31.230
So beautifully spoken.

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:33.210
Yes, that is true.

00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:41.800
That piece of it that most
attracts me is how to take evil

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:43.280
for lack of a better term.

00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:46.000
Interpret evil however you may.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.410
[Laughter] It's very
tempting as we're sitting here

00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:51.620
in Washington, D.C. to be
very specific about it.

00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:53.100
But interpret it as you may.

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:56.130
But how to take evil
though and, and create sort

00:15:56.130 --> 00:15:59.550
of a fun house, mirror-image
of it.

00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:02.400
That is not the thing itself.

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:05.820
But a visual or written
expression of a thing

00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:08.570
that is frightening
or frightful.

00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:11.940
And creating survivors,
you know?

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:13.770
I think of Octavia
Butler's work,

00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:16.700
and her work is not
largely considered horror.

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:19.020
And your work, you know.

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:21.260
There are -- bad
things happen to people.

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:25.950
It's not considered horror,
but there are lessons.

00:16:25.950 --> 00:16:27.490
Even in that trauma.

00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:29.310
As we watch characters
undergo trauma.

00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:32.150
It helps us perhaps
[inaudible] our trauma.

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:34.140
And you mentioned my
mother, Sheree, you know.

00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:37.640
She wore dark glasses her whole
life after she was tear-gassed

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:40.170
in 1960 during a
non-violent march.

00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:44.370
And she was the first
horror-lover in my life.

00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:46.530
So I've really learned,
as I've gotten older

00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:48.790
and my trauma was losing her.

00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:52.290
So I've really learned as
I've gotten older to see

00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:55.560
that aspect of Afrofuturism.

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:58.180
The aspect of it
that's in the shadows.

00:16:58.180 --> 00:17:01.190
That's poking in the spaces
in the basement, right?

00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:03.950
The things that are frightening
that you don't want to look at.

00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:06.800
That aspect has been
very healing for me.

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:09.520
And hopefully is for others.

00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:12.270
But I really want to echo
this idea of a conversation

00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:14.400
between the past,
present, and future.

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:17.050
Because that's also something
that's very deeply woven

00:17:17.050 --> 00:17:22.170
within the way I address
trauma in my work.

00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:26.980
&gt;&gt; I am painfully
aware, all of a sudden.

00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:28.700
I am the only non-academic
up here.

00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:32.730
So I don't have anything
super-eloquent to say

00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:34.890
about ontologies and so on.

00:17:34.890 --> 00:17:36.710
I'm not even really
sure what that is.

00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:42.470
[Laughter] But, but as, I
guess as a practitioner.

00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:45.460
Which all of us are.

00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:48.120
Which, which everyone who
is living and surviving

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:52.230
in this country today is a
contributor to Afrofuturism.

00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:56.890
I don't sort of traffic
in labels and names.

00:17:56.890 --> 00:18:00.300
That, for me is a
thing of academics.

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:02.030
I write what I write.

00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:04.320
People put whatever label
onto that they want.

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:06.550
And that has happened
throughout my life.

00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:07.930
And sometimes I don't
like those labels,

00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:12.400
and sometimes I just
kind of go with it.

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:15.500
So to me, Afrofuturism as I grew

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:19.400
up with it was music,
was visual.

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:22.080
Was, were things
experienced with the senses.

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:24.720
It was not so much,
there were things

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:27.730
that impacted your
thoughts through visuals

00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:30.470
and through, through ideas.

00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:34.460
But not so much kind of
like directly engaging

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:35.760
with the future.

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:40.220
Not so much directly, a
story set in another world,

00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:43.360
another past, another
life that could have been.

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:46.270
Parliament Funkadelic
was Afrofuturism.

00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:49.690
Brother From Another Planet.

00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:52.520
These days [inaudible]
is Afrofuturism to me.

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:55.580
I'm still coming to
a place of acceptance

00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:59.190
that now Afrofuturism
is texted, is textual.

00:18:59.190 --> 00:19:02.740
And I am, I am not
really 100% there yet.

00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:05.360
Because for me, there's,
there's certain power

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:07.420
in visuals and imagery.

00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:10.170
That I, I know that text can do.

00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:14.310
Since I am not a person
who visualizes my own text.

00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:17.720
It's hard for me to put
those things together.

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:22.170
So, you know I'm,
I'm accepting it.

00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:25.340
I'm slowly going to
do so at some point.

00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:26.860
Not there yet.

00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:30.600
But I am also deeply and
painfully mindful of the fact

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:35.870
that once a word reaches Library
of Congress-level mainstream.

00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:40.250
At that point, that word
has transformed beyond its

00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:42.320
intention, its original
intention.

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:44.310
And maybe is no longer
a useful word.

00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:50.370
So you know because I will
share a simple anecdote.

00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:53.320
Of I got a call from
a production company

00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:55.000
that was interested
in my writing.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:00.180
Something Afrofuturistic,
they said, for, for some film

00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:01.830
that they were going
to do or something.

00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:04.340
And first off then I was like,
"I don't write screenplays.

00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:06.910
I don't know why you called me."

00:20:06.910 --> 00:20:10.230
But anyway, so they,
they asked me to do this.

00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:13.000
And then I was like
well, so what,

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.940
what kind of topic were
you thinking about here?

00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:17.240
And they were like, "Well,
we want something set

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:18.770
in Africa in the future."

00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:25.120
[Laughter] And I was like, well,
I've never even visited Africa.

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:30.330
So maybe you might want to find
someone else who's from there.

00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:33.210
You know, there are lots of
writers out there from many

00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:34.520
of the countries in Africa.

00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:36.060
You might want to have
a conversation with them

00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:38.690
about what they would
con-- consider doing.

00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:42.390
But to them, Afrofuturism
was this incredibly limiting

00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:47.350
and super narrow lane that
they wanted me to stay in.

00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:49.770
And I don't drive in that lane.

00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:51.070
I've never been there.

00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:54.080
So, so I'm mindful of the fact

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:55.490
that maybe we should
start looking

00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:57.090
for the next word to come.

00:20:57.090 --> 00:20:58.790
Maybe Afrofuturism
is not the word

00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:02.060
that we should be
trafficking in anymore.

00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:06.340
But for now, I'll take it.

00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:07.640
&gt;&gt; Sheree Renee Thomas: It's
so interesting that you talk

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:10.100
about music and other
forms, performing arts,

00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:13.320
visual arts as being
your initial experiences

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:14.620
with Afrofuturism.

00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:16.790
And how that's really
been a journey for you,

00:21:16.790 --> 00:21:20.310
about text work as Afrofuturism.

00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:21.960
I would say the same
for me as well.

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:25.910
I think one of my earliest
experiences with music as well.

00:21:25.910 --> 00:21:27.660
That I would think
of as Afrofuturism

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:29.740
of course was George Clinton,

00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:33.110
Parliament funk,
all of those things.

00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:36.690
As well as Alice Coltrane and
John Coltrane, their music.

00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:38.930
Sun Ra, of course,
being from the South.

00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:40.230
Was very fascinating to me.

00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:43.630
How does a man, you know
from the Deep South.

00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:46.390
The Bible Belt reimagines
himself

00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:49.530
as an Egyptian god of some sort?

00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:53.620
An alien that's come
to, to the planet.

00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:58.120
When we think about the
experience, the experiences

00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:03.040
with an S, of being black on
the planet, wherever that is.

00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:06.360
Whether it's in the America
or on the continent of Africa

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:08.770
or in, in numerous
places of the,

00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:11.130
other parts of the diaspora.

00:22:11.130 --> 00:22:15.420
You realize that you're
already in a dystopic reality.

00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:17.860
You are already a part of that.

00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:20.020
You know, [inaudible] a
black [inaudible] who wrote

00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:22.840
about this deeply
in the nineties.

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:26.190
Talked about the first
ships, the first contact,

00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:28.700
close encounter story was of.

00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:31.400
You know us being taken
from our home in Africa.

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:34.370
And being brought to this other
place for a whole other context.

00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:37.820
And it's sort of an
alien UFO experience.

00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:40.260
And how do you, how do
you write about that.

00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:44.950
Airea, I know that you have
been writing poems in the voices

00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:46.940
of Egyptian goddesses.

00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:48.240
You know, how did you come

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:50.590
to write your Sekhmet,
Sekhmet poems?

00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:53.070
Talk about that.

00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:54.370
&gt;&gt; Airea D. Matthews:
Sekhmet came

00:22:54.370 --> 00:22:56.390
to me actually as I was trying.

00:22:56.390 --> 00:23:00.230
I'm interested in visitations,
like spiritual visitations

00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:01.650
from other things that are.

00:23:01.650 --> 00:23:03.020
May not be in this dimension.

00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:04.410
I know that sounds odd.

00:23:04.410 --> 00:23:05.710
But I'm open to it just,

00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:07.380
if it gets to the
writing, I'm open to it.

00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:10.130
So Ann Sexton makes
a show in the,

00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:12.350
in the book as does Sekhmet.

00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:17.060
And I was interested
in what they might have

00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:19.030
to say about the subject.

00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:21.170
As whatever I was
writing about at the time.

00:23:21.170 --> 00:23:25.390
So Sekhmet I'm writing
about addiction.

00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:30.460
And so Sekhmet makes a show
because Sekhmet, they gave her.

00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:33.740
She was going to
destroy a whole army.

00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:37.360
And then these kind of male
gods came forward and like.

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:39.730
"Maybe you can just
give her some liquor."

00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:41.950
They gave her some wine,
thinking and had her believe

00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:43.450
that it was blood
that she was drinking.

00:23:43.450 --> 00:23:45.000
And that would kind
of calm her down.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.670
And she would move away
from wanting to destroy.

00:23:47.670 --> 00:23:50.580
And I just kind of thought
about all the ways that we try

00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:55.130
to calm, try to calm
our natural natures.

00:23:55.130 --> 00:23:59.130
Try to house our natural
natures inside of something

00:23:59.130 --> 00:24:01.240
that is not what we want.

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:03.010
So someone offers you something

00:24:03.010 --> 00:24:06.010
that is not exactly what you
want, but you take it anyway.

00:24:06.010 --> 00:24:07.720
And so Sekhmet came
to fore for me.

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:10.380
I started thinking about what it
is that she had to go through.

00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:12.780
How she, she was probably.

00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:17.730
They have documented in
myth that she drank a lot.

00:24:17.730 --> 00:24:21.160
And so as did her revelers
and her worshippers.

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:22.990
And so I was interested in that,

00:24:22.990 --> 00:24:24.590
and how do you get
that story out?

00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:26.510
We have convenient myths.

00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:28.240
There are things
we want to remember

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:30.940
about these mythologies
that we follow.

00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:34.150
But we don't actually
get down to the root

00:24:34.150 --> 00:24:35.570
of the story of the myth.

00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:38.240
Like what was the very
human nature of the god?

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:42.430
What was the very human nature
of the entity that makes itself,

00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:44.230
[inaudible] itself in
any kind of mythology.

00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:47.920
Whether it's Greek mythology
or if it's Egyptian mythology.

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:51.360
They're told in, in order

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:53.910
to give us some sort
of lesson from it.

00:24:53.910 --> 00:24:55.820
And we can't get to
the lesson until we get

00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:58.480
to the humanity of
the god itself.

00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:00.690
And so I try to drive for that.

00:25:00.690 --> 00:25:03.940
And I'm interested in
all sorts of mythology.

00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:08.940
But Egyptian mythology does
come to the forefront for me.

00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:11.100
Primarily because
those aren't the myths

00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:13.940
that are typically
told in the West.

00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:15.240
We don't know those myths.

00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:16.730
We know Zeus and Hera.

00:25:16.730 --> 00:25:19.250
But we don't know
about Sekhmet and Ra.

00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:20.600
And why is that?

00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:23.030
So I write about
them because I care.

00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:26.430
I'm trying to make those come
forward a little bit more

00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:27.730
in the work.

00:25:27.730 --> 00:25:29.820
Than have them recede
to the background.

00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:32.620
&gt;&gt; Sheree Renee Thomas: I know
during the Black Arts movement,

00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:37.260
there was a conscious,
deliberate effort by artists,

00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:41.260
[inaudible], Ishmael
Reeve, Sonia Sanchez.

00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:45.440
Other artists like Alice Walker,
to go back and reclaim some

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:46.810
of the mythologies of the world.

00:25:46.810 --> 00:25:48.750
And also tell our folk tales.

00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:50.050
Our stories as well.

00:25:50.050 --> 00:25:53.530
And give them the same type
of seriousness that Greek

00:25:53.530 --> 00:25:56.140
and Roman mythology
had been taken.

00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:59.950
Would you say that this effort
that, that's happening now.

00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:01.860
That we're seeing, in the body

00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:03.280
of work we're calling
Afrofuturism.

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:04.580
For want of other
words, [laughter].

00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:08.400
Is also a continuation of that?

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:11.690
But it's almost like a
[inaudible] experience.

00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:13.070
Where you're looking.

00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:14.970
You're trying to understand
where we are right now.

00:26:14.970 --> 00:26:17.230
By looking at that
past and claiming it.

00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:19.950
To talk about where we possibly
want to go for the future?

00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:21.250
&gt;&gt; Airea D. Matthews
: Absolutely.

00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:23.180
I mean, and the other thing
that I think people tend to look

00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:26.030
for is they try to look
for representation.

00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:28.430
I think it's important
to have representation.

00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:31.140
And if you can find those
African mythologies,

00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:33.650
or the African philosophies
that cater

00:26:33.650 --> 00:26:36.070
to what it is you're
interested in writing about.

00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:38.520
You can see a mirror
in some way.

00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:39.900
What you were talking
about earlier,

00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:41.200
earlier with the mirror.

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:43.800
How important it is to see some
sort of reflection of yourself.

00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:45.380
I could see a reflection

00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:47.360
of myself inside of
the Egyptian myth.

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:49.940
I don't necessarily
see a reflection

00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:51.580
of myself inside of other myths.

00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:53.650
I see other people
inside those myths.

00:26:53.650 --> 00:26:57.040
But they always feel
outside of my experience.

00:26:57.040 --> 00:27:01.160
I do try and dig a little
deeper and find where I can.

00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:04.230
The myths that are
important to me.

00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:06.600
And representative of who I am.

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:09.300
And what I happen to be
writing about at the moment.

00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:11.190
So yeah, I do believe
that's important.

00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:12.520
&gt;&gt; Sheree Renee Thomas: When
I was looking at your work.

00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:17.570
I was reminded of Audre Lorde's
work a bit, The Black Unicorn.

00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:18.870
The Black Unicorn.

00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:22.500
I was thinking like what other
speculative poetry tradition do

00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:23.800
we have?

00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:26.590
You know what other poets are
writing these kinds of works?

00:27:26.590 --> 00:27:30.440
Thinking of Robert
Hayden's American Journal.

00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:35.150
Or even some early poems by
Countee Cullen, whatever.

00:27:35.150 --> 00:27:37.510
Then I'm also thinking of
maybe Phillis Wheatley,

00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:40.840
like the whole ideal of
imagining yourself free.

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:42.470
Or imagining yourself outside

00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:45.520
of a white supremacist
culture in itself.

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:48.020
Is an act of futurism.

00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:51.460
You are, it's an
optimistic hopeful act,

00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:54.910
as well as a creative
act as well.

00:27:54.910 --> 00:27:57.480
Nora, in your work,
you have decided

00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:00.710
to create your own gods
and to critique them.

00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:03.610
To, to really expose them
as, as Airea was saying,

00:28:03.610 --> 00:28:05.260
the human parts of them.

00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:06.970
To make that real for readers.

00:28:06.970 --> 00:28:09.920
Can you talk a little about what
your journey was coming to-- .

00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:13.360
How did you come to,
to building that work?

00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:15.080
And I know you have a new,
she has a new collection

00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:18.420
that she hasn't, we
haven't talk about.

00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:20.090
&gt;&gt; N.K. Jemisin: Well, I
mean, a lot of the stuff

00:28:20.090 --> 00:28:24.170
in the collection is, is
protoforms of the novels that.

00:28:24.170 --> 00:28:27.210
[Inaudible] Yeah,
the collection, my,

00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:30.770
my latest thing that's just
come out is a collection

00:28:30.770 --> 00:28:33.290
of short stories called How
Long Until Black Future Month?

00:28:33.290 --> 00:28:35.040
Thank you for the show-and-tell.

00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:38.490
&gt;&gt; It has such a
great cover, too.

00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:39.890
&gt;&gt; N.K. Jemisin: Yeah, it does.

00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:43.330
With the cover image is made
by Creative Soul Photography.

00:28:43.330 --> 00:28:49.350
The guys who did the series
of black Victorians that ran.

00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:51.520
They're an Atlanta-based
photography group.

00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:55.370
It's kind of awesome stuff.

00:28:55.370 --> 00:28:56.670
Anyway though.

00:28:56.670 --> 00:29:01.130
So the, the journey that I
came to write my own gods.

00:29:01.130 --> 00:29:03.530
Was probably similar
to what you were doing.

00:29:03.530 --> 00:29:07.830
Because I was enamored of
mythologies in general.

00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:12.070
All mythologies kind of beyond
what I was taught in school.

00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:14.690
Which was just sort of
basically Christian.

00:29:14.690 --> 00:29:16.620
Which is, has its
own mythos form.

00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:19.910
Although we didn't learn
too deep into that.

00:29:19.910 --> 00:29:23.100
We, I grew up, I was
educated in Alabama.

00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:25.610
So we got the Protestant flavor.

00:29:25.610 --> 00:29:27.890
That we did not get a
whole lot of Catholicism,

00:29:27.890 --> 00:29:30.740
Judaism, or any of that.

00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:34.130
But so and, and Greco-Roman.

00:29:34.130 --> 00:29:38.310
And so for fun, I read
mythology as a kid.

00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:39.900
I read about the Egyptian gods.

00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:43.360
I read about American,
Native American,

00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:45.460
indigenous people's gods.

00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:48.980
And the thing that always
fascinated me was the ways

00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:53.360
in which gods reflect humanity.

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:56.160
And, and hold up a
mirror to humanity.

00:29:56.160 --> 00:30:01.030
There was a mythic
tradition there of using god,

00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:02.950
you know to explore yourself.

00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:06.970
And that was a thing that I
was just kind of fascinated by.

00:30:06.970 --> 00:30:13.680
And the ways in which those
mythic traditions impact people.

00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:16.830
What you can imagine
is what you can become.

00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:19.470
And so, in order to
imagine new worlds.

00:30:19.470 --> 00:30:22.220
If I'm writing things set
in worlds other than earth.

00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:25.920
I've got to reimagine what those
people are capable of imagining.

00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:28.210
And so you know you
end up kind of writing

00:30:28.210 --> 00:30:29.510
about imagination itself.

00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:31.330
By literalizing it that way.

00:30:31.330 --> 00:30:34.840
I don't know if that
answered your question.

00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:36.140
&gt;&gt; Sheree Renee Thomas:
Yes, it does.

00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:40.560
[Laughs] Because the whole act
of, of science fiction, fantasy,

00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:42.690
horror is world building.

00:30:42.690 --> 00:30:44.580
The creation is asking what if?

00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:45.880
All writers ask what if.

00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:48.660
But in our genre, we get to
play with the answers more.

00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:50.870
Do a lot more.

00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:53.690
Tananarive, can you talk
a little bit more about.

00:30:53.690 --> 00:30:54.990
I will say this.

00:30:54.990 --> 00:30:57.380
My very first introduction
to Tananarive's books was

00:30:57.380 --> 00:30:59.660
when I was working
with Cheryl Woodruff,

00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:01.460
an editor at Random House.

00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:03.280
And she knew I liked
the scary stuff.

00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:06.010
And she said, "You like that
dark, scary stuff, Sheree."

00:31:06.010 --> 00:31:09.380
So she pulled out your
novel, The Between.

00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:11.720
Which is her very first novel.

00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:13.020
And I was blown away.

00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:14.550
One, because it was Southern.

00:31:14.550 --> 00:31:17.490
Two, you weren't just
telling a ghost story.

00:31:17.490 --> 00:31:21.740
But you were telling a story,
it seemed, about our people.

00:31:21.740 --> 00:31:25.790
About what it means to be
the spectre in society.

00:31:25.790 --> 00:31:27.590
And to have those
shadows haunt you.

00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:31.510
To be haunted by that, and
people think that you're crazy.

00:31:31.510 --> 00:31:32.960
Because you one, can see them.

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:35.730
And two, you are
fighting them, you know?

00:31:35.730 --> 00:31:38.440
And I wanted you to talk
a little bit about horror

00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:42.480
and this, this, this experiment
that we're doing here.

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:47.160
Right now, living in the
age that we're living in.

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:48.850
&gt;&gt; Tananarive Due: Yeah, right.

00:31:48.850 --> 00:31:53.950
Whew! Where do I begin?

00:31:53.950 --> 00:31:56.830
But I want to go
first to that question

00:31:56.830 --> 00:31:59.020
of world building
and what that means.

00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:03.660
And especially when you can
sort of see so much fraying

00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:05.660
and so much crumbling.

00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:07.530
Right before your eyes.

00:32:07.530 --> 00:32:10.620
The idea of world
building becomes

00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:13.000
so much more literal
and important.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.020
And there's this idea that you
want people to read your work

00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:17.780
and then put it down
and do something, right?

00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:21.430
I mean, it's not that there's
anything prescribed in the work.

00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:24.060
It's like how do we,
how do we do this?

00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:28.280
So for me, a lot of
that, you know self-care.

00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:30.300
Or really world building
begins with self-care.

00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:31.800
Let me put it that way.

00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:35.700
My parents' civil rights
generation taught me,

00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:37.000
looking at their friends.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.840
The people who are my
parents' peers from the 1960s.

00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:43.550
So many of them were burned
out, were traumatized.

00:32:43.550 --> 00:32:46.290
When we wrote that civil rights
memoir, it was hard to get some

00:32:46.290 --> 00:32:47.590
of them to even talk about it.

00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:50.190
They hadn't told their
families they were arrested.

00:32:50.190 --> 00:32:52.370
One woman who was in
Mississippi with my dad,

00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:54.900
at night he still reminisces
about almost cheerfully.

00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:56.980
She never went back.

00:32:56.980 --> 00:32:59.690
You know, so different people
had different experiences.

00:32:59.690 --> 00:33:04.610
And I began to realize, you know
this is like PTSD, you know?

00:33:04.610 --> 00:33:07.220
This was like, these
were veterans of a war.

00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:10.490
But it was an unspoken war,
and it was happening right here

00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:13.450
in your own country,
supposedly, right?

00:33:13.450 --> 00:33:15.250
Unaddressed.

00:33:15.250 --> 00:33:21.910
So yes, I think she did bequeath
to me sort of this sick delight

00:33:21.910 --> 00:33:25.580
from creating stories
that scare people.

00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:26.880
I mean, I love, when
people tell me.

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:28.180
"Oh! I read your book.

00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:29.480
I couldn't sleep!"

00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:30.780
I'm like, yes!

00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:32.080
[ Laughter ]

00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:33.850
Join the club!

00:33:33.850 --> 00:33:35.270
No. Pardon me.

00:33:35.270 --> 00:33:40.680
But I do think it's not just
you know being mischievous.

00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:44.390
I think there's, there's
actual value in it.

00:33:44.390 --> 00:33:45.820
Not everyone has to like horror.

00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:47.770
Okay, I totally get it if-- .

00:33:47.770 --> 00:33:49.070
I like comedy too.

00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:50.510
Sometimes comedy is your way.

00:33:50.510 --> 00:33:51.940
Just release it through a laugh.

00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:53.240
I have to laugh every day.

00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:54.880
I listen to stand-up every day.

00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:59.330
But I also like one
great example.

00:33:59.330 --> 00:34:01.070
There's this great novelette

00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:02.850
by a writer named
Kai Ashante Wilson,

00:34:02.850 --> 00:34:04.490
called The Devil in America.

00:34:04.490 --> 00:34:06.090
If you haven't read
it, go read it now.

00:34:06.090 --> 00:34:07.390
It's free, it's online.

00:34:07.390 --> 00:34:08.690
The Devil in America.

00:34:08.690 --> 00:34:09.990
&gt;&gt; It's on Tour.com.

00:34:09.990 --> 00:34:11.300
&gt;&gt; Tananarive Due: Tour.com.

00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:13.870
It is scary as heck.

00:34:13.870 --> 00:34:17.060
And what makes it scary
is American history.

00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:19.220
And what I said in this
documentary, Horror Noire,

00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:21.950
is black history is
black horror, okay?

00:34:21.950 --> 00:34:23.250
I mean, not exclusively.

00:34:23.250 --> 00:34:24.550
We've had triumphs.

00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:28.690
We've been able to MacGyver
beauty out of scraps, you know?

00:34:28.690 --> 00:34:33.030
The spiritual-- Linea Denise
was the first person who woke me

00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:34.330
up to this idea of the,

00:34:34.330 --> 00:34:36.930
the slave spirituals
as Afrofuturism.

00:34:36.930 --> 00:34:38.230
Like you were saying.

00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:40.020
It's like yes, utopianism.

00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:42.340
Picturing something
better, and a road map.

00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:46.620
So okay, we can both fantasize
about something that isn't real.

00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:50.520
But also draw a road map
for something that is real.

00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:55.000
And with horror, if
you can heal yourself

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.860
by visualizing that trauma.

00:34:56.860 --> 00:34:59.510
Kai Ashante Wilson did it in
his way in The Devil in America.

00:34:59.510 --> 00:35:00.810
It doesn't make sense.

00:35:00.810 --> 00:35:03.700
It doesn't make sense that
someone would go into a church

00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:05.290
and shoot nine people to death.

00:35:05.290 --> 00:35:06.680
Nine strangers.

00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:09.330
I cannot wrap my
mind around that.

00:35:09.330 --> 00:35:12.080
But I can wrap my
mind around a demon.

00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:14.620
I can wrap my mind
around a curse.

00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:17.260
And I can vanquish
that demon maybe.

00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:20.170
Maybe that demon
has rules, okay?

00:35:20.170 --> 00:35:24.360
And even if I can't, I
can create a character

00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:26.580
who shows me how to walk.

00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:28.410
When I'm facing a demon,

00:35:28.410 --> 00:35:31.040
whatever version of
my demon will be.

00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:33.410
So I think that's what
attracts me to horror.

00:35:33.410 --> 00:35:35.390
And I think that's
the value of it.

00:35:35.390 --> 00:35:37.520
And I very much do like to weave

00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:40.820
in those horrific aspects
of American history.

00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:42.320
So people can first
of all, look.

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:45.080
This happened, you know
because so often now.

00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:47.380
We're, we're having
this cultural amnesia

00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:49.470
where people don't remember.

00:35:49.470 --> 00:35:51.220
When I was a child, the
whole country stood still,

00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:52.830
and we watched Roots
as a miniseries.

00:35:52.830 --> 00:35:54.990
I can't even imagine that today.

00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:58.080
So yeah, this happened.

00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:01.290
But also, this is how you fight.

00:36:01.290 --> 00:36:04.210
&gt;&gt; Sheree Renee Thomas: Wow,
so much to unpack in there.

00:36:04.210 --> 00:36:05.830
You have all those
amazing references toward

00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:07.130
that common course.

00:36:07.130 --> 00:36:10.170
Where lots of wonderful
writers are being published.

00:36:10.170 --> 00:36:11.470
Online is absolutely free.

00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:13.630
So definitely check
those works out.

00:36:13.630 --> 00:36:16.890
But also this idea about
demons being vanquished.

00:36:16.890 --> 00:36:19.100
This you know horror
encapsulating the things

00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:21.210
that we're afraid
of in our culture.

00:36:21.210 --> 00:36:23.420
Horror, whether it's
zombies or whatever.

00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:24.720
What is that really about?

00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:26.240
You know, is it a
fear of homelessness?

00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:30.010
Is it a fear of biological
disease

00:36:30.010 --> 00:36:31.620
that is becomes epidemic?

00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:33.870
Is it afraid, is it a fear

00:36:33.870 --> 00:36:36.590
of the underclasses taking
power, taking control?

00:36:36.590 --> 00:36:38.790
&gt;&gt; See, that's what I think.

00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:41.090
I think, I start to
look at zombies now

00:36:41.090 --> 00:36:42.690
as like that fear of other.

00:36:42.690 --> 00:36:43.990
&gt;&gt; Sheree Renee Thomas:
That fear of other.

00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:49.040
There's a beautiful quote,
actually that Nora had.

00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:50.500
And you talked about--

00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:51.800
let me see if I can find it

00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:55.860
in my zillion notes
I wrote for this.

00:36:55.860 --> 00:37:01.960
This idea of why, why you write.

00:37:05.090 --> 00:37:10.820
And this, this idea of what
it's supposed to be doing.

00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:13.970
"So here is why I
write what I do.

00:37:13.970 --> 00:37:16.000
We all have futures.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.300
We all have pasts.

00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:18.600
We all have stories.

00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:21.810
And we all, every single one
of us, no matter who we are.

00:37:21.810 --> 00:37:23.670
And no matter what's
been taken from us.

00:37:23.670 --> 00:37:25.610
Or what poison we've
internalized.

00:37:25.610 --> 00:37:28.800
Or how hard we've had
to work to expel it.

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:30.200
We all get to dream."

00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:33.620
And when you're writing
about these things.

00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:36.800
Whether it's science
fiction, fantasy, horror.

00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:40.380
Or whether it's in, you
know story, a novel, a poem.

00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:42.750
You are re-dreaming the world.

00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:44.050
You are looking at in.

00:37:44.050 --> 00:37:46.010
but in order to re-dream
it, you have to gaze

00:37:46.010 --> 00:37:47.910
at it with [inaudible].

00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:50.290
You have to really
tell the truth.

00:37:50.290 --> 00:37:53.010
And what I love about these
writers here is that they,

00:37:53.010 --> 00:37:56.340
they have all this
truth-telling in their art.

00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:59.010
They don't shy away
from the hard work.

00:37:59.010 --> 00:38:01.220
Of telling the stories
of that past generation

00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:02.520
that was broken up.

00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:05.010
They, they, they sacrificed
all of this to be activists.

00:38:05.010 --> 00:38:07.040
To, to try to make present,

00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:08.780
to be the change in
the world, right?

00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:10.240
And then they were spit down on.

00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:12.060
And then they, dogs
were sicced on them

00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:14.540
and their bodies were broken,
and their vision was damaged.

00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:15.860
And some of them
lost their lives.

00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:18.490
I'm from Memphis, so we're
constantly, you know,

00:38:18.490 --> 00:38:22.660
reliving that wound of Dr.
King's murder, you know?

00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:26.720
But this ideal, out of
all that, that fear.

00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:28.020
All of that trauma.

00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:30.620
Whether it's Trayvon
Martin or Sandra Bland.

00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:34.400
We can re-dream of what
the world should look like.

00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:37.590
And how, as you say, how
we might walk that walk.

00:38:37.590 --> 00:38:39.900
You know? How we might model.

00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:42.000
Even if we fall down.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.480
Can you all talk a little bit
about what you do as artists

00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:50.150
to sustain yourselves in
the falling-down process?

00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:51.450
You know sometimes

00:38:51.450 --> 00:38:55.450
on the outside we see
the beautiful books, the,

00:38:55.450 --> 00:38:57.180
the beautiful covers
and everything.

00:38:57.180 --> 00:39:00.520
And it seems a crystal stair
of an experience for an artist.

00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:02.560
But there's a lot of
darkness in that, too.

00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:04.690
How do you take care
of yourself?

00:39:04.690 --> 00:39:05.990
How do you sustain?

00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:07.290
What are the models?

00:39:07.290 --> 00:39:11.160
How do you build community?

00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:13.140
&gt;&gt; This is the thing I've
been struggling with.

00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:18.890
So I will, I will share the fact
that that is a struggle for me.

00:39:18.890 --> 00:39:24.570
My writing is the means
through which I process all

00:39:24.570 --> 00:39:27.050
that I'm experiencing.

00:39:27.050 --> 00:39:30.450
You know I, I have this
really vivid memory

00:39:30.450 --> 00:39:32.280
of a really hot summer day.

00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:37.040
While I was working
on The Fifth Season.

00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:40.780
And I was reading Twitter
where Ferguson was happening.

00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:46.370
And it was the pictures of
the young man facing a troop

00:39:46.370 --> 00:39:48.420
of American-- they were cops.

00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:50.120
But they looked like soldiers.

00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:51.570
And they were wearing
body armor.

00:39:51.570 --> 00:39:53.350
And they were carrying
uzzis or something.

00:39:53.350 --> 00:39:56.940
And it was just some guy in a
t-shirt that they were facing.

00:39:56.940 --> 00:39:58.990
But they were treating him like,

00:39:58.990 --> 00:40:01.190
like he was the biggest
threat in the world.

00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:03.820
Because he was a black man.

00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:06.790
And, and I remember seeing this.

00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:10.500
And around the same time,
the whole report was coming

00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:14.750
out that the city of Ferguson
had basically been preying

00:40:14.750 --> 00:40:19.010
on its majority black
population for the longest time.

00:40:19.010 --> 00:40:23.090
You know sucking money out of
them, and giving tax breaks

00:40:23.090 --> 00:40:25.630
to its middle class
white population.

00:40:25.630 --> 00:40:28.910
And, and had built an
entire industry around this.

00:40:28.910 --> 00:40:30.610
And you know it just
kind of hit me.

00:40:30.610 --> 00:40:33.470
That this is what, this
is what it's all been.

00:40:33.470 --> 00:40:35.220
This is really what
it's all been.

00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:38.400
We exist in their eyes
anyway to be soaked.

00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:39.700
To be used.

00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:41.430
To be discarded.

00:40:41.430 --> 00:40:44.370
And I just had this
utter, utter rage.

00:40:44.370 --> 00:40:48.800
You know and as I'm writing
this story, you know the,

00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:50.250
the, the Broken Earth.

00:40:50.250 --> 00:40:52.220
I think started out being
a little bit more mild

00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:53.520
than it was.

00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:56.550
Then I was just like,
burned it down.

00:40:56.550 --> 00:40:58.330
And then I destroyed the planet.

00:40:58.330 --> 00:41:02.320
[Laughter] But you know
I mean, this is, this is,

00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:03.670
this is the catharsis.

00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:06.720
Is when you're writing
science fiction,

00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:09.270
you can smash the
moon into the planet.

00:41:09.270 --> 00:41:14.560
You can wipe out
humanity and, and it's.

00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:16.560
It is a form of therapy.

00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:22.520
[Laughter] And then of course
you remind yourself, no.

00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:25.460
You don't want all
of humanity to die.

00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:26.760
You remind yourself.

00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:31.350
You rewrite the scene
that you wrote.

00:41:31.350 --> 00:41:34.010
So that people do survive.

00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:35.940
So that's for me.

00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:38.880
&gt;&gt; You know, when, when
you mentioned Ferguson,

00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:42.730
I think of my first
moment of that realization.

00:41:42.730 --> 00:41:44.030
Like oh, wait.

00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:45.330
Black lives don't
matter, you know?

00:41:45.330 --> 00:41:51.250
I was about 14, and there was
a group of police officers

00:41:51.250 --> 00:41:53.620
who had been acquitted after
beating a motorcyclist to death.

00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:55.040
And then they tried
to cover it up.

00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:57.120
And pretend his motorcycle
had crashed

00:41:57.120 --> 00:41:59.080
and there was a big
journalism expose.

00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:03.030
But even with all that
couldn't get a conviction,

00:42:03.030 --> 00:42:04.470
and Miami burned.

00:42:04.470 --> 00:42:09.250
You know? And I was sitting in
my junior high school cafeteria.

00:42:09.250 --> 00:42:11.840
They were playing muzak
to try to calm us down.

00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:13.230
It was a tri-ethnic school.

00:42:13.230 --> 00:42:15.250
So really, it was
just making it worse.

00:42:15.250 --> 00:42:16.670
But anyway.

00:42:16.670 --> 00:42:17.970
[Laughter] I started
writing this

00:42:17.970 --> 00:42:19.660
like utopian sort of prose poem.

00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:20.960
You know I want to live.

00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:22.950
The first line was I
want to live in a society

00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:25.060
where Jew is no longer
a dirty word.

00:42:25.060 --> 00:42:27.130
No one remembers what
nigger used to mean.

00:42:27.130 --> 00:42:29.620
And I just went on
and on and on and on.

00:42:29.620 --> 00:42:31.350
And I could breathe.

00:42:31.350 --> 00:42:32.650
I could breathe.

00:42:32.650 --> 00:42:35.590
And my mother said, "You're
so lucky that you have that.

00:42:35.590 --> 00:42:37.510
That you have that writing."

00:42:37.510 --> 00:42:40.160
Because that's why,
because I had asked her why.

00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:41.780
But why, why are people burning?

00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:43.080
That's their own store.

00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:44.380
That's like, that's why.

00:42:44.380 --> 00:42:46.200
They're afraid first of all.

00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:48.240
But you know fear.

00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:49.830
Anger is a mask over fear.

00:42:49.830 --> 00:42:51.770
So, so there was that.

00:42:51.770 --> 00:42:53.630
And absolutely, it
is very powerful.

00:42:53.630 --> 00:42:55.430
Now I have to say, I've
been working on a novel

00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:56.750
in progress for about
five years.

00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:58.050
Which is a long time for me.

00:42:58.050 --> 00:43:00.700
And even with teaching,
there's no excuse for it.

00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:02.220
And mostly it has
to do with the fact

00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:04.100
that it's just a
difficult subject matter.

00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:09.110
You know sometimes that place,
your happy place gets invaded.

00:43:09.110 --> 00:43:11.600
And in this case, I
wanted very much to write

00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:14.640
about my mother's uncle.

00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:17.290
My great uncle who
died in reformatory

00:43:17.290 --> 00:43:21.240
in Florida called the Dozier
School for Boys in the 1930s.

00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:23.120
Right? And I visited the site.

00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:25.200
My son was there when they
were exhuming, you know?

00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:28.620
And he got to sift through
soil and discover things.

00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:30.410
And it was a real-- - .

00:43:30.410 --> 00:43:32.950
My mother never knew that
she had this uncle, right?

00:43:32.950 --> 00:43:34.660
And these, there were
so many boys who died

00:43:34.660 --> 00:43:37.980
at this reformatory that
it has its own cemetery.

00:43:37.980 --> 00:43:41.290
And actually Colson Whitehead
has a novel coming out about

00:43:41.290 --> 00:43:43.010
that reformatory
this, this July.

00:43:43.010 --> 00:43:45.340
Which I'm sure is wonderful.

00:43:45.340 --> 00:43:49.390
You know, it's like well
that, that's what you get.

00:43:49.390 --> 00:43:51.880
[Laughter] But I,
you know as much

00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:53.820
as I wanted to burn through it.

00:43:53.820 --> 00:43:55.690
I, the research made me cry.

00:43:55.690 --> 00:43:57.710
You know the survivors have
written books about it.

00:43:57.710 --> 00:43:59.330
I, I talked to survivors
on the phone.

00:43:59.330 --> 00:44:00.630
I went to meetings.

00:44:00.630 --> 00:44:03.330
It's like it's hard
sometimes to go

00:44:03.330 --> 00:44:05.430
where you want to take yourself.

00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:08.200
So yeah, sometimes in
terms of what do you do?

00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:09.500
What's the self-care?

00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:10.800
Stepping away.

00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:12.100
Writing a short story.

00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:13.400
I've written several.

00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:14.810
Writing a script.

00:44:14.810 --> 00:44:16.110
Just step away.

00:44:16.110 --> 00:44:19.250
But always remembering
to come back.

00:44:22.070 --> 00:44:25.750
&gt;&gt; For me, I think I
take cues from my kids.

00:44:25.750 --> 00:44:28.900
I have four children,
and the oldest is 20,

00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:30.200
the youngest is eight.

00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:31.680
And they have these rich,

00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:35.380
all four of them have these
very rich imaginations.

00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:39.990
And I take joy in stepping
inside of their world.

00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:42.500
When I feel that mine is
a little bit unbearable.

00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:45.420
And how do I do that?

00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:48.940
So I taught them
very, a long time ago,

00:44:48.940 --> 00:44:50.470
starting with my oldest.

00:44:50.470 --> 00:44:52.470
Whenever you have
problems with people,

00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:55.690
try to re-write their
narrative right where you are.

00:44:55.690 --> 00:44:57.600
It teaches empathy, actually.

00:44:57.600 --> 00:45:00.940
Like right where you are, try to
understand where that person is.

00:45:00.940 --> 00:45:02.330
It's a lot of work, right?

00:45:02.330 --> 00:45:03.780
But try to understand
where that person is.

00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:05.080
And re-write their narrative.

00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:08.390
So we used to practice doing
that by going to parks.

00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:11.360
And watching people who
were perfect strangers.

00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:14.010
Who were doing, either
doing things that were odd.

00:45:14.010 --> 00:45:16.820
Or doing things that
seemed slightly off,

00:45:16.820 --> 00:45:19.110
off center, if there
is a center.

00:45:19.110 --> 00:45:22.000
And I said, "Okay, let's
re-write their narrative."

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:23.940
So we just start
coming up with things.

00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:26.190
Retreating into our
imaginations about why

00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:29.000
that person may have done
the thing that they had done.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:34.010
And it trained them to always
view other people with empathy.

00:45:34.010 --> 00:45:36.610
But also get out of
our own narrative

00:45:36.610 --> 00:45:39.430
about what the person,
who that person is.

00:45:39.430 --> 00:45:41.960
And by doing that, that
actually helps me a lot.

00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:45.290
I rewrite people's
narratives all the time.

00:45:45.290 --> 00:45:51.730
I'm very interested in
imagining people with,

00:45:51.730 --> 00:45:53.920
with a lens toward empathy.

00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:55.280
With a lens towards trying

00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:58.560
to understand what makes
them do what they do.

00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:01.570
Particularly when
they hurt and offend.

00:46:01.570 --> 00:46:05.330
So that's one way that I do it
is I retreat to my imagination.

00:46:05.330 --> 00:46:09.370
But I also have become
increasingly aware

00:46:09.370 --> 00:46:11.690
of the merits of uncertainty.

00:46:11.690 --> 00:46:13.960
And just learning how
to live in uncertainty.

00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:19.160
So when I start a
poem, I don't know how

00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:20.810
that poem's going to end.

00:46:20.810 --> 00:46:22.110
I just don't.

00:46:22.110 --> 00:46:24.500
I just know that I'm writing
something toward an end.

00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:26.190
But I don't know how
it's going to end.

00:46:26.190 --> 00:46:29.730
And I've come to live and
be at one and at peace

00:46:29.730 --> 00:46:31.550
with that degree of uncertainty.

00:46:31.550 --> 00:46:33.930
The poem will figure out
where it wants to be,

00:46:33.930 --> 00:46:36.040
and I'm just along for the ride.

00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:40.200
And so I think once I started
doing those two practices

00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:41.500
with regularity.

00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:43.980
On not just my writing life,
but just my everyday life.

00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:45.740
There was a certain
calm that comes over me.

00:46:45.740 --> 00:46:50.450
That helps me care for myself,
and for other people as well.

00:46:50.450 --> 00:46:51.750
&gt;&gt; Sheree Renee Thomas: So
what we're hearing is part

00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:54.090
of this process sometimes
taking a break,

00:46:54.090 --> 00:46:56.960
stepping away, to
recenter yourself.

00:46:56.960 --> 00:47:00.180
Sometimes going, diving
into the work, creating it

00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:01.480
and doing that hard thing.

00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:02.780
Blowing up the planet.

00:47:02.780 --> 00:47:05.700
And then figuring out your
way, how to be compassionate

00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:09.420
and loving and optimistic about
it all over again, you know.

00:47:09.420 --> 00:47:12.410
And then also, just being
a witness as well, right?

00:47:12.410 --> 00:47:16.560
Being a witness and
observing as my friend, poet,

00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:18.530
editor [inaudible] Harris says.

00:47:18.530 --> 00:47:19.940
Those "experiments of joy."

00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:22.840
Watching the experiments of
joy that are taking place all

00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:25.520
around us at the
same time, you know?

00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:26.820
That's part of it, too.

00:47:26.820 --> 00:47:28.430
All of that's in the
Afrofuturism, okay?

00:47:28.430 --> 00:47:30.390
Alright? All of that
is the practice.

00:47:30.390 --> 00:47:33.430
We need to do a handbook.

00:47:33.430 --> 00:47:36.710
[Laughter] On how to survive
this current apocalypse

00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:38.010
that we're in.

00:47:38.010 --> 00:47:41.220
And how to get to
that other future.

00:47:41.220 --> 00:47:46.540
One of the things that
I'm always curious about.

00:47:46.540 --> 00:47:49.980
Is why we have so many
dystopias versus utopias.

00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:51.410
Like we know that
we're living in,

00:47:51.410 --> 00:47:53.130
you know some challenging times.

00:47:53.130 --> 00:47:57.050
And, you know we always thought,
okay, it was worse then.

00:47:57.050 --> 00:47:58.470
Everything is better now.

00:47:58.470 --> 00:48:01.370
And then you look up again,
and you're like wait a minute.

00:48:01.370 --> 00:48:04.870
It's a-- you know, we're going
back and forth in time here.

00:48:04.870 --> 00:48:09.830
But it seems like the idea of
writing a utopia seems to be

00:48:09.830 --> 00:48:12.710
like the, The Black
Unicorn of the genre.

00:48:12.710 --> 00:48:14.050
There aren't very many.

00:48:14.050 --> 00:48:16.100
Why do you think that is?

00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:17.610
And what can we do about that?

00:48:17.610 --> 00:48:19.890
Because in order to
build the future, right?

00:48:19.890 --> 00:48:21.690
Don't you, you have
to imagine it?

00:48:21.690 --> 00:48:24.450
Can we not imagine
it working out?

00:48:24.450 --> 00:48:27.260
&gt;&gt; I don't actually
have an answer to that.

00:48:27.260 --> 00:48:30.070
[Laughter] But I
jumped to my microphone.

00:48:30.070 --> 00:48:33.180
Because I was on a, a program

00:48:33.180 --> 00:48:35.090
with Angela Davis a
couple of years ago.

00:48:35.090 --> 00:48:39.200
And she spoke to this, this
question of Afrofuturism.

00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:44.000
And how even if you're not
going to live to see it.

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:47.790
You have to believe in that
future to do the work, right?

00:48:47.790 --> 00:48:52.600
So I think on one level, even
when we're writing dystopia.

00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:54.210
And I'll use Octavia
in this example,

00:48:54.210 --> 00:48:56.080
because I think Octavia
Butler and so much

00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:57.750
of her work was like wake up!

00:48:57.750 --> 00:49:00.950
Wake up! You know?

00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:03.780
If she didn't think that
would help, why do it?

00:49:03.780 --> 00:49:05.080
Why, why shout?

00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:07.450
Why, why try to bring
attention to behaviors?

00:49:07.450 --> 00:49:10.770
Like if we continue along this
path, this is where we're going.

00:49:10.770 --> 00:49:13.570
I don't know the last time
you read Parable of the Sower.

00:49:13.570 --> 00:49:16.510
But it feels closer and
closer every time you read it.

00:49:16.510 --> 00:49:20.270
Some of us are already living
in Parable of the Sower, right?

00:49:20.270 --> 00:49:24.270
And, and, it, it's this desire
to create something better.

00:49:24.270 --> 00:49:26.070
And the seed of utopianism

00:49:26.070 --> 00:49:29.440
in there is this religion
earth seed that she created.

00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:33.360
That some people actually do
use as an actual religion.

00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:35.310
So it was helpful enough.

00:49:35.310 --> 00:49:39.480
It was something that could help
people move toward something

00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:42.240
better than what
she was depicting.

00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:43.560
And I think that's a piece of it

00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:46.490
that sometimes our utopias
are disguised as dystopia.

00:49:46.490 --> 00:49:48.680
And I'm in a, I'm

00:49:48.680 --> 00:49:51.620
in an anthology right now
called A People's Future

00:49:51.620 --> 00:49:52.920
of the United States.

00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:54.220
I think you have a story
in there, too, right?

00:49:54.220 --> 00:49:55.520
Right, yeah.

00:49:55.520 --> 00:49:58.340
And I'm reading these.

00:49:58.340 --> 00:49:59.640
I'm listening to the audio book.

00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:00.940
I'm an audio book junkie.

00:50:00.940 --> 00:50:04.140
And it's like all these
stories are absolutely,

00:50:04.140 --> 00:50:07.020
unflinchingly looking at you
know this moment in time.

00:50:07.020 --> 00:50:08.320
And where we're headed.

00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:09.630
And all of it.

00:50:09.630 --> 00:50:12.100
But there's a hopefulness
to a lot of the stories.

00:50:12.100 --> 00:50:13.770
Someone said there was a
hopefulness in my story.

00:50:13.770 --> 00:50:15.070
I was like really?

00:50:15.070 --> 00:50:19.040
But, but I think
yes, because we do.

00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:21.560
We do believe that
it can be better.

00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:26.550
&gt;&gt; I want to piggyback off
of you saying that a lot

00:50:26.550 --> 00:50:28.880
of our utopias look
like dystopias.

00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:30.740
But I, I feel like that's

00:50:30.740 --> 00:50:34.180
because there tends
to be a perception.

00:50:34.180 --> 00:50:36.730
Excuse me in the
[inaudible] whatever

00:50:36.730 --> 00:50:42.370
where utopias are just
straight happy times.

00:50:42.370 --> 00:50:43.850
You don't depict ugliness.

00:50:43.850 --> 00:50:47.870
You don't depict people
as they really are.

00:50:47.870 --> 00:50:50.480
Which to me is doing a
disservice to humanity.

00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:52.630
That's not an honest utopia.

00:50:52.630 --> 00:50:55.100
That is, that is avoidance.

00:50:55.100 --> 00:50:57.390
That's, I don't know.

00:50:57.390 --> 00:51:03.490
Denial. And so in order
to truly show a world

00:51:03.490 --> 00:51:04.790
that could be better.

00:51:04.790 --> 00:51:07.780
You've got to engage with what
the world is actually like.

00:51:07.780 --> 00:51:11.890
And I found myself struggling
with this not too long ago.

00:51:11.890 --> 00:51:16.420
I decided that I wanted to write
a story that depicted a, a,

00:51:16.420 --> 00:51:19.080
a world without bigotry.

00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:21.320
And I struggled.

00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:23.380
Because I'm like
how the hell do--

00:51:23.380 --> 00:51:26.380
like I am the product
of a culture.

00:51:26.380 --> 00:51:31.730
That has spent hundreds of
years refining how layered

00:51:31.730 --> 00:51:33.400
and hierarchical
we are going to,

00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:35.520
to construct ourselves to be.

00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:39.600
And I, I had a hard time even
imagining it for a long time.

00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:41.140
And then I ended up writing a,

00:51:41.140 --> 00:51:43.600
a story called The Ones
Who Stand and Fight.

00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:48.000
Which is in the, the How Long
Until Black Future Month.

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:51.410
Yeah, it's, it's
actually me speaking back

00:51:51.410 --> 00:51:54.310
at an Ursula Le Guin
story called "The ones

00:51:54.310 --> 00:51:55.980
who walk away from Omelas."

00:51:55.980 --> 00:52:00.400
And in Omelas, I'm
sorry, I have to spoil it.

00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:01.700
It's been 20 years.

00:52:01.700 --> 00:52:03.000
It's too late.

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:06.870
Spoiler statute of
limitations is gone.

00:52:06.870 --> 00:52:12.010
In Omelas, Le Guin imagines
or, or asks us to imagine.

00:52:12.010 --> 00:52:15.040
A truly amazing and
beautiful society.

00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:18.840
But then she shows us the worm
at the heart of that apple.

00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:22.900
Because so much of our society
is amazing and, and astonishing

00:52:22.900 --> 00:52:24.430
when you really kind
of consider it.

00:52:24.430 --> 00:52:25.800
We live in the future.

00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:31.300
And yet for our amazing
smartphones, there are,

00:52:31.300 --> 00:52:34.440
are children dying
in cobalt mines to,

00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:36.250
to pull up the materials
that we use to make is.

00:52:36.250 --> 00:52:39.050
So you know Le Guin
was like basically,

00:52:39.050 --> 00:52:40.350
this is what we've got.

00:52:40.350 --> 00:52:41.980
This is where we're
living right now.

00:52:41.980 --> 00:52:45.410
And so I decided that I wanted
to try and envision and,

00:52:45.410 --> 00:52:51.800
and ask readers to envision a
world that was bigotry-free.

00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:55.690
And it wasn't that I was
trying to show the worm

00:52:55.690 --> 00:52:56.990
at the heart of the apple.

00:52:56.990 --> 00:52:59.230
It was that I was
trying to acknowledge

00:52:59.230 --> 00:53:02.110
that people will
take it right back

00:53:02.110 --> 00:53:03.520
to the place that it used to be.

00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:07.190
Even if you do manage to ever
get us to this amazing world

00:53:07.190 --> 00:53:08.930
that we have such
trouble imagining.

00:53:08.930 --> 00:53:10.960
It's going to be a fight.

00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:15.680
It's going to require a force
of people to constantly work

00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:18.020
to keep it as good as it is.

00:53:18.020 --> 00:53:20.940
And so that's what I
ended up depicting.

00:53:20.940 --> 00:53:24.520
And I called them social
workers, but they kill people.

00:53:24.520 --> 00:53:28.020
And that's what's necessary
to keep a world safe.

00:53:28.020 --> 00:53:30.330
From the idea that some
people aren't important,

00:53:30.330 --> 00:53:33.250
and some people are expendable.

00:53:33.250 --> 00:53:35.560
And it, it's a constant
struggle.

00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:39.650
I hate the fact that it's so
hard for me as a black woman.

00:53:39.650 --> 00:53:40.980
As a science fiction writer.

00:53:40.980 --> 00:53:44.590
If I can't imagine
a future like this,

00:53:44.590 --> 00:53:46.840
I can't ask other
people to do that.

00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:48.930
So I needed to be
able to do this.

00:53:48.930 --> 00:53:51.550
And it took years.

00:53:51.550 --> 00:53:52.850
For me to manage that story.

00:53:52.850 --> 00:53:55.670
And I don't, I'm not 100%
happy with that depiction.

00:53:55.670 --> 00:53:57.970
So I'm still working on it.

00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:06.500
&gt;&gt; I think it's hard to imagine
utopia, utopias, if you will.

00:54:06.500 --> 00:54:12.630
Because for so many of us,
joy and peace are conditional.

00:54:12.630 --> 00:54:17.180
It's conditioned on a certain
number of if/then statements.

00:54:17.180 --> 00:54:20.190
That never come to fore.

00:54:20.190 --> 00:54:22.440
They, they just don't.

00:54:22.440 --> 00:54:28.210
So I then resort to thinking
about joy, if you will.

00:54:28.210 --> 00:54:29.510
As opposed to utopia.

00:54:29.510 --> 00:54:32.170
But just pure joy, like
joy in small things.

00:54:32.170 --> 00:54:34.100
And how one gets to that.

00:54:34.100 --> 00:54:36.200
Because even in these
kind of dystopic novels.

00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:38.160
There's still people in there

00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:41.430
that are living their
lives happily so.

00:54:41.430 --> 00:54:44.080
Like you know just, they're,
they're still living their lives

00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:45.380
to the best of their ability.

00:54:45.380 --> 00:54:46.680
I think about my grandmother.

00:54:46.680 --> 00:54:48.030
She had a fifth-grade education.

00:54:48.030 --> 00:54:50.710
She worked in, she moved
up in the Great Migration

00:54:50.710 --> 00:54:54.340
from Alabama to, to New Jersey
to get a job in a factory.

00:54:54.340 --> 00:54:57.500
By my calculations,
she made 73% less

00:54:57.500 --> 00:54:58.910
than the lowest-paid white woman

00:54:58.910 --> 00:55:01.380
at the same factory,
doing the same job.

00:55:01.380 --> 00:55:03.780
She would come home every day.

00:55:03.780 --> 00:55:05.420
With a smile on her face.

00:55:05.420 --> 00:55:08.120
And I asked her why, my
grandmother also drank a lot.

00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:09.420
So let me just say that.

00:55:09.420 --> 00:55:12.570
[Laughter] It was-- but
she had to find joy.

00:55:12.570 --> 00:55:14.820
It was self-care, right?

00:55:14.820 --> 00:55:17.190
So she would come home every
day with a smile on her face.

00:55:17.190 --> 00:55:18.490
And I remember asking
her one time.

00:55:18.490 --> 00:55:20.730
Why was she so, why
was she smiling?

00:55:20.730 --> 00:55:22.270
And she was like,
"I have enough.

00:55:22.270 --> 00:55:25.010
I'm fine. I have enough."

00:55:25.010 --> 00:55:27.560
And maybe utopia is maybe
just enough, you know?

00:55:27.560 --> 00:55:30.740
Like the best we can
hope for here is enough.

00:55:30.740 --> 00:55:33.030
And not kind of in
the materialist sense,

00:55:33.030 --> 00:55:34.330
but in the purest sense.

00:55:34.330 --> 00:55:35.980
Like I have enough.

00:55:35.980 --> 00:55:38.120
But also, that she
could look in the faces

00:55:38.120 --> 00:55:40.420
of her grandchildren
and see future.

00:55:40.420 --> 00:55:42.750
And so the idea that
you have enough.

00:55:42.750 --> 00:55:44.050
But still, you can still,

00:55:44.050 --> 00:55:46.450
you still have vision
enough to see future.

00:55:46.450 --> 00:55:49.160
And I think knowing that her
grandchildren would have more

00:55:49.160 --> 00:55:50.460
than a fifth-grade education.

00:55:50.460 --> 00:55:55.430
And by and, and certainly would
not be making 73% less than some

00:55:55.430 --> 00:55:57.160
of the lowest-wage workers.

00:55:57.160 --> 00:55:59.080
I think that brought her joy.

00:55:59.080 --> 00:56:02.590
And I think that helped her to
live in her own type of utopia.

00:56:02.590 --> 00:56:04.700
And she again, drank a lot.

00:56:04.700 --> 00:56:07.600
So that's what we gotta
do sometimes, I'm serious.

00:56:07.600 --> 00:56:08.900
&gt;&gt; And, and to your point,

00:56:08.900 --> 00:56:11.510
contrast that with angry
billionaires, you know

00:56:11.510 --> 00:56:14.580
[ Laughter ]

00:56:14.580 --> 00:56:15.880
&gt;&gt; Sheree Renee Thomas:
It's not enough.

00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:18.180
It's not enough.

00:56:18.180 --> 00:56:20.950
Nor is one lifetime, apparently.

00:56:20.950 --> 00:56:25.060
All the new science being
dedicated to, towards this path

00:56:25.060 --> 00:56:27.780
of immortality, you know?

00:56:27.780 --> 00:56:29.240
One lifetime is not enough.

00:56:29.240 --> 00:56:32.870
&gt;&gt; And so many of the
forces pushing-- .

00:56:32.870 --> 00:56:35.590
I am 100% in favor
of space exploration.

00:56:35.590 --> 00:56:39.800
But not so that, I
can't mention the name.

00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:43.620
But not so that certain
particular people can go forth

00:56:43.620 --> 00:56:47.400
and live there away from us.

00:56:47.400 --> 00:56:48.790
And leave us to die.

00:56:48.790 --> 00:56:50.280
Because that's what's
pushing a lot

00:56:50.280 --> 00:56:55.010
of these private attempts
at exploring space.

00:56:55.010 --> 00:56:56.310
Anyway.

00:56:56.310 --> 00:56:57.760
&gt;&gt; Sheree Renee Thomas: What
do you think about the films

00:56:57.760 --> 00:56:59.520
that all make that inevitable?

00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:02.270
That the whole purpose
of space exploration is

00:57:02.270 --> 00:57:06.160
to create a suburb
for affluent people?

00:57:06.160 --> 00:57:07.460
&gt;&gt; Suburb!

00:57:07.460 --> 00:57:09.130
A walled suburb,
a gated community.

00:57:09.130 --> 00:57:11.180
Where the gate is
literally you're got

00:57:11.180 --> 00:57:13.510
to have a rocket
to get there, yeah.

00:57:13.510 --> 00:57:14.810
&gt;&gt; Sheree Renee Thomas:
You know, I want a movie

00:57:14.810 --> 00:57:16.110
where we're already there.

00:57:16.110 --> 00:57:17.410
Hey! Welcome to the moon!

00:57:17.410 --> 00:57:18.710
What took you so long, you know?

00:57:18.710 --> 00:57:20.420
We're already here, okay?

00:57:20.420 --> 00:57:21.720
But.

00:57:21.720 --> 00:57:24.290
&gt;&gt; I mean, this is, this
is the thing that I was,

00:57:24.290 --> 00:57:26.500
that I was trying
to work through.

00:57:26.500 --> 00:57:30.070
We live in a society in which
there are multiple systems

00:57:30.070 --> 00:57:32.350
and multiple organizations.

00:57:32.350 --> 00:57:35.490
Dedicated to keeping us
thinking the way that we do.

00:57:35.490 --> 00:57:37.580
Dedicated to making us believe

00:57:37.580 --> 00:57:39.970
that a better world
is impossible.

00:57:39.970 --> 00:57:44.060
So of course if we ever
manage to get out of that.

00:57:44.060 --> 00:57:45.750
We're going to have
to have societies

00:57:45.750 --> 00:57:52.260
and systems designed to, to
work against falling back.

00:57:52.260 --> 00:57:56.530
So you know envisioning those
systems is what I've been trying

00:57:56.530 --> 00:57:58.320
to do.

00:57:58.320 --> 00:57:59.860
&gt;&gt; Sheree Renee Thomas:
So in this body of work,

00:57:59.860 --> 00:58:04.540
that we are redefining
every day,

00:58:04.540 --> 00:58:07.270
we are interrogating privilege.

00:58:07.270 --> 00:58:09.160
We are revisiting the past.

00:58:09.160 --> 00:58:12.110
And re-imagining, giving
more voices, people's voice,

00:58:12.110 --> 00:58:15.160
people's history,
the people's future.

00:58:15.160 --> 00:58:18.370
You know taking up [inaudible]
work, that monumental project.

00:58:18.370 --> 00:58:21.220
And forecasting it
into the future.

00:58:21.220 --> 00:58:24.980
By writers who are
often seen as invisible

00:58:24.980 --> 00:58:26.510
in the genre, you know?

00:58:26.510 --> 00:58:30.810
Or have been until history,
until history, right?

00:58:30.810 --> 00:58:33.230
You know, very visible.

00:58:33.230 --> 00:58:38.390
We are looking at gender in
different ways, you know?

00:58:38.390 --> 00:58:39.930
Talking a little bit
about Ursula Le Guin

00:58:39.930 --> 00:58:41.310
of course and her pioneer work.

00:58:41.310 --> 00:58:46.580
And the women who were writing
so bravely and boldly then.

00:58:46.580 --> 00:58:48.760
Thinking of James
[inaudible] Junior.

00:58:48.760 --> 00:58:51.400
Which-- I won't say
who I thought it was

00:58:51.400 --> 00:58:52.700
in case I misquote him.

00:58:52.700 --> 00:58:56.860
But very famous writer, very
famous Golden Age writer.

00:58:56.860 --> 00:58:58.160
Said he would eat his hat?

00:58:58.160 --> 00:58:59.460
Is that what he said?

00:58:59.460 --> 00:59:01.510
If she, if James [inaudible]
turned out to be a woman?

00:59:01.510 --> 00:59:05.060
[ inaudible ]

00:59:05.060 --> 00:59:06.730
&gt;&gt; I don't know about the one
who said he would eat his hat.

00:59:06.730 --> 00:59:09.540
But he refused to
engage with the idea.

00:59:09.540 --> 00:59:11.120
If it's who I think
you're talking about.

00:59:11.120 --> 00:59:12.620
He refused to engage
with the idea

00:59:12.620 --> 00:59:14.040
that it could possibly be-- .

00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:15.380
That [inaudible] could
possibly be a woman.

00:59:15.380 --> 00:59:18.150
Because there was something
[inaudible] masculine

00:59:18.150 --> 00:59:19.940
about his writing.

00:59:19.940 --> 00:59:21.260
[Laughter]

00:59:21.260 --> 00:59:23.100
&gt;&gt; Sheree Renee Thomas: So
these writers are always.

00:59:23.100 --> 00:59:26.430
Even just by the act of creation
and publishing in the industry

00:59:26.430 --> 00:59:28.020
that says it wants diversity.

00:59:28.020 --> 00:59:31.990
And then does many things
to try to undermine that.

00:59:31.990 --> 00:59:35.400
At the same time.

00:59:35.400 --> 00:59:38.570
We won't go there though, right?

00:59:40.350 --> 00:59:44.230
&gt;&gt; You know, I was, I
was in Toronto last week

00:59:44.230 --> 00:59:46.230
when we were doing a
screening for Horror Noire.

00:59:46.230 --> 00:59:48.110
And a woman raised her hand.

00:59:48.110 --> 00:59:50.120
And said, "I'm so
glad you did this.

00:59:50.120 --> 00:59:52.230
Because I write speculative
fiction."

00:59:52.230 --> 00:59:53.530
That was a young black woman.

00:59:53.530 --> 00:59:56.480
"But I'm always having to
defend my creative choices.

00:59:56.480 --> 01:00:00.760
Even making the character
black, okay?"

01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:05.100
So while we're talking about
the progress that we've made.

01:00:05.100 --> 01:00:08.180
Let's remember that there
are writers, like I did.

01:00:08.180 --> 01:00:12.320
Who are struggling to even put
themselves in their own stories.

01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:15.550
As though there has to
be some overriding reason

01:00:15.550 --> 01:00:17.720
for a character to be black.

01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:19.760
Right? Or that if
you're a black writer,

01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:22.620
it can only be about
a social issue.

01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:26.170
And it can't just be a
black girl with a dragon.

01:00:26.170 --> 01:00:27.470
Which is what I told her write.

01:00:27.470 --> 01:00:29.890
And you know yes, and I.

01:00:29.890 --> 01:00:32.400
By the time I got through
college and grad school.

01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:35.570
I had started writing
white male characters.

01:00:35.570 --> 01:00:39.860
And I, it was The Between,
The Between that was the first

01:00:39.860 --> 01:00:41.440
and major effort of mine.

01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:42.740
To say I'm going to write me-- .

01:00:42.740 --> 01:00:44.040
And even then I was
writing a man.

01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:45.340
But still, I was closer.

01:00:45.340 --> 01:00:48.360
I'm going to write me,
I'm going to put me

01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:50.160
in a story and see what happens.

01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:51.460
And thank goodness I did.

01:00:51.460 --> 01:00:52.760
That's when I found my voice.

01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:54.060
When I gave myself permission

01:00:54.060 --> 01:00:57.280
to write myself into
my own stories.

01:00:57.280 --> 01:00:58.830
&gt;&gt; Sheree Renee Thomas: Giving
ourselves permission to write.

01:00:58.830 --> 01:01:00.990
I mean, that, and
to write ourselves.

01:01:00.990 --> 01:01:03.690
You talked a little
bit about Twitter.

01:01:03.690 --> 01:01:06.900
And of course you have
[inaudible] Tweets.

01:01:06.900 --> 01:01:09.110
In your, in your collection
where you're always,

01:01:09.110 --> 01:01:12.590
as Carl Phillips says, "You're
engaging with new media."

01:01:12.590 --> 01:01:13.890
In your poems.

01:01:13.890 --> 01:01:15.190
You are challenging this ideal

01:01:15.190 --> 01:01:18.040
that traditional poetry
is text-based only.

01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:23.260
You know. So you're doing
some very innovative work

01:01:23.260 --> 01:01:24.560
in your writing.

01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:25.860
But there's an interview.

01:01:25.860 --> 01:01:29.770
So when we post it for the
zillionth time, Toni Morrison,

01:01:29.770 --> 01:01:34.400
like laying waste
to a journalist

01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:35.970
who did not intend, I guess.

01:01:35.970 --> 01:01:39.770
Necessarily to get
slaughtered in that interview.

01:01:39.770 --> 01:01:42.830
[Laughter] But this
idea basically

01:01:42.830 --> 01:01:45.930
when are you going
to write about-- .

01:01:45.930 --> 01:01:47.320
&gt;&gt; That was glorious.

01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:50.940
It, it was clip from
some interview.

01:01:50.940 --> 01:01:52.710
I don't know when this
interview happened,

01:01:52.710 --> 01:01:54.550
or what the context was.

01:01:54.550 --> 01:01:59.460
But basically the, the reporter
who presented as a white woman.

01:01:59.460 --> 01:02:03.540
Asked Miss Morrison,
I'm sorry, Dr?

01:02:03.540 --> 01:02:09.430
Morrison. Asked, basically
was kind of talking around it,

01:02:09.430 --> 01:02:10.730
but basically was like.

01:02:10.730 --> 01:02:13.510
Well, when are you going
to write white people

01:02:13.510 --> 01:02:15.780
in a substantial way
into your fiction.

01:02:15.780 --> 01:02:19.500
And was basically like when
are you going to grow up

01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:21.910
and start doing the real stuff?

01:02:21.910 --> 01:02:24.300
She didn't say that,
that's my interpretation.

01:02:24.300 --> 01:02:26.060
Let me not, let me not--
that was my [inaudible].

01:02:26.060 --> 01:02:29.370
But like the tone,
facial expression.

01:02:29.370 --> 01:02:31.910
All of it was like, well you
know, you've done very well

01:02:31.910 --> 01:02:34.950
at writing this, this,
this nice black stuff.

01:02:34.950 --> 01:02:36.640
So but you seem to
be a good writer.

01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:37.940
So why don't you
do some real-- ?

01:02:37.940 --> 01:02:40.210
That was my interpretation.

01:02:40.210 --> 01:02:42.010
&gt;&gt; Sheree Renee Thomas: The
term she used was mainstream.

01:02:42.010 --> 01:02:45.220
When are you going to
write the mainstream.

01:02:45.220 --> 01:02:48.310
&gt;&gt; And she, and Toni said
back, "I am the mainstream."

01:02:48.310 --> 01:02:51.440
You know, she tore
the woman apart.

01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:54.640
She was just like, "You
don't even realize how just

01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:56.780
unbelievably racist that was.

01:02:56.780 --> 01:02:59.540
The, the question that you
just asked me just was."

01:02:59.540 --> 01:03:02.080
You would not ask white
writers, "When are you going

01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:03.700
to write somebody black?"

01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:06.520
So you know I am the mainstream.

01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:10.080
She had re-- she had
flipped that whole thing.

01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:11.380
She had flipped that script.

01:03:11.380 --> 01:03:13.040
The woman was trying
to catch up.

01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:14.340
So anyway.

01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:17.400
&gt;&gt; Sheree Renee Thomas:
Yep, trying to catch up.

01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:20.890
Toni Morrison said, "I,
I stand on the margins

01:03:20.890 --> 01:03:23.310
and I claim the center
as my center.

01:03:23.310 --> 01:03:25.010
I am the mainstream."

01:03:25.010 --> 01:03:28.070
You know and it's just an
amazing, amazing interview.

01:03:28.070 --> 01:03:30.990
Are there any last thoughts
that you want to share

01:03:30.990 --> 01:03:33.690
with our audience
about your journey

01:03:33.690 --> 01:03:37.250
through the area we
call Afrofuturism?

01:03:37.250 --> 01:03:40.390
&gt;&gt; One thing that comes
to mind, this idea.

01:03:40.390 --> 01:03:42.510
I mean yeah, we are
the mainstream.

01:03:42.510 --> 01:03:46.340
But at the same time, we've
also been pushed to the margins.

01:03:46.340 --> 01:03:50.950
And there's something about
observing from the margins

01:03:50.950 --> 01:03:53.420
that gives you a different view.

01:03:53.420 --> 01:03:54.740
And it's so valuable.

01:03:54.740 --> 01:03:56.680
You know it's a valuable
contribution.

01:03:56.680 --> 01:03:59.530
When someone who hasn't
been invited to the party.

01:03:59.530 --> 01:04:00.830
Can write about what's going

01:04:00.830 --> 01:04:03.510
on outside while y'all
are at the party.

01:04:03.510 --> 01:04:06.820
And it creates a
leadership potential.

01:04:06.820 --> 01:04:08.440
So that when the lights go out

01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:10.050
and the music stops
and everyone's like.

01:04:10.050 --> 01:04:11.980
Whoa, where did the party go?

01:04:11.980 --> 01:04:13.280
There are these people
who are already

01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:15.170
out here saying,
"Yeah, we knew that.

01:04:15.170 --> 01:04:16.470
No here's where you go.

01:04:16.470 --> 01:04:17.860
Here's the path."

01:04:17.860 --> 01:04:19.160
And, and there's a lot

01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:23.130
of leadership potential
there in, in Afrofuturism.

01:04:23.130 --> 01:04:24.430
&gt;&gt; Sheree Renee Thomas:
It creates space.

01:04:24.430 --> 01:04:25.730
Yeah. Creates space.

01:04:25.730 --> 01:04:27.430
&gt;&gt; And direction.

01:04:27.430 --> 01:04:28.730
&gt;&gt; Sheree Renee Thomas:
And direction.

01:04:28.730 --> 01:04:30.030
Thank you.

01:04:30.030 --> 01:04:33.440
&gt;&gt; I want to go back to the
question you didn't bring it up.

01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:36.050
You brought it up, but we
didn't go forward with it.

01:04:36.050 --> 01:04:37.630
Which was about publishing.

01:04:37.630 --> 01:04:42.370
I know from, because of
the content that I write.

01:04:42.370 --> 01:04:44.130
The types of things
that I like to write,

01:04:44.130 --> 01:04:47.860
It is often very
difficult to get my work

01:04:47.860 --> 01:04:50.500
in mainstream publications.

01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:52.340
In mainstream poetry
publications.

01:04:52.340 --> 01:04:53.780
It just is.

01:04:53.780 --> 01:04:57.060
I am the only Yale Younger who's
never been in Poetry Magazine.

01:04:57.060 --> 01:05:00.680
Why? It's because they don't
understand what I'm doing.

01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:03.630
And I'm okay with them not
understanding what I'm doing.

01:05:03.630 --> 01:05:06.740
I'm okay with them having
that degree of uncertainty.

01:05:06.740 --> 01:05:10.230
Because that makes me think
that I'm on the right path.

01:05:10.230 --> 01:05:15.910
If I am moving in the direction
of, of being completely

01:05:15.910 --> 01:05:17.690
and universally understood.

01:05:17.690 --> 01:05:20.310
Then that goes against what
I'm actually trying to write.

01:05:20.310 --> 01:05:22.390
I don't write for
universal understanding.

01:05:22.390 --> 01:05:24.010
I write so that I
can understand it.

01:05:24.010 --> 01:05:26.030
And make sense of the
world that I live in.

01:05:26.030 --> 01:05:28.070
And that is my form
of Afrofuturism.

01:05:28.070 --> 01:05:30.370
I'm making sense of
the world that I live

01:05:30.370 --> 01:05:35.040
in according whatever criteria
I lay down on that page.

01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:38.110
And which brings up the point
that you were talking about.

01:05:38.110 --> 01:05:42.320
Afrofuturism can
be, it can be joy.

01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:45.280
It can be about oppression.

01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:47.840
It can be about any topics.

01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:50.340
It can be about new
world politics.

01:05:50.340 --> 01:05:51.640
That we haven't even imagined.

01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:53.630
It can be about any
of those things.

01:05:53.630 --> 01:05:56.620
I think the, the definition
continues to widen.

01:05:56.620 --> 01:05:57.920
Which speaks to your
point, Nora,

01:05:57.920 --> 01:05:59.830
about really probably
needing a new word.

01:05:59.830 --> 01:06:02.340
Because it's not
actually all-encompassing.

01:06:02.340 --> 01:06:05.600
In terms of what
Afrofuturism seeks to do.

01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:07.690
It seeks to deliver a future.

01:06:07.690 --> 01:06:10.290
Futures come in many
different forms.

01:06:10.290 --> 01:06:13.950
So I just encourage
anybody who's thinking

01:06:13.950 --> 01:06:17.070
about writing speculatively
or thinking about writing

01:06:17.070 --> 01:06:19.990
in a different way
than other people.

01:06:19.990 --> 01:06:21.290
To continue to do that.

01:06:21.290 --> 01:06:22.590
Write what you like to write.

01:06:22.590 --> 01:06:25.080
But also broaden your
definition of what future means.

01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:27.550
&gt;&gt; Sheree Renee Thomas:
Thank you, thank you so much.

01:06:27.550 --> 01:06:29.510
Thank you all.

01:06:29.510 --> 01:06:39.200
[ Applause ]

01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:40.500
&gt;&gt; Robert Casper:
Thank you on behalf

01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:41.990
of the Library of Congress.

01:06:41.990 --> 01:06:48.650
I would like to note that
American Journal is the title

01:06:48.650 --> 01:06:52.080
of the anthology of our
current poet laureate based

01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:53.380
on that poem.

01:06:53.380 --> 01:06:55.420
For sale in our bookstore.

01:06:55.420 --> 01:06:57.430
But what you should
do before you go off

01:06:57.430 --> 01:07:00.940
to get American Journal and read
about the great poems in there.

01:07:00.940 --> 01:07:03.530
Is to get books by our
authors in the back.

01:07:03.530 --> 01:07:04.830
Have them sign them.

01:07:04.830 --> 01:07:07.600
And hopefully come
to the event tonight.

01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:10.000
As I said, it's sold out.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.190
But there's a standby line.

01:07:12.190 --> 01:07:16.870
I'm sure you likely want to
hear each of our authors read

01:07:16.870 --> 01:07:18.720
from the works they're
talked so eloquently about.

01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:20.400
So until then, thanks so much.

01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:23.220
Please do sign, fill
out your survey sheets.

01:07:23.220 --> 01:07:25.750
Sign up on our sign-up
sheet in the back.

01:07:25.750 --> 01:07:27.760
We'll let you know
about future events.

01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:29.060
Thanks so much!
