00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.350
- We talked about the educational system,

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.530
a little bit about law
enforcement, a lot about children,

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.450
but children grow up, and
they need a healthcare system

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.120
that's gonna support
them in a meaningful way.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.510
So I think our next
presentation will talk about

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.483
a project that accomplished
some of those goals.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.270
So I'd like to introduce

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.823
the members of the CART team.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.430
Jo Cummins here, is our program director

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.230
for the Office of
Developmental Primary Care,

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.200
and Pat Mejia is the,

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.700
next to her is the program
manager and community liaison

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.963
for the Office of
Developmental Primary Care.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.320
Next we have Dr. Zoe Collins,

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.923
who is a licensed psychologist in Oakland.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.033
And following that is Dr. Eva Ihle,

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.813
and Dr. Ihle is faculty at UCSF,

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.170
she completed her general
psychiatry residency,

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.870
child and adolescent
psychiatry fellowship,

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.180
and post-doc all at UCSF,

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.610
and she's currently the director

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.130
of the Community Consultation Program

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.690
in the division of Child and
Adolescent Psychiatry at UCSF,

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:28.710
and the interim medical director

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.400
of the division of Infant,
Child, and Adolescent Psychiatry

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.763
at San Francisco General.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.420
The final member in the
panel is Dr. Clarissa Kripke,

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:41.963
many of you know Dr. Kripke,

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.200
she is a clinical professor and director

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.070
of the Office of
Developmental Primary Care,

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.970
and the Department of Family
and Community Medicine at UCSF,

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.010
and for over a decade,
has really been devoted

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.540
to the project of improving
our healthcare system

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.960
in the state of California,
and beyond if she could,

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.080
for adults with, and adolescents

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.713
with developmental disabilities.

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.830
So today I'm gonna talk about

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.453
some of the lessons
learned from our CART team.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.230
And some of you may know
what CART stands for,

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.230
but in case you don't, and
we have no disclosures,

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.040
I'm gonna go through sort of
an overview of the CART model,

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.860
and then talk specifically about

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.480
what the CART Mobile Services Project team

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.620
was all about, and what we tried to do,

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.040
as well as sort of what our mission was,

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.320
and then we're gonna hear
from members of the team

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.550
about the caregiver assessment component,

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.720
as well as some of the clinical themes,

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.970
and then finally wrapping up with

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.123
what some of our lessons
learned from this project were,

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.053
as well as some of the challenges.

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.280
So the CART Model, many of
you have seen this before,

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.440
but really the CART Model
is based upon the notion

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.660
and the value that healthcare for people

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.430
with developmental disabilities
is interdisciplinary,

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.210
is team-based, and always
has patients and caregivers,

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:28.163
and I would add community
at the core of this model.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.450
And you can see that the top of the model

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.030
is really enhanced primary
care, and care coordination,

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.830
and we know that our
healthcare system right now

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.170
remains woefully inadequate
in terms of providing care

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.830
for people with
developmental disabilities.

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.760
And a major mission of this project

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.370
was to help build capacity
within the healthcare workforce

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.120
in California to provide

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.523
for a better quality care.

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:01.190
The vision here is really to ensure

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.210
that all people with
developmental disabilities

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:05.730
have access to healthcare services

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.700
that are going to maximize
not just their healthcare,

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.220
but their wellness and their function.

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.900
The CART services,

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.800
CART is Clinical Advocacy
Research Training

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.750
and Technical Assistance.

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.150
I will say that the R is a
small R because there's been,

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.604
the focus has been much more
on providing clinical services,

00:04:25.604 --> 00:04:28.690
advocacy, and training.

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.500
The yearly health assessment component

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.100
is actually more of the proactive

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.920
and preventive part of the CART Model,

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.460
which really advocates
to have a comprehensive

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.140
yearly assessment for individuals

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:46.220
with developmental disabilities,
and then health advocacy

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.020
is something that I think the CART Model

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.130
does incredibly well,

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.150
and is demonstrated with some

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.533
of the amazing resources
that you see on the website.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.883
So what did our services
team do, and who are we?

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.920
We are a multidisciplinary team

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:08.683
that provides healthcare consultations,

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.540
including, includes
experts in primary care,

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.010
which is Dr. Kripke and myself,

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:18.890
psychiatry, which is Dr. Ihle,

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:21.540
psychology, which is Dr. Collins,

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.830
and then our incredible team of

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.900
community liaison, parent,

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.023
and advocates with Pat and Joe.

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.820
And, oh I see, I can see it over here.

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.910
So our focus is actually
on adolescents and adults

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:42.860
with developmental disabilities,
but not only clients,

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.370
but also the clinicians, family members,

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:48.990
and also the caregivers,
and people who support them

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.040
in the community, which
are really vital part

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:56.868
of what we did when we went
out to provide service.

00:05:56.868 --> 00:05:59.853
This program really came about,

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:05.270
it started I think, the beginning
started way back in 2006

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.180
with some of the Grassroots
Initiative from the CART model,

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.760
and I think the mobile consult team

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.820
is actually an actualization
of some of that

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:18.993
really hard work that's
happened over the past decade.

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:22.280
For the first time, this
is really a collaboration

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.100
among regional centers,

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:27.780
so not just one regional center,

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:29.410
but there were six regional centers

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:31.600
who collaborated on this project.

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:35.000
And I'll show you in a minute what,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.140
where some of our swath of services

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:42.123
geographically served.

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:46.110
So what we did, was we provided both,

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:48.310
and this was a project that
occurred over three years

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:53.120
and ended in June in 2018,

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.763
yes, okay.

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.360
We did phone and email consultations

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.960
that came from a variety of sources,

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:03.780
from clinicians, from parents,

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:08.780
from caregivers, clients, and clients.

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:12.200
We did a comprehensive
assessment and consultation,

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.320
which I'll talk about in a minute.

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:18.490
We did a lot of training, and
I'll tell you more about that,

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:22.170
as well as developing policy and advocacy

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:25.760
statements and materials,

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:30.280
and some of which you
can see in the booth out,

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:32.540
right outside this door here,

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:35.560
which has lots of the
materials from the website.

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:38.810
As well as, this program
actually helped us support

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:42.143
this conference for several years as well.

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:50.670
So, this is a map of where we served,

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:54.880
and basically you can
see we moved all the way

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:59.880
from Del Norte County in
the north, down to Monterey.

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:05.400
It was amazing to go to these
different geographic regions

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:09.670
and see the differences in the geography,

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:13.610
in the services, in the regional centers,

00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:17.720
and also to see where people
lived in these communities,

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:20.470
and the kinds of supports that they had.

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:22.650
I think we learned a lot,

00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:25.550
and what is different about
this kind of a project

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:27.040
where you go into the community,

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.760
and you go into people's
homes or programs,

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:31.320
is that you are their guest,

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:34.300
and that actually you learn so much more

00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:37.260
by seeing people in the
context of the environment

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.670
with which they work and they live.

00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:43.760
And I think it added a
richness to our ability

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:47.240
to make suggestions and recommendations

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:49.193
on how to improve quality of care.

00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:52.790
I do have to also say, and
give a little shout-out

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:55.120
to the TACT team, because
I've been a member

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:57.680
of the Redwood Coast
Regional Center TACT team,

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:00.310
and I know there's a
number of TACT team folks

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:02.710
here in the audience,
and some of the elements

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:05.560
of our comprehensive consult
were really built upon

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:08.890
some of the components
that we've used for years

00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:11.953
in the TACT team, so good job TACT team.

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:22.480
So the comprehensive consults by topic,

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:25.750
so this is the pie chart that talks about

00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:29.270
what kind of problems we addressed

00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:32.880
with a comprehensive consult,
and the largest number

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:35.100
was a decline in functions,

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:39.240
which is a very non-specific reason,

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:42.285
and really required a deep dive

00:09:42.285 --> 00:09:46.710
into sort of all aspects

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:49.860
of the person's wellbeing, both medical,

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:53.210
psychiatric, environmental, etcetera.

00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:58.060
That was followed by behavioral
issues as one of the,

00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:00.053
as the reason for the consultation.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:05.540
Sometimes followed by a medical
review of recurring symptoms

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:09.070
that did not seem to be resolving

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:11.080
with traditional treatment,

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:15.760
or with lots of different
types of treatment modalities.

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:18.393
Placement issues followed that,

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:23.890
by diagnosis meaning, don't
know what the heck is going on,

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:25.960
and then a small percentage,

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:30.183
a review of the person's
recent hospitalization.

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:37.453
So what is the comprehensive consult?

00:10:39.086 --> 00:10:43.400
The comprehensive consult
is one that the client

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:45.430
is referred by a regional center,

00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:47.040
usually a service coordinator,

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:49.240
or other member of the regional center.

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:53.470
And typically the person
has really complex medical,

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:56.370
behavioral, psychiatric issues,

00:10:56.370 --> 00:11:00.030
that puts them at risk
for losing their placement

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:04.020
in the community, or
needing to go to perhaps,

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:06.050
a higher level of care.

00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:10.250
Our consult, the purpose of the consult

00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:13.730
was to really try to do

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:15.390
a really comprehensive look

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:19.840
at all aspects of that
person's functioning,

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:23.230
and medical, psychiatric,
environmental issues,

00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:26.590
and to come up with
recommendations and suggestions

00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:28.850
that would hopefully help the person

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:30.503
lead a better quality of life.

00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:35.230
Typically, we would
start with an extensive

00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:40.110
medical record review, which
this is not a crisis team,

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:41.970
so we had to plan this,

00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:44.303
generally, a couple months in advance.

00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:49.560
We would take any number

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:50.870
of the whole team,

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:54.103
or depending on what the needs
and the issues identified,

00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:57.580
where we might take just a smaller number

00:11:57.580 --> 00:11:58.790
of the team members,

00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:01.130
but I have to say, every
time we went out there

00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:04.050
without Dr. Ihle or Dr. Collins,

00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:06.530
we would think, God I wish they were here.

00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:10.590
Because there was always
issues with mental health,

00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:13.900
or with general happiness,
and behavioral issues,

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:16.210
and so we really found that

00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:18.907
that was just really a key component.

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:21.800
You want me to hurry up?

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:22.879
Is that, okay?

00:12:22.879 --> 00:12:25.160
- We're running out of time.
- Okay, all right.

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:26.760
Okay, I'm gonna hurry up then.

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:29.520
So, what else do I want to say about that,

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:30.610
nothing, okay.

00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:32.730
So I'm just gonna talk a
little bit about training,

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:35.610
and then I'm gonna pass it on, okay.

00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:36.830
I thought I was hurrying.

00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:39.880
So training, so we did lots of trainings,

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:43.620
the trainings actually
I think were incredibly,

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:45.340
incredibly important in terms of

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:48.410
helping the local
community, the caregivers,

00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:50.540
the ILS staff, and the clients

00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:54.090
actually understand what
resources were available to them.

00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:58.290
We did trainings for, in
hospitals and emergency rooms,

00:12:58.290 --> 00:13:02.180
in ILS groups,

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:05.850
with families and caregivers,

00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:08.200
and the topics are listed here.

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:11.000
I have to say the response
was really wonderful

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.440
to the trainings and I
think most of that material

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:18.060
that we've used is
actually on our website.

00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:20.510
So I think I'm gonna pass it along now,

00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:23.020
'cause I'm getting the,
we've gotta hurry up mode.

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:27.893
And I'm gonna pass this on to Dr. Collins,

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:30.760
who's gonna go next.

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:32.393
Dr. Kripke's gonna go next?

00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:35.410
Well actually I thought it was,

00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:37.314
- Yeah, yeah.
- You're just gonna

00:13:37.314 --> 00:13:39.360
cut to the end?
- Cut to the end.

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:41.590
- Well before you cut to the end though,

00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:42.960
could you just talk a little bit about

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:44.493
the caregiver assessment?

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:47.280
No, okay.

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:48.870
- But you're welcome to stop at our table,

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:50.520
and I'll be happy to fill you in.

00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:52.563
Really, okay,

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:54.583
okay.

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:03.910
- [Dr. Kripke] Okay, great.

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:08.060
We have a lot to say about,

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:09.740
this is a fabulous team,

00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:13.151
and we got started a little late,

00:14:13.151 --> 00:14:14.470
and we don't wanna keep you from lunch,

00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:18.222
so we are going to truncate
what we had to say,

00:14:18.222 --> 00:14:22.430
but some of the unique
features of the program

00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:24.770
include doing caregiver consults,

00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:27.240
which were separate from

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:31.440
the client consults that we did.

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:35.170
We did a lot of work in trauma,

00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:38.170
trauma and trauma
histories were at the basis

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:42.050
of almost every consult that we had,

00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:44.310
and you speak so articulately on this,

00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:46.292
I can't stand it, you have to say it.

00:14:46.292 --> 00:14:47.620
(group laughing)

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:48.990
- [Dr. Collins] I mean
heard a lot this morning

00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:51.100
about trauma, and some of
the things that happened

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:53.350
with a lot of the children.

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:55.910
One of the things that came across

00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:57.180
in a lot of evaluations that we did,

00:14:57.180 --> 00:15:00.940
is that when people got
caught up in the day-to-day

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:04.593
caregiving for individuals with
developmental disabilities.

00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:07.740
What lapsed, or what got forgotten,

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:10.060
or some of the experiences they had.

00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:13.460
And so when we were presented
with situations like,

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:15.530
Johnny will not leave the house,

00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:18.290
or Susan will not eat green food,

00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:21.390
or you know,

00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:23.890
a person is withdrawn and
wouldn't leave their room,

00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:25.440
what had gotten forgotten,

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:28.600
was that their caregiver
suddenly passed away.

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:31.700
Every time someone left the house,

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:33.540
they were being put in restraints,

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:35.830
or they were being moved
to a different facility.

00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:38.360
Every time strangers came to the home,

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:41.280
that meant that something
bad was going to happen.

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:43.812
Every time they interacted with people,

00:15:43.812 --> 00:15:47.290
the reciprocal interaction was negative.

00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:49.460
And so those things were forgotten,

00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:51.060
but all they wanted to happen

00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:54.560
was for us to fix Johnny
leaving the house,

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:56.490
Susan coming out of her room,

00:15:56.490 --> 00:15:58.810
or someone else eating green things.

00:15:58.810 --> 00:16:02.210
And so often times, our
job was to bring back

00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:05.130
into perspective the
entire experience that

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:06.610
that person brought with them,

00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:09.510
so that we can build the
empathy and compassion

00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:12.470
in the care again, so that
in the day-to-day caregiving,

00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:14.060
we didn't forget those things.

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:17.150
So instead of put your hands down,

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:19.480
stop blocking us from leaving the door,

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:23.460
it's gonna be okay, we're not
gonna take you somewhere else,

00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:26.810
you live here forever, we're
just going to your day program.

00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:29.920
Because sometimes those
little changes in tone,

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:33.270
attitude, and approach
made a huge difference

00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:34.830
in the day-to-day functioning

00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:37.130
of the individual that
we were there to serve.

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:43.610
- [Dr. Kripke] And the
richness of these comprehensive

00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:46.460
consults were really to dig
deep into their past history,

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:50.060
not just what the people in
their present lives know,

00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:54.560
but to dig as deeply
as we could to find out

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:56.270
what people's stories were,

00:16:56.270 --> 00:16:58.340
and once you understood that context,

00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:03.250
it really made a huge
difference in their care.

00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:07.720
We focused, the team experimented

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:11.260
with a variety of ways
to create efficiencies,

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:14.010
with the hope that we
could reduce the amount

00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:15.840
of highly skilled labor, travel,

00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:19.580
or resources that we needed
to do solid assessments,

00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:21.390
and to create comprehensive

00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:24.610
and practical sets of recommendations.

00:17:24.610 --> 00:17:28.460
But what we found was that there's really,

00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:31.350
there are no shortcuts, that
this is labor-intensive,

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:35.600
that it takes expertise,
that it takes the whole team,

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:37.680
and that it takes going
to their environment,

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:39.340
we can't do this by telemedicine.

00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:41.490
And we actually serve some people

00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:45.010
that the TACT team had served,
and who provided services to,

00:17:45.010 --> 00:17:46.590
but when we went out there,

00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:48.010
we had a really different perspective,

00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:49.740
and a different set of recommendations

00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:53.150
than when it was done completely remotely.

00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:57.470
So taking the time also, to
write our comprehensive reports

00:17:57.470 --> 00:18:00.790
was very labor-intensive,
but synthesizing that data

00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:04.060
from multiple disciplines
and multiple sources

00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:08.300
was a critical services to
get teams on the same page,

00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:11.300
and to create a common understanding
of what the issues were

00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:14.680
so that people could work
together effectively.

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:18.120
We often thought that we
had a really good idea

00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:19.700
of what was going on with the client

00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:21.940
based on talking to
their case coordinators,

00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:24.840
and doing that comprehensive
review of records,

00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:29.030
which was often a quite thick stack.

00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:33.830
But even the reason for
the consult was different

00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:35.960
when we actually got out there,

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:39.520
even the chief complaint wasn't the same.

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:42.690
And if we don't understand
the nature of the problem,

00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:47.360
like you were alluding to Zoe,
then we can end up spending

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:50.840
an awful lot of resources,
getting very frustrated,

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:55.150
and not providing an
effective service for that,

00:18:55.150 --> 00:18:57.760
so doing that deep dive,

00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:00.190
and finding out what the real issue was,

00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:02.650
often the solutions
weren't that complicated.

00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:06.780
Sometimes they were, they
usually were not more expensive

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:10.340
than what was already being
spent on these clients

00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:13.290
who were the people who were in

00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:15.700
the most difficult situations,

00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:17.100
and so we were already spending

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:18.460
an enormous amount of resources,

00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:21.280
a lot of people were
involved in their care,

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:24.853
but ineffective services
aren't cost-effective ever.

00:19:27.107 --> 00:19:28.710
For example, we were told that somebody

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:31.370
was very highly aggressive,
but what we found was

00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:32.950
that they had a neurological tick,

00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:36.223
and if you happen to get in the
way, it wasn't a good thing.

00:19:37.944 --> 00:19:40.290
And or, we were told that they were sick

00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:41.260
and failing to thrive,

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:43.430
and they were getting very
expensive medical workups,

00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:44.450
and when we got out there,

00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:46.973
we found that there was
no food in their cupboard.

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:52.860
It takes experience, and
expertise to sort out

00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:56.900
clients who have complex
combinations of developmental,

00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:58.840
medical, behavioral, psychiatric,

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:02.480
and environmental issues,
and to tell a coherent story

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:07.310
about where they've been
and to tell a coherent story

00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:08.500
about what needs to be done

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:10.430
to get them where they need to be,

00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:13.273
and there really isn't
a shortcut for that.

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:19.480
And so we were only, in
order to expand the impact

00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:23.810
of our work beyond the
individuals that we worked with,

00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:27.970
we did a lot of follow-up
work that impacted

00:20:27.970 --> 00:20:30.610
the entire community, and
helped to build the workforce,

00:20:30.610 --> 00:20:31.670
which was really the goal.

00:20:31.670 --> 00:20:34.670
For example, a recurring theme

00:20:34.670 --> 00:20:38.840
was that attitudes were a major barrier

00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:43.220
to healthcare access, and we
went to the local hospitals,

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:45.870
and we talked to the
local service providers,

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:49.440
and we empowered the
local service providers

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:54.070
to provide information, and
we met with Grand Rounds,

00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:57.380
we met with the local
providers to really explain

00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:59.740
who people with developmental
disabilities are,

00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:04.740
what their potential is, and
why they should receive care

00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:07.250
and services like anybody else.

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:11.340
We did quite a bit of training,

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:14.090
especially around communication,

00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:16.580
around goals of care conversations,

00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:19.010
and on successful community living,

00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:21.240
and that really changed the relationship

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:23.960
between these healthcare facilities,

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:25.410
and healthcare provider groups,

00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:28.580
and the regional centers,
and their clients.

00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:32.640
We also invited local community clinicians

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:35.290
to come to our comprehensive consults,

00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:38.420
and watch us work with the
patients that they were serving,

00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:40.450
and that they had been struggling through,

00:21:40.450 --> 00:21:43.240
trying to diagnose, and trying to serve,

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:45.190
and went to them,

00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:50.190
and talked to them about
their challenging situations.

00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:52.880
Medical education doesn't, I mean,

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:54.644
this is a fabulous conference,

00:21:54.644 --> 00:21:57.660
and medical articles are great,

00:21:57.660 --> 00:21:59.990
but medical education
is apprenticeship style,

00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:03.550
we have to show people how to do,

00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:04.890
we can't just talk about it,

00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:07.680
we have to show it in
practice with their patients,

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:10.290
in the context that
they're actually practicing

00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:11.690
for people to get better at it.

00:22:11.690 --> 00:22:14.060
And by going out to these communities,

00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:16.190
and doing these consults,
we were able to do that

00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:19.450
kind of very hands-on training,

00:22:19.450 --> 00:22:24.373
and to model what we teach in practice.

00:22:25.716 --> 00:22:30.140
And in terms of systems issues, there is,

00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:34.890
a lot of focus is on the
services that are being provided

00:22:34.890 --> 00:22:37.750
in higher level group homes,
and medically oriented,

00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:40.141
and behaviorally oriented group homes,

00:22:40.141 --> 00:22:44.930
but most of our clients
were not in those homes,

00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:48.180
and most people with
developmental disabilities

00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:49.700
don't live in those homes.

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:54.070
So if you focus solely on the people

00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:55.460
who are living in those homes,

00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:58.200
we're really gonna miss the boat on

00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:02.530
improving healthcare for the population,

00:23:02.530 --> 00:23:05.313
which includes 300,000 people,

00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:08.220
only a handful of which live

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:10.760
in these higher level group homes.

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:13.910
Family, direct support professionals,

00:23:13.910 --> 00:23:18.200
service providers, they're
front-line healthcare workers.

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:22.280
They recognize illness,
they provide the support

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:24.450
when people are accessing medical care,

00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:26.800
they implement the healthcare plans,

00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:30.360
and those people need training,
support, and oversight.

00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:32.290
And when we went into these communities,

00:23:32.290 --> 00:23:34.660
we were able to provide them
with some of that training,

00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:36.600
and support, and encouragement,

00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:40.840
and recognition for the
important role that they have,

00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:42.920
and the important job that they're doing

00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:44.700
that impacts healthcare,

00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:46.780
it's not just about what doctors do,

00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:49.100
it's not just what clinicians do,

00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:50.720
it's not just what nurses do,

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:55.370
it's also those hands-on support people,

00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:58.550
and families that are
making a big difference.

00:23:58.550 --> 00:24:02.750
And we also notice that, in
terms of system problems,

00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:07.410
that we focus so much on these high-level

00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:10.770
group homes that have a lot
of medical resources in them,

00:24:10.770 --> 00:24:15.259
and while they're fabulous,
and necessary, and important,

00:24:15.259 --> 00:24:18.990
a recurrent theme was
that people who don't live

00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:21.230
in those homes, don't have
access to skilled nursing,

00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:23.400
even when they have skilled nursing needs,

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:26.850
and a lot of people are being
forced into institutions,

00:24:26.850 --> 00:24:30.780
into SNFs, into out-of-state placements

00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:34.610
because they don't have
access to skilled nursing

00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:36.180
when they live in supported living,

00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:38.220
when they live in family homes,

00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:42.500
when they live in
behaviorally oriented homes.

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:45.270
Another theme was access
to mental health services

00:24:45.270 --> 00:24:48.640
that have expertise in
developmental disabilities.

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:52.080
There are some fields where
taking care of a person

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:53.500
with a developmental disability,

00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:56.179
isn't that different than
taking care of everybody else,

00:24:56.179 --> 00:25:01.160
but primary care, and
mental and behavioral health

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:04.120
are definitely areas where

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:06.450
special expertise is needed,

00:25:06.450 --> 00:25:11.330
and there is a lack of
access to mental healthcare

00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:14.190
in general, but a tremendous,

00:25:14.190 --> 00:25:18.410
tremendous lack of people
who have actual expertise,

00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:22.090
and we're just so glad to have

00:25:22.090 --> 00:25:26.780
Dr. Ihle on the team, and doing training,

00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:29.890
and providing us with that support,

00:25:29.890 --> 00:25:33.310
because non of the other team
members were able to make

00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:34.720
the kinds of recommendations,

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:39.180
and to make the kinds of
insights that she was able to do,

00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:42.930
that's tremendously important,
and we need to reproduce her.

00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:47.930
And a final thing is around
inter-agency collaboration.

00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:51.110
There's an awful lot of different people,

00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:52.570
whether it's regional centers,

00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:57.570
local medical centers, and hospitals,

00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:01.833
local, the county mental health systems,

00:26:03.010 --> 00:26:06.910
and more, and the direct
service providers,

00:26:06.910 --> 00:26:10.823
the families, the schools, every,

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:14.790
all of those different systems,

00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:17.800
and local service providers too,

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:21.510
the local agencies who
are providing services,

00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:23.090
the parent information training centers,

00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:26.580
all of these people have a
role in promoting health,

00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:30.460
and we need to work together,

00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:32.140
and we need to break down the barriers

00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:34.630
that we're not just
pointing fingers and saying,

00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:35.750
oh, that's your health plan,

00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:37.090
oh, that's the regional center,

00:26:37.090 --> 00:26:38.860
oh, that's county mental health,

00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:41.970
and so that we can not replicate services,

00:26:41.970 --> 00:26:44.320
because a lot of times
each of those agencies

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:46.270
has a different care coordinator,

00:26:46.270 --> 00:26:48.910
and we're doing a lot of duplicate work

00:26:48.910 --> 00:26:50.248
that we could be doing once.

00:26:50.248 --> 00:26:53.020
And then we need to break down,

00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:55.840
make real decisions
about who's responsible

00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:59.520
for what when we have these
complicated situations,

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:02.670
so that we can work as a team,

00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:06.393
not just this team, but
also that community team.

00:27:07.270 --> 00:27:08.103
Thanks.

00:27:09.202 --> 00:27:11.119
- You have two minutes.

00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:19.260
- [Dr. Ihle] I feel that
we're so far behind,

00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:22.277
but I'll just put in a plug
for psychiatry (laughs).

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:28.870
As the discipline that focuses on

00:27:29.930 --> 00:27:33.380
trying to understand whether there are

00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:36.970
neurophysiological underpinnings

00:27:36.970 --> 00:27:38.460
to changes in behavior,

00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:41.140
and the changes in behavior
that we are often asked

00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:43.490
to consult on were either

00:27:44.330 --> 00:27:46.620
decreases in functionality,

00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:51.580
or worsening behavior
in terms of agitation,

00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:54.240
or what was called disruptive behavior.

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:56.300
And if we think about these things

00:27:56.300 --> 00:28:00.600
as manifestations of what the physiology

00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:02.423
of the nervous system is doing,

00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:06.810
then I think that will also
provide additional insights

00:28:06.810 --> 00:28:10.590
that maybe the care providers
hadn't been considering,

00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:14.303
or hadn't been included in the care plans.

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:19.430
- Final words?

00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:23.040
I just want to give a shout-out
to our caregiving team here,

00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:26.870
care provider support
assessment, Pat and Joe,

00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:28.930
did a great job, and I
think that is something

00:28:28.930 --> 00:28:32.990
that often times, not included,

00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:35.360
and actually is a really important part

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:36.980
in terms of someone's health.

00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:39.850
We know the caregiving forces is aging,

00:28:39.850 --> 00:28:43.230
and we know that we need
more good caregivers,

00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:45.420
and they need support

00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:47.570
to do the kind of job
that they have to do.
