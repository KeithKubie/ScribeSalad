00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.600
&gt;&gt; Mary Jane Deeb: [Inaudible]
the chief of the African

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:25.810
and Middle East Division and I'm
delighted to be reading today

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:31.130
to celebrate Jewish
American heritage month.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.040
And we have been doing this
every year and each section

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.280
of the division has done --

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.950
has partnered with the
Jewish Genealogy Society

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.250
of Greater Washington.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.660
So [inaudible] back here
and I met Mary Jane again

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.570
who was part of the society.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.400
And we had [inaudible]
Mary Jane's.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.860
The African Middle East
Division, as you know,

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.200
has [inaudible] section
which connects [inaudible]

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.020
from all over the world.

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.290
[Inaudible] and [inaudible]
from all over the world.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.590
We also have an African section.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.460
I think that all the
countries of Africa

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:19.190
in the [inaudible] section that
goes from Morocco to Afghanistan

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.600
to Central Asia and
the Caucasus.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:29.980
So we do collect widely and
hopefully deeply as well,

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.160
and but the most important
is our specialists.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:38.080
And our specialists are scholars
themselves who know the world,

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:43.650
who know the country, who have
wide network among scholars

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.720
like yourselves, and we
invite them to join us here

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.070
in the library because it is
from the scholars that we learn

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.240
so much about what we hold.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.310
In other words, it's a circle.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.850
You teach us, and we will
[inaudible] the books

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.120
that inform you.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.810
So it's [inaudible].

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.810
And today we have one of
the professor who introduce

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:13.260
by Ms. Horowitz and
[inaudible] but I just wanted

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.730
to read a few things that
was said about the book,

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:24.530
Roads Taken: Jewish Peddlers
and their American Journey.

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.520
And I was searching it
and I found one review.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.280
First of all, it's about the
book, which was a finalist

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:48.690
in the 2015 National Jewish
Book award in the category

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.080
of American Jewish Studies.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:59.090
And it was this time that this
landmark study permanently

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:06.460
changed our perceptions of
the modern Jewish experience

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.930
and Jewish social
and economic history.

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:18.210
It is Jonathan Karp, author of
The Politics of Jewish Commerce,

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:19.510
Economic Thought

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:28.330
and Emancipation in
Europe, 1638-1848.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:33.360
So as this [inaudible] book
and this marvelous account

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.660
of [inaudible] that
was [inaudible] fiction

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.560
in [inaudible] Hasia Diner
imaginatively paces down some

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.130
of the dusty roads in this
Jewish peddler's [inaudible].

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.360
She shows how work, pressure,

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.460
and religious belief
are deeply entwined.

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:54.240
That was Walter Friedman,
author of Birth of a Salesman.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.900
And a third one is
[inaudible] Robin Cohen

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.500
from Oxford University
who describes the book

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.350
as this intensely
researched book

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:03.650
about the underside
Jewish migration

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:04.950
which provides a
[inaudible] account

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.250
of how [inaudible] intervention
[inaudible] influence

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:07.550
your societies.

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:08.850
[Inaudible] is [inaudible].

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:10.150
So now to introduce Hasia
Diner, Professor Diner,

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.490
is our own Ms. Horowitz.

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:14.100
&gt;&gt; Sharon Horowitz: Okay.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.650
Thank you, Mary Jane.

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.820
Let me add my welcome
to everyone.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.040
Yes. I'll try.

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.090
On behalf of the
Jewish Genealogy Society

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.220
of Greater Washington
and the Hebraic section,

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.030
I want to thank you all for
coming to today's program

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.170
in celebration of Jewish
American Heritage Month.

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:41.710
The Hebraic section marked
its beginning in 1912

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.380
with the receipt of
10,000 Hebrew books

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:48.400
and pamphlets whose purchase
was made possible by a gift

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.530
from New York philanthropist
Jacob Schiff.

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.220
From those humble beginnings,
our collections have grown

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:59.000
to around 250,000 items in
Hebrew, Yiddish, Ladino, Judeo,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.510
Persian and other
Hebraic script languages.

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:06.070
The Hebraic section also
includes an important collection

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:09.700
of books in Ge'ez, Amharic
and Tigrinya, the languages

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.830
of Ethiopia past and present.

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.680
Two of our missions
in this division are

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.650
to publicize our collections

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:20.240
and to bring people
into the library.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.840
One way we accomplish
this second goal is

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.220
by holding lectures
and by having programs

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.010
such as the one we are
hosting here today.

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:30.620
Before I introduce today's
speaker, it is my pleasure

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:32.870
to call upon Ms. Sheila Wexler,

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:35.110
President of the
Jewish Genealogy Society

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:39.320
of Greater Washington and one
of today's program's cosponsors,

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.020
to say a few words
about the society.

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:47.550
[ Applause ]

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:49.990
&gt;&gt; Sheila Wexler: Thank you
and this is a pleasure for us

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.820
to be here today and to
sponsor our wonderful speaker.

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:58.520
The Jewish Genealogy Society of
Greater Washington was created

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.250
about 37 years ago,
a little over that,

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:06.290
and the purpose was the interest
in tracing your family tree.

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:07.690
And as time went on, we found

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:10.480
out that our mission
was more than that.

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.050
It was education.

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:15.340
We wanted people to understand
how research was done,

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:18.020
what was the purpose
of doing genealogy,

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.440
and then to go beyond
that, and that was

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:24.130
to understand our families
and those that made

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:26.250
up our ancestral peoples.

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:28.520
Where they came from, how
they lived, what they did

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.740
in the United States, and
how they existed before they

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:34.040
got here.

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:37.730
So it was more than just
getting a name and a date.

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:40.390
And I think we've been
successful with that.

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:43.280
While the focus still
remains on, you know,

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.970
finding your ancestors and
building that family tree,

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:49.020
we've gone beyond that.

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:51.540
And with DNA testing, we're
finding even more people

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:53.480
who are interested in genealogy.

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:57.130
So we're winding up with
more than Jewish members,

00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:59.170
that is those who
identify as Jewish today.

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:01.910
We're winding up with
people from other cultures

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:04.370
who are saying, "I don't
understand why this is showing

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:05.670
up in my DNA."

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:06.970
I had one lady who
came up to me and said,

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:09.940
"I don't understand what
this Iberian thing is."

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:12.880
She's never been [inaudible]
the American Revolution.

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.180
And I said, "Hmm.

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:17.790
Iberian. You know, possibly
you've got a Sephardim,

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:21.250
a Jewish person from
Spain, in your background."

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:23.670
And she just -- then she
proceeded to tell me the story

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:25.880
about a great-great-great
grandmother who,

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.720
on her death bed, started
speaking another language.

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:33.660
So I think you may have
somebody spoke [inaudible].

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:35.670
And she walked away
just shaking her head.

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:39.130
I had a letter from someone
from a university the other day

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:41.010
who was interested in our group.

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:44.310
She has Jamaican background
and said, "Jamaican Jewish?

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:45.990
Is that possible?"

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:49.390
It is. So, you know, we're
finding more and more people

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:51.100
who are interested
because of the DNA.

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:53.930
So we welcome everybody
to come to our meetings.

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:55.230
Become members.

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:57.490
We help each other learn.

00:07:57.490 --> 00:08:00.770
And so it isn't just pick
up the book and you're going

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:02.650
to find your names in there.

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:06.580
It's understand what your
family did when they got here,

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:08.710
and that's what we're so happy

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:15.250
to have Hasia Diner
[inaudible] here with us today.

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:17.490
[ Applause ]

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:19.840
&gt;&gt; Sharon Horowitz: Thank
you very much, Ms. Wexler.

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:22.060
And now a word about
our speaker.

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:25.650
Hasia Diner is the Paul S.
and Sylvia Steinberg Professor

00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:28.030
of American Jewish History
at New York University

00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:31.960
with the joint appointment
in the Departments of History

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:34.630
and the Skirball Department
of Hebrew and Judaic Studies.

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:37.020
She's also the director
of the Goren Center

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:39.050
for American Jewish History.

00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:41.860
Professor Diner is a
specialist in immigration

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:45.060
and ethnic history,
American Jewish history

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:47.040
and the history of
American women.

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:49.650
She has published a great
deal on these topics

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:51.280
and has lectured widely.

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:55.650
We are indeed fortunate to
have her with us here today.

00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:58.110
Two items of business
before we begin.

00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:01.510
Professor Diner's book
will be available for sale

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:05.590
and that she will be
signing in the back.

00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:07.830
And this event is
being videotaped

00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:09.570
for subsequent broadcasting.

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:12.190
There will be a formal
question and answer period

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:15.440
after the lecture, at which
the audience is encouraged

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:17.410

00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:35.510
And now please join me in
welcoming Professor Hasia Diner.

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:40.720
[ Applause ]

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.020
&gt;&gt; Hasia Diner: Okay.

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:44.490
Let me get myself situated here.

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:52.550
Okay. Just take a second.

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:56.200
Okay great.

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:59.210
Well, so I want to
thank [inaudible]

00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:02.120
and the Jewish Genealogical
Society

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:05.110
for inviting me to this talk.

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:09.850
Okay. I want to thank the
Jewish Genealogical Society

00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:13.090
for inviting me and
-- how about that?

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:14.430
Is that better?

00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:16.900
Okay. Then let's see what I'm
going to do with my notes.

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:18.200
Okay. I should be fine.

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.900
Okay. Thank you.

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:23.840
Let me just begin very
quickly by saying this is a bit

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:26.870
of a homecoming for me
because I began my career

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:33.000
as a graduate student sitting
in the reading room for months

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.210
on end and then in the Hebraica
room working on my dissertation

00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:40.990
and on a number of
subsequent projects.

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:43.740
And there was a time in
which I'd say the Library

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:45.960
of Congress was my
home away from home.

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:50.030
And it was a tremendous
privilege for me,

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:55.390
as a both young and not so
young scholar to have on the --

00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:58.590
a tremendous riches,
unimaginable riches

00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:01.140
of this constitution
at my command.

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:05.880
So I thank the library
for making my career.

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:07.760
So let me begin.

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:13.810
Israel Abrams, a scholar at
Cambridge University writing

00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:17.850
in the 1890s, like many
other Jewish intellectuals

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:23.600
of his time, saw in the study of
history a way to defend the Jews

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:26.070
against scurrilous attacks.

00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:31.310
In 1896 in his probably
most famous book,

00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:35.520
Jewish Life in the Middle
Ages, in a chapter on trades

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:39.290
and occupations, he directly
challenged the French writer

00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:45.090
[inaudible] who the year
before in his book had asserted

00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:47.800
that Jews were cowards.

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:50.210
You know, there's
an air quote there.

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:52.730
They were cowards
because they, quote,

00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:57.740
"shunned arduous physical
undertakings and were averse

00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:01.450
to dangerous occupations."

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:07.760
Abrams countered this
directly, and in his words,

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:12.360
the Jewish peddler of recent
centuries was no coward.

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:17.640
Had he lacked courage, he
must have remained at home.

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:21.060
We're going to use Abrams
words as a way to --

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:25.850
as a point of entry to thinking
about the historic significant

00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:31.540
of peddling and its connection
to the transformative phenomenon

00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:35.900
of Jewish migrations
in the modern period.

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:39.750
Going out on the road laden
with a jumble of goods,

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:43.370
sometimes specializing in
a particular type of wear,

00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:45.900
was a profound binding

00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:49.540
and nearly universal
Jewish experience in the --

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:53.160
what we now, as historians,
call the long 19th century,

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:55.310
starting in the late
18th century

00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:59.020
and going into the 1920s.

00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:02.930
Not that all Jews peddled,
but rather so many did

00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:05.270
in the modern history
of the Jewish people

00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:08.090
that it provided the
central pivotal --

00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:10.520
that it played a
central pivotal role

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:14.230
in shaping new Jewish
communities.

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:16.390
Jewish migrations
out of familiar

00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:20.210
but economically declining
regions to new lands wide open

00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:23.210
for settlement and
business, opened up because

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:27.680
of colonial expansion and
the spread of capitalism,

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:34.470
made it possible for Jewish
peddlers to take to the road.

00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:40.170
Peddlers very ordinary
prosaic, peripatetic figures,

00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:42.960
who unfortunately left
us very little in the way

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:46.240
of a paper trail,
served as the juggernauts

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:50.330
for the Jewish migration,
Jewish migrations.

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:53.480
Their experiences on the
road as the human engines

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:57.200
that drove the massive Jewish
population shift, which brought

00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:00.680
over four-and-a-half
million Jews out of central

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:05.740
and eastern Europe as well
as the Ottoman Empire,

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:11.360
to new lands, deserves to be
thought of in historical --

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:13.450
in a historical context.

00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:18.060
Now, before I go on, I want
to make three points that --

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:21.490
just to serve as
an introduction.

00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:23.500
First, who was a peddler?

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:28.520
And probably if I asked how
many -- in fact, let me do that.

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:30.510
How many people here
had peddlers

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:33.090
in their family background?

00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:37.550
Okay. So it's really
common, and the older we are,

00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:41.290
the more likely that
we had a grandfather,

00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:45.180
a great grandfather, an uncle,
a great uncle who did this.

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:48.560
I'm going to be looking
at, and in the book,

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:53.900
I look at those men, and these
are all men, and ironically

00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:58.120
for me, as somebody who defines
herself as a women's historian,

00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:00.370
I ended up writing
a book about men,

00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:04.110
although women play a very
important role in this story.

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:06.420
And you'll see this
very shortly.

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:12.370
The men who I'm looking at were
peddlers who were on the road,

00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:18.490
who on Sunday morning or Monday
morning, slung their pack

00:15:18.490 --> 00:15:22.950
on their backs or got up
in a wagon behind a horse,

00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:26.460
an ox, a mule, and went out.

00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:31.770
And they didn't return to Jewish
settlement, be it their homes

00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:35.640
or boarding house or some
other place of residence

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:40.430
in a Jewish community,
until Friday.

00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:42.690
So they were on the
road all week.

00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:47.350
And so as such, I am not dealing
with urban peddlers, okay?

00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:52.960
The men and women who hawk
their wares in the city streets

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:55.330
but in the evening went
back to their own homes,

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:56.660
their own communities.

00:15:56.660 --> 00:16:01.180
They had an amazing history
also all over the world

00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:06.610
and their story needs to be
examined, but I didn't do that.

00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:09.040
So urban peddlers
are not my subject.

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:14.000
Secondly, I want to note that
Jews were not the only peddlers

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.960
in America or in the
many other places

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:18.260
that I'm going to mention.

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:23.830
In the context of U.S.
history, in the early republic,

00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:27.950
there was the stock figure
of the Yankee peddler.

00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:34.330
Young men from declining
New England towns who fanned

00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:37.850
out to Western Massachusetts,
to upstate New York,

00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:39.990
to the south, to the Midwest.

00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:44.340
And notably, all the terrible
things that were later on said

00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:47.840
about Jewish peddlers
were exactly what was said

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:50.440
about Yankee peddlers, okay?

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:53.420
So it's maybe their
peddling that caused the ire

00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:58.990
of some people around them and
not if they were Jewish or not.

00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:01.070
Okay. So there was
the Yankee peddler.

00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:03.470
There were German
immigrants who peddled.

00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:06.030
There were some Irish
immigrants who peddled.

00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:10.760
The only other group,
in which for the, again,

00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:12.400
this long 19th century,

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:16.470
whose migration we could say
was shaped by peddling or Arabs.

00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:19.630
Okay. And these were
primarily young men coming

00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:23.190
from what was then referred
to as Syria, Lebanon.

00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:27.060
So these were primarily
Christian Lebanese who went

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:30.200
to some of the same places
the Jewish peddlers went to.

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:34.050
And they, like the
Jewish peddlers,

00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:35.770
functioned in a migration
process

00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:40.930
in which peddling was literally
the engine that drove migration.

00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:43.230
And their story also
needs to be told,

00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:46.810
and some good historian will
make some nice comparisons

00:17:46.810 --> 00:17:50.580
to find either similarities
or differences

00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:52.640
between Arab peddling
and Jewish peddling.

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:55.860
Again, I didn't do that
but somebody who has access

00:17:55.860 --> 00:18:00.550
to the languages of the Lebanese
peddlers surely should do that.

00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:03.870
Okay. And then finally which
will get me into the heart

00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:08.280
of my talk, Jewish
peddling was not new

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:10.780
in the long 19th century.

00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:13.910
Jews had been peddling
for centuries back

00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:21.420
to the middle ages, and the
existence of Jews on the road

00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:26.690
in all over Europe as well
as in the Ottoman Empire,

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:32.920
was a fixture of Jewish
history well before my period

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:36.060
and their story also
deserves to be written about.

00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:38.770
But I was interested in the way

00:18:38.770 --> 00:18:42.650
in which peddling shaped
the Jewish migration

00:18:42.650 --> 00:18:49.400
out of their old world into
their new -- the new one.

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:52.460
And the way in which starting
in the late 18th century,

00:18:52.460 --> 00:19:01.130
peddling provided the startup by
which Jews discovered a number

00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:04.880
of new worlds with peddling
linking their movement

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:10.440
out to some place -- from
some places and into others.

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:13.620
So let me say something
about the places they left.

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:19.380
So we could say on the one
hand, Jewish men left all

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:23.330
of the European continent,
from Alsace in the west,

00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:26.230
all the way through
to the Ukraine.

00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:31.560
Young Jewish men seeking
to leave their homes picked

00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:35.380
up the idea of peddling.

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:39.430
Some places sent a much
larger percentage of peddlers

00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:41.730
out than others, and I
could tell you the numbers

00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:43.030
are elusive.

00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:44.330
Okay. We -- you may be

00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:45.640
in the question [inaudible] I'll
tell you [inaudible] I'll talk

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:47.850
about why it's very
hard to know how many.

00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:53.020
But places like Bavaria was a
very large sender of peddlers

00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:58.960
as was Romania, Posen --
that is that part of --

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:01.770
perhaps I don't need to tell the
genealogists where Posen was.

00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:07.140
That is that part of Poland
that was sucked into Prussia.

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:11.500
Lithuania was probably
the largest sender

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:16.600
of Jewish peddlers on the
European continent, okay?

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:17.900
And the stock figure

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:21.820
of the Lithuanian
Jewish peddler is a kind

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:25.180
of universal new
world phenomenon.

00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:26.890
So they left every place.

00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:30.440
And all of these
places were spots

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:32.330
and then also the
Ottoman Empire and again

00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:36.380
with particular communities
sending larger

00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:41.310
or smaller numbers of
young men out as peddlers.

00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:46.900
They went to nearly every
place in the new world.

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:49.600
Okay. Now I'm going to
distinguish two kinds

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:52.790
of new worlds for
the Jewish peddlers.

00:20:52.790 --> 00:20:55.280
So on the one hand,
they went to places

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:59.050
that we would not
ordinarily think of as, quote,

00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:05.310
the new world, because
they were still in Europe.

00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:09.060
But they were places that were
experiencing the expansion

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:11.520
of capitalism and in

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:15.080
which ordinary people now
had cash to buy things.

00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:20.190
So the migration of Jews out
of Poland, parts of Bavaria,

00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:22.340
to the British Isles, okay?

00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:26.960
Not only to England and
the English countryside.

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:32.690
To Wales, Scotland, Ireland,
okay, were fostered by peddling.

00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:34.800
So these are places that
are actually also sending

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:37.420
out immigrants, okay?

00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:41.190
Jewish peddlers from Lithuania
are also showing up in Sweden

00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:44.050
in the 1860s and 1870s.

00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:48.790
And what makes the
British Isles and Sweden,

00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:51.170
what holds them together
vis-a-vis Jewish history,

00:21:51.170 --> 00:21:54.300
and why I think -- I
consider them new worlds,

00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:55.890
is that these are places

00:21:55.890 --> 00:22:01.290
that had had no substantial
Jewish presence before.

00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:02.590
So the young Jewish --

00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:05.910
Lithuanian Jewish men from
the province of Kovno,

00:22:05.910 --> 00:22:11.230
who show up in Ireland, okay,
starting in the 1870s and 1880s,

00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:14.280
went to a place where there
had never been Jews before.

00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:17.360
So to them, as Jews,
it was a new world.

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:19.940
But other than that,
other than those spots

00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:21.970
in what we may have
called the old new world

00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:26.560
or the new old world, for the
Jews, Jewish peddlers went

00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:30.480
to no fewer places
than the Americas --

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:33.450
north, south, central,
as well as the Caribbean,

00:22:33.450 --> 00:22:38.490
Southern Africa, and
Australia and New Zealand.

00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:43.330
All over that new world, part
of the colonial expansion

00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:47.200
of Europe, drew Jewish peddlers.

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:50.020
The activities of the
peddlers cleared the ground

00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:51.390
for the eventual formation

00:22:51.390 --> 00:22:55.170
of settled Jewish
communities in many places.

00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:58.500
In other places, the
peddlers did not stay

00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:01.410
but moved on elsewhere.

00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:06.740
So, again, I'm going to throw
out a series of questions or --

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:10.060
that will form in a way
almost the bulk of the talk.

00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:12.630
So, first, what did they sell?

00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:16.210
Okay. Notably, it didn't
matter if I'm thinking about --

00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:18.790
and I have documentation
about a Jewish --

00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:22.400
a Lithuanian Jew who shows
up in Sweden or one who shows

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:26.770
up in the Cape Colony in what
will become South Africa,

00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:32.770
if they show up in Mississippi
or in the Pacific Northwest

00:23:32.770 --> 00:23:36.590
in Jamaica, in the
Irish Midlands.

00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:41.490
They sold goods that we would
say were not necessities.

00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:45.170
They didn't sell food,
they didn't sell fuel.

00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:48.180
Because really those are the
two things one needs to survive.

00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:51.270
But they sold a class of goods

00:23:51.270 --> 00:23:54.470
that one historian
has called popu-lux.

00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:56.240
Popular luxuries.

00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:59.130
Now, they're goods that we
would not consider luxuries,

00:23:59.130 --> 00:24:05.940
like eyeglasses, needles,
threads, mirrors, pictures

00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:11.210
and picture frames to put up on
the wall, bed linens, towels,

00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:14.350
napkins, tablecloths, okay?

00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:16.200
So these were goods

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:18.520
that theoretically one
could live without.

00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:22.000
One doesn't need to have
pictures on your wall

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:28.030
or you don't need to have a
mirror or even eyeglasses,

00:24:28.030 --> 00:24:31.390
although every time I read about
a peddler selling eyeglasses

00:24:31.390 --> 00:24:32.690
and the customer would say,

00:24:32.690 --> 00:24:36.440
"This is the first
time I've had glasses."

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:39.130
I thought for me, my God, I'd
be paralyzed without my glasses.

00:24:39.130 --> 00:24:43.280
These are people who are
entering into a new economic

00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:47.540
and social mode and having
glasses was something

00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:50.320
that opened up their eyes.

00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:53.550
Okay. There's a wonderful
memoir by a man

00:24:53.550 --> 00:24:56.450
who became the president
of Colombia South America.

00:24:56.450 --> 00:25:00.250
And he had grown up in a
small town and he said,

00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:03.170
"Until the Jewish peddlers
came into our town,

00:25:03.170 --> 00:25:07.570
no peasant in this town
ever owned a pair of shoes."

00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:12.730
Okay. And, again, one
can say a bit, I think,

00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:18.430
maybe imaginatively, the world
felt literally different having

00:25:18.430 --> 00:25:21.610
those shoes for the first time.

00:25:21.610 --> 00:25:26.440
What is notable is that the
peddlers sold goods to women.

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:29.350
Their customers were all women.

00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:31.290
The men were off working.

00:25:31.290 --> 00:25:33.430
The peddler comes
during the day.

00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:39.270
He established a business
connection with the wives

00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:48.190
of farmers, miners, loggers,
mail workers, suburbanites,

00:25:48.190 --> 00:25:53.520
steel workers, Native people
on -- living on reservations,

00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:57.540
the workers in sugar cane
plantations, rubber plantations,

00:25:57.540 --> 00:26:01.050
on American slave plantations,
American cotton plantations

00:26:01.050 --> 00:26:02.590
and tobacco plantations.

00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:05.950
The peddler established the
relationship with the women

00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:11.380
as they sold the kind of goods
that were within women's domain.

00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:17.500
So one of the very poignant
sort of details that emerged is

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:21.520
that in places like Cuba,
in Jamaica, and elsewhere

00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:26.220
in Central America, the
peddlers sold neckties

00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:30.470
and cloth handkerchiefs
to the wives

00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:33.260
of sugar cane plantation
workers.

00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:36.180
And while they leave us
very little information

00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:40.600
about what went on between
customer and peddler,

00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:45.580
one can get the sense
that for that woman

00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:49.720
to buy her husband the
necktie or suspenders meant

00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:52.550
that her husband on, let's
say Sunday, when they went

00:26:52.550 --> 00:26:54.430
to church, could look good.

00:26:54.430 --> 00:26:58.070
He didn't look like
a plantation worker.

00:26:58.070 --> 00:27:01.400
He was going to now have a
tie and a cloth handkerchief

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:09.930
in his pocket and look no
poorer, no less subservient

00:27:09.930 --> 00:27:14.040
than possibly the owner of
the sugar cane plantation.

00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:16.370
So wherever the peddlers went,

00:27:16.370 --> 00:27:20.160
they sold this category
of goods.

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:23.210
Most of them began by being
pack peddlers with packs

00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:27.720
on their backs and
their first purchase

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:34.130
with some saved money was to get
a cart, okay, possibly bought

00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:38.310
or rented with some
kind of draft animal,

00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:41.970
depending on what animals were
being used in that region.

00:27:41.970 --> 00:27:47.080
And then the peddler could carry
larger goods, perhaps stoves

00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:55.290
or other kinds of items
for the home furniture

00:27:55.290 --> 00:27:59.510
so that it expanded
what he could sell.

00:27:59.510 --> 00:28:03.740
Interestingly, in
many places, peddlers,

00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:07.720
once they had their wagon, began
carrying photographic equipment.

00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:10.610
And so when they would come
into a home, they'd say,

00:28:10.610 --> 00:28:13.920
"Would you like to have a
portrait -- a picture taken?"

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:17.540
Now, again, we could see
this leap into luxury

00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:22.720
for a poor family to think that,
yes, let's have a photograph

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:26.660
of all of us to put
up on our wall.

00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:31.220
As part of this move
upward to having a wagon

00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:35.000
with a draft animal,
many of the peddlers,

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.160
as they made their route,

00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:39.820
entered into business
relationships with the women

00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:45.160
to whom they sold, and
created a connection

00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:50.000
where the woman would bond --
during the week, and I'm going

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.510
to turn to the -- kind of
the calendrical pattern here.

00:28:53.510 --> 00:28:56.430
During the week, the
woman would spend some

00:28:56.430 --> 00:29:03.250
of her time collecting feathers,
bones, scraps of paper,

00:29:03.250 --> 00:29:08.000
scraps of leather, fabric
that had been thrown out.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.070
Sometimes they collected herbs.

00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:14.270
And they would then
exchange these to the peddler

00:29:14.270 --> 00:29:21.510
when he came back, often in
exchange for a certain amount

00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:28.360
of feathers, okay, or bones
in exchange for a watch

00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:30.970
or a necklace or some
other -- a broach.

00:29:30.970 --> 00:29:35.380
Some other kind of a piece
of jewelry or whatever good

00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:37.950
that the woman might want.

00:29:37.950 --> 00:29:41.180
Okay. The peddler
would then sell the --

00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:46.930
what was essentially refuse,
okay, to manufacturers

00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:52.150
who would buy the old bones
to grind up for fertilizer

00:29:52.150 --> 00:29:54.160
or for -- use it
to make buttons.

00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:57.370
The feathers might
be used by somebody

00:29:57.370 --> 00:30:00.750
who was going to
make mattresses.

00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:06.080
The old scraps of paper
could be used for beating

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:09.330
down into some kind
of other good.

00:30:09.330 --> 00:30:12.470
We might call them kind
of early recyclers, okay,

00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:14.600
which is not what
they were called.

00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:18.630
Not surprisingly, many peddlers
around the United States,

00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:20.610
as well as elsewhere
in the world,

00:30:20.610 --> 00:30:22.890
when they ceased peddling,

00:30:22.890 --> 00:30:25.990
became the owners
of junkyards, okay?

00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:31.270
Of scrap metal yards
because they had already been

00:30:31.270 --> 00:30:32.910
in this business.

00:30:32.910 --> 00:30:35.400
So this is what they sold.

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:39.370
I've already indicated that
they tended to sell to farmers,

00:30:39.370 --> 00:30:45.870
to suburbanites, to textile
mill workers, miners, loggers.

00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:49.190
They -- many peddlers
got the license to go

00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:54.620
onto the Indian reservations
in the American west.

00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:59.060
And these were usually
people who had limited money,

00:30:59.060 --> 00:31:04.620
who had no access to stores
and to the marketplace.

00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:09.430
So the peddler came to
where the customers were.

00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:12.160
The peddlers, wherever
they went,

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:15.040
sold on a -- the
installment plan.

00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:19.040
So I don't know, maybe my
glasses would be a dollar.

00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:21.690
Okay. Probably not.

00:31:21.690 --> 00:31:23.840
At least these weren't.

00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:28.520
And so the customer might
pay a nickel, five cents.

00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:32.690
And then he would come
back, however many weeks,

00:31:32.690 --> 00:31:37.940
to collect on the rest
that was owed with the hope

00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:43.270
that each time he came, she
might look in his bag and say,

00:31:43.270 --> 00:31:49.030
"Oh, I see now you're also
carrying eight watches.

00:31:49.030 --> 00:31:50.730
I could use one of those also."

00:31:50.730 --> 00:31:53.290
Or, "I'd like my husband
to have one also."

00:31:53.290 --> 00:31:56.790
So selling on the installment
plan not only helped the

00:31:56.790 --> 00:31:59.640
customer, because the
customer was relatively poor,

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:04.930
but it also helped the peddler
because it expanded the number

00:32:04.930 --> 00:32:08.500
of weeks to which he
would go to that home.

00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:11.800
Peddlers had a specific
route, okay?

00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:14.770
And the route was given to
them by their wholesaler

00:32:14.770 --> 00:32:17.870
or their retailer, the
person who outfitted them,

00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:21.360
who was almost always
-- I would --

00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:23.100
in fact, maybe I would
take out the word almost.

00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:26.750
Who was always another
Jew who was a shopkeeper

00:32:26.750 --> 00:32:30.490
or who owned a peddler
warehouse or who owned some kind

00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:35.690
of business stationary
enterprise that wholesaler,

00:32:35.690 --> 00:32:39.900
retailer outfitter of the
peddler gave new immigrants,

00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:41.200
because it's only Jewish --

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:43.710
it's only immigrants in
this Jewish population

00:32:43.710 --> 00:32:47.360
who are peddling, would
give him the first bundle

00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:49.540
of goods interest free.

00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:54.160
I mean, this is a Jewish --
traditional Jewish obligation

00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:58.150
of [inaudible] the loan
has to be interest-free.

00:32:58.150 --> 00:33:03.340
And then every week, the
peddler would come back to --

00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:05.870
for the weekend, the Sabbath.

00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:09.010
Although if I call it, say
they came back for the Sabbath,

00:33:09.010 --> 00:33:12.300
it implies they came back to
engage in religious activities,

00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:13.600
which maybe they didn't.

00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:14.900
Some did. Some didn't.

00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:18.790
But Saturday night around
the peddler's world,

00:33:18.790 --> 00:33:22.830
the peddler came
to the wholesaler,

00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:29.360
paid him that which was due to
him, loaded up with a new bundle

00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:35.970
of goods and then Sunday morning
went back out on the road again.

00:33:35.970 --> 00:33:40.980
So this weekly cycle was built
into the lives of the peddlers.

00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:45.340
In England, they were often
referred to among themselves

00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:48.430
as Wochers, okay,
using the Yiddish word

00:33:48.430 --> 00:33:51.560
or German word of woche, a week.

00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:54.690
In Ireland, they were
called weekly men,

00:33:54.690 --> 00:33:58.810
and in Irish materials, the --

00:33:58.810 --> 00:34:02.300
whoever the memoirist or
whatever, the newspaper,

00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:04.990
would [inaudible] weekly men.

00:34:04.990 --> 00:34:06.770
The weekly man was here.

00:34:06.770 --> 00:34:10.500
Okay. In parts of South
America, we had evidence

00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:13.070
that they were referred
to as semananics.

00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:16.540
So there you have the
semana, the Spanish for week,

00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:22.630
and then the nic as a
kind of Yiddish sort

00:34:22.630 --> 00:34:25.870
of suffix to the word.

00:34:25.870 --> 00:34:28.450
So peddlers worked with the --

00:34:28.450 --> 00:34:35.670
or they began with the
wholesaler, the supplier,

00:34:35.670 --> 00:34:38.570
a supplier who was
the shopkeeper

00:34:38.570 --> 00:34:40.690
in a town or in a large city.

00:34:40.690 --> 00:34:44.380
Okay. He may be the owner
of a peddler warehouse.

00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:47.230
Had numerous peddlers more --

00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:49.780
numerous peddlers
working for him.

00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:52.410
And each peddler
was giving a route.

00:34:52.410 --> 00:34:55.600
Okay. And they in fact
referred to the route

00:34:55.600 --> 00:35:00.160
as their medina,
okay, their state.

00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:02.950
Okay. Peddlers could not
compete with each other.

00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:07.480
They could not encroach
on each other's medina.

00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:13.060
Why? Because the wholesaler
didn't want competition among

00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:17.880
the peddlers, but rather
the more peddlers who worked

00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:22.480
from this shop or that
shop, this warehouse

00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:28.580
or that warehouse, the more
the wholesaler made a profit.

00:35:28.580 --> 00:35:32.540
So the weekly cycle,
the connection to a node

00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:37.490
of Jewish life, from which
the peddler got his goods,

00:35:37.490 --> 00:35:42.750
and to which he returned
at the end of the week.

00:35:42.750 --> 00:35:49.900
Now, so this is again how they
sold, this is what they sold,

00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:52.440
this is how they
got their goods,

00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:55.870
but the obvious middle
part of this is --

00:35:55.870 --> 00:35:57.940
oh, let me actually
add one other thing.

00:35:57.940 --> 00:36:00.220
The -- particularly for
the brand new immigrant

00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:09.600
who didn't know Swedish
or English, Ute or French,

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:15.420
many in Quebec, or whatever
other language was the dominant

00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:20.210
language, the wholesaler,
who's now somebody who's been

00:36:20.210 --> 00:36:24.200
in the destination land for
five years, 10 years, whatever,

00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:27.410
would give the new peddler a
piece of paper, a crib sheet

00:36:27.410 --> 00:36:29.370
like we all used in high school

00:36:29.370 --> 00:36:31.230
when we were studying
some foreign language.

00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:35.280
We kept it under our notebook so
we could get through the test.

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:40.890
Written out in Yiddish
characters or for the peddlers

00:36:40.890 --> 00:36:43.610
from the Balkans, many of
whom go to South America

00:36:43.610 --> 00:36:48.110
in particular, he
would write out in --

00:36:48.110 --> 00:36:52.120
let's make an English -- going
to an English-speaking land,

00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:55.140
in Yiddish characters
or Hebrew characters,

00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:58.050
"Good morning, ma'am.

00:36:58.050 --> 00:37:00.370
How are you?

00:37:00.370 --> 00:37:03.450
Would you like to
look in my bag?"

00:37:03.450 --> 00:37:08.560
Okay. And then over the course
of weeks, months, years,

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:13.140
the peddler had no choice but to
develop his linguistic skills.

00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:14.850
Many of them peddled in places

00:37:14.850 --> 00:37:17.990
where there were multiple
languages being spoken,

00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:22.350
so the peddler in parts
of Quebec were selling

00:37:22.350 --> 00:37:27.900
to English speakers and
French speakers, okay?

00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:30.620
Peddlers, almost all of
them came from Lithuania,

00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:33.580
who went to Southern
Africa, who were selling

00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:37.410
to English speakers,
Afrikaan speakers,

00:37:37.410 --> 00:37:44.340
as well as the speakers of
the various African languages

00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:47.100
that were spoken by the people

00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:50.330
who had preceded either the
English or the Afrikaaner

00:37:50.330 --> 00:37:54.800
so that the crib sheet
might have three languages

00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:56.670
or five languages.

00:37:56.670 --> 00:37:57.970
Okay. Now, I think one

00:37:57.970 --> 00:38:01.600
of the interesting
phenomenon involved here is

00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:05.130
that many Jews came from places
where they had always had

00:38:05.130 --> 00:38:08.710
to have some level
of polylingualism

00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:12.290
because they may have sold to
Lithuanians, to Polish speakers,

00:38:12.290 --> 00:38:17.230
to German speakers, and while
one might be hard pressed

00:38:17.230 --> 00:38:20.490
to say they actually spoke
Lithuanian or spoke Polish,

00:38:20.490 --> 00:38:23.690
they knew enough
to buy and sell.

00:38:23.690 --> 00:38:27.890
And so this was not a great
leap to move from that

00:38:27.890 --> 00:38:32.140
to learning English,
Spanish, and Navajo, okay,

00:38:32.140 --> 00:38:35.630
or whatever combination
of languages were required

00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:40.530
in that particular medina
to which the peddler went.

00:38:40.530 --> 00:38:46.360
So from the peddler's point
of view, this was a great way

00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:49.840
to get started in a new land.

00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:53.840
It may have been a great way
but it was also very difficult.

00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:55.700
And I'm just going to read
you one quote and this is

00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:59.840
from a man named Abraham
Cohn who came from Bavaria

00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:06.740
in the 1840s, and he
fortunately left us a diary.

00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:12.270
And he wrote very eloquently --
almost too eloquent to read this

00:39:12.270 --> 00:39:14.480
since it's not a poetry reading.

00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:16.950
"Beware oh youth of Bavaria

00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:20.970
for you shall rue the hour
you embarked for this country

00:39:20.970 --> 00:39:23.870
and a life far different
what you dreamed of.

00:39:23.870 --> 00:39:26.980
This land -- " and he was
in western Massachusetts.

00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:29.350
"This land and particularly
this calling,

00:39:29.350 --> 00:39:35.670
being a peddler offers harsh,
cold air, great masses of snow,

00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:38.780
cold towards foreigners
and to all

00:39:38.780 --> 00:39:41.960
who do not speak the
language perfectly."

00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:44.270
Okay. Again, this could have
been a young Lithuanian man

00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:52.010
going through, traipsing around
the transmal or a Hungarian Jew

00:39:52.010 --> 00:39:56.640
in the Australian outback.

00:39:56.640 --> 00:40:01.010
The descriptions we have of
the misery, the heat, the cold,

00:40:01.010 --> 00:40:07.470
the snow, the burning
sun, the muck, the mud,

00:40:07.470 --> 00:40:10.970
was a universal trope.

00:40:10.970 --> 00:40:16.500
I should also say that peddlers
were robbed left and right

00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:19.510
because they were men on the
road with money and goods.

00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:24.040
And I saw no evidence of
them ever arming themselves.

00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:28.130
There were some peddler murders
and there were enough that --

00:40:28.130 --> 00:40:30.390
that's actually one of
my best paper trails,

00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:33.060
where when peddlers
were murdered

00:40:33.060 --> 00:40:37.880
and the state then
came in to investigate.

00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:40.630
So then I could find out in
my research who were they,

00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:42.910
where were they from,
what goods did they carry,

00:40:42.910 --> 00:40:45.210
how did their customers
feel about them,

00:40:45.210 --> 00:40:49.000
who were their suppliers
and the like.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.300
So so far, this is --
everything I've said has been

00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:53.830
about the peddlers.

00:40:53.830 --> 00:40:58.340
But the important link in the
story between the peddlers

00:40:58.340 --> 00:41:01.920
and the suppliers are
the customers, okay?

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:06.530
The women whose homes,
the peddler --

00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:11.630
whose threshold the peddler
crossed in order to sell.

00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:15.620
And from all accounts, and as
you could imagine there's body.

00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:19.250
There's nothing consistent about
where one can get reactions

00:41:19.250 --> 00:41:24.620
of the customers to
the peddlers, they --

00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:29.210
it seems to have been an
extremely positive encounter

00:41:29.210 --> 00:41:32.690
for women living
in remote places,

00:41:32.690 --> 00:41:36.350
for women who couldn't
get credit in stores,

00:41:36.350 --> 00:41:38.120
who couldn't get to the stores.

00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:41.410
The idea of this man
coming into their home

00:41:41.410 --> 00:41:45.420
and offering them the eyeglasses
or the shoes or the neckties

00:41:45.420 --> 00:41:51.330
or the picture frames was
an absolutely wonderful way

00:41:51.330 --> 00:41:55.210
to enhance their own lives,
to announce their status

00:41:55.210 --> 00:41:58.010
as somebody who could
afford to have eyeglasses

00:41:58.010 --> 00:42:02.750
or picture frames or
tablecloths and the like.

00:42:02.750 --> 00:42:09.450
Some memoirs give us evidence
of very positive exchanges

00:42:09.450 --> 00:42:12.830
between peddlers and customers.

00:42:12.830 --> 00:42:15.990
So one of my very
favorites was a book

00:42:15.990 --> 00:42:19.640
by an African-American
social worker

00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:22.740
and dietician named
J. Ida Jiggetts.

00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:27.330
And she grew up in a small
town in the south and she said,

00:42:27.330 --> 00:42:30.570
"The best day of the week was
when the Jewish peddler came

00:42:30.570 --> 00:42:35.770
to our home and he would take
wonderous things out of his bag

00:42:35.770 --> 00:42:39.240
and explain to us where
these goods came from."

00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:42.050
And her father happened
to have been a minister

00:42:42.050 --> 00:42:45.320
and seemingly he was home
when the peddler came.

00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:48.640
It was not just selling
to the -- to his wife.

00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:51.750
But the father, J.
Ida Jiggetts' father,

00:42:51.750 --> 00:42:54.320
entered into an arrangement
with the peddler.

00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:59.700
"I'll buy something but you
have to teach me a Hebrew word."

00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:06.320
Okay. So that she went on to
say the day he came, he --

00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:10.320
or when he came, he
reminded us of Santa Claus

00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:14.590
because who else comes
bearing gifts into your home.

00:43:14.590 --> 00:43:17.590
The peddlers, because I've
already told you had this weekly

00:43:17.590 --> 00:43:23.630
cycle, the obvious question
was, well, where did they sleep

00:43:23.630 --> 00:43:25.640
and where did they eat?

00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:30.700
Okay. So the peddlers for the
most part slept in the home

00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:33.490
of the last customer of the day.

00:43:33.490 --> 00:43:38.090
They talked about
arranging their medina

00:43:38.090 --> 00:43:41.730
so that the last customer
was the nicest, okay?

00:43:41.730 --> 00:43:43.970
And that the person
would give them a bed,

00:43:43.970 --> 00:43:46.190
not make them sleep in the barn.

00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:49.130
Might give them a place
in front of the fireplace

00:43:49.130 --> 00:43:52.210
because it was freezing
cold out.

00:43:52.210 --> 00:43:56.550
And rather than send them
off into the elements to have

00:43:56.550 --> 00:43:58.900
to sleep on the ground.

00:43:58.900 --> 00:44:02.970
So they slept in their
customers' homes,

00:44:02.970 --> 00:44:05.610
which then opens up for --

00:44:05.610 --> 00:44:09.800
opened up for them and for the
customers and for us a kind

00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:15.430
of universe of meaning and
thinking about the integration

00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:16.730
of immigrants into --

00:44:16.730 --> 00:44:20.030
a particular kind of
immigrant into a new place.

00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:25.480
So first issue, okay, the
Jewish peddler comes into a home

00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:31.490
in Arkansas, in New Mexico,
in Southern Africa, in Cuba,

00:44:31.490 --> 00:44:34.540
in Sweden, okay, wherever.

00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:36.870
And that very nice
customer who at the end

00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:39.280
of the day invites them
to sleep over, says,

00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:41.730
"Yes, you can sleep here."

00:44:41.730 --> 00:44:45.270
She says, "Would you
like to eat with us?"

00:44:45.270 --> 00:44:48.680
How very kind of
perhaps venal question.

00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:49.980
"Would you like to eat with us?"

00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:51.840
Although maybe not so
venal because I'm sure

00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:54.750
if somebody knocked on my door
and said, "Can I sleep here?

00:44:54.750 --> 00:44:58.050
Would you like -- can I come
in and sell you something

00:44:58.050 --> 00:44:59.910
and by the way, can
I sleep over?"

00:44:59.910 --> 00:45:01.760
Obviously, the answer is I
wouldn't have opened the door

00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:03.120
in the first place.

00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:05.460
But, "Would you like
to eat with us?"

00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:08.370
Now, perhaps it's a very
ordinary question except these

00:45:08.370 --> 00:45:11.490
were immigrant Jewish men

00:45:11.490 --> 00:45:15.820
for whom the problem
of food loomed large.

00:45:15.820 --> 00:45:18.250
That is, can they eat?

00:45:18.250 --> 00:45:19.680
Should they eat?

00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:22.730
Might they eat?

00:45:22.730 --> 00:45:28.520
The pork, squirrel, bear,
whatever people were eating

00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:31.110
and considered tasty
and nutritious

00:45:31.110 --> 00:45:35.380
and was just the ordinary
fare of ordinary life.

00:45:35.380 --> 00:45:39.580
So we have, again,
in very spotty ways,

00:45:39.580 --> 00:45:42.170
narratives that span the,

00:45:42.170 --> 00:45:44.230
"I was so hungry I would
have eaten anything.

00:45:44.230 --> 00:45:45.530
I didn't care what it was."

00:45:45.530 --> 00:45:48.820
And it was -- actually,
it tasted pretty good.

00:45:48.820 --> 00:45:52.840
And who were not
troubled while on the road

00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:55.450
about the Jewish dietary laws.

00:45:55.450 --> 00:45:59.690
And others who would
say to this woman

00:45:59.690 --> 00:46:05.710
who now has opened her house to
him, "I cannot eat your food."

00:46:05.710 --> 00:46:07.420
Which, from her point of view,

00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:12.420
had to raise the most obvious
question of, "Why not?"

00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:17.360
Okay. Now, these are all places
where there are no Jews, okay?

00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:22.380
These are the only Jews who
come into these communities

00:46:22.380 --> 00:46:24.620
and into these people's lives.

00:46:24.620 --> 00:46:27.820
So the peddlers, again, in the
evidence we have, would say,

00:46:27.820 --> 00:46:33.410
"My religion does not
allow me to eat that."

00:46:33.410 --> 00:46:34.710
"Well, what religion are you?"

00:46:34.710 --> 00:46:36.420
I mean, the person
might know Catholic,

00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:41.070
they might know Methodist,
they might know Presbyterian.

00:46:41.070 --> 00:46:43.500
They might know -- but what --

00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:46.680
which of those religions
say you can't eat something?

00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:49.670
And so, "I'm Jewish.

00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:52.500
I'm of the Hebrew faith."

00:46:52.500 --> 00:46:54.400
Whatever the formulation.

00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:56.410
And, on the one hand, this seems

00:46:56.410 --> 00:46:59.120
like it would have
been a barrier,

00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:02.510
a kind of the door comes down,
"Well, then get out of here."

00:47:02.510 --> 00:47:07.660
But to the contrary in, again,
the material that is available

00:47:07.660 --> 00:47:10.440
to researchers, in most cases,

00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:13.690
the woman says, "What
can you eat?

00:47:13.690 --> 00:47:17.910
If you can't eat the
meat, what can you eat?"

00:47:17.910 --> 00:47:20.690
"Bread, fruit, vegetables."

00:47:20.690 --> 00:47:24.500
Sometimes peddlers would
actually leave a pot in the home

00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:27.070
of the -- in the
customer's home,

00:47:27.070 --> 00:47:31.510
so every Monday his pot
would be in one person's home

00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:33.300
and another pot in
another person's home.

00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:37.600
Or he carried a pot with him and
he either prepared his own food

00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:43.860
or she would make what he
told her was acceptable.

00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:49.230
So this -- and we have
beyond the food issue,

00:47:49.230 --> 00:47:52.030
although I think the
food issue was so crucial

00:47:52.030 --> 00:47:55.420
and the most formative part of
this, but many of the peddlers

00:47:55.420 --> 00:48:02.510
in their sporadic narratives
talked about or recalled waking

00:48:02.510 --> 00:48:05.890
up early in the morning in
the customer's home and going

00:48:05.890 --> 00:48:08.580
and praying by himself
in a corner,

00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:11.950
putting on his prayer
shawl, putting on his --

00:48:11.950 --> 00:48:18.610
to fill in the leather boxes
with straps for the forehead

00:48:18.610 --> 00:48:24.950
and for the arm and for the
customer, "Well, what is this?

00:48:24.950 --> 00:48:27.880
I've never seen it before."

00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:29.590
Okay. These are not people

00:48:29.590 --> 00:48:34.850
who had taken comparative
religion 101.

00:48:34.850 --> 00:48:38.830
And, again, the peddler
is required,

00:48:38.830 --> 00:48:41.720
required because he
wants to make a sale.

00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:43.460
He is not required
because he wants

00:48:43.460 --> 00:48:45.800
to foster interfaith
understanding.

00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:48.200
He wants to make a sale.

00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:51.960
He explains, "This
is how Jews pray."

00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:57.210
The next few stories I'm going
to tell you come from memoirs,

00:48:57.210 --> 00:48:58.720
and generally as a historian,

00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:01.220
I'm extremely suspicious
of memoirs.

00:49:01.220 --> 00:49:03.070
Okay. Why?

00:49:03.070 --> 00:49:07.930
Because how people remember and
how they want their children

00:49:07.930 --> 00:49:14.050
and grandchildren to remember
can be somewhat embellished.

00:49:14.050 --> 00:49:17.540
But I've seen the following
couple stories in a number

00:49:17.540 --> 00:49:19.190
of places that I'm
going to take it

00:49:19.190 --> 00:49:22.110
as at least potentially
accurate.

00:49:22.110 --> 00:49:25.290
And since I have no way
of checking up, okay,

00:49:25.290 --> 00:49:27.700
we'll have to listen
to their words.

00:49:27.700 --> 00:49:30.170
And the words, even if
they're embellished,

00:49:30.170 --> 00:49:33.110
still offer us a window
into the peddler experience.

00:49:33.110 --> 00:49:37.850
So one man talked about
putting on his tefillin

00:49:37.850 --> 00:49:41.060
with the long leather straps
and at that moment, the --

00:49:41.060 --> 00:49:44.260
somebody from the
family came into the room

00:49:44.260 --> 00:49:51.190
where he was donning his
phylacteries and she screams.

00:49:51.190 --> 00:49:53.650
Okay. "Mr. Goldberg is trying

00:49:53.650 --> 00:49:56.880
to commit suicide
by hanging himself."

00:49:56.880 --> 00:49:59.140
Okay. And he had
to explain, "No.

00:49:59.140 --> 00:50:02.400
This is part of Jewish prayer."

00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:06.630
Likewise, in stories that
come out of the American south

00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:10.830
in both white and
African American homes,

00:50:10.830 --> 00:50:15.060
as well as in the
Midwest in South Africa,

00:50:15.060 --> 00:50:16.360
in places particularly

00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:20.570
where Protestantism was
the dominant faith and in

00:50:20.570 --> 00:50:25.540
which there was a great emphasis
on the family Bible reading,

00:50:25.540 --> 00:50:28.820
according to these narratives,
the man of the home --

00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:31.580
he's now in charge -- the wife
buys the stuff but the man

00:50:31.580 --> 00:50:35.410
of the home is in charge of
the family Bible reading --

00:50:35.410 --> 00:50:38.870
would hand the Bible
to the peddler and say,

00:50:38.870 --> 00:50:41.880
"Since you are one of the
Hebrews or you are one

00:50:41.880 --> 00:50:47.950
of the chosen people, will
you read the Bible for us."

00:50:47.950 --> 00:50:51.070
Okay. And indeed my
absolutely favorite story,

00:50:51.070 --> 00:50:55.870
and I do hope it's true,
but it comes from a memoir

00:50:55.870 --> 00:50:59.430
which a daughter wrote down
about her father's life.

00:50:59.430 --> 00:51:03.030
He was a Lithuanian
Jewish peddler

00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:05.630
who peddled in the Dakotas.

00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:09.880
And his customers knew him
to be an extremely pious man.

00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:14.090
So pious, his name
was Moshe, Moses.

00:51:14.090 --> 00:51:19.270
So religious that they
called him Holy Moses.

00:51:19.270 --> 00:51:26.570
And in one particular
swing around the week

00:51:26.570 --> 00:51:33.850
in this primarily German
population in the Dakotas,

00:51:33.850 --> 00:51:37.670
several customers approached
him and said, "Moses,

00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:40.560
we have a favor to ask you."

00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:42.070
So what was the favor?

00:51:42.070 --> 00:51:46.880
Said, "Our minister
died and it's going

00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:48.830
to be months -- I
mean, it's winter.

00:51:48.830 --> 00:51:51.150
It's going to be
months until the church,

00:51:51.150 --> 00:51:57.800
the synod in Minneapolis
will send us a new preacher.

00:51:57.800 --> 00:51:59.710
You are such a religious man.

00:51:59.710 --> 00:52:03.310
Would you come and
lead services for us

00:52:03.310 --> 00:52:05.710
until we get a new minister?"

00:52:05.710 --> 00:52:10.650
So as his daughter wrote
down and as he recalled,

00:52:10.650 --> 00:52:14.930
for several months on Sunday
morning, Holy Moses went

00:52:14.930 --> 00:52:18.200
to this local German
speaking church.

00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:20.990
Now, he didn't lead them
in prayers that he left

00:52:20.990 --> 00:52:22.740
for them to do for themselves.

00:52:22.740 --> 00:52:28.520
But she said he led them
every week in a exposition

00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:33.070
of the weekly Torah reading,
the Parshat ha-Shavua.

00:52:33.070 --> 00:52:35.940
And now he spoke -- because
he came from Lithuania,

00:52:35.940 --> 00:52:39.350
he was a Yiddish speaker and he
also had a smattering of German

00:52:39.350 --> 00:52:42.120
that he was able to
communicate with them.

00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:47.210
And as the daughter recalled,
he was so proud of the fact

00:52:47.210 --> 00:52:52.410
that he taught them about Rashi,

00:52:52.410 --> 00:52:57.480
as this medieval Jewish
commentator who, as a young man

00:52:57.480 --> 00:53:05.460
in Lithuania, Holy Moses would
have studied in whatever level.

00:53:06.820 --> 00:53:15.490
Wherever the peddlers went, they
were in search of one thing only

00:53:15.490 --> 00:53:17.280
and it wasn't brotherhood.

00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:21.480
It wasn't religious
kind of fraternity

00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:23.070
with people who were different.

00:53:23.070 --> 00:53:26.050
It was, they wanted
to sell something.

00:53:26.050 --> 00:53:31.390
And so one of the issues
that becomes very significant

00:53:31.390 --> 00:53:36.360
in the study of Jewish peddlers
in the American south is

00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:40.990
that they sold willy-nilly
to white families,

00:53:40.990 --> 00:53:43.190
to African American families.

00:53:43.190 --> 00:53:47.280
Okay. It didn't matter to
them who the customer was,

00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:50.920
what the local morays
were, a woman,

00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:57.300
an African American woman had as
much ability to buy eyeglasses

00:53:57.300 --> 00:54:00.890
or needles and thread
as a white woman.

00:54:00.890 --> 00:54:03.970
One commentator, one
observer of the time said

00:54:03.970 --> 00:54:07.880
that the Jewish peddler was
the only white man who came

00:54:07.880 --> 00:54:13.610
into African American homes who
doffed his hat to the woman,

00:54:13.610 --> 00:54:23.000
bowed to her, all right, in
tremendous respect and tried

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:27.500
to proceed with having her be
enticed by something in his bag.

00:54:27.500 --> 00:54:30.740
Notably, he was probably the
only white person whom she could

00:54:30.740 --> 00:54:33.180
throw out if she wanted.

00:54:33.180 --> 00:54:36.450
He was a stranger,
he was an immigrant.

00:54:36.450 --> 00:54:39.200
He had no authority behind him.

00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:41.940
He was not the representative
of the landowner,

00:54:41.940 --> 00:54:44.350
he was not the representative
of the state.

00:54:44.350 --> 00:54:49.820
He was just an immigrant
trying to sell something.

00:54:49.820 --> 00:54:53.990
So I want to end with one
more part of this story,

00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:56.180
and I hope you all
have some questions.

00:54:56.180 --> 00:55:01.050
Wherever they went, Sweden
and Ireland, Southern Africa

00:55:01.050 --> 00:55:12.190
and Australia, Cuba, Jamaica,
Haiti, Mississippi, Missouri,

00:55:12.190 --> 00:55:17.890
Kansas, Oregon, the peddlers,
however much the women like them

00:55:17.890 --> 00:55:22.720
and enjoyed having the -- this
person come into their home

00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:25.430
and sell them something,
they raised the ire

00:55:25.430 --> 00:55:27.590
of the local shopkeepers.

00:55:27.590 --> 00:55:31.240
The local shopkeepers
hated them, okay?

00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:34.060
So the peddler could
come into a woman's home.

00:55:34.060 --> 00:55:36.480
He could flatter her.

00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:38.840
"Oh, your daughter looks
so beautiful today.

00:55:38.840 --> 00:55:44.260
What a beautiful
table you have."

00:55:44.260 --> 00:55:47.800
He could make her feel good
and he could sell for less

00:55:47.800 --> 00:55:49.700
because he had no overhead.

00:55:49.700 --> 00:55:52.530
He didn't have a
store that he --

00:55:52.530 --> 00:55:54.130
property or that he had

00:55:54.130 --> 00:55:57.810
to either pay mortgage
or pay a rent for.

00:55:57.810 --> 00:56:00.020
And the women seemed
to prefer the peddler

00:56:00.020 --> 00:56:03.310
over the local shopkeepers
for all sorts of reasons.

00:56:03.310 --> 00:56:05.260
And so the local
shopkeepers engaged

00:56:05.260 --> 00:56:09.080
in political activity
all over the world to try

00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:11.990
to push out the peddlers.

00:56:11.990 --> 00:56:16.390
Okay? Sometimes it was by trying
to get their representatives,

00:56:16.390 --> 00:56:19.770
the local city council, the
local state legislature,

00:56:19.770 --> 00:56:25.490
even in the parliament, to raise
the taxes or to raise the fee

00:56:25.490 --> 00:56:28.240
for a peddler's license.

00:56:28.240 --> 00:56:30.690
Okay. Making it prohibitive.

00:56:30.690 --> 00:56:33.440
Okay. The state of North
Carolina tried to pass a law

00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:36.790
that said only citizens
could get peddler's licenses.

00:56:36.790 --> 00:56:42.030
Well, that was certainly not in
the interests of the peddlers

00:56:42.030 --> 00:56:43.730
because they were all
immigrants and by definition,

00:56:43.730 --> 00:56:45.660
they weren't citizens yet.

00:56:45.660 --> 00:56:51.730
Some places, peddler local
merchant antagonism sparked

00:56:51.730 --> 00:56:55.400
into violence, okay,
and there were acts

00:56:55.400 --> 00:56:59.390
of violence perpetrated
against the peddlers.

00:56:59.390 --> 00:57:04.290
In some places, laws
were introduced

00:57:04.290 --> 00:57:06.480
to actually expel them.

00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:10.570
One representative to the
parliament in the Cape Colony

00:57:10.570 --> 00:57:15.770
of Southern Africa, in an
inquest on the peddlers said,

00:57:15.770 --> 00:57:18.070
"As far as I'm concerned,
the only thing we should do

00:57:18.070 --> 00:57:22.150
with these Jewish
peddlers is expel them.

00:57:22.150 --> 00:57:27.760
But our wives and daughters
would never put up with that."

00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:33.390
So we have their story and their
story ends, as does my talk,

00:57:33.390 --> 00:57:36.090
with the fact for none of
them, as far as I can tell,

00:57:36.090 --> 00:57:40.350
because the numbers are elusive,
but for I'm going to say none

00:57:40.350 --> 00:57:42.930
of them was this a
lifetime occupation.

00:57:42.930 --> 00:57:47.000
It was two years, three
years, four years.

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:50.380
Some of them became
so fabulously wealthy

00:57:50.380 --> 00:57:54.360
that their names are emblazoned
in our public culture.

00:57:54.360 --> 00:57:56.920
The late lamented
Lehman Brothers, okay?

00:57:56.920 --> 00:57:59.970
Well, that's how Mayer
Lehman got his start.

00:57:59.970 --> 00:58:03.590
Or Guggenheim, Rosenwalds.

00:58:03.590 --> 00:58:07.410
So Julius Rosenwald's
father came as a peddler,

00:58:07.410 --> 00:58:12.590
as did his maternal
uncles, Gimbels.

00:58:12.590 --> 00:58:16.470
Okay. And on and on and on.

00:58:16.470 --> 00:58:20.910
Very few of them became
Lehman or Guggenheim

00:58:20.910 --> 00:58:23.030
or Rosenwald or Gimbels.

00:58:23.030 --> 00:58:26.980
That is a very unusual
and atypical story.

00:58:26.980 --> 00:58:32.380
Most became the owners of
small stores in back --

00:58:32.380 --> 00:58:35.750
in small towns or
they became the owners

00:58:35.750 --> 00:58:40.160
of stores in larger cities.

00:58:40.160 --> 00:58:45.480
They might go open a peddler
warehouse, a junkyard.

00:58:45.480 --> 00:58:49.290
Some kind of a business venture.

00:58:49.290 --> 00:58:55.580
But they did not remain for
a lifetime behind that horse

00:58:55.580 --> 00:58:59.710
or on the road, and for
sure their sons did not get

00:58:59.710 --> 00:59:03.920
up on the wagon and get
behind their father's horses.

00:59:03.920 --> 00:59:09.880
So in some, these men whose --

00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:13.310
most of whose names
we do not know,

00:59:13.310 --> 00:59:16.470
most of whom were not
great political actors,

00:59:16.470 --> 00:59:18.180
they were not great intellects,

00:59:18.180 --> 00:59:23.300
they were not famous
political activists.

00:59:23.300 --> 00:59:27.960
However, I want to content,
had as much role in the making

00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:33.210
of the modern Jewish experience
as did the political people,

00:59:33.210 --> 00:59:35.220
the great activists,
the writers,

00:59:35.220 --> 00:59:40.330
the scholars, and
the famous ones.

00:59:40.330 --> 00:59:46.390
And by just picking up that
pack and taking the road,

00:59:46.390 --> 00:59:50.520
they transformed not only
Jewish history but the history

00:59:50.520 --> 00:59:52.380
of the places to
which they went.

00:59:52.380 --> 00:59:54.180
Thank you.

00:59:54.180 --> 00:59:59.530
[ Applause ]

00:59:59.530 --> 01:00:02.290
Okay. Could I trouble
you to open this?

01:00:02.290 --> 01:00:06.190
I had a little encounter
with a knife and an eggplant.

01:00:06.190 --> 01:00:08.990
Yeah. So I just had -- I'm
going to take your questions.

01:00:08.990 --> 01:00:10.290
I will repeat them
but I just wanted

01:00:10.290 --> 01:00:12.890
to explain I can't open
my own water bottle.

01:00:12.890 --> 01:00:15.780
Okay. I'm just fine.

01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:18.510
Yes, sir.

01:00:18.510 --> 01:00:36.270
[ Inaudible Question ]

01:00:36.270 --> 01:00:39.430
Okay. So the question was,

01:00:39.430 --> 01:00:41.940
did the peddlers keep
their own records

01:00:41.940 --> 01:00:44.290
and what kind of
sources did I use?

01:00:44.290 --> 01:00:48.050
So some of them did and you can
imagine for most of these men,

01:00:48.050 --> 01:00:52.700
by the time they finished
peddling, their 18 months

01:00:52.700 --> 01:00:55.790
or their 36 months or
whatever of peddling,

01:00:55.790 --> 01:01:00.200
and they had their little pieces
of paper, they threw them out.

01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:02.120
Okay. What was more
important was the store

01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:04.150
that they were going to have.

01:01:04.150 --> 01:01:07.140
But there's some in
scattered places.

01:01:07.140 --> 01:01:09.260
And -- if you can read them

01:01:09.260 --> 01:01:11.380
because they're almost
incomprehensible.

01:01:11.380 --> 01:01:15.310
But what's important about their
record keeping is they were

01:01:15.310 --> 01:01:17.950
essentially independent
entrepreneurs.

01:01:17.950 --> 01:01:20.130
They were not like
the Fuller Brush Man

01:01:20.130 --> 01:01:24.160
or the Singer Sewing Machine,
you know, the traveling salesman

01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:25.920
who worked for a corporation

01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:31.330
who gave the traveling salesman
a record book and a standard way

01:01:31.330 --> 01:01:35.540
to record sales,
expenses, and somebody

01:01:35.540 --> 01:01:37.990
in the home office would
go through their books.

01:01:37.990 --> 01:01:39.590
These guys worked
for themselves,

01:01:39.590 --> 01:01:44.860
and while they had a wholesaler,
they could pick up other kinds

01:01:44.860 --> 01:01:47.540
of goods as they wanted and
that was not the business

01:01:47.540 --> 01:01:49.690
of their wholesaler.

01:01:49.690 --> 01:01:55.050
So the fact even that they kept
the records themselves tells us

01:01:55.050 --> 01:01:57.410
something about them
and their independence.

01:01:57.410 --> 01:01:58.710
So what did I use?

01:01:58.710 --> 01:02:03.060
So picture a -- one of
those all-you-can-eat places

01:02:03.060 --> 01:02:04.950
and you'll say, "I can take a
little this and then a little

01:02:04.950 --> 01:02:08.610
of that and all the -- " I
mean, there's no one source.

01:02:08.610 --> 01:02:13.930
I would say this was a book
that could not have been written

01:02:13.930 --> 01:02:19.530
without the internet and
those vast search engines

01:02:19.530 --> 01:02:21.440
like the [inaudible] Trust.

01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:27.700
And when I plugged in the word
Jewish peddler, I got millions

01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:32.500
of hits and was obviously
unable to read them all

01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:34.340
to take advantage of them all,

01:02:34.340 --> 01:02:36.100
but I'll just give
you a smattering.

01:02:36.100 --> 01:02:39.510
They show up in Jewish
communal histories.

01:02:39.510 --> 01:02:42.970
They show up in local
Jewish newspapers or even

01:02:42.970 --> 01:02:44.720
in global Jewish newspapers.

01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:47.960
So like the Jewish Chronicle
of England, you know,

01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:51.860
published in London, had
little articles all the time

01:02:51.860 --> 01:02:57.720
about a Jewish peddler was
just murdered in the big --

01:02:57.720 --> 01:03:00.890
you know, in the South
Island of New Zealand.

01:03:00.890 --> 01:03:04.740
So that and then where
it seemed to be useful,

01:03:04.740 --> 01:03:07.480
I would then try
to track it down.

01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:11.300
Where there were controversies
between Jewish peddlers

01:03:11.300 --> 01:03:13.930
and local shopkeepers,
those were fantastic,

01:03:13.930 --> 01:03:16.000
because somebody came
in to investigate

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:19.390
and here I'll just mention
that in the first decade

01:03:19.390 --> 01:03:22.340
of the 20th century, there
was a two-year boycott

01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:25.390
of the Jewish peddlers
in Limerick, Ireland.

01:03:25.390 --> 01:03:30.590
Okay. Organized by a
local priest at the urging

01:03:30.590 --> 01:03:33.670
of the local Irish
Catholic shopkeepers.

01:03:33.670 --> 01:03:36.940
So the local newspapers
are writing about this.

01:03:36.940 --> 01:03:40.030
Somebody -- investigators come
from the board of delegates

01:03:40.030 --> 01:03:44.020
of deputies of British
jury to come in to try

01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:46.880
to patch over the controversy.

01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:50.120
Those left paper trails, and
so again, you get to find

01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:52.110
out what they were selling.

01:03:52.110 --> 01:03:57.010
And so the record books
of R.G. Dun, okay,

01:03:57.010 --> 01:04:01.460
which are at the Baker Library
at Harvard, where the --

01:04:01.460 --> 01:04:07.900
these were investigations by
anonymous agents who wrote

01:04:07.900 --> 01:04:11.580
about the credit worthiness
of local businessmen.

01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:14.000
So they're organized
by state, by year.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.120
I mean, it's -- they're
voluminous.

01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:19.200
And I only picked Maine
and South Carolina, okay?

01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:21.800
And in fact I ended up with
South Carolina only picking one

01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:23.690
or two counties.

01:04:23.690 --> 01:04:27.980
And, fortunately, the
investigators for Dun happened

01:04:27.980 --> 01:04:31.920
to have a thing about Jews
and so they'd write Jewish,

01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:33.220
you know, which was great.

01:04:33.220 --> 01:04:35.060
I mean, he may have
been terrible to be

01:04:35.060 --> 01:04:37.110
so essentializing,
but then I got

01:04:37.110 --> 01:04:40.170
to seeing what was
being said about them.

01:04:40.170 --> 01:04:45.600
And so the investigators
for R.G. Dun would write,

01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:50.180
so and so store,
former Jewish peddler,

01:04:50.180 --> 01:04:53.250
used to peddle, Jew,
used to peddle.

01:04:53.250 --> 01:04:59.750
Customers say he is hardworking
sober industrious and trust him.

01:04:59.750 --> 01:05:02.210
Okay. So that was a source.

01:05:02.210 --> 01:05:07.700
When there were murders,
okay, inquests, biographies,

01:05:07.700 --> 01:05:10.010
autobiographies, the works

01:05:10.010 --> 01:05:15.030
of local Jewish historical
societies

01:05:15.030 --> 01:05:17.190
where they did oral
history projects.

01:05:17.190 --> 01:05:21.410
So like that all-you-can-eat
place, I couldn't go

01:05:21.410 --> 01:05:23.850
to all the archives to
see all the memoirs,

01:05:23.850 --> 01:05:27.570
but I tried to sample as
much of them as possible.

01:05:27.570 --> 01:05:30.600
And what I ended up
getting was, I think,

01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:34.020
a pretty accurate story.

01:05:34.020 --> 01:05:36.510
Yes?

01:05:36.510 --> 01:05:49.380
[ Inaudible Question ]

01:05:49.380 --> 01:05:51.220
Sure. So that's a
great question.

01:05:51.220 --> 01:05:54.510
So, yes, I mean, it was in that
area because they could only go

01:05:54.510 --> 01:05:56.670
so far because they
had a weekly cycle.

01:05:56.670 --> 01:06:00.090
So if Saturday night they
loaded up their wagons or loaded

01:06:00.090 --> 01:06:04.360
up their backpack,
how far could they get

01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:06.130
from where that store was?

01:06:06.130 --> 01:06:09.250
Now, as new transportation
technology came in,

01:06:09.250 --> 01:06:13.290
they might take a train an
hour away and then peddle

01:06:13.290 --> 01:06:15.050
and come back on the train.

01:06:15.050 --> 01:06:18.720
Or they might take a canal
boat, a boat on a canal,

01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:21.740
or some other conveyance.

01:06:21.740 --> 01:06:25.790
But it was relatively
routed in a particular area,

01:06:25.790 --> 01:06:29.920
southwestern Missouri
or upstate New York.

01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:36.260
And the route was as large as
they could walk or go by horse.

01:06:36.260 --> 01:06:41.760
So Isaac Mayer Wise, the kind of
founder of the reform movement

01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:45.650
and reform Judaism in America,
wrote a lot about peddlers.

01:06:45.650 --> 01:06:46.950
That's, again, another place

01:06:46.950 --> 01:06:48.790
where people observed
what they were doing.

01:06:48.790 --> 01:06:51.340
And he said the typical
peddler started

01:06:51.340 --> 01:06:56.030
with a pack of over 100 pounds.

01:06:56.030 --> 01:06:58.160
Okay. Now, I know when
I buy groceries and it's

01:06:58.160 --> 01:07:01.300
about 10 pounds, I
get it delivered.

01:07:01.300 --> 01:07:06.400
So how far can one get
carrying that on one's back?

01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:09.090
So it was a relatively
small circuit.

01:07:09.090 --> 01:07:13.510
Once they had a horse and wagon,
obviously they would negotiate

01:07:13.510 --> 01:07:17.830
with the wholesaler to give
them a bigger territory.

01:07:19.010 --> 01:07:20.810
Yes?

01:07:20.810 --> 01:07:38.840
[ Inaudible Question ]

01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:41.670
Yeah. I mean, I would say they
were definitely a transmission

01:07:41.670 --> 01:07:44.250
agent of current events
in that they had just been

01:07:44.250 --> 01:07:47.940
in the larger town and they're
going to this isolated area.

01:07:47.940 --> 01:07:49.760
And they said, "Oh, you
know what happened."

01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:53.650
But they were -- they tried
to steer very far away

01:07:53.650 --> 01:07:56.080
from politics because
you never know.

01:07:56.080 --> 01:07:58.580
You want to sell something
and the last thing you want

01:07:58.580 --> 01:08:01.840
to do is offend somebody.

01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:04.990
I didn't see books and
I didn't see newspapers.

01:08:04.990 --> 01:08:08.350
And -- but it's very
interesting.

01:08:08.350 --> 01:08:11.940
The word for peddler in
Hebrew is [inaudible]

01:08:11.940 --> 01:08:14.370
which means gossip.

01:08:14.370 --> 01:08:17.920
And so yeah.

01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:19.640
So and the best gossip was,

01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:24.370
"Your neighbor just
bought a tablecloth.

01:08:24.370 --> 01:08:27.560
Don't you want one too?"

01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:29.360
Yes?

01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:48.850
[ Inaudible Question ]

01:08:48.850 --> 01:08:50.900
Okay. So that's a great --
so the question -- I'm sorry.

01:08:50.900 --> 01:08:52.290
I was supposed to
repeat the questions.

01:08:52.290 --> 01:08:53.980
So who produced the goods

01:08:53.980 --> 01:08:57.130
and did their wives
perhaps produce some

01:08:57.130 --> 01:08:59.900
of the maybe crafts
that they sold?

01:08:59.900 --> 01:09:01.290
Certainly, there were cases,

01:09:01.290 --> 01:09:05.810
but what's important is the
goods were brought to them

01:09:05.810 --> 01:09:10.420
through these peddler warehouses
which were often connected

01:09:10.420 --> 01:09:14.560
to Jewish manufacturers, okay,
in the very large cities.

01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:16.750
So there'd be a Jewish
manufacturer

01:09:16.750 --> 01:09:19.870
in New York who's
making, you know, mirrors.

01:09:19.870 --> 01:09:24.130
Okay. And the wholesaler
might make four trips a year

01:09:24.130 --> 01:09:31.160
from Talladega to New
York to get to buy goods.

01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:35.230
Okay? And so he had his Jewish
contacts with whom he --

01:09:35.230 --> 01:09:37.110
from whom he got goods.

01:09:37.110 --> 01:09:39.740
The Jewish peddlers in Ireland
were getting their goods

01:09:39.740 --> 01:09:44.880
from Jewish manufacturers
in England or from Jewish --

01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:47.230
they -- in Ireland, there
was a lot of picture frame

01:09:47.230 --> 01:09:50.330
and picture frame making, and
the picture frames were all made

01:09:50.330 --> 01:09:54.150
by former peddlers in -- living
in Dublin, Limerick, and Cork,

01:09:54.150 --> 01:09:57.340
who went into picture
frame making.

01:09:57.340 --> 01:09:59.750
And then the peddlers would
go out in the countryside

01:09:59.750 --> 01:10:01.340
with the picture
frames and usually

01:10:01.340 --> 01:10:03.080
with Catholic, religious
pictures.

01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:05.060
You know, Bleeding
Heat of Jesus, Mary,

01:10:05.060 --> 01:10:06.490
the Last Supper, and so on.

01:10:06.490 --> 01:10:08.280
Now, the other part
of the question,

01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:10.100
which is something
I didn't touch on,

01:10:10.100 --> 01:10:13.510
but it's really important,
and you mentioned their wives.

01:10:13.510 --> 01:10:17.130
So here the question is, are
these married men or not?

01:10:17.130 --> 01:10:21.790
And so some of the
men were single, okay,

01:10:21.790 --> 01:10:26.530
and there is a whole story
from all over the world

01:10:26.530 --> 01:10:31.020
where these single Jewish
peddlers meet local women

01:10:31.020 --> 01:10:37.450
who are just not Jewish and end
up in relationships, both legal

01:10:37.450 --> 01:10:42.630
and just common, but
often for lifetime.

01:10:42.630 --> 01:10:46.430
Some of the peddlers,
particularly towards the end

01:10:46.430 --> 01:10:51.590
of the 19th century, from places
like Lithuania and so on --

01:10:51.590 --> 01:10:52.890
oh, and let me go back.

01:10:52.890 --> 01:10:56.140
The ones who are unmarried,
they find Jewish --

01:10:56.140 --> 01:11:00.280
those who don't marry
local women will marry

01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:01.810
when they stop peddling.

01:11:01.810 --> 01:11:04.010
So opening a store
in Tupper Lake,

01:11:04.010 --> 01:11:07.150
New York means now I'm
going to get married.

01:11:07.150 --> 01:11:12.930
And sometimes they go back
home to the community in Posen

01:11:12.930 --> 01:11:16.140
or Bavaria or wherever, and
they'll find a young woman

01:11:16.140 --> 01:11:19.750
and marry her and
bring her over.

01:11:19.750 --> 01:11:23.490
Sometimes, the local -- whatever
is the closest local Jewish

01:11:23.490 --> 01:11:26.090
community will have
the daughters of.

01:11:26.090 --> 01:11:28.040
Okay. So I mentioned
Julius Rosenwald.

01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:29.690
His father was a peddler.

01:11:29.690 --> 01:11:34.870
His outfitter, the
Baltimore-based outfitter

01:11:34.870 --> 01:11:39.230
for Samuel Rosenwald, who
himself had been a peddler,

01:11:39.230 --> 01:11:41.830
had -- you know, there
were four brothers.

01:11:41.830 --> 01:11:43.220
Their name was the Hammer
[inaudible] Brothers

01:11:43.220 --> 01:11:45.530
and they had one sister.

01:11:45.530 --> 01:11:48.270
Okay. Well, when Samuel
Rosenwald was ready

01:11:48.270 --> 01:11:52.820
to settle down, he married
the sister of his creditors.

01:11:52.820 --> 01:11:58.590
Some of the peddlers left
wives and children back

01:11:58.590 --> 01:12:02.660
in the old home -- Europe, or
in the Balkans or other parts

01:12:02.660 --> 01:12:04.210
of the Ottoman Empire.

01:12:04.210 --> 01:12:06.790
And when they could settle
down, when they were going

01:12:06.790 --> 01:12:08.660
to stop peddling, they'd
then call for the wife

01:12:08.660 --> 01:12:11.320
and children to join them.

01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:13.580
And some of them left
their wives and children

01:12:13.580 --> 01:12:16.050
in a big city, let's say in
New York, but then they went

01:12:16.050 --> 01:12:19.990
to peddle in the Adirondacks and
might see the wife and the rest

01:12:19.990 --> 01:12:24.610
of the family at Passover
or at the holiday,

01:12:24.610 --> 01:12:26.210
you know, in the fall holidays.

01:12:26.210 --> 01:12:29.350
So this whole connection
between peddling

01:12:29.350 --> 01:12:31.450
and marital patterns was very --

01:12:31.450 --> 01:12:35.130
was really central
to this history.

01:12:35.130 --> 01:12:38.510
Yes, sir, in the back.

01:12:38.510 --> 01:12:50.410
[ Inaudible Question ]

01:12:50.410 --> 01:12:56.390
Okay. So was there a genre of
manuals for dealing with how

01:12:56.390 --> 01:13:01.280
to observe the holidays and
the Sabbath and Kashrut?

01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:06.050
Manuals, no, but other
kinds of sources.

01:13:06.050 --> 01:13:10.230
And what I think is really
notable in this concept

01:13:10.230 --> 01:13:12.120
of new world Jewish
peddling -- and, by the way,

01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:14.410
there are such manuals
in Europe,

01:13:14.410 --> 01:13:16.450
for Jewish peddlers in Europe.

01:13:16.450 --> 01:13:21.230
But here, the men are pretty
much improvising on their own.

01:13:21.230 --> 01:13:23.580
"I will, I won't, I'm
going to eat the food,

01:13:23.580 --> 01:13:24.880
I'm not going to eat the food.

01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:27.020
I'm going to only
eat the food if."

01:13:27.020 --> 01:13:29.710
Okay? And I see a
direct connection

01:13:29.710 --> 01:13:33.800
between this improvisation and
kind of trying to figure it

01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:36.520
out on their own
without rabbinic

01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:38.200
or authoritative sources.

01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:41.750
And the creation of a new kind
of Judaism in the new world,

01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:46.420
particularly in America, which
gave much greater license

01:13:46.420 --> 01:13:50.640
to ordinary people to decide
what they want to do and how.

01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:54.290
And rabbis in the big cities
writing for, you know,

01:13:54.290 --> 01:13:57.980
the [inaudible] or some of the
other Jewish newspapers coming

01:13:57.980 --> 01:14:00.120
out of New York or
Philadelphia thought

01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:02.010
that peddling was horrible.

01:14:02.010 --> 01:14:06.590
They thought, this is terrible
because it's leading to exactly

01:14:06.590 --> 01:14:11.510
that individual choice
in determining, you know,

01:14:11.510 --> 01:14:13.040
how to observe the law.

01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:16.370
And they wanted to get
Jews out of peddling.

01:14:16.370 --> 01:14:18.580
And the peddling
continued to be attractive

01:14:18.580 --> 01:14:22.510
until it was just
economically no longer the mode

01:14:22.510 --> 01:14:25.700
by which people -- ordinary
people got their stuff.

01:14:25.700 --> 01:14:27.510
Yes, sir?

01:14:27.510 --> 01:14:43.760
[ Inaudible Question ]

01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:47.800
Okay. So the question was did
I find competing wholesalers?

01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:50.920
Yes. In the same
[inaudible] absolutely.

01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:54.290
Okay? There'd be two, three,
four peddler warehouses.

01:14:54.290 --> 01:14:56.610
And so they all want to
make a kind of sweet deal

01:14:56.610 --> 01:14:58.710
with the peddler because
they need the peddlers

01:14:58.710 --> 01:15:01.000
because that's how they're
going to get their goods out.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:04.970
And so they have to offer
the peddler good rates

01:15:04.970 --> 01:15:10.890
for the goods, favorable
rates on the goods, good --

01:15:10.890 --> 01:15:14.250
the kind of goods that the
peddler says the customer wants.

01:15:14.250 --> 01:15:16.740
Lot of people, there
are lots of fights.

01:15:16.740 --> 01:15:18.970
Not necessarily physical
fights but anger.

01:15:18.970 --> 01:15:22.420
You know, kind of people take
offense and peddler will switch

01:15:22.420 --> 01:15:24.650
from one wholesaler to another.

01:15:24.650 --> 01:15:26.420
Many of the peddlers,
once they finish,

01:15:26.420 --> 01:15:28.640
set up their own
wholesale enterprises.

01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:31.550
So essentially they're competing
with their old wholesalers.

01:15:31.550 --> 01:15:34.670
So, yeah, there was a
great deal of competition.

01:15:34.670 --> 01:15:38.130
So those folks could be
competing with each other

01:15:38.130 --> 01:15:41.270
but the peddlers could not
compete with other peddlers.

01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:43.510
[Inaudible] my pleasure.

01:15:43.510 --> 01:15:46.510
