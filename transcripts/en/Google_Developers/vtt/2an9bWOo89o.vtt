00:00:01.234 --> 00:00:06.200
Fitzpatrick: So this is our talk
about how to design--

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.601
Not so much how to design,
but how to think more in a--

00:00:08.601 --> 00:00:10.868
about users when you're
writing software.

00:00:10.868 --> 00:00:12.067
Collins-Sussman: Right.

00:00:12.067 --> 00:00:13.067
Well, actually,
let's introduce ourselves first.

00:00:13.067 --> 00:00:14.167
Fitzpatrick: Okay.

00:00:14.167 --> 00:00:15.334
Collins-Sussman:
What's your name?

00:00:15.334 --> 00:00:17.200
Fitzpatrick: My name
is Brian Fitzpatrick.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.434
Most people
call me Fitz.

00:00:18.434 --> 00:00:19.701
Collins-Sussman: My name
is Ben Collins-Sussman.

00:00:19.701 --> 00:00:21.567
I'm just Ben.

00:00:21.567 --> 00:00:24.501
And we are gonna
talk about--

00:00:24.501 --> 00:00:25.601
It's a very
subjective talk.

00:00:25.601 --> 00:00:26.667
It's based
on our experience.

00:00:26.667 --> 00:00:28.434
We come from
the open source world.

00:00:28.434 --> 00:00:30.634
We both worked on
subversion for many years,

00:00:30.634 --> 00:00:32.734
and now we're at Google,

00:00:32.734 --> 00:00:34.701
and we work on
an open source team,

00:00:34.701 --> 00:00:36.667
and we actually work on

00:00:36.667 --> 00:00:38.501
Google Code's project hosting
service.

00:00:38.501 --> 00:00:40.767
That's what I do. You do some
great management stuff.

00:00:40.767 --> 00:00:44.200
But what we do
essentially is--

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.167
everything we're talking about
is coming from our experience

00:00:46.167 --> 00:00:48.734
of working with
communities of users.

00:00:48.734 --> 00:00:50.567
Open source software,
closed source software,

00:00:50.567 --> 00:00:52.033
what is--
what kind of relationship

00:00:52.033 --> 00:00:54.133
do you have
with those users?

00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:56.167
Fitzpatrick:
And this is completely

00:00:56.167 --> 00:00:58.400
based on a series of anecdotes
that we're gonna tell

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.133
in addition to some
little bits of information,

00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:02.501
but most importantly,
this is a subjective talk.

00:01:02.501 --> 00:01:04.167
These are our opinions.

00:01:04.167 --> 00:01:06.033
If you disagree with them--
and that's fine--

00:01:06.033 --> 00:01:07.567
you can get your own talk,

00:01:07.567 --> 00:01:09.767
and have your own opinion
somewhere else.

00:01:09.767 --> 00:01:12.334
But seriously, we're--

00:01:12.334 --> 00:01:14.067
this is--we're sort of
gonna tell this

00:01:14.067 --> 00:01:15.400
through a series
of anecdotes

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.133
and things
that we've experienced.

00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:18.667
And that's it.

00:01:18.667 --> 00:01:19.834
Collins-Sussman:
Yeah, and there'll be

00:01:19.834 --> 00:01:22.234
time for Q and A
when we're done, so--

00:01:22.234 --> 00:01:23.634
First thing we want
to talk about

00:01:23.634 --> 00:01:25.601
is we're all
programmers here, right?

00:01:25.601 --> 00:01:27.767
Or most of us are,
so when you think about, well,

00:01:27.767 --> 00:01:29.601
what does it mean to have
successful software, right?

00:01:29.601 --> 00:01:31.133
There's a lot
of different metrics.

00:01:31.133 --> 00:01:35.100
You can say, well, it's really
fast, or it has a lot of users,

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.334
makes a lot
of money, right?

00:01:36.334 --> 00:01:38.901
Or something,
or maybe it's really clever.

00:01:38.901 --> 00:01:40.100
But there are a lot
of things to think about

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.701
besides the technical side.

00:01:41.701 --> 00:01:44.167
It's not just about
how great your code is.

00:01:44.167 --> 00:01:46.434
It's actually
about...

00:01:46.434 --> 00:01:47.634
Well, there's a whole
social aspect to it

00:01:47.634 --> 00:01:48.968
that a lot
of programmers forget

00:01:48.968 --> 00:01:50.701
because we're so busy
writing code all the time.

00:01:50.701 --> 00:01:52.033
That's what we want
to talk about.

00:01:52.033 --> 00:01:54.033
Fitzpatrick: Right, when
you're thinking about software,

00:01:54.033 --> 00:01:56.267
engineers typically
think about the code,

00:01:56.267 --> 00:02:00.100
and some twist of algorithm,
or writing software,

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.501
or a neat bit of Java
that they might write.

00:02:04.501 --> 00:02:05.501
Collins-Sussman:
That's the meat.

00:02:05.501 --> 00:02:06.968
Fitzpatrick:
Sort of the meat, right?

00:02:06.968 --> 00:02:08.133
So people tend
to think about

00:02:08.133 --> 00:02:11.267
the meat of
your application.

00:02:11.267 --> 00:02:13.601
However, what you
don't really think about

00:02:13.601 --> 00:02:16.400
is sort of, like, making
that look more presentable

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.901
and more appetizing
to our users, right?

00:02:18.901 --> 00:02:22.200
Typically, in the past,
engineers have seen

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.734
what happens when people put
sizzle onto a product, right?

00:02:25.734 --> 00:02:28.968
What you get is you get
a whole bunch of sizzle,

00:02:28.968 --> 00:02:30.834
and you get a whole
lot of no steak.

00:02:30.834 --> 00:02:33.667
Right? And so people
tend to be a little wary--

00:02:33.667 --> 00:02:35.634
Engineers tend to be
a little wary of doing that.

00:02:35.634 --> 00:02:37.133
Collins-Sussman:
Well, it's also usually--

00:02:37.133 --> 00:02:39.067
It's a relationship with
the marketing department, right?

00:02:39.067 --> 00:02:40.667
Ah, what are you doing
to our product?

00:02:40.667 --> 00:02:42.267
What are you
promising about it?

00:02:42.267 --> 00:02:43.834
What are you saying
about it, right?

00:02:43.834 --> 00:02:45.300
And I guess we're here
to talk about how

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.167
that is not necessarily
a bad thing.

00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:49.367
And trying to create
a better understanding

00:02:49.367 --> 00:02:51.434
of what does it mean to add
sizzle to your product--

00:02:51.434 --> 00:02:53.267
how do you make it
presentable to the public

00:02:53.267 --> 00:02:55.534
without feeling like
you're compromising your ideals,

00:02:55.534 --> 00:02:57.167
and, like, it's still
good software?

00:02:57.167 --> 00:02:58.934
Fitzpatrick:
Right. Exactly.

00:02:58.934 --> 00:03:01.734
So a lot of this stuff
is not gonna come

00:03:01.734 --> 00:03:03.033
as a complete
surprise to you.

00:03:03.033 --> 00:03:05.634
This is sort of an opportunity
to bring it together

00:03:05.634 --> 00:03:07.434
as well as to remind you
of some of these things

00:03:07.434 --> 00:03:08.934
that you might not
think of day to day

00:03:08.934 --> 00:03:10.868
when you're sort of
down in the trenches

00:03:10.868 --> 00:03:12.167
writing up an application.

00:03:12.167 --> 00:03:13.267
Collins-Sussman: Pull it
from their subconscious.

00:03:13.267 --> 00:03:14.434
Fitzpatrick:
Exactly.

00:03:14.434 --> 00:03:15.567
So we're gonna focus

00:03:15.567 --> 00:03:19.434
on three particular areas
in this talk.

00:03:19.434 --> 00:03:20.501
Collins-Sussman:
Yeah, so the first part,

00:03:20.501 --> 00:03:21.501
we're gonna talk
about marketing.

00:03:21.501 --> 00:03:22.601
What does it mean?

00:03:22.601 --> 00:03:24.767
How does it relate
to you as a programmer?

00:03:24.767 --> 00:03:26.701
And when you think
about marketing, right--

00:03:26.701 --> 00:03:28.067
Just say the word,
"marketing."

00:03:28.067 --> 00:03:30.100
What is the first thought
that comes to your head, right?

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.400
You probably think
about this guy, right?

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.934
Ah, run away.

00:03:34.934 --> 00:03:36.868
Want nothing to do
with him, right?

00:03:36.868 --> 00:03:39.100
Fitzpatrick: This guy
is all sizzle and no steak.

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.300
Right?

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.534
This is what you tend
to think about, okay?

00:03:42.534 --> 00:03:44.634
The real thing is
is that people are used to--

00:03:44.634 --> 00:03:46.267
when they think
about marketing or stuff,

00:03:46.267 --> 00:03:47.934
engineers are used to
being lied to.

00:03:47.934 --> 00:03:49.133
Okay?

00:03:49.133 --> 00:03:52.267
Engineers don't like
being lied to, okay?

00:03:52.267 --> 00:03:55.801
Anybody know when
 &lt;i&gt;Duke Nukem 3-D&lt;/i&gt; was announced?

00:03:55.801 --> 00:03:56.801
audience member:
[indistinct]

00:03:56.801 --> 00:03:58.801
Fitzpatrick:
1997. Okay?

00:03:58.801 --> 00:04:00.067
That was 11 years ago,

00:04:00.067 --> 00:04:02.234
and it took 'em 11 years
to go out of business.

00:04:02.234 --> 00:04:03.300
Collins-Sussman: 12.
Fitzpatrick: 12?

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:04.300
12 years.
Collins-Sussman: [laughs]

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.434
Fitzpatrick:
12 years ago,

00:04:05.434 --> 00:04:07.033
but they never released
a piece of software.

00:04:07.033 --> 00:04:11.567
And that's the type of distrust
that I think we as engineers

00:04:11.567 --> 00:04:13.767
tend to harbor when we hear
about this type of stuff.

00:04:13.767 --> 00:04:15.501
Collins-Sussman: I think we're
just inoculated as a culture

00:04:15.501 --> 00:04:18.334
to any kind of advertising
or marketing, right?

00:04:18.334 --> 00:04:19.968
We're skeptical
about everything we hear,

00:04:19.968 --> 00:04:22.734
'cause we just believe that
marketing and advertising people

00:04:22.734 --> 00:04:24.400
are always lying
all the time, right?

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.267
Programmers really don't
want anything to do with it.

00:04:26.267 --> 00:04:28.000
Programmers are
very logical people,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.234
they're obsessed
with finding the truth,

00:04:30.234 --> 00:04:31.567
finding the true thing,

00:04:31.567 --> 00:04:34.167
and only talking about,
you know, logical, true stuff.

00:04:34.167 --> 00:04:36.968
I mean, we live
with compilers.

00:04:36.968 --> 00:04:40.634
Those are the tools
we use every single day, right?

00:04:40.634 --> 00:04:41.734
We like order,
we like predictability,

00:04:41.734 --> 00:04:43.067
we like control.

00:04:43.067 --> 00:04:45.934
We don't like listening
to people try to spin things

00:04:45.934 --> 00:04:47.534
and then we're sort of
left to guessing

00:04:47.534 --> 00:04:49.501
as to what's real
and what's not.

00:04:49.501 --> 00:04:51.567
Fitzpatrick: Five years ago
I was the vice president

00:04:51.567 --> 00:04:54.534
of public relations for
the Apache Software Foundation,

00:04:54.534 --> 00:04:57.133
which is an organization
made up almost exclusively

00:04:57.133 --> 00:04:58.868
of engineers.

00:04:58.868 --> 00:05:00.267
And, you know,
most people thought,

00:05:00.267 --> 00:05:01.701
oh, we shouldn't
have to do PR.

00:05:01.701 --> 00:05:02.868
If we write
the best software,

00:05:02.868 --> 00:05:04.501
people are just
gonna come use it.

00:05:04.501 --> 00:05:07.801
And meanwhile,
other web servers

00:05:07.801 --> 00:05:10.133
and other pieces of software
that competed with Apache

00:05:10.133 --> 00:05:13.567
were eating their lunch
because when an analyst

00:05:13.567 --> 00:05:14.968
would come up to a commercial
company and say--

00:05:14.968 --> 00:05:16.167
Collins-Sussman:
"Where's your white paper?"

00:05:16.167 --> 00:05:17.334
Fitzpatrick:
"Where's your white paper?"

00:05:17.334 --> 00:05:18.367
and "We want you
to answer this, this, this,

00:05:18.367 --> 00:05:19.834
this, and this
about your software,"

00:05:19.834 --> 00:05:22.501
and the company would, you know,
have four or five PR flacks

00:05:22.501 --> 00:05:24.000
get down on their knees
and then worship the analyst

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.400
and tell them
how wonderful they are,

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.400
and they do all their work
for them and hand it to them.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.968
And an analyst
shows up at Apache

00:05:28.968 --> 00:05:30.501
for one project
in particular,

00:05:30.501 --> 00:05:31.767
which will remain nameless,

00:05:31.767 --> 00:05:34.067
and says, "Hey, we want
to know this, this, and this

00:05:34.067 --> 00:05:35.767
"about your projects,
and blah, blah, blah,

00:05:35.767 --> 00:05:37.033
"we're gonna write
a paper, et cetera,

00:05:37.033 --> 00:05:38.334
and go do all this work,"

00:05:38.334 --> 00:05:41.100
and their basic response was,
"Go screw yourself.

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.400
Join the mailing list
and find it yourself."

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.868
Collins-Sussman: "Go read,
you know. Go read our docs."

00:05:44.868 --> 00:05:45.868
Fitzpatrick: Right.

00:05:45.868 --> 00:05:47.033
Collins-Sussman:
"Not our problem."

00:05:47.033 --> 00:05:48.901
Fitzpatrick: So the best
approach probably lies

00:05:48.901 --> 00:05:51.400
somewhere in between
those two approaches.

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.567
The sort of sycophantic
begging, and then

00:05:53.567 --> 00:05:55.901
the, like, "Go read
the mailing list."

00:05:55.901 --> 00:05:57.167
Collins-Sussman:
Absolutely.

00:05:57.167 --> 00:06:00.334
I mean, the other thing
that programmers like to do

00:06:00.334 --> 00:06:02.534
is especially when
it comes to legal things,

00:06:02.534 --> 00:06:04.934
they start trying
to interpret the law, right?

00:06:04.934 --> 00:06:06.667
I mean, there's a lot
of issues that have to do

00:06:06.667 --> 00:06:08.968
with marketing and PR,
and they always get entangled

00:06:08.968 --> 00:06:11.701
with legal discussions, right,
licensing,

00:06:11.701 --> 00:06:13.868
and what are we allowed
to say and or not say,

00:06:13.868 --> 00:06:17.167
and programmers love to look
at laws and licenses

00:06:17.167 --> 00:06:19.634
and try to process
them like code,

00:06:19.634 --> 00:06:22.000
when in fact, if you are
a lawyer, or you know lawyers,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.868
they will laugh at you if you
talk about that idea, right?

00:06:23.868 --> 00:06:26.300
'Cause the legal system
is not perfectly rational.

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:27.467
It's not logical.
Fitzpatrick: What?

00:06:27.467 --> 00:06:29.133
Collins-Sussman:
I know, it's crazy.

00:06:29.133 --> 00:06:30.968
Fitzpatrick: Yeah, if you're
ever talking about something

00:06:30.968 --> 00:06:33.834
legal with a license, you say,
"well, it should do something,"

00:06:33.834 --> 00:06:35.167
stop yourself right there

00:06:35.167 --> 00:06:36.601
because you're clearly
going down the wrong path.

00:06:36.601 --> 00:06:38.000
Collins-Sussman:
Absolutely.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.601
Fitzpatrick: But beyond this
sort of obsession with truth

00:06:39.601 --> 00:06:44.467
is that we expect some sort
of a meritocracy, I guess.

00:06:44.467 --> 00:06:48.300
That people put the most
effort into something

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:51.067
or the best
technical thing would win.

00:06:51.067 --> 00:06:52.434
Collins-Sussman:
Right, but if that were true,

00:06:52.434 --> 00:06:54.234
we'd all be using Betamax--

00:06:54.234 --> 00:06:56.300
well, nobody uses
VHS either anymore--

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:57.567
but the classic
story, right?

00:06:57.567 --> 00:06:58.934
Fitzpatrick:
But it had a good run.

00:06:58.934 --> 00:07:01.367
Collins-Sussman: Betamax
was technically superior to VHS,

00:07:01.367 --> 00:07:02.701
and yet VHS won, right?

00:07:02.701 --> 00:07:04.968
So not everything--
the technically superior product

00:07:04.968 --> 00:07:06.400
does not always
win, right?

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.968
That is not the only metric
you need to think about

00:07:08.968 --> 00:07:10.267
when you're saying,

00:07:10.267 --> 00:07:11.834
"well, how is my product
gonna be successful?"

00:07:11.834 --> 00:07:13.434
You need some sizzle.
Fitzpatrick: Right.

00:07:13.434 --> 00:07:14.501
Collins-Sussman:
To some degree you need it.

00:07:14.501 --> 00:07:15.834
Whether you like it or not.

00:07:15.834 --> 00:07:16.834
Fitzpatrick: So the point
that I try to make is that

00:07:16.834 --> 00:07:18.501
truth is actually fungible.

00:07:18.501 --> 00:07:20.634
Okay, there are
different shades of truth,

00:07:20.634 --> 00:07:22.334
and this is a mean that
I've been trying to propagate

00:07:22.334 --> 00:07:25.067
for years, which is that
perception--not procession--

00:07:25.067 --> 00:07:27.534
but perception
is 9/10 of the law.

00:07:27.534 --> 00:07:28.767
What it comes
down to is that--

00:07:28.767 --> 00:07:29.934
Collins-Sussman:
First perception.

00:07:29.934 --> 00:07:32.100
Fitzpatrick:
Exactly.

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:35.100
What people see is the reality,
whether or not it's true.

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:36.434
What people will believe.

00:07:36.434 --> 00:07:38.267
And marketers have used that
to their advantage

00:07:38.267 --> 00:07:39.567
for years and years
and years.

00:07:39.567 --> 00:07:41.167
There's no reason
that we as engineers

00:07:41.167 --> 00:07:42.501
shouldn't do that as well.

00:07:42.501 --> 00:07:44.467
Collins-Sussman: Typically
in the first 2, 5 minutes

00:07:44.467 --> 00:07:46.133
of using a piece of software,

00:07:46.133 --> 00:07:47.767
you formed an opinion about it,
right?

00:07:47.767 --> 00:07:49.634
It doesn't matter whether
you've--you know,

00:07:49.634 --> 00:07:51.033
whether you read the docs

00:07:51.033 --> 00:07:53.033
or you should have read
the docs, right,

00:07:53.033 --> 00:07:55.434
or you get an opinion
about it very quickly.

00:07:55.434 --> 00:07:58.367
There's either a good
or a bad barrier to entry,

00:07:58.367 --> 00:07:59.901
and then you've
made up your--

00:07:59.901 --> 00:08:01.601
and that's the truth
you now live with.

00:08:01.601 --> 00:08:03.434
You have a certain feeling
about this software,

00:08:03.434 --> 00:08:05.868
whether you were fair
in judging it or not.

00:08:05.868 --> 00:08:06.968
Fitzpatrick:
Well, with Subversion

00:08:06.968 --> 00:08:08.100
we were particularly
conservative

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:09.901
in calling Subversion 1.0

00:08:09.901 --> 00:08:12.200
because when it comes
to a version control system,

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.601
if it loses your data,

00:08:13.601 --> 00:08:15.133
you're probably
never gonna come back.

00:08:15.133 --> 00:08:18.434
Okay, data--that's sort of
an important thing.

00:08:18.434 --> 00:08:20.067
It's not really the best,

00:08:20.067 --> 00:08:22.767
technically the best version
control system out there,

00:08:22.767 --> 00:08:24.501
but it was generally
perceived

00:08:24.501 --> 00:08:28.133
by people as being
a good thing.

00:08:28.133 --> 00:08:29.901
Moving along,

00:08:29.901 --> 00:08:31.801
one other thing
that you can sort of have

00:08:31.801 --> 00:08:32.968
the sizzle in the steak

00:08:32.968 --> 00:08:34.734
is that under-promise
and over-deliver.

00:08:34.734 --> 00:08:37.033
You still have great things
to give to people,

00:08:37.033 --> 00:08:38.968
you still have a great
piece of software,

00:08:38.968 --> 00:08:40.534
but you don't have
to tell them everything

00:08:40.534 --> 00:08:41.634
that you want
to give, maybe,

00:08:41.634 --> 00:08:43.267
so you tell 'em
the first few things.

00:08:43.267 --> 00:08:44.834
I come from New Orleans,

00:08:44.834 --> 00:08:46.868
and in New Orleans
we talk about lagniappe,

00:08:46.868 --> 00:08:48.501
okay, a little bit
of something extra.

00:08:48.501 --> 00:08:50.300
Like you buy
a dozen doughnuts,

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:51.734
you get an extra doughnut
free.

00:08:51.734 --> 00:08:54.000
You buy five pounds of meat and
you get a pound of liver free.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.801
I don't know why that was
ever a good thing,

00:08:55.801 --> 00:08:57.267
but apparently that's the way
it worked back in the day.

00:08:57.267 --> 00:08:58.434
Collins-Sussman:
But you certainly

00:08:58.434 --> 00:08:59.667
don't market that, right?

00:08:59.667 --> 00:09:02.501
You don't write that
in the coupons, right?

00:09:02.501 --> 00:09:05.133
It's just one
of those things you do.

00:09:05.133 --> 00:09:06.367
In the same way
we're talking

00:09:06.367 --> 00:09:07.734
about under-promise
and over-delivering,

00:09:07.734 --> 00:09:09.868
Google, as a policy,
doesn't pre-announce products.

00:09:09.868 --> 00:09:12.767
We don't send out endless
press releases saying,

00:09:12.767 --> 00:09:13.934
"We're working
on this cool thing.

00:09:13.934 --> 00:09:16.834
It'll be done
this quarter."

00:09:16.834 --> 00:09:19.834
'Cause then essentially
we set ourselves up for failure.

00:09:19.834 --> 00:09:23.133
It's a matter of, you know,
surprising people,

00:09:23.133 --> 00:09:24.501
and saying,
"Isn't that wonderful?"

00:09:24.501 --> 00:09:26.033
Fitzpatrick: You set your
expectations really high,

00:09:26.033 --> 00:09:27.234
and then you wind up
with something

00:09:27.234 --> 00:09:28.868
people aren't
looking forward to.

00:09:28.868 --> 00:09:31.501
So that's sort of
the marketing angle,

00:09:31.501 --> 00:09:33.901
and we want to talk a little bit
about customer service.

00:09:33.901 --> 00:09:35.567
Now, sort of close your eyes
for a second and think--

00:09:35.567 --> 00:09:37.934
what do you think about when
you hear "customer service"?

00:09:37.934 --> 00:09:38.934
Collins-Sussman: Mmm...

00:09:38.934 --> 00:09:39.934
Fitzpatrick:
In this day and age,

00:09:39.934 --> 00:09:41.367
especially
in the United States,

00:09:41.367 --> 00:09:42.667
people think
of customer service,

00:09:42.667 --> 00:09:46.467
they think of a service-oriented
industry where someone

00:09:46.467 --> 00:09:48.934
is doing something
for someone else,

00:09:48.934 --> 00:09:50.267
and sort of a one-on-one
kind of thing.

00:09:50.267 --> 00:09:51.467
Collins-Sussman: But it's
also sort of considered

00:09:51.467 --> 00:09:52.634
the bottom
of the ladder, right?

00:09:52.634 --> 00:09:54.200
Like, working the help desk
in a company.

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.834
Oh, my, no.
Customer service tech support.

00:09:56.834 --> 00:10:00.000
Got to get out of there.
What a waste of time, right?

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.501
Fitzpatrick: So we have
a graph here

00:10:01.501 --> 00:10:04.534
that we spent
minutes researching.

00:10:04.534 --> 00:10:07.334
It's basically--
you start off, and you--

00:10:07.334 --> 00:10:09.167
if you have
a successful piece of software,

00:10:09.167 --> 00:10:10.667
you're going to get
more users over time.

00:10:10.667 --> 00:10:12.200
That's what
everybody wants, I think.

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:13.701
I don't think there's
anyone in this room

00:10:13.701 --> 00:10:16.334
who writes software that doesn't
want more people to use it.

00:10:16.334 --> 00:10:18.434
The problem is is that
as you add users,

00:10:18.434 --> 00:10:20.033
you don't stop
writing code.

00:10:20.033 --> 00:10:22.501
You continue
adding to your--

00:10:22.501 --> 00:10:24.300
the complexity
of your application.

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:25.901
Collins-Sussman:
More and more features,

00:10:25.901 --> 00:10:28.501
more and more
feature creep, at least.

00:10:28.501 --> 00:10:29.834
Maybe the users
are asking--

00:10:29.834 --> 00:10:31.968
Maybe the power users
are asking for more features

00:10:31.968 --> 00:10:34.200
so you're like, "Great, more
code, throw it in, throw it in.

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.467
Look how great this is."

00:10:35.467 --> 00:10:37.334
Fitzpatrick: The problem
is is that as time goes on,

00:10:37.334 --> 00:10:38.834
and your user base widens,

00:10:38.834 --> 00:10:40.667
you attract less tech-savvy
users.

00:10:40.667 --> 00:10:42.000
Okay?

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.601
And the combination of these
three different factors

00:10:44.601 --> 00:10:46.734
results in an exponential
increase in despair.

00:10:46.734 --> 00:10:47.901
Collins-Sussman:
Very carefully measured.

00:10:47.901 --> 00:10:49.133
Fitzpatrick:
Very carefully measured.

00:10:49.133 --> 00:10:50.300
Exactly.

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:52.501
But the point is is that
this is something

00:10:52.501 --> 00:10:53.767
that's really
important to realize,

00:10:53.767 --> 00:10:55.467
is that this complexity
is very difficult

00:10:55.467 --> 00:10:58.534
for users to sort of
grok and understand,

00:10:58.534 --> 00:11:00.567
but you have to listen
to them.

00:11:00.567 --> 00:11:02.167
This is part
of customer service.

00:11:02.167 --> 00:11:04.334
You shouldn't just
assume that they're dumb.

00:11:04.334 --> 00:11:05.968
We had a talk
yesterday at the ignite

00:11:05.968 --> 00:11:07.968
that was just fantastic
where they were talking

00:11:07.968 --> 00:11:11.567
about, you know,
give your users the real thing.

00:11:11.567 --> 00:11:12.901
Don't give them
some dumbed-down,

00:11:12.901 --> 00:11:14.133
toy version of that thing.

00:11:14.133 --> 00:11:15.167
I think that's a great point.

00:11:15.167 --> 00:11:16.467
Collins-Sussman:
Right.

00:11:16.467 --> 00:11:18.167
I mean, they're not
dumb people necessarily--

00:11:18.167 --> 00:11:19.701
Sure, a few of them
out there are dumb,

00:11:19.701 --> 00:11:22.501
but there's not a safe
assumption to assume

00:11:22.501 --> 00:11:25.868
that just because somebody's
asking a question or needs help

00:11:25.868 --> 00:11:27.400
or doesn't understand something
about your software

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:30.834
that they're inherently
dumb in general,

00:11:30.834 --> 00:11:32.300
or they're just not
techie people, right?

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:33.734
I mean,
if something is wrong

00:11:33.734 --> 00:11:35.367
you actually need
to hear what's going on,

00:11:35.367 --> 00:11:38.400
and the first step
is not be condescending.

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:40.934
It's to respect
and listen carefully

00:11:40.934 --> 00:11:42.367
and really try to get
some empathy going

00:11:42.367 --> 00:11:43.901
with what
they're experiencing.

00:11:43.901 --> 00:11:47.100
I mean, we're so used to being
holed up with our compilers

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:50.200
and our code that we sort of
lose all perspective

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:52.734
of what the rest
of the world sees.

00:11:52.734 --> 00:11:54.400
Fitzpatrick: Right, and people
just want to be heard.

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:57.734
So give them
an opportunity to be heard.

00:11:57.734 --> 00:12:00.434
Even if they're not
writing code for you,

00:12:00.434 --> 00:12:01.934
they can give you
valuable feedback.

00:12:01.934 --> 00:12:02.934
Collins-Sussman:
You can let them

00:12:02.934 --> 00:12:04.767
file bugs
in your issue tracker

00:12:04.767 --> 00:12:06.534
and respond with them,

00:12:06.534 --> 00:12:07.834
so then they
at least feel like

00:12:07.834 --> 00:12:10.467
you are listening
to them in some degree.

00:12:10.467 --> 00:12:13.400
Fitzpatrick: An example of this
is Google Moderator.

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:14.834
We've--you know, I mean...
Collins-Sussman: Oh, yeah.

00:12:14.834 --> 00:12:16.367
Fitzpatrick: The White House
recently used that

00:12:16.367 --> 00:12:18.200
to sort of get
questions from people.

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:20.501
And setting up a moderator
instance for, you know--

00:12:20.501 --> 00:12:21.501
What do you guys want?

00:12:21.501 --> 00:12:22.667
Let's get some feedback,

00:12:22.667 --> 00:12:24.367
and let's get some people
to vote it off.

00:12:24.367 --> 00:12:26.801
In the issue tracker,
users can star things,

00:12:26.801 --> 00:12:28.234
and you can sort of
see themes.

00:12:28.234 --> 00:12:31.434
And we notice this very clearly
in Google Code itself.

00:12:31.434 --> 00:12:33.934
We have an issue tracker
for the product.

00:12:33.934 --> 00:12:35.734
and we heard very clearly
different pain points

00:12:35.734 --> 00:12:37.801
that people had,
and different features

00:12:37.801 --> 00:12:39.467
that they really expected
the product to have.

00:12:39.467 --> 00:12:40.934
Collins-Sussman: The trends
become really obvious

00:12:40.934 --> 00:12:42.667
if you start
deliberately listening

00:12:42.667 --> 00:12:45.901
and open--creating some kind of
open forum to get feedback.

00:12:45.901 --> 00:12:48.400
It becomes very obvious
what's important and what's not.

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:49.701
rather than, you know,

00:12:49.701 --> 00:12:53.467
just what you happen
to think is important

00:12:53.467 --> 00:12:54.701
it's really
important to listen

00:12:54.701 --> 00:12:55.901
and get that data
from the outside,

00:12:55.901 --> 00:12:57.501
not just from the inside.

00:12:57.501 --> 00:13:00.367
But there's a fear there.

00:13:00.367 --> 00:13:02.167
People tend to be
afraid of doing that.

00:13:02.167 --> 00:13:05.367
First of all, because they get
a lot of crazy ideas, okay?

00:13:05.367 --> 00:13:07.734
And they feel like, oh, God,
if people start saying this

00:13:07.734 --> 00:13:08.734
I'm gonna have to
wind up writing this,

00:13:08.734 --> 00:13:10.234
which is not true.

00:13:10.234 --> 00:13:11.834
Collins-Sussman: You don't
have to listen to every quack.

00:13:11.834 --> 00:13:13.100
Fitzpatrick:
You don't have to listen

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:15.501
to every single idea
that comes in the long tail.

00:13:15.501 --> 00:13:18.033
Just pay attention
to the ideas

00:13:18.033 --> 00:13:19.667
that you're hearing
over and over again,

00:13:19.667 --> 00:13:21.133
or the questions,
or the themes,

00:13:21.133 --> 00:13:22.467
or the bugs,
that sort of thing.

00:13:22.467 --> 00:13:25.567
Try to do fewer
things better.

00:13:25.567 --> 00:13:28.133
And we sort of use
a metric of target in the 80%.

00:13:28.133 --> 00:13:29.467
As opposed to the 100%.

00:13:29.467 --> 00:13:30.901
Collins-Sussman:
Right, it's really--

00:13:30.901 --> 00:13:34.000
I think it's really great
that if your product can do 80%,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.234
it can solve 80% of everybody's
pain really really well,

00:13:37.234 --> 00:13:38.534
you're great.

00:13:38.534 --> 00:13:40.434
You see a lot of failure
happens when people

00:13:40.434 --> 00:13:42.667
try to be absolutely
everything to everyone.

00:13:42.667 --> 00:13:44.167
Every bell and whistle
in the world.

00:13:44.167 --> 00:13:46.868
I mean, I guess one example
is Emacs, right? [laughs]

00:13:46.868 --> 00:13:47.868
Fitzpatrick:
Exactly.

00:13:47.868 --> 00:13:50.400
It's everything
to no one.

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.601
Well, a quick survey--
who in the room uses Emacs?

00:13:52.601 --> 00:13:54.467
Raise your hand.

00:13:54.467 --> 00:13:56.033
Who uses the I?

00:13:56.033 --> 00:13:57.767
Okay, fight.

00:13:57.767 --> 00:13:59.334
No, just kidding.
[laughter]

00:13:59.334 --> 00:14:00.534
But seriously,
though, I mean,

00:14:00.534 --> 00:14:02.167
I've been an Emacs user
for 12 years,

00:14:02.167 --> 00:14:05.601
and it makes me crazy 'cause
it's just like the Swiss Army--

00:14:05.601 --> 00:14:07.334
Collins-Sussman: Occasionally
you will see products out there

00:14:07.334 --> 00:14:09.501
that try to be
everything to everyone.

00:14:09.501 --> 00:14:11.567
There's some wacky--
We're not sure what this is.

00:14:11.567 --> 00:14:12.734
I think it's...

00:14:12.734 --> 00:14:14.400
Fitzpatrick: We actually
do know what this is,

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:15.734
so don't email us
afterwards.

00:14:15.734 --> 00:14:17.501
People emailing us explaining
exactly what it is.

00:14:17.501 --> 00:14:19.033
But, you know--

00:14:19.033 --> 00:14:20.334
Collins-Sussman: Well, there's
more than one version of it,

00:14:20.334 --> 00:14:21.601
so it must be
important, right?

00:14:21.601 --> 00:14:23.133
Fitzpatrick: It has a lantern
on the back, too.

00:14:23.133 --> 00:14:24.501
A big, like, tube lamp.

00:14:24.501 --> 00:14:26.133
Collins-Sussman: But it's got
a competitor, right?

00:14:26.133 --> 00:14:28.968
Fitzpatrick: Right, and there's
more of these things.

00:14:28.968 --> 00:14:30.801
Collins-Sussman:
Don't be this. [laughing]

00:14:30.801 --> 00:14:32.501
Fitzpatrick: So this
is an example of something

00:14:32.501 --> 00:14:33.634
that's just utterly
terribly designed

00:14:33.634 --> 00:14:34.868
'cause it's trying to be--

00:14:34.868 --> 00:14:36.267
I think it's trying
to be too many things.

00:14:36.267 --> 00:14:37.734
I understand it's an emergency
gadget, remember that.

00:14:37.734 --> 00:14:39.300
Collins-Sussman: Okay.
But what's a good example?

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:41.634
Fitzpatrick:
Here's a great example, okay?

00:14:41.634 --> 00:14:43.434
You can't boil
an egg in this,

00:14:43.434 --> 00:14:46.801
you can't--you know, you can't
cook a whole turkey in it.

00:14:46.801 --> 00:14:47.968
It's a toaster oven.

00:14:47.968 --> 00:14:49.767
You can make toast,
you can toast a bagel,

00:14:49.767 --> 00:14:51.300
you can do some small
pieces of fish, maybe...

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:52.300
Collins-Sussman:
Make pizza.

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:53.968
Fitzpatrick:
It does it really well.

00:14:53.968 --> 00:14:55.234
And after we gave
this talk last year,

00:14:55.234 --> 00:14:56.234
someone sent me
a picture of a toaster

00:14:56.234 --> 00:14:57.234
with a radio
on the side of it.

00:14:57.234 --> 00:14:58.567
Collins-Sussman:
Argh...

00:14:58.567 --> 00:14:59.567
Fitzpatrick: I'm like,
you don't get the point;

00:14:59.567 --> 00:15:00.968
that's not the point.

00:15:00.968 --> 00:15:03.033
Collins-Sussman: So this is--
this does a lot of things.

00:15:03.033 --> 00:15:04.434
Most things
for most people.

00:15:04.434 --> 00:15:06.200
Incredibly useful
to a wide variety of people.

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:07.567
Doesn't do
absolutely everything,

00:15:07.567 --> 00:15:09.634
but boy, you know,
it hits that sweet spot.

00:15:09.634 --> 00:15:11.667
So the next thing
you need to think about,

00:15:11.667 --> 00:15:13.901
I guess, is trust.

00:15:13.901 --> 00:15:16.400
And what we mean
by that is it is--

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:17.901
Nice effect.

00:15:17.901 --> 00:15:20.267
It's an irreplaceable
resource.

00:15:20.267 --> 00:15:21.968
Trust is one of these
things that you--

00:15:21.968 --> 00:15:23.701
It's a reputation
that you build up

00:15:23.701 --> 00:15:26.334
with your users, and it's
one of those things that--

00:15:26.334 --> 00:15:28.200
Makes me think of it
as, like, a bank account.

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:30.901
Every time you do something
well, or you listen to people,

00:15:30.901 --> 00:15:34.100
or, you know, you help solve
their problem in some way,

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:35.267
you get a little
bit of money,

00:15:35.267 --> 00:15:36.934
you put it
in that bank account of trust.

00:15:36.934 --> 00:15:39.801
But it's very, very easy
to destroy that bank account.

00:15:39.801 --> 00:15:41.801
You do one evil thing,

00:15:41.801 --> 00:15:44.434
or one thing that's
a slap in the face of the users,

00:15:44.434 --> 00:15:45.534
and all the trust is gone.

00:15:45.534 --> 00:15:47.000
Fitzpatrick:
Well, people typically

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.834
do that
for short-term gains.

00:15:48.834 --> 00:15:51.367
Your temptation to betray
user's trust, I think,

00:15:51.367 --> 00:15:54.467
is for short-term gain, which
results in a long-term loss.

00:15:54.467 --> 00:15:56.100
If you get users
to trust you,

00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:57.400
and they like your product,

00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:59.100
they'll stay with you
through thick and thin

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:00.534
for a very long time.

00:16:00.534 --> 00:16:02.267
And the best
example of this

00:16:02.267 --> 00:16:05.400
is how many people
in this room own a car?

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:07.934
How many people in this room
have a mechanic that they trust?

00:16:07.934 --> 00:16:09.267
Collins-Sussman:
[laughs]

00:16:09.267 --> 00:16:11.567
Fitzpatrick: Okay, see me
after this talk, please.

00:16:11.567 --> 00:16:13.634
No, but seriously,
this is a great example of--

00:16:13.634 --> 00:16:14.868
Collins-Sussman:
Why is that?

00:16:14.868 --> 00:16:17.033
Fitzpatrick: I think mechanics,
for the most part,

00:16:17.033 --> 00:16:19.167
aren't interested
in long-term customers.

00:16:19.167 --> 00:16:20.334
I think it's harder
to do that.

00:16:20.334 --> 00:16:21.434
Collins-Sussman:
It's an assembly line.

00:16:21.434 --> 00:16:23.200
Right?
In these typical situations--

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:24.367
Oh, my car
needs maintenance.

00:16:24.367 --> 00:16:26.400
I'll go take it
to some random dealer,

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:28.467
who I have no real personal
relationship with,

00:16:28.467 --> 00:16:30.167
and they put it
through an assembly line.

00:16:30.167 --> 00:16:31.467
Then they always
try to up-sell you

00:16:31.467 --> 00:16:33.200
to do something that you
don't really need, right?

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:35.601
And we kind of
expect it at this point.

00:16:35.601 --> 00:16:38.434
Fitzpatrick: My grandfather
owned--managed a Firestone store

00:16:38.434 --> 00:16:41.868
for 35 years,
and after the first 20 years,

00:16:41.868 --> 00:16:44.067
95% of his customers
were returning.

00:16:44.067 --> 00:16:45.567
Return customers.

00:16:45.567 --> 00:16:47.100
And that's because
he never tried to sell 'em--

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:48.467
They come in
for a flat tire,

00:16:48.467 --> 00:16:50.067
he'd never try and sell 'em
a radiator flush.

00:16:50.067 --> 00:16:51.400
"Oh, it looks like
you need

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:54.100
your flob-dangle zip-zopped
or something like that."

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:55.434
Collins-Sussman: Absolutely.
Fitzpatrick: People--

00:16:55.434 --> 00:16:57.501
I don't think people--

00:16:57.501 --> 00:16:58.801
Whether you know a lot
about a car or not,

00:16:58.801 --> 00:16:59.934
I think it leaves you

00:16:59.934 --> 00:17:01.400
with a sort of sick feeling
in your throat,

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:05.334
like, "I'm being played,"
you know, to some extent.

00:17:05.334 --> 00:17:07.200
But we've got an example of that
in Subversion as well, right?

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:08.834
Collins-Sussman: We worked
on the Subversion Project

00:17:08.834 --> 00:17:10.133
for many years,
and one of the things

00:17:10.133 --> 00:17:12.300
we set out
at the beginning

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:15.067
is Subversion is basically
gonna be a set of APIs

00:17:15.067 --> 00:17:16.601
with a small binary
that uses them.

00:17:16.601 --> 00:17:18.467
'Cause we wanted people
to connect to them

00:17:18.467 --> 00:17:20.300
and write alternate clients
and things.

00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:22.968
But our APIs are very,
very structured.

00:17:22.968 --> 00:17:24.133
They occur at many levels,

00:17:24.133 --> 00:17:25.767
and they're full
of all sorts of promises

00:17:25.767 --> 00:17:28.334
that "we will not change this,
we will not change this."

00:17:28.334 --> 00:17:30.100
When new versions
of the product come out,

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:31.834
we very explicitly
mark it.

00:17:31.834 --> 00:17:33.300
Old APIs as deprecated,

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:35.434
we do not get rid of them,
we make sure they work,

00:17:35.434 --> 00:17:37.267
we keep them testing,
and that's just about--

00:17:37.267 --> 00:17:38.367
you know, that's a certain

00:17:38.367 --> 00:17:40.000
kind of relationship
with programmers.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.100
They are another
kind of user--

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:43.234
Fitzpatrick:
But we reap the benefit--

00:17:43.234 --> 00:17:44.767
We still get the benefits
of that today

00:17:44.767 --> 00:17:46.167
'cause Tortoise SVN was--

00:17:46.167 --> 00:17:48.167
which is an amazing piece
of software.

00:17:48.167 --> 00:17:49.734
You know, those guys wrote

00:17:49.734 --> 00:17:52.133
a really complex piece
of software

00:17:52.133 --> 00:17:55.267
where that just made Subversion
much more popular in general.

00:17:55.267 --> 00:17:56.501
Collins-Sussman:
Absolutely.

00:17:56.501 --> 00:17:58.501
The thing you need
to think about

00:17:58.501 --> 00:18:00.567
when you're listening
to a user, right.

00:18:00.567 --> 00:18:02.334
Someone's giving you
a piece of feedback--

00:18:02.334 --> 00:18:04.267
You often have to read
between the lines.

00:18:04.267 --> 00:18:05.734
What we mean by that is

00:18:05.734 --> 00:18:07.367
do what I want,
not what I say.

00:18:07.367 --> 00:18:10.100
So, I mean, I had this problem--
like, for example,

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:13.033
trying to teach your parents,
who may not be tech savvy,

00:18:13.033 --> 00:18:14.367
how to use a computer.

00:18:14.367 --> 00:18:16.534
Maybe you're on the phone
with them or something.

00:18:16.534 --> 00:18:18.567
They're saying one thing,

00:18:18.567 --> 00:18:20.033
and usually you have
to sort of listen,

00:18:20.033 --> 00:18:21.767
and it becomes a skill,

00:18:21.767 --> 00:18:23.534
like, well, I think
what they really mean is X,

00:18:23.534 --> 00:18:24.901
or they're
describing something

00:18:24.901 --> 00:18:26.300
in a way that's
not familiar to you.

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:27.868
Doesn't mean they're dumb,

00:18:27.868 --> 00:18:29.467
it just means they don't know
the same lingo as you, right?

00:18:29.467 --> 00:18:31.234
Or maybe they don't know
how computers work--

00:18:31.234 --> 00:18:33.000
Fitzpatrick: People have
a different mental model.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.701
I mean, people have
a very different mental model

00:18:34.701 --> 00:18:36.501
of computers--
how computers work.

00:18:36.501 --> 00:18:38.167
Especially if they're
not engineers.

00:18:38.167 --> 00:18:40.267
And I'm gonna digress
for a moment and tell a story

00:18:40.267 --> 00:18:42.400
about a pencil sharpener

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:44.501
to give you an idea
of how different

00:18:44.501 --> 00:18:46.434
peoples' mental models are.

00:18:46.434 --> 00:18:48.601
A couple years ago,
my grandmother said, you know,

00:18:48.601 --> 00:18:51.200
"Is your grandfather's computer
still any good?"

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:54.167
Now it's
a 1990 Macintosh SE.

00:18:54.167 --> 00:18:56.501
You know, and it hasn't been
used in six or seven years.

00:18:56.501 --> 00:18:58.167
I said, "Oh, you know,
I really don't think so.

00:18:58.167 --> 00:18:59.267
"It's black and white,

00:18:59.267 --> 00:19:00.801
"it doesn't have
an Internet connection,

00:19:00.801 --> 00:19:03.467
"you know, it's probably
best to just, you know,

00:19:03.467 --> 00:19:05.567
give it away
or recycle it or something."

00:19:05.567 --> 00:19:06.834
She said, "Oh, okay,

00:19:06.834 --> 00:19:08.033
'cause I only ever
turn it on anymore

00:19:08.033 --> 00:19:10.200
when I need
to sharpen a pencil.

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:11.701
Collins-Sussman:
[laughs]

00:19:11.701 --> 00:19:13.400
Fitzpatrick: And I stopped,
and I scratched my head,

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:15.467
and I lis--played that back
again in my head,

00:19:15.467 --> 00:19:17.100
and I realized
I really have to know.

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:18.400
I probably don't
want to know,

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:20.234
but I have to know
what she's talking about.

00:19:20.234 --> 00:19:21.701
So I start asking
some questions.

00:19:21.701 --> 00:19:23.701
"Well, that's
interesting, grandma."

00:19:23.701 --> 00:19:27.367
And it turns out that she has
an electric pencil sharpener

00:19:27.367 --> 00:19:29.200
that's plugged
into a power strip,

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:32.400
into which this Macintosh
has been plugged into.

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:35.167
So once a week
she'd take her pencils,

00:19:35.167 --> 00:19:37.868
she would go
into the office,

00:19:37.868 --> 00:19:39.167
she would turn on
the power strip,

00:19:39.167 --> 00:19:40.734
and the little Mac
would go, "beep,"

00:19:40.734 --> 00:19:42.467
and it would start
firing up his hard drive

00:19:42.467 --> 00:19:43.868
and reading
its operating system,

00:19:43.868 --> 00:19:47.100
and she'd sharpen her pencils,
and she'd kill it.

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:49.033
Collins-Sussman: Cut the power.
Fitzpatrick: Mercilessly.

00:19:49.033 --> 00:19:51.400
Before it even
booted up.

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:53.067
I-I--To let you know...
Collins-Sussman: Poor Mac.

00:19:53.067 --> 00:19:56.067
Fitzpatrick: I rescued
this poor Mac from its fate,

00:19:56.067 --> 00:19:57.501
and it's been
put out to pasture

00:19:57.501 --> 00:20:00.868
with all the other Macs
and Commodore 64s and whatnot.

00:20:00.868 --> 00:20:02.634
Collins-Sussman: That is a good
story about mental models.

00:20:02.634 --> 00:20:03.968
Fitzpatrick:
Right.

00:20:03.968 --> 00:20:05.567
I mean, this made
perfect sense to her, right?

00:20:05.567 --> 00:20:09.467
But beyond that,
seriously--

00:20:09.467 --> 00:20:11.000
Beyond just listening
to your users

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.934
and focusing on giving them
good service,

00:20:12.934 --> 00:20:14.467
take the opportunity
to delight them, you know?

00:20:14.467 --> 00:20:15.801
Collins-Sussman:
This is an art.

00:20:15.801 --> 00:20:17.367
Fitzpatrick: Being whimsical
isn't actually bad.

00:20:17.367 --> 00:20:18.634
I think it is an art.

00:20:18.634 --> 00:20:20.300
And it's somewhat
of a cultural thing

00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:21.734
across some pieces
of software.

00:20:21.734 --> 00:20:24.200
Some pieces of software,
I think, do this really well.

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:25.400
Collins-Sussman: Well,
they'll put Easter eggs in,

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:26.467
or they'll do silly things,

00:20:26.467 --> 00:20:27.767
but just something
so they're

00:20:27.767 --> 00:20:29.934
not taking the host
quite so seriously.

00:20:29.934 --> 00:20:32.501
They understand that there's
some empathy going on

00:20:32.501 --> 00:20:35.100
between the software
and the company, and the user.

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:36.701
It's not just
this formal relationship.

00:20:36.701 --> 00:20:38.200
Fitzpatrick:
Right, right.

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:39.868
Collins-Sussman: So I mean
Google's an example of that.

00:20:39.868 --> 00:20:41.200
We do a lot
of silly things.

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:43.334
We've got doodles that,
you know, happen year-round,

00:20:43.334 --> 00:20:45.400
and we get unbelievable
amounts of email

00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:46.901
about particular doodles--

00:20:46.901 --> 00:20:48.968
why we did do a certain doodle,
or didn't do a certain doodle.

00:20:48.968 --> 00:20:50.501
Fitzpatrick: But no matter
what they do,

00:20:50.501 --> 00:20:51.901
they get a big pile
of, "We love this!"

00:20:51.901 --> 00:20:53.501
and a big pile
of, "We hate this!"

00:20:53.501 --> 00:20:54.901
Collins-Sussman: I'll talk
to my relatives; they're like,

00:20:54.901 --> 00:20:57.234
"Oh, did you see the doodle
that Google did last week?"

00:20:57.234 --> 00:20:59.133
and I'm like,
"Uh, I guess so."

00:20:59.133 --> 00:21:02.033
Fitzpatrick: We're talking about
inspiring passion in users.

00:21:02.033 --> 00:21:05.701
I personally don't care
if you guys love this talk,

00:21:05.701 --> 00:21:07.901
or hate everything we say
and disagree with it all,

00:21:07.901 --> 00:21:10.300
as long as we spark
some reaction in folks

00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:12.067
and make you think
a little bit about something.

00:21:12.067 --> 00:21:14.000
You know,
if you're asleep,

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.501
then that probably means
we failed somewhere.

00:21:16.501 --> 00:21:17.701
Collins-Sussman:
Google has a long history

00:21:17.701 --> 00:21:19.968
of doing April Fool's jokes
as well.

00:21:19.968 --> 00:21:21.534
Which--Every year
it's something different.

00:21:21.534 --> 00:21:26.200
In 2008, every single link
on the YouTube front page

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:27.467
went to a Rick Roll.

00:21:27.467 --> 00:21:29.434
Okay, great. It's funny.
Right? One day.

00:21:29.434 --> 00:21:30.767
Fitzpatrick: But why
would you do that?

00:21:30.767 --> 00:21:33.267
You know, most people
don't even, like--

00:21:33.267 --> 00:21:35.601
It seems so impractical
and so whimsical.

00:21:35.601 --> 00:21:37.167
But people
remember that,

00:21:37.167 --> 00:21:39.267
and they're like, "Oh, God,
I remember; I was there."

00:21:39.267 --> 00:21:41.434
Collins-Sussman: I think another
great case is you can use humor

00:21:41.434 --> 00:21:43.934
to sort of encourage people
to do the right thing.

00:21:43.934 --> 00:21:45.267
There was
a social networking site

00:21:45.267 --> 00:21:47.567
that went up for a little while
where they really wanted

00:21:47.567 --> 00:21:49.434
people to upload photos,
and a lot of people

00:21:49.434 --> 00:21:50.634
won't do that
at first when they join

00:21:50.634 --> 00:21:51.801
a social networking site.

00:21:51.801 --> 00:21:53.267
So this site,
what they decided to do

00:21:53.267 --> 00:21:56.701
was put in a default image of
Dick Cheney to every new user.

00:21:56.701 --> 00:21:59.934
And, oh, my goodness, everybody
uploaded a new photo right away.

00:21:59.934 --> 00:22:03.634
Fitzpatrick: Over 90% of their
users uploaded a new photo.

00:22:03.634 --> 00:22:06.467
Collins-Sussman: Clearly
something humorous there, right?

00:22:06.467 --> 00:22:10.400
But that's just another way
of delighting the users.

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:13.901
So the third thing we want to
talk about is focusing on users.

00:22:13.901 --> 00:22:15.767
We talked about marketing
and customer service.

00:22:15.767 --> 00:22:17.634
What does it mean
to actually focus on them

00:22:17.634 --> 00:22:19.000
and have them affect
your everyday activities?

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.100
Fitzpatrick:
What do you think about

00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:21.567
when you hear
"focusing on users"?

00:22:21.567 --> 00:22:23.434
You usually think about
the orbiting brain lasers.

00:22:23.434 --> 00:22:24.901
Collins-Sussman:
No, no, not released. Next.

00:22:24.901 --> 00:22:27.467
Fitzpatrick: Oh, we don't
talk about prerelease. Sorry.

00:22:27.467 --> 00:22:28.667
Collins-Sussman:
[laughs]

00:22:28.667 --> 00:22:29.834
Usability.

00:22:29.834 --> 00:22:31.000
Fitzpatrick: It sort of
falls under usability.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.801
It falls under making
your software something

00:22:32.801 --> 00:22:36.501
that people can comprehend
and do great things with.

00:22:36.501 --> 00:22:38.801
If you just can't
try out your software,

00:22:38.801 --> 00:22:40.734
you don't have
any users, right?

00:22:40.734 --> 00:22:42.501
And like we said earlier,

00:22:42.501 --> 00:22:44.834
the first impressions are really
key to this sort of thing.

00:22:44.834 --> 00:22:46.400
Collins-Sussman:
And the barrier to entry.

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:48.067
Fitzpatrick:
The metaphor we like to use

00:22:48.067 --> 00:22:49.200
is one of a storefront.

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:50.501
Okay, if you're walking
down the street,

00:22:50.501 --> 00:22:52.067
you look in a store window,
and you see something--

00:22:52.067 --> 00:22:53.801
"Oh, hey, there's
a doodad I want to buy."

00:22:53.801 --> 00:22:55.400
You walk inside
and you inspect it.

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:57.267
Okay, that costs you
nothing but a few steps.

00:22:57.267 --> 00:22:58.567
If you walk up to the door
and they say,

00:22:58.567 --> 00:23:01.567
"Stop. We'd like you
to fill out this form.

00:23:01.567 --> 00:23:04.534
All this information
about yourself."

00:23:04.534 --> 00:23:06.400
You're gonna be like,
"Really? I just wanted to--

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:07.834
It's not that
important to me."

00:23:07.834 --> 00:23:09.133
And they're gonna go away
before they even had a chance...

00:23:09.133 --> 00:23:10.467
Collins-Sussman:
Read this documentation, right?

00:23:10.467 --> 00:23:11.834
Read this
license agreement.

00:23:11.834 --> 00:23:13.167
Fitzpatrick: Exactly.
Collins-Sussman: It's crazy.

00:23:13.167 --> 00:23:16.567
Back to the Emacs and vi,
which we mentioned before,

00:23:16.567 --> 00:23:18.868
when I first
was introduced to Unix,

00:23:18.868 --> 00:23:20.133
years and years ago,

00:23:20.133 --> 00:23:22.367
I remember saying,
"Which editor should I learn?

00:23:22.367 --> 00:23:24.300
Emacs or vi?" and everyone in
the room kind of laughed at me

00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:25.634
and said,
"Well, you figure it out.

00:23:25.634 --> 00:23:27.167
Which one you want.
We're not gonna tell you."

00:23:27.167 --> 00:23:28.601
So I started up vi,

00:23:28.601 --> 00:23:30.634
and I really didn't know
what to do,

00:23:30.634 --> 00:23:32.400
and I was typing things
and nothing was happening,

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:33.734
and I kind of got frustrated.

00:23:33.734 --> 00:23:35.834
And I started up Emacs,
and I just started typing.

00:23:35.834 --> 00:23:37.000
There were
characters appearing.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.234
"Oh, this is just like
a word processor."

00:23:39.234 --> 00:23:40.567
Fitzpatrick: How did you
figure out how to quit it?

00:23:40.567 --> 00:23:41.767
Collins-Sussman:
Well, that was--I couldn't qu--

00:23:41.767 --> 00:23:42.934
Fitzpatrick: I had
to unplug the computer

00:23:42.934 --> 00:23:44.901
to quit Emacs
the first time I tried.

00:23:44.901 --> 00:23:46.467
I'm like,
"You got to be kidding me."

00:23:46.467 --> 00:23:47.834
Collins-Sussman:
I couldn't quit vi either,

00:23:47.834 --> 00:23:49.467
but the point is,
at least, you know,

00:23:49.467 --> 00:23:51.000
in the first ten seconds

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.567
I just had an initial
impression of, like,

00:23:52.567 --> 00:23:54.100
"Oh, look, here's something
that's familiar to me.

00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:57.067
At least it's behaving
somewhat like what I expect."

00:23:57.067 --> 00:23:59.000
Now, maybe that's not
the perfect example,

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.901
but I think it's a nice anecdote
about first impressions.

00:24:01.901 --> 00:24:03.200
Fitzpatrick:
Well, there's a lot of examples.

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:04.734
I mean, Perl and PHP
I don't--

00:24:04.734 --> 00:24:06.734
They're not generally considered
really powerful things

00:24:06.734 --> 00:24:10.000
for writing Web apps or general
apps, but they're really easy.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.167
There's a really low barrier
to entry with these things.

00:24:13.167 --> 00:24:14.634
Or Fink, for example.

00:24:14.634 --> 00:24:17.200
If anybody uses Mac OS X,
there's this thing called Fink

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:19.367
that has all this
extra packages and stuff.

00:24:19.367 --> 00:24:22.133
In Tiger, they had this
really nice disk image.

00:24:22.133 --> 00:24:24.667
You just double-click it,
you install it, and it's done.

00:24:24.667 --> 00:24:27.133
As soon as Leopard came out,
they didn't have this ready,

00:24:27.133 --> 00:24:29.167
and so you had to download
things and build things

00:24:29.167 --> 00:24:30.334
and go through
all this crazy stuff.

00:24:30.334 --> 00:24:31.467
Collins-Sussman:
Everybody stopped using it.

00:24:31.467 --> 00:24:32.567
Fitzpatrick:
Well, people eventually started.

00:24:32.567 --> 00:24:33.667
Collins-Sussman:
Well, a lot of people did.

00:24:33.667 --> 00:24:35.033
Fitzpatrick: But it was
a higher barrier,

00:24:35.033 --> 00:24:36.267
and you're more
likely to say,

00:24:36.267 --> 00:24:38.133
"Oh, heck with it,
I can live without this stuff."

00:24:38.133 --> 00:24:40.200
Collins-Sussman: So one way
we like to think about usability

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:42.334
is we have this bell curve.

00:24:42.334 --> 00:24:43.968
On one end we have
Donald Knuth,

00:24:43.968 --> 00:24:45.868
on the other hand
we have Fitz's grandmother.

00:24:45.868 --> 00:24:46.901
Fitzpatrick:
Who I love dearly, really.

00:24:46.901 --> 00:24:48.200
Collins-Sussman:
We do love her.

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:49.901
I've never met her.

00:24:49.901 --> 00:24:52.901
So the question is
where does your software fall

00:24:52.901 --> 00:24:55.133
in terms of--we just want
to think about drawing a line.

00:24:55.133 --> 00:24:57.601
Every user
to the right of the line

00:24:57.601 --> 00:25:00.734
is able to use your software
with not much effort.

00:25:00.734 --> 00:25:04.033
So we can sort of talk about
various pieces of software.

00:25:04.033 --> 00:25:05.734
Fitzpatrick:
We're version control geeks,

00:25:05.734 --> 00:25:09.033
so we think Subversion
actually falls pretty easy.

00:25:09.033 --> 00:25:10.901
In the easy to use.

00:25:10.901 --> 00:25:12.200
So there's a lot of people

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:13.667
that it's accessible to,
quite frankly.

00:25:13.667 --> 00:25:15.100
Collins-Sussman:
Even people who've never

00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:16.267
used version control before

00:25:16.267 --> 00:25:18.300
find it not too hard
to get used to.

00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:22.067
Fitzpatrick: Right,
and another example is Git.

00:25:22.067 --> 00:25:23.901
Collins-Sussman:
[laughs]

00:25:23.901 --> 00:25:25.701
Fitzpatrick: It's technically
a great piece of software,

00:25:25.701 --> 00:25:27.100
but it's quite
hard to use.

00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:28.534
Collins-Sussman: And you can
do anything with it, right,

00:25:28.534 --> 00:25:31.434
but you have to be this tall
or this technically awesome

00:25:31.434 --> 00:25:34.133
to even, like, get past
that first day or two.

00:25:34.133 --> 00:25:36.601
I've heard people talk about
the first two weeks of using Git

00:25:36.601 --> 00:25:38.534
as being sort of
mind-numbingly hard,

00:25:38.534 --> 00:25:39.934
but I hear it's actually
getting better.

00:25:39.934 --> 00:25:41.767
That line's moving
to the left now.

00:25:41.767 --> 00:25:42.767
Fitzpatrick: So we're
big fans of Mercurial.

00:25:42.767 --> 00:25:43.934
Collins-Sussman:
We are.

00:25:43.934 --> 00:25:45.033
Fitzpatrick:
Which we think is actually--

00:25:45.033 --> 00:25:46.234
sort of finds
a nice middle ground

00:25:46.234 --> 00:25:48.334
for something
as powerful as that.

00:25:48.334 --> 00:25:50.901
Collins-Sussman: Incidentally,
Mercurial is now available

00:25:50.901 --> 00:25:52.968
on Google Code
Project Hosting,

00:25:52.968 --> 00:25:55.334
if you haven't seen
our blog posts about it.

00:25:55.334 --> 00:25:57.300
You can now use Mercurial
instead of Subversion

00:25:57.300 --> 00:25:59.267
if you're setting up
an open source project.

00:25:59.267 --> 00:26:02.701
So there's gonna be a talk
about that at 4:30 today.

00:26:02.701 --> 00:26:04.334
So side note.

00:26:04.334 --> 00:26:05.901
Fitzpatrick:
But the other thing to think--

00:26:05.901 --> 00:26:07.167
We're talking about
barrier to entry.

00:26:07.167 --> 00:26:09.501
We have a couple more
fun examples here.

00:26:09.501 --> 00:26:10.901
This is sort of
the standard,

00:26:10.901 --> 00:26:12.567
you know,
credit card application.

00:26:12.567 --> 00:26:14.367
This is a massive
pile of stuff.

00:26:14.367 --> 00:26:16.367
There's plenty of sites you've
been to that once you try out,

00:26:16.367 --> 00:26:18.033
you fill out all this stuff.

00:26:18.033 --> 00:26:20.267
Anyone in the room
ever use TripIt?

00:26:20.267 --> 00:26:22.467
Okay, TripIt
is really cool.

00:26:22.467 --> 00:26:24.300
Collins-Sussman: It's the best
user interface ever. Why?

00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:25.567
Fitzpatrick:
For signing up

00:26:25.567 --> 00:26:26.701
because you don't
have to do anything.

00:26:26.701 --> 00:26:27.701
Collins-Sussman:
There is no user interface.

00:26:27.701 --> 00:26:29.100
Fitzpatrick:
You just start--

00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:31.968
You can use the user interface,
but you just start emailing

00:26:31.968 --> 00:26:34.467
your trip to it,
all the information.

00:26:34.467 --> 00:26:36.367
Rental car,
your flight, et cetera.

00:26:36.367 --> 00:26:39.501
Collins-Sussman: You sign up
for a car and hotel and airplane

00:26:39.501 --> 00:26:42.434
on the regular Web sites, you
get these receipt emails back.

00:26:42.434 --> 00:26:44.601
"Thank you for registering
for your flight, thank you--"

00:26:44.601 --> 00:26:47.534
And you forward those emails
to this email address.

00:26:47.534 --> 00:26:48.868
That's it.

00:26:48.868 --> 00:26:50.667
Fitzpatrick: And then
it sends you back this nice...

00:26:50.667 --> 00:26:52.033
Collins-Sussman: Yeah, you go
back to the TripIt Web site,

00:26:52.033 --> 00:26:53.400
and it's parsed
all your emails

00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:55.467
and put them into
this beautiful itinerary.

00:26:55.467 --> 00:26:57.701
And everything's organized.
It's just fantastic.

00:26:57.701 --> 00:26:59.934
Fitzpatrick:
Super easy to use and try out.

00:26:59.934 --> 00:27:01.267
Collins-Sussman:
Absolutely.

00:27:01.267 --> 00:27:02.801
Fitzpatrick: And then people
wind up staying around.

00:27:02.801 --> 00:27:04.200
Collins-Sussman: One of
the things I want to talk about

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:06.000
is users versus usage.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.868
This is an interesting term.

00:27:07.868 --> 00:27:09.334
We talk about this
a lot at Google.

00:27:09.334 --> 00:27:11.934
We say, "I've got
50 million users."

00:27:11.934 --> 00:27:14.267
And we're like, "Okay, well,
what does that mean?"

00:27:14.267 --> 00:27:15.334
Are they actually
using it?

00:27:15.334 --> 00:27:17.334
Some companies
will say, you know--

00:27:17.334 --> 00:27:19.300
They'll say, "We had
50 million downloads,

00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:20.534
so we must have
50 million users."

00:27:20.534 --> 00:27:21.968
Well, wait a second,

00:27:21.968 --> 00:27:23.968
you don't know anyone's
actually using your software.

00:27:23.968 --> 00:27:25.367
So we talk about this
a lot at Google

00:27:25.367 --> 00:27:27.701
as a metric of success
and usability.

00:27:27.701 --> 00:27:30.501
We want to measure who is
actually using your software

00:27:30.501 --> 00:27:33.133
for how long.

00:27:33.133 --> 00:27:36.234
Fitzpatrick:
The example for that is--

00:27:36.234 --> 00:27:39.868
Who knows what ar is?
The ar utility in Unix?

00:27:39.868 --> 00:27:41.100
Collins-Sussman:
Anyone ever heard of ar?

00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:42.667
It's in bin.

00:27:42.667 --> 00:27:45.501
Fitzpatrick: It's bin ar.
It's the Unix archive utility.

00:27:45.501 --> 00:27:47.067
It's installed
on millions and millions

00:27:47.067 --> 00:27:48.734
and millions of computers,
but no one uses it.

00:27:48.734 --> 00:27:49.934
Collins-Sussman:
Well, I mean, it's probably

00:27:49.934 --> 00:27:51.868
on every Linux
and every Mac laptop out there.

00:27:51.868 --> 00:27:55.067
But nobody--It has zero
usability but millions of users.

00:27:55.067 --> 00:27:56.234
Fitzpatrick:
So who cares?

00:27:56.234 --> 00:27:57.601
Collins-Sussman:
Zero usage.

00:27:57.601 --> 00:27:59.033
Fitzpatrick: Right, right.
Collins-Sussman: Absolutely.

00:27:59.033 --> 00:28:01.334
Fitzpatrick: So the next part of
focusing on users is sort of--

00:28:01.334 --> 00:28:02.767
We're talking
about laziness, okay?

00:28:02.767 --> 00:28:07.133
Now, I personally admit
I am incredibly lazy.

00:28:07.133 --> 00:28:09.901
I would much rather write
an application than write code.

00:28:09.901 --> 00:28:12.834
So the least amount of code
that I need to debug, maintain,

00:28:12.834 --> 00:28:14.300
remember what the heck--
a document,

00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:16.534
remember what it was about,
the better.

00:28:16.534 --> 00:28:18.200
But when it comes to designing
your interface and stuff,

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:19.868
you really have
to spend more time

00:28:19.868 --> 00:28:22.133
so that your users
can spend less time.

00:28:22.133 --> 00:28:23.634
This is lazy.
Collins-Sussman: [laughs]

00:28:23.634 --> 00:28:24.634
[audience oohs]

00:28:24.634 --> 00:28:25.801
Your favorite
application.

00:28:25.801 --> 00:28:27.267
Fitzpatrick:
Your favorite application.

00:28:27.267 --> 00:28:31.000
This is lazy.
Collins-Sussman: Oh, yeah.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.767
Fitzpatrick: Now I understand
this came back from the days

00:28:32.767 --> 00:28:34.334
when, you know,
people didn't spend time

00:28:34.334 --> 00:28:36.234
designing any sort of
a command line interface,

00:28:36.234 --> 00:28:40.167
but, you know, I can't remember
a darn thing about tar

00:28:40.167 --> 00:28:43.100
other than cfv and xfv,
I mean, that's about it.

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:44.567
Collins-Sussman:
Becomes a reflex.

00:28:44.567 --> 00:28:46.100
Who knows what
the other stuff does?

00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:47.601
Fitzpatrick:
You know, the--et cetera.

00:28:47.601 --> 00:28:49.434
Mail a copy
to Martha Stewart,

00:28:49.434 --> 00:28:50.634
whatever,
there's that command.

00:28:50.634 --> 00:28:52.434
Collins-Sussman:
Oh, I hate this.

00:28:52.434 --> 00:28:53.901
This is one of those things.
You know about the--

00:28:53.901 --> 00:28:55.434
Fitzpatrick: This is
a huge pet peeve of mine.

00:28:55.434 --> 00:28:58.067
Collins-Sussman: Where you go
to a Web site, and you're like--

00:28:58.067 --> 00:29:00.033
Because, you know,
it's so, so hard

00:29:00.033 --> 00:29:01.634
to parse out
spaces and dashes,

00:29:01.634 --> 00:29:03.534
we wouldn't want
to stress our programmers out.

00:29:03.534 --> 00:29:06.267
Let's make the users
do it instead. Great idea.

00:29:06.267 --> 00:29:07.367
Fitzpatrick: Right,
or even then you get the one

00:29:07.367 --> 00:29:08.934
where you have to enter
your phone number.

00:29:08.934 --> 00:29:10.601
You type the first few letters
it automatically advances you

00:29:10.601 --> 00:29:13.234
to the next one, and you've hit
Tab and go on to the next field.

00:29:13.234 --> 00:29:14.400
Collins-Sussman:
Yeah. Great.

00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:15.834
Fitzpatrick:
You make your users feel dumb,

00:29:15.834 --> 00:29:18.467
and when people feel dumb they
hate you, and then they go away.

00:29:18.467 --> 00:29:20.033
Collins-Sussman:
[sighs]

00:29:20.033 --> 00:29:22.534
Fitzpatrick: But beyond
just the usability stuff...

00:29:22.534 --> 00:29:24.334
Collins-Sussman:
Speed.

00:29:24.334 --> 00:29:25.667
Fitzpatrick:
Speed is really important.

00:29:25.667 --> 00:29:27.434
Collins-Sussman:
It's a huge impact on usability.

00:29:27.434 --> 00:29:29.467
In fact it's one of those
things that actually--

00:29:29.467 --> 00:29:32.200
it affects usability
in this sort of weird,

00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:34.167
unconscious kind of way.

00:29:34.167 --> 00:29:36.300
You may not realize
how fast or slow

00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:37.467
something is consciously,

00:29:37.467 --> 00:29:39.133
but it actually
affects your mood,

00:29:39.133 --> 00:29:42.000
and it affects how you feel
about a piece of software.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.334
You know, if you've used--

00:29:43.334 --> 00:29:44.968
Especially on mobile phone
apps as an example,

00:29:44.968 --> 00:29:47.667
certain applications will be
super quick and responsive,

00:29:47.667 --> 00:29:49.000
others you'll click
a button

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.300
and you'll sort of
wonder what's going on.

00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:52.133
You may not register
in your mind

00:29:52.133 --> 00:29:53.334
that "I'm frustrated
with it,"

00:29:53.334 --> 00:29:55.067
but it does actually
change your mood.

00:29:55.067 --> 00:29:56.667
Fitzpatrick:
And change your likelihood

00:29:56.667 --> 00:29:58.534
to use something
off the cuff.

00:29:58.534 --> 00:30:00.467
So here's another graph that
we spent minutes researching.

00:30:00.467 --> 00:30:01.801
Collins-Sussman:
Minutes.

00:30:01.801 --> 00:30:04.400
Fitzpatrick: As time goes on,
and you get more users,

00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:05.734
sometimes people notice

00:30:05.734 --> 00:30:09.067
that the number of users
they have plateau.

00:30:09.067 --> 00:30:10.234
And the marketing guys decide

00:30:10.234 --> 00:30:11.801
at this point
we need more sizzle.

00:30:11.801 --> 00:30:13.000
Collins-Sussman:
Clearly that's the problem.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.000
Fitzpatrick:
That's the solution.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.234
It's a way to solve this.

00:30:15.234 --> 00:30:16.801
But what it also turns out

00:30:16.801 --> 00:30:18.534
is if you look
a little more carefully,

00:30:18.534 --> 00:30:21.167
because your users have grown,
your application's slower,

00:30:21.167 --> 00:30:22.367
you've maybe got some
bad algorithms in there.

00:30:22.367 --> 00:30:23.601
Collins-Sussman:
You're not scaling.

00:30:23.601 --> 00:30:24.701
Fitzpatrick:
You're not scaling very well.

00:30:24.701 --> 00:30:26.033
Your latency gets to
a point

00:30:26.033 --> 00:30:28.801
where your existing users
use your application less,

00:30:28.801 --> 00:30:30.267
and your new users either

00:30:30.267 --> 00:30:32.767
come and go,
which is very little,

00:30:32.767 --> 00:30:34.133
and of course
this all means

00:30:34.133 --> 00:30:35.734
that despair increases
exponentially.

00:30:35.734 --> 00:30:36.734
Collins-Sussman:
Very carefully measured.

00:30:36.734 --> 00:30:38.200
Fitzpatrick:
Carefully measured.

00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:40.267
So here's an example to give you
a little actual data here

00:30:40.267 --> 00:30:41.634
with some math behind it,

00:30:41.634 --> 00:30:43.334
which is that if you have
a million users,

00:30:43.334 --> 00:30:45.033
which I think
would be great.

00:30:45.033 --> 00:30:47.000
I don't think anybody here
wouldn't want a million users.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.801
Each one of them does
20 requests a day to your app.

00:30:49.801 --> 00:30:53.067
Of course we're talking about
some sort of network app here.

00:30:53.067 --> 00:30:56.934
Each response
is 500 milliseconds too long.

00:30:56.934 --> 00:30:59.100
Over the course
of an entire year,

00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:02.434
you've wasted 116 years
of peoples' time.

00:31:02.434 --> 00:31:03.501
Collins-Sussman:
Holy smokes.

00:31:03.501 --> 00:31:05.767
Please stop
killing your users.

00:31:05.767 --> 00:31:07.300
Fitzpatrick: So it just
is sort of a plea

00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:09.767
to not kill your users.

00:31:09.767 --> 00:31:12.133
So beyond latency, I'll talk
a little bit about complexity,

00:31:12.133 --> 00:31:13.634
which we've
touched on earlier.

00:31:13.634 --> 00:31:15.300
Collins-Sussman:
Yeah, complexity is not

00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:16.601
necessarily an evil thing.

00:31:16.601 --> 00:31:18.968
Some problems
really are complex.

00:31:18.968 --> 00:31:21.801
But the thing you should be
striving for is to sort of--

00:31:21.801 --> 00:31:25.167
There is an art to dealing
with complex problems

00:31:25.167 --> 00:31:31.000
and yet taking that complexity
and still making it accessible,

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.167
but not just dumping it
in the user's face.

00:31:33.167 --> 00:31:34.334
Fitzpatrick:
Right, and you don't have to

00:31:34.334 --> 00:31:35.667
dump it in the user's face,

00:31:35.667 --> 00:31:36.901
and you don't have
to dumb it down so that,

00:31:36.901 --> 00:31:39.334
you know,
anybody can "use it,"

00:31:39.334 --> 00:31:42.367
you make things very weak
and not very powerful.

00:31:42.367 --> 00:31:43.934
Collins-Sussman:
We have a nice counterexample.

00:31:43.934 --> 00:31:46.834
Has anyone ever
used Eudora email program?

00:31:46.834 --> 00:31:48.000
Or maybe ten years ago?

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.501
Fitzpatrick:
I used to use Eudora, sure.

00:31:49.501 --> 00:31:52.434
Okay, we've got
a couple of screenshots

00:31:52.434 --> 00:31:53.501
of Eudora's preference panel.

00:31:53.501 --> 00:31:55.000
Collins-Sussman:
Big.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.901
Fitzpatrick: And I'm gonna count
through them really quickly.

00:31:56.901 --> 00:31:58.000
Okay?

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:03.868
We have 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,

00:32:03.868 --> 00:32:08.167
11, 12, 13, 14,
15, 16, 17, 18--

00:32:08.167 --> 00:32:09.300
Collins-Sussman:
What is that?

00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:10.501
Fitzpatrick:
What is a "mood watch"?

00:32:10.501 --> 00:32:11.834
Collins-Sussman: [laughs]
[audience laughs]

00:32:11.834 --> 00:32:14.734
Fitzpatrick: Why do I need
a panel for a mood watch?

00:32:14.734 --> 00:32:15.834
Okay, but there's more.

00:32:15.834 --> 00:32:21.067
19, 20, 21, 22,
23, 24, 25, 26, 27.

00:32:21.067 --> 00:32:26.267
27 separate panels
to configure a mail client.

00:32:26.267 --> 00:32:28.968
Collins-Sussman: Hmm. Email is
a complex problem, right?

00:32:28.968 --> 00:32:30.667
But you don't really
need to throw that

00:32:30.667 --> 00:32:32.167
all in the user's
face like that.

00:32:32.167 --> 00:32:34.234
It's absolutely insane.

00:32:34.234 --> 00:32:36.934
What's a good example
of hiding complexity?

00:32:36.934 --> 00:32:39.234
I think probably everybody has
one of these in their pocket.

00:32:39.234 --> 00:32:41.868
Wow, is this a dated
picture now? It probably is.

00:32:41.868 --> 00:32:46.634
But think about how hard it is
just designing an mp3 player.

00:32:46.634 --> 00:32:47.801
Before the iPod came out,

00:32:47.801 --> 00:32:49.400
there were a lot
of different models out there,

00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:51.133
and they all had
millions of little buttons

00:32:51.133 --> 00:32:52.734
and weird,
little fonts on there.

00:32:52.734 --> 00:32:56.667
It was kind of hard to use,
and I think what Apple did--

00:32:56.667 --> 00:32:58.067
the brilliant thing--
I mean, it's--

00:32:58.067 --> 00:32:59.634
Clearly there's
a lot of electronics.

00:32:59.634 --> 00:33:00.634
There's a lot
of complexity going on

00:33:00.634 --> 00:33:01.767
just in terms
of hardware.

00:33:01.767 --> 00:33:03.868
But the thing they did
was they took

00:33:03.868 --> 00:33:07.067
this very difficult problem
of managing your music,

00:33:07.067 --> 00:33:09.133
and they took it
off of this device,

00:33:09.133 --> 00:33:10.767
and they put it
onto a real computer.

00:33:10.767 --> 00:33:12.434
Fitzpatrick: With a keyboard.
With an actual keyboard.

00:33:12.434 --> 00:33:14.133
Collins-Sussman: And they wrote
this beautiful piece of software

00:33:14.133 --> 00:33:15.767
to organize it and manage it.

00:33:15.767 --> 00:33:18.634
And then all that complexity
has shifted off to the computer,

00:33:18.634 --> 00:33:20.434
where it's doable,

00:33:20.434 --> 00:33:23.067
and then the device itself
becomes incredibly simple.

00:33:23.067 --> 00:33:24.400
It just becomes
a very simple mirror

00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:26.200
for playing back
all the complexity

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:28.000
that you've already
organized somewhere else.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.901
Fitzpatrick: And this is still a
very complex piece of software.

00:33:29.901 --> 00:33:31.467
It treats
your music as data.

00:33:31.467 --> 00:33:33.601
You can rate things,
you can do genres,

00:33:33.601 --> 00:33:35.167
you can do smart playlists,
all this stuff.

00:33:35.167 --> 00:33:36.868
It's really quite
impressive.

00:33:36.868 --> 00:33:40.067
Another example of something
that's incredibly complex

00:33:40.067 --> 00:33:42.467
is Google Search.

00:33:42.467 --> 00:33:43.968
If you really want
to strip this down,

00:33:43.968 --> 00:33:46.567
it's basically a text box and
a couple of buttons and a logo.

00:33:46.567 --> 00:33:48.133
Collins-Sussman:
You don't really need the logo.

00:33:48.133 --> 00:33:50.734
Fitzpatrick: You don't even need
the "I'm Feeling Lucky" button.

00:33:50.734 --> 00:33:52.133
Or the logo.

00:33:52.133 --> 00:33:53.334
In fact, you can
just hit Return

00:33:53.334 --> 00:33:54.634
and get rid
of the button entirely.

00:33:54.634 --> 00:33:56.100
Collins-Sussman:
[laughs]

00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:59.300
Fitzpatrick: That is a window
into a massive amount of data.

00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:01.467
And it's not
just dumbed down.

00:34:01.467 --> 00:34:02.868
You can still use
some very powerful

00:34:02.868 --> 00:34:04.534
search operators
on there if you want.

00:34:04.534 --> 00:34:05.667
Collins-Sussman:
If you're a power user

00:34:05.667 --> 00:34:07.567
you can go learn
all the fancy syntax.

00:34:07.567 --> 00:34:09.334
Fitzpatrick: Right, but it's
an illusion of simplicity.

00:34:09.334 --> 00:34:11.567
Just typing whatever
into that box 90% of the time

00:34:11.567 --> 00:34:13.400
gets you where
you want to go.

00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:17.501
And this is sort of what it
looks like behind the scenes.

00:34:17.501 --> 00:34:18.667
Collins-Sussman:
Piles of computers.

00:34:18.667 --> 00:34:20.567
Fitzpatrick: But beyond that
we want to talk

00:34:20.567 --> 00:34:23.133
about another way
of hiding this complexity.

00:34:23.133 --> 00:34:25.334
Is abstractions.

00:34:25.334 --> 00:34:27.334
Abstracting out
some of this complexity

00:34:27.334 --> 00:34:31.200
is a way for you
to sort of hide, I guess,

00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:33.033
some of the complexity
while still giving users

00:34:33.033 --> 00:34:34.734
the opportunity
to do things.

00:34:34.734 --> 00:34:36.367
The real problem with this

00:34:36.367 --> 00:34:39.667
is that all abstractions
are leaking.

00:34:39.667 --> 00:34:41.968
Especially if you use the Web,
you see this every day.

00:34:41.968 --> 00:34:43.634
You hit a 404,
you're in a Web browser.

00:34:43.634 --> 00:34:44.801
What happened?
Where am I?

00:34:44.801 --> 00:34:46.133
Your plug-in isn't found.

00:34:46.133 --> 00:34:47.367
Collins-Sussman:
Yeah, I mean, think about it.

00:34:47.367 --> 00:34:49.968
Even the most non-technical
users, they see 404.

00:34:49.968 --> 00:34:52.067
It's become part of
sort of everyday speak

00:34:52.067 --> 00:34:53.234
even though people
don't know

00:34:53.234 --> 00:34:54.834
where that comes from
or what that means.

00:34:54.834 --> 00:34:58.133
That's an abstraction
leaking out to the user.

00:34:58.133 --> 00:34:59.667
Which is not necessarily
a bad thing.

00:34:59.667 --> 00:35:01.200
Fitzpatrick: No.

00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:03.000
Collins-Sussman: I guess what
we're trying to advocate here

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.367
is that you don't need

00:35:04.367 --> 00:35:07.000
to try and prevent all
abstractions from leaking,

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:10.100
instead you should go
and say, well, that's fine,

00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:14.334
let's actually create a layer
that people can build on.

00:35:14.334 --> 00:35:16.067
Like an API layer,

00:35:16.067 --> 00:35:17.901
or some way so people could
get under the abstraction

00:35:17.901 --> 00:35:19.968
and really do what they want to
if you're a powerful--

00:35:19.968 --> 00:35:21.300
if you're a programmer.

00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:24.834
Fitzpatrick: Right,
and so an example of that--

00:35:24.834 --> 00:35:27.067
the Apache Web Server,
years ago,

00:35:27.067 --> 00:35:29.667
decided that people
in some cases needed to do

00:35:29.667 --> 00:35:31.801
more than just configure things
through a little text file.

00:35:31.801 --> 00:35:33.934
So they had
a module interface

00:35:33.934 --> 00:35:35.601
where you could hook
into the request response

00:35:35.601 --> 00:35:38.334
in any one of a bajillion
different places.

00:35:38.334 --> 00:35:40.801
But this gave people like
you guys, like the engineers,

00:35:40.801 --> 00:35:43.167
the ability to really
do a lot with it.

00:35:43.167 --> 00:35:44.467
And, you know,
Google knows this too.

00:35:44.467 --> 00:35:45.901
Collins-Sussman:
Google Calendar, right?

00:35:45.901 --> 00:35:47.067
I mean, everyone uses--

00:35:47.067 --> 00:35:48.634
well, lots and lots
of non-technical users

00:35:48.634 --> 00:35:50.300
using Google Calendar,
love it.

00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:51.934
Given me all sorts
of testimonials of my friends

00:35:51.934 --> 00:35:53.234
about how it's
changed their life.

00:35:53.234 --> 00:35:55.200
And yet there's
a great API for it too.

00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:56.501
You can mix it,
and match it, and embed it,

00:35:56.501 --> 00:35:57.601
and all sorts of things.

00:35:57.601 --> 00:35:58.801
Fitzpatrick:
And we could go on and on.

00:35:58.801 --> 00:36:00.868
I mean, this whole conference
is about that.

00:36:00.868 --> 00:36:02.467
This whole conference
is about the fact

00:36:02.467 --> 00:36:04.968
that there's these APIs
to all our different products.

00:36:04.968 --> 00:36:07.234
I mean, Lars this morning
in the keynote--

00:36:07.234 --> 00:36:08.968
Did you guys go
to the keynote this morning?

00:36:08.968 --> 00:36:10.934
You guys like Wave?
Does that look pretty cool?

00:36:10.934 --> 00:36:12.367
Collins-Sussman: Yeah.
Fitzpatrick: Yeah?

00:36:12.367 --> 00:36:13.634
Collins-Sussman:
[laughs]

00:36:13.634 --> 00:36:15.133
Jury's out.

00:36:15.133 --> 00:36:17.334
Fitzpatrick: They're all clapped
out from this morning, I think.

00:36:17.334 --> 00:36:21.267
But they realize that it's being
able to hack into things

00:36:21.267 --> 00:36:24.534
like maps and whatnot, and
access it through strong APIs

00:36:24.534 --> 00:36:27.167
are what makes it
really great, I think.

00:36:27.167 --> 00:36:29.834
So we have a couple
of stories to end up here?

00:36:29.834 --> 00:36:32.767
Collins-Sussman:
Well, yeah. [laughs]

00:36:32.767 --> 00:36:38.200
Um, I think this is your story,
but I mean actually we get--

00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:40.267
I've had other people
tell me this as well.

00:36:40.267 --> 00:36:41.767
Is that, all right,
Google's corporation's got

00:36:41.767 --> 00:36:42.934
a lot of people,
but a lot of people

00:36:42.934 --> 00:36:44.334
don't actually
realize that.

00:36:44.334 --> 00:36:47.634
There's a lot of people
out there who really--

00:36:47.634 --> 00:36:49.934
they just think Google's
part of their computer,

00:36:49.934 --> 00:36:51.901
or they think it's part
of their Web browser,

00:36:51.901 --> 00:36:53.934
and I've actually
met people who I'll say,

00:36:53.934 --> 00:36:55.501
"Oh, I work for Google,"

00:36:55.501 --> 00:36:58.167
and they're like, "Oh, I didn't
know anybody worked there."

00:36:58.167 --> 00:36:59.200
Fitzpatrick:
Exactly, yeah.

00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:00.467
My mother-in-law
introduced me

00:37:00.467 --> 00:37:01.968
to some 82-year-old
friend of hers, and she said,

00:37:01.968 --> 00:37:03.701
"This is my son-in-law,
he works for Google,"

00:37:03.701 --> 00:37:06.033
and she looks at her and looks
at me like what am I doing here?

00:37:06.033 --> 00:37:08.234
She said, "I didn't know anybody
worked at the Google."

00:37:08.234 --> 00:37:09.567
Collins-Sussman: Well, we've had
the opposite, right?

00:37:09.567 --> 00:37:10.934
Fitzpatrick:
Right, well--

00:37:10.934 --> 00:37:12.167
Collins-Sussman: This is
my favorite so you tell this.

00:37:12.167 --> 00:37:14.167
Fitzpatrick: One of
our other friends out here

00:37:14.167 --> 00:37:16.501
told his aunt
that, you know,

00:37:16.501 --> 00:37:18.133
everyone was going to Disneyland
a couple years ago.

00:37:18.133 --> 00:37:19.300
Collins-Sussman:
All the Google employees.

00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:20.567
Fitzpatrick:
All the Google employees were

00:37:20.567 --> 00:37:22.601
taking a couple days and we were
gonna go to Disneyland.

00:37:22.601 --> 00:37:24.834
And his aunt said,
"Well, you can't do that."

00:37:24.834 --> 00:37:27.000
He's like, "What do you mean
I can't do that?"

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.133
She's like, "Well, who's gonna
do my searches for me?"

00:37:29.133 --> 00:37:30.567
Collins-Sussman:
[laughs]

00:37:30.567 --> 00:37:32.334
I sort of imagine, like,
you know, switchboard operators.

00:37:32.334 --> 00:37:33.701
Fitzpatrick: Right.

00:37:33.701 --> 00:37:35.467
Somebody with the Yellow Pages
looking things up.

00:37:35.467 --> 00:37:38.067
But I mean, again this is
the way people perceive things,

00:37:38.067 --> 00:37:40.400
and the point of that
is just to think about the fact

00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:43.467
that the way that
you perceive your software

00:37:43.467 --> 00:37:45.801
from the inside looking out
is very different

00:37:45.801 --> 00:37:48.901
than people who aren't as
technical, who aren't engineers,

00:37:48.901 --> 00:37:50.334
perceive your software.

00:37:50.334 --> 00:37:51.334
Collins-Sussman:
So it's really--

00:37:51.334 --> 00:37:53.701
it's not just
about the code.

00:37:53.701 --> 00:37:55.434
I mean, yes, we all have an
inherent distrust of marketing,

00:37:55.434 --> 00:37:57.434
and spin,
and interacting with users.

00:37:57.434 --> 00:38:00.267
It's something that sort of
scares us as programmers.

00:38:00.267 --> 00:38:01.767
But there's actually--
there is--

00:38:01.767 --> 00:38:04.701
You are able to have
a healthy relationship

00:38:04.701 --> 00:38:07.601
with these facts,
with these people on your team,

00:38:07.601 --> 00:38:09.734
you just need to find
that nice balance

00:38:09.734 --> 00:38:13.334
where you are promising
the right amount of thing,

00:38:13.334 --> 00:38:15.000
they are promising
the right amount of thing,

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:18.234
they're adding the appropriate
amount of sizzle to your steak,

00:38:18.234 --> 00:38:20.033
and you end up with something
that's really, really usable.

00:38:20.033 --> 00:38:22.601
Fitzpatrick: And you're
listening to your users as well.

00:38:22.601 --> 00:38:24.033
And that's all we have
to say about that.

00:38:24.033 --> 00:38:26.267
Thanks for coming.

00:38:26.267 --> 00:38:29.200
[applause]

00:38:31.167 --> 00:38:32.868
We do have a little time
for Q &amp; A.

00:38:32.868 --> 00:38:34.801
If you have any questions

00:38:34.801 --> 00:38:36.267
come up to the mic
and ask them, please.

00:38:36.267 --> 00:38:37.534
If you have any answers,

00:38:37.534 --> 00:38:41.801
definitely come up to the mic
and give us them.

00:38:41.801 --> 00:38:44.200
Collins-Sussman: Great.
Fitzpatrick: That's it? Anyone?

00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:48.901
Oh, somebody's running up.
Collins-Sussman: Somebody.

00:38:48.901 --> 00:38:50.200
audience member: Hi.

00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:54.234
Are there any standards
that Google uses for processes

00:38:54.234 --> 00:38:59.234
to kind of--to, I guess,
review products,

00:38:59.234 --> 00:39:00.334
how they're being used?

00:39:00.334 --> 00:39:02.334
Are there, like,
five steps

00:39:02.334 --> 00:39:04.701
or something like that
that they go through?

00:39:04.701 --> 00:39:05.834
Collins-Sussman:
I'm not sure I--

00:39:05.834 --> 00:39:06.868
If there are any processes

00:39:06.868 --> 00:39:08.701
to review how products
are being used?

00:39:08.701 --> 00:39:10.868
Oh, you mean like
how do we evaluate usability?

00:39:10.868 --> 00:39:11.901
audience member:
Yeah.

00:39:11.901 --> 00:39:13.067
Fitzpatrick:
Like user experience?

00:39:13.067 --> 00:39:14.634
Like research and stuff
like that? User testing?

00:39:14.634 --> 00:39:17.334
We do tons of that.
Absolute tons of that.

00:39:17.334 --> 00:39:19.367
I mean, everything you--

00:39:19.367 --> 00:39:20.834
Sometimes if you're
doing a Google search,

00:39:20.834 --> 00:39:22.601
you'll see results come up
differently, for example,

00:39:22.601 --> 00:39:23.601
it looks a little different.

00:39:23.601 --> 00:39:24.601
Collins-Sussman:
Once in a blue moon.

00:39:24.601 --> 00:39:25.601
Fitzpatrick:
Once in a blue moon.

00:39:25.601 --> 00:39:26.701
That means that, you know,

00:39:26.701 --> 00:39:28.100
you just saw a test
that we tried out.

00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:29.501
Try and see if people
behave differently

00:39:29.501 --> 00:39:30.601
and how they behave.

00:39:30.601 --> 00:39:32.501
So we definitely do
a lot of that.

00:39:32.501 --> 00:39:34.834
Collins-Sussman:
We'll do experiments on people.

00:39:34.834 --> 00:39:36.200
See how they change behavior.

00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:38.167
That's an unwilling experiment
in that case.

00:39:38.167 --> 00:39:40.767
You might be a subject
of experiment without realizing.

00:39:40.767 --> 00:39:42.601
But we also do
deliberate experiments too,

00:39:42.601 --> 00:39:44.901
where we actually will have

00:39:44.901 --> 00:39:46.868
user discussion groups,
user focus groups,

00:39:46.868 --> 00:39:49.434
or somebody will volunteer
to use a product

00:39:49.434 --> 00:39:50.667
and we'll watch them
use the product

00:39:50.667 --> 00:39:52.167
and study what they're doing,

00:39:52.167 --> 00:39:55.400
and it's classic
user experience stuff.

00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:59.234
Fitzpatrick: Thank you.
Next question.

00:39:59.234 --> 00:40:01.400
audience member:
Uh, are people who--

00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:03.267
or kids who are grown up

00:40:03.267 --> 00:40:07.300
with phones and computers
from very young ages--

00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:09.701
How is this gonna change

00:40:09.701 --> 00:40:13.300
the way users see
and use software,

00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:16.634
and how is this gonna
change

00:40:16.634 --> 00:40:18.434
over the next 20
or 30 years

00:40:18.434 --> 00:40:23.000
as everyone starts to know how
to use a computer from--

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.567
they're two years old
or whatever?

00:40:25.567 --> 00:40:28.868
Fitzpatrick:
Well, I think the bell curve--

00:40:28.868 --> 00:40:32.334
The competency level is just
gonna continue shifting

00:40:32.334 --> 00:40:34.968
as more people
are used to having

00:40:34.968 --> 00:40:36.300
these sort of technical devices
around,

00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:37.467
and that sort of thing.

00:40:37.467 --> 00:40:38.467
Collins-Sussman:
I guess I don't feel like

00:40:38.467 --> 00:40:39.968
it's a big paradigm shift.

00:40:39.968 --> 00:40:41.734
I mean, when I was a kid

00:40:41.734 --> 00:40:43.801
there were hardly
any computers at all.

00:40:43.801 --> 00:40:46.167
But yet, you know,
everyone in my generation,

00:40:46.167 --> 00:40:48.000
my parents' generation, grew up
with other forms of technology

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.033
that they did not
understand.

00:40:50.033 --> 00:40:52.167
How many people understand
their television sets,

00:40:52.167 --> 00:40:54.868
or the electricity or the
heating system in their house?

00:40:54.868 --> 00:40:56.033
I mean, none of us can go

00:40:56.033 --> 00:40:58.267
be dropped in a field
and survive anymore.

00:40:58.267 --> 00:40:59.767
We've all lost
that ability to some degree.

00:40:59.767 --> 00:41:02.000
We're all dependent
on technology to some degree.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.200
So to me, computers
and cell phones just feel like

00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:06.767
just yet another
piece of magic in our lives,

00:41:06.767 --> 00:41:09.534
just like everything else that
we use to sustain ourselves.

00:41:09.534 --> 00:41:12.133
Just one more thing.

00:41:12.133 --> 00:41:14.167
Fitzpatrick: I agree
and I disagree a little bit.

00:41:14.167 --> 00:41:15.501
I mean,
I agree that people

00:41:15.501 --> 00:41:17.367
don't understand
the internals of something,

00:41:17.367 --> 00:41:20.434
but I think they're
gonna be much more capable

00:41:20.434 --> 00:41:22.400
of dealing with more complex
technological things.

00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:23.734
I think we see that as--

00:41:23.734 --> 00:41:24.734
And I think that's more
of what your question was,

00:41:24.734 --> 00:41:25.734
if I understood.

00:41:25.734 --> 00:41:26.934
Collins-Sussman:
And more OCD.

00:41:26.934 --> 00:41:28.334
Fitzpatrick:
Yeah, and a little more OCD.

00:41:28.334 --> 00:41:29.801
And you're gonna see people
talking to each other less

00:41:29.801 --> 00:41:33.133
and just texting each other
more, something to that effect.

00:41:33.133 --> 00:41:34.868
The social implications
are interesting, I think.

00:41:34.868 --> 00:41:36.901
It brings people together,
to some extent,

00:41:36.901 --> 00:41:38.534
and maybe brings them apart,
we don't know.

00:41:38.534 --> 00:41:40.601
Yes.

00:41:40.601 --> 00:41:42.434
audience member: Yes, I wonder
how both of you think

00:41:42.434 --> 00:41:46.033
about designing software for
the way users currently think

00:41:46.033 --> 00:41:49.234
versus taking them into
a new model of doing things.

00:41:49.234 --> 00:41:51.901
And one example
that jumps to mind was Gmail.

00:41:51.901 --> 00:41:53.767
How there was
no Delete button at first,

00:41:53.767 --> 00:41:55.934
and we're trying to push them
towards a totally new model

00:41:55.934 --> 00:42:00.033
and then eventually caving
and adding the Delete button.

00:42:00.033 --> 00:42:03.167
Fitzpatrick: I personally agree
with the Delete button.

00:42:03.167 --> 00:42:05.434
Even though I rarely use it,
it's nice to know--

00:42:05.434 --> 00:42:06.767
It's like
an emergency exit, you know.

00:42:06.767 --> 00:42:07.934
I don't want
to have to use it,

00:42:07.934 --> 00:42:09.467
but it's nice
to know it's there.

00:42:09.467 --> 00:42:10.901
Collins-Sussman: I think there's
a tightrope you need to walk.

00:42:10.901 --> 00:42:13.234
I mean, if you have
a new, radical way

00:42:13.234 --> 00:42:15.300
of working with software,

00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:16.734
I don't think it will
get a lot of uptake

00:42:16.734 --> 00:42:18.868
if it's completely alien.

00:42:18.868 --> 00:42:20.567
I think you need
to find some balance

00:42:20.567 --> 00:42:23.334
between somewhat familiar,
and then users are willing

00:42:23.334 --> 00:42:25.000
to tolerate a little bit
of the unfamiliar

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:28.467
if they see an obvious gain
in productivity or something.

00:42:28.467 --> 00:42:30.868
And I think Gmail
is an example of that.

00:42:30.868 --> 00:42:32.267
It's like, okay,
it's a familiar.

00:42:32.267 --> 00:42:34.000
I've used email before.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.100
But a lot of friends of mine
who started using Gmail

00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:38.601
weren't used to seeing
conversations grouped together,

00:42:38.601 --> 00:42:40.334
and that was
a little bit of a shock,

00:42:40.334 --> 00:42:43.801
but it was not so much
that they ran away screaming.

00:42:43.801 --> 00:42:45.334
And now, you know,
months later,

00:42:45.334 --> 00:42:46.834
I can't remember
living without it.

00:42:46.834 --> 00:42:49.033
Fitzpatrick: Right.
But there's huge advantages.

00:42:49.033 --> 00:42:51.601
I mean, you still have to offer
a net gain to your users

00:42:51.601 --> 00:42:53.133
if you're gonna have
something new like that.

00:42:53.133 --> 00:42:56.234
Gmail's first offer
was a gigabyte of storage space,

00:42:56.234 --> 00:42:58.601
which was two orders
of magnitude

00:42:58.601 --> 00:43:00.367
more than anybody
got at the time.

00:43:00.367 --> 00:43:02.734
And people really thought
it was an April Fool's joke

00:43:02.734 --> 00:43:03.968
five years ago
when they announced that.

00:43:03.968 --> 00:43:04.968
'Cause it was--I did.

00:43:04.968 --> 00:43:06.133
Collins-Sussman:
Announced on April 1st.

00:43:06.133 --> 00:43:07.467
Fitzpatrick: I was like,
come on. This is crazy.

00:43:07.467 --> 00:43:09.734
Who could do that?

00:43:09.734 --> 00:43:11.701
audience member: So I work
at GrayShark.com, right,

00:43:11.701 --> 00:43:14.834
and we have
a very healthy rivalry

00:43:14.834 --> 00:43:17.000
between everybody
in engineering that thinks

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.567
that we should test
8,000 shades of gray,

00:43:19.567 --> 00:43:22.601
and our designers that say,
"Hey, this is the right one."

00:43:22.601 --> 00:43:24.501
Everybody in engineering
points to the fact

00:43:24.501 --> 00:43:27.033
that Google
tests things a lot.

00:43:27.033 --> 00:43:28.801
Everybody in design points to
the fact

00:43:28.801 --> 00:43:34.033
that one of the famous
Google UI designers quit,

00:43:34.033 --> 00:43:36.534
and her famous thing was,
"It took months to do anything

00:43:36.534 --> 00:43:39.000
'cause we had to test
8,000 shades of gray."

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:42.934
So the question is, you know,
from your experiences,

00:43:42.934 --> 00:43:44.801
where do you
draw the line?

00:43:44.801 --> 00:43:48.467
You know, where do you really
find kind of the best compromise

00:43:48.467 --> 00:43:51.901
between testing
a bajillion shades of gray

00:43:51.901 --> 00:43:54.434
and then just actually
implementing one

00:43:54.434 --> 00:43:56.267
that you know will work?

00:43:56.267 --> 00:43:57.834
Without, like--

00:43:57.834 --> 00:44:00.300
so when you're going forward
and you're building features,

00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:01.801
There's, you know,
the continuum

00:44:01.801 --> 00:44:04.734
of testing every version
of every possible thing,

00:44:04.734 --> 00:44:06.801
or there's just doing it
the way you envision it

00:44:06.801 --> 00:44:09.367
and the way
that you think will work.

00:44:09.367 --> 00:44:10.734
How do you balance that?

00:44:10.734 --> 00:44:13.067
Do you have
any suggestions there?

00:44:13.067 --> 00:44:14.501
Collins-Sussman:
It's an interesting tension.

00:44:14.501 --> 00:44:16.734
Fitzpatrick: Yeah, I think it is
an interesting tension,

00:44:16.734 --> 00:44:19.434
and I probably have
a little different view

00:44:19.434 --> 00:44:20.801
than a lot of people
on that.

00:44:20.801 --> 00:44:23.634
So anybody here familiar
with EveryBlock.com

00:44:23.634 --> 00:44:25.667
or ChicagoCrime.org?

00:44:25.667 --> 00:44:26.968
EveryBlock.com
is an amazing site,

00:44:26.968 --> 00:44:29.167
especially if you live
in one of the cities it covers.

00:44:29.167 --> 00:44:31.567
But Adrian Holovaty, who
started it, is a friend of mine,

00:44:31.567 --> 00:44:33.901
and I was talking
to him, like,

00:44:33.901 --> 00:44:37.067
"Why does, like, the Jango
Web site look so beautiful?

00:44:37.067 --> 00:44:39.000
Why does ChicagoCrime
look so beautiful?"

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:40.300
I'm like,
"You're not a designer.

00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:41.501
"I know you're
not a designer.

00:44:41.501 --> 00:44:43.033
You're a journalist
and an engineer."

00:44:43.033 --> 00:44:44.467
And he said,

00:44:44.467 --> 00:44:49.701
"It's because I have a UX
designer who I really trust,

00:44:49.701 --> 00:44:53.367
and I can leave him to make
all the decisions for that."

00:44:53.367 --> 00:44:55.767
User experience
and user design, I think,

00:44:55.767 --> 00:44:57.400
Is actually
incredibly sophisticated,

00:44:57.400 --> 00:44:59.434
but it's a thing
that most engineers--

00:44:59.434 --> 00:45:01.801
myself too,
at some point--

00:45:01.801 --> 00:45:03.334
think that they can
just understand.

00:45:03.334 --> 00:45:04.767
Same for PR.

00:45:04.767 --> 00:45:07.501
I think most engineers are like,
"Oh, this is a soft skill,

00:45:07.501 --> 00:45:09.367
I could figure this out,"
when you really can't.

00:45:09.367 --> 00:45:11.634
And you don't have as much
of a respect for, I think,

00:45:11.634 --> 00:45:12.934
other peoples'
abilities in that.

00:45:12.934 --> 00:45:15.234
So I personally believe
that most of the time

00:45:15.234 --> 00:45:17.734
if you can find
someone who you trust,

00:45:17.734 --> 00:45:19.601
and let them sort of
make that decision...

00:45:19.601 --> 00:45:22.400
If there's not a lot of trust
between those two,

00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:24.667
I would say you might
have some issues,

00:45:24.667 --> 00:45:28.267
especially if you don't respect
what they're doing or saying.

00:45:28.267 --> 00:45:29.667
Collins-Sussman: I think that
the tension you're pointing out

00:45:29.667 --> 00:45:32.400
is between art
and science.

00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:34.601
There's an art to it,
and there's a science to it.

00:45:34.601 --> 00:45:37.167
Some people have good taste,
some people have terrible taste.

00:45:37.167 --> 00:45:39.767
Fitzpatrick: That's subjective.
We always have good taste.

00:45:39.767 --> 00:45:40.934
Collins-Sussman:
Always. Right.

00:45:40.934 --> 00:45:42.467
Everyone else
always has bad taste.

00:45:42.467 --> 00:45:46.067
But I guess my feeling about it
is you need to find people

00:45:46.067 --> 00:45:49.667
with good taste to get you,
you know, 80% of the way there.

00:45:49.667 --> 00:45:52.767
And maybe they'll make sort of
the artful decisions

00:45:52.767 --> 00:45:56.100
that are more emotional,
less rational,

00:45:56.100 --> 00:45:58.734
to sort of decide maybe
the overall look and feel,

00:45:58.734 --> 00:46:00.901
or what features
are exposed or whatnot,

00:46:00.901 --> 00:46:02.667
and then that last 20%

00:46:02.667 --> 00:46:05.167
can sort of go into the realm
of scientific testing.

00:46:05.167 --> 00:46:06.400
Like, what color
should this be?

00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:08.167
Exactly how wide
should this part be?

00:46:08.167 --> 00:46:11.501
And maybe there really are
measurable usability metrics

00:46:11.501 --> 00:46:13.334
that come from
that scientific bit.

00:46:13.334 --> 00:46:15.601
So there is a tension,
but I think they can cooperate.

00:46:15.601 --> 00:46:16.667
If you--
if you do it right.

00:46:16.667 --> 00:46:18.067
It's not all
one or the other.

00:46:18.067 --> 00:46:19.234
Fitzpatrick:
And I still think

00:46:19.234 --> 00:46:20.868
that there's opportunity
for testing.

00:46:20.868 --> 00:46:22.067
In the engineering side,

00:46:22.067 --> 00:46:23.200
you can make it easy
to do experiments

00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:24.534
or that sort of thing,

00:46:24.534 --> 00:46:25.834
especially if you're
dealing with network apps

00:46:25.834 --> 00:46:26.868
and not something
you have to, you know,

00:46:26.868 --> 00:46:28.534
buy a CD and download it.

00:46:28.534 --> 00:46:32.300
Those days are thankfully
going away, I think.

00:46:32.300 --> 00:46:35.234
But again,
there is a balance there,

00:46:35.234 --> 00:46:36.400
but I think
it really requires

00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:38.734
some sort of trust
and respect

00:46:38.734 --> 00:46:40.667
of the folks
on the other side of the fence.

00:46:40.667 --> 00:46:43.267
Just like it requires trust
and respect for your users.

00:46:43.267 --> 00:46:44.601
That they're staying--

00:46:44.601 --> 00:46:46.834
What they want--What a majority
of them say they want

00:46:46.834 --> 00:46:48.234
is something that's good
to add to your product.

00:46:48.234 --> 00:46:50.534
Collins-Sussman:
UI is a really hard field.

00:46:50.534 --> 00:46:52.200
Fitzpatrick:
It really is.

00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:53.868
And engineers beat the heck
out of UI people.

00:46:53.868 --> 00:46:55.634
Collins-Sussman: Anyone who may
not be a programmer

00:46:55.634 --> 00:46:57.901
must not be
very skilled.

00:46:57.901 --> 00:46:59.634
There's sort of this weird
bias in the industry.

00:46:59.634 --> 00:47:01.100
Fitzpatrick: What are
the different things

00:47:01.100 --> 00:47:02.501
that engineers
think they can do?

00:47:02.501 --> 00:47:06.567
UI design, PR, legal stuff.
All these different things.

00:47:06.567 --> 00:47:08.934
Just read things they had
compiled into a head, right?

00:47:08.934 --> 00:47:10.734
Rarely is it the case.

00:47:10.734 --> 00:47:12.234
Next question.

00:47:12.234 --> 00:47:13.501
audience member:
So as a person that actually

00:47:13.501 --> 00:47:14.968
does a little bit
of everything--

00:47:14.968 --> 00:47:16.334
engineering,
UI design, everything--

00:47:16.334 --> 00:47:18.334
I can say that actually UI
design is pretty difficult.

00:47:18.334 --> 00:47:20.100
Something that
I'm still having

00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:22.400
a hard time getting
a good grasp of it.

00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:26.334
One of the challenges
that we're having is that

00:47:26.334 --> 00:47:30.100
I mean, what's a preferred
method of educating your users?

00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:32.701
So you do have
a piece of technology

00:47:32.701 --> 00:47:35.133
that you can do
fantastic stuff with it,

00:47:35.133 --> 00:47:39.133
but you need to get users
to use it the right way.

00:47:39.133 --> 00:47:40.934
There needs to be
a little bit of education.

00:47:40.934 --> 00:47:42.100
I know it goes
counterintuitive--

00:47:42.100 --> 00:47:43.901
So you have to
make it simple enough

00:47:43.901 --> 00:47:46.200
that everyone can just
get it right off the bat.

00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:47.334
What if there are--

00:47:47.334 --> 00:47:48.801
Like, for some of
the mail application

00:47:48.801 --> 00:47:50.267
you guys showed
from Eudora,

00:47:50.267 --> 00:47:51.968
that was an overkill,

00:47:51.968 --> 00:47:55.067
but what if there
is some essential steps

00:47:55.067 --> 00:47:57.467
that they really
have to take?

00:47:57.467 --> 00:47:59.868
In your experience, what's the
best recommendation to do that?

00:47:59.868 --> 00:48:03.634
Is it videos,
images, step--making--

00:48:03.634 --> 00:48:07.767
splicing it up so people
go into chunks?

00:48:07.767 --> 00:48:09.033
Fitzpatrick:
I'd probably start

00:48:09.033 --> 00:48:10.334
with user testing,
quite frankly.

00:48:10.334 --> 00:48:11.701
'Cause I think once you--

00:48:11.701 --> 00:48:13.467
If you get something and you
put someone in front of it

00:48:13.467 --> 00:48:14.534
who's not a super
tech-savvy person,

00:48:14.534 --> 00:48:16.701
who's unfamiliar
with it,

00:48:16.701 --> 00:48:18.300
and look at what
they do first.

00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:20.467
Look at what confuses them,
look at where they get lost.

00:48:20.467 --> 00:48:23.167
I think that's a very
telling kind of thing.

00:48:23.167 --> 00:48:24.868
Beyond that,
certainly documentation,

00:48:24.868 --> 00:48:26.334
you know, fun videos.

00:48:26.334 --> 00:48:29.834
I mean, remember years ago
Rails did that video

00:48:29.834 --> 00:48:31.567
of how easy it was
to build an app.

00:48:31.567 --> 00:48:33.968
And that was a huge win
for those guys.

00:48:33.968 --> 00:48:35.901
You know, 'cause it was
a couple minutes long,

00:48:35.901 --> 00:48:37.100
and you could see
how easy it was

00:48:37.100 --> 00:48:38.801
to build their
sort of demo app.

00:48:38.801 --> 00:48:41.067
Collins-Sussman: The things that
I've seen actually not work well

00:48:41.067 --> 00:48:44.868
is when a company puts
all their eggs into either--

00:48:44.868 --> 00:48:47.801
People learn sort of
bottom up or top down.

00:48:47.801 --> 00:48:50.567
And some people want the
overview, they want the video,

00:48:50.567 --> 00:48:52.968
they want to read
the manual.

00:48:52.968 --> 00:48:54.901
And some people
just want to jump in

00:48:54.901 --> 00:48:57.133
and play with it
and figure it out as they go.

00:48:57.133 --> 00:48:59.033
And there are
different techniques

00:48:59.033 --> 00:49:01.033
for teaching both ways,

00:49:01.033 --> 00:49:04.367
and one of the things
I see companies don't do

00:49:04.367 --> 00:49:06.367
is they choose
just one technique.

00:49:06.367 --> 00:49:09.601
Like, maybe they'll have
an online help system

00:49:09.601 --> 00:49:11.267
that's just
for bottom-up users,

00:49:11.267 --> 00:49:12.767
but there won't be
an overview anywhere.

00:49:12.767 --> 00:49:15.334
Or maybe they'll do a video
that has a general overview

00:49:15.334 --> 00:49:17.100
of how the system works
and how cool it is,

00:49:17.100 --> 00:49:18.868
but then there won't be
any bottom-up learning.

00:49:18.868 --> 00:49:21.167
No, you know, help system

00:49:21.167 --> 00:49:23.300
that's sort of contact sensitive
or anything like that.

00:49:23.300 --> 00:49:26.801
So I think you need to think
about both kinds of users.

00:49:26.801 --> 00:49:28.100
That's my pet peeve.

00:49:28.100 --> 00:49:30.267
audience member:
And also, can you guys--

00:49:30.267 --> 00:49:33.767
Are you guys familiar
with the process that Google--

00:49:33.767 --> 00:49:36.067
that the iPhone team
had to go through

00:49:36.067 --> 00:49:39.067
in order to make
the Google mobile app?

00:49:39.067 --> 00:49:41.367
Fitzpatrick: Um, no I'm not.
Collins-Sussman: No idea.

00:49:41.367 --> 00:49:43.167
Fitzpatrick: Got about it online
if you know, maybe.

00:49:43.167 --> 00:49:44.667
audience member:
Thank you.

00:49:44.667 --> 00:49:46.868
Fitzpatrick: They go to Steve
and yells at him or something?

00:49:46.868 --> 00:49:48.234
Collins-Sussman:
Well, should we call?

00:49:48.234 --> 00:49:49.300
Fitzpatrick:
I think we're gonna--

00:49:49.300 --> 00:49:50.434
We'll be up here
for a few minutes

00:49:50.434 --> 00:49:51.868
and then we'll step
outside,

00:49:51.868 --> 00:49:53.234
but if you have anything else
you want to chat with us about,

00:49:53.234 --> 00:49:54.501
please stop by.

00:49:54.501 --> 00:49:55.501
Thanks again for coming.
Collins-Sussman: Thank you.

00:49:55.501 --> 00:49:58.434
[applause]
