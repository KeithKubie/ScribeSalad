00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:06.086
&gt;&gt;Liza: Games are great ways to
assess student learning in action.

00:00:06.356 --> 00:00:09.296
They can help you figure out what
your students know and how they think.

00:00:09.476 --> 00:00:12.086
Any kind of game has the
power to make student thinking

00:00:12.086 --> 00:00:14.306
and doing visible, not
just digital games.

00:00:14.486 --> 00:00:20.756
&gt;&gt;Two, four, three, Go to
there, go to there, go to there.

00:00:21.656 --> 00:00:22.946
&gt;&gt;Three, four, give, six.

00:00:23.306 --> 00:00:28.616
&gt;&gt;Bam, well you can still exchange it.

00:00:28.616 --> 00:00:31.376
&gt;&gt;Liza: Choices that students make
during game play provide lots of data

00:00:31.646 --> 00:00:34.606
about what they do and don't
understand, and how they apply skills,

00:00:34.646 --> 00:00:36.146
like critical thinking
and problem solving.

00:00:36.346 --> 00:00:39.756
Games also provide immediate feedback
to students about their choices,

00:00:39.806 --> 00:00:41.796
so they can take control
of their own learning.

00:00:42.146 --> 00:00:45.256
This brings you up to evaluate more
than just content knowledge and skills

00:00:45.256 --> 00:00:47.716
for a deeper understanding of
what students are learning.

00:00:47.916 --> 00:00:51.206
And the best part about
using games as assessments is

00:00:51.206 --> 00:00:54.016
that sometimes students have
so much fun playing a game,

00:00:54.116 --> 00:00:56.286
they don't even realize
they're being assessed.

00:00:56.286 --> 00:00:56.656
&gt;&gt;Students: Three.

00:00:56.656 --> 00:00:57.096
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Three.

00:00:57.166 --> 00:01:00.356
&gt;&gt;Students: Two, one, go.

00:01:04.166 --> 00:01:07.000
&lt;students cheering&gt;

00:01:07.146 --> 00:01:09.896
&gt;&gt;Liza: So how do you assess
student learning using a game?

00:01:11.556 --> 00:01:13.696
Step one, produce a product.

00:01:14.196 --> 00:01:16.446
Students can create something
during game play

00:01:16.446 --> 00:01:17.776
to show what they are learning.

00:01:18.096 --> 00:01:21.356
For example, the goal of a
card game might be for students

00:01:21.356 --> 00:01:24.386
to write a collaborative story, based
around the cards they are dealt.

00:01:24.856 --> 00:01:27.066
Step two, question students.

00:01:27.596 --> 00:01:29.626
You can develop a list
of probing questions

00:01:29.626 --> 00:01:31.256
to ask students during game play.

00:01:31.766 --> 00:01:34.976
As students play, move around the
classroom and ask those questions.

00:01:35.616 --> 00:01:37.866
Step three, track moves.

00:01:38.526 --> 00:01:41.476
Ask students to track the moves
they make during game play.

00:01:41.476 --> 00:01:45.046
At the end of the game, you can evaluate
the choices they made while playing.

00:01:47.596 --> 00:01:49.846
Step one, mod a game.

00:01:50.296 --> 00:01:53.306
Modding a game means changing
one or two things about a game.

00:01:53.706 --> 00:01:57.446
For example, you can ask students to
change one rule and then explain how

00:01:57.446 --> 00:01:59.196
that impacts what they
are learning in the game.

00:01:59.696 --> 00:02:01.936
Step two, design a game.

00:02:02.196 --> 00:02:05.766
Ask students to design their own
games to reach the same learning goal.

00:02:06.076 --> 00:02:08.836
Then students can play each
other's games, give feedback

00:02:09.086 --> 00:02:10.496
and review content and skills.

00:02:11.386 --> 00:02:14.726
Step three, write a strategy guide.

00:02:14.726 --> 00:02:17.526
After playing a game, students
can use what they learned

00:02:17.526 --> 00:02:20.916
to write their own strategy guides,
to help new players learn how to win.

00:02:21.286 --> 00:02:22.496
Thanks for watching.

00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:26.406

tips from Institute of Play.
