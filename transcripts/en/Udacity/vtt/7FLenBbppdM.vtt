00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.780
Let's begin with an exercise.

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:04.530
We'll use a code example instead of a design example, but

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:06.510
the principles of reviewing are the same.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:08.840
The following code is written in Java.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.360
It computes the sin function for

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.070
argument x to accuracy e using a Maclaurin series expansion.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.910
In the example, line numbers appear in parentheses at the beginning of

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:17.570
each line.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.080
They are not part of the program but are there so we can refer to the lines.
