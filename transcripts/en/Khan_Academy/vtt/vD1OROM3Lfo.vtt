00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:07.310
All right we're on problem
113 on page 287.

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:09.340
So they've drawn this thing.

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.570
Let me see if I could draw it.

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.872
So we have a right triangle
in the center.

00:00:14.872 --> 00:00:16.552
So that's the side.

00:00:16.552 --> 00:00:20.140
That's the other side,
and then the base.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.380
Right triangle.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.880
And then they drew some
squares on every

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.180
side of that triangle.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:33.730
Let me see if I can do that.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:34.980
That's one square.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.950
Well, I don't know how I'm going
to draw the other square

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.490
because I don't know how
to draw an angled one.

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:44.604
I'll just draw the lines.

00:00:44.604 --> 00:00:47.110
That's the other square.

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.480
And the last one.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.330
I'll just draw in some lines
something like this.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:01:00.472
It comes up like that, like
that and like that.

00:01:00.472 --> 00:01:02.130
So that's what they have.

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:08.930
And they call this A, this B,
C, D, and they tell us that

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.180
this is a right angle.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.880
They say, in the figure above,
if the area of triangular

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:25.070
region D is 4, what is the
length of a side of

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.090
square region A?

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.830
So all of these are-- well, they
don't tell us that this

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.130
and this are a square region
just yet, but they tell us

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.230
this is a square region.

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.120
So the length of this side-- if
we know the length of this

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.670
side and that side, then we can
figure out the length of

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.520
the hypotenuse of this
right triangle, so

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.530
that's all we need.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:57.570
And let's see, let's call this
length right here little b.

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.870
And let's call this
length little c.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.905
So we already know that, if we
know the area of this triangle

00:02:03.905 --> 00:02:07.800
is 4, we know that little b
times little c, so height

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.600
times base times 1/2,
is equal to 4.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.600
But that also tells us that
b be times little

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.890
c is equal to 8.

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:17.910
I don't know that does for us.

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.410
Let's read the statements.

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.470
Statement number 1.

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.190
The area of square
region B is 9.

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.150
So B is equal to 9.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.460
Well, that's useful.

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.250
If the area of this region,
and it's a square, is 9,

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.220
what's each of the sides
going to be?

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.800
The sides are going to be
the square root of that.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.550
Little b is going to
be equal to 3.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.160
If little b is equal to
3, then the area of

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.090
this is 3 times 3.

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.760
We can do that because it's a
square, which would be 9.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.740
So if little b is 3,
then what is C?

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:57.630
Well, then we get that C is
equal to 8/3 using this

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.260
information.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.520
And we got that, remember, just
based on the fact that

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.550
the area of this triangle
right here is 4.

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.910
So little b times little c times
1/2 would equal to 4.

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.700
So, if we know what little b and
we know what little c is,

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.880
then we can solve for-- let's
call that little a.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.410
And little a is what the
whole point was about.

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.520
What is the length of a side
of the square region A?

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.220
So we could just solve for b
squared plus c squared is

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.550
equal to a squared, right?

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.590
This squared soon. plus this
squared is equal to the

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.330
hypotenuse squared.

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:33.880
And we just solve for
a and we'd be done.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.430
So statement one alone
is sufficient.

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.570
And this is really messy,
especially taking an 8/3

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.110
squared and all that, so
I'm not going to do it.

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.030
And it would be a waste of
time on the GMAT anyway.

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.380
Let's look at statement
number two.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.020
The area of square region
C is 64/9, so C is

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.240
equal to 64 over 9.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.760
So this is kind of very similar
to the information

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:58.860
they gave us in statement one.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.530
If the area of this is 64/9 and
this is a square region,

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.480
then the length of each of its
sides, or in this case, little

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.430
c, the length of little c is
just going to be the square

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.940
root of that.

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.690
So little c is going to be 8/3,
which is exactly what we

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:13.790
figured out here.

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.680
And then we could use this
information that we got from

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.390
the problem statement that b
times c is going to be equal

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:21.800
to 8, and we got that from the
fact that the area of this

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.560
triangle is 4.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:29.410
So we use that and we can figure
out that b times 8/3 is

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.220
equal to 8.

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.400
And then you get b is equal to
3, and then you apply this

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.570
again to solve for a.

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.930
So each of the statements one
and two are each individually

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.730
sufficient to answer
this question.

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:46.110
Next problem.

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:50.500
114.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.210
If x is to be selected at random
from set T, what is the

00:04:54.210 --> 00:05:04.490
probability that 1/4x minus 5
is less than or equal to 0?

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.210
Let's simplify this real fast.
That means that what's the

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:11.310
probably that 1/4x
is less than 5?

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:12.850
And that means what's
the probability?

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:14.290
Let's multiply both
sides by 4.

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:16.590
I just added 5 to
both sides here.

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.230
And let's multiply
both sides by 4.

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:20.540
And we don't have to change the
inequality since 4 is a

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:21.670
positive number.

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:23.480
So it's the same thing as what's
the probability that x

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.630
is less than 20?

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:27.770
And I like this a lot more
because it's just simple and

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.920
it lets my brain grasp
the problem better.

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.990
Now, what are the statements
they give us?

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:39.020
Statement one: T is a
set of 8 integers.

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:40.870
T has 8 integers.

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:48.430
That by itself doesn't help me
because I don't know what

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:49.580
those eight integers
look like.

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:55.740
I mean, maybe all eight could
be larger than 20, in which

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:57.990
case, it would be impossible to
find one that's less than

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:00.320
or equal to 20, or maybe all 8
are less than 20, in which

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.160
case, you would have
100% chance.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.480
So statement one by itself
is fairly useless.

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:06.910
Statement two.

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:21.890
T is contained in the set of
integers from 1 to 25.

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:23.690
So that also doesn't help me.

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:29.910
So T within 1 to 25.

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:32.500
So they're essentially telling
us that every number in T is

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:33.930
between this range.

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:36.720
But if we just take statement
two alone, they're not telling

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.360
us, first of all, how many
numbers are in T.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:40.750
Statement one tells us that,
but statement two

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:41.740
doesn't tell us.

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.900
And then even if we knew how
many numbers were in T, we

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:46.200
don't know where they're
distributed.

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:50.010
Maybe all of the numbers in T
are less than 20, in which

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:52.144
case, there is 100% chance that
you would select one that

00:06:52.144 --> 00:06:53.150
was less than 20.

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:57.660
But maybe 4 of them are
greater than 20.

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:00.470
you Maybe you have
21, 22, 23, 24.

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:03.400
And four of them are less
than 20, or maybe

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:04.280
something in between.

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:07.670
So given that, you still don't
know where T is distributed

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:08.900
relative to 20.

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:12.740
So I say that we still don't
have enough information, even

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:16.300
with both of these statements,
to solve this problem.

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:19.200
Next question.

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:19.810
115.

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:23.470
It takes the most confidence to
choose that E, to say that

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:26.040
one cannot solve this problem.

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:28.720
115.

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:29.950
I'm always second-guessing
myself.

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:31.440
I'm like, well, let me make
sure I haven't missed some

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:32.260
piece of information.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:33.370
No, but I'm pretty
confident here.

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:33.850
All right.

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:35.020
115.

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:44.370
If Sarah's age is exactly twice
Bill's age, what is

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:45.160
Sarah's age?

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.600
They want to know Sarah's age.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:48.845
S for Sarah's age.

00:07:48.845 --> 00:07:52.490
Let me scroll down
a little bit.

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:56.750
Problem statement number one
says four years ago, Sarah's

00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:59.740
age was exactly three
times Bill's age.

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:03.380
So Sarah's age four years
ago, so Sarah minus 4.

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:04.640
S is Sarah's age today.

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:13.090
So Sarah minus 4 was exactly
three times Bill's age, so was

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:18.230
three times Bill's age then,
so B minus 4, right?

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:20.565
Sarah's age four years ago
was three times Bill's

00:08:20.565 --> 00:08:22.060
age four years ago.

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:23.010
Fair enough.

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:25.070
So just with this and this,
can I solve for S?

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:25.850
Well, sure.

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:29.850
I have two linear equations
and two unknowns, so I can

00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:31.530
solve for either variable.

00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:35.880
And to prove it to you, I'll
do it, although this, once

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:41.169
again, is a waste of time from
the point of view of the GMAT.

00:08:41.169 --> 00:08:46.660
S is equal to 3B minus 8.

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:51.680
And then B-- from there we get
B is equal to S/2, so S is

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:53.000
equal to 3, right?

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.140
I just divide 2 into
both sides.

00:08:56.140 --> 00:09:02.400
So 3S/2 minus 8.

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:03.960
What can I do here?

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.740
So I have 1 and 1/2 S.

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:07.140
I could subtract it
from both sides.

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:11.580
I'll have minus-- I'm doing it
fast just to-- minus 1/2S is

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:13.230
equal to minus 8.

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:16.730
And then multiply both sides by
minus 2, and you get Sarah

00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:18.480
is 16 years old.

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:19.300
And you're done.

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:20.960
But you didn't have
to do any of this.

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.260
That was all a waste of time.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.155
You just had to see that you had
two linear equations and

00:09:25.155 --> 00:09:27.230
two unknowns, which is
enough to solve for

00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:30.120
either of the variables.

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:35.590
Statement two tells us, eight
years from now, Sarah's age

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:38.690
will be exactly 1.5
times Bill's age.

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:39.770
So, same thing.

00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:46.860
Sarah's age eight years from now
is going to be equal to 1

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:53.050
and 1/2 times Bill's age
eight years from now.

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:53.730
Same thing.

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:57.060
We have two linear equations,
one that they gave in the

00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:58.810
problem statement and one
they gave in statement

00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:00.330
two, and two unknowns.

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:03.300
No reason why you can't solve
for both variables.

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:04.290
And you might want to do it for

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:05.710
yourself just as an exercise.

00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:08.100
But you'd do it the same way
you did it right here.

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:10.210
I always find substitution to
be the easiest, especially

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:14.870
when one of the equations is
really easy to manipulate.

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:17.260
So each statement individually
is sufficient

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.140
to solve this problem.

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:20.750
Next problem.

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:23.220
116.

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:24.560
Oh, I just realized
I'm out of time.

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:26.040
I'll do 116 in the next video.

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:27.290
