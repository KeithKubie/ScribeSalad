00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.230
For the rest of the course, we're only

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:04.990
going to be using these letters over here,

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.160
which are the symbols of the DNA code.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.080
But never forget that what we're actually working with

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.970
here is chemistry, because chemistry is the heart

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.790
of this biology, one really useful phrase to remember

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:20.930
as we continue in this course is that

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.930
structure is Function. And, what we mean by that,

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.740
is if we change one letter, or one nitrogenous base pair, then that means the

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.880
structure, the chemical structure, has changed at

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.150
that nitrogenous base pair. So, although you just

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.230
see a letter difference, the chemistry has

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.750
changed. And in the chemical world, molecules interact

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.040
based on whether their structures let them. If

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.070
the structure changes, then so can the function.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.530
In reality, other molecules are actually able

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.970
to come and interact with the chemistry

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:05.430
of the DNA here. We consider that reading the base pairs. So even though

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.540
we're just symbolizing them with letters, the

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.560
molecular chemistry is actually interacting. So if

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.150
a letter in the DNA changes then the structure changes and there's going to be a

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.940
change in what other molecules can interact and the overall function can change.
