00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
[Captions by Y Translator]
Today, we're going to see

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.800
what happens if you put rocks
in a vacuum chamber,

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.100
and try and explain
the result that we get.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:12.300
[Music]

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.300
Over the years,
we have had dozens,

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.600
if not hundreds of people
asking to see what would happen

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.140
if we put a rock,
in a vacuum chamber.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:21.800
I'm pretty sure, I
already know the answer,

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.900
but because so many
of you have asked,

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:24.800
we are going to try it,

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.900
and then we're going
to discuss why we're seeing,

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.060
what we're seeing.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.300
The idea here is about
as simple as it gets.

00:00:30.302 --> 00:00:31.900
We'll take a few
different types of rock,

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.100
put them into
our vacuum chamber,

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.560
and suck out all the air.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.940
I've got a few different
types of rock here.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.500
This one, I just pulled
out of a planter box.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.922
It's a pretty
standard looking rock.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.362
It feels heavy.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.100
It's hard.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.540
I would just call that a rock.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.900
This second rock is
a volcanic type of rock

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.200
that's called Scoria.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.500
It's formed when lava comes up
out of the ground,

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.800
and hitting lower pressure
forms lots of bubbles,

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.100
and then cools off like that.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.600
It's not quite as light
or air filled as pumice,

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.120
but it is similar.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.100
These two rocks are varieties.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.200
of what at least
claim to be pumice.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.140
They're both
commercially available.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.000
This black one is sold
at fabric stores,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.900
and is designed for restoring
the proper texture on sweaters.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.900
It's extremely lightweight,

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.300
and basically,
it feels just like a sponge,

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.500
except it's made of rock.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.100
This second one is
a cleaning stone.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.700
I just got this
at a department store.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.492
It costs like
a dollar and fifty.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.900
Again, this claims
to be natural stone

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.300
that's just been cut
into the shape.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.600
I'm not sure if it's supposed
to be actual pumice,

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.100
or just something
a lot like pumice.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.400
Pumice is another type
of volcanic rock

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.600
that forms about the same way,

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.580
as the magma comes up
out of the ground.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.200
It's no longer pressurized,

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.900
and all of the dissolved gases
in it form bubbles in it,

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.300
then solidifies in that state.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.300
Pumice is supposed to be a rock
that's so light and full of air

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.400
that it can actually
float on water,

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.020
and we'll probably do
a little bit of that in a minute

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.700
after we've done
our vacuum tests.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.700
I don't want to vacuum them
while they're wet,

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.900
so we're just going to do
our vacuum test first,

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.000
and if they survive,
we'll try the water thing.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.100
We're now going to take
each of these rocks,

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.492
and give them a chance
to experience being

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.860
in a vacuum chamber.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.700
We're going to start
with our densest rock.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.500
Just set that down in there,

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.502
and see what happens is
we pull all the air out.

00:02:11.502 --> 00:02:26.400
[Music]

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.980
All right.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.400
That didn't do anything.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.112
In fact, it did so little

00:02:32.002 --> 00:02:34.200
that I'm going to add
a visual aid just to show

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.100
that things are
getting vacuumed.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.800
This is a ziplock bag,
and it's just sealed off.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:46.900
We're just going to add just
a tiny bit of air into it so...

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.500
Now let's see
if the bag does anything,

00:02:50.402 --> 00:02:51.800
while it's in the chamber
with the rock.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.000
Just so we can see

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.462
if we're really
getting low pressure.

00:02:54.462 --> 00:02:58.080
[Music]

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.640
Bag is already moving.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.960
[Music]

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.000
Bag can barely be held
in place by our vacuum chamber.

00:03:10.222 --> 00:03:12.000
All right, so the bags expanded.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.600
You can see the difference
in the vacuum.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.500
You can see
what happens-- Oh wow,

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.222
and now, it's collapsing.

00:03:19.222 --> 00:03:23.980
[Music]

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.500
The bag expanded a ton

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.100
as we sucked all the air
out of our jar.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.080
The rock did not move at all.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:31.700
Rock - 1, vacuum chamber - 0.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.300
Let's move on
to our scoria rock.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.100
This rock has a lot more air
in it than the last one.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.620
So maybe it will be different?

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:49.980
[Music]

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.120
I think that's as low pressure
as we're gonna get.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.480
And once again,

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.020
a whole lot of nothing
happening to this rock here.

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.100
That was air rushing from
the valve pushing on the rock,

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.700
not the change in pressure.

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.800
All right,

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.722
let's move on to our really
lightweight rocks.

00:04:10.542 --> 00:04:12.852
This one is mixed up in density.

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:22.780
[Music]

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.000
Nothing with that stone.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.762
We've got one more left to try.

00:04:25.762 --> 00:04:34.200
[Music]

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.952
That's about as much vacuum is
we're going to pull.

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:43.060
[Music]

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.980
And really, no change at all.

00:04:48.552 --> 00:04:49.900
I just want to do a little test.

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.100
You can't really feel
these different rocks,

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.172
but we've got a scale here.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.300
We've got grams and grams.

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.300
This rock is 147,
and this rock,

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:02.492
which I would say is

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.220
approximately double the volume...

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:08.100
22.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.100
So this rock weighs,

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:13.400
more than six times as
much as this pumice brick here,

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.500
and this pumice brick is
probably twice the volume.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:20.000
Which means this is 12 or 13
times less dense than this rock.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.200
This one has so much air in it.

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.600
We are going to do
a quick demonstration to see

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.620
if these two rocks
float on water.

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:41.140
[Music]

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:43.400
Seriously, this one is
like about the density

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.662
of styrofoam, I think.

00:05:46.262 --> 00:05:47.505
Floats extremely well.

00:05:47.505 --> 00:05:56.160
[Music]

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.400
Now that I've put
this in the water,

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.700
we're going to throw it back in
the vacuum chamber, and just see

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.272
if it pulls any water out.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:12.220
[Music]

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:13.720
Not really much there either.

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:19.320
[Music]

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:22.000
So the water that got
on this wasn't really pulled,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.300
into the stone at all.

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:24.822
It was mostly just
on the holes

00:06:24.822 --> 00:06:25.900
and the surface of the stone.

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:27.100
But why is it

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:30.152
that we can put a Ziploc bag
in with almost no air,

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.460
and it balloons up to fill
this whole container,

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.460
but the stones that have

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.900
so many little bubbles don't
really seem to do anything?

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.300
It has to do with
how a vacuum chamber works.

00:06:41.342 --> 00:06:43.700
Normal air, the air
that surround us,

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:48.940
if we are at sea level,
that's approximately 14.7 psi,

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:51.200
which stands for pounds
per square inch.

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.400
That means that every square
inch on your skin,

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:55.000
your clothes,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.200
everything around you has about
15 pounds of pressure on it.

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.000
That's like the size
of a large bowling ball

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000
pressing down on it.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.100
It doesn't feel like that
because that's always there.

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:08.300
That's what we've grown with,
and down to our very cells,

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:10.620
that's what's normal to us.

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:13.760
When we start pulling the air
out of the vacuum chamber,

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.600
it's no longer
pressing on things.

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:17.722
So inside the ziploc bag,

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:22.900
if we just open this bag,
put a little bit of air into it,

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:24.900
and then put that
into the vacuum chamber,

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:26.880
when we turn
the vacuum chamber on,

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:31.500
there's no longer 15 psi,
squishing down on this bag,

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.420
but there is still air inside,

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:35.900
and that air went
into the bag at 15 psi,

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:38.920
which means if we pull
a perfect vacuum,

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:42.220
all of that air
would begin to press out

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:43.620
with that same pressure.

00:07:44.432 --> 00:07:48.492
That would be 15 psi of air
inside a ziploc bag,

00:07:48.512 --> 00:07:51.200
and the ziploc bag can't really
take that much pressure.

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.360
It's got thin plastic walls.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.200
Squashed down flat again.

00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:59.600
Back to the almost,

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.700
entirely empty that it is,
but the thing is,

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:04.200
it's not perfectly empty.

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:08.000
There is a little bit
of air in this bag,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.300
and we can sort of maybe

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:11.400
squish it all into one spot
or something like that,

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:12.800
and we could see

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:16.800
that that tiny tiny amount
of air is what's expanding

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:19.142
on the inside when
the vacuum chamber is turned on.

00:08:20.172 --> 00:08:20.600
So, there you go.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.400
That's how air
there was in this bag.

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:26.500
And that expanded to completely
fill our little vacuum chamber.

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:28.300
So if the bag has
a little bit of air in it,

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:30.200
and the stones have
a little bit of air in it,

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:32.400
why is it the bag inflates,

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:33.900
but the stones
don't really change?

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:34.700
They don't inflate.

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:35.300
They don't crack.

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:36.300
They don't even chip.

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:38.100
There's not dust
flying off of them.

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:40.600
All through the inside of this
rocker tiny little air bubbles,

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:43.500
and when you pull
the air up around them,

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:44.800
they do start
exerting a pressure.

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:45.860
And as I said,

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:48.400
15 psi is a good
amount of pressure.

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:50.400
Each one of these tiny little
bubbles is only one or two

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:51.820
millimeters in diameter,

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:55.700
and although 15 pounds
per square inch is quite a lot.

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:58.200
When you divide it up,
it stops being so big,

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.200
and I know I'm crossing
measurement systems here,

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:01.500
but one square inch

00:09:01.512 --> 00:09:05.100
has approximately 645
square millimeters in it.

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:10.012
And when you divide the 15 psi
of the atmosphere by 645,

00:09:10.172 --> 00:09:13.792
you end up with 0.02
pounds of pressure.

00:09:13.792 --> 00:09:17.200
0.02 pounds of pressure
isn't enough to break

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.700
through the walls of this stone.

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:20.000
It is a soft stone.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.400
I think I can even
just break it off

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:23.800
and crumble it in my fingers,

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:28.400
but it's still not soft enough
that that tiny tiny amount

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:30.800
of air can break
through the walls of it.

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:33.700
So can you break rocks
apart by using vacuum?

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.200
No, you cannot break rocks
apart by using a vacuum.

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.400
At least none of the rocks
that I have available to me.

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:42.200
There may be some kinds
of pumice that are so light

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:45.800
and so weak and so full of air
that you can pull them apart,

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:47.700
and that seems like it
would be pretty fun to do.

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:49.700
But I've never used
one of those rocks.

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:51.760
I've never seen one
as far as I know,

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:54.000
and I don't think I'm gonna be
able to get my hands on one.

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:55.600
But it's interesting to learn

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:58.300
about why some things react
and some things don't,

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:00.700
and that's also sort
of a thought experiment,

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:03.000
when you're wondering,
what would happen to something

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.180
if you put it
into a vacuum chamber.

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:06.500
Is the amount of air

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:08.900
that's inside it enough
that it's going to overcome

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:11.500
the pressure of whatever's
holding that air in place?

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:13.100
So it is good to try things out,

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:15.600
although knowing
how the vacuum chamber works,

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.600
and what makes the difference
between something

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:20.800
that does or does not expand
can give you at least a start

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:23.100
of an idea when you're wondering
what's going to happen.

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:24.500
Guys, that's not all,

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:25.700
we've always got more
for you to see.

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:28.400
That box up at the top will take
you directly to our last video,

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:29.500
and you should go
check that out.

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:30.900
The other box will show you

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:32.700
what YouTube thinks you
should do watching next,

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:35.400
and if you aren't a subscriber yet,
just hit this bomb to get in the club,

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:36.900
and that way you'll
never miss out on the fun.

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.200
Don't forget to ring that bell,

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:39.400
and we will see you
in the next one.

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:40.480
Talk to you then.
