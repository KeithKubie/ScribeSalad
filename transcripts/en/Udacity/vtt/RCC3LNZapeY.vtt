00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.250
There are certain analytics that game
developers should always be thinking

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:06.950
about, and it always starts at
the high level of lifetime value.

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.530
Once you have a good idea of
how you want to measure or

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.550
calculate your lifetime value, then
you can determine what other analytics

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.480
in particular that you
want to be looking at.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.325
For instance, usually everybody
starts with retention, so

00:00:19.325 --> 00:00:21.621
that's the number of people
who are coming back or

00:00:21.621 --> 00:00:24.540
the percentage of people who
are coming back on specific days.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.780
Day 1, day 14, day 28.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.476
On the monetization side,

00:00:29.476 --> 00:00:34.670
it really depends on the type of
monetization method that you're using.

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.080
So, if you're using
primarily in-app purchases,

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.410
then you want to look at
the average revenue per purchase.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.630
The average purchase size.

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.374
If you're looking at things
such as monetizing through ads,

00:00:47.374 --> 00:00:50.903
then you want to look at ad
specific monetization metrics.

00:00:50.903 --> 00:00:53.712
So things like the effective
cost per thousand.

00:00:53.712 --> 00:00:56.720
The ECPM, the fill rate.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.040
As well as, frequencies that you're
showing ads, things like that.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.810
All of this is generally distilled into
the ARPU, the average revenue per user.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.730
Or the RPPU which is the average
revenue per paying user.

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.700
And along the way you can make up
whatever acronyms make the most sense

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:14.260
for your game.
