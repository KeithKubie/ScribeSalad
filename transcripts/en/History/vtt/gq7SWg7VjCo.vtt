00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:04.960
Ready?

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:05.960
Set.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:06.540
Go!

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:13.620
Don't jump!

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:14.620
Don't jump!

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.040
Whoa!

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.960
Hey, why would you do that?

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.330
[inaudible] Oh, medical!

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.330
Medical!

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:26.250
We need the medical up top.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.920
There's been a collision.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.080
I hit my nose on something.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.250
Yeah.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:30.920
Go ahead and pull
my glasses off.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.500
Cut your eye on your glasses.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.210
Is that what it is?

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.420
Sure did.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.080
Yeah, it might need a stitch.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.500
Let me know when
I get him in for it.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.040
Like any form of
motor sports, crashes,

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.830
bangs, and things take place.

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.170
We have safety equipment.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.330
You wear helmets, you
wear safety belts,

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:50.080
you wear all the stuff.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.420
We have roll bars.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.170
But that doesn't make
it perfectly safe.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.750
The key to any
emergency is being

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.380
able to get there quickly,
so we've got Matt here,

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:58.710
one of the firemen on set.

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.210
You guys are out
here every day, huh?

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.580
Absolutely.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:02.920
Every day that they're
running, we're out here.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.460
We've also got access
to helicopters,

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.580
and we can land them out
here, just about anywhere.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.460
So by the time we get
the patient stabilized,

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.290
the package, that helicopter
can be on the ground,

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.420
loaded up, and ready to go.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:12.620
Right on.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:13.620
Well, thanks for
being on board, and we

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:14.620
really appreciate you guys.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:15.290
Absolutely.

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:16.040
Yeah, man.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.210
Thank you, guys.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.290
David's cleared
medical protocol.

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:19.620
He's ready to continue.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.080
Went to Georgia, and
all I came home with

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.920
was this lousy scar.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:24.880
Ready?

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:25.880
Set!

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.580
Go!

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:29.120
Go!

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:45.500
Come on!

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.250
You gotta go!

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.120
It's a race!

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.290
I hurt my neck.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.420
Man, we have a lot of
carnage on the course, guys.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:53.960
I got a bad pain in my neck.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:54.830
All right.

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.750
Medical, medical.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.620
All right, guys,
paramedics are coming

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.500
in to take the driver away.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.330
Wiggle your toes.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:02.500
Wiggle one.
- Yep.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.500
All that's good.
- Everything good?

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.670
Yep.

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:05.580
You wanting to
go to the hospital?

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:06.170
- Yeah.
- All right.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.620
You see motorsports on TV,
and you don't think it's real.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.460
But the reality is
here on Truck Night,

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.330
these vehicles are,
in fact, jumping.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:17.790
They are hitting the ground.

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.500
They are doing things
they're not necessarily

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.000
supposed to be doing.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.330
And, in fact, there is a
consequence occasionally.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:24.920
We are en route
to the hospital.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.460
Our firemen are trained.

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.040
We have an extrication vehicle.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.000
We've got basic
first aid vehicles,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.170
and they're ready
to go at all times.

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.120
Thank you, guys.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.000
Thank you.

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.670
This is where it's going to
make or break him, right here.

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:46.540
Oh!

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.170
He pulled the back
tires off the ground.

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.540
He planted that
cross member right

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.040
on top of the rollercoaster.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.880
I'm stuck.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.000
That's it.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.170
You did awesome, dude.

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:58.330
You did awesome.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.120
We're going to get
you out of here.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.880
Excavator!

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.170
We have a kick-ass
recovery team that comes in

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.670
to get these things
out here, and they

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.420
have a lot of vehicles to
choose from to help them

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.710
get these rigs out of here.

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:19.250
We've got a pickup,
we got a buggy,

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.920
we have excavators--
heck, we even have dozers.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.880
And these guys use whatever
it takes to get them free.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.750
Once they get that
cross member unstuck,

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:28.580
he'll come right off of there.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:36.830
You've got some
heavy machinery,

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.380
but it takes a light touch.

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.210
These operators are amazing
here on Truck Night.

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.170
Well, there it is.

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.580
Just that easy.

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.080
Use your excavator, pop
him out of that thing.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.250
Recovery did their
job great once again,

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.420
and we're off to play.
