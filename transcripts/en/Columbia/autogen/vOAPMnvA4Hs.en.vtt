engage with Latino communities now and I

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870
engage with Latino communities now and I
 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.210
engage with Latino communities now and I
think one of the what the growth of

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220
think one of the what the growth of
 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.340
think one of the what the growth of
transnational communities in the United

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350
transnational communities in the United
 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:47.090

States does is it really creates almost

an existential challenge for the

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:49.200
an existential challenge for the
 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.470
an existential challenge for the
planning profession about how planners

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:51.480
planning profession about how planners
 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.020
planning profession about how planners
do their work which traditionally has

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030
do their work which traditionally has
 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.070
do their work which traditionally has
been focused on regulating land uses

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080
been focused on regulating land uses
 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:02.230
been focused on regulating land uses
really a management mindset working with

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240
really a management mindset working with
 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.900
really a management mindset working with
transnational communities requires being

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910
transnational communities requires being
 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:09.050
transnational communities requires being
more open to diversity quite frankly

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060
more open to diversity quite frankly
 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.320
more open to diversity quite frankly
more open to chaos and tension that

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330
more open to chaos and tension that
 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.950
more open to chaos and tension that
occurs when you have multi multiple

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960
occurs when you have multi multiple
 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.500
occurs when you have multi multiple
communities and then the integration of

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:18.510
communities and then the integration of
 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.180
communities and then the integration of
those multi multiple communities

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190
those multi multiple communities
 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.990
those multi multiple communities
creating really new sub communities

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000
creating really new sub communities
 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.580
creating really new sub communities
because people have multiple identities

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590
because people have multiple identities
 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.910
because people have multiple identities
as they as they move in their lives and

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:28.920
as they as they move in their lives and
 

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:33.260
as they as they move in their lives and
they live in another place so I think

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270
they live in another place so I think
 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.810
they live in another place so I think
the the challenge is one of the

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:35.820
the the challenge is one of the
 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.620
the the challenge is one of the
challenges is how planners work with

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:38.630
challenges is how planners work with
 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:41.360
challenges is how planners work with
Latino communities how planners think

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370
Latino communities how planners think
 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:45.170
Latino communities how planners think
about what their job is and I think the

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180
about what their job is and I think the
 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:46.970
about what their job is and I think the
challenge is going to be not just

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:46.980
challenge is going to be not just
 

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.430
challenge is going to be not just
thinking about regulating land use which

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440
thinking about regulating land use which
 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.430
thinking about regulating land use which
has had certain failures but thinking

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.440
has had certain failures but thinking
 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.300
has had certain failures but thinking
about how do you integrate how do you

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:56.310
about how do you integrate how do you
 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.700
about how do you integrate how do you
value difference how do you make it work

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:58.710
value difference how do you make it work
 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:03.470
value difference how do you make it work
within regulatory structures that for

within regulatory structures that for
 

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:06.440
within regulatory structures that for
the most part are focused on still

of land uses the other thing that I

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:11.610
of land uses the other thing that I
 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:15.920
of land uses the other thing that I
would say is focus on economic

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:15.930
would say is focus on economic
 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:18.560

and work in new jersey and we have a lot

00:06:45.649 --> 00:06:45.659
and work in new jersey and we have a lot
 

00:06:45.659 --> 00:06:48.950
and work in new jersey and we have a lot
of older smaller industrial spaces that

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:48.960
of older smaller industrial spaces that
 

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.800
of older smaller industrial spaces that
many of them are being converted into

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:50.810
many of them are being converted into
 

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:55.399
many of them are being converted into
either residential or retail spaces yet

00:06:55.399 --> 00:06:55.409
either residential or retail spaces yet
 

00:06:55.409 --> 00:07:00.589
either residential or retail spaces yet
many of those spaces could very well be

00:07:00.589 --> 00:07:00.599
many of those spaces could very well be
 

00:07:00.599 --> 00:07:06.879
many of those spaces could very well be
used and are being used as avenues for

00:07:06.879 --> 00:07:06.889
used and are being used as avenues for
 

00:07:06.889 --> 00:07:12.219

materials into Port Newark it gets
 

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:22.550
materials into Port Newark it gets
shipped over into a what's considered an

shipped over into a what's considered an
 

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:26.059

they those parts get assembled and then

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:28.500
they those parts get assembled and then
 

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:30.110
they those parts get assembled and then
they get sold in those ethnic

I can't be the only one speak

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:06.090
 
 

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:10.710
 
okay so this way the two planners will

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:10.720
okay so this way the two planners will
 

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:14.640
okay so this way the two planners will
do our thing and then other folks get in

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:14.650
do our thing and then other folks get in
 

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:24.030

I I really appreciate the tenor of the

I I really appreciate the tenor of the
panels to in in the way that they deal

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:26.920
panels to in in the way that they deal
 

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:29.790
panels to in in the way that they deal
with the complexity of issues and the

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:29.800
with the complexity of issues and the
 

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:36.060
with the complexity of issues and the
ambiguity of public spaces and I think

00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:36.070
ambiguity of public spaces and I think
 

00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:37.770
ambiguity of public spaces and I think
this is something that's very important

00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:37.780
this is something that's very important
 

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:41.010
this is something that's very important
in an interdisciplinary conference and

in an interdisciplinary conference and
 

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:43.830
in an interdisciplinary conference and
discussion and in a Trenton

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:43.840
discussion and in a Trenton
 

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:48.810

transnational environments so I think

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:48.820
transnational environments so I think
 

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:51.900
transnational environments so I think
this is really important an important

lesson that I got from the listening to

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:55.030
lesson that I got from the listening to
 

00:08:55.030 --> 00:09:00.090
lesson that I got from the listening to
the discussions today the but I'm

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:00.100
the discussions today the but I'm
 

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:04.350
the discussions today the but I'm
looking for some more clarity and I

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:04.360
looking for some more clarity and I
 

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:09.900
looking for some more clarity and I
think it's necessary to at the risk of

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:09.910
think it's necessary to at the risk of
 

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:12.270
think it's necessary to at the risk of
being called structuralist or

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:12.280
being called structuralist or
 

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:16.140
being called structuralist or
determinist or narrow look for

determinist or narrow look for
 

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:22.710
determinist or narrow look for
determination and I felt a relief when I

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:22.720
determination and I felt a relief when I
 

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:25.610

heard today sigh say in the last panel
 

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:29.150
heard today sigh say in the last panel
that labor and capital were involved and

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:29.160
that labor and capital were involved and
 

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:33.230
that labor and capital were involved and
that the mobility of labor and capital

00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:33.240
that the mobility of labor and capital
 

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:36.180
that the mobility of labor and capital
had a good deal to do and help to

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:36.190
had a good deal to do and help to
 

00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:40.500
had a good deal to do and help to
explain the complexities and ambiguities

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:40.510
explain the complexities and ambiguities
 

00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:45.120
explain the complexities and ambiguities
of what we're talking about there is

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:45.130
of what we're talking about there is

by itself is helpful but we need to go

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:20.390
by itself is helpful but we need to go
 

00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:22.990
by itself is helpful but we need to go
deeper I think and look at the

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:23.000
deeper I think and look at the
 

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.660
deeper I think and look at the

function in this way if we are really to
 

00:19:46.419 --> 00:19:49.289
function in this way if we are really to
take seriously the learnings that that

00:19:49.289 --> 00:19:49.299
take seriously the learnings that that
 

00:19:49.299 --> 00:19:52.379
take seriously the learnings that that
we are kind of engaging in conferences

00:19:52.379 --> 00:19:52.389
we are kind of engaging in conferences
 

00:19:52.389 --> 00:19:56.009
we are kind of engaging in conferences
like this because if let's say only

00:19:56.009 --> 00:19:56.019
like this because if let's say only
 

00:19:56.019 --> 00:19:59.190
like this because if let's say only
capital circulates and as you know

00:19:59.190 --> 00:19:59.200
capital circulates and as you know
 

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:01.200
capital circulates and as you know
gayatri spivak is fond of saying that's

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:01.210
gayatri spivak is fond of saying that's
 

00:20:01.210 --> 00:20:02.879
gayatri spivak is fond of saying that's
only in capital circulates and the rest

00:20:02.879 --> 00:20:02.889
only in capital circulates and the rest
 

00:20:02.889 --> 00:20:05.039
only in capital circulates and the rest
is damage control then some of the kinds

00:20:05.039 --> 00:20:05.049
is damage control then some of the kinds
 

00:20:05.049 --> 00:20:06.749
is damage control then some of the kinds
of damage control that we do as

00:20:06.749 --> 00:20:06.759
of damage control that we do as
 

00:20:06.759 --> 00:20:08.850
of damage control that we do as
academics is more damage than anything

00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:08.860
academics is more damage than anything
 

00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:10.470
academics is more damage than anything
you know is it contributing to the

00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:10.480
you know is it contributing to the
 

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:13.529
you know is it contributing to the
damage so in rethinking our disciplines

00:20:13.529 --> 00:20:13.539
damage so in rethinking our disciplines
 

00:20:13.539 --> 00:20:15.930
damage so in rethinking our disciplines
I think that we would need to not fall

00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:15.940
I think that we would need to not fall
 

00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:17.970
I think that we would need to not fall
back on the post-war model of a kind of

00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:17.980
back on the post-war model of a kind of
 

00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:20.279
back on the post-war model of a kind of
extended multiculturalism you know which

00:20:20.279 --> 00:20:20.289
extended multiculturalism you know which
 

00:20:20.289 --> 00:20:21.660
extended multiculturalism you know which
is the

00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:21.670
is the
 

00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:23.700
is the
and I maybe that's a little bit what I

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:23.710
and I maybe that's a little bit what I
 

00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:25.110
and I maybe that's a little bit what I
was hearing on when you were saying I

00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:25.120
was hearing on when you were saying I
 

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:27.090
was hearing on when you were saying I
kind of we cannot be monoculture we have

00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:27.100
kind of we cannot be monoculture we have
 

00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:28.470
kind of we cannot be monoculture we have
that I don't omit item with that maybe I

00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:28.480
that I don't omit item with that maybe I
 

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:29.670
that I don't omit item with that maybe I
asked you the class like that i but i

00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:29.680
asked you the class like that i but i
 

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:33.020
asked you the class like that i but i
think we are on the same page on that

00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:33.030
think we are on the same page on that
 

00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:36.540
think we are on the same page on that
but I I think that we cannot do we

00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:36.550
but I I think that we cannot do we
 

00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:38.760
but I I think that we cannot do we
cannot follow the model of this kind of

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:38.770
cannot follow the model of this kind of
 

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:40.260
cannot follow the model of this kind of
extended multiculturalism and really

00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:40.270
extended multiculturalism and really
 

00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:41.610
extended multiculturalism and really
rethink ourselves in different terms I

00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:41.620
rethink ourselves in different terms I
 

00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:42.750
rethink ourselves in different terms I
don't know what those terms might be it

00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:42.760
don't know what those terms might be it
 

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:45.210
don't know what those terms might be it
might be the transnational although that

00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:45.220
might be the transnational although that
 

00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:49.680
might be the transnational although that
is a term that has its own history but I

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:49.690
is a term that has its own history but I
 

00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:51.840
is a term that has its own history but I
think the implications for pedagogy is

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:51.850
think the implications for pedagogy is
 

00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:53.940
think the implications for pedagogy is
that in teaching our classes we need to

00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:53.950
that in teaching our classes we need to
 

00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:56.340
that in teaching our classes we need to
really begin to break down certain

00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:56.350
really begin to break down certain
 

00:20:56.350 --> 00:20:58.170
really begin to break down certain
boundaries that have been created in the

00:20:58.170 --> 00:20:58.180
boundaries that have been created in the
 

00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:01.350
boundaries that have been created in the

problems so preservation was formed for

00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:03.640
problems so preservation was formed for
 

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:05.940
problems so preservation was formed for
example as an academic discipline as a

00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:05.950
example as an academic discipline as a
 

00:21:05.950 --> 00:21:08.460
example as an academic discipline as a
way to solve problems that are not

00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:08.470
way to solve problems that are not
 

00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:10.800
way to solve problems that are not
necessarily here anymore and so we're

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:10.810
necessarily here anymore and so we're
 

00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:12.540
necessarily here anymore and so we're
still kind of producing solutions to a

00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:12.550
still kind of producing solutions to a
 

00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:14.880
still kind of producing solutions to a
problem that is obsolete so we're

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:14.890
problem that is obsolete so we're
 

00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:16.620
problem that is obsolete so we're
creating the problem in order to solve

00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:16.630
creating the problem in order to solve
 

00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:20.670
creating the problem in order to solve
it in some ways and so to try to bring

00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:20.680
it in some ways and so to try to bring
 

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:23.160
it in some ways and so to try to bring
in I think we need to and I and it's

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:23.170
in I think we need to and I and it's
 

00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:24.570
in I think we need to and I and it's
hard to do that because people are

00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:24.580
hard to do that because people are
 

00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:26.430
hard to do that because people are
tenured and you know you you know how do

00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:26.440
tenured and you know you you know how do
 

00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:28.800
tenured and you know you you know how do
you bring in new people you know will

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:28.810
you bring in new people you know will
 

00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:32.910
you bring in new people you know will
add jumps our way to you know new new

00:21:32.910 --> 00:21:32.920
add jumps our way to you know new new
 

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:38.240
add jumps our way to you know new new
lines and so on but creating I think

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:38.250
lines and so on but creating I think
 

00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:41.100
lines and so on but creating I think
arrangements by virtue of which we can

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:41.110
arrangements by virtue of which we can
 

00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:44.820
arrangements by virtue of which we can
have access to to each other's knowledge

00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:44.830
have access to to each other's knowledge
 

00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:47.520
have access to to each other's knowledge
is important the first steps is our

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:47.530
is important the first steps is our
 

00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:49.200
is important the first steps is our
conferences like this where we actually

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:49.210
conferences like this where we actually
 

00:21:49.210 --> 00:21:50.880
conferences like this where we actually
sit down in a room and listen to what

00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:50.890
sit down in a room and listen to what
 

00:21:50.890 --> 00:21:53.280
sit down in a room and listen to what
other people are doing very rarely with

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:53.290
other people are doing very rarely with
 

00:21:53.290 --> 00:21:54.750
other people are doing very rarely with
somebody in preservation listen to

00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:54.760
somebody in preservation listen to
 

00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:56.880
somebody in preservation listen to
somebody in geography or anthropology

00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:56.890
somebody in geography or anthropology
 

00:21:56.890 --> 00:21:59.340
somebody in geography or anthropology
and likewise I think very rarely with an

00:21:59.340 --> 00:21:59.350
and likewise I think very rarely with an
 

00:21:59.350 --> 00:22:02.100
and likewise I think very rarely with an
anthropologist give a preservationist 20

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:02.110
anthropologist give a preservationist 20
 

00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:04.230
anthropologist give a preservationist 20
minutes of their time so this is you

00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:04.240
minutes of their time so this is you
 

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:05.790
minutes of their time so this is you
know already quite important I think the

00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:05.800
know already quite important I think the
 

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:09.030
know already quite important I think the
next step is to is to list it is to do

00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:09.040
next step is to is to list it is to do
 

00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:12.810
next step is to is to list it is to do
joint projects you know joint academic

00:22:12.810 --> 00:22:12.820
joint projects you know joint academic
 

00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:14.820
joint projects you know joint academic
projects joints to do projects in which

00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:14.830
projects joints to do projects in which
 

00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:18.450
projects joints to do projects in which
we challenge each other and it would

00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:18.460
we challenge each other and it would
 

00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:20.910
we challenge each other and it would
seem to me that that each of the papers

00:22:20.910 --> 00:22:20.920
seem to me that that each of the papers
 

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:21.730
seem to me that that each of the papers
that were

00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:21.740
that were
 

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:24.370
that were
were presented our lend themselves to be

00:22:24.370 --> 00:22:24.380
were presented our lend themselves to be
 

00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:27.190
were presented our lend themselves to be
really incredible academic exercise and

00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:27.200
really incredible academic exercise and
 

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:29.470
really incredible academic exercise and
we saw some already you know Rosetta

00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:29.480
we saw some already you know Rosetta
 

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:31.480
we saw some already you know Rosetta
Drita's project that that was an

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:31.490
Drita's project that that was an
 

00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:33.010
Drita's project that that was an
excellent one in which you know the

00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:33.020
excellent one in which you know the
 

00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:34.150
excellent one in which you know the
students were really beginning to

00:22:34.150 --> 00:22:34.160
students were really beginning to
 

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:38.020
students were really beginning to
confront these issues and I think maybe

00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:38.030
confront these issues and I think maybe
 

00:22:38.030 --> 00:22:40.540
confront these issues and I think maybe
the kind of larger theme there is also

00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:40.550
the kind of larger theme there is also
 

00:22:40.550 --> 00:22:42.130
the kind of larger theme there is also
what has happened to the public sphere

00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:42.140
what has happened to the public sphere
 

00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:44.080
what has happened to the public sphere
in terms of these questions you know

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:44.090
in terms of these questions you know
 

00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:48.490
in terms of these questions you know
because part of the issue that we talked

00:22:48.490 --> 00:22:48.500
because part of the issue that we talked
 

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:51.850
because part of the issue that we talked
about in thinking what role do cities

00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:51.860
about in thinking what role do cities
 

00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:54.010
about in thinking what role do cities
play in the public sphere what role do

00:22:54.010 --> 00:22:54.020
play in the public sphere what role do
 

00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:57.280
play in the public sphere what role do
the media networks play in the public

00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:57.290
the media networks play in the public
 

00:22:57.290 --> 00:23:00.040
the media networks play in the public
sphere what role does the internet plan

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:00.050
sphere what role does the internet plan
 

00:23:00.050 --> 00:23:03.760
sphere what role does the internet plan
the public sphere I think that you know

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:03.770
the public sphere I think that you know
 

00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:04.990
the public sphere I think that you know
I'm thinking back of hannah arendt

00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:05.000
I'm thinking back of hannah arendt
 

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.730
I'm thinking back of hannah arendt
notion of the public spheres are kind of

00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:06.740
notion of the public spheres are kind of
 

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:08.290
notion of the public spheres are kind of
based on speech acts and communication

00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:08.300
based on speech acts and communication
 

00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:11.410
based on speech acts and communication
you know how to I think a lot of what we

00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:11.420
you know how to I think a lot of what we
 

00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:13.780
you know how to I think a lot of what we
saw was a types of public spheres that

00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:13.790
saw was a types of public spheres that
 

00:23:13.790 --> 00:23:15.549
saw was a types of public spheres that
were not necessarily based on speech

00:23:15.549 --> 00:23:15.559
were not necessarily based on speech
 

00:23:15.559 --> 00:23:18.400
were not necessarily based on speech
acts that were based on performative

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:18.410
acts that were based on performative
 

00:23:18.410 --> 00:23:20.350
acts that were based on performative
actions and so on that worked it more

00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:20.360
actions and so on that worked it more
 

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:22.240
actions and so on that worked it more
difficult to analyze and more difficult

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:22.250
difficult to analyze and more difficult
 

00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:23.620
difficult to analyze and more difficult
to understand because nobody's

00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:23.630
to understand because nobody's
 

00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:25.270
to understand because nobody's
verbalizing them and so a lot of the

00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:28.070
task of the the intellectual work that
 

00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:31.450
task of the the intellectual work that
is happening here is to begin to be able

00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:31.460
is happening here is to begin to be able
 

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:36.030
is happening here is to begin to be able
to express that in a in a way that is

00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:36.040

00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:39.820
to express that in a in a way that is

00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:41.169
that helps us that are outside of those
practices in a sense we can to

00:23:41.169 --> 00:23:41.179
practices in a sense we can to
 

00:23:41.179 --> 00:23:42.160
practices in a sense we can to
understand them and see how they can

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:42.170
understand them and see how they can
 

00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:45.460
understand them and see how they can

different many permutations but I want
 

00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:56.850

getting round up or like targeted for
 

00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:43.440
getting round up or like targeted for
state repression because of where they

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:43.450
state repression because of where they
 

00:25:43.450 --> 00:25:46.260
state repression because of where they
come from or the language they speak or

like the racial profiling and so on so
 

00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:51.990
like the racial profiling and so on so
to me the answer to the question is are

00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:52.000
to me the answer to the question is are
 

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.960
to me the answer to the question is are
these terms irrelevant or not you know

00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:54.970
these terms irrelevant or not you know
 

00:25:54.970 --> 00:25:57.330
these terms irrelevant or not you know
well there's a way which they are very

00:25:57.330 --> 00:25:57.340
well there's a way which they are very
 

00:25:57.340 --> 00:25:59.580
well there's a way which they are very
relevant in terms of the politics of

00:25:59.580 --> 00:25:59.590
relevant in terms of the politics of
 

00:25:59.590 --> 00:26:03.540
relevant in terms of the politics of
language and and the way we label

00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:03.550
language and and the way we label
 

00:26:03.550 --> 00:26:06.600
language and and the way we label
certain populations so and that doesn't

00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:06.610
certain populations so and that doesn't
 

00:26:06.610 --> 00:26:09.480
certain populations so and that doesn't
take away from the individual aspect of

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:09.490
take away from the individual aspect of
 

00:26:09.490 --> 00:26:11.040
take away from the individual aspect of
like you know like there's is this of

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:11.050
like you know like there's is this of
 

00:26:11.050 --> 00:26:13.860
like you know like there's is this of
the stuff going on but it gets the point

00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:13.870
the stuff going on but it gets the point
 

00:26:13.870 --> 00:26:15.540
the stuff going on but it gets the point
of rains cloud on earlier which is

00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:15.550
of rains cloud on earlier which is
 

00:26:15.550 --> 00:26:17.310
of rains cloud on earlier which is
making their point it is both ways

00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:17.320
making their point it is both ways
 

00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:20.640
making their point it is both ways
there's a way in which this labels are

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:20.650
there's a way in which this labels are
 

00:26:20.650 --> 00:26:23.040
there's a way in which this labels are
not necessarily useful in accounting for

00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:23.050
not necessarily useful in accounting for
 

00:26:23.050 --> 00:26:24.810
not necessarily useful in accounting for
this other stuff but there's a way in

00:26:24.810 --> 00:26:24.820
this other stuff but there's a way in
 

00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:26.970
this other stuff but there's a way in
which we must understand the role of the

00:26:26.970 --> 00:26:26.980
which we must understand the role of the
 

00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:30.870
which we must understand the role of the
state in racial icing Latinos and now so

00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:30.880
state in racial icing Latinos and now so
 

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:32.700
state in racial icing Latinos and now so
which is for me that transition from

00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:32.710
which is for me that transition from
 

00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:37.320
which is for me that transition from
Latin America to Latinos it is mediated

00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:37.330
Latin America to Latinos it is mediated
 

00:26:37.330 --> 00:26:39.510
Latin America to Latinos it is mediated
by the state is to stay that racialized

00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:39.520
by the state is to stay that racialized
 

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:42.390
by the state is to stay that racialized
these populations by labeling them and

00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:42.400
these populations by labeling them and
 

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:45.210
these populations by labeling them and
targeted them both in terms of

00:26:45.210 --> 00:26:45.220
targeted them both in terms of
 

00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:49.190
targeted them both in terms of
repression and in terms of positive

00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:49.200
repression and in terms of positive
 

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:52.050
repression and in terms of positive
reinforcement and so on so I just want

00:26:52.050 --> 00:26:52.060
reinforcement and so on so I just want
 

00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:56.460
reinforcement and so on so I just want
to highlight the role of the state but i

00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:56.470
to highlight the role of the state but i
 

00:26:56.470 --> 00:26:58.590
to highlight the role of the state but i
also want to and and more importantly

00:26:58.590 --> 00:26:58.600
also want to and and more importantly
 

00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:02.040
also want to and and more importantly
for me it's the this conversation is

00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:02.050
for me it's the this conversation is
 

00:27:02.050 --> 00:27:03.630
for me it's the this conversation is
happening against the background of

00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:03.640
happening against the background of
 

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:05.460
happening against the background of
invisibility there's a way in which

00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:05.470
invisibility there's a way in which
 

00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:08.790
invisibility there's a way in which
latinos are very much invisible in the

00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:08.800
latinos are very much invisible in the
 

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:11.280

raised I think it would be great if we
 

00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:50.330
raised I think it would be great if we
had some more dialogue from new people I

00:30:50.330 --> 00:30:50.340
had some more dialogue from new people I

/ determinism yeah and I think that it

00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:28.530
/ determinism yeah and I think that it
 

00:31:28.530 --> 00:31:31.400
/ determinism yeah and I think that it
also touches on something that we were

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:31.410
also touches on something that we were
 

00:31:31.410 --> 00:31:35.150
also touches on something that we were
talking about with renee and this is the

00:31:35.150 --> 00:31:35.160
talking about with renee and this is the
 

00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:37.430
talking about with renee and this is the
question that applies for all of us who

question that applies for all of us who
 

00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:39.230
question that applies for all of us who
are trying to think about the programs

00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:39.240
are trying to think about the programs
 

00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:41.540
are trying to think about the programs
that have been discussed during today's

that have been discussed during today's
 

00:31:41.550 --> 00:31:45.470
that have been discussed during today's
here what are the theoretical frameworks

00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:45.480
here what are the theoretical frameworks
 

00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:48.800
here what are the theoretical frameworks
upon which we are trying to approach

00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:48.810
upon which we are trying to approach
 

00:31:48.810 --> 00:31:51.050
upon which we are trying to approach
these problems that i agree with Clara

these problems that i agree with Clara
 

00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:55.370

are almost the same that we keep phasing

are almost the same that we keep phasing

are almost the same that we keep phasing
and how can we make a call for a

and how can we make a call for a
 

00:32:01.530 --> 00:32:05.570
and how can we make a call for a
stronger theoretical reflection and I

00:32:05.570 --> 00:32:05.580
stronger theoretical reflection and I

let's say equitable political sphere
after that goal has been accomplished

00:37:23.650 --> 00:37:23.660
after that goal has been accomplished
 

00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:26.440
after that goal has been accomplished
and maybe rethink and move outside of

the strategic essentialism once that has
 

00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:31.480
the strategic essentialism once that has
been when once that particular goal has

00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:31.490
been when once that particular goal has
 

00:37:31.490 --> 00:37:33.910
been when once that particular goal has
been accomplished so I think that you

00:37:33.910 --> 00:37:33.920
been accomplished so I think that you
 

00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:38.800
been accomplished so I think that you
know some some let's say some some way

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:38.810
know some some let's say some some way
 

00:37:38.810 --> 00:37:41.620
know some some let's say some some way
some openings were made in that

00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:41.630
some openings were made in that
 

00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:44.530
some openings were made in that
direction what I think is also very

00:37:44.530 --> 00:37:44.540
direction what I think is also very
 

00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:45.520
direction what I think is also very
interesting about what you were saying

00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:45.530
interesting about what you were saying
 

00:37:45.530 --> 00:37:50.170
interesting about what you were saying
is that that's that strategic

00:37:50.170 --> 00:37:50.180
is that that's that strategic
 

00:37:50.180 --> 00:37:52.210
is that that's that strategic

the sometimes for the in the in the best
interest of a just society but that

00:37:59.500 --> 00:37:59.510
interest of a just society but that
 

00:37:59.510 --> 00:38:02.589
interest of a just society but that
sometimes the state simply essential

00:38:02.589 --> 00:38:02.599

eise's and racial eise's and those are

00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:06.410
eise's and racial eise's and those are
 

00:38:06.410 --> 00:38:08.680
eise's and racial eise's and those are
two different realities and two

00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:08.690
two different realities and two
 

00:38:08.690 --> 00:38:11.170
two different realities and two
different processes and somehow our role

00:38:11.170 --> 00:38:11.180
different processes and somehow our role
 

00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:13.359
different processes and somehow our role
is to begin to distinguish them and to

00:38:13.359 --> 00:38:13.369
is to begin to distinguish them and to
 

00:38:13.369 --> 00:38:17.210
is to begin to distinguish them and to
take them apart

00:38:17.210 --> 00:38:17.220
 
 

00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:21.160
 
well I think related to those comments

00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:21.170
well I think related to those comments
 

00:38:21.170 --> 00:38:24.260
well I think related to those comments
for those of when we're looking at the

00:38:24.260 --> 00:38:24.270
for those of when we're looking at the
 

00:38:24.270 --> 00:38:25.970
for those of when we're looking at the
policy professions whether they be

00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:25.980
policy professions whether they be
 

00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:28.070

planning the design professions historic

00:38:28.070 --> 00:38:28.080
planning the design professions historic
 

00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:31.250
planning the design professions historic
preservation etc I think the challenge

00:38:31.250 --> 00:38:31.260
preservation etc I think the challenge
 

00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:35.030
preservation etc I think the challenge
is to move from a management mindset to

00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:35.040
is to move from a management mindset to
 

00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:36.710
is to move from a management mindset to
more of a leadership might say in denim

00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:36.720
more of a leadership might say in denim
 

00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:38.450
more of a leadership might say in denim
but that I mean that the management

00:38:38.450 --> 00:38:38.460
but that I mean that the management
 

00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:40.070
but that I mean that the management
mindset is focused on managing

00:38:40.070 --> 00:38:40.080
mindset is focused on managing
 

00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:45.760
mindset is focused on managing
complexity and and that leads to the the

00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:45.770
complexity and and that leads to the the
 

00:38:45.770 --> 00:38:49.490
complexity and and that leads to the the
oversimplification of the other the the

00:38:49.490 --> 00:38:49.500
oversimplification of the other the the
 

00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:51.290
oversimplification of the other the the
leadership mindset is about managing

00:38:51.290 --> 00:38:51.300
leadership mindset is about managing
 

00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:57.280
leadership mindset is about managing
change and being open to to diversity is

00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:57.290
change and being open to to diversity is
 

00:38:57.290 --> 00:39:04.190
change and being open to to diversity is
being open to basically allowing for for

00:39:04.190 --> 00:39:04.200
being open to basically allowing for for
 

00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:06.950
being open to basically allowing for for
change to happen in letting that be okay

00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:06.960
change to happen in letting that be okay
 

00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:09.200
change to happen in letting that be okay
one of the things that we have as I

00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:09.210
one of the things that we have as I
 

00:39:09.210 --> 00:39:11.810
one of the things that we have as I
think one of the challenges in the

00:39:11.810 --> 00:39:11.820
think one of the challenges in the
 

00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:14.120
think one of the challenges in the
design professions is everything is so

00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:14.130
design professions is everything is so
 

00:39:14.130 --> 00:39:16.880
design professions is everything is so
programmed you know our focus is is on

00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:16.890
programmed you know our focus is is on
 

00:39:16.890 --> 00:39:18.790
programmed you know our focus is is on
programming uses whether it's in

programming uses whether it's in
 

00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:23.210
programming uses whether it's in
architectural what or economics and so

00:39:23.210 --> 00:39:23.220
architectural what or economics and so
 

00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:26.240
architectural what or economics and so
what we've seen in some examples that we

00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:26.250
what we've seen in some examples that we
 

00:39:26.250 --> 00:39:28.520
what we've seen in some examples that we
talked about is that you really can't

00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:28.530
talked about is that you really can't
 

00:39:28.530 --> 00:39:31.460
talked about is that you really can't
program uses that that the youth the

00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:31.470
program uses that that the youth the
 

00:39:31.470 --> 00:39:34.450
program uses that that the youth the
best uses grow organically but of course

00:39:34.450 --> 00:39:34.460
best uses grow organically but of course
 

00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:37.940
best uses grow organically but of course
the route the real politic here is you

00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:37.950
the route the real politic here is you

the route the real politic here is you
can't just say to elected officials well

00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:40.290
can't just say to elected officials well
 

00:39:40.290 --> 00:39:42.140
can't just say to elected officials well
let's just put it out there and see what

00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:42.150
let's just put it out there and see what
 

00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:45.349
let's just put it out there and see what
happens there has to be some direction

00:39:45.349 --> 00:39:45.359
happens there has to be some direction
 

00:39:45.359 --> 00:39:48.140
happens there has to be some direction
so that I think is the key challenge and

00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:48.150
so that I think is the key challenge and
 

00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:50.120
so that I think is the key challenge and
I agree that the only way it's going to

00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:50.130
I agree that the only way it's going to
 

00:39:50.130 --> 00:39:51.770
I agree that the only way it's going to
really happen is through an

00:39:51.770 --> 00:39:51.780
really happen is through an
 

00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:54.260
really happen is through an
interdisciplinary approach where people

00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:54.270
interdisciplinary approach where people
 

00:39:54.270 --> 00:39:55.490
interdisciplinary approach where people
from different professions are

00:39:55.490 --> 00:39:55.500
from different professions are
 

00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:59.270
from different professions are
challenged to think in different ways

00:39:59.270 --> 00:39:59.280
challenged to think in different ways
 

00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:03.470
challenged to think in different ways
about the same problems thank you I

00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:03.480
about the same problems thank you I
 

00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:06.500
about the same problems thank you I
think that we might be ready to move on

00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:06.510
think that we might be ready to move on
 

00:40:06.510 --> 00:40:09.930
think that we might be ready to move on
to a new question if there's one

00:40:09.930 --> 00:40:09.940
to a new question if there's one
 

00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:14.230
to a new question if there's one

passing me the microphone actually it's
 

00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:26.230
passing me the microphone actually it's
interesting to me to see that in order

00:40:26.230 --> 00:40:26.240
interesting to me to see that in order
 

00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:30.880
interesting to me to see that in order
to hear about Latin American I had to

00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:30.890
to hear about Latin American I had to
 

00:40:30.890 --> 00:40:34.510
to hear about Latin American I had to
take an international class so that

relates a little bit to your comment

00:40:36.310 --> 00:40:36.320
relates a little bit to your comment
 

00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:40.830
relates a little bit to your comment
about the day after so it's it's unreal

00:40:40.830 --> 00:40:40.840
about the day after so it's it's unreal
 

00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:43.990
about the day after so it's it's unreal
but my question is really why planners

00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:44.000
but my question is really why planners
 

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:48.790
but my question is really why planners
are not really more exposed to the real

00:40:48.790 --> 00:40:48.800
are not really more exposed to the real
 

00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:51.420
are not really more exposed to the real
life and it's a little bit I guess but

00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:51.430
life and it's a little bit I guess but
 

00:40:51.430 --> 00:40:55.300
life and it's a little bit I guess but
the professor gussain before we hear

00:40:55.300 --> 00:40:55.310
the professor gussain before we hear
 

00:40:55.310 --> 00:40:58.870
the professor gussain before we hear
about all these theories and everything

00:40:58.870 --> 00:40:58.880
about all these theories and everything
 

00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:01.210
about all these theories and everything
that that needs to be done and we know

00:41:01.210 --> 00:41:01.220
that that needs to be done and we know
 

00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:03.580
that that needs to be done and we know
what needs to be done but then when

00:41:03.580 --> 00:41:03.590
what needs to be done but then when
 

00:41:03.590 --> 00:41:06.130
what needs to be done but then when
immigration issues happen and people are

immigration issues happen and people are
 

00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:08.650
immigration issues happen and people are
on the streets marching and and the

on the streets marching and and the
 

00:41:08.660 --> 00:41:11.590
on the streets marching and and the
actual issues are out there why the

00:41:11.590 --> 00:41:11.600
actual issues are out there why the
 

00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:13.900
actual issues are out there why the
conversation is not really happening at

00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:13.910
conversation is not really happening at
 

00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:15.970
conversation is not really happening at
the municipal levels at the level where

00:41:15.970 --> 00:41:15.980
the municipal levels at the level where
 

00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:18.100
the municipal levels at the level where
people can be really educated and not

00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:18.110
people can be really educated and not

00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:35.100
 
just just what on the previous question

00:41:35.100 --> 00:41:35.110
just just what on the previous question
 

00:41:35.110 --> 00:41:39.410
just just what on the previous question
um I wonder to what extent we have

00:41:39.410 --> 00:41:39.420
um I wonder to what extent we have
 

00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:43.050
um I wonder to what extent we have
removed the politics out of our

00:41:43.050 --> 00:41:43.060
removed the politics out of our
 

00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:45.390
removed the politics out of our
professional practice and I'm

00:41:45.390 --> 00:41:45.400
professional practice and I'm
 

00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:47.300
professional practice and I'm

recognition we have moved to a

recognition we have moved to a
 

00:41:55.030 --> 00:42:00.000
recognition we have moved to a
technocratic domain that takes the

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:00.010
technocratic domain that takes the
 

00:42:00.010 --> 00:42:03.780
technocratic domain that takes the
politics out of our planning practices

00:42:03.780 --> 00:42:03.790
politics out of our planning practices
 

00:42:03.790 --> 00:42:06.900
politics out of our planning practices
and to what extent that it's even

00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:06.910

then this depolarization is not just in

00:43:11.700 --> 00:43:11.710
then this depolarization is not just in
 

00:43:11.710 --> 00:43:13.920
then this depolarization is not just in
a planning practice but to some extent

00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:13.930
a planning practice but to some extent
 

00:43:13.930 --> 00:43:17.190

it seems that to talk about

00:43:44.049 --> 00:43:44.059
it seems that to talk about
 

00:43:44.059 --> 00:43:47.289
it seems that to talk about
transnationalism we have talked most of

00:43:47.289 --> 00:43:47.299
transnationalism we have talked most of
 

00:43:47.299 --> 00:43:49.599
transnationalism we have talked most of
the time about local places like about

00:43:49.599 --> 00:43:49.609
the time about local places like about
 

00:43:49.609 --> 00:43:53.670
the time about local places like about
local case studies and somehow I had the

00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:53.680
local case studies and somehow I had the
 

00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:58.089
local case studies and somehow I had the
intuitive aim to have found about an

00:43:58.089 --> 00:43:58.099
intuitive aim to have found about an
 

00:43:58.099 --> 00:44:01.900
intuitive aim to have found about an
analysis that or to talk about policies

00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:01.910
analysis that or to talk about policies
 

00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:04.359
analysis that or to talk about policies
or advocacy that has to enact that has

00:44:04.359 --> 00:44:04.369
or advocacy that has to enact that has
 

00:44:04.369 --> 00:44:07.299
or advocacy that has to enact that has
to act in two places at the same time so

00:44:07.299 --> 00:44:07.309
to act in two places at the same time so
 

00:44:07.309 --> 00:44:10.420
to act in two places at the same time so
it's chance nationalize it because in

00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:10.430
it's chance nationalize it because in
 

00:44:10.430 --> 00:44:13.989
it's chance nationalize it because in
many of the cases seems that for a given

00:44:13.989 --> 00:44:13.999
many of the cases seems that for a given
 

00:44:13.999 --> 00:44:15.819
many of the cases seems that for a given
case study there should be something

00:44:15.819 --> 00:44:15.829
case study there should be something
 

00:44:15.829 --> 00:44:18.069
case study there should be something
done there so that is a kind of national

00:44:18.069 --> 00:44:18.079
done there so that is a kind of national
 

00:44:18.079 --> 00:44:21.579
done there so that is a kind of national
policy that acts transnationally in a

00:44:21.579 --> 00:44:21.589
policy that acts transnationally in a
 

00:44:21.589 --> 00:44:24.579
policy that acts transnationally in a
national territory and the idea of

00:44:24.579 --> 00:44:24.589
national territory and the idea of
 

00:44:24.589 --> 00:44:27.430
national territory and the idea of
acting transnationally and makes me

00:44:27.430 --> 00:44:27.440
acting transnationally and makes me
 

00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:29.979
acting transnationally and makes me
think that if it is possible to think

00:44:29.979 --> 00:44:29.989
think that if it is possible to think
 

00:44:29.989 --> 00:44:32.259
think that if it is possible to think
about trans national policy in planning

00:44:32.259 --> 00:44:32.269
about trans national policy in planning
 

00:44:32.269 --> 00:44:34.900
about trans national policy in planning
any feet if it is possible how would

00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:34.910
any feet if it is possible how would
 

00:44:34.910 --> 00:44:38.140
any feet if it is possible how would
that differ from international planning

00:44:38.140 --> 00:44:38.150
that differ from international planning
 

00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:41.739
that differ from international planning
policy I think we'll probably take a

00:44:41.739 --> 00:44:41.749
policy I think we'll probably take a
 

00:44:41.749 --> 00:44:43.660
policy I think we'll probably take a
moment to answer those questions for we

00:44:43.660 --> 00:44:43.670
moment to answer those questions for we
 

00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:45.700
moment to answer those questions for we
move on so probably let's start with the

00:44:45.700 --> 00:44:45.710
move on so probably let's start with the
 

00:44:45.710 --> 00:44:48.059
move on so probably let's start with the
first tuba theory and practice questions

00:44:48.059 --> 00:44:48.069
first tuba theory and practice questions
 

00:44:48.069 --> 00:44:50.079
first tuba theory and practice questions
whoever wants to answer than the minimum

00:44:50.079 --> 00:44:50.089
whoever wants to answer than the minimum
 

00:44:50.089 --> 00:44:57.880

move on to alejandros okay to have

00:44:57.880 --> 00:44:57.890
move on to alejandros okay to have
 

00:44:57.890 --> 00:45:03.279
move on to alejandros okay to have
something to say well you just ask the

something to say well you just ask the
 

00:45:03.289 --> 00:45:05.380
something to say well you just ask the
right question for me this is I face

00:45:05.380 --> 00:45:05.390
right question for me this is I face

this daily I teach in a university and I

00:45:11.099 --> 00:45:11.109
this daily I teach in a university and I
 

00:45:11.109 --> 00:45:14.019
this daily I teach in a university and I
feel that I'm surrounded by people who

00:45:14.019 --> 00:45:14.029
feel that I'm surrounded by people who
 

00:45:14.029 --> 00:45:18.009
feel that I'm surrounded by people who
use interdisciplinarity all the time and

00:45:18.009 --> 00:45:18.019
use interdisciplinarity all the time and
 

00:45:18.019 --> 00:45:21.009
use interdisciplinarity all the time and
talk about it but when I go out and do

00:45:21.009 --> 00:45:21.019
talk about it but when I go out and do
 

00:45:21.019 --> 00:45:22.809
talk about it but when I go out and do
it I'm the first to get hit over the

00:45:22.809 --> 00:45:22.819
it I'm the first to get hit over the
 

00:45:22.819 --> 00:45:27.069
it I'm the first to get hit over the
head okay secondly people also talk

00:45:27.069 --> 00:45:27.079
head okay secondly people also talk
 

00:45:27.079 --> 00:45:29.999
head okay secondly people also talk
about practice all the time and

00:45:29.999 --> 00:45:30.009
about practice all the time and
 

00:45:30.009 --> 00:45:33.160
about practice all the time and
integrating theory and practice and I go

00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:33.170
integrating theory and practice and I go
 

00:45:33.170 --> 00:45:38.099
integrating theory and practice and I go
out and do it and I pay for it so our

00:45:38.099 --> 00:45:38.109
out and do it and I pay for it so our
 

00:45:38.109 --> 00:45:39.190
out and do it and I pay for it so our

international what isn't international
 

00:46:27.770 --> 00:46:31.240
international what isn't international
and in New York City in the most

00:46:31.240 --> 00:46:31.250
and in New York City in the most
 

00:46:31.250 --> 00:46:34.170

powerful country in the world what isn't
 

00:46:34.180 --> 00:46:37.359
powerful country in the world what isn't
international and I think it goes back

00:46:37.359 --> 00:46:37.369
international and I think it goes back
 

00:46:37.369 --> 00:46:40.780
international and I think it goes back

different formations and I think I've
 

00:55:53.369 --> 00:55:54.979
different formations and I think I've
had very very different histories and

I'm really struck by this comment of the
 

00:55:57.299 --> 00:55:59.839
I'm really struck by this comment of the
dissolution of Latin American Studies

00:55:59.839 --> 00:55:59.849
dissolution of Latin American Studies
 

00:55:59.849 --> 00:56:01.939
dissolution of Latin American Studies
precisely at the time where you see more

00:56:01.939 --> 00:56:01.949
precisely at the time where you see more
 

00:56:01.949 --> 00:56:04.789
precisely at the time where you see more
queer critical theorists more people of

work that has been done and using that
 

00:56:12.689 --> 00:56:15.049
work that has been done and using that
from Latino Studies and really

00:56:15.049 --> 00:56:15.059
from Latino Studies and really
 

00:56:15.059 --> 00:56:16.609
from Latino Studies and really

now that this is dissolving right so

00:56:20.509 --> 00:56:20.519
now that this is dissolving right so
 

00:56:20.519 --> 00:56:22.759
now that this is dissolving right so
these kinds of articulations but I also

00:56:22.759 --> 00:56:22.769
these kinds of articulations but I also
 

00:56:22.769 --> 00:56:25.759
these kinds of articulations but I also
think that there's something about this

00:56:25.759 --> 00:56:25.769
think that there's something about this
 

00:56:25.769 --> 00:56:27.919
think that there's something about this
question that spills out into kind of

00:56:27.919 --> 00:56:27.929
question that spills out into kind of
 

00:56:27.929 --> 00:56:29.770
question that spills out into kind of
question of public space I mean I

00:56:29.770 --> 00:56:29.780
question of public space I mean I
 

00:56:29.780 --> 00:56:33.040
question of public space I mean I
think that the containment of knowledge

00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:33.050
think that the containment of knowledge
 

00:56:33.050 --> 00:56:35.230
think that the containment of knowledge
and I do see a reaction in disciplines

00:56:35.230 --> 00:56:35.240
and I do see a reaction in disciplines

and there's a real reactionary strand

00:56:39.880 --> 00:56:39.890
and there's a real reactionary strand
 

00:56:39.890 --> 00:56:42.580

thinking and engagement I think it's

00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:48.890
thinking and engagement I think it's
 

00:56:48.890 --> 00:56:50.350
thinking and engagement I think it's
analogous in some ways to this

00:56:50.350 --> 00:56:50.360
analogous in some ways to this
 

00:56:50.360 --> 00:56:53.680

heartened by the comment that I think we

00:56:55.510 --> 00:56:55.520
heartened by the comment that I think we
 

00:56:55.520 --> 00:56:58.120
heartened by the comment that I think we
will see and reaction to the dismantling

00:56:58.120 --> 00:56:58.130
will see and reaction to the dismantling
 

00:56:58.130 --> 00:57:01.180

movements that spill out and exceed and
 

00:57:07.790 --> 00:57:09.850
movements that spill out and exceed and
I think that's true of public space I

00:57:09.850 --> 00:57:09.860
I think that's true of public space I
 

00:57:09.860 --> 00:57:11.650
I think that's true of public space I
mean a lot of it the spaces of

00:57:11.650 --> 00:57:11.660
mean a lot of it the spaces of
 

00:57:11.660 --> 00:57:15.160
mean a lot of it the spaces of
segregation are they bleed in certain

00:57:15.160 --> 00:57:15.170
segregation are they bleed in certain
 

00:57:15.170 --> 00:57:17.650
segregation are they bleed in certain
places so it's not really I mean I'm

00:57:17.650 --> 00:57:17.660
places so it's not really I mean I'm
 

00:57:17.660 --> 00:57:20.440
places so it's not really I mean I'm
trying to call together this and think

00:57:20.440 --> 00:57:20.450
trying to call together this and think
 

00:57:20.450 --> 00:57:24.400
trying to call together this and think
through where we can actually learn from

00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:24.410
through where we can actually learn from
 

00:57:24.410 --> 00:57:26.620
through where we can actually learn from
the kind of questions and coupling of

00:57:26.620 --> 00:57:26.630
the kind of questions and coupling of
 

00:57:26.630 --> 00:57:29.200
the kind of questions and coupling of
knowledge and power the kind of

00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:29.210
knowledge and power the kind of
 

00:57:29.210 --> 00:57:31.870
knowledge and power the kind of
racialization practices that are you

00:57:31.870 --> 00:57:31.880
racialization practices that are you

and how this is somehow says something

00:57:38.050 --> 00:57:38.060
and how this is somehow says something
 

00:57:38.060 --> 00:57:40.470
and how this is somehow says something
about the work of planning and I guess

00:57:40.470 --> 00:57:40.480
about the work of planning and I guess
 

00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:43.690
about the work of planning and I guess
you know I think there's some overlap I

00:57:43.690 --> 00:57:43.700
you know I think there's some overlap I
 

00:57:43.700 --> 00:57:44.770
you know I think there's some overlap I
just don't know how to put it all

00:57:44.770 --> 00:57:44.780
just don't know how to put it all
 

00:57:44.780 --> 00:57:47.740
just don't know how to put it all
together thank you I'll take one more

00:57:47.740 --> 00:57:47.750
together thank you I'll take one more
 

00:57:47.750 --> 00:57:49.090
together thank you I'll take one more
and I think that's going to be our last

00:57:49.090 --> 00:57:49.100
and I think that's going to be our last
 

00:57:49.100 --> 00:57:52.270
and I think that's going to be our last
well I think just so briefly comment on

00:57:52.270 --> 00:57:52.280
well I think just so briefly comment on
 

00:57:52.280 --> 00:57:53.080
well I think just so briefly comment on
that I think there's an opportunity

00:57:53.080 --> 00:57:53.090
that I think there's an opportunity
 

00:57:53.090 --> 00:57:59.650
that I think there's an opportunity
there to do in the dissolution of Latino

00:57:59.650 --> 00:57:59.660
there to do in the dissolution of Latino
 

00:57:59.660 --> 00:58:05.550
there to do in the dissolution of Latino
Studies there might be an opportunity to

00:58:05.550 --> 00:58:05.560
 
 

00:58:05.560 --> 00:58:08.880
 
to create a different sort of

00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:08.890
to create a different sort of
 

00:58:08.890 --> 00:58:12.600
to create a different sort of
pedagogical reality within departments

00:58:12.600 --> 00:58:12.610
pedagogical reality within departments
 

00:58:12.610 --> 00:58:16.480
pedagogical reality within departments
that doesn't relegate Latino Studies to

00:58:16.480 --> 00:58:16.490
that doesn't relegate Latino Studies to
 

00:58:16.490 --> 00:58:18.160
that doesn't relegate Latino Studies to
one person because usually what happens

00:58:18.160 --> 00:58:18.170
one person because usually what happens
 

00:58:18.170 --> 00:58:20.740
one person because usually what happens

00:58:20.740 --> 00:58:20.750
is you know oh boy we're going to get
 

00:58:20.750 --> 00:58:23.320
is you know oh boy we're going to get
accredited and we really need to fill

00:58:23.320 --> 00:58:23.330
accredited and we really need to fill

know either what could be latina but I

00:58:29.830 --> 00:58:29.840
know either what could be latina but I

don't know that the planners have the

00:58:31.540 --> 00:58:31.550
don't know that the planners have the
 

00:58:31.550 --> 00:58:34.630
don't know that the planners have the
Latino check mark but but it's but it's

00:58:34.630 --> 00:58:34.640
Latino check mark but but it's but it's
 

00:58:34.640 --> 00:58:36.430

probably non-western
 

00:58:36.440 --> 00:58:39.069
probably non-western
I have a non-western check mark and then

00:58:39.069 --> 00:58:39.079
I have a non-western check mark and then
 

00:58:39.079 --> 00:58:41.020
I have a non-western check mark and then
it's a and then it's we need to hire

00:58:41.020 --> 00:58:41.030
it's a and then it's we need to hire
 

00:58:41.030 --> 00:58:43.660
it's a and then it's we need to hire
somebody in this line so immediately the

somebody in this line so immediately the
entire faculty gets kind of exempt from

entire faculty gets kind of exempt from
 

00:58:48.530 --> 00:58:52.120
entire faculty gets kind of exempt from
the need to actually think about the

the need to actually think about the
 

00:58:52.130 --> 00:58:54.940
the need to actually think about the
problem and to re-educate themselves and

problem and to re-educate themselves and
 

00:58:54.950 --> 00:58:57.130
problem and to re-educate themselves and
there's a kind of tokenism that takes

00:58:57.130 --> 00:58:57.140
there's a kind of tokenism that takes
 

00:58:57.140 --> 00:58:58.690
there's a kind of tokenism that takes
place you know this this is the

00:58:58.690 --> 00:58:58.700
place you know this this is the
 

00:58:58.700 --> 00:59:00.700
place you know this this is the
non-western person this is the Latino

Studies person or whatever so if there

00:59:04.270 --> 00:59:04.280
Studies person or whatever so if there
 

00:59:04.280 --> 00:59:08.680
Studies person or whatever so if there
is a kind of you know reorganization of

00:59:08.680 --> 00:59:08.690
is a kind of you know reorganization of
 

00:59:08.690 --> 00:59:10.630
is a kind of you know reorganization of
the University in the sense that the

00:59:10.630 --> 00:59:10.640
the University in the sense that the
 

00:59:10.640 --> 00:59:12.480
the University in the sense that the
certain departments are getting cut out

00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:12.490
certain departments are getting cut out
 

00:59:12.490 --> 00:59:15.010
certain departments are getting cut out
then you know it's an opportunity also

00:59:15.010 --> 00:59:15.020
then you know it's an opportunity also
 

00:59:15.020 --> 00:59:18.670
then you know it's an opportunity also
to make claims for the re-education of

00:59:18.670 --> 00:59:18.680
to make claims for the re-education of
 

00:59:18.680 --> 00:59:21.640
to make claims for the re-education of
you know entire faculties I mean because

00:59:21.640 --> 00:59:21.650
you know entire faculties I mean because
 

00:59:21.650 --> 00:59:23.559
you know entire faculties I mean because
ultimately that's what's at stake it

00:59:23.559 --> 00:59:23.569
ultimately that's what's at stake it
 

00:59:23.569 --> 00:59:25.120
ultimately that's what's at stake it
seems to me you know and so there would

00:59:25.120 --> 00:59:25.130
seems to me you know and so there would
 

00:59:25.130 --> 00:59:26.530
seems to me you know and so there would
have to be more teacher training

00:59:26.530 --> 00:59:26.540
have to be more teacher training
 

00:59:26.540 --> 00:59:30.250
have to be more teacher training
seminars conferences that deal with you

00:59:30.250 --> 00:59:30.260
seminars conferences that deal with you
 

00:59:30.260 --> 00:59:32.109
seminars conferences that deal with you
know how do you teach your subject in a

00:59:32.109 --> 00:59:32.119
know how do you teach your subject in a
 

00:59:32.119 --> 00:59:35.470
know how do you teach your subject in a
way that it incorporates you know some

00:59:35.470 --> 00:59:35.480
way that it incorporates you know some
 

00:59:35.480 --> 00:59:37.450
way that it incorporates you know some
of the theoretical contributions that

00:59:37.450 --> 00:59:37.460
of the theoretical contributions that
 

00:59:37.460 --> 00:59:40.780
of the theoretical contributions that
latino studies have made to the field so

00:59:40.780 --> 00:59:40.790
latino studies have made to the field so
 

00:59:40.790 --> 00:59:43.000
