00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.759
Start the day by sipping a cup of Maple Bacon
Coffee and capturing the world from your dog’s

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.410
point of view with Fetch - the GoPro dog harness.

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:11.880
But first please put on your pants…shirt.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.170
Because it’s episode 45 of LÜT.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.259
Let your lunch travel slimly and safely with
the Foodskin flexible lunchbox - that compactly

Purchase something to pig out on using funds
from a scented Belgian waffle coin purse.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.590
Or curb the cash and just carry cards with
the Decadent Minimalist One - a wallet made

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:42.010
out of a single piece of aluminum that securely
carries up to eight identification or credit

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.010
cards.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.670
Which you’ll probably need to pay for this
Ferrari carbon fibre chess set.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:47.670
Finger Hands.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.540
Feed your feet dessert with Shoe Bakery.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.390
Fancy confectionary footwear from ice cream
flats to pink cake wedges.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.830
If those don’t float your boat just float
tiny objects with sound.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.920
The Ultrasonic Levitation Machine is designed
to allow people to experiment with anti-gravity

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.170
fields created by sound.

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.710
So maybe we can someday have a hoverboard?

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.509
Visualize sound with Light Show Fountain Speakers
that are compatible with all USB-friendly

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:20.939

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.069
Change the color of your cleanliness by installing
glass shower tiles that feature distinct designs

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:27.569
depending on the temperature.

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:32.200
They appear black at room temperature and
color variations range from Northern Lights

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.310
to Tye-Dye.

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.170
Try to chew on chemistry by making your own
chewing gum.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.209

Being an adult is required when enjoying the
beer briefcase.

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.139
But to stay hydrated in the wild there’s
the Katadyn Pocket water filter built for

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:52.880
a lifetime of use thanks to a silver-impregnanted
ceramic filter.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.700
Use Reviveaphone to bring your phone back
from a watery death.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.789
Pour the solution into the pouch, power down
your phone, put it in there for 7 minutes

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:06.450
and it removes destructive mineral residue
on the motherboard - resurrecting your water-damaged

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.450
mobile.

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.810
Then charge it with sun power with the port
solar charger that has an integrated suction

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.690
cup allowing it to stick to any window.

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.950

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.540
Technology meets tailoring with the MTailor
app - that lets you customize every aspect

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.570
of your shirt from fabric and collar to cuff
style and then uses your mobile device’s

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:40.350
camera to measure you 20% more accurately
than a professional tailor.

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.150
Giving you perfect fitting custom shirts from
the comfort of your jellyfish chair.

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.980
Which you can sit back on and relax while
you stare at your six million digits of pi

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:50.980
poster.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.630
Finally, fly your giant 50 foot long solar
balloon in preparation for your World View

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:03.090

for only $75,000 per passenger - will float

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.150
you 100,000 feet from the ground.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.150
Y’know what?

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.340
A fall from that height and you just might
reach Terminal Velociraptor.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.320
And as always - thanks for watching!
