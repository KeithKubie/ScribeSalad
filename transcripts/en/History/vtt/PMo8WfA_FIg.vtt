Bladesmiths, welcome
to our strength test--

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:10.540
the whiskey barrel ring chop.

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.040
Now, I'm going to take
each of your knives,

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.120
and I'm going to beat them
repeatedly and viciously

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.500
into these whisky barrel rings.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.500
I don't really care what
your knives do to the rings.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.920
I want to see what the rings
are going to do to your knives.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.080
Rob, you're up first.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.000
Ready to go?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.580
Go for it.

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.080
[rock music playing]

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.920
[grunting]

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:41.920
It's still in one piece.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.880
Well, Rob, we took
a little damage.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.080
I mean, we're biting into
that ring quite well.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.540
But we did leave a
piece of it in the ring.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.080
But this is definitely
stronger than the steel

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.040
you made it from.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.710
Good job.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.210
Thank you.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:57.920
How you feeling now, Jason?

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.500
I'm interested to see
how mine will perform.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.830
We're all going to
find out together.

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.290
[rock music playing]

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.540

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.420
[grunting]

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.920
Good job.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.120
Thanks, man.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.460
Jason, very good
job on the blade.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.460
You've got a little
chipping and edge rolling,

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:23.880
but it's really not
much of anything

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.580
considering what I
just did to that ring.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.290
The one problem I
have is your handle.

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.420
It's very narrow and rounded.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.380
But overall, nicely done.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.290
Michael, you ready to go?

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.620
It's going to hurt
worse than hot sauce

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.790
watching you smash my baby.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.250

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.620

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.580
[grunting]

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.250
That hurt so bad.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:01.420
Congratulations, Michael.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.000
The blade held up well.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.080
[sighs]

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.460
We've got a little chipping.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.960
Got a couple little
spots that are missing.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.500
The other thing is if I
didn't have a glove on,

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.120
I'd be feeling these corners.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.920
But overall, nice job.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.960
Next up is the sharpness
test, a fan favorite--

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.670
the apple slice.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:19.330
Rob, you're up first.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.290
You ready?

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.420
See what's left, OK.

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.540
Yes.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.960
That's some clean
cuts right there.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.040
So Rob, where you have
an edge, it's very sharp.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.790
You can see it picked
up a lot of material

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.670
right there where the chip is.

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.210
And that last apple is standing.

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:46.620
I just ran out of the blade.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.040
It's cut halfway through.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.670
Good job.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.040
All right, Jason, you ready?

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.620
Yes, sir.

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.460
Oh, yeah, I knew you had that.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.750
It's a big carving knife.

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.580
The blade passed through
the apples nicely.

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.080
It cracked a couple
of them, but you

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.040
don't really see any
marks left by the tears

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.500
that are in this blade.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:22.880
It's a good cutter.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.500
Well done.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.330
All right, Michael, you ready?

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.580
Feeling saucy.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.420
[rock music playing]

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.420
Just catching that
last apple and cutting

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.750
that clean and that
thin a slice off of it

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.380
shows a really sharp blade.

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.460
Without the grinds going
all the way to the edge,

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:53.920
it's sort of pushing
its way through.

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.710
It's cutting 3/4 of the
way through the apple

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.620
and breaking it the rest of
the way, just wedging it open.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.580
It's that wedge shape
probably started

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:01.790
riding up on that lower edge--

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.210
Yep.

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:04.880
--and just climbed
up out of those apples.

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.420
But definitely a sharp knife.

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:07.080
Good job.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.710
Thank you.

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:11.620
Bladesmiths, the judges'
deliberation is complete.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.380
They've made a final decision.

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.420
It's time for one of you
bladesmiths to leave the forge.

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.580
Rob, your blade did
not make the cut.

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.750
Rob, you brought us a knife
that was beautifully designed

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.750
with an incredibly
comfortable handle,

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.500
which I really appreciate.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.250
Unfortunately, in
that strength test,

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.250
you left about an inch of your
blade in that barrel strap.

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.170
For that reason, we're
going to have to let you go.

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:39.580
[inaudible]

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.790
Rob, please
surrender your blade.

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.330
I came out to "Forged in
Fire" to prove to myself

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.620
that I can still do
this after the issues

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.120
I've had with my health.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.500
And I performed.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.290
It was very tough, but
I made it through it.

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:54.670
My family, you know,
they had pushed

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:56.330
me to come and try to do this.

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.960
I know they'll still
be proud of me.
