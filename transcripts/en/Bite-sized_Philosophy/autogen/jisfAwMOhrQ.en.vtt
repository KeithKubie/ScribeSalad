no such animal as that exists and that's
 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.560
no such animal as that exists and that's
actually incorrect an animal very much

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570
actually incorrect an animal very much
 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.230
actually incorrect an animal very much
animal very much like that exists it's

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:33.240
animal very much like that exists it's
 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.330
animal very much like that exists it's
just a superordinate low resolution

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340
just a superordinate low resolution
 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.730
just a superordinate low resolution
category it includes all those weird

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:37.740
category it includes all those weird
 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.590
category it includes all those weird
animals that might hurt you that are out

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600
animals that might hurt you that are out
 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.140
animals that might hurt you that are out
in the forest that's a useful category

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150
in the forest that's a useful category
 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.420
in the forest that's a useful category
weird animals that might hurt you and

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430
weird animals that might hurt you and
 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.000
weird animals that might hurt you and
that's a real category you know you

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010
that's a real category you know you
 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.400
that's a real category you know you
might say well there's differentiated

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410
might say well there's differentiated
 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.140
might say well there's differentiated
things within that category it's like

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150
things within that category it's like
 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.500
things within that category it's like
yeah every category has that nature it

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510
yeah every category has that nature it
 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.420
yeah every category has that nature it
can still be further differentiated

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430
can still be further differentiated
 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.480
can still be further differentiated
maybe not protons you know they can even

00:03:59.480 --> 00:03:59.490
maybe not protons you know they can even
 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:00.890
maybe not protons you know they can even
be differentiated with regards to

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900
be differentiated with regards to
 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.320
be differentiated with regards to
location at least so every category can

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330
location at least so every category can
 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.360
location at least so every category can
be further differentiated the question

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370
be further differentiated the question
 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:06.940
be further differentiated the question
is whether the category has some

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950
is whether the category has some
 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.080
is whether the category has some
functional utility or at least that's

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090
functional utility or at least that's
 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:10.880
functional utility or at least that's
one of its questions it's like that's

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890
one of its questions it's like that's
 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.180
one of its questions it's like that's
the thing to be afraid of
