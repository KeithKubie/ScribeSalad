1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.260
Nobody likes you.
No one likes you,
but you,
I have a,
you do survive pretty well.

2
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.460
You'd be better off being a half Alina.
What's a have Alina to peccary.

3
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.120
What's a peccary?
It's like your cousin to a pig.
What's a pig?

4
00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.020
You ever see that?
Hallelujah.
Doug lives,
you know Doug lives in Bisbee,
Arizona.

5
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.000
Stan hope.
Um,
who by the way,
I think it's so,
it's sold out,
but he's taping his,

6
00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:28.020
uh,
his next special in Vegas next month.
Oh,
nice.
Yeah.

7
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.470
In Vegas.
That's cool.

8
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.640
Where he lives in Bisbee like he basically that's there to have Lena.

9
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.250
He lives really close to the border.
Like I think he's the only,

10
00:00:35.251 --> 00:00:39.300
like six miles from the border or some crazy shit.
Um,
and um,

11
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.150
these things live in the wild,
out in the desert.
Right.

12
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.950
Fucking they're aggressive and they fucked up his neighbor's dog.

13
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.870
They killed his neighbor's dog.
No.
Yeah,
man,
the dog was out and the Havoline is,

14
00:00:51.871 --> 00:00:55.110
will flanking.
Look,
they'd get on both sides of it and they,
they uh,

15
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.370
hunting in a pack.
Yeah.
They hunt in the pack and they will attack a small dog

16
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.340
that thinks disgusting.
Gross.
That's,
that's like a giant rat.

17
00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.060
It looks like a giant rat.
Well,

18
00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.680
it does look so it looks like a pig fucked around.
Oh,
somebody shot in the face.

19
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.720
Crossbow.
People hunt them all the time.
It looks like a pig.
Fucked a rat.
I see.

20
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.690
That got shot.
One where it does look like a pig.
Fucked around.

21
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.490
Click on the guy who shot one.
Yeah.
Bow and Arrow.

22
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.190
A lot of guys a hunt them with archery equipment.
See,

23
00:01:26.191 --> 00:01:29.580
wouldn't it be better if he was dressed in like a coat with a tie?

24
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:30.890
None of those boots.
No,

25
00:01:30.891 --> 00:01:34.910
because you don't want that thing to see you look at that.
That's a rat face.
Oh,

26
00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.840
that is not a giant body scroll.

27
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.300
Scroll back to that last one and make it bigger again.
Yeah.

28
00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.820
That guy is hunting rats teeth.

29
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.740
That's like a slightly different looking rat.
Oh,

30
00:01:49.741 --> 00:01:53.670
you want to know what's really crazy rat.
That's a hundred pound rat.
Yeah.

31
00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.350
Without a tail.
That's so gross.

32
00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.910
And you know what's really crazy is those animals,
um,
they'll,

33
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.770
they're the best animal to a call.
Now what a call is,

34
00:02:04.771 --> 00:02:09.490
is like you'd made us make a sound of a wounded animal.
No,
you make like,

35
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.620
like something that's stopped suffering.
Like people take their hand,

36
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.660
these fuckers run in,
they run in.
Yes.

37
00:02:24.661 --> 00:02:27.810
There's so aggressive.
It's crazy watching.
Something's hurting.

38
00:02:27.811 --> 00:02:31.260
I can go eat it but they have to act quick cause there's coyotes out there and

39
00:02:31.261 --> 00:02:32.190
mountain lions out there.

40
00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.420
So when something's hurting here like fuck food and they just run towards it.

41
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.340
So when your bow hunting,

42
00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.960
you almost have to have one person make the call and you're at full draw and

43
00:02:42.961 --> 00:02:46.260
then they start calling and the things come running in and you shoot at him.

44
00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.900
Yeah.
Cause you couldn't do it.

45
00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.840
You couldn't get to the boat for a long time cause they'd see you and they go

46
00:02:51.841 --> 00:02:55.710
fuck it.
The guy turn off the other way again.
Yeah.

47
00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.400
Are these like invasive or are they all over his property?
No,
they're natural.

48
00:03:00.401 --> 00:03:03.280
They're nobody.
I mean are they not invasive?
But I mean,
is there a lot of them?

49
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.820
Yes.
There's like a ton of ram where he lives exist.
Yeah.

50
00:03:06.821 --> 00:03:08.420
I mean they exist in the desert.
I mean they,

51
00:03:08.421 --> 00:03:12.160
they exist and healthy enough populations that you,
people hunt for them.
Wow.

52
00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.200
And they eat them.
They say it takes you.
Yeah.
That was neat.
That you eed to pig.

53
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.390
Yeah,
but they're cuter.
Wild boar.
Yeah.
Crazy tusks looking.
Yeah,

54
00:03:22.391 --> 00:03:26.560
those are gross too.
Pretty gross to my pigs.
My cakes.
I believe this.

55
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.390
The ones I eat have bow ties around this guy's garage and little tap shoes.

56
00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:35.650
Sometimes I hat I do this shit down,
Bro.

57
00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:39.160
They're staring him down there in his garage.
There's a whole bunch of them.
Fuck.

58
00:03:39.161 --> 00:03:41.800
Is that all right on your kid's toy?
Look at is.

59
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.370
It's all it's hair's up in any way.
Look at that.

60
00:03:45.371 --> 00:03:47.470
Just going to take a dump in your driveway.

61
00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.530
Who'd you do not want that in your life?
I don't want to live there.

62
00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.770
There's fucking 20 of them in this guy's driveway.

63
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.600
See that one there in the back.
How to grow that back again.
How many were there?

64
00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.210
There was like 12 what is the name of that video for?

65
00:04:01.211 --> 00:04:05.590
People want to watch it wild.
Have Belina's make a visit to Arizona home.

66
00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.640
Why?
Yeah,
no,
no,
no.
I know you can't show it though.

67
00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.200
Those fucking things are everywhere.
There's a lot of them with the wild,

68
00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.160
many of them,
they're off seven,
eight at least.
At least eight.

69
00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.680
And then there's the one that was on top of the,

70
00:04:20.681 --> 00:04:23.530
there's nine and then there's one that was on top of the truck and there was one

71
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.450
that you could see through the fence.
Yeah.

72
00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.630
And there's probably more out there to what's going on in the car.

73
00:04:28.631 --> 00:04:31.090
It's going into the kids.
A little car.
Jesus Christ.

74
00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:36.100
It's in the passenger seat of the car.
Oh,
gross.

75
00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.540
Fucking creeps like wild have.
Alina is like a Dean Martin Song.
You think so?

76
00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:44.950
Look over there.
Look.
Oh Man.

77
00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.850
They're weird looking too.
They look like they're demons.

78
00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:51.970
I don't like them at all.
The little beady eyes like they're up to no good.

79
00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.450
But if you were a little kid,
you thinking like,

80
00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.260
I wouldn't live there because that's there.
But if you live in New York,

81
00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.400
if you at night,
who knows what's climbing all around your building,
right.

82
00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:09.010
Could be eagles and shit.
Right.
So if you're talking about,
oh,
Google,

83
00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:14.110
hide around,
get into my house in a Google.
Have Alina eats baby.

84
00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.920
Let's see if that's ever happened.
Yeah.
Human Baby.

85
00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.920
Let's see if that happened.
What do you think if I have Alina eight.
A human.
Yeah.

86
00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.450
Like do you see those fucking things?
20 in that guy's drought.

87
00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.210
They've definitely gotten babies.
I'm exaggerating.

88
00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:29.080
Wasn't 20 someone's eating a baby right now.

89
00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:33.640
Probably 13 it was probably 12 Baker's dozen.
Baker's does have Evalina.

90
00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:38.890
Yeah,
they would eat a baby.
A toddler.
Yeah.
Knock it down.
I mean,

91
00:05:38.891 --> 00:05:40.660
if they eat a dog,
yeah,

92
00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:42.970
they're scared of people obviously weren't scared of that dude.

93
00:05:42.971 --> 00:05:45.550
Now that's a full brown person and the baby doesn't happen.

94
00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:50.350
It doesn't have anything.
I know.
I put it the hair up spikes up to let you know.

95
00:05:50.351 --> 00:05:55.270
It's threatened to ever tell you the story.
When I pulled a rat out of my,

96
00:05:55.271 --> 00:05:57.780
uh,
pool vacuum.
Yeah.

97
00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:04.670
Was it alive?
No.
Did Stink.
It had,

98
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:08.590
it stunk.
I'm like,
why isn't the vacuum working?
Did you think about it?

99
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:13.160
I dove in and I pulled it up and there was a half a rat.

100
00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:15.080
It's asked,
sticking out the vacuum,

101
00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:19.520
and as soon as I got it above the water flies,
just

102
00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.200
pull it out without it.
There's a question king,

103
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:27.650
where the fuck are the flies before the shit?
Good question.

104
00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:32.180
Where are the fuck are they all over there?
Not that many.
Like if you,

105
00:06:32.181 --> 00:06:36.260
if you are around by a person's backyard.
Yeah.

106
00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:40.040
How often do you see flies?
Every now and then.
This one,
it's kind of annoying,

107
00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:42.350
but if you just pulled your pants down,
shat on the ground,

108
00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:46.010
it would be flies on that within a matter of moments.
Oh,

109
00:06:46.011 --> 00:06:50.150
you mean right after I swam you swam shaft right on their law.

110
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:53.540
I mean you're after swim shit.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And then all of a sudden they show up.

111
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:57.050
Yeah.
It's disgusting and it happened so fast.
So gross.

112
00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:01.310
All of a sudden they're all waiting.
Yeah.
Where'd you guys come from?

113
00:07:01.311 --> 00:07:05.990
We should just stay inside.
Did you find a baby death from us?

114
00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:07.970
Have Alina.
A couple of months ago,

115
00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:11.330
it's a couple people in Arizona were attacked and they had like old woman was

116
00:07:11.331 --> 00:07:13.970
bit while she was walking her dog and another guy was bit while he was feeding

117
00:07:13.971 --> 00:07:16.070
them and he didn't feed it fast enough and it met them.

118
00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:19.610
That's about as much as I could.
Fine.
Well the lady who got bit,

119
00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:23.150
that's the scary one because the guy who fed them was an asshole.

120
00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:25.040
Right.

121
00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:29.360
This Gary one through there was a lady got bit by a coyote recently in Dallas

122
00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:31.490
though.
Yeah,
no.
Yeah it was around the Dallas area.

123
00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:34.640
I think they think that this is one coyote that's been biting people.

124
00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:39.920
It's a rogue unusual coyote snapping at people who freely.

125
00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:43.550
Yeah,
they had bite marks on their legs.
Oh my God,
that's gross man.

126
00:07:43.551 --> 00:07:47.030
Cause they will kill you if they would kill you.
They're just small.

127
00:07:47.031 --> 00:07:51.470
They're just not sure if it's worth the effort and you're around people and

128
00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:55.380
they're worried that you know one on one cause you fight off a coyote man.

129
00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:59.090
I mean I think you probably could if you had to,
but they'll fuck you up man.

130
00:07:59.091 --> 00:08:02.420
Just keep biting.
There's a few of them.
That's where the real problem comes.

131
00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:05.570
If they bite you in the right spot.
Yeah man,
the rip your tendons apart.

132
00:08:05.571 --> 00:08:07.920
You won't be able to run away.
They know what they're doing to

133
00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:13.160
try to take your legs out and they know what they're doing.

134
00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:15.230
They're not going to try to jump up and bite you in the neck.

135
00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:18.080
They're going to try and take your,
your hamstrings out,
right?
Yeah.

136
00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:21.350
Trying to rip your legs apart so you can't run.
Why are they so mean?

137
00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:26.410
That's how they're alive.
You're not leaving any food out for him or you know,

138
00:08:26.411 --> 00:08:28.730
you've got to do what they gotta do.
It's called domestication.

139
00:08:28.731 --> 00:08:32.990
That's how we have dogs.
Do you ever take your family camping?
I have not.
Yeah,

140
00:08:32.991 --> 00:08:34.490
I haven't either.
I would though.

141
00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:40.360
I wanted to take my kids to Yosemite cause I love Yosemite to bring a peace sign

142
00:08:40.821 --> 00:08:43.850
arm.
Nothing.
Nothing just went solo.
We weren't camping.

143
00:08:43.851 --> 00:08:47.390
We were staying in it and we're staying in.
And then what about emergency food?

144
00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:51.710
No satellite phone.
Nothing.
Just a phone.
First Aid kit.
Nothing.

145
00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:56.010
A bag of Funyuns and an iPhone.

146
00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:59.940
That's all I need and I want to show them Yosemite cause it's such a great part

147
00:08:59.941 --> 00:09:00.930
of my life.
I love it.

148
00:09:00.931 --> 00:09:03.690
I've been lived in the back country for like a week at a time.

149
00:09:03.691 --> 00:09:07.770
I just love the whole thing and I telling them about it and I'm building it up.

150
00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:12.000
They were like,
you know,
begrudgingly going.
They're all vegetarians.

151
00:09:12.001 --> 00:09:14.310
They just love nature.
They just love whatever.
So I'm like,

152
00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:17.400
you're going to love Yosemite.
As soon as we drove into the park,

153
00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:20.730
welcome to Yosemite.
I ran over a squirrel.

154
00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:28.620
The horror inside the car.
Dad,
you didn't even slow down.

155
00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:32.790
What's row?
You're a monster.
I'm like,
I can't.
It's two lanes.

156
00:09:32.791 --> 00:09:37.050
There's a guy behind me.
A guy in front,
I guess would steamroll the squirrel.

157
00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:42.120
They were,
oh,
they were in the whole weekend.
Anytime.
I'd be like,
look at this.

158
00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:45.300
Look at this beautiful view.
You killed a squirrel.

159
00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:50.460
You didn't even care.
That's the weird part.
Dang.
You didn't even care.

160
00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:54.660
Is that what they're saying?
Yeah,
we were supposed to cry.
I was just laughing.

161
00:09:55.650 --> 00:10:00.300
Yeah,
exactly.
That's wanting to be killed.
A deer.
You'd be Saturday,
right?

162
00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:04.710
Yeah.
God dammit.
Can't believe that.
I can't believe how beautiful.

163
00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:10.440
She was so nice with their little lies and the little tail.
This girl peccary.

164
00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:15.000
Yeah.
If you kill them Havalinas like you have to fucking rat thing.

165
00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:19.170
I find it's mom that have Alina would ruin your arch to bite your teeth.

166
00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:21.720
Could probably use its teeth to tear your tires apart.

167
00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:24.930
Then you missed talking the side of the road,
trying to change the tire.

168
00:10:24.931 --> 00:10:27.780
You turn around,
there's a whole pack of them closing in on you.

169
00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:32.300
Would you not take your family because of all of this van?

170
00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:33.990
Do you not want them in the woods with you?

171
00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:37.350
What am I a danger in the woods or become a werewolf?
What the fuck?

172
00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:43.650
He just got to snap Internet.
Trust me.
I'll be right back.

173
00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:45.990
Not that you're the threat,
Ron,

174
00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:49.980
that you'd have to protect them from all the threats.
Well,
I mean,

175
00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:55.070
Yosemite doesn't have that many threats other than people bears black bears then

176
00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.630
yeah.
Most of mountain lions,
mountain lions are an issue.

177
00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:05.760
There's always something out there.
Yeah.
Grizzly bears or you're just,

178
00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:08.730
you're just don't feel like that's a cause.
You like going out into nature.

179
00:11:08.731 --> 00:11:10.880
You go to the toilet stuff.
I do like going into nature.

180
00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:15.810
I also like being indoors,
like sleeping in a place where it's awesome to sleep.

181
00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:21.260
People wiser than may have figured out that that maneuver is called a bed with a

182
00:11:21.271 --> 00:11:25.830
roof and a locked door and a refrigerator.
You fucking cave person.

183
00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:29.220
Oh,
I'm going to rough it.
I'm going to sleep on the ground.
You don't have to,

184
00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.440
did you know that sleep in a house.
