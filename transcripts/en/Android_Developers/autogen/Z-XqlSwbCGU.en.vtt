bites recently talking about
anticipation and overshoot principles

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190
anticipation and overshoot principles
 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.890
anticipation and overshoot principles
from cartoon animation that could be

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900
from cartoon animation that could be
 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.599
from cartoon animation that could be
applied to some user interfaces as well

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609
applied to some user interfaces as well
 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.929
applied to some user interfaces as well
we also talked about this in our google

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939
we also talked about this in our google

information on some of these principles

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980
information on some of these principles
 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.620
information on some of these principles
but I wanted to go a little bit further

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630
but I wanted to go a little bit further
 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.930
but I wanted to go a little bit further
into these principles of anticipation

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940
into these principles of anticipation
 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.389
into these principles of anticipation
overshoot today in a different demo so

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399
overshoot today in a different demo so
 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.530
overshoot today in a different demo so
let's take a look so as I click on the

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540
let's take a look so as I click on the
 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.180
let's take a look so as I click on the
button you'll notice a couple of things

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190
button you'll notice a couple of things
 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.420
button you'll notice a couple of things
one is it reacts to my press itself and

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430
one is it reacts to my press itself and
 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.790
one is it reacts to my press itself and
then as I let go of the button then it

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800
then as I let go of the button then it
 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.200
then as I let go of the button then it
springs over to the other side of the

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210
springs over to the other side of the
 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.110
springs over to the other side of the
screen so press sort of skews over to

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120
screen so press sort of skews over to
 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.910
screen so press sort of skews over to
the left and then shoots over to the

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920
the left and then shoots over to the
 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.040
the left and then shoots over to the
right and then wobbles a bit to settle

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050
right and then wobbles a bit to settle
 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.970
right and then wobbles a bit to settle
down into place so that's the demo

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980
down into place so that's the demo
 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.950
down into place so that's the demo
pretty awesome let's take a look at the

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960
pretty awesome let's take a look at the
 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.500
pretty awesome let's take a look at the
code so first of all we want to figure

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510
code so first of all we want to figure
 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.880
code so first of all we want to figure
out how to actually draw something like

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890
out how to actually draw something like
 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.370
out how to actually draw something like
this you there is no skew property there

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380
this you there is no skew property there
 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.170
this you there is no skew property there
is no wobble and wiggle property on a

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180
is no wobble and wiggle property on a
 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.359
is no wobble and wiggle property on a
view so we need to do this manually by

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369
view so we need to do this manually by
 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.550
view so we need to do this manually by
altering the canvas of a view so you

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560
altering the canvas of a view so you
 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.280
altering the canvas of a view so you
don't typically over I draw and if you

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290
don't typically over I draw and if you
 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.380
don't typically over I draw and if you
do very important you have to call super

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390
do very important you have to call super
 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.749
do very important you have to call super
draw because we do things internally the

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759
draw because we do things internally the
 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.730
draw because we do things internally the
track flags and state that you should

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740
track flags and state that you should
 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.609
track flags and state that you should
not skip okay having said that it's okay

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619
not skip okay having said that it's okay
 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.380
not skip okay having said that it's okay
to override draw and in some cases you

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390
to override draw and in some cases you
 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.149
to override draw and in some cases you
have to in particular in this case I

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159
have to in particular in this case I
 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.160
have to in particular in this case I
want to change the way the view is

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170
want to change the way the view is
 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.810
want to change the way the view is
actually drawn so I need to alter the

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820
actually drawn so I need to alter the
 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.670
actually drawn so I need to alter the
canvas that it's drawn with so the way

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680
canvas that it's drawn with so the way
 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.649
canvas that it's drawn with so the way
you do that is by overriding draw and

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659
you do that is by overriding draw and
 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.990
you do that is by overriding draw and
then altering the canvas and passing

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000
then altering the canvas and passing
 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.969
then altering the canvas and passing
that up to the superclass so when there

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979
that up to the superclass so when there
 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.039
that up to the superclass so when there
is this skew value which is going to be

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049
is this skew value which is going to be
 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.920
is this skew value which is going to be
animated or change between 0 &amp; 1 then

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930
animated or change between 0 &amp; 1 then
 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.830
animated or change between 0 &amp; 1 then
we're going to change the cannabis

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840
we're going to change the cannabis
 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.660
we're going to change the cannabis
itself we're going to translate around

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670
itself we're going to translate around
 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.330
itself we're going to translate around
here which is basically only set the

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340
here which is basically only set the
 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.999
here which is basically only set the
right look the the rights center around

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009
right look the the rights center around
 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.679
right look the the rights center around
which we're actually doing do the skew

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689
which we're actually doing do the skew
 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.039
which we're actually doing do the skew
then we're going to skew the object to

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049
then we're going to skew the object to
 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.600
then we're going to skew the object to
sort of give it this shifted to the

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610
sort of give it this shifted to the
 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.680
sort of give it this shifted to the
light right or the left

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690
light right or the left
 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.780
light right or the left
look and then we're going to call super

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790
look and then we're going to call super
 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.190
look and then we're going to call super
draw and just say okay now draw your

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200
draw and just say okay now draw your
 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.690
draw and just say okay now draw your
button now that I've completely mucked

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700
button now that I've completely mucked
 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.070
button now that I've completely mucked
with your canvas go ahead and draw

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080
with your canvas go ahead and draw
 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.480
with your canvas go ahead and draw
meanwhile here's how one of the

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490
meanwhile here's how one of the
 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.370
meanwhile here's how one of the
animations work so run press annum gets

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380
animations work so run press annum gets
 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.170
animations work so run press annum gets
called when we actually press down on

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180
called when we actually press down on
 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.780
called when we actually press down on
the button and that works by using an

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790
the button and that works by using an
 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.670
the button and that works by using an
object animator which is going to

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680
object animator which is going to
 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.470
object animator which is going to
animate this property called skew X on

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480
animate this property called skew X on
 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.140
animate this property called skew X on
this object so I've defined a property

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150
this object so I've defined a property
 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.480
this object so I've defined a property
setter called sets QX and I can use an

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490
setter called sets QX and I can use an
 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.250
setter called sets QX and I can use an
object animator to animate that

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260
object animator to animate that
 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.410
object animator to animate that
arbitrary property on my object and I'm

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420
arbitrary property on my object and I'm
 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.240
arbitrary property on my object and I'm
going to animate it between point 5 and

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250
going to animate it between point 5 and
 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.370
going to animate it between point 5 and
negative point five and i'm going to set

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380
negative point five and i'm going to set
 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.860
negative point five and i'm going to set
a particular duration for that thing and

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870
a particular duration for that thing and
 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.990
a particular duration for that thing and
so it's going to be awfully long as it

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000
so it's going to be awfully long as it
 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.060
so it's going to be awfully long as it
rears back and this is the anticipation

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070
rears back and this is the anticipation
 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:46.830
rears back and this is the anticipation
element of this animation is that it's

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840
element of this animation is that it's
 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.600
element of this animation is that it's
going to rear back before moving forward

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610
going to rear back before moving forward
 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.040
going to rear back before moving forward
you think you can think of this button

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050
you think you can think of this button
 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.020
you think you can think of this button
is one of those old cartoon characters

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030
is one of those old cartoon characters
 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.760
is one of those old cartoon characters
it's going to run forward but before

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770
it's going to run forward but before
 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.620
it's going to run forward but before
they do that they're going to rear back

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630
they do that they're going to rear back
 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.630
they do that they're going to rear back
so that it get all position and ready to

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640
so that it get all position and ready to
 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.040
so that it get all position and ready to
do it that's effectively what I wanted

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050
do it that's effectively what I wanted
 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:00.690
do it that's effectively what I wanted
the button to do here and then i'm going

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700
the button to do here and then i'm going
 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.220
the button to do here and then i'm going
to set interpolator so it starts very

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230
to set interpolator so it starts very
 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:03.330
to set interpolator so it starts very
fast I'm going to click on the button

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340
fast I'm going to click on the button
 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.250
fast I'm going to click on the button
it's going to quickly start into the

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260
it's going to quickly start into the
 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.930
it's going to quickly start into the
animation and then slow down as it gets

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940
animation and then slow down as it gets
 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.729
animation and then slow down as it gets
to the insert giving that tension feel

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739
to the insert giving that tension feel
 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:11.430
to the insert giving that tension feel
as it gets to its its extreme point and

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440
as it gets to its its extreme point and
 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.830
as it gets to its its extreme point and
then we start the animation if we look

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840
then we start the animation if we look
 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.260
then we start the animation if we look
at the motion handler so I handle touch

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270
at the motion handler so I handle touch
 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.630
at the motion handler so I handle touch
events directly here because I want to

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640
events directly here because I want to
 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:19.920
events directly here because I want to
know when I'm inside and outside the

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930
know when I'm inside and outside the
 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.690
know when I'm inside and outside the
button so that I can disable the

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700
button so that I can disable the
 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.250
button so that I can disable the
animation if they unclick when it's

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260
animation if they unclick when it's
 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.600
animation if they unclick when it's
outside all that stuff and I also wanted

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610
outside all that stuff and I also wanted
 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.250
outside all that stuff and I also wanted
to handle the the perform press

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260
to handle the the perform press
 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.509
to handle the the perform press
operation and I want to handle the up

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519
operation and I want to handle the up
 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:35.009
operation and I want to handle the up
animation so when they've actually

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019
animation so when they've actually
 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:37.530
animation so when they've actually
pressed then we perform our click

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540
pressed then we perform our click
 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.120
pressed then we perform our click
animation and the cliq animation is

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130
animation and the cliq animation is
 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.270
animation and the cliq animation is
going to animate across the screen and

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280
going to animate across the screen and
 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.540
going to animate across the screen and
then it's going to animate the skew to

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:45.550
then it's going to animate the skew to
 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:46.860
then it's going to animate the skew to
the other side this is this is an

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870
the other side this is this is an
 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.690
the other side this is this is an
overshoot element where I want it to

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700
overshoot element where I want it to
 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.520
overshoot element where I want it to
stop suddenly but if it's an organic

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530
stop suddenly but if it's an organic
 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.380
stop suddenly but if it's an organic
element like this sort of skew II

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390
element like this sort of skew II
 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.330
element like this sort of skew II
squishy button that I've defined then

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340
squishy button that I've defined then
 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.860
squishy button that I've defined then
all of it can't stop at the same time

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870
all of it can't stop at the same time
 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.630
all of it can't stop at the same time
because that's very unnatural instead

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640
because that's very unnatural instead
 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.220
because that's very unnatural instead
you're going to stop the button and then

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230
you're going to stop the button and then
 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.320
you're going to stop the button and then
part of its going to carry on because

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330
part of its going to carry on because
 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.680
part of its going to carry on because
that's what gravity and inertia and

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690
that's what gravity and inertia and
 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.750
that's what gravity and inertia and
motion does to our bodies right so the

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760
motion does to our bodies right so the
 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.430
motion does to our bodies right so the
bottom of its going to stop and the top

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440
bottom of its going to stop and the top
 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.229
bottom of its going to stop and the top
is going to carry on and then it's going

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239
is going to carry on and then it's going
 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:11.520
is going to carry on and then it's going
to wiggle back and forth so it's going

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530
to wiggle back and forth so it's going
 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.590
to wiggle back and forth so it's going
to overshoot back to its original

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600
to overshoot back to its original
 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.090
to overshoot back to its original
starting location and then eventually

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.100
starting location and then eventually
 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.530
starting location and then eventually
look like

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:16.540
look like
 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.260
look like
normal button so if we take a look at

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:19.270
normal button so if we take a look at
 

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:22.080
normal button so if we take a look at
the click Adam here's where we actually

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090
the click Adam here's where we actually
 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.590
the click Adam here's where we actually
launched the animations so here we're

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600
launched the animations so here we're
 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.280
launched the animations so here we're
going to set up the the if we hadn't run

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.290
going to set up the the if we hadn't run
 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.290
going to set up the the if we hadn't run
the full anticipation animation yet

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300
the full anticipation animation yet
 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.460
the full anticipation animation yet
we're going to hurry up and finish that

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470
we're going to hurry up and finish that
 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.500
we're going to hurry up and finish that
one up before we actually launched the

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510
one up before we actually launched the
 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:36.420
one up before we actually launched the
moving animation now we're going to move

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430
moving animation now we're going to move
 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.010
moving animation now we're going to move
the thing across the screen this is

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020
the thing across the screen this is
 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.070
the thing across the screen this is
going to animate translation X property

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080
going to animate translation X property
 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.980
going to animate translation X property
on the view from wherever it is on the

left or the right to the other side of
the screen we're going to set an

the screen we're going to set an
 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.360
the screen we're going to set an
interpolator of a linear interpolator

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370
interpolator of a linear interpolator
 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.370
interpolator of a linear interpolator
this is interpolator that I defined

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380
this is interpolator that I defined
 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.470
this is interpolator that I defined
above this is an important point I would

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:52.480
above this is an important point I would
 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.180
above this is an important point I would
never use linear interpolation on a

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190
never use linear interpolation on a
 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:55.740
never use linear interpolation on a
movement because it looks totally fake

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750
movement because it looks totally fake
 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.950
movement because it looks totally fake
instead people things in our real world

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960
instead people things in our real world
 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.230
instead people things in our real world
accelerate into motion and decelerate

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240
accelerate into motion and decelerate
 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.880
accelerate into motion and decelerate
out of it and that's a very natural

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:02.890
out of it and that's a very natural
 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:04.860
out of it and that's a very natural
feeling motion for user interfaces as

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870
feeling motion for user interfaces as
 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.560
feeling motion for user interfaces as
well however in this particular case the

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:07.570
well however in this particular case the
 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:09.420
well however in this particular case the
effects that I wanted was for the

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430
effects that I wanted was for the
 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.250
effects that I wanted was for the
anticipation to be the sort of

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.260
anticipation to be the sort of
 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.770
anticipation to be the sort of
accelerating into this and then I want

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:13.780
accelerating into this and then I want
 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.660
accelerating into this and then I want
the motion to start immediately when you

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:15.670
the motion to start immediately when you
 

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:18.270
the motion to start immediately when you
unpressed abut in' I want that button to

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280
unpressed abut in' I want that button to
 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:19.800
unpressed abut in' I want that button to
start immediately and move very quickly

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:19.810
start immediately and move very quickly
 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:21.450
start immediately and move very quickly
across the screen and I want it to very

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:21.460
across the screen and I want it to very
 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.010
across the screen and I want it to very
quickly stop on the other side of the

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020
quickly stop on the other side of the
 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.750
quickly stop on the other side of the
screen because that's where I wanted the

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:24.760
screen because that's where I wanted the
 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.130
screen because that's where I wanted the
follow through motion of the button

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:26.140
follow through motion of the button
 

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:28.650
follow through motion of the button
actually overshooting where it was and

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:28.660
actually overshooting where it was and
 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.420
actually overshooting where it was and
then wobbling back to the start so

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:30.430
then wobbling back to the start so
 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.550
then wobbling back to the start so
interpolating linearly is totally

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560
interpolating linearly is totally
 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.690
interpolating linearly is totally
appropriate here because we're basically

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:33.700
appropriate here because we're basically
 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.580
appropriate here because we're basically
accelerating into with the anticipation

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:35.590
accelerating into with the anticipation
 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.620
accelerating into with the anticipation
and we're decelerating out of it with

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:37.630
and we're decelerating out of it with
 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.150
and we're decelerating out of it with
the overshoot animation on the other

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:39.160
the overshoot animation on the other
 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.390
the overshoot animation on the other
side of it so linear animation unusually

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400
side of it so linear animation unusually
 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.970
side of it so linear animation unusually
for a movement and then we wanted to

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:44.980
for a movement and then we wanted to
 

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.460
for a movement and then we wanted to
find the animation for the other side of

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:47.470
find the animation for the other side of
 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:48.780
find the animation for the other side of
the screen so it's skewed over to the

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:48.790
the screen so it's skewed over to the
 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:51.540
the screen so it's skewed over to the
left what we want is when it reaches the

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:51.550
left what we want is when it reaches the
 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:52.920
left what we want is when it reaches the
right hand side of the screen we want it

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:52.930
right hand side of the screen we want it
 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:54.840
right hand side of the screen we want it
to skew back over to the right but

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:54.850
to skew back over to the right but
 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:57.270
to skew back over to the right but
overshoot and then we want it to wobble

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.280
overshoot and then we want it to wobble
 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.890
overshoot and then we want it to wobble
back to where it was before so this is

00:05:58.890 --> 00:05:58.900
back to where it was before so this is
 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.480
back to where it was before so this is
the skew animation to go to the other

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:00.490
the skew animation to go to the other
 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:03.300
the skew animation to go to the other
side and we're going to do a quick

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:03.310
side and we're going to do a quick
 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:04.890
side and we're going to do a quick
decelerator so I wanted to very quickly

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:04.900
decelerator so I wanted to very quickly
 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.050
decelerator so I wanted to very quickly
slow down from the speed that it had

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:07.060
slow down from the speed that it had
 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:08.820
slow down from the speed that it had
from the linear motion linear

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:08.830
from the linear motion linear
 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:10.560
from the linear motion linear
interpolator that had before in the

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:10.570
interpolator that had before in the
 

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:13.140
interpolator that had before in the
previous animation and then I want it to

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:13.150
previous animation and then I want it to
 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:15.900
previous animation and then I want it to
wobble and the wobble is going to again

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:15.910
wobble and the wobble is going to again
 

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:18.030
wobble and the wobble is going to again
animate the skew property and it's going

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:18.040
animate the skew property and it's going
 

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.920
animate the skew property and it's going
to use this overshoot interpolator which

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:19.930
to use this overshoot interpolator which
 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:22.530
to use this overshoot interpolator which
will end up at the final value but it'll

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:22.540
will end up at the final value but it'll
 

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:24.540
will end up at the final value but it'll
overshoot it first so that's exactly the

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:24.550
overshoot it first so that's exactly the
 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:27.480
overshoot it first so that's exactly the
effect I wanted is we've overshot to the

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:27.490
effect I wanted is we've overshot to the
 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:29.830
effect I wanted is we've overshot to the
right and now we want it to wobble back

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:29.840
right and now we want it to wobble back
 

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.780
right and now we want it to wobble back
past the stopping point and then

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:31.790
past the stopping point and then
 

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:33.300
past the stopping point and then
eventually end up at the stopping point

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:33.310
eventually end up at the stopping point
 

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:35.770
eventually end up at the stopping point
we use an animator set to do these

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:35.780
we use an animator set to do these
 

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:37.150
we use an animator set to do these
things sequentially so we're going to

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:37.160
things sequentially so we're going to
 

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.070
things sequentially so we're going to
play all the animations in sequence

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:39.080
play all the animations in sequence
 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.080
play all the animations in sequence
we're going to move the button sku past

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:41.090
we're going to move the button sku past
 

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:42.760
we're going to move the button sku past
for the overshoot and then wobble back

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:42.770
for the overshoot and then wobble back
 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:44.860
for the overshoot and then wobble back
to the starting position the normal

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:44.870
to the starting position the normal
 

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:46.900
to the starting position the normal
position for the button and then we're

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:46.910
position for the button and then we're
 

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:52.389
position for the button and then we're
going to play it and that is it thanks
