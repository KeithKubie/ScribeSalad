it's a bad thing so what does that leave

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240
it's a bad thing so what does that leave
 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.119
it's a bad thing so what does that leave
people as although as an alternative

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129
people as although as an alternative
 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:12.410
people as although as an alternative
well I don't think that

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.930
well I don't think that
the Caucasians let's say should revert

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940
the Caucasians let's say should revert
 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.590
the Caucasians let's say should revert
to being white I think that's a bad idea

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600
to being white I think that's a bad idea
 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.500
to being white I think that's a bad idea
it's a dangerous idea and it's coming

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510
it's a dangerous idea and it's coming
 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.370
it's a dangerous idea and it's coming
fast and I don't like to see that I

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380
fast and I don't like to see that I
 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.300
fast and I don't like to see that I
think the whole group identity thing is

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310
think the whole group identity thing is
 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.220
think the whole group identity thing is
seriously pathological I think we've

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230
seriously pathological I think we've
 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.100
seriously pathological I think we've
made big mistakes in Canada I understand

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110
made big mistakes in Canada I understand
 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.690
made big mistakes in Canada I understand
why at least to some degree in that

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700
why at least to some degree in that
 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.390
why at least to some degree in that
respect and that large mistakes are

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400
respect and that large mistakes are
 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.800
respect and that large mistakes are
being made all over the Western world

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810
being made all over the Western world
 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.650
being made all over the Western world

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660
where we're making your group identity
 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.440
where we're making your group identity
the most important thing about you

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450
the most important thing about you
 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.920
the most important thing about you
I think that's reprehensible I think

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930
I think that's reprehensible I think
 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.600
I think that's reprehensible I think
it's devastating

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610
it's devastating
 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.610
it's devastating
I think it's genocide 'el in its

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620
I think it's genocide 'el in its
 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.350
I think it's genocide 'el in its
ultimate expression I think it will

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360
ultimate expression I think it will
 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.930
ultimate expression I think it will
bring down our civilization if we pursue

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940
bring down our civilization if we pursue
 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.670
bring down our civilization if we pursue
it we shouldn't be playing that game so

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680
it we shouldn't be playing that game so
 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.290
it we shouldn't be playing that game so
what's the alternative you know I've

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300
what's the alternative you know I've
 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.880
what's the alternative you know I've
thought for a long time about a

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890
thought for a long time about a
 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.580
thought for a long time about a
political career really forever since I

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590
political career really forever since I
 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.250
political career really forever since I
was like 12 really for a long time and

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260
was like 12 really for a long time and
 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.949
was like 12 really for a long time and
I've always decided against it because

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959
I've always decided against it because
 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.890
I've always decided against it because
it seemed to me that the proper level of

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900
it seemed to me that the proper level of
 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.500
it seemed to me that the proper level of
analysis with regards to the solution of

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510
analysis with regards to the solution of
 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.210
analysis with regards to the solution of
the problem that we're facing isn't

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220
the problem that we're facing isn't
 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.890
the problem that we're facing isn't
political and that's why I think it's a

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900
political and that's why I think it's a
 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.660
political and that's why I think it's a
mistake when what I'm doing

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670
mistake when what I'm doing
 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.699
mistake when what I'm doing
gets politicized either by me or others

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709
gets politicized either by me or others
 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.610
gets politicized either by me or others
I think that the way that you deal with

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620
I think that the way that you deal with
 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.039
I think that the way that you deal with
this is to put yourself together I

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049
this is to put yourself together I
 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.470
this is to put yourself together I
really believe that is that because I

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480
really believe that is that because I
 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.120
really believe that is that because I
think that individual people are far

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130
think that individual people are far
 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:36.500
think that individual people are far
more powerful they're certainly far more

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510
more powerful they're certainly far more
 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.270
more powerful they're certainly far more
evil than they're willing to consider

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280
evil than they're willing to consider
 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.009
evil than they're willing to consider
but that's also a sign of their

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019
but that's also a sign of their
 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:44.030
but that's also a sign of their
unbelievable power so I think that what

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040
unbelievable power so I think that what
 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.600
unbelievable power so I think that what
you do is you aim high and put yourself

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610
you do is you aim high and put yourself
 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.210
you do is you aim high and put yourself
together and stay the hell away from the

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220
together and stay the hell away from the
 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.550
together and stay the hell away from the
ideologues because they're hiding

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560
ideologues because they're hiding
 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.770
ideologues because they're hiding
they're hiding behind a wall they're not

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780
they're hiding behind a wall they're not
 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.660
they're hiding behind a wall they're not
able to come out and fight on their own

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670
able to come out and fight on their own
 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.140
able to come out and fight on their own
behalf and so the way forward through

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150
behalf and so the way forward through
 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.940
behalf and so the way forward through
the ideological mess and that's the

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950
the ideological mess and that's the
 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.280
the ideological mess and that's the
lesson of Western culture is to place

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290
lesson of Western culture is to place
 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.770
lesson of Western culture is to place
the individual at the place of paramount

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780
the individual at the place of paramount
