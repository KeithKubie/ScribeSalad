00:00:17.479 --> 00:00:20.063
"Hey, another atom.
I'm hydrogen, nice to meet you.

00:00:20.063 --> 00:00:22.033
How are you feeling about the jump?"

00:00:22.033 --> 00:00:24.955
"Hi there, I'm antihydrogen,
your antiatom,

00:00:24.955 --> 00:00:27.119
and to be honest, I'm feeling
kind of neutral.

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.509
My positron and antiproton balance out,
just like your electron and proton, right?"

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:34.504
"Hey, yeah! You look just like me,
but different somehow."

00:00:34.504 --> 00:00:38.498
"Whoa, be careful! If we get too close,
we'll disappear in a spark of energy.

00:00:38.498 --> 00:00:40.256
I'd like to stay in one piece."

00:00:40.256 --> 00:00:41.403
"Oh wow, sorry."

00:00:41.403 --> 00:00:43.102
"It's okay. I was just thinking,

00:00:43.102 --> 00:00:44.081
it's kind of weird for us to be

00:00:44.081 --> 00:00:46.502
chatting like this before our 
jump above CERN."

00:00:46.502 --> 00:00:47.486
"Why's that?"

00:00:47.486 --> 00:00:50.010
"Well, for starters, how do we know
we'll both fall?"

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.821
"Of course we'll fall. It's gravity,

00:00:51.821 --> 00:00:54.224
you know, the force of attraction 
between masses.

00:00:54.224 --> 00:00:56.012
I even know how fast we should fall.

00:00:56.012 --> 00:00:58.350
Galileo showed in that tower experiment

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.736
that all falling objects accelerate 
at the same rate, regardless of mass."

00:01:02.736 --> 00:01:04.535
"That's for bigger objects.

00:01:04.535 --> 00:01:07.682
It's a different story 
for small particles like us.

00:01:07.682 --> 00:01:11.818
Our mass is so tiny that the gravitational
force we experience is miniscule,

00:01:11.818 --> 00:01:16.526
and if the particles are charged, 
like my antiproton or your proton,

00:01:16.526 --> 00:01:18.697
then it becomes impossible to detect

00:01:18.697 --> 00:01:22.199
compared to the much greater
electromagnetic force acting on them."

00:01:22.199 --> 00:01:25.468
"But that's only for charged particles.
You and I are both neutral.

00:01:25.468 --> 00:01:29.029
Our charges balance out,
so the electromagnetic force is small

00:01:29.029 --> 00:01:31.368
and the gravitational force
should be detectable.

00:01:31.368 --> 00:01:32.921
I know mine's been measured."

00:01:32.921 --> 00:01:36.019
"Because you're everywhere, 
but I'm kind of hard to find."

00:01:36.019 --> 00:01:37.757
"Why is that, anyway?

00:01:37.757 --> 00:01:38.977
Shouldn't there have been an equal amount

00:01:38.977 --> 00:01:41.359
of matter and antimatter created
in the Big Bang?"

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:43.845
"You'd think so, but then all of
those particles

00:01:43.845 --> 00:01:46.833
would have annihilated 
each other into energy, remember?

00:01:46.833 --> 00:01:49.284
And the Universe is obviously
full of matter.

00:01:49.284 --> 00:01:52.304
No one knows why there is more matter
than antimatter,

00:01:52.304 --> 00:01:55.088
which is why scientists
are so interested in studying me."

00:01:55.088 --> 00:01:56.924
"So where do they find you anyway?"

00:01:56.924 --> 00:01:59.200
"Actually, I was made in that 
lab down there.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.875
They needed an accelerator to make
my antiproton because it's so heavy,

00:02:03.875 --> 00:02:05.487
just as heavy as your proton.

00:02:05.487 --> 00:02:07.329
Getting my positron was easier.

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:10.230
It's much lighter, like your electron,
and there are materials

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:12.732
that naturally decay by emitting one.

00:02:12.732 --> 00:02:15.494
Then they just had to put the two together
and they got me.

00:02:15.494 --> 00:02:16.558
But it's only recently

00:02:16.558 --> 00:02:18.042
that they've been able to keep me

00:02:18.042 --> 00:02:20.306
around long enough
to study my properties."

00:02:20.306 --> 00:02:24.305
"And now they've sent you on this
jump with me. Hey, wait a minute."

00:02:24.305 --> 00:02:28.041
"That's right. We're reenacting
Galileo's experiment,

00:02:28.041 --> 00:02:31.901
but with matter and antimatter
instead of two objects made of matter."

00:02:31.901 --> 00:02:33.356
"So what's going to happen?

00:02:33.356 --> 00:02:35.101
Are you going to fall 
upwards or something?"

00:02:35.101 --> 00:02:36.578
"Only one way to find out!"
