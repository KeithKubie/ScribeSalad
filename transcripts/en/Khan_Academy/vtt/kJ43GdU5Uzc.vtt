00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.730
I've been drawing my
indifference curves

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.910
to look something like this.

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:06.420
So that's the vertical axis.

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:07.280
That's one good.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.470
So this is the
quantity of good A.

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:11.560
This is the quantity of good B.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:14.456
And I've been drawing the
indifference curves like this.

00:00:14.456 --> 00:00:15.580
So it might look like that.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:16.730
That's one indifference curve.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.938
Then another indifference
curve would look like that.

00:00:18.938 --> 00:00:21.080
And I could keep drawing
indifference curves.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.140
And it this is what
a indifference curve

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.440
would look like for
two normal goods.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.060
So let me write that down.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.237
These are normal goods.

00:00:29.237 --> 00:00:31.820
And the reason why normal goods
indifference curves would look

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.570
like that or what I'm
trying to figure out

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.670
the combinations
of two normal goods

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.920
is because if I
have a lot of one

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.950
good-- so this point right over
here-- I have a lot of good A

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.310
and I have very
little of good B.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:48.600
I would be willing to trade off
a lot of A to get one extra B.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.220
But if all of a sudden I have
a lot of B and a lot less A,

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.540
I would be willing to
trade off very little A

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.510
to get an incremental B.
So that's why we have kind

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.260
of this inward bow-shaped
curve right over here.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.850
Or mathematically, it looks
like it's part of a hyperbola.

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.230
And that's what normal goods,
the indifference curves

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.200
if you're trading off between
normal goods would look like.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.273
Now let's think about
the indifference curves.

00:01:14.273 --> 00:01:16.060
So it would be this
kind of curved thing.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.840
The marginal rate
of substitution

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.850
would constantly be changing.

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.840
Now let's think about
different types of goods.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:32.270
Let's say that this is
the quantity of $5 bills.

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.380
And let's say that this is
the quantity of $10 bills.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.090
And we're talking
about the good now

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.000
is actually the dollar bills.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.570
So let's say that this right
over here is 10 $5 bills.

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:50.610
Well, that's $50.

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.690
I'd be indifferent between
that and 5 $10 bills.

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.940
So this is 5 right over here.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.940
And any point in between,
I would be indifferent

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.480
because I'm always willing
to trade off 2 $5 bills for 1

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.830
$10 bill.

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.870
So my indifference curve
would be linear in this case.

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.520
So no matter what, on
this indifference curve,

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.180
I'm always willing, if I want
to get to 1 extra $10 bill,

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.200
I'm always willing to
give up 2 $5 bills, which

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.280
makes complete sense because
2 $5 bills are completely

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.800
equivalent to 1 $10 bill.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.100
Now we could take it
to another extreme.

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.110
Let's say I have an
indifference-- well,

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:45.290
let me draw the quantity of,
I don't know, M&amp;Ms. Let's say,

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:52.040
red M&amp;Ms. And I should have
done that in red, but I won't.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.370
And then let's say this is
the quantity of blue M&amp;Ms.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.980
And let's say that I actually
am indifferent between red

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.110
and blue M&amp;Ms.
Some people aren't.

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.290
Red M&amp;Ms and blue M&amp;Ms.

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.700
So having 10 red M&amp;Ms is to
me is completely equivalent

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.070
of having 10 blue M&amp;Ms. So I am
willing to trade them off one

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.570
for one.

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:10.310
I don't care.

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:11.755
I get the same total utility.

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.100
So in this case, assuming
that I really don't we

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.140
care the color of my
M&amp;M, I'm completely

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.180
indifferent as I swap them out.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.260
And so this is a case
of perfect substitutes.

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.990
Now I'd always be happy
to have more M&amp;Ms.

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:38.750
So another indifference curve
might look something like this.

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.680
But it's always going to
have a slope of negative 1.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.320
I was giving up 1 red
M&amp;M to get 1 blue M&amp;M,

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.309
then I would be indifferent.

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:49.600
And likewise, over here, you
could another indifference

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:55.470
curve between $5 bills and $10
bills that looks like this.

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.850
But the slope would be
the exact same thing.

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:01.220
Now the last situation
I want to think about

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.670
is what we'll call
perfect complements.

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.190
So goods that if you
have one of them,

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.510
you really need the other one.

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.860
Otherwise, one of the
two is somewhat useful.

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.737
And maybe the most pure version
of perfect complements--

00:04:14.737 --> 00:04:15.820
let me write it over here.

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.340
So let's say this is the
quantity of right shoes.

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:33.090
And this is the
quantity of left shoes.

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.170
So obviously, if we're
talking about just one pair,

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:38.610
you have one of each.

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.620
Now, do you care if you
really get more left shoes?

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:42.120
No.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.550
You have the exact
same preference.

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:44.780
It doesn't really
change your life.

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.310
You have the same total utility.

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:47.450
In fact, it might
even be negative

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:48.550
because you have
to store them all.

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.700
But let's just assume you
have the same total utility

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.360
and you don't get
any benefit of having

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.190
those spare shoes in
case your shoe gets

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:55.670
destroyed or anything like that.

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:57.961
In terms of what you can get
out it, what you can wear,

00:04:57.961 --> 00:04:59.400
you get the same utility.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.390
And so you're really
indifferent no matter

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:06.286
how many extra left
shoes someone gives you.

00:05:06.286 --> 00:05:07.910
And you'd also be
indifferent no matter

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:12.320
how many extra right
shoes someone gives you.

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.770
Now, you would be happier if
you had maybe two right shoes

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:19.090
and two left shoes because
now you have two pairs.

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.150
So this would be another
indifference curve.

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.810
And once again, if you
have two right shoes,

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:25.740
you really don't care
how many more than two

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:26.641
left shoes you get.

00:05:26.641 --> 00:05:28.390
And if you have two
left shoes, you really

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:31.550
don't care how many more
than two right shoes you get.

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:33.600
So this indifference
curve in green

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.550
is clearly preferable
to the one in white,

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.210
but along each
indifference curve

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:41.170
it doesn't benefit you to
have three left shoes and only

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:42.330
two right shoes.

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.950
So this is what perfect
complements would look like.

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:46.230
This is perfect substitutes.

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:48.770
And this is normal goods.
