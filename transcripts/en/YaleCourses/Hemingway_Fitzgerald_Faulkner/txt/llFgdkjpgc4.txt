Speaker 1:          00:01          Okay. So, um, with stalling on our final novel, and I'm very glad this is Faulkner. Um, there's some of these stories to tell about Faulkner just about the competition after normal. Um, so this started out having a different title. Um, it started out being called dark house, so you can see that it really is right on the other side of the spectrum. Um, and it's really interesting the thing that actually this novel could be described as either dark house or late in August. So really late and downfalls. The other two constitutive parts, Bernardo, even though it's the light that has been highlighted in the present title, um, in fact, it could just as well had been dark. Uh, this is what Faulkner says about, um, the title that we now have late in August. Um, this is much later. Um, he, um, when he was hopping about it, um, the University of Virginia in 1957 in August in Mississippi, there's a few days somewhere about the middle of the month when actually just fortes or fall is cool.

Speaker 1:          01:15          There's a [inaudible] and luminous quality to the light as though it came not from today, but from back in the old classic times in my Alphonse and Santos and the gods from police. And that's all that the title meant. It was just to me lessened evocative title because it reminded me of that time of who luminosity older than our Christians through ization. Maybe the connection is we've been a growth who has something of that plague and quality. This is great. Um, Andrew Point two novel, um, is about the quality of light in Mississippi. So it has a very important local dimension to it, but in also is sees itself as completely, um, looking back to extremely long literary tradition going back to the classic times. Um, and in fact it predates Christianity. So that's very important, um, to consider it as well is that Christianity is very, very important in this novel.

Speaker 1:          02:25          Um, but it's very important to remember that thought and actually also has a reference point that is older than Christianity. So, um, because thought that was talking about funds and Seth has just, you know, I mean, I think the dose was, I just words to most of it. So I just found some illustration is this is from the Roman mosaics. Um, the satire, so he can see it. Basically, it's a huge, uh, like human beings except the WHO's the feet, uh, uh, the WHO's of a goat. So that's really the, this is not a very pretty, um, image on the farm. I think that in our minds with 10 to thing of the fine, it's very delicate and graceful, um, but as they have kind of an animalistic dimension to it. Um, and this is more of probably looking more like our stereotypical image of the foreign, very graceful.

Speaker 1:          03:19          Uh, but nonetheless we're to WHO's of a goat. So, um, and, uh, as I lay down and we talked a lot about the relation to train animals and humans, um, so it's very important to keep that in mind as well, just in the reference to the fun. Faulkner is, uh, invoking that whole uncertain boundary. Um, and then in between is between human and animal. Um, and as the satire actually has the even long history, if the phone basically is Roman, um, set high, has a, it goes back to the fifth century BC basically is Rick and there's a whole genre called satire comedy if filtering this creature. Um, it's again looking for the most part, like a human being. Um, but having the tail of a horse and also the ears of a daunting, um, just to see the way in which the satire has been reactivated and picking up and reading incarnated in the 20th century.

Speaker 1:          04:26          Here is someone have the ears of I, you know, we them the Vulcans ears, but looking at your faculty like the ears of the satire a and here's another image. Basically the ears are the giveaway of this creature. Also small, um, very, not very noble looking compared to the human being onto the guard. Um, so, but father, even though he's interested in the center in Florence, he's not really writing about them. He, he's mostly interested in Lena, um, and the fact that she is a pagan character to him. So more on Lena. She was never ashamed of that child, whether it had any father or not. She was simply going to the conventional laws of the time and find his father. But as far as she was concerned, she didn't especially need any father Fred any more than the women that on whom Jupiter, bigger children when answers for home and her father.

Speaker 1:          05:29          So father seems to be really interested in women who get Brandon out of wedlock, right with vendors. Um, and as I laid down in Dewey doubt, um, and um, the, the kind of way in which that is the constant burden on her mind. Um, and it seems that he now has gone to the other side of the spectrum. Um, if pregnancy was a constant burden on Dewey, Dell's mind here, it appears that it is not a burden at all. Um, leaners mine and maybe that's why she's a pagan, um, is that it's completely okay to be proud and our web long not to have a father not as aware that father, um, as the father of your child. Um, and the reason that is the case is that Jupiter has had this long history of having father, many children, um, who can point to with her as the father, Jupiter, suse, um, as the father, but otherwise not having a human father.

Speaker 1:          06:34          So it's a completely honorable thing to have a baby when you don't know who the father is. And the most famous example of course is someone called leader, right? So you guys know I'm picking two very chase illustrations, a leader and this one, this one being suits, obviously. Um, but you can, if you would just go and look it up, you can find numerous, other than the stations, I'm also a chase, uh, showing Leda and the Swan, and this is the most famous example, um, Leidos married to someone else. And so it was just was enamored of her. So he comes to her in the form of a swan and the offspring one, the most famous offspring from that union was Helen. So basically the whole of the Iliad, the whole of the artists, they really comes from this union between Beta and sooth. Um, and there would have been no attic at all if that had not been this union between leader and someone who's not quite human.

Speaker 1:          07:39          Um, so here's another illustration. This one is, uh, Greg and this one is Roman was again Roman most say in many modern incarnations as well. Um, yeah, he's also has a poem about leader. So basically someone who goes down in history as, um, and kind of thought if even though it's not presented in this way, but she's really going down in history as the most honorable instance of pregnancy outside of wet bar. Um, so, but farmers also not writing leaders story either, right? He's writing leaners story. So this is very much a case of Lena updating the American Lena, updating the Greek data. Um, she, even though maybe she doesn't know the father or maybe you know, but she's not sure that she can get the legitimate wedded husband to be the father of the top. She's definitely going to go and, and you know, she's going to get someone.

Speaker 1:          08:39          So it was her destiny to have a husband and children and she knew it. And so she went out and attended to it completely matter with that, you know, this is the American case is not the old classic times and the more I in 20th century America, you need to find a guy. So, um, she's on the road, um, to find this guy, uh, who, whom she still thinks is thought to be out of the actual father. So today's lecture is really about the updating of, um, of, of this, the old classmate when mother, and um, this is the structure of today's lecture. The way that I've been talking about. Obviously, you know, this is going to be comedy on the part of Lena. So it's comedy and especially sex as comic. Um, but because this is a road novel, one of the Manny, um, it also has an epic dimension to it.

Speaker 1:          09:34          Um, and, and now the innovation that foreigner is bring to bear on novel and that really is a serious, uh, updating of the classic epic calamity, um, is the introduction of two. Allegorical name's Byron and burden. So, um, but just, just let, um, they want to go back, still linger with the classics for a moment. Um, in the defining comedy in that particular way. Usually we just think of comedy is, you know, like Jane Austin, you know, that would be comedy. Um, having, having, uh, but actually, um, in the poetics, Aristotle defines a common thing in slightly different way than Natalie is closer to the way that I would like to talk about comedy in this class in the, he's has the participants in comedy, we're car commodore die not from the bean revelers but because they wander from one village to another. So wandering on the row people, persons who are inferior, not however going all the way to fool villainy but imitating the ugly a wish doesn't do the interest is one pot.

Speaker 1:          10:51          The ludicrous that is, is a failing of or a piece of Berliners which causes no pain or destruction with a very content into the definition of comedy. A lot of it is, is not that nice. You know, it has to do with villainous people, but not going all the way to food. Villainy ugly people. But again, not going all the way. So that other lady speak about it has a lot to deal with people who are not knowable. And that really is the classic definition of comedy. The emphasis really less on, um, the happy ending then on the fact that they are low born, um, that they are low in every other way, that they don't rise to the, to the tragic height of nobility, which is the elevation proper to um, to, to tragedy. Um, combinate is of much lower elevation. Um, so they are sometimes the Chris, um, they uh, basically not at we will people, um, but as one result of not being completely admirable is that they actually survive quite well.

Speaker 1:          12:06          They actually manage to, um, you know, to hang in there. Um, so they bring no pain or destruction either to themselves or to other people. Once again, this is the exact opposite, a tragedy. We have mass destruction at the end of tragedy. Everything about the challenge that you're Troy of all the tragedies based on the story to try and master introduction here. Um, accommodate. It's just that everyone is going to be able to survive. So, um, with that definition in mind, um, less thing about the ways in which Lena as peg and there, especially in relation to her sexuality and the way the five that represents this aspect of him, the human condition. Um, and this is the story of how Lena gets pregnant. She's lab in the lean to room at the back of the house. It had a window which she learn to open and close again in the dark without making noise to live the eight years before she opened the window for the first time, she had not opened it a dozen times Hartley before she discover that should not have opened it at Oh, she said to herself, that's just my luck.

Speaker 1:          13:24          Two weeks later she climbed again through the window. It was a little difficult this time even had been this hard to do before. I reckon that would not be doing it. Now she talked. So the UN has, or I know this, what could have been seen as tragic, traumatic, the kind of devastation of one person's life, one poses line being ruined, all that is told through binos relation to the window, um, that she can open it without making a noise that's just done it a few times and then she realized this shouldn't have done it. And then the final time, it's really hard, but she wished that it had been that hard to begin with. So it's all told through this completely off focus of center relation to the main event and is, it doesn't, it doesn't seem especially bad really, you know, even though this matter of inconvenience and that really is what the pregnancy is to lean that it is a matter of inconvenience isn't nuisance.

Speaker 1:          14:27          That is not so easy for her to get out the window this time. Um, and just to remind us the farm that doesn't always write about sexuality in this way. And let's just go back to a character who was completely non pagan and this none other, um, more normal striking example. Quentin, um, in the sound of the fury. Um, so this is what you think thinks about women's sexuality, delicate equilibrium or periodic filth between two moons, balance moons. He says full and yellow as harvest moons, her hips, thighs, liquid faction like drunk things floating like power, rubber laterally filled, getting the border of honeysuckle. Oh, mixed up. So for Quentin and indeed for most non big and, uh, characters, there's a good part of the world that is repugnant, that is just really repulsive. Um, and it turns out that women and sexuality is part of that very, very prominent, uh, well and so it's not great to live in a world like that.

Speaker 1:          15:40          That's really why Quentin does what he does. Um, for someone like Lena for his Pagan, um, much of the world, in fact, probably all of the world is not Republican, you know, is inconvenience. Sometimes it's a little ugly flow, messy, but it's not rebelling. And that's why she is where she is. Um, so on, so this is one way we can think about Lena in version tell you that she's not the only character. So there's novel is actually not that comic, but her share of the novel as comic and in that way. But um, even though there is now this defines comedy as um, as basically the journey, um, that is undertaken by ignoble persons. The more recognizable modern obviously is the epic journey, right? So anytime we think of someone travelling on the road, we thing of the APIC Jara. Um, and that is very much in play.

Speaker 1:          16:39          We're that employed elsewhere in Faulkner is her imagine the way here as well. And this is actually a kind of not so funny a killer. It's interesting to see what the tone of this is. Um, of description of Lena being underwrote, building muse plot in a steady and unflagging hypnosis. The vehicle does not seem to progress like a shabby beat upon the mile red string of rope. So much so is this that in the watching of it, the, I loses a site and sense drowse Linwood and land the road itself with all the peaceful and monotonous changes between darkness and day, like already measure thread being rewind onto a school. So that Alaska as though our sound trivial and unimportant Asian beyond even distance, the sound of it seems to come slow and terrific and without meaning as though it were, goes traveling a half mile ahead of his own shape rate description.

Speaker 1:          17:45          Um, and it's, um, it's on a different register can see that it's really on a different tone. No register from Lina having trouble climbing out the window. Um, and I would say that that the, there's a complicated relation between the APIC drama and the comic genre in this novel on the whole, uh, what the addict genre brings to this novel, um, is the sense of some of a journey that simply has to go on, um, is not even especially, um, pleasurable, um, is just stretches on, um, yesterday. Just the thing more in terms of paradigm that we've been using, um, tomorrow is going to be exactly like today and going to be exactly like yesterday is the state repetition of the same. Um, that defines this kind of epic journey. So it is peaceful and monotonous and image that thoughtfully uses is that it's like already measured the threat being rewarmed onto the spoon, right?

Speaker 1:          18:53          There's absolutely nothing new under the sun. It is just an old story being told over and over again. Um, and um, the complete, um, exclusion of anything that is dramatic from this sense of the journey. So it's in many ways it's very hard to write a novel based on the fact that it's completely monotonous and as part of the challenge of, you know, I promise you the rest of where as with anything but monotonous, but um, leaders part of it, Ashley aspires to be monotonous in a good sense in the sense that there's really, um, is good. You know, that there's no dramatic development, there's no catastrophe. That's really what Faulkner has. The back of his head is that could, has to fade is what defines tragedy. Non Catastrophe is more defiance comedy. So, um, just to give you a sense of the way in which this epic journey, it's been incarnated and incarnated American literature, two other very famous novelists, Jack Heroin on the road.

Speaker 1:          20:00          And more recently, this apocalyptic instance of that calming in the car, the, the road, um, foreigners on the road, um, is a low different from those two. Um, so today we'll think about all the ingredients that go into his making of his road novel has to deal with kindness of strangers, um, has to do with something like switch ability. Um, if the journey is going to be pretty monotonous for Lina, the scar to be some variation, right? It has to alternate with something else. So it turns out that actually, even though the protagonist who itself is two is peaceful for the story to be very dramatic. Um, there will be other people, the supporting counts actually with supply, the drama. So there's a kind of as a switch and below they be him, um, where the action or where the drama is going to come from.

Speaker 1:          20:56          As long as Lena is concerned, the drama is going to come from the supporting cast rather than from Vienna herself. Um, and this for which ability in terms of the relation to train the weighty and that Monday. And then I'll talk about jurrens as well. So there's the outline of what is to come, but let's just stay with the kindness of strangers, uh, for a little bit. Um, leaners come by farm. Um, and the reason, um, that the journey is so peaceful and monotonous is that there's an endless supply of people who would do things for right, who will be the suppliers of hospitality, um, to keep going. And that too is very Greek. We know that hospitality is one of the key virtues, um, in Greek cocksure that when a stranger comes to supposed to feed them, shelter them, give them presence when they go away.

Speaker 1:          21:52          Um, that is the understanding of the basic model that are exchanged between human beings is that you're good to people, you think the first time and that you never see again. Um, so this Google hardly the something of that and the way that and at has being treated, the evocation of far is the peaceful corridor paved with unflagging and triumphal faith and people with kindness and thing. Those faces and voices, Lucas version, I don't know. I don't know anybody by that name around here. This road. It goes to Honda. He might be there as possible. Here's a work in this going a piece of the way, we'll take you that far. So these people are completely faceless and nameless. They really aren't complete strangers. They're not meant to be remembered or to be encountered again, even though, and sometimes actually picks up some of them and there's other novels, but they're meant to recede into the background as part of that peaceful and monotonous corridor and which it is completely safe for being a travel right.

Speaker 1:          23:01          So it's, this has of guarantees safety due to the guarantee hospitality of strangers. But we know that it's, the kindness of strangers has got to take a dramatic turn for there to be a good story into the novel. So we're actually seeing a very soon, um, and it comes about, um, through leaners interaction with a couple, she was being taken in by this couple, um, and it turns out that they arrive or of Lena careism and leisure upheaval in the life of this married couple. So all of a sudden Lina recedes into the background. So, you know, we can also to switch ability. We can also add the switch ability between foreground and background. Lina recedes into the background as the supporting cast comes to the foreground. So this is the exchange between the arms. There's, he cannot tell from her voice if she's watching him or not.

Speaker 1:          24:09          Now he to Howard's himself with his lead flowers, said maybe she will ever is running away from her is after I reckon is going to find out can made a bad mistake when he started before he put the Mississippi River and train them. And now he knows that she's watching him do gray woman, not plum enough then men hot work on in a serviceable Greg Garman, one savage and bras her hands on her hips, her phase like those of generals who had been defeated in battles you man. She says, what do you want to do about it? To other out whether it's sleeping the by maybe you men, she says done there. So this is all we are going to early. We'll get one more a little bit for this, but this is really, um, for as far as staff nurse one. So this is completely adequate fleas standing snapshot of the marriage.

Speaker 1:          25:10          Um, and I would say that it is as interesting as the marriage between Cora and her husband and how, um, except that is sort of, is at the moment of tension between the two. So we know that what kinds of people, these are the poor whites. One more, right? People where, who can afford and how and use split flowers after a towel. Um, and the re the way that they actually know each other very well. So, um, arms to, doesn't have to look as the arms. Um, Armstead doesn't have to look. Um, usually to see issues watching him on that, it really says a lot about what kind of relationship, um, it is that you can just tell by the tone of voice whether or not the other person's looking at you. So that for me is a measure of how good our marriage is that, you know, you know, your companion, that why, just a tone of words, we'll be able to tell you exactly the posture, the physical departure, um, of this person.

Speaker 1:          26:20          Um, so initially you can really tell. Um, but then, um, once he says something, once he said, okay, you know, that this guy is not going to be able to escape from [inaudible]. Once he said that, then she know instantly that she's looking at him. Um, and we know what she looks like. Um, serve, uh, uh, uh, um, most doing version I think of addy, um, but pretty much very much belonging to the same socio economic group, um, in a gray gum and, um, working hard all alive, but also not just work hard and all this interesting and adjectives by a [inaudible] man hot. I don't exactly know what that means, man. Hot. It's just that maybe she is completely resistant to the charms of men. Maybe that's one definition of what it means to be man hall. Um, certainly she's worked hard all her life and maybe the two adjectives are related in that way.

Speaker 1:          27:22          There's a way in which, you know, if you will so hodge, um, all your life, you're kind of immune to a chance of other people, men and women. Um, so she is immune to the charms. Her husband, um, and her face is like the phase of generals who've been defeated in, um, it is, we reference, um, it is not, you know, the civil war is really not important. Um, in this who are the, no, actually it was very, very important to another character, but it's not going to Reno. Um, the civil was front and center for another character, but it's oddly intrudes into this moment when it really is not the reference point. Um, but they are at high history of the south is in the acts in this reference of Mrs arms, this face looking like, um, the face of general. So she is in many ways she's more like a man, um, than like a woman.

Speaker 1:          28:26          Um, I know there's actually, um, that when I came to this sections, uh, last week and I enjoyed them very much. Some of you mentioned that they cause is financially, uh, more like a man. So it's rosemary. Rosemary is financially more like a man. So the Fitzgerald has also thought about the ways in which they could be across gender dynamics in people, otherwise completely feminine. Um, and here's, she doesn't look especially feminine and across Gender Dynamics, um, much, much more powerful here. So she is like the general who's been defeated in battle. Maybe she's been defeated in life just because there's been such a hard life, although you know that. So, um, or just that you know, that it didn't go exactly the way she wanted. Uh, we don't know the contents of that phrase that you know, that we'll have phases like the face of generals who had been defeated.

Speaker 1:          29:23          Um, we also don't know, but that's the least of it. We don't know why she suddenly saying what she's saying to her husband. And, um, honestly there's really not contemplating having an affair with being right. So the doorman is not really a complaint against her husband. It is a grievance that is probably to record against the entire, you know, half of the human population, men, um, that this is what men would do to women. Um, and her husband being an instance of that. Although you know, obviously there are many other episodes in the marriage who might that might be at the back of her mind. But in any case, this completely out of the blue, out of context, outburst from Mrs arms that suggest that this is both buffering good marriage but also a complicated marriage as all marriages would have to beat, right if there's lasted for a long time.

Speaker 1:          30:30          So these two people know each other very well. Um, and he seems to know he knows better than we do exactly what is going on in her mind when she says you do it, man. Um, and then this, um, uh, further development to this. And so, um, she's actually now this, we're getting into dramatic action for Mr. Thompson. Whether are you fixing to do with your egg money this time of night? He says, I reckon his mind to do with what I like, she just dumps into the land per phase, hush better. God knows it was me sweat over them and nurse them. You never lifted. No hand show is says, I recommend a in any human in this country is going to dispute them hands. Will you lesson is the possums. And this next, that rooster band leader, he says, because two things suddenly to job's off one shoe and strikes the China event, the single Shannon glow from the bat reclining Armstead watches her Gavin's remaining coins from amount of China Franklin's and drop them where the others into the slack and nodded and really nodded three or four times with savage finality.

Speaker 1:          31:48          Um, that is says satisfying representations of arms giving or people we being charitable and looking completely not charitable when they're doing it. Right. So this is the only way this woman would allow herself to be a chair of the boat is by looking as harsh and bitter as she could. Um, so, uh, uh, before that [inaudible] had thought, well, you know, maybe she's just into comfort, jealous moon. It was just going to not allow leaner to stay in the house, but it turns out that is quite the opposite. Um, and it's poly is a kind of very calm, calm, calm, calm class combination of recognizing that yes, this is a young woman, very attractive, um, that she's not that young woman, very attractive. Um, but recognizing maybe in some sense, um, that, you know, she also, that this woman is embodying a long nurse grievance that she has against man in general, whatever the psychology, um, she is in solidarity, um, with Lina without ever wanting to be trade that solidarity, right?

Speaker 1:          33:12          So it is that complicated kind of behavior, um, that you want to do something for that person that you never want to give yourself away is doing something. Um, so it, it really is the, uh, the most interesting and dramatic and psychologically and behaviorally complicated kind of client is or strangers, um, is that is not definitely not the traditional kind of arms giving. So in terms of the narrative dynamics, we can say that the arms does have completely taken over the narrative, right? There's a complete switch between Lena to suppose for tagging is, um, and the two of them be in the supporting cast. It turns out that the supporting cast that fall in probably spends more time thinking about the supporting cast than he does thinking about protagonists. And that is a really interesting way to define the protagonists is that maybe the protagonist is someone you can actually afford not to spend a of time thinking about.

Speaker 1:          34:21          And that is really the supporting cast that you have to give your energy to it. A very interesting definition of reversibility, of the distribution of space, distribution of attention within the story. Um, and we've seen many instances of this. So, um, just to, because we've, we've just done with Gero just going to remind you of a very obvious instance of switch ability and tender is the night, um, in the description of Nicole that who ran back is hanging from the pools, right? So it, the human body is hanging from the appendage, um, uh, completely switch the reboost degree of importance between the person who supposed to the protagonist and that what is supposed to be just in the panel. And of course that such ability that is played out not only in terms of that one particular detail but also in terms of the entire narrative of is the night.

Speaker 1:          35:21          It turns out that Duke divers completely upstage by Nicole as she becomes really the main actor in the novel that is becomes her story, that she gets to dictate the outcome of that story and he becomes her bandage and dispensable appendage at the end of the novel. So, um, we've, we've seen this in Faulkner. Um, basically on a very large macro scale in terms of the entire narrative structure of tender is the night in thoughtless is much more local. It's just this one moment, um, that this is switch relation to train protagonists and supporting cast. Um, but I also, and but they're also plays out in different registers in tenders and light in August. So we'll look at one other also local instance of such ability. Um, and this is the food non if the arms that's represent the kinds of dramatic arm of the novel where followed, can give us high human psychological drama.

Speaker 1:          36:26          Um, w when it comes to Lena, he, when he gives us is, um, kind of very small upheavals on one is basic way of level platform, but even on that very level of iPhone, um, their mile upheavals and it has to do with the switch ability between the lady and the mundane. So she seems to museum on the mountain road. Why the slow spitting and squatting and watch her coach Lee believing that she is thinking about the man and the approaching crisis when in reality she is waging of mile battle with a prudential caution of the earth of and with and by which she lives. This time she conquers, she rises and walking Alo awkwardly though carefully, she traverses to rank battery of man eyes and to see the store, the Clo following, I'm going to do it. She thinks even ordering the cheese and crackers and go into it saying allow and a box of sardines she caught themselves means.

Speaker 1:          37:37          So this is the essence of the drama and the to be or not to be over in this case, to do, not to do the, to do or not to do, uh, in Lenas consciousness revolves around Abbas of Saturdays. And that is completely okay for Faulkner qualifies were to be the protagonists of his novel. So we really have to give some thought to what it is that entitles a person to be the protagonist of the novel. We know that in Greek tragedy, a person that has to be noble and it's to have a very drastic downfall in all of the power of art to be the hero of the tragedy. Um, and the modern comic novel, nothing like that, just very, very minor upheaval is okay. So, um, [inaudible] I think that is because of that very level platform because of that basic, very reliable continuum that is uh, backed up, supported, uh, by the kindness of strangers is because of that continuum that we can, a really interesting thing with the practice and kind of a stylistic take almost.

Speaker 1:          38:59          Um, in this particular novel there was maybe some, we've seen a little bit of that and the other novels, but this novel is really pronounced, um, has to do with the use of germs, especially turning verbs into nouns. We've seen a little bit of that earlier in the passage, but here it becomes this in the fall foreground. Um, that far within my hearing before my seeing, I will be writing within the hearing of Lucas Bush before he seeing who would hear wagon but he won't know. So there will be one within his hearing before he's seeing and then he was seeing me and he will be excited. And so there will be two within this thing before he is normally highly stylized. Um, basically there's no way we can not know this. The fact that the verbs, I mean users now in this instance. Um, so the way that we can maybe try to make sense of it, it's very, um, self conscious practice on thoughtless apart is by noticing how different an image of Lucas Bush we're getting from Lena.

Speaker 1:          40:09          How different from the image that we've been getting just a moment ago? Uh, no, actually just a moment later, um, from, from Armstead answered knows exactly what Lucas is doing is running away from her. Um, it's just really unlucky that he hasn't put the Mississippi River road between himself and his woman. Um, so onset is a completely accurate that noses and portrait. What kind of a man Lukas brewers is. Lina has a completely unrealistic out of touch with reality or trade of Lucas. She thinks that he'll be very glad to see her and the he'll be excited and in fact, it's not just one person who's coming but tube. Um, and so in many ways what Faulkner is giving us in this very stylized linguistic practice is to create a kind of link it linguistic cocoon around, uh, Lena that cheers insulated by this an idiomatic use of English just as she was insulated by an interpretation of reality that really has very little to do with the reality would be truth about Lucas Bert.

Speaker 1:          41:24          Um, it is very much a kind of linguistic shelter in which she can afford to keep on thinking in this way about the man who keeps running away from her. Um, and this is why she can afford. And why can't she be continued to be completely unworried on anxious, um, about her pregnancy that that is just not, this is why, how she can have war, she can prevent that from becoming a burden on her. Um, so we can think of this as one element, you know, color, um, as various authors do intervene to make certain things possible for one character that will not be possible for other characters. And this particular intervention they use of is one stylistic device to make sure that Lena is preserved in a state of constant wellbeing. So, um, there and, but he's also clearly enough to know that she really is completely dead wrong about Lucas boat.

Speaker 1:          42:32          So, um, this is, sorry, fast forwarding to have much later moment. Um, but this is just to um, bring Faulkner into a discussion that we've been having all through the semester, which is about types, right? Weather, um, certain people, characters, um, can be classified, they'd be allowed to broader groups, they are groups that have labels. Um, so it turns out that he's also a quite conscious of the fact that uh, Lucas Bird Ashley is now so much and individual, um, as a type a type of man. Um, and he, this is his commentary. Uh, oh, this was actually hide how has gotten a drink but is as good as farmers. Um, commentary on the fate of Lena growth for the Lena grows. There are always two men in the world and the number is lesion. Lucas, Burgess and Byron bunches, you know, all of them has suddenly appearing and thorough.

Speaker 1:          43:34          So the other roof herself is a type, they, the Lena rose off the world and then they Lucas Burgess and burn bunches. And this is really once say's Lena is that she actually is one of the Lena rose and her faith, um, is to be unlucky in one sense. And that she's stuck with a male like Lukas boroughs. But she's lucky in the sense that you can just know, I mean it's almost a kind of statistical point that to every Lucas bird there will be a Byron bunch, will take care of her. So you know, she was saving this way that there always be the parent of two kinds of men in her life. Um, so here is, you know, the allegory thick and fast, um, Beverly, very heavy handed and meant to be noted as Byron Lebaron do, you know, romantic poet. Um, and with the added little joke, I think he actually died and missile lonely Italy has some reference to, has some affinity to Mississippi as well.

Speaker 1:          44:46          And she would not be on and to thing that there's a nice connection. Um, so, um, it, um, the, so, so here's Byron, you know, being the namesake for apparently button, um, and sure enough he lives up to his namesake, the, the, the romanticism of his namesake. Um, then baron fell in love. He fell in love country to honor tradition off his osteon jealous country raising, which demands in the object physical inviolability. It happens on a Saturday afternoon while he was alone at the no two miles away, the house was still burning. Two yellows smoke standing straight as a monument on the horizon. They side before noon when the smoke first rose about the trees before the whistle blew. And the oldest department, I reckon Barron could do today, they said with a free five to watch, um, the switch ability is in high gear in here.

Speaker 1:          45:53          It starts out with Barron falling in love, but that romantic side of the story doesn't even get to control the entire paragraph. Um, basically it just gets two sentences. Um, and then the rest of the paragraph is taken over by something like that. It says nothing to do with romantic love. And all of a sudden we realized that yes, Byron is falling in love at the same time as a very, you know, that's dramatic enough of this life. Um, but this drama parent's life is taking pot with a drama. There's going to overtake the entire time, which is the burning of a house. Um, and it's, there's something and we also getting another glimpse of what kind of people are living in this town. Um, in the reference to the free fire to watch. This is not the strangers who are kind to other strangers is a very different poetry of the local community.

Speaker 1:          47:02          So, um, it turns out that Byron is not the only person who has another core and call names, but, and now you character, he does as well. It's a big fire and other side. What can they be? I don't remember anything coming up that way big enough to make all that smoke except the burden house. Maybe that's what it is. And then they said, my pappy says he can remember how 50 years ago folks said it ought to be burned. And with a little human fat man to start good. Maybe you'll happens to the dock there instead of fire with those, then they laugh. So this is the other are going to name is that buyer is always going to be here with someone whose name is burden and burden. Why is not, as you know, there's no Byron I'm two clues and uh, there's actually a very famous poem that was sudden suggest to us the origins of that name Kipling's poem, White Man's burden and take out the white man's burden and leap is Ole reward the blame of those eat better.

Speaker 1:          48:10          The hate of leave of those you got, I think we've a completely misguided wrong headed notion as Waco. Kipling's white man's burden is not really about how great it is to take up the white man's burden, but how awful it is and that you incur the hatred of lost of people. Um, so this is what, um, the, what the elk oracle names of how they function in light in August and how farmers really updating the old classic story is that it really is the story about the fate of someone call Byron and the fate of someone call burden. And obviously there are other characters who, uh, invoke through those two characters, but they're both on fire. Baron is on fire because it's falling in love. Join the [inaudible] naturally is on fire and as she's being burned alive, oh no, she's dead. But at that point, but, um, she's on fire by itself. So, um, she's, that is also a contribution to the lighting and all this. And that's why the other alternative title, dark house is business improved really.
