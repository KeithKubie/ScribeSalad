00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:15.760
During the 19th century, there were many freed
slaves that went on to lead extremely noteworthy

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.910
lives despite all the adversity they faced
in their lifetime, such as the world famous

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.050
Frederick Douglass, who not only played an
important role in fighting for black people’s

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.080
rights, but also championed women’s rights,
particularly playing an important part in

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.929
the fight for the right for women to vote.

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:33.030
Not everyone can be so accomplished as the
great Frederick Douglas, but that doesn’t

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.870
mean they don’t at times do noteworthy things.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.670
This brings us to the subject of today- one
Jordan Anderson, a former slave who received

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.340
a letter from his former master requesting
he come back to work.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.870
Jordan’s reply was a deliciously satirical
letter in which, when reading between the

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.900
lines, he essentially told him in the most
polite and eloquent way possible to kiss his

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.149
derriere.

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.850
Widely published throughout the United States
and parts of Europe, the response made Jordan

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.950
a media darling overnight.

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:04.259
Given his background as a slave, we unsurprisingly
know very little about Jordan’s life prior

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:07.140
to being taken from his parents and sold as
a boy.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.820
What little historians have managed to piece
together is that Anderson was born in December

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.670
of 1825 “somewhere” in Tennessee.

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.682
In fact, we know so little about Jordan that
we’re not even sure if that’s how he actually

00:01:16.682 --> 00:01:18.930
spelled his first name, since it’s written
as “Jourdan” on some documents, such as

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.770
an 1870 federal census of Dayton Ohio where
he lived at the time, and “Jordan” on

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:23.770
others.

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.560
This said, historians are confident that Jordan
was sold into slavery at around age 7 or 8

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.900
to one General Paulding Anderson.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.340
Anderson then took Jordan and gifted him to
his son, Patrick, who went by his middle name,

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:35.520
Henry, for most of his life.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.659
Exactly what role Jordan served during his
formative years isn’t clear, but we do know

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.750
that at the time it was common for slave owners
to give their children similarly aged slaves

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.160
to function as servants who doubled as playmates;
so it’s likely Jordan served such a function

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.159
for Henry who was around his age.

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.009
As he grew into a man, Jordan took a more
active role on the Anderson family plantation

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:58.390
in Big Spring, Tennessee, apparently becoming
one of Henry’s most reliable and able workers.

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:59.390
At an unknown point in time in 1848 while
working on the plantation, Jordan married

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:00.390
a fellow slave named Amanda McGregor with
whom he eventually sired 11 children.

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.740
When the American Civil War began in 1861,
Jordan’s life changed very little and he

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.860
still continued to dutifully work the plantation
for his master with his wife until one fateful

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.490
day in 1864 when Union Soldiers happened upon
the plantation.

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.600
Upon encountering Jordan, the soldiers granted
him, his wife and children their freedom,

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.880
making the act official with papers from the
Provost Marshal General of Nashville, documents

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.410
Jordan would treasure for the rest of his
life.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.470
Upon being granted his freedom, Jordan immediately
left the plantation which angered Henry to

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.020
such an extent that he shot at Jordan as he
was leaving, only ceasing to fire when a neighbor

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.980
grabbed Henry’s pistol from him.

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.000
Reportedly, Henry vowed to kill Jordan if
he ever set foot on his property again.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.520
Following his departure from the plantation,
Jordan worked briefly in a Nashville field

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.460
hospital, becoming close friends with a surgeon
called Dr Clarke McDermont.

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:50.840
When the Civil War ended in 1865, McDermont
helped Jordan and his family move to Dayton,

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:56.140
Ohio and put him in contact with his father-in-law,
Valentine Winters, an abolitionist who helped

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.780
him secure work in the town.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.200
For the most part, Jordan’s life in Dayton
was uneventful, with his time spent working

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.010
with a stoic sense of quiet dignity, supporting
his family and making sure his many children

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.300
received a good education, something the illiterate
Jordan was never given the opportunity to

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.300
have.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.480
(In fact, it was noted that while still a
slave, when an unspecified white girl tried

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.410
to teach one of his children to read, the
girl was beaten for it and forced to stop.)

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.380
Jordan’s quiet life was briefly shattered
in July of 1865 when out of the blue he received

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.680
an urgent letter from his former master, Henry.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.110
As Jordan couldn’t read, he took the letter
to Valentine Winters and asked him to read

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:31.110
it to him.

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.890
As it turns out, following the Civil War,
the Anderson Plantation had fallen into complete

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:35.890
disrepair, as is wont to happen when your
entire workforce leaves pretty much all at

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:36.890
once.

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.580
Deeply in debt, in a desperate attempt to
save himself from total financial ruin, Henry

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.490
reached out to the only man he knew who not
only had the skills needed for the harvest,

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:47.200
but also potentially the clout to convince
some of the other slaves to return for paid

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.200
work- Jordan Anderson.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.860
The letter also promised that Jordan would
be paid and be treated as a free man if he

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:52.860
returned.

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.480
At this point, most people would have screwed
up the letter and thrown it in the trash while

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:01.470
taking some sordid satisfaction in that karma
was doing its job, but Jordan had a better

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:02.470
idea.

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.630
After several days of pondering the letter’s
contents, he invited Winters to his home and

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.820
dictated an exquisite response:

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:12.560
Sir: I got your letter, and was glad to find
that you had not forgotten Jourdon, and that

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.500
you wanted me to come back and live with you
again, promising to do better for me than

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:17.500
anybody else can.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.660
I have often felt uneasy about you.

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.450
I thought the Yankees would have hung you
long before this, for harboring Rebs they

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:24.590
found at your house.

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.371
I suppose they never heard about your going
to Colonel Martin’s to kill the Union soldier

00:04:28.371 --> 00:04:30.800
that was left by his company in their stable.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.570
Although you shot at me twice before I left
you, I did not want to hear of your being

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.800
hurt, and am glad you are still living.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.410
It would do me good to go back to the dear
old home again, and see Miss Mary and Miss

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.850
Martha and Allen, Esther, Green, and Lee.

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.250
Give my love to them all, and tell them I
hope we will meet in the better world, if

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:47.250
not in this.

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.230
I would have gone back to see you all when
I was working in the Nashville Hospital, but

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:53.810
one of the neighbors told me that Henry intended
to shoot me if he ever got a chance.

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.140
I want to know particularly what the good
chance is you propose to give me.

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:58.140
I am doing tolerably well here.

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:01.320
I get twenty-five dollars a month, with victuals
and clothing; have a comfortable home for

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.550
Mandy,—the folks call her Mrs. Anderson,—and
the children—Milly, Jane, and Grundy—go

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:06.940
to school and are learning well.

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.030
The teacher says Grundy has a head for a preacher.

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.190
They go to Sunday school, and Mandy and me
attend church regularly.

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:13.530
We are kindly treated.

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.690
Sometimes we overhear others saying, “Them
colored people were slaves” down in Tennessee.

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:21.220
The children feel hurt when they hear such
remarks; but I tell them it was no disgrace

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.540
in Tennessee to belong to Colonel Anderson.

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:26.480
Many darkeys would have been proud, as I used
to be, to call you master.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.560
Now if you will write and say what wages you
will give me, I will be better able to decide

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.390
whether it would be to my advantage to move
back again.

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:37.450
As to my freedom, which you say I can have,
there is nothing to be gained on that score,

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:42.310
as I got my free papers in 1864 from the Provost-Marshal-General
of the Department of Nashville.

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:45.540
Mandy says she would be afraid to go back
without some proof that you were disposed

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:50.300
to treat us justly and kindly; and we have
concluded to test your sincerity by asking

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.990
you to send us our wages for the time we served
you.

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:57.260
This will make us forget and forgive old scores,
and rely on your justice and friendship in

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:58.260
the future.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.490
I served you faithfully for thirty-two years,
and Mandy twenty years.

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:04.710
At twenty-five dollars a month for me, and
two dollars a week for Mandy, our earnings

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:07.810
would amount to eleven thousand six hundred
and eighty dollars.

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:12.930
(About $178,000 today) Add to this the interest
for the time our wages have been kept back,

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:16.770
and deduct what you paid for our clothing,
and three doctor’s visits to me, and pulling

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:21.300
a tooth for Mandy, and the balance will show
what we are in justice entitled to.

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:25.600
Please send the money by Adams’s Express,
in care of V. Winters, Esq.,[267] Dayton,

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:26.600
Ohio.

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.870
If you fail to pay us for faithful labors
in the past, we can have little faith in your

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:31.300
promises in the future.

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.960
We trust the good Maker has opened your eyes
to the wrongs which you and your fathers have

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:39.550
done to me and my fathers, in making us toil
for you for generations without recompense.

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:43.430
Here I draw my wages every Saturday night;
but in Tennessee there was never any pay-day

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:46.370
for the negroes any more than for the horses
and cows.

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:49.960
Surely there will be a day of reckoning for
those who defraud the laborer of his hire.

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:53.639
In answering this letter, please state if
there would be any safety for my Milly and

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:56.610
Jane, who are now grown up, and both good-looking
girls.

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:58.580
You know how it was with poor Matilda and
Catherine.

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:02.360
I would rather stay here and starve—and
die, if it come to that—than have my girls

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:05.860
brought to shame by the violence and wickedness
of their young masters.

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:09.270
You will also please state if there has been
any schools opened for the colored children

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:10.270
in your neighborhood.

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:14.150
The great desire of my life now is to give
my children an education, and have them form

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:15.370
virtuous habits.

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:18.520
Say howdy to George Carter, and thank him
for taking the pistol from you when you were

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:19.570
shooting at me.

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:21.860
From your old servant,
Jourdon Anderson.

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:26.050
At Jordan’s behest, Winters sent the letter
to Henry with the simple, informal title,

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:28.420
“Letter from a Freedman to His Old Master”.

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:32.030
Winters later had the letter published in
an edition of the Cincinnati Commercial with

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:33.070
the same title.

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:36.920
The letter proved to be immensely popular,
both because of the sheer level of snark displayed

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:40.720
and the eloquence with which Jordan had told
off his former “boss”.

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:44.500
The letter was later reprinted in papers across
the country and even published in parts of

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.760
Europe, making Henry a world-renowned laughing
stock.

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:51.210
Unsurprisingly, Henry never took Jordan up
on his offer to pay him 50 years of wages

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:55.350
in one go and the letter likely stopped any
of his other slaves being tempted back when

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:56.640
he wrote to them as well.

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:59.250
As a result, the crops that year were never
harvested.

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:03.389
Henry, deeply in debt, had to sell the plantation
for a fraction of its worth and he died penniless

00:08:03.389 --> 00:08:05.690
and destitute a few years later at age 44.

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:10.070
As for Jordan, he lived and worked in Dayton
for the rest of his long life, dying at the

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:27.259
age of 81 in 1907.
