00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.010
- [Instructor] In other
videos we have already started

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.260
talking about the price
elasticity of demand,

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:06.610
and what we're gonna do in this video

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:09.330
is think about the
factors that might drive

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.730
the price elasticity of
demand in a given market

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.190
to be more or less elastic.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.800
So one could say that
we're gonna think about

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.910
the determinants of the
price elasticity of demand.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.060
Now before we even talk
about those determinants

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.650
or those factors, let's
just give ourselves

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.790
a little bit of a review
of what an elastic

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.320
or an inelastic market might look like.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.890
So let me draw

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.170
my price

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:33.730
and quantity axes

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.550
that we are pretty familiar
with at this point.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.180
So quantity on the horizontal axis,

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.660
price on the vertical axis, and remember,

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.430
price elasticity of
demand is percent change

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.810
in quantity for given
percent change in price.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.060
So a high elasticity
would say that you have a

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.410
large percent change in quantity

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.760
for a given percent change in price,

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.940
so high elasticity would
look something like this,

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.560
it would be a flatter demand curve.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.970
So this might look something like that,

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.360
so I'll write that as high,

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.700
high elasticity

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.380
elasticity.

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.180
And low elasticity would be that your

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.150
percentage in quantity
does not change much

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.560
depending on your percent change in price.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.950
So low elasticity, the closer and closer

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.100
we get to a vertical curve,
the lower our elasticity,

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.980
so low elasticity would
look something like that.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.670
A low elasticity demand curve.

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:31.560
Low

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.870
elasticity.

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.420
Elasticity.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.280
In other videos we even
think about a perfectly

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.970
inelastic market in
which case you would have

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.030
a vertical demand curve.

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.440
But let's now think about the factors

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.100
that might lead us to be closer
to the high elasticity case

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.150
or closer to the low elasticity case.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.360
So the factors that economists
will generally point to

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.300
are substitutes, timeframe, income share,

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.730
whether the market we're talking about

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:00.490
is about a luxury or necessity,

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.890
and the narrowness of a market.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.570
So let's start with substitutes.

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.540
So let's imagine first a world

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.400
where there are many substitutes

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.520
for the good or service
that we're talking about.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.273
Many substitutes.

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.790
And we can think of examples in our heads

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.450
for markets of goods or services

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.130
where there are many substitutes,

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.220
let's say it's the market for

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.220
Fuji apples.

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.670
Well, the other substitutes
are the other types

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.540
of apples out there, McIntosh apples and

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.850
Red Delicious apples, and all of those,

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.750
and so for a given
percent change in price,

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.940
would you expect the percent change

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.630
in quantity demanded of Fuji
apples to change dramatically?

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.230
Well if there are many substitutes,

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.080
and only the Fuji apples, say,

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.630
get a lot more expensive,
then people will go

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.350
to the substitutes, they're more likely

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.420
to go the the Red Delicious,
or the McIntosh apples,

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.510
so when you have many substitutes,

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.013
that tends to lead to more elasticity.

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.500
More elasticity.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.700
People quantity, I guess you could say,

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.010
would be very sensitive to price.

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.680
And you could go the other way around

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.190
if you have few substitutes.

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.763
Few substitutes.

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.160
Well, then, even if the
price changes a little bit,

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.550
or even if it changes a lot, people say

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.690
well I don't know what I
could substitute that with,

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.670
so they might still buy a
reasonably similar quantity,

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.920
so this would be less, less elastic.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.560
Less elastic.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.700
Now what about timeframe, how
does that affect elasticity?

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.810
Well, imagine that you
are selling umbrellas

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.740
and it is raining right now.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:44.690
So for thinking about a short timeframe,

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.640
while it is raining,
then you could probably

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.520
raise the prices on umbrellas a good bit,

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.400
and assuming you have good foot traffic,

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.040
a lot of people are
probably going to be willing

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.930
to pay that price, and
so in a short timeframe,

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.950
in a short,

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.640
short timeframe,

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.240
things tend to be less elastic.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.130
Less elastic.

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.440
But over a longer timeframe,

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.290
so longer timeframe, people
might say, hey you're trying to

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.640
really rip me off with those umbrellas

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.450
and take advantage of me,
I can go someplace else

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.750
and find umbrellas, I could
go online or whatever else,

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.880
and so there, people tend to
be more sensitive to price

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.760
on the longer timeframe, they
can find their substitutes,

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.460
going back to the previous determinant,

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.610
and so things tend to be more elastic.

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.583
So once again, you
could view elasticity as

00:04:37.583 --> 00:04:42.070
how sensitive quantity is to price.

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.140
So next, income share.

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.530
So let's first think about something

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.710
that makes up a very small
percentage of your income,

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.410
say bubble gum, and let's
say bubble gum right now

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.160
is 25 cents, and if it
were to go to 50 cents,

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.600
that would likely reduce
the quantity demanded,

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.320
but it might not be so significant

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.090
because going from 25 cents to 50 cents

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:06.535
isn't gonna make a big difference

00:05:06.535 --> 00:05:08.990
for most people's pocket books.

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.310
So in general, the lower the income share,

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:15.120
lower share of income,

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.140
the less elastic, the less elastic

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:21.630
that market is going to be.

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:25.030
But imagine something that
is a high share of income.

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.290
So let's say we're talking about,

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:29.583
let me just write here, so high share,

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:33.520
high share of income,

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.750
so let's say we're talking about

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:39.520
an automobile, and if
people are already spending

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.110
20% or 30% of their
income on that automobile

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:44.800
and that automobile were to double,

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.380
the cost of that versus the gum ball drop,

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:50.450
the bubble gum, well then
people just wouldn't even

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:52.470
be able to demand the same quantities

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:54.410
that they were able to
before because their income

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:56.380
just can't support it,
they have other things

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.540
to spend that money on, that extra money

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.170
because their incomes
just can't support it,

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:07.000
so they will be highly
sensitive to changes in price.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.950
So high sensitivity to changes in price,

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:12.363
more elastic.

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.740
Now what about luxuries
versus necessities?

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:18.450
Let's start with necessities.

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:21.540
If this is something
that you absolutely need,

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:24.520
then even if the price
were to go up a good bit,

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.130
as long as you can still afford it,

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:28.320
you might still go for that thing.

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.950
So for example, let's say
there's some medicine,

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:32.690
let's say you're a diabetic
and you need insulin,

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:34.440
if you don't get insulin,
really bad things

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:35.840
are going to happen.

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.150
If they were to raise the price of insulin

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:41.760
by 20, 30, 40%, assuming that
you could still afford it,

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.790
you would still buy the same quantity

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:45.830
because you need that insulin,

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:49.020
and so if something is a necessity,

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:52.300
necessity, you're gonna
be less price sensitive,

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.650
the quantity is going to
be less sensitive to price,

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:57.783
and so you're going to be less elastic,

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:03.180
but if something's a luxury,
if we're talking about

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:06.910
you know, gold tiaras,
and the price of gold

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:09.370
were to go up dramatically, well then

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:11.530
a lot of people will say, I might not need

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:13.740
that gold tiara anymore,
it's really not gonna make

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:15.610
a big difference in my life.

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:17.810
So, in general, luxuries,

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:19.640
luxury

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:24.510
will be associated with more elasticity.

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:27.450
Now there could be
exceptions, if something isn't

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:30.030
kind of the ultra luxury category,

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:32.240
and if maybe the price were to go up,

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:35.000
maybe the people buying
it, it's a very low share

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.610
of their income, and maybe it's a brand

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:40.070
that, at least the people buying it

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:42.220
feel that there's no substitute for it,

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:45.600
well then maybe it might
not be as sensitive,

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:48.860
but we're talking about
in broad generalities.

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:51.150
Now the last factor that
is sometimes talked about

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:53.130
is the narrowness of the market.

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:54.670
Now what are we talking about here?

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:58.510
So, for example, we could
be talking about the market,

00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:01.970
market for apples,

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:06.970
or you could talk about the
market, market for food.

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:09.190
Which of these markets,
they're kind of both

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:11.960
describing food, but
which one is more narrow?

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:15.290
Yes, apples are a subset of all food.

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:18.090
And so, if we're talking
about the market for apples,

00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:21.540
the narrower situation, so
if we're talking about the

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:23.270
narrower,

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:26.980
narrower market, you tend
to have more substitutes.

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:28.700
So if the price of apples go up,

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:30.480
people say well maybe I'm
gonna go buy some pears,

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:33.220
or bananas, or something
else instead of the apples,

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:36.530
and so you're gonna be
more, quantity will be more

00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:38.350
sensitive to changes in price,

00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:41.963
and so you're gonna have more elasticity,

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.880
but if you have a broader
definition of your market,

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:49.050
the market for food, well now the food

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:51.640
looks a lot more like it's a necessity,

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:54.390
there are very few substitutes for food,

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:57.340
if I stop eating food, well I,

00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:59.470
it's not like I can eat, you know,

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:04.140
change or just live off
of air, or whatever else,

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:06.610
there's really no substitutes for food,

00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:08.870
it is an absolute necessity.

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:11.610
So the broader the market definition,

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:14.730
so the broader the market,
we tend to be dealing

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:17.510
with a less elastic,

00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:21.553
less price elasticity of demand.
