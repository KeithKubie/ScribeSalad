Ruston: The large earthquake
in Pakistan in 2013

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.360
was the first time
I heard about a big earthquake.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.440
[dramatic music]

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.680
I was so shocked by
the number of people affected,

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.440
and I just really wanted
to help.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.480
[mellow music]

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.840
I started app development
when I was 17,

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.400
which was before I studied
at university.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.080
I realized my skill
of developing apps

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.640
would really help,

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.760
so I decided to make
My Earthquake Alerts,

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.920
which distribute information
about an earthquake

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.080
much faster
than any other source.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.360
Every second counts.
when it comes to an earthquake

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.320
Some say that the app
has saved their lives,

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.000
and they've been able
to get in touch

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.040
with family members quickly.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.800
It's amazing that
you really can build something

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.320
to help
a large number of people

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.960
from anywhere in the world.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.880
From a city or from
a very rural place like this.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.360

Chidera:
Growing up in Nigeria,

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.520
my friends and I found
preparing for exams

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.120
to be boring
and not very efficient,

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.440
so I decided to do an app

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.800
that helps students
prepare for exams

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.640
in a fun and personalized way.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.520
PrepUp is different from
the traditional study methods.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.280
It's a game for learning.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.600
Also,
you get personalized lessons

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.440
that are tailored
to individual students.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.480
Nweke: Using PrepUp
was like playing a game.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.080
It made things
far easier for me.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.920
I did well on the exams,

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.280
and I got 264.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.560
That's a pretty high score.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.840
Chidera: I feel really good
creating a product

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.200
that people use every day
and it's helpful to them.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.360
Currently, we've helped over
120,000 students across Africa.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.680
We couldn't have done this

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.120
without the reach
of the Android platform.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.200
[music continues]

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.640
Chen:
Ari, do we have any basil?

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.720
Ari: A little bit.
Chen: Can you pick me

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.240
a little bit?

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.080
I grew up in a loving
and supportive household

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.440
that sometimes had trouble
putting food on the table,

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.240
so we've always been aware
of thinking about

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.680
how to set a budget and how
to really make things stretch.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.080
There are 42 million Americans

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.480
who are on food stamps
right now,

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.720
and most of them have
smartphones

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.240
and use the Internet.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.920
Our app, FreshEBT,

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.920
helps people who receive
food stamp benefits

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.880
in the United States
manage their balance

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.680
and to become
more financially healthy.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.000
It also helps people find
grocery recipes and new jobs.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.080
It means a lot to us as a team

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.200
that we are actually meeting
real user needs

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.040
through the app.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.600
man: Hi.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.920
woman: How you doing?
man: Good. How you doing?

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.840
woman: Good.
Thank you.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.680
Chen: And that's one of the
things that's most rewarding

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.440
about the work that we do is,
we get to see the daily impact

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.280
of building a product
that really meets the needs

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.200
of those
who are really seeking help.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.840
[gentle music]

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.080
Pi: Forest is an app
that help user to stay focused

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.360
on what's more important
in their life.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.760
People will put down
their phones for a while

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.440
and wait for the tree
to grow up.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.160
Each virtual tree
in the Forest app

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.320
represent focused time
for the user.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.720
Yu: After the app was released,
we got some user feedback

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.320
about if they can
plant real trees in the app,

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.000
and that's when we found
Trees for Future.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.560
[music continues]

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.320
Trees for Future
is a nonprofit organization,

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.400
and they plant trees on Earth.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.040
They also help
the local farmers

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.120
to plan
different type of crops

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.440
so that they can
feed their families better

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.440
and have better lives.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.320
We've came to Kenya today
for the first time

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.760
to visit Trees of Future
and the farmers and farms.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.520
man: This one,
we call it pod tree.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.800
Yu: It's amazing that a simple
app can achieve such things

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.320
and bring positive impact
to society

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.880
thanks to all of our users.
