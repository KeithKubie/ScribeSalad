What's up? I'm Destin. This is Smarter Every Day. Get your phone out. You see that little camera assembly there?

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:09.330
Let's take it out of the phone. Yep. That's what it looks like. So here's what we're going to do. The first thing

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.769
we're going to do is pop the lens off, and there we go. That is called a CMOS

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:17.459
sensor. That is the camera on your phone.

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:25.650
Complimentary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor. So, when you take a photo or a video with your phone, you would think that it exposed that entire chip at one time,

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:32.489
like snapping a photo. That's not how it works. It actually scans down the chip, and that's how images are created.

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:39.629
This is called "rolling shutter," and it's the exact reason your cell phone makes weird shapes out of fast-moving objects.

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.839
This is a flatbed scanner, and I have a circular patch right here.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.759
If I were to take this patch and set it face down on the scanner, and I were to start the scanner and

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.680
move the patch in the same direction as that moving row of pixels, check out

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.909
what happens. You're smart-- is this going to look like a circle? No! It's not a circle.

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:03.359
It's stretched out. And that makes sense, right? You're stretching that image because you're moving it along with the scanner. Now, conversely,

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.830
What's going to happen if instead of moving it with the scanning row pixels, we move opposite?

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.439
It's not going to stretch it out, is it? What's it going to do?

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.869
It's going to compress that circle down. A rolling shutter on your cell phone camera is very

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.110
much like this, except it goes from the top of the image all the way down

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.250
to the bottom. That means that what you're seeing is actually a lie.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.080
It's like a stack up of several different moments. Okay, now that we understand how this works,

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.339
it's time to visualize it in the most turbo-awesome way possible. Over the past three years,

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:37.169
anytime I had a phone and a high-speed camera at the same place at the same time,

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.420
I would be on the lookout for rolling shutter events. And I would video it with the phone and then I would video it with a

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.199
high-speed camera, so that I could go back and manually

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.320
simulate rolling shutter so that I could understand exactly how the artifacts were created.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:58.769
This is so stinking coo!l Your brain's going to get it, instantly! We'll start with iPhone video and then we'll go to the simulation.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.299
&lt;pssh&gt; This is awesome.

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:04.499
This is the first moment I realized I could fake rolling shutter.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.869
I was in a turbo-prop over the Australian outback,

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.199
and I realized that the patterns would change as I rotated my phone.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.829
I happened to have a high-speed camera with me, so I got it out and I started collecting data.

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.200
This is what your camera does dozens of times per second.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.190
I noticed that the patterns looked very different depending on which way the propeller was rotating relative to the rolling shutter.

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:57.710
This is really beautiful, but I was kind of bummed that I didn't get to see the effect head-on to the propeller.

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.259
A couple of years later, though, when I was taking high altitude flight lessons near Pike's Peak in Colorado,

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.850
I finally got my chance to video a propeller head-on on the Tarmac.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.770
The fidget spinner community has known for a while now that when it's really bright outside, a cell phone camera

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:32.039
videoing a fidget spinner will turn it into what they call "the thing."

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:38.340
It's just rolling shutter with a little bit of aliasing thrown in, but it looks like some kind of Ninja Alien throwing star.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:44.340
Anyway, when you slow it down with a high-speed camera, you can really reveal the map that makes this look so weird

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:59.280
My buddy Ben plays both the Mandolin and the guitar, and it took us a really long time to get the rolling shutter effect to

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.280
show itself. But when we did, it was awesome!

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:17.549
Guitar strings are especially difficult because they vibrate so quickly that a normal high-speed camera isn't fast enough.

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:23.879
We had to record them at 20,000 or 28,000 frames per second to be able to run this simulation properly.

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:10.979
The last trick is something I had never seen before, but somebody told me about it. If you video a coin spinning,

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.919
you can see a swirl pattern on the edge of the coin.

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:17.068
Yep, that's also rolling shutter.

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:32.420
Obviously this took a really long time to make, and Henry from MinutePhysics made it possible.

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:35.000
He's the guy that figured out exactly how to make after effects

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:38.720
simulate rolling shutter. On the behind the scenes video, on the second channel, Henry

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.320
and I talked about what we were trying to accomplish.

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:45.200
Go check it out. And we'll, uh, we'll throw some love Henry's way. Also, I want to say thanks to the sponsor,

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:49.039
which is Audible. Before we talk about the book that I'm listening to on Audible right now,

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.310
let's go goof around with rolling shutter and some chickens. Okay, the book

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:55.280
I'm currently listening to on Audible is called "The Devil in the White City."

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:00.889
It's a really good book about the 1893 Chicago World's Fair. A fair that I had no idea changed America,

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:07.400
but it did. Also, America's first serial killer, so there's that. It's pretty crazy. I had no idea. It's a great story.

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:13.489
You should check it out. "Devil in the White City," by Erik Larson. You will enjoy it. You can get that by going to audible.com/smarter

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:16.490
That is two things: number one, you get a free audiobook;

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:21.289
number two, I get secret internet points because Audible knows you came from SmarterEveryDay.

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:26.000
And they're more likely to support Smarter Every Day in the future, and that's a big deal for me and the family.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:33.470
I appreciate that. Anyway, if you see anybody that talks about rolling shutter, make sure they don't get confused with aliasing.

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:38.059
That's the wagon wheel effect. A lot of people get those two confused. I hope this video earned your subscription.

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:42.229
If it didn't, no big deal. I'm Destin, you're getting Smarter Every Day. Have a good one!

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:45.020
Bye.

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.240
Last chicken.

00:06:49.069 --> 00:06:51.069
Brave chicken.
