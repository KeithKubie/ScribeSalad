Can you blame genetics for your report card?

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:22.150
Hi everyone, Crystal Dilworth here with DNews.
Were you born to be good at school? Well straight

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.400
up intelligence might not be all it’s cracked
up to be. Studies are discovering a plethora

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.820
of other biological factors that influence
our success in school and they say most of

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.270
them are heritable.

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.329
It seems obvious, to succeed in school you
simply have to be born with intelligence,

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.930
and then the environment takes over and molds
you into the upstanding citizen you’re going

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.000
to become. But scientists at King’s College
in London are saying that’s not entirely

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.980
true, and other genetic factors may be more
important than we first thought.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.610
In a paper recently published in the proceeding
of the national academy of sciences, researchers

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.300
made a controversial assertion that our performance
on standard assessment tests is determined

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.930
by our DNA. In their paper they state “genetic
thinking counters the deplorable tendency

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.390
to blame teachers and parents rather than
recognizing that learning is inherently more

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.920
difficult for some children and that differences
in children’s educational achievement are

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.710
more a matter of genes than schools or home
environments” ... Wow…

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.070
They came to this conclusion by examining
the performance of six thousand six hundred

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:26.640
and fifty three pairs of twins on a nationwide
examination of academic achievement administered

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.749
in the UK at age 16 (the GCSE for you brits
out there, if you live in the US just think

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:37.600
SAT). The twins were already registered in
an early development study and so additional

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.569
genetic and cognitive information was available
for study participants. Each pair of twins

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:46.719
lived at home with the same parents, so the
researchers were able to control for environmental

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:51.210
factors and examine only the effect of genetic
variation on exam scores.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.229
Now here is where it gets interesting: the
scientists broke the pool of twins into two

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.179
groups, identical twins (who share 100% of
the same genetic composition) and fraternal

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:05.229
twins (who share only 50% of the same genetic
composition) in this way they were able to

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:10.340
show that genetic similarity was a greater
indicator of test performance, than a similarity

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.900
of home environment.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.970
The study looked at the twins’ intelligence
scores, but also confidence, personality,

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.239
self and parent reported behavior problems,
and more, and they say that what on the surface

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:26.689
seems like an environmental influence, like
behavioral problems, can actually be linked

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:31.340
to causal genetic traits like attention and
extroversion or introversion.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.340
Furthermore, they assert that education is
not a passive process and children actively

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.250
choose what experiences they are exposed to.
This link between experience and preferences

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.709
determined by genotype is known as genotype–environment
correlation.

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:50.230
Obviously there is a lot that needs to get
unpacked here, but this study introduces a

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.629
great nature vs. nurture issue. The authors
clearly argue that nature, (genetic factors)

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:59.220
are more powerful and important than nurture,
or environmental factors.

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.040
Personally? *I* think that genetics gives
us a baseline, but doesn’t dictate how far

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.250
we can go.

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.510
