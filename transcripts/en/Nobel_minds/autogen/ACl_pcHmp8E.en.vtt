award the Nobel prizes later in life do
 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:49.870
award the Nobel prizes later in life do
you think it's a good thing that you

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880
you think it's a good thing that you
 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.420
you think it's a good thing that you
should wait longer to be recognized for

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430
should wait longer to be recognized for
 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.870
should wait longer to be recognized for
your work I'll ask you first

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880
your work I'll ask you first
 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.390
your work I'll ask you first
Oliver Hart because your father died at

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:58.400
Oliver Hart because your father died at
 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.810
Oliver Hart because your father died at
the age of 106 and he published his most

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820
the age of 106 and he published his most
 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.670
the age of 106 and he published his most
significant scientific paper when he was

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680
significant scientific paper when he was
 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.480
significant scientific paper when he was
71 it's true yes I I think he was going

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490
71 it's true yes I I think he was going
 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.520
71 it's true yes I I think he was going
a little too slowly actually but yeah to

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530
a little too slowly actually but yeah to
 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.890
a little too slowly actually but yeah to
answer your question I I think certainly

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900
answer your question I I think certainly
 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.820
answer your question I I think certainly
in economics they tend to want to be

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830
in economics they tend to want to be
 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.280
in economics they tend to want to be
sure that the contribution that that

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290
sure that the contribution that that
 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.610
sure that the contribution that that
they're recognizing is is one that's

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620
they're recognizing is is one that's
 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.620
they're recognizing is is one that's
going to survive the test of time and I

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630
going to survive the test of time and I
 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.630
going to survive the test of time and I
can understand that because things

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640
can understand that because things
 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.130
can understand that because things
happen you know people get very excited

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140
happen you know people get very excited
 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.310
happen you know people get very excited
about things and there's some sort of

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320
about things and there's some sort of
 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.920
about things and there's some sort of
hot topic and then it turns out you know

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930
hot topic and then it turns out you know
 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.170
hot topic and then it turns out you know
5 10 years later it doesn't seem so

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180
5 10 years later it doesn't seem so
 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.240
5 10 years later it doesn't seem so
important so I think you know they often

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250
important so I think you know they often
 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.120
important so I think you know they often
wait 30 years and that's ok and that's

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130
wait 30 years and that's ok and that's
 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.460
wait 30 years and that's ok and that's
going to lead to the kind of ages you're

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470
going to lead to the kind of ages you're
 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.080
going to lead to the kind of ages you're
talking about at which people win prizes

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090
talking about at which people win prizes
 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.300
talking about at which people win prizes
hmm I mean could one of the reasons be

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310
hmm I mean could one of the reasons be
 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.910
hmm I mean could one of the reasons be
that there's so much theory now I mean

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920
that there's so much theory now I mean
 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.370
that there's so much theory now I mean
apparently a hundred years ago there

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380
apparently a hundred years ago there
 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.040
apparently a hundred years ago there
were a thousand physicists and now there

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050
were a thousand physicists and now there
 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.680
were a thousand physicists and now there
are apparently a million so what do the

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690
are apparently a million so what do the
 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.390
are apparently a million so what do the
physicists think do you think it takes

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400
physicists think do you think it takes
 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.000
physicists think do you think it takes
longer for real talent to shine through

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010
longer for real talent to shine through
 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.259
longer for real talent to shine through
because there's just so much information

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269
because there's just so much information
 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:08.650
because there's just so much information
you've got to assimilate I don't think

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660
you've got to assimilate I don't think
 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.080
you've got to assimilate I don't think
it takes longer it's just as you say

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090
it takes longer it's just as you say
 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.850
it takes longer it's just as you say
it's a matter of quantity there's so

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860
it's a matter of quantity there's so
 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.270
it's a matter of quantity there's so
many smart physicists around that how do

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280
many smart physicists around that how do
 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.910
many smart physicists around that how do
you tell which piece of work is going to

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920
you tell which piece of work is going to
 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.050
you tell which piece of work is going to
be significant it's impossible Ben

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060
be significant it's impossible Ben
 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.800
be significant it's impossible Ben
Farina as a chemist you think that the

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810
Farina as a chemist you think that the
 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.020
Farina as a chemist you think that the
prize acknowledges the kind of benefits

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030
prize acknowledges the kind of benefits
 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.870
prize acknowledges the kind of benefits
of incremental ism you know standing on

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880
of incremental ism you know standing on
 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.210
of incremental ism you know standing on
the shoulders of giants as it were and

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220
the shoulders of giants as it were and
 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.460
the shoulders of giants as it were and
it kind of goes against the starting

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470
it kind of goes against the starting
 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.440
it kind of goes against the starting
Eureka moment in the bar that we often

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450
Eureka moment in the bar that we often
 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.150
Eureka moment in the bar that we often
associate with science of course we

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160
associate with science of course we
 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.160
associate with science of course we
stand on the shoulders of giants I mean

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170
stand on the shoulders of giants I mean
 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.990
stand on the shoulders of giants I mean
we work with the knowledge that was made

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000
we work with the knowledge that was made
 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.930
we work with the knowledge that was made
experienced and develop before us but

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940
experienced and develop before us but
 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.080
experienced and develop before us but
there are these sudden moments that in

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090
there are these sudden moments that in
 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.420
there are these sudden moments that in
time that my colleagues and myself and

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430
time that my colleagues and myself and
 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.280
time that my colleagues and myself and
others in the field experience where you

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290
others in the field experience where you
 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.860
others in the field experience where you
suddenly realize the you have made a

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870
suddenly realize the you have made a
 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.810
suddenly realize the you have made a
breakthrough and that opens up a new

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820
breakthrough and that opens up a new
 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.910
breakthrough and that opens up a new
field it might take several years before

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920
field it might take several years before
 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.000
field it might take several years before
it's recognised that a new field has

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010
it's recognised that a new field has
 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.240
it's recognised that a new field has
been opened hmm but Jean Pierre survives

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250
been opened hmm but Jean Pierre survives
 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.280
been opened hmm but Jean Pierre survives
I mean you're a chemist but I could ask

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290
I mean you're a chemist but I could ask
 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:11.690
I mean you're a chemist but I could ask
you this and we're thinking about drugs

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700
you this and we're thinking about drugs
 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.030
you this and we're thinking about drugs
and vaccines and that kind of thing I

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040
and vaccines and that kind of thing I
 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.060
and vaccines and that kind of thing I
mean we do need fast science don't we to

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070
mean we do need fast science don't we to
 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.820
mean we do need fast science don't we to
fix urgent problems I mean like the Zika

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:19.830
fix urgent problems I mean like the Zika
 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:22.250

vaccines yeah you're absolutely right

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650
vaccines yeah you're absolutely right
 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.490
vaccines yeah you're absolutely right
that you know we are I think probably

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500
that you know we are I think probably
 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.880

all of us around this table basic

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:34.890

basic science and of course I mean the

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860
basic science and of course I mean the
 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.720

new vaccines and all that but in our

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990
new vaccines and all that but in our
 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.920

to read these journals rather than to
 

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:03.460
to read these journals rather than to
access them quickly we had to go to

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:03.470
access them quickly we had to go to
 

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:05.410
access them quickly we had to go to
library so it was much more time

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:05.420

and maybe not so good research gentlemen

00:10:50.579 --> 00:10:50.589
and maybe not so good research gentlemen
 

00:10:50.589 --> 00:10:51.480

about the pressure to get tenure I mean

00:10:59.160 --> 00:10:59.170
about the pressure to get tenure I mean
 

00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:01.439
about the pressure to get tenure I mean
the that you have to do a lot to get

00:11:01.439 --> 00:11:01.449
the that you have to do a lot to get
 

00:11:01.449 --> 00:11:03.389
the that you have to do a lot to get
tenure and that makes people write a lot

00:11:03.389 --> 00:11:03.399
tenure and that makes people write a lot
 

00:11:03.399 --> 00:11:05.850
tenure and that makes people write a lot
and all that but actually if you when I

00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:05.860
and all that but actually if you when I
 

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:08.340
and all that but actually if you when I
look around and see my colleagues who've

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:08.350
look around and see my colleagues who've
 

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:11.340
look around and see my colleagues who've
got tenure many of them also seem to

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:11.350
got tenure many of them also seem to
 

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:14.340

think the reason they do it so they

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:16.120
think the reason they do it so they
 

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:17.790
think the reason they do it so they
don't read they're not under the pro the

00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:17.800
don't read they're not under the pro the
 

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:19.889
don't read they're not under the pro the
gun anymore but they still do it it's

gun anymore but they still do it it's
 

00:11:19.899 --> 00:11:22.650
gun anymore but they still do it it's
not just to get grants it's because I

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:22.660
not just to get grants it's because I
 

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:24.990
not just to get grants it's because I
think to some extent they like to feel

busy and they like to be able to tell

00:11:27.509 --> 00:11:27.519
busy and they like to be able to tell
 

00:11:27.519 --> 00:11:28.769
busy and they like to be able to tell
people what they're doing and actually

00:11:28.769 --> 00:11:28.779
people what they're doing and actually
 

00:11:28.779 --> 00:11:32.220

ability or should have the ability to
process complex information and today's

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:15.130
process complex information and today's
 

00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:17.720
process complex information and today's
situation seems to be characterized by

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:17.730
situation seems to be characterized by
 

00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:19.890
situation seems to be characterized by
people thinking that they can go

00:16:19.890 --> 00:16:19.900
people thinking that they can go
 

00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:22.740
people thinking that they can go
directly to the source and not have

directly to the source and not have
 

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:25.380
directly to the source and not have
anybody interpret it and therefore they

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:25.390
anybody interpret it and therefore they
 

00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:27.980
anybody interpret it and therefore they
are very subject very much subject to

00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:27.990
are very subject very much subject to
 

00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:30.090
are very subject very much subject to
misunderstanding what is going on and

00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:30.100
misunderstanding what is going on and
 

00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:32.940
misunderstanding what is going on and
and so yes I'm very not a bit elitist

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:32.950
and so yes I'm very not a bit elitist
 

00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:35.340
and so yes I'm very not a bit elitist
though that oh complex issues there to

yes but the latest doesn't mean in this

00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:42.400
yes but the latest doesn't mean in this

yes but the latest doesn't mean in this
context that it needs to be bad so you

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:45.550
context that it needs to be bad so you
 

00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:48.540

know this is a this is really part of

know this is a this is really part of
 

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:50.490
know this is a this is really part of
our democratic system that there are

00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:50.500
our democratic system that there are
 

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:51.900
our democratic system that there are
some people who know more than the

some people who know more than the

that but they have just have been handed

00:16:58.320 --> 00:16:58.330

now is a sort of total almost rejection

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:07.050
now is a sort of total almost rejection
 

00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:10.199
now is a sort of total almost rejection
for for this principle you know I think

00:17:10.199 --> 00:17:10.209
for for this principle you know I think
 

00:17:10.209 --> 00:17:12.720
for for this principle you know I think
some of the I don't want to call it

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:12.730
some of the I don't want to call it
 

00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:14.760
some of the I don't want to call it
distrust of experts but sort of working

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:14.770
distrust of experts but sort of working
 

00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:17.100
distrust of experts but sort of working
around them isn't so bad I mean for

00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:17.110
around them isn't so bad I mean for
 

00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:19.110
around them isn't so bad I mean for
example you know once upon a time if

00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:19.120
example you know once upon a time if
 

00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:20.730
example you know once upon a time if
there was anything wrong with you went

00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:20.740
there was anything wrong with you went
 

00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:22.230
there was anything wrong with you went
to the doctor and you assumed that what

00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:22.240
to the doctor and you assumed that what
 

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:24.150
to the doctor and you assumed that what
the doctor was telling you was the truth

00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:24.160
the doctor was telling you was the truth
 

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:26.819
the doctor was telling you was the truth
now you can go on the internet and find

00:17:26.819 --> 00:17:26.829
now you can go on the internet and find
 

00:17:26.829 --> 00:17:29.100
now you can go on the internet and find
out get a lot of information about what

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:29.110
out get a lot of information about what
 

00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:30.330
out get a lot of information about what
might be wrong with you and I think that

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:30.340
might be wrong with you and I think that
 

00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:32.520
might be wrong with you and I think that
can be actually productive sometimes you

00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:32.530
can be actually productive sometimes you
 

00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:35.100
can be actually productive sometimes you
can end up knowing more than the doctor

00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:35.110
can end up knowing more than the doctor
 

00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:36.480
can end up knowing more than the doctor
about a particular thing or but at least

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:36.490
about a particular thing or but at least
 

00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:38.580
about a particular thing or but at least
being able to bring to their attention

00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:38.590
being able to bring to their attention
 

00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:41.940
being able to bring to their attention
something and I think there's a

00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:41.950
something and I think there's a
 

00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:45.240
something and I think there's a
difference between that and you know if

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:45.250
difference between that and you know if
 

00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:47.010
difference between that and you know if
you go on the web and you look at things

00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:47.020
you go on the web and you look at things
 

00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:48.840
you go on the web and you look at things
carefully and you might even read some

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:48.850
carefully and you might even read some
 

00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:50.480
carefully and you might even read some
journal articles you don't want to

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:50.490
journal articles you don't want to
 

00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:53.130
journal articles you don't want to
exaggerate your competence to understand

00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:53.140
exaggerate your competence to understand
 

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:56.210
exaggerate your competence to understand
them but you can get a sense of it I

00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:56.220
them but you can get a sense of it I
 

00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:58.920
them but you can get a sense of it I
mean that's a good thing and and figure

00:17:58.920 --> 00:17:58.930
mean that's a good thing and and figure
 

00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:00.360

if you did that say with global warming

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:00.370
if you did that say with global warming
 

00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:02.310
if you did that say with global warming
you would undoubtedly end up with the

00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:02.320
you would undoubtedly end up with the
 

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:04.740
you would undoubtedly end up with the
conclusion that the science says this is

00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:04.750
conclusion that the science says this is
 

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:07.980
conclusion that the science says this is
a really serious problem what's worrying

00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:07.990
a really serious problem what's worrying
 

00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:10.950
a really serious problem what's worrying
is when people find somebody who says

00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:10.960
is when people find somebody who says
 

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:13.740
is when people find somebody who says
it's not a problem and focuses you know

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:13.750
it's not a problem and focuses you know
 

00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:15.420
it's not a problem and focuses you know
they then focus on that

00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:15.430
they then focus on that
 

00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:17.430
they then focus on that
yeah there's a whole tsunami of

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:17.440
yeah there's a whole tsunami of
 

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:20.100
yeah there's a whole tsunami of

information the real point that we are
 

00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:22.500
information the real point that we are
all facing is of course quality of

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:22.510
all facing is of course quality of
 

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:25.050
all facing is of course quality of
information what does it mean how are we

00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:25.060
information what does it mean how are we
 

00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:27.600
information what does it mean how are we
going to educate our young people to

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:27.610
going to educate our young people to
 

00:18:27.610 --> 00:18:31.610
going to educate our young people to
distinguish what is right how are we to

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:31.620
distinguish what is right how are we to
 

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:34.410

well as you know really raise the

00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:40.440
well as you know really raise the
 

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:43.049
well as you know really raise the

00:19:43.049 --> 00:19:43.059
standard of our research and so I'm
 

00:19:43.059 --> 00:19:47.039

saddened by the fact that the people

00:19:47.039 --> 00:19:47.049
saddened by the fact that the people
 

00:19:47.049 --> 00:19:49.859
saddened by the fact that the people

working in chemistry at the highest
 

00:19:49.869 --> 00:19:52.349
working in chemistry at the highest

that strengthens the case for

00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:15.150
that strengthens the case for
 

00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:17.090
that strengthens the case for

so we've got some questions I think from

00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:09.930
so we've got some questions I think from
 

00:28:09.930 --> 00:28:11.690
so we've got some questions I think from
the students here if I could have the

00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:11.700
the students here if I could have the
 

00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:12.500
the students here if I could have the
first one

00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:12.510
first one
 

00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:18.260
first one
Olaf Johnson your question yeah so what

00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:18.270
Olaf Johnson your question yeah so what
 

00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:21.410
Olaf Johnson your question yeah so what
are the fundamental limits to how small

00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:21.420
are the fundamental limits to how small
 

00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:23.680
are the fundamental limits to how small
you could make these certified

00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:23.690

00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:27.980
you could make these certified
machines okay great if we could take the

00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:27.990
machines okay great if we could take the
 

00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:32.210
machines okay great if we could take the
next one held up Bergman so I wonder in

00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:32.220
next one held up Bergman so I wonder in
 

00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:34.130
next one held up Bergman so I wonder in

what are the fundamental limits to how

00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:45.150
what are the fundamental limits to how
 

00:28:45.150 --> 00:28:47.180
what are the fundamental limits to how
small you can make an artificial

00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:47.190
small you can make an artificial
 

00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:49.520

your group built a four-wheel drive nano

00:28:59.840 --> 00:28:59.850
your group built a four-wheel drive nano
 

00:28:59.850 --> 00:29:04.100
your group built a four-wheel drive nano
car yeah it's very difficult to say what

00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:04.110
car yeah it's very difficult to say what
 

00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:05.690
car yeah it's very difficult to say what
the limits were doing but we work with

00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:05.700
the limits were doing but we work with
 

00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:07.850
the limits were doing but we work with
molecules and typically our molecular

00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:07.860
molecules and typically our molecular
 

00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:11.690
molecules and typically our molecular
motor is half a nanometer or so so and

00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:11.700
motor is half a nanometer or so so and
 

00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:13.430
motor is half a nanometer or so so and
one nanometer is one billionth of a

00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:13.440
one nanometer is one billionth of a
 

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:16.070
one nanometer is one billionth of a
meter as you know so the limits will be

00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:16.080
meter as you know so the limits will be
 

00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:17.780
meter as you know so the limits will be
probably in that size but you have to

00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:17.790
probably in that size but you have to
 

00:29:17.790 --> 00:29:19.070
probably in that size but you have to
realize if you want to build machines

00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:19.080
realize if you want to build machines
 

00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:21.770
realize if you want to build machines
it's only the moving part is only part

00:29:21.770 --> 00:29:21.780
it's only the moving part is only part
 

00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:23.570
it's only the moving part is only part
of the machine so you have to integrate

00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:23.580
of the machine so you have to integrate
 

00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:25.220
of the machine so you have to integrate
it for instance you have to put it on

00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:25.230
it for instance you have to put it on
 

00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:27.550
it for instance you have to put it on
the servers or integrate in a device etc

00:29:27.550 --> 00:29:27.560
the servers or integrate in a device etc
 

00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:31.850
the servers or integrate in a device etc
so that is that all depends on the type

00:29:31.850 --> 00:29:31.860
so that is that all depends on the type
 

00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:33.800
so that is that all depends on the type
of molecules you are designing for a

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:33.810
of molecules you are designing for a
 

00:29:33.810 --> 00:29:36.020
of molecules you are designing for a
specific purpose if you look in your eye

00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:36.030
specific purpose if you look in your eye
 

00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:40.370
specific purpose if you look in your eye

which has a beautiful switch yeah it is
the tiny molecule in the in the eye is

00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:42.630
the tiny molecule in the in the eye is
 

00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:44.780
the tiny molecule in the in the eye is
probably one nanometer but it's part of

00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:44.790
probably one nanometer but it's part of
 

00:29:44.790 --> 00:29:46.430
probably one nanometer but it's part of
a big protein complex that makes it

00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:46.440
a big protein complex that makes it
 

00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:48.740
a big protein complex that makes it
possible that the signal of the light

00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:48.750

you know but when she asked about
 

00:31:13.230 --> 00:31:15.140
you know but when she asked about
medicine is that you know we think about

00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:15.150
medicine is that you know we think about
 

00:31:15.150 --> 00:31:18.770
medicine is that you know we think about
