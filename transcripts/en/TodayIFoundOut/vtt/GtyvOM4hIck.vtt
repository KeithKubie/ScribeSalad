00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.120
Most of us in the western world expect judges
to wear a robe when they sit behind their

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.690
bench in a courtroom, and they usually do
not disappoint.

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:22.570
But we rarely think about how the long, usually
black, robe became the standard outfit for

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.160
the men and women who preside over criminal
and civil cases in the courtroom.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.060
The tradition began about seven hundred years
ago in England.

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.060
Robes became the standard uniform for judges
in England during the reign of Edward II,

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.640
who ruled from 1327 until 1377.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.400
At this point, they had already been the standard
garb for academics for over a century (see:

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.400
Why Graduates Wear Caps and Gowns), as well
as worn in other settings.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.660
For instance, at this point, this type of
garb would also have been appropriate for

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.870
wear for a visit to the royal court, so a
judge wearing his robes outside of the courtroom

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.930
would not have been out of place.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.210
The standard robes for judges at this point
came in three colors: violet for the summer,

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.560
green for the winter, and scarlet for special
occasions.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:08.000
Judges often received the material for these
robes as part of a grant from the King.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.420
The last mention of the green robes occurs
in 1534, and new guidelines dictating which

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.899
robes could be worn at certain times appear
in 1635.

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:22.810
The new guide suggested judges wear black
robes with a fur trim during the winter and

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.310
violet or scarlet robes that feature pink
taffeta for the summer.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.850
Historians believe that the transition to
only black robes may have begun in the second

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.950
half of the 17th century in England.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.920
But it is not known for sure what exactly
caused the switch, though a popular theory

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.249
ties the black robes to the mourning period
after the death of a monarch.

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:47.359
Some historians claim that the funeral of
Queen Mary in 1694 helped cement the already

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:52.369
worn black robes as the typical attire while
others point to the death of Charles II in

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:55.409
1685 as the start of that tradition.

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.549
Whatever the case, additional guidelines instructing
judges to wear black robes appeared in the

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.000
middle of the 18th century.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.639
At that point, English judges typically wore
a scarlet robe with a black scarf and a scarlet

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:09.179
hood when presiding over criminal cases.

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.720
But for civil cases, they often wore black
silk robes.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.510
When the judges in the American colonies presided
over legal proceedings, whether civil or criminal

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.540
cases, they carried over the English tradition
of wearing robes.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.090
This topic produced debate between Thomas
Jefferson and John Adams after the colonists

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.650
won the American Revolution and formed their
own government.

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.890
Jefferson argued that American judges should
distance themselves from the traditions set

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.460
down by the English and wear only a suit in
court.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:42.720
Adams, a lawyer, disagreed and wanted judges
to continue wearing the robes and wigs of

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.000
English judges.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.040
A compromise ensued, with it being decided
that the new American judges should wear the

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.520
robe and not the wig.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.600
Judges in the United States continue to wear
robes in the courtroom, despite the lack of

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.910
a rule requiring them to be worn.

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:02.250
Even in the Supreme Court of the United States,
there is no requirement that its justices

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.710
wear a robe in court.

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:08.240
Yet due to the tradition, and perhaps it being
something distinguishing from everyone else

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.400
in the courtroom, a mark of authority, judges
continue to wear them.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.540
Judges have been wearing robes for over seven
hundred years, after all.

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.160
Former Associate Justice of the Supreme Court
Sandra Day O’Connor admits that wearing

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.510
the robe may simply be a matter of tradition,
but she likes what it symbolizes.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.780
“It shows that all of us judges are engaged
in upholding the Constitution and the rule

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:31.780
of law…

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.820
We have a common responsibility.”

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:38.060
That is not to say that judges always wear
their robes or stick to the traditional black

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.060
robe.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:44.560
Judge ShawnDya L. Simpson of Manhattan, New
York has admitted to forgoing the robe altogether

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.390
in favor of a lime green suit on occasion.

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.510
Even when she wears her robe, she does not
always fasten all the buttons on it.

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.900
She also occasionally accents her robe by
wearing a scarf or a necklace.

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.540
Justice Bruce Allen of the New York State
Supreme Court usually leaves off his robe

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:01.620
while sitting at the bench.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:16.880
He generally only wears it when there is a
jury present in 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.070
the courtroom.
