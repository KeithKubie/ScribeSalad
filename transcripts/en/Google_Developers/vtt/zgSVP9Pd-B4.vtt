Google Apps Script is a cloud based development
platform for creating web applications.

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.049
With just a browser you can build scalable
web applications that integrate easily with

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:10.700
Google products.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.889
Apps Script uses a familiar JavaScript format,
so you can take what you know about web development

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:18.790
and what you know about Google products and
create something new really quick.

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:23.750
Google APIs and user interface tools are built
right into Apps Script as Services and the

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.420
Script Editor give you fast access to all
the services with code completion.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:29.970
Accustomed to editing HTML?

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.930
There’s an HTML Service you can use to make
templates and layouts.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.250
switch to GUI controls Or, if you’ve used
the Google Web Toolkit, you’ll recognize

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.760
the controls and layout panels available to
create robust interfaces.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.090
And, with the same library of Services you
can save data in Google Spreadsheets, connect

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.190
to external databases, or use the new ScriptDb
to create a JavaScript object store.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.789
When you’re ready to share your web application,
publish it as its own service with versioning

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:54.969
and sharable libraries.

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:59.069
Apps Script even has quick publishing to the
Chrome Web Store, where anyone can find, install,

00:00:59.069 --> 00:01:00.850
and use your web application.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.510
