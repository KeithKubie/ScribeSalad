00:00:11.246 --> 00:00:16.146
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Many people think of 4-H
clubs as kids with cows, but in fact,

00:00:16.536 --> 00:00:19.576
4-H has been a leader
in technology education

00:00:19.826 --> 00:00:21.956
since the early nineteen hundreds.

00:00:22.706 --> 00:00:26.206
Back then, adult farmers
resisted adopting new discoveries

00:00:26.206 --> 00:00:30.516
in agriculture, but educators found
that kids were eager to experiment,

00:00:30.906 --> 00:00:33.246
and would share the
new ideas with adults.

00:00:34.576 --> 00:00:38.946
4-H became a way to introduce new
agriculture technology to America.

00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:40.396
&gt;&gt;Cecilia: These ones.

00:00:41.946 --> 00:00:44.976
These ones right here.

00:00:45.046 --> 00:00:46.426
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Today, that
tradition continues

00:00:46.426 --> 00:00:48.226
in Washington County, Oregon.

00:00:49.306 --> 00:00:49.536
&gt;&gt;Luis: Testing.

00:00:50.116 --> 00:00:52.906
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Where one
prominent 4-H project is known

00:00:52.906 --> 00:00:55.696
as the Intel 4-H Tech Wizards.

00:00:55.806 --> 00:00:57.756
&gt;&gt;Student: Do you wanna
make it go fast, right?

00:00:57.876 --> 00:01:00.316
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Here, young people
are being introduced to careers

00:01:00.316 --> 00:01:05.986
in science and technology through
Lego robotics, video production,

00:01:07.186 --> 00:01:13.366
Web 2.0 and a geographic
information system community mapping.

00:01:13.366 --> 00:01:16.066
&gt;&gt;Student: -- practicamos
approximalamente una semana antes--

00:01:16.216 --> 00:01:18.776
&gt;&gt;Lisa: They learn skills
after school with us a couple

00:01:18.776 --> 00:01:21.596
of hours a week, and
fifty hours of content,

00:01:21.596 --> 00:01:24.076
actually, during a year's time.

00:01:24.136 --> 00:01:27.336
&gt;&gt;Cecilia: I told them that we're
gonna try and test the robot.

00:01:27.756 --> 00:01:29.316
&gt;&gt;Lisa: We have professionals
in the field

00:01:29.526 --> 00:01:31.186
who mentor the high school students

00:01:31.186 --> 00:01:35.496
and the high school students mentor
younger students in all kinds

00:01:35.496 --> 00:01:37.486
of topics that have
to do with science,

00:01:37.596 --> 00:01:39.036
technology, engineering or math.

00:01:39.416 --> 00:01:42.266
&gt;&gt;Student: We want it to move when
you clap, then it will do that.

00:01:43.066 --> 00:01:45.146
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The eighty
six percent drop out rate

00:01:45.146 --> 00:01:47.796
and under representation
in the fields of science

00:01:47.796 --> 00:01:51.886
and technology among Latino youth
motivated business, government

00:01:51.886 --> 00:01:54.686
and community groups to join with 4-H

00:01:54.686 --> 00:01:56.876
to create the program
in nineteen ninety nine.

00:01:56.876 --> 00:01:59.696
&gt;&gt;Teacher: [speaking Spanish].

00:02:00.196 --> 00:02:01.236
&gt;&gt;Lisa Conroy: All the programming

00:02:01.236 --> 00:02:04.566
that we do meets the
Oregon diploma requirements.

00:02:04.766 --> 00:02:07.796
It's workforce development,
but it's also exposure

00:02:07.796 --> 00:02:13.926
to careers and education pathways.

00:02:13.926 --> 00:02:14.566
&gt;&gt;Cecilia: [speaking Spanish].

00:02:14.566 --> 00:02:17.366
&gt;&gt;Narrator: For some students, the
program makes them feel at home

00:02:17.366 --> 00:02:19.766
in their schools for the first time.

00:02:19.766 --> 00:02:22.486
&gt;&gt;Lucy: I think especially
the newcomers feel

00:02:22.486 --> 00:02:25.026
like they're not part
of this institution.

00:02:25.286 --> 00:02:27.066
They come here to learn English.

00:02:27.066 --> 00:02:31.686
So a program like this, because
it's done in their native language,

00:02:31.926 --> 00:02:36.056
primarily, it allows
them that connection.

00:02:36.296 --> 00:02:38.706
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Schools identify
kids who might have an interest

00:02:38.706 --> 00:02:41.736
in the program, and
students apply to join.

00:02:42.066 --> 00:02:44.126
&gt;&gt;Lisa Conroy: It's a
combination of youth intra space,

00:02:44.596 --> 00:02:47.426
and then the community
comes forward with mentors,

00:02:47.426 --> 00:02:50.356
professional mentors,
and real world projects.

00:02:50.776 --> 00:02:53.126
And then, of course,
we spend some time

00:02:53.126 --> 00:02:54.976
in the classroom teaching skills.

00:02:55.126 --> 00:02:57.846
&gt;&gt;Cecilia: So if you wanna make
it stable, you need to-- yeah.

00:02:57.846 --> 00:03:01.086
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Students apply their new
skills to valuable community projects

00:03:01.086 --> 00:03:04.246
such as a street tree survey
for the city of Hillsboro,

00:03:04.576 --> 00:03:07.016
in which they use GIS technology

00:03:07.196 --> 00:03:10.266
to create a digital
inventory of the city's trees.

00:03:11.186 --> 00:03:14.846
&gt;&gt;Lisa: So we really have the
capability to have the kids see

00:03:15.206 --> 00:03:18.626
that what they learn is directly
connected to their communities,

00:03:18.626 --> 00:03:23.266
and that they can be a community
resource, engaging in that community,

00:03:23.436 --> 00:03:25.416
to make a difference in the future.

00:03:25.806 --> 00:03:27.296
&gt;&gt;Teacher: So we have
two computers right now.

00:03:27.296 --> 00:03:28.976
We're broadcasting live, [Spanish]--

00:03:29.096 --> 00:03:32.166
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Continuing
the 4-H tradition,

00:03:32.286 --> 00:03:37.976
students share their new ideas
and technology with adults.

00:03:37.976 --> 00:03:40.046
&gt;&gt;Luis: [spanish]

00:03:40.046 --> 00:03:43.846
&gt;&gt;Cecilia: We are celebrating
the achievements of the students,

00:03:43.946 --> 00:03:45.026
the high school students.

00:03:45.296 --> 00:03:48.886
They come here and they show
their projects to their parents.

00:03:49.276 --> 00:03:51.536
&gt;&gt;Luis: This right here, it's
got the brain of the robot.

00:03:51.536 --> 00:03:52.326
It's called the brick.

00:03:52.966 --> 00:03:55.186
And what the brick is, it
handles all the information.

00:03:55.186 --> 00:03:57.646
All the information of the
program is stored in the robot.

00:03:58.116 --> 00:04:01.956
&gt;&gt;Lisa: Ninety five percent of the
kids who are in our program graduate

00:04:01.956 --> 00:04:03.806
from high school, and
seventy percent of those go

00:04:03.806 --> 00:04:05.326
on to post high school education.

00:04:05.986 --> 00:04:09.146
And we're very proud of
the fact that fifty percent

00:04:09.546 --> 00:04:11.026
of the participants are females.

00:04:12.566 --> 00:04:15.186
&gt;&gt;Cecilia: We have a lot of support
from the parents in the community

00:04:15.186 --> 00:04:17.006
because they believe in the program

00:04:17.006 --> 00:04:20.486
and they see the changes
their children have made,

00:04:20.696 --> 00:04:21.806
and that tells a lot.

00:04:30.506 --> 00:04:32.656
