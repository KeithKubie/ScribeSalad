00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:10.889
So a major interest that we have in our
lab is understanding immunological memory

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.949
to the infections that we have gotten as
children or even as adults or the

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.470
vaccines that we get as children. Immunological memory is the ability of the

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.500
immune system to respond much faster
upon re-exposure to the same pathogen,

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.300
and that's the basis of vaccination.
So if you get as a child, you get a

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.290
polio vaccine or a measles or mumps
vaccination, then protected from

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.460
that disease for many, many years,
sometimes for life, and the reason for

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.559
that is because you've got memory -- you've 
got T-cells and B-cells that recognize

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.390
that pathogen and will protect you
immediately upon re-exposure to that pathogen.

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.670
So our lab has been interested
understanding how long-term immune

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.570
memory or immunologic memory is
maintained after either infection or vaccination.

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.790
So what we'll cover in my 
presentation today are four things.

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.700
First, I'll talk to you about logical
memory. Then I'll talk to you about

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.979
in particular the properties 
of memory T-cells --

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.820
what makes memory T-cells do what they
do, which is protect us from infections

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.820
or in rapid response, something
about the properties of memory T-cells.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.310
And then I will switch to what for us
was a very exciting line of research,

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.390
which is what happens if there's a
chronic infection so start with them

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.310
logical memory, then talk about
functional memory T-cells you get after

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.630
an acute infection or vaccination.
And then tell you about what happens if

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.939
there is a chronic, persistent antigenic
stimulus, as you have during chronic

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.950
infections or in the conditions of a
cancer, with the constant stimulation of a

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.990
humor antigen. And then I'll tell you
about a inhibitory receptor that

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.670
actually results in dysfunction of these
T-cells during a chronic infection or in

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.690
a tumor setting , so it's like a brake
that comes on and keeps them from being functional.

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.590
And then I'll talk to you
about how you can restore function in

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.150
these cells by releasing that
that brake. And then I'll end by the

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:24.750
clinical implications in treatment of
cancer of using the PD one directed immunotherapy.
