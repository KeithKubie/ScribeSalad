00:00:00.733 --> 00:00:03.737
( intro music )

00:00:06.505 --> 00:00:10.009
( applause )

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:11.443
Good evening.

00:00:11.443 --> 00:00:13.880 line:0%
Working for the
<i> National Geographic</i>

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.582 line:0%
has been the best
experience that I can imagine.

00:00:16.582 --> 00:00:19.518 line:0%
It's hard to translate
that into emotion

00:00:19.518 --> 00:00:21.420
to something other
people can understand.

00:00:21.887 --> 00:00:24.624
When I was growing
up, I was not the guy

00:00:24.624 --> 00:00:26.292
that people would
have expected

00:00:26.292 --> 00:00:28.962
to have the career
of his dreams.

00:00:28.962 --> 00:00:31.397
First, I was born
in Hays, Kansas.

00:00:31.397 --> 00:00:35.968
Which is not the intersection
of art, culture, and science.

00:00:35.968 --> 00:00:38.070
( audience laughter )

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.805
And on top of that

00:00:39.805 --> 00:00:41.908
school was really difficult.

00:00:42.942 --> 00:00:46.178
Not just hard,
but I was dyslexic.

00:00:46.178 --> 00:00:49.615
And I had a hard time
reading, writing,

00:00:49.615 --> 00:00:52.418
anything that had to do
with school, except for art,

00:00:52.418 --> 00:00:53.919
was difficult for me.

00:00:53.919 --> 00:00:56.589
And I have to think
back to a family trip

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:59.992
in 1975,
in Grand Lake, Colorado.

00:01:00.393 --> 00:01:04.330
I took my parents' camera,
I ran down to the lake

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.533
and I shot a picture
of a sailboat.

00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:10.503
<i> But for me it's ironic that I
 am essentially doing something</i>

00:01:10.503 --> 00:01:13.006
<i> to fill my time,
 that I was hooked.</i>

00:01:13.006 --> 00:01:16.175
So I was lucky.
I got to work at Kansas State

00:01:16.175 --> 00:01:18.878
at this great newspaper,
<i> The Collegian</i>.

00:01:18.878 --> 00:01:22.615
And then I got an internship
at<i>The Philadelphia Inquirer</i>.

00:01:23.116 --> 00:01:25.985
<i> So, I did a story about
 Greg Tutt, a boxer</i>

00:01:25.985 --> 00:01:28.721
<i> who trained in Joe Frazier's
 gym and worked really hard.</i>

00:01:28.721 --> 00:01:31.123
<i> I admired his dedication
 and his hard work.</i>

00:01:31.123 --> 00:01:32.825
<i> I remember the
 article really well.</i>

00:01:32.825 --> 00:01:34.493
<i> It ran in the Sunday magazine.</i>

00:01:34.493 --> 00:01:36.862
<i> It was written by a well-known
 writer, Steve Lopez.</i>

00:01:36.862 --> 00:01:39.232
<i> And the opening line
 of the story was</i>

00:01:39.232 --> 00:01:42.135
"Greg Tutt is walking
through a neighborhood

00:01:42.135 --> 00:01:45.304
that's going nowhere and
taking everybody with it."

00:01:45.304 --> 00:01:49.042
And, to me, you know I had to

00:01:49.042 --> 00:01:51.310
in a sense compete
on the same page

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.145
as people who could
write like that.

00:01:53.145 --> 00:01:57.884
So, it was very important to
me to work as hard as I could

00:01:57.884 --> 00:02:00.853
<i> to deserve a place
 at that table.</i>

00:02:00.853 --> 00:02:02.454
And working in
Philadelphia led me

00:02:02.454 --> 00:02:04.824
to another amazing opportunity.

00:02:04.824 --> 00:02:08.127
I'd always wanted to work
for<i>Sports Illustrated</i>.

00:02:08.127 --> 00:02:11.030
I'd done a lot of my
college work in sports.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.999
A guy named Buzz Bissinger

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:14.533
who was a writer at
<i> The Philadelphia Inquirer</i>

00:02:14.533 --> 00:02:16.702
won a Pulitzer,
and I had heard that

00:02:16.702 --> 00:02:18.804
he was leaving the
newspaper to go do a book

00:02:18.804 --> 00:02:21.373
about high school
football in Texas.

00:02:21.373 --> 00:02:23.609
And I went up and showed him
the work and I said, you know

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:26.179
<i> "You should hire me to go
 do that work for you."</i>

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:27.313
<i> And it worked out.</i>

00:02:27.313 --> 00:02:29.982
I moved to Odessa,
Texas for a while and

00:02:29.982 --> 00:02:32.551
shot pictures for a
book,<i>Friday Night Lights</i>,

00:02:32.551 --> 00:02:36.122
<i> which is, you know, turned
 into the TV show and the movie</i>

00:02:36.122 --> 00:02:37.557
<i> and all these things.</i>

00:02:37.557 --> 00:02:40.926
<i> We were looking at race, at
 the boom-bust cycle of oil,</i>

00:02:40.926 --> 00:02:42.428
<i> parents living
 through their kids.</i>

00:02:42.428 --> 00:02:44.731
<i> This is the quarterback of
 the team, Mike Winchell</i>

00:02:44.731 --> 00:02:46.232
<i> who is always
 kind of a loner</i>

00:02:46.232 --> 00:02:47.734
<i> because of all the
 pressure on him.</i>

00:02:47.734 --> 00:02:49.535
<i> And this is still one of
 my favorite pictures.</i>

00:02:49.535 --> 00:02:51.104
<i> Not just from that
 book but you know</i>

00:02:51.104 --> 00:02:52.872
<i> I really enjoyed
 this picture.</i>

00:02:52.872 --> 00:02:55.608
<i> They had 5:30 AM
 call for football</i>

00:02:55.608 --> 00:02:57.843
<i> five days a week,
 double practices.</i>

00:02:57.843 --> 00:03:00.713
<i> They worked harder
 than most people do.</i>

00:03:00.713 --> 00:03:02.048
<i> And then they lost.</i>

00:03:02.048 --> 00:03:05.318
<i> They lost to Midland Lee,
 their archrivals,</i>

00:03:05.318 --> 00:03:08.521
<i> which for me, a lot of
 my sports photography</i>

00:03:08.521 --> 00:03:10.623
<i> I enjoy the winning and
 the losing photos.</i>

00:03:10.623 --> 00:03:13.659
<i> I like action pictures,
 but I was kind of</i>

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:16.462
<i> always more drawn to the
 emotion in the pictures.</i>

00:03:17.797 --> 00:03:20.500
But also there is a serious side
to some of the work I was doing.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.301
I live in
Williamsburg, Brooklyn

00:03:22.301 --> 00:03:24.703
and I was getting ready to
leave the country on the 12th

00:03:24.703 --> 00:03:28.273
for a trip to Thailand for...

00:03:28.273 --> 00:03:29.441
for a story for the magazine.

00:03:29.441 --> 00:03:32.312
And, you know, I got a
call from my fiancÃ©e

00:03:32.312 --> 00:03:35.914
and she said, "a plane hit
the World Trade Center."

00:03:35.914 --> 00:03:37.883
And I looked at the
building, and I could--

00:03:37.883 --> 00:03:39.785
I actually had a view of that.

00:03:39.785 --> 00:03:41.788
So I ran to the roof
of my building.

00:03:41.788 --> 00:03:45.324
I got to the roof at
like, 8:58 or so.

00:03:45.557 --> 00:03:48.327
<i> And, you know, I was just
 composing the picture</i>

00:03:48.327 --> 00:03:51.431
<i> with the smoke going downtown.</i>

00:03:51.431 --> 00:03:53.432
<i> These are...</i>

00:03:53.432 --> 00:03:57.604
<i> pictures I shot that
 ran in</i>TIME<i>magazine.</i>

00:03:59.037 --> 00:04:00.939
<i> I am very conflicted
 about these images</i>

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:03.075
<i> but it is a very big
 part of my career.</i>

00:04:03.075 --> 00:04:05.344
<i> I'm glad that I did
 my job correctly.</i>

00:04:05.344 --> 00:04:08.280
<i> This horrible situation, it's
 a horrible thing to watch.</i>

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.849
But I do realize they're
important pictures

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:11.684
and I'm happy that
I've done work

00:04:11.684 --> 00:04:14.520
that is now in
history books.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:19.292
And... I had some pictures in
a book about war photography

00:04:19.292 --> 00:04:23.763
and exhibited at the Corcoran,
there's a film and there's a...

00:04:23.763 --> 00:04:27.567
military historian talking
about my pictures and he said

00:04:27.567 --> 00:04:30.069
and I hadn't thought about it
this way at all, he said that

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:34.040
"it's very rare that you have
a picture of a war starting."
