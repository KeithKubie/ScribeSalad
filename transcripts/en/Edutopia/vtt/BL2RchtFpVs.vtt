00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:09.926
&gt;&gt;Frankie: Good evening.

00:00:10.496 --> 00:00:15.526
I'd like to welcome you to our
Fifth Annual Technology Fair.

00:00:15.836 --> 00:00:16.536
We're so happy--

00:00:16.536 --> 00:00:18.276
&gt;&gt;Narrator: There's a packed
house tonight at this K

00:00:18.276 --> 00:00:21.396
through eighth grade school,
60 miles south of Miami.

00:00:22.036 --> 00:00:24.116
&gt;&gt;Frankie: It's going to be
a very exciting night for us.

00:00:24.296 --> 00:00:27.486
We're doing something a little
different with our technology fair.

00:00:27.486 --> 00:00:29.646
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Key Largo students
and their teachers are eager

00:00:29.646 --> 00:00:32.306
to show off the technology
they've been learning to master

00:00:32.306 --> 00:00:32.936
over the past few months.

00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:38.876
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Five, four,
three, two, one.

00:00:38.876 --> 00:00:40.066
[Cheering].

00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:42.576
&gt;&gt;Narrator: There's everything
from handcrafted racing cars

00:00:42.576 --> 00:00:45.196
to handheld global
positioning devices.

00:00:45.196 --> 00:00:48.966
&gt;&gt;Student: Mr. Tagarini went out
on the nature trail with his GPS,

00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:51.376
and he marked spots
and took pictures.

00:00:51.376 --> 00:00:54.726
And if you click on each of these
dots where he put on the GPS,

00:00:54.726 --> 00:00:58.276
if you click on one, it shows
the picture of where he was,

00:00:58.586 --> 00:01:01.126
so this is latitude and longitude,

00:01:01.676 --> 00:01:04.286
and basically descriptions
of what each picture is.

00:01:04.346 --> 00:01:05.586
So that's what--

00:01:05.586 --> 00:01:08.036
&gt;&gt;Frankie: Our kids that are in
kindergarten, most of the jobs

00:01:08.036 --> 00:01:10.366
that they're going to do when
they graduate from high school,

00:01:10.366 --> 00:01:11.466
haven't even been invented.

00:01:11.846 --> 00:01:15.676
So if we're going to do what we need
to do in education for our kids,

00:01:15.676 --> 00:01:17.646
we need to be pursuing technology.

00:01:18.396 --> 00:01:21.076
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The pursuit of
technology here has been facilitated

00:01:21.116 --> 00:01:25.146
by several grants and a half
cent county sales tax increase,

00:01:25.526 --> 00:01:28.226
reflecting the community's
commitment to technology

00:01:28.536 --> 00:01:30.016
and student centered learning.

00:01:30.236 --> 00:01:32.746
&gt;&gt;Michele: All right, so you're
sure you don't want that in there.

00:01:32.746 --> 00:01:34.036
&gt;&gt;Student: Yeah, I'm fine with that.

00:01:34.286 --> 00:01:36.536
&gt;&gt;Michele: With this kind of
technology, it's the kind of thing

00:01:36.536 --> 00:01:37.766
that you just have
to trial and error.

00:01:38.116 --> 00:01:39.496
You've got to get on
and play and play

00:01:39.546 --> 00:01:40.966
and play until you figure it out.

00:01:41.046 --> 00:01:42.876
&gt;&gt;Student: So, Victoria, move
out of the way for a minute,

00:01:42.876 --> 00:01:43.766
so I can focus the camera.

00:01:43.946 --> 00:01:44.266
Thanks.

00:01:44.716 --> 00:01:46.926
&gt;&gt;Michele: This class
brings the kids together.

00:01:46.926 --> 00:01:51.436
They have to learn to work socially
with other kids, so that's a big part

00:01:51.506 --> 00:01:53.996
of it is just motivation and
initiative, and working together

00:01:53.996 --> 00:01:57.096
in a group, and that's going to
help them out in life always.

00:01:57.796 --> 00:02:00.616
&gt;&gt;Narrator: While technology
plays a major role at the school,

00:02:00.836 --> 00:02:04.286
it is just part of Key Largo's
curriculum, which is based

00:02:04.286 --> 00:02:06.796
on an understanding
of how people learn.

00:02:07.206 --> 00:02:09.846
&gt;&gt;Frankie: If you know how people
learn, then you can be a better

00:02:09.846 --> 00:02:10.896
and more effective teacher.

00:02:11.706 --> 00:02:14.826
So we are taking those principles
and trying to incorporate them

00:02:14.826 --> 00:02:15.866
into our teaching styles.

00:02:16.066 --> 00:02:18.266
&gt;&gt;Teacher: You're going
to want a little generator

00:02:18.266 --> 00:02:19.676
that has a gas chamber.

00:02:20.696 --> 00:02:22.216
&gt;&gt;Frankie: Things like
prior knowledge,

00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:24.256
when you're teaching a lesson,

00:02:24.256 --> 00:02:26.866
are you really seeing what
the kids' prior knowledge is,

00:02:26.896 --> 00:02:30.216
so all the kids are on the same page,
so if they have any false beliefs,

00:02:30.216 --> 00:02:31.606
you can take care of that up front.

00:02:31.606 --> 00:02:33.456
&gt;&gt;Student: So they're going to
need, like an air conditioner

00:02:33.456 --> 00:02:35.476
to let all the gases out?

00:02:35.696 --> 00:02:37.666
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Yeah, a lot like that.

00:02:38.056 --> 00:02:44.296
&gt;&gt;Teacher: First set of directions
is, draw a bird in the center

00:02:44.296 --> 00:02:46.206
of your card, your favorite bird.

00:02:46.836 --> 00:02:49.366
&gt;&gt;Frankie: It's also based on
teaching, so there's learning

00:02:49.366 --> 00:02:52.276
with understanding, and that
means that you create some kind

00:02:52.276 --> 00:02:55.056
of a mental model for a
child to help them learn.

00:02:55.246 --> 00:02:58.466
They are able to learn so well that
they can transfer what they learn

00:02:58.746 --> 00:03:02.386
to other core subject areas, to
other things they're doing in life.

00:03:02.566 --> 00:03:04.976
And so the-- you have to be sure

00:03:04.976 --> 00:03:06.646
that kids really understand
what they're learning.

00:03:06.646 --> 00:03:08.596
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Take your pencil
and go like this real fast,

00:03:08.776 --> 00:03:09.986
and tell me what you see.

00:03:10.626 --> 00:03:11.326
What do you see, anybody?

00:03:11.326 --> 00:03:12.986
A bird in a cage, does anybody else--

00:03:12.986 --> 00:03:15.636
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In this English
class, a simple exercise

00:03:15.636 --> 00:03:18.916
in following directions
becomes a firsthand encounter

00:03:18.916 --> 00:03:21.476
with the concept of cause and effect.

00:03:21.476 --> 00:03:22.536
&gt;&gt;Teacher: So there's a cause,

00:03:22.576 --> 00:03:24.786
the cause is following
the directions just right,

00:03:24.956 --> 00:03:28.046
and then there's an effect, which
was whatever happened to the bird.

00:03:28.046 --> 00:03:30.486
And if you did it correctly, the
bird is in the cage, if you didn't,

00:03:30.486 --> 00:03:32.046
do it so correct-- do it right,

00:03:32.346 --> 00:03:33.996
then the bird is somewhere
outside the cage, right?

00:03:34.866 --> 00:03:36.956
Right. Now what is it
that we do in this class?

00:03:37.396 --> 00:03:37.486
&gt;&gt;Student: Read.

00:03:38.376 --> 00:03:41.716
&gt;&gt;Teacher: We read; so we're
going to learn how cause

00:03:41.716 --> 00:03:44.316
and effect is important for
reading, because that's a way

00:03:44.316 --> 00:03:46.266
that an author organizes information.

00:03:46.266 --> 00:03:47.886
&gt;&gt;Student: What else could it be?

00:03:48.116 --> 00:03:49.536
&gt;&gt;Student: Hair gel.

00:03:49.876 --> 00:03:51.806
&gt;&gt;Student: Hair gel.

00:03:51.806 --> 00:03:54.866
&gt;&gt;Frankie: Kids should be comfortable
in the classroom, they should be able

00:03:54.866 --> 00:03:57.856
to work together, problem
solve, those kinds of things,

00:03:57.856 --> 00:04:00.756
and it fits so well with what
we believe at Key Largo school,

00:04:00.786 --> 00:04:05.636
because we believe education is much
more than test score accountability.

00:04:06.136 --> 00:04:07.506
&gt;&gt;Student: Is it about even?

00:04:07.566 --> 00:04:08.826
&gt;&gt;Student: It's perfect, it's done.

00:04:09.466 --> 00:04:12.276
&gt;&gt;Narrator: To help each child
achieve their full potential,

00:04:12.456 --> 00:04:16.486
Key Largo tailors instruction
methods and the physical environment

00:04:16.666 --> 00:04:18.856
to a student's individual
learning style.

00:04:19.516 --> 00:04:21.346
&gt;&gt;Frankie: Part of the
brain research tells us

00:04:21.386 --> 00:04:23.556
that children have
different learning styles.

00:04:24.006 --> 00:04:27.536
And that if we want them to do
the very best they can, in life,

00:04:27.586 --> 00:04:29.646
in school, then we, as educators,

00:04:29.646 --> 00:04:32.076
need to tend to what
their learning styles are.

00:04:32.366 --> 00:04:33.346
&gt;&gt;Jo Ann: What are you researching?

00:04:33.566 --> 00:04:34.036
&gt;&gt;Student: Pottery.

00:04:34.366 --> 00:04:35.886
&gt;&gt;Jo Ann: Pottery, okay, all right,

00:04:35.956 --> 00:04:37.516
so you want to put
Pottery as your title.

00:04:38.356 --> 00:04:43.116
&gt;&gt;Frankie: There are 21 elements
that we're looking at, from whether

00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:48.106
or not they need the light to be
bright or dim, whether they need lots

00:04:48.106 --> 00:04:50.806
of sound, or they need no sound,
whether they need it to be warm,

00:04:50.806 --> 00:04:51.996
or whether they need to be cool.

00:04:52.216 --> 00:04:56.686
If we, then, in our teaching styles,
attend to those, research shows

00:04:56.736 --> 00:04:58.606
that the students are going
to do better in school.

00:04:59.596 --> 00:05:01.326
&gt;&gt;Jo Ann: The lighting in
here is a little different,

00:05:01.326 --> 00:05:05.526
because a lot of the children that
I have are a little hyperactive.

00:05:06.086 --> 00:05:09.076
And I felt we needed something
that was a little more subdued,

00:05:09.076 --> 00:05:14.506
a little bit quieter and calmer,
and I do find that the children seem

00:05:14.506 --> 00:05:17.186
to work a little bit better
with the dimmed lighting.

00:05:18.166 --> 00:05:20.106
&gt;&gt;Frankie: One of the things
I love about Key Largo School,

00:05:20.106 --> 00:05:21.736
is that the teachers
are real risk takers.

00:05:22.246 --> 00:05:23.146
I encourage that.

00:05:23.236 --> 00:05:25.176
I'm a risk taker, I want
them to be a risk taker.

00:05:25.176 --> 00:05:27.446
You can't have educational
reform unless you're willing

00:05:27.446 --> 00:05:28.356
to try new things.

00:05:29.056 --> 00:05:29.576
&gt;&gt;Jeanne: Lessons.

00:05:30.786 --> 00:05:32.746
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Jeannie Kurth
has been trying new things

00:05:32.746 --> 00:05:35.366
in her eighth grade classroom
for more than a decade,

00:05:35.886 --> 00:05:37.476
and this alternative ed class,

00:05:37.656 --> 00:05:41.166
students warm up with a
series of brain gym exercises.

00:05:42.726 --> 00:05:42.966
&gt;&gt;Jeanne: Tree.

00:05:45.896 --> 00:05:49.946
&gt;&gt;Narrator: They sit in bean bags,
or on couches, under subdued light,

00:05:49.946 --> 00:05:51.766
listening to a water sound machine.

00:05:52.616 --> 00:05:56.006
Kurth insists that this unique
environment is a big part

00:05:56.316 --> 00:06:00.016
of why these at risk students
become better than average learners.

00:06:00.366 --> 00:06:01.996
&gt;&gt;Jeanne: When they
come into this room,

00:06:01.996 --> 00:06:05.906
and they sit down for the first
day, and I look around the room,

00:06:06.156 --> 00:06:11.146
eyes are here, they're there, the
slouching, the carrying on, I know,

00:06:11.146 --> 00:06:14.746
okay, I've got my work
cut out for me.

00:06:14.926 --> 00:06:18.496
I've got 180 days to
change their lives.

00:06:19.786 --> 00:06:24.756
And I do it, number one,
through brain gym, number two,

00:06:24.916 --> 00:06:30.506
through classroom environment,
number three, through the way I go

00:06:30.576 --> 00:06:32.056
through my five subject areas.

00:06:32.366 --> 00:06:36.756
&gt;&gt;Now notice we've
got ourselves a title.

00:06:37.356 --> 00:06:39.476
&gt;&gt;And for kids who
have a problem seeing,

00:06:40.266 --> 00:06:44.366
I have two large overheads here,
so that I can blow the information

00:06:44.366 --> 00:06:47.966
up real large, it's a very good eye
catcher for your visual learner.

00:06:47.966 --> 00:06:49.966
&gt;&gt;Now, if you're doing
a double line graph,

00:06:50.766 --> 00:06:52.866
your lines can't both be straight.

00:06:54.146 --> 00:06:57.336
&gt;&gt;What keeps me coming to work
every day and keeps me enthusiastic

00:06:57.436 --> 00:07:01.476
that I'm on the right track, is the
fact that I get children in here,

00:07:01.546 --> 00:07:06.026
say, functioning on a 30 percentile
who jump to 60, or I have a kid who's

00:07:06.026 --> 00:07:09.036
at 90 percentile and jumps to 96.

00:07:09.036 --> 00:07:11.356
&gt;&gt;Bye, have a good
weekend, my dear friends.

00:07:11.356 --> 00:07:13.216
You did marvelous, I'm proud of you.

00:07:13.216 --> 00:07:15.666
&gt;&gt;And I know they're going
to knock the socks off

00:07:15.666 --> 00:07:19.456
of the SATs and the FCATs.

00:07:19.626 --> 00:07:19.726
&gt;&gt;Yes.

00:07:19.916 --> 00:07:22.176
&gt;&gt;Frankie: And I think that people
that come in from the outside,

00:07:22.176 --> 00:07:25.396
they see this family feeling that
we have, it's a very nurturing kind

00:07:25.396 --> 00:07:28.156
of campus, but they also
see that there are a lot

00:07:28.156 --> 00:07:31.606
of unique things going on here,
and that does take risk on the part

00:07:31.606 --> 00:07:33.636
of the leaders, on the
part of the teachers,

00:07:33.636 --> 00:07:34.586
and on the part of the kids.

00:07:34.846 --> 00:07:35.546
&gt;&gt;Student: Stick it in there.

00:07:36.826 --> 00:07:39.366
Cover it, and count to three.

00:07:39.986 --> 00:07:41.126
&gt;&gt;Frankie: We have younger kids

00:07:41.356 --> 00:07:44.136
and older kids working
together on lots of projects.

00:07:44.596 --> 00:07:47.486
We have alternative programs
that are theme based,

00:07:47.486 --> 00:07:51.516
for kids who are having difficulty
with academics, that will excite them

00:07:51.516 --> 00:07:52.616
and get them to come to school.

00:07:52.746 --> 00:07:53.606
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Where's Oscar?

00:07:53.946 --> 00:08:00.406
&gt;&gt;Oscar: One half teaspoon
Worcet-- Worcestershire Sauce.

00:08:00.686 --> 00:08:03.006
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Worcestershire,
shire-- sauce.

00:08:03.276 --> 00:08:05.626
&gt;&gt;Frankie: We have a fourth
and fifth combination program,

00:08:05.796 --> 00:08:09.436
and in that program, the kids
make healthy foods that they sell

00:08:09.726 --> 00:08:10.706
to the teachers in the school.

00:08:10.706 --> 00:08:14.086
&gt;&gt;Student: We learn how to cook,
and a lot of us want to be chefs

00:08:14.086 --> 00:08:17.566
when we grow up, and we learn
how to do science stuff.

00:08:17.566 --> 00:08:19.086
We do a lot of projects.

00:08:19.446 --> 00:08:21.476
&gt;&gt;Frankie: In sixth
grade, it is horticulture.

00:08:22.056 --> 00:08:25.566
We have our own greenhouse, and so
the children learn how to landscape,

00:08:25.626 --> 00:08:28.896
take care of plants, and they also
learn something about nutrition.

00:08:29.316 --> 00:08:32.056
&gt;&gt;Student: Every class time we
come out here, we get the hose

00:08:32.056 --> 00:08:33.656
and water them, or we turn

00:08:33.656 --> 00:08:35.526
on the overhead sprinkler
that we have built in.

00:08:35.696 --> 00:08:40.506
I think I'll try to start my
own plant shop or something,

00:08:40.506 --> 00:08:44.676
and try to sell them, because
I really like doing this.

00:08:44.676 --> 00:08:46.576
&gt;&gt;Frankie: Seventh grade is WWKLS.

00:08:46.906 --> 00:08:48.796
&gt;&gt;Teacher: You have two
minutes to sign on, DJs.

00:08:48.796 --> 00:08:51.796
Two minutes, get to
work, research right.

00:08:52.536 --> 00:08:55.156
&gt;&gt;Frankie: They run their
own little radio show here

00:08:55.156 --> 00:08:56.476
in the school every other day.

00:08:56.476 --> 00:09:01.336
That goes over our network, and
then they also do local PSAs

00:09:01.376 --> 00:09:02.786
for our local radio stations.

00:09:03.356 --> 00:09:06.796
&gt;&gt;Student: Good morning, you're
tuned in to WWKLS Communications,

00:09:06.916 --> 00:09:08.456
coming to you live from Channel Five.

00:09:08.866 --> 00:09:10.346
&gt;&gt;Student: How's everybody
doing today?

00:09:10.346 --> 00:09:13.466
&gt;&gt;Narrator: By taking risks and
teaching students how to learn,

00:09:13.466 --> 00:09:17.296
rather than simply how to pass
a test, Key Largo has managed

00:09:17.296 --> 00:09:20.136
to earn top marks on
Florida's standardized tests.

00:09:20.706 --> 00:09:22.686
But for Principal Frankie St. James,

00:09:22.736 --> 00:09:26.236
the real reward is seeing her
students experience the joy

00:09:26.236 --> 00:09:26.516
of learning.

00:09:27.476 --> 00:09:30.086
&gt;&gt;Frankie: One of the reasons that
I'm here is because I love kids.

00:09:30.726 --> 00:09:32.766
And I like to see that
spark in the kids

00:09:32.966 --> 00:09:34.846
and to see the fruits of my labor.

00:09:34.846 --> 00:09:36.466
And I can see that through kids.

00:09:37.456 --> 00:09:42.696
&gt;&gt;All right, let's look
into world news, okay?

00:09:44.026 --> 00:09:45.226
