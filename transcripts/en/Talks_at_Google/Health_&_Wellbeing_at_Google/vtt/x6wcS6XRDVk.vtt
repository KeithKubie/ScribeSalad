SPEAKER 1: Today
at Google, we are

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:13.470
delighted to welcome Latha
Palaniappan and Deepa Prahalad.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.790
Dr. Palaniappan is a Professor
of Medicine at Stanford,

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:24.910
where for the last 20 years,
she has studied and worked

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:30.430
on cardiovascular disease
and diabetes in South Asians.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.580
Ms. Prahalad comes from
a management consulting

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.370
background specializing
in emerging markets,

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.590
and is now on the
board of Arogya World,

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.050
where she focuses on
growth and design.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.340
And she wrote a book titled
"Predictable Magic," which

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.170
attempts to unite strategy
and design thinking.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.150
They are here today
to discuss their work

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.650
at Arogya World, a global health
nonprofit organization working

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.670
to prevent non-communicable
diseases, e.g. diabetes, heart

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.239
disease, cancer, and
chronic lung diseases

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.510
through health education
and lifestyle change.

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.020
Please join me in welcoming
to Google Latha Palaniappan

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.884
and Deepa Prahalad.

00:01:12.884 --> 00:01:24.460
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.920
LATHA PALANIAPPAN: Thank
you for coming out today.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.380
I'm going to tell you a
little bit about myself.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.260
My name's Latha Palaniappan.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.450
I'm currently a Professor
of Medicine at Stanford.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.030
I spend most of my
time doing research

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.410
in heart disease and diabetes.

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.040
I do work on electronic health
records, mortality records.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.440
And I do clinical trials
in Type 2 diabetes,

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.360
trying to promote
physical activity

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.570
in people with Type 2 diabetes.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.420
And I teach first-year medical
student population health.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.360
So that's how to take care
of large groups of people.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.370
And I also see patients in
Stanford's Executive Medicine

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.940
program.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.740
And we're trying to start a
genetic and pharmacogenetic

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.870
testing program there to bring
evidence-based genetic testing.

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:12.940
So I want to, before
we start today,

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.910
have us think a little
bit about diabetes.

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.110
And I'm going to be presenting
some statistics on diabetes

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.190
around the world.

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.990
But if you could think for a
moment why you think diabetes

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.720
is increasing so
much in prevalence.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.690
Now, you probably have
heard in the papers

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.720
that diabetes is increasing.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.620
And I wonder if
anyone in the audience

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.030
has any thoughts on that.

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.640
Maybe what brought
you here today?

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.110
If you have a family
member with diabetes.

00:02:45.336 --> 00:02:47.240
AUDIENCE: Standard
American diet.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.250
LATHA PALANIAPPAN:
Standard American diet.

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.890
Any more color to that?

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.652
What is the standard
American diet?

00:02:53.652 --> 00:02:55.060
AUDIENCE: Too much
sugar and fat.

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.810
LATHA PALANIAPPAN: Too
much sugar and fat.

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.690
And in fact, one of my
colleagues at Stanford

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.170
recently wrote a paper that
was published in "JAMA" showing

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:07.030
that both low-fat and
low-carb diets, when healthy,

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.170
promoted weight loss.

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.600
So that kind of put an end to
the low-carb/low-fat debate,

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:14.260
I hope.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.850
I think we will
continue to debate

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.580
about that because people
feel that certain diets work

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.790
for them more than another.

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.065
But it did show in the end
that a calorie is a calorie.

00:03:25.065 --> 00:03:26.440
And having the
appropriate amount

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.530
of calories for
your body size is

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.980
helpful for maintaining
a healthy weight

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.970
and preventing chronic
diseases in general.

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:36.550
OK.

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.640
So let's talk about the
global epidemic of diabetes.

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.910
And particularly,
what we're trying

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.720
to do in preventing
this epidemic.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.360
So this is a graph of
diabetes cases in the US.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.910
So you can see, the US--

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:53.290
around the world and in the US.

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.240
So you can see in
the US in green,

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.730
there are 37 million
cases of diabetes.

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.030
And the black part
on the side shows you

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.280
what percentage is undiagnosed.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.410
So you can see in different
areas of the world,

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:09.130
there are different proportions
of undiagnosed diabetes.

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.550
And I hope that
you in the audience

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:16.930
have gotten tested for diabetes.

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.293
But can anyone tell me
how we test for diabetes?

00:04:21.293 --> 00:04:23.650
AUDIENCE: Something to do
with insulin and blood sugar.

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.030
LATHA PALANIAPPAN:
Insulin and blood sugar.

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.720
Great answer.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.580
So that's the absolute
correct answer.

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.410
So we try to check
your blood sugar.

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.730
So we check either
a fasting number

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:36.430
in the morning of
your blood sugar,

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:40.540
or what we call a glycosolated
hemoglobin, hemoglobin A1c.

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.860
Because as we have more
glucose in our bodies,

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.830
it attaches onto our hemoglobin.

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.715
And we can measure those levels.

00:04:46.715 --> 00:04:48.340
And then, another
way that we can do it

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.850
is through an oral
glucose tolerance test.

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:56.780
And that's sort of
drinking a glucose load,

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.930
and then checking your
glucose after two hours

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.480
to see how your body
processes glucose.

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.940
So all of these things,
you can imagine,

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.210
are a little hard to do because
they involve blood tests

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.190
in resource-limited settings.

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.130
So I hope in partnership
with technology companies

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:15.490
like Google, that we'll
be able to improve

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.460
the diagnosis of
diabetes, and be

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.810
able to do it without expensive
blood tests going forward.

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.420
So you can see in the
world, 382 million people

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:26.890
are living with diabetes.

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:30.490
And about half of
those are diagnosed

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:33.531
and half are undiagnosed.

00:05:33.531 --> 00:05:34.030
OK.

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:37.450
So the top 10 countries by
number of diabetes cases.

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:41.590
So the top countries
are China and India.

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:45.680
The prevalence of diabetes
is about the same.

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.510
So about 10%.

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:51.610
It ranges in these
countries from 7% to 14%,

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.700
depending on if
you're urban or rural,

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:58.520
and what your familial
risk factors are.

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.700
And the reason that
the number of cases

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:02.920
are so high in
China and India is

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.770
because the absolute number
of people are so high right.

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:08.980
In China, India, they're our
largest countries in the world.

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:13.470
And so you can see
the US is third there.

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:14.440
A distant third.

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.290
And the number of cases
of diabetes in the US

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:20.540
are increasing as well.

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:23.620
And the greatest
projected increase

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.030
is in the Western Pacific.

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:30.830
So China, Korea, Japan Vietnam,
Indonesia, and Australia.

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:32.290
The number of
cases are projected

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:34.330
to increase by about 50%.

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:45.270
And this is just a graph
showing the economic background

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:46.120
of these countries.

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:49.890
So high income is yellow,
upper middle is orange,

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:54.480
lower middle is pink,
and low income is red.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:58.140
And so you can see there
again, that the proportion

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:02.670
of undiagnosed changes depending
on the economic background

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:06.090
and situation of
those countries.

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:09.450
With a really high proportion
undiagnosed, again,

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:11.850
in India and China.

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:15.910
And the high-income countries
having a little bit less

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:18.390
undiagnosed, but still a
significant proportion.

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:20.670
Even in the US, we have
a significant proportion

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:23.940
of undiagnosed diabetes,
simply because people aren't

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:25.480
going in and getting tested.

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:27.480
And it does take some
effort to go ahead and get

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:30.030
tested for Type 2 diabetes.

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:33.210
And Asia represents about 60%
of the diabetic populations

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:35.470
worldwide.

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:35.970
OK.

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:41.340
So we are focusing today
particularly on South Asia.

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:43.080
And this is--

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:44.970
Dr. Prahalad, who
will speak after me,

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:49.770
is the purpose of the
nonprofit reducing diabetes

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:53.640
in South Asia, which has a
particularly high prevalence

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:54.350
of diabetes.

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:56.280
So this is a map of South Asia.

00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:00.570
We commonly think of India
representing South Asia.

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:02.520
And it is a major part
of the subcontinent.

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:06.310
And 90% of the South Asians
in California are from India.

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:10.290
But also, South Asians are
from Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan,

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:13.650
and Bangladesh, and
Sri Lanka as well.

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:17.160
And this is a map
of the Bay Area

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:20.880
of the Census in this area,
and what percent of people

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:23.250
are Asian Indian by county.

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:26.280
So you can see
there, particularly

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:29.160
around Alameda in the
Fremont area particularly,

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.260
it's about 10% Asian Indians.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.929
So 1 out of 10 people
are South Asian.

00:08:33.929 --> 00:08:39.720
And in Santa Clara, where we are
now, about 1 out of 15 people

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:42.809
are Asian Indian.

00:08:42.809 --> 00:08:45.540
So this is a study I
did earlier in my career

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:48.480
looking at mortality
records of California,

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:51.900
and looking at
coronary heart disease.

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:54.450
Because diabetes is a risk
factor for heart disease

00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:59.160
and diabetes prevalence is so
much higher in South Asians,

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.970
particularly among
young Indian men.

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:03.840
So 25 to 44.

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:07.560
Their risk of heart disease is
almost three times as high-- so

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.300
that tall red bar.

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:10.810
Compared to the
total population,

00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:14.070
which is in green, the
non-Hispanic white population

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:17.110
in orange, the Hispanic
population in blue,

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:19.770
the African American or
black population in brown,

00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:21.780
and the Chinese
population in blue,

00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:23.880
and Japanese population
in yellow there.

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:26.950
And the Indian
population is in red.

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:29.610
And what got me into
the business that I'm in

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:32.790
is that my father died
of a heart attack at 39.

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:35.070
I grew up in Michigan and
lived there at the time,

00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:37.890
but he represented that
three times higher risk

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:40.840
in the young men 25 to 44.

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:46.410
So I encourage you, if you
know of anyone in this race

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:49.590
ethnic group, they're at
particularly high risk

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:52.290
for heart disease
and should be tested

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:55.570
for diabetes and other risk
factors for heart disease.

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:59.610
So this is another study that
I did using data from Palo Alto

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:01.620
Medical Foundation.

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:04.260
So we collected race
ethnic information

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.570
at Palo Alto Medical
Foundation, because it is so

00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:08.220
highly prevalently Asian.

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:10.500
So the Bay Area is
about 30% Asian,

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:12.120
and it has good
representation of all

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:14.790
of these Asian subgroups.

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:18.480
Anyone here get their care from
Paul Alto Medical Foundation?

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:19.540
It's a great place.

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:20.790
It's a good place to get care.

00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:27.000
So you can see that all Asians
in general have higher odds.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.790
So this is the likelihood
of having diabetes

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:32.550
among that group compared to
non-Hispanic whites, about

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:33.600
double the risk.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.670
So men are on the
left, women are

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:37.650
on the right in all the arrows.

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:41.430
And the statistically
significant numbers

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:43.200
are in bold there.

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:45.720
So you can see that among
the Asian subgroups when

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:48.810
you aggregate them, there is
a higher risk of diabetes.

00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:50.820
And when you disaggregate
the Asian subgroups,

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:53.550
some groups have much higher
risk than other groups.

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:56.040
Namely, Asian Indians and
Filipinos in this case

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:58.050
have three to four
times the risk.

00:10:58.050 --> 00:11:00.420
And other Asian groups
also have higher risk,

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:04.470
like Chinese,
Japanese, and Korean.

00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:07.230
And these are all
age-adjusted as well

00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:11.820
given the slightly younger
age substructure of Asians

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:13.360
in the US.

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:13.860
OK.

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:20.310
So why do Asians and perhaps
Asian Indians in particular

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:23.650
have more risk of diabetes?

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:25.800
So this is a paper
that was published

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:30.240
in "Lancet" by two of the people
that I consider my mentors,

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:31.385
[INAUDIBLE].

00:11:31.385 --> 00:11:32.760
And they're at an
Indian wedding,

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:35.100
so you can see the
saris in the background.

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:39.890
And [INAUDIBLE] is the
non-Hispanic white researcher

00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:43.370
on your left and [INAUDIBLE]
is the Indian researcher

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:44.330
on your right.

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:47.450
And you can see that they have
an identical BMI, Body Mass

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:51.800
Index, of 22.3, but
their body fat--

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:56.380
and sorry, it's covered
there by the notation--

00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:57.410
the slide advancer.

00:11:57.410 --> 00:12:01.260
But it's three times as high
for the Indian researcher.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.550
It's about 9% versus 27%.

00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:08.710
So at an identical level of body
mass index, there's more fat.

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:11.230
And so next to them,
they have DEXA scans.

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:14.870
So these are scans that
we normally do for bone.

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:18.110
But you can also see fat
and muscle in those scans.

00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:20.990
And in a DEXA scan,
muscle is more white.

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:23.030
So you can see the
non-Hispanic white researcher

00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:23.880
has more muscle.

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:26.360
You can see it particularly
around the thighs,

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:27.890
in the abdominal area.

00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:29.960
Whereas, the Indian
researcher does,

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:32.790
it is more sort of
dark on that DEXA scan.

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:35.240
So that's indicative
of more fat.

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:40.790
So Asians-- based on data
like this and other work

00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:44.960
that I'll show you, the WHO
recommended a lower body

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:46.610
mass index cut point for Asians.

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:48.560
So it's 23 and lower.

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:53.000
And for non-Hispanic
whites, it's 25 and lower.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.880
So this is a study
that I did showing

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:59.490
that at similar levels
of body mass index,

00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:02.510
there is higher
risk of something

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:05.370
called metabolic syndrome,
which is pre-diabetes.

00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:08.570
It's a combination of
triglycerides, low HDL, which

00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:13.490
is the good cholesterol; high
glucose, obesity, as well as

00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:15.800
blood pressure greater
than 130 over 85.

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:20.660
So you can see on the x-axis,
on the horizontal axis,

00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:22.970
is the body mass indices.

00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:25.430
And on the y-axis
is the probability

00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:27.260
of having metabolic syndrome.

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:30.640
And Asian Indians
are on the red curve

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:33.660
and non-Hispanic whites
are on the blue curve.

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:37.000
And you can see that at every
level of body mass index,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.440
that Asian Indians
have higher probability

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:42.650
of having this pre-diabetes.

00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:46.730
And it is very difficult
to have a BMI of 23.

00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:50.270
At this moment, I stand in
front of you with a BMI of 23.

00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:54.250
But sometimes, on Mondays after
a weekend of lots of parties,

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:55.490
I gain 3 pounds.

00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:58.560
And I'm a very short
person, and my BMI is 24.

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:02.420
So it's very hard to
maintain that BMI of 23.

00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:05.180
But I have to do it because I
have to practice what I preach.

00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:10.650
So you can see here-- and this
is also from Palo Alto Medical

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:13.580
Foundation-- the
range of body mass

00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:16.190
index for non-Hispanic whites
on the left and Asian Indians

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:19.560
on the right, for women on
the left and men on the right.

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:25.400
And you can see that a BMI of
25 and higher-- so 50% of women

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:28.184
in the Palo Alto Medical
Foundation Electronic Health

00:14:28.184 --> 00:14:28.850
Record Database.

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:30.975
So there's about a million
people in that database.

00:14:30.975 --> 00:14:34.580
50% of non-Hispanic women
were at at-risk BMI.

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:37.640
And about 60% of
Asian Indian women

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:39.980
had a BMI of 23 and higher.

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:42.290
So we have a long way
to go to get people

00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:44.210
at the appropriate
level of weight.

00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:48.560
And for men, it was 8
out of 10 non-Hispanic

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:53.550
white men were not at the
appropriate or optimal weight.

00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:55.314
And 9 out of 10
Asian Indian men.

00:14:55.314 --> 00:14:57.230
So when I was at Palo
Alto Medical Foundation,

00:14:57.230 --> 00:15:00.650
I had a specific clinic
for South Asians.

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:06.200
And 9 out of 10 of the people
that I saw, we had to do work

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:10.470
to get them down to a
lower level of body weight.

00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:12.410
So when you go to
see your doctor,

00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:15.830
your doctor might use your
clinical data, including

00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:19.010
your gender and your HDL,
your good cholesterol,

00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:20.450
and your total cholesterol.

00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:22.640
And whether your blood
pressure is high or low

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:25.010
or whether or not
you smoke to estimate

00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:27.380
your risk of atherosclerotic
cardiovascular disease.

00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:30.080
This is called an
ASCVD risk calculator.

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:32.600
So one thing that I
want us to be aware of

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:34.940
is that these risk
calculators are mainly

00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:38.570
based on non-Hispanic
white European populations.

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:42.560
And they might underestimate
the risk in some groups,

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:44.300
such as South Asians.

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:46.880
I also do work in disaggregating
Hispanic subgroups.

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:51.260
So Puerto Ricans and Cubans
can also be underestimated.

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:56.270
So you should be aware that our
current risk calculators may

00:15:56.270 --> 00:15:58.172
not be accurate in all groups.

00:15:58.172 --> 00:15:59.630
And we should be
aware of what data

00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:02.240
was used to create
those risk predictions.

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:06.110
And I hope that with aggregating
larger and larger data sets,

00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:10.350
that we'll be able to
improve our risk prediction.

00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:10.850
OK.

00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:11.900
So what can we do?

00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:14.960
And Dr. Prahalad, who
will speak after me,

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:17.630
will speak a little bit
more about the nonprofit

00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:20.520
and what they are
doing specifically.

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:24.650
But you know, we heard that it's
sort of the Western lifestyle.

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:29.280
And you sort of hit it right on
the head with red meat, sugar,

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:36.790
sitting at a computer, smoking,
refined grains, traffic,

00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:38.860
alcohol, sort of
all of these things

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:45.100
that are contributing to
the diabetes epidemic.

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:48.970
But one thing that I want to
sort of point out in a point

00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:53.590
that I make is that
in rural areas that

00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:56.350
have agrarian lifestyles,
diabetes rates are actually

00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:58.440
quite low.

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:00.940
Subsistence farming
isn't a great way

00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:05.119
to live for a lot of reasons,
but diabetes is not very high.

00:17:05.119 --> 00:17:07.960
So people tend to have a lot
of physical activity, not

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:13.359
a lot of calories, not a lot of
trans fats or saturated fats.

00:17:13.359 --> 00:17:15.069
And diabetes rates are low.

00:17:15.069 --> 00:17:17.800
But then, when they go to
more of an urban lifestyle

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:22.030
with eating Big Macs and
fries, so high-fat diets as you

00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:24.579
mentioned, these
rates of diabetes

00:17:24.579 --> 00:17:26.950
and cardiovascular
disease can go up.

00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:30.250
But then, we get to
live, maybe in an area

00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:31.900
like we do in the
Bay Area, where

00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:35.620
we have access to
exercise, like SoulCycle,

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:39.550
and Orangetheory, and Pilates.

00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:45.880
And also, access to great
food, like Sprouts and--

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:48.190
I don't know. l think there
must be 10 different salad

00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:49.280
places here.

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:53.650
And so when we improve
our socioeconomic status

00:17:53.650 --> 00:17:56.380
in this country, we can
also lower diabetes rates.

00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:59.500
So in the US, people with
higher socioeconomic status

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:01.840
have lower diabetes rates.

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:03.850
And this is changing in
developing countries.

00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:06.850
But in general, people with
lower socioeconomic status

00:18:06.850 --> 00:18:09.920
in developing countries had
lower rates of diabetes.

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:12.340
And this is called the
epidemiologic transition,

00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:15.570
when you go to higher
socioeconomic status

00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:17.320
in developing countries
and have higher

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:18.400
rates of chronic disease.

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:21.930
But we're seeing that flip
a little bit now as well.

00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:24.700
But how can we avoid this
lifestyle transition?

00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:27.490
How can we in
developing countries

00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:32.980
go from this Agrarian
lifestyle to one in which we

00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:35.500
can translate to more--

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:40.490
higher SES in higher-income
countries' lifestyles?

00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:42.650
So I think there's
many ways to do this.

00:18:42.650 --> 00:18:46.649
And Dr. Prahalad will talk a
little bit more about these.

00:18:46.649 --> 00:18:48.940
And this is from a paper I
wrote for the American Heart

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:52.524
Association looking at the--

00:18:52.524 --> 00:18:54.940
it was called "The Community
Guide," about how communities

00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:56.960
can improve rates of diabetes.

00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:02.050
So there's many axes on legal,
community, as well as risk

00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:03.880
factors and early diagnoses.

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:07.360
So one of the things that we did
for diet was banned trans fats.

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:10.330
So many countries have
banned trans fats.

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:12.070
And that has helped.

00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:16.630
It has bent the curve in terms
of lowering diabetes rates.

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:17.990
Also, the sedentary lifestyle.

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:21.280
And I think Google has
been wonderful in providing

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:26.440
all the wonderful bikes
outside and other healthy--

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:27.610
encouraging healthy habits.

00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:32.050
I saw lots of fruit
available outside.

00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:36.670
And trying to decrease
even sitting at a computer.

00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:38.020
So getting up and taking breaks.

00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:39.910
I ask my patients
to do that a lot.

00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:42.400
It will go a long way
towards preventing diabetes

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:44.360
and other chronic disease.

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:44.860
Tobacco.

00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:47.770
So we don't have
tobacco advertising

00:19:47.770 --> 00:19:50.920
on our TV stations for
our kids to see in the US.

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:53.200
But this is something
that could be implemented

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:55.146
in developing countries.

00:19:55.146 --> 00:19:56.770
And unfortunately,
developing countries

00:19:56.770 --> 00:19:59.740
are the place that
the tobacco companies

00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:03.800
are going to advertise
more and get more smokers.

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:05.710
So that's something
that hopefully, we

00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:07.790
can prevent going forward.

00:20:07.790 --> 00:20:12.950
And treatment of high
blood pressure and lipids.

00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:14.820
So guidelines on how
to screen for this.

00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:16.660
I talked a little
bit about that.

00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:20.350
As well as early recognition
of symptomatic disease,

00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:22.720
perhaps with screening
with coronary artery

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:26.510
calcium and other newer
biomarkers that are coming out.

00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:29.830
So I think we've come
a long way in the US.

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:31.780
I think that we
have learned lessons

00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:35.410
here that would be great to
transmit to other developing

00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:36.370
countries.

00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:39.219
And I'm looking forward
to hearing more about

00:20:39.219 --> 00:20:40.010
how we can do that.

00:20:43.461 --> 00:20:50.967
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:50.967 --> 00:20:52.050
DEEPA PRAHALAD: Thank you.

00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:53.450
It's an honor to be here.

00:20:53.450 --> 00:20:57.407
And I am just going
to load my present--

00:20:57.407 --> 00:21:00.389
how do I get the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:11.390
OK, there we go.

00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:13.010
Thank you, everybody,
for coming.

00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:16.010
And I would like to just
spend a little bit of time--

00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:19.250
I think Dr. Latha Palaniappan
has done a fantastic

00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:21.920
job of talking about some
of the unique challenges

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:23.990
from a medical standpoint.

00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:27.200
And as a nonprofit, we really
have this additional challenge

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:29.580
of saying, we have
this information,

00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:31.080
but how do we make
it actionable?

00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:34.130
And how do we create awareness?

00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:36.740
Because I think we all
know in emerging markets,

00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:38.060
the awareness is an issue.

00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:39.680
The education levels.

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:43.670
And a lot of people who
are in rural areas--

00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:46.040
culturally, there are
even terms that said,

00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:48.090
diabetes is a rich
person's disease.

00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:51.290
So the awareness that
this could happen at all

00:21:51.290 --> 00:21:53.700
is not there in many cases.

00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:58.070
And we also really said when we
looked around at our community

00:21:58.070 --> 00:22:00.680
here, there really isn't
a single family that

00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:05.280
hasn't been touched by one of
these diseases in some manner.

00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:07.010
And so that's how
I got involved.

00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:08.940
I don't have a
clinical background.

00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:11.510
But we really are trying to
use design and innovation

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:16.574
to help drive awareness and
some kind of actionable steps

00:22:16.574 --> 00:22:17.240
in this process.

00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:23.620
So what we really did is
we have a nonprofit called

00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:24.590
Arogya World.

00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:27.160
Arogya is a Sanskrit
word that means health,

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:29.740
to live a life without disease.

00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:32.260
And we really
said, let's see how

00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:36.640
we can do some kind
of actionable course

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:38.510
to change the course
of chronic disease.

00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:41.740
And we really settled on
three fundamental pillars

00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:45.280
of awareness, action,
really providing people

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:47.440
tools, not just information.

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:49.510
And creating alliances
with people who

00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:52.990
had information that we could
bring to a new audience.

00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:56.710
Currently, we've reached
about 3.7 million people.

00:22:56.710 --> 00:23:01.690
And we have plans to double
our outreach by 2020.

00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:04.510
And I'm not going to
spend a lot of time

00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:07.670
on this, because I think it
was especially well-covered.

00:23:07.670 --> 00:23:11.080
66% of the deaths
in the world are

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:12.950
from non-communicable diseases.

00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:17.150
And these are 80% of the
deaths in developing countries.

00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:22.330
And the economic impact of
that is absolutely devastating.

00:23:22.330 --> 00:23:24.340
And this is really
kind of the challenge

00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:27.310
in emerging markets is you
have a lot of what I would call

00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:30.400
this good/bad news,
where a lot of this

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:33.760
is because of increased life
expectancy from dealing fairly

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:35.810
well with infectious disease.

00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:37.420
So now, people are
living long enough.

00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:39.610
But because of the
demographics, you

00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:42.520
have this challenge where you're
dealing with malnutrition,

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:45.850
and diabetes, and heart
disease at the same time, which

00:23:45.850 --> 00:23:49.450
makes it extremely difficult
to get information across.

00:23:49.450 --> 00:23:53.680
And we know ultimately
that three behavior changes

00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:56.500
can really change the
course of chronic disease--

00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:59.980
healthy eating, exercise,
and avoiding diabetes.

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:02.230
And the gains from that
are quite significant.

00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:06.130
We can actually prevent 80%
of diabetes and heart disease

00:24:06.130 --> 00:24:09.190
and 40% of cancers.

00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:13.610
That is provided the information
is available and acted upon.

00:24:13.610 --> 00:24:17.120
And so that's what we
have tried to address.

00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:20.620
And I think where we
realized how important this

00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:24.040
is, is because despite all the
economic growth that people are

00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:29.170
excited about, this can actually
cripple any economic gains made

00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:31.570
in many emerging countries.

00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:35.960
We have 50% of the population
that dies from chronic disease.

00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:38.590
20% of the population
has at least one

00:24:38.590 --> 00:24:40.850
of these-- heart
disease, diabetes,

00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:41.920
or some type of cancer.

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:46.600
And Indians also get these
diseases much earlier

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:48.010
in their prime working life.

00:24:48.010 --> 00:24:52.030
So you can see the
statistics of $4.8 trillion

00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:55.840
in lost economic output
by 2030 is significant.

00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:57.910
And if people don't
have that themselves,

00:24:57.910 --> 00:25:00.160
they tend to be very concerned
because they tend to be

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:02.230
caregivers for their parents.

00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:04.960
Young professionals
of both genders

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:06.950
tend to take on
that responsibility.

00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:11.380
So it's an issue even
for people who are not

00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:13.120
suffering from one of these.

00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:16.360
And what we realized
when we did,

00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:20.320
I think the first
10,000 women survey,

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:25.430
is that this economic impact is
particularly severe for women.

00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:28.540
Women have been the focus of
a lot of development efforts.

00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:32.840
And what we did was take 10
countries around the world.

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:35.200
And we surveyed 1,000
women and said, what

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:36.820
is the impact in your lives?

00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:41.080
And what we're finding
is that 50% of people--

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:43.750
women are saying,
yes, we are having

00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:48.790
to be the primary caregiver for
even one person with an NCD.

00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:51.820
That can cut family
income by half.

00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:55.174
And it also means that
about 25% of people

00:25:55.174 --> 00:25:56.590
who were in our
survey were saying

00:25:56.590 --> 00:25:58.480
that they have been
forced to leave

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:00.580
the workforce for
extended periods.

00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:02.530
So we decided to say, all right.

00:26:02.530 --> 00:26:04.570
How do we empower women?

00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:07.540
And that was a fine line,
because I think many efforts

00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:09.550
today in wellness--

00:26:09.550 --> 00:26:11.470
while their focus
is women, they tend

00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:14.500
to overwhelm and place
a lot of extra burden

00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:19.060
solely on one person who may
be overburdened in any case.

00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:21.910
And we said, we need
to design something

00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:24.670
that's flexible, lean,
and can be adapted.

00:26:24.670 --> 00:26:27.130
Because India is a very
rapidly-changing environment.

00:26:27.130 --> 00:26:30.520
The types of phones that people
have where they could receive

00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:33.580
messages, where they can
understand what their risk

00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:35.170
factors are changing.

00:26:35.170 --> 00:26:39.250
And many of the rural
areas, what has happened

00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:41.230
is that they are
very exciting targets

00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:42.880
for multinational companies.

00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:44.840
What can be offered
cheaply however,

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:46.750
is not the Sprout stuff.

00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:51.190
It's the junk food that stays--

00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:54.490
has a very long shelf life and
it doesn't wear out easily.

00:26:54.490 --> 00:26:57.130
And what's happening is that
those are the first things that

00:26:57.130 --> 00:26:58.720
are offered, because
kind of an entry

00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:01.360
point to a new
group of consumers--

00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:03.070
and there isn't a
lot of awareness.

00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:05.260
People tend to like
those because they're

00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:08.200
in small sample sizes
and because they're

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:09.520
seen as very hygienic.

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:11.020
So it's a huge problem.

00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:13.980
And this is the first
generation in many cases

00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:15.790
in some of those
areas that can afford

00:27:15.790 --> 00:27:19.330
to give these kids treats
that they never had.

00:27:19.330 --> 00:27:23.290
So we knew we had to really
have a low-cost, scalable,

00:27:23.290 --> 00:27:26.650
and user-friendly
way to do this.

00:27:26.650 --> 00:27:31.420
And what we settled on is what I
call our doorstep health model,

00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:35.140
where we basically say the best
way to help women and families

00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:39.020
is to make sure that they
are not the sole person.

00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:41.710
They are trying to take charge
of their family's health.

00:27:41.710 --> 00:27:43.510
We know that
they're the drivers.

00:27:43.510 --> 00:27:45.190
But we have a
school program where

00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:47.410
children in seventh
and eighth grade

00:27:47.410 --> 00:27:51.070
get a set of really interesting
game-based exercises

00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:55.120
where they have the awareness
created at an early stage.

00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:56.680
We have a workplace initiative.

00:27:56.680 --> 00:28:00.160
Many employers are really
interested in making sure

00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:03.520
that their employees get
this information early on.

00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:07.150
And for many people who are
out in very disparate areas,

00:28:07.150 --> 00:28:10.930
we have mHealth
messages that come over.

00:28:10.930 --> 00:28:13.900
And they are very simple,
action-based messages.

00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:16.690
We don't give anybody
statistics about diabetes.

00:28:16.690 --> 00:28:19.150
We tell them concrete
things they can do--

00:28:19.150 --> 00:28:23.200
reduce your intake
of these grains.

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:25.390
So we've created a
very friendly voice

00:28:25.390 --> 00:28:30.220
that is geared toward inspiring
people to take action.

00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:35.620
And quickly, we have actually
a list of our genesis

00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:37.720
we've created.

00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:39.640
Our newest thing
is an initiative

00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:42.730
called MyThali, which is
basically similar to the US

00:28:42.730 --> 00:28:44.650
government's
MyPlate, where we've

00:28:44.650 --> 00:28:46.390
taken nutritional
guidelines and tried

00:28:46.390 --> 00:28:50.740
to create an icon-based system
so people actually understand

00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:53.920
visually what these
guidelines mean.

00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:57.400
And what we have found
in terms of our focus

00:28:57.400 --> 00:29:00.580
is really saying that we
want to use technology

00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:02.080
to spread awareness,
but we're not

00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:03.820
going to become a
technology company.

00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:04.910
That's not our focus.

00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:11.110
We're not trying to create tons
of cool add-ons to our text

00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:13.410
messages or even our
app in the workplace.

00:29:13.410 --> 00:29:15.490
What we're really trying
to do in the workplace--

00:29:15.490 --> 00:29:19.280
we will have an app that allows
people to measure and record.

00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:21.730
But for that text message
program, what we've really done

00:29:21.730 --> 00:29:24.450
is give people very
simple messages.

00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:25.960
And we've tried
to motivate them.

00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:29.480
We didn't want to have
the voice of a clinician.

00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:31.570
We all love and
respect our doctors.

00:29:31.570 --> 00:29:34.480
And we get the most expensive
ones that we can afford,

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:37.510
but we don't want to
talk to them every day.

00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:39.880
Nor do we want to be gentle--

00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:42.940
have gentle reminders
from friends and family

00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:45.250
about what we should eat,
when we're over-eating.

00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:49.750
And so having that encouragement
was really important.

00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:53.410
What we also realized after
we had text messages going out

00:29:53.410 --> 00:29:55.120
for many months in
different languages

00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:58.300
is, of course like anything
else, it becomes easier to tune

00:29:58.300 --> 00:29:58.900
out.

00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:01.290
So we partnered with a
company called [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:01.290 --> 00:30:05.950
that does periodic voice
messages as well, where

00:30:05.950 --> 00:30:08.310
you actually get a phone call.

00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:10.480
A message of encouragement.

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:12.920
You get a story from
somebody else to say, oh,

00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:13.930
this is what I tried.

00:30:13.930 --> 00:30:14.880
Here's a recipe.

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:18.260
Here was my success story.

00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:21.160
And so we really designed
to inspire action.

00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:25.000
And we have this
self-reinforcing model

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.460
of workplace, school,
and text messages.

00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:33.220
So that we make sure that we
have the same thing coming in

00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:36.130
from various places.

00:30:36.130 --> 00:30:38.590
And what we were very
encouraged to find

00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:42.340
in our very first survey when we
reached a million customers is

00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:46.930
that for an mHealth
initiative, we actually

00:30:46.930 --> 00:30:49.630
were able to
achieve a 15% impact

00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:52.330
based on our surveys,
which is highly unusual.

00:30:52.330 --> 00:30:57.850
Nokia was our initial partner
in sending out these messages.

00:30:57.850 --> 00:31:00.400
And people reported--
15% of people

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:02.980
reported 4 behavior changes.

00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:06.850
In the workplace context over
time, what we would like to do

00:31:06.850 --> 00:31:10.510
is really do some kind of
clinical measurement for people

00:31:10.510 --> 00:31:12.830
who opt-in.

00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:15.890
And we had a very good response
from the younger generation,

00:31:15.890 --> 00:31:17.620
which was the most encouraging.

00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:20.710
We had a lot of students
reporting that they

00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:22.840
had no idea about diabetes.

00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:26.660
They had kind of heard a
little bit about junk food,

00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:29.770
but a lot of teachers said that
these simple activities really

00:31:29.770 --> 00:31:31.210
brought the message home.

00:31:31.210 --> 00:31:33.220
So in seventh
grade, what we do is

00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:35.830
we have children take
part in activities.

00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:37.160
But in eighth grade--

00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:39.550
they do a two-your
curriculum with us.

00:31:39.550 --> 00:31:42.230
In eighth grade, they bring
their parents and families in

00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:45.760
to also receive this information
and get concrete tips.

00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:48.560
And people said that
was incredibly helpful.

00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:51.130
We've partnered with some of
the leading NGOs in India,

00:31:51.130 --> 00:31:52.250
like [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:52.250 --> 00:31:54.910
And we basically give
them training materials

00:31:54.910 --> 00:31:58.070
and expand our reach that way.

00:31:58.070 --> 00:32:01.330
One of the really exciting
things we're doing

00:32:01.330 --> 00:32:05.050
is this initiative
called MyThali,

00:32:05.050 --> 00:32:08.270
which we are doing for both
North and South Indian food.

00:32:08.270 --> 00:32:10.150
The nutrition
guidelines in India

00:32:10.150 --> 00:32:12.910
are very complicated, even
for highly-educated people

00:32:12.910 --> 00:32:13.660
to understand.

00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:19.000
When they say, we need 250
grams of rice or we need this,

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.840
what does that actually mean?

00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:24.490
So we've created an
icon-based pictorial model.

00:32:24.490 --> 00:32:28.330
We are also working to over
time, physically create a plate

00:32:28.330 --> 00:32:30.790
and serving spoons
of appropriate sizes,

00:32:30.790 --> 00:32:34.810
so people are able to
quickly and easily comply.

00:32:34.810 --> 00:32:38.980
So a lot of our focus is exactly
on that, is really creating

00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:42.720
a lot of ease of compliance.

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:45.150
And then, our school
program we also were

00:32:45.150 --> 00:32:47.330
able to achieve a 14% impact.

00:32:47.330 --> 00:32:49.920
And what we really
had was simple things

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:53.160
relating this battle
to snakes and ladders.

00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:56.550
You know, this is just such a
fundamentally different issue

00:32:56.550 --> 00:32:59.070
for India, because the entire
health system has been really

00:32:59.070 --> 00:33:01.090
geared toward
infectious disease,

00:33:01.090 --> 00:33:03.420
where you do need to have
these limited interventions,

00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:04.836
where you have to
convince someone

00:33:04.836 --> 00:33:06.570
to take a vaccine or something.

00:33:06.570 --> 00:33:08.310
But lifestyle diseases
are different.

00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:10.780
And the system is
not set up for that.

00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:13.320
So we found that these
very easy, visual ways

00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:15.540
of communicating
and giving people

00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:18.960
the idea of what the impact of
obesity can be, wear a backpack

00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:24.350
and try to do a race with all
these extra pounds on you.

00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:26.430
Those are the kind of
things that make it real

00:33:26.430 --> 00:33:29.700
and tend to have a really
experiential component that

00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:30.810
stays.

00:33:30.810 --> 00:33:35.040
And we have also signed up a
lot of leading Indian corporates

00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:38.430
and organizations, like
the Indian Railways,

00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:40.650
which is the largest
employer in the world.

00:33:40.650 --> 00:33:45.150
And with 1.3 million
employees, Reliance, Wipro,

00:33:45.150 --> 00:33:48.680
many of these
companies, to say, here.

00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:52.980
Here is a simple,
downloadable app.

00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:54.306
Get the text messages.

00:33:54.306 --> 00:33:55.680
And now, we have
worked with them

00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:59.670
and we have partnered with
activity tracking companies

00:33:59.670 --> 00:34:01.800
and created an
app so that we can

00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:04.200
be a one-stop shop
not only for diabetes,

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:06.030
but for overall wellness.

00:34:06.030 --> 00:34:10.080
And we are testing and
measuring the impact of that

00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:11.420
going forward.

00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:14.670
And we are covering about 2.3
million employees currently.

00:34:14.670 --> 00:34:17.489
And we're expecting
that to increase.

00:34:17.489 --> 00:34:21.300
And what we knew also was that
anything that we designed,

00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:24.210
we know that both the
tools, the information,

00:34:24.210 --> 00:34:27.389
the guidelines around
all of these diseases

00:34:27.389 --> 00:34:29.050
are evolving very rapidly.

00:34:29.050 --> 00:34:31.920
So we didn't want to be
too rigid in our design.

00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:34.800
We just saw this exciting
news about Google

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:39.400
having an AI eye scan that
can detect your cardiac risk.

00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:43.469
We know that we've been able to
limit the pinpricks with some

00:34:43.469 --> 00:34:45.989
of the diabetes
measuring devices.

00:34:45.989 --> 00:34:48.330
Even our understanding
of what healthy eating is

00:34:48.330 --> 00:34:50.260
continues to evolve.

00:34:50.260 --> 00:34:52.980
So we realize that kind
of positioning ourselves

00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:56.550
as experts wasn't the way to
gain long-term credibility.

00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:58.290
What we wanted to
be was somebody

00:34:58.290 --> 00:35:01.860
who was a friend and
partner along the journey

00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:05.220
and able to create
a conversation

00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:07.470
to have information exchange.

00:35:07.470 --> 00:35:10.950
We also want to always be able
to learn from the people we're

00:35:10.950 --> 00:35:11.920
trying to serve.

00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:15.540
So for example, in our schools
program, what we learned

00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:19.140
is we gave people information
about a healthy breakfast.

00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:22.350
And we realized, there's
a component of 10% to 15%

00:35:22.350 --> 00:35:24.600
of people who maybe don't
get a breakfast before they

00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:25.320
come to school.

00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:28.800
And their primary
meal during the day

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:31.770
is actually at their school.

00:35:31.770 --> 00:35:35.340
So we said, how do we
then revise, and rethink,

00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:38.530
and help families understand
what they can still do?

00:35:38.530 --> 00:35:40.740
And we realized that
this two-way information

00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:43.510
flow was going to be critical
for us going forward.

00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:46.470
And that's how we have
structured all of our programs,

00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:49.830
with continuously
getting feedback as well

00:35:49.830 --> 00:35:51.450
as giving suggestions.

00:35:51.450 --> 00:35:52.990
We are very excited.

00:35:52.990 --> 00:35:55.500
We've been able to reach
this kind of impact

00:35:55.500 --> 00:36:00.300
only because we've had
amazingly committed partners who

00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:03.420
have helped us really expand
in schools, workplaces.

00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:08.220
This is a very small
number of them.

00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:12.600
And what we got as we learned
a lot is people saying,

00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:15.120
we need this
information in the US.

00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:16.920
What you've learned
and the cost at which

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:19.380
you're able to
deliver impact really

00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:21.330
could make a
difference in the US,

00:36:21.330 --> 00:36:23.230
in Europe, in other
emerging markets.

00:36:23.230 --> 00:36:24.510
And we agree

00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:26.760
So what we are trying
to do is actually

00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:29.820
take what we've learned
and expand our reach here.

00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:32.190
We're experimenting with
an Indo American Center

00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:36.670
here in Chicago, and trying
to see how we can best

00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:39.690
adjust some of our
programs to audiences

00:36:39.690 --> 00:36:43.350
in different parts of
the world because there's

00:36:43.350 --> 00:36:45.780
different access and
a different awareness.

00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:49.930
We started a California
working group last year.

00:36:49.930 --> 00:36:53.700
And as far as going
forward, how would

00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:57.870
we like to expand our reach
is really getting feedback,

00:36:57.870 --> 00:36:59.700
having people get involved.

00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:01.560
Never ones to turn
down a donation,

00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:03.870
we're at arogyaworld.org.

00:37:03.870 --> 00:37:07.290
But what we really want to do
is have people share information

00:37:07.290 --> 00:37:10.680
with us on how they were able
to create those lifestyle

00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:13.080
changes for themselves,
for their family.

00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:15.330
Because we really believe
now we have a channel

00:37:15.330 --> 00:37:18.930
to distribute that
information far and wide,

00:37:18.930 --> 00:37:22.120
and help us really spread
the word and have an impact.

00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:25.620
And I think the cost at which
we were able to reach people

00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:27.970
is pretty amazing.

00:37:27.970 --> 00:37:30.900
Given other alternatives,
we're able to create outreach

00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:32.700
for $0.50.

00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:36.330
We can actually create impact
and behavior change based

00:37:36.330 --> 00:37:42.160
on our surveys for about $6.50,
which is highly unusual in this

00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:43.610
type of an effort.

00:37:43.610 --> 00:37:46.840
So we're really proud of
what we've done so far,

00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:53.470
and happy to take any questions
and get your feedback as well.

00:37:53.470 --> 00:37:54.110
Thank you.

00:37:57.540 --> 00:38:00.909
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:00.909 --> 00:38:02.117
SPEAKER 1: I have a question.

00:38:02.117 --> 00:38:03.636
DEEPA PRAHALAD: OK.

00:38:03.636 --> 00:38:07.660
SPEAKER 1: So you showed the
picture of the Google scan.

00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:09.540
I think it was of an eye.

00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:11.530
And I guess that's one
example of something

00:38:11.530 --> 00:38:16.870
Google is doing on this front.

00:38:16.870 --> 00:38:21.610
Is there anything else that you
admire that Google is doing,

00:38:21.610 --> 00:38:24.940
or that you would like to
perhaps partner with Google on,

00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:29.770
or some technologies that Google
is working on that you think

00:38:29.770 --> 00:38:33.370
might be able to help
Arogya on its mission?

00:38:33.370 --> 00:38:35.200
DEEPA PRAHALAD: Well,
I think one thing--

00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:36.366
do you want to come up here?

00:38:36.366 --> 00:38:40.690
One thing that we have seen some
interest from in our workplace

00:38:40.690 --> 00:38:42.940
offerings is really saying--

00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:45.500
you know, young employees
in India, for example.

00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:47.860
Even if they are not
personally affected,

00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:49.540
the burden of caring
for parents is

00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:52.840
something that really looms
large for a lot of people

00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:54.790
at a very young age.

00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:57.700
And kind of the social
contract culturally

00:38:57.700 --> 00:39:00.640
is that children really
take care of their parents

00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:01.700
in their old age.

00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:05.380
And because they get the
disease so much younger,

00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:07.630
really helping young
employees understand

00:39:07.630 --> 00:39:09.530
how to care for their
parents is one thing.

00:39:09.530 --> 00:39:11.800
We have seen, even
in the US now,

00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:14.340
because so many people
wear activity trackers,

00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:16.750
they're able to integrate
some of that information

00:39:16.750 --> 00:39:18.220
into city planning.

00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:21.520
India is at a stage where now
you're saying, OK, there--

00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:26.080
to prevent this migration from
rural areas to urban areas,

00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:29.530
and all the consequences
that entails,

00:39:29.530 --> 00:39:31.450
people are able to use
that data from activity

00:39:31.450 --> 00:39:33.110
trackers to do smarter planning.

00:39:33.110 --> 00:39:35.500
There are probably 400
to 500 cities in India

00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:38.170
that are saying, we need
to create infrastructure

00:39:38.170 --> 00:39:40.670
so people stay where they are.

00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:42.910
So understanding,
how does that work?

00:39:42.910 --> 00:39:45.190
What does that mean?

00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:47.530
That's one of those
really interesting things.

00:39:47.530 --> 00:39:49.600
And I know the tech
companies and the pharma

00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:51.550
have been really
involved in trying

00:39:51.550 --> 00:39:55.660
to create new diagnostics
and new ways to monitor.

00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:58.300
So anything that lets
people do that at a lower

00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:00.760
cost will make this
disproportionate impact,

00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:03.680
I think, in
countries like India.

00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:04.930
LATHA PALANIAPPAN: So I agree.

00:40:04.930 --> 00:40:07.960
And to build on
that, for my patients

00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:12.370
I would love some type of
noninvasive glucose monitoring,

00:40:12.370 --> 00:40:13.812
because I think
it is really hard.

00:40:13.812 --> 00:40:15.520
Currently, you have
to prick your finger,

00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:17.800
and put it on a
little piece of paper,

00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:21.670
and stick it in the machine,
and see what the number is.

00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:25.600
So some way-- and I've worked
with some companies that

00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:30.340
are using light technology to
perhaps look at the wavelengths

00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:35.050
on hemoglobin to see what the
glycosylation of the hemoglobin

00:40:35.050 --> 00:40:39.190
is to detect the glucose levels.

00:40:39.190 --> 00:40:41.950
So noninvasive glucose
monitoring as well as

00:40:41.950 --> 00:40:43.780
continuous glucose monitoring.

00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:48.370
So my patients are
so surprised by when

00:40:48.370 --> 00:40:50.800
they eat, if they
prick their finger,

00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:52.030
their glucose is higher.

00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:53.987
And sort of really
connecting what

00:40:53.987 --> 00:40:55.570
you're putting in
your body and what's

00:40:55.570 --> 00:40:56.950
happening to your glucose.

00:40:56.950 --> 00:41:02.710
And what is happening long term
to your heart disease risk is,

00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:03.944
I think--

00:41:03.944 --> 00:41:06.110
would be great to connect
the dots for our patients.

00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:16.860
AUDIENCE: I think
the health data

00:41:16.860 --> 00:41:18.510
that you showed
at the beginning,

00:41:18.510 --> 00:41:20.820
it's mostly very broad.

00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:26.640
And I guess, it's
quite epidemiological.

00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:27.974
Sorry about that.

00:41:27.974 --> 00:41:29.640
LATHA PALANIAPPAN:
Yes, epidemiological.

00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:31.390
AUDIENCE: But I feel
like there's actually

00:41:31.390 --> 00:41:32.550
more detail available.

00:41:32.550 --> 00:41:34.300
For instance, with
a plant-based diet.

00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:37.609
So if you look at the
Adventist studies and so on.

00:41:37.609 --> 00:41:39.900
So I feel like it could be
a little bit more aggressive

00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:42.825
maybe, about promoting
very particular things.

00:41:47.189 --> 00:41:48.480
Say, you've cut out the cheese.

00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:50.271
Maybe that's not so
big a problem in India.

00:41:50.271 --> 00:41:51.587
But like, I'm from Germany.

00:41:51.587 --> 00:41:52.920
So I was eating a lot of cheese.

00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:54.930
So basically, cut
off the cheese.

00:41:54.930 --> 00:41:56.070
How about the other thing?

00:41:56.070 --> 00:42:01.290
Basically, you go from avoiding
meat and you avoid fish.

00:42:01.290 --> 00:42:03.300
But you also look at
all the opportunities

00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:06.300
that it actually increases
your quality of life

00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:08.860
because it's not just
about losing the weight.

00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:13.190
I think basically, the
thing is a little bit--

00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:15.750
the gist of I think what you
have in your health information

00:42:15.750 --> 00:42:18.510
is mostly lowering
your weight, so you

00:42:18.510 --> 00:42:20.010
reduce your risk of diabetes.

00:42:20.010 --> 00:42:22.950
But there's a whole host
of other side effects

00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:26.700
which are positive basically,
by particular diet changes.

00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:28.770
And also, of course,
exercise that comes with it.

00:42:28.770 --> 00:42:30.120
LATHA PALANIAPPAN: Absolutely.

00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:31.960
I completely agree with you.

00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:34.050
And to restate a
little bit is sort

00:42:34.050 --> 00:42:37.200
of like there were some broad
strokes about diabetes rates

00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:41.760
and sort of an ecological
sort of argument

00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:44.490
that increased diabetes
is caused by increased

00:42:44.490 --> 00:42:47.460
obesity in general.

00:42:47.460 --> 00:42:49.740
When I talk to patients,
I talk about sort

00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:55.080
of kind of rough
tuning and fine tuning.

00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:58.890
So one third of the
people in this country

00:42:58.890 --> 00:43:00.270
are at normal weight.

00:43:00.270 --> 00:43:01.350
One third.

00:43:01.350 --> 00:43:05.250
One third are overweight
and one third is obese.

00:43:05.250 --> 00:43:08.170
So in that one third
that is normal weight,

00:43:08.170 --> 00:43:12.360
I agree that fine
tuning is very needed.

00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:14.935
So looking exactly at
a 24-hour food recall.

00:43:14.935 --> 00:43:16.560
So that's what we do
with our patients,

00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:18.930
like seeing what they
ate in the last 24 hours.

00:43:18.930 --> 00:43:21.480
And seeing where there
can be more protein

00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:24.600
and a substitution for more of
a whole grain than a refined

00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:25.230
grain.

00:43:25.230 --> 00:43:27.810
And some of these interventions
that are culturally specific,

00:43:27.810 --> 00:43:29.550
like the My Thali.

00:43:29.550 --> 00:43:32.970
I did a study where
we interviewed

00:43:32.970 --> 00:43:34.320
South Asian patients.

00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:35.970
And they would go
see a nutritionist.

00:43:35.970 --> 00:43:38.880
And the patient said,
oh, they told me not

00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:40.560
to eat burgers and
fries and cheese.

00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:42.540
And they never ate those
things anyway, right?

00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:45.780
So nobody ever told them
about chapati and dal.

00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:48.420
And you know, that dal
is mostly a carbohydrate.

00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:50.190
And if you want
protein, you might

00:43:50.190 --> 00:43:51.555
have to look at other sources.

00:43:55.350 --> 00:43:57.750
I do studies on physical
activity, actually.

00:43:57.750 --> 00:43:59.670
In those normal
weight diabetics,

00:43:59.670 --> 00:44:02.880
like, is it better for them
to do strength training

00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:03.929
or aerobic training?

00:44:03.929 --> 00:44:05.970
So we have a study where
we're randomizing people

00:44:05.970 --> 00:44:08.300
to strength training only,
aerobic training only,

00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:09.760
or a combination of both.

00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:11.550
So I agree, there's
plenty of room

00:44:11.550 --> 00:44:15.090
for fine tuning both diet
and exercise that should

00:44:15.090 --> 00:44:18.610
be done on an individual level.

00:44:18.610 --> 00:44:19.444
So I agree with you.

00:44:19.444 --> 00:44:21.609
DEEPA PRAHALAD: And I think
from the nonprofit side,

00:44:21.609 --> 00:44:23.335
we were just
concerned that a lot

00:44:23.335 --> 00:44:26.170
of the basic-level awareness
just isn't there at all.

00:44:26.170 --> 00:44:29.670
Because historically,
it has been a luxury

00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:31.350
to eat sweets and everything.

00:44:31.350 --> 00:44:33.420
So even if you look
at the terminology

00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:36.235
in some Indian languages,
diabetes is the king's disease.

00:44:36.235 --> 00:44:37.860
AUDIENCE: Positive
message also, right?

00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:39.120
Here, it's blueberries.

00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:41.060
Maybe it's mangoes or
something else in India

00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:41.890
that people really like.

00:44:41.890 --> 00:44:44.040
DEEPA PRAHALAD: No, that is
what most of our text messages--

00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:44.240
yeah.

00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:45.740
AUDIENCE: They're
very sweet, right?

00:44:45.740 --> 00:44:46.830
But they taste good.

00:44:46.830 --> 00:44:48.631
They taste good and
they're healthy.

00:44:48.631 --> 00:44:50.880
DEEPA PRAHALAD: That's the
text message program, is we

00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:53.610
really tell people what
they should do instead.

00:44:53.610 --> 00:44:56.180
We don't give them any
statistical data at all.

00:44:56.180 --> 00:44:58.650
What we do is these
changes would help you,

00:44:58.650 --> 00:45:00.660
would help your family.

00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:04.110
But that's the rub is that a lot
of these things that are quite

00:45:04.110 --> 00:45:06.630
healthy have become expensive.

00:45:06.630 --> 00:45:08.670
And that's what we're
always trying to balance.

00:45:08.670 --> 00:45:12.480
And that's true as well here
among lower-income groups.

00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:15.240
So that's always the challenge.

00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:16.950
You know, you can give
people information

00:45:16.950 --> 00:45:18.420
that's not actionable.

00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:20.220
So we're always
trying to refine.

00:45:20.220 --> 00:45:23.490
And so we have very different
messages in the workplace

00:45:23.490 --> 00:45:25.710
program for example,
versus what goes out

00:45:25.710 --> 00:45:28.205
to a more general population.

00:45:28.205 --> 00:45:29.830
LATHA PALANIAPPAN:
Sort of, how can you

00:45:29.830 --> 00:45:31.904
continue to eat like a
pauper when you can afford

00:45:31.904 --> 00:45:33.710
to eat like a king, right?

00:45:33.710 --> 00:45:35.560
That's difficult. Thank you.

00:45:37.606 --> 00:45:38.480
SPEAKER 1: All right.

00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:41.420
Well, thank you,
Dr. Palaniappan.

00:45:41.420 --> 00:45:42.637
Dr. Prahalad.

00:45:42.637 --> 00:45:43.970
Thank you, everyone, for coming.

00:45:43.970 --> 00:45:45.178
LATHA PALANIAPPAN: Thank you.

00:45:45.178 --> 00:45:47.920
[APPLAUSE]
