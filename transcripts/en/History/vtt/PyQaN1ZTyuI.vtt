00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:05.960
WILL WILLIS: What you have there
are two stacks of high carbon

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.460
high quality steel.

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:09.460
The red is 15n20.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.670
The yellow, 1095.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.920
Now, I'm sure you know
that you're probably

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.170
gonna have to combine those into
some kind of Damascus pattern.

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.580
It's time to find out
about our parameters.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.500
Your tang must be a
through-threaded tang.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.620
Keep in mind that in the second
round, you'll be attaching

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.500
handles to those
blades to turn them

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.000
into fully functional weapons.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.960
Your three hour forge
time starts now.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.670
DWIGHT: Everybody
asks, well, how long

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.670
did it take you to make that?

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:38.670
I don't know.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.500
I made it till it was right.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.670
The challenge in
Damascus steel is just

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.830
making sure that you've
got a good [inaudible]

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:47.000
from the start.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.670
--it's gonna get
hot enough or not.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.540
What you want to do
is get your layers,

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.380
and get them heated
up hot enough.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.540
It looks just like you
frying grease in a skillet.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.540
A lot of people think
that it melts together.

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.000
No, that's not true.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.170
They're wanting to go
together, but you've

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:04.460
got to put pressure on it.

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.040
And when they do, they'll bond.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.880
[hammering]

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.960
MARK: So, in the first hour,
I want to make sure that I get

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.000
my twist pattern Damascus made.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.790
That's going to be the hardest
part of this challenge.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.040
Want to make sure the billet's
stacked, get it drawn out,

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.540
put it in the vise,
and twist it up.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.830
Making Damascus is
difficult, because you're

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.460
forge welding, which is
a very ancient technique.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.170
There's a lot of things that
can go wrong with a Damascus,

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.670
so it's pretty tricky.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.330
WILL WILLIS: You think
Mark's worried right now?

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.040
Well, I mean, he's up
against three master smiths.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.210
I'd be pissing my pants.

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.710
MARK: I'm somebody
who enjoys challenges.

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.420
Crossing that point of no
return, I really enjoy.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.540
I fought an MMA fight.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.210
I rode a bull once, also.

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.500
If you look for a reason
to say yes to something,

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.420
life will be more fun.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.000
BILLY BOB: After cutting
the bar into four pieces

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.170
and stacking it up, pressing it
down, and drawing it out again,

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.420
I think I may have bitten
off more I could chew.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.920
But one good thing about
making shark's tooth

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.750
is you know you've
got good welds in it,

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.750
because you have
tested them severely.

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:07.380
[clang]

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:18.290
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.790
Bladesmiths, shut down your
machines, drop your tools,

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.210
this round is over.

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.080
[music playing]

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.580
[bleep]

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.620
I'm not feeling really
good right now, because I

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.580
forgot to thread the tang.

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:33.460
It's a disaster.

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.960
All right,
bladesmiths, the first

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.290
round of our pick-your-pattern
Damascus challenge is over.

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:43.580
Now it's time for
the judges to take

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.120
a closer look at your work.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.620
Mark, you're up first.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.790
Please present your
blade to the judges.

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.540
DOUG MARCAIDA: So what
I like about your design

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.830
is that you have a false edge
that should back up the tip.

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:55.920
And you cut the thread in.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:56.620
Good job.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.330
Thank you.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.500
I like the fact that I can
see the pattern in your blade,

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.000
all the way across.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
There's a just a
bit of a warp, it's

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.120
more pronounced on the blade.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.330
It will be interesting to
see if it moves forward.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:09.670
Thank you.

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:10.460
WILL WILLIS: Billy
Bob, you're up next.

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.670
Phew.

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.830
BEN ABBOTT: It's got a really
nice shape to it, Billy Bob.

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.250
I like the fine point.

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.170
It should be a nice stabber.

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:19.460
I like the pattern
you put in there,

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.790
it's very easy to
see the raindrop.

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.750
Biggest thing with this would
be, you know, just getting

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.670
that tang straightened out.

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.170
But, good job.

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:28.120
Thank you.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.750
Dwight, you're up.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.790
DOUG MARCAIDA: Well,
Dwight, overall

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.000
it's a fine looking blade.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.120
I can see the pattern of
your ladder pattern Damascus,

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.290
it looks good.

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.540
Thank you.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.960
It kills me that
that's not threaded.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.040
What happened?

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.670
Just focused on
trying to get it

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.000
done, and just ran out of time.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.880
This is, in my opinion,
the best finished blade here.

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.710
I mean, that's
just a really good

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:57.290
all-around knife shape there.

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:58.670
Thank you.

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.670
WILL WILLIS: Steve, you're up.

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.120
BEN ABBOTT: First and foremost,
amazing kudos for trying

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.460
such a difficult pattern.

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.170
STEVE: Thank you.

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.290
The pattern isn't quite as
visible as I would have liked.

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.460
But there's no threading
on this one, either.

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:15.040
Correct.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.540
You do understand that this
is one of the parameters,

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.880
and not having it is
something that's serious.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.920
I absolutely understood.

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.000
Bladesmiths, in
a competition where

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.250
failure to meet a single
one of our parameters

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.250
is grounds for immediate
elimination, two of you

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.080
are on the chopping block.

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.420
It's time for one of
you to leave the forge.

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.540
[music playing]

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.580
Steve, your blade
did not make the cut.

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.830
David Baker will explain.

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.710
Steve, we've put these
parameters in place

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.420
so we can judge
the knives equally.

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:51.920
Two of you did not
meet those parameters.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.420
Yours was just the least
finished of the two,

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.750
and that's the reason
we're sending you home.
