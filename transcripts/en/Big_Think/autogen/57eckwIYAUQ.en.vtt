in the classroom we focus on performance

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570
in the classroom we focus on performance
 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.950
in the classroom we focus on performance
as process and not performance as

think about performance only as the last

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789
think about performance only as the last
 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.410

they get one shot and they can't mess it
up and that just raises the stakes so

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050
up and that just raises the stakes so
 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.320

unnecessarily around something that is
already kind of scary but instead if we

them to these are all of the parts of
performance that we deal with and

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539
performance that we deal with and
 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.750

communicators the easiest way to
 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.700
communicators the easiest way to
minimize stage fright I have found is to

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710
minimize stage fright I have found is to
 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.190
minimize stage fright I have found is to
lower the stakes around performance so

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200
lower the stakes around performance so
 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.520
lower the stakes around performance so
by allowing people to just be more

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530
by allowing people to just be more
 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.920
by allowing people to just be more
familiar and have more experiences with

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930
familiar and have more experiences with
 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.140
familiar and have more experiences with
performance instead of just one final

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150
performance instead of just one final
 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.200
performance instead of just one final
performance they're already used to this

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210
performance they're already used to this
 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.880
performance they're already used to this
is what it feels like when I'm in front

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890
is what it feels like when I'm in front
 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.050
is what it feels like when I'm in front
of an audience this is what my body

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060
of an audience this is what my body
 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.429
of an audience this is what my body
feels like this is what happens when I

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439
feels like this is what happens when I
 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.590
feels like this is what happens when I
sweat a lot before I go onstage this is

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600
sweat a lot before I go onstage this is
 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.179
sweat a lot before I go onstage this is
what a microphone feels like all of

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189
what a microphone feels like all of
 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.830
what a microphone feels like all of
those things if they're more familiar

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840
those things if they're more familiar
 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.590
those things if they're more familiar
with them then getting up on stage feels

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600
with them then getting up on stage feels
 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.020
with them then getting up on stage feels
less foreign and feels less terrifying

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030
less foreign and feels less terrifying
 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.819
less foreign and feels less terrifying
so that's the easiest way to combat

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829
so that's the easiest way to combat
 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.190
so that's the easiest way to combat
stage fright is just a lot of practice

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200
stage fright is just a lot of practice
 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.649
stage fright is just a lot of practice
and a lot of familiarity with the

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659
and a lot of familiarity with the
 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.450
and a lot of familiarity with the
elements of performance and what's going

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460
elements of performance and what's going
 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.999
elements of performance and what's going
to happen when you're on stage a lot of

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009
to happen when you're on stage a lot of
 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.109
to happen when you're on stage a lot of
times when people have stage fright

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119
times when people have stage fright
 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.910
times when people have stage fright
there's a little voice in the back of

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920
there's a little voice in the back of
 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.670
there's a little voice in the back of
their head that's going oh oh I'm gonna

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680
their head that's going oh oh I'm gonna
 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.800
their head that's going oh oh I'm gonna
be up there all alone and everyone's

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810
be up there all alone and everyone's
 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.240
be up there all alone and everyone's
gonna be watching me and everyone's

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250
gonna be watching me and everyone's
 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.440
gonna be watching me and everyone's
gonna be waiting for me to mess up so

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450
gonna be waiting for me to mess up so
 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.970
gonna be waiting for me to mess up so
they can be like ah hi knew it you suck

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980
they can be like ah hi knew it you suck
 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.910
they can be like ah hi knew it you suck
and that's very unrealistic for two main

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920
and that's very unrealistic for two main
 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.740
and that's very unrealistic for two main
reasons one is that when you're on stage

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750
reasons one is that when you're on stage
 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.910
reasons one is that when you're on stage
you're not alone you're in a room full

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920
you're not alone you're in a room full
 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.420
you're not alone you're in a room full
of people and it's important to remember

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430
of people and it's important to remember
 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.650
of people and it's important to remember
that for many reasons but a big one is

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660
that for many reasons but a big one is
 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.400
that for many reasons but a big one is
that those people all are a part of this

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410
that those people all are a part of this
 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.660
that those people all are a part of this
moment with you and they want to enjoy

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670
moment with you and they want to enjoy
 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.610
moment with you and they want to enjoy
themselves the second reason why that

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620
themselves the second reason why that
 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:39.900
themselves the second reason why that
fear doesn't make any sense is because

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910
fear doesn't make any sense is because
 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.490
fear doesn't make any sense is because
no one ever goes to see a lot of

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500
no one ever goes to see a lot of
 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.380
no one ever goes to see a lot of
performance and sits down and is like me

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390
performance and sits down and is like me
 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.690
performance and sits down and is like me
I hope it is gonna be terrible right no

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700
I hope it is gonna be terrible right no
 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:46.949

yourself I really believe that those are
 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.849
yourself I really believe that those are
the two most critical things that you

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:17.859
the two most critical things that you
 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:19.740
the two most critical things that you
can focus on when you're performing

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750
can focus on when you're performing
 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.080
