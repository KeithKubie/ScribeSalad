00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.859
What did you write, David?

00:00:01.859 --> 00:00:02.920
&gt;&gt; So we start with a verb, and

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:06.050
the verb here is went, which is
the past tense of the action go.

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:11.180
Our agent here is David, myself,
because I'm the one doing the action,

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:12.730
I'm the one going.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.079
The coagent is Ashok,
because I'm going with Ashok.

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:20.750
The destination is to the meeting,
and the conveyance here is by car, so

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:22.270
car is the conveyance.

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:23.680
&gt;&gt; That's right, David.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.550
But how did we know that
David was the agent?

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.300
How did we know that
the destination was the meeting?

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.710
How did we know that
car was the conveyance?

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:33.910
That's what we'll look at next.
