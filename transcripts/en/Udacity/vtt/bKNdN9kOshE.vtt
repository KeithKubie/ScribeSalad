00:00:00.003 --> 00:00:04.293
Now let's take another sort of toy example, of two quantities that we could very

00:00:04.293 --> 00:00:08.451
easily relate to one another, with an equation, where one of the quantities

00:00:08.451 --> 00:00:12.260
depends on the other quantity. And think about the relationship between those

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.337
two variables a little bit more. So let's say that we have a candy machine, for

00:00:16.337 --> 00:00:20.575
which there is a set price for candy. So if I put one kind of coin in the candy

00:00:20.575 --> 00:00:24.832
machine, it gives me a certain amount of candy. So in this case the input, is

00:00:24.832 --> 00:00:29.092
the amount of money that you put into the candy machine. Just like for Athena,

00:00:29.092 --> 00:00:32.398
with her soda machine the input was the money that she put into the soda

00:00:32.398 --> 00:00:35.990
machine. And the output here, is the amount of candy that comes out of the

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.880
machine, just like the number of sodas was the output for Athena earlier. So

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.604
which of these two statements do you think makes the most sense? For a given

00:00:43.604 --> 00:00:47.324
amount of money put in, there's more than one possibility for the amount of

00:00:47.324 --> 00:00:51.055
candy that the candy will dispense. Or for a given amount of money put in, there

00:00:51.055 --> 00:00:54.241
is at most one possibility for the amount of candy that the machine will

00:00:54.241 --> 00:00:58.542
dispense. Think about how this machine works, and how you think that input and

00:00:58.542 --> 00:01:00.759
output should be related to each other.
