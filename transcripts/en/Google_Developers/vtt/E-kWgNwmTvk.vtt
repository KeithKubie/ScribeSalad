00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.370
&gt;&gt; PATRICK: So, today, we have Shivani York
and Srivaths Lakshimi from TIME.com, and they

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:18.780
did a great demo of the usual list on TIME.com.
So, Shivani, can you tell us a little bit

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.810
about yourself and...?
&gt;&gt; YORK: Sure. So, I’m the director of Web

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.740
Development and Products Strategy at TIME.com,
and we worked over the last month or so with

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.369
Patrick in Google to implement the new Friend
Connects and new APIs and Cloud Computing

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.579
for Time list.
&gt;&gt; PATRICK: Excellent. Can you tell us a little

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:41.910
bit more about Time list, what it is?
&gt;&gt; YORK: So the Time list concept is we do

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.790
a lot of our daily list. We do a lot of specials
that are daily by nature, weekly by nature,

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.399
and quarterly by nature. For our daily list,
which is the one that we're going to start

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.820
off with, they take the form of top 10. And
they can be very–they're sort of like a–some

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:03.129
of them are very fun and personal by nature,
their different perspective of the current

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:09.300
day's news. So, I'll give you an example.
Some of the recent ones have been top 10 iPhone

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:17.180
Apps for moms, or top 10 movie catchphrases.
So when you think of things–list like that,

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:24.460
they're–they lend themselves very well to
be personalized, to be ranked by users. So,

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.670
our edit team creates those top 10 lists on
a daily basis, and we also do other list as

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:34.310
well, but we're going to start with top 10.
So the concept here was, the challenge that

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.890
we threw at Google was how do we make this
list more fun, more interactive and more social

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:45.421
by nature? There are a couple of catches to
it, too, as well. We didn't want to create

00:01:45.421 --> 00:01:52.890
a big application load at the bottom. We don't
want to create a separate community or separate

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:59.310
social network. We wanted to be able to leverage
social networks that were already out there.

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.599
And we wanted it to be fun, easy to use, interactive
and easy to build, which, you know, being

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:07.940
a small development team we wanted to make
sure that this wouldn't be a big overhead

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.410
and a ten-month project. So that's where you
guys came in.

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:18.480
&gt;&gt; PATRICK: Yes. So, tell me about the user
experience when they're experiencing the social

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.390
list. What does it look like?
&gt;&gt; YORK: So, the experience that you’ll

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:28.160
see which will be live on TIME.com in the
next few weeks is you will get our editorial

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:35.880
list, which is the full list of sort of it’s
top 10 iPhone Apps. You will get the ten iPhone

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.550
Apps that are selected by editorial team.
And then users will get the ability to rank

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:46.750
the list and make it their own. So you'll
get an interface that'll allow you to drag

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.940
and drop that list into your own rankable
form. You can take three of the top 10 or

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.960
you can take all 10 of the top 10. Then you
can sign in with any of the open social networks.

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:03.600
You can sign in with Yahoo, Google, Facebook,
Open AZ. And then once you sign in, you can

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:09.460
then save and share that list to your Twitter,
you can share on your Facebook, you can email

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:16.400
it to friends. And the exciting thing is that
once you share that list, that URL is yours

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.400
and it's unique to use. So you can come back
as a user and look at your list, delete it,

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:27.010
create new ones. So it just becomes–it takes
that one list and gives the users the capability

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.901
to create hundreds of list that they can make
their own.

00:03:29.901 --> 00:03:37.640
&gt;&gt; PATRICK: Excellent. What are you expecting
from these applications? Do you have any expectations

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.340
or is this an experiment to see how it goes?
&gt;&gt; YORK: It's something that we've been brainstorming

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.190
about for the last few months at least. I
mean, it has both advertising implications

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:51.750
as well as user implications. What we're hoping
we'd get out of it in the short term is giving

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:58.370
you just fun things to do with our list. I
mean, our lists are a huge engaging area on

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:04.099
our site. They're very sort of click through
by nature so people come to it their short

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:08.360
form. They usually include a video or a photo
on top, and there are maybe two or three paragraphs

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:13.130
on each page. We can easily click through.
And like I said, the subject matter for some

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:18.009
of those lists is so interesting. It sort
of reminds you of something. So, you know,

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:22.630
top 10 iPhone Apps. I mean, everybody who
uses an iPhone App has an iPhone App that

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:28.070
they like. So why not give them the ability
to create their own version of it. So what

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:34.000
we're hoping to get out of it in the short
term is to build user engagement to make the

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.570
list more sticky and to take advantage of
the viral nature of Facebook and Twitter and

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.660
give people sort of the ability to customize
the list and make it their own. In longer

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:48.280
term, I think it has implications both in
the advertising side. So I think this is something

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.530
that will be a very exciting products--product
for advertisers as well. I mean, you know,

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:57.530
imagine if we created an editorial list and
we also had an advertising-driven list that

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:02.910
was related right next to it and you can take
both and share both and create fun, you know,

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:09.180
concepts out of both of those. And then we
also do larger list. We, you know, we do quarterly,

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:18.530
we do best of everything, top 100, Time 100,
which is a list of a hundred most influential

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:25.991
people. Imagine taking that and building your
own list of my ten most influential people

00:05:25.991 --> 00:05:32.970
that have influenced me personally. So–then
the time edit list becomes very viral and

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:39.370
very personal and very interesting to each
user in a different way. So we're hoping that

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:43.930
it'll drive engagement, build additional page
views, and we got to take advantage of the

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:48.520
viral nature.
&gt;&gt; PATRICK: That's great. Thanks very much,

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:53.250
Shivani. Srivaths, do you want to talk about
the technical aspect, how was this implemented,

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.200
how long did it take and what the application
is?

00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:01.250
&gt;&gt; LAKSHMI: Yeah. What else happening here
is all of them appears on cash between–basically

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.170
it's a static page and we don’t want to
put anymore load by integrating the Facebook

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:13.620
connect and Google connect or Friends connect,
whatever. And we are using GQuery APIs from

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:21.500
Google, which really helped us integrating
with the Google Friends Connect here. And

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:28.610
most of the logic is in JavaScript. So, the
JavaScript is [INDISTINCT] in our server so

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:33.350
the amount of reloading the JavaScript again
and again is [INDISTINCT] so it's not going

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:38.919
to put any of our servers or anything. And
we don’t want to make a separate database.

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:46.790
What we use are log n authentication information.
So one good thing with integrating with Google

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:52.949
Friend Connect was, like, we use App Engine
from Google tools. And it’s very good and

00:06:52.949 --> 00:06:57.229
we can have all the logs in the App Engine,
we know the user information like who logged

00:06:57.229 --> 00:07:04.660
in, what's the network, what list they're
trying to create, how many discs left, whether

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:12.590
they're just one or the 10 or something in
between one and 10. And we are really proud

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:17.900
to be the partner of Google's Friend Connect.
&gt;&gt; PATRICK: Okay. We're very happy to have

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:23.171
you as a great use case of this kind of new
architecture. So to summarize, you're going

00:07:23.171 --> 00:07:24.171
to study HTML page.
&gt;&gt; LAKSHMI: Uh-huh.

00:07:24.171 --> 00:07:30.160
&gt;&gt; PATRICK: And then you had GQuery uploads
that is used to do all the user interface.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:39.460
And then you have Google Friend Connect for
the authentication and security, and then

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:40.580
you use the security token, is that it, that
brings connection to you?

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:43.020
&gt;&gt; LAKSHMI: Yeah, the security token with
the user ID and the network ID has been sent

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:48.990
to the App Engine on the solar side on the
App Engine [INDISTINCT].

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:51.900
&gt;&gt; PATRICK: I see. So then...
&gt;&gt; LAKSHMI: Whether it's a valid user or not

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:57.789
so that once the user clears the list, the
App Engine gives us a new user information

00:07:57.789 --> 00:08:03.330
you need. It's going to be some numeric value,
so it's going to be unique for each user.

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:09.410
And the good thing is, tomorrow you can assure
that, okay, Patrick created this list and

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:14.021
you shut it with [INDISTINCT] and say, "See,
my list is in TIME.com." It's going to be

00:08:14.021 --> 00:08:18.210
a good sign for everyone.
&gt;&gt; PATRICK: Yes, so you generate these unique

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:23.490
URLs and then all the dynamic comes in to
support from App Engine...

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:26.090
&gt;&gt; LAKSHMI: Yes.
&gt;&gt; PATRICK: Dynamically on the blind side.

00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:27.610
&gt;&gt; LAKSHMI: That's right.
&gt;&gt; PATRICK: Yeah, that's a new type of architecture

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:32.180
where you have your data repository somewhere
else and you are doing these [INDISTINCT]

00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:37.059
peoples. And thanks to the security token,
you can do a restful under severed sites to

00:08:37.059 --> 00:08:39.659
make sure that user is...
&gt;&gt; LAKSHMI: And one good thing is all the

00:08:39.659 --> 00:08:44.019
data is going to be installed in App Engine
at some point of time, you may want to do

00:08:44.019 --> 00:08:49.449
some internal community or whatever inside
TIME.com. We can just export everything from

00:08:49.449 --> 00:08:53.699
App Engine so we have all the user information
and we just dump in with [INDISTINCT].

00:08:53.699 --> 00:08:57.220
&gt;&gt; YORK: Right. If you remember, one of the–sort
of the challenges that are thrown to you guys

00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:02.640
was that this was easy to build. So we didn’t
want to have to build a database and then

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:06.779
build their architecture. So it was having
Google’s App Engine there was a huge help

00:09:06.779 --> 00:09:11.519
to us. So the data is there for us and available
for us to use when we have our own community.

00:09:11.519 --> 00:09:18.170
But for now, we didn’t have to create a
new database, new servers. So, it was just

00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:21.199
very quick to get it up and running because
of that.

00:09:21.199 --> 00:09:23.689
&gt;&gt; PATRICK: Great.
&gt;&gt; LAKSHMI: Yeah, we also integrated with

00:09:23.689 --> 00:09:27.480
Facebook to come out, and one little thing
we missed with that is we don’t squat the

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:31.800
data and we don’t know who come with the–what
is happening because there was one disc with

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:38.509
this Google Friend Connect as it's stored
in App Engine, we have all the data in there.

00:09:38.509 --> 00:09:42.949
&gt;&gt; YORK: And another feature that I forgot
to mention earlier was--so as--not just people

00:09:42.949 --> 00:09:46.679
being able to share their own list, another
thing that you guys implemented that was terrific

00:09:46.679 --> 00:09:51.790
was being able to see a user view of our list.
So there's the editorial-driven list of top

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:55.829
10 movie catchphrases and then there's a version
that people can come to and see that this

00:09:55.829 --> 00:10:00.970
is how everybody in the community in TIME.com
and Google and Yahoo and Facebook had ranked

00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:07.579
it. And this is what they think is the top
10 movie catchphrases or top 10 iPhone Apps.

00:10:07.579 --> 00:10:11.040
And even if you don’t play around with the
list and even if you're not that highly engaged

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:15.699
users that creates their own list, it's just
interesting to come back to see the two different

00:10:15.699 --> 00:10:19.999
versions of the list. And I think that’s
where I was sort of we'll catch a lot of users

00:10:19.999 --> 00:10:23.170
that are skeptical about trying their own
version of it.

00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:27.189
&gt;&gt; LAKSHMI: And the other good thing is as
we have implemented in Google Friend Connect

00:10:27.189 --> 00:10:33.519
is site disc. It's not like a list disc or
anything. Once you're signed in the future

00:10:33.519 --> 00:10:37.839
in TIME.com just like if you need something
or anything for this list. You start with

00:10:37.839 --> 00:10:43.459
some comments, whatever, it's going to be
an easy step. Maybe a couple of pause to a

00:10:43.459 --> 00:10:46.310
day to integrate the product.
&gt;&gt; PATRICK: Yeah, because you own the data.

00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:50.839
&gt;&gt; YORK: Yeah. I mean, I was very impressed
by the time that it took you guys to build

00:10:50.839 --> 00:10:54.320
it and get it up and running. I mean, I seriously
didn't think that you guys will be able to

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:57.829
do this by the conference. So...
&gt;&gt; LAKSHMI: The conference was done in less

00:10:57.829 --> 00:10:58.850
than three weeks.
&gt;&gt; YORK: It took three weeks. That included

00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:04.170
use cases, designs, building, building the
database, you know, doing all the backend

00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:07.699
work. So it's–the time to get it up and
running, the speed of it is quite amazing.

00:11:07.699 --> 00:11:13.490
&gt;&gt; PATRICK: It feels really comforting.
&gt;&gt; YORK: Staying up till 3 am doing it, so...

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:17.459
&gt;&gt; PATRICK: Yeah, as usual.
&gt;&gt; LAKSHMI: It wasn't though, see? That is

00:11:17.459 --> 00:11:23.610
good response work here and many people liked
it. So we hope we will launch the VL version

00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:28.999
some time [INDISTINCT] so that we give users
the ability to make their own [INDISTINCT].

00:11:28.999 --> 00:11:31.509
&gt;&gt; PATRICK: That's great, and I look forward
to see live [INDISTINCT].

00:11:31.509 --> 00:11:33.990
&gt;&gt; YORK: Yeah, us, too, are very excited about
it.

00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:39.739
&gt;&gt; PATRICK: I know. So, tell me about the
statistics. So how do you see the–how the

00:11:39.739 --> 00:11:46.670
users have rated this list?
&gt;&gt; YORK: So you have to do some work to see

00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:51.759
how other people have rated the list. So the
user interaction right now or when we launched

00:11:51.759 --> 00:11:57.759
will be–you have to create your own list
in order to see how the rest of the community

00:11:57.759 --> 00:12:03.339
has ranked the list, which we think is a better
user experience because you sort of get something

00:12:03.339 --> 00:12:09.489
at the end of creating a list. And then you
also get a histogram which you implemented

00:12:09.489 --> 00:12:14.399
recently. So you get a version of how users
have ranked this list and they also get little

00:12:14.399 --> 00:12:19.600
charts, which are very interesting to see
on how each item has been ranked by the user.

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:23.579
So it's just another view of how that list
was rated by other people.

00:12:23.579 --> 00:12:28.129
&gt;&gt; LAKSHMI: Yeah, it's going to be [INDISTINCT]
sort of, like, so, you know, [INDISTINCT]

00:12:28.129 --> 00:12:35.069
said that it's something on the flash point–flash
disc made by editors and maybe the users didn't

00:12:35.069 --> 00:12:40.489
like it. It's going to be–many people would
have rated that it’s number ten, or something

00:12:40.489 --> 00:12:46.209
like that. It's going to be a good and clean
graphical representation of how the other

00:12:46.209 --> 00:12:48.720
one was rated.
&gt;&gt; YORK: Right. And as I mentioned, you know,

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:52.449
this lists are highly engaging for our users.
I mean, you know, we get a tremendous page

00:12:52.449 --> 00:12:57.290
view numbers on this. So we're just hoping
that by launching this, we increase that engagement

00:12:57.290 --> 00:13:00.259
on our site.
&gt;&gt; PATRICK: Okay, we're excited to see how

00:13:00.259 --> 00:13:05.519
it will go. Actually, it would be really interesting
to get some numbers and you can share some

00:13:05.519 --> 00:13:07.579
like the moms after launching that or...
&gt;&gt; YORK: Definitely.

00:13:07.579 --> 00:13:12.899
&gt;&gt; PATRICK: [INDISTINCT]something great of
trying to see how more engaging these lists

00:13:12.899 --> 00:13:16.059
are.
&gt;&gt; YORK: Yeah. And modify it if something

00:13:16.059 --> 00:13:17.989
isn't working.
&gt;&gt; PATRICK: Yeah. Sure.

00:13:17.989 --> 00:13:24.160
&gt;&gt; YORK: Yeah. This is a new [INDISTINCT]
released by Google Friend Connect. It was

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:26.380
released two months ago, so.
&gt;&gt; PATRICK: Yeah.

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:30.389
&gt;&gt; LAKSHMI: So I think that is somewhat involved
in both TIME.com site and the Google site

00:13:30.389 --> 00:13:33.649
to make it more optimized. It was the test
what happens.

00:13:33.649 --> 00:13:38.519
&gt;&gt; PATRICK: Oh, yeah, the application is quite
cutting edge. So here, you're using the Google

00:13:38.519 --> 00:13:39.779
Friend Connect JavaScript TPI...
&gt;&gt; LAKSHMI: Yes.

00:13:39.779 --> 00:13:41.680
&gt;&gt; PATRICK: That's only two months old.
&gt;&gt; LAKSHMI: And [INDISTINCT].

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:42.680
&gt;&gt; PATRICK: [INDISTINCT], which is also two
months old.

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:44.299
&gt;&gt; LAKSHMI: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; PATRICK: There's Google App Engine...

00:13:44.299 --> 00:13:48.999
&gt;&gt; LAKSHMI: And I believe this is the fast
site using both of those.

00:13:48.999 --> 00:13:53.889
&gt;&gt; PATRICK: Yeah. Yeah, I think you are the
first big site who's going live with this,

00:13:53.889 --> 00:13:59.350
except maybe for Washington Post. They did
a demo as well. I think they're using–I

00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:06.870
don’t know if they're using both. I think
they're using the [INDISTINCT]. I need to

00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:15.741
double check with them. But, essentially,
you–the Washington Post and TIME.com will–are

00:14:15.741 --> 00:14:16.741
the first ones to go right with this.
&gt;&gt; YORK: That's great.

00:14:16.741 --> 00:14:18.619
&gt;&gt; PATRICK: And then you're using App Engine
and you're using the [INDISTINCT] for...

00:14:18.619 --> 00:14:21.649
&gt;&gt; YORK: Right...
&gt;&gt; PATRICK: It's full of Google products.

00:14:21.649 --> 00:14:28.640
That was–that's what made this list.
&gt;&gt; YORK: Right. And I think, you know, once

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:34.769
we get to the larger list, at the 100 list,
the UI will be very interesting because we're

00:14:34.769 --> 00:14:39.649
going to have to make some changes, too, to
let people be able to easily browse through

00:14:39.649 --> 00:14:45.759
the 100 and create their own version of each
list. So we'll come across that bridge over

00:14:45.759 --> 00:14:49.359
the next few months. But we're excited about
launching it for the daily top 10 and then

00:14:49.359 --> 00:14:53.660
expanding it out to the rest of our specials.
&gt;&gt; PATRICK: Okay. Great. I look forward to

00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:56.449
see that live.
&gt;&gt; YORK: Great. Thanks, Patrick, and Srivaths

00:14:56.449 --> 00:14:59.959
for all your help. And we also have a third
person which is actually missing from the

00:14:59.959 --> 00:15:04.449
interview, Henry Chan, who tremendously helped
and he did all the front-end work.

00:15:04.449 --> 00:15:07.529
&gt;&gt; PATRICK: Henry should have been there.
He spent lots of nights coding that...

00:15:07.529 --> 00:15:11.839
&gt;&gt; YORK: Yeah, he's maybe getting–catching
up on sleep at this point. So, I can't blame

00:15:11.839 --> 00:15:14.600
him.
&gt;&gt; PATRICK: I'm pretty sure he needs it. Okay,

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:16.379
thanks very much.
&gt;&gt; YORK: Thanks, Patrick.

00:15:16.379 --> 00:15:17.569
&gt;&gt; LAKSHMI: Thank you.
